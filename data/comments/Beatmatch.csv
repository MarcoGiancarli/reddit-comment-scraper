Beatmatch,3e76h0,TheOutdoorsGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:06:00 2015 UTC,Maybe youtube? There're a ton of videos where you can see people mixing and maybe some review-videos where the controller will be explained. At least that would be my guess as I did the same with my DDJ-SX2.

Beatmatch,3e6f00,LookArpTheStars,2,Wed Jul 22 08:51:40 2015 UTC,"Behringer has a reputation for making things with poor build quality and sound quality. If you're really only considering those two, I'd suggest Hercules over Behringer. Better yet, I recommend considering a Numark Mixtrack (Pro) 2 or 3. I just saw that Sweetwater has a great deal on the Mixtrack 3 right now (non-Pro, so you'd need a separate sound card)."
Beatmatch,3e6f00,_Be_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"The 4A is perfectly fine. I'd also look at the Gemini Slate2, which is a good intro controller as well. The problem with the 4a is it just come with deckadance, though there is a Traktor mapping.  I have heard that Hercules controllers have gotten better since I last saw them in the wild... but meh, they have always been meh."
Beatmatch,3e530v,mylittlepony696969,15,Wed Jul 22 00:47:51 2015 UTC,"Do a bit of searching before posting. This is one of the hot topics on this sub.  My favorite answer from one of the other threads by /u/SigmaTheDJ:   I think it's a bad tool for beginners, but a useful one for more experienced DJs.  The reason it's a bad tool for beginners is because it takes time to develop a ""DJ's ear"", where you can critique your own mixes well. I have given a lot of feedback on DJ mixes over the years and since the arrival of sync, a lot of mixes have had perfect beatmatching but poor everything else, but the DJ who made the mix isn't yet capable of recognising that their phrase matching, EQing and levels are off, or that they're overusing effects or pressing cue buttons out of time or whatever. It ends up giving people a false impression of how long it takes to get good, and you have folks putting mixes up on SoundCloud and making Facebook fan pages a week after they've got their first ever setup, which is just crazy.  One thing that even a beginner DJ will recognise is if 2 songs are way out when it comes to beatmatching, so if they had a mix full of trainwrecks they wouldn't post it online - they'd work on their beatmatching, and while doing that, all the other skills get better as well. So, not using sync as a beginner acts as a barrier to you posting crappy mixes online, then looking back 2 or 3 years down the line and cringing about it.  It's a good tool for more experienced DJs, because it allows you to do things that would be very tough or maybe even impossible to do without it. Also, I would agree that once you're experienced, it doesn't really matter how you're mixing, so it's your choice whether to use sync or not - the overall quality of your mixing will be solid, which is something that the new guys using sync usually cannot say."

So do a search through /r/ama   The jobs I've seen don't pay particularly amazing, but it's tempered by the fact that you don't need to pay for rent or food while you're on board so I guess it's easy to save.  The one rule I've heard you never fuck with is don't hook up with guests.

While it was good to have the summer, sunset and party tunes ready, you might wanna research and find out who are the main cruise passengers.  The cruise I was on board was popular with India and China nationals, so despite belting out all the grooviest tunes, it was the Indian tourists that requested for 'Bollywood disco' tunes, which unfortunately I didn't have. But the resident DJ had, so he got the crowd going."

Beatmatch,3e3iig,ADUBROCKSKI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"Celebrity DJ...who are you exactly? lol - not taking a jab at you just curious  Whats expected of you as the DJ?  Do you need to be doing anything beyond DJing?    What are the living arrangements like?  I've read in an AMA from a cruise ship employee that its pretty shitty for a lot of them, wondering if the DJs get the same shit as the rest.  How long are you typically contracted for?  Did you get any down time?  If you don't mind me asking, what was the pay range.  Thanks!"
Beatmatch,3e3iig,justjacobmusic,4,Wed Jul 22 02:42:04 2015 UTC,"There are two kinds of DJs on cruise ships, the resident DJ and the celebrity DJ.  The resident works for the cruise line and is just a regular staff member with a large (usually 6 month) contract.  The celebrity DJ is contracted out and does usually 2 week or month long stints.  The celebrity DJ is usually a rather well known DJ from the US somewhere who works for a DJ company.  I was expected to DJ in the club on the cruise ship as well as specialty parties throughout the week.  Occasionally I'd do something extra for cash.  Only DJed, didn't do anything else.  As the celebrity DJ you get your own tiny room, as a resident DJ you have a super tiny staff room you share with someone else.   I was contracted for a month, DJing 3-8 hours per day depending.  The one day I only had a 45 minute showcase, so a pretty good amount of downtime.  I was able to go to port and do excursions and stuff like that.  As far as pay goes, I could make more money on a weekend in my city, but on the cruise ship you barely have any expenses and you're basically on vacation for a month, so it kinda equals out.  Plus my cruise fell right in the winter where gigs were light anyway so it was pretty clutch."

Beatmatch,3e4yt6,mylittlepony696969,2,Wed Jul 22 00:13:10 2015 UTC,"Most importantly (in my opinion), the NV is meant for Serato, and the S4 is meant for Traktor.  After messing around with both at a guitar center for a while, the S4 definitely took the cake for me. It is mapped for every little nook and cranny of Traktor and your possibilities with that software are endless with that piece of equipment. With all the remix decks and such, it is a Traktor monster. The NV just didn't feel great to me, but then again, I'm going with a Pioneer DDJ-SR because to me the DDJ series felt superior to both the NV and the S4.  Both are fantastic tools to moving forward and progressing with DJing, it's all on what direction you want to go in. And if you really don't think you have the need to use 4 physical channels at all, I would consider the DDJ-SR. High quality build, two mixer channels but can control 4 decks if needed, and mapped to work with Serato. Its also $100 less than the NV and the S4.  I would really go try them out to see what you dig the most. That's the best way to feel it out."
Beatmatch,3e4yt6,dhy615,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:36 2015 UTC,"Neither will completely change anything or make DJing easier to learn. They are, effectively, the same controller, just one has screens and is meant for Serato, and the other is for Traktor. I prefer the S4, but I prefer Traktor myself, so there's that.  It really comes down to what application you want to use."
Beatmatch,3e4ysv,pyg1991,2,Wed Jul 22 00:13:03 2015 UTC,"Real question is, do you want to learn Serato, or continue on unabashed with MP3s and use Rekordbox.  I personally have an SZ, but ultimately, I felt that Serato was as fine as any, and I came from the Traktor line of controllers. EDIT: Also, do you ever want to do four decks, if so SZ is the option, as the RX does not offer it.  There are probably a few features like this, so do a side by side, but with Pioneer you are buying quality, either model."
Beatmatch,3e4ysv,Beau_Barger,2,Wed Jul 22 02:34:01 2015 UTC,In all honesty man i always thought the SZ was stupidly big. The main advantage of a controller is portability. And that might as well just be CDJ's and a mixer. See if you can't get a new SX for that price - I love mine more than the SZ my mate has :P
Beatmatch,3e4ysv,capnjames,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:17:26 2015 UTC,"Only things I don't like about the sz is the lack of post fader software effects and the clumsy implementation of the hardware effects.  Also, if you plan on taking it to gigs, it's a bit on the large side of things.  Other than that, it's one of the best controllers on the market.  Love the large platters."
Beatmatch,3e4ysv,dj_soo,0,Wed Jul 22 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"For me the RX.  If you gig and they only have cddjs you should be able to play the same with no real complications. No need for the laptop or messing about with line or phono connections.  Also at home its a smaller footprint.  It's just my opinion, but I've viewed serrato, etc, as a transition phase until the dedicated hardware gain the computational capacity to handle similar processing.  I felt the same way about mixing with CDs as MP3s were always going to end up being the future."
Beatmatch,3e4fk1,PrinceofEden23,4,Tue Jul 21 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"If you have a laptop, I would download Mixxx or Virtual DJ as /u/Oremm suggested. Mess around a little, see if you enjoy dabbling with music that way. Once you decide you want to take the next step, you buy a controller. If you find out it's not really for you, then no money lost.  I know you had a budget set of $200, but with one of $200 you will be extremely limited. Stretch that to $250 and you can get a Pioneer DDJ-SB controller to get started. It has a built in sound card (you can route your audio out to speakers, and to your headphones as well), and comes with an Intro version of one of the most popular DJ softwares out there, Serato."

You will need software, and you can get starter-level stuff (Mixxx or VirtualDJ) for free.  As for budgets, $200 won't go very far in terms of hardware, but it will buy you plenty of tunes.  For example, the NI Z1 is $200 and it's a VERY basic controller."

Some others have mentioned the Traktor Kontrol Z1. I don't recommend that for your budget. The small Traktor controllers seem to be deliberately designed to have just barely not enough features to make worth using individually to pressure you into buying another one.

The Traktor kontrol Z1 is a good start.  This also includes the Traktor DJ software. The most important thing about the controller is that it has a built-in sound card. Really, any controller you find in your budget will do.   I've been DJing for around 10 years and professionally for 4.  I've tried all kinds of DJ software.  Virtual DJ is for beginners I suppose.  I use to DJ a lot of house parties with it WITHOUT equipment.  Traktor has always been good to me.  When I got my first controller this was my go to software.  It has always been feature robust and flexible with any controller I've used.  Very easy to map controls.  Serato is great too but with your budget don't even think about it.  If I were you, skip Serato and purchase rekordbox compatible hardware.  At work, I use CDJ2000s with rekordbox, but we also have a Pioneer XDJ-r1.  Fantastic unit.  Great all in one setup for about $900.  This a GREAT, cost effective way to get rid of the laptop. So if you get serious, check it out."

Beatmatch,3e1kgj,robkramble,5,Tue Jul 21 06:33:19 2015 UTC,Following the key tags isn't the be-all-end-all. Just play what sounds good.
Beatmatch,3e1kgj,Oremm,2,Tue Jul 21 06:43:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely.... the key is not always necessarily important, sometimes the most random combinations of track with different keys can work well together by simply finding the right section to bring them in at... spend some time experimenting with different cue points and make sure you know the tracks you are using inside and out to find out what works well"

Beatmatch,3e1kgj,plasticTron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:32 2015 UTC,"Beatports key analysis has been proven as widely unreliable during testing - often wrong on major/minor and fifths  MiK on the other hand was almost never wrong in recognizing the difference between major and minor keys, wrong a few times on the right fifth - but only off by one step up or down so still pretty good. I would trust MiK personally if you had to choose."
Beatmatch,3e1kgj,DJ_Theo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:59 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree with others here who have said trust your ears and to not rely on the key tags. Personally, I think depending on key tags to mix or as a decision maker to buy certain tunes is doing yourself a big disservice. You can come up with some pretty great results just by experimenting, especially with Drum and Bass music. I think DnB is one of the most exotic forms of dance music out there and just has so much room for experimentation. It's flexible, so stretch that shit out and don't restrict yourself to certain keys. Just my $0.02."

Beatmatch,3dyu6o,Dantejb,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:56 2015 UTC,You need to either have an SL box compatible with Serato DJ (SL2+) or the DVS expansion for the SX.
Beatmatch,3dyu6o,DR1LLM4N,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:21 2015 UTC,I'm on a DDJSX but I'm curious as to why you would want the CDJ to run through serato when the SX2 is a pretty good comparison.   If you use the CDJ independently you could run it through the line in on deck 4 or 1 (assuming it's the same as my SX) and the SX2 should work as a mixer. I do this with dual controllers and it works phenomenally.
Beatmatch,3dyu6o,dj_soo,3,Mon Jul 20 23:06:08 2015 UTC,it's so you can control a 3rd and 4th deck within the software using additional platters/cdjs rather than just switching between decks 1/2 and 3/4 using the same platter.
Beatmatch,3dyu6o,DR1LLM4N,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, that makes sense. That would actually be awesome. Can't believe I didn't think of that."
Beatmatch,3dyu6o,dj_soo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"actually, now that I think about it, since the CDJ 2000 supports HID mode, you shouldn't need to spend the $99 on the DVS plugin at all.  You should just be able to run the CDJ in HID to control the extra deck set in internal mode.    http://djtechtools.com/2015/03/05/using-pioneer-cdjs-in-hid-mode-with-serato-djscratch-live/"
Beatmatch,3dyu6o,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:44 2015 UTC,What exactly is HID mode?
Beatmatch,3dyu6o,fuckingname,2,Mon Jul 20 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"HID mode enables your CDJ to control Serato as a straight midi controller without having to use the timecode.  It also allows for automatic mapping of various controls on the CDJ to serato.  So it basically turns your CDJ into a plattered midi controller for serato.    Timecode requires an audio signal being fed from the CDJ or turntable.  This feature is what requires the $99 DVS update.  Whereas HID does not require any audio signal and only outputs straight midi signals.  I'm not sure how HID works with controllers like the SX2, so it may be something you need to look into."

Beatmatch,3dzozq,Derezzed_Iben,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:19 2015 UTC,I would defintley go fo the xone mixer. The effects are way better than the pioneer which makes that minimal techno a lot more fun to play imo.  Especially once you add in the D2s and Push. That sounds like a really fun setup.  Super expensive though.
Beatmatch,3dzozq,fuckingname,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:27 2015 UTC,It's not so bad if you shop around on Ebay.
Beatmatch,3dzozq,SupaSandeep,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"I have both & I side with the Xone DB:4, it's just overall a more quality mixer... Yes it's a pain taking the DB4 to every gig vs just using the DJM900 (which the venue is more likely to have) but it's really worth it, considering your style of music I really think the DB4 would be best.  the DJM900 is a good all-around mixer & they both have pros/cons  DB4  pros - Better sound quality, better quality effects, more effects, built in loopers, built in audio interface, Serato Club Kit compatible, 1 FX unit per channel, light weight, very in depth options,  FILTERS!, tri-modal EQ, MIDI shift, option to switch the faders w/ rotaries (making it a rotary mixer)  cons - company doesn't seem to be focused much on it anymore, no send/return, digital mixer (some people prefer the analog Xone:92), higher price, not Traktor scratch certified (audio interface still works with Traktor, just no DVS support.... I was able to hack it & it works fine)  DJM900NXS pros - industry standard, clean workflow, bipolar filter per channel, Traktor Scratch Certified, Serato Club Kit compatible, send/return, X-Pad, 2 mic inputs cons - sound quality, over-exaggerated effects (they're really loud & clip very easily), heavier weight, not standard 12"" size (makes shopping for a case harder)"
Beatmatch,3dzozq,SupaSandeep,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:14 2015 UTC,Oh. I didn't even realize it had a built-in audio interface. I think I'm going with the DB4. But I can't find anything about making it a rotary mixer. Found a post on the NI forum about swapping the D/W knobs with the linear volume faders through a firmware update. That's just genius.
Beatmatch,3dzozq,dj_soo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"they both have built in audio interfaces, the difference is in DVS compatibility, but in your case that's irrelevant... and yes, the rotary/linear fader swap is AWESOME! there's a LOT of genius under-rated features on that mixer"

Beatmatch,3dxova,98PercentChimp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"No harm in asking to practice. You might have more luck if you make friends with a resident (if there is one) that plays there first and they can either vouch for you or go in with you.   But don't ever offer to play for free at any event that isn't a house party or a event as a favour as a friend or something. If you feel your skills are good enough to play out in public, then they are good enough to get paid for. As it is, club owners/promoters nowadays usually expect you to do a certain amount of promoting yourself and have an established fan base in addition to owning your own music library and being able to keep a crowd entertained properly. When you offer to play for free, you not only devalue yourself and your services but also all other DJs in your area as well.   We can all argue how much DJs should deserve to be paid, but imagine you had a dream full-time day job... Something that you loved doing even outside of work. Would you agree to do it for free just because you love doing it?"

Beatmatch,3dyvfo,Dantejb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"With everything you said, your best bet would be getting a Traktor S4 or S8. They're made for Traktor, which is a very producer friendly and customizable software. At that point, it's really a matter of whether you want jogwheels and a few extra features or not. The S8 is newer, pricier, lacks jogwheels, but has screens. The S4 has jogwheels, is older, but lacks a few of the new features of the S8, and does not have screens. Your other option would be getting a X1,Z1,F1 combo, which is a compact and modular setup that'll do everything in Traktor, but it does not have jog wheels.  The benefit of having jogwheels is being able to DJ more traditionally, whereas if you lack them, manually beatmatching is difficult and you'll find yourself relying on sync a lot.  Also note that all of these options are 4 deck controllers, meaning you can play 4 songs/remix decks at the same time. If you want to start out with 2, go for the Traktor S2, however you may grow out of it relatively quickly."

It isn't traditional DJing by any means, and it can screw you over if you're taken out of your setup, but it's beneficial for live production type sets. The VCI400 is built like a tank, and Ean Golden is basically a legend amongst controllerist DJs, so I would recommend it, but remember that Vestax is out of business, so treat the thing right because sourcing replacement parts becomes the biggest bitch."

I just played my second show and had an opening role. I feel like in this mix I may be carrying the energy level too high for too long and not giving the audience a break to breathe. Also I think the transition from 7/11 to What a Shame is a bit rusty and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to mix that differently.  Also what are your thoughts on the My Way // Racks mash-up? Is it high energy or does it seem more deflating? Thank you guys!!"
Beatmatch,3dwvq5,olieogden,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"Hey man!  Had a listen to your mix, most of the songs mixed in well but as you said, this was an opening set! the constant mixing is technically well done and may be able to pass in the background but it does carry a lot of energy. Personally would allow the mix to flow more and mix less frequently, although that's more my style too and what i'd prefer for an opening set.  In terms of the my way mashup. I felt it fitted quite well despite maybe one phrase where it clashed, but still really well done!  Nice mix. You obviously have the skill to mix so i'd continue looking at improving the flow and song selection for an opening mix. However something like this at a more peak time could easily fit!  Cheers"

I normally don't spin much house so I wasn't AS comfortable as I normally am spinning future bass and trap just because you tend to mix it a bit differently (e.g. longer transitions). Overall I really enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone and I think I did a fairly good job of conveying certain emotions throughout the mix. Thanks for the feedback & hope you enjoy!

Beatmatch,3dy9b1,dhy615,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:38 2015 UTC,I think if you press the knob that selects the timing of the loop it activates it and then pressing again halts it.  Similar to the pads.

Beatmatch,3dwfne,PKZA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:04 2015 UTC,My golden rule for DJ'ing - Track selection rules over technicalities. Of course you need to practice actual DJ'ing but once I had the basics down I started to spend way more time just searching for new songs and getting to hear them on a nice sound system is awesome.
Beatmatch,3dwfne,dj_soo,6,Mon Jul 20 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"it just takes practice.  You'll eventually get to a point where you don't really have to think about the fundamentals and they just come naturally.  Even without aides like waveforms and bpm counters, I can basically get tracks roughly beatmatched in seconds and then babysit it out for most of the mix to get things tightened up.   When I started, it would take the better part of a 5+ minute track and often it wouldn't be properly beatmatched in the end."
Beatmatch,3dwfne,dhy615,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:21 2015 UTC,"Whenever I'm messing around or whatever, I just get into it subconsciously.  I could be using djay 2 on my phone laying on my bed after a long day of work just dicking around and sloppily beatmatching what I have on my phone. And I'll still just bob my head and dance around a little by myself. It's all about enjoying yourself.  Once the timing comes a bit more natural to you and your ability to hear the parts of songs you need to in order to beatmatch, everything just gets better and better.  Confidence and experience definitely are factors. So just keep practicing and doing you and eventually things will flow a bit more and be a little more natural for you.  For me at least, there's something about music that just gets me feeling some kind of way. When I find a new track that I'm vibing to real good I'll just play it over and over moving to the music and just feeling it out. I'll send the soundcloud link to everyone I know, make sure my DJ friends hear it, etc etc. Music is a language everyone can speak and vibe to which is cliche but super true.  Once you get deeper into feeling your music and getting more comfortable doing what you're doing with your equipment, the joy will just come naturally. When you're having fun, the crowd (which could just be yourself), and everyone around you will have fun."

Beatmatch,3dwfne,dhy615,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"Just takes practice or knowing your tracks. Like you're not gonna mix together two bumping melodies with prominent bass lines from two different tracks. The more you know your music and the flow of your mixing, the more you'll be able to know what sounds good when played and mixed together."
Beatmatch,3dwfne,n-some,3,Mon Jul 20 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it is impossible to enjoy yourself DJing.  But no, for real once you get the hang of it the flow comes so naturally that you're basically just playing a set to dance to.  I don't even have to think about timing my transitions anymore, it's completely instinctual when to drop the next track."
Beatmatch,3dwfne,chriscgo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:31:47 2015 UTC,It gets more fun as you move along. Think of it like learning to ride a bike. It's hard at first and you will fuck up but once you get it you won't wanna stop.
Beatmatch,3dwfne,DJ_Theo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:00:19 2015 UTC,"Once the basics are muscle memory and your just ""know"" how your transition will sound before it happens - then it's easy and you you can start getting creative to keep the crowd on their feet.

In the studio, whenever I find that perfect mix of tracks that just works.... man, there's no feeling like that.

Beatmatch,3dwkvj,Trick_Shot,2,Mon Jul 20 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"What hardware should I look at? I have a pretty uneducated idea of what to look for. I have a decent laptop and speaker at the moment so I'm set there. I'm assuming a couple turntables or a CDJ would be helpful (hoping that's the correct wording). I like what I've looked at from Traktor and Serato, but I'm open to Pioneer as well.    CDJs and a mixer are expensive to start off with, and if you find out djing isn't your thing then you're sunk over a thousand dollars in DJ gear. Find a good beginner DJ controller. Current favorites in the market right now are the numark mixtrack pro 1/2/3, pioneer ddj sb, and maybe the Traktor kontrol s2     Should I be looking for something like the Traktor Control or Traktor Scratch? Not quite sure on the finite differences between each but have heard both are good.    Currently the 3 main players when it comes to DJ software is Traktor, serato, and virtual DJ.   Traktor is aimed more towards controllerists who will utilize all 4 decks in a controllerist manner where they'll use sync between 4 tracks, loop drum rolls, and maybe also attach midi drum pads too. The nice thing about Traktor is that it's versatile and you can map any controller to it. The downside though is that only the controllers that Traktor makes offers a really good integration between hardware and software. Price for Traktor is 80 usd.   Serato has a great interface and is more or less the club standard. A lot of controllers are built specifically for the serato software. I haven't googled it but I don't think controllers that aren't supported by serato can be mapped with work with serato. This is the software I use and I'm happy with it. Price for serato is 130 usd.   Virtually DJ is looked down upon for some reason, I've used vdj7 before and while it's not bad it's a little rough around the edges here and there. Also, it's the most expensive software at 300 usd.     What is an audio interface, and why do I need it? Have heard these words thrown around a couple times.    I'm not sure what an audio interface is actually so I'll have someone that knows answer this question. I think it's either the sound card that's built into some controllers so you can route your music to your speakers and cue music into your headphones at the same time or it allows you to connect multiple midi controllers together.     If I do get a CDJ or other hardware, will the necessary software accompany it? Or do I need to make another purchase?    CDJs made by pioneer can be used with serato if you have a serato box which is a separate purchase otherwise you can just use them with USB sticks or cds. Controllers use software and usually controllers are made for a specific software.     Where do you guys get the music you use? Do you buy each song?    I get a lot of free music from SoundCloud, most of the time up and coming artists will release their music for free on there. I also use Beatport. I don't know what other people use. The higher quality music you have the better, most of my songs are at 320 kbps. You can definitely tell the difference on between a 128 bit rate song and a 320 bit rate on big speakers   Also, since you use ableton you can also look into live mixing using ableton as your djing software with midi like an akai launchpad or something. It's different from traditional mixing but it works pretty well"
Beatmatch,3dwkvj,Enesex,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:30 2015 UTC,Wow. Thanks for spending the time to write on each individual point. I’ve definitely been focusing on quality sound files but thanks for the tip on 128 vs 320 bit rate. I actually own a Launchpad S! It was a gift from a relative that I’ve only recently been learning to use. Will the Launchpad S work within Serato if I want to use it as a looper or midi controller?
Beatmatch,3dwkvj,dhy615,3,Mon Jul 20 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the launchpad can be mapped to Serato if need be. Could be useful for triggering samples/etc.  Here is a mapping someone made and posted to DJ TechTools. As I said, I'm sure you could map it and use it with Serato DJ to suit it to your needs.  And definitely keep your eyes open when downloading music in terms of 128 vs 320 kbps. A 320 or a 256 from iTunes will sound lightyears better than a YouTube RIP or anything like that."
Beatmatch,3dwkvj,Dantejb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:08:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! That mapping will probably come in handy soon.
Beatmatch,3dwkvj,dhy615,2,Mon Jul 20 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat you won't be getting CDJs or TT setups. Those cost about 1K minimum. You're better off getting a DJ controller like the Pioneer DDJ-SB or Traktor S2. Each comes with software, built in sound card, and it's a good learning tool.   Traktor and Serato are programs. Native Instruments makes the Traktor software and gear, whereas Pioneer and Rane specialize in providing Serato Enabled hardware  Traktor Kontrol products run Traktor Scratch as a program and comes with the license, so if you were to go that direction, you'd be limited to only Traktor as a program, as Serato does not support those products.  Audio interfaces are used in traditionally non software setups (Read: TTs and CDJs) to play off of a software. This isn't necessary for DJing, but it gives you more options for what you can do during a set.  CDJs do not come with software. They can run without a laptop by using USBs or CDs to play music. You'd obviously need a mixer, and these setups are typically more advanced and pricier for a DJ just starting out.  We buy our songs, dig for music we find is good, join record pools, find mp3 websites which categorize free releases, ect. We do NOT rip off of youtube."
Beatmatch,3dwkvj,_Be_,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:50 2015 UTC,"I second all of the things written here.  Pioneer DDJ-SB is a stellar beginner item as is the S2. Just depends on if you want the Serato or Traktor direction.  Good job /u/Dantejb, hitting all the nails on the head."

The pitch sliders on my Mixtrack Pro are short and impractical, which makes beatmatching kind of annoying just because I have to move the slider precisely enough that I'm always tempted to just look at the BPM counter or waveforms, but I got the opportunity to play some of my records on a Technics setup for a club's open decks night, and it made the process of beatmatching more fun."
Beatmatch,3dtpr3,dhy615,2,Sun Jul 19 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"I really found that better hardware makes it easier to beatmatch. I couldn't for the life of me on my Hercules Console RMX. Tried for months to teach myself. Was djing with my friend on his CDJ 2ks, and it was instant. Just came naturally, like the matrix I know Kung Fu shit. Went back to my controller thinking I had it and I just couldn't. The biggest thing for me was that with the CDJs any input was absolutely instant. The buttons didn't move until they were actually clicking. There's a little bit of play in the Hercules, so it's harder to launch a song exactly on the beat. This combined with a little bit of latency I think is inherent on a cheaper controller made it really difficult.    Nailing a manual beatmatch is so satisfying though."

It even produces a subtle effect once its matched that may be hard for others to pick up but through headphones its really noticeable."

Beatmatch,3duj9a,el_Tobby,4,Sun Jul 19 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"Would be nice if a serato-guy would confirm this, as far as my understanding goes it is like this:  As he uses the CDJs in HID mode the audio is only coming from the SL1 box. The audio jacks from the CDJs aren't connected to the SL1 (because he doesn't use timecode CDs) and stay plugged into the mixer. In the case of HID the audio-part of the CDJs are completely bypassed as everything audio related is handled by the SL1.  If he uses timecode the CDJs need to be connected to the SL1, but there should be something like a ""through"" mode which passes the audio straight through the SL1 (at least traktor has it, correct me if it doesn't exist in SSL).  So no you don't have to reconnect the CDJs audio jacks, but it could be tricky if timecode is used."
Beatmatch,3duj9a,zoink43,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"This is correct all points. If he's using HID there's no issue, the audio out of the CDJs isn't used and you can flip between CD/USB/LINK at will... and switching to USB or CD from LINK won't interrupt playback of that Serato deck.   If he's using timecode then there is a THRU option in SSL and SDJ which will allow playback of regular CDs or USB sticks."
Beatmatch,3duj9a,omers,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:45 2015 UTC,Connect both the RCAs and Digital coaxial (orange RCAs). RCAs for serato. Digital for USB. Then flip back and forth between cd line and digital on the input selector.

Beatmatch,3dmswm,luismpinto,3,Fri Jul 17 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"As of 2014 this wasn't possible because the effects are post fader. Whether that's changed since or not I do not know, all google searches suggest it hasn't.   Q. The effects of Serato DJ only appear in the master output, it's not possible to listen to them with the headphones. That's a big disadvantage because you can't try them out without playing them on the floor.    \   A. You are correct. The effects units inside SERATO DJ are post fader. This means you will only be able to hear them on the master output channel. You cant CUE up a tune and apply effects to it to see what they might sound like.  On a DJM800 you have a CUE button so you can hear the effect in your headphones. The PIONEER DDJ-SX does not have this button.   One of the main reasons I use Traktor, they on form when it comes to effects."

Beatmatch,3dn577,Tastygroove,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, the turntable signal needs to be amplified before hitting the effects pedal.  It would be ideal to run it through an effect send/return, but I don't think the 350 has that.    Another thing you could try is to get a cheap standalone phono preamp and run the turntable there and then run it into the pedal and into the line in on your mixer, but you'd be running the effect before the eq which can lead to some cool results, but I've always preferred to eq before the effects for more control over sound shaping)"

I typically will find a point that I like, check the 8 bar phrase using a 8 bar loop to find the relative size (it's a double check, you can usually read the waveform to find the general size of a phrase in a track), and then drop in as neccessary. So if I know that a buildup in a track is 16 bars (2 x 8 bar loops) then I will plan accordingly on the incoming track and have my cue for the other buildup at the same point.

You already know that cueing up the incoming track from 8 bars before the drop is right so why not set a hot cue so you don't have to wind it back every time!?  What I do though is set the marker 16 bars before the drop so I give myself 8 bars to get it in time and 8 bars to bring up the next track and EQ/FX.

Beatmatch,3djfn7,Alvarny,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to drop a track like that in the middle of my set I will use it as a drastic energy shift. So, for example, I'll have any tempo track, it doesn't really matter, with the same kind of outro as the incoming track's intro. So there shouldn't be a lot of drums or rhythm, but flowing pads and maybe vocal samples would be ideal.  When the outro hits I just start the second track and let them kind of naturally cross over themselves. If the intro of the incoming track is 32 beats I'd try and make the outro of the previous track last a little longer or shorter if needed using loops, so the songs feel like they naturally transition.  If you're using Traktor you can run a delay on the previous track and increase the D/W to 100%. It gets really chaotic and noisy, but if you stop the first track from playing and play the second one the tempo will automatically sync, which can lend itself to really interesting transitions."
Beatmatch,3djfn7,brokenstack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Couple of questions though if you don't mind: * When using the song as a drastic energy shift, do you follow that up with a song of the same bpm range(really don't have that much that high up) and keep it going or do you drop it to the prior level again? * I don't really understand the last part. How does the tempo automatically sync in that scenario and doesn't that negate the energy shift effect?"
Beatmatch,3djfn7,brokenstack,2,Thu Jul 16 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"Q1: It depends. There are a lot of variables, but I'll give you an example: You have been ramping up energy for a while, right? Started at 130, built it up to 150, the crowd is getting tired, you can see it, but you want to hit them with something awesome before bringing it back down. You pick a track at 150BPM, that has a long tail of an outro. You bring in the 165BPM track with a long fade in, so the crowd has 30 seconds to a minute to catch their breath, but then BOOM, huge beats.  When the track is over you bring it back down, maybe with a drastic shift to 125 and have the crowd go get some drinks, catch their breath, let the adrenaline amp up for the next flow, and get those people on the floor that don't dance to heavy stuff. Just an example.  Q2: Traktor syncs its beat effects (like Delay) to the master clock. So if you have the Delay going, and the track that has the effect on it stopped, the sounds will keep coming. You play the second track and the master tempo instantly changes, and the delay tail changes to match it and automatically sync. This can be used to do very drastic tempo changes with a little more subtlety since there isn't a steady 4/4 kick drum, and instead the organized chaos of the delay effect. It doesn't negate the energy shift, it can actually enhance it because the chaos can cause a whole bunch of tension. But it works different based on the individual situation."

Beatmatch,3dern9,cortezfantastic,20,Wed Jul 15 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"I just went to a wedding on Saturday and was treated to a dude running Virtual DJ with a mouse, not even mixing...not even crossfading. Just one song after another through the headphone jack.   However, the song selection was on point and the dancefloor was packed the whole night. Everybody loved this guy. It blew my mind. I have been to a ton of weddings and done about 60 myself...I can say I'd never seen anything like it. But it makes sense.  My point is, people don't REALLY care how you're playing the music, as long as you're playing stuff they like, can sing to, and can dance to.  Call the venue and tell them what you're bringing. Talk through what else you need to get. If they have a sound system, they should provide a mic. How else can the best man and drunk uncle make a toast?  Are you making announcements too? Like ""Now they're going to cut the cake."" ""Now they're going to do their first dance."" ""Now the bride will dance with her father.""... If so, get the couple to send you a timeline so you know when to announce certain things.  That list is fine but I'd throw a 2-3 slow songs in too (Eric Clapton - Wonderful Tonight; Righteous Brothers - Unchained Melody; John Legend - All of Me). You're only going to play about 50-60 songs so choose wisely. If it were me I would just start at number 60 on that list and work backwards to 1 with a few slow songs along the way.   Make sure you ask the bride and groom what songs they want to hear too, work that into your playlist.   It's no sweat.  Edit: If VDJ mouse guy lurks Reddit, I'm not dogging you.

I still take it to some gigs, but not to weddings. There are so many activities going on at receptions that no one seemed to care about my mixing. All they cared about was that the night's pacing is correct and that good, danceable songs were played when the activities were done. I also have s large lighting setup which is cool, but the music is what's key. I attended an extremely fancy reception last Friday where the father of the bride was a celebrity. That DJ was auto-mixing, but the floor was packed all night, and Facebook blew up the next day about what a fun party it was, and I agreed.

Make sure you have enough extension cords and a power strip with enough outlets for all your gear. For lighting, party city or target or wallmart might have some strobe lights and crap party lights but they will be super over priced. However I'm pretty sure you can rent lights as well, but they might be useless if you don't know how to use them. As for songs I think its easier to ask the couple what songs they absolutely don't want then to find every song they do want. Ask them though if they have any songs they absolutely must hear like songs that have very special significance. Other than that they are your friends so you should know their music taste well enough. Play lots of top 40 songs throughout the ages to keep the youngest to the oldest guest dancing. Goodluck mate!

Yes, you could build a somewhat technically comparable solution with a Mini instead of a Macbook, but the Mini lacks several things right off the bat: an uninterruptible power supply, a screen, a keyboard and a mouse. Plus, Minis heat up very fast and, AFAIK, the Mini doesn't have a sudden motion sensor (SMS) to protect it's hard drive from damage due to vibration and sudden movement.  Performance-wise, a high-end MBP will leave the most powerful Mini in the dust, but a stock Mini, even a dual-core version, should be enough to run standard DJ packages.  Personally, I'd go with a laptop, but that's just me. A Laptop is good to go out of the box and you can remove it to store it safely when not in use. A Mini needs a laundry list of add-ons to be ready to work. For offline (not connected to the decks) work and set preparation you can take the laptop with you and all you need is a set of cans to prepare your set. With a Mini, well... you get the drill."

It's like Spotify but I prefer it because I live in a Google ecosystem with Android phones, Chromecasts, and so on. It has really good related music auto playlist generation: You find a song or artist you really like and hit the ""Start Radio"" button and it will start playing similar music... As you thumb stuff up and down it starts to learn even more about your tastes.  As I am listening, if a song catches my attention I add it to a ""to buy later"" playlist. Once a week or so I go through that playlist and remove anything that is not as good as I thought it was when I first listened to it and buy the rest. Rinse and repeat.  For example, one day I was listening to one of their radio stations in the ""driving home from work"" section and Fort Knox Five - Once Again caught my attention so I hit the start radio button on it and found over 80 similar contemporary Funk tracks that I wound up buying.   Their library has everything; Go to the artist page for Jay Lumen and hit start radio and you'll get a playlist of Techno, go to the artist page for Missy Elliot and hit start radio and you'll get a playlist of 90s/early-00s hip-hop dominated by female artists like so: http://i.imgur.com/VQpDLRk.png.  They also have shit tons of genre / situation based stations... Stations for driving, working out, lounging by the pool and so on...

If you want a 4 deck console go DDJ-SX2.  The SR has a very similar feel to the SX and has a very similar high quality build. Everything feels top notch. If you spend a little less on the controller, you can put the money towards some other stuff too. For example, an SR plus a flight case will cost around as much as the SX by itself."

If you really want quality then im afraid you will need to pay for it. I DJ and only buy uncompressed WAV files as although they are a little more expensive than MP3s, MP3 quality is 320kbps whereas WAVs are around 1440kbps so its quite a big difference!

Beatmatch,3daeov,_Hadek,5,Tue Jul 14 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"I've been doing a lot of experimenting with metal and EDM, and needless to say it's been a bit of an uphill battle. The biggest thing I've found to be of use are your song selections, background elements in those songs,  really careful loops, and being really on the ball with what key the song is. Metal is a bitch because of the varied time signatures, and the heavy compression that the music goes though. That's why I'm in the process of realizing that production may be the way to go in terms of getting the metal sound into EDM.   My token advice:  -Song selection is key. Once you accept that some songs are simply not going to work properly, be it for a slightly off drummer, or wonky key signature, it gets a bit easier.   -Utilizing background elements in those songs can really be your In in terms of mixing, most notably focusing on the added electronic elements that some bands use. Songs like The Game by Disturbed, or Digital World by Amaranthe have parts that are computer programmed, which are more consistently able to be looped, and work better to get in and out of. I usually mark those spots with cue points, and spam the hell out of them.   I've been working with a lot of dubstep and metal, since the sounds and feel of the genres tend to complement each other.  Look into KoRn's dubstep inspired album, Destroid, and Kill The Noise for the electronic side of things, and Disturbed, Rob Zombie, Bring Me The Horizon as good platforms for metal. At least, that's what I'm in the process of playing with."

The closest you can get is to toggle the Deck Layout to minimal, which hides the Phase Meter.  To map this, you can use the   Add In -> Deck Common -> Deck Size Selector  ...which requires you to press that key or button a few times to cycle between the available deck options.  The easier altnerative might just be to have a layout view with the decks minimised, and switch layouts with a mapping for the Layout Selector with:  Add In -> Layout -> Layout Selector  ...which lets you toggle between the available layouts. So long as you minimise the decks in one layout, then the Phase Meter will be hidden in that layout."

Then try to mix for 90 minutes with your new music and practicing new things you're learning. Record your mix and listen back to them the fallowing day. Decide what you like, what worked and what doesn't. Do this 4-5 days a week and you'll be well on your way to mixing after a few months.   Being a great DJ requires an unhealthy obsession with music.

I do use my ears, however I am just trying to establish an idea of percentage increases and decreases so i will know in my head before even playing the track roughly how much it needs to be adjusted. Thus making beat-matching tracks quicker and more accurate as less adjustment by myself is needed. Rough beat matching to transition between tracks is simple however if you wish to do long, drawn out blends (which I do) without having to frequently jog tracks into time the more accurate I can be the better. I trust my ears but I also trust mathematical fact. Thank you for your input though regardless.."

A few listens in the headphones should tell you whether something is faster or slower and experience will tell you how much.   Worrying about Bpm in relation to pitch sliders isn't really necessary and won't save you time if you're in a situation where there are no Bpm readouts or they are inaccurate.  Because it's a percentage, the distance between a Bpm at 135 Bpm will be different when you're playing a track at 90 Bpm."

So, if you wanted to connect a 128 BPM track with a 135BPM track and have them meet in the middle you'd want to increase the 128BPM track by around ~2.4% (1.56BPM) and lower the 135BPM track by 3% (~4BPM) and they both meet around 131BPM.

Also, sing the acapella you're going to mix in over the top of the track/beat you're going to be mixing it with - you can do this in your head, so you don't have to do it out loud, lol. That will help you figure out the approximate initial tempo and it'll also help you figure out how the acapella will fit over the beat as the first word of the acapella may not necessarily drop on the 1.  Don't worry about the phrase matching or any other aspects of mixing. Just focus on beatmatching. It doesn't matter if you have to pitch a song up so high that it sounds kinda silly - you're not trying to make an awesome mix - you're just practicing one particular skill. Once you get reasonably fast and accurate with beatmatching, you can work on the other skills and then bring them all together. I know you're not new to DJing, but that's an important tip for new DJs that want to learn to beatmatch manually, as trying to do everything at once can be overwhelming as you feel like you suck at everything (and you will suck at everything to begin with, lol).  Practice monitoring for, and correcting drifts. Practice using solely the pitch slider for this, because even though there are other ways to do it that work well, having great pitch slider control helps a lot. For instance, let's say you've beatmatched a track and the pitch slider is at +2. You bring the track into the mix, but it starts to fall behind a little. What you would do is move the pitch slider up so that the track catches up, then immediately drop the pitch slider back down to just above +2, as you know that +2 was a touch too slow. Over time you'll develop an instinct for how far to move the pitch slider up or down to correct the drift, and where to place the pitch slider after correcting it. By making these minor adjustments you are constantly honing in on the perfect place for the slider to be and you'll be able to hold blends indefinitely.  If it's not going well, re-cue and start over. This is easy these days as you can just use a cue button and tap it to re-cue the track perfectly on beat.   Don't get disheartened! Despite what some people might say, it usually takes a lot of practice to become fast and accurate at beatmatching to the point where your transitions sound super-tight, especially if you're not just quick mixing from one track to another and only overlapping a few bars of each song. When you have things like sync and visual aids you can use, it can be easy to give up and go back to using those - don't! :D"

Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:13:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, no problem man! Keep at it and you'll get there. Every DJ that's learned to beatmatch manually goes through these struggles."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,thefapper1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:25:56 2015 UTC,"When learning to beatmatch do you think its better to focus on one particular method eg) pitch riding vs spinning the platter and adjusting the pitch.  I've been learning to beatmatch by pitch riding the last little while but its taking me forever to beatmatch with speed.  I don't see how it would be possible to use pitch riding when I need to make transitions in a short amount of time such, I'm talking like 1 minute or less between songs."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"Having solid pitch control is very important, but you definitely shouldn't restrict yourself to that. Pushing/winding the record/platter, brushing your finger on the record or edge of the platter, twisting the spindle etc. are all valid ways to help you get one track lined up with another.  When you're beatmatching in your headphones, it really doesn't matter how you do it. For example, if you start beatmatching and you're like ""woah, this is way too slow"", you might give the platter/record a shove forwards with one hand while moving the pitch up with the other, which can be quicker than just moving the pitch slider up and waiting for the track to catch up.  Once you've learned the ins and outs of all of these methods, you'll know which is appropriate to use in certain situations, as obviously once the mix has gone live, if you've dropped a track in slightly out of time or the tracks start drifting apart, you want to correct that as quickly and seamlessly as you can, while when you're beatmatching in your headphones only you can hear it and the ""seamless"" part really doesn't matter."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,thefapper1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I remember hearing that riding the pitch is better as a beatmatching technique for genres longer blends like you find in trance.  With that said, do you think its an appropriate method for genres where you make quick transitions like in trap where you have less time to beatmatch two tracks?"
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I think it's an appropriate method for mixing any genres. With shorter blends, if you're only a tiny fraction out with the pitch then you can often get away with it, as the tracks aren't playing for long enough to drift apart to the point where it starts to become noticeable, but the better you are at riding the pitch and using the other techniques that are involved with beatmatching, the tighter your mixing will be, no matter what the genre is.  If your favourite genre is trap, it's worthwhile practicing longer blends, even if you wouldn't do long blends like that at a gig or in a mix, just so you can hone your pitch riding skills. You never know what genres of music you might get into in the future, but if you get good at beatmatching to the point where you can do short blends, super long blends, or anywhere in between, you'll be good no matter what."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,thefapper1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:11 2015 UTC,Thanks!  One more question for you.  I've read other DJs who say that learning to pitch ride on cdjs or controllers (I use a controller) is very difficult because the feel of the pitch fader is different than turntables.  Basically they were saying that if you are using cdjs or a controller its not worth it to pitch ride to beatmatch and use the platter method instead.  Would you agree with that or are these djs just trying to justify their inability to beatmatch by pitch riding on newer tech lol.
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:29:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly couldn't say. I have very limited experience with controllers. All I would say is, experiment and practice the different techniques (and for a decent amount of time) and see how well they translate over to your particular controller."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,thefapper1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:33:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  Thanks for answering my questions dude, appreciate it."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:35:07 2015 UTC,No worries!
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,Spacework,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:36:32 2015 UTC,What are the other ways to deal with drift? Or do you just get a few for it with the fader?
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,2,Wed Jul 15 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"There's 3 situations you'll typically have to deal with: -   You have the pitch set correctly, but you've dropped the track in a little out of time, so right from the beginning the 2 songs aren't in line. You don't have the pitch set correctly, but you drop the track in accurately. This is where the tracks would start off lined up, but then they'd drift apart over time. You don't have the pitch set correctly, nor do you drop the track in accurately, so you have a bit more work to do here.   How you deal with these situations depends on your preferred methods and your equipment. For example, if you're using vinyl, you can pinch or twist the spindle to either slightly slow down or speed up the record. You might brush your finger gently on the edge of the platter to slow it down, or gently push your finger on the edge of the platter to momentarily speed it up. You can brush your finger on the top of the platter or the surface of the vinyl, or give either one a little push. All of these techniques can be done with finesse, or, if you're beatmatching in your headphones and you need to make a large adjustment, you can quickly do that too as nobody is going to hear it but you. Obviously, you can also make adjustments using the pitch sliders too.  So, let's say that I've beatmatched the track in my headphones and I feel that it's good to go. I'm all set up ready to mix it in, but when I mix it in, I drop the track in a little out of time and it's behind the other track. I might give the platter/record just a delicate little push to nudge it into line, but I wouldn't touch the pitch slider at that point as I've already done the beatmatching in my headphones and I know it's good - obviously I would still be constantly listening for signs of the tracks drifting apart, and I'd make minor adjustments if necessary.  It's something you get a feel for over time. Some people use only the pitch slider because they haven't developed a lot of finesse when it comes to using the other methods, so they think that if they touch the platter, for example, there will be this massively noticeable change that the crowd will hear, but that doesn't have to be the case at all.  I don't think there's any real right or wrong. If you can mix well with just the pitch sliders and that works for you every time, that's great, but I think people should experiment with all the different techniques to find what works for them, rather than writing something off just because someone online said ""no, you shouldn't do that!""."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,Spacework,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great reply. I have a mixtrack pro II that I use with tracktor. I've been trying to mostly use pitch faders and am getting the hang of it. I need to cover the BPM read outs and just drop tracks in and stop looking to confirm what my ears are hearing, gotta learn to trust them. More tutorials videos would also help I'd bet. I think a buddy is going to give a bit of mentoring too. Also may borrow a SL1200 to go with mine and play only those for awhile. I think I'm going the right direction."
Beatmatch,3d8lrv,SigmaTheDJ,2,Wed Jul 15 20:38:04 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going the right direction.   If you're practicing, then you are. :)  I love technology, but it's great to get to that stage where you can DJ without it replacing a skill you've not learned, should you ever choose to. You'll get there.  Having not used many controllers, it's hard to say how well any of my advice translates to them. For example, the platter of a regular turntable is big and has a fair bit of weight to it, which allows you to make very subtle adjustments by touching it or brushing your finger against it. That may not be true (or as true) with controllers that have smaller and much lighter platters, as even if you're trying to develop some finesse, you might find that your gentle touch is still a bit too heavy handed. You'll figure out what does and doesn't work through experimentation though."

Lots of people here like to tell you that it doesn't matter what you use and all that matters is what comes out of the speaker.    But in the real world, people have prejudices and people in power doing the bookings or vouching for you for a spot will also have their prejudices.

Beatmatch,3d6o20,Flabbagazta,4,Mon Jul 13 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"it really depends on where you are, what you like to play, and what type of gigs you intend on getting.  Traktor in North America isn't really the industry standard for DVS club installs due to the fact that you have to pay for the software to use whereas serato boxes tend to already be at clubs because the software is free.    Traktor lends itself better to showcase or ""EDM"" sets where you're fine with bringing your own gear (be it controller or box) and the promoters/club is fine with you moving their shit around to use your gear.  Honestly, the best thing to do if you're a controller guy is get a serato-enabled controller (like the DDJ SX) and then grab a copy of Traktor - then you have both software options available to try out."

Beatmatch,3d6o20,Sabzzy,3,Tue Jul 14 06:53:25 2015 UTC,only if you buy a controller that requires the paid license.  There are a number of controllers and all the Rane hardware that doesn't require a paid license.
Beatmatch,3d6o20,_Be_,3,Tue Jul 14 08:13:19 2015 UTC,"Except you still need a license to use traktor regardless.  With some of the hardware that is fully serato enabled, you don't need a license and you don't need to own the hardware.  You can just download the software and use it with any device that supports the plug and play.  So you could not own a single piece of serato gear, download the software at the gig, plug into a rane sl4, and start playing."
Beatmatch,3d6o20,tofferl,2,Tue Jul 14 08:36:06 2015 UTC,"I feel a lot of people jump on this and think there's a stigma against it but a lot of it comes down to what is standard in clubs and in the end, the club makes the decision to hire you or not.  In this case they shouldn't have been giving you stiff at a BBQ cause there is no pressure to have a certain set up as long as there is a set up but when it comes to clubs you have to consider that clubs have standard set ups to avoid any issues with continuity and familiarity and the club owner and DJs do not like it when you mess around with the set up as it can fuck with the continuity.

Beatmatch,3d7vgf,tmccoy00,3,Tue Jul 14 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"Headphones are fairly essential and you can stick with whatever you have initially. However this is a really good place to invest some money now if you dont have a good over-ear pair that has good isolation.   Speakers are not essential but will let you enjoy the music in the room and not be bound to headphones. You can use anything from your existing PC speakers or a home hifi - or stretch to even entry level monitors. I have a pair of MAUDIO BX5D2 and they have been a great entry level set.  Beyond that, you'll just need a few cables to hook it all up and once you get your head into it, you'll start to understand what other cables and gear you'll need for gigging."
Beatmatch,3d7vgf,_Be_,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"You also need a sound card, which both of those controllers include.

Beatmatch,3d7vgf,_Be_,2,Tue Jul 14 06:22:42 2015 UTC,You can get a non-pro version of a Mixtrack for $100 less than the Pro editions. The only difference is that the Pro ones have a built in sound card. You can put that $100 towards a really good stand alone sound card.
Beatmatch,3d7vgf,tmccoy00,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:25 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend this as the soundcards in even the entry level controllers are more than good enough. A second soundcard means another USB and maybe power supply and more hasssle.  $400+ Pro soundcards have their place for DVS users or specific setups.
Beatmatch,3d7vgf,_Be_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think combining multiple devices into one, whether it's router+modem or controller+sound card, is more hassle in the long run. If one part breaks, at best you have dead weight and at worst you have to buy both again. From reviews I have read/watched, sound cards integrated into controllers without separate power supplies tend to be quiet. There are good stand alone 4-output sound cards for under $400. They tend to be marketed for home recording studios rather than DJs, but they'll work and may sound better.  But really, either way will work for DJing."

Beatmatch,3d7vgf,miladmaaan,3,Tue Jul 14 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"I learned to dj using the free trial of traktor scratch pro 2 and a keyboard and mouse. It's a bitch at first (and always), but its free, and once you can manage using just keyboard shortcuts and a mouse, nab a controller and it'll be smooth sailing. I recorded my first mix this way after just 2-3 months of practicing. Ended up getting my first controller, a traktor s4 mk2, a year after I started, and haven't looked back.   You don't need ANY equipment to learn the basics. You'll have to use sync without the controller, but trying to learn to beatmatch without knowing how to phrase your tracks, or even PICK two tracks that mix well together, is not the most optimal path to learning to dj in my opinion.   You can download traktor pro 2 for free off of the internet, the only limitation is that every 30 minutes you need to restart the program, which is not that big of a deal when you first start off since you can't go 30 minutes straight anyway.   I'd personally recommend traktor for the software and controllers. They're just so damn fun to use and user friendly. I'm about to start making the transition to CDJs on my 3rd year, and I gotta say that traktor prepared me well."

Beatmatch,3d7vgf,Drewskeet,3,Tue Jul 14 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"Serato. Traktor is a great software, but the sync will not allow you to come in off beat and affects are different.  I have friends that really miss the affects from traktor when they use cdjs.  This is is more about getting you comfortable with a club setup. Not getting g used to tools you won't have at your figure tips in a club scenario."

Beatmatch,3d7vgf,Dantejb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying controller and with your budget its probably good advice.  Seriously though, if you can learn on cdjs you will be forever grateful.  Trust me. Most importantly. Screw around. Take risks. Have fun.  DJing is a lot of fun. Remember it's an art form and respect those around you.  Don't get a big ego. Everyone is a DJ today.  Just do you. Make your own sound.  Play what you want to hear."

Beatmatch,3d7vgf,_Be_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"A quick peek at Craigslist in my area (Chicago) says otherwise. You could maybe get a single used CDJ for $300. Also, you'd need an analog mixer in addition to the CDJs."
Beatmatch,3d7vgf,Drewskeet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:33 2015 UTC,Is there a difference from cdj and other forms?
Beatmatch,3d64ls,NerdyNThick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:30 2015 UTC,It'd probably be more popular with producers than DJs. Why spend twice the price of a normal controller to get half the features?
Beatmatch,3d64ls,Dantejb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see no reason to get these over an APC 20 or Launchpad Pro."

Beatmatch,3d64ls,Sniktsnakt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be concerned about it potentially falling apart in the middle of a performance. And setting it up could be a hassle. It seems more appropriate for users who would set it up and leave it at desk rather than travel with it. It doesn't seem like it's USB MIDI class compliant either, which means limited compatibility and possibly PITA drivers.  Also, for those prices, the flexibility is not useful. How many useful ways are there to arrange that few controls?"

Beatmatch,3d50xt,sleetx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:10 2015 UTC,Honestly pretty much anything above a certain price range will be enough. $1500 is more than enough. Just make sure you've got 8GB RAM and at least dual core cpu. Solid state drive might be useful depending how you store your music.
Beatmatch,3d50xt,hondajvx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"It's not bad specs that cause problems. my stationary has really good specs and works fine with ableton and lots of plug ins, but somehow traktor still won't work. maybe i just had bad luck with the compatibility between the two. i really don't want to spend much money on a laptop that is not suited for traktor, that's all.

Beatmatch,3d6dr3,Mongoloid07,3,Mon Jul 13 21:47:37 2015 UTC,Download Mixxx or a trial of Virtual DJ and mess around a bit to get a feel for what's going on before investing in a physical controller.  Best case you love it and then do some research and invest in a beginner piece of equipment.  Worst case you find it's not for you and you move on without losing any bills over it.
Beatmatch,3d6dr3,dhy615,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:54:20 2015 UTC,Well it really depends on what you're willing to spend.. what's your price range?
Beatmatch,3d6dr3,deVally,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"Umm, depends a lot. Me and a friend could split it, if its a piece of kit I wouldn't use at any point after learning the basics or getting a feel for it, 150ish, if its something I could split with a friend and use for a year or two while I learn, 3-400ish, (all figures in £)"
Beatmatch,3d490p,scalyfishman,2,Mon Jul 13 11:58:19 2015 UTC,In your budget have a look at the KRK Rokit series which are arguably the most popular reference monitors for DJs. You'll definitely be able to pick up either the Rokit 5s or Rokit 6s in your price range.
Beatmatch,3d490p,Mr_RD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:59 2015 UTC,Rokit series are around the £250 mark :( Any idea what the Mackies are like?

Beatmatch,3d490p,sleetx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yamaha HS50, Mackie MR5 MK3, KRK Rokit 5 are all decent monitors in your price range. Check out an audio store and give them each a demo."
Beatmatch,3d490p,tilldrop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"I like the look of the Yamaha for its 8"" woofer. Does woofer size make a big difference? Like say if I was comparing 8"" rokits to 5"" rokits..."
Beatmatch,3d490p,sleetx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"Yes. They sound rather different. Also since that's how physics works 8"" woofers will go lower and probably louder. This does not mean that the bigger, the better. It's also a question of room treatment and room size for production.  I'd not recommend KRK Rokits. I got them and had I known how colored they are...  You still don't mix nor master music when DJing, but that's just my two cents."
Beatmatch,3d490p,thewebsiteguy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:02:54 2015 UTC,"If you buy 8"" monitors you probably won't need a separate subwoofer. That size speaker is mostly meant for larger rooms. If you're playing in a small bedroom you're probably better off with the 5"" and should consider getting a separate subwoofer if you want the extra bass (again, depends on how you feel the monitors are performing).   Personally I've got the 5"" Mackie's without a subwoofer since I'm in a smaller room and it works great. Very clear sound without getting muddied by too much bass. From my comparison at the audio store, the Yamaha's didnt give as great a performamce overall, it was a little tipped to the high end for my liking. Rokit's were good but tried to compensate for the low end a bit too much."
Beatmatch,3d490p,jamberjong,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:44:07 2015 UTC,I would personally recommend the M-Audio BX5a Deluxes. I have used the KRK Rokit Series as well and I just dont think the clarity is as good. I currently use the Adam A5X's which I absolutely love.
Beatmatch,3d490p,tilldrop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:50:51 2015 UTC,Can't find the M-Audios in the UK easily any more. I think they have been discontinued. Can only see the BX5 D2 which is obviously just a newer version of the same thing. Those Adams look nice tho :P

For the inconsistency in the sound levels, I noticed that after the fact as well, I'm still getting used to my sx2 and a small change in the gain knob makes a big change in the sound level apparently.

Beatmatch,3d3j4g,hydrotacular,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat I think you should have the gain knob a little higher to start, just because I had to crank my system to be able to hear it at the beginning. I also had this problem when I started, and I just changed the recording gain and everything was good. Transitions were solid, I think Trap Queen came in smidgen off and then transitioning out seemed a little rough as well. Overall the track selection was nice, and I'm not sure if it's what you were intending but it was pretty relaxed and I enjoyed it! Nice work man"

Everything was in the orange but it still came off as too quiet.  Thanks for the rest of the feedback.  Yes I was going for the relaxed vibe to suit the event I was playing this mix out at, glad you liked it!  I will try and get to your mix later today."

I don't know who your influences are, but it sounds a lot like a Skrillex or Diplo mix. I even recognized a few songs from the Jack U NYE show.  I'm a total newbie, literally have made one real mix and have been doing it about three months, so I can't give a ton of technical feedback, but I can say the pacing was pretty good. It may be nice to slow it down a bit at a few points, i felt overwhelmed a few times. I would also point out that 99% of the transitions were straight fire. The transition into YALA made my head explode. The only one i really wasn't a fan of was the Trap Queen transition. I think it wasn't phased correctly or something similar. But all in all it was awesome man, keep up the good work!  Edit: If you get some free time I'd love a tracklist. I want to incorporate a few of these songs into my mixes."

Some of your transitions could have been better though if you hi-pass filtered out, or low pass. It's super easy to do and sounds amazing with just a little practice. Let's you get away with a ton. Other than that I would check out Phrasing and how that could improve your transitions."

Beatmatch,3d3j4g,Dantejb,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:54 2015 UTC,"Meh mix. Too much effects use, and you butchered the transition into and out of Hello. Please, don't scratch if you don't know how. Save yourself the embarrassment of getting put into your place for faking it. After Hello, I Don't Like it sounds like a youtube rip. You didn't even transition out of it, and you killed the song after that with effects. You gotta use em' tastefully. If somebody plays 40 progressive house songs back to back, the energy and power of them is lost. Same goes for effects. Don't just fuck with a song to fuck with it. Fuck with it because it'll make it sound better. Your phrasing was off on the transition after, and the loop rolls and effects really killed the mood on that song. The looping you did out also really didn't work. More fake scratching after shake it off.  Did you actually transition any of these songs, because it definitely sounds like you didn't transition any of these songs for more than 4 bars?  TL;DR  Too many effects, too much fake scratching, not enough real transitioning, and no flow. Just goes to show that you can have pro gear and still not sound pro if you don't know how to use it.   I would honestly look into the basics of transitions, phrasing, beatmatching, and tasteful effects usage. You got a way to go before you're ready to do gigs. Sorry if I sound harsh, but I really didn't like that mix as a DJ or listener."
Beatmatch,3d3j4g,newblink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"Hi Dantejb,  Thanks for taking the time to listen and to write this, although harsh, I appreciate the honesty. I agree with a lot of your points, and there is definitely some overkill with the effects for sure.   I think part of my big problem with the transitions is that I was improvising the set list as I was going on which left a lot of room for error and sloppy transitions...I'm totally not at the point where I can do this without a pre-set playlist. I really tried to transition the songs based on tonal centers of keys/ harmonies, but I need to explore the different types of transitions way more.   Are there any mixes you would suggest to check out specifically regarding good transitions? Thanks again-"

Beatmatch,3d3j4g,Flstandantilus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"Hi mixloud (clever name), right off I noticed a litttle horse trotting on some of your early transitions. Since you do use traktor, if your beat grids are on point there's a tiny orange indicator above the wave forms that'll tell you when things are off. Case in point around 8:25 but that sounds like your phrasing was off. Other than that I would focus a bit more on eqing as it sounds like your hi's are clashing, and keep mixing! :)"

Beatmatch,3d3j4g,Oremm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:36 2015 UTC,"If the incoming track is a little too fast, jog backwards.  If it's a little too slow, jog forwards.  This will make the ""sync"" indicator above the waveform slide out from the center - but trust your ears, not the software."

To prevent the highs clashing, should I swap the HIs just like i do with the basses? and in your very honest opinion, how would you say this mix is (solid, poor, good etc.)"
Beatmatch,3d3j4g,Flstandantilus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:11 2015 UTC,"I would experiment and see what works! For me, I tend to turn the incoming track's hi's and mid's around 10 o'clock so I can 'hide' it in the main track. As soon as I get to a point where I can safely bring up the incoming track then I do so. Also, I think it's a good start! What you're playing is pretty formulaic so once you get your phrasing down it'll be really easy and you can learn from there."

I've only gotten feedback from close friends who pretty much say the same thing about them all, so I'm looking for some outside feedback.

Beatmatch,3d3j4g,thefapper1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:05:04 2015 UTC,"Loved the song selection, your track selection is on point.  Here's some overall feedback:  Few trouble spots with transitions, for instance, ""High you are"" to ""Say my name"", it was just the wrong spot to do a transition, vocals over vocals usually ends up with a lot of clashing and sound messy.    Are you mixing in key?  There seems to be some transitions that sound like the keys of the two tracks are off making the transitions not as smooth as they could be.  How much EQing are you doing?  I think making more use of the EQs would also help make your transitions smoother.  On some of the transitions the incoming track is coming in too strong over powering the outgoing one too early.  EQing will also help minimize clashing when transitioning.  Transition between ""Party Girls"" and ""Higher Ground"" was pretty wonky, don't know what happened there.  Things started to sound a lot tighter when you started mixing future house, is that what you are more used to mixing?  How long have you been mixing for?"
Beatmatch,3d3j4g,hydrotacular,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for listening!  High you are -> Say my name, both songs that are personal favorites of mine.  So when I mix them, even though I know vocal over vocal is generally bad, it still kind of clicks for me. But I'm glad to hear the feedback.  I'm not mixing in key. At least, not that I know of. I've always tried to just use feel and by learning my music just kind of know what works together. And I feel like knowing the key while obviously has a ton of positives; it would lock me into a box creatively. But I'm not against it if I can find a way to get it for all of my songs (can't justify MiK at this point)  Just recently I've started doing a LOT more EQing, but I'm still working on it. An example is when I start to bring in Talking Body, while I tried to keep the kids very high and the opposite mids low, I took too long so it's very hard to hear Talking Body come in unless you know it's coming. But I feel like I've got a ton to learn and work on when it comes to EQing.  Don't even get me started on that Higher Ground transition. I had gotten that song the day of and loved it, didn't really learn it and forced it in. I almost stopped recording because of it, but I liked what I had before that so I kept going. But yeah, just a rough mistake  I've been mixing since January. I've probably known what I've been doing since May though. Just recently hit that point where I feel confident mixing and feel pretty good about all genres, just have to refine my abilities now.

If you are keen on going by feel by all means keep working on it, it will probably take sometime to develop.  Just be aware during the process you are going to have mixes where the transitions don't work because the keys are clashing too much.

Beatmatch,3d3blx,JTownTX,2,Mon Jul 13 10:01:50 2015 UTC,"This was the event in question. It was an art show/ music event held in San Diego, CA. It was a sub-event of Comic Con that's called, ""Comic Conga"". It was the first annual & Comic Con attendees were allowed to go in for free. With that being said, and considering this was my first show, I was really nervous. I get there about half an hour before doors open and to my luck not much activity seemed to go on. As soon as I see the guy who booked me he tells me to start setting up because music needs to be playing ASAP. OK GAME ON! I start talking to the sounds guys and they are very helpful with me. All i had was my bedroom rca cables and he hooked it up with the amplifier cable? (not sure what it's called, connected to the back of my s4 and looks like a guitar cable). He asks me to hit play to test it out, I do, and it starts. Set is officially on apparently. It really eased my nerves that there wasn't so many people because I was opening. To be honest this isn't the crowd I was expecting either, but I still stuck to what I came to play since it's about the only thing I'm used to spinning (tech/deep/progressive house). In between my set i got cut off about 2 times for some art exhibits and sneak peeks of future cartoons (Saw the 1st episode of Bordertown, Seth Mcfarlane's 2016 show about 2 families living in a desert town in US/MEX border, which is crazy because that's exactly where I live, so I can relate). As soon as the exhibits were done it was my job to get the music started again. This was all improvised as they were telling me they would cut me off as it was happening and to be ready to put the music back on when presenters were done talking. I kept doing my thing until it was time for a live ska band to play (different genres in the show, after that a cumbia band played). Now although nobody was dancing (and at the moment made me feel insecure), I did see a head wobble here and there, and after the show received many props from people I didn't know & even got offered to play another show. I found it to be a success because it was a big learning experience. For my next time I shall be less nervous and more prepared (cables, more experience, etc.). I really can't wait :)."

Beatmatch,3d2ssi,tmccoy00,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"unless you want to scour for used gear, the minimum you'd want to spend on house party capable speakers (depending on size) would be around $600-$700.  These are your behringer eurolives and mackie thumps which aren't great, don't get very loud, and won't last very long, but will do the trick.  Basically:  Good quality / Cheap / Easy to find  Pick two."
Beatmatch,3d2ssi,djdementia,2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"Sure, for a free house party it's perfectly fine to use 2.1 Computer speakers.  Of course this depends on how many people.  A house party where dancing isn't a priority and ~ 25 people?  Then I'd go with Logitech Z623 PC speakers.  They will be plenty loud enough if dancing is not the main event of the party.  Of course if you are talking about a 200+ person practically 'block party' forget about it.  You need to rent gear.  And they need to pay you.  I've done a 30 person informal house party non paid on those speakers.  It went well.  http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-980-000402-Speaker-System-Black/dp/B003VAHYTG"

Other than that no, you don't need anything.  Some other stuff I'd recommend: a laptop stand I use this kind.  A surge strip (two would be great, try to get ones with USB chargers too so you can charge your phone), I use this one although it's only 3 outlets it has USB charging so you don't need USB chargers too and it swivels 360 degrees for weird placements.  Power Extension cable get one that the end lights up so you know that power is on.  I'd also get an electrical ground tester to make sure that your ground is good.  Also on the subject of grounding I'd highly recommend a ground hum isolator, this one is nice because it's a DI box too so that means it can take your unbalanced signal in and output a balanced signal.  That DI box is kind of an 'ultimate mobile DJ problem solver'.  It'll solve all your audio intput/output connections plus power problems in one unit.  Handy box for sure!"

In your situation I would say to make sure the places you intend on playing at already have a speaker system with some sort of auxiliary input.   Aside from that, all you need are your computer, mixer, and input cables, for a basic setup.  As for quality, I don't know about any ""enhancement"" tricks, but just keep in mind the music quality you download will be the music quality you put out. I know that's simple, but as the saying goes: poopy in, poopy out. You start with crap, you'll end up with crap.  Hope that helps"

Buying the music you DJ with is the best way to ensure you're playing high quality tunes. 320 MP3's will surely do the job if we're talking college parties. Also, make sure you confirm what type of inputs are available for use on the sound systems you'll be connecting to and bring the appropriate cables, and don't forget to make sure they're long enough."

My point was just that by buying them, it's safe to assume you're getting the quality thats advertised. You sometimes come across 320 downloads that have either been downloaded and reuploaded or something of that nature and you don't end up with a file that has been copied an unknown number of times.

Beatmatch,3cynm8,kawaikiwi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:45:01 2015 UTC,"Some things that come to mind that you might want to consider: are you going to be talking over the mix at all? Will you have different segments? ( I know some podcasts do a ""hot tracks of the week"" or whatever before the actual mix). Will you be doing guest mixes? If you are, will you have interviews? Will you have some sort of audio signature (like a catchphrase, or just the name of the podcast)? These are just some thoughts I had though, not sure the type of podcast you're going for.  As a bit of a side note, I'd be willing to do some editing and post production if you need help (I'm an audio engineer, and I'm just kind of bored lol), but it would help if you recorded any sort of voice overs separately.  Ninja edit: I'm also a DJ and a producer. Just thought that would add some insight into my point of view a bit more."

Perhaps with some of his own stuff thrown in?  Sorry for the complete newb questions but I honestly have no idea about how it all works.   I was in a tiny beachside bar in Barcelona recently, the DJ was playing some deep house and the place was packed, the look on his face when he was about to drop a beat and the place erupted gave me an intense natural high, it was incredible."
Beatmatch,3cxdhe,hatervision,7,Sat Jul 11 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"DJ's at most clubs will just be playing their own sets to get the energy going. 99.99% of the time, they haven't produced any of it.  However, if you go to a music festival or anything where there is a headlining DJ who also produces, you better believe they are dropping some of their own tracks. At least some of their remixes, bootlegs, or edits.  It is perfectly fine to DJ and not use any of your music, that's what most DJs do. However, many of the famous ones also produce, and it enables them to drop their own tracks."

For this reason, actually mixing in key with some of the techniques popular today instead of just going by ear is crazy hard without pitch lock, and basically entirely impractical unless you want to write down key info and bpm of all your tracks in a notebook and use a calculator and charts to make transitions. Which, good luck impressing a crowd doing that."

Beatmatch,3csaqi,brocuddlez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:55:06 2015 UTC,"We did it quite differently back when, essentially when figuring out the key of the track, choose a bpm and find the key of each tune using that bpm, regardless of where pitch is. Use a metronome so they are almost exact.  Two records in key at 130 will be in key at 125, will be in key at 132, and so on.   I've never looked into if this is 100% accurate/valid, but it sounded good enough before technology and this is still how I do it."
Beatmatch,3csaqi,inkosana,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's the thing, if you're mixing that way you can only choose records at exactly the same bpm.  If you wanted to mix between records of different BPM's, it'd start taking a lot of planning. For example, if you were playing a record that's 120bpm in the key of Am and I started running out of 120bpm records, I could select a 127bpm record in the key of F#m, slow it down ~6% which would bring the tempo to 120bpm and the key down one full step to Em, which would mix harmonically with the first record in Am.  So instead of just being able to pick tracks at 120, you could pick tracks at 120, 123, and 127."
Beatmatch,3csaqi,brocuddlez,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"Not really, kind of the opposite. I can only choose records of the same key, or the key I want to move to, regardless of bpm.

Beatmatch,3csaqi,copeybitcoin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:06:24 2015 UTC,though I'm no expert i find that going up or down 1 or 2 bpm on the incoming track doesn't make much difference if you slide the pitch to the value of the first track. i.e. a track at 119 that just needs nudging up to 120 will be fine if its the same key as the original track.

Beatmatch,3crdku,dj_soo,3,Fri Jul 10 05:46:42 2015 UTC,No.  Traktor and serato DVS requires proprietary sound cards to run.  Other programs like virtual dj and mixxx will allow you to run 3rd party soundcards.

Beatmatch,3crdku,endmass,2,Fri Jul 10 09:48:03 2015 UTC,"The CDs will be the least of your expenses. If you had CDJs that supported MIDI or HID over USB to control software, you'd still need a decent sound card to get the sound out of your computer. The Traktor Audio 2 DJ and a MIDI controller for mixing would be a good choice for that case. However, it doesn't look like the CDJ 800mk2 has a USB connection, so the only way to use them with a computer would be timecode. The cheap Behringer sound cards could work for this, but you get what you pay for (that said, there is significant variability in quality between sound cards in the low (~$100) and middle price ranges ($150-300), so read reviews). If you have a bad sound card, it does not matter much how good your mixer or speakers are. Since you are using CDJs and not vinyl, you can use any sound card with 4 line level inputs (2 stereo pairs); it does not have to be a sound card made for DVS with phono preamps. The cheapest sound card made for DVS, the Traktor Scratch A6 is in the same price range as middle-of-the-line 4-input sound cards made for recording. There are mixers with built in USB sound cards, but I don't think they'd be any cheaper than a stand alone USB sound card.  Mixxx is free software that works with several different types of time code and any sound card that your operating system supports. See the Mixxx wiki for a list of some suggested sound cards."

Beatmatch,3cq5zo,wild_out,9,Thu Jul 9 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of thoughts. First off many songs just can't be mixed together, for a variety of reasons: tempo, key, rhythms music all be similar. There's even more subtle things like swing and use of off beats that can make it difficult to make really mixing two songs together sound good even if they are in time.   For a lot of music its better to mix using the snares rather than the Kicks. Try using loops to give your self more time or cue points to keep getting back to a point in the song that will facilitate mixing.  IDK what you like to play, but it may be a good idea practice your beatmatching with simpler music. Straight 4 to the floor house is a good place to start, even if its not your cup of tea. Or try finding a mix you like and has good transitions, and then practice using the same songs you hear in the mix."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,GirtyGirty,2,Thu Jul 9 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I wouldn't want to use a loop because I feel like I shouldn't make the crowd listen to a loop just because I can't beatmatch on time.  Usually ""new"" progressive house is easy to beatmatch but some songs are not. For example: Zedd - Push Play. In the beginning it uses what sounds like a piano key and later a synth to mark the beats but I can't use that to beatmatch because it wouldn't create the ""galloping"" or phasing effect with the kick of another song."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,voeljediebass,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:06:09 2015 UTC,"The beginning with the piano keys is definitely suitable to beatmatch. You hear a key on every beat so that's 4/4 and should be all right if you put it on top of the beat of another track.  Like the post above mentions, it's good to focus on the snares (or claps or hi hats) when you beatmatch. I find those higher frequencies easier to distinguish than a kick drum. (edit: I find the Zedd piano intro much easier to distinguish than the kick drum at 1:00 min. If I had to use the part after 1 min I'd listen to the claps on every 2nd and 4th beat.)  Although most +/- 128 bpm 4/4 house is usually recommended, a track like that Zedd one is more like a radio edit structure-wise. The intro and actually all phrases are pretty short. You could try to practice with longer tracks with a 1 minute dj intro. Or loop the easiest part of the incoming track until you got it."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,hobbbz,6,Fri Jul 10 21:24:09 2015 UTC,Can you bob your head to the song? Even if it's an acapella section you should be able to catch the beat.
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,P_Wood,3,Fri Jul 10 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yup I can do that for any song. I'm not sure how I would use that to beatmatch though. I usually rely on hearing the ""galloping"" or phasing between kicks to beatmatch, like I said in another comment.   How can I use this to beatmatch?"
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,KrazyTrain18,2,Fri Jul 10 13:10:03 2015 UTC,"Because you can bob your head to the tempo of the song, therefore allowing you to beat match it. Tapping your foot might be another way to keep the tempo. If you haven't already, do a little bit of reading on measures and ""counting"" the beats"
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,schiffty1,4,Fri Jul 10 16:52:42 2015 UTC,Honestly I find the best way to beat match is to dance and really get into your set.  Otherwise it's tough to stay on beat in your head when your just standing there.
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,incandescentwound,2,Fri Jul 10 03:16:30 2015 UTC,This sounds like great advice. I usually focus really hard on just isolating the kicks in my head to hear the phasing.
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,psykik23,2,Fri Jul 10 13:12:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you can't beatmatch your transition, but you can run an effect such as an echo/delay/even a roll to add something to the outgoing song that you can use instead."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,voeljediebass,2,Thu Jul 9 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"I used to have the same issue also. I thought matching the snares would be more accurate which i feel it is (and isn't bad practice) though it's best to get to know the rhythms/bpm intuitively. This definitely various but perhaps listening with or without the headphones and away from your setup? Tap a tap tap away on your leg or move to the beat! Also there seems to be a mode of listening which seems to be too focused to hear both tracks well. For me specifically, I'll focus too much on listening to one track more than the other and kind of half perform a beat match. Try letting go of your focus on kicks."

Beatmatch,3cq5zo,nikolaprof,2,Fri Jul 10 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"I understand why it's hard to beatmatch to that Zedd track, the parts with a kick drum are very short. It's possible to beatmatch during the breaks but it takes practice. The track itself I short too, so you don't have much time to choose the next track if you want to beatmatch. The Strange Talk track uses are very generic 64 beat intro (almost 30 seconds long, I guess it's 128 bpm). Maybe try to sync both tracks and play the incoming one during the break and listen how it lines up."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,brokenstack,2,Fri Jul 10 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"Try and beatmatch with the snare/clap rather than the kick, especially if it's a 4/4 track  You'll be able to hear high frequencies much better in a party/club environment plus they're less frequent so you can get a good sense of timing. Between clap hits you can use the hi hats to fine tune."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,Sabzzy,2,Thu Jul 9 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"i found out what helped me was when i learned phrasing.  So electronic songs are broken down into 8 beats of 4, which is called one bar. and every new bar has a new instrument introduced or a change from intro to verse or chorus. So breaking a song down into these parts, you can beat match even without the 'beat"". Simply cue up your music to the right start and hit cue at the end of your song you want to mix out and you are ready to go."
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,Cubedarcher,2,Fri Jul 10 04:50:20 2015 UTC,Most of songs have a normal kick pattern -   kick kick kick kick - normal  Some other songs have a more creative kick pattern -   kick  kickkick  kick
Beatmatch,3cq5zo,Sabzzy,2,Fri Jul 10 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of this just comes down to practice. Any track with a steady rhythm (doesn't drift like with a live drummer) can be beatmatched. The mix might not sound good, depending on the songs, but if the tempo is steady you can lock the tempo.  It's just hard. And it takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged. As you listen to more music you'll be able to pick those pieces out and find the rhythm without really needing to hear the kick drum clearly. 6 months isn't very long in the scheme of things, and now you're hitting a wall with the more complicated stuff. You'll be fine, just keeping working."

The flipside of this is that I find that Google forms add a wall of separation between you and the listener. There's a fine balance that you can find but avoid going 'all in' on the Google forms just because I think it turns you into an overglorified jukebox.  To be honest I actually love when people come into the booth and talk to me. It allows patrons to get in touch with you and you also get an understanding of who you're playing for other than reading the crowd. There's also a sense of excitement when you see the patron's eyes light up if you drop the right request at the right time.  My workflow is: Google sheet for proms, etc. If I'm playing in a club I'll take requests on the fly."

Beatmatch,3cq42m,Alpine425,2,Thu Jul 9 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"For CDJs, I use two SanDisk Ultra Fit USB drives. They're small (which is both good and bad), they're $8.99 each, they're 16GB (although you can go up to 64 GB), and they're USB 3.0. Speed definitely matters - even with a fast drive and a small library, it takes a little while for the CDJ to load up all of your songs.  All of my songs are analyzed in Rekordbox. I set one cue point (press Cue and then Memory) at the mix-in point, the mix-out point, and at the loudest part of the song. This allows me to properly set the gain for the track. I also set hot cues A, B, and C on the same points. If you're not using a CDJ-2000 or XDJ-1000 (the only ones that have hot cues), you can still use the regular cues by using the arrows to skip to the one you want."

This one gets used for rekordbox (I use 4 usbs, all 64gb in case link cable breaks, loss of stick etc) and is also syncd with Dropbox for an off site backup.  I also have a small collection of outdated CDs for uber emergency's left at the club.  I also have a 8gb USB drive on my keys with ready made mixes and enough tunes to do a full set. The amount of times I saved another DJ who has not been prepared for a failure with that is crazy!!  USBs are fine. I use 64gb sticks with no issue."

It sets up a USB drive so you can boot any computer from it to DJ with Mixxx and the rest of the space on the drive is still accessible to CDJs. SD cards are not a good option because not all that many computers have SD card readers built in, but everything has USB. Capacity is up to you. How much music do you think you need for a back up? If you can afford it, another 2 TB USB hard drive would be best. You could bring one hard drive out with you and leave the other at home."

Beatmatch,3cn5j2,brokenstack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:09:34 2015 UTC,"Start building on your setup in different ways that fit your workflow. This requires a lot of experimentation. Serato has a lot of limitations, due to what Serato actually gives you access to for mapping, but add in a drum controller for the sampler. Use two turntables and a mixer, but add in an external controller for cue points and loops, effects and flips. Just keep building the set up in elegant ways to give you more access to features so you can set your mixing and style apart."

So either you are trolling or the habits of your family are kinda unusual.  Anyway, if she has been DJing on CDJs so far, why would you want to make her use a controller? Chances are she will hate it and only uses the controller, because she does not want to disappoint you. Kinda related story:  My dad had some Gameboy-like device that was only able to run a tetris-clone. He used to play with this thing whenever he took a shit. But one day it crashed and he was not able to fix it. Sad dad. So we got him a Gameboy and tetris. He only touched it twice, because it felt different than his old device.  With that being said, for a controller setup you will need:   Controller (you will also need an external sound card, if the controller does not have one built in) Laptop USB-cable (usually comes with the controller) Headphones Speakers Maybe some adapters (cinch to aux for example) Some mp3s"

OP would have been better off just buying her a new mixer and letting her keep going on the CDJ's.   Going from CDJ's to a controller + laptop + software combo can be pretty underwhelming.

Also, I'd advise against making this big of a shift in workflow before traveling for a gig. You might want to let her take her current system on Tuesday, but you can still give her the new gear and let her make the shift gradually after she returns.  It might be worth noting that with the traktor scratch upgrade, your mom can use her CDJs in tandem with the S4.   In any case, I hope it works out for the two of you.  GLHF"

Beatmatch,3cm2pm,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:53:33 2015 UTC,Yeah strangely the levels increase when enable a EQ Three without boosting or cutting anything. I think it has to do with those FreqLow and FreqHi knobs but I'm not sure.

Beatmatch,3cmjf5,Sabzzy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"So I just did my 2nd public event this past weekend, just at a friend's bbq, and I had about 6 hours to play. I definitely played 2 45-minute mixes, so that I could interact with folks and catch up with the birthday girl. Some randoms not even at our party came up to me and asked for my card (presumably they liked the ACTUAL beatmatching I was doing while actually at the mixer, not just the 45-minute mixes). I think if you do fine, you wont need to 'actively' promote. You just playing/dj'ing is enough, I would think. If someone needs a dj for an upcoming event, they should approach you.  I definitely needed to have a backup with the mixes, in case I shit the bed, because I hadnt practiced or even planned my set, since I knew it was just 10-20 friends. Luckily, it worked out decently. I started with house/electric, moved to hiphop, then salsa/merengue, then all over the place. That was NOT my plan, initially, so just make sure you have a few transitions to different genres available, in case folks start asking for a change in tempo.  Your plan sounds very reasonable.

Orchestral grabs peoples attention, the pop song keeps them interested.  Stick with bigroom remixes of popular tracks and bigroom tracks that are radio friendly. Eg Showtek - Bad, Any calvin harris track etc. Key is to pick stuff people can sing along and know the words. Tops of 1.5 mins per song. Do not play the whole song out unless your life depends on it. If you must play the second part of a track then do a mashup of the drop into something else. Dont worry about FX focus on stuff people can sing along to and mashups with popular tracks. Think dimitri vegas and like mike where they will put anything people can sing to. Aim for max appeal :P"

Remember just because you're a DJ doesn't mean you're playing EDM and doing crazy ass drops every time you play, you are (especially for this event) just a human iPod so don't try to do anything that's too crazy.

Beatmatch,3chxk3,DJ_Theo,3,Wed Jul 8 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"Even a few people i know from conventions that do the raves and stuff.   Do raves and stuff?! Awesome.  As pointed out you don't know what you are doing. And that's ok, nobody knows what they are doing at first. I applaud your energy and your desire to help your friends.   Now... do you want to do this the right way? Or do you want to go to a party where your friend is playing? To do it right, read this book which will teach you about djing, when and where it happens, why it happens, what djs should and shouldn't do etc etc. It will also teach djs (you) how to promote, get exposure, get gigs, and more. It takes more than you think, and this book delivers with the info. Read it and you'll likely know more about EDM and djing than your dj friends.   Now... how competent are your friends as djs? Trance and hardstyle are a bit ""last year"" but who cares, good music is good music. There will always be a ""modern"" take on old styles. But... if your friends can't play competent sets, can't lead a crowd, can't network, and spend their time in their own superstar dj worlds you'd be best not wasting your time.   Networking is 50% of djing, record selection and skill are 50% of djing, the other 40% is who you know and how you know them, and then the other 70% is always being there and self promoting."

Beatmatch,3cj2oh,bosull,6,Wed Jul 8 08:26:14 2015 UTC,"I had this with my Xone:22.  The thing was that the 2 line inputs can be switched between phono or line (basically for turntables or CDJ/computer).  Not sure if your mixer has the same thing as mine, but i had to put 2 pieces of plastic back inside the mixer (""cavaliers"" is the french word) to switch the input lines from line to phono.  Read the manual, you might find interesting things :)"

Beatmatch,3cj2oh,Mr_RD,2,Thu Jul 9 00:04:54 2015 UTC,Might be an amp issue (internal) but difficult to tell yet. What Stanton mixer are you using? Do you have another mixer that you can test the STR8-150 with?

Beatmatch,3chq0p,Dantejb,5,Wed Jul 8 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"There is no ""should"". Live gives you a platform for your art. You can use it as you like. The question is: What do you want to do?   Music production is way more complex. Like a limiter on the master can be a good idea, but can be a bad idea too. You don't want to just throw a limiter on the master and than don't care about levels. Also you could even compress the master a bit, but usually you will mix mastered songs so you would essentially just overcompress them.  Also you have filters, delays, reverbs, everything. You can do tons. Slice samples to MIDI-tracks, re-sample. Use feedback loops,... I could go on and on."
Beatmatch,3cizs3,PlopDropper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:45:15 2015 UTC,I don't think you can go wrong with a Xone 42 but try to compare it with the 43 and the 43c.
Beatmatch,3cizs3,Saucette,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:39:33 2015 UTC,A Xone 43c would be particularly convenient because it includes a digital audio interface so you wouldn't need a separate audio interface and a giant mess of wires.
Beatmatch,3cizs3,EmileDorkheim,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:54:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've been eyeing that up, it does seem pricey considering it limits me to just use serato tho. I'm not fully sure on what extras it has tho. Ill watch a few reviews when I get a minute."
Beatmatch,3cizs3,rovert15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:37:58 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't limit you to Serato. The sound card is built in and you should be able to route your Traktor channels to it and go."
Beatmatch,3cizs3,EmileDorkheim,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think rovert15 is right. The Serato branding is potentially confusing to be fair. It won't work as a Traktor Scratch interface (i.e. for DVS control of Traktor) but it should work as an external audio interface with Traktor."
Beatmatch,3cizs3,junglizer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"Since you're already leaning that way, I'd definitely get a new mixer. I think you'll find the DDM4K leaves a lot to be desired if you get something else. The mixer is very much the heart of your workflow."

Beatmatch,3ciknt,TheDopplerIsDown,3,Wed Jul 8 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"They are basically pretty equal in quality and it will come down more to preference.  I've had experience with both systems, but never that exact configurations (heard plenty of qsc gear and own k12s), heard the prx12s over a pair subs but never the 10s over a single sub).  Both sound great and you'll probably be happy with either.  I have heard the jbl 700 series have a tendency to overheat a bit but that may have been some of the earlier models.  The prx sub will give a bit more oomph, but the kw181 is a lot more portable and easy to transport.  I have some qsc speakers and they sound pretty good, but they tend to get pretty harsh when run too hot and push it to the limiter while the prx's don't really have that issue.   As far as specs go, I wouldn't worry too much about it as they're pretty much close enough that it doesn't really matter.  The wattage is a non issue since both of the listed wattage are pretty much lies and realistically,  both are going to be pushing around 400 rms.  If you have a store to go listen to them, maybe do an a/b and see what your prefer.  I find jbl speakers to be a little more flat while qsc can have a bit of a processed sound, but it's not Unpleasing to the ear (unless you push too much).  Some additional speakers to check out:    Yamaha dxr10s. I have a pair of these as well and with subs, I actually prefer them to my k12s.  They sound better when pushed and are actually cheaper than the qscs.  They don't have a comparable sub tho (biggest is a 15"") so if you want to stay consistent with matches tops and bottoms then it may not be for you.  I know people who run them with kw181s tho with no issues.  Ev etx 10s over 18s:  a bit higher end than the qscs and prx's so they're more expensive, but I hear rave reviews.  The 15"" etx sub supposedly is amazing and can keep up easily with the kw181."
Beatmatch,3ciknt,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:02:32 2015 UTC,"Haha, its really awesome that you commented because I was actually considering private messaging you xD  Thank you for the input! I'm able to A/B the JBL and QSC systems (at least the 12"" version of the tops) in my guitar center but obviously there I cannot push them to frat party levels, but they seem to sound almost the same at the levels I am able to push them at.  I'll look into the other speakers you suggested as well!"
Beatmatch,3ciknt,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:05:21 2015 UTC,"Also, maybe check out the prx800 series - I hear they added fans due to the overheating issue.    Not quite as light as the 700 series, but if it's an install, it shouldn't be an issue.  If you want a sub that absolutely murders the others in terms of output, see if you can check out the yorkville ls801p.  It's around the same price as a kw181 but it would take about 3 of the kws to match the output of a single ls801p.  Sound quality isn't as good tho and the jbl and kW go lower, but for sheer volume, nothing in that price range comes close.  Absolute beast to move tho so if you need portable, that's not the best option."
Beatmatch,3ciknt,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:15:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this system would need to be portable - taking it to multiple different parties and also wanting to rent it out."

Beatmatch,3ciknt,dj_soo,2,Wed Jul 8 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yea,  check out the etx15sp too - a lot of guys I know think the 15 is more bang for the buck than the 18.    If you test them in the store, make sure to set them to live mode rather than music mode - I hear music mode limits far too easily while live mode gives you way more oomph.  They will cost a little more than the qscs and jbls tho."
Beatmatch,3ciknt,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"What is the biggest audience you think a pair of the 10"" tops and the 15"" sub should be able to handle?  Also, I want to be able to make a return on my investment here pretty quickly, and I want to rent whatever system I get out to people. How much do you think people would pay a night for a system like that? I did some looking around my area to see other PA rentals in my area to get an idea, but none of them really had any systems this high end."
Beatmatch,3cho8u,Taconut,2,Wed Jul 8 00:03:09 2015 UTC,Well some of the best scratch tutorials I've seen are DJ Anglo (found on YouTube) however they aren't controller focused. Regarding amazing vids of people scratching on controllers (or even CDJs for that matter) I'd urge you to try and find out what they learned on. Most people that I've met that are able to scratch anywhere from decently to extremely well on controllers all learned on vinyl.
Beatmatch,3cho8u,junglizer,2,Wed Jul 8 14:43:52 2015 UTC,Ditto here.  The learning curve for scratching on a controller is much harder than on turntables. The physical rotation of the platter just helps so much in terms of understanding what you're exactly doing when you're manipulating a track. I'm still learning to scratch on a controller and I will admit EVERYONE that I know that can scratch on a controller learned on a turntable first. Food for thought.
Beatmatch,3cho8u,Methionine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I didn't have the money for a turntable :/. Plus, scratching wasn't my main reason for buying a controller. I just really like it because it feels so much more analog compare to everything else."
Beatmatch,3cho8u,earnestdotcom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"Larger platters will allow you to exaggerate your movements somewhat as you learn to scratch. Once you get those exaggerated movements down, you can start to build the precision required for faster movements, which will translate into less motion. Those smaller motions are what you need to accomplish advanced scratch techniques on a controller.   That being said, it's definitely possible to learn to scratch on a controller. Check out the Scratching For Controller DJs Course at Digital DJ Tips (digitaldjtips.com). I have trouble with some of the advanced stuff on my controller, but we're all still learning, right?

Beatmatch,3cewfa,tomjarvis,3,Tue Jul 7 11:11:32 2015 UTC,What I would do is go to a store and just try out a rane sl box or mixer with your laptop and see how it performs before dropping the $99 on the DVS expansion.
Beatmatch,3cewfa,dj_soo,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:10 2015 UTC,Why don't you try it by yourself ?  Practice the amount of hours you plan to mix in your club and let the activity monitor open to see if your processor is overwhelming/heating.

Beatmatch,3cewfa,erratic_calm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:30:31 2015 UTC,"The AMX is just a MIDI controller. I can't imagine it's going to use any more CPU than without one. If Serato DJ is stable on your computer you should be fine.  I can still run SSL on an SL1 with an MPD18 on my old 2006 Macbook Intel Core 2 Duo with 2 GB of ram and very low latency. OS X is rock solid and that old laptop won't die.   I can't speak for Windows but theoretically if you have Windows stripped down for performance and all background processes closed I don't see why it would struggle on an i3 processor. The system requirements for Serato DJ say it can run on an i3 or even a mega old 2 ghz Core 2 Duo.  When you say you worry about the audio dropout warning, are you saying that you see it often? Have you experienced it or are you nervous you might see it?"
Beatmatch,3cewfa,erratic_calm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:48 2015 UTC,"it has been experienced. When I use both AMX and AFX it often drops out if I hit the effects.   Curiously enough, Mixtrack Pro 2 and AFX have no probs whatsoever."
Beatmatch,3cewfa,catroaring,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, so there's your answer. Your machine can't handle the FX. Have you tried bumping the latency up just slightly to see if that compensates?"

Beatmatch,3cecos,EmileDorkheim,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:10:23 2015 UTC,"An iPad and a Z1 does seem like a great portable setup. I suspect a lot of people are put off using an iPad because of the perception of it as a gimmick, though."

It's far from traditional, but extremely usable. I've done a couple of impromptu party gigs with just my iPad - and so long as you have a good library on songs and can understand how mixing changes on the iPad (no jogwheels, slow scratching, ideally suited to auto-syncing) and taking advantage of a few extra features like Freeze/Slice mode then people will be surprised you can get the party rocking with just an iPad.  The tools help... but it's the DJ's skills, experience and craftsmanship that actually makes the show!"
Beatmatch,3cecos,erratic_calm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:07:32 2015 UTC,I have the Z1 and an iPad Mini. It's a pretty dope setup once you get all your grids and cue points going. The Z1 gives you the fine grain EQ and trim controls that are impossible to use on an iPad screen and a dedicated headphone jack for monitoring.  I've been on Serato with 1200s for years but I wanted something more compact and it has been pretty dope. Feel free to ask if you have questions.

And the great thing about it is the option to map it however you like (which is what I did)   The set up is expensive though. Probably will cost you around $1000 for everything.                 -the price can change depending on how much you actually want to spend for a sound card  -try buying a lenovo laptop? i know they had some issues with some shitty software on their laptops but the way they are built is very reliable. Also adding on to the fact that some of their models prevent the hardware from getting ruined if any liquid spills onto the keyboard.   I have dj'd at clubs and house parties while using this set up.

Beatmatch,3cbib9,SaltyBandido,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"I listened to it yesterday. The mixing for the most part is really good. There were only 2 transitions I didn't like. At about 15 min when Teach Me comes in I think the vocals come in a little too abruptly, maybe use more filter. The 2nd was (like you said) when Tchami fades out, it was muddled, but I thought you brought in that song just fine. That sound you put in when Tchami was being brought in wasn't my favorite but it worked fine.  The only other thing was that I thought the music choice was a little boring. Lots of the same, very minimal, I didn't feel a real build up. I usually like something in a beginning to grab my attention so I know this mix is going to worth listening to before it gets too deep. However, I know everyone has their own taste in music. Overall good mix."

I remember thinking i forgot to adjust my gains for that song and obviously a bit more filter would have helped!  I also appreciate the comments about the song choice. I wanted to pick songs that were chilled out so it was easy to listen to. I can see how it could come across as boring too as i've noted that down for myself. I felt like I didn't bring many 'big drops'. I'm sure you'll agree.  Thanks so much for the feedback!

This mix is kind of just representative of some of the house tracks I'd love to drop in a club setting, so track selection is pretty important! I'm just a bedroom DJ for now, but I'm in contact with some people at my school for gigs at some parties. Let me know what you guys think!  I think my worst transition was around 28:48. I wasn't using sync and... the beats just didn't match up immediately and it sounded pretty awful. Apart from that, let me know what you think! I'm really trying to improve.

Beatmatch,3cbib9,Enesex,2,Mon Jul 6 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"This mix is great! The songs go really well together and I really like the energy progression throughout the mix. I really like how the next couple of songs after Intoxicated would only last a little after a drop, it kept the energy going! The transition from Up All Night to Melody was fine in my opinion. Sure it was offbeat at first but you fixed it within a couple of seconds; that's what beatmatching is for right?   I only have a couple of things to say otherwise. The first one is when you played 3 Oliver Heldens' songs back to back. I enjoyed it when you played Overdrive into Up All Night but when you brought in Melody the energy of the mix leveled out for me. But that also might be because I listen to a lot of Oliver Heldens so I know who produced the songs so a casual listener at the club probably wouldn't be able to tell. I'm also biased against Melody because that's my least favorite Heldens song.   The second thing isn't really criticism, it's more of a comparison of our techniques. From Melody to Intoxicated I would have cut out Melody and brought in Intoxicated at the cowbell and maybe looped that for 8 bars for a quick energy reset after 3 moderately high energy songs. But like I said, that's just how I like to use Intoxicated when I mix with that song. Your transition for that was great and worked completely fine as well.   Keep up the good work though! I listened to this mix at work and I was definitely grooving the entire time and started dancing too!"

I haven't been doing this for very long, but... I mean I didn't really notice anything wrong here.  Song choice was killer, I could totally picture this being a kick-ass summer mix. The whole indie/nu-disco/tropical vibe really came out with your song selection.  Your transitions were versatile. You even got some good tempo changes in, and I can't really figure out how you did it to be honest. There was one within the first 10 minutes that really impressed me!  I wish that I was more advanced so that I could offer you more constructive feedback, but I just can't really point at anything wrong. Good mix man :)"

Beatmatch,3cbib9,NeonSeal,2,Tue Jul 7 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"This mix is good! But it could be great. So... I'm gonna put some good constructive criticism here for you!  First transition had a tiny problem with the drums, maybe they weren't exactly lined up or something, but it was a bit noticeable. Plus the chords weren't exactly perfect, so maybe you could get away with a high pass or a low pass to diminish the clash between them in your transition.Also, the second track takes a while to build up. You should probably drop a drum loop to keep the energy up until the build up happens.   Second transition into Wish You Were Mine... Did you just wait for the 2nd track to finish, and then start the next one? This is perfectly fine, and it doesn't sound too bad. In fact, you could get away with it at a club provided that you stay in tempo. However, for the sake of growing your skills, try to do a transition that spices things up. You aren't a playlist, you are a DJ! I could set up my phone to do the same thing.  The third transition is fine, but you could have started Runaway while the outro of WYWM was going, and it would've sounded a bit better. If there is a chord clash, or a bassline clash, I always use a highpass to fade the old song out a bit and to introduce the new one. I'm not a pro by any means, but that works for me all the time. Try it and see if it works!  Fourth transition was a little rough, but it's good that you were beatmatching and not syncing! I do that all the time, I even did it in my mix I posted in this thread. Yours was pretty noticeable though, so try and practice your beatmatching, it'll get better and quicker.  Fifth transition was fire! Best one so far. Song choice is great, I haven't heard this remix but I think I'll put it in a set in the future. Thanks for exposing me to a great track!  Sixth transition is also pretty good, no complaints here. Gotta dig that Martin Solveig track ;)  Seventh transition into This Party was good, except it kinda kills the energy unexpectedly there... You can almost always place the new song during the outro of the old track. That's what club mixes are for, they help you out and are a nice tool for DJs! Your transition was smooth, but it wasn't fire. Try making all your transitions KILLER. Sometimes it'll work, sometimes it won't. Won't know until you try to expand your repertoire!  I think you got the point here. Your transitions are good, but try and expand what you are doing! With practice comes perfect. Keep on spinnin!"
Beatmatch,3cbib9,Enesex,2,Tue Jul 7 05:29:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for the feedback! This is exactly what I was looking for! Yeah I noticed a couple of the same things when I relistened to my mix. I think the transition that bothered me most was the first transition because I couldn't get the drums to sound good together no matter how much I nudged Show Me Love. But I'll definitely try high/low passing next time to see how it sounds! Thanks again for the criticism!

I played out at a party this weekend, and I brought out a cool mix of disco tracks to get the vibe going, and mixed some cool techno/house later on the mix to keep the dancing going. I really like majority of my transitions during the first 30 min, but feel like it wasn't as tight later on in the night. Since it was party though, I had a lot of fun, messed with fx here in there to keep it interesting. I feel my eqing could be better in some areas, such as with the first 4 tracks.   Overall everyone said they dug my set all night. Thanks for the feedback in advance!"

""Watts"" means absolutely nothing today since most of those printed specs are straight up lies to fool uniformed buyers into thinking they translate into loudness.    I'm guessing either you got a cheap beginner brand that doesn't actually go very loud or you found a steal on some ancient speakers.  It's why a ""400"" watt rcf can get louder and throw further than a ""1000"" watt behgringer - because rcf is one of the few companies that actually tells the truth about their specs.  electrovoice is a trusted and proven company that makes great sounding and reliable gear."

Beatmatch,3cb0le,FueledByHerbs,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"Edison professional is the Costco brand.  It doesn't really compare to a trusted and proven brand like electro voice.  The thing you should be paying attention to is the RMS wattage which is a little closer to the real life power handling of the speaker (still often exaggerations or lies tho).  The other spec to look at is max SPL which although also lies is a better indicator about how loud a speaker actually gets.  I can't find a listed max SPL for the Edison anywhere online which should tell you something when it's a standard specification that all professional speaker manufacturers include.  I don't know where they get this 2000 watts number from, but there's no way that speaker comes even close to peaking out at 2000 watts.

Next step would be to learn some music theory about chord progression and melody writing. With that and some practice you'll soon be able to tell the key with the help of a keyboard or other instrument. In short it's about finding the root note, which than will either be used for the corresponding minor or major scale = key!  It's almost impossible for most people to ever just hear the key without an instrument. If you want to be as indipendant as possible use a pitch tuning fork - that requires some more practice though. I guess if its only for DJing that might be overkill. You can never lear too much though :)"

Beatmatch,3c47w0,Z06,4,Sat Jul 4 20:41:09 2015 UTC,Like others suggested before: phrasing!   If you play any sort of electronic music you just need to start the incoming track at the right time. Them you can let the outgoing track play out most of the time. Just a little eq adjustment to cut the dominant parts a little and it will almost always sound fine.
Beatmatch,3c47w0,mikeb93,3,Sat Jul 4 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"It depends on the style of music you play and the tracks themselves. If it's still sounding clunky then it might be that the track need to be lined up more accurately, keys are off, phrasing is off, EQing needs work, or maybe even a combination of those things. Sometimes 2 songs just refuse to sound good together.  Post an example of 2-4 songs in a mix and I'm sure people here will be more than happy to listen and give you their constructive criticism."

Beatmatch,3c47w0,rmandraque,2,Sat Jul 4 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"To try and be slightly more specific with style, I play UK House & Bass (""jackin"" house) and garage and as much as I understand how phrasing works I just don't think I'm getting a feel for it. Any tips?"
Beatmatch,3c47w0,cyph3x,3,Sat Jul 4 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"Tag ure tracks' cue points or learn the progression of the track. I use a mental 1-5 scale with 1 being no percussion or significant bass, just a synth or background noise, very easy to mix in with no EQ needed, and 5 being a drop. You want it to be around a 6 or 7 between the two, max, to avoid having to much going on. So if you're mixing in an intro bar, which would be a 2 on this scale, you can mix it into the end of a drop by EQing properly (7 total) or mix it in after the drop ends. Hard to explain.  I'm not entirely sure what jackin' house is but from what I understand it's like Aaron Jackson/Taiki Nulight type stuff. Imo one of the easier genres to mix, but you need to understand how the tracks are built. That genre is very formulaic so you just gotta practice your EQ and balance.  Send me a mix if u want I'll tell you what's wrong and what's right. I can also link u one of my better mixes bc I mix what I think is a similar style - 124 Bpm, percussion stolen from deep house but synth and overall feel providing a ton of energy. Just keep practicing, took me a year to be confident enough to spin a 45 minute set with no prep and minimal mistakes and I'm still not that good.  It's also a good genre to practice beatmatching as there aren't many strange bass patterns or difficult concepts to grasp. You could theoretically mix tracks the same way over and over without using loops or effects and make it sound good. So if you're gonna ween off sync, that's a good place to start"
Beatmatch,3c47w0,cyph3x,2,Sat Jul 4 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"Knowing that the genre is so formulaic is the main reason this is so frustrating, like I KNOW it should be easy but I'm still missing the drop placements and such. I'm not even recording mixes atm because that's how far out I am but a link to one of yours would be way helpful if you don't mind."
Beatmatch,3c47w0,cyph3x,3,Sat Jul 4 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how far you are, take some time once in a while and record an hour of you spinning live. It's really hard to tell how you sound to the output when you're going live, and you'd be surprised - sometimes in the moment, I'm thinking as I cut over to the next track ""that mix out was fucking awful"" and I listen to the recording and it sounds fine. Sometimes I think I have good mix outs but they sound like shit in the recording. It's also much easier to diagnose what you should have done by listening to it over again! That's how I learned the most, by far - listening to mixes of producers and then listening to my own.  heres my mix - the first mix out is an example of me fucking up right off the bat before going on to absolutely nail six in a row, and an example of why you gotta just stay in the moment and forget your mistakes. Cut the highs on the lead track too early and didn't cut at the right time. I thought it was tolerable live, the more I listen the less I like it. Hopefully this is the style you're talking about to a degree so it's at least tolerable ;D"
Beatmatch,3c47w0,cyph3x,2,Sat Jul 4 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"One thing I also get concerned about is obviously you don't particularly want to let the full breakdown play for every track, and some people have even said to me that you should never let a track drop twice. Any thoughts?"
Beatmatch,3c47w0,Kameniev,2,Sun Jul 5 10:18:01 2015 UTC,"That's just personal opinion i think. If you're a dubstep or trap or dnb DJ looking to do a professional job at an actual gig, I would generally agree. But that's not a rule by any means. I sometimes let a track drop again if the crowd really likes it, if it's slightly different from the first drop, or if I just can't find another track that's in key to mix in (intro/outro bars make key irrelevant, usually).  Do what YOU want, ive heard professional producers play entire songs and strictly do intro/outro mixes. Most people won't even notice, that's the beauty of it"

As far as bang for your buck: you get what you pay for. OS X is free, but running it on compatible hardware is a premium experience at a premium price.    MacBooks are super sturdy, and their metal unibody frames are way more durable than the asymmetric plastic ones on most PC laptops. I know you are looking at an ultrabook, but powerful PC laptops can be very chunky, while MacBooks are all slim and light. PCI flash (what's in the MacBooks) is a lot faster than 2.5"" SSD.  The trackpad is the best there is. Battery life in high performance mode in Windows is a joke compared to OS X. OS X is [anecdotally] a lot more stable and secure than Windows. Especially when it comes to little things a PC user might not even consider stability issues unless they weren't there (the odd blue screen, trackpad temporarily stops working, slow downs, task bar won't unhide, that kind of stuff). [Subjectively], OS X is a lot more elegant and consistent. Apple's customer service is top notch. Macs have way better resale value compared to PC laptops.   In addition, any comparably specced and similar in quality PC laptop (beyond just CPU and RAM) will be priced in the same ballpark."

Controllers because controllers don't actually produce sound themselves, it's just MIDI data that is manipulated via software. Or DVS, as it's all routed through an audio interface which is passed to software. The computer acts as the 3rd party that does the beatmatching for you (sync), but then has to pass the manipulated audio back out the main channel for you to hear. I'm not 100% sure how the CDJ sync works, but I assume it relies on usage of either Rekordbox or the method where you connect multiple CDJs to a single mixer.   As far as to why sync was initially added, I can only assume that it was to appeal to a wider audience. I mean, they are trying to make money selling a product, if they get new people into it that way, then good for them. I also don't think the whole sync ""debate"" ever even occurred to the software developers."

Just because I think it's half the fun of mixing. EQing is fun, so are effects, and obviously track selection, but beatmatching is very engaging.  It really makes you listen to the tracks. It is hard at first, but gets easier.   And once mastered it doesn't take long at all. I just think it's fun to ride the pitch throughout a mix.  I prefer stick shift cars too though.  :) I don't hate on people who sync though.  It's not for me but I totally understand why people use sync. I can tell the difference between sync'd and manual beatmatched sets and I prefer the live feel to the manually beatmatched sets more.   It's the human element that I like.   Sync'd transitions all sound perfect.  Manually beatmatched sets have a little variation and tend to 'float' over one another instead of being in perfect time. This is probably because i grew up on vinyl and am older though.  It's just preference in the end. I would advise people to at least try manual beatmatching just for the fun of it if nothing else."

Beatmatch,3bxesc,undiscoveredbum666,9,Thu Jul 2 23:07:25 2015 UTC,Virtual dj is a good one as it has loads of handy features that make it accessible for newbies like sync/autoloop/hotcue/beatgrids etc which may be lacking on other software. Its what I used before moving to a controller. It has a keyboard mapping and if you have bluetooth speakers you can have a cue/master on it. Generally its just packed with features and is fairly self explanatory.
Beatmatch,3bxesc,marzipanman,3,Thu Jul 2 23:26:11 2015 UTC,"Seconding VDJ. I use it without being able to hear the cued track (WHY did I not think about using Bluetooth headphones or speaker to hear the faded-out track?!?) so I make sure the visual cues are spot on. The beats align with the marks, the first beat in the bar matches the longer of the marks. I set up a Cue Point at points on tracks where I'd bring in a track and it's not visually obvious when looking at the visual bar, and another Point before it to show what I want to loop that track before bringing it in. It's a method that works for me.   This was the first mix I made and uploaded to Mixcrate. I was a bedroom DJ then, I'm still the same now, but I like what the software can do."
Beatmatch,3bxesc,Jackpot777,2,Fri Jul 3 03:32:42 2015 UTC,I do not know a single DJ software that does not contain all the features mentioned by you.  However I second VDJ. Started with that aswell. It is a good overall solution and you can see where you want to go from there.
Beatmatch,3bxesc,Okidoki_Sir,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:36:10 2015 UTC,Yeah the ones I quoted were the obvious ones but it has ton of little things that you don't get on even the full version of Serato (which is what I use). However overall its not nearly as stable as serato when you do move to controller.
Beatmatch,3bxesc,marzipanman,2,Fri Jul 3 11:26:38 2015 UTC,"For me, it's not about stability. It's about the excessive amount of features on VDJ that hinder a beginner from getting better. VDJ is like a bike with training wheels and Serato is like a normal bike."
Beatmatch,3bxesc,CagedZebra,5,Sat Jul 4 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"The beauty of Mixxx is that it's open source, and therefore you get the whole thing for free. With Virtual DJ, Serato, etc, the free version is crippled; it's designed to get you used to it so you'll pay the money for the full version when you hit the limits of the demo. That said, tools are personal, try a few and see what clicks for you."

I've been using four decks with a pioneer ddj sz and it seems like a lot at first but you definitely can find a rhythm with it once you get your flow going.

A main one is acapellas.co.uk I used to use that heaps but nowadays there seems to be a fair number of average quality tracks. Remix competitions are a great way to get the best quality studio ones so look out for them. I'm also a part of the club killers record pool in which they have a fair few.   Either way it's still like finding tracks, you can't cheat it and need to put the finding power into it. Unless, that is, OP gives you a download link to all of his! Haha have fun!"

I recently upgraded to the DDJ-SX2, but the S2 had served me quite well. It's a great controller. Comes with Traktor Pro.  The Pioneer DDJ-SR ($599) is a great controller and you should definitely take a look at what it offers to determine if it is worth the extra cost above your price point. Comes with Serato DJ. If you can find a discount, you might be able to score one around or under $500. You can ask for a discounted price from some vendors over the phone or chat. Another option here is used gear."

Beatmatch,3bux4f,dfmz,5,Thu Jul 2 11:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the prefs>output, there is a mono check box for the master out (if you are mixing internally).   If you are mixing externally, assign the same output from the soundcard to left and right deck output, and be sure to lower the main output to -6dB (I guess it's logically what you need to do? I don't mix externally).  Alternatively, if the mixtable you are plugging into has a mono switch, use that. Much simpler. If it's a soundboard with several line mono inputs, plug the left and right output of your soundcard in two inputs and raise both faders, panned center, to taste while watching the output level.   The general idea is to have a true mono signal, and not some half stereo which can be very strange or crappy sometimes. Also be warned some tracks sound worse on mono than others..."

The subsequent deer in headlights and train wreck that proceeded would be enough to at least give them some idea of what we do.  Now, because of technology, the state of DJing in the mainstream sense, and the complete ease of it, I'll just say that being a dj can be as easy or as difficult as you want to make it.  And yes., some Djs do nothing more than sit around for 5-10 minutes until the next song.  In fact, some of the highest paid Djs in the world simply make an hour long mix ahead of time and just sit on stage and pretend to dj for an hour.  But, if you take the time to really understand the art, it is ultimately a fluid musical and performance art where the Djs can make something new out of something existing (mixing), creative brand new sounds using mastered technique (scratching), and ultimately control the mood of a group of people from 5 to 100,000 using their choice of music, how they choose to play it, and when they choose to play it.  The best Djs can react and feed off the energy of the crowd in front of them and tailor their set in realtime to the needs and wants of the crowd without them even knowing."

I would add that that certain genre's of music are more conducive to being really creative with mixing e.g. I mix oldschool drum & bass and can switch back and forth between tunes and fade in and out overlays some 30 times in a single transition between 2 records. While this is unlikely to work well with the OP's choice of music, it is an example of how much influence a dj can have. The skill in matching time is where the challenge lies, but equally when just fading in/out there is still a large creative freedom in how that is achieved and in the progression of the set. Many dj's produce too (make their own music using software - myself included) which is an entirely different art requiring a detailed understamding of both audio mechanics and software interfaces. I'd suggest choosing one or other to start with, based on what you want to achieve most quickly."

However, I will say that a good DJ, even if they aren't a producer, understands the principles of music production. Similarly a good music producer, even if they aren't a DJ, understands the principles of DJing.  DJing has become so popular nowadays (I'm looking at you, Paris Hilton) that it's increasingly difficult for a DJ to get recognised. That's a reason why so many DJs are also producers and vice-versa... it's still one good way that you can stand out from all the sync-pushers. Throwing cakes is no longer enough.

Beatmatch,3bu4ud,djBeagles,2,Thu Jul 2 04:16:54 2015 UTC,"Okay first of all: Auto-beatgrid-detection sucks in Serato. It analyzed a bunch of 128bpm tunes from my library as 96bpm tunes. So chances are the overall bpm of that song is just wrong.  Fortunately the beatgridding workflow is pretty good with Serato, so I will just tell you how I get good beatgrids:   1: Click clear to remove all previous grids 2: Listen to the song and press x on the first downbeat of the phrase you want to mix in the song (This way you have a nice countdown to your mix-in point) 3: Stretch the grid using the arrow keys so that the next bar-marker falls in place with an actual bar 4: Skip ahead a few seconds and re-adjust the stretch. 5: After doing step 4 you can already tell if the song is drummed by a human or a drum machine (in other words: if the bpm is consistent or not). If it is consistent: continue with 6.1, if not, continue with 6.2 6.1: Skip into the song a few times and re-adjust the stretch. Check the beginning and the end and if both are fine, you are done. 6.2: In this case I would decide on a mix-in point and a mix-out point. Place a warp-marker (x) on the downbeat of every bar before the mix-in point and the mix-out point (and maybe a few after these as well). You can leave the middle of the song untouched. BUT: If you do leave the middle of the song untouched, make sure to turn off sync before the song passes your warp-markers. Because otherwise it might get ugly. So un-sync quickly after you mixed it in and re-sync when you mix out.   Hope that helps. Of course you can fasten the process once you got familiar with the tools :)  edit: Of course this does not cover bpm changes, but you can hear these pretty easily"

Beatmatch,3bshhl,thatonegyty,2,Wed Jul 1 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"2x4 is traditionally two DJ's sharing four turntables going into one mixer. If they're using DVS, usually they'd each have their own laptop hooked to ""their"" two turntables.  If you're using controllers instead of turntables or CDJ's, it seems to me like a basic 2x4 would be you each run your own laptop and controller with two decks in I guess external output mode, then feed the output from each into a common external 4-channel mixer, and you figure out how to beatmatch by ear when you go between computers.  It's awkward because all-in-one controllers have both deck controls and mixer controls in one unit, and you're trying to emulate a four channel mixer in the middle with two turntables on each side of it.  I guess a digital-only approximation would be you need to setup MIDI bindings on one laptop where one controller only controls decks 1 and 2 and the other controller only controls decks 3 and 4."

Or get a 1U mixer like the Rane SM82 or SM26, which will sound better, but be of limited utility for anything else.  your friend and yourself will have to beatmatch between each other manually, or if you must have sync you can probably set up a master clock over the network."
Beatmatch,3bshhl,inkosana,2,Wed Jul 1 22:33:24 2015 UTC,Easiest way is to run each controller into a mixer and run the mixer into the speakers.  You can then mix with each other and have 4 decks gong at once if you want
Beatmatch,3bshhl,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"There might be way, but it would probably involve extensive Midi Mapping. I've never done it, but my thought would be to run the Gemini as the main controller Only focusing on Decks AB and using its sound-card for your output and then find a way to custom map the Ergo to Decks CD.   Better option might be to just use a midi clock to sync two laptops each running Traktor and sending your audio out of the Ergo into the Aux on the Gemini. Or doing the same-thing with the audio and beat matching by ear."
Beatmatch,3bq0o3,The_Reservoir_Dog,5,Wed Jul 1 05:41:27 2015 UTC,If you want to stick with Serato then get the SX2.  You can always add two cdjs or two turntables later on and use them with the SX2 which will also support timecode with the DVS plugin.
Beatmatch,3bq0o3,dj_soo,3,Wed Jul 1 05:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's personal preference but I'd recommend the SX2 for your needs. For ~$1500 you won't get a high-end CDJ set-up so I'd go with either the SX2 or DVS. The upside is that the SX2 would be a complete, all in one package and you won't have to worry about the extra baggage that comes along with DVS / vinyl-based setups (e.g. needles, connectivity, software compatibility).   You should be able to pick up a fairly basic mixer (Nuo 2.0, Xone 23C, Pioneer DJM 2xx) and a pair of used Technics under $1500. You'd have to stretch your budget by maybe $200 - $400 if you buy a mixer that doesn't have a built-in sound card."

Beatmatch,3bmcio,michaeljacob7,13,Tue Jun 30 11:23:46 2015 UTC,"First off, welcome to DJing.  Second, don't worry about gigs and events.  Learn to DJ first.

This is an inherent disadvantage of using a lot of all-in-one controllers.  If you're plugging into a DJ mixer then you can use an iphone direct into the mixer, but if you're just using the S4, you're SOL.  Some controllers function as standalone mixers, but I do believe the S4 requires Traktor running in order to play audio outside of the program.  The best DJs do not plan their sets from beginning to end and even if they do, they are able to improvise if the crowd isn't feeling it.  Learn your tunes and learn to DJ on the fly and you will never have this problem  digitaldjtips and djtechtools have some good videos.  Just search youtube.  depends on the gig and depends on the crowd.  If you're hired to just be a dj at a more mainstream night, play the hits.  If you're being booked as you, play your tunes.  If you're being booked for an underground night, don't play the hits.  depends on the gig, depends on the crowd.  Just learn to transition between tempos smoothly.  Search the sub on good ways to do this  No.  Most DJ software records your audio so you can just record your audio as a track.  If you're using MP3s as your source, I would avoid compressing back down to mp3 as you'll be transcoding and affecting audio quality.  Serato has a paid plugin that allows you to automate cues, but you're on an S4 so you can't use Serato. You go out and you network.  You meet people, you get to know promoters, bar staff, and fans.  Don't get to know them to get gigs.  You basically make friends.  Again, worry more about learning to DJ before you worry about getting gigs.  Most people take about 6 months to a year before they are comfortable playing gigs.  Don't rush yourself.  Spend time learning the fundamentals instead of diving into the shortcuts that the program provides.  Learn to beatmatch by ear (mix using only the pitch sliders and your headphones - don't look at any of the on-screen cues and don't use the sync button).  Know your tunes and understand musical phrasing and harmonic mixing (shouldn't be difficult if you produce).   Mix with your ears and not your eyes.  Your eyes should be on the crowd and seeing how they react or looking for the next tune."

Beatmatch,3bmcio,pineneddle,2,Tue Jun 30 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you shouldn't use it, I'm saying you should learn to beat match by ear before using it.  There are a number of reasons why learning to beat match is important which have been gone into ad nauseom here, but the main reason is that it makes a better and more versatile dj.   It forces you to pay attention and listen to your tracks rather than relying on sync, read outs, bpm scans, etc.    Bpm detection is not 100% all the time so it allows you to still mix if the numbers are wrong.  It gives you the skill to play on anything out in front of you so you can still perform if the club or promoter doesn't allow you to bring your own gear, then you won't be able to play.  Have the fundamentals down will allow you to perform on just about everything with minimal experience on the gear.  It's just more fun."

Try filtering out the current track in the breakdown, lowering the volume and dropping the new track. It's basic but if the crowd is bored you don't need anything fancy, just move on to something you think they will want to hear as soon as possible.  4: It's pretty easy to learn the basics of Traktor on your own but it has a lot of features so if you want to understand everything then read the manual. In terms of videos teaching you how to DJ/tips and tricks. Ellaskins, DJTechTools and DJTLM are all great resources.  5: This is entirely up to you but most people tend to say don't play any songs you don't like. Ideally, You probably want play a lot of songs that you like that the crowd will also know and like, with some tracks they won't know but will hopefully like in there too.  6: Bringing the tempo gradually up throughout the night is generally advised, at some point you will also want to bring it back down (going around the horn), when people are getting tired. Then start to bring it back up again.  7: If you have just started DJing then I wouldn't worry about this yet, you need to learn to actually mix well before trying to play live.  8: Have fun."

Old and basic as hell lol but all you need (works on crap XP or 98 systems)  It was the grandfather bastard of VDJ but its quick and has 2 decks, cross fader, gain, 3 band EQ, and if you find old plugins for the 3 amazing fx slot per deck, you can get really weird with it. (like hit the loooong break then quick tap a flanger to reverse and warp back the song like mad) (or get funky chops with flippin doubles and timed flanger triggers)  Also has looping and sample triggers...  ;)  Partly I kid but actually it's hella faster to browse through and dick around with than anything else. I like it for historic reasons and it's like a few megs.  Unless you have a mac, then I dunno.  There are older dj programs but they were all shit back then....  (pro tip, in XP load ACID first and the mp3 rendering improves in Atomix. I have no friggin clue why or how..)  Really tho, it's as basic and fully functioned to pc dj with and covers all the bases.

Beatmatch,3bh7s2,nikolaprof,2,Mon Jun 29 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"The first transition is quite sudden. Forever starts way too early, and you can hear the kick of it not matching the kick of the drop of first track. Second transition is pretty good, you should have done something similar with first. Similar to first transition, the transition into Bowser starts too early, I think that you should have let the drop play until it ended and than you could have start fading Bowser in. Next transition is ok, but I think it needs more work. I'm not sure how you could have made it better. The transition into Fonk is good. Transition into Bounce is ok, but you could have started it a bit later. I love how you took away drop of it and played Boneless. We all heard the drop of it so it was a pretty good idea to replace it with something else. Same thing goes with drop of Booty Bounce. Props on those! Again I think that you started with transition into Move too early, but the transition is ok. Next transition (All Night) is quite smooth. Transition into Go Down is also smooth! The transition into Invincible starts too early. You should have waited for drop to end before starting to fade it in. Transition into Big Bang is smooth. Same with the transition into drop of Dark Warrior. Next transition is good as well. The transition into Skyline is not that good. It needs more work. The transition into Outside is quite well, but I would prefer if you played that really awesome melody of Skyline. I love it a lot! I don't like the transition into We Found Love, I think there might be a keyclash there. I love the fact that you opened and closed the set with something more melodic and uplifting.  Just pay more attention to phrase matching. Most of the time you don't want to be fading intro of one track during the drop of another. You should wait for drop to finish and then start fading in the intro. Also these are all my opinions and I'm not expert. Props on playing 19 tracks in little over 30 minutes. I'm sure that if you had some live listeners they would enjoy mix this interesting! Also thanks for leaving feedback on my last weeks mix."

The mash- up of bonobo and Jon is really interesting but i think it would of worked better with a A cappella version of Jon. At the moment it just sounds like two tracks playing rather then a considered mash up.  The transitions could be smoother as well. Particularly when the vocals on the RH Factor just fade out, rather then end. It sounds like more of a medley of songs then a mix. I think i you took more time for the songs to change it could be really good. The change between paris and bogore is particular strong. However, not bad for a first mix."

Not that nosebleed berghain stuff (that's next in line for me).  So this is a first mix I think somehow crosses the threshold to passing for a further criticizing.  I've been spinning records for two years in my living room.  I think phrase mixing could go better in this mix but most fails are at the end of the mix. At about 34:30 I bring in a track that is a bit off tempo. When I attempt to fix that needle jumps and thing get worse. Usually I stop recording if this happens but now I just want some input from others, so I keep going. The last mixing in between Shed and Sequential Circuits doesn't go too well, it's a bit of a anticlimax and I hope you'd tell me what's better for that. Those tracks are hard to just fade in fade out.

Guessing it wasn't key-matched throughout, but you're mixing garage, so that's a good thing.   Mmmph.  That Lights Down intro.  Well, that got my favourite.   Going into Colour My Heart and then into ZHU was a little messy too, I thought. Great mix nevertheless. I'd be interested to know how much prep went into it, or if it was off-the-cuff, and what you mix on?  Wonder if you've heard this; thought of it when Piano Hand came on."

All in all seems like you achieved what you were looking for in this, keeping it at a nice tempo with smooth transitions.   Obviously the transitions can't be too crazy but I felt you kept them interesting still, and avoided any clashing between keys with all those chords floating around which is impressive!  Favourite transition was the one into Like A Child, that synth line really felt like it was part of the MJC track and blended really well. Also, going into Thin Lines was nice how you took it down with the filter then brought it back up with the new track.  From Monkey wrench into Loneliness felt there was maybe too much cymbal clash between the two tracks which made it feel a little messy.  Overall very nice, some nice tracks in there too. Would like to listen to this on a sunny drive or whilst BBQing out in my garden haha!"
Beatmatch,3bh7s2,Kameniev,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can't help but agree with what you said. The cymbal there was one EQ I'd change if I did it again, same into Kidnap Kid, when I looped the previous drum, I'd have liked to taper the low in a bit sooner. Funny how into the MCDE remix I did hardly any EQ and it was really quite brash/clashy, but since it was a bit of a melancholy track that kind of what I was aiming for."

Kendrick Lamar - King Kunta 61:32 Big Sean/Bobba Shmurda - IDFWU (Cavalier Remix) 64:00 I dropped the second song at the ""by the time you hear the next pop"". Does it sound fluid? Was it off?

With this time limit, you're going to want to make sure you have the best bits and pieces of the tracks you choose all cued up or at least mentally noted. Choosing tracks is a beast in itself, you already mentioned Baltimore/Jersey Club, so dig for some bangers or whatever you want, and memorize them.

Beatmatch,3besrp,pillburt,11,Sun Jun 28 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"Was the dance floor filled or filling up throughout your set? That's what matters. If it wasn't, you should have tried to change things up a bit. Otherwise your practicing the definition of insanity, trying the same thing and expecting different results.   Also, you have no leverage to say anything about requests if there aren't a serious amount of dancers. So be careful about when you use the phrase ""I don't do requests"", people better be having a blast while you say it. If The dancefloor is going and someone request something not in the tempo range at all, I'll be honest and tell them that. ""that's too slow right now. I might work it in later tonight though that's a dope song. Thanks""  You could have played a track you know would get them on your side. Promoter and owner wouldn't do anything with one track they don't expect. If it doesn't work great you go back,  and if they go crazy any non promoter with half a brain will be glad you broke the rule.   You need the crowd on your side before you can lead them to where you want to go. They were explicitly telling you what kind of tracks get them on your side."

But the problem is that only one or two people liked the songs getting requested, and what I needed was to build back up to get the whole club bumping.   Some of the songs being requested weren't just bad- they were wrong. I wasn't given room to play country or gangsta rap. But they wanted 60 bpm ghetto booty music or country. I can't do those period- I would be fired on the spot. It's a dance club, the people shouldn't have even requested it.  I got a good dance group going for the size of the crowd, and they looked like they danced until they tired out and then danced more, so we definitely had people enjoying the music.

A lot of people choose Serato over Traktor for mixing in those genres because Serato has deep roots with turntablist DJs from the early-mid 2000's. Traktor is just as capable, so really it's a matter of preferred interface and controllers and mixers. Traktor has a different set of FX but I use them a lot across all genres to help color sounds for transitions. As far as the genres you spin, it shouldn't be hard to mix genres, just certain combinations of songs. Make sure you analyze your keys and BPMs, in the jazzier stuff it gets really hard to blend sometimes."
Beatmatch,3beuvr,jerseysnub,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:47:15 2015 UTC,It's your genre choice. Beatgrids tend to be pretty shitty unless you're dealing with perfectly quantized music and especially 4 on the floor house beats.  Nu Jazz and neo soul tends to be more syncopated and sometimes uses live drummers so the autogridding can't really handle that.

It's better than MixCloud in that you can host individual tracks too if you also produce, and your users can download your mixes from the site.  It's better than SoundCloud because there are no upload restrictions (Free users are limited to 10000 plays on all their tracks and 5000 downloads). Also their Pro subscriptions are much less expensive. They have built in import tools for SoundCloud and MixCloud so you don't even have to type everything like your tracklists in again.   The only downside I've found so far is simply the lack of users at this time. I've only found a couple of my favourite artists to follow on there and the user base is a fraction of what SoundCloud and MixCloud are. But if you guys join and also tell all your friends... wink wink"

If your computer doesn't have that, get a soundcard or try recording direct in your dj software if it supports it.  Don't clip.  Find the loudest track you have and ensure it hits right below the clipping point.  That's the loudest your should play.  Use your meters to ensure you don't go louder.  If you need more volume, maybe add is little bit (and I mean a little bit) of compression of limiting to boost the overall volume of the finished mix, but nothing more than a db or two of gain reduction."

You're going to play most songs their full length so for 5 hours you're only going to play about ~100 songs anyway.  You might want to start with some background noise music at the beginning for an hour or so maybe even just on autoplay.  Top 100 is good plus the greatest songs from each decade and then the most popular and approachable dance music.  Get clean versions.

There is just so much wrong with this response from the question asked.  Let's look at the question ""Once you know how to beatmatch without using the BPM display, is there any real reason to not use it?"".  If you can beatmatch by ear, there is no need to use the BPM display.  If you need to use the BPM counter and you ""know"" how to beatmatch, then chances are you need more practice beatmatching.  This is by no means anti-BPM or sync or whatever.  DJ however you want, just have fun or don't."
Beatmatch,3bb2oj,DJSpekt,2,Sat Jun 27 18:57:40 2015 UTC,"After you can beat match by ear, the BPM is no longer a handicap, but a planning tool.  You can start putting sets together by creating playlists that will stay within a bpm range, but cross genres."

The dancefloor's mood varies, not too much of a peak or drop in mood.   DJ B uses his controller, uses the sync button. He uses the extra time to occasionally do something creative DJ A can't do... but for the most part he uses the extra time technology has brought him to read the crowd a bit more, and to spend more time picking out the perfect records for the net hour or so. He's more concerned with the programming than beatmatching, so the dance-floor goes off.   Obviously B is better than A. People are heavily affected by programming music.

My favourite way is to get an old disco/rock song and mash it up with a really really sick bassy drop so myself and the crowd get a feel for the sound system while hearing a song they are all familiar with. This then mellows out for the big energy build to recommence throughout the rest of the set.  Alternatively I will start with a weird buildup (skipping the intro beats) that may somehow be relevant to the event/tone of the corwd.  It is something I put a lot of thought in as it is the first impressions that make you assess a DJ. I like seeing DJs have a big entrance."

Beatmatch,3ba5c9,tomjarvis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. About the dancefloor bit, these events are more casual as the bride/groom are personal friends of mine. I only bring up the professional bit after reading VDJs FAQ which states if you are being paid to be a DJ with their software you need to buy the 'proper' license.  Regarding the interface between the two I personally think they are equal. Yes, VDJs RED/BLUE waveforms may not look as professional but otherwise everything else runs very smoothly.  Regarding the FX, while the default on VDJ may be initially behind Serato, having a license allows you to download community made FX. For Serato, you get what you get unless you pay for more.  Lastly, regarding the high standard, this seems to be typical mentality when it comes to Serato. What is your personal experience with Serato (how long have you used it, what gigs, any other taking points)?Also, have you ever used VDJ Pro 8?  Again, thanks for your input."

The options allow for more flexibility in how your workflow is set up. Don't like side by side waves? Disable it. Want them going vertically? Do it. Need to zoom out so you can see more of the song? Go for it. Want the color of the wave to change with your EQing? Just toggle it."

Practice means that you can hear when it's slipping out of phase and you can quickly correct it so it's all back in line.   If you're off by a beat and you know where you need to get back in, then beatjump so you're back into phase. Otherwise filters, FX might be able to mask it. Nothing is perfect in a live setting and a few cockups that don't kill the vibe are totally fine."

If you can afford a NI Kontrol S2 or the DDJ-SB I would definitely prefer those over the CMD Studio 4A but depending on country the Studio 4A is usually always cheaper.  I personally went with the 4A over the Mixtrack Pro 2 or other recommended beginner controllers just as I don't plan on upgrading for a bit due to financial reasons and I thought the Studio 4A looked a lot more professional than the other similarly priced controllers, and we all know how much image comes into things trying to get gigs or parties from people who couldn't tell their Pioneer from their NativeInstruments.  Any questions on the CMD Studio 4A I'd be glad to answer."
Beatmatch,3b9z5i,iScopedThePope,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"Hey!  Thanks for your help and advice. I do have a few questions about the Behringer CMD Studio 4a since im thinking if buying it. Ill just umber the questioms and if you could answer them at your leiaure that would be amazing.   How is the overall build quality of the controller? Would it require a case for protection? Is it missing any major functions that a Pioneer or more well known brand would have. I read a review and someone said the only thing it is missing is a master gain slider, is that true? How are the platters and how are the buttons? The buttons appear to have a nice tactile feel. Is it worth the $50 difference to buy the Behringer instead of the Pioneer DDJ-SB which js $50 more.   Thanks for your help!"
Beatmatch,3b9z5i,iScopedThePope,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"Okay no problem! I'm currently using the Studio 4A with Traktor as that's my software preference.   1 - I like the build quality. Yes it is plastic mainly but it feels sturdy. There is very little give in the controller no matter where you press on it, even with a decent amount of force. If I were to be transporting it regularly then a case is a must have for all controllers I believe, they aren't built like high-end CDJ's or Mixers, at least not at this price. 2 - The Studio 4A does have a master gain knob, located at the top right of the controller. It doesn't, however, have individual gain knobs for each channel. As a Traktor user if I really have to trim gains for a track (usually I wouldn't have to as Traktor's auto-gain is nearly always spot on) then I simply use the trackpad and do it in the software. You could always set up the mapping to be able to do it too! The only other thing I personally miss on it is a mic in line (it does have headphone in of course). Anything else it's missing I could map out in Traktor. 3 - I don't have much experience with platters on other controllers or CDJ's but from what I've heard, you wouldn't be doing a lot of scratching on the Studio 4A. The platters move with very very little force and with even a small bit of force in the spin they don't come to a stop very quickly.  Other than for scratching they are completely fine for beatmatching and skimming through a cued track, very large and responsive (although they do tend to fingerprint like a motherfucker). 4 - If I'm completely honest, if you can afford the DDJ-SB then go for it, but if you can't afford it or its too much of a stretch budget wise then the Studio 4A is fine in my opinion. Both are beginner controllers and neither of them are going to last you if you want to DJ seriously, you know best whether the extra $50 is worth it to you, personally for me it wasn't.   Glad I could help!  EDIT: I know it's difficult to describe platter feel to someone over the internet so if that is a bit vague for you I can record a close up video of it if you'd like, wouldn't take me long."

Don't you have your Mixtrack connected to a mixer via RCA to 1/4inch cable and it connected to the computer via usb? Then you would just use whatever outs are on the mixer and take that to the speakers.   Also what kind of Speakers do you have (brand, model, etc)? I noticed that you said you spent 350 on them, was it 350 each or 350 for the two of them?"
Beatmatch,3b78cw,TLKPartyPanda36,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"In response to you and dj_soo, I have the output coming straight out of the laptop because the laptop has it's own audio software interface that I wanted to utilize. The speakers are also mackie 15s, not the best brand, but I'd figure they would at least last 2 hours of playing out of the box."
Beatmatch,3b78cw,dj_soo,3,Fri Jun 26 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"Using your laptop 1/8"" outs you're using a noisier signal which is a lower quality than even the rca outputs.  Not to mention the increased noise you'd get from all those adapters.  The mixtrack is designed with its own audio interface which will not only sound better, but have less latency than your onboard soundcard.  There is absolutely no reason to use your laptop soundcard over the mix track's in DJing.  And yes, even cheap speakers shouldn't cause issues a few days into owning them unless you were running your signal way too hot.  Go take it in and have it repaired under warranty - yu may have gotten a lemon."
Beatmatch,3b78cw,dj_soo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:31:21 2015 UTC,It's still under Amazon's warranty so I'm receiving a replacement free of charge. Thank you for the advice.
Beatmatch,3b78cw,dj_soo,3,Fri Jun 26 20:34:53 2015 UTC,make sure you understand how gain staging works and ensure you don't have any clipping anywhere between the software to the speakers.  I also highly recommend you grab a small-sized mixer to run between your mixtrack and your speakers.  Balanced outs will eliminate potential noise when running cables longer than 10' and the mixer will give you additional headroom and volume since the mixtrack pro tends to be a little quiet due to it being USB bus powered.  One of these will set you back $40:  http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/502.aspx  and a pair of these cables will cost $20:   http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=115&cp_id=11509&cs_id=1150902&p_id=4764&seq=1&format=2

Beatmatch,3b6k6z,sicktwisted,5,Fri Jun 26 11:23:08 2015 UTC,I'm not experienced in scratching. But i managed to find 2 1210's in good condition for 600€ (with cartridges) and i love them.   Brand new run for ~700€ each.  I heard Vestax PDX are an option for scratching.
Beatmatch,3b6k6z,Saucette,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"Vestax PDX are outstanding for scratching. The way this was demonstrated to me was that just using bog standard stanton carts, I could not get the needle to skip, even when trying to by violently flinging the record about. Vestax pioneered the straight arm technology back in the 90's and they really did discover something good. Cannot recommend highly enough. Owned a pair since '98 and they still work like a dream. Have also owned 1210's and still rate the Vestax better."

Beatmatch,3b6k6z,Saucette,3,Mon Jun 29 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"The Reloop is a Super OEM turntable, but there are a couple of different models of those and that's the lower end one. If you can stretch to the RP-6000 that will be better as that's based on the same Super OEM deck as the Stanton STR8-150 and several other high end decks.  Likewise with the Audio Technica. Even though the torque is listed as 1.6 Kg, which is 0.1 higher than the Technics 1200s, in reality the decks don't feel like they have as much pulling power as the 1200s. Perhaps that's due to the way the torque is measured, as I think it's measured when starting the turntable up. The Audio Technica AT-LP1240-USB is their higher end model that's based on the higher end Super OEM turntable from Hanpin, so if you can stretch to a pair of those, I would do that, even if it means you have to wait a month or two longer to get them."
Beatmatch,3b6k6z,SigmaTheDJ,3,Fri Jun 26 11:32:33 2015 UTC,"Regarding the torque, one thing to always check is how they got their measurement. i can't remember the number for Techs off hand but it is constant, so while it is spinning.  A lot of other tables, Super OEM included list starting torque. So sure the number is way higher. Apples to oranges. Super's do have stronger motors though, but the numbers aren't a 1:1 comparison."

Beatmatch,3b6k6z,SigmaTheDJ,2,Fri Jun 26 11:51:59 2015 UTC,"All 3 will have similar performance. The Stanton and the Reloop decks use the same motor I believe - not sure about the Audio Technica, but the on-paper specs are basically the same.  I would go for the Stantons. I prefer the design and the layout of the controls, with the dual start/stop buttons which are useful if you have your decks turned battle style."
Beatmatch,3b6k6z,junglizer,2,Fri Jun 26 12:01:25 2015 UTC,I'd check on what they are all made of. I know the Audio Technica has at least a metal top. I personally don't really like the lower end Stantons as they are quite plasticy.
Beatmatch,3b53s6,comicstix,5,Fri Jun 26 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"It will fluctuate.   the general mentality is to meet somewhere in between, so for your example around 118.

It's completely up to you, you have that freedom."

Beatmatch,3b53s6,veganic,5,Fri Jun 26 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"Bring that 117 up to 118 and meet in the middle.  If you have a 120 trying to work in a  125 maybe pick 123...build the tempo UP through the set, then on a breakdown a couple songs in bring in a 118 and start building up again.  You have to build it up and break it down and do it over and over."
Beatmatch,3b53s6,_Marak_,2,Fri Jun 26 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"There are various ways to handle this.  If you're playing a track that's 117 and your next track is 119, you could slow down the 119 to 117, but then obviously if you do that with every track you're going to limit what songs you can play and the tempo is going to remain the same throughout the mix/gig, which is not a good thing IMO, unless your set is really short and then you can get away with it.  One way to do it is to nudge the BPM of the track that's playing up. You can move the pitch slider up in tiny increments over the course of the track so you don't suddenly get a noticeable bump in speed. That way you could mix a 117 BPM track in, let it play and gradually speed it up to 119, then mix your 119 track in.  Also, you don't have to beatmatch every track. You can use power downs, spinbacks, echo outs, fade outs or whatever to go out of one track into the next."
Beatmatch,3b53s6,informationscientist,2,Fri Jun 26 11:38:42 2015 UTC,"don't hesitate to experiment. listen to mixes by Eat Static, he will blow your mind what songs and which tempos you can actually mix together in one perfect set. like /u/lpilky said, you have the freedom."
Beatmatch,3b53s6,tomjarvis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"Generally, you'll want to slowly increase or decrease the tempo of the current track playing to match the tempo of the next track on deck, before you put the next track on.  Beatmatching doesn't mean always playing at the same speed, it means keeping the music that is currently playing at the same speed.  For your example I would suggest the following technique:  Towards the end of 117 bpm track ( maybe in a buildup ), increase the tempo to 118 bpm. Cue up the 119 bpm track and slow it's tempo to 118 bpm. Then mix the tracks."
Beatmatch,3b53s6,1001lee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:47:53 2015 UTC,"beatmatching is only partially related to BPM.  it has more to do with the rhythmic structures aligning within patterns.  the phrasing, that is, the little sets of 4, 8, 16, 32 beats and how the two tracks phrasings interact on the same rhythmic foundation, is beatmatching - matching the beats.  it helps to know the tempos, but a track with 8/7 or 6/8 timing or whatever could mix into a 4/4 track at a different bpm that you'd have to calculate the pitch percentage changes for.  cutting beats or hats or a synth in rhythmically to make the listener psycho-acoustically join the the tracks together to then drop the new beat/tempo in for effect is useful.  keeping sync locked at a bpm for 45 min, god forbid a night, is horrible."

Beatmatch,3b5jem,dp6194,4,Fri Jun 26 03:37:26 2015 UTC,Find a way to get behind the decks before your gig. The feel is completely unlike a controller and it takes a bit of breaking in. There isn't any way to mentally prepare for it. I say this because trainwrecking your first gig is a bad idea. Good luck.
Beatmatch,3b5jem,Bag3l,2,Fri Jun 26 07:53:58 2015 UTC,"Firstly Congrats on your first gig! Don't worry maybe have a beer or 2 to calm the nerves, but most importantly have fun and if you make mistakes it's normal, brush it off and keep going!   I use an S4 just because I can't afford anything more, but I have had the chance to use CDJ 2000 nexus with the DJM 900 nexus. What I did was I just youtube'd any videos I could find of people using and explaining what the functions on CDJ's do. It'll help a lot and make the transition easier, also just imagining the setup like a bigger controller helped me out (I'm assuming you use a controller).  I'm no expert obviously and anyone can correct me if I'm wrong but you can connect the CDJ's to Traktor via HID function on the equipment, you're going to need a powered USB hub preferably. The link below explains how to do HID  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvdlIPPzhwA  As for relying on the beat countdown feature, I can relate to that for sure, but I really suggest just making sure you don't rely on it too much just make sure you can counter any problems and be prepared.    Also what I did was I downloaded rekordbox and set up a fair amount of tracks and analysed it to have as a back up on memory sticks, I suggest you do the same to cover all your angles, have spare cables, ethernet cable.   I'm not too sure on effects, again leading back to my original point, check on youtube, just watch videos to learn and understand the CDJ and DJM. Get there early, and make sure you're good to go and familiarise yourself with everything. Good luck! Let me know if I can help in any other way"

Beatmatch,3b4zw7,SigmaTheDJ,5,Fri Jun 26 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Here's a few things that I like to hear in a mix: -   A nice intro. It doesn't have to be a full on multitracked sample-laden beast of an intro, but I like it when mixes have an intro instead of the first song just starting to play. A decent level of technical skill and variation in technique. For instance, if I'm listening to a hip-hop mix, I don't just want to hear the same basic ""turn down the bass on one track, overlap a few bars of both tracks, on to the next track"" blends done throughout. An interesting track selection. Obviously ""interesting"" is one of those ""in the eye of the beholder"" things, but I like it when I hear a few songs that are new to me cos the DJ hasn't just chosen the obvious tracks. A theme. Not every mix needs to have a theme, but if you can come up with a good theme, that can be cool. For instance, you could make a hip-hop mix of tracks that were all produced by DJ Premier and you could include more well-known tracks with ones that are lesser-known, or remixes that Premier did that people rarely hear. Good sound quality! It should go without saying, but I've heard a lot of mixes over the years where the sound quality is bad. That includes having an overall volume that's too low, a mix that's clipping and distorted, poor control of the levels between tracks so the volume is all over the place, buzzing/humming in the background of the mix, a mix where the quality is variable as the DJ has used some really low quality MP3s in places and they stand out, plus I've heard the odd mix that was recorded in mono. Also, some mixes can be ruined because the DJ has attempted to master the mix and they've made a mess of it. Good flow. If you're pre-planning a mix you can tweak the track listing if certain songs don't sit right in the mix. I remember listening to a hip-hop mix where the guy played a load of classic tracks, but also in there were songs by Right Said Fred and Milli Vanilli and they stood out like a sore thumb. If you are deliberately going for a multi-genre mix that's eclectic, that's fine, but you definitely want to pay attention to the flow of the tunes. A decent length. Unless you're specifically making a ""mini-mix"" or a short demo, I don't like mixes that are too short. If I'm 10 minutes into your mix and I'm loving it, I don't want it to end 5-10 minutes later. An hour is a decent length I would say, although there's no set in stone ""good"" length, so you can go longer/shorter than that at your discretion, but too short leaves me thinking ""this would have been great if it was longer!"" and a mix that's 2+ hours is gonna have to be something special to keep me interested. An outro. Again, it doesn't need to be fancy, but the intro and outro work kinda like bookends. I prefer an outro to hearing a song just fade out.   Obviously I'm not saying that if you don't have an intro or you don't have an outro or whatever, your mix is automatically bad, but the above elements combined usually make for a great mix.  The other thing I like is when DJs are 100% selfish with mixes, rather than them making a mix while thinking ""what tracks should I play to get the most listens?"" or whatever. With online mixes you have the opportunity to do you with no compromises."
Beatmatch,3b4zw7,Methionine,2,Fri Jun 26 11:21:09 2015 UTC,Honestly the first thing I come up with when I make a mix is a captivating intro track and ending track.   When I make a mix I like to structure it in a way that it feels like it tells a story. The intro is supposed to grab someone's attention and hook them into a mix. Imagine if you dropped a mix in at something that might be structured for the middle of a mix -- then it feels like you're In medias res. Not to get too poetic here but I find that helps structure a mix.

If you are dead set on buying new, get the Pioneer PLX-1000, its pretty much the same technology with added adjustable pitch fader width (+- 8, 16, 32). They are extremely nice as well  Whatever you get make sure to get a road case, road cases are amazing & keep your stuff in perfect shape.

There were so many manufacturers of parts and components each with their own drivers and so many combinations to test against that it was a bit of a nightmare.  With macs, you have a small number manufacturers and a set combination of hardware you have to worry about.    That's one of the main reasons macs tend to be a little more stable than PCs - not because of any inherent superiority of their operating system, but because the hardware is so locked down that developers have an easier time ensuring things are stable."

I'm still in University and most of my friends bought Mac's in early 2013 and are already starting to look into upgrades. Obviously there are the few who are fine, but most of them have just so many files that they see a significant  drop in performance. Another reason is because Mac's aren't salvageable/customizable. I plan to get this Dj'ing laptop 16g's of high-performance RAM & a 500g/1tb 850 pro SSD (since evo has been known to get slower as the drive fills up. + the pro has 10yr coverage & is salvageable for any future pc builds). Also looking at getting a CPU w/ at least 2.4ghz. Fast RAM, SSD & CPU are the key to a good Dj'ing laptop from what I've read so far.   2) I'm not comfortable with a mac. I've used windows enough to be able to troubleshoot most problems and i can comfortably use Teamviewer to trouble-shoot long-distance while maintaining the PC (drivers, removing any bloatware she may have downloaded, etc). VS with a mac, where i myself would be considered a ""newbie"". It'll be a pain in the ass for me to teach her how to use it, and even worse for her since she's already been using windows for almost 20 years now.   Edit: Don't let this discourage any new-users from getting a mac though. If you're not accustomed to anything, Mac's are a really great place to start. however once you're accommodated to one system, switching is frustrating as hell."

If you're using Serato DJ, what you can do is find a track in a much lower bpm, load it on the other deck, and hit the sync button.  Since DVS for DJ only does simple sync, you will still be riding the pitch and beatmatching, only you'll be starting at the new bpm from hitting the sync button.

Beatmatch,3ayfw3,98PercentChimp,11,Thu Jun 25 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"You ever wonder why in the top 20 of your favourite genre there's usually a few good tracks from bigger, well known artists and the rest are meh from smaller or unknown artists. Sometimes they're even pretty shitty.  You say to yourself, ""Self... how do such shitty tracks make the top 20? Who is buying these tracks?""  I'll let you in on a secret.  It's often the artists (or a surrogate for the artists) themselves.  It's a little known fact that you only need about 100 or 150 downloads to make the top 20 of most genres.  Some of the less popular ones can be cracked with as little as 25! And the main top 100 can be cracked around 200-300 downloads in a week. So, for less than $500, you can guarantee your track makes the Top 100.  Not very much, is it? Obviously this is against Beatport TOS and they check for stuff like this, but there are companies that specialize in providing this as a ""service""...

Beatmatch,3axfl8,Anotheragainx2,26,Wed Jun 24 07:28:23 2015 UTC,"People shouldn't generalise, but I can explain some of the thinking behind that sentiment.  If you said ""I'm a mathematician!"" and you were there with a calculator doing sums, but when I took your calculator away you couldn't even do basic times tables, I would think ""not much of a mathematician then!"". Some people see DJing as a craft. A skill that goes beyond just selecting music. The technical side of that craft (in terms of club DJing) has 4 basic underlying elements - setting the gains, beatmatching, phrase matching, and using EQs. When you replace any of those skills with software that does it for you, some would say that you've skipped learning the basics and if you can't even do the basics, you can't really say ""I'm a DJ!"" in the same way that you couldn't say ""I'm a mathematician!"" if you couldn't do basic maths without a calculator.  Also, cheaper gear that is a lot easier to use has led to an influx of people wanting to be DJs, but it's not exactly clear why that is. I see people wanting to be DJs when they don't know the difference between DJing and production. They might not have any favourite DJs. They might not have any favourite mixes/mixtapes that they can name. It does sometimes make me think ""well, what's making you want to be a DJ then?"".  There's also a lot of digital DJs that seem to be in a mad rush. They're posting up mixes days after owning their very first setup. They want the SoundCloud followers and the Facebook fan page before they have anything good to actually entice people into following them, but that doesn't stop them from posting stuff up. In some cases, people are going out there chasing gigs far too early.  Personally, I don't care what equipment someone is using if they are passionate about DJing and got into it through love of music and wanting to be able to do what DJs do, whether it's mixing, scratching, full on turntablism or whatever. But, if someone wants to DJ for other reasons and the passion isn't really there, they are going to choose the cheapest and easiest route from A to B.  So, yeah, being someone that's DJed for 30 years on and off, I can see why people can be kinda ""suspicious"" of digital DJs, but at the same time, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

No DJ that can beatmatch by ear is ever going to claim it was a needless skill that was a waste of time to learn. That be like a guitar player saying it was a waste of time learning to read music.   The stigma is lessening slightly now that more and more big names are using controllers on the road, but it all comes back to amount of noobs w/ $200 controllers, pirated VDJ/Traktor and pirated Top 1,000 tracks of <insert trendy genre> is still super high. They don't know shit, suck ass, and under cut real working DJs.   So basically, it's a bit of an uphill battle to prove you're not one of those if you're dj'ing w/ a controller. Thems the breaks."

If that guy shows up at a party with DJs performing and one of his friends is like ""hey you DJ right? You should hop on the 1200s and throw a set down,"" you can't be like ""oh naw I only play on controllers/CDJs"" and still claim ""DJ.""  You can't say ""I'm a professional driver"" and then not drive stick.

They WANT to dance, but not to what you're spinning.  It all depends on the event and the crowd and the music. Sometimes cutting hard from 105BPM to 135BPM makes sense and they love it. Sometimes it's jarring and throws them off. You need to decide in the moment what will work. I always like steadily increasing the BPM for a few songs then dropping it back down and then slamming it hard back up. Also, just because they aren't dancing doesn't mean they aren't having fun.  I like to think of it as waves. You don't want to constantly be hitting them full on forever, but you want them to move. And you want them to drink at the bar so they make money too.  Are people nodding their heads and tapping their feet? Are they stalking the dance floor, waiting for a song to make them want to dance? Are they trickling off of the floor and leaving, or just going to the bar? There are TONS of variables, and they are different based on the scene, but there are some universals to look for."

Beatmatch,3awvau,zclub,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot of experience with digital mixers but basically you need to assign one or more channels to an aux bus (your ""mono 4"" output) in order to use it.  By default all input channels will send to the main mix and nothing else.  In an analog mixer there are knobs on each channel strip to send to each aux bus but on yours it's done with button presses.    If I'm reading this right, what you want to do is press the ""Mix 4"" button (to the right of the main fader)  to select that bus.  Then hold the ""assign"" button (to the left of the row of channel select buttons) to show which channels are assigned to that bus.  The selected channels are indicated by lighting up the ""Select"" button above the fader on each channel strip.  While holding the assign button, press the ""Select"" button for each channel you want assigned to that bus.  Moving the faders will control the send level for each channel on the selected bus.  When you're done press the ""Mix 4"" button again  to return to main mix. This stuff is covered in the reference guide on page 23 / section 6.3  http://www.allen-heath.com/media/Qu-Mixer-Reference-Guide-AP9372_7b.pdf  If this doesn't work and you keep pulling your hair out, the folks on /r/livesound should be able to help you out although they may poke at you for buying this fancy digital mixer and having no idea how it works.  :)   Good luck!"

A lot of newer models work in HID mode, that is, they plug directly into your computer and are controlled by the software directly. Although the amount of data you get on the CDJ screen varies, there is way less lag/delay in doing this. I saw on the Serato website just the other day that the NDX 500's are a supported accessory. And you can map nearly anything in Traktor."

Numark gear is fairly entry level (with the exception of some of their controllers), so the build quality isn't amazing, but if you're not hard on your gear or gigging with it a lot, it should be fine.

I demo'd the NV at Guitar Center, was not as impressive for me as the S4 though I did think the platters were neat. Def recommend playing with both at GC before choosing.  Edit: My bad, I thought you were talking about the NS7II since you mentioned scratching. I demo'd the NV as well. Again, not that impressed with the feel of Numark gear compared to NI or Pioneer but the NV is a neat gadget for the price. Ultimately for me it came down to wanting the ever-expanding feature set of Traktor vs a fixed set of features built into an all-in-one."
Beatmatch,3aw5xt,kfc_spork,2,Wed Jun 24 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, I am trying my best to be neutral, but just so you know I am the owner of a Traktor S4 Mk2. I will list the pros and the cons about it that I experienced after half a year using it on several gigs, weddings and clubs, also with different setups (CDJs, TTs).  First of all I was really hyped when I ordered it on Amazon, I was used to DJ with an old Pioneer DJM500 and a two channel audio interface. Finally my way to free my creativity with a bit of plastic and a laptop. The first thing I realized about it was its size. It feels kind of small and because it is not really heavy does feel kind of cheap, although it was around €700 the time I bought it. But that is just my personal opinion, compared to the Pioneer DDJ SX or even the SX2 that cost alot more. In comparison to other controllers from Numark like the NV it does feel alot better in terms of quality and its production finish. And it also works PERFECTLY with Traktor Pro, that's what it is designed for. I now run two Technics SL1210 with it (looking forward to buy a Z2 though) and it works great, I still make use of the patterns and if I know what music is required for the gig (let's say the crowd is into house, tech) I can just leave the TTs at home and still have a great setup with the S4 (I got myself the X1 and F1 controllers as well). The only negative aspect I can tell is that the S4 does not make much use of remix decks and that its small aluminium turntables are not made for scratching. So if you want to learn how to scratch, you won't be able to do so, but that refers to any kind of controller.  My tip: DELETE VIRTUAL DJ. Everyone will laugh at you if you tell them what software you are working with. It is good for absolute beginners, but limits you in the ways you play your set. If you buy the Traktor S4 you get a free copy of the Traktor Software and it is a huge improvement to Virtual DJ. It really is! Then start to make mixes, upload them on soundcloud, mixcloud ect. and start to earn money from gigs. Then buy TTs and learn how to DJ with Vinyl. Good Hip Hop DJs are rare as fuck."

I watched some videos of people showing how to scratch on a controller, that was the reason why I wondered if there's any controller that's worth the price for mixing and scratching. How was your experience with djm500? Should I buy another 2 channel with serato or tracktor or should i go straight to 4 channel."

Honestly it looks like your problem is learning to DJ, start watching Youtube DJing tutorials (particularly for your preferred software), I know there aren't many but you need to learn basic song structure (which i'm sure you know), beatmatching and phrasing.

You can mess with this and it will help you be more precise with the pitch.  That makes you move into chunks (like +0.20 when moving up, for example) and those chunks can be exponential as well (for example: from 127 to 128 it moves + 0.15, from 128 to 129, it moves +0.16 or even 0.17, and so on), and messing with those parameters can make this ""chunks"" smaller to be more precise.

Beatmatch,3auy99,FueledByHerbs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:22:45 2015 UTC,What kind of budget is in line with a good entry level setup?
Beatmatch,3auy99,FueledByHerbs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"Entry level is a floating term for DJs, it depends on what you want to do. Do you want to practice at home? Literally any home speaker system with a subwoofer will be appropriate simply get the aux to RCA. Do you want to entertain a room, more than 20 people? You will need to buy at least one PA speaker - everyone recommends a self-amplified speaker, also called a powered or active speaker. They don't run too much is the funny part you should be able to get one for around $250 so you were almost there with your budget. I would go into your local big electronics or Guitar Center and browse their PAs (ask for deals), the best thing about the new speakers are their functionality - they do need an RCA input which the Mixtrack Pro 2 uses, look for that and multiple XLR inputs along with aux or bluetooth functionality (which again can be supplemented with an RCA to aux cable)."
Beatmatch,3auy99,FueledByHerbs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"More help:  The thing you're looking for in a PA is the RMS wattage, there are two types of specifications for wattage in a speaker, there's also the maximum wattage. RMS is the most important because that is the average power the speaker will use, maximum wattage is irrelevant because that doesn't guarantee that the speaker will EVER use that much power. My M2000 was 300 RMS and I think that's a great starting speaker that will run you for at least 2 years as a DJ before you buy another PA to pair along with a subwoofer for the kick of it."
Beatmatch,3auy99,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'd look at maximum SPL for an idea of loudness.  Most of these numbers are lies, but they will give an idea of how loud the speaker gets.  For instance a speaker that lists 125 db will be much quieter than a speaker that lists 130"
Beatmatch,3auy99,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"what is your intended use and what size of party?  How often will you use the pa system?   How loud are you expecting to get?  What are your personal standards for things like sound quality and construction quality?  an ""entry level"" system for house parties under 100 is very different from an ""entry level"" system for a school dance of 500 or an underground dance party of 200.  You can get shit on a stick speakers for $300 but they won't sound good, won't get loud, and won't last very long or you can get a decent entry level system for around $1500 that will sound good and last a decent while but won't necessarily be loud enough when compared to more professional gear."

Building yourself a following online via mixes and production is the best but it's not necessarily easy.  Getting involved with an online community used to be good, but the days of local message boards seem to be long over.   Gig swaps can work, but you apparently don't play in your own city so that's out.  The best thing to do is just visit and hit up a few people saying you're interested in checking out the scene and meet some guys in person.  Hang out, party, talk about music, and maybe they can link you up with a small gig or maybe they will the next time you visit."
Beatmatch,3auuoz,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:30:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer here.  The only ""plausible"" idea (long distance that is) is starting by asking advice for my sets, and kinda wait for him to ""notice"" me (not the desesperate way obviously), maybe he could end up asking me to go there to see him play or to at least talk in person.  I did have a thorough thought about the traveling (the scene is somewhat big in there, and is the only city Trance is a big thing, if i ever want to play in a club that's the way to go), even tho is a bit expensive (travel tickets, hotels, food and what not), i can't make it right now...  So that's why the ""internet"" kind of way was the first thing on my mind (but obviously i know that won't get me far, unless i try to be friends with the guy, and later go there)."
Beatmatch,3auuoz,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you should keep making mixes and posting stuff.  See if there's a local facebook group for that scene and post some stuff.  Get your stuff out there.  It's much harder now then back when the world wasn't flooded with Djs, but if you keep putting stuff out there then someone might notice.  Another thing is consider starting an online radio show or podcast.  Build a bit of a following you can and reach out to guys and ask him for a guest mix.  Regardless, it's always better to get to know someone then just come out asking for a gig when they don't know who you are."

For example, in my peak hour sets I play uplifting and tech trance. 140 bpm balls to the wall dance music. High energy, high emotion, time to get down with the filth type music. I wouldn't play a deep trance or psytrance set during peak hour, not the right time. If I'm not playing trance then I'll play some massive techno, think Drumcode, Figure, etc.   It just so happens that in America, peak hour means EDM mashups - because our dance music culture is still in its infancy compared to other parts of the world."

Beatmatch,3atc5r,NerahKero,8,Tue Jun 23 10:09:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the equipment I'd recommend: -  2 high end turntables. You don't necessarily have to go with Technics 1200s. There are other high end turntables that are fine for turntablism, in fact, some DJs choose to go with those over 1200s for the higher torque and extra pitch range. Examples of other decks that are pretty commonly used are Stanton STR8-150s (and other Super OEM turntables) and the Vestax PDX series. Some of these turntables can be picked up pretty cheap used, as most people that are buying used turntables these days are after Technics 1200s, so even though there are other good options out there the demand for them isn't that great, so you can get some good bargains.  A decent scratch mixer. Having quality faders is important, especially the crossfader. There's various options if you buy new, ranging from the DJ-Tech mixers (cheap) up to something like the Rane 62 (expensive!). The Native Instruments Z2 and Rane 62 are commonly used mixers as they have DVS sound cards built into them as well as controls for the DVS software, so there's buttons/pads for mapping cue points, triggering loops etc. and controls for effects - things that turntablists are making good use of these days. Again, there are a lot of options if you're buying second hand, but you need to make sure you buy something that's suitable for turntablism.  Cartridges/styli. The Shure M44-7 are a popular choice because of their skip-resistance. Personally I wouldn't use anything else, but there are one or two other options that some turntablists use, such as some of the Ortofon carts.  A DVS is certainly useful to have, whether you get a mixer that has the sound card built in or you buy a separate DVS package, but it's not required.  You'll also need headphones, some decent slipmats, and a sound system.  If you're on a budget, one option is to get 1 turntable and a mixer (whether used or new), and a couple of battle records, then you can start to learn scratching. As you save more money you can add to your setup, get another deck, a DVS or whatever.  Whether you buy used or new, you have to be choosy. While you can learn to scratch with low-mid range gear, it's going to hold you back and at some point you will want to upgrade. If you're sure this is for you, go high end from the beginning. Not only will you not be held back by the equipment, it will potentially last you for many, many years. It might take you longer to build up the setup you want, but I think that's a better way to go."

It can be other turntables, like the STR8-150, but i have no experience with super-OEM. Vestax PDX is the thing to buy for scratching i heard.  But what is really helpful with Technics is that you can easily repair them alone, and find pieces on the web as a lot of people are using them.  Cartridge : M447 or Ortofon (Scratch if you're scratching i guess)  Tech's and vinyls don't lose value.  Once i'm bored with the few vinlys i have i will just upgrade to a DVS : buying a SL2 to add to my analog mixer or a all-in-one mixer like the 62/Z2 :)  Note that i'm just a newbie and i started since few months, only doing house gigs, my beatmatch isn't perfect...etc.  Oh and be careful as sh*t when you buy used (look at the guide on djtech), i bought 2 Tech's with tonearm/anti-skatting issue, and one with RCA to be changed.

Beatmatch,3asstb,wiscodj,6,Tue Jun 23 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"it's a pretty small budget for anything quality.  2 12s and a sub will sound better than 2 15s, but you could get better quality 15s than you could the 2 tops and sub at your budget.  The eons aren't great, I'd look at ZLX15s or better still, Yamaha DBR15s (the DXR15s are probably the best bang for the buck in that category, but way more than your budget).  15s standalone will be the most affordable but it will be pushing it at the upper end of your numbers and at your budget, you won't get anything that great, but it will definitely last more than 15 parties (mainly the thumps or behringer eurolives).  Neither are really that loud so I wouldn't really suggest them for parties over a 100.  Honestly, if you double your budget, you will get much more (either two good 15s, or two decent 12s and an ok sub.  If this is mainly an install, you could easily do 2 10"" tops and a sub for 150 people and save a couple hundred bucks."
Beatmatch,3asstb,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 23 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"What if I were to up my budget to around $1000+?  Just browsing briefly i found these options. How would they work/thoughts? Any other suggestions?  This full system  This pair of tops with this sub (not sure if there is a different sub that would be better)  Just 2 of these with this amp or this amp. I'm not sure whether I should be looking at the ""per channel"" spec or the bridged mono.  The other speakers I have looked at are the B-52 LX-218, the MX-15, and the MX-18 sub. Could any combination of these produce a good set-up? Which amp would you pair with it?  I know these last few options are passive speakers but since its going to be a permanent system, I don't mind having an amp. Especially if it will save a little money."
Beatmatch,3asstb,djscsi,3,Tue Jun 23 07:18:26 2015 UTC,"The big advantage to passive speakers is cross-compatibility and ease of service.  Any amp will power any speaker, more or less. If you have passive speakers and your amp melts down, you can go pick up another amp and be back in business.  If the amp module in your active speakers blows up, you usually need to either send it in for repairs or replace it with an exact replacement module, which is different for each make/model of speaker.  A passive setup also allows you to keep all of the active electronics in one place, say behind the DJ booth where it's protected.  This is important in locations where equipment is subject to damage/theft/whatever.  If you are really talking about permanent installation, I think most people will still go with passive speakers for the above reasons.  But you're talking about college, so it's not really permanent IMO.  Active speakers should be fine.  I agree with /u/dj_soo 's recommendations.  In general I would recommend staying away from the cheaper brands if you care about sound quality.  I do not recommend Seismic or B-52 or Harbinger or any of the cheaper guitar center type brands.  (The B52 Matrix system is cool for being ultraportable but it's not what you want here) - I would buy used EV/JBL/Yamaha/Yorkville/etc before considering brand new Seismic speakers, but that's just me.   Even if you just want it to be ""loud"" and not sound great, the more reputable manufacturers' equipment tends to be better engineered to hold up to sustained abuse.  As a basic recommendation, and assuming you play EDM type music (bass heavy) I'd go with two 12"" powered tops and a 15 or 18"" sub.  This is going to run you probably $1000 minimum.    But you can start with just the tops and add the sub when you have a bit more budget available.   I really like the EV ELX/ZLX lineup, I have a pair of the ELX12Ps and they are awesome speakers for the price.   Yamaha's DBR12 seems competitive but I haven't personally A/B'd them.   Quality powered subs can get expensive, we're talking $1000+ easy for a single 18"" box.  Even the ""cheaper"" powered subs  from Behringer/etc start at like $500 for a basic 15"" box.  FWIW you can get better than retail prices from a variety of retailers by just asking.  My last speaker purchase I made from ProAudioStar and used their online chat and said ""what's your best price on X, Y, and Z?"" and they gave me 20-30% off msrp with no haggling.  Just so you know that's a thing.  Again I would generally recommend buying used speakers from a  reputable brand rather than new speakers from a ""bargain"" brand.  The ultimate bang-for-buck IMO is buying used name-brand passive gear - amps speakers and processing equipment.  But this takes a lot more research and most people (understandably) just want to play music and not spend weeks researching everything.  You could definitely put together a high quality used system with 2 tops, a sub, and amp(s), for ~$1000, and it would sound better than any active setup you could afford with that money, but you have to decide if all the time/research/shopping is worth it to you.  Active is basically plug&play and you pay for that luxury. Sorry if this is a lot of words - Hope this helps!"
Beatmatch,3asstb,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 23 08:00:28 2015 UTC,"Id say the DBRs sit between the zlx and the elx lines with the new ekx and dxr lines being more of the mid-range lines for EV and yamaha's respective brands.  The elx will sound nicer, but will cost more.  The zlx probably has a better over sound quality, but the DBRs get much louder.  Never a/b'd them tho and I've only had experience with the dxr and elx brands.  Both sounded great and it's really more personal preference imo.  I agree that passive gear while a bit more bang for the buck, requires a greater degree of knowledge to run.  Also, if you want it to sound proper, you won't save that much money simply because to maximize the system, you'll want to invest in some processing racks like crossovers, limiters, and eqs - or at least an all in one processor like the driverack."

It's true, especially since these electronic components are becoming more commodity/cheaper and you can now get real DSP in a $300-400 speaker.  On the other hand, more people upgrading to newer active gear means more used inventory of older passive gear, so even more cost savings.   I'm not really trying to push old passive gear, especially to newcomers - but if you really want a high quality/output system and have a limited budget, or are just a cheap-ass like me, you can probably do a lot better piecing together your own system.  I think part of me also feels like it encourages more people to learn about sound, and spending the last few years giving a lot of advice to new/aspiring DJs it seems a lot of people completely ignore sound systems and that whole aspect of what they are doing, which was a big part of my passion as a younger DJ.  Like, I see people post pics on  /r/DJSetups where they have 2x CDJ2000s and a DJM900 running into a $20 pair of logitech computer speakers.  I don't get it."
Beatmatch,3asstb,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 23 09:09:33 2015 UTC,"Seismic audio gear is for the most part garbage.  Would avoid.  With passive speakers, you're going to probably want a crossover and possibly a limiter. Most powered gear has built-in protection while passive speakers do not - that will at least add a couple hundred to your budget.  If you can afford the two zlx12s and the elx118, that will be a great little system for up to 150 and could push 200.  Going to be a bit more than $1000 tho.  About $1500 retail, you you should be able to haggle down a bit - especially for the sub as its older.  If you can spend $1200ish, a pair of Yamaha dbr15s are probably the loudest entry-level speakers out there.  You won't get the same lows and deep bass if you had a sub tho.  If you want entry level that may or may not survive a year or two, you could look at a behringer system - two of the eurolive12s and one of their 18"" subs shouldn't be too much but it really won't get that loud."
Beatmatch,3asstb,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 23 08:08:56 2015 UTC,"Wow thank-you all for the help, this is so great. Just a few follow up questions (sorry for so many, I am new to this). But I found a pair of ELX112s and an ELX 118 sub for $1000, a pair of ELX115s for $800, or a pair of Yamaha S215IV and pair of matching subs for $700. The Yamaha speakers are passive though so I would have to get an amp.  So my questions is 1) which of these is a better deal? 2) any suggestions for an amp to go with the yamahas? and 3) do I have to get a 4 channel amp or can I get a 2 channel and somehow operate all 4 speakers off the 2 channels?  Thanks again!"
Beatmatch,3asstb,djscsi,3,Tue Jun 23 12:04:56 2015 UTC,"Go for the Evs - get the sub and the 12s.  Just for ease of use and the fact that the speakers are meant to work together.  With the yamahas, you'll still probably want at least a crossover.  Eqs and a limiter woulent hurt either.  With the Evs, just plug in, set the tops to high pass, set your volumes so the sound is balanced between the tops and subs and you're set.  The elx tops are a step up from the zlx too (although with less features, they're much louder).   The sub is a little underpowered compared to immediate competition, but for 150 people it'll be fine."
Beatmatch,3asstb,djscsi,2,Tue Jun 23 12:08:06 2015 UTC,"ELX112s and ELX118 for $1000 is a great deal if they are powered, are you sure they are?  All of these come in both passive and active so you should make sure what you're getting.    Don't really recommend the Yamaha 215's or 2x15"" boxes in general as they are huge speakers and generally there is not a big advantage to running these as opposed to smaller tops with sub(s).  But two 2x15 tops and subs for $700 is a pretty great deal and you could come up with appropriate amps and processing for another $500 or so and have a pretty loud system.   For this you would generally get 2 amps, one for subs and one for tops.  You'd then also need a crossover to split the frequencies and maybe also a compressor/limiter.  Many people these days will use an all-in-one DSP box like the DBX driverack to perform all of this work in a single rack unit.  This type of setup involves a lot of cabling/setup/tuning which will teach you a lot about how sound systems work but might be more than you are looking to learn right now."
Beatmatch,3asstb,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"They are both P version so I wouldn't need an amp.  But going off of what /u/hobbz said below, if I HAD to make a cut, would I be better off with 1 top and 1 sub or 2-15 tops? Parties are going to top out at 150, most will be 50-100."
Beatmatch,3asstb,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"From what you listed the EV 2x12 tops and 1x18 sub is going to be the best choice to get you started (IMO).  Once you're there, if you're not happy, you can decide yourself which pieces you want to upgrade.  It's also relatively modern equipment so you should be able to resell individual pieces without losing much (if any) money.  Keep in mind you will also need speaker stands, a bunch of XLR cabling, probably a small line mixer, power distribution, etc.  Unless the guy selling the EV stuff is including any of that stuff, which would make it an even better deal."
Beatmatch,3asstb,hobbbz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:07:35 2015 UTC,Just get 2 12s and sub. You won't regret it.
Beatmatch,3asstb,statsfodder,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"yea, as /u/djscsi said, make sure they are the powered version otherwise you'll still need to spend money on amps and processors."
Beatmatch,3asstb,S3anxcore,2,Tue Jun 23 21:47:22 2015 UTC,What about 1 good 12 top and 1 good sub? You could fill a house easily with that sound. Then when you have more money add another 12 top.
Beatmatch,3asstb,crossedx,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"Get the biggest sub you can for the cash you have right now and continue renting a pair of 12 or 15inch top boxes... until you can afford to buy a pair. The sub is the most expensive part and the bit that will have the most impact.  You will get sych a nice thick chunky sound that it could maybe even help with a ""crowd funding"" type drive to earn the cash for the tops ;)"

Beatmatch,3aruo1,doggypuff11,5,Tue Jun 23 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"I just recently moved to a new city and was in a similar boat as you. Maybe my experience will help you:  Upon arrival to the city, I immediately researched which promotion companies were throwing events that fit my style. I noticed one company that threw events from 8pm to 6am and had very diverse lineups from DnB to hard trance. I went to one of the events and introduced myself, didn't talk about DJing at all just tried to make a connection with the guy. Mentioned I was new to town and appreciated the diverse musical styles on display.  Next, I spent a day updating my social media presence and uploaded a couple of my better mixes to mixcloud, then shot the promoter the link to my best mix and mentioned that I'd love to play an event sometime. He got back to me a couple weeks later with an after hours gig.   Showed up to the gig, dropped two hours of the hardest trance in my library. Guys who own the promo company loved it.  Month later I find out the promo company is opening their own club. Got to play a couple ""soft opening"" nights. Showed up to the grand opening (wasn't playing) and made a point to hang out with the guys that own the club and let them know I'm not interested in just showing up for gigs and then bounce. During the grand opening night I got a chance to learn how to run the sound booth and lights and the guys said anytime I'm not playing I could still help out around the place. This is key! Make them realize you're in it for more than just getting gigs.  Last weekend I got offered a monthly residency for Saturday night 2am - ? Basically I can play until noon the next day if I so desire. I play once a month, and get a free monthly membership to the club so I can go any other night for free. Now I get to party for free whenever I want and get to play an extended set once a month. It was all because I made a point to get to know the guys and let them know how much I appreciate them giving an out-of-towner such a warm welcome and how much I love music. You'll start getting gigs when you realize it's about being someone's friend who throws down sick beats, not just the guy that shows up to play music and then leaves. Hope this helps!"

Beatmatch,3aqg2n,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:19:37 2015 UTC,He said he put them up to his ears though... Ain't no room for room placement in that scenario. This is more likely a technical issue.

Beatmatch,3aqg2n,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:55:24 2015 UTC,Happened to me before - was low pass though soo all I could hear was bass
Beatmatch,3aqg2n,DJ_Theo,4,Tue Jun 23 14:16:50 2015 UTC,"Self powered? If not you have the polarity reversed on one speaker causing one speaker to push while the other pulls effectively canceling all bass. Simple test: turn it up, disconnect one speaker. Bass increases? Flip the leads -+ and you're good to go."
Beatmatch,3aqg2n,Tastygroove,2,Tue Jun 23 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"You definitly don't want your bass ""enhanced"" by the room. It'll always just get muddy. Be happy that it is better now. Probably you are just used to that bad sound. I'd be happy if my room had less reflections."
Beatmatch,3aqg2n,tilldrop,4,Mon Jun 22 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"well, placement of speakers in a room can produce too much bass but also not enough.  That's why recording and mixing studios spend so much on room treatment.    For DJing, you don't really need the flattest sound.  Just something that sounds good to your ears when your EQs are all at 12."
Beatmatch,3aqg2n,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:28:17 2015 UTC,This. A flat sound is the closest to universal you'll get. If you practice in a room with muddy bass you'll not have the best handle on your filters and eq's when playing out... Under/over compensation...
Beatmatch,3aq9uz,underagedj2015,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"Visiting DJs will very rarely pick their opening acts. That'll be down to the local club they're playing in, and the promoter there. Those guys can be difficult to get hold of. Especially if there's a lot of people who want to DJ at that venue.  The two venues I DJ in are owned by the same company, and it's the same guy in charge of PR and DJs at both venues. He goes to bed, then wakes up to 40 unread Facebook messages. So you've really got to stand out with people like that. They're not interested in reading and replying to every message they get.  The other problem is that you're under 21. I don't know how things work in the U.S., but in Sunny Scotland, any age limit at a concert applies to everyone. If there's a rock concert that only lets 18+ people in, everyone in the small, local opening bands has to be 18. I've literally seen bands thrown out without playing because their guitarist was 16."
Beatmatch,3aq9uz,lexx_koto,0,Tue Jun 23 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"Future and techno can definitely be mixed between with a bit of hip hop (with future beats backing). My advice would be to go through the club owner/promoter/resident DJ and try and work something out. All you have to do is say that you will play some trance. What they care about is getting the show packed out and selling drinks. Offer them crowd draw, or helping with promotion, and ask for a base pay of like $100. If the show gets packed out because of you, ask for a bit of the sales cash. Just be polite and understand that they are not all about the passion, but more so about the money."
Beatmatch,3aq9uz,jerseysnub,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:40:21 2015 UTC,Isn't future/hip hop in the 65-80 bpm range while techno is 120-128 typically these days? Why mention trance at all if you won't be playing any?

Beatmatch,3aq9uz,jerseysnub,0,Tue Jun 23 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"Look at all the photos and ads for the poster and see if you can see any production company names, those are the people you want to hit up. They are usually the ones in charge of the money and show. A lot of those companies will make you do a ticket buy to start to show that you can actually bring people to the shows, don't offer to do that but, be prepared if they ask you too. Usually how that works is you buy tickets for x amount and sell tickets for x plus a few bucks more to get paid for the gig and everything else. I'm not going to get into the moral aspect of ticket buys because everyone has there own thoughts on them. Another thing I used to do was go during the day, before the clubs open, and see if anyone is around and try to talk to them. This worked a few times because it's usually managers around during the day book keeping/inventory/whatever but it can also be a pain because there is no way to know if they are there or not, or if they are even willing to talk.  Hope some of this helps man."

Beatmatch,3aoqbn,nikolaprof,3,Mon Jun 22 07:18:42 2015 UTC,"I'll start off by saying that the effects used in Are You With Me really killed it for me. I don't know if that's on you or the recording, but it was excessive. The volume also sounded distorted in some spots. Make sure you're using legit songs and not redlining your stuff.   The transition out of are you with me was also a bit underwhelming. Seemed way too weak in terms of volume out to volume in.  Surrender transition was good.  Too much of the highpass effect. It's overkill and doesn't sound good when you do it for every song  Transition out of Surrender lost way too much energy. Your crossfader curve is too relaxed. Too many effects on the intro into Lost.   Ending was eh. Try to let the song play out. It just kinda awkwardly cuts out.  Overall, you have a start,  but your volume control and effects usage could use a lot of work. Also, this is a really long mix for only having 4 songs. I got really bored after hearing those generic saw wave fueled Prog EDM drop 4 times in a row. Those tracks lose their commodity if you keep on playing them back to back."
Beatmatch,3aoqbn,mixloud,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks a lot for this feedback. As I thought - I used a too many effects. I will try and work on it. I agree about the volume control part- it's one of the hardest things for me. I wanted to try and make a bit longer mix with less songs with this one, and I agree that it gets boring after listening both drops of each song. I could have mixed a buildup of one track into the drop of another for more of listener enjoyment."
Beatmatch,3aoqbn,nikolaprof,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:59:44 2015 UTC,"First transition: It was pretty smooth, I think that you can play out 'together' a bit longer so it doesn't cut out abruptly.   Second transition: Smooth. The transition is a bit too quiet, some energy is lost, you used low pass filter?   Third transition: That was really good.  Fourth transition: Great Eqing, but phrasing could be better. The white noise should be at right when 'surrender' ends.   Pretty good mix, good job! I also love the song choice, I'm def gonna add those into my collection!"

Beatmatch,3aoqbn,rockhand204,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:17:14 2015 UTC,"First transition is quite smooth, next two need more work. The part when you bring Switch in is kinda odd to me, I think that you need to have better phase matching. Also when Switch drops second time, you tried to bring in a drop of another song, but I don't think that sounded very good. It's very hard to pull off, and songs need to have similar drops, which wasn't the case. Later on the drop of another song is still going strong while a break of Switch runs in the background. Maybe you could let Switch build up, and then mix in other song before the drop or even during the buildup, and then mixed back to Switch after the drop of the other song ended. At a part when cracking drops there wasn't any rise, and I was suprised to hear a drop. There isn't any kind of transition when the break of Virus starts and you start with Calabria way too early. It was a good idea, but you should have started with it at a point close to an end of the drop of Virus. The drop of Gecko is playing over the melody of Calabria and it doesn't sound that well. I didn't hear the entire mix, might do it later, most of your transitions would benefit if you phase matched better."

Beatmatch,3aoqbn,rockhand204,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"No problem mate, it really helps when someone says what are the things that you need to work on in your mixing.

Beatmatch,3anse6,iScopedThePope,9,Mon Jun 22 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"Do you think you have the kind of music library required to do a wedding gig? From what I've heard, DJing weddings is one of the toughest gigs out there, because you need to have and be familiar with an enormous, diverse collection of music. There'll likely be a huge range of ages and musical tastes among the wedding guests, and you'll need to balance what they want (based on requests and reading the crowd) against the desires of the people getting married, along with your own preferences.  It's very different from a club gig, which often has a fairly homogeneous crowd and is focused on a single (sub)genre of music. There are plenty of experienced DJs who won't go anywhere near wedding gigs, but if you've talked to your acquaintance's friend and think you're a good fit for what they're looking for, you should go for it.  As you said, mixing is not the key issue (although it's great if you can do it). Having the right songs and knowing what to play (as mentioned earlier), making sure the sound system and visual effects are set up and working correctly, and being able to handle technical issues are probably the top three things to focus on.   Make sure you have as much redundancy as possible - you need an Aux In so you can plug in your phone if your computer crashes. Get a 3.5mm to RCA cable if you have an Aux In input on your controller. If not, combine the cable with two RCA to 1/4"" TRS adaptors so you can plug into the PA mixer. You'll likely be setting up the PA system yourself - this series of articles from Digital DJ Tips is really helpful. It's also important to size the PA system correctly - the rule of thumb I've heard is 5 Watts for every person at the event if it's indoors, and at least 10W if it's outdoors."

You wan to play fairly new (2-6 months old stuff), classics, and stuff from an era that makes sense for the couple (their late high school-early college years is a good target.)  You need to be able to transition not terribly. But your not club mixing the whole time of course. For about every 5 upbeat songs you need a slow dance song.

Beatmatch,3anse6,dj_dohnnyjepp,4,Mon Jun 22 04:22:48 2015 UTC,"at the end of the day the decision is yours, but i've always turned down weddings, especially my friends. in most of the weddings i've been to the entire track selection is predetermined by the bride, groom, and dj, so as long as you do a ton of prep work on your music it's not terrible to pull off. a lot of the problems lie in making sure the equipment is set up correctly and maintains function throughout the night, especially since the venue doesn't have PA/Sound hook ups already. there's always a chance some old person trips on a cord and rips it out of the speaker, or a drunk guest spills their drink on your gear while trying to request a song. do you have backup gear, cords, etc. if you're outside will it be hot enough that your comp/gear could overheat, etc.  also one major thing that no one really thinks about is insurance. at a friends wedding you would hope you don't need it, but if an old person does trip on a cord you didn't tape down or whatever, there is potential liability for medical bills etc. i don't agree with the laws and process behind all that, but its definitely something to be aware of because it can and does happen.  again, totally up to you but in my honest opinion weddings aren't worth it. you don't get to play all the grungy dance floor destroyers that you go HAM on in your bedroom and you have the added stress of bridezillas. just my two cents. either way best of luck."

For a wedding, you have a ton of pressure. As others have said, you need to have a very eclectic library and know lots of different styles and mixing techniques if you really want to wow them.  However, I do not you, your skills, or the couple. This could be a lucrative opportunity if you pull it off, but smaller slip ups will come off as very unprofessional. Just be aware of that"

You have the chance to do a live set, do it! Your best friend here is going to be practice and preparation. Get as many tracks as you can ahead of time which you know will cater to the audience. Try to get track lists from the bride / groom / wedding party and work your selection from there. Weddings generally have a diverse crowd age-wise, so make sure to include some older songs that will get the parents dancing.  Worried about being a bad DJ for the wedding? Try searching youtube for bad wedding DJs...actually you can learn from these mistakes... https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bad+dj+wedding  A few tips:   Make sure to get to the venue before the event starts to sound test. Get everything setup before the event starts. This will make the whole thing less stressful. Probably you will need a microphone too... Confidence. It might be your first gig, no need to tell everyone that. The crowd will respond positively to you if you show confidence in what you are doing. Have a backup music source ( ipod / cd player ) in case your laptop bricks ( it can happen ) Remember it's a wedding first, your DJ gig second. The bride and groom are the most important people that day. Your job is to make them happy. Be sure to get paid. Even if it's your first gig and your friend, you should not work for free."

Beatmatch,3amvbz,respectthedj,2,Sun Jun 21 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"To find the proper point and method to mix out of you have to consider:   The elements and characteristics of the two tracks. How there is a variance in mood and energy between different parts of a track.    Just one example of elements.. deep house bass lines. Depends on your taste, but a lot of it has very unique very rhythmic bass lines. Even if the two are in a compatible key, they can clash rhythmically. I avoid this by timing mixes so that the bass line of the incoming track comes in at a time when the bass line of the outgoing track is not very defined or non existent. The moment the bass line from the old song goes out, the new one is coming in.   Sometimes as opposed to timing out the songs that way, I'll simply mix in the new track with the bass out. Or I'll kill the bass of the playing tracks bass line as I bring the new one in, or I gradually swap them...experiment, figure it out.   ...  To figure out how to mix into the next track you also have to consider the moods. You might not want an epic breakdown, but you need the mood to calm a bit, so you do a simple intro outro mix where there's time with nothing but drums.   Time mixes out so that you cut into a part of the song with appropriate mood and energy. You can use cue points for this nicely. Blend songs using a part of the incoming song that's ""blend friendly"" (an intro or break, some part not too crazy) then as that blend finishes, jump to the part of the new song you really want at the moment."

Beatmatch,3amvbz,DJ_Theo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Phrasing is key, especially for house. Almost very house song follows a generic path of 32 bars of 4/4 time, and you can usually take a 4 bar loop at the 1st or 16th bar in those 32.  House is also usually between 126-130 BPM, so a few % faster in either direction is all you need to beat match any song to another in the genre.  As for mixing it, Imagine you have two tracks A and B. Let A play.  As A is playing, I will search through B for a point to grab a quick 4 beat loop at the start of a well fitting phrase (usually 16 beats before any kind of vocals start or any instantly recognizable harmonies).   Once I have my loop, I will then try and match it to the down beat on A.   Once I have that done, I will then wait for a new phrase to begin on A, and then take my loop from 4 beats to 16 beats to match the phrasing on A.   I then wait for the drop or whatever on A, and then bring in B. Usually the drop goes for 32 beats, so at beat 16 I will switch the low end over from A to B. Then progressively bring in the mids and high over the next 16.  Once the drop is over, fade out A and let B play on it's own.   This way you get to keep the energy you have going, an have time to switch over the songs. I like to ""blend"" house more than I like to hard swap, and this is kind of the method I developed to do it. Let me know if it doesn't make sense haha"

You should be able to access your iTunes music from both, and the layout is pretty self-explanatory.   If you intend to really learn how to mix, the cheapest option would be to get an external sound card that connects via USB and mix with VDJ or Mixxx and the mouse, with the next track cued in the headphones plugged into the USB sound card, but it's pretty limited since you either have to map your keyboard or control only one setting at a time.

Beatmatch,3anjgi,tsohgmai,2,Sun Jun 21 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, these all sound like questions to ask the people running the radio station at your school.  My friend used to DJ for a college radio station, and I think he was able to bring in his own music selections. Assuming it's a not-for-profit (no commercials) radio station, it seems like you can play anything you like. Purchased songs and free SoundCloud downloads should be fine, but it's probably best to stay away from YouTube/SoundCloud rips of unreleased tracks or anything like that."
Beatmatch,3anjgi,marymelodic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:04:10 2015 UTC,"university radio stations often overlook creative commons laws, at least in my experience.

I don't know how he can get away with all of that."
Beatmatch,3anjgi,ZohnTangel,0,Mon Jun 22 02:57:56 2015 UTC,"Radio stations pay a licensing fee much like clubs and venues.

Depending on what country you're in tho, some countries have a ""native"" content requirement.  For instance, in Canada, 30% of the music you play must be Canadian - either performed, composed, or produced.  I know Poland has something similar.  Only other thing you might have to worry about is explicit language.  Some college stations don't care so long as its within a certain timeframe, others will."

If it's a mic input, that's your problem right there.  Mic inputs aren't meant to be used to input line-level audio.  The best thing to do would be to get a proper soundcard with rca inputs.  Either that or update Intro to Serato DJ and then you can record direct in the software."
Beatmatch,3amzko,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:46:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think this is probably the problem. I don't think I can use my laptop's mic jack as a line in input. I'll have to do some research on the soundcard, but in the meantime, would recording with heavily reduced gains/levels and then amplifying the sound in Audacity afterwards help reduce the noise?"
Beatmatch,3amzko,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"It will be better but it won't really be great. Mic inputs utilize a mic preamp which significantly boosts the signal.  The preamp is design specifically for microphones so it's never going to be ideal.  It's not going to record in proper stereo and it's not going to be particular hi fidelity - especially when dealing with a 1/8"" stock input on a laptop.  Amplifying afterwards will just also amplify all the issues."

This is where your selection and your sense of the dance floor (or the room) will be trained, because there is literally nothing else you are adding to the transition.  If you're good at reading the room, doing this basic 'drop on the 1' mix will still make people groove because you give a flow of songs. The quality of the selections will give transitions a life of its own!"

Beatmatch,3akvhx,brokenstack,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:58:01 2015 UTC,This is something that is easily done with the volume faders or crossfader as you mentioned. I am not sure where your decay or attack sound is coming from... A quick slam to 0 and a quick slam to 100 should not produce anything other than a mute. Set your fader curve to sharp and practice cutting and reintroducing the track with quick up/down motions. Literally slam the fader down and back up.
Beatmatch,3akvhx,golergka,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:13:39 2015 UTC,"Map one button to kill all EQ on press, and restore all EQ on release.  I'd be wary about doing that with volume because you shouldn't necessarily be mixing with volume all the way at the top, and there's no way to return the volume to exactly where it was.  Also, you can adjust the crossfader curve, as has been mentioned, and just slam it in and out with the sharpest setting. That's probably the absolute easiest method."

Beatmatch,3ak19t,NetCracker,4,Sat Jun 20 23:27:07 2015 UTC,Just use a break effect and bring the next song in at the non percussive parts. This is done by powering off the deck while it is still playing. You can make big jumps in tempo for dramatic effect flawlessly.   There isn't much hope for blending the tracks but this cutting method will work.

Beatmatch,3ak19t,FueledByHerbs,0,Sun Jun 21 09:53:32 2015 UTC,That is a pretty big jump to make in my opinion. I am not a fan of sync what so ever so your options would probably be   Add a few transition songs with higher BPMs to sort of begin the transition in the BPM  Loop the 104 BPM track and pitch it up as much as possible (assuming you are using a controller or CDJ with a huge pitch range) then possible pitch down your 128 BPM track and mix them in.    (Second option probably isn't the most appealing so we can call that plan B)

When you’re ready to mix out of track one, loop track two’s intro and begin to tease it beneath track one’s verse. Beneath track one’s chorus, extend the loop of track two’s intro. Fade out of track one’s chorus and into the verse of your new track.   http://djtechtools.com/2014/04/20/dj-tips-how-to-mix-pop-music/"

I can't remember if it's the same DJ tech tools video someone else linked to, but it's still on YouTube.  Basically it comes down to phrasing, as usual. So you have two tracks: A and B. You're playing A and want to mix in B.  So on track B find a 8 or 16 beat loop of instrumentals that can be recognizable enough for people to know what song will come on next.   Match the first beat of that loop to the first beat of a phrase on track A.   you can then (on track b) cut the highs and low, and then bring in B during the chorus of track A.  You can play that loop for a bit during the chorus to  tease people, and then cut it out to be mixed in later. Or just go straight into it and mix it in."

So don't have the tunes too loud to start, generic minimal and top 40 seem to do well for the first hour or two. Depending on where you are (Drinking is legal here at 18) if it's a sober crowd, take requests and generally just try to keep people happy.  If they are drinking, then after an hour or two you can usually loosen the shackles and play something a little more progressive, unfortunately with these types of gigs you're there for noise in the background."

I think you'll be more than ok with Top 40/100 songs from the last few years and songs like Major Lazer's Lean On, Zedd's Clarity, an that DJ Snake x Aluna George remix.  Electro house/ progressive house should be ok as long as it isn't too insane. It's a reunion, not a festival, just don't play full blown rage music the whole time and you'll be ok"

It's the only decently built controller that's still compact all the rest that are more on the professional end of the spectrum (like the pioneer controllers or the higher end numarks) are too large for me.  The platters are also my favourite out of every controller with non-moving platters out there barring maybe the Pioneer SZ.    Right now, I use my 380 with a pioneer DDJ-SP1 and it covers most of my bases but it's pretty redundant since I only really use it for FX, flip, and the auto-loop knob."

Make your first song something that won't be detected, you want to  test it on another account because after a certain amount of copyright violations your account will get shitcanned. Open with a sample of dialogue or an interview or something along those lines. I've done this a couple times and just added it in Ableton. Add 40 seconds of silence to the beginning of your mix.  Throw so many FX / pitch your track up and down so much that it's unidentifiable by the scan.   I'm not sure a watermark would work very well on its own.

Beatmatch,3adf3g,thereallazor,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"Hm, didn't think about that, definitely a possibility.  I was thinking more of adding it to the mix after its recorded in ableton."
Beatmatch,3adf3g,SigmaTheDJ,3,Fri Jun 19 06:06:41 2015 UTC,"SoundCloud partnered with Zefr a few weeks ago and so the copyright scanning now covers more than just the first few seconds of the mix.  As for your question, in Windows you can use stereo mix, which is the equivalent of ""record what you hear"", so you can, for example, play a movie clip on YouTube, record the audio in a DAW, chop out the bit you want, then save it. The best way to do it really depends on what you're trying to sample. There are ways to extract the audio from video files, for instance, and there are some DAWs that allow you to directly insert the audio from a video file by selecting the video file itself (Adobe Audition has that feature, for example).  To add the watermark, you would use any multitrack DAW. Insert your completed mix into track 1. Drop your watermark into track 2, duplicate it if necessary, then drag the watermarks to where you want them. You may need to tweak the volume levels a little and you can add effects to the watermarks if necessary, then just export to the file format of your choice.  Personally, I'm not a fan of watermarks in mixes. Likewise with excessive drops. I understand why someone might use a watermark with a preview version of a song that they don't want people downloading and playing in clubs, or with a beat that they're trying to sell to MCs or whatever, but with mixes I just find them annoying."

Most of the time you'll just be recording a small sample from a longer video, so I don't want the audio from the entire video as an MP3.

Beatmatch,3adf3g,SigmaTheDJ,-1,Fri Jun 19 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Obviously recording on a computer won't ""magically make the audio better"", as in, it won't make it better quality than the original source of the audio, but using some ""YouTube to MP3"" service can certainly make audio quality worse when it's spitting out 128 Kbps MP3s.  I can click a couple of buttons and record audio from literally any source on my computer, not just YouTube. I can start recording just before the bit I want to sample and stop recording just after it. I can record at any bit rate I choose. Your solution allows you to download the audio for an entire YouTube video - even if you only want 5 seconds of audio from a 2 hour video - at 128 Kbps. If you want to believe that that's in some way ""superior"", that's up to you."
Beatmatch,3adf3g,ChadPUA,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"YouTube doesn't offer better than 128kbps anyway. It would be pointless to offer higher bitrate.

Beatmatch,3acmqc,Discoooo,8,Fri Jun 19 00:47:28 2015 UTC,You'll either need to find the acapella or get the stems from the original artist.   Google search for either. Its going to be tough to find though. As most remixes are made from people in the inner circle.   Another thing you can try is to DIY acapella. Youtube some tutorials on how to do that.
Beatmatch,3acmqc,Dave_robb,4,Fri Jun 19 00:56:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, an acapella or the full batch of stems are released with a song when it comes out. Other times, there are official remix contests where you can pick these up. Still other times, people hack them, e.g. there were a ton of stems and acapellas generated by somebody hacking the Guitar Hero or Rock Band video game a while back. Still other, other times, people generate their own, acapellas for remixing (at varying levels of quality) by applying a bunch of different effects surgically to the commercial master, like mid/side EQ, dynamics processing, and phase inversion. Lastly, some Djs / producers get contacted by whomever is representing a given artist to do an official remix of a song, in which case they get access to a high quality acapella or stem that the general public cannot obtain.  There are a couple aggregators out there for DJs who want to do remixes, too, like digitaldjpool.com. Most of those aggregators require you to sign in with some pledge of sorts that you will only use the content of the site for pro DJ stuff, and they also usually assess a subscription fee of some sort. These are pretty hit or miss. Sometimes, you can find great quality stuff on there, and sometimes it is pretty terrible. Not sure about the two specific songs you mentioned."

Beatmatch,3acvpm,kinginwar,3,Fri Jun 19 02:08:46 2015 UTC,"The S4 is very, very well-designed for traktor. It's also not as well-built, although I bought my mkI right around when they came out, and have brought it to well over 200 gigs by now, including taking it to burning man (super harsh environment)... the only issue I've had was I had to solder in a new USB jack after the stock one started dying on me.  The DDJ has better build quality. It's also much larger and heavier. It is missing some features that kept me from buying it over the S4, such as no filter knobs per channel, and IIRC the FX controls are not nearly as well set up. You also miss out on the sample buttons - which is easily replaced with an F1, but ... I don't think I'd want to lug around any more gear with the DDJ.  Honestly, if you're rocking traktor I think your 'be prepared for any scenario' these days is... to buy your own controller and still use traktor. I can't imagine mapping my preparation for traktor into the more limited featureset of serato, it'd take too much time to do right, and at that point I'd probably just say fuck it and put my crate on a USB drive and run on whatever they've got set up."

Their design reduces the heat loss in a person's body which would otherwise occur due to thermal radiation, water evaporation, or convection. Their compact size before unfurling and light weight makes them ideal for use in spacecraft—where cargo space is at a premium. They may be included in first aid kits and also in camping equipment.

I was a drummer before learning to dj, so it is easiest for me to learn and memorize a track by following along to the drums haha. I also have a pretty good memory luckily, so I don't seem to have too much trouble remembering most of a song when I need to. Knowing the rhythm can make memorizing a melody of a track easier, and it definitely helps with figuring out where you are when listening to a track. If I want to better memorize a song, I'll just listen to it endlessly whenever I can. Like at least 5 or 10 times a day for a week straight."

That's a pretty risky move, but i want to keep djing interesting for myself and for the people on the dancefloor.  My goal is actually not to rely on ""classics"", because everyone is doing it and in the end, you end up playing the same songs everytime you are djing in the club.

I have hits (these are all hits and not sorted by date because hits always remain hits) then i have my likes (again no date required) and then i have crates like 1.1   1.2   1.* (each containing 100 tracks to remain the overview) .  When adding music, i drag my folder from e.g. dance into my dance crate. Then i sort that by date added. The top tracks are now your recently downloaded tracks/albums. Now drag the tracks you know (if i downloaded a album sometimes they dont all go in sub-crates) into your 1.1   1.2   1.* crates until each crates has 100 tracks. I also sort this by date added (because in 1 gerne bpms almost always match). This way i can go back in time by going back in my crates, but also if i dont really know a song well enough and it's not in my crates, but it gets requested, i can still play the track.

Beatmatch,3a0bex,BuxtonTheRed,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:07:24 2015 UTC,"If you end up playing a school crowd for a short gig where you get BURIED in requests, you may wish to be able to use the short radio edit versions to easily fit in more songs in the exact format the kids know. That comes at the expense of not having long artful intro/outro sections to do fancier mixing with. I tend to work around that by looping the short intro of the next song, to get it matched up, then do a fairly simple and quick crossfade and release the loop.  If you never think that's going to happen - and it's probably less likely with EDM than general top40-pop - then aim for full Originals."

Beatmatch,3a06bo,dj_soo,-1,Tue Jun 16 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"Go with the 15"" tops and the subs. I would say that even with that you will be pushing the gear to comfortably play to 300. The 12's won't be enough. What type of venue is it? Indoors or outdoors?"

Beatmatch,3a06bo,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 16 19:15:35 2015 UTC,"Not true.  15"" tops give you more low end which only really matters when you're not using subs.  Big myth is that a bigger speaker is better for all applications.  With subs, 15"" tops will just sound muddier and less clear than 12"" tops - especially in that price range."
Beatmatch,3a06bo,britty1983,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'd usually agree with you in regards to most other kinds of speakers. The thing with the ZLX's is that they have different audio modes available in their inbuilt menus. If I was using subs, id set it to Speech mode so it's just handling the mid to highs, and let the sub take care of the rest. I use the exact same setup at some of my gigs. My only concern now is the fact that OP is going to be in a flat house. I have a funny feeling that too much bass will just shake the walls."
Beatmatch,3a06bo,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:26:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying tho - with both the 12s and 15s, you'll want to high pass the tops so the subs handle all the lows. So regardless, you'll be high passing at around 100 hz.  They both use the exact same tweeter so the only difference is the larger woofer which makes a difference when you're running the tops in full range mode, but if you're cutting off at 100 (which is where the high pass cuts off on EV speakers), the smaller woofer in the 12s will give you a better midrange than the larger woofer in the 15s."
Beatmatch,3a06bo,britty1983,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:40:10 2015 UTC,"The 12's and the 15's have the exact same tweeter? Wow, didn't know that. I stand corrected."
Beatmatch,3a06bo,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's just the woofer that's different.  Most of these low to mid range speakers use the same voice coil for the upper range."
Beatmatch,3a06bo,dj_soo,2,Wed Jun 17 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"Not really.  The extra SPL from the 15s are measured in full range and comes from the low end.  When you use subs, you're going to want to high pass your tops anyway so it won't really get louder than 12"" tops and in fact, the larger woofer will be detrimental to The mid lows and mids leading to muddier sound."
Beatmatch,3a06bo,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 16 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think 15"" speakers are best used standalone until you get to the higher end gear that have larger voice coils (or use 3-way speakers).  The larger woofer gives you deeper lows than smaller speakers so you get a more well rounded sound on their own.  Things will still sound better with subs in general, but the 15"" tops are perfect for smaller parties that need some oomph l, but doesn't warrant lugging out a sub.  With subs, 12"" or smaller sound a little tighter and clearer than 15"" since the smaller woofer is better suited to the low-mids and mids.  I've been using 10"" tops with subs lately and they sound great.  Loud and balanced, but lighter than bringing my 12"" tops..."

Beatmatch,39yw6q,Dave_robb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"I can't answer that as I have never owned a mixtrack pro. But to be completely honest. More about your budget and what you're willing to spend. The sZ is close to par with a club setup, probably the closet you can get in an all in one setup. I'm personally a pioneer dude so that's what I recommended to people. I also run a serato setup so I recommend that to people to."
Beatmatch,39yw6q,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:46:00 2015 UTC,Do you intend on taking it to gigs?  The SZ is pretty impractical for transport although doable.  The other big issue I have with the SZ is the lack of software post-fader effects.

Beatmatch,39zpqd,JuzzyDee,3,Tue Jun 16 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"1. Get used to listening to two songs at once. It takes a while to rewire your brain, but it will come. Goal is to go from hearing nonsense, to hearing two distinct songs and hearing all their own elements.  2. Get used to cueing. Just fuck around with the cue button, get used to that extremely, extremely small delay some devises have. Just hit it rhythmically, try to make seamless loops by holding down the cue button, and reheating it exactly on time.  3. Get used to cueing on time. Play a track out loud, cue one up in your headphones. set it off on time with the beat. listen for 4 beats and do it again and try to throw it in more accurately. DO this for several songs. 4. Play a guess which record is faster game. Dim your laptop or cover up the cdj's. Cue up a record and listen for a couple bars. It might help to move your head or foot to one and not the other. Think of it like a race, which record is finishing those bars first.. that's the faster one. Uncover the bpm counts and see if you're right or not. Do this with new songs until you get it right basically every-time.  5. actually adjust it. if it's too slow speed it up. go back and test it again. if it's too fast now, go somewhere in between. repeat until it sounds seamless for a few bars.  6. Start doing it and using pitch bend buttons to brig it back into sync instead of starting over back to the cue point every 5 seconds."

It's hard to get the phrasing right, but they that's just another thing to work on!  If I don't really feel like practising a set then I just do that for a bit. Also helps your ears for harmonic mixing, which can kinda come naturally I reckon, but have a Google and read  up anyway.

I am familiar with EDM & house music, but I'm trying to be better in every genre. My ""style"" is mixing quickly, meaning that I try to keep the song time under two minutes, although this works better with hip hop in my experience.

Beatmatch,39xeez,CagedZebra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:08:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! The standard mix transition with EQs is my personal favorite; smooth and very fluid. Regarding the mix between All Night and Circus freaks: it would definitely sound off if I cut out the last bar from a 16 bar mix. I was also EQing and using the filter to reduce the volume of the last 'All night, all night', rather than cutting it out."

I think your mix in general would benefit from using normal tracks and not mashups. I definitely see the value in mashups and they can be fun, especially to mix for a crowd when no one sees it coming. But this sounded very busy.  Also, it seems like you are blasting away through these tracks. There is an intro and outro of tracks for a reason. Maybe it's just your style, but it seems like everything is a huge breakdown and there is no cool down."

With doing so , it seems I've put out my cleanest sounding mix to date. I'm still relying on the BPM given by serato, but it certainly is a big step in the right direction. I'm looking for thoughts on the general energy within the mix. How did it flow from the future house beginning to the big room house/ mainstage feel at the end?

Beatmatch,39xeez,NeonSeal,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"Listening now! I'll kinda put my comments as I go:  That first track is a favorite of mine, great opener (cool remix too). Your first mix to the second track was excellent, nice and smooth. Almost didn't notice it!  Second mix coming through. Sounds a tiny bit off, but I think that's because the keys aren't exact. Whatever, no one will care, it was an excellent mix. I'm just trying to find constructive criticism. All I'm trying to say is that the two melodies kind of conflicted a tiny bit.   Third mix now... Nice, smooth, and natural. It was a quick, effective transition!  Fourth mix was good, fantastic! I love the song choice too, this absolutely kills. I feel like I should be at a rave now, lol.   On the fifth song, all your mixes are fire so far. This had TONS of energy leading to the next breakdown. You can DJ at a party I'm at ANY day!  The mix to the sixth song has a break, and I don't know whether you meant that or not. It kinda kills the energy. Actually... now that I'm still listening, it was nice to have that break there because this next song is sounding on the ""epic"" side. The one thing I'd caution is that you have two mixes in a row where you kind of reduce the energy between tracks. It might just be me, but maybe if you spaced out your relaxing bits it'd sound a little more natural.  I'm just gonna finish this up by saying all your mixes are sounding good. Song choice is fire. Mixes are fire. You are killin it! I tried to offer some constructive criticism, but the fact that I had difficulty with that is a testament to your mixing skills! Keep on spinnin' man."

No sync was used, and it becomes apparent the further you get because I kinda fucked it up. I'm just hoping that the transitions were good and helped maintain energy.   One main question I have is how do you mix tracks when there isn't much of an intro/outro? Some songs just get right into the beat or have harsh intros, so it is hard to cleanly mix them. I ran into difficulty near the end of this set.  Anyway, thanks for any feedback. I appreciate it!"

This is the type of trap music i like.  i dont think the transition between the iggy azalea song and the next song was phrased properly, as it seemed just a little long until the next drop. could be wrong but it sounded off to me  the way you brought in BBHMM. it sounded like the floss remix, but i guess i was wrong. or u mixed in another remix perfectly. either way it sounds incredible!  lose energy with i want you to know, but its good. the drop bring its back to where it should be.   likewise with how you critiqued me, I'm knitpicking at silly things because you are nailing most if not all of these mixes man!  good job! got a follower with me. looking forward to more stuff."

I've been mixing for a few months and still have trouble recognizing the keys of songs, which has made some transitions a bit shaky. I'm also still working on keeping gain levels constant (my mp3s have different volumes, as some of them are from digitized records) and remembering to move gain to zero when mixing primarily with the EQ knobs. About 26 minutes in, you can hear me moving the next track into place because I forgot to move the volume fader all the way to zero.

Beatmatch,39xeez,CagedZebra,2,Thu Jun 18 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying I'm looking for things that are wrong for the purpose of constructive criticism. It was an overall good mix, but I really would've liked to hear longer transitions. A track list with time stamps would've been helpful.   First transition: Good mix but I was kind of disappointed it wasn't a longer mix. Second transition: Slightly off when dropped but it seems like you fixed it. Again, a longer mix would sound great. Also, I think it would've been better to mix this track in after the vocals where the bass kicks in. Bomb ass drop. Third transition: Good song choice. I would've preferred a longer mix. Fourth transition: Awesome cut and great song choice. I was pleasantly surprised. Fifth transition: Slightly off beat, but that might have been the highs on the incoming track. Anyway, good transition, but a longer mix would be nice. Nice track, would love to know the name. Sidenote: I really like the pace that you're going at. Sixth transition: I like the song choice. However, I thought the silence in between the tracks wasn't the best way to mix these songs together. Seventh transition: This mix sounds fantastic but oh my god a longer mix would've sounded amazing! Great drop. Eighth transition: You might have clipped during this mix. Were you EQing the incoming track? Ninth transition: Good mix, longer would've been better. Nice drop. Tenth transition: Great mix! But longer would've sounded amazing!! Eleventh transition: You cut out How We Party very quickly. A longer mix with the bass from How We Party could've sounded really good. Twelfth transition: I really liked this transition. Incredibly smooth and worked very well."

Beatmatch,39xeez,CagedZebra,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think that you have a lot of the fundamentals down, you just have to fine tune your sound. In one of your past comments, I read that you use Virtual DJ and have an S2. I would highly recommend that you ditch VDJ and switch to Traktor. This will cause you to focus more on the sound than the software (believe me, I started out on VDJ and was hindered because of it).   If you do this, practice your mixing, and add length to your mixes, you'll be ready in no time. However, you should approach people if you feel you're ready for a club gig."

Beatmatch,39xeez,CagedZebra,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:40:26 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to show this is with an example.   I mixed Invincible and Booty Bounce together using phrasing. By dropping in Booty Bounce at the right time (which I think you did), and from the start of the song (which I think you didn't do), Invincible cuts out at the perfect time, so you get a much longer, more fluid mix between the two songs.  Check it out, I think it'll make a lot of sense now. Additionally, you can also look at phrasing in the wiki."

There is a steep learning curve and a lot of your early stuff is going to sound like shit, but once you start really getting into it, it can become all-consuming.    As you're a dj, I find starting with basic mashups can get you into the swing of things, and then move onto making mashups that utilize bits of several tunes rather than just 2, and then move to making bootleg remixes where you take those kinds of cut n paste mashups and start adding your own drums and basslines.  When you feel more comfortable with sound design and synthesis, the real fun begins...  Flip is awesome for quick edits.  I can literally make a shortened, quick hit edit in under a minute now with flip.  No idea where you get replacement faders for the 707..."

I had to fiddle with the channel gain and my speaker volume a bunch, as well as crank the master output way up until I was peaking in the yellows. This pretty much fixed it. Once set up it was a major improvement. It allows you to very accurately compare the cue mix w/ the master as you bring it in. Just confusing because a lot of mixers don't work that way, and it's pretty new even for Pioneers.   Not sure if AH mixers work that way but you might give it a try."

Beatmatch,39wlvl,porkchopsluv,11,Mon Jun 15 11:53:33 2015 UTC,"First Transition*: It sounds like the BPMs are right, but the rythms are totally different in both songs. The timing was alright, maybe you should've turned up Showtek at the moment when the fadeout happens, no rythm will conflict with each other and you faded to the next song.  Second Transition: The songs are not in the same key, you could arrange the second song to be in the same by changing the keypitch (which is possible to do in Traktor, not sure about Serato, never used it). Also the sudden stop of the first track kills so much energy.  Third Transition: You have used the buildup of 'Selfie' to go into the build up of Booyah. This is like lifting the curtain to watch another curtain to get lifted.  Here is your analysis :)  BUT i have to support /u/junglizer here. It's all about practice.

Beatmatch,39wlvl,junglizer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:46:17 2015 UTC,"There are multiple ways to do this.   Just simply dont do this - use another song which is less vocal heavy and THEN mix into the next vocal heavy song. Sometimes things dont match. There are a lot of songs that i really really like, but never play in a set, because i havent found transitions or other songs that work with specific tracks. Extended mixes of tracks do exist for a purpose, they mostly have just a beat at the beginning and the end, to give DJs time to fade out the old and prepare the next song, without the heavy hook. Get the instrumental version of the song, use that, than go in the original mix that contains the vocals or use to get out of the song, mostly works both ways."

Tsunami in itself will be a hard song to mix out/in without using another song in triplets.  The second song the keys aren't the same, and what you can do is use an instrumental part of The Nights (if there is one, i haven't heard the song so), loop it, then cue in Feel so close.  For the chainsmokers to Showtek, you need to phrase properly for it to sound good. Right when the drop of selfie is about to come, having the chill part of booyah kills a lot of energy.

Beatmatch,39vw25,Mr_RD,4,Mon Jun 15 10:56:34 2015 UTC,"If all you are doing is playing the same big songs that everyone else is you aren't really bringing much to the table. Every time I meet someone who is currently a bedroom DJ and wants to start getting gigs I'll have them send me a mix and almost without fail it is the same shit everyone else is playing. I'll help a DJ with better tracks and less skill get a gig over a DJ with run of the mill tracks and good skills.   Dig deep for stuff that you think sounds good and that you know isn't being played out at every festival and club in the world. Get comfortable with different mixing techniques, if it takes you an hour to play 15 tracks you need to work on mixing faster. On the same note it might not be good to bang out 50+ tracks in a single hour either. Know when to go drop to drop and when to let a break down play. I've always liked sets that build and drop in energy.  You can also explore some other house sub-genres. There is plenty of stuff out there that either bangs just as hard or is absolutely nuts sounding that you could mix in with electro/progressive. You could also look at some breakbeat stuff that has a lot of the some of the elements as electro and other banging house genres but isn't 4/4. Something like DJ Icey - Get it."

Beatmatch,39tom6,Adklo,2,Sun Jun 14 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"If you have room to transport it (like a truck) and you 100% aren't worried about noise complaints then the PSA2S is the loudest of what you have listed.  It's also by far the biggest and heaviest but I assume you have help.  If you're playing dubstep and are ok with the size/weight/volume that's what I'd do.  If they have the ls801p like dj_soo said (or even the ridiculous ls2100p) that's a great sub, but I assume you'd have listed it if it was an option.  If you get the 2x15 sub put it in the middle of your setup (like in front of the dj table) and put the 12""s on tripods off to the l/r sides."
Beatmatch,39tom6,djscsi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm considering the PSA2S is for the frequency range.. 30Hz-100Hz (Hz +/- 3db) compared to the PS15S 45Hz-100Hz. Does this make a difference ? I want clean, club sound levels at around 15' of the speakers. Also rates are rather cheap.   PS15S 22$ (1x15) PSA1S 30$ (2x12) PSA2S 40$ (2x15)"
Beatmatch,39tom6,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"not too many modern produced tracks are going below 40 these days since the average cutoff of most tracks are around 40.  The occasional low note might disappear, but it's not going to be enough to really affect the enjoyment of the party goers.  Another sub to consider in terms of performance vs weight are the older LS720Ps.  They go a little lower than the PS15S and get a little louder and are a little more compact.  You'd want at least 2 of them tho.  These are the subs I run and I've done a 100+ person outdoor party with 3 of them paired with my QSC K12s and there was plenty of headroom for the dancefloor and tons of low end for bass music.  I'm assuming you're renting from Long and Mcquade in Canada as that's the only store I know of that would only stock Yorkville speakers and would rent at such a ridiculously low price.  Honestly, any of the options are going to be fine, but just keep in mind you're looking at a sound system that can handle probably quadruple the amount of people you have attending so factor in the work and effort of lugging around the huge pieces as well as potential noise complaints of neighbouring residents (if any) vs your desire for a couple more db or sound and a couple hz worth of lower frequency.  The only thing about the PS15S's are that a single will likely not quite cut it so I would recommend a 2-4 if you go that route."
Beatmatch,39tom6,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:46:21 2015 UTC,Isn't the psa2s the same as using two ps15s?
Beatmatch,39tom6,CRYTEK_T-REX,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:45:40 2015 UTC,No.  The pas2 will sound better and go lower as the cabinet is specifically designed with 2 drivers in mind.  The 2 ps15s if you couple them might give you a little bit more volume but not much.  The advantage to the 2 ps15s is just that it's easier to transport two smaller subs than the huge double 15 sub.
Beatmatch,39tom6,CRYTEK_T-REX,2,Mon Jun 15 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"2x PS12P and a single PSA2S sub will do it! Because PSA1S is 12"" and 1400 watt right? so instead go for PSA2S which is far more better than PSA1S. Last time when i had a gig it was about for 100-200 persons i used 2x JBL STX 835 (tops) and 2x JBL SRX 728S (Subs) and it sounded fantastic but only around 100 persons showed up for the party either ways it went well and the party was fun and the host loved it.  BTW is it a outdoor party or else indoor? If your using PSA1S or PSA2S put that sub down in the middle in front of the table where the DJ console is kept."
Beatmatch,39tom6,CRYTEK_T-REX,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, its outdoor. I planned on putting the sub under the DJ table, in the middle, between the tops.   I guess the system will run fine one a single 15A breaker ? I will add some lights (2-3 LED based) but that's about it."
Beatmatch,39tom6,CRYTEK_T-REX,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:03:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but don't put under the table keep it in front of the table so that's its visible for the people partying! 15A Breaker? Lights yeah it'll just do fine also add a haze machine if possible?

He is not hypnotic, and yes he scratches. The difference is he still makes mixtape. His mixtape a are not hypnotic, but they are amazing.  Don't get any classes, just practice.  Do it more and more.

From there, do what every DJ is supposed to do: build a playlist.  Kind of like Pandora,  you take what they want,  and build off of it.  The crowd will thumbs up or thumbs down depending on how they dance.  Congrats on an international event! My first one was fun!  Second,  don't take a gig you can't do.

Watch a boiler room of a good DJ of their style. Look at shazam's top songs in the countries these people are from.  If you have beatport pro, use the mood and genre tags. Let's say they need, trance. You could filter the genre to chance.. then filter the mood ""techy"", ""rhythmic"", ""dark"", and other attributes of tech house. I'll usually find a couple tracks I like with that formula.  CD compilations are your best friend. Ministry of sound has a ton of them and they've helped me."

If you were a chef would you be comfortable with him asking you to work on the catering line at the reception? Weddings are a whole different shitbag. I've done a few, ONLY for friends/family, and they always flip upside down. It is way more responsibility than it sounds and I didn't believe the warnings from friends till I was behind the decks at the event. Maybe suggest putting together a Spotify playlist for them and letting it go on autopilot. If they're not willing to hire someone, I don't think they'd be against having a playlist running rather than you DJ'ing.   BUT if you do want to go through with this - djay is a great place to start. But it sounds like you have good experience.. If you want to invest a little and have a soundcard in case you have gigs like this in the future - pick up a Native Instruments X1. It comes with a full copy of Traktor and is easy to pick up if you know your DJ basics.   Let me know if you have any questions at all."

This is why there a bass amps too, plugging a guitar into one of those will work, but damage it over time because they aren't built for high frequencies. For a good DJ mix you need at least tweeters and the main speaker. Though what you suggest will work, its not good for the amp.

This does change the music slightly but I think the main reason to do these little tweaks in the middle of a mix is to keep yourself engaged with the music and the act of DJing.

A lot of the times when he touches the EQs he doesn't even turn the knobs. You see that kind of thing a lot and I fail to believe that there's a lot of DJs with OCD out there, haha.

Beatmatch,39lrg7,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:00:03 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it's worth going further than just sorting by genre. If you're a hip-hop DJ for instance, you can have tracks ranging from 1979 to 2015 and just having one long list of all of those songs is far from ideal.  So, I would break things up further using crates or playlists. That way I can click on a crate and get all of my ""golden age classics"", for example.  That's also why I wouldn't create folders for years, because if I'm playing a set and I decide to play a selection of golden age hip-hop, do I really want to be clicking on folders that say 1994, 1995, 1996 etc. and having those things as separate lists? I don't see any real benefit to that, because I'm going to be bouncing around years from a particular range, not playing a whole bunch of tracks in a row that were released in 1996 or whatever."

Beatmatch,39lrg7,Dave_robb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"I purchase most of my music from Beatport so my workflow goes something like this:   Download tracks Set mood/venue/genre tags in ""Beatport Pro Mac"" software if needed Make playlist/crate for event Drag and drop playlist/crate into Serato DJ Play tracks.   To go into more detail, Ill start by explaining the beatport pro mac software. After I purchase music from beatport it goes into a folder on my HHD called ""beatport downloads"" Theses essentially are the raw .mp3 files that I can navigate to in any software if i needed to. These files are unsorted. But after you purchase a song from beatport it automatically imports it into there software. In the software you can set all the tags to how you want them. On top of the normal ID3 tags beatport has some other tags you can use such as mood, venue, vocals, publish date, street release date,ect. These are very useful for later when making crates and playlist. After tagging the tracks I've downloaded I go through and use beatports filtering system to sort out my tracks into the correct crates/playlist wether it be by genre/mood/release date/ect. Then from there I import all the tracks ive downloaded from other services such as soundcloud/itunes/ect. Once I import them i run them through a feature beatport's software has called ""sync with beatport"" what this does is analyze the tracks and try to find a match in beatports catalogs, once it finds a match it ask you if you want to import the meta data from beatport. From there I go back to step 2 of setting tags and such and continue like normal. This software, at least I think, is the best organization tool out there. It has tons of filtering/search feature. Its very useful to find similar tracks to make a set flow. And the best part about it is that its absolutely free. I like to think of it as iTunes on steroids. If your collection is small, its a great tool to pick up and organize your files. If your collection is large its vert daunting to go through and tag all your stuff but when i first started using it I set a side 20mins a night and just worked on my collection.  (TL;DR this software is magical and saves me alot of time)"

About $1000 covered everything. 6kw sound, 4 lasers, lights, generator, petrol, and trailer(though trucks will work too). We found an unused campsite about 5-6km away from anything else, found a spot to set up, and set up and had a wicked sick party lasting for 2 days.  We had no toilets, a few people complained, but I'm not paying money to rent toilets for a free event. If you're making this a ticketed event -I'd get toilets, simply out of making your punters lives a bit easier. Don't ever make the location public - only give it out by word of mouth A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE EVENT.   Now planning, if you're just using a basic 5kvw gennie - this will get you about 4kw of reliable power , then I'd look at getting a 4kw sound system - you're not going to be running it at full anyway, so realistically it should be using about 2kw. This leaves the rest for your lights, lasers, decks, laptops, smoke machines, and other miscellaneous shit.  Basic rule of thumb to consider - get around a mile of distance between you and anything per every 2000W of sound(I dont know actual figures, just guesstimating on the safe side)  Hope it runs well!

After that we put some trance and the neihgbour came to ask us to cut the music down because the walls were trembling.  An interesting repost when i was in your situation :  ""What I recommend to most beginners starting out that need speakers is to go with a 2.1 Computer Speaker system. These are self powered and while not fantastic - they are fantastic values. It's difficult to get an amp + speakers + powered subwoofer for under $150 but with PC speakers you can do it just fine.""  ""These Logitech speakers are about $130 USD and sound great for the price. You could even have small parties with these (maybe 6-12 people or so) Any 2.1 PC system will work for you but if you can try to get one that is THX"" credits to /u/djdementia"

I have a pair of Studio monitors too, Tannoy Reveal 5's.  I use this for producing but when I DJ I use 2.1 PC Speakers.  There just isn't enough bass without a subwoofer on studio monitors.  Even if you do buy something better the Z623s are great to have around.  Want a pair of speakers to take over to a friends house for a small jam? These are perfect.  Great to take outdoors on your patio and easy to move around.  They will last you a long time and still be useful after you upgrade."

Making sure you computer's audio mixer isn't fucking with output is important too. If your controller doesn't have a built-in soundcard then your audio is being altered by programs like Dolby Audio Profile.

So, you would need a full DVS package to use with this mixer - one that includes the sound card required to use Serato, Traktor, or your DVS of choice - but you can map controls to the pads on either side of the mixer and use them to trigger cue points etc."

Beatmatch,39e96j,djBeagles,4,Thu Jun 11 03:54:40 2015 UTC,You don't count a song by how many drops there are. You should be counting beats and bars. Something significant will normally  change every bar 2 bars or 4 bars etc (song/style/genre dependent) so you cpuld maybe start mixing in the drop in your next song 2 bars before the 2 bar build up to your current drop. That way you'll have an alternative drop to the song that's already playing. That's just one idea that you could play around with.
Beatmatch,39e96j,PlopDropper,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"I like that idea, so basically its just replacing the drop of song A with the drop of song B. In my understanding that is the goal of phrasing correct? To line up Song B to correspond with the end of a phrase of song A"
Beatmatch,39e96j,PlopDropper,2,Thu Jun 11 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"You should read up on phrasing if you don't properly understand it, but yes. You want the songs to flow and not clash. You should always be counting the beats of a song. The way do it is I count on every kick drum, and I will count like (1,2,3,4 - 2,2,3,4 - 3,2,3,4) etc. After you get to 8,2,3,4 you will start again at 1,2,3,4. That second 1,2,3,4 is a new bar and its that down beat that you should be bringing in your next record. Normally every 2 bars there's something new added to a track like a bit of percussion or a maybe vocals. If you bring in your new track at that point then it will blend well."
Beatmatch,39e96j,mokedawg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like get the general idea of 8 and 16 bar phrases. I guess my problem is lining up the phrases of the song at the right point of each song. Obviously I must have mixed like the build up/drop part of Song A with a non matching part of song B, which is why my friend must have told me that he was expecting a huge drop and it just fell flat lol. I think what I need to do is really understand my tracks better and be mindful of matching the phrases of each song at the correct point."
Beatmatch,39e96j,DropDP,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"This is where practice comes in. Hot cues, looping, etc. are crucial when you realize you are out of phrase. Remember most EDM songs have a 32-beat buildup before the drop. But every song is different, and it's important to remember those differences when you're mixing live."
Beatmatch,39e96j,mikeb93,2,Thu Jun 11 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of DJing is feeling in the moment. If your set is going in the direction of gaining energy,  you could keep with that theme and transition to your next song right at the build going into the drop. If you want your set to decrease in energy and give dancers a break,  let a song play out, or bring in the next song at the start of a verse. If it's a well known song you'll get a singalong, which is still exciting but can give dancers a break.  It really is mostly about feeling. Think about where you want to take the set, and do what feels right to you to get you there. Feel free to ask for clarification or more questions :)"
Beatmatch,39e96j,77ate,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:23:31 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying completely. I just feel like its hard for me right now because I can't physically see what the crowd wants or don't have any experience being able to tailor my sound to how the crowd is reacting. At this point I'm just making mixes in my bedroom for practice and while I think they sound good, it caught me off guard that my friend said he was expecting a huge drop and I just fell flat haha. I def. think I will be more mindful of that in my next mix, and I realize I just need to keep practicing!"
Beatmatch,39e96j,LeoFalto,2,Thu Jun 11 13:47:18 2015 UTC,Someone did an awesome explanation on phrasing    Read it
Beatmatch,39e96j,ozthehummingbird,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:40:21 2015 UTC,"Keep practicing. It depends on each track and at what points you decide to mix in and out of both. When you go back and listen to your own mix, you'll know when you're happy with the results, so figure out what you'd do differently next time and keep trying out different things. In time, you'll be able to hone your own instincts and timing if you know the music well enough, too - so trying to come up with an overall number or formula shouldn't even matter."
Beatmatch,39e96j,DropDP,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel you on that. I did feel happy with my mix until I got that feedback. I guess I just didn't know that I was mixing a buildup and didnt let the full drop happen.  Ive been searching a bit and ran across this comment and it kind of struck a chord with me ""Still there are some things to guide you and other things to avoid. If the track you're mixing out of has an obvious build up and a drop, you would prefer not to mix thru the drop. If the track you're bringing in has an obvious drop, you want to land on the drop.""  Basically dont bring in the new song if it has an obvious build up drop. Solid advice and would it apply to trap?"
Beatmatch,39e96j,brokenstack,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"Phasing and phrasing are not the same thing. Anyway there's no rule.  I like to make it buildup and drop once, then maybe the second drop switch it up with a remix or have a song buildup and put another songs drop in. It doesn't matter, it's whatever sounds good. Obviously to pull it off you need a bit of practice."

Beatmatch,39c339,Phorella,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's about quality of life. This guy has the potential to make good money by pursuing his education.   I'm 28 years old and back in my college days it was very difficult to make electronic music compared to everything that we have now, in addition to how much costs have come down, but that's besides the point.   I played in bands in high school, college, and currently play in a band with a buddy from work. Our band is nothing serious but it's therapeutic as fuck to get together and either come up with new songs or simply just to tune everything out and sync up and jam the fuck out.   Similar analogy with OP. He can stay motivated with school and keep bettering his skills DJ'ing and producing, all while promoting himself and doing small gigs here and there. But if he stops pursing the medical route, he's pigeon holing himself into a corner.   Everyone is different and everyone has their own dreams and passions, and I encourage everyone to follow them but also at the same time to follow your dreams within a proper risk framework."

Bought that mixer and upgraded to full Serato and just mix every day. It's relaxing to me.

Both seem to have xlr in as well.   IMO the best possible connection you have available is to go from 1/4"" from the S4 to xlr with a 'balanced' cable. I own a set of those cables and find them pretty useful to have around in terms of playing on smaller PAs like this.   Your other, cheaper option is to run 1/4"" to 1/4"". You can generally find very high quality cables for this at reasonable pricing.   Failing those suggestions, you can go with RCA -> RCA, however you will need to only run a single channel to each speaker, and that is difficult in terms of not many single-channel RCA cables exist.

Male cable = you can plug it in something, female = receiving end. Just like real life, but just so you know. I was a bit confused when I first read 'male' and 'female' in the context of cables.  I'm not an expert, but using a 2x RCA male - 2x RCA male seems to work. Those are quite common and you probably have one laying around.   You could also buy an XLR male - 2x RCA male cable. The XLR part goes into one of your speakers and the RCA cable goes into your S4. Another XLR - XLR cable goes into one of your speakers into the other so they're linked (but you probably found that out).   XLR = 3 pointy thingies 2x RCA = one white (left) and one red cable (right), just like it says on the back end of your speaker.  Most setups however, have an amplifier of some sort to protect the speakers from blowing up."

And these speakers have amplifiers built-in.  In terms of cable gender, male-male cables are usually correct if you want to make a connection, with male-female usually being an extension cable. With xlr that is a little bit trickier as the male cables have their pins inside the end, which might confuse you into thinking they are a socket not a plug, but the female xlr has three holes where the male has three pins."

With regards to funk and soul, with older breaks you have to ride the pitch a lot because of the live drummer and lack of quantized beats.  Newer stuff should be a lot more DJ friendly though.  However, with that said you still might want to do quick cuts if there are a lot of vocals or if there's like a bar drum intro into the next song and then you can slam it over.  With jazz and hip-hop type of shit I tend to blend a lot more.  Especially the nu-jazz/acid-jazz type of stuff you can really get creative with looping, effects, and all that good shit.  Also, I like to sort of ""sample"" hip-hop songs over funk/soul/jazz (old or new stuff).  Kind of hard to explain so I'm gonna post a breaks mix that I did awhile ago if you don't mind me plugging my own set.  This is a quick mix of breakbeat, jazz, funk, and hip-hop.  Here are just a few of the techniques I mentioned...take a listen sometime to see if it makes more sense.  Jazz/Breaks blend: 4:08 and 6:20  Quick funk/jazz slam: 10:42 and 24:32  Sampling: 11:13 and 24:44  Looping: 13:00"

Beatmatch,395njt,AnotherRandomDude,10,Tue Jun 9 12:52:26 2015 UTC,I don't think it is important to have the latest tracks. I find it much more important to have tracks your audience doesn't already know in and out. I'm even more satisfied when I find very old tracks (90s Techno Tracks) which fit into my library.  I'd never play tracks which all the other DJs are playing. I try to find some underappreciated gems which probably no one heard before.  This is how I build a unique image and sound in my area. People think of that unioqe sound when they hear my name. And I think this is how you stand out from all the other DJs
Beatmatch,395njt,mikeb93,5,Tue Jun 9 14:45:07 2015 UTC,"I think a mix of new songs that people know, classics (regardless of age), and tunes (whether new or old) that people probably don't know but that you think are great is the best combination.  Obviously it depends on the age of the audience, the venue (whether it's mainstream, underground, or somewhere in between), and if there's a theme to the gig too, but that's the way I approach it as a general rule."
Beatmatch,395njt,SigmaTheDJ,4,Tue Jun 9 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Good tracks > newest tracks.  It can depend on your scene, but if you're always chasing that's new, you'll have a harder time defining your sound and you can easily get caught up in being a ""song/genre of the moment"" dj (if that's your goal, then do it by all means).  That said, you still want to keep digging and looking for tracks that fit your style - just don't only look for the latest and greatest - look everywhere.  There could be old, forgotten tracks you might have missed, there could be new tracks that may take a bit to take off but quality should always trump newness."
Beatmatch,395njt,dj_soo,3,Tue Jun 9 22:24:33 2015 UTC,Tip40 / commercial EDM DJ? People are showing up expecting the hear the newest stuff out on the radio or whatever big room track is the summer hit  Underground dance / non-commercial DJ? Just rock the house with whatever you've got in your library - chances are 90% of the people in the venue wouldn't recognize a new track from an old one
Beatmatch,395njt,DJ_Theo,2,Wed Jun 10 12:46:25 2015 UTC,Whom do you play for? Is it a club-going underground crowd that knows half your tracks or just general public looking to have a good time?
Beatmatch,395njt,golergka,2,Tue Jun 9 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily club-going, but there is a pretty big semi-underground (sometimes illegal) party scene who I'm looking to play for.  I'd say it's 50-50. Half of them are just out to have a good time, while the other 50% repeatedly come out and follow the circus around."
Beatmatch,395njt,golergka,3,Tue Jun 9 14:34:33 2015 UTC,"Then I'd just refrain from playing past hits, and dive for unknown tracks instead: if people don't know them, they might as well suspect that they're fresh.  And then I just would put on 'Get Lucky', because fuck rules, it's still a great song :)"
Beatmatch,395njt,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 9 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"the underground scene is often looking for tracks they never heard - but that doesn't mean you need to play all new tracks all the time.  Just don't be a slave to the charts and find tracks that fit your personal style.  You can dig a little deeper and find older tracks that never really stuck.  You can also have your ""signature"" tracks that only you really play.  Play the tracks that fit your sound and style regardless if it's new or old."
Beatmatch,395njt,ChalupaBatman_710,2,Wed Jun 10 05:42:18 2015 UTC,"When I go song hunting, it takes me a couple days to come up with.. Idk 10 tracks? Maybe. If im lucky.  I'll scour soundcloud, YOUTUBE, and beatport for my favorite labels/artists, and listen to each song that catches my intention until I find the grooviest funkiest hardest hitting tracks I can find.  I DJ techno/house music. And I want my image to be the guy that plays shit nobody has ever heard of.  But a lot of my tracks are new. And I do also maintain a library of modern hits.

Beatmatch,395njt,timMANthy,2,Tue Jun 9 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"I think, on one hand, it's important to at least stay current on popular tracks but at the same time, if you're just simply playing what the radio plays, people will forget your name real fast.   I think it's best to mix in popular tracks occasionally that people can sing along to but it's the hidden gems and songs that people didn't know they wanted to hear that will make them remember you."
Beatmatch,395njt,BadgerSmaker,2,Tue Jun 9 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"It's not important,  but it is fun.  In my weekly radio show I play ~40 tracks that were released in the last couple of weeks from my fave artists of various genres.   This way I can listen back to the mix during the week and enjoy all the new stuff.  If I do genre specific mixes (at gigs usually) then I will play stuff from that genre of any release date."
Beatmatch,395njt,Chiafriend12,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:36:03 2015 UTC,"the more I've been digging for music the more it seems I'm collecting music from last year, the year before. Is this a problem?   No, not at all  Almost all music I buy is 6 months old at the bare minimum, often a few years or more, personally. Not by conscious choice by but by habit developed over the years. In the newest studio mix I'm going to publish soon I'm using an obscure track from 2004 because it's great regardless of age.  It depends what you're going for, to be honest. If you're playing a style where playing the newest, trendiest songs of the moment is vital then yes by all means buy the new songs (top 40, ""commercial"" house (prog house a la Spinnin, etc.) and so on). But if you play a style that really values digging (techno, anything minimal or underground, and more) then it's completely optional and up to you.   If it's any help I'm really into whatever lies between Nu Disco, Tech House and Electronica   Yeah, based on that and the audio samples you provided I'd really say it's purely optional. Playing good music first and foremost is the main goal.  Edit: I just noticed this post is 5 days old but lol whatever  hope this information is helpful OP :)"
Beatmatch,395o86,BigPurpleAki,5,Tue Jun 9 12:58:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're looking for in terms of price, features, software, etc. If you're just getting started you probably would not be using a lot of the functions on it right away.  I think any controllers with a couple of jog wheels, volume faders, 3-band eqs, and crossfader will work. It helps if the controller has performance pads to juggle cue points, launch samples and control the FX. Here are a few that I looked at when I was beginning.   DDJ-SR- $650 Numark Mixtrack Quad - $260 Numark Mixtrack Pro II - $250 Numark NV - $700 Reloop Terminal Terminal Mix 8 - $700 Reloop Beatmix 4 - $500   I decided to go with Reloop Beatmix 4 and I got it for $500 (inc. taxes). I used Serato for a bit, but decided to purchase Traktor and create my own mapping to use the the controller along side my Launchpad (configured to the remix decks). Once I feel like I've outgrown my controller, I'm thinking of purchasing a Traktor S8 and two Audio-Technica AT-LP120."
Beatmatch,395o86,rjddude1,3,Tue Jun 9 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"First controller I ever bought was ddj-sx2, kinda hard on the budget at first, but been loving it since day 1 and I don't regret it at all!  Main reason why I got this one was that I didn't want to pay for a two channel mixer then have to sell it to get one with four, but that's just my opinion! I hate buying something to know that there's something better on the market; I know they have cdjs but that's another price range. (also... I'm a bit sold to pioneer, always loved the quality!)"
Beatmatch,395o86,marugiano,2,Tue Jun 9 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say it is worth the price, but it will ultimately come down to your budget and what you are looking for. One of the main draws to the NS7's is the motorized platters. Great for a feel similar to vinyl or if you're looking to scratch.   Otherwise there are tons of options at all sorts of price points."
Beatmatch,395o86,junglizer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:58:23 2015 UTC,If you're looking at the ns7ii I'm going to assume you want full size vinyl on a controller. For that feature I would recommend looking into something in the Pioneer DDJ series they're very touch responsive and have a nice feel and look to them. They're awesome controllers. If you realize after more research that full size vinyls aren't that important the Traktor S4 has been an angel to me.
Beatmatch,394dhp,jwongsquared,2,Tue Jun 9 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"In theory it could probably run it, however, I'd say that you should probably shell out a little bit more for the pro 3 simply because you can at the very least get an i5 and more storage options.

You would not be able to use effects from your software on the turntable, as the effects are software based and cannot transfer over to what is considered analog hardware."

Initially, I thought buying a song from BP would give you every version of that song (mp3, wav, and so on).  I didn't know you had to pay extra to upgrade the song."
Beatmatch,392j8n,Heyo_Maggots_,2,Mon Jun 8 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"PN will do what it can with smaller audio files like mp3s, but it cannot magically make the mp3's .wav quality. PN essentially remasters an existing track, but since the track is squished to export to mp3 in the first place, PN can't polish it back to .wav.   I can't speak for how well PN does all of this though, I've never heard the converted product. But by definition of compression, you won't be able to go around paying for full .wavs by this method."

Beatmatch,392j8n,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"its impossible to make an mp3 higher quality, sure you can convert it but it will still sound the same as the mp3 so in reality there would be no point in doing so"
Beatmatch,392j8n,golergka,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"I think the ""MP3s are OK until you play in big clubs"" thing is just one of those memes that gets passed around from one person to the next without too many people thinking ""is that actually true?"".  As for Platinum Notes, I wouldn't agree with dj_soo when he says it's ""a scam more than anything"", but I would agree with his other points. If I buy a song in high quality from a trusted source, it'll already have been mastered. I don't want to mess around with the audio quality/characteristics of that file and I certainly wouldn't want to run all of my music through an application that's using some ""one size fits all"" algorithm to do it for me. There is obviously some benefit in normalising tracks or using a ReplayGain-type system so that they're all the same perceived volume level, but that only means that you use the gains less than you otherwise would.  As for encoding/transcoding, here's a general guide: -  Lossless (e.g. WAV or FLAC) to lossy (e.g. MP3) - Audio information is stripped out of the file in order to make it smaller. How much information is stripped out depends on the target bit rate. The lower the target bit rate, the more information is stripped out of the file and the more chance there is that the resulting file won't be transparent (i.e. indistinguishable from the original file). Once that information has been stripped out, it can't be put back.  Lossy to lossless - This is largely pointless, as all you are doing is increasing the size of the file, not the quality.  Lossless (e.g. uncompressed WAV) to lossless (e.g. compressed FLAC) - When you use a compressed lossless codec, no audio information is being stripped out of the original file. The file is shrunk down using a different type of algorithm, but as no audio information is actually stripped out, that's why you can't achieve the smaller file sizes you'd get with MP3. You can still reduce a file's size by around 50% in some cases, and file formats like FLAC have full tagging support, so it is definitely worth using lossless compression. You can convert back and forth between any lossless format and never lose any of the file's original information, therefore you never lose any audio quality either.  Lossy to lossy - Again, kind pointless. All you're doing is stripping a little more information away from the file. The only reason someone might do this is if someone sent them a file in a format that they can't play on certain hardware, for example someone might send you an Ogg Vorbis file, so you convert it to MP3 to play on your phone.  Most of my music is in FLAC format as it's ripped from CDs and vinyl. Even though I can't claim to hear the difference between FLAC and, say, MP3, I have the hard drive space and all of my gear supports FLAC, so I like the peace of mind of knowing I have the highest quality available to me. If you're buying music from trusted sources, I think 320 Kbps MP3 is fine. People tend to run into audio quality issues when they're pirating music from dubious sources (ripping tracks from YouTube, for instance), they're ripping their own vinyl and doing a crap job of it, or they're encoding to a bit rate that's too low."
Beatmatch,392j8n,Aniahlator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:54:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on quality of sound system, and while it correlates with club size, it's just a correlation.  No tool can produce a meaningful wav from mp3. The thing is, mp3 is a lossy compression algorithm — when you compress it, you loose some data, and it is lost forever. Namely, you miss high frequencies, from 10khz and up. There aren't any instruments playing in this range, but people hear them and perceive them as ""breath"" and ""air"" of a track. All my life I thought that difference between 320kbps mp3 and wav is something I can't notice, but I recently gone through that blind test from NPR, and it turns out, I can, and it's obvious. However, I still don't think I would notice the difference in a typical bar/club setup — I'll be thankful even if they don't have some bad bass resonance.  However, if we're talking about audio formats and audio sources, there's one more difference: mp3/CDs vs vinyl. And it's not about ""analog warmth"", it's bullshit; the difference is, they are mastered differently. Basically, it all goes back to loudness wars: since you want your track to sound louder than others, you bring up all of it's parts, which makes it sound louder, but loses dynamic content between loud and silent parts. For example, if you put on a top40 dance song with a ""quiet"" drop (with acoustic guitar and shit) and compare it to the main, meaty part of it, it'll be very similar in terms of volume. However, if you put on a symphony, turn it loud enough to hear the quiet beginning and skip to the loudest part, it will blow you away: that's dynamic range. Now, most people who buy CDs or MP3s listen to them with crappy speakers, or even crappier headphones, so mastering engineers logically conclude that they don't need a dynamic range this big. However, people who buy vinyl usually use better speakers, and are more likely to pay more attention to the music (whether they use it for DJing or for personal pleasure), so it makes sense keep things more dynamic and not to chase for loudness (after all, these good speakers typically have good powerful amps). So, if you know that a song has different masters, and you know they are different (I don't know how often this is the case for dance music, btw), I would certainly try to get wav file of the vinyl instead of the CD or digital release.  So, when DJ's playing over-compressed 196 kbps MP3s, it's OK for a house party or a crappy bar, but he would probably get kicked out of a club with a proper room and a Funktion One soundsystem."
Beatmatch,392j8n,dj_soo,0,Tue Jun 9 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"Like many have said, the file type doesn't really matter. Just make sure that the bitrate is above 128 BPM. Please use 256 or above and you should be just fine."
Beatmatch,392j8n,Sam_T,-2,Tue Jun 9 01:48:45 2015 UTC,"I still think pn is a scam more than anything.  Unless you're collection is full of amateur, poorly mastered stuff, most of your tracks are already professionally mastered and some automatic algorithm in a $100 program isn't going to magically make your tracks sound better.  The reason you'd want to convert to wav, is because you want to avoid transcoding.  By putting it in a wav format, you'll get a lossless version of your modified 320.  So no, you won't get added quality (other than whatever platinum notes does to your music), but you will theoretically not lose any quality by keeping it in its lossless format.  Why you would want a similar quality at 10 times the space tho, I'm not really sure..."
Beatmatch,392j8n,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"What you say would be totally right if mastering engineers were actually doing a good job those days. Or not told to do a bad one rather.  What I find most of the time are tracks that are ruined by an overmastering: clipping at every beat with extremely little dynamic range. Tracks that have some room left in them are rare.   Here, take a look at this to understand what platinum notes aim to do: http://softwareengi.com/clipping_algorithm/Undo_presentation_at_AES_2014___Leif_Cla/326419/  (Warning: serious audio awesomeness running on broadcast processors that are too expensive to even look at)"
Beatmatch,392j8n,Sam_T,2,Thu Jun 11 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the loudness wars are a pain and prefer dynamic range, I can't see this being that useful for modern electronic dance music as opposed to the pop and rock songs he's demonstrating in the video.  Modern electronic music is specifically produced with limiting and squashing in mind and adding back in the transients could change the way the song was meant to be heard.  Producers are compressing  their individual drum hits, then compressing their drum busses, then adding compression on their master buss and then mixing specifically with a brick wall limiter in mind that produces 4-5 db of gain reduction looking for a ridiculous rms peak.   A lot of genres are specifically being designed for that crunchy sound - hell some producers even intentionally clip some of their sounds for effect."
Beatmatch,392j8n,dj_soo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"As long as it is a controlled stylistic decision I have no problem with that. On the other hand, clipping on the master should never happen. It's poor mastering and gives unpredictable results. When I see it I immediately think less of the work that has gone into the song audio.  Also, as much as I like hard hitting brickwalled stuff, it's piss poor to play that for hours as a dj. You just kill people's ears and it's so tiring. I like to have the option to process a song to have some space back into it, so as to be able to use it without the squash. It may not work on everything, but when it does it's pleasant.   In the end it's just a tool, you have to know how to use it."

Beatmatch,392aq6,junglizer,2,Mon Jun 8 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm hijacking this older thread so I can talk to you directly, and this thread is pretty relevant.  I'm also a dnb head although even if i do love some good old jungle my main interests are in the dark/neuro and jump up genre. My mates that are into tribecore/hardtek and I are going to start ""organising"" stuff if you catch me. Eventually they might ask me to perform dnb sets although obviously as I never mixed before I have a long road ahead of me.  I do already have a decent understanding of the music, its architecture and how it all works to mix it as I've been in the scene a while and even produced a little bit of tribecore back in the days, I've also had some musical education on physical instruments.  I've started experimenting in traktor without any gear just keyboard shortcuts and mouse and I'm starting to get it a bit and even made a small mix which sounds OK but only because I'm using all the crutches available and preparing everything in advance, so it's not really improvised whatsoever.  I'll stop the rambling and get to my core questions, I'm only starting and even though I know I love the music and the scene, I realise I might not be cut out for mixing so don't want to drop 2k€ straight up, I need to learn first so I'm gonna get a controller. I'm thinking of getting either a traktor s2 or a pioneer ddj SB (for that second option I could get it new and have it cost me sort of nothing as I have vouchers I can spend in the shop), what's your opinion on using the pioneer with traktor, how much better would it be to use real NI gear?   Secondly I have questions regarding sync and how to mix, I have very little experience beat matching by ear and have to admit that the few times I tried it seemed pretty fucking hard, my practical and technology inclined mind was instantly attracted to beat gridding my tracks, finding the best phrase matches, cueing up my tracks and starting them on my prepared cues using sync before using the knobs, filters and volume faders to mix the tracks in and out and match the drops etc (including double drops and other variations like launching the drop from another track straight away when there is a small resting time in the previous track, not sure how to call this). This has wielded results very fast and using this I was able to get stuff to sound pretty decent even though I have little experience. Do you feel this is cheating and/or a bad way to learn?  Besides I'm not even sure how I could do this by ear, do you first adjust the BPM in the headset using an active part of the track then place it back to your cue, and press play at exactly the right time? That sounds kinda weird to me considering even a very small delay in pressing play will mess up the whole thing?   OK I'm realising I've made a wall of text again and am rambling (I tend to do that..), I'm on vacations right now away from home but will be back next week, would you be interested in talking more with me, even possibly on Skype or something? I would love to get insight from someone who actually plays drum and bass, I might eventually even be willing to compensate you for it?"

Beatmatch,392aq6,obi21,2,Wed Jun 17 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"Don't really need a specific controller for DNB/Jungle, if anything something more minimal would be better because you won't need a lot of effects or other frills with DNB mixing.  Maybe something with 4 channels so you can get into 3 deck mixing.  Just know that a lot of DNB promoters/DJs are really against the controllers.  It's not totally warranted and I wouldn't really worry about it unless you wanna get right into playing at local DNB nights.  But I know a lot of promoters that won't let you bring in a controller and you're expected to be able to use the club standard CDJs/Turntables.  That being said with your budget you wouldn't be able to get a CDJ setup (used 850 set & basic 2 channel mixer is about 700€), so I'd recommend getting a really basic controller with a decent pitch fader and platters and turn off all the BPM Counters/Wave forms and learn to beatmatch manually, that way you can transition to club standard gear with little to no effort.  The two controllers you linked would be less ideal for this, so I'd recommend at least saving enough up to get a Mixtrack Pro or equivalent"

Beatmatch,38x04s,dj_soo,2,Sun Jun 7 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"Back in the old days when we did not have key-detection software, it was mandatory to never permit two tracks' drumkicks to overlap much and you would have to EQ down the sub-frequencies of the incoming track. With today's software and pretty accurate key-detection software, I can throw in tracks with minimal EQ'ing and the drum kicks of both tracks are in perfect harmony and you won't end up with any kind of cancellation, for the most part, although you'll still have to be careful with gains control.  In terms of Madeon's mix in the video, that mix isn't actually as smooth of a transition as you might believe. With decently trained ears, and with the ability to actually see what he's doing, it makes it even easier to anticipate the transition compared to if you were in the crowd and couldn't see his actions. But he's clearly just fading in/out the tracks while killing the drum kicks, that's it, but because he's employing effects throughout, the same effects, and he's also triggering some samples, it makes for a smoother transition. I could easily hear the new synth stabs coming in. You can seem him moving the knobs and faders, but it's not clear whether he's using volume automation. He could easily have a fade-out volume automation loaded on one of those launchpad buttons.  The best transitions are the ones where you don't know that they're happening. They sneak in small elements at the best time, at the beginning of phrases where you'd think it's actually part of the song. I've heard many gigs where I thought I was listening to a remix, then I realized the tracks overlapped for over 3 minutes. Those are the best ones. Of course, this needs careful song selection.  Let me put up one of my example. This is just pure mixing, mixing two songs together. If you guys haven't heard both these songs before, I would find it nearly impossible for you to tell me exactly which point I simply threw in the second track - and when did I have the second track's drumkicks come in?  https://soundcloud.com/weemock/2-tracks-mix"

For that particular Vegas mix, here's the tracklist: http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/52954_madeon-at-cosmicmeadow-edc-las-vegas-united-states-2014-06-20.html  The fact that others can already pull out tracklists from DJ mixes (and they have been for decades) is quite a feat in and of itself. They even nailed exactly when the next songs come in, whether it's their particular snare, drum kick, synth stab, vocal, etc. They could even tell when Madeon threw in not one, but two songs mashed-up together.  Listening to DJ mixes is like playing video games. One person might think he/she is pretty damn good, and then they go online and someone else is way better. In this case, there are people who can pull apart DJ mixes by the second and even tell you that a specific drum kick is a modified one coming from a Roland 909 instead of a 707. Nuts."

For sure isn't the only one that does that, but I only know him and I know that uses ableton. That's why I used him as an example."
Beatmatch,38x04s,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:06:18 2015 UTC,"It's usually a good idea to EQ out the sub frequencies of the first track as you're mixing in the second track, as the rumbly clash can sound awful if if you keep both tracks playing with full low-end. Generally just try and keep the frequency contour even I guess. Making room for subs is a must though."
Beatmatch,38x04s,dj_soo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers but I already know what all of you said. I'm pretty sure he created something that allows him to control more thing with just a knob. He makes fast changes, I find it impossible to change lows, highs, volume of both tracks very fast and without hearing the effects"
Beatmatch,38x04s,Chewbaccasdad,2,Sun Jun 7 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"Just know your controls - nothing he's doing at 26 suggests it's ""impossible"" with just basic eq.  Sounds pretty much like a high pass with an increased resonance.  But yes, you can macro as many controls as you like to a single knob.  On thing I'd suggest is a high pass and a delay mapped to a single knob - I'd look at creating a post-fade delay effects chain (different than just the dry/wet on the standard plugin), put it in a rack with an autofilter.  Macro the frequency of the filter, the resonance with a lower curve, and the dry wet of your post-fade delay.  Another effect that works nicely with a filter would be the beat repeat and macro the grid.  Just mess around with effects and effect chains and see what sounds good.  Even the preset dj effects racks have some cool sounding racks."
Beatmatch,38x04s,Chewbaccasdad,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:04:52 2015 UTC,Thanks. What do you mean with post-fade effect? Use return tracks?
Beatmatch,38x04s,Chewbaccasdad,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:09:55 2015 UTC,"return tracks are great for post-fade effects (meaning the trail of the effect continues after the volume is cut), but you can't macro those controls and you'll have to use two controls to make the effect work (turn up the effect, and then cut the volume).  The problem with plugins on the track is that they are pre fader.  Turn down the dry/wet back to dry and you lose the trail.  Turn down the volume and you'll also lose the trail.  There are a few ways you can create an effects chain that allows you to cut the volume without losing the effect trail.  If you're chaining a high pass and delay, you can map both the frequency and the dry/wet knob to the same macro.  I'd set the dry/wet to start at 50 and the frequency to go full range.  Just make sure you put the delay effect after the high pass.  What will happen is the high-pass will eventually cut all the audio while the effect will continue on.  Here, I just made this as an example - tune the macro mapping to taste:   https://www.dropbox.com/s/63773ltfp3lg34i/Highpass%20Echo.adg?dl=0  Another way you can do this is to create a parallel effect group with a dry signal on one channel and the 100% wet signal on the other and macro the volume to a knob and the other volume level and you can create a post-fader echo in the track itself.  I find this one more useful for production tho.  Of course, you can always use the Fade to Grey preset as that's a pretty popular effect preset for DJing."
Beatmatch,38x04s,Soundsmith88,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"You can map multiple parameters to single knobs/faders in ableton and its controllers, that's probably what you're looking for. I think (not positive on this) you can map several automations to controller buttons, e.g. you press one of them on a Launchpad and it changes EQ/effect settings depending on how you set it up beforehand."

Tbh I run an mp3 player straight into an extra channel on the mixer -- in case of total equipment failure (laptop dies, controller dies, USB disconnects) at least you can put some sort of track on so that the floor isn't quiet.  To quote something I just posted about: ""The only time I got mad at another DJ was this last week when I was opening at a spot I play weekly. Other guy is the headliner for the night and plays on a Mixtrack Pro. He consistently brings more heads than me so he gets priority (not a big deal to me because I love opening). I'm opening on CDJs and he comes in with his USB stick trying to test out his stuff. Tracks won't load at all (CDJ said the track was corrupted or something). He has no backup sticks and actually had the balls to ask me to wipe one of my USB sticks just so he could play. Not to mention he basically crowded the booth every 5 minutes freaking out about how his stick wasn't working. I made some joke about ""you don't rip your tracks from Youtube, right?"" and he hesitated -- I knew he ripped all of his tracks. As I was closing off my set and letting the next DJ on I saw him stumbling in the corner ripping more tracks from youtube to mp3 on his laptop.""  Other than that be prepared to read the room closely. I don't have any quick tips and most would take paragraphs to make a full guide on it."
Beatmatch,38xgw7,Methionine,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"If you don't know what gear you will be playing on or connecting to, try to get into the venue during the week to get your hands on it.  If you are bringing a controller or audio interface, be confident in how you will connect it, but be prepared for minor changes on the night.   If you are connecting your own controller, you need to be comfortable how to set the levels correctly, particularly if you are feeding into a house mixer. The basic process is to first completely lower the mixer channel fader on that input and zero out the EQ and Gain knobs. Connect up your controller outputs to the mixer input and get a strong unclipped signal at full range out of the controller into the mixer, and then gain at the mixer for the same unclipped but full range signal and match it to any existing input. Then bring up the channel fader on the house mixer to bring yourself in and then concentrate just on your controller and leave the house mixer alone.  Also be comfortable in how to bring yourself into the mix or how to transition from the DJ before you to your set."

I let him know that we weren't open yet and I couldn't help him because I wasn't a bartender.  I was one of the managers.   Clearly he didn't make a good impression.

Here is how you do it:  In Remixbox (Like rekordbox but for the RMX-1000) you can customize EVERY parameter on the RMX. This includes the X pad Beat divisions.  In remixbox, go to the xpad section, then click again on the rectangular x-pad button. A large matrix of beat division tiles will display. Drag and drop the 8/1 (2 bars) tile onto the far right xpad position. You can put it anywhere, but this makes most sense.  Export your settings to an SD card (like you would a flash drive in rekordbox)  Load the sd card into the RMX-1000 and power it on. Your settings will automatically load so long as you have the switch on the upper right corner set to ""user.""  When you are ready to record, hit overdub, then the instant you start recording into the mic, hold down the x pad that you assigned to 8/1. Hold it down until the full 2 bars have elapsed.  It will now play back at 2 bar intervals."

Other than house parties, I have also DJ'd at a tattoo shop (to a crowd of around 30-40) which was for free because it was my buddy's tattoo shop's anniversary. The time I played to a crowd of 100 was at my old high school, which me and my friends put the show on ourselves with our own lights, sound, et cetera, and it was a benefit concert in which all the proceeds went to our old high school's ski club so we didn't make any money off of it.  In other words, its not like I am playing clubs or weddings or birthdays or anything like that to strangers for free. I don't offer ""free DJ"" online or anything like that."
Beatmatch,38r7b0,General_Exception,2,Sat Jun 6 06:37:55 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I didn't get your situation in that perspective. If you're doing just friends and benefit concerts, then I completely understand.  But I you want to take DJ'ing more seriously and plan on playing for strangers, my advice still holds. If you charge nothing, they will hold you to that standard. If you charge, they will have a different view on you (people are not rational, behavioral economics blablabla) and will appreciate your work more."

Weddings are more about music programming (playing the right song) than about mixing.  I rarely beatmatch until later in the night when doing the club sets...  Before that it's almost 100% playing requests, and then I just cross fade and mix in key.  Another thing, if doing weddings...  Learn to work the microphone as a master of ceremonies.  (My wedding rates start at $2500, and I use a VMS 4.1 controller, it's not the gear, it's the talent on the microphone that gets the high dollar weddings)"

You will also need the appropriate adapter cable for the house mixer or PA input - but a 3.5m to Dual RCA cable is a fairly safe bet. All up, you'd be looking less than $20 cost.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00E411NG6/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1433566656&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SY200_QL40&keywords=traktor+DJ+cable  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00004Z5CP/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1433566796&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX200_QL40&keywords=3.5mm+to+rca&dpPl=1&dpID=41JGQR4TJML&ref=plSrch  The next step up is getting a two channel audio interface like the Traktor Audio 2 so you can connect the sound system and headphones in dedicated stereo. This is going to cost you around $100 but gives you some more flexibility of even mixing on the house mixer by using both the Main and Headphone channels connected to the house mixer (if there is one).  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00FYQFPFU/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1433566933&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX110_SY165_FMwebp_QL70&keywords=traktor+audio+2  The A2 setup can be combined with that small entry level controller but you may find by this pointvyou have spent basically the same as an entry level controller.

I picked up about 80 full-length house tracks for $4 total from ~1999-2008. Digging still pays off in the modern era.  Not to mention if you're willing to play or record off vinyl, it's not uncommon these days for record stores to sell dance vinyl from years past for pennies too. In the past 12 months, two different local record stores near me had sales of 12/$1 and 8/$1 for various kind of dance dance music circa 1997-2005.

Hell dude I am definitely in the red from all money spent on music and gear compared to what I've been paid lol. Unless you do paid gigs regularly/semi-professionally/professionally, your answer is probably yes.  A lot of this also depends on how much you spend on music -- 30-track samplers for $10, $0.99 mp3s, $2.50 WAVs, vinyl and CD exclusives depending on your genre, etc..   ...but surely most people starting DJing who get their first gig aren't going to get a tremendous amount of money to spend on more tracks.

Beatmatch,38kt6f,djscsi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"I poked around a bit and I've found The Hercules 4-MX for $250, though it doesn't seem to be very good for scratching from what I've heard. I could probably go up to around $350 if necessary.   The thing I like about the 4-MX is that it seems to be pretty all-purpose. It has separate areas for sampling, FX, etc. Are there any ~$350 controllers like this? I'll get something refurbished if that makes it easier.  I'd personally like to either use Traktor or Serato. If I'm not mistaking, that shouldn't be a problem since Traktor seems to have mappings for a lot of these controllers already."
Beatmatch,38kt6f,djscsi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:17:15 2015 UTC,I'd go for the Traktor S2 if it's in your price range.  It has the best Traktor compatibility out-of-the-box and advanced HID support for better resolution on the jogwheels and faders.  You might be able to sell your existing Traktor license to help offset the cost.
Beatmatch,38kt6f,djscsi,2,Fri Jun 5 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"The absolute lowest I could find for a new S2 was $400, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. I'm also looking for a different kind of controller. I don't know what the technical term is, but I'd like to get something that isn't designed to be compact or minimal. The controller is going to stay in the exact same place for most of it life, so big, bulky, and solid is actually a plus. I also tried a couple of my friend's out and I largely prefer larger controllers with buttons that are more frequent and spread out. Again, the 4-MX would be great if it could do scratching.  Also, like you said: I'd be willing to sell my traktor license and just go with Serato if that would allow me to get a controller that's better for me. I haven't gotten that used to either, so it shouldn't be too hard to switch."
Beatmatch,38kt6f,Lobodon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"The reason I recommended possibly selling the license is that a S2 or S4 (new, at least) will come with a license, so you'd then have two licenses and don't need both of them.  You can probably find a used S4 for $400ish and that's a big bulky controller.  Honestly though, scratching is best left to turntables and you'd be hard pressed to find two scratch-worthy turntables and a mixer within your budget.  Maybe one used 1200 and a cheap mixer.    Serato is definitely more popular with the scratch/DVS crowd and Traktor is more popular with the techno/house/4decks crowd but both are suitable for either purpose, it's all about what you want to do with it.  Generally speaking Traktor is better for tweaking/fx/crazy shit and Serato is better for the ""2 turntables"" style of straightforward mixing/cutting/scratching/etc.  Hope this helps."

Beatmatch,38kt6f,gus_honeybun,3,Thu Jun 4 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"Since you'd like to scratch, and already have a DVS (Traktor Scratch), I'd recommend getting one turntable (Audio Technica AT-LP120 is good) and a mixer. Best if you can go outside of your budget a little. Numark or even Behringer make some pretty low end mixers, or ideally, the DJ Tech DIF-1S. It alone is about $200, but a steal for a scratch mixer that even q-bert likes. There is also used gear. Now defunct Vestax used to make excellent turntablist mixers.   With only one table you can do what is known as ""instant doubles"" which is, you play one track on the internal software, and then the one you are playing on the physical table. Once you transition, you flip it so that track is now playing in software and you load a new one on the physical deck. This allows you to EQ, adjust pitch, beatmatch, etc with the physical hardware.   You definitely can scratch on controllers but it's more difficult w/o the physical resistance a record provides. That, and the other thing often overlooked, is that they generally have poor faders. Line faders, but definitely the cross fader is where you'll spend the bulk of your time."
Beatmatch,38kt6f,gus_honeybun,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post! Since its pretty comprehensive, could I check with you that I understand everything correctly?  From what I gather, I'll need the Traktor Scratch Software (which I already have), a Timecode Vinyl (which is around $20), a turntable (which, in your recommendation, is $250), and a mixer. The whole ""instant doubles"" thing looks like it will work fine for what I'd like to do.  With thee Vinyl and Turntable put together, the total is about $275. This doesn't leave much room for a mixer (probably around $50), which seems like its going to be my biggest problem. What can I do about that? I could also map various knobs or buttons to my existing synthesizer,.  If its just not possible, I'm entirely fine with getting a regular controller and just using that."

The box should come with the audio interface (required for DVS) as well as the timecoded vinyl. Really, the short of it is that a vinyl setup is expensive, but it's also hard to beat for scratching. If you think it's something you really want to pursue, even as a hobby, I'd recommend you save a bit and buy something like my aforementioned setup. Controllers are fine, so it's your call, but just b/c it's a hobby doesn't mean it has to be mediocre gear. DJ'ing is very much a hobby of mine, but here is a recent shot of my setup.

The amps rating can be the same of higher, doesnt matter.  Also for USB, at least in macs the DDJ-SX should work off USB, but the leds will be dimmer and the overall sound output a lot lower (at least from the experience with my Traktor S2)"
Beatmatch,38iup9,tadhgerty,5,Thu Jun 4 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this would be of any benefit. Sure, you could get to precise BPM's, but you wouldn't be able to do minor changes in case Traktor hasn't analyzed the track perfectly. What I do if I want to get to precise BPM's is to let the track that's playing go at it's original tempo (I'm assuming that that is a precise BPM like 120), hit the sync button so that the track that I'm going to mix in gets to the exact same BPM as the track that's already playing and then I press sync again and mix it in by hand. It's a bit of a cheat and I seldom use it, but that's how I've solved this, to be frank, non-problem before. I know that it's nice to be at precise BPM's, but it really isn't necessary."
Beatmatch,38iup9,marremojj,2,Thu Jun 4 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"What I wish I could do is something like hold shift on my S4 while I move the tempo fader to go in one BPM increments, then adjust in percent without holding shift if I need to afterwards."
Beatmatch,38iup9,marremojj,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be helpful."
Beatmatch,38iup9,Bragnagar,2,Thu Jun 4 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I can remember, you can manipulate that in the sensitivity and acceleration value on the mapping window."
Beatmatch,38iup9,junglizer,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"Obligatory ""Learn to beatmatch using your ears instead of the numbers"". Seriously, it's not too hard, just takes practice and will only make you better.   Edit: See below for math  Trying to perfectly match the numbers is a bit of a wild goose chase. Get 'em close and use your ears to make fine adjustments."
Beatmatch,38iup9,marremojj,3,Thu Jun 4 15:41:54 2015 UTC,"Your numbers are off, mate. At 174 you would have to go up 0,57% (1/174=0,00574...), and that increase stays the same for every additional BPM you want to go up. You're pitching the original tempo of the track, so that's what you have to base it off off. For your percental increase of 0,8% to match up with 1 BPM, the original BPM has to be 125 (1/125=0,008). For 100 BPM you have to go up 1% per BPM (1/100=0.01)."
Beatmatch,38iup9,junglizer,-1,Thu Jun 4 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"Heh. Oh well, that's why I lead in w/ the ""use your ears"" bit. If I wanted to do math I would have stayed in school -__-"
Beatmatch,38iup9,marremojj,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's always the best way to go. Don't discard the math just because it's math, though. It's pretty handy to be able to calculate how big of a percental change you need to make for each BPM so that you can put yourself close to what you need and then do the fine-tuning."
Beatmatch,38iup9,junglizer,3,Thu Jun 4 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"I come from the school of vinyl, although I also have CDJs. Generally speaking, I don't pay much attention to the readouts."

Beatmatch,38hcoe,Nalcoholic,3,Thu Jun 4 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"It's quite a big difference. If you want a specific place to hire you, you have to go there. Become a regular, bond with some of the staff and even the owner if you have the chance. Casually drop that you're a DJ a few times, but don't emphasize to much (you don't want to look desperate/pathetic). Get a lot of info (previous resident DJ's, rates, type of music, type of people,...) and be sure (for yourself) that this fits you, if not, just move on.  If you just want to score a residency, get your name out there. Network a lot. Like really a lot. Befriend other DJ's and get them to like you (as a person) and appreciate your style. If someone asks them, and they have your in the back of their head, they will recommend you (if it fits your style). Try and play local gigs (even for lower rates) to get some fame/experience.  As a last thing (and a resident DJ myself) I want to make sure that you know where you're going to get yourself into. It isn't always easy to re-invent yourself and your music each time you play (you don't have to), but you have to keep it interesting for the regulars. You will most likely need a pretty big music collection and knowledge for this. Also, regulars tend to be a bit more close with you (requesting songs, letting them sing at the microphone...) and thinking they can get more out of you because they see you every week. Be aware of that.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."
Beatmatch,38hcoe,nowenknows,2,Thu Jun 4 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This is pretty solid advice. I just want to emphasize that the phrase ""I'll show up on time, and be professional"" has help my career more than imaginable."

Beatmatch,38hcoe,Nalcoholic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like a drink too, especially when I play sets on smaller parties or a residency. But drinking to much and just mixing wasted doesn't give you a very professional look, or worse, sound."
Beatmatch,38hcoe,DJ_Theo,2,Thu Jun 4 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed, just begging to mess up at some point. Saw Dillion Francis play a set two years ago and he was wasted - hit play/pause on the wrong deck and paused the currently playing track. Absolutely killed the flow of his set, then he jumped on the mic and shouted something about the crowd needing to get fucked up on his level and played a new track. Just awful"

Beatmatch,38jmhx,dj_soo,2,Thu Jun 4 18:29:00 2015 UTC,mistakes are how you learn.  You making mistakes will have less to do with the room being treated and more to do with just refining your ear and your knowledge base.
Beatmatch,38jmhx,jupitergeorge,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:14:02 2015 UTC,You can always re listen to your mix using headphones to listen for any minor mistakes you might not catch when playing at high volume with speakers.

Beatmatch,38jmhx,sixsixmusic,2,Thu Jun 4 18:28:03 2015 UTC,DJing isn't mixing studio productions - accuracy really isn't as huge of a concern.  Just position your speakers at ear level right by your head and you'll be fine.

Beatmatch,38jmhx,PileOfTrees,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:49:01 2015 UTC,I know. I just want to record mixes and I though not being able to hear everything accurately would affect the mix. maybe I shouldn't have used the word ubtreated in the title because by that I mean a room with no natural reverb.

Also you can hear the loss of low-end. that's part of the reason lots of modern dance music emphasizes the higher harmonics of bass timbre, to give the illusion that it's still 'all there' (in my opinion). so a lot of people can't hear the difference, and/or are used to music that compensates for the mp3 medium's limitations fairly well"

The mp3 got pretty good after all those years.   The difference to 128kbps though....

Beatmatch,38fht2,mongo_lloyd,0,Wed Jun 3 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is. I think it is more like an absolute beginner to writing, asking which combination of writing device and writeable sheet would be a good start. OP is not asking, others to create something to take credit for. He is asking for a minimal starting point to learn how to DJ. There is no point in using a pen and try to write on some plastic sheet/There is (probably) no point in trying to mix a 160bpm C major track into a 100bpm D minor track. And if there really is, he can still figure it out, after he at least once successfully mixed two songs together and has a slight idea of what is important, because he experienced it first hand with songs that he knows go well together.  Like I said in my other posting here, we don't tell guitar beginners to write their own songs. We give them songs, to develop an idea of how things should go."
Beatmatch,38fht2,senft,3,Thu Jun 4 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"No, but if someone said ""OK guys, I got my guitar, I picked a band name, and we have our first gig on Friday... What songs should we play?""  we would have the same kind of reaction."
Beatmatch,38fht2,djscsi,3,Thu Jun 4 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but now you are changing the scenario. OP was not asking ""I, DJ XTC, have this massive EDM gig next week, but I don't know shit. What songs should I play?"" This is about a list of songs that go well together as a learning tool.  This would allow a beginner to (first) focus on the technical side of DJing (beatmatching, etc.), while keeping the creative side (picking songs) in the background at first. The same way that we allow guitar beginners to play (which reads ""exactly copy"") existing songs/classics first, without bitching about how uncreative they are for not writing their own songs.  I really don't see the difference. Why is it ok for a guitar beginner to only copy other people's stuff, but a DJ beginner has to have his ""own style"" from the beginning on?!  edit: Or is this not about a list of fitting songs as a learning tool? :D"
Beatmatch,38fht2,senft,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:40:34 2015 UTC,"OP was asking why there seems to be a general resistance to the ""I'm a new DJ, what tracks should I play?"" question.

And where do I download them?""    I think most people here wouldn't have any objection to suggesting 2 tracks that go particularly well together as a way to practice mixing.  But there are a lot of people who simply don't want to do the work of digging for tunes, building a collection, and learning how tracks go together, so they come here asking for a whole set worth of music because it ""takes too much time"" to find all those tracks or whatever.  And that digging and collection-building is what makes a DJ, IMO."

""Hey guys I've been DJing for about 5 1/2 weeks now and I have my first gig tomorrow. What songs should I play? And where do I download them?""    Yes, this is a totally different thing and it's stupid.   digging and collection-building is what makes a DJ, IMO.   Absolutely. No doubt about that.

Beatmatch,38fht2,senft,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:01:10 2015 UTC,If somebody has a gig they should not be asking what songs they play. I think a list would be to help somebody develop the skills.

It's almost entirely what you enjoy. If you want easy songs to mix pick songs that are all in the same BPM range and have simple structures - intro, drop, break, drop, outro.  So, basically if you want easy songs to mix download Steve Aoki and Hardwell and Showtek. But there's not much point, pretty much all music is easy to mix, save for like experimental jazz"

Your hardware, technique, etc. really only makes up a small part of ""being a DJ."" The first months/years of DJing should be more collecting music than mixing it, IMO.   If you bought a controller, learned to beatmatch (or not), then started asking the internet ""which tracks do I play?"" you're kind of putting the cart before the horse."
Beatmatch,38fht2,happypillows,23,Thu Jun 4 13:17:50 2015 UTC,"You should be a music lover first, a DJ second.

I listened to both DJs I liked and DJs who play the music that I like, then I would more or less mimic transitions and styles until I could do it pretty well. When I got the hang, I added some more of my own flavor whether its scratching, FX or song selection.   The beauty of it all is the sheer amount of music. Its so easy and fun to just listen until you hit something you like. Or just go through the top 40 in any genre. OP needs to find songs, list them out, then ask beatmatch what they think of it.

Beatmatch,38fht2,WeaverGames,8,Fri Jun 5 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"No, and here's why: Every single bit of the process of building your song bank that you don't do yourself is a missed opportunity to develop your own identity. Put in the time and work. It has literally never in the history of DJ'ing been easier or cheaper to learn to DJ. I sometimes make recommendations for music, but I am totally against there being a crowd sourced list of songs that DJ's are practicing on. That means that the songs that every single DJ who uses that list is most comfortable with are the same. You can't start building your library and your habits that way. I'm going to say something radical: it is difficult to be original as a DJ. Really difficult. You could begin and end a 20 year career as one and never doing anything a lick different than anyone else. Many do. That is a path you should be able to take if you really want to, but I don't think subs that are this much of a resource to DJs in the nascent stage in their careers should be promoting it.  Take the time to build an ear and a sound. Trust me. It will be worth it."

Beatmatch,38fht2,SigmaTheDJ,3,Thu Jun 4 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"Because how to mix is differentiated by what genre you want to mix in.  Mixing trance is way different form mixing hardcore which is way different from mixing hip-hop.  I started mixing vinyl by buying two copies of the same song and putting the same track at 0% on each turntable to learn how to cue and phrase match correctly without having to worry about beatmatching at that point.  Really, long story short; pick any two songs in a genre and learn to mix them.  There likely really isn't ""best songs to learn on"", except maybe tracks that have super long ambient openings which would be poor starter tracks."
Beatmatch,38fht2,brokenstack,2,Wed Jun 3 22:37:20 2015 UTC,"It's actually a lot different than playing a song with a guitar. If you're playing a song on guitar, it's to retain muscle memory and to be able to replicate it without mistake. When you play a song DJing, it's because you like the song and want to use it in a way that builds upon the musical experience. If you have everybody the same 2 songs to transition into, you lose originality, and therefore lose the art of DJing.   A fellow DJ and myself recently did a challenge of sorts. We picked the first 4 songs of a set in that order, and had an hour to make a mix using those 4 songs as the introduction. We took our mixes in drastically different directions and that exemplifies the idea of DJing. You put your spin on what you make.   The closest comparison I can make to learning a song on guitar is learning a scratch, and that's perfectly okay to ask about. When you're asking other people for their songs, their transitions, and how they DJ, you're not a DJ yourself. You're a carbon copy."
Beatmatch,38fht2,senft,2,Wed Jun 3 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"My advice for a beginner would be to pick out a few songs from their collection that are all within the same BPM range. Songs that have a nice clear steady beat, consistent tempo throughout, and that don't have a complex or confusing structure - that's most dance music and hip-hop to be honest.  I think it's best to practice with music you like/love, which is why it's best to select the songs yourself.  One thing I have done with beginners in the past, is mix a couple of songs together and then say ""OK, now you copy that and let me hear the results"", but that only really works if they're into the same sort of music as me and it works because it's a practical example, rather than me just naming 2 tracks and saying ""now go mix 'em""."
Beatmatch,38fht2,qpb,2,Wed Jun 3 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"Because everybody has A) different tastes, B) different styles, and C) different gear. There's no right song, nor a best song. For example, I learned to beatmatch using two copies of Stabbing Westward vinyl. That's not going to work for everyone else, and might even sound strange to some, but it worked for me.   We, as DJs, need to do a better job at defining what we do. Every time someone learns a new mix, or a new technique, or a new song on their own they are coming closer to truly defining a style. Asking a bunch of DJs what songs are ""best"" for mixing just demonstrates they don't actually understand what DJing is."
Beatmatch,38fht2,MegasOros,2,Thu Jun 4 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"I think many people miss an important point here. There is a creative and a technical part to DJing. On an absolute beginner level the technical part basically is just beatmatching. The creative part is picking songs (one could argue that parts of picking songs is also purely technical, like key/phrases, but bear with me...)  Some goes for learning to play an instrument, say the guitar. The technical part is learning how to fret a chord, how to play scales, etc. The creative part is learning to write songs. Yet, we don't go and tell guitar beginners to write there own songs?! They play ""How many roads"" or some shit, because it will teach them the technical aspect without sounding like a complete trainwreck.  Giving a DJ beginner some songs that will go well together, simply gives some good examples on what to look for in songs. Beginners might even be able to figure out why the songs go well together."
Beatmatch,38fht2,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like everybody has a huge ego of ""I came up with this mix do it yourself or fuck off."" Yes there is a lot of music out there and yes you can even mix a song into itself to practice. But learning a skill is about baby steps. Giving an example track list would allow somebody to practice and learn the basics without being overwhelmed by the millions of songs out there. Most people on here have probably heard a mix and copied at least a part it so stop acting like youre a creative genius that wrote these symphonies when you probably didnt write 99% of what you mix. We should be considerate and help the community and other people interested in this fun activity by giving them a foundation to build and learn off of."

Plus, I would never want to learn on tracks that I do not absolutely love, and im sure a lot of peiple feel the same way. I think thats why people are reacting so negatively to such a stupid request."
Beatmatch,38gi69,lowflyinggoat,3,Thu Jun 4 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"The DJM has a set of RCA out's on the back of the mixer for recording. They will output a steady level independent of where you have the master volume set. You will want to feed that signal into either a recording device, into a USB sound card, or you can get a converter cable to change it to a headphone jack and plug it straight into your computers mic input. You can then use software like Audacity to record the signal. Just test it first to see if you need to adjust the gains in the software."

Beatmatch,387fdi,zclub,7,Tue Jun 2 11:44:56 2015 UTC,"If a DJ wants to use your lighting rig, I'd just give them the controller you set up and tell them which scenes do what. I, personally, wouldn't give a random DJ control of that because, honestly, they are probably going to fuck it up since they don't know what the scenes do.  For example, if I give you my custom mapped controller and my software and say ""Hey, go DJ"" you're going to fuck it up because you don't know what's happening."
Beatmatch,387fdi,brokenstack,2,Tue Jun 2 13:32:29 2015 UTC,I see your point.    So MIDI isn't the control logic of choice for a DJ?  I thought it was.

And even if I showed up to a venue and you gave me a lighting board and said ""go nuts"" right before I start spinning, if those scenes you programmed aren't completely idiot proof I'm going to fuck it up.  Almost every club I've spun at either has a dedicated lighting person or everything is just running on auto."

I'll probably just keep it to automatic playback, then, or the iPad idea.  It's way more dramatic to choreograph the lights with the music, but that takes lots of doing.  Maybe someday a regular DJ would put that effort in."
Beatmatch,387fdi,brokenstack,3,Tue Jun 2 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"If there's someone around to run the lights, or a sound guy willing to do it, or even a resident DJ willing to learn, then go for it. But beyond that I'd think it'd be too much, especially to do while DJing.  You might want to create different ""emotional"" scenes, so if it's a night of dubstep and madness you can have the seizure inducing strobes and lasers, whereas if it's trip-hop, glitch hop and downtempo it's more mellow and sweeping? That might help."
Beatmatch,387fdi,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"I already have plans to have different ""pages"" on the iPad.  Each page is a situation.  A single DJ front and center is one page.  A live band with two front men is another page.  A live band with three front men is another page.  Etc.  Adding pages for mood is a good idea and it's just another few pages.  A lot of that is just getting the right XY coordinates for the moving heads.  I'm hoping I don't have to adjust the spots for every performer.  Another reason is so the iPad user doesn't have to change pages (the swipe can sometimes accidentally trigger a scene).  Once the correct page is selected, all the scenes needed are right there.    In theory."
Beatmatch,387fdi,ChalupaBatman_710,2,Tue Jun 2 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"Well, those positions very well may need to change based on the band. For example, a three piece band might have a live drummer center rear, keyboardist left rear and a vocalist center. Or have all three right across the center of the stage. Keyboardist front left and guitarist front left with a drummer center rear. Having the presets configured is great, still, since updating the X/Y of what is needed is a lot easier than otherwise.  I would still be very hesitant to give a performer an iPad with stuff on it unless they knew what they were doing. You said below that someone wanted to connect to the lighting scheme. That might be to transmit MIDI clock to the lighting rig so that everything can be in time. Is that possible with your setup? Can you manage that?"

Beatmatch,3879db,Flarey,3,Tue Jun 2 10:31:17 2015 UTC,"When buying equipment for turntablism, I always give the same advice - if you're sure it's for you and you have the means to save up, then save up and buy high end gear from the beginning. If you're in a position where your budget is limited, then some equipment is definitely better than none!  I don't think the T60s are that great for scratching. While they are direct drive (which is a must for DJ turntables, but particularly for scratching) the torque on them is kinda low. That doesn't mean you couldn't learn to scratch with them, but low torque turntables can hinder your progress.  As for the mixer, it's kinda the same story. Behringer don't have a particularly good reputation for making high quality DJ gear, and budget mixers rarely have quality faders in them (there are 1 or 2 exceptions). I'm not sure if you could drop a Pro X Fade or an Innofader into that mixer, but even if you could it would add to the cost.  As for the sound card, without knowing what it is it's hard to comment on it. Regarding other gear you'll need, there's headphones, decent carts/styli and slipmats if the decks don't already have good ones, headphones, a computer to run the DVS software (assuming the sound card is even good for that) and of course a sound system of some kind - you likely have some of that stuff already though.  In terms of price, I don't think the deal is that great. Looking at completed sales on eBay, a pair of T60s can sell for as low as £100. The Behringer mixer goes for about £70. In Euros, that's 235, so unless you're getting a pretty awesome sound card as part of that deal I would look elsewhere. If you're savvy and look for a good deal on eBay or similar, you can get better decks and a better mixer for your money."
Beatmatch,3879db,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:58:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help.  Is there anything better then T60s that price point? I am doing this purely as a hobby for the foreseeable future, so I don't think I need alot. Should I hold out for a better deal?"
Beatmatch,3879db,SigmaTheDJ,3,Tue Jun 2 12:03:33 2015 UTC,"I would definitely hold out for a better deal.  Technics hold their value well, so you can pretty much write those off, but if you bide your time you should be able to pick up a pair of decent decks for 150-200. Look out for the higher model Stantons (T80 and up), Numark TT500/TTX, and any of the Super OEM turntables (you can find a full list with a Google search).  Likewise with mixers, there are bargains to be had for around 100 or so, but it's a matter of biding your time and checking eBay for listings regularly. Good ones that I've seen go for low prices include Vestax 05 and 06, Stanton SA5, Allen & Heath Xone 02, Ecler Hak 310, Pioneer DJM-707, Numark DXM Pro and a few others. The Gemini UMX 7 is a much better mixer for scratching than that Behringer and they often sell for under 30 on eBay!  As for your DVS, you're not likely to get a decent DVS as well for your 400 budget, but you can certainly get better turntables and a better mixer for under 400, then you could save up a bit more and get an older Serato SL1 box or whatever and you've have a nice little setup for scratching/turntablism."
Beatmatch,387n4q,darkbydesire,3,Tue Jun 2 12:56:58 2015 UTC,"Get an inexpensive mixer from eBay and a cheap audio interface. Map your MIDI keyboard to work with your software (possible in VDJ, Traktor and Mixxx but not Serato) or get an inexpensive controller. Don't invest in anything too expensive because A) you might hate DJing, B) you might hate what you buy, and/or C) you might realize you've bought the wrong thing for your needs and struggle to unload it without losing too much money.   Start small. If you feel inclined, buy some used turntables, a used mixer and a used audio interface for Serato or Traktor and get started that way. But you'd be fine starting out with a controller to get you understanding the basics and theory that you can probably offload for near what you bought it for, without too much of an investment.  As far as speakers, if you're not jumping head-first into mobile DJing, get a decent pair of desktop speakers with RCA outs. The new Cerwin Vegas don't sound the best but they are good enough. Or get a small pair of KRKs or M-Audio or something. if you're doing production you'd want clean monitors anyway."

They are expensive, and if you want to expand them you have no choice but to build an entire new rig from scratch. Either a controller for your software, or you need more CD Decks or whatever. To me, the XDJ-Rx is what you buy when you know you want to use Rekordbox.  I'd recommend either a cheapo Pioneer controller that comes with Serato and works with Rekordbox, or a controller for Traktor like the S2MK2, all of which will save you around $1000 in initial output.  As far as the KRKs and HD25s, I'd say go for it. The HD-25s won't be great for production, but the KRKs will after you adjust to them."

For the Headphones i recommend the Sennheiser HD 25 II  They are a bit expensive but if something breaks and you are out of warranty you can just replace the broken part instead buying a new pair of headphones.  I own the AIAIAI TMA-1 which are also pretty darn good but the sennheiser are a bit better in my opinion. I find them more isolating in a club for instance.

Beatmatch,385txj,rossffs,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:54:27 2015 UTC,All the info is on the sticker next to the power port and all published tech specs will include power info. CDJs are only about 50watts and a mixer probably less than 150.

Beatmatch,386xfk,Cozzafrenz,3,Tue Jun 2 07:54:28 2015 UTC,"While you can scratch with CDJs and controllers, you really can't beat scratching with regular turntables. Just 1 turntable will do to begin with if you just want to learn to scratch. You can always pick up another one later on to learn mixing, juggling etc.  Some of the turntables I'd recommend are Technics 1200, Stanton STR8-150, Numark TTX, Vestax PDX, as well as the other Super OEM turntables. If you buy second hand, make sure you check the turntable out fully first.  As for mixers, it's really all about the faders with scratching, particularly the crossfader. DJ-Tech make a couple of decent scratch mixers that are super cheap, but have Mini Innofaders in them for the crossfader, but which mixer you choose will depend on your budget and whether you're prepared to buy a used one.   Once you have a turntable and mixer, all you really need are a couple of scratch records and you're good to go for learning scratching. You can pick up a DVS like Serato or Traktor further down the line and you already have a Macbook to run the software.  There's lots of scratch tutorials on YouTube. Make sure you start with the basics - baby scratch, forwards, stabs, tears, drags etc.   If you want more specific advice, just ask. If you want equipment advice, make sure you post a budget."

Once you learnt how to beatmatch by ear buy a Rane SL2 with Serato Scratch Live to use both vinyls and mp3. Vestax are also an option, i heard they're better for scratching."
Beatmatch,386xfk,Saucette,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:45:21 2015 UTC,"If money is expendable, get 2 technics1200 (make sure they are in good condition) or a pair of brand new super oem tables and a Rane 61, 62, 57mkii or if you at to save some money, a traktor z2 and a serato box if you want use serato (or just the z2 if you want to use traktor)  Get a bunch few scratch records or download some and get to practicing.  Dj angelo has the best series of tutorials for scratching and they're all free on YouTube.  It's going to take a lot of time and effort to get even close to the level of someone like jfb so practice a lot and practice every day and make sure you do it properly (I.e. Drills, repetition, training muscle memory) rather than just fuck around when you practice."
Beatmatch,384kh4,Alpine425,3,Mon Jun 1 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that every adapter and every possible break in the signal path is a possible point of failure.   64GB USB sticks are fine as long as they are FAT32.

Beatmatch,384kh4,christianjackson,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"I am a Traktor user on a Mac.

I have only a little bit of experience with CDJ's, but I'd like to be able to have my songs ready to go anytime I'm out."
Beatmatch,384kh4,christianjackson,2,Mon Jun 1 21:30:40 2015 UTC,"Right, so that cable was an extra point of failure between a usb device and your laptop. The industry standard for most touring DJs is a 32 or 64GB usb 3.0 drive because there is no cable, there is no adapter and the reliability is as close to 100% as possible in DJing technology. This is, of course, barring user error.   You can also use SD cards in certain CDJ models and the possibility of knocking them out of the CDJ is ultra low since the card goes fully into the deck and has a spring loaded cover that is flush with the top.  $25 for a USB drive and an hour of your time in rekordbox will give you the most reliable backup possible."

I export the NML file (Traktor specific playlist) and the M3U file onto the drive. Just recently started using Mixed in Key to set the key in comments and BPM in the tags.   Using Rekordbox, will there be any issues switching between Traktor, Serato, and CDJ's?   Can you recommend a good USB Flash Drive as an alternative? Do I need 2 cloned drives or a cable to link the CDJ's?"

Beatmatch,384es9,nicksauro,3,Mon Jun 1 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"I use the Sz at one of my residencies and although it is a nice feeling controller and the size of the platters are awesome, there a few annoyances and one major dealbreaker for me.    Big issue is the lack of post-fader effects for the internal software effects.  This is done because the SZ takes the audio from serato and mixes it through the hardware mixer rather than mixing it internally in the software like most controllers, but it's a pretty big oversight.  Rane mixers allow the effects to route to an auxiliary channel which allows you to use your internal software effects as post-fader, so there's no reason that pioneer couldn't have done the same.  For someone who likes to use a lot of echo effects in their mixes, it's a dealbreaker.  There are hardware echo effects that are post-fade, but the implementation isn't ideal - forcing you to choose between 4 effects including the filter.      I think ultimately cdjs and a good mixer would be more versatile although they will cost more to get a comparable quality setup to the Sz."

I prefere dropping into the mainpart of the next tune right at the end of the main-part of the previous, aka mixing the intro of the next tune into  the mainpart of the current, as it keeps the momentum going. although this might be tricky when dealing with very harmonic tunes as you do   I hope this review was a little helpful :) I currently also have a mix up for review ( https://youtu.be/CmOeFOz-_bk ) and would love to hear your opinion!  warning: I'm not really a big fan of Liquid/Mainstream-DnB, and am therefore not extremly familiar with the mixing styles used in this subgenre.."

For most people, that's too much work to do for your entire music collection and you will end up with a limited library of tracks to play.   IMO one of the most important parts of being a DJ is being versatile, so that you can react to the crowds response. Ableton is typically used by headline acts, as they know exactly what they are going to play and that wont change in most circumstances.   Not trying to dissuade you from trying, but a midi controller and Traktor would be my pick for a beginner if you cant afford Pioneer CDJ's."
Beatmatch,380ujj,mountthecurb,8,Mon Jun 1 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"I've done it plenty of times and like the other commenter said, you would normally have to warp the tracks you want to use. It's a lot of work but I feel it's way better than dedicated DJing software in terms of effects since it's primary use is production. But again, it's hard but sometimes worth it. If you want to do it, I highly recommend getting a Push or an APC 40. They have knobs. You NEED knobs."
Beatmatch,380ujj,gntrr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:55:14 2015 UTC,I have both Traktor and Ableton and my set up would be using a novation launchpad and the korg nanokontrol 2. So which do you prefer Ableton or Traktor?
Beatmatch,380ujj,djdementia,2,Mon Jun 1 11:36:25 2015 UTC,Ableton is best for Producers who dabble in DJing IMHO and not for DJs at all.  If you just want to be a DJ then Traktor is where it's at.   If you want to headline an EDM show playing your own beats and remixes then Ableton makes sense.
Beatmatch,380ujj,parkeyb,0,Mon Jun 1 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"Can I PM you to be my guru? I just got an APC 40 and will marahall's set up and came from Serato Dj'ing on a deck, and am still a bit lost and don't really know exactly where to start. Do you warp each song, clip each track and save each section of the song you want to play?"

Beatmatch,380ujj,deuddoo,3,Mon Jun 1 08:53:24 2015 UTC,"I DJ with Ableton and have been for a couple years. Tempo is changed by hand, which (in my opinion) is a huge benefit, once you get the hang of it, because you can adjust subtle variations in emotion based on the speed of a warped track. It's done by using a tempo mapped knob on a midi controller or the bpm control on your laptop. The versatility and on the fly response with Ableton comes with fades, effects, and dummy clips which makes performing a ton of fun."

Beatmatch,37zj2i,Alpine425,3,Sun May 31 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely get some practice time in on the decks first before a gig. There are specific ways that CDJs handle looping and cue points that you'll need to get familiar with before playing out. Secondly, you'll need to process any tracks you put on those drives with Rekordbox. Traktor info doesn't carry over, so you'll need to set up cue points, fix beat gridding, and possibly make sure all the info is correct.   As far as comparability for storage, as long as you have a USB stick, you should be good, but consider burning some CD's as well in case you run into older versions. Ask ahead of time what model CDJ the venue or event might have; CDJ 1000 Mk3 and later all take mp3 cds, but everything up to the Mk2 can only read full audio cd's."
Beatmatch,37zj2i,burniemcburn,3,Sun May 31 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"YMMV but there is this tool that exists to transfer Traktor and Rekordbox data: http://nextaudiolabs.com/rekordbox-3-0-and-rekord-buddy/  I am a Serato and Rekordbox user and my workflow right now involves track prepping twice. I was going to use MiK in the same way you are going to but honestly the first step would be just batch- analyzing to save the tags to ID3.  As for USBs it doesn't hurt to have duplicates. These days I'm running around with 5 USBs which are all cloned. If you have a link cable you can use 1 USB into the whole CDJ setup (its a ethernet cable running between CDJs). Otherwise you just take your duplicate sticks and stick them into each separate CDJ. The redundancy in the sticks also helps if a USB drive fails on you, which has happened to me."

Beatmatch,37xqxb,dj_soo,3,Sun May 31 07:48:02 2015 UTC,How are the difference in priority and style reflected in the software?
Beatmatch,37xqxb,abandon616,12,Sun May 31 10:13:57 2015 UTC,"Serato is geared more towards traditional DJing and its reflected in the simplicity and elegance of the program.   Traktor is more geared towards a customizable experience with features that work more for a live pa style workflow.  The best analogy would be iOS vs android.  Like iOS, Serato is more streamlined and intuitive and results in a simpler interface that is easy to use but at the cost of some features and customization.  Traktor is closer to android in that it is a bit more robust and offers a great deal of customization and features, but it can be overwhelming and there is more chance of user error.  Traditionally, serato has been the more stable program while traktor is more feature rich, but they are both getting pretty close to each other in terms of strengths and weaknesses."
Beatmatch,37xqxb,dj_soo,3,Sun May 31 10:25:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks! Is there any difference in compatibility with equipment, like some controllers won't work or some OS won't work? And also, which would you suggest for a somewhat slower computer? Sorry for so many questions,  but as a beginner like me this is really helpful!"
Beatmatch,37xqxb,abandon616,2,Sun May 31 10:45:58 2015 UTC,"Its mostly Serato which has compatibility requirements. Head on over to serato.com and you will see a list of compatable hardware.  As far as compatibility for tratkor most controllers will have a ""mapping"" file for traktor compatibility, its as simple as a quick google search. Unless its a native instruments controller, then its good to go on traktor.  If you are unsure on your software of choice, get something which works on both (a lot of the controllers listed on the serato site, also have a traktor mapping file available), so if you don't like one program, you can switch to the other.  How slow is your computer? I would recommend heading over to serato and the traktor website, and checking their minimum specs.  edit; fixed a word"
Beatmatch,37xqxb,gus_honeybun,2,Sun May 31 12:08:12 2015 UTC,"Great analogy. That's the exact reason I switched to Traktor. Couldn't stand the iOS-like limitations on Serato, though it was easier to use."
Beatmatch,37xqxb,st3ph-n,1 point,Sun May 31 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"If you want quality, and options go for Traktor.  If you want something super basic then go for serato.

Beatmatch,37m63e,A73357,12,Thu May 28 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"turned on a little bit the low-pass filter   The low-pass filter? A low pass filter lets the lows, and only the lows, past it. If you want to cut the lows, you need to apply a high pass.  Also, both the kick and the bassline probably have some mid and even high range content, are you sure that's not what you're hearing?"
Beatmatch,37m63e,mrthbrd,4,Thu May 28 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there is probably a kick in de mid range too. Imagine you are listening to this song on a crappie low bass sound system...  This makes the bass noticeable without having bass"
Beatmatch,37m63e,mikeb93,2,Thu May 28 20:36:21 2015 UTC,This and also some mixers don't have full cut EQ anyway
Beatmatch,37m63e,Con1750,6,Fri May 29 10:46:08 2015 UTC,"That's kinda hard to do. A Kick drum consists of 2 frequencies. The bass drum portion, and the frequency of the actual hit. The actual hit actual hit usually has a higher frequency than the bass drum, which causes it to end up in parts of the midrange. Furthermore, Low Pass Filters cut out the high end of a song, as opposed to high pass, which cut out the low end. Try fiddling with your eq settings if you have this option."
Beatmatch,37m63e,Dantejb,2,Thu May 28 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"You're not really right about the ""2 frequencies"" thing. A kick drum's pitch quickly sweeps from somewhere up in the mid-highs (although this differs) to the lows. It's one wave with a pitch envelope, not two portions. Usually, at least. Obviously most kicks, even synthesized ones, are more complicated than that, but that's how kicks work in essence."
Beatmatch,37m63e,mrthbrd,2,Thu May 28 17:27:39 2015 UTC,"Sometimes kicks can be layered too. So the kick you are hearing might actually be two or three separate kicks pushed to different frequencies. I always use at least two, but the extra one is pretty much always a sub bass close to or at a lower than audible frequency."
Beatmatch,37m63e,nowenknows,1 point,Thu May 28 19:04:36 2015 UTC,Ah. Pardon my ignorance. I was going off of my understanding of them based around personal experience. TIL
Beatmatch,37m63e,Dantejb,3,Thu May 28 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"Kicks are hard to cut out because of the transient it has (the ""punch"" of the kick in the beginning). The transient usually sweeps through high and mid freqs. before the low freqs. are played. Cutting the lows and some of the highs can help but it's usually better to mix it in with songs that mask the transient instead. Btw lowpass filters will only cut the highs and mids, not the lows. Highpass filters are the ones you're looking for. Hope this helps!"
Beatmatch,37m63e,mokedawg,2,Thu May 28 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"Are you using traktor? You can change the EQ filter curve to ""Z ISO"" which does what you want."

Do you want tips on how to mix with the EQ? Are you looking for ways to fiddle with the EQ and a track to get more gas out of it?   Asking how you should set the EQ is a bit vague, and it is always admittedly difficult when describing how things sound with words. Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.

Also, I apologize., I can be a real asshole sometimes. Compounding things - when I was learning how to dj there was no such things as google so interneting was a challenge Records were available at shitty shops, new tracks were $6-10 dollars and generally the tracks had the original then a shit remix or two. The best tracks were released after the top dj's had canned the shit out of them for half a year minimum. And other djs would not share secrets on mixing, or anything. Practice x time x trial / error = broken records and trainwrecks for a long time.   If you want to get into it read Last Night A DJ Saved My LIfe and there's another really good book that I'll think of the name just after sending this.

Beatmatch,37m63e,pokeyjones,1 point,Sat May 30 02:44:10 2015 UTC,"Ok so i'll answer you. Well since i don't have any dj controller, i find it better to use a virtual dj 8 pro(that's how i do all my mixes in  pc). Relative to the question,it's very simple, i want to cut all the kick drums from  a song , to be able to shift the crossfader from side to side without, getting the feeling that the whole vibe was cut. BALKNYS=Balcony is a reference to the place where my ""dj project began"". At last but not least, my  mixes are all about Eletro/Progressive house and sometimes not to often Trance, so if you're really into techno music i'll venture guess that you will hate them. If you already heard at least 30 min of the whole mix i uploaded, and you like the genre, but dislike my mix, i would like to know. A little bit of self promotion but that's what it is."

I never used DJM 700 i used DJM 600 and DJM 800 and coming to the CDJ 1000 never used CDJ 1000 but used CDJ 350's, CDJ 850-K, CMX 3000."

IMO, you should burn some CD's with some songs in the same BPM range and get a feel of what its like to mix with the MK3's. If you can master beatmatching with this current set up, you will find current club equipment (CDJ 2000's) laughably easy.

Still, mountthecurb's idea about burning some CDs to practice with is a good idea. It will let you get used to the fundamentals of mixing before you complicate things with Traktor.  As a next step, if you have a decent laptop I'd look into getting the Traktor Scratch A6 pack to start controlling the Traktor software with your CDJs."

Beatmatch,37kvd8,Julices_Grant,2,Thu May 28 12:31:49 2015 UTC,"Some DJs use USBs in CDJs, others use laptops running Traktor or Serato. DJing is really weird right now as there's no one set way to do it, but people tend to see a DJM-900 mixer and CDJ-2000Nexus CD players as the club standard.  If a venue has CDJ-2000s, 900s 850s or 350s you can turn up with USB sticks and headphones and you're good to go. Pioneer have a software system called Rekordbox which lets you prepare the MP3 tracks on your USB stick so that the CDJ that you stick the USB into  will know things like the tempo of the track and what cue-points you have set up.  The principles of mixing with CDJ-1000MK3 are identical to mixing using newer CDJs, so the skills you learn on your current hardware will serve you well in future."
Beatmatch,37kvd8,cosinezero,1 point,Thu May 28 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"Only way would be to use a DVS program.  The industry standards are serato and traktor - both can be expensive because you are required to use proprietary hardware in order to use the software with timecode.  Virtual dj, and a few other lower lever programs can also do timecode, but you will still need a sound card capable of having 2 stereo inputs and at least 2 stereo outputs."

Most electronic dance tracks do, but there are songs that will have extra beats and bars and others that follow different phrasing (like 12-bar phrasing).  Other songs will sometimes have things like 4-bar intros or other an upbeat before the downbeat so it's important to not simply assume that the first beat automatically means the phrase starts after 8 bars."

I didn't mean to imply that you should always do repeated 8 bar counts, although reading it back I guess it might be interpreted that way.  As someone who listens to a lot of mixes, I think phrase matching is the most common area where people mess up, largely because a lot of people are using auto-sync and auto-levels these days. There's clearly a lot of beginners who are already putting out mixes who don't really understand this topic and this was really just meant as a primer for folks like that. :)"

A guy on DJ Forums once posted his first mix after owning his first ever DJ set up for less than half a day and he asked ""do I have room to improve?"". lol.  It can be frustrating. I remember giving a guy detailed feedback on his mixing and what he needed to work on and I said ""you need to hole yourself up in your room for a few months and practice, cos you're posting new mixes every other day and there's no progression"" and 2 days later he replied with another mix and said ""is this any better?"". Haha. I suppose a lot of folks these days are just doing what they see other people doing though, so I can't 100% blame them as everyone wants the SoundCloud page, the Facebook fan page etc. before they've really put any work in."

Beatmatch,37h038,nowenknows,4,Fri May 29 22:46:26 2015 UTC,Great advice. This is certainly one of the drills I work with when teaching someone new to DJing -- just listening to a track and pointing out it's structure and phrasing goes a long way.
Beatmatch,37h038,EmotionlessEmoticon,3,Wed May 27 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"With time and intimacy with your chosen genres, you don't even have to count anymore. You start to understand the 'tells' of phrasing, the quirks of the drum and synth progression..."

Nowadays it's more skill than luck and feels really great when your timing is right.   Some commercial tracks only have a 8 beat intro, which I just loop then.   Also, for a while I put cues 64 or 32 beats before the first break and when the last 32 or 64 beats started. Using an S4 with 8 hot cues I could tap hot cue 2 (did this for every track) on Track A and hot cue 8 (same, last 4 bars start on this point) on track B. Perfect transitions everytime but... Really boring dj-wise, time consuming, etc."

Beatmatch,37k1lz,CORNFLAKE_PISS,1 point,Thu May 28 07:02:32 2015 UTC,I say start producing first. After 5 years of producing DJing just came naturally to me. I learned the basics in a weekend.
Beatmatch,37k1lz,Psythik,2,Thu May 28 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"no that s what you think  producing and djing are completely different.  producing is about being a good musician, djing is about making people dance and having a huge music culture.  i dont see how you could have gotten the basics of that in a weekend.  it s like saying yea i just bought this camera and i took a picture so i got the basics of photography down in a weekend."
Beatmatch,37k1lz,Kokkothespacemonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:57:32 2015 UTC,"Producing taught me the fundamentals of music theory, such as phrasing and keeping things in key. Those two things alone can mean the difference between a good DJ and a bad one. It also gave me a good feel for what different BPMs sound like, which is a crucial skill in learning how to beatmatch by ea. And it taught me how to effectively add samples and effects to a mix."
Beatmatch,37k1lz,Psythik,3,Mon Jun 1 10:13:36 2015 UTC,phrasing and effects dont make you a good dj these are necessary skills but not sufficient at all it s just a small part.  the difficulty of djing is acquiring the music culture and the feel for the dancefloor which can only be gained by experience.  to go back to the photography it s like saying well i understand shutter speed and aperture so i am a photographer.
Beatmatch,37k1lz,Kokkothespacemonkey,0,Mon Jun 1 13:56:48 2015 UTC,The basics take a weekend to learn regardless. DJing is super easy.

Beatmatch,37k1lz,Psythik,0,Fri May 29 02:47:25 2015 UTC,Perhaps. I also got in DJing after being a producer for several years so I also picked it up really quickly but I hear it's not super hard to learn as a new comer
Beatmatch,37k1lz,CORNFLAKE_PISS,2,Fri May 29 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's about the ear training. Regardless of what you start on, learning to identify different elements of songs and the roles of said elements is important for both DJing and producing."
Beatmatch,37k1lz,redbaaron,1 point,Sat May 30 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on the person learning it, like most things."
Beatmatch,37k1lz,mrturtle101,4,Sun May 31 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"Producing is much harder than djng.    You'll have a good grasp of the music theory behind DJing wo your musical background.  It's basically beats, bars, harmony, and musical phrasing.  The technical aspect to DJing can range from simple (basic mixing) to complex (scratching), but the hardest part to learn about DJing is knowing how to play for a crowd rather than just playing at a crowd.  Production requires as much engineering knowledge as musical knowledge and is quite a rabbit hole to delve into."
Beatmatch,37k1lz,dj_soo,3,Thu May 28 08:41:23 2015 UTC,"DJing will have higher up-front costs than producing. You can start producing off the bat with multitudes of cheap (some even free) production software. Production will have a steeper learning curve and granted that you already know music theory from piano and guitar, you'd still have to learn about audio processing and signal modulation in production. With that said, go with producing first.  DJ'ing has a far gentler learning curve than production, especially with today's technology where you don't even need to beatmatch anymore. Beatmatching the old, analog way takes quite a hefty amount of practice and shunted away quite a lot of interested learners when I was an officer at the DJ Club at UCSD. Today, Paris Hilton and Hodor from Game of Thrones are DJ'ing. My 5 year old son DJs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcrUSR90ODI  Because DJ'ing is so easy but maybe cost-prohibitive, and you'd want to do both eventually, just go with production first."

Other controllers like Novation's usually come bundled with Ableton Live 9 Lite or something similar. If you already have DAWs, then this isn't an issue. It also doesn't include mapping files for popular DAWs but I'm sure you can probably find them in forums online. It's a popular controller."

If there is no such pre-set mapping you can/have to do it yourself (which is usually what you want and no big problem)."
Beatmatch,37k1lz,TouchMyGochu,2,Fri May 29 07:57:26 2015 UTC,"Half a year ago I decided to dwelve deeper into music again and picked up two turntables + mixer and a midi controller at the same time. Since then then turntables were mostly unused, because when I have spare time usually I feel more like producing than DJing.. I don't regret buying them, because eventually I want to pick up Djing, but if I had planned things a little more carefully I might have been able to pick up some nice synths by now...  Sooo... doing both at the same time sure does require some free time (but since you are in high school that should not be too much of a problem), but you should get your priorities straight. Both Producing and Djing are things on which you can spend a loooot of time."

You can't map the menu buttons to act as modifiers but the four buttons in the bottom right are fantastic for modifying especially in 4 channel mode. I learned by watching youtube videos and messing around.   My mapoing uses the control for FX. The one downside is the traktor effects have three parameters (one is dey/wet and the other two are variables related to the effect). So I made each pad to trigger an effect on/off then have the two nobs above it and an adjacent one for the parameters. Whats cool is I made the four corner buttons hard clicks so I pressit and it stays pressed. Each one represents a channel and when its pressed the effects that are activated apply to that/those channel(s).   You could definitly map it to control songs but your biggest challenge would be scrolling through to choose cue points unless you do it all before hand.  Play/pause/cue, cross fading, EQ, pitch and FX should be easy. Nudging, sync, cross fade contour setting and headphone cue are intermediate. Whats hard is hot cues, scrolling, rolls/beat mashing, looping and advanced effects."
Beatmatch,37hygk,weemock,1 point,Wed May 27 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"I have the Launchkey Mini and it came with Ableton Live 9 Lite, which is completely meshed with the Mini. I'm thinking your Launch Key probably comes with ABL9L too. In ABL9L, it has basically the same setup as Traktor Pro's Remix Decks setup, letting you load lots of samples and triggering them on the fly with the Launch Key pads. The knobs can be set to control either volume or at default (at least for me) the various parameters of the last equipment/plug-in for that sample's patch chain. Samples can be triggered in sync, as well, just like in Traktor.  ABL9L probably will be the better route, especially if you can get it with your hardware for free, since the Launch Key can actually scroll through your rows of samples. In Traktor, that might be a rough feat in terms of MIDI-mapping (unless it has already been done in DJ Tech Tools maps pages).  EDIT: By me saying ABL9L is completely meshed with the Launch Key I was referring to the fact that you will not have to MIDI-map a single thing. Everything will work immediately - just drag/drop your samples to the slots and then you're ready to trigger them."

It's a slightly unusual cable but can be found online cheap.

The center area would be boxes that are checked off if the controller has that feature"

The community is very apt in answering questions for beginners, but I'd like to see more content on things beginners might not think of asking but will help them in the long run.

I personally seek video tutorials before written tutorials and suspect many others do as well. With the amount of experience here we could easily curate a library of videos.

A basic one would be the Numark Mixtrack Pro as an example Technics SL-1200 Mk2 (and other versions M3D MK5 M5G...) are the industry standard turntables. I personally start this way 2 x Mk2 + AH:22, even though it's a bit more expensive than just a controller :) Allen&Heath Xone : 22 is one of the best entry level mixer as well as the Nuo.    Nuo : Scratching, less effects   Xone : Mixing, great filter.  Hope it helps !"

Beatmatch,37dcby,weemock,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Most kids can make a mix with just Traktor Pro sofftware and any ridiculously cheap MIDI controller with a cross-fader. As Traktor has pretty spot-on beatmatching as long as you set the beat grids perfectly, it's actually almost impossible to screw up in your mix. If you're not sure whether you're ready to commit, and are just doing it for fun, I'd go this cheap route first before diving head-in and obtaining gig-worthy equipment.  Now if you're actually looking to performing live, either in gigs, house parties, etc., there is quite a bit of stigma for ""laptop DJs"" with nothing but a paltry iPad or Numark MIDI controller especially when in comparison with a DJ with an arsenal of 35-lbs Technics turntables and crates of vinyl (quite heavy in their own right). Granted, you may be able to overcome these superficial looks with great music but sometimes, people do take their appearance with more seriousness."

Beatmatch,37caev,Ykesha,-2,Tue May 26 17:02:58 2015 UTC,Just use a DAW. Learning how to edit in a DAW opens up some other possibilities when it comes to DJing so it doesn't hurt to learn the process.

Beatmatch,37caev,dj_soo,2,Tue May 26 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"I have no problem editing a mix in a DAW as long as you can do a reasonably close version of it live.    Editing a mix isn't something you should be looking at when you're just starting tho.  Every glaring mistake is something you can learn from when you're a new DJ, whereas when you've been doing it for a while, every mistake is just fucking annoying when all you want to do is make a mix for people to listen to repeatedly.  It's why people often distinguish between live mixes and studio mixes."

Beatmatch,37caev,Ykesha,1 point,Wed May 27 16:22:11 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? If I'm making an hour long mix that I'm planning to either upload or use to shop around gigs and make some simple mistake there is no way in hell I'm going to spend my time recording it all over again.   edit: I don't think it is a waste of time at all to listen to your mixes and learn from your mistakes. I record constantly and it is the #1 thing I tell everyone to do when they first start. If you can't actually mix shit than NO you shouldn't edit everything together to make it sound good but if you make a slight error making a mix I don't see a reason not to just fix it and get back to living your life.
Beatmatch,37caev,Sniktsnakt,1 point,Wed May 27 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"Relax. Everyone has different standards. I personally believe in the craft of djing as a performance art.   I grew up playing in bands, and if someone couldn't play an hour without an audible  fuck up, then they wouldnt be on the stage.   The DJs I grew up loving and saw live didn't make fuckups that were audible or they managed to hide them and that was on vinyl.  Musicians wouldn't dream of playing someone a recording with a mistake in it as a finished piece of their work, it would simply be embarrassing.   I approach djing the same way.  You say that an hour of your time is more valuable than re doing the mix and having a polished product with your name on it.   I disagree entirely."

I'm very confident it's not the new speaker having latency problems, it's your domestic stereo. Now, you have a without-latency-problem speaker to compare it to."

Beatmatch,37c3nj,dj_soo,2,Tue May 26 16:37:45 2015 UTC,It could just be that your stereo has digital delay and there's nothing you can do to change it.  Makes Beatmatching pretty much impossible.

Beatmatch,37aipr,over9000,1 point,Tue May 26 08:57:51 2015 UTC,"My advice, save up for a Numark NV. Usually around $600-700, and it's a good investment. Also, do lots of research online: reviews in video form AND go to product websites and read comments."
Beatmatch,37aipr,venomous_pastry,2,Tue May 26 05:41:45 2015 UTC,I think the NV is a bad investment.  It's just feels incredibly fragile and noticeably cheaper than most of the competing products in its price range.
Beatmatch,37aipr,dj_soo,1 point,Tue May 26 10:40:41 2015 UTC,"Reloop Beatmix. Started with this one and I regret nothing! It feels great and has everything you need. The only downside is the provided software (VDJ light), but its under 200 bucks so you could use the other 100 to purchase a good software and map the controller to that software.   This is what I did. I chose CrossDJ and again: I regret nothing. Of course Traktor would have been a more conservative choice, but you should really consider CrossDJ. It provides some features that no other software has and all the standard stuff is implemented in a great way."

I think for a limited time, Reloop was giving it out with Serato DJ license. I used Serato for couple small gigs (house parties/keggers/family events) and saved up enough to purchase Traktor. I didn't really like the fact that I couldn't remap controls in Serato. So I got Traktor and downloaded and modified a nice mapping for BM4.   I had Launchpad laying around that I midi mapped to stuff that I wanted. The trial and error approach to mapping took a while due to the learning curve. But it was definitely worth the hours. It is very rewarding to know your controls because you put the effort in setting it up. It makes the learning more fun. I can't wait to get better and start investing towards a CDJ/Turntable setup :)"

Beatmatch,379rze,Sir_Mr_Bman,3,Tue May 26 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"I finally checked one out in the shop.  Honestly, it feels really, really cheap.  Especially the screens.  Like the least bit of pressure could crack and shatter those screens.  The casing feels like some of the lowest end plastic they could have found.  The pots and faders all seem similarly cheap.  If you're just using it for home use and not taking it anywhere, it might be ok, but if you plan to gig with it, I'd choose something that feels more solid.  Given the choice, I would choose a ddj sr over the nv."
Beatmatch,379rze,dj_soo,1 point,Tue May 26 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"This probably wouldn't make sense as an upgrade, but it's worth mentioning that the Mixtrack Pro III has many design similarities with the NV."

I was using a shitty stanton scs.4dj and then I saw the NV at an expo before it was officially out.  I liked the features and thought it looked worthwhile for the price so I preordered it.  I've been really happy with the functionality and it's held up beautifully. To me it doesn't feel cheap, but I'm also petite so I needed something lightweight.  I have a flight case for it and I've transported it different places maybe two dozen times and it's fine.  Two weeks ago I used it outdoors to do music at a semi-pro sports game and she was a champ; four decks was very necessary!"
Beatmatch,379rze,deeblocks,1 point,Tue May 26 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I've gone through a lot of numark gear, turntables, mixers and a controller and the stuff always looks and feels a bit cheap which is what you get for the nicer price points, if you can afford it and like your sb why not upgrade to a ddj-sr or a reloop terminal mix controller, two of the best built mid range controllers no doubt about it."
Beatmatch,37aen1,fiddymfa,2,Tue May 26 04:10:43 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify so you get the right answer, what DAW is it? Also, what is the purpose of the mix, and what type of transitions are you talking about? If you know your DAW well, i should be pretty easy to fade out one track and fade in another, but I'm guessing you're after something more interesting?"
Beatmatch,37aen1,britty1983,1 point,Tue May 26 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"I've used FL Studio the most, but I could also use Logic if that's better. I'm mostly thinking about hip hop, so an example of a transition would be looping the first rap bar of the next song (probably EQ'd) while the previous song ends. Another transition could use the original song that is sampled before going into the hip hop song. Also, as far as I can tell, in FL Studio and Logic, it may be difficult to sequence something that changes BPM.  Edit: I just googled it, and changing BPM is easy, so forget that."
Beatmatch,37aen1,mrthbrd,1 point,Tue May 26 04:55:43 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to make mixes in FL Studio. With enough effort, you can make them sound better and more seamless than actual DJ mixes.

So you can't run the sampler with the add on pads while hitting cues on the Sx - you still have to switch between layers."

Beatmatch,37943e,zoink43,2,Mon May 25 23:13:06 2015 UTC,"It's all mapped out already.  Just hit the sample button above the pads and it changes to sample control.  Apply samples to your sp-1 slots and you're good to go.  You can choose where to launch (by using cue points) or even a specific section of the track (by using saved loops) and you can choose how the trigger works (hold to play whole sample, play whole sample at a press, or press to trigger sample and press again to stop).  They will also be velocity sensitive.  You get 4 banks of 6 samples so you can have up to 30 individual samples set up.  You can use either side to control the banks so you can drum cue points on one side while launching samples on the other.  You can also route the samples how you want - to a specific channel, to the master and to a 5th, auxiliary channel."

Beatmatch,3784h4,EmotionlessEmoticon,2,Mon May 25 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"Hi - sorry for any confusion, I have the Boss FS-5U (http://www.amazon.co.uk/BOSS-FS-5U-Boss-UnLatched-Footswitch/dp/B0002D01PY) which connects to the S4 via 1/4 inch cable, so that you can press it with your foot to activate the loop recorder in Traktor.  It works in a similar way to a traditional loop pedal for a guitar (except 1. It's a lot, lot cheaper 2. It just sends a control signal telling Traktor to start the loop recording, rather than the pedal actually doing anything with the audio). Once I have had a play around with it a bit I'll feedback on whether or not it's is worth it.  On another note, you can buy actual midi footpedals, such as this one: http://www.guitarguitar.co.uk/keyboards/detail.asp?stock=10022411394013&gclid=Cj0KEQjwkIurBRDwoZfi1bGCxocBEiQAmcs-eqYSkaYok4bFqBlN2TIL6P5HLk9Co7DhLnX1qB387vcaAlr_8P8HAQ though I'm not sure how easy it would be to mix and step on the correct pedal simultaneously."

Beatmatch,377taz,Psythik,1 point,Mon May 25 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's no way to try out Serato as far as I know unless you already own compatible hardware. Sure there's Offline Mode, but it's very restricted and thus can't be used as an indicator of quality.  Coming from VDJ I hated Serato at first. From a first glance it looks extremely basic and stripped down compared to it. But after about a week it started to grow on me and now I can't even imagine going back to VDJ. The experience feels so much ""tighter"", while VDJ seems too ""synthetic"" to me now, if that makes any sense."
Beatmatch,377taz,dj_soo,2,Mon May 25 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"I find serato much more fluid than anything else.  With serato, I can just dj.  Everything else I feel like I have to worry about all these other features."
Beatmatch,377taz,AlexEscapedFate,1 point,Mon May 25 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"To play devils advocate (I've went to vdj, traktor, serato, and back to traktor), Traktor opens up the realms of creativity and possibility, it analyses key, you can beat jump (which just got added to serato), its effects are supreme (I hate serato's effects), and it has capabilities to be run side by side with ableton or other live DAWs (Serato scratch live had the bridge, but they're moving forward with serato DJ and leaving scratch live users in the dust).   However, What serato excels at is fluidity (I find traktors browsing to be kinda clunky), simplicity (not having all those features brings you closer to actual DJ'ing), stability(??? I've never had traktor crash on me, and I have had serato crash, but people swear by the stability of serato), and as someone who uses turntables, the options of serato vinyl.   The way I break it down to people who are on the fence about both programs is that its pretty much like Android VS IOS (IPhone). Traktor, like android, is going to be able to give you more and broaden what you can do with it, but this comes at a cost of clunkiness, you might be overwhelmed, or frankly you just won't need the features. Serato, like IOS (iPhone), is more polished, and a bit smoother at the cost of features.   Just my two cents, but traktor is pretty cool if you're serious about beat matching because you don't have stacked waveforms like in serato. Also, I'd rather have something and not need it, that not have it and need it. I love pushing buttons on my maschine and vinyl💕  Try going to guitar center, they usually have controllers on display that you can play with. Worst case scenario, you can look at YouTube comparisons. :)   Sorry for the long rant guys, happy beatmatching!"
Beatmatch,377taz,dj_soo,1 point,Tue May 26 16:13:24 2015 UTC,I've made that android vs iOS analogy many times on here and it's pretty much the best way to describe the difference.  Both have their strengths and weaknesses and both tend to excel more at certain things although the gap between them is getting narrower.
Beatmatch,377taz,Aexibit,1 point,Tue May 26 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"The Traktor S2 was my first controller. You can't go wrong with it. It is well constructed and has more than enough functionality for someone learning and even more past that if you are interested.  That said, look into the differences between Serato DJ and Traktor and decide which will fit the direction you are interested in. I just recently made the switch from Traktor to Serato DJ. There are things in Traktor I miss, but there were also a lot of things I never used.  Either way you go, you'll end up with a great controller connected to a great piece of software."

Beatmatch,378kq6,Theredditoerer,1 point,Mon May 25 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the exact percentages. Instead, see this as an opportunity to learn how to beatmatch using more than just the pitch slider. You're supposed to use the jogwheel and the pitch bend as well.  Or just use sync. That's what I would do if I had a Mixtrack. The pitch slider range on the thing isn't really meant for beatmatching since it's not long enough. It needs to be at least 2-3 times longer in order to get anywhere near accurate results."
Beatmatch,378kq6,Psythik,0,Mon May 25 20:02:16 2015 UTC,OK so I should use sync. It feels nooby but I guess taking 0.8 and timing it by x number of tempo change isn't that hard either. Still. Sync... but if there is a 0.8 tempo difference wouldn't it get off bat after a while?
Beatmatch,378kq6,Psythik,1 point,Mon May 25 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"It would fairly quickly. That's where the jogwheel and pitch bend come in. You're constantly adjusting it to keep it in line until the mix is done. Takes a lot of practice to get the hang of, but is a lot more rewarding than syncing everything."
Beatmatch,378kq6,dj_soo,1 point,Mon May 25 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, sync is exactly that but automated. Do you basically play with the jog wheel all the time trying to get in on beat?"

Beatmatch,378kq6,dj_soo,1 point,Tue May 26 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"You will train to ear to hear better between tracks.  You will still be able to mix if the Bpm detection wrong.  You can mix tracks with changing tempos easily.  If your beatgrids are off, you can still mix.  You won't waste so much time setting beatgrids and can spend that time DJing or digging for music.  You can mix tracks with live drummers that don't have finely quantized beats.  It's just more fun."

Just make sure to play music that is not too complicated- you want the music to fill the background, not to interfere with people chatting up etc. Just enjoy yourself putting down an awesome set with amazing tracks, when you nail it, people WILL notice and you WILL hear it.

Beatmatch,376x4s,bossplayers,3,Mon May 25 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"I've been djing since the start of this year. What worked great for me was after when I have beat matched the song. I cue in the incoming song into my head phones, I cut the high and low of the incoming song and gradually raise the volume.  After when the volume is 75% in, I turn up the low from incoming and turn down the low for the outgoing song.   From there its just a matter of lowering the volume of the outgoing. This helped for me. (not sure if im doing it right)   I'm starting to use echo and roll to make short loops on the outgoing and bringing the incoming song in.."
Beatmatch,376x4s,Ykesha,3,Mon May 25 11:49:57 2015 UTC,"Keep practicing. I've done bars, clubs, beach parties and festivals over the last 2 years and I still practice constantly. Not every transition has to be some perfect sounding 1min mix as the songs blend together. Sometimes you blend and sometimes you slam. The more methods of transitioning you know the better.   If you are serious about DJing you need to realize that 2 months isn't shit. A year and a 1/2 ago I was playing like 15-16 tracks in an hour. My last night out I went through 38 tracks (House and Breaks) and every transition was on point. I blended some and others I cut quick. I am a lot better than I was but I know there is still room to grow and it is going to take lots of experimentation and long nights of practice.  Record your transitions and post them here like others have said."
Beatmatch,376x4s,Ryike93,3,Mon May 25 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice. I've been a bedroom DJ for almost a year, and there are three things that really got my transitions down (mind you I don't have dozens of transitions in my arsenal).   First. Read read read. Got a question about something you think you're doing incorrectly? Google that question. Read any article, site, forum that catches your eye. Some info will be rubbish but that won't matter when you stumble upon a piece of advise that will ultimately help you.   Second. Listen to professional mixes and podcasts. Try to listen to the transitions you hear, pick out when the transition starts and try to decipher exactly what the DJ is doing to create their transition. With this tip you have to be careful. I've read that a lot of podcasts and mixes get made in a DAW which would eliminate possible errors, but it's still great practice to try and replicate them with your mixer.   Third and finally. Record and listen to your mixes. Try and fix what you don't like and eventually you will hear improvement.   Now you said you've only been doing this for two months? Mate, if you're ready to give up now that tells me you have very little passion for what you're doing. Prove me wrong and post a mix to the weekly feedback thread so we can hear what you're creating, and help you improve."
Beatmatch,376x4s,ithinkmynameismoose,2,Tue May 26 03:47:39 2015 UTC,I had the same problem and it turned out to be that I was too focused on the waveforms. Know your music and drop the new song when it feels right. Cut lows and fade in.

Beatmatch,376x4s,hondajvx,2,Mon May 25 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I've been going over a year and most my transitions are still obvious. My beat matching is still a bit whack from time to time as well. I usually mix outro and Intro because I feel it keeps the feeling better sometimes.   Back into topic, don't be to disheartened practice makes perfect and there's no such thing as perfect as different people like different things. A lot of the top name djs often slam tunes in obviously."
Beatmatch,376x4s,daddy-dj,2,Mon May 25 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"Give it a break for a while, read some books, play some video games, if you're not in the mood to do it, you won't do it as well.  If in a week or so you feel like doing some mixing have at it.  (This happens to me all the time with video games, I'll just stare at my games like ""none of these look fun.""

Beatmatch,376x4s,FNKTN,2,Mon May 25 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"Harmonic mixing, proper EQing, not playing songs all the way through, and knowing your music. These are techniques that exemplify the difference between a shit DJ and a good one. Read up on what works and what doesn't, use intros in songs to your advantage, and look at different kinds of music. If you're playing nothing but generic 4 on the floor house, you're less likely to grow in skill. Broaden your horizons and try a different type of music. Hip hop, trap, dubstep, twerk, glitch hop, breaks, DnB, pop, ect. All have very different ways of being mixed. If you only know one way of mixing, and it's not working, you'll go insane."

Record your sets, analyze what went wrong and more importantly what went right and build off of that! Good luck man!

But will there be a noticeable difference in quality or output levels when mixing two tracks? One on the RCA master output, and one on the headphone (Y-cable split) output. I assume in a smaller club with a smaller sound system may not be a problem, but would it be noticeable it a bigger club?"
Beatmatch,377zo2,tmccoy00,1 point,Mon May 25 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"What I understand, balanced outputs and cables are important when the connection has some distance between the sources. But if I'm using is as a sound-card from laptop to mixer the distance is not an issue and interference is of minimal concern."
Beatmatch,377zo2,tmccoy00,1 point,Mon May 25 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, balanced outputs work by having a 'clean' signal sent back from the receiving device (in your case the mixer) to the sending device (in your case the Z1 or soundcard). This clean signal will pick up some noise from the environment, and this noise will be pretty much identical to the noise picked up by the 'forwards' cable (the signal actually carrying the music from the Z1 to the mixer). The signal from the 'clean' wire is then subtracted from the music signal, so that the noise is removed (or at least reduced) from the music. This is very important for long distances (think 5 metres and above) as there is more cable to pick up more interference from the atmosphere, so the music would be more noisy, however for short distances (e.g. patch cables or from a sound card/z1 to a mixer) then so little interference is picked up by the cable anyway that it's not necessary to have the output balanced.  Balanced output types: XLR TRS (a.k.a. 1/4 inch jack)*  Unbalanced output types: RCA 3.5mm jack 1/4 inch jack*  1/4 inch can be balance or unbalanced, depending on the usage. Usually any 1/4 inch output from a controller will be balanced."

Beatmatch,3740b3,dguy101,3,Sun May 24 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"You can start by mastering the concept of phasing. Essentially, every song has a layout revolving around bars. If you listen to a drop, normally there will be 3 or 7 bars of the drop, a bar that varies from this immediately after, and then another 3 or 7 bars that repeats the first with a few added things. Keeping that in mind, it is very easy to transition a song in after the first portion of a drop. Utilize filters, echo outs, and samples to help make these transitions more fluid. Additionally, look for breaks in the song where there is only instrumental. You can loop these and transition a song in on the start of the loop, or throw a song with an instrumental intro in at the start of a verse, and have the vocals of the incoming song come in at the break."

Beatmatch,3740b3,HonkyDonky,2,Sun May 24 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Phasing as I know it is two things:   You can use it as a technique to beatmatch two tracks by using the pitch fader as a means to speed up or slow down the incoming track until the beats are in line and the BPM is as well. See here :http://djtechtools.com/2008/06/13/phasing-old-school-beatmatching-for-all/ If you take two of the same tracks and double them up and have them both playing, you can take one of the tracks and just slightly nudge it so that it's a bit slower or faster than the incoming track. It makes a sound similar to what the Phaser FX would make."

You know how people talk about 4x4 beats? or four on the floor or whatever? you count to 4, 4 times. on that last 4 there is usually a drum fill. that fill is the end of the phrase, so to speak. so once you learn to recognize and count the beats, as well as learning the progressions of your tracks, you'll figure shit out by yourself. For instance; a build is usually 8 bars, the first 4 bars are usually mellow or a plateau, and then the last 4 build and then drop the beat. Once your ears are trained to pick it up you'll be able to mix much quicker than you thought you could, especially with songs you've memorized or produced."

Beatmatch,3711gb,DamnPROFESSIONAL,4,Sat May 23 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, if you're wanting to get into scratching/turntablism you'll need a high torque motor. Super OEM tables (like the Audio Technica AT-LP1240, Stanton ST-150 or STR8-150, Reloop RP-7000, etc.) are a good choice as are Numark TTX's, used Technics or Vestax PDXs are your best bet. They're just not cheap. Lowest torque table I'd really recommend is the Audio Technica AP-LP120. It's not quite as powerful as the super OEM's listed above, but it's quite solid. They run about $250 each, although sometimes can be found for less. I'm not a big fan of the Stanton tables outside of the ST/STR8-150s, as they're almost 100% plastic and don't really hold up well, although I'd assume the ones you linked would be similar torque to the AT-LP120s.   The only really tough decision is how much you spend based on how into it you think you'll get. If you get really into it, you'll probably want to upgrade. The phrase ""Buy nice or buy twice"" gets thrown around a lot, although to put it into perspective, most of us can only say that because we did buy twice. Once you get a feel for it, your style and flow may change. Just some thoughts."

I eventually upgraded to a pair of numark ttx, and I've had those for almost a decade. I bought one new and found one used on ebay. I'd suggest going that route in order to save some money.

Butter Rugs are a common suggestion for turntablists. I personally had no real issue even on way worse decks than the 120s (Numark TT-1650s) once I paid more attention to how much pressure I was using, and definitely when I upgraded my needles to the Shure M44-G's (the M44-7's are well known for scratching, and the G's are in similar vein, but better bass and less tinny if you're playing dance music)."

Beatmatch,370643,Runninback405,2,Sat May 23 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that anyone will hear any difference, as going on the file size of the MP3, you've used either 320 Kbps or V0.  With high bitrate MP3, you can be trained to be a better listener when it comes to differentiating between files, but that doesn't mean that you'll hear a difference. Most people who claim that they can hear a difference have not been trained, nor have they done any scientific tests, so they're just worthless anecdotes really.  All of my CDs and vinyl are ripped to FLAC files, but I'm not claiming that I would notice a difference between FLAC and MP3 in a proper double-blind listening test or ABX test."
Beatmatch,370643,SigmaTheDJ,1 point,Sat May 23 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the response,  Yeah you're right, Switch was set to convert the file to 320 kbps. Even though it doesn't look very 320 kbps with that very prominent line going through the graph at 16 kHz. It looks kind of like a 128 kbps that's trying to pretend it's a 320, but whatever, as long as my friends don't notice a loss in quality."
Beatmatch,370643,SigmaTheDJ,2,Sat May 23 18:31:27 2015 UTC,The line at 16 KHz is likely present because the MP3 encoder's algorithm decided that there was little of value above that level. It doesn't mean that the resulting MP3 isn't transparent.
Beatmatch,370643,playmochi,2,Sat May 23 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"I think you should always strive for the best sound possible in all situations. Even if this is just for a mix for your friends, you never know! The song might be used for a festival one day.  To be honest any song you get that looks like more than 320 on a spectrogram will probably be good enough to be played across a majority of sound systems, even if you convert that sound down to 320 at the mix stage.  Then again - in terms of that unhearable sound past the 20khz range - the stuff that gets cut out by the compression of mp3 is sometimes called the 'soul' of a song. A lot of house heads like to point at these unheard frequencies as that 'feel' you get from really good music that is lost due to compression"
Beatmatch,370643,dj_soo,1 point,Sat May 23 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"I've never heard about that 'soul of the song' theory, but that's pretty interesting. Is there any science behind that? I'm going to go ahead and assume that there is not. Because those frequencies are way to high to be something that a human could feel in a way like when you feel the thump of a kick drum."
Beatmatch,370643,playmochi,1 point,Sat May 23 18:41:05 2015 UTC,It's funny that people think that because most producers these days are going to cut around 20khz (and below 30hz) in the track making process anyway.
Beatmatch,370643,dj_soo,1 point,Mon May 25 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"I know right? But some of my house gurus seem to feel that these unheard frequencies really contribute to how a song feels on good systems, where even house noobs can really 'feel' the good music. Chalk it up to wishful thinking perhaps!"
Beatmatch,370643,dj_soo,2,Wed May 27 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"this is how mp3s work.  They remove certain frequencies in order to get the file size down that amount.  It's why it's called ""lossy"" compression because you will lose some parts of the audio.  Now whether it's audible or not can be up for some debate.  Most blind tests have shown that no one can really hear an audible difference between lossless and lossy - especially working with 320 files.  In the case of an actual mix tho, if your track sources are MP3, what you will be doing is called ""transcoding"" you tracks.  Meaning the source files already had the lossy compression process done to it, and now you're running it through again potentially losing even more information.  So there may be an audible quality change, but honestly, it's not going to a huge amount.  For a free mix, it's fine.  For tracks you intend to play out in clubs on big system, transcoding is something you want to avoid though.  In the 90s, we were listening to 5th generation copies of cassette mixtapes and it sounded like shit, but we didn't care - if it was a great dj mix, it was a great DJ mix.  In the early 00s, one of my favourite mixtapes was a rip of what sounded like a 96 kb stream from an early online radio - didn't matter - still a great mix."
Beatmatch,370643,dj_soo,1 point,Sat May 23 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm going to stick with the smaller file since it won't make much of a difference, if any. Thanks!  But a follow up question: So basically the only time it's necessary to use lossless files is when you're playing on a big sound system? I would think that a perfect 320 mp3 that's cut right at 20 kHz would be sufficient since anything above that can't be heard by a human ear anyway, no?"
Beatmatch,370643,golergka,1 point,Sun May 24 00:16:10 2015 UTC,"It really depends on who you talk to.  I use 320 MP3s and the occasional ALAC encoded file (apple's version of FLAC) and I don't hear a difference and I've played on everything from cheap, ghetto jurry-rigged systems to $100,000 funktion-one systems to massive outdoor festival line arrays.  Some people swear they can hear a difference but I don't know if they've ever done a proper blind test and I feel like it's more placebo than anything.  I think the quality of the gear and system and the way it's tuned and set up for a room is going to matter more than the difference between wav and 320 MP3.  Anything 192 and below tho and it does get noticeable."
Beatmatch,370643,Define_It,1 point,Sun May 24 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"Okay I see what you're saying. I hope those people are wrong and that there isn't a noticeable difference because the vast majority of my collection is 320 mp3's! Either way, thanks for the thorough and helpful response!"
Beatmatch,370643,dj_soo,2,Sun May 24 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"Even if there is an audible difference (which is debatable) the people that can hear are so small in number that it really isn't a huge deal.  And imo, the people who think they can hear a difference are likely doing it at home on studio monitors - not in a club at high volumes with copious amounts of background noise."
Beatmatch,370643,golergka,1 point,Sun May 24 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"Define ""big"". This is big, but the quality is clearly lacking. On the other hand, if you're going to play on Funktion One system, you're probably better off with lossless files — not only because the system itself is so good, but also because clubs that install it tend to have a really snobby audience with decent ears."

Beatmatch,370643,golergka,1 point,Mon May 25 15:39:44 2015 UTC,I've played on funktion ones - I've never heard a difference between 320 mp3s and lossless files even when mixing between them.  I think the quality of the production and the quality of the gear you're playing on will make a bigger difference.
Beatmatch,370643,Psythik,1 point,Mon May 25 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"I guess you had correctly compressed mp3s, which not always may be the case; when I compared mp3s created by different compression algorithms, I thought I was able to hear the difference on my monitors. But I never played on funktion yet :("
Beatmatch,370643,golergka,1 point,Tue May 26 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"The best encoder for MP3 is LAME.    I can believe hearing a slight difference when using studio monitors because those are designed to be as accurate as possible.  In a club at high volumes with ambient noise, I think it's a lot harder to hear the difference.  The best way to tell  if there really is a difference would be to create blind test and see if it's actually the case.  Grab a couple wav files and encode at 320 and then get a friend to play them back and forth without telling you which is which. Record your results and see if it's actually correct."

Beatmatch,370mjf,Fer22f,4,Sat May 23 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"Ill write something helpful, unlike the other guys here. If you have no idea what music you want to listen to and mix, it is a bit strange that you want to become a DJ. Normally, becoming a DJ comes out of a love for your music. Nevertheless,  if you want to develop your music tastes and start working on a library,  you need to know good places to look.  Youtube is a great place to find new music.  There are plenty of music channels that have lots of different artists in lots of genres. I suggest that whenever you find a genre you really love, go out and seek lots of that genre. Listen to mixes of it. Remember to write down any song that catches your fancy. If you find a song you love, check out more by that artist. Again, write down any song that takes your fancy.  After a while you should have quite a long list of songs. Now you can head to a website called Beatport. They sell high quality downloads of songs. Try to find all of the songs you wrote down and add them to your cart. They don't have everything but they have most electronic music that has been released.   Now you go through your cart and take out the tracks that don't really resonate with you anymore. This is to save money but also because you should try to always play music that you enjoy listening to. Now you can buy your tracks and download them. Try to always keep your DJ music separate from your casual library of music.  After you have downloaded your music, use an mp3 tagger to tag the genre of your music and sort out the file names (beatport sometimes spits out wierd file names). You can organise your music into folders or playlists based on genre aswell, but library management is a pretty personal thing and it might take some time to develop your own way of doing things.  Hope this helps!"

You may want to prepare a playlist beforehand with all of the songs you'd like to play, or make separate folders by genre, key, energy level, or some other parameter. It's definitely harder to quickly search for songs - only the XDJ-1000 has a QWERTY keyboard.  I've heard FAT32 works best - it may be the default for many flash drives. I bought two SanDisk Ultra Fit for $9.99 each. They're 16 GB, USB 3.0 drives, and they're very low-profile. This makes them easy to lose, but also reduces the chance of hitting them while they're in the CDJ and breaking either the thumb drive or the USB slot of the CDJ.

I love traktor and use it all the time, but others don't because it isn't for them. I'd recommend checking out the demo and playing with it a bit since your Mixtrack Pro II will work with it.  If you need a secondary controller, Serato has finally started implementing useful MIDI features, so you can integrate other things, but it's very limited compared to Traktor. It is, however, easier to map in Serato. What I think you need to do is decide what you want. The MPD32 will do a lot, and you may have a lot of wasted features. You may be better off with a nanokontrol, or even the APCMini, depending.  The important thing to do is figure out what you want to do. You want to add a third deck? That's really hard to do in Serato. You want to use the sampler? Not as hard. The MPD is compatible in that it is a MIDI controller and Serato accepts MIDI. You will need to either map it yourself or find someone else's mapping file."
Beatmatch,36vkjd,brokenstack,1 point,Fri May 22 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah they each have their purposes. Serato is generally catered to the former vinyl purists who want all the fancy features digital DJs have access to, while Traktor is aimed towards controllerists who play EDM. That said, they're both capable of doing the same things, they just have their own ways of going about it.   Also there's Virtual DJ, which caters to the mobile DJ crowd with its flexibility. And Mixxx, for broke-ass DJs. And DJay, for lazy DJs who don't want to go through the effort of acquiring a music library."
Beatmatch,36vkjd,Psythik,1 point,Sat May 23 01:47:34 2015 UTC,"Serato Scratch Live was definitely as you describe it, but Serato DJ is far closer to the Traktor experience. Serato has a better browser and flex grids (both of which are big advantages over Traktor) but Traktor has (for me) a better interface, and better effects.  Other than that, I agree 100% with the rest of your statements."
Beatmatch,36vkjd,brokenstack,1 point,Tue May 26 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the one thing that I don't like about Serato is the browser. Why do I have to make crates when I've already organized all my music into folders? I just want a ""show all music on my hard drive"" option. That's the one thing I miss from Virtual DJ.   Right now I don't even bother with Serato's browser. I simply enabled BPM and Key view in Windows Explorer and it works well.   Edit: Fixed autocorrect"
Beatmatch,36vkjd,Psythik,1 point,Wed May 27 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"I find so much value using Traktor's browser, even though it's almost useless. But I organize my music folders by artist/album, so it's not convenient to that method of DJing. It's easier on my folder structure, and then Traktor handles the heavy lifting.  You also don't HAVE to make crates. You can just put everything in the collection and have all of your sorting tools right there."
Beatmatch,36vkjd,brokenstack,2,Wed May 27 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"(Disclaimer: I'm not too familiar with serato)  The MPD32 is definetly overkill for just using it to launch samples, doesn't matter if traktor or serato. First you should decide which features you want, form the top of my head I'd say number of knobs/faders (for volume control) and number of buttons (for smaple launch) are the most important. Best bang for the buck in terms of numbers of buttons will be the launchpad mini, also there exist tons of mappings for it so you wouldn't even have to do one by yourself (I recommend it, though), if you don't need that many buttons but rather have some more knobs you should look into the LPD8 (if you find it has too less buttons consider buying two of it, also the buttons are velocity sensitive afaik), another controller worth looking into is the behringer CMD LC1/DC1 (yes i know behringer but these cmd controllers actually aren't bad, especially for the price). The akai APC mini has many buttons and faders, too (may be even better than the launchpad because of the faders).   Now for the software configuration, you won't have any problem with traktor at all, there are tons of mappings out there (google [insert controller name] traktor mapping). With traktor any feature can be mapped to any controller. Also traktor is capable of 64 smaples per remix deck.  I'm not too familiar with serato but I've read somewhere that it is now possible to map some controls to a third party controller, but I don't know to which extend (about halfway down the page). The serato guys around here will have more answers on this one."
Beatmatch,36vkjd,zoink43,1 point,Fri May 22 14:19:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the lengthy reply.  Can you elaborate on why the mpd32 is overkill though?  Kinda newer to the DJ world and am curious about what it is able to do.  Is it something along the lines of what Richie Hawtin or deadmau5 use?
Beatmatch,36vkjd,zoink43,2,Fri May 22 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"The MPD32 is, in my opinion, more geared towards production (especially production of hip hop). Take the feature list, everything crossed out isn't necessary for the use of launching a few samples:  16 velocity- and pressure-sensitive MPC pad  4 pad banks for instant access to 64 samples total  8 Q-Link faders, 8 Q-Link knobs, 8 Q-Link buttons, all assignable  3 Q-Link banks for a total of 72 parameter controls  2 assignable footswitch inputs, 1 expression-pedal input  Classic MPC Note Repeat, MPC Swing, 16 Level, Full Level, and Tap Tempo  Class-compliant, USB-powered, no drivers or power adapter required  18 factory DAW presets, 11 user-assignable DAW presets  Works with virtually any MIDI software or MIDI hardware  Ableton Live Lite Akai Pro Edition included  Large backlit custom LCD screen  Dedicated transport control  ""Q-Link"" can be easily replicated with traktor modifiers.  I wouldn't say it's a bad unit, but I think for $200 you can get a more efficient controller better suited towards your use.  I don't know about deadmau5, but richie hawtin uses a step-sequncer (ableton push/NI maschine) in conjunction with traktor.   Here are some more in-depth examples of setups similar to richie's:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2byCiDOIO7w   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pohTY2x0J2Q   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnzrT7jaKU (from the seven minute mark on)  http://youtu.be/-aU5T0jcg1o?t=43m  (from min. 43:00 on)  One thing all these have in common is that they are spinning more techno-y sounds. These kind of tracks allow for a lot of layering as they are pretty minimalistc itself and allow lots of added elements."

I'd assign a button for MIDI control to toggle it on and off, or a keyboard command. It sucks, but it's the reality right now in Traktor."

Beatmatch,36rga4,dj_soo,1 point,Thu May 21 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling NI knows about it, but it's probably due to the fact that when using timecode Traktor never receives a signal that tells it scratching is happening.

Even if you don't end up sticking with Traktor it's one of the most popular platforms and chances are you'll play on it for a house party/gig.

A lot of Traktors functionality is not immediately apparent on the surface level, but can be accessed well with MIDI mapping. What worked for me was first getting a handle on the basic skills in VDJ, running into the limits of that program, and finding ways to surpass those limits in Traktor via MIDI mapping."

I definitely was able to get some decent results out of VDJ, but the language-based mapping engine just never clicked for me. Traktors mapping makes more sense to me in that its about conditions, modifiers, and options as opposed to what amounts to a coding/scripting workflow in VDJ, so you could definitely say I just didn't know what I was doing at the time. Might go back and check it out, I definitely like what I've played around with in version 8, and goddamn do I miss that Beat Grid effect.  *As far as what kind of mapping you can do in Traktor that you can't in VDJ, mappings like the Midi Fighter Effects mapping give some really good examples of multi-conditional triggers of events when you press a given combo of four buttons.

Beatmatch,36p78s,CaptainBeluga,1 point,Thu May 21 02:18:51 2015 UTC,"If you want to make remixes you have a long road agead of you because you will be creating your own music and that takes a lot of time to learn how to do well.  If you want to do mashups, which is combining parts of two or more songs into one track, it will be easier. You can do it live on a DJ program like traktor and record it, or you can do it in a DAW. A DAW is what we use to produce music, but it works well for mashups. Some examples of these would be FL studio or Ableton Live.

Beatmatch,36q6dk,copeybitcoin,3,Thu May 21 06:29:07 2015 UTC,"Search YouTube for tropical house mix, island house mix, beach club mix, and so on...  Look for mixes with track lists. Search for tracks from said list on sites like Beatport and Soundcloud and follow links to the labels the songs are on, artists the producers have collaborated with, and suggestions of other stuff you might like.   Or, search music sites for ""tropical house..."" tack on ""Various artists"" for compilations... Ie, https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Tropical%20House%2BVarious%20Artists&c=music  Also look for compilation albums from major tropical resort clubs. Cocoon Beach Club in Bali has a bunch of CD releases for example such as ""Cocoon. Transformation. Volume 1.""  Keep in mind however that there's really no such thing as ""Tropical House"" it's just House that for some reason sounds airy/beach appropriate but grand scheme of thing that's all House. If you look at the track lists for most ""Tropical House"" mixes you'll find a mix of plain ole House, Tech House, Deep House, and Progressive House with no real definable binding elements.  Wikipedia has a page for Tropical House, some sites are adding it as a filter, and there are definitely producers labelling their tracks as such but if you read the characteristics they apply to all House. And most ""tropical house"" mixes have the same track lists as ""chill house"" or ""deep house"" mixes. With sub-genres like Tribal House there are actually unique defining characteristics like the drums or influences... not so much with ""Tropical"" it's just House that feels ""chill"" which come on... that's what House is."

Beatmatch,36pccz,pigferret,3,Thu May 21 05:48:02 2015 UTC,"If you want to create remixes, a controller isn't going to help you much (unless you're really good). While you can do some basic remixing on it, a DDJ-SX is meant more for DJing than production.   What you actually want to look into is DAW software. Personally I'd recommend FL Studio or Ableton Live. Both are great for creating remixes, and they also have the option to perform them live.  As far as hardware is concerned, you'll want something more like a Launchpad APC 40 than a DDJ-SX. I'd also recommend adding a mixer board APC 40 later on should you get serious, but for an amateur it's entirely optional given that most DAW mixer functions can be controlled in software."
Beatmatch,36pccz,Psythik,2,Thu May 21 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"I prefer the APC40 to a Launchpad. You get the button matrix, but you also get faders and knobs. Depends on what software you're running how easy it is to get connected though."

Crossfader is a bit stiffer than a typical mixer as well. This is the Mk1 model, the Mk2 offers RGB lighting with the button matrix, rather than just red, orange, and green, as well as some other features that I'm too lazy to look up at the moment.

Beatmatch,36nrdg,zclub,3,Wed May 20 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"DMX devices are measured in channels... for instance, if your fixtures used 16 channels each then you could fit 32 in a universe.  Remember you can run as many fixtures as you like off the same channel: In my old theatre, all of the house lights ran off Channel 1 of a universe we used specifically for house and architectural lights. This meant every fixture on Ch1 did exactly the same thing, and ran off one fader.  I'd advise you only run 32~ fixtures off a single run of DMX cable, because different fixtures treat the signal differently: Some act as repeaters, sending a new full-strength signal, and some just don't.  Elation make some decent inexpensive DMX splitters. Can't remember the model number right now, but check their website."

Your cut into million voices was too sudden as you cut off the vocals of next to me. The transition out of million voices into another you was good. You started the next transition in phrase but the drop wasn't as impacting as I would have preferred. It worked, but it could have been better, it might have been because the drop didn't fit in with the vibe of another you. The transition from 9:40 ish to 10:10 was smooth. The transition from melody into buzzer was nice but again, the two songs don't have the same kind of feel which made the drop of buzzer good, but it wasn't great. For me at least I like the drops to have the same feel but if you were going for a drop that'd surprise the audience then it may work. It may just be my style versus your style of mixing. Your cut into karate worked though as both tracks have the same energetic feel to it, same with the chop out of karate into the next track. If you can recreate this part then you have the right idea for transitioning from drop to drop of progressive house. Once you have that, start playing around with EQs, overlapping songs while the drop of one song is still going and the such. Just play around with it. Good job, look forward to your next one"

I had two main problems:   I record mixes on Audacity by plugging my controller into my laptop input jack, and if I so choose, I can hear the main output through my computer speakers. The sound lags a bit from the headphone output and wave forms, though, so I only use the headphones to listen. The problem is that the volume is far from constant across all tracks, despite me keeping the gain around the same spot (some of my files are just lower volume, I guess, especially, say, digitized record tracks). Is there a good way to avoid this.  Phrasing - I don't always mix in key, and that's not a problem when I can use intros, outtros, and breaks to stop melodies and audio from clashing, but my transitions between Essence of a Dream and It's You, and then Lose It and Future Fusion sound off because the main melodies came in earlier than I anticipated and clashed with the outgoing tracks.

Not sure what gear you have but if there is a volume level light on the gear, use that and keep it out of the red as it's easier than going by ear. (As for the delay issue, you could get a splitter and record what is going to speakers instead of into the laptop as that's just going to be a headache.) Mix in key- can't help you there.

I might wanted to have cut some of the transitions a little bit earlier though, some of them are a bit too floating. The transition at around 23 min into Attica was probably not the best either.

A friend of a friend taught me basic beat matching but did not say a word about phrasing. I kinda figured the bars thing out on my own, but not phrases, and continued practicing by counting fours and eights. Sometimes I would hit the first beat of a new phrase by accident and think ""Wow, that sounded great, I wish I could actively keep track of that kind of timing"". Only a few days ago I finally fully learned about phrasing and, oh boy, did my mixing improve vastly over night.. I think. :) So, my first recording out in public, happy to hear your feedback of any kind!  I am a little bit annoyed that almost all my tunes have at least one major break somewhere in the middle and experimented a little on bridging a break with the beat from the next tune, not very successful. Tips on that topic are also appreciated.  EDIT: I am actually going to have my first gig next month at a private open air hosted by a friend. Planning on playing the exact same set since I don't own too many records. Reading the crowd and reacting on that will be a task for another time.

Beatmatch,36kope,dj_soo,1 point,Wed May 20 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"First I gather all new finds in a folder called ""new music""  on my laptop.  From here I put the tracks through keyfinder to tag the keys.  I then open up serato where I have an empty crate to sort out all songs by bpm.  Once I have all the bpms of these new tracks I sort them into their respective file in my external eg) 140 bpm trap etc.  Once they are in the right folders in my external I move them into the crates in serato which matches the folders in my external.    I wish I could just move them into my external and serato automatically adds them to their proper crate."
Beatmatch,36kope,dj_soo,1 point,Thu May 21 01:26:42 2015 UTC,I notice you never actually analyze the tracks in Serato.  Try smart crates and keywords in the tags - make sure to turn on live updating and create a series of crates based on whatever criteria and tags you decide to use.

Beatmatch,36kope,Raidz1,1 point,Sun May 24 22:47:08 2015 UTC,"Here's my work flow. I have a smart playlist in iTunes for every genre of music I like. They search my iTunes library for the correct genre tag and sorts my music accordingly. I simply drag my new music into iTunes, go through each song tagging the genres of the songs. And that's it.    I use Serato crates for creating shortlists or playlist for specific clubs or parties. I'll save these playlists with the date and city of the party so next time I'm back there I can make sure I play a completely fresh set.   The great thing about iTunes is the date added tab in Serato. My funk folder for example is massive on iTunes, but I kinda remember roughly when I added something. All my new shit is at the top. Even if I don't genre tag something, I have another smart playlist to keep songs that were added in the last month.   ITunes, it's a bit of a cunt but it works.   Big tip: keep Serato closed when you're working in iTunes. Make sure your artist tags are correct before ever opening Serato. ITunes puts tracks in subfolders according to artist tag so if you retag an artist and open Serato, Serato won't know where that song has gone (if you had it added to a crate).   Hope that helps."

Kinda like what happens to the music library in the pirated version: tracks you added will suddenly disappear for no reason.  Use an official copy and watch how these problems magically disappear.

Beatmatch,36j7y4,jimmer109,3,Wed May 20 03:01:50 2015 UTC,"Kinda, except DJay has a pitch control and slip cueing so you can still beatmatch. It's less like playing music off your phone and more like having an extra deck to work with. If you don't have WiFi available at your gig this is by far the easiest way to take a request you don't have.  Even better, should your laptop or CDJs catastrophically fail on you, instead of putting on a premade mix you can still carry on with a live show using nothing but a mixer and this app (you would have to enable Split Cue in the settings and plug one 1 RCA into each mixer channel but it works). It's a full-fledged DJing app, with effects and all, and unlike Traktor, it's available on Android!"

Beatmatch,36ilvy,Methionine,2,Tue May 19 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"What genre is this? It's all about managing the energy levels between the two tracks.  Off of the top of my head you can put in a third track's buildup on the end of the drop to go into a single drop (so super-high energy into high energy), to hopefully keep the energy going.  A long breakdown after the drop might either kill the entire mix or keep everything together. Experiment with that."

If it appears to be the contacts, use isopropyl alcohol or contact cleaner to clean them. Try to avoid rubbing alcohol (mineral content) or other cleaners (who knows whats in there). If the contact on the cartridge is tarnished or corroded, you can use a fingernail polisher (VERY light abrasive) and gently rub it away, then clean with the alcohol. The higher % alcohol is better. You can use 70% Isopropyl but that just means there is more water content and will take longer to dry. Do not connect the cartridge until completely dry.  Good luck."
Beatmatch,36gzbx,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Tue May 19 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that only one cartridge is causing the issue, is that correct? If that's the case it's likely not the cartridge, but the stylus.   Usually when a stylus is starting to die you'll slowly begin to hear it cut in and out on one channel - it seems like you may either have a heavily used or defective stylus."

Beatmatch,36gzbx,Mr_RD,1 point,Tue May 19 14:26:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry - I'm confused. You have 1 Shure cartridge in addition to the two Ortofon DJ S cartridges that you just purchased, right?   Are you able to confirm that one DJ S and the Shure cartridge are working without any problems on both turntables?   Can you test the ""defective"" cartridge on both turntables and see what the results are? If the same problem persists on both turntables then it's likely a stylus issue at which point you can try switching the stylii to see if you get the same results.   Most of the time it's not the turntables nor the cartridges."

Beatmatch,36gzbx,PoopyButt_Childish,1 point,Tue May 19 12:49:56 2015 UTC,"1 - Allready tried.  2 - Absolutely not. The trick is from the ortofon FAQ, yours causes corrosion. Here it is FYI :   ""Place the cartridge into the tonearm and apply firm, steady pressure.  2. Turn the locking nut in the opposite direction, as if you were loosening the cartridge to remove it.  3. Continue to turn the locking nut until you feel the cartridge being forced out of the tonearm.  After the cartridge is nearly forced out of the tonearm, continuing to turn the locking nut will result in the cartridge forcefully popping back into the tonearm with a clicking sound.  4. At this moment, tighten the locking nut in the appropriate direction, and the cartridge should be seated optimally.""   3 - Will try even though i doubt my new mk2 has any dust... thanks !"

If you are interested in trying Serato they have a free version on their website, while it is really stripped down they main components are still the same. You can also get a 14 day free trial of the full version. Because it's meant for Traktor, you'll probably have to map it yourself or via some sort of download. I mainly use Numark products with Serato so I never had to map out my controller and I'm not sure of the proper logistics.

I charge depending on equipment i need to provide,  travel distance/gas money and length of lessons.    Usually i charge $25 for half hour and $40 for a full hour lessons.  Weekly is what i tend to do but sometimes monthly only works with the students needing to travel and then we'll do a 2 (or longer) hour lesson that i keep to the same $40 an hour rate.    Just ask yourself how good of a teacher are you (honestly some of the best musicians in the world are shitty teachers,  it happens),  how much prep do you need to do for each lesson and also find out what goals the student wants to achieve (ex.  Scratching technique, mixing,  selecting tracks).    Then come up with a reasonable price that is profitable for you,  and not gauging the student financially."

Beatmatch,36fgc4,DropDP,1 point,Tue May 19 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"This is a good point. Your teaching skill is just as important as how well you can DJ. If you can teach well and can DJ well, you can demand a higher price. Like 40 dollars an hour, but if you are new to teaching, start at 20-25 dollars for half and hour.  As a guitar teacher I've come to realise how important prep work is. Have a roadmap for where you want to take your student. Be prepared to go at their pace. Before each lesson know exactly what you want to teach, but be prepared to change the lesson if you need to develop another skill first.  Also your lessons might not even focus on just DJing. You might do something broader that develops their love and appreciation for music. And remember to get some basic music theory in there too. They will thank you later.  If you need more general teaching advice let me know."

The only way to learn how to scratch properly is on turntables or a motorized controller. It's possible on CDJs as well, but despite having enough resolution, CDJs can never have the same tactile feel as a spinning platter, making them much more difficult to learn on.  If I were you I'd ask a fellow DJ friend with a DVS, Vinyl, or CDJ setup if you can practice your scratching on his gear until you can afford to upgrade."

Beatmatch,36ebz7,junglizer,3,Mon May 18 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, it's a great fader, but what makes it so special is the fact it's contactless.

The Innofader is contactless, so it won't break from heavy use."
Beatmatch,36ebz7,Dantejb,2,Mon May 18 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"It's a great Crossfader for scratching.  Feels smooth, can adjust the cutin point, and just one of nicest scratch faders out there."

Beatmatch,36ebz7,endmass,2,Tue May 19 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"There's a few things that scratch DJs and turntablists look for in a fader: -   Sharp curve. The curve of a crossfader dictates how quickly the sound goes from minimum to maximum volume, so with a sharp curve, you only have to move the crossfader a very small distance for that to happen. Minimal lag. Lag is the dead space at the end of the crossfader. If the lag is small, then much like with curve, it minimises the distance the fader has to travel before the volume hits max. Low tension. How stiff the fader is to move side to side (or up and down). For scratching, you want the fader to be nice and loose. Strong/wide fader stem. The stem (the bit under the plastic cap) needs to be able to hold up to abuse, because they can snap. Non-contact operation. This is debatable as some DJs prefer analogue faders like the Pro X Fade. An analogue fader works via little brushes moving back and forth over carbon tracks. If dust and other gunk gets in the fader, that can cause it to crackle and bleed, plus the brushes/carbon tracks can eventually wear out. Non-contact faders use different methods of operation, so they need less cleaning, shouldn't crackle/bleed, and will often last longer.   The Innofader offers all of the above, so it allows DJs to adjust the various things I mentioned to their liking, plus the fader lasts a long time and needs virtually no cleaning. Also, another advantage is that if you have a mixer or controller that has a crap crossfader, or is lacking controls to adjust the curve, there may well be a compatible Innofader that you can drop in there, which will be a huge improvement."

So bottom line is there's ALOT of material for free, enough for you to get on your way, but sometimes, you got to sift through all of it. Phil's videos are organized and can help you maintain focus.  I also had money to spare, so all in all, I feel its about convenience, focus and structure.  What I'd recommend is sign up for their mailing list, they run discounts on the lessons, I got mine past month when it was 30-50% off, don't remember.  Another aspect I like is Phil tends to get involved personnaly, nowadays you hardly see business owners meddling, leaving it to the minions, its a good touch.  Hope this helps."

Beatmatch,36dr09,jamesjsully,2,Mon May 18 16:07:25 2015 UTC,Why not try to either throw or find some small house parties? Especially since you're graduating why not try to find a party and ask to DJ?
Beatmatch,36dr09,AlexEscapedFate,2,Mon May 18 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"You should definitely look into house parties and depending on what you plan to do after high school, look into the college DJ scene. My college has 2-3 DJ competitions throughout the year, many club venues, university events, and fraternity events. Most colleges will have something similar. Just make sure you got something to set you apart from the pack and you won't be considered one of the ""Dime a dozen"" DJs."
Beatmatch,36dr09,Dantejb,1 point,Mon May 18 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yep. Play where ever you can, and avoid playing places you should get paid for free.  Some ideas:   Bring your stuff over to a friend's house party and set up! It's low-pressure because you'll be among friends (and hopefully know what they vibe to), but gets you familiar with reading a crowd and handling interruptions while you play. Throw a party! If it's feasible, you can get something started even if your friends aren't having an event. You said you're graduating... what's your graduation party plan? Go to all-ages shows at venues that you like, and make friends. Figure out who the promoter is, get to know the staff by name, tell the DJ (AFTER they finish their set) about what you liked. Once you get to know them, ask their advice on getting a gig. ""Hey, I know you book the talent here, and I'm trying to get myself some bookings. How do you usually find your performers? What's the WRONG way to approach you for a gig?"" Here's the trick: actually be friendly, and have this conversation once you know each other -- don't try to make a friend and get a booking all on the same night. And when you ask their advice, actually want to hear what they have to say. They may not want to book you as a new DJ, and that's ok! Hopefully, the info they give you will help you talking to the next venue, or they might recommend someone you can talk to for an opener set somewhere. Either way, the practice of networking and the results from building your network will only benefit you moving forward."
Beatmatch,36cb3z,joebo3001,7,Mon May 18 06:10:01 2015 UTC,"Look, the most important thing isn't about the controller or mixing at all. The most important thing is actual song selection.  Your only task as a DJ is people having a good time. Usually, it means that you put on the music that fits their mood and their expectations, while at the same time surprises and educates them a little. You can get away with a lot of mixing errors if the song you just put on is good.  If you made someone's day better because of the music you played, you're a good DJ. That's all."

Beatmatch,36cb3z,Rollos,1 point,Mon May 18 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"I would never practice the same set twice. A big part of mixing is improvisation, and if you just do the same thing over and over, you won't learn that"

Basically you can map the buttons to do just about anything that you to in whatever you want in the program (provided it supports MIDI mapping). This can be things as simple as single actions like playing a sound file or as complicated as a long effects chain. If they're velocity sensitive then they can have multiple things happen based on how long / hard / how they're pressed.  There are different styles of MIDI fighters as well, so typically the buttons are used for finger drumming and sample launching while the twister is often used for effects, EQ, and step sequencers."

Beatmatch,36ayir,autowikibot,2,Mon May 18 00:46:09 2015 UTC,"MIDI:       MIDI (/ˈmɪdi/; short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a protocol, digital interface and connectors and allows a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and communicate with one another.  A single MIDI link can carry up to sixteen channels of information, each of which can be routed to a separate device.  MIDI carries event messages that specify notation, pitch and velocity, control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato, audio panning, cues, and clock signals that set and synchronize tempo between multiple devices. These messages are sent to other devices where they control sound generation and other features. This data can also be recorded into a hardware or software device called a sequencer, which can be used to edit the data and to play it back at a later time.  :4  MIDI technology was standardized in 1983 by a panel of music industry representatives, and is maintained by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA). All official MIDI standards are jointly developed and published by the MMA in Los Angeles, California, US, and for Japan, the MIDI Committee of the Association of Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) in Tokyo.

Beatmatch,368vav,Neuermann,7,Sun May 17 08:17:33 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty subjective thing, you are just going to see what you like - if modern rap doesn't do it for you then don't force it. If your friends play some music you like, get the name of the track and look it up later. Maybe find the album it was from, or just other tracks by the artist. YouTube playlists are pretty good for finding similar music.  Also, you don't necessarily have to stick to new music. Young people can still appreciate old tunes, it may well be your choice of genre rather than era. Check out some older funky stuff, I recommend 'barely breaking even' by the universal robot band or 'ecstacy by endgames.  In terms of hip hop, I personally don't like a lot of the radio type stuff but Deltron 3030 is a great album, De la soul and the roots are ace. Kendrick lamar released an album a couple of years ago which is brilliant, 'good kid mad city'.  Modern dance music I like: atmospheric techno like Dark Sky 'shutter speed' or Claro intelecto 'piece of mind', pretty much anything by joy o and boddika is good for great techno clubbing tracks. Todd terje 'inspector norse' is a really uplifting scandi-disco track, or listen to some night slugs for more grimy type stuff.   You might hate everything I've suggested and that's fine, each to his own. If you want to discover whole new genres you will just have to keep listening to stuff until something clicks. Good luck"

Beatmatch,368vav,dj_soo,10,Sun May 17 08:55:27 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with Mumford & Sons and Jack Johnson, but they definitely aren't the party artists. If anything, start with the Billboard Top 100. Pretty mainstream pop/rap/etc. In terms of listening to electronic music, it had to grow on me before I learned to really like it. I recommend looking up songs by Kaskade, Tiesto, David Guetta, Avicii, these guys usually release a lot of mainstream material that you'll hear most often on the radio. Then you can branch to different genres like trap, house, and more.  Spotify (or any other streaming service) is a great method for discovering new music, because you can literally start with one artist and go down the rabbit hole, adding music and artists to your library while discovering new sounds and tastes. With spotify, when you click on an artist, it will show you that musician's top 5 tracks being played by people, which usually represents how popular it will be. Songs in the tens of millions will be fairly popular and easily recognizable. This would be my recommendation in finding new music :)"
Beatmatch,368vav,motecizuma,2,Sun May 17 08:55:32 2015 UTC,"Great advice. I work for a Billboard brand organization and I'm a big fan of their charts for learning about genres and regional tastes.   To build on the spotify thing, they've got great playlists that can be awesome introductions to new types of music. I keep up on all sorts of genres that I don't usually listen to that way.

You won't like all of it, just like other people won't like all the music you play, whatever yo.

I grew up listening to top 40, so whenever I'm DJing I can pick off the top of my head something in past 12 years that the crowd will like.

Also play around with the 'sound hardware' settings. Took me a while to configure it correctly but once I got it right it worked pretty well for me.

Beatmatch,3627sc,DJ_Theo,3,Fri May 15 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"This is at my weekly residency, and the DJ doesn't set up in the booth there -- I'm either on one side of the stage if there's other performances, or right in the middle with a dance platform on the sides of the stage if not. So I'll just put on a longer track (usually something I like that may not get played later, and jam the fuck out for a couple minutes. If the levels are off, I'll duck back on stage to mix in a new track and finish checking.  It's fun! My main residency is an LGBT night, so there's definitely a community feel with the crowd. Sometimes, one of my party regulars will come dance with me for a minute, and then they usually just stay and keep dancing when I go back up on stage. After a year, I know a lot of the regulars by face if not name. :)  Don't get it twisted, I'm shaking it behind the decks all night -- but it's easier to judge how things sound from where my audience will hear them. Then I'll set my ""booth"" (on-stage monitors) from that, and back the master gain off a bit so I've got headroom for later on when things get hype."

Beatmatch,3627sc,DJ_Theo,8,Fri May 15 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're just not noticing or sample size is too small? I do a walk through of the entire place 3-4 times per night; Once as my first track is playing to make sure initial volume and sound is good, again as more people start to show up and the transition out of the early part of the night is going on, again as the room and the music reach their peak, and a fourth time if the room peters off and I rein it back in.  I am also paying attention to the music any time I run to the bar for a drink or head to the bathroom. If I am headed to the bathroom and the music feels too loud or too quiet I'll turn around and fix it before I pee.  I care a lot about the atmosphere of my residency... even when I am not DJing and have someone filling in for me if I'm still in town I'll generally stop by for a drink so I know what it's like to be a customer there... I know what levels feel comfortable and what levels don't so I am constantly paying attention.  Walk throughs also give you a chance to gauge the energy of the room, notice things like people looking bored or having to yell at bartenders, and so on."

Beatmatch,360bs6,pheenomusic,3,Fri May 15 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"What type of CDJ's/Mixer will you be using on the night?  If you are using Pioneer CDJ's (which I'm assuming you will be due to the Rekordbox question) then you have a few options available to you.  Rekordbox works more as an organisational program more than a DJ program. It imports your music, scans them and adds the beatgrid that Pioneer uses in it's CDJ's. The benefit of this is that you can create smart crates and search fields to make your gig easier when searching for tracks, as well as adding pre-set hot cues and loops. The important thing I always find to do is to double check rekordbox's grids, as they are off sometimes. Play the track and turn on the metronome feature on the screen so you can hear if it lines up with the beat. It's pretty easy to edit the grid in RB as well, so don't be afraid of toying around with it.  Quantization helps looping a fair bit, but the auto loops work really well without it on. Personally I don't use Quantize as I find it restricts me a bit, but try it with and without, see what works for you. Check out some Youtube videos on how to set the loops, as they change depending on the model of CDJ.  If I was to guess why the BPM was changing, I would say that maybe the file hadn't been fully analyzed when you pressed play. If a file hasn't been analyzed in Rekordbox, it will be scanned once it's loaded by the CDJ, although this takes a minute or so to do properly. If you load a track and press play, it will scan it while playing, and will display an estimate of what the BPM is. By the time it gets to the end, the number might be different. Obviously scanning in RB can eliminate this problem, but you are always better off beatmatching by ear anyway, especially when on CDJ's.  If it's a Pioneer mixer, you need to turn on the master cue in a couple of steps. First you need to press the master cue button, which is below the master balance knob. You then need to set the level in relation to the channel cues with the mixing knob next to the headphone knob. Now, the level of the master cue's volume will be determined by how loud you have the master volume set, so if  you are only at a quarter on the master volume knob, you might need to turn the mixing knob to the right and crank the headphones a bit so you can hear it properly. You will need to play around with it a bit to get used to how it works.  You can use your laptop to connect to CDJ's if they are compatible models. CDJ 900's and 2000's (and the nexus models) can be connected to your laptop with ethernet cable and a network hub. This will allow you to import tracks directly from the laptop, and browse your entire collection. However, Rekordbox does not have waveform display on the screen like Serato or Traktor, so don;t expect it to work that way. It's more for easier music browsing. You can set up a laptop with CDJ's using Serato or Traktor, but that is a whole other discussion. But you will either need a Serato box or a Traktor licence and the appropriate CDJ's.  As for tips, I would suggest the best option for you at this point is to try and practice with your own equipment using them in the same way as a CDJ. If you use a controller usually, set up your laptop so it is off to the side or the rear of where you are playing. The point being that it is out of your line of sight. That way, you need to look away from the screen when you are mixing, and are forced to use your ears, and only look at the screen to pick songs. Using the screen to set BPM wouldn't be too much of a cheat, as you can do the same thing on the CDJ's, but the point is to try and distance yourself as much as possible.  Out of curiosity, what is the gig?"
Beatmatch,360bs6,britty1983,2,Fri May 15 02:27:11 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! Your comment was very helpful. And I'll be opening for Deorro and the Panda Funk Tour at Gold Room in Atlanta.

Beatmatch,360bs6,KrazyTrain18,2,Fri May 15 04:03:29 2015 UTC,Thank you! It had a learning curve compared to the SR but once I got over not looking at the screen it became much easier.

Beatmatch,360bs6,KrazyTrain18,3,Fri May 15 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"Your tracks were changing bpm because it was calculating the bpm of the track on the fly. As more of the track was getting analysed it had more info to calculate the bpm. The more info it has via analysing the more accurate bpm reading it can give you. Hence it was changing...  Also rekord box enables you to scan your tracks at home, place them in playlists and order them etc... Because you are scanning them at home all the information such as wave form and bpm will load up instantly on the cdj because when you export your analysed tracks to usb in rekordbox is copies all this magical data along with the track."
Beatmatch,360bs6,christianjackson,2,Fri May 15 07:54:37 2015 UTC,"Download rekordbox from the Pioneer site and import all the tracks you want to use.  Rekordbox will automatically analyze everything you import.  In rekodbox you can set cue points, hot cues, loops basically everything you can do on CDJs so that when you go to the show it'll all be there.  Once your done export the playlist from rekodbox onto either a USB drive or SD card and your good to go.  Make sure you have a backup drive though.  You can also put your CDJ settings on your USB so that when you load it your settings are loaded instantly.   Quantizing your loops in rekodbox is good and bad depending on how precise of a section your looping.  Best to set loops with quantize off in rekodbox but live in your set it's easiest to do it with it on. BPM changes happen when rekodbox analyzes the track wrong or when certain tracks change BPM midway through. I never use sync unless one of the tracks is constantly changing BPMs and is tough to keep matched up.  Otherwise NEVER use sync. There's a knob on the DJM that sets the level of cue/master % in your headphones Play around with different tracks together in rekodbox, as long as you understand phasing & phrasing and can beatmatch you will be fine. If during your set you can't get something matched up quickly then try the sync function as a last resort but you should be able to beatmatch if you got booked for a gig. Somebody else already covered this in depth."

Beatmatch,35un4e,MrMiniMacho,3,Wed May 13 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"So what?  It's a party, people are drinking.  It's not how bad you mess up, it's how well you can recover.  Being nervous is good.  Embrace it.  Use it to make you a better DJ.  If you can, do both.  For me, 2 hours of music is 50 songs.  I would prepare a playlist of double that.  Bring the rest just in case there is a gem that you forgot to add that you know would be perfect.  Keep it to a minimum before you play.  Be a social drinker, not a binge drinker.  Bring all your tricks, but don't feel pressure to use all of them.  When you start playing, you'll use the ones you are most comfortable with.  Practice mixing exactly how you will at the gig.  Forget everything and have fun!   Good luck.  I like the concept, and it should be pretty cool."

Beatmatch,35un4e,Sgt_Floss,6,Wed May 13 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"1) You'll be prepared, so you won't.  2) Practice, have a game plan, and have a drink before your set.  3) Have a list of songs you really want to play, bring all of your music just in case.  4) Depends on how you drink. My rule is one drink before the set and one drink during.  5) It's usually a long blend for house music, but since it's a battle, try to be creative.  6) Like mixing in headphones. My guess is that you won't have a monitor, so you should practice mixing with just headphones.  I can also recommend to bring a backup of everything (cables, music, etc). Talk to the soundtech if you can, ask about his setup, about the dynamic that he is going to have the day of. You can try to talk to the other DJ, see how he is preparing, what he is preparing (sure it's a battle, but it is also a show) just to make sure you don't play stuff that is too similar.  It's a pretty neat first gig honestly!  edit: words"
Beatmatch,35un4e,britty1983,1 point,Wed May 13 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I will practice the next days only with my headphones.   Yes that's right, I wont have a monitor, because of the problem with the noise.  Edit: Spelling"
Beatmatch,35un4e,Totemusprime,3,Wed May 13 21:30:27 2015 UTC,"So I've just played in 3 Silent Disco's in the last 6 months at a few of the largest festivals here in Australia. I've learnt a few things in regards to playing these types of gigs, so I'll give you a few pointers:   Practice using the headphones and cue jumping - So you are going to be playing to headphones while cue-ing up in your own headphones. This is a bit weird at first, as you have to use the channel cues to monitor both yourself and what the crowd are hearing. If you are going to be using a DJM 2000 or similar, practice by disconnecting all speakers and monitors to the DJM, turn up the Master level to about 3/4 (which is probably going to be the level you are playing at on those systems) and turn on the master headphone cue. You will need to practice jumping around with the cues, turning on the channel cue to line up and start mixing in the track, then turning it off so you can just hear what the crowd will hear, and start bringing in the faders. It's not that hard, but it's something you need to get used to doing. Don't stress too much about the mix - The fact that you are mixing in headphones instantly means that you can't usually get the exact levels in regards to bass, mid and treble as good as you would usually be able to do it. Fortunately for you though, everyone else will be on headphones, and in my experience those radio headphones are usually worn out and don' sound amazing anyway. They don;t usually spend amazing amounts on headphones that are going to be thrashed. So if you bring in the bass too quick or similar, don't stress. Play for the crowd - The fact is that these types of events can be a bit weird. The crowd usually are quite fickle because of the spectacle. It's all silent so it's a bit of a giggle, and there are two to  three channels to choose from. Not only that, but some of the newer setups I've seen have lights on the side of the headphones, that change color to indicate what channel they are listening to. So if a whole bunch of people are singing a song together out loud, or they are  all on the same color dancing their asses off, other people will switch to see what they are jamming to. Because of that, what usually seems to work better is tune selection more than technical ability. Keep it really upbeat and crowd friendly. Try and play as many songs as possible that they will know to try and keep them on side, but at the same time don't get disheartened if they do end up switching in bulk. Even if they are vibing on what you are doing, someone will get interested on what's playing on the other channels. Just keep doing your thing. Have fun! - Like I said, It's a bit of a spectacle being in a silent disco. People aren't used to it, and usually get kind of silly being in this new environment. So if they are up for being silly, they will usually react to others enjoying the silliness. That can start with you. Dance around, get into the rhythm, enjoy what you are playing. If they see you enjoying it, they will want to know what you are listening to and change over. It's a really cool feeling to get every one on your channel at once.   Apart from that, I'd listen to the advice that has been given in the other comments. Your first gig is always stressful, but the trick is just to enjoy it as much as you possibly can. Good luck!"
Beatmatch,35uw4m,stkstsk,5,Wed May 13 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"Most controllers are pretty portable, although this one immediately came to mind. Not a brand recognized for quality, but it's just a MIDI controller so it is probably fine. Ideally you'd want something with a built in audio interface so you can cue and things. You might also check out the (free) software Mixxx."
Beatmatch,35uw4m,junglizer,2,Wed May 13 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I think that might be a bit too extreme though. I've never really trusted Behringer either, heh. How big are standard 2deck controllers if you compare to say, a laptop? Mixxx seems cool, would you say that it is better software than VDJ?"
Beatmatch,35uw4m,Tom_Anks,4,Wed May 13 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"Mixxx is pretty decent software - it's also completely free so that's a bonus.  I have a Behringer CMD Studio Pro controller and it's actually really decent for the price, it's essentially a larger version of the MIDI controller posted above. I get that Behringer aren't the best but if you want a cheap starting controller then most of theirs are really decent."
Beatmatch,35uw4m,junglizer,2,Wed May 13 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"If I would go for normal size, would Pioneer DDJ SB be a better choice or am I trading away functions with that controller?"
Beatmatch,35uw4m,DJScribbl3,3,Wed May 13 20:05:17 2015 UTC,I'd definitely get the SB over the others mentioned. Been around for a bit and it seems to have good build.
Beatmatch,35uw4m,junglizer,3,Wed May 13 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"I would go modular if you are traveling a lot.  When I travel I take a Z1 and X1 with me.  Another option would be the Akai AFX and AMX controllers.    It just depends on what software you want to use.  The first ones use Traktor, the others use Serato."
Beatmatch,35uw4m,Sniktsnakt,1 point,Wed May 13 19:26:28 2015 UTC,Is there any way of learning beatmatching with those combos?
Beatmatch,35uw4m,junglizer,2,Wed May 13 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"Not easily, no. The SB, as was mentioned elsewhere in this thread is about 19""x10"" and around 4lbs. Should fairly easily fit in most backpacks, even with your laptop."

Beatmatch,35uw4m,DBRZ34,1 point,Wed May 13 20:55:33 2015 UTC,Yes. There are buttons to change tempo and to tempo bend on the X1.  It's not the ideal way to learn but it's possible.
Beatmatch,35uw4m,garbear007,1 point,Wed May 13 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"Well I said ""not easily"". Especially starting out, as you're more likely to make big jumps until you can wrap your head around things."
Beatmatch,35uw4m,DBRZ34,1 point,Thu May 14 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"with the X1 MK2 there is a touch strip, with the earlier version I believe there are buttons.    I learned how to beat match on a Denon 4500 - there was a plus and minus button that allowed you to ""nudge"" the track you are playing.  It was actually a little of an adjustment when I went to a controller with just jog wheels.  A couple other options if you want to go small would be a VCI-380 or a Reloop Beatpad."
Beatmatch,35uw4m,gus_honeybun,3,Thu May 14 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"DJay2 app for iPad is as portable as it gets it also integrates spotify for almost unlimited tracks to mix, as long as you have a internet signal. If no internet then your iTunes library is all you need. It's solid and easy to use for beginners. You don't get much more portable than an iPad."
Beatmatch,35uw4m,GirtyGirty,1 point,Wed May 13 20:09:31 2015 UTC,Agreed! Djay 2 is fully functional (although not great if you're trying to learn beatmatching) and you can get external controllers if you need some physical buttons; I use a DDJ-WeGO2

Beatmatch,35w0zz,crypticdubstep,3,Wed May 13 23:53:56 2015 UTC,If you have $800 you could get a couple CDJ 1000s and a used mixer.  You could get a very decent controller.  There are many options to choose from  You could buy two Technics 1200s.  You could get a couple new Numark NDX900s.  I have some and would recommend. Denon CDJs are always an option.  Used would definitely be the way to go.    Do not buy a Gemini anything if you can help it.  With $400 you could get a used Vestax controller.  They are out of business but the products are still decent quality and built to last.  I've seen CDJ 800's for $300 a pair at pawn shops before.  You really just have to look around.
Beatmatch,35w0zz,the_bigwiggle,2,Thu May 14 04:22:29 2015 UTC,Numark NDx series cdjs are pretty cheap but good.
Beatmatch,35w0zz,crownboat,1 point,Thu May 14 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"I think Gemini makes some laptopless controllers in that price range, no idea what the quality is though."
Beatmatch,35w0zz,thereallazor,1 point,Thu May 14 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"One possibility if you like Numark, is the Numark NV.  The onboard screens allow you to shut your laptop screen if you want to."
Beatmatch,35udzh,DoYouHowShroom,5,Wed May 13 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Serato (since afaik you can midi map stuff in it), but you can use a LPD8 from Akai. They are very cheap and have 8 rubber pads (that double as 16 with a push of a button on the controller) and you can even go crazy with your mapping and program a knob to change the samples loaded into the pads"
Beatmatch,35udzh,ReadNFO,2,Wed May 13 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"Serato DJ actually can be MIDI mapped so long as you're using a device that isn't officially supported by them. It's really basic mapping, however; all you do is click a button in the software then press/move the hardware button/knob/fader that you want to control that function with."
Beatmatch,35udzh,Psythik,1 point,Thu May 14 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"I have a Launchpad that I mapped for cues, loop rolls, sampler, sampler decks, track prep, BPM parameters, ect. for Serato. It's a great investment for Serato's workflow."
Beatmatch,35wlut,88rarely,6,Thu May 14 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"Well the main difference is that a producer makes his own music and remixes other songs. In the general sense of the term, a ""DJ"" plays other people's music and mixes it in a pleasing and delightful way. These days, a lot of the a big name ""DJs"" are producers. It's difficult to be big nowadays just playing other people's music. The only time this happens is if you're a turntablist. Most working ""DJs"" are mobile (weddings/events/etc), and club based.   In terms of equipment, if a DJ or producer is playing out, it's generally some form of CDJs/controller/turntables with DVS and a mixer. Some use a form of a launch controller to activate clips and songs from Ableton, some have their own intricate systems but most people you see on main festival stages are using CDJ2000s and some high end mixer (DJM900NXS).   As for software, some don't require any. After a certain point, if you are mixing on pretty much the club/venue standard of CDJs, you are using USB Drives. If that is not the case, Serato and Traktor are pretty standard and as for the last case I explained in the previous paragraph, sometimes Ableton.   As for what gear you should get, that's absolutely up to what you want to do and how to do it. If you are unsure about what a producer or DJ is, I encourage you to do a little more research about the subject."
Beatmatch,35wlut,nowenknows,1 point,Thu May 14 03:33:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the information. I have a question now. I was looking at DJ Controllers and MIDIs. What's the difference and when / where would you use one over the other?   Also, I see some people using keyboards with their MIDIs. Like in this video. Why is that?"
Beatmatch,35wlut,3Dpaper,1 point,Thu May 14 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"It is a MIDI controller, MIDI is just the type of data.  those are midi controllers in the form a keyboard. They are using them as synthesizers essential. A software synthesizer in ableton is being controlled by the keyboard so they can play it live.   there is also some knobs on the keyboard that they are using to control some filters and other effects on the synths."
Beatmatch,35wlut,informationscientist,2,Thu May 14 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"a producer tells an engineer what sounds to make in the studio, or in the case of a recording session, how the performers should be recorded.  the engineer then does the actual work.  the producer can also be the engineer, but they are separate functions.   if the performers, who might also be the producer/engineer, go out and perform THEIR songs, that is, in electronic music terms, called a live PA, after the ""Public Address"" term for a soundsystem.  if after the show, the producer goes to an afterhours bar, plays pre-recorded music of others as well as his own music with the intent of people listening and/or dancing, and not watching a performance, he is djing.  dj = disc jockey.  which is different than a selector .. but could also be the same person.  read up on Jamaican soundsystem culture, it's fascinating."

Beatmatch,35r1ty,TheGreatGoldenBabyy,9,Tue May 12 20:21:51 2015 UTC,The aiaiai tma-1 (or the new tma-2) are pretty good. But my favourite are the hd25. You won't regret those!
Beatmatch,35r1ty,mikeb93,3,Tue May 12 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"Second this. Every part is replaceable on the Sennheiser HD25 too which makes them perfect for all the wear and tear they'll receive on the road. They might not look like much, and the low end might sound punchy rather than boomy at first, but once you start to break them in you'll love them. Without a low end that drowns up the upper frequencies, your mix is going to be much tighter as you can really blend your mids and highs much easier. 10/10 recommend."
Beatmatch,35r1ty,DJ_Theo,1 point,Tue May 12 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"Second this as well.  As much as I love my set of aiaiai tma-1, the sen hd25s are part-for-part repairable, and the sound is just so crisp."
Beatmatch,35r1ty,hockeyd13,1 point,Wed May 13 08:17:57 2015 UTC,"I got the tma-1, too. I feel like the hd25s are much more isolating than the tma-1."

Very comfortable, good sound, and they fold down and fit into a nice (included) clamshell case. I upgraded to the XL earpads and the DJ coil cable about a month ago, and it's a big improvement."
Beatmatch,35r1ty,marymelodic,3,Tue May 12 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Sennheiser HD25 are known for their sound quality and serviceability. They might be the last headphones you'll buy.   Audiotechnica M50X look neat and sound is crystal clear. A bit punchy bass may also help beatmatching in loud environments.  V-Modas are built tough and have unique design. And I have not heard big complaints about sound quality either.  But for me, I chose Beats (now downvote me): Solo 2s have decent enough sound quality and overly enhanced bass so even I can distinguish which track is which and they have tight clamp so they won't drop onto decks when I move. They definately aren't made for DJing but I don't like rotating cups and I don't take phones off my head whilst playing so for me, these were the most suitable option. Tight clamp allows me to only move one side a bit off my ear when I need to hear what is playing. At MSRP they can't compete with anything really but I got a very nice discount on them."

Beatmatch,35pqfq,marymelodic,2,Wed May 13 16:29:43 2015 UTC,"Besides the 2-channel-ness of the MPII, gigging kinda pushes you away from controllers (in my experience). Every time you go to a club you just push away beautiful CDJs that are fucking SITTING RIGHT THERE.  I went from the Mixtrack (original, non pro version) to a Numark 4trak. Got a fuckload of use out of it too. 4 decks are really nice, and the 4trak has a fuckload of knobs and buttons. That said, I'm not much for ""controllerism"". Maybe it's because I don't produce, maybe it's because I have a classical music background and playing ""other people's music"" doesn't bother me, I dunno.   I really respect the shit Ean Golden's doing. Saw him live opening for Ritchie Hawtin and it was pretty dope. I own the midifighter and I like buying gear from them. That said, it's not my thing. I just want to mix tracks and make playlists dude. You don't need anything fucking fancy for that, just two turntables, ya know?  The only thing I can think of besides the 2deck issue with the MP2 is that it's not as well built as something like the 4trak. it's also $200. so. yeah.  Honestly, if you're interested in DJing and haven't really started yet, get a Mixtrack pro 1 used from a college kid. Should cost like $70. figure out if you like just transitioning or if you really want to remix and retwix everything. Listen to the DJs you admire. How do their mixes sound? listen to their mixes, listen to the tracks they have in their tracklist individually, and find the difference between the two. It's a great way to learn more ""complicated"" techniques. I've loved a song on a mixtape but just found it ""eh"" on standalone.  I have no idea if this answers your question. It's a fine controller. It'll get the job done and unless you like being all fucking controllerist you're not going to hit any walls until it's time to do 4 deck. in which case just map your controller or buy cdjs."

I used it enough to feel like I was hitting the kind of upper limit on what is possible to do with it, and was thinking about upgrading.   However, I was recently robbed and now I'm out my controller, my headphones, and some other equipment and it has all totally killed my budget. I don't even know if I want to get back into mixing at this point, considering I don't really have the budget for it at all right now. Plus my course load for the next year is going to be fucking insane and I don't want to distract myself.   Basically, I want to know if its worth considering going back in for a  Pro II right now, waiting to see how the Pro III is when it comes out, or waiting for the Pro III to come out and then looking to see if the Pro II gets cheaper.   I was considering the DDJ-SB as well, and would be interested in anything else below $300"

Beatmatch,35nxk7,westicide,3,Tue May 12 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to start out, and are unsure what to do, what equipment to get and how to use it, then my personal opinion is to start out with a software option. As long as you have a computer that isn't super slow, then you can simulate the equipment and how it works, and figure out if it's something that you want to pursue. You can just use Traktor, but it does cost, and in my opinion it's not really great for learning as it has a lot of features that will just confuse you in the beginning. Try Virtual DJ or Mixxx. Both options are free and will allow you to figure out the basics without spending a cent. Then once you have an idea of the basics and whether it's something you still want to pursue, you can look into the market for controllers or CDJ's.  Just curious, have you bought any hardware or software yet?"

Beatmatch,35nxk7,Psythik,1 point,Tue May 12 04:13:54 2015 UTC,You can do everything in software if all you want to do is make workout mixes. Only difficult part about doing basic mixes without a controller is that it's hard to bass swap since you generally need to use both hands and a mouse can only click one thing at a time. Though if you set a hotkey in VDJ (or so happen to own a multi-touchscreen) I suppose it's still possible to do without a controller.
Beatmatch,35nxk7,Kbeck94,1 point,Fri May 15 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"If you are going with a controller, you will need a controller of your choice. Most intro controllers come with watered down version of the full software. If not you can either buy serato, traktor, or mixxx for that matter. Next get yourself some speakers, whether you want to mix on monitor speakers or a PA. Guitar center sells some decent PA systems for $300. Buy some a Rca cable and some 1/4 inch cables to hook the speakers up. Don't forget the headphones.  For mixing on CD players, you will need the initial CD players, a mixer, Rca cables for each player to the mixer, and most likely a Rca to your PA.   Vinyl is basically the same as Cd's, but just make sure your mixer has a phono preamp.   Ps, forget the SYNC button even exists"
Beatmatch,35nxk7,BuxtonTheRed,1 point,Tue May 12 04:18:20 2015 UTC,"You need at least two sources of music, with the ability to vary their playback speeds away from 100%, and a way to mix those sources together (fading them individually up and down, normally also with a cross-fader, and some EQs so you can reduce or increase the amount of low/medium/high frequencies on each channel). The mixer will also need to allow you to preview-listen a channel in your headphones before ""the audience"" can hear it.  Those roles can be played by vinyl turntables and a fully analogue mixer, or CDJs and a mixer, or it can all be done in software inside your laptop in the case of Serato/Traktor situations (in which case, the controller is providing a good hands-on interface to the features of the software, and sometimes audio IO hardware like the sockets to plug in the headphones and speakers).  I strongly recommend getting this book and reading it before you purchase anything. Even though the book primarily talks about vinyl, and its chapter about digital DJing is now fairly outdated at the details level, the fundamental concepts of ""what is DJing and how do you mix tracks together"" are still the same. Serato and Traktor both use a vinyl / CDJ metaphor for how you interact with the music, and you will get more out of reviews, discussions and online tutorial videos if you've picked up the core concepts.  If you go down the laptop+controller route, you should select your software choice and controller together. While it's often possible to use a controller designed for Serato with Traktor instead, the overall polish and level of integration and convenience may not be as high as if you were using it with Serato, or using a Traktor-centric controller with Traktor.  How musical and/or rhythm-driven are you? If you play DDR, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, even DJ Hero, with any degree of skill, that will help a lot. A strong ""internal metronome"" and an ear for how other people's mixes fit together are both very useful."
Beatmatch,35m9o3,thefapper1,2,Mon May 11 17:45:21 2015 UTC,You should be talking to venue or the people handling the sound.  Either go direct into their PA system via xlr or connect via rca to a mixer if they have one.

Seems as though the interface is going to be unavailable for me though (theres going to be live bands playing out as well at the event so certain resources are going to them...how audio is going to be set up is kind of sketchy at this point it seems).  Can I connect my controller into an interface?  Should I just connect my controller into the speakers directly to avoid hassle?"

Beatmatch,35lw56,Alpine425,4,Mon May 11 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"Straight upgrade, X1 is very solid with everything, ever.  Z1 is very nice to have if you wont have a cdj/mixer setup available for you so you can just whip those 2 controllers and your laptop out to get the party started.  I had the mixtrack pro and compared to my Z2 and X1 it's a plastic toy. (But a good beginner value plastic toy ofcourse :). )"
Beatmatch,35lw56,Aenarion69,2,Mon May 11 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"I used to use exactly that set up for portable use.  Works great, definite upgrade.  The X1 is really a great piece of hardware, and if you're using it with CDJs, all the better.  It can be used sans-CDJ as well, but you'll have to have your tracks gridded and use sync, but that works perfectly fine and you can do a full set with just an X1 and the mixer."
Beatmatch,35lw56,RIP_KING,1 point,Mon May 11 16:22:01 2015 UTC,I'm curious how do you use it with CDJ's? Advanced HID mode? (I know almost nothing about it)
Beatmatch,35lw56,RIP_KING,2,Mon May 11 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"yes.  At that point, you're basically using the cdjs for the jogs and the pitch fader for beat matching, and you use the X1 for cuepoints, effects, browsing, track loading.    You could probably do it all from CDJs and skip the X1, but I do think the X1 is nice to keep handy, especially if you plan to continue using Traktor and not just go straight CDJ/Rekordbox."
Beatmatch,35lw56,DJScribbl3,1 point,Mon May 11 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Using the CDJ's I assume I wouldn't need the Traktor Audio 2? But I would need 1 USB input for each CDJ and 1 more for the X1. I use an external Hard Drive for my music as well. Would I have an issue using an unpowered USB hub for 2 CDJ's and the X1?
Beatmatch,35lw56,dj_soo,2,Mon May 11 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"I would get it.  More portable, imo a better product.  There are a few differences between the MK1 and MK2, most notably the touch strip, but you should be good with either."
Beatmatch,35lw56,dj_soo,2,Mon May 11 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't need the Audio 2 as the Z1 has it's own soundcard.  It's a slight upgrade mainly because I think NI gear is better than low-end numark gear, and it's an upgrade in portability, but it's not a head and shoulders improvement.  If you want a true upgrade, you'll probably want to get a better mixer/soundcard - preferably one with balanced outputs.  You might consider an S4 instead unless portability is a must (not that the S4 is all that large).  That said, the X1 can stay with you through your upgrade path.  I would suggest a Traktor Scratch compatible soundcard over an Audio2 like an Audio8 if you need a standalone soundcard just so you can transition to timcode using house gear like CDJs rather than using a low output bus-powered controller like a Z1"
Beatmatch,35lw56,dj_soo,1 point,Tue May 12 10:14:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your info. Portability and compatibility in other clubs is pretty high on my list at the moment as I know it looks pretty unprofessional to set a Mixtrack pro on top of the CDJs.   As I said I work in a hostel, they have no DJ mixer aside from a rack mount, karaoke style amp/ mixer. The club I work at has CDJ's in a coffin, they don't support nexus or USB connection to Traktor without something like a Traktor Scratch interface. I just use my Mixtrack on top of the coffin. Although they support serato which I could/ should learn, but I chose Traktor.  The seller I was planning to buy the X1/ Z1/ Audio 2 has already sold them. I've found a shop with a used X1 Mk1 for around $140 this is the only one available in this country that I have been able to find in over a year or searching. My online research tells me this is a reasonable price as the Mk1 is not too commonly sold used or new online: ebay or amazon, and import taxes here are ridiculous.   So I guess the X1 is useless to me right now but I worry I wont be able find it again, so I plan to buy.  My question for you (Valued Contributor) is what soundcard should I buy? The Mixtrack Pro output has become distorted and unreliable so I currently use a little C-Media USB 'soundcard' for my headphone monitor and the headphone output from my macbook air for master. I assume this would be a noticeable difference in quality and or fidelity in a decent soundsystem if used as track 1 and 2 in the mixer. Are there any common, reasonably priced USB sound cards up to the task?  Sorry for the Verrrry long question. Thanks so much if you bother reading."
Beatmatch,35lw56,DJ_Theo,2,Fri May 15 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"If you're a Traktor user, I'd think an audio6/8/10 card would be a no brainer.  Hell, you could probably keep using your mix track pro as a pure midi controller for smaller gigs and allow the card to process the audio until you can afford something nicer.  And you can use it with timecode for gigs with gear installed.  Serato is pretty straightforward tho and if they have a card, it won't cost you anything to download program - just go in early and fuck around with the program.  You may have to simplify your mixing a bit as you learn the program and you're used to some of the bells and whistles of traktor, but most club goers only care about the music and the flow of a dj set - not how many effects or remix deck loops you use."
Beatmatch,35lw56,DJ_Theo,1 point,Fri May 15 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"I looks like the Audio 1, 4, and 8 are for sale here but a bit out of my price range and I'm unsure about weight and portability. I came here as a semi-lightweight backpacker and hope to leave the same (fairly soon). Which means I will be selling the Mixtrack.  I have used serato a couple times with the CDJs. How much effort is it to bring in tracks and playlists that are analyzed and set with cue points in Traktor? The analysis locks are set. Does that transfer over easily or do I need to do it all over again with Rekordbox?  I play a 5-6 hour set every Saturday and requests are common. I have a ridiculous amount of music, but it is nice to be able to search for that obscure track that someone and their group of friends want to hear (sometimes)."

Going to outside from jaguar was slightly off, they clashed a bit but it wasn't too bad. Same with the following transition into Chimes, it might have been the keys or the actual instruments that didn't go too well with each other. There were a few other transitions which I felt had the same issue, with the mids clashing a little bit. Everything was in phrase though, good job. My favourite transition would have to be going into promiseland from dirty vibe, that was real nice. Keep working on it. I look forward to your next one."

Beatmatch,35l1f9,Killywilly93,3,Mon May 11 11:01:46 2015 UTC,Your setup makes sense to me.  The DAC is a good idea and will almost certainly give you better results than your laptop's built-in audio card.
Beatmatch,35l1f9,pigferret,2,Mon May 11 11:12:10 2015 UTC,The Udac most likely only has one (stereo) output meaning you will have to run everything in mono (if you plan on using a computer to dj with two decks); something like the audio 2 is far better for digital multi-channel mixing and it's about the same price.  Also if you want to use the udac for recording it won't work as it has no inputs.
Beatmatch,35l1f9,zoink43,1 point,Mon May 11 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah recording is definitely something I want to do in the long run, will that Audio 2 permit me to?or something else?"
Beatmatch,35l1f9,zoink43,2,Mon May 11 15:22:13 2015 UTC,You will need something with a (stereo) line input. The U-CONTROL UCA222 will do the job well enough.
Beatmatch,35lmjs,Sho_nuff_,2,Mon May 11 14:46:33 2015 UTC,"Take a look at mixify.com, if you haven't already."
Beatmatch,35k7oc,thefapper1,5,Mon May 11 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"Using the pitch only is smoother and recommended when you're spinning really melodic stuff (nudging the platter can be more 'distracting', especially when you push too far). I prefer using the pitch fader and platter. When I'm almost at the correct bpm but the beats don't lock yet I think it's easier to adjust with the platter instead of correcting it with the pitch (aka changing the almost correct position of your pitch)."
Beatmatch,35k7oc,voeljediebass,3,Mon May 11 10:50:50 2015 UTC,"Riding the pitch and pitch bending are both perfectly valid ways of mixing. Usually when mixing you end up using both. Use the pitch fader to get the cued up song around the BPM of the playing song, and then pitch bend forward or back if the song comes out of sync with the playing song."
Beatmatch,35k7oc,Dantejb,3,Mon May 11 06:13:06 2015 UTC,"Pros and cons:    Platter Pros:   Faster Easier to adjust back and forth just be nudging Can quickly and dramatically change the tempo of a track   Platter Cons:   Can make a very obvious pitch up/down sound without keylock or if doing too quickly (best to do in headphones) Not as easy to do on a turntable unless you've had practise with doing it on one     Pitch-only Pros:   Smoother and not very noticeable when you're adjusting track tempos If you can ride the pitch you can literally DJ on any platform be it CDJs, controllers (with a pitch control), or turntables Great skill to master ""minute"" and ""small"" adjustments   Pitch-only Cons:   It's gonna take awhile for you to get it at the right tempo, but with practice this will be quicker Some pitch controls are sensitive as fuck, so it's recommended you use a small range, maybe 10% at most on CDJs, and 8% for turntables. I use around 6% on my Traktor S2 and the pitch control is tiny as fuck, it gets TOO sensitive sometimes.   Ultimately if I had to pick just ONE method to use, it'd be pitch-only. It does everything pushing the platter does, but if you have the technology in front of you, go ahead and use the platter as much as you want. Just be aware it'll make an obvious noise (especially with keylock/master tempo OFF) if you nudge it too much so do it when the track isn't loud enough etc."

Beatmatch,35k7oc,EmileDorkheim,2,Mon May 11 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"I use the platter and fader and it works for me, but I can think of a couple of advantages to only using the fader. Using the fader should sound a bit smoother than nudging the record/platter, which can produce audible changes in pitch if you're heavy-handed, and being able to do it with the fader alone means you can beatmatch on any turntable/controller, no matter how crappy the platter/jogwheel is, which might come in useful. Having said that, some controllers have crappy pitch faders too."

Beatmatch,35k7oc,Chiafriend12,1 point,Wed May 13 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Both platter and pitch fader imo. That's what easiest and quickest for me, but you should try out both methods for a while so you can see which works for you better. They're both valid but it's personal preference what's easier/more efficient for the individual person."
Beatmatch,35k7oc,Kokkothespacemonkey,1 point,Mon May 11 10:31:05 2015 UTC,"well once the music is playing out loud, touching the platter is not recomended as you can hear it.  if the song you re playing only has drums and atonal stuff then maybe touch the platter otherwise there is no reason not to use the pitch."
Beatmatch,35k7oc,djdementia,1 point,Mon May 11 11:40:25 2015 UTC,"It's all personal preference TBH.  That being said if you are starting up and not sure which way to go, I think simply using the pitch fader is better.  Part of the reason is platters vary widely on sensitivity and 'feel'.  You really gotta get a good feel for the gear - that also means that 'feel' doesn't translate well when you are using sombody else's gear.  Pitch faders 'feel' is far less important, so you'll be able to use someone else's gear easier."

Beatmatch,35khda,Starting_over_IRL,1 point,Mon May 11 05:53:10 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're going for I guess.  You can DJ with a band (Kid Koala, DJ Cam, and Premier have done it, I'm sure there's a lot more too), or you can get any sort of beat machine and play along with the band (just saw a video of Glass Animals with some sort of MIDI pads playing Gooey, saw DJ Shadow live and he drums on some sort of MIDI kit).  If you want to DJ, it's pretty straightforward what you need.  For more of a MIDI approach check out different pads and see what suits your wants and needs.  I have a Maschine and it takes like 1 minute to load up and all you need is a computer.  I've never actually played with a band like that, but I'd imagine most of your time would be spent trying to figure out what samples you want to trigger that would go with the band and then assigning it to all the pads and groups."

If you don't know where to start at all, listen to tracks in the Beatport top 100 for specific genres until you find tracks you like and use those (Dubstep top 100, Electro-house top 100). After you start to know some artists whose work you especially like, start looking through their discography and listening to as much as you can until you find even more artists you like. Listening on YouTube and going through the related videos is a great method.  Repeat this forever until you have your own music collection. You'll never stop looking.  Good luck and have fun"

Beatmatch,35fudt,houseandtechno,2,Sat May 9 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"The A8 has been replaced by the newer A10 - but both are up to the 3 deck job.  Are you using timecode or internal decks from traktor mixed externally? This may save you connections if you are using internal playback rather than timecode.  In terms of cabling, you would still be connecting your monitors to your mixer but your recording will come from another mixer output (like a REC or BOOTH output) to an input of the A8/A10."
Beatmatch,35fudt,tmccoy00,1 point,Sat May 9 23:47:48 2015 UTC,I am mixing externally with a Xone 92 mixer.  Xone 92 doesn't have a soundcard so monitors need to be powered from the A8 or A10.
Beatmatch,35fudt,tmccoy00,1 point,Sun May 10 05:32:50 2015 UTC,"The monitors need to be connected to an audio source not an audio interface.   The Xone92 has multiple outputs - the MIX1 XLR or MIX2 TRS or BOOTH TRS or RECORD RCA. You just need to connect your monitor speakers to one of these outputs of the mixer - probably MIX1, MIX2 or BOOTH would be ideal. MIX1 is obviously the easiest if you already have XLR inputs on your monitors, but getting 1/4"" TRS Jack to XLR Male cables also solves this problem.  Then you connect the RECORD RCA output of the Xone 92 to a spare input on the A8/10 and configure Traktor to record externally from that input."
Beatmatch,35fudt,tmccoy00,1 point,Sun May 10 09:19:36 2015 UTC,I understand what you are saying. I have been under the notion that my mixer needs to be going through sound card for it to play thru powered monitors. Currently my set up is a Xone 92 + Scarlett 2i4 soundcard. Balanced outputs 1 and 2 from Scarlett soundcard (1/4 inch TRS) to KRK Rokit 6's (XLR). My main outs 1 and 2 on the Xone 92 are going directly into Line inputs on the front of 2i4 via XLR. I use two Xone k2 controllers to control 4 decks with aggregation. This sound card lets me switch from input to playback with the knob when I'm not DJing and want to just listen to music on my computer. I had no clue that I could just plug directly into my monitors. Is the sound quality going to be better plugging directly into monitors? And also will there be interference if the TRS cables are plugged in the Rokits if I also plug in from Xone 92 to Rokits XLR? Or will i I have to unplug the TRS cables?   And I also able to record now since I have 2 balanced line inputs directly connected from xone main outs?
Beatmatch,35fudt,Con1750,1 point,Sun May 10 09:50:08 2015 UTC,"The sound quality will be just as good with the Rokit 6's directly connected to your mixer via XLR. It may even be slightly better as there will be no audio processing that the 2i4 is doing now to send the input signal to the output signal   I think I remember your other post about your aggregated K2s and the 2i4. This is an overly complicated setup, which is why I think you are going down the A8/10 route.  If you aggregate the 2i4 with the K2's then you should be able to access the Inputs of the 2i4 and set this up for recording in Traktor. One issue you might be introducing here is upsetting the stereo balance of the original track. The 2i4 inputs are designed for Mono instruments like a microphone from a vocalist, or a guitarist. I am not sure if these are passed through evenly into each of the stereo output channels, or if they are maintained in a strict Input 1 to Left Main Output and Input 2 to Right Main Output configuration. What this means is that subtle stereo variations may get lost in your current speaker configuration (with the Rokit 6's connected to the 2i4 outputs), but the recording should work correctly.  The one issue is that you will need to keep your DJ Mixer on when you just want to listen to music and keep at least one of the K2s plugged in and set up as your default soundcard in the OS and make sure you set the mixer channel and crossfader accordingly for a simple listen-only session."
Beatmatch,35fudt,Con1750,1 point,Sun May 10 10:03:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing you connect to the sound card is your decks, everything else is ran out of the mixer like normal.   You can record straight out of Traktor using the software, or connect to the booth output on the 92 straight out to the microphone on your computer and into audacity.  I think you are getting confused about how the sound card is connected, RCAs from each channel into the sound card, RCAs back out and into the mixer for each deck. Monitors are connected to master on the mixer like normal."

Beatmatch,359dhx,jxnpope12,2,Fri May 8 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"Personally I started with software, then got a couple of turntables.  I've moved onto digital from there.  If you're open to using software, you can learn a lot about beat-matching, audio routing, basic deck setup, effects, ect without hitting your wallet too hard.  Since you would be learning, I would recommend you stay away from the sync buttons and automatic beat detections.  Mixxx is free software that you can start with.  After learning the software, moving to a controller will be much smoother.  If you're bent on getting a controller first, I would recommend something from craig's list or ebay.  Just get something cheap to start with.  You can get a lower end Numark or something like that.  Even if you walk into a best buy, some of the cheaper controllers are in there.  If you master the cheap controller and the software, and you figure it's not just a fad or hobby, move up to a bigger controller that integrates with Traktor or Serato. In my opinion, it would be best to dabble in the software, get a couple of cheap turntables (belt drives would be fine) and learn to beat match / BPM detect that way first.  Then move onto a mid-range or more expensive controller (or ""media player"" with a direct drive plater). Good luck."

Beatmatch,358blm,rednblack,2,Fri May 8 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"I guess that would be a good option, but I would still like to understand the crossfader settings so I can use them if I have to."
Beatmatch,358blm,Psythik,1 point,Fri May 8 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"Basicially, you want a faster curve for scratching, and a slower curve for mixing.  Hover your mouse over the ""Linear"" and ""Power"" options and the tooltip will tell you exactly what they do.  Any half-decent mixer should have a Crossfader Curve knob it. Your best option is to leave the software crossfader alone and use the hardware knob instead to make your adjustments until you've set your fader to exactly where you want it. As someone who mixes entirely with upfaders and only uses the crossfader for scratching and hard cuts, I leave mine on the fastest/sharpest setting at all times."
Beatmatch,358blm,YoungHef,-7,Wed May 13 22:23:24 2015 UTC,Your idea of normal DJing is to neuter your xfader and use your upfaders? I think you're less of a DJ and more of a mixerboard operating sound guy.
Beatmatch,358blm,jxnpope12,6,Fri May 8 13:16:34 2015 UTC,"Is this really a thing that people are about? I literally only use my upfaders, I feel like it gives me a lot more control over my style."
Beatmatch,358blm,Beau_Barger,2,Fri May 8 19:09:35 2015 UTC,"It does.....the crossfader is really only useful for scratching if you use the up-faders in the way that you do.  Many house djs use this method, including me, and its fine......Scratch DJs use the crossfader to cut scratching, but again, watch many PRO house DJs, they use the up faders or what some call volume faders."
Beatmatch,358blm,jxnpope12,1 point,Sat May 9 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah that makes sense, I mix a lot of club/trap/house so scratching isn't a big part of it."
Beatmatch,358blm,Wetenhall,3,Sun May 10 20:09:32 2015 UTC,So anyone that doesn't use their xfader is less of a DJ and more of a 'mixerboard' operating sound guy?  So what is your xfader on? Is nit not a 'mixerboard' of some sort and do you not operate it?
Beatmatch,358blm,YoungHef,-2,Fri May 8 13:29:28 2015 UTC,"Well really a DJ mixer, or a mic mixer or a sound board are all the same functionally, just with differences in control, functionality and interface.   On what I'd consider my main mixer, I've only got a linear adjustment on the crossfader, adjusting it only increases the point at which the next channel cuts-in to full volume. At max, the next track cuts in at full volume the instant we fade, or at min, it's a long linear approach that isn't fully volume until we get to center.  Personally, we just about 10% above the minimum linear setting. It makes a bigger target at center for 100% volume from both tracks. We work in super dark conditions most of the time and it's nice to not have the point right on center to get 100/100.   But we also have two hardware layers and two software layers to our setup, and an assortment of different controllers and instruments to bring into the mix. We're not exactly a standard DVS Serato setup."
Beatmatch,3599us,abletonlive9user,1 point,Fri May 8 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"I use a launchpad in my traktor setup! I use it with an American Audio 14MXR . The 14MXR which is a mixer and midi controller control decks 1 and 2 while I use my launchpad to control remix decks in decks 3 and 4. However, it's absolutely possible to use the launchpad with traktor without the mixer and control regular track decks and not just remix decks. djtechtools.com has some great mappings. Personally I like Traktor because to me it's a lot easier to mix internally than ableton. With ableton using a soundcard and mixing externally has always seemed to me the best option, but I'm sure there are plenty of other methods I'm not aware enough. I just wanted to throw my experience out, sorry if it isn't too much help."
Beatmatch,3599us,lolbeatporttop10,1 point,Fri May 8 04:51:45 2015 UTC,How'd you map your novation launchpad to your traktor? Do i need an external soundcard for mixing with only the launchpad?
Beatmatch,3599us,ClownTaint,3,Fri May 8 05:44:39 2015 UTC,"There are tons of mappings available online--finding the right one that suits your style of mixing could be a challenge though.

Beatmatch,3599us,ClownTaint,1 point,Fri May 8 16:13:26 2015 UTC,Does that mixer have a built-in soundcard? Do you do all your mixing externally? Does the lack of channel VU meters ever bug you? I've seen it before and would be interested in it as a backup.
Beatmatch,3599us,lolbeatporttop10,1 point,Fri May 8 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, it has a built in soundcard, and no the lack of vu meters doesn't really bug me too since traktor helps out a lot with making sure the gain of each track is set. As for if I mix externally, I don't. Everything is does internally within Traktor. The mixer has a feature called controller mode which allows you to switch everything to internal mixing mode. However, that being said, I don't use headphones, and I still haven't been able to get the headphone jack to work with my traktor setup. This isn't an issue to me because I don't need them, but if that's a big issue for you, mixing externally is always an option"

It was a problem for tons of people on the VMS4 too.  So you're saying I can route 4 decks into it to mix externally without an additional soundcard? Have you tried it out before?
Beatmatch,3599us,lolbeatporttop10,1 point,Fri May 8 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it myself because I don't have another soundcard, but yes it's possible, I was actually mixing externally for a little while prior to switching to internal. The mixer is essentially an external mixer first, with internal mixing capabilities. Controller mode off -> external, controller mode on -> internal. Really, the biggest downside to the mixer is pretty much the lack of tutorials and articles on it, which is a big downside when trying to attempt stuff like external mixing."

You should be fine running an RCA to an amp, although I'd invest in some really nice cables before doing so. Check monoprice for RCA to XLR shielded cables.  Edit: Wait a minute... I might need somebody else to chime in on whether this is a good idea. You're going from an unbalanced RCA to a balanced XLR (presumably) and that could get dicey without the proper conversion. You are probably safe, but I don't want to be held responsible for anything that could go wrong. Maybe allow a bit of time for someone else to check my math before running out and getting cables."

Try and keep things happy/preppy and clean if you can. I doubt they're going to want a lot of Nicki Minaj played at their wedding. Similarly, watch what kind of EDM remixes you play. It's a wedding, not an outdoor concert.  Also keep in mind that on a lot of this stuff you may not even be able to do real mixing if you haven't practiced it. If you aren't comfortable with mixing certain things then just do a fade-echo out combo and work with that.   Don't try and do something weird like 128 to 97, or at least not early in the night until you've warmed up and are comfortable.  95% of people can't tell/won't care about good mixing, but they sure know what bad mixing sounds like. You can use this to your advantage.   This is a good demonstration on how to mix pop and use the generic structure to your advantage.   Get recommendations from the couple, and maybe try and come up with a quick playlist of the music you think you'll play so that they can approve it as well.   Practice."

Beatmatch,3551ob,pyg1991,28,Thu May 7 04:04:58 2015 UTC,"this question gets asked like twice a week.  Maybe this should be on the sidebar?  quick answer - you can't.  That's too drastic a bpm change to mix and beatmatch smoothly like you would mixing two tracks in a similar range.  Even with modern key lock, the tempo change is too drastic and will sound like shit when pitched up or down that much.  Here are ways you can do it so it doesn't sound like shit:    Get a transition track that starts at one tempo and changes into the other.  If you're on traktor, you will have to know how to beatmatch by ear as gridding in traktor doesn't allow for tempo changes.  In serato you can, but it's a pain in the ass to set all those grids.  Better to learn to beatmatch and you'll come away with an essential skill. stop one track, play the next. echo out one track and drop the next. stop track, get on the mic, and then drop the next. slowly inch up or down your tempos over multiple songs to get to - where you want get to. fade out one track, drop next find a track with an nice ambient, beatless breakdown, find another track in the new tempo with a beatless, ambient intro and fadeout/fadein loop or hold echo at a 1/3 beat and mix in the next tune as if it's a full beat - give you about a 30 bpm change If you're on turntables, you can drop a track at 45, power down the turntable until the dots are at 33 and start it up again.  Gives you about a 25 Bpm drop"

Beatmatch,3551ob,dat303,2,Sat May 16 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"Something like that - so most turntables have a power-down feature that essentially allows the motor to spin down on its own.  That's how you get that slowdown sound on vinyl.  What you do is while your track is playing on 45, turn off the power so the track winds down and watch the dots.  When the 33 dots start lining up, turn the deck back on and press start and you'll be at a slower tempo - I think it might be closer to a 30 Bpm shift."

Another cool effect I liked to do is the line up a build from one track into a break from the next, when you get to the drop, stop the deck so you get that vinyl stop sound, but then gently nudge the platter backwards so you get this cool little reverse power down effect transitioning into the next track."

Beatmatch,3551ob,scrap5,3,Thu May 7 12:08:34 2015 UTC,"People are actually saying this can't be done smoothly? For real?  Look, it totally depends on the tracks. For example, if they are stock simple four to the floor, with a simple intro and outro, then loop each of them, then beatmatch them and gradually slow each down together, keeping the tempo, until you can drop out the first track and focus on the second.  Or, if they have a more ambient or beatless intro and outro then slowly fade from one to the other. You can use external samples as well, but you can deviate the tempo correctly without ruining the dance floor if the audience can easily transition through while still moving.  The techniques listed below are totally useful too, but there are tracks that enable you to do really drastic tempo changes, depending on how the songs are set up. If you're using software, don't hesitate to use cue points as well. Sometimes the outro or breakdown of a song will make a much better starting point, and then you can quickly jump right back to the melody or intro."
Beatmatch,3551ob,frecheguy,2,Thu May 7 12:54:08 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I use different remixes of the same song to switch bpm's like that. An example would be Showtek's Booyah (128) and Booyah (Party Favor Remix) (145). This requires some practice and creativity, but isn't very hard."
Beatmatch,3551ob,BadgerSmaker,2,Thu May 7 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"This technique works for me in serato (Track A is 128 Track B is 140.)  while track A is playing set the bpm of b to around 132 using the pitch fader. SLOWLY raise the bpm of A to match the new bpm of B and press sync when the bpm's match. This will allow you to control the pitch of both traks while using only one pitch fader so you can control EQ's with your free hand. when you are ready to mix, play track B and beatmatch, begin to increase the bpm of the tracks up to 148 and mix out of track A"
Beatmatch,3551ob,ClownTaint,1 point,Thu May 7 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"If I have a big jump to do, in Traktor I use Keylock and turn on sync for both tracks, I tag all my tracks with the start/end of the track like this so when the first track gets to its Fade Out Maker (5) I know to jog the incoming track (which I've been looping with) to its Load in Marker (7).    I then set the incoming track as master, once the outgoing track hits cue point 4 the incoming track hits cue point 2 and I set the tempo of the incoming to it's native 100 (you can double click the tempo meter for this, or on my S4 I press both the tempo offset buttons), kill the bass on the outgoing track, add filter, kill the volume slightly then mix out the track & turn off sync.  Sometimes I will steadily increase/decrease the BPM during the 32 bar build of the incoming track.  Here I jumped from 126BPM to 100BPM, the result is in the mix video.  I do this for 128 > 140 & 140 > 175 etc etc.  I find it allows me to get more varied genres into my mixes without too much effort."
Beatmatch,3551ob,PhreekHouse,2,Thu May 7 12:35:17 2015 UTC,I do the same thing but I have buttons on my controller mapped to increase and decrease tempo ever so slightly. Sometimes a gradual tempo increase or decrease can sound really cool.

Beatmatch,354tvf,Consipiracies,6,Thu May 7 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"I started my senior year of highschool. What I would recommend that you do is download a free version of virtual DJ and just get a feel for what DJing is like. Mess around, have fun with it. If you like the general feel, move onto a controller and delve deeper into it. Its a whole different experience with a controller/TT's, but you'll get a decent sense of what its like to mix on a computer, plus you won't spend a bunch of money and figure out that its not for you. Also, look at some be at matching tutorials and learn your history. Its all super important later on :)"

Beatmatch,354tvf,AlexEscapedFate,2,Thu May 7 06:00:33 2015 UTC,"Well, first, you'd have to learn the elements of mixing and be at matching before you can learn to scratch. As far as controllers go, I personally started with a traktor s2. The s2 mk1 should be relatively cheap but I wouldn't be able to tell you right off the bat. This sub does have a sidebar with threads that give you more info on which controller might be for you and their respective price. One thing I will say is take a look at both traktor and serato as software. Figure out which one would fit your flow and that might help you make a smarter purchase. Just a word of advice, ellaskins is a great tutor on YouTube. You'll also suck for a while, but don't let it keep you down, we have all been there. You might have great taste, but you'll need the skills. Practice and I promise you that the day will come when it all ""clicks"". Best of luck!"

Beatmatch,355fv8,Sniktsnakt,1 point,Thu May 7 17:49:26 2015 UTC,It's a midi controller. Any knob can be remapped to control something in the software.
Beatmatch,355fv8,Psythik,1 point,Thu May 7 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"If your controller doesn't have a filter knob, the only way to add a filter is to either buy a cheap secondary MIDI controller like the AKAI LPD8 or Korg nanoKONTROL2, or remap an existing knob to the filter. Personally I'd remap the Booth Monitor, Balance, Mic Volume, or Mid EQ knob (depending on your situation and what your controller has) because they're the only ones you can probably get by with not having IMO. Go to the Mappers settings, press Key-Learn, then turn the knob you want to remap. Now under Action, type filter.   Keep in mind that VDJ's filter sounds like shit, especially if you're using a version older than 8.0, so instead of going through the trouble of remapping, I would download Filters TexZK and use that instead. But keep in mind that it gets grouped in with all the other effects, so you have to select it from the effects list to use it and it shares the same knobs as every other effect. But it sounds so much better than VDJ's shitty filter."

My first recommendation would be to get a crossover like the Behringer Super-X Pro CX2310, and all the necessary cables to make it work with the SR. But before you run out let me know what your setup looks like.  A crossover basically takes a single set of inputs and splits it into two sets of outputs--a high/mid signal for your tops (all bass is removed) and a low signal for your subs (all highs and mids are removed). It's a clean way to run sound."
Beatmatch,352xwu,ClownTaint,1 point,Wed May 6 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"Go for a DSP unit like a driverack or ds24.   It'll include limiting and EQ, all in one."

Beatmatch,352xwu,AlexEscapedFate,2,Wed May 6 18:01:47 2015 UTC,cross over will make it sound better and prob save your tops from distorting if they are driven to hard  i suggest going from your controller into a cross over into the subs Unless your sub has a built in cross over

Beatmatch,351n38,ultramarioihaz,2,Wed May 6 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't consider anything else but pioneer or A&H, and A&H is much more cost effective for the average bedroom DJ. I currently own an A&H xone 23c, had the xone 22 for a while. Their sound quality is arguably better than pioneer, as well as the filter. If you want effects A&H probably isn't the way to go but their mixers are solid and will do just about anything you need them to (they have an fx send and return!). The xone 22's filter setup can be a little irritating, especially the pop depending on how you use it, but 200 USD for A&H 3 band total kill eq and a VCF filter? It's a deal. The 23c is also a deal: 400 USD, a more modern take on the 22, improved interface for filter, and it has a soundcard. Just an N.I. soundcard alone costs 400, and their Z2 is a sad excuse for a mixer. So far the 23c will only work with A&H software, mix vibes, but I am sure something can be worked out for other software (serato and A&H club kit might get expanded). Go with a 2 channel A&H or pioneer!"

Beatmatch,351n38,dj_soo,1 point,Wed May 6 17:01:58 2015 UTC,Okay Ty :) Do you think the 23c is worth the upgrade even if i have the soundcard of my MBP ?
Beatmatch,351n38,dj_soo,2,Wed May 6 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"You can't really compare a MBPs soundcard and a standalone pro soundcard/mixer integrated card. It just depends on how you want to use it. If you want DVS like me, I think it's worth it. Since you only want vinyl, the 23 or 22 should do just fine. But note you can only use cross mix vibes with an A&H soundcard, probably serato in near future (look at serato club kit for A&H). I started on VDJ, adamant fan of traktor, I've used serato too, and now I'm transitioning to mix vibes. You could always get a 22, 23, then upgrade to an external soundcard from traktor or serato. But note that the 23c is 400 dollars and any N.I. soundcard alone will cost about 400 as well. If you're married to the software then consider buying a soundcard from the same company."

Beatmatch,351n38,Ciccone,1 point,Thu May 7 04:55:36 2015 UTC,"ecler makes great mixers - especially for vinyl.  Their preamp quality is up there with allen and heath and rane, their build quality is fantastic, and the sound quality is amazing.  Minus is they aren't really producing anything new and haven't since the mid-00s so you'll be getting a mixer that probably closer to a decade old.  It's also lacking in modern features that have become more or less standard these days so it's a basic 3-channel mixer.  No effects, no filters, no midi - just straight audio faders, eqs, and gains."
Beatmatch,351n38,Whitestep,2,Thu May 7 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"Do you ever want to use DVS?  If so and you want to use serato, the akai amx isn't a bad option.  $250 for the mixer, $99 for the DVS upgrade (which you'll need to play vinyl) and you get a basic mixer + the ability to use serato dj.   You do need to have serato running to play straight vinyl tho.  Other than that, for a cheap mixer, look at a pioneer 250, a xone 23, or a djtech dif-1  Best out of the bunch for sound is probably the xone, best for scratching is the djtech.   I wouldn't go numark myself."
Beatmatch,351n38,Whitestep,1 point,Wed May 6 20:41:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. As i'm just starting i can't say if i'm gonna use a DVS or not. I fount a really nice xone 22 (160-180€) i can test near where i live. So i'll probably go for that as the only second-hand Akai AMX are way too far. I never tried Serato even though i read a lot of VDJ vs Serato vs Traktor vs XXX debates, so the Xone is probably a safer choice as i've not decided which DVS to use."

They are first off transcoded so you're encoding twice, and 2nd off, a result of an unreliable source (the audio could have been uploaded at 128).  Also, just because the artist put them on spotify doesn't give you carte Blanche to rip and perform whenever you like.  It just means the artist is willing to allow you to stream from spotify - not rip their stuff to perform shitty sounding dj sets.  Tl;dr:  256 is fine if you're getting them from a valid source.  It is not fine if you're ripping from a streaming site."

Assuming you're not trying to get an unreleased track from a huge artist, you have a good chance of them getting back to you with a Dropbox download link to the file. Let them know you'll be playing their track at a DJ gig - they'll appreciate the promotional exposure. I've done it a few times now, and it's worked about 50% of the time."

Some 320 is actually not 320 and is just saved as such.    How do I define if it's REAL 256kbps? The steam-source was on 320kbps but the programm could only rip 256kbps... Is there a program that tells me if the source has really 256 kbps or is it just impossible to define it after the rip?   To check you can use an app called Spek. When you analyze a song with it, there will be dark lines and spikes at certain frequencies (16k?). I can't remember honestly.  This webpage should help you use Spek and understand how you can tell the real quality of audio files.    If 256kbps isn't useable, HOW can I get certain mixes (that are not downloadable though any legal source) in a higher quality than 256kbps?   For things I can't find legally, I use vibeclouds. Normally there are a couple versions of the same song, some better quality than others.    If 256 is not enough, is 320 useable in Clubs? Or do I have to get everything in FLAC?   I try my absolute best not to play anything less than 320, I'm sure in a medium size lounge or a small room in a club it won't matter but you can start to notice on the larger systems. And no, you don't need it in FLAC, but use the best you have."
Beatmatch,350iiw,nowenknows,4,Wed May 6 02:44:55 2015 UTC,"256 is fine for most settings.  Unless you're playing on a $200,000 funktion 1 or void audio rig with a roomful of audiophile sound snobs, and I doubt even they would be able to tell the difference in a club setting.  Anyone who thinks they can hear a difference between 256 and 320 in a club with all the ambient noise and waves of subbass, is generally lying to themselves.  Things do not really become noticable until you get down to 128 and maybe some 192 files.  256 AAC (iTunes files) is exactly the same as 320 MP3.  Strive for 320 mp3s, but it's not the end of the world if you play a 256 MP3 file."

Anything less and you can start to hear artifacts and the mudding of the audio into a terrible unimpressive mix. You want .WAVs or .FLACs all day, I routinely siphon out anything under 320 just out of habit. If you cant score a copy of it from one of the producers outlets (lots of free downloads if you did through their media) or buy it from a verified source, you could try torrents maybe, but stolen music can be just as hit and miss. Its all trial and error, quality is king though."

Beatmatch,34xwyb,jpmoney2k1,7,Tue May 5 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"Processor (from i5 to i7, for instance)   It won't make a large difference in Traktor unless you happen to be crunching mathematical formulae in the background. Traktor runs fine on an i5.  (caveat: Serato can analyse more tracks the more cores you have (1 track per core/logical core) and someone with a 4 core without hyper-threading can do 4 tracks at a time while someone with a quad i7 and hyper-threading can do 8 at a time... doesn't apply to Traktor and only applies to analysis in Serato not general function. (The same applies to Mixed in Key))   RAM (from 4GB to 8GB)   Traktor can run on 2GB of RAM so you won't see a measurable difference between 4 and 8 unless you're multitasking and it's using a lot of RAM.   RAM is one of those things where for most people having more doesn't do anything. If you aren't using all of the RAM you have then adding more won't do anything. Having ass loads of RAM is really only necessary for some gaming, running virtual machines, graphics and video software that will use whatever is available, and so on. The only thing on a DJ laptop that could potentially be using lots of RAM during a set is Chrome which you shouldn't be using while DJing anyway ;D   Drive (from HDD to SSD)   Faster boot time, and faster load time. This is the one thing you should definitely invest in.   which upgrade above would be recommended for someone that experiences audio issues when scratching?   That's probably a driver or your latency settings. An i5 with 4GB of RAM should not cause latency issues."

You might get marginally quicker boot up and Traktor loading time and hsve more backup headroom if something starts running in the background.   But an SSD upgrade is one of the best overall upgrades you can make. The faster read times will make for much faster boot up and Traktor loading as well as speed up Track load and analysis.

So you push and hold the cue button to start the transition and then hit play to make it continue? (The cue button on my decks only plays the track as long as it's held.)   For me it's about 1 button vs. 2... Pressing play is one action, holding cue and then with another finger pressing play is two.  It's also about opportunity to fuck up... you could let the pressure off the cue button a while pivoting your hand to press play and the track could stop or if the cue button is dodgy (which it is on a lot of house owned CDJs) it might not actually start playing when you push it 100% of the time."

Turntablism aside (sort of) I've long felt that i've hit a wall in terms of mixing. I'm an able beatmatcher,with headphones or on the fly without, but i feel (outright know) that my song selection is still lacking after all of this time. i make notes of tunes that go well together (actually i take screenshots when using Serato so i can see the exact phrasing of the two tracks) but beyond that i'm still in the dark. I thought that this would be something that would just 'click' with me at some point but still no dice.  My typical sets are usually confined by genre as i have trouble mixing between genres a lot of the time and i usually go for longer smoother transitions rather than fast cuts. My song selection is a bit slap-dash, i'll pick something and then, pretty much randomly, pick something else (sometimes just because i know they go together and other times as pot luck).  I've had no musical training or education and i'm uncertain of how much of an impact this may be having which further fills me with doubt. I'm introverted at the best of times and wonder if it would be beneficial to find some DJ buddies to associate with and bounce ideas/routines/findings around with - What would be a good way to achieve this in the UK?.  Back to the turntablism, following on from something i read in the wonderful world or reddit a while back i've tried to pick up something new but related in order to keep DJ'ing as a whole 'fresh' but i'm finding that after a short period of scratching i either get 'wankers cramp' or my forearms are that strained that i cant keep up an identifiable and consistent rhythm on either hand, this has been going on for about a year now (as i pick it up and put it down again). Can anyone reassure me that this is a phase everybody's been through? how long did it take you to overcome yours to a noticeable degree? what was your process?"

Beatmatch,34xwyb,raftdunk,2,Wed May 6 00:30:09 2015 UTC,The booth outputs are for monitors (speakers in the DJ booth for the DJ.)

Beatmatch,34xwyb,Derezzed_Iben,2,Wed May 6 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"Basically, Mixer into booth, booth speakers point towards DJ. Mixer into main, main speakers point towards crowd.   Yup, Monitors -> Booth / Mains -> Master Out.   If I wanted to add booth speakers to my setup, what am I looking for in particular?    You can use the same kind of speakers you would use as your mains, they just don't need to be as powerful since they'll be close to you. You also generally want active (powered) monitors just for simplicity. Subs are not generally necessary in a monitor stack but some big names will have them on their rider.  Lots of people use things like JBL EONs or Mackie Thumps as monitors. Ie, something like this: http://www.pssl.com/Powered-Full-Range-Speakers/JBl-EON315-15-in-2-Way-Powered-PA-Speaker-280W   Do they only matter in larger venues or just anytime you sit/stand behind the main speakers?

Beatmatch,34xwyb,Derezzed_Iben,1 point,Wed May 6 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"Booth output is for a set of monitors in the dj booth that allows for an individual volume control.  The reason you use those is to give more control to the dj when in the booth.  Often, Djs will ramp up the volume because they need more sound from the monitors.  The problem is, it's very easy to go past the point of comfortable listening or dancing levels on the floor.  By using a separate knob for the booth monitors, the dj can adjust the levels in the dj booth without affecting the sound on the dancefloor to the main speakers."

Ideally i'm looking to create something like 3laus house or like diplo and friends type of mix where i can just send it to my friends.   I tried ableton but some of the songs I imported from itunes kept getting sped up, any suggestions?"
Beatmatch,350vnd,cruxclaire,2,Wed May 6 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"When you double click on your clips/tracks inside an audio track in Ableton, in the bottom left of your screen, you should see some info about track tempo. If ""warp"" is highlighted yellow, double click it to deactivate warping on the track. If you want to make a blended/beatmatched mix with songs playing at the same speed, you can change the overall BPM in the top left corner. Auto Warping to the master BPM doesn't always work perfectly, but if you look up Ableton warping guide on YouTube, lots of people have demonstrated how to set warp points to make sure the song is warped properly.  EDIT: I just wanted to add that in my experience, it's easier and more fun to mix live with VDJ or Mixxx and record with Audacity (also free, if you don't have it already) than with Ableton, just because I find setting warp points to be tedious/time-consuming. When you mix, you generally make tracks the same speed as one another so you can transition/play them at the same time, and that's much easier to do (in my opinion) with a software like VDJ. If you just want to fade out and fade in without beatmatching, then Ableton might be better because the possibilities for effects and modifying the tracks are much more extensive."
Beatmatch,350vnd,thedjally,1 point,Wed May 6 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"I'm no ableton master, but I believe you set the tempo as a master (although I believe it can be changed as your mix progresses). If you do not change it, it will automatically speed up / speed down any subsequent tracks to the ""master"" tempo, which is probably being set by the first song you drag in.  Mixmeister is like ableton lite in that it automatically adjusts the master tempo for you. Good for starting off IMO."

Beatmatch,34z4hr,dj_soo,5,Wed May 6 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple, just flip to the first beat of the drop of track B when the first beat of the drop of track A would hit. If you have fader start then use that."

Beatmatch,34z4hr,marcusthejames,1 point,Mon May 11 19:18:30 2015 UTC,If you are in Traktor a trick I just learned is move the play head to the end of the track but keep it playing with channel fader up and cross fader open. Then when you hit the cue it will jump right to a drop or a drop intro like a acapella or new genre all together. In serato just loop the track right before the start for the same effects.

Beatmatch,34wj2r,eazye102,5,Tue May 5 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"1)Go to the bars you want to dj at often enough that they know you, but not too much that they see you as a regular/drunk.   2)become friends with the bartenders/manager/owner.  3)Inquire about their DJ situation. Ask if they have any off nights available for new djs(sun-wed, depending on the place)  4)Volunteer to spin for free. Show em what you got. You say you've got skills but they don't know that. The money will come but playing live in a bar setting is a whole different beast from djing parties at your fraternity.   5) Kill it. Don't get wasted, play to the room and just be confident and cool. If you murder a set and bring lots of people put they may just pay you after all. But for real, my biggest successes have come from putting myself out there pro bono. It's not until later on that the bigger gigs and bigger pay days happen. Be patient."
Beatmatch,34wj2r,queenw_hipstur,2,Tue May 5 04:56:11 2015 UTC,"I've done what you're looking to do a couple different times; generally agree with the idea of going around to the bars.  I visited different local places with a mix cd in my pocket (this was 10-15 years ago); for you, a cd, usb drive, or a business card with online links to your mixes should work. In my opinion, no need to invest much time making friends, unless you want to - first time there, I'd get a drink or three, talk to the bartender, and ask about the dj situation. See if you can have a quick chat with the manager; good chance you'll be able to. If the manager's out, leave your card/mix with the bartender (with a little tip if you're feeling generous). Repeat the process at other places. Depending on your tolerance, you can do a couple in a night. Most likely you'll at least get a paid tryout somewhere.  One key advantage - you'll be a new graduate of the local college with ties to a fraternity. Let the local establishments know; it'll be implied you can bring people, or at least deliver a unique appeal.  Pay can depend on the city/market you're in. Personally, I never really negotiated (probably should have); made $35-40 an hour spinning Top 40 on weekends at a popular college bar just outside Boston. Made about half that at a no-frills spot in a rural Southern college town, but cost of living was a lot lower too. Fancier places in bigger cities you should probably make more, hopefully with raises as you build a track record. Another thing to keep in mind - unless you're in the middle of nowhere, you'll probably have competition, so that may influence your ability to negotiate, especially if you're new.  General advice: be persistent. Situations at bars can be fluid, so even if a residency is filled one day, things can change (dj's & managers come and go). Also, be prepared for rejection - I've been ignored or had a tryout with no callback a bunch of times. All it takes is one or two places to say yes, and you're in business.  Another avenue to consider (in addition to bar gigs) - use your college connection to continue doing frat parties. Contact student groups in the fall, build and maintain a network with the underclassmen, and try to become a go-to guy for private parties and bigger campus events. At least initially, it won't be as frequent as a bar gig, but they should pay considerably more.  Of course, all of this is just my experience. Certainly wasn't the most successful guy, but I did ok. Hope things work out for you."

Beatmatch,34rhwz,FrameCrate,6,Sun May 3 22:54:20 2015 UTC,"This requires an ""out"" mapping from Traktor. Here's how to do it:   Open Traktor settings -> Controller manager. Choose your device/controller at the top. Click ""Add Out..."" and choose the action, for example if you want you LED to be blue when sync is on: Deck Common -> Sync. Click ""Learn"" below ""Device Mapping"" when your new out mapping is selected. Click the button with the LED on your controller, you will see that Traktor maps your out mapping to that very button. Click ""Learn"" again to disable learning mode. ""Type of Controller"" in the bottom should now say LED, and you can tweak these settings to get the color you want if it's an RGB LED.   Note that an out mapping isn't very useful by itself. An out-mapping is only a way for Traktor to tell your controller to do something. You need to combine it with other actions (for example, toggling sync as in the example above)."

I mean really, transitioning large BPM gaps can be fun from time to time but I've used this advice far more than I've used the DJTT advice.  edit: Sorry i can't help you on your specific examples, but I hope that video helped you discover some creative ways to transition BPMs"

Echo freeze or high/low pass filters (usually high) are a good way to fade towards silence without making people too annoyed by the BPM change when you introduce a new song"
Beatmatch,34nl3e,fluffkomix,3,Thu May 7 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"If you said Traktor, and this is a problem, you probably need to research sync settings.  And if you're a DJ, the music theory of double time and half time need to be in your arsenal.  You can manipulate any tempos together.  Don't be afraid to learn some theory. Try this."
Beatmatch,34nl3e,djjordank,1 point,Sat May 2 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, so this is how you do that with sync: while song one is playing, adjust tempo for song 2 to match song one, and then press sync on both tracks. phrase up song 2 so you have some time to transition. press play, choose song 2 to be your master tempo, and start sliding the tempo on song 2 to it's original bpm, slowing both songs down equally.   Only works if you have your beat grids set. Also, I generally choose the same range for my tracks, as in always doing 165 bpm instead of 87.5 bpm, 140 instead of 70, etc. That's personal preference though."
Beatmatch,34nl3e,sheevlweeble,1 point,Sun May 3 09:19:36 2015 UTC,"And to your first example: in traktor you can manipulate your grid. 82.5 bpm can be multiplied to 165 bpm in your software. Now you're only talking a 15 bpm shift in the software, double time aside, but I have a feeling in the mix one, or both, of those songs is playing at a modified bpm so its more like a 10bpm shift if there was one at all."

Beatmatch,34nl3e,Psythik,1 point,Sun May 3 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"If you can rock the hi-low pass then that's one way to achieve it...  I mean, not the BEST by any means, but it works.  On song a, bring up the high pass while bringing the cross fader over (maybe a series of FX for this as well?), bring the crossfader to center, and bring the hi-low-whatever-EQ you got down to fading out on one song, bringing in the other. One song will completely disappear and the other will be mixed in. Bring the crossfader all the way over quickly... and done."
Beatmatch,34nl3e,Sir_Mr_Bman,0,Sun May 3 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"If you use sync:  Here is something I use at the top 40, hip hop, popular house gig I do about twice a month. Coming out of a 100bpm hip hop / trap / twerk routine back into top 40.  For this example I use House of Pain's - ""Jump"" (Song A) 105BPM and Calvin Harris's - ""Let's Go"" (Song B) 127bpm featuring Neyo.   Loop a vocal in song A, I use ""jump."" As soon as I trigger that loop I also start song B 8 bars from the drop, sync on, key lock on both tracks, volume fader around the middle. This song has a pretty clean riser before the drop so it works well. I then begin to raise the tempo on song A while simultaneously raising the volume on song B. Get to your desired BPM and kill song A right before Neyo says ""Lets go"" and you're cleanly at 127BPM.   And slamming. I slam a lot into drastic bpm changes."
Beatmatch,34oel5,silasj,5,Sun May 3 01:09:11 2015 UTC,"Unless you're scratching or just plain lazy, turning off the crossfader and using volume upfaders is a more accurate way to mix. So you should ideally be using upfaders unless you have a specific reason not to. Really though, there are a few other things that matter a lot more than how exactly precisely smooth your mix is. Most DJs I know personally barely even fucking use the gain knobs  And really you're going to find your own style depending on what you mix, east coast vs west coast shouldnt be a concern. Do what works for you its all the same in the end"
Beatmatch,34oel5,Canadian_Government,2,Sun May 3 02:43:32 2015 UTC,Crossfader works better for quick cuts and scratch-ins while upfaders work better for smooth mixes.  Mixing smooth with a gentle Crossfader setting only gives you half the fader to get a track to full volume while using the upfaders gives you the full length of the fader so it's more precise.
Beatmatch,34oel5,dj_soo,2,Sun May 3 09:10:25 2015 UTC,Only beginners mix with the crossfader. Mine's always set to the sharpest setting because the only thing I use it for is scratching or hard cut ins.
Beatmatch,34oel5,Psythik,1 point,Sun May 3 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"I've been using the crossfader only for blends for 21 years now mixing house. I do scratch and do 2 record tricks quite often, and I usually keep the crossfader curve fully sharp, however, I do set it to a softer curve when I'm blending usually. I also have always used only a 2 channel mixer( currently a Rane TTM57), since I never seen the need for using more than 2 tracks at a time. Do whatever you're most comfortable with."
Beatmatch,34oel5,ssa7777,1 point,Sun May 3 06:09:56 2015 UTC,"Wow... crossfader is for beginners? hah  You have, effectively, 4 volume stages before the mixer hits the master out: gain, EQ, volume and crossfader. Using all of them correctly gives you great control over how songs blend in and out.  When I'm mixing two decks, I use the crossfader on a rather smooth curve, and generally once you get to three decks, and especially four, it becomes too difficult to manage levels with it. Is it required? No. Is it better? Not really. Is it preference? Yes.  Spin the way you feel comfortable getting the best blends. There is no right way to get the perfect mix, there is only the perfect mix."

Beatmatch,34lzge,marymelodic,1 point,Sat May 2 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"OP was saying that they already had a sound card, so they didn't really need a controller with a built in one.  To answer your question, a sound card converts the digital signal output from your computer's DJ software into an analog signal that can be played on speakers or headphones.  Your computer has one built-in, but its sound quality typically isn't considered good enough for a large PA system. The other benefit of a DJ sound card/audio interface is that it can handle two stereo outputs. This would allow you to play one song through the main speakers, and listen to the next one through your headphones. This is helpful in choosing the next song, and in manually beatmatching it to the currently playing track before transitioning.  If you're not doing big gigs and are using Sync to beatmatch, I guess you don't really need a sound card."

Beatmatch,34kx1j,michaelvaf,2,Sat May 2 01:31:54 2015 UTC,Impress your playing a trance set it's not so much a journey as a bunch of similar journeys back to back ie the nature of trance is generally mixed as a journey bit other genres tend to be reach track a journey and the the journey(track) is similar too the one before.   At least imo.
Beatmatch,34kx1j,copeybitcoin,1 point,Sat May 2 07:52:28 2015 UTC,So you do you potentially use each track to move between genres / tempos? or do you keep it all pretty similar? like this is a house set at 127 - or this is a glitch hop set at 100..
Beatmatch,34kx1j,WattageandTwattage,3,Sat May 2 12:46:25 2015 UTC,You're still overthinking it. Just play good tunes. If you think the time is right to switch genres/tempo then go ahead and do it
Beatmatch,34kx1j,copeybitcoin,1 point,Sat May 2 13:04:28 2015 UTC,Agree with guy above me. I find on the fly let's you judge what tracks best next
Beatmatch,34kx1j,WattageandTwattage,2,Sat May 2 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly I wouldn't worry too much about it. To me it sounds like you just didn't find the tunes that the crowd wanted until you were 1/3 into your set, or, they just weren't ready to groove yet. I hear a lot of talk about telling a story or creating a journey but I've never really heard it live. What usually does the trick for me is to play songs that fit the moment and also songs that I really like. You're leading the party. If you're into the tunes that you're playing and your confident that they're appropriate for the environment then everything else will pretty much fall into place  However, if you're looking for inspiration in creating a musical journey then I would suggest listening to any mix from Bassnectar. Better yet, go see him live. IMO he is the absolute master of creating a ""journey"" with music"
Beatmatch,34kx1j,brokenstack,1 point,Sat May 2 03:04:54 2015 UTC,Thanks mate. Nice to hear. Will definitely help my intention in setting up a set next time. Bassnectar is the man. I guess I just feel like I aint got a feel for what gets the floor moving - I'm sure that'll come with practice.
Beatmatch,34kx1j,A73357,1 point,Sat May 2 12:42:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, while I think the ""journey"" part is important in theory, it's more about stringing songs together that make sense and control energy. Read a crowd by more than dancing. Are they tapping their feet? Nodding their heads? Standing with their arms crossed? Waiting around the dance floor, waiting for that track that blows them away and get out and jam out to?  If you jump around too much, change the energy and feel too drastically too quickly, then they won't know how to deal with that. There won't be consistency, and once they get into it you'll drag them out again."

Beatmatch,34junv,Dantejb,2,Fri May 1 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Want to second Dantejb's point about the headphone cue - what I find works for me is to have the cue set so that I can hear both tracks in my headphones. I typically have one ear cup on and one off, so I can focus on both where the current song is and the song I'm bringing in. I find it really helps to loop (say 8 or 16 bars) of the song I want to bring in, and just spend some time making sure that both tracks kick drums are playing at exactly the same time, then boom, let the loop go and find a point where you want to bring the track in. Then, slowly bring up the fader of the second track, loop the first, and slowly bring that out! Voila. Obviously, there's more to be done, with EQ and such, but that's a start."

Beatmatch,34junv,Toxic_Orange_DM,2,Sat May 2 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone's gotta start somewhere! VDJ is how I started getting interested in DJing as well :)   If you'e spinning purely on VDJ, sync is your friend, as manual beatmatching is impossible. Use the settings next to the pitch slider to return tracks to their original BPMs, and try to keep your track selections within around +3 / -3 BPM either way, to make life easier for you. You should still be able to configure VDJ so you have sound playing out of the speakers but the cue coming through your headphones alone, so you can see how things sound together without actually having them play at the same time.   If you're feeling more serious about this whole hobby, try and jam on a friends kit or get hold of cheap gear on eBay / craigslist. I got a Numark Mixtrack Pro that has served me well (did my first gig on that thing!). Good luck! If you have more questions, feel free to PM, I'll do my best to help you out."

Beatmatch,34hfex,SaltyBandido,6,Fri May 1 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"I think if you want to be a well-rounded DJ, you first need to get a solid foundation with the 4 basic technical skills: -   Beatmatching. There's various reasons to learn to do it manually. You can mix on any equipment that has pitch sliders with minimal adjustment. You might find it more fun/rewarding. You can mix songs without having to make sure the beatgrids are nice and accurate. You can mix with other DJs across multiple setups. Phrase matching. Mixing is basically about overlapping parts of 2 or more songs. Phrase matching is about knowing which parts of songs to overlap and for how long. EQs. That includes using them during transitions, using them as effects of sorts, and using them to adjust for songs that may lack a bit of bass, high end, or whatever. Gains. Knowing how to properly set the gains to keep the track to track levels of your mixes nice and consistent. It's by far the easiest one of the 4 to learn.   Those 4 skills are like the foundations that everything else is built upon. A lot of DJs rush ahead into using effects and loops and stuff before they've got solid foundations and their mix ends up the equivalent of a badly cooked meal with too much seasoning.  As for your question about beatmatching, what you would typically do is group tracks by BPM, rather than using extreme changes in pitch to try and make all songs fit with each other. Not every transition has to be a smooth, beatmatched blend, and that's especially true if you're playing a long set with various genres in it, or you're playing a genre like hip-hop where the BPM range is super wide across the genre.  For example, let's say I'm playing a track that's 100 BPM and I want to do a nice smooth blend into the next track. I wouldn't pick out a song that's 140 BPM, as that would require me to slow it WAY down and it's gonna sound odd. I'd pick out a song that's within a reasonable range of 100 BPM.  You can gradually speed things up or slow things down over the course of a few songs. For instance, if I'm playing a 100 BPM song and my next song is 105, I don't necessarily have to slow that song down to 100. I could nudge the pitch of the 100 BPM song up a bit.  So, if I was playing a hip-hop set, I might start off with some mid-tempo chilled out stuff. Tracks that are all at a fairly similar BPM. Then if I wanted to go into some fast tunes, I wouldn't try and do a smooth, beatmatched blend or spend the entire night gradually speeding up the pitch. I'd do a different type of transition, say, a power down, where I turn the power off on the track that's playing and let it gradually slow down, then I drop in the next track. Sometimes it's good to let the crowd know that a change is coming in that way."
Beatmatch,34hfex,SigmaTheDJ,4,Fri May 1 09:03:40 2015 UTC,Can you beatmatch by ear without the sync button and staring at on-screen information?
Beatmatch,34hfex,dj_soo,1 point,Fri May 1 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly no and I'm kind of confused about how to do it on the S2. I know there's the tempo faders but they limit how much +/- I can change the bpm from the original tempo. I've been thinking about this a lot lately, I know sync's cheating I just don't really know how to move forward"
Beatmatch,34hfex,dj_soo,3,Fri May 1 05:20:00 2015 UTC,Well there's something you can work on.  It's not so much sync is cheating as you're just cheating yourself out of an important skill that can really improve you as a dj.   Unlimited Bpm shifts is a bad thing and going to far from the original will make your track sound like shit.just practice beatmatching and learning your tunes.
Beatmatch,34hfex,anarchalien,1 point,Fri May 1 05:28:38 2015 UTC,"Ok cool thanks. What I'm still confused about is this: do I just use the tempo fader to match the new track? And is there a way to get past that limit i talked about. For example, the original bpm is 120, it would only let me move to 100 or 140."
Beatmatch,34hfex,junglizer,2,Fri May 1 05:32:36 2015 UTC,Isn't that range enough? maybe plan your set differently so there isn't such a drastic jump in BPM
Beatmatch,34hfex,nikolaprof,2,Fri May 1 07:20:20 2015 UTC,I highly recommend using tracks from the same genre to learn beatmatching. Anything over a +/- 10 BPM range is going to be really tough if you're still learning. House is a good choice since all of the elements are pretty clearly defined.
Beatmatch,34hfex,tmccoy00,1 point,Fri May 1 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"I think your keylock is on. When the keylock is on, you can only change the pitch for -+ 12% of the original (not sure about the number) and the key of the song doesn't change (that's why it's called keylock). What you want to do when you beatmatch is to take 2 songs of similar tempos and then speed up or slow down the one that you are transitioning into. When the BPMs are the same what is left for you to do is to use your jogwheels to make the beats match."
Beatmatch,34hfex,dj_soo,2,Fri May 1 11:19:14 2015 UTC,"There is a tempo range setting in the Mixer controls, allowing you to change the fader range up to 100% rather than the standard 8/10% range."
Beatmatch,34hfex,LynusBorg,1 point,Fri May 1 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yes - you use the tempo fader and match the beats.  Do it by ear instead of looking at the Bpm readout.  You can adjust the tempo range of the fader in the software, but honestly, anything more than 6% usually sounds like shit both with or without key lock.  Unless you're in for a specific effect, there are better ways to transition between large Bpm changes."
Beatmatch,34hfex,brokenstack,1 point,Fri May 1 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"Very good explanation of how to beatmatch:  https://youtu.be/wJ1JjA7Pvvc  It's done on CDJs but you can do the exact same thing on the S2.

Beatmatch,34hsyu,nadsaeae,5,Fri May 1 07:16:24 2015 UTC,Any of the free ones should sort you out for practicing. Try out Mixxx or Virtual DJ
Beatmatch,34hsyu,britty1983,1 point,Fri May 1 07:38:52 2015 UTC,Just a small doubt. Do you think traktor is overkill and too early?
Beatmatch,34hsyu,britty1983,5,Fri May 1 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"No, it's not overkill but the whole point of starting out on a free one is that you can see if it appeals to you, and you can learn the basics of mixing without having to pay anything. Obviously getting Traktor would be a good investment as it can work with a lot of other equipment, but how do you know that this is even something you wan to pursue? May as well find out first before starting to hand out cash."

If a studio acapellas doesn't exist, then you need an instrumental which is exactly the same as the instrumental used in the track (it isn't always) and invert the phase of the instrumental, line it up with the original and hope for the best.  Even then, it won't sound great."

Beatmatch,34aund,Getto425,13,Wed Apr 29 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"mashups work great if you included a ton of editing and sample manipulation that would take much more preparation to do it live.  Sometimes It's just much move convenient, less chance of making a mistake, you can even make it sound better then doing everything live.    I say if it sounds good to you, then use it.  If you have an idea for a mashup, then make it.  Nobody on the dancefloor is going to even tell or care, and that is your main concern.  Not other DJs."
Beatmatch,34aund,yomyex,2,Wed Apr 29 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, I can see your point. Just having a transition into another song can be done live, no point to pre-edit it."
Beatmatch,34aund,dj_soo,7,Thu Apr 30 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"If it sounds good and your crowd digs it then go for it.  There are some mashups I have that I really liken and I used to make a whole lot of them but don't really any more.  I know some Djs that edit everything they play and add acapellas to it and I known others that refuse to play anything but the originals but most will play whatever sounds good.  One thing I found about making mashups was that it was almost a gateway to production.  I started with straight a-b mashups and then moved onto more complex mashups involving multiple sample sources, then when into straight bootleg remixes of tracks by writing new basslines, drums, and synths for tracks and am now working on original tracks."

Beatmatch,34aund,SigmaTheDJ,3,Thu Apr 30 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"Mashups are not new. They have been making them since the early 80s.   Sometimes they can be really useful to get a party going or take it to the next level. So definitely have a go at them if you have some good ideas.   Like you said too many, too frequently, too quickly can get really irritating. So use them wisely."
Beatmatch,34aund,Chiafriend12,2,Wed Apr 29 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's 2 types of mashups: -   Basic. You take an acapella of one song and lay it over the instrumental of another and do very little else, or even nothing else. Advanced. You chop up the tracks and do some production in a DAW.   I don't have a problem with a DJ pre-making either, but I think it's more fun to do 1 live and if you can push your skills up to the level where you can do 2 live, using cue points, effects, loops and stuff, then that's great."

I personally don't make mashups but I do regularly make edits I don't distribute beyond my own library. If I don't like a breakdown I might remove it and go straight from a bridge to an outro, loop certain portions I think should go on longer, add extra vocals and vocal effects if I have the acapella, special intro edits, things like that."

Beatmatch,34aund,alexisaacs,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:26:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I generally dislike them. I have heard a few I like, but generally they are too frenetic for me, and they remove the best parts of most songs, just to focus on the hook and not the actual stuff that makes music great.  I am much more of a fan of doing long, complex blends, where I am using the rhythm from one song to replace, or overshadow, the rhythm of a second song. It... is kind of a mashup, but it's generally just done with some clever EQ and cue jumps.  But then again, the crowd is what matters and if they are having fun then you are doing something right."
Beatmatch,34c39u,houseandtechno,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:24:27 2015 UTC,Only way to use two soundcards in one instance of Traktor would be to aggregate your audio devices. Asio4all if you are on windows and Audio Devices if you are on Mac.

Beatmatch,347zxc,CheezGrater,2,Wed Apr 29 02:36:29 2015 UTC,Changing the tempo more than about ~6% will distort the song if you have key/pitch lock on. I change tempos all the time.
Beatmatch,347zxc,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. It will distort it, but you still change tempos?"
Beatmatch,347zxc,AxelFyren,5,Wed Apr 29 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"When you speed up or slow down a tune, you change the pitch accordingly.  What key lock does is maintain the pitch of the tune while allowing you to change the tempo.  How it does this is it subtley cuts out certain small (and ideally unnoticable) portions of the sound when speeding up or extends them when slowing down.  There is going to be a limit to how much it can be done without it being audible so if you pitch too far, you will hear artifacting and phasing.  Some pitch lock algorithms are better than others so some will allow you adjust the tempo at a greater degree than others before you hear the sound break up."
Beatmatch,347zxc,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"I think the confusion was because I thought pitch and tempo were the same thing :P My bad haha, thanks"
Beatmatch,347zxc,AxelFyren,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Now, this is a problem. For some reason people tend to call the slider for ""pitch-slider"", while it probably should be called tempo-slider?  Super confusing for new people. Important to difference pitch from tempo."
Beatmatch,347zxc,Jinnobi,4,Wed Apr 29 10:39:24 2015 UTC,"It's because the name was taken from turntables.  Before key lock, changing the pitch of a record would require speeding up or slowing down the turntable.  Because of modern key lock and time stretching offered in cdjs and software (and even some newer turntables), it is more appropriate to call it a tempo slider, but the traditional name stuck over the years."

Beatmatch,347zxc,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:24:05 2015 UTC,Is that different than the normal key lock on Serato?
Beatmatch,347zxc,itsDAP,2,Thu Apr 30 04:04:22 2015 UTC,"If you are using key lock, it can affect the sound quality.  If you are not, it will raise the frequency of the bass - too high and you will lose your sub tones."

Beatmatch,347zxc,itsDAP,8,Wed Apr 29 13:29:56 2015 UTC,This is incorrect.  Pitch is a result of certain tones resonating at certain frequency spectrums. If you raise or lower the tempo of a song (without key lock) you are altering the pitch of the track and therefor affecting the frequencies played.
Beatmatch,347zxc,Psythik,-2,Wed Apr 29 01:18:43 2015 UTC,Ill concede I guess. Semantics aside.
Beatmatch,347zxc,dj_soo,5,Wed Apr 29 02:19:14 2015 UTC,It's not semantics - changing the tempo of a song has a direct effect on pitch which is a result of the frequencies changing.  It's just that so many people are used to playing the key lock on these days (or have never even dj'd without it) that they don't really understand how tempo affects the pitch of recorded music.   Op even stated he thought pitch and tempo are the same thing when they aren't.
Beatmatch,347zxc,Jinnobi,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:44:29 2015 UTC,"You're right. When I said EQ, I meant the tempo literally killing your bass as if you had done so with your EQs, which unless you move it drastically, it does not "" kill the bass."" However, if you take it literally, as everyone did, moving tempo does affect pitch and in turn frequency. I worded poorly."
Beatmatch,347zxc,itsDAP,3,Wed Apr 29 19:44:43 2015 UTC,It has plenty to do with EQ if you have Master Tempo on. Making a song too fast definitely fucks up the bass.

I've never used the SC3900s, but from what I've heard they're great hardware.  What I want to warn you about, however, is not the hardware but Denon's ""Engine"" software.  It's their version of Rekordbox which you would use to analyze your USB or host media on your laptop and stream from it.  You do not have to use it.  You can just load MP3s and wav files onto a USB and play them; however if you want anything close to accurate BPM or wave display information, you'll want to use it.  The problem with it is it is complete and total, unadulterated, garbage.  I hate using it.  I loathe its existence.  As a software developer myself my soul cries every time I attempt to use it.  Denon hasn't updated it in over a year, and it doesn't look like they have any plans on open sourcing it to the community. Seriously, it's free so try and use it.  You will be begging for rekordbox, which is something I never thought I'd experience in my life.  To start with, If you have an analyzed library on your computer, and you copy over an analyzed track to a USB; it doesn't copy any of the metadata.  You have to re-analyze the track all over again on the USB.  Much fun when you have hundreds of songs.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg: It's lacking immensely obvious UI features, like the ability to modify the BPM or key information on more than one track at a time.  Oh, and you'll want to, because Engine's BPM detection is awful and I guarantee you it will be incorrect 90% of the time.  Want to manually edit each file's metadata at a time then? Get ready for the slowest goddamn process in the world.  Click to edit the bpm, track, key of a song - wait for 10 seconds while engine does... something? Edit the value, press enter - wait 10 more seconds for Engine to re-cache the data somehow, and then you're good to go.  It is slow and painful.  This assumes it doesn't just randomly crash because it is beyond unstable (I use windows, can't verify OSX compatibility).  It is garbage.  I hate it. I hate using it.  I hate everything about it.  I am legitimately saving up for Pioneer gear now because, despite Denon's hardware being wonderful their software makes the process of getting songs to my CDJs the most arduous, convoluted, frustrating, vomit inducing experience in the world - and that's a real shame."

Beatmatch,346kh1,dj_soo,2,Tue Apr 28 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"I came very close to purchasing a pair of 3700s until some family obligations stopped me from spending the money.  Still want a pair of 3900s but I would be using it with serato rather than using them with CDs/usb.  The biggest issue I've heard about them if you're coming from turntables is that you can't really slow down track by dragging along the side of the platter due to how the cdjs detects the platter movements.  You're basically expected to use the pitch bend buttons as opposed to the more classic turntable technique of dragging the platter or twisting the spindle.  If you're more of a pitch rider, it shouldn't really matter but if you're used to correcting with the platter, the. It could be an issue."

Make sure you have the correct setting for your input (line/phono), and that traktor mode is turned off... it should default to off if you aren't plugged into a computer, but its been a while since I've used mine with vinyl.  Here's a short vid after a youtube search: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsDoBDgHiLE  Effects are only through traktor, there are no effects units on the mixer itself, but you can still use the filters.  It's not for everyone, I use the z2 90% of the time in Traktor mode, the other 10% is mixing drum and bass, for which I only need the filters.

Beatmatch,341lae,crossedx,9,Mon Apr 27 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"You can make vinyl loop, but that's usually done with circle stickers. You put the sticker exactly where you want the needle to skip to... It takes some work get get the loop right. Normally though, it's sort of like a cue point. You put the needle close to the sticker, move the record and the sticker skips the needle to your spot.   When you see the stickers in the middle of the record, like by the label, it's just to mark a spot on the record."

Beatmatch,341lae,lshaped210,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"The circle stickers are also often used to quickly jump to a cue point, so you can just drop your needle and the sticker will automatically push the needle to the right groove where your cue point is. This is much quicker than cueing the record in your headphones to find the right spot. This is not only a visual marker on the record, but also helps with needle dropping."
Beatmatch,341lae,dj_soo,4,Mon Apr 27 20:53:50 2015 UTC,Note that DVS users nowadays may still benefit from doing this with their timecode records. Obviously the start of the track will vary from song to song but just having something on the label that sticks out and is consistent (especially if you're in absolute mode) definitely comes in handy.
Beatmatch,341lae,lshaped210,4,Mon Apr 27 16:32:49 2015 UTC,Serato has a feature called sticker sync which makes the track always start where the sticker is.

Beatmatch,33yr57,ghostCatalyst,10,Sun Apr 26 22:24:56 2015 UTC,"READ YOUR CROWD. Take risks to see what works or not.   I'd like to expand a bit on this... There is a difference between watching the crowd and reading the crowd. ""Play X, observe that X is clearing the dancefloor, don't play stuff like X"" is watching the crowd and reacting but reading is something beyond that... It involves the above but a lot more... it's less about reacting and more about just knowing.  Reading the crowd includes but isn't limited to:   Noting the demographics of the crowd like age... If your crowd is primarily 21 that throwback track in your back pocket from 1997 was popular when they were in diapers... maybe something from ~2009 would be better. Watching the intoxication level of the crowd... Certain types of songs work better the drunker the crowd is. PSY - Gangnam Style for example... Paying attention not only to if people are dancing but how... There is a difference between people just moving around on the dancefloor because their friends are and people lost in the music and having an amazing time. Gauge the mood of the room and understand how music affects it... The music can have a huge effect on the mood of people... Are they happy, feeling sexy, feeling aggressive? Sure, alcohol and their actual personalities play a huge role but so does the music. Listen to something like Ludacris - Act a Fool and then something like Dirty Old Ann - Turn Me On... They make you feel different, they do the same thing to the whole venue.    And that's just the surface of it... There are so many other little things... Are people leaving the dancefloor because of the song or because they're danced out and need water? Are the majority of the requests you're getting (if you take requests) stylistically similar to what you're playing or completely different? Are the people who aren't dancing still having a good time or do they look unhappy? etc etc etc.  Yes, it's good to take risks but you'll get to a point where even the risks are calculated and have decent odds of success because you'll actually be reading the room premtively and your actions will be informed by the crowd beforehand not as an after the fact reaction.   You will always have songs that will clear the floor or have a bigger effect than you expected because you can't predict everything but as time goes on you'll be a lot more in tune with and connected to the crowd... or at least you should be."

I've always been in love with harmonic mixing, but I'm trying to pull off more elaborate transitions that overlap pretty long; do they work? I'm not sure if I'm relying on delay/reverb effects too much.  EDIT: for instance, I'm pretty iffy on the transition to Reivindicacion at 10:50.  EDIT 2: Also, feedback on the EQ'ing during transitions. I feel like when I pull the low frequencies out of a track during a transition, too much of the low end is dropping out... Am I crazy? Example: the transition after Reivindicacion, at 14:35.  b) whether or not the eclectic mix of styles in this mix works. I like too many kinds of music to restrict the breadth of styles in my mixes, it seems...  Thanks in advance!"
Beatmatch,3400kn,boenner,3,Mon Apr 27 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"I really like this mix of styles! It's something special about your taste and this gives you recognition value.  I also liked most of the transitions, but sometimes it felt like the lows were missing too long. When the bass isn't missing naturally (build ups etc.) just let lows on A in longer and pull them out just one or two bars before B drops. This way you don't loose that much energy."
Beatmatch,3400kn,say_whattt_now,2,Mon Apr 27 06:51:58 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear on the style part! It always seems like a lot of DJs get into a rhythm of playing the same general genres over time, but I seem to wander to different styles every several months so it's something always in the back of my mind haha.

Maybe I'd say if you wanted the mix to be more fluid you could not pull the lows of the old songs that much (I did notice it at 14:35), but I can't tell you if that's what you want it to sound like because maybe your prefer that way of EQing with that type of music."

Some thoughts as I was listening through it: second transition is a little quick, but keeps the energy nicely. There is a  bit of a volume jump up at the 5.50 mark, try and keep the gain similar throughout! The phrasing is a little awkward around the 8.50 point (first track is sufficiently quieted but the second isn't quite there yet to pick up the listeners attention) and then the gain of the next track seems a little low. From Si Senor onwards, the mix steps up and the transitions from there are all really solid. I really enjoyed the transition from 23 minutes onwards!   Track selection wise, I enjoyed the techno / disco esque feel to the tracks. It feels like a mix you'd listen to, not dance to, but then that's just my opinion - I don't listen to a lot of disco.

Tracks 4&5 seemed a bit forced possibly key was off. 303 into thirts was a solid mix. Excellent seamless transition. Thumbs up. Same goes into community funk which is one my all time fave tunes. I felt you found your stride from 303 on. The phrasing 8-9 was a little wonky but not offensive. The shiba San track was a good call at that moment. Tho the phrasing seemed a bit weird to me also from 9-10. Pinball is a tough tune, gotta get that. Overall I enjoy your track selection. You take risks that enjoy. A bit before the 44min mark you had an awkward volume drop which eventually became an energy killing transition in 10-11. A dip in energy can be well timed when it's with purpose and well executed. The end (last 15 mins) was a bit awkward to me. Could just be differences in style, if so ignore. Nonetheless overall I enjoyed myself and I'm looking forward to you next mix."

Oh man, the Xponent makes me nostalgic... haha  While the use of reverb and stuff sounded more or less clean I think you were trying to spice up each track way too much. Just let the original song play—flourishes like using filtering, reverb, delay, etc. stylistically is nice, but save it occasionally—too much and it gets old. Instead, focus more on mixing the next song properly and increasing the pace of your mix—the first song, for instance, was already sounding old to me by the time you brought the next one in.  Your mixing between songs were definitely off in timing; I think you need to practice your beatmatching more. It looks like you're using autosyncing, which is fine by me—if you are, I'd suggest you listen to the songs before bringing the master level up on the channel. Set the master/cue split to 50/50 each through your headphones, and make sure the beat matches up properly. If it doesn't sound right, then you can often on the fly (but preferably not on the fly) click on the ""GRID"" section of each track and use Traktor's ""Tap"" functionality to set the beat properly—just listen to the song and tap whenever you hear a beat. Traktor will generally realign it's beatgrid to fit the song properly. And if you're not... well, you have a bunch of practicing ahead of you!  Another thing is that the songs you selected one after the other didn't really mesh with one another—the first to the second song were just totally different style and they didn't really seem to work together. It's fine to play them in the same mix, but work on really knowing your library and finding paths between songs that bridge the styles of the tracks less harshly.  Hope that all helps!"

Things like reggaeton moves in cycles of 16 or 32 beats, so you gotta do some fast mixing or something more slammed mixing kind of thing (if you are not gonna use loops or that stuff). One last resort is dropping the real intro intro a less busy part of the outgoing song.  Anyway is kinda hard to explain with just words."

OKAY feels a little out of place with the current vibe though.  wow. SWEET remix of technologic. I think you could have left (the outro or whatever that sound was) OKAY in a little longer as you were transitioning, maybe loop it while the percussion line goes from Technologic during that first build. would have sounded pretty sick.   cut the outgoing track as soon as the piano hits from the Florence track.   Last transition didn't really work for me, since I was still feeling Back Once Again. the bass cut on the chorus/drop took me out of my vibe. I think a quick cut would have worked better.   My apologies if I come off as too harsh, Im only trying to be constructive. Overall, I really like your track selection (I'm taking a lot of these for my own mixes :P). You have good taste, for whatever that's worth. what stood out most was cutting the low EQs during the choruses/drops/kick lines (Whatever they're called). should let those ride out or just not play the second chorus and instead go to the new track. Try looping a vocal portion or a catchy part of the bassline/melody and transition with that. so, needs a little work with phrasing and a general sense of when to move on (and not move on), but overall I liked it! good job."

I decided only about a month ago to DJ! XD I've produced three 30-minute mixes during my first month in Ableton and would greatly appreciate any feedback! I must stress: these are arranged mixes laid out in Arrangement mode and NOT performed in real time! I treat these mixes as an exercise in elementary mixing theory for a beginner. When I first fired up Ableton about a month ago, I knew absolutely NOTHING about mixing or DJing! Even figuring out basic techniques like filter sweeps, stutter edits, breaks with sound effects, etc. in Arrangement mode gets me giddy with excitement every time! XD  I chose Ableton as my platform due to two years of prior experience sequencing and arranging in Propellerheads Reason as well as sporadic experience in various other DAWs such as SONAR, Pro Tools, and Logic through an amateur recording/production background. Coming in cold to the craft of mixing/DJing, my familiarity of the digital realm made Ableton the obvious choice (not that there aren't downsides to that choice!) But I also grew up as a church sound-guy, living in the mixing booth for nearly a decade, so don't worry, my love of analog is forever! ;)  My most immediate goals are two-fold:   Ramp up to a 30-minute mix a week. This will force me to really stay on top of things and not procrastinate, to constantly listen to new (and old!) material to expand my (tiny) library, and will hopefully form a solid theoretical foundation. On a more personal note, it also really gets my creative juices flowing! I haven't touched music software in years due to personal struggles. Arranging mixes in Ableton brings me right back to all the fun I had arranging songs in Reason, and it's a really good feeling! :) Acquire controllers & a low-latency interface and start learning & practicing live mixing! :)   Thanks for your time! <3  Edit: Track list is in the SoundCloud description, but here it is for redundancy!

I like the layering of the buildups. Nice clean quick cuts to the drop. Turbulence is such a guilty pleasure of mine. Really like the breakdown @11:35, good release of the energy to rebuild. I hear a little fiddling with the gainstaging at ~16:00, no biggy though.   Overall, pretty solid stuff! Really I'm just nitpicking at this point: my only criticism would be to vary the drops, since the bigroom stuff gets repetitive (or it could be me just being a snob). Maybe throw in an extended ambient breakdown of a track, or some melodic electro house, to mix it up?"

Beatmatch,33yi2e,BLAK_ICE23,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"In my case, the jog wheels were not working in addition to some of the buttons triggering the wrong functions. Basically, when I would try to scratch with either of the two jog wheels the track would just move slow. As soon as I had one hand on either of the jog wheels and my other hand on any metal part of the controller, I was able to scratch. I'm honestly not sure what caused it.   Side note: If you're just having trouble with the buttons, I would download a MIDI monitor to see what values you're getting. For me , several buttons were triggering the same MIDI values which is obviously not how it's supposed to work."

Beatmatch,33yl1b,ouch_myfinger,2,Sun Apr 26 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you're talking about.  Does a bar have its own gear?  Maybe, but don't count on it.  Do clubs have their own gear, yes.  Not controllers though, CDJ 2000 is the industry standard. Beggar's can't be choosers. Your best hope of getting a gig is to reach out to promoters. Larger clubs will have dedicated bookers/event promoters, smaller clubs often rely on different promoters for individual events. You'll want to show the promoter a mix that you've made of the kind of music you plan to play. In my experience promoters don't typically care how you made your mix. But if they hire you you best be prepared to play on whatever setup they offer you (likely CDJ 2000 as mentioned). It's unlikely that they'll be willing to cater to a wonky DJ setup for what is likely an early/short slot in the evening. So my advice? Yes, do get yourself out there! But be prepared to figure out a way to learn CDJs. Perhaps you can befriend someone who has a setup that will let you practice?"
Beatmatch,33yl1b,TranscodedMusic,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"Also, there might be music/audio equipment/DJ equipment stores that have demo gear that you can practice on. /u/ouch_myfinger, see if there's a Guitar Center in your area."
Beatmatch,33yl1b,marymelodic,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question, it depends. Some venues do have in-house equipment that they will allow you to use, but personally, I'm much more comfortable with my personal equipment that I've practiced and performed on, and I'll pretty much always bring it with me to every gig. You can ask your client when you're discussing the gig what in-house equipment they have available for you to use (if any at all).  Secondly, realistically speaking, you shouldn't need to worry too much about getting a higher quality controller until you start making money that you can spend on it. Your M-Audio Oxygen-25 should be perfect for any first gig you come across. On my first gig, I used a Numark Mixtrack and a free mixing software ""Mixxx"" to perform. It was a very laid back house party, and allowed me to experiment and get a taste of how it feels to read and handle a crowd. So, to answer your question, yes, you have enough equipment to take on a DJ gig. Just make sure that you have:  A) access to speakers large enough for the numbers you'll be performing for, and  B) enough music to last the gig and variety of music to accomodate for your whole crowd's needs.  Finding gigs, in my experience, is easiest when you get the word out to your friends and family. Tell them that you're looking for a paid DJ gig, and that if they know anyone who is in need of your services, have them contact you. I'm sure you'll find your first gig shortly. Everyone needs a DJ. ;)  Good luck on your future endeavors!"
Beatmatch,33yl1b,Dauntless_Official,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:15:43 2015 UTC,You can also meet other DJ's. Help them bring in equipment. Build relationships with them. They will eventually give you a chance to open/close for them so practice and be ready.   Network with DJ's and be genuine.

Beatmatch,33xf8b,NoobPwnr,3,Sun Apr 26 15:49:51 2015 UTC,Both are overkill. That beeing said they both/all get the job done easily. If you switch to mixing in the box you won't even need another interface.
Beatmatch,33xf8b,tilldrop,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  By mixing in the box, do you mean mixing in Traktor?   I figure I'd need a controller to do that, which I'm yet to delve into."
Beatmatch,33xf8b,tilldrop,2,Mon Apr 27 17:14:03 2015 UTC,The Xone 92 can serve as a controller for Traktor. You'll just have to use the MIDI out. The 900s can even be used with HID. You don't need another controller for sure ;-)
Beatmatch,33xf8b,tilldrop,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"Ah interesting, thanks!  I actually set up my CDJ's in HID the other day and downloaded a demo of Traktor. All the sudden I feel so futuristic.  It seems the Audio-6 or Audio-8 would be a better choice then, seeing that it has MIDI where the Scarlett doesn't.  Would/could I still run the audio through the 92? I figure it's not needed since all the audio is already in Traktor, however I got the 92 for the warmth of the analog. Just curious if it's worth running the audio through the 92 before the Audio?. As opposed to just hooking the CDJ's up to the Audio-8, if that makes sense.  Thanks for any guidance."
Beatmatch,33xf8b,tilldrop,2,Mon Apr 27 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"You won't need any additional hardware if you want to use Traktor and only listen to it yourself - no matter if you prefer to mix in the Xone or in Traktor. If you like the analog way than you will hook up the 900's via USB and use their audio interfaces as digital/analog converters. So the digital signal from Traktor goes into the 900s and than to the outputs of the CDJs. Than you can hook those up to the mixer the traditional way since you now have an analog signal via chinch.  Now you got two sources into the xone where you can do your mixing. The last part would be the output from your xone. This is what you will want to record. So all you need to do that is an interface with two mono (equals one stereo) inputs. I'm not too sure of how the Traktor interfaces work, but I'd guess that they will give you controll over the inputs as well so that you can record with those. The 2i4 is a studio interface with different purposes than the Traktor interfaces. This one is specifically made for recording so it will definitly be able to record your sessions. However even something like this will do the job and is significantly cheaper: http://www.amazon.de/Behringer-U-Control-UCA222-Interface-Soundkarte/dp/B0023BYDHK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430166114&sr=8-1&keywords=behringer+audio+interface I don't know about the noise floor however. The noisefloor is the ""amount of noise"" added to the signal by the extra gear. So it might have a lesser quality. However since it's all line levels I wouldn't exspect that to be a real issue for your needs."
Beatmatch,33xf8b,goudewup,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for spelling this out, that all makes sense!  And where would MIDI come into play if I wanted to go that route?   It seems that would be a lot of USB cables - two to the CDJs for HID, and one to the Audio-8 for recording and for MIDI control."
Beatmatch,33xjco,asicsgellyteiii,3,Sun Apr 26 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"Practice beat matching by ear, and don't rely on the BPM counter. It will help you in the long run. As far as your question goes, I'm pretty sure it will be the same as the 400's but I'm not sure."
Beatmatch,33xjco,Kbeck94,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:11:15 2015 UTC,I think the 400 still had a tap counter to get you the general idea. That should get you close enough to match by ear.

If it's an sl4, just plug into the 2nd usb, get the other dj to disengage the source decks in his software and engage it in yours and start mixing.  If it's the club's install and not an sl4, then it should be powered by an external ac adaptor (check to make sure).    If that's the case plug in your usb, get the dj to set it to ""thru"" on serato or whatever the equivalent on Traktor (although chances are if the dj uses traktor, it's not going to be an installed soundcard).  And mix in via usb and then unplug his laptop, plug yours in if you're using it and start mixing.

If you have a track of only kick drum and a track of only snare, you can easily differentiate. This means it is more obvious which one is speeding up or down as there is the distinct sound difference.  Next Step  Buy studio monitors or at least a little subwoofer  Once you have the (rough) hang of beatmatching with distinct sounds, you will find it easier to practice on real songs. I started off on awful speakers with no bass, it not only made beatmatching harder as the main beat wasn't reproduced, but it made things like accurate EQing impossible when I recorded mixes.  Then  Realise that with much dance music, there is conformity. If you see a bpm reading on your software, use it. Track 1 is 128 bpm and so is track 2? Cool! Lets say you mix 128bpm into a playing 127bpm track, you know you don't need to move the fader far, use this information.  more tips  A good trick is to practice beatmatching and once you have it, let the song play, if it slips out of time, try adjusting it manually (remember the screen is right there if you have an issue).  The other trick is my favourite. Get a song on youtube/off a cd player and play it. Then use your software to mix another song into it. As the first song is not in software, you need to do it by feel.  I always refer to the screen when I play gigs, I try and engage the audience as much as possible but why shouldn't I check to make sure I'm not ruining the show. I only ever use sync for two reasons:   When I'm playing sample loops in sync over the track When I'm mixing two songs together and want to change the tempo while they are both still playing (sync means they both change equally from the control of one pitch fader)   The main thing is though, practice, if it goes wrong at home, great! You now have reason to DJ for a few more hours.   If it goes wrong in a club, just hit sync or look at the screen!"
Beatmatch,33suyh,tomjarvis,3,Sat Apr 25 13:25:01 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds basic but get used to counting four sets of four all the time. Whenever you're in Top Shop waiting for your Mrs, count four sets of four against the awful muzak they have playing.  Get into expecting the drops at the end of each set of 16 you've counted. Find two completely obvious tracks, techno or tech house I would suggest as they are often sparse enough but tightly produced enough to give you a clear mix. Focus on the beats first then tweak the track  forward or back slightly until you're happy.  The magic moment happened for me on a set of Numarks in 1998. I picked up VDJ two years ago and was stunned I could still do it on a PC 15 years later..."
Beatmatch,33suyh,F_A_F,6,Sat Apr 25 08:51:58 2015 UTC,"Sync is the devil. Load up the same track on both decks, loop one and practice matching the incoming track to the loop. They'll be the same tempo but this is the best way for you to practice timing and phasing. Once you feel comfortable with doing that you can do the same thing, but randomly move the tempo slider on the looped deck and practice beatmatching with the same track at a random tempo. Be strict and don't allow yourself to rely on visual cues.   Beatmatching isn't difficult, but you rely on your ears a lot for it. Mixing with your ears is a completely different workflow to using sync or matching up waveforms, so allow yourself some time to get used to doing things differently."
Beatmatch,33suyh,anjunarmada,3,Sat Apr 25 08:28:53 2015 UTC,"This is good advice except for the ""same track"" part. One of the fundamental things with beat matching by ear is learning to distinguish each discreet track in your head and determining which is faster/slower to make adjustments. Using the same track makes this more difficult as there isn't distinct sounds to help establish the different tracks. Using two different minimal house tracks using your technique would be ideal as there aren't extra sounds to get in the way but the drums will be different enough to distinguish the individual tracks."
Beatmatch,33suyh,PoopyButt_Childish,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"Changing up the tracks is definitely something to move towards, but I find using the same songs off the bat keeps as many variables as possible controlled and just focusses on the skills of phasing and phrasing. It's all about getting familiar with what it sounds like when it sound right, and understanding how much or how little to nudge a track when OP hears it's off certain amount. When I taught a friend to do it, I got him to mix the same song into itself after he was comfortable to help him understand the thought behind choosing a spot to mix out and into. Having the concept ""click"" in the simplest form will help out OP best before variables are changed imo."
Beatmatch,33suyh,anjunarmada,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, my point is just that while keeping the beats simple, some variation in the sounds help to know which track is which. One of the things I remember about learning to beat match (which I barely remember it's been so long now) was trying to separate the tracks in my head. When you first start, it can be difficult to know which is the master and which is the cue. Two separate SIMPLE tracks can help with this."
Beatmatch,33suyh,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Sat Apr 25 16:35:49 2015 UTC,Learning the majority of musical instrument is a journey of uphill battles and plateaus.  Use the pitch fader heavily and try not to touch the platter much when you're practicing the technique that /u/anjunarmada suggested. Start with the track you're ozone at a slightly slower tempo to get it out of sync then increase it slowly until let it catch back up until it syncs up.
Beatmatch,33suyh,emtheory09,2,Sat Apr 25 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"It took me a year or so to learn beatmatching, and I was on a pair of belt drive turntables. Soon I had 16 beats held, then 32, 64, and so on.   It just takes time and patience. Plus your ears will be trained to pick apart the music to focus on the rhythms. Keep at it.   I use sync now, and am not afraid to admit it, but I'll confess that sync fails me many times and I'll go back to manual. It's nice to have options, and I think any DJ should have this ability."
Beatmatch,33suyh,D-Jam,2,Sat Apr 25 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"man ive been trying for 10 months, and I still get it wrong way too much.  Once you think theyre in beat, just let them both play out for a while. Instead of constantly nudging the pitch fader let them play - the longer you let them play out the more noticeable the drifts become and you can correct accordingly. Of course do this in headphones before you mix it in!"

Beatmatch,33suyh,krazyhonkey,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"Good morning, im having coffee just now.  You're talking about nailing the most fundamental skill of DJing and for most people it will take a while.  With regard to beatmatching your tracks, look at the BPM of each track as someone else mentioned. If you're mixing 127/128bpm tracks together, this will require you to nudge the CDJ platter less than mixing 122/128 together. The greater the difference between them the more beat matching you need to do as well as making the 2 tracks more likely to go out of time once you've matched them.  That's basic stuff which you probably already know but that's not why I stopped by, here's my personal story for you. Some people with probably find it laughable but it's honest.  It took me about 18months from when I first started DJing to make any REAL progress. Sure, most people could tell you two records are out of time but we as DJs need to do more than this. After about 18 months, I was DJing one night at home, just messing around as you do when it suddenly hit me. Everything about what I was doing was perfect...my monitors, my mixer levels, my track selection, my timing etc....it was all perfect, but what does that mean??  It was as clear as day, I could hear both kick drums on each track lined up perfectly and that was when it finally ""clicked."" I finally knew what I was looking for, what kind of ""sound"" I needed to listen for in future so that I could tell whether 2 tracks were matched or not.  This unfortunately did not catapult me to the top of the Beatport Top 100 as I had hoped but for me personally, it was a massive landmark in teaching myself to DJ. I'm not perfect by any means, I still make mistakes like everyone does but after that point, I knew everything I had done was finally coming together.  In short, don't get yourself down about it. Teaching yourself the fundamentals of any hobby is the hardest part and takes time. You will get there and you will do it.  One thing I totally forgot though now I've written my post but how long have you actually been DJing for? What equipment are you using?"
Beatmatch,33suyh,matthabib,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:06:50 2015 UTC,"Not that you are this type...but people these days, with anything (not just DJing), expect instant results. The culture has created a society where everything we want/need is accessible from our phones. If we really wanted, we could order something off amazon in the morning, and then come home to it delivered. Our expectations are so skewed now.  Beatmatching can be tedious and annoying like a golf swing, but you start to ""get it"" more than become ""good at it."" Plus, if you have waveforms to look at, its actually far easier than it every used to be. This is why I suggest practicing on vinyl/DVS if you aren7t already. It really gives you the feel of how to rub/nudge the platter/record. Muscle memory is fucking powerful when put it in motion. Just putting in 15 minutes of beatmatching by ear per session will help immensely."

Beatmatch,33suyh,Psythik,1 point,Sun May 3 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"It's hard, and it takes practice, patience and time. I found the hardest bit splitting your head into two different channels for each track - a bit like the whole 'pat your head and rub your belly' thing. It takes a while but just keep at it and it'll come.   This is how I learned. Line up your first beats when you cue, then try and compare the 16th beats. It'll be a lot easier to do because the mismatch will be exaggerated. Once you get that down, try and do the 8th beat, then the 4th, then the 2nd. Soon it'll be like second nature. Also just get really slick with lining those first beats up, if you're on vinyl you need to learn the natural delay of your turntables and learn to compensate for it. Timing (and a little push) is everything. CDJ/digital is just all about timing, but it's just as important. If they're not lined up perfectly from the beginning you're just fighting an uphill battle, trying to sync the tracks and beatmatch. Make things a lot easier for yourself and attack from both sides.   Another tip (which I never really used but heard some good feedback from) is to learn by trying to mix the same tracks together. I've always used vinyl so it'd mean having to waste money on two of the same record, on CDJ/digital that isn't so much of a problem. Anyway, apparently thus way it's easier to spot the difference between the two tracks. Just don't cheat and look at the BPM/position of the pitch shifter."

Giving the music away via record pools would cut into their bottom line (labels don't receive any money from pools - the monthly fee is for maintenance costs of the website).

Beatmatch,33raza,houseandtechno,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"I think a diagram would have helped here as your setup is a bit confusing.  It actually seems like the K2 is your Traktor audio interface, because you mention you have connected the headphone and main output of the K2 to Inputs A and B of your mixer? So I think your setup is:  K2 > Xone92 > Focusrite 2i4 > Speakers  In this configuration you would need to do aggregation of the K2 and the 2i4 to give you enough outputs. You also have a connection issue with the Monitor speakers as you need to directly connect those to your Xone92 so you can free up outputs 1/2 of the 2i4 as the balanced 1/4"" outputs of the 2i4 share the same output as the RCA outputs 1/2.  It would probably be a lot easier to configure Traktor for Mono outputs and use the 4 existing channels of the K2 for four Mono channels to the Xone92."
Beatmatch,33raza,tmccoy00,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:09:12 2015 UTC,So you're saying I won't be able to connect an X1 because half (1 stereo channel/2mono) is already being used by my balanced 1/4inch outputs to monitors?   Leaving only 1 stereo left when an X1 requires 2 for 2 decks?    Please also explain the last sentence.    You should know that I actually am running two k2's at the moment controlling 4 channels. They are aggregated.   I just wanted to try swapping one k2 with an X1.  However X1 doesn't have a built in soundcard like the k2.    Yes I know I need to get a traitor audio 8 or 10.  But I want to know if the 2i4 is possible to run what I'm asking.
Beatmatch,33raza,tmccoy00,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:06:18 2015 UTC,"No matter what controllers you have you need as many output channels as decks you want to use. As you rightly point out, the X1 does not have an audio interface like the K2 so if you pull one out completely you need to find at least two mono outputs or two stereo outputs.  This relates to my last sentance as a way to streamline your setup with one audio interface and no aggregation. The K2 has two stereo outputs - and thus four mono outputs. So if you split the headphone jack on the K2 into left and right, you could just use four mono channels.  K2 Main Out Left -> Xone92 Input A Left  K2 Main Out Right -> Xone92 Input B Left  K2 Headphone Left -> Xone92 Input C Left  K2 Headphone Right -> Xone92 Input D Left"

I use my balance outputs on my Scarlett 2i4 for my speakers.  But the poster above you has said that Balanced Outputs 1 and 2 use the same slots as Unbalanced RCA outputs 1 and 2 making them in active.  So I would only have 1 stereo (2 mono RCA outputs) available.  I am aware that the X1 is usb based. However, I need to connect 2 stereo outputs from an interface into 2 channels on the Xone 92 in order for me to control 2 decks?

Beatmatch,33raza,Jinnobi,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"Yes you do. I was kinda confused, let's see: If you want to mix with the Xone92 exclusively and use each traktor deck with a different mixer channel, you will need to use separate outs from the sound card into separate channels of the mixer.  That will always work like that regardless what other USB controller you may be using.  You should stop using the K2 soundcard at all and just use the Focusrite as the audio interface for traktor, then directly from the mixer to the speakers."

Beatmatch,33mc8n,submarinefacemelt,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:35:05 2015 UTC,"Check out the Mellow Orange Vinyl Podcasts. Those dudes play a lot of jazzy stuff/funk/soul/hip hop. If you are expected to play jazz that is in the bop era, it's gonna be a challenge to mix any of that.  Some slower straight ahead could work decently.  Since they're asking for soul music, though, the ""jazz"" aspect becomes rather vague, so I'm gonna recommend jazz-funk, it's fucking awesome and much of it was sampled for hip-hop (I see someone posted the j rocc droppin' science mix, check that and also listen to the Blue Note original compilation).    But yeah.  I used to play primarily this style (I collected records before I started playing them out, and it was what I had until I changed my focus towards buying records to dj).  If you're gonna beatmatch, depending on your setup, you're gonna have to ride the pitch like a motherfucker, because metronomes weren't used on those records and God knows there wasn't quantization back then, haha.  4 bar transitions, 8 bars if it's a super solid match.  Use drum breaks to your advantage.  The ""don't mix vocals"" rule applies to horn lines, as that can get messy quickly.  Really though, you have to devise clever transitions, because you're not playing music made for djing.  It's fun, though; certainly keeps you on your toes.  My song recommendation for you is The Crusaders - Stomp and Buck Dance .  Acid jazz is a good start, too; I would really call that genre rare groove, though."

Beatmatch,33mfzm,dj_soo,2,Thu Apr 23 21:56:41 2015 UTC,"it's an older controller and it's not perfect, but for a good quality controller at an affordable price, it's great.  It was around $800 when it first came out and it's definitely missing some controls for modern DJ software as it was originally designed for Serato Itch as opposed to Serato DJ.  Here's a review I wrote a little while back:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1li4lm/vestax_vci380_or_400/cbzi8cg  only thing I think differently is it being worth $700 as that was back when Vestax was still in business."
Beatmatch,33mfzm,dj_soo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:59:41 2015 UTC,Great write up. I suppose it being an older model isn't a huge concern since I could hook up another midi controller to handle the extras. I'll have to see if I can find one to demo since they might be harder to find in store due to age and Vestax going out. Much appreciated.
Beatmatch,33mfzm,Mrtug269,2,Fri Apr 24 11:36:47 2015 UTC,I use mine alongside a Pioneer SP1 and it works fine although there are some annoyances with the software and it's pretty redundant outside of a few controls.    I mainly bought my SP1 to use with my turntable setup tho so I end up using it with my VCI anyway.    Something like an LPD8 or a korg nanokontrol would be plenty.

I've been seeing it selling on Craigslist for as little as $300.  I don't care what anybody says in this thread, if you want to scratch properly with a controller, the only way to do it right is on motorized platters. You simply can't get the proper ""feel"" on jogwheels, especially if you're a beginner."
Beatmatch,33mfzm,Folley,1 point,Sun May 3 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah the main reason I wanted a NS7 when it first released was the motorized platters. I assumed that the resistance from the motor feels much different than jogwheels. The NS7II is really pricey for just wanting to fuck around, but I'll check it out.  Also wanted to ask, can the NS7 work with NS7II software or is it proprietary? I figured if the NS7 was missing extra controls compared to NS7II I could substitute it with another midi controller. Thanks!"
Beatmatch,33mfzm,lemonjalo,1 point,Mon May 4 10:50:47 2015 UTC,"Well the NS7 uses Serato Itch, while the NS7 II uses Serato DJ. Itch is being replaced by DJ, so I believe the NS7 will work in DJ. The way Serato works is that the software is free to download, but will only activate upon recognizing a piece of hardware that has its logo stamped on it (like an NS7 or NS7II). Virtual DJ also supports both controllers, but you have to pay a separate fee to use it.  And yeah, you could always add a generic MIDI controller to replace the NS7's missing features, like the MPC pads (love 'em to death!) and the effects knobs. Only thing you can't replace are the capacitive knobs that activate upon merely touching them, a feature that I believe is unique to the NS7II. Though I suppose if you've never had them, you wouldn't miss them anyway."

Beatmatch,33lj12,Jinnobi,2,Fri Apr 24 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"Reverb Effects, by their nature, add content to the frequency range of the signal, hence making the signal louder. Especially the lower frequency ranges have lots of energy, and massively increase the volume if they get layered with their own ""reverb echos"". The problem also increases with the Size of the Reverb.  The same effect can be heard even better when using a Delay with a high feedback setting, you can practically  hear how the delayed signals are stacked on top of each other multiple times, raising the total volume. A Reverb does pretty much the same thing, but more subtle and the echos are processed.  The solutions to your disposal are twofold:  a) While turning up the Dry/Wet, Turn down the channel gain (or channel fader) to make up for the volume increase of the effect.  b) Remove content from the frequency range of the signal:   Use the First two knows of a Reverb in Single Effect Mode (which are basically a High Pass and Low Pass Filter) to remove some of the higher and lower frequencies. Put a filter in Front of the reverb in Group Effect Mode to do the same.   Especially taking out the lower frequencies can reduce the volume increase, while also makeing the effect sound better, as thebass is not all mushed up and muddy."

Aqua, Eiffel 65, Ace of Base, 2Unlimited, La Bouche, Amber, Boomstang Boys, Vengaboys, N-Trance, Prozzak, Love Inc, UltraNate, etc etc etc... Save the major soundtrack songs like What is Love for when you want the dancefloor to pop off. It will lose all of it's effect if you play it more than once or play it at the wrong time. You might want to mix a remix into the original or vice versa but that's it and let the original shine as much as possible.  The theme of the party screams a certain kind of music, careful with the remixes... I've been to 90s parties where the DJ played all Trap/Electro remixes of 90s hits... That's not why people were there and they weren't happy, they wanted 90s Pop/RnB unadulterated. Electro House is 2000s, and Trap while it originated in the 90s was not a decade defining genre.

It's more of a concern when DJs get booked to play a party/club/whatever by a third-party that has a theme and then disregard that theme when selecting music.  If it's you and your friends then you know best.  I'd still avoid overplaying major bangers though and in this case What is Love is a banger. Super recognisable songs are really obvious when they're played multiple times... There's no ""I think I've heard this already"" it's flat out ""I've heard this already"" and it get tired. I'd use What is Love early to fill the floor and then maybe once more during the peak of the party... Personally I've never liked playing stuff more than once though."

Is there a guy wearing a deadmau5 shirt? Play a deadmau5 song. Did someone request something? Just fucking play it.

Beatmatch,33ekk1,EmileDorkheim,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"Abruptly going from quiet to loud seems like a way to get a bunch of those stony-faced glances from people who were previously enjoying their conversations. I agree that louder music is more likely to get people dancing, but maybe focus on increasing the volume gradually. Although in a bar or club you might not have access to the volume control for the house PA."
Beatmatch,33ekk1,Psythik,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:54:11 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that most clubs would set the PA volume at the desired max for the night, so to gain control all you would have to do is start off your set with your mixer's master output turned down then crank it up once the party gets going."
Beatmatch,33ekk1,bigchipshi,3,Wed Apr 22 09:41:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of party your playing at.  If it's a bar where there isn't a dance floor, dance lighting, an MC, etc... Well then it's going to be next to impossible to get people to dance, simply because it just isn't the venue for it.  Don't try to force it.  In this scenario, the best reaction you can get from the bar patrons is going to be guests nodding and singing along to the music.  This isn't easy to do either, it's actually a very difficult skill set in its own way.  I've seen many successful club Djs try the bar scene and be completely lost.    If it's a mobile gig like a wedding, grad party, birthday, prom, or similar event.  You or somebody else there is going to have to get on the mic and announce to the people that the dance floor is open in some way, shape, or form.  It's great for communicating with your audience and helping them to feel more comfortable around you.  After all, you are the DJ who is in charge of their entertainment for the night, they're going to want to have some type of connection with you.    Lastly, use line dances.  They were made exactly for this reason, to get people dancing on the dance floor.  Obviously each situation is different and no one answer will fit all the unique scenarios you will be faced with.  What is right for one gig, wont be right for another.  It depends on the crowd and you need to pay attention to cues and signals from them."
Beatmatch,33ekk1,Canadian_Government,6,Sun May 3 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"If you're playing house parties or bars or somewhere that isn't about electronic music then its pretty much necessary for you to play some top40 or pop or whatever. Get some acapellas (or just cut the bass on a tune) throw it on a real boppin bassy tune, mix out... Every few tunes just throw something in they'll recognize. get creative if you want.  And subwoofers. Subwoofers make the job a lot easier"
Beatmatch,33ekk1,Jammin27Ben,2,Wed Apr 22 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"I would start with decent songs, and as soon as I would have a handful of people, I would put a hit I know everyone would dance to.   I used to dj mostly top 40/ hip hop, so I would put something from lil Jon or lmfao, something that I knew was popular on the radio and was a ""banger"". It also helped that the bar I was djing for had people that would dig those type of jams."
Beatmatch,33ekk1,golergka,2,Wed Apr 22 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"In party environments, people tend to pick up clues about what they are ""supposed"" to do and follow it. So, generally, just make sure people know that this is a dance party now — drop a tune that is clearly ""dance"" music (having lyrics about dancing helps), turn up the volume. Dance yourself, especially if your booth is located in such a way that people can see you and react to you.  Oh, and make sure that this is indeed a dancing kind of party beforehand. Because at some gigs, you are supposed to be just background music."
Beatmatch,33ekk1,happypillows,2,Wed Apr 22 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"I make it a point to see what people want to hear before I go on. This also gives me a good reason to introduce myself to people and have some conversations, good for social life, good for business.   So as I'm talking to the patrons I'll tell them, ""Alright, I'll drop that song but you owe me a drink if I do"" or something along those lines and when the person knows that you're going to drop they're song at some point, they tend to pay attention. The girls especially will then tell they're friends that I'm playing whatever Chris Brown song they want me to play. When the girls get turnt, the guys follow. Can't go wrong with some Destiny's Child/Beyonce/Nikki to get em going either."
Beatmatch,33ekk1,Didactic_Tomato,2,Wed Apr 22 10:29:24 2015 UTC,"Some relevant pop usually helps a lot. Stuff that gets the ""playful"" dancers out and jumping around, then they call their friends over and everything goes pretty smoothly from there."

Beatmatch,33dbgw,billbar,8,Tue Apr 21 19:59:25 2015 UTC,"Song selection-wise I'd say just go for top 40 type stuff and stuff that everybody can relate to and some house. You'll probably be all over the place with BPM, so don't worry too much about beatmatching and just play tracks after one an other. People aren't there to dance, so you'll more or less be providing background music.  As for specific tracks/artists (many of them are cheesy):   Avicii (you're probably sick and tired of playing his stuff, but you gotta do what you gotta do) Usher - Yeah PSY - Gangnam Style, Gentleman Beyoncé - Pretty much any song, but focus on the hits. Destinys Child works, too. Check out this remix. Jack Ü - Where Are Ü Now Michael Jackson Bloodhound Gang - The Bad Touch Rihanna Ariana Grande Benny Benassi - Satisfaction Skrillex's more popular tracks (Bangarang comes to mind) Zedd Lonely Island   The list could of course be made much, much longer, but that's what I could come up with now."
Beatmatch,33dbgw,marremojj,2,Tue Apr 21 18:10:05 2015 UTC,Yeah most of these kinda came to mind when I coming up with a playlist. I'll probably throw a cheesy one in there every now and then just to get a laugh out of everyone.  But yeah people really aren't there to dance so i guess thats kinda a good perspective to have going into it. Thanks!  Also i never knew Elephante did a remix of Single Ladies!

Beatmatch,33dbgw,Canadian_Government,2,Tue Apr 21 19:17:13 2015 UTC,One thing I'll note is that if you don't mix the tunes at least cut down on the intro/outros when they're long. Practice doing fast cuts to halfway through the intro of the next tune

For things like this I'd be pretty partial to top40 remixes too if you wanna build up the events tempo without people complaining they don't know any of the songs you're playing.  Something like this is quite nice to transition from top40 into some electro or edm for a while.  Other than that I'd say be prepared to take some requests and keep your mixing pretty vanilla, just transition smoothly and don't try anything too crazy if you've gotten a bit rusty.  As for songs, being in college myself I'd stick to your standard artists like Oliver Heldens, Martin Garrix, R3hab, Don Diablo, Calvin Harris, Dimitri Vegas, Duke Dumont just for a few examples. And if you wanna stick to top40 then you already know where to look.  Hope I helped!"

Beatmatch,33fny6,YoungHef,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:05:03 2015 UTC,"One of the limitations of ASIO is that is terrible at supporting multiple sources to the same target DAC. I too have a 2i2 and use Ableton and pair it with traktor as well.   Sounds like all is well with Ableton and Traktor. We're just having issues with AISO & the 2i2.   Try eliminating all active audio drivers and pathways, elimainate all your virtual audio connections too, and start anew. Reconnect everything starting with the DAC backwards, e.g. establish the connection from Ableton to Scarlet 2i2 first and so on. If you're not able to at least reconnect the DAW-DAC connection, there is tons of assistance out there for Ableton & 2i2 trouble shooting 'cause they're likely the worlds most popular DAW & DAC combo.

From there, I can record on Audacity (mono) with Microsoft Mapper input as the mic/input setting. That being said, the audio quality has left a lot to be desired.

I'm not a 'pro' but I would certainly take some cues from ""How To DJ Right""  One thing that I do go over when I start teaching DJing is a brief overview of the history of DJing and why DJing exists. It serves as a good motivation towards DJing and the people I teach really appreciate the history overview I give.  Some ideas to bounce around is different forms of DJing if possible. Show off turntablism, DVS, controllers, CDJs, Ableton live performances."

The first hours into DJing all I do is make them focus on beatmatching with their ears, breaks has been the best to teach with it seems. Start with something that is the same tempo then move forward from there until they can hear it. The first couple of hours is rough but after that people start getting the idea of it and start getting better.   To me its important to start on turntables, not because I think that people should only DJ on turntables, just because honestly if you can DJ on turntables, you can use damn near anything.   Try to emphasize how important it is to search for music, not just grab whatever is easily available. I spend hours a week searching for  music on top of a full time job and quite a few shows on top of that. It's not hard to find 30-60 minutes a day to look for good tracks.   Just get them started the right way, make sure they enjoy it and teach them to use their ears from the beginning, after that let them explore and develop their own methods, dont be afraid to tell them if it sounds bad, just do it in a nice way and tell them how to make it sound better.   If you do want some more in depth tips im actually in the process of showing some people how to do it now, I can start writing down what im doing and sharing it with you."

If you need longer than 10 ft cables, stick with XLR.  Just note, it's not that you shouldn't be using studio monitors for DJing - it's just that if you're only DJing and not producing, it's not really necessary and you can get by with a cheaper alternative.

Beatmatch,338ju6,AL_DENTE_AS_FUCK,2,Tue Apr 21 09:14:51 2015 UTC,I'm currently stuck in the soul-sucking phase. Got any advice?
Beatmatch,338ju6,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"A good way to practice is to start track A through the speakers, cue up track B on that first bass beat, then go 'cradling"" the beat of track B to the beat of track A, so moving it back and forth over that first bass beat and then let it go right on beat. Do that ALOT to dedicate it to muscle memory.  Once you can do that 10/10 without messing up, move on to determining which of those 2 beats that now play in sync(normally will only be in sync for a moment so listen closely)starts to drift away from the other and make corrections with the side of the platter to slow down track b or spindle/pushing the record at the label to speed it up. Adjust accordingly with the pitch.  If that seems confusing then one thing that helped me as. I was on my way out of the soul sucking phase was this: if A is playing over the main and you're cueing track b, make track b obviously faster than track a, then go ahead and cradle the beat, 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4 and let it go, now obviously b is gunna drift ""forward"" so you already know you need to slow it down so using the fat of the finger,gradually start to slow down  b on the side the platter till it's on beat with A, all the time adjusting the pitch as you go gradually.   I hoe this helps man, I'm in no way an expert as you've gleaned but these simple principles have helped me loads, hope they help you too."

Beatmatch,33av7n,nowenknows,2,Tue Apr 21 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"Slip Mode does exactly what you want. Don't know about your controller but my NS7 II has a button for it. When it's on, you can manipulate the song any way you'd like (including loops) and the track will continue on at the same position it would be had you not touched anything.   So yeah, Serato definitely supports it but unless your controller has the function built-in the only other way to access it is to buy a generic MIDI controller that doesn't have a Serato logo on it and map Slip Mode to a button on it. For some stupid reason you can't remap Serato-approved products in Serato, but from what I understand you can with a MIDI controller that doesn't have their stamp of approval. Makes zero fucking sense but it is what it is."

Beatmatch,339u5f,indiejellyfish,3,Mon Apr 20 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Ns6 is better built but older and lacking in some modern features and controls.  If you want to get the most out of serato dj, you're going to want an add on controller like an sp1 or a reloop neon.  Another advantage of the ns6 is that it can function as a proper mixer so you can plug in turntables or cdjs - no DVS support tho.  The nv, is more modern but feels more plasticy.  The screens are a nice touch, but aren't really necessary.  If I had a choice, I'd go with the ns6 simply for build quality, but I already have the sp1.  The nv is smaller tho ad more portable.  The dude at the store was probably trying to sell you the nv because it's newer and they get more profit since the ns6 is old and discontinued and therefore marked down.  Never trust guitar centre staff - they are for the most part minimum wage employees told to push certain product in order to maximize profit and aren't really experts in audio gear.  You should be able to get the ns6 for less than $500.  Why not the sr?"
Beatmatch,339u5f,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:04:46 2015 UTC,"The SR just seems to be only a pioneer product, nothing else. Solid build quality, but no special features, whereas the NS6 and NV each have their own handful of features.   And although being able to function as a mixer is nice, it's most likely not something I will be using.   So what you would say (I think I got this out of your message) is that the NV is going to have more features (not by a lot) but the NS6 is going to be more solidly built?"
Beatmatch,339u5f,dj_soo,2,Mon Apr 20 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"what special features do you need?  The SR is designed from the ground up to function with Serato DJ and by all accounts, it's a solidly built controller that does just about everything you'd need.  The big disadvantage of the SR is it's only 2 channels compared to the 4 channels of the NS6 and NV.  It is also lacking in XLR outputs like the NS6 and NV which isn't a huge deal, but that's more money spent on some adaptors if you're going to be plugging directly into a PA.  The NS6 is much better built than the NV (all metal vs plastic).  It's just that the NS6 was designed for Serato Itch and not DJ so you'll be lacking in native controls for some of the newer Serato DJ features.  Mainly the ubiquitous 16 pads that control everything from all 8 cue points to slicer mode, the SDJ-centred FX controls, and dedicated Flip controls.  This can be rectified by purchasing an add-on controller (or using an ipad and the Serato Remote app) although only officially licensed controllers will allow you to use certain features like Slicer.  That, of course will add cost to your budget.  The NV is pretty cheaply made and plasticy and the big features it has over the Pioneer SR is dedicated Serato Flip controls (which aren't really necessary imo), and the screens.  The screens are cool, but it's really more of a gimmick imo that isn't required.  The biggest advantage for me with the screens is I'd have a turntable position marker for scratching on the controller which the NS6 and SR don't have (although I'd prefer lights on the platter itself like the VCI-380, or DDJ SZ).  I'd also worry about the screens breaking in transport as they seem a little delicate.  I've never used one tho and am going by most reviews so if it feels solid to you, it might be enough.  As mentioned, you should be able to haggle down the NS6 so you should save a bit of cash that can go to an addon controller."

Beatmatch,339u5f,dj_soo,2,Tue Apr 21 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"Do you gig much now?  Are you intending to?  The concern about the nv is that it's not proven in the field as much as the ns6 and the screens are relatively new tech in dj controllers. Considering the overall low cost of the nv for a unit that includes things like screens, corners must have been cut in some areas (cdjs have screens that are well made, but those cost $1000+ each).  If you do plan on taking it to gigs, I would suggest a good flight case or reinforced bag to protect it in transport.  For me, long lasting gear is a must so based on construction materials and feel, I'd choose the ns6.  If you're still working mainly at home and not really doing gigs multiple times a week, it might be fine."
Beatmatch,339u5f,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:41:58 2015 UTC,"A case is definitely something I will have to consider, but right now I am in High School, so DJing clubs (sadly) is out of the question.

The earlier, the better! You want to have as much time as possible on your hands to get familiar with the tracks, to learn how and when to mix in and mix out of them, and how to structure the list to give the night the best possible flow.  Try and get as much practice in as possible before the event, beatmatching and phrasing you can practice at home, but controlling the flow of the night was something I learned the hard way over the course of my first few gigs. Give yourself an hour everyday in the fortnight before the event and you'll (hopefully) rack up enough experience to be prepared whatever the night throws at you.  Oh, and if you get stuck for music selection, try picking up one of those ""NOW That's What I Call Music"" compilations.

I used to mix duplicates when I was first learning how to beatmatch and it totally helped me cultivate a better ear for beatmatching. I know lots of people who learned to beatmatch this way. It totally helps. Then, when you are somewhat comfortable matching beats, try moving the pitch bar randomly (or have a friend do it for you) when you have the beats locked so that they fall out of sync on purpose and then try and fix it ASAP. It's a good exercise that will help train your ears and help you learn to stay on your toes while you are in the mix."

For one, the beatmatching isn't always on point, but this improves over time and is nothing to be too worried about. Your song volumes were kind of off - some songs you bring in too quietly and it creates a very sudden transition (Booty Bump -> Work It), others too loud (Calabria -> Make A Move). About the last one, you switched basses too early, I usually let the incoming song ride for a bit with no bass and then either at a breakdown or other suitable place bring in the bass. Some songs come in too early (Ass Hypnotized -> Booty Bounce) and with this transition you also switched the basses too early. The energy in the drop is really high and by taking away the bass you minimize the energy, also the vocals lose any depth they have.   Keep a look out for clashing vocals, generally it doesn't sound good, you had a couple places like that. The mix could also benefit from more use of effects and/or loops, it would make for example the electro house part a bit more interesting, as the songs are very similar in nature.   I really liked the track selection and the way you switch between genres. Keeps the mix fresh. The mix was also really nicely energetic and could easily keep a dance floor going.

I spent a lot of time doing re-edits of the original tunes by juggling and scratching and juggling different parts of the song to make (more or less) new tunes.  This mix is the most scratching I've done on a mix with beats and word cuts I've done, so really curious how it sounds to everyone.

(43 Minute Mix)  https://www.mixcloud.com/djvelox/mix-5-20415/  Sitting at home and thought why not get a mix going? Went a bit crazy with the transitions as that was something I really wanted to focus on this time round.

Beatmatch,337okz,lexx_koto,2,Tue Apr 21 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"I liked your selection of songs. There are just two transitions I have feedback on. This is constructive feedback, so please don't take it the wrong way.  The transition between Lost You and Get Down: the two were running over each other for an entire chorus of Lost You, and because they were both playing full-strength, it sounded a little bit muddled.  I would've gently brought in Get Down with a slight high-pass filter. then transitioned it over during that chorus. By the last bit of the chorus, I would've had the crossfader 70% of the way across (towards Get Down), with a slight high-pass filter on Lost You. Then, I would've moved the crossfader to about 85% for the backspin, and cut it out entirely when the real beat of Get Down kicks in.  The transition into My Head Is A Jungle was quite rough. The verse of MHIAJ kicked in while Man Hands was still building up, and there were vocals laid over vocals. Just before your transition, there was a bit of Man Hands that was just a steady beat the vocals going ""yeah"" and ""ooh"" every eight beats. I would've looped 16 beats of that, and brought in MHIAJ's ""I'm complicated you won't get me out of trouble"" over that. When MHIAJ's beat kicked in, I would've cut Man Hands out.  Also, the high-band of the EQ on My Head Is A Jungle was too low when you brought it in."

They did seem a bit forced and I heard key clashing at points, but honestly not too much train wrecking. Did you use sync?  As far as the transition to Strangers, it's a great song and I love Seven Lions. Lots of his songs are really good but imo aren't easy to transition into in a typical fashion because of the way they are produced. With that said, I don't think the transition was bad at all.

Beatmatch,332dsq,thenewnum2,2,Sat Apr 18 21:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yes active speakers have their own built in amplifiers, its as simple as giving them power and a signal.   Also if your speakers are blown you would definitely know about it when trying to use them, riding the gains is a bad idea eventually you are going to run out of headroom, also that must sound real bad .."
Beatmatch,332dsq,Con1750,2,Sat Apr 18 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yes most powered speakers have built in limiting.  That said, Mackie thumps are pretty low end speakers so they won't have the best protection and if you're clipping your signal enough to blow your old speakers, riding a distorted signal through a speaker - even with limiting - isn't going to be the best for them - especially for cheap speakers like thumps.  Keep your levels in check and don't run your speakers to the clip point or you'll be replacing those within a couple years as well."
Beatmatch,332dsq,dj_soo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"Given you were feeding your LINE level output from the NS6 into the amplifier, if the speakers have blown it probably means your amplifier and speakers were poorly matched. Riding the gains is more likely to result in clipping than blown equipment if it's of decent quality.  If the speakers don't work with another amplifier at reasonable levels, then it's likely they have burnt out internally.  In terns of using the Mackie's - yes - just two cables are needed. Power lead from the wall to the speaker. XLR to XLR cable from the NS6 to the speaker. When you set your levels, watch for the red ""OL"" LED indiacating the speaker is at it's Overload Limit (and the limiter would be engaging) and keep your levels just below that.  http://thump.mackie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Thump12_Thump15_OM.pdf"

Your mistakes will happen but you just have to accept them and move on. If you mix slowly and with the right effects you can make things sound purposeful despite being not phrased.  The best way someone explained this me is that nobody gives a shit when a rock band's guitarist plays the wrong chord at the wrong time. It's music and it's a subjective art. Just go with it and keep on mixing.  If it's in practice like a studio mix then you obviously shouldn't put that mixtape out. I have a high degree of scrutiny for mixtapes I put out.

There is one downside though, if you don't want to worry about the decks and maschine constantly being out of sync you have to either use the sync button; beatmatch the tracks to maschines metronome, or use the phase meter to determine how much you're out of sync with maschine. This applies mainly for step sequencer mode. If you want to play the drums live you can just do so by running maschine into a channel on your mixer."
Beatmatch,32x6ll,rediphile,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:12:34 2015 UTC,Well you can set the tempo in the maschine software...so I'd say start with a simple maschine track and then beatmatch the cdjs to that tempo during the set.
Beatmatch,32x6ll,Renral,2,Fri Apr 17 13:57:40 2015 UTC,It's easy with traktor but if you're playing off a cdj then you might have to send midi clock out your mixer to your laptop and sync maschine to that.   Only problem is your mixer sends the Bon that's auto detected by the fx section. It's good but it's never going to be spot on.
Beatmatch,32x6ll,YoungHef,2,Fri Apr 17 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"That's tricky. Especially if you're going to continue to use audio out of the CDJs purely.   I'm assuming you're looking to incorporate maschine as a drum machine into a single platform. I imagine there's two ways. 1.) leverage a hardware layer (like a mixer board) or a software layer (I highly reccomend ableton Live) over your CDJ setup. You can run the audio from both Maschine PC & and CDJs into the upper layer.  And I personally recommend the soft later approach. You might be able to use A MIDI send function from ableton to keep Machine in-time with your other audio. (Maybe not, just a thought)   2.) Secondly is the option to directly send Machine into a DVS system. I've done this before. I could explain how, but here... DJTT does a way better job:  http://www.djtechtools.com/2013/05/27/maschine-mikro-with-a-kontrol-s2-on-1-mac-using-a-live-input-deck-in-traktor/  And I recommend this method way more than the first. Tho it may be a challenge since you're not running a DVS platform like serato or Traktor."
Beatmatch,32x6ll,brokenstack,2,Fri Apr 17 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"Can you set the DJM2000 as an audio interface in Maschine, so it sends directly to that under the USB channel? If so, then you can do that. As far as Syncing goes, that gets a little more complex.  If your DJM2000 handles MIDI clock well, and is sync'd amongst your CDJs, then you can connect the 5pin DIN from the back of the mixer to the MIDI In on your Maschine, and sync the MIDI that way."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,TastesLikeDoom,10,Thu Apr 16 23:53:29 2015 UTC,"Cons - expensive, constantly have to spend money on maintenance like needles, vinyl, tuneups, etc.  Lots of turntables in clubs are poorly maintained.   Pros - fun, if you can mix on vinyl, you can mix on anything, scratching, good decks like techs hold resale value and basically last forever."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,dj_soo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"A stylus should last for years if it set to the proper tracking weight and not dropped/dragged across the records. Other than that, a good pair of Technics 1200s will only need occasional oiling of the platter spindle and cleaning/lube of the pitch slider. Hardly expensive in the way of maintenance."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Fri Apr 17 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the stylus - depends on how you use them.  Years is a stretch.  I had to regularly replace my 44-7s at least once every 6-8 months when I was regularly using turntables, but I also scratched.  Orts last longer, but if you're using DVS-especially you can wear out needles a little quicker due to the control vinyl gunk that builds up."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,dj_soo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:58:03 2015 UTC,"I've always used Ortofons and I don't scratch, so I've gotten years of use out of mine. I also keep my vinyl and control records fairly clean. Since I don't scratch, I usually only touch the lead out part of the record for cueing so there isn't a lot of buildup on the grooves themselves. I could see how a scratch DJ could burn through a stylus much quicker."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,PoopyButt_Childish,3,Fri Apr 17 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"Regular upkeep and maintenance is probably the biggest downside. Not to mention the costs associated with regularly buying new vinyl and needles (I need to replace mine every six months or so), as well as cleaning and maintaining your record collection.   That being said, nothing matches the fun and feel of vinyl. After having tried DVS, controllers, and CDJs I'm still on vinyl only and would not imagine playing on anything else.  If you're at home there's really no downside to it apart from the cost, but that can be avoided if you opt to use your turntables with DVS. If you can stretch your budget by about $100 I'd recommend the Audio Technica AT-LP1240-USB Direct Drive DJ Turntable."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,Mr_RD,2,Fri Apr 17 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, because I'm Canada that one's almost $600, any other suggestions? Thanks for all the other tips!"
Beatmatch,32v6kt,Mr_RD,3,Fri Apr 17 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could look for a pair of used Technics that might be cheaper if you get lucky and find a good deal, although I doubt they'll be less than $400 - $500 each. If not, any super OEM turntable from the list below will be perform well.   Audio Technica AT-LP1240  Stanton ST/STR8-150  American Audio HTD 4.5  Citronic PD-45/45mk2  Synq XTRM1  Akiyama Acura DJ-4000  Reloop RP6000MK5  Ominitronic DD5250  Kam DDX5000  BST PRO-PR4.5  Koolsound TDJ-04  I'd stay away from anything not in the above list and anything by Gemini and Numark regardless of how cheap they are. Having a turntable that performs well is essential to doing any mixing / scratching."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,GirtyGirty,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:33:21 2015 UTC,How do you feel about the Stanton T series? Like the T92 and such.
Beatmatch,32v6kt,Mr_RD,2,Fri Apr 17 03:42:17 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you a few months ago. On an impulse I spent my tax refund on pair of the Stanton T.92's. It's been a frustrating, but fun learning process. Mostly just mixing from my small, but growing record collection so far. I haven't invested in a DVS system, which I'm hoping to do soon. That said, I kind of wish I had just took my time and saved up my money for Technics."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,BenlovesBud,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"I've never used one but the reviews say that it performs well and is great value for money. Apart from the awkward placement of the power switch it seems like a pretty good turntable to start out with, especially if you can get a pair at a competitive price.  I've done a search on eBay.ca and found a few listings for Technics at $700 - $800 a pair so that might be worth looking into if the final cost works out to be a little more."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,junglizer,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"my mate had a pair of t.62's for a while before upgrading to technics. They where ok for learning, but once you get to a decent level you will want technics :)"
Beatmatch,32v6kt,BenlovesBud,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:29:23 2015 UTC,"Or pick up a super OEM from the list above. The Stanton STR(R8)-150's solid, and actually have more torque than Techs."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,junglizer,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"and the same price for 1 as it is for a pair of techs, actually, i got my pair of techs + ortofons for under the asking price for 1 str8 150..."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,PoopyButt_Childish,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not hating on Techs, just want to point out that the lower models don't make a good comparison and that there are other good tables. I'm assuming you bought them used? That's not really a good comparison either. Techs can be found in good condition for good prices, but that all depends on where you live."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,Mr_RD,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:23:19 2015 UTC,How are you burning through a stylus in 6 months? They should last a lot longer than that.
Beatmatch,32v6kt,MSD_,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:50:17 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the stylus and manufacturer. When I started out I didn't know what I was doing so I had my turntables incorrectly configured and would have a heavy hand when dealing with my records. I was using cheaper Stanton / Audio Technica stylii at the time and those would last anywhere from 5 to 7 months.   Eventually I moved over to Ortofon Concordes which lasted about 8 to 10 months, and now I'm on Taruya cartridges which I guess will have a similar lifespan."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,EmileDorkheim,6,Sat Apr 18 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"I just found CDJ and controllers boring in relation to the responsiveness and feel of vinyl.  If you want to get into scratching and turntablism, going for turntables is a no brainer.  If you don't, then quite frankly, turntables are a butt tonne less practical than any sort of controller or CDJ setup for reasons stated in other comments. But boy is it so much more rewarding."
Beatmatch,32v6kt,qpb,2,Fri Apr 17 05:06:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. Turntables are more fun, everything else is more practical. It depends which of those two things you want.  However, something that bugs me is that I think the idea of DJM/CDJs being the ubiquitous standard is a bit of a myth. Maybe it varies by region. Here in Glasgow, Scotland most small venues (the type I like to go to, and have any chance of playing in) have a pair of Technics and a mixer, and most DJs I dance to when I'm out are still using vinyl. In those venues, turning up with a bag of records is still the most convenient thing. Some venues are even vinyl-only, although I find that quite pretentious."

Definitely assemble a music library of some sorts, but more importantly, start to practice and play around with sounds and tracks. You should start to understand what songs sound good with each other. In addition, practicing music theory and other fundamentals right now will help tremendously, because when you finally get a controller you'll be able to hit the ground running!"

Beatmatch,32tphj,rbren658,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:09:29 2015 UTC,with the SL2 basically think of it just being a recorder built into the application so you dont have to open up anything else. Youll still have to run a line in to your laptop for it to record from that.   If you had any of the rane mixers it would be a different case because it will record the master out. Since you have the SL2 though it doesn't know what is going out or not at the mixer.
Beatmatch,32tphj,Darkwr41th,0,Thu Apr 16 18:10:23 2015 UTC,so do i run a line in from my mixer into my macbook?

Beatmatch,32tphj,junglizer,2,Thu Apr 16 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"The SL2 does not have an input that Serato can use for recording...  only the SL3 and SL4 do. With that mixer you would need to split the master output somehow, run it to the line-in on your computer, and record in a 3rd party application like Audacity while keeping in mind that having a 3rd party recording application in the background increases the chances of computer hang-ups/crashes if your system is not particularly powerful."
Beatmatch,32tphj,Darkwr41th,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:45:38 2015 UTC,Since it doesn't have booth or record you're going to have to split the master. I have a Behringer UCA222 that I use to record in Audacity.

Beatmatch,32ov9r,PlopDropper,10,Wed Apr 15 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"in my opinion beat matching is a huge help but not necessary.   it's a necessary skill to have.  bpm detection isn't 100% accurate.  Some tracks fluctuate.  Some tracks have tempo changes.   Learning to beatmatch trains your ears to hear drifts, and focus on distinguishing between the tracks with your ears.  beginners shouldn't be telling other beginners what is or what is not necessary."
Beatmatch,32ov9r,dj_soo,2,Wed Apr 15 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed beat matching really isn't up to your opinion, its necessary and starting with that attitude is a poor beginning."

Why people think that advancements in technology gives them a ""pass"" to not have to learn the fundamentals blows my freeking mind.

I used virtual DJ in 2006 when I didn't have any equipment and all I had was my shitty desktop and I wanted to make a mix for my car. What I'm talking about is the use of VDJ without an external controller, you can't accurately EQ while mixing, you can't flip your LOW instantaneously. It's these limitations what I shit on."
Beatmatch,32ov9r,nowenknows,0,Thu Apr 16 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"Virtual DJ has COMPLETELY changed!   The software is far far better now, why are you shitting on something from years ago? Seems a bit unfair to me"

I loved it when I started out but then I tried Serato and it's such a huge difference in sound quality and professionalism that I never went back. VirtualDJ is really something you use to decide if you want to get into DJing, but not something you should use if you aspire to be a proper DJ. Quick experiment you can do: record yourself EQing the same tracks on VDJ and then do the same with Serato. You'll instantly understand why everyone shits on VDJ."

Or if the drums are too quiet in a live show? Probably not unless they're musicians, but they will know how the song makes them feel and how a song should sound and feel.

If the changes stick, then it's definitely something in the folder that's off permissions-wise.  If that's the case, take the old folder and Get Info (cmd-I).

When I started I had a Numark and a Gemini PT-500, then I had a pair of Gemini PT-1000II's before I upgraded to Technics. The PT-1000II's were a great cheap substitute to Techs, I was able to practice with DVS and vinyl with minimal skipping. If you are looking for a great stepping stool, these are your go to. Where do you live? I have a pair in my attic I'd be willing to sell."

Beatmatch,32lhye,foxsoup,3,Wed Apr 15 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"I bought a pair of PT-2400s from a guy on eBay for the princely sum of £60 when I got into vinyl DJing a couple of years ago and I'm still playing on them today.  Mostly used at home to practise on but they've also been rocked out for a few house parties.  For what it's worth they're mainly used for mixing techno and breakbeat (non-DVS) so I can't comment on how they are for scratching, and I've replaced the stock cartridges with a pair of Ortofon DJ-S concordes.  I reckon they're a perfectly decent first pair of decks to learn on if you can find a pair in good condition - just do the usual health checks if you're buying second-hand (look at pitch calibration, how stiff or loose the tonearms and counterweights are, buttons sticking, etc).  Take some records with you and give them a good test before buying.  In summary, I bought mine for about a tenth of the price that I would've paid for a pair of second-hand 1210s and I've learned how to mix on them to a reasonable level of competency.  If I'd had £600 to spunk on Technics then maybe the journey would've been marginally easier, but for the price I don't think it was a bad choice.  Now that I've upgraded my mixer the next purchase probably will be a pair of Technics, but until then I'm happy with what I've got."

Beatmatch,32ifz3,Heyo_Maggots_,7,Tue Apr 14 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"I mostly organize by key. After that, I add in comments for songs based on genres as I know them (what I call electro house isn't really electro house, but when I see those words, I know what kind of track it is). Bc I organize by key, I'm sifting through a ton of tracks at a time, but I prefer to see all of my options in my current key rather than a set genre of tracks.   As for different genres, I think it's important to know how to bounce around. In a club or party situation, you need to be able to drop from hip hop to pop to club to house and back again. Mixing in genre is easy, you should practice the multi genre stuff to improve your marketability."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,knitted_beanie,3,Tue Apr 14 05:08:45 2015 UTC,"I love the ""what I call x isn't really x"" approach.   Obviously I try to be semi-accurate with genres and stuff, but what I'm learning fast is that it's all about personal organisation. No muso is gonna come vet your crates. Just stack things the way you need to to help you play better and you'll be fine. I have folders called ""80s-90s sparkly fun"" and that tells me all I need to know, I guess it's probably electro or some sugary trap/synthpop but I know what it is and that's what counts."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,DJ_Theo,0,Tue Apr 14 15:47:25 2015 UTC,"Some clubs book DJs because they are experts at a specific sub genre of dance music - I would hesitate to give a broad statement such as yours that ALL artists should know how to mix a little bit of everything. If I'm a techno artist and I get booked for an after hours set, why the hell would I play hip-hop, top40, or anything else completely unrelated to what I was booked? Maybe if you're a DJ playing at a club or party that hires you expecting you to play a wide variety of music then you should be familiar with mixing across genres. You'll never become an expert at mixing a particular sub genre if you take that approach however. It might ""seem easy"" to mix a genre once you get the basics, but that's just the tip of the iceberg - then you can start really experimenting and come up with some insane transitions."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,Heyo_Maggots_,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:24:17 2015 UTC,"That's fair to say, but I'm going to stick with my suggestion to go broad when starting out. The more genres you can mix, the more promoters you can approach and the more job opportunities you can take.  You make a good point that there is no overnight expert when mixing in genre. Everything takes work. Mixing in genre is easier for sure, but to be something special takes a lot of practice.   I stand by my idea that ALL DJ's should know a bit of everything. What happens when your crowd leaves the dancefloor just because they suddenly aren't feeling the techno? I'm just saying be prepared in every way you can."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,DJ_Theo,2,Tue Apr 14 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Also a valid point - I always have deep house, minimal, techno, and trance ready and can mix in between pretty seamlessly.   I think as a beginning DJ, one should choose the path of either becoming a broad spectrum artist that can play anything (get more gigs and play to wider audiences) OR choose one or two sub genres that you really love and dive deep (with the chance that gigs will be few and far between but your crowd will be fanatics about that style of music)"
Beatmatch,32ifz3,gotblues,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:18:42 2015 UTC,"Genres are a very important aspect of modern music, especially when curating for a crowd. I always have skirmishes with people at r/jazz who always insist that genres don't matter and that what matters is enjoying music.  Try telling that to a club owner or party promoter who book a DJ only to see the dance floor die down and people line up at the coat check. Even at generic clubs (e.g. Tech/Deep/House, Hip-Hop, Top40.. etc) the music you play at 10pm is not the same as the one you play at 4am. Best way to describe the sound, the vibe, the heaviness, is to call it by a specific genre."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,DJ_Theo,2,Tue Apr 14 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"""the music you play at 10pm is not the same as the one you play at 4am.""  Probably one of the best advice/comments I've seen on this sub. Too many DJs start off thinking they're going to open the night with bangers and start the party early, when they should be setting a mood and slowly raising the energy. Let people show up, check in their coats, grab a drink, and find a place to chill before they start dancing. Alternatively, I've seen many DJs attempt and fail to play a truly inspiring closing set. Take a set from 2-4am for example (I just played one last weekend). In my opinion, as a DJ there's no more rules about what you can/can't play - the people that are going to leave will probably leave soon no matter what you play and the people in it for the long haul will 9/10 have an open mind for what you play. This is the chance for a DJ to play anything from the dreamiest minimal ear-candy techno to leave the building in shambles hard dance. A closing set should be a journey down the rabbit hole to a different world, I feel this gets lost sometimes with the typical opener/headliner bill and no closing act very common nowadays."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,gotblues,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"Well that's how DJ's can make a name for themselves: by playing a vast array of genres and mood to fit the crowd. Work them out, make them high-five each other and take selfies, but insert enough room to breathe, go to the restroom, and of course buy drinks at the bar (since DJ's can take a cut of that)"
Beatmatch,32ifz3,isaidicanshout,4,Tue Apr 14 22:57:04 2015 UTC,"I organize by ""feel"" and ""energy level"" not by genre.  So like... A medium energy techno track that is kind of spacey is in a smart playlist called ""Cosmic 2"". This playlist may also have disco and indie that are also ""medium and spacey""."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,djkai,2,Tue Apr 14 02:47:50 2015 UTC,"''Lastly, should I be spinning one genre?'' - This depends what event you're playing at. If it's a house night, then yes... But if it's your local bar, they may want a mix of genres. Always check this BEFORE you're due to play! The type of music you play will dictate how you sort it.   I use Pioneers Rekordbox to sort my music (which I highly recommend), and I do it by genre (when I play, I'm rarely going to be changing between genres, I will either be playing house, techno, or some mix of the two). I'll have a playlist folder for 'Techno', then sub-playlists such as 'warm up', 'minimal', 'peak  time', 'dark/rollers' etc. Some tracks get in multiple playlists.  If I have a gig coming up, I'll also have a separate playlist folder for that gig. I see this as my 'record crate', and it will contain tracks I know I will play and some I think I might. If I get stuck, I can then fall back on my other playlists to find a track I need."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,brokenstack,2,Tue Apr 14 06:36:49 2015 UTC,"I use the genre tag, but I use it as another sorting method, not some dictation of a genre for the song. For example, I break my collection down like a standard database. So we have our unique identifiers, like track name, artist, album, etc. Then we have our columns that are sortable and related, like BPM and key. From there, everything is generally up in the air, and I can dictate them as I see fit, like Rating, Genre, and Comments. It's about organizing your music so you can find what you need.  If, however, you are spinning an event that is billed as a techno event, for people who will only want to hear techno, and who know what techno is, you might want to make sure you have playlists organizing that stuff, away from the sort. It definitely depends on the party, though, and I think most of the time you can get away with a lot if you do it right."
Beatmatch,32ifz3,djkai,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah really does depend on the party...There's nothing wrong with checking with the promoter what sort of music is expected if you're unsure.

Another good reason to check haha."

Beatmatch,32ifz3,Ykesha,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:39:54 2015 UTC,"I probably make it a pain on the ass for myself but I have about 29 ""genre"" folders. For example: ""House - Bass"", ""House - Future"", ""House - Deep"", ""Breaks - Florida"", ""Breaks - Funky"", ""Trap - EDM"", ""Trap - Hip Hop/Pop remixes"" etc. These are my primary collection folders that contain every single track I have that I think fits into that specific genre. Some tracks are in multiple folders because I feel like they could either be one thing or the other. I don't really stress over accuracy. The main point of these folders is primarily storage.  I make play lists for the feeling or type of tracks in it. I have a playlist called ""Wonky Bass"" that includes trap, house, breaks, tech house and whatever else I want for when I want to move to a more wonky bass sound. I like to switch up BPMs and genres a lot so I don't mind having all these different genres on a single play list as it keeps me from getting stuck on a single one.  As for spinning one genre or many it is going to depend on the night and also on you. Like a lot of people already said ""If its a house night, play house"". I used to only stick to one genre but as I began to listen to more and more music I found tracks from dozens of genres I really wanted to play so I began to slowly incorporate different styles of music into my set. I felt like my sets became much more dynamic and more importantly the people on the floor were having a lot more fun."

Two weeks ago I saw a hip-hop DJ at a local club/bar that did the same thing: he stuck with the thematic ""NYC/East-Coast/Notorious B.I.G./Wu-Tang clan"" sound that people would expect, but in between he threw in some trippy ambient beats, RNB, Soul, 80's Funk and 90's Acid Jazz.

Beatmatch,32ifz3,DJ_Selina_Style,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"It's an ongoing process -- your definitions of genres will shift as you listen to more music and get more familiar with your scene. Start with big buckets that seem to best fit for you (house, hip hop, rock, etc). When you get enough in that category that there are clear sub-categories (so now you have enough house to separate your deep house from your electro from your b-more, etc), start splitting those out.   I will set the genre on a track to the best-fitting category when I add it to my library. If I have a song that really straddles genre, I may add both to the tag or drop it in both genre playlists for my core set.  TL;DR -- the only organization method that matters is the one that makes sense to you and helps you quickly find the tracks you need. Pay attention to the question you're trying to answer when you play, whether that's ""what's another good house mix, they seem to like this one"" or ""that's too hype this early in the night, what are some other grooving tracks around 120bpm?"" Try out some playlists around that, and see if it helps your flow. Stick with what works, and archive the rest -- you never know when an old playlist might help you out in the future."

I also like to always try to keep in mind that Im in this because I love it, and I love the music. If Im not playing music and enjoying it, Im playing the wrong stuff. With most of my mixes I perform them for myself and then listen to them on repeat almost. Some of them have 50+ plays looking at my iTunes.

Get the tracks and put them in order of how the DJ mixed them and then listen to that, then the mix, then the originals again and listen to/understand where the DJ transitions and what effects they use and how.   If it weren't for being able to access the huge wealth of online DJ related videos and footage, I would not be at the level I am today and certainly wouldnt have the understanding that I now do. Another thing I wanted to note is that there is a relatively new site for DJ's called Chew. Its a site where DJ's can upload and stream live mixes as they perform them.

Ever look back at a transition and say ""huh, I never thought of that one.""  As for listening to other people's mixes, I spend a small amount of time during and after listening to critique the mix. What went well? What went wrong? What was your favorite part? What part did you think stood out? By critically thinking about the mix and the structure of it you gain a better understanding of how to make good mixes.  There are a few mixes that I consider ""essential listening"" for any new DJ.

Sorry I'm running out of ideas. Did you try it on a different computer or a phone with the app through your same network?  Maybe go to a public wifi spot (if this machine is a laptop) and verify it there? Lol
Beatmatch,32h0bo,Audioasis,3,Mon Apr 13 18:58:01 2015 UTC,"I think the pair of RCAs on the 2i4 marked 3/4 are a separate stereo channel - so unless you configure them properly,  they dont carry the same signal and could be defaulting to the stab noise... not sure though.  The better solution is to daisy chain your sub and speakers if you can, and thus share a single stereo output."

Beatmatch,32hani,sickomakacc,5,Mon Apr 13 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"You surely can. If it was bad to do this it's pretty much only possible to raise your bpm during your set and you would get stuck at a very high bpm at some point. You won't hear small changes in bpm, even when they go down. Good advice will be to lower the bpm during a raise, and quite quickly, because usually the sounds in the track go very fast already."
Beatmatch,32hani,DidNotKnowDat,2,Mon Apr 13 20:25:09 2015 UTC,Ok thanks will try that. Going up constantly quickly reduced my library I was really confused.
Beatmatch,32hani,Dantejb,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:40:58 2015 UTC,Yeah going 2-3 BPM down is tough if not impossible to hear on the dance floor. Just find a good place to slowly creep it up or down when you feel like it.
Beatmatch,32hani,marymelodic,3,Tue Apr 14 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"Usually a good workflow that I use is to build it up from about 100, go to the 110-120 Pop songs, work in some EDM at that young 128, then start pitching up a 128 song to 140, drop in some trap at 70, then work that up to 80, 90, ad infintium. I'm an open format kind of DJ though, so this may not work for everybody.   Another trick could be working with songs which change BPM mid song (Deorro's Hit It does this, so do many other EDM songs), making custom edits that build up or slow down, or playing a song, going into a more laid back song, then slow that down and transition from there. People are less likely to notice a chill song is slowing down as opposed to a banger."
Beatmatch,32hani,Drfetus177,2,Mon Apr 13 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"I've heard about that first ""around the horn"" technique before - clever way to have the set sound like it's always building."
Beatmatch,32hani,brokenstack,2,Tue Apr 14 05:11:08 2015 UTC,"Well yes and no, you CAN do whatever you want but try to not split more than 10 bpm or it might start sounding weird. For instance 130 and 120 bpm, just meet in the middle at 125. If it's outside of that range I normally will backspin out the playing track into the new one or fade into it during a part that has no percussion.  Hope that helped!"
Beatmatch,32hani,djdementia,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:29:38 2015 UTC,"You can do whatever you want, but record it and listen to it first. You can do drastic tempo changes, and it can be really dramatic and kick the energy up, but it can also be really weird. Dance around your apartment listening to it and see how you feel. More than likely that's how your floor will feel."
Beatmatch,32hani,Tehrmbruhn,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:39:50 2015 UTC,Absolutely necessary part of DJing.  Practice how to do it so the dancefloor doesn't notice.  Just remember during your beatcounting that dancers often plant their foot on 'the 1' so you don't want to change speed then.
Beatmatch,32hani,Psythik,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:51:42 2015 UTC,"I rarely ever changed my live track by more than 10 BPM while it was playing, and for an increase as dramatic as that I spread it out over the majority of the song. Little nudge here and there won't hurt ya"
Beatmatch,32hani,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:43:12 2015 UTC,"Of course you can. My favorite way to do this is to pick a song with a much lower BPM than the current one, bring it up to the same speed, then slowly lower the pitch on both decks at the same time until the slower song is at its normal BPM by the time the next phrase starts (like so, see first example). Of course this takes a lot of practice unless you have Pitch Lock.  EDIT: And by the way, there aren't any hard set rules when it comes to DJing. The entire art was born from people playing records the ""wrong"" way. Don't be afraid to experiment, try something that maybe hasn't been done before. You don't stand out from the crowd by following the ""rules"" and mixing the same way everyone else does. Just make sure the end result sounds good. That's the hard part. :)"
Beatmatch,32h580,Tim_Theory,3,Mon Apr 13 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the genre, vibe, time of day, time of your set, who's DJ'ing after you, what type of event it is, crowd, etc...  Warming up can be about just setting the mood. If you're playing early, people aren't necessarily there to dance, so you want to get people nodding their heads, tapping their feet etc. All good signs. If you're playing later on and before the 'main' DJ, or if people are there to dance, then it's a balance between getting people dancing without playing big tracks or trying to steal the show. It's also a good opportunity to play more experimental music.  I was recently playing a gig early in the day (3-4pm) and was only the second DJ to play. It was an outdoor event. Here is a link to a promo mix I done for it with some of the tracks I used (I hope this isn't seen as self promotion, feel free to remove if it is): https://soundcloud.com/kai_worley/mix-003-techatude-march-2015  It was an house/techno event, so I went with some real minimal stuff at the beginning and gradually increased the tempo and energy of the tracks. When I started there wasn't many people in the area, after about 30/40mins the place was getting packed and people were dancing, nodding their heads etc. Job done.   But those tracks wouldn't have worked in different circumstances. It's about reading the crowd and the vibe and being able to adapt!"

Beatmatch,32gncg,adamsegall,4,Mon Apr 13 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"Do you have backups? Backup USB, backup cables, etc. I'd seriously consider having some spare XLR and RCA cables in the event they're asking you to provide those.  I recommend getting a 3.5 mm male to RCA male cable. This the last ditch backup that you would hook into an iPod or phone just to play tracks off of. If for some reason you can't get your gear going, then at least you have -something- to play and won't look bad for completely dropping a set.  I'd look over the tracks you have and then consider if it fits the crowd. If it's your first gig I might check to see if you fit into the set. Who's before you? who's after you? What is the crowd made up of? for example: It would be silly to play raging bigroom at 1 in the afternoon.  Lastly, pregig jitters happen to the best of us. I think of all of the DJs I know i get the worst (sitting in the backroom breathing into my face). It all fades the moment I press play and make my first transition. Trust your practice and make sure to have fun!"

To get right to your concerns I agree maybe your fx got a bit repetitive but I never really noticed it. Track selection was really nice, great tunes with a healthy mix of different genres. Over all nice mix for only being a month in.   On a personal note I like it when someone mixes between song lengths. So for example go from basically intro to outro on one song and then the next two transitions shorten them up from maybe one build up to a drop and then mixing in shortly there after. I'm not saying you need to do this but it might be something to think about to create a more dynamic mix... but again thats my opinion. Keep up the good work buddy!"

For example, your transition from I Can't Stop into Crowd Control was off by a fairly large margin, and just didn't feel right. I think Crowd Control had too much energy for such a sharp transition from a more laidback song. I do understand what you were trying to achieve however.

The issue was your comment wasn't adding to the discussion, just flaming the noobs.  Think about the new DJs that are coming up, they have never had to interconnect ANY audio gear and deal with line level signal (much less phono level) so what basis do they have to go on ""know this"" for hooking up to a central mixer. You are generalizing new DJs as being in it for the wrong reasons. Instead of going off in a hate storm, it would have been better to suggest new DJs do some research on what they will be plugging in to, how it works, and that they should ask for help.

Beatmatch,32e04w,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how big your gigs are but for just outside your budget (probably closer to 1200) you could get 1 really solid loud speaker and a sub. Or two lesser quality louds if running your output on mono isn't an option. On a budget you'll probably want to stick with powered speakers but I'm far from an sound engineering pro. Either way subs are expensive and are going to eat up 6-800 right off the bat. I recently purchased a Yamaha DXR12 for 500 and man that thing gets loud, good range for what it is too. Though I'm in no rush to collect a decent set up. Sounds like your budget might be a little light for a complete set up, especially if you don't already have a mixer."

Granted, i use this for house parties (big houses), Frat parties, and smaller venues where quality isn't my MAIN concern.

Beatmatch,32bhy0,GFagandini,10,Sun Apr 12 09:31:24 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but this is pretty simple maths.  70 * 2 = 140  71 * 2 = 142  69 * 2 = 138
Beatmatch,32bhy0,BenlovesBud,4,Sun Apr 12 11:31:57 2015 UTC,"140 BPM vs. 70 BPM should be pretty easily recognizable, given that one is quite fast and the other is much more mellow. It's a drastic difference. How would you dance to the track? Fast-paced jumping around would fit 140, 70 less so.  Alternately, there are free iOS/Android apps where you can tap out the beat to estimate the BPM, but provided you've heard a song before, knowing if it's closer to 80 or 160 BPM, for example, shouldn't be an issue, because that's a huge difference.  EDIT: Here is a video with a drummer illustrating 70 BPM, compare to 140 with this video"
Beatmatch,32bhy0,cruxclaire,3,Sun Apr 12 14:07:00 2015 UTC,"Cover the BPM readouts, use your ears."
Beatmatch,32bhy0,alfiepates,2,Mon Apr 13 02:38:08 2015 UTC,Math is easy blablabla. I don't think that's the answer you're looking for.   Usually the snare falls on the 2 and 4. That's how you should be able to tell the difference between 140 and 70.   There is such a thing as half time where technically the bpm will be 140 but the drums are playing half of that so that's where it gets tricky. I'd say usually dubstep and trap follow halftime but not always.
Beatmatch,32bhy0,SenorSarcasmo,2,Sun Apr 12 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"Not to be arrogant, but you need to be focusing on whether the songs sound matched, not what the numbers say. Relying on the BPM displays is a bad habit that will get you in trouble. That's just the computer's estimate of the BPM that can be completely wrong. As many have said, you will have to adjust the 70bpm ""half as much"" as the 140 bpm song, but most pitch faders operate on a percentage of the original track's speed. Whether the song is 140bpm or 70, you will have to move the slider the same amount. 140 to 141 is .7%, so is 70 to 70.5."
Beatmatch,32bhy0,BlackholeZ32,2,Sun Apr 12 20:13:25 2015 UTC,"A 70bpm track can mix well with a 140bpm because 70 is half of 140. If you adjust a 140 track to 141, then the halved track needs to be 70.5bpm for better alignment."
Beatmatch,32bhy0,tmccoy00,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:10:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but often you don't exactly know if a song is 70 or 140 so am i pushing it to 71 or 141? I'm confused on this one thing
Beatmatch,32bhy0,marremojj,3,Sun Apr 12 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter. If you're in 70 and want to go to 71 you have to pitch it up by about 1,4% (71/70). If you want to go from 140 to 142 you have to pitch it up equally as much since 142/140 is the same as 71/70.  Edit: You could even say that the track is in 35 or 280 bpm, it really doesn't matter. Personally, I have a rule for my own library that I always sort dubstep and trap as the higher one (140). This is mostly due to convenience so that when I sort my music by tempo I have all of it at the same place in the list. Same thing for drumstep which is usually 170-180 bpm half time, so you could call it 85-90. The reason why I decide to call it the higher one (170-180) is that I like to mix drumstep with drum & bass, which is full time instead of half. All of those genres are generally composed at the higher tempo, too, to make it easier make the fast percussion that is common in all of them, so that's an other reason."
Beatmatch,32bhy0,Josh938,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:09:54 2015 UTC,What difference does it make? If your tracks are 71 and 140 make it 142 or 70. It just has to be half. Better to change the higher bpm track though as it is less change and it still sounds good.
Beatmatch,32bhy0,bart2019,2,Sun Apr 12 14:19:41 2015 UTC,"Why do you think an increment  of 1BPM is ""magical""? I know it's a bit of a custom, but actually relative changes are much more important than difference in BPM values: a difference of 1BPM at 140BPM is 1/140 or roughly 0.7%, which is fairly small, but at 70BPm is is 1/70 or 1.4%, which is twice as much.  So yeah, to keep a 70BPM track in sync with a 140BPM track while increasing  the BPM on both tracks, you'll have to increment the 140BPM track by twice the amount in BPM as the 700BPM track, to adjust them by the same relative amount, and to keep them in sync."
Beatmatch,32bhy0,Brenner14,-4,Sun Apr 12 12:30:46 2015 UTC,But how am i sure if a song it's 70 or 140
Beatmatch,32bhy0,cthom412,9,Sun Apr 12 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"...there is functionally no difference, so the question doesn't matter. No one is forcing you to adjust the tempo of tracks by exactly 1BPM, so the problem you described in the OP doesn't exist.  Now, if you still wish to differentiate between tracks that are 70/140, there is a nifty tool you can use to help you with that. Basically (in EDM), if there's a kick 140 times each minute, the track is 140BPM. If it only comes 70 times each minute, it's 70BPM."
Beatmatch,32bhy0,Con1750,3,Sun Apr 12 14:01:40 2015 UTC,I could be wrong here but I'm gonna guess with you specifically mentioning 140bpm and 70bpm that you mix either dubstep or trap.   If that's the case almost everything in both of those genres is produced at around 140 and not 70. But when CDJs are analyzing the tempo they might be read as 70 since both genres are almost always written in half time.   So if those are the genres you mix then chances are almost all of the songs you're using were written in 140. But honestly it doesn't matter what the tempo is read as since 140 and 70 are essentially the same thing.
Beatmatch,32bhy0,slapfish1,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:23:28 2015 UTC,If you know there around half whats the issue? You should know the tracks you are playing anyway and not use the numbers on screens religiously.

Beatmatch,329bsz,cruxclaire,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"Are you using Serato Intro or any other software? If you are using another software, have you set the master and headphones out to the correct outputs?"
Beatmatch,329bsz,ChrisRK,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm using Serato Intro. I just checked the setup page - could it be that having ""use auto gain"" checked is the reason I'm still getting sound at 0 gain? Raising the gain from 0 definitely does increase the volume of an individual track, it's just that I can't seem to get the volume down to 0, even when the gain fader for that track is all the way down.  EDIT: Unchecked auto gain, the problem persists, except when a track is not cued in the headphones, decreasing the channel gain all the way does decrease the volume to 0, which seems counter-intuitive."
Beatmatch,329bsz,ChrisRK,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"No, Auto Gain will just set an upper limit for how loud each track can go so one track that's mastered to be more silent will be just as loud as a track mastered with a hard compressor (you can compare it to Replay Gain in foobar2000).  If you use the controller with another software with visible sliders (Mixxx for example), does the deck volume slider go all the way down to the bottom?"
Beatmatch,329bsz,ChrisRK,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Both Mixxx and VDJ aren't recognizing the controller (or, rather, they are, but nothing happens when I try to use the controller- maybe because I used up my 10 minutes in VDJ?). I'm not sure if I'm configuring it wrong or what, or maybe I should restart my computer and try again.   EDIT: In case it's relevant, Serato recognizes the controller just fine still, and everything works, aside from the gain issue."
Beatmatch,329bsz,ChrisRK,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:39:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the double reply, but just to make sure this is visible:  I finally got VDJ to recognize the controller by plugging it into a different USB port, but bizarre things are happening when I try to use it. Here is a screenshot showing how I'm getting a sort of ghost gain slider appearing that doesn't actually affect volume, whereas using the mouse to control the gain fader for that deck does, but only for that deck it seems, because the track on Deck B was not audible at all, even with the channel gain and EQ knobs all turned up all the way. You can also see a ghostly-looking crossfader setting - I'm not sure if the phantom fader or the corporeal fader is working."
Beatmatch,329bsz,Con1750,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"Since Serato recognizes it and you got it working in VDJ, I can only guess Mixxx is being stupid.  If it is in the Controllers list, did you select the Mixtrack Pro from the drop-down list?  A quick google search tells me this about the ghost faders:   If you connect your controller after VirtualDj opens then VirtualDj will read the position of the faders, but it will display them as ""ghost"" faders on skin, and you have to move them to take over.   The crossfader will forever be a ghost if you can't move it but deck A should not have that if it's working.  In Virtual DJ, try using the 2'nd output and see if you can hear deck B with it. If you can haer deck B but not A, it's set to be used with an external audio mixer. I'm sure there's a setting in VDJ somewhere where you can select the audio outputs but in Serato Intro you can't change the audio settings at all.  If you find it, set Deck A and B to nothing and the master to either Channel 1-2, 3-4 or 5-6, same with Headphones. You can either guess or use what Deck A was set to."
Beatmatch,329bsz,djnickynick,1 point,Sun Apr 12 09:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I think I figured out the problem, and it was really stupid on my part - I had one side of the RCA connector plugged into Output 1 and the other into Output 2. Now that they're both plugged into Output 1, the volume faders seem to be perfectly operational. I feel like an idiot, but I'm relieved that there wasn't some underlying hardware issue!"

Beatmatch,328jw9,Kyderra,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"Damn son, that's weird as fuck.  Maybe it's to do with OBS trying to use the S4 soundcard. If you right click on the volume icon on the taskbar, view ""playback devices"" and make sure the S4 isn't your default device.  If that doesn't work try using different audio setups within Traktor. A friend of mine refuses to use the ASIO drivers as they don't behave properly on his system for some reason...  If THAT doesn't work, it's time to call tech support :P"

Beatmatch,326ncg,NeonSeal,3,Sat Apr 11 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely ask your friend for songs - their group has already sessioned together for ages, so they're going to have favorites.  BUT something to remember - let the beat drop. Each bboy will go in for around 30+ seconds, so if you change songs quickly, the vibe won't really be felt, and the dancers will lose their grasp on the music. And when they expect the beat to drop and it doesnt, it can really throw off their dancing. If you only let less than a minute of a song play, it'll be like one dancer per song, which isn't fun...  Sorry, I really don't know the lingo as I only subscribe to this sub for fun, but when I saw your post, I had to respond. I attended a jam recently and the dj was the worst - he treated it like a homecoming concert, switching up songs way too quickly, never letting the dancers really vibe with the music or enjoy the beats. He literally played 30 seconds of Soulja Boy, then Chicken Noodle Soup, etc. (which isn't good for breaking, locking, housing, or anything really...) So yeah, don't be him.   Good luck!"

Didn't even consider the fact that they'd be soloing so I'll be sure to keep each song jamming for a bit longer. Makes it easier for me too, I suppose!  I'll talk to my roommate and see what songs they love. I just scoured mixcloud to discover some good breakbeat songs and im getting a decent library so it'll be fun! Thanks again."
Beatmatch,326ncg,throwawayieruhyjvime,2,Sat Apr 11 03:38:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, np! If you can, I'd recommend attending a bboy session or jam just so you can see what will actually be going on on the floor, so you know what's needed from you on the music side. Also find out if there will ONLY be bboys, or if there will be other freestylers who do housing/locking/waacking, etc., so you know if you should switch up genres and such. Good luck!"

Doing this will take the pressure off and you can experiment with just throwing tracks together, redo the transition if something sounds almost there, throw together tracks that you maybe thought wouldn't go together normally, throw some whacky effects in there for good measure. Then, the next day, go back and listen to the mix you recorded. It might give you some ideas of what some possibilities are for future sets and is a great learning tool for how your mixing sounds and can be improved."

Beatmatch,326s6c,Bragnagar,3,Sat Apr 11 04:30:30 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, listening and trying to mix new and different genres will help you with that.  In my experience, after 4-5 years of mixing trance I felt stuck, so I researched new music, and came up with trying jungle, and that gave me a new air for DJing. At other times I felt stuck with something, so I tried mixing trap, hip hop, old school hard techno, big beat, even old school disco, etc.  Another thing that helped me, was taking a break and researching a totally different world, as I said, I'm always a big fan of trance, so I started researching about turntablism for example.  Apart from expanding your musical collection to fall back on, you can learn new mixing techniques, improving your beatmatch skills. For example, when I felt confident to play with cuepoints when mixing x genre, I applied that knowledge to trance, and gave me a new dimension to it.  Just my two cents, hope that helps."

Then you can sign up for a MP3 pool. I've used Digital DJ Pool, which is $8 a month. For the controller, you are going to need to pick Traktor or Serato, and find a controller for both. The Kontrol S2 is great for starting out with Traktor, and the DDJ-SB is a killer starter controller for Serato. Hope this helps!"
Beatmatch,327dbm,oinkbane,0,Fri Apr 17 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"the new Mixtrack Pro is actually pretty decent, but if you're really that opposed to it you can check out the Pioneer DDJ-SB (I think that's the entry level one) or maybe one of the smaller Hercules controllers (I think the RMX is the sturdier metal one).  I'm using the Numark N4 atm, it's made of plastic but pretty solidly built and as a decent weight to it. Unfortunately it's a bit more expensive."

Most promotional companies aren't looking for a random Joe Schmo bedroom DJ and want someone who is talented and well established or marketed. On the promoters side how are they going to sell tickets if nobody knows whos the opener? What if the opener absolutely bombs and everyone leaves before the main act comes on?  With that aside, it's time to start thinking about more than just the music. You need to start getting involved in your local music scene. Who are the local DJs and people who make things move? Get to know them. Don't cold call because it's obvious when you're just being nice to further your career or if you're interested in actually meeting them.  Start making mixes if you haven't already and start building a fan following. I'd seriously recommend getting some nights playing out at the local clubs under your belt before even thinking about doing a festival. The vibes are different but you need to make sure you don't trainwreck in a live setting.  TL;DR Learn to mix well, meet people in local industry, start DJing at events, and then consider sending your application in. You have ample time to do it if you commit yourself to it."

Beatmatch,325moq,CRYTEK_T-REX,2,Fri Apr 10 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"All the tracks you are going to be playing are already EQ'd/mastered so you shouldn't really have to EQ anything unless the system you are playing on has problems with a certain frequency band. If you are playing on mobile PA systems and assuming they have good sound quality then I really wouldn't do anything. Traditionally bands do a soundcheck so that the sound engineer can mix volume levels of the different instruments into the  main speakers while also scooping out frequencies that clash or create feedback. Soundcheck is also the time when the sound engineer works with the artists to send various levels of different instruments to different monitors on stage.   Because there is basically only one ""instrument"" in DJ'ing the purpose of soundcheck is basically to just make sure all your equipment is working, that there is no obstructions in the signal flow and so that you can make sure there isn't any distortion due to your mixer levels. If you are having trouble with certain frequencies though it may be useful to get a small mixer to put in-between your dj mixer and the amplifier so that you can cut/boost that frequency and still keep your DJ mixer's eq at unity.  As for your VU meter its always good to leave some headroom as you will get better sound quality and less distortion. Each mixer is a little different, but letting your master go into the yellow is fine, I usually let mine go a little into the yellow if needed but no more.  You said you have trouble on some speakers with the highs cutting through too much, this may because you're playing more mobile gigs which I'm assuming are using are on smaller PA systems? It could just be the speakers in this case as many small speaker setups dont have good bass response. Some powered mobile speakers have a switch on the back with settings for ""flat"" ""External Sub"" or ""Bass boost"" like the QSC K12s. If you have an option like this make sure its set to the right setting."

Beatmatch,326qcs,tryanw,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:29:21 2015 UTC,"1st off this is better suited for /r/edmproduction but I'll answer anyway. Regarding the speaker hook up, I would grab a good audio interface, like the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2. You're probably going to want one anyway.   Regarding the MIDI controllers I would probably recommend you don't buy another and reconsider the MIDI Fighter if production is your goal. It's cool and all, but I think you'll really want something with keys and also maybe knobs or pads. There are loads to choose from, even in the hundred dollar range. Start with one and learn the basics. You honestly don't even need anything, but it is nice to have something tactile. (I personally have an Arturia MiniLab).   You really need to start out with the basics, develop a workflow and base your purchases off that. (Same is true of DJ'ing). One trap that a lot of beginners fall into is buying a ton of gear (or VSTs). No one piece of gear, even stuff like synths, or plugin is going to magically make you an amazing producer. Patience from time and practice is what you need. Which is why I say buy something with keys, maybe knobs & pads too and skip the second controller.   If you ignore all of that, I'd recommend the Push. Simply b/c it is designed for Live vs. Maschine which is designed to work with that software. Trying to learn all of the ins and outs of two totally different applications both independently and combined is going to be hard. Frustrating even. Definitely don't forget to read the manuals.   Hope this helps."

Beatmatch,324zx2,brokenstack,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:44:03 2015 UTC,I have the BCD 2000 (same exact controller but no 64-bit drivers) and it's an okay controller.  The Hercules looks much nicer IMO but I don't know much about it.  I'd look into compatibility with what software you plan on using (unless you are going to map it yourself) and let that help you decide.
Beatmatch,324zx2,ChrisRK,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:38:44 2015 UTC,"I'm rocking a BCD 3000 right now.  Good points:   4 in 4 out soundcard (two decks in, master and headphone out) that works with traktor scratch. Yes, really, you can get traktor scratch running on something that costs less than a good meal. And it works well. Plenty of twisty nobs that can be remapped to your heart's content. sliders seem decent (not exemplary, just decent) nobs are the correct size for putting DJ Tech Tools Chroma Caps on so you can give it a visual overhaul (plus the chroma caps are likely to be better than the rather plastic stock ones)   Bad points:   jogwheels are crap and not touch sensitive. They'll do for nudging the track or browsing through the track but nothing more advanced than that no cue point buttons and the buttons really aren't suitable for mashing even with the crossfader curve set to the tightest, it's not tight enough to satisfy a proper scratch DJ (or at least the one scratch DJ I know). I'm considering some sort of hardware mod to restrict the movement of the crossfader to narrow out the dead space at either end. I'm not sure what, my current idea is jamming match sticks in either end. The driver isn't signed for Windows 8. Works fine for Windows 7 with the 64 bit driver. I got round this by using a driver signing utility.   Honestly, it's a great bit of kit for the price (especially considering you can use it for DVS) but it does have its limitations."
Beatmatch,324mmb,Ciccone,2,Fri Apr 10 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"It sounds like what you're really looking for is a DJ Mixer/Audio Interface hybrid. Most DJ Mixers are designed to have 1, maybe 2 XLR inputs for the sole purpose of being able to talk to the audience. Sometimes they'll have Line in for mixing from additional audio sources. Generally this works for live stuff, but I don't know if I would use it for recording.   My recommendation would be to buy a nicer DJ Mixer for your live work and something like a Focusrite 2i2 or 2i4 for an audio interface. There are a ton of options for either, but I would keep them separate instead of trying to find a ""one size fits all"" device for both DJ'ing and production."

My crossfader needs to be in a neutral position to be working even in cue mode.  As well as making sure your cue blend knob is set to cue os you can hear the signal.  As well as mking sure your output settings are correct (from your screencaps i dont think it is correct)   Edit: also you should save your mapping.  Then revert to factory settings/restart the program/restart your laptop to see if this helps.  As it most likely will.

Beatmatch,323i51,djperegrin,15,Fri Apr 10 07:32:08 2015 UTC,"You want a booking agent - not necessarily a manager.  How many gigs are you doing on average a month?  How many offers are you getting?  A reputable booking agent will only really take you on if they feel they will make money from you and if you're only doing a handful of gigs a month then you're better off continuing on your own to build your brand until you can come to them with something worth their while.  Also, how much are you getting paid on average per gig?  Most agencies take a percentage fee per gig so if you're making under $200 per gig, it's really not worth it to them or you to do the work of finding you gigs and negotiate fees for a $40 fee.  Now there are also local agencies that take on Djs, but they tend to move towards mobile Djs with all their own gear Including sound.  so if you're doing mobile events like weddings and school dances, it might be worth your while to look into those.  Most clubs don't really care to deal with agencies for local talent because it's basically just added  bureaucracy and bars will just laugh at you generally.  The only way you might have leverage in dealing with a club is if you regularly pull huge numbers in followers just to see you play week in week out, but if you already do that then there's no real need for an agent.  Now a manager is more responsible for building your brand, directing your career, and suggesting avenues of income not necessarily just in gigs - they are also responsible for the contracts, financials, business decisions, and handling your money and can sometimes manage and arrange the logistics of tours.  Like agents, artist management also gets paid out of a percentage of your gig fee.  Average percentage is usually 15-20% of your fee so if you want both, that's 30-40% off of every gig right there.  Again, unless you're starting to get into the 4 figure fees or you're getting offers to play at least 2-3 times a week or getting offers requiring travel, I doubt it would be so overwhelming to to do it yourself.  If you are getting tons of offers and gigs every week, commanding a relatively decent fee, and getting out of town offers, then go for it.  If not, there's really no point - especially since you've only been at it for a year.  If you know people who are connected then just ask them to introduce you to people and promoters.  Networking is a key skill to have as a dj and you might as well work on getting the gigs yourself.  Keep in mind having an agency in no way guarantees you tons of bookings nor should it stop you from continually hustling yourself.  I currently work with 4 separate agencies (3 local, one touring) and I still need to constantly hustle to get gigs."

Press and hold: Play the music while button is held, when released the song returns (paused) to the set cue point.   -When playing   Press: Return song to set cue point (paused)   What do I do with this?  Really up to you. You can start with getting into the routine of setting a cue point where you want to start mixing the song every time you load a new track.

I'm almost certain you can wire your own controller to do this.  There are DIY midi kits but they might be out of your price range (http://lividinstruments.com/products/builder/).  After building your own kit you just need to connect it to your favorite DJ software (Traktor or Serato in this case) and map it to tell it which buttons on your custom controller correspond to which signals.

Beatmatch,31z7is,BlzHaris,4,Thu Apr 9 08:34:58 2015 UTC,"I believe PFL means ""Pre-Fader Listen""; it sends that channel to your headphones for cueing, when it would otherwise not be heard (due to being turned down)."
Beatmatch,31z7is,BuxtonTheRed,-1,Thu Apr 9 11:49:30 2015 UTC,What about hot cues. my controller doesn't have that what should I do?
Beatmatch,31z7is,BuxtonTheRed,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:05:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on the software you're using, it may be possible to map them to either keyboard keys, or other controller buttons you decide you don't want to use for their ""proper function"".  It's possible to do mapping in Virtual DJ but very fiddly and annoying. I moved over to Traktor for precisely that reason. There should be some guides and tutorials around about how to do VDJ mapping changes though.  Also, you might not need them at all. If you want to do clever multi cue point juggling type of performance then yes you'll need multiple hot cues, but for more ""regular"" performance you really only need the main Cue button which is very likely to be next to the Play button on basically every controller I've ever seen."
Beatmatch,31z7is,BuxtonTheRed,0,Thu Apr 9 12:34:23 2015 UTC,My controller does however come with and an in and out button(two separate buttons on both sides so 4 buttons)can I remap these to work as hot cues
Beatmatch,31z7is,BuxtonTheRed,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"For me, looping is more important than extra hot cues so if it were me, I'd leave those controls as they are.  I suggest getting started with the stock configuration initially, then work out what other controls you want, and either map them to your keyboard or bring in extra ideas."
Beatmatch,31z7is,BuxtonTheRed,0,Thu Apr 9 14:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just getting started with this, could you provide me with a link to a video that demonstrates how to use loop in and out."

Beatmatch,31z7is,Rggity,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:57:46 2015 UTC,It activates the pre-listening (also known has pre-cueing/cueing/cue/headphone cue) in your headphones on the respective channel.
Beatmatch,31yofz,z0mz0m,5,Thu Apr 9 04:35:13 2015 UTC,"I suspect you're doing one thing wrong when in point 7 you say that you pitchbend the wrong track - if you're beatmatching you are trying to sync one new song the the song that is already playing, so you don't mess with the one already playing.   Start song 1. After a while, start song 2 (already cued at one beat).  Listen to the train wreck. Stop song two. Move pich to one or other direction and restart song two. Is it worse? Move pitch to the other side. Repeat this. You will arrive to a point in which the beats sound something like this:  O.....O......OO.......O.O.......O..O......O...O  Then use the pitch bending buttons (if available) or the platter to correct this. If you notice that the train wreck is getting worse correct to the other side.  You'll get to a state where you will need to restart song two much less often or even never.  It's really a matter of practice.  Another thing that helps me is, if both song beats are similar and you can't undertand which one is delayed, to change eq on song two in order for it to sound different from song 1.  All this is without changing anything in song 1. If you were playing in a bar/disco that would be the song that people would be listening - you wouldn't want to mess with that.   Finally - start with electronic music. Forget rock, hip-hop or anything played by humans. Electronic music has a constant bpm and is much easier to start. If you're syncing music played by a human there can be small variations in speed that will induce a trainwreck that you're still not able to correct fast enough."

Beatmatch,31yofz,kdhhkdhhkdhhkdhh,2,Thu Apr 9 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"It will take practice.  Know both tracks well help to identify them in the mix.  Describe your headphone setup, what technique are you trying to use? No headphones, one ear, mixing in headphones?  Try listening to the highs instead of the drum.  Instead of playing both at the same time and trying to identify the slower song, try mixing in one track and focus on that track. Is the new track fast or slow?"
Beatmatch,31yofz,dj_soo,2,Thu Apr 9 04:45:27 2015 UTC,"No headphones, I find it easier to practice like that.By drums, I meant Hi-Hats as well but I find it harder because they generally sound the same on each track.  I don't really know the songs because I don't listen to house.I know all my dnb tracks well but I thought it would be to hard to mix for a beginner.Should I try mixing my better known dnb instead even though its faster?"
Beatmatch,31yofz,kdhhkdhhkdhhkdhh,6,Thu Apr 9 04:59:33 2015 UTC,Headphones are kinda essential For beatmatching.  It's how you distinguish the incoming track. it's possible to do without but it will be much much harder and more frustrating.
Beatmatch,31yofz,kdhhkdhhkdhhkdhh,2,Thu Apr 9 06:32:13 2015 UTC,"Its important to know the songs a bit more. Maybe just take a few minutes to study the two tracks and get them in your ear.  Try just letting one play for a bit, and then bring in the next track, that may make it easier for you to hear and identify it. You can also purposefully set the first track fast, and set the second track slow, then just practice bringing up to tempo. Then try the opposite and then randomize it."

Beatmatch,31yofz,junglizer,2,Thu Apr 9 05:14:57 2015 UTC,"It is generally harder to learn with dnb, bit totally possible. It's what I learned with, looking back I think I would have been more frustrated trying to learn with house simply b/c dnb is what got me int dj'ing to begin with. You'll want to focus on the hi-hats though, as the kicks aren't as prevalent."
Beatmatch,31yofz,ehleman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd learn with d&b if that's what you enjoy. The speed isn't really the problem - the faster the beats are coming, the more information you're getting about whether the tracks are in sync or not - but sometimes the rhythms are complex. Try starting with d&b tracks that have a simple two step drum pattern, so the snares hit on the 2nd and 4th beats, and focus on getting those snares in time.   And do use headphones. Beatmatching without headphones is handicapping yourself for no reason."
Beatmatch,31yofz,brokenstack,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:21:24 2015 UTC,Its ironic because now I'm finding dnb is easier to mix as I can actually tell the difference between the drums.I'm still pretty shit though

For LED mapping, I recommend Chamsys MagicQ with the $99 enntec USB dongle.   To make this work you will need an XLR5 male connector on one end of a cat5 cable. Your pinout is described on the page you linked. Or you can spend some more money and just buy the premade version XLR5 to RJ45 http://www.ecolocityled.com/product/xlr5_to_rj45/dmx_led_controls  Going to assume you have RGB pixels in your strips, i'm not familiar with that type. With this power supply you will get six fixtures worth of control (each green terminal block controls one fixture). When you set the dipswitches to address 1, your first RGB fixture in the software will be address 1. Your second fixture will be address 4. So on and so forth adding 3 each time (3 channels for R, G, and B)."

Beatmatch,31xhs6,stevensmi08,4,Wed Apr 8 22:43:13 2015 UTC,You rarely want bass from both tracks playing at once.  There's only so much headroom in the < 200hz frequency spectrum so having both tracks playing that range will sound muddy and messy.    Cut the bass for the incoming track and work out ways to swap out the bass frequencies of the incoming and outgoing track.
Beatmatch,31xhs6,dj_soo,2,Wed Apr 8 23:51:48 2015 UTC,"Someone who I was learning from told me just never mix the basses of the songs. Now i have some reasoning other than it sounds bad. Thanks man, always insightful."

Makes it easier since the basses aren't getting muddled together and the snares of the incoming song are more noticeable and easier to distinguish the BPM difference.  Hope that helps.

Beatmatch,31v35k,BlzHaris,3,Wed Apr 8 11:46:33 2015 UTC,"That's because it's not a standalone unit (CDJs or pioneer's XDJ RX are standalone units for example). A controller is just something which tells the software that a button is pressed/knob is turned/etc. All the processing is done by the computer (running a software), including which function is mapped to which button. Obviously the difference lies in the software you want to use, some allow controller customization to the core (for example traktor), some not so much (for example serato, though they added some customization with the latest update I think).  For pre-listening to tracks a soundcard with at least 2 (stereo) channels is required, some controllers have them built in, sometimes an external one needs to be acquired.  Edit: Some feedback to the controller you linked, it ships with virtual dj le, you can download virtual dj on their website beforehand and see if you like it, it will be worth looking at the other popular dj programs, too. Take a look at them here in the wiki. All of them except serato have demo versions available. The controller should have a soundcard built in, so pre-listening should work.  That said, I wouldn't necessarily buy this unit and rather save up for something like the older numark mixtrack pro/pro 2."

Beatmatch,31v35k,Jinnobi,5,Wed Apr 8 12:09:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you didnt ask any.  To be even fairer, he did answer your possible question, meaning that controllers are standardly universal, and you can map any button/knob to any function, so actually the ""features"" are as many buttons and knobs the controller has, as they can be mapped to anything.  The brand is a big Random one so i doubt there would be mappings available.  So , to round it up, there are no further features that what you can see, as it is 100% configurable."
Beatmatch,31v35k,Jinnobi,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:18:50 2015 UTC,So Its possible to map a map a button to be a sync button or a knob to be a  lpf/hpf  knob
Beatmatch,31v35k,christianjackson,2,Wed Apr 8 12:25:03 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. Check in Traktor Preferences for the mapping tab, you have to select the function manually and then assign it to a part of the controller via the ""learn"" button"

Beatmatch,31v35k,zoink43,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:16:05 2015 UTC,How do I map keys/knobs to certain features
Beatmatch,31v35k,zoink43,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:26:22 2015 UTC,"Well this entirely depends on which software you use. I've only remapped things with traktor, I found this quick demonstration on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGYU15D5QaM  Of course you can get much more crazy with mappings. If you buy the controller you've linked and use it with traktor you most likely have to map everthing by yourself as this brand is very uncommon and not many poeple use this controller, but ther exist entire databases of mappings for more popular controllers (like maps.djtechtools.com or on traktorbible).  Here is a video on how midi mapping in serato works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnrtsmxtICY  If you decide to go for serato, give us a heads up first as there are some things to consider with the serato software (certified hardware needed, serato dj upgrade not included, etc)."
Beatmatch,31v35k,zoink43,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:34:54 2015 UTC,"Serato seems fine, just wondering if I use up a button on the controller then I lose another function , which seems to not work out very well."
Beatmatch,31v35k,zoink43,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, the button either does both commands or one is lost, but it is very likely that the filter knob is already thought of in the pre-made mapping on serato.  The thing with serato is that it requires certified hardware and there are two versions, serato intro and serato dj. Some controllers already come with the the full serato dj, some require a paid upgrade, but chances are the intro version is enough for you, a list of all certified hardware and a feature comparision can be found here:  http://serato.com/hardware/all/controllers  http://serato.com/dj  http://serato.com/hardware/all/controllers  Also be careful if you have an AMD processor: https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202553000-Problems-with-PCs-using-AMD-processors"

Beatmatch,31tdux,SebLiz,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:33:39 2015 UTC,Learn how to use the jog wheels to sync your tracks instead of relying on the Sync button. All cdjs that I know of (if im wrong someone  correct me) do not have the sync button or automatic syncing so if you master manual syncing you are at least 60/70% ready to hop onto cdjs.   The rest is knowing how to browse through your music library from just staring at a little screen instead of your computer screen and overcoming the overwhelming appearance of the mixer. Which has basically the same knobs as a Traktor controller plus some other 5 or so knobs  Once you manage to master that. Going from traktor to cdj's shouldn't even matter.

Take a look at the DJWorx article on entry-level studio monitors for DJs.   You should never use studio monitors for any type of party or performance. Doing so can damage them beyond repair - always use PA speakers / loudspeakers.
Beatmatch,31qxo9,Mr_RD,2,Tue Apr 7 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"yeh they will fry in a house party, for djing i have rokit 6 they are bloody loud but again not suitable for partys because people in a group will be louder,youll be asked to pump them up and next thing you smell burning and hear cracking and then silence followed by a puff of smoke and disappointment"

Beatmatch,31qxo9,djdementia,-1,Tue Apr 7 15:41:40 2015 UTC,The only reason I was looking at buying them is because of the deal on massdrop.   Then do not buy unless you are a music producer that will only be using them for producing and not for DJing.

Beatmatch,31qxo9,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"The argument is more that you're spending unnecessary money on studio monitors when a cheaper hifi system will generally do the same job.  If they're on sale, it's not a bad purchase..."
Beatmatch,31qxo9,djdementia,2,Thu Apr 9 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"If you are on a budget and a music producer this is a good buy.  Rokit 5s are good first monitors and that's a pretty good price too.  There really isn't anything amazing or special about the KRK Rokits but they are a good balance of price and quality - and that's what makes them so popular.  If you can save up it's of course better to get a pair of 8"" monitors but not many can afford that early on.  You can always try to save up for a sub later.  Now the flip side - why do you want studio monitors?  Are you planning on being a music producer in addition to DJing?  If you are, then go ahead.  If you are not then please do not buy studio monitors.  They are not for DJing.  They are not for parties.  They are for producing music, that's exactly what monitors are for, and really nothing else.  Studio Monitors are a specialty speaker for a special purpose.  You wouldn't go buy a Lamborghini to take off roading in the desert would you?  It's a specialized car made for smooth streets.  Same is true of monitors.  I'm a long time guest DJ and new producer.  I have a pair of 5"" Tannoy monitors at home for producing.  I do not dj or practice with them.  For DJing at home I use a set of high end (but discontinued) PS style 2.1 speakers with a large subwoofer.  You are much, much better of DJing with 2.1 PC speakers than studio monitors.  I recommend either of these which will work for a house party and practice:  http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-980-000402-Speaker-System-Black/dp/B003VAHYTG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428423691&sr=8-1  http://www.amazon.com/Klipsch-ProMedia-Certified-Computer-Speaker/dp/B000062VUO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1428423804&sr=8-2  But really any 2.1 PC Speakers with THX will do a good job.  No you don't actually need THX but if it has THX it will definitely get loud enough and the quality meets a certain 'standard' that will work great for DJing too.  tl;dr: Using Studio Monitors to DJ with is like using a specialized sports car to off road with.  Don't fucking do it.  If you are on a budget and can't decide between a studio monitor and regular speakers go with the regular speakers - they are more versatile."
Beatmatch,31qxo9,Mr_RD,2,Tue Apr 7 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"If you can save up it's of course better to get a pair of 8"" monitors but not many can afford that early on. You can always try to save up for a sub later.   Bigger is not better. Everyone's needs are different. I've used everything from 4"" to 8"" studio monitors at home and in my untreated room 8"" monitors sound terrible. I had to play with a number of configurations before deciding that 5"" monitors with a sub was the way to go for the results that I wanted."

You wont ""feel"" ready, but you probably will be.  Also, I am a big proponent of practicing live - shit happens that you can't simulate, but how do you recover? You will make a mistake, you are human - how do you get back on course?  There is a whole skill set you can't practice at home.  After about a month or so, I would not turn down any gig just because you dont ""feel ready."""
Beatmatch,31pebv,J_Harker,2,Tue Apr 7 07:36:15 2015 UTC,I think 2 months.    I was unemployed at the time and partying a lot so I was regularly practicing 4+ hours a day when I wasn't out watching other DJs work.  Hung out at a friend's house who was starting a night in town and brought records and he booked me to open which I did for like a year straight playing to staff and the occasional early clubgoer that would show up.

Beatmatch,31pebv,dj0ldguy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:48:41 2015 UTC,I play hip hop and R&B and I think I practiced on my turntables for about 7-8 months before I felt comfortable gigging. Not sure if there's a smaller learning curve with a controller.

Beatmatch,31pebv,hobbbz,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"I think I waited almost 4 years or more before I played in front of people, but I never had any intention on playing in front of people. I was perfectly happy messing around in my bedroom by myself or with a few friends just hanging out because it was just fun to me....still is. It was seriously all that I did. Didn't have a job at the time or went to school or anything, so it was pretty much all day, every day, just for the fuck of it.   The first time I played in front of people at a party was kind of an accident and I was not at all prepared to do it, but after that experience, I started getting thirsty to play in front of people. It was kind of addicting to be able to control a crowd and to watch a sea of heads moving according to what I was manipulating on the mixer. I don't have any regrets, but if I had the opportunity to do it all over again, I would have tried to play in front of people sooner than I did because the lessons you learn playing in front of people, you obviously cannot learn by playing in your bedroom. I also think that after that experience I saw DJing and mixing in a totally different perspective which made it even more fun."

Too many people think too much when DJing and it holds them back. I'm not saying don't think but just listen to what you're doing instead of following a recipe you think makes a good mix.
Beatmatch,31ps61,paleoisacult,5,Tue Apr 7 05:01:11 2015 UTC,"people still use CDs?  When I was on vinyl, I would organize by BPM, but since most of the stuff you're playing tends to be in the same tempo, I'd organize by energy maybe.  Another thing I'd do is try not to burn too many songs per CD.  2-4 per CD maybe so you have options.  Either that, or burn doubles of eveything so don't miss out on mixes because two tunes are on the same CD."
Beatmatch,31ps61,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:00:36 2015 UTC,"Since I avoid playing the same artist back to back, make sure you have most CDs made up of one artist, or as few as possible.

Beatmatch,31ps61,Con1750,0,Wed Apr 8 12:49:50 2015 UTC,"If I may, a side note. Your intentions are golden. Wanting to adhere to consistent keys in your mixing is a noble practice. I think it would be extremely valuable to you to migrate to a DVS system, mainly so you wouldn't have to burn and sort all these CDs by hand (and take it from someone w 11 years working, Burned CDs go bad FAST)   Once you go DVS you can digitize your entire library, and either use Mixed in Key to analyze your entire library by key or use a platform with key analysis built in like Traktor.   You can still use your CDJ's and a mixer as your controller.   Otherwise, may I inquire why you haven't considered DVS as an option?"
Beatmatch,31ps61,YoungHef,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"Im pretty new to it, and I'm not too knowledgeable about the digitisation options available. How would DVS work with my current setup?"
Beatmatch,31ps61,YoungHef,1 point,Thu Apr 9 08:47:55 2015 UTC,"Well DVS can be controlled via just about any controller or control vinyl or control CD on CDJs. I'm assuming you've got an analog mixer, all that's needed is your regular setup, a laptop with a DVS platform like Traktor or Serato, control CDs loaded into your CDJs and a sound card that converts the audio of the control sound to a digital signal that manipulates the DVS.  I'm a huge Traktor and NI guy. NI's got a whole assembly to take you from analog hardwear to DVS.   http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/traktor/digital-vinyl/traktor-scratch-a6/  If the price tag is too much, you can always piece it together, pickup a used or non-NI sound card etc.   But that'll get you to the point where you're managing your library digitally and that's a huge burden off your time. It made the world of difference when I switched from carrying around 30+ pounds of vinyl to gigs to only having my two control vinyls and my library on my laptop."
Beatmatch,31ps61,-Theezer-,0,Thu Apr 9 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"I play with USB's in the club, but at home I also have CDJ-1000MK3s, so I organise a lot of my tracks in a way that they are also useful for putting on my CD's.  First of all, I label the individual tracks by BPM and key, for example:   123(7B) - El Ritmo De Verdad (Franky Rizardo Remix)   So basically, my tracks are organised like:   <BPM><(KEY)> - <SONG NAME>   After that I organise each song on genre and by energy level, or by how much the audience will like them. So, for example, I have CD's which are called:   Trap - Bangers Trap - Normal Trap - Low   By organizing everything in this way, all of my tracks are on CDs with the genre and energy level, and the songs on itself are named with the BPM and key.  I hope this was useful! If you have any questions, feel free to ask them."

I've always found that people care more about singing along than the actual music, especially after a few drinks.   I'd also categorize your stuff into 2-4 different crates that let you stay within genre. Deep House, Progressive House, and Electro/bounce are good starters. I try to stay away from like big room bangers because only a small set of your crowd tends to get it, and it can turn off another large subset. But no one is getting turned off by a bounce track.   Then I'd do another folder filled with songs you know people will dig no matter what. Boneless, Levels, Animals, Summer, Titanium etc. All the cheesy shit that will get you ragged on by other house junkies will sometimes save a crowd that is starting to wander away."

Do anybody know if there's a major difference in sound quality between a MBP's line in and and external sound card?
Beatmatch,31nl79,voeljediebass,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"Is there any specific reason you want to record directly to Audacity?  If you're looking for an easy way to record, you don't need to record to Audacity. The Xone 92 has a ""Record Out"" which lets you record directly to a digital recorder (e.g. Zoom H1, Tascam DR-05) which is arguably a cheaper and more reliable way of recording. From there you can plug and play on any computer and modify / compress the recording any way you want.   In terms of sound quality - Audacity will record exactly what's coming out of the mixer as is. Your bottleneck will be in the quality of your tracks / CDs. Many digital recorders allow you to record MP3 and / or WAV, but when you share the mix or upload it online you'll probably be exporting in MP3 @ 192kbps."
Beatmatch,31nl79,Mr_RD,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  I suppose the only reason I'm not using a portable recorder is because I'm at home with my computer sitting right by the decks.   Good point on hosting music online. I'll typically put it on Soundcloud, and I'll be updating my website with larger files for download.  I was eyeing the Scarlet 2i2. Just not sure if it's overkill, and what the best way to use it is (outlined in the OP)."
Beatmatch,31nl79,Mr_RD,2,Mon Apr 6 19:41:31 2015 UTC,"Makes sense then, although that Scarlett 2i2 is more expensive than what you would pay for a digital recorder. I have a friend who uses a Scarlett Solo to record directly to a MacBook Pro and it does the job well.  I've only ever used Record Out on the 92 for all recording but there shouldn't be a difference in signal path between your outputs. Recording over USB isn't a problem and you still preserve the quality.   Once it goes on SoundCloud or Mixcloud it'll be compressed regardless. If you're uploading 320kbps on your website then people may be able to tell the difference between 192kbps and 320kbps but in terms of recording onto your computer through a soundcard, the sound quality will be preserved."
Beatmatch,31nl79,Mr_RD,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for this.  I suppose my concern is that if I used one of the Scarlett units, the only input is an XLR. So I imagine I'd either use the 92's 1/4""-inch output (Mix 2 or Boot) via a 1/4""-to-XLR wire?"

There are arguments to be made for pre-planning your set and there are arguments to be made for winging it... There are in my opinion better arguments than both for a middle ground of planning a general feel for the set but not pre-selecting the tracks... All depends on you as a DJ and how comfortable or not you are with playing on the fly.  Festival sets are more forgiving as far as stuff the crowd will know... More important is playing appropriate to the time of day and the DJs before and after you. Playing a hard acid techno during a dusk set for example would be inappropes."

As someone who has never been part of the festival scene, it seems like it would be tough to judge what they know and what they may not know. There are so many people paying so many different styles and ways. I feel like i could def go play a festival, but i doubt myself with music selection. I feel like the stuff i'd want to play would be the stuff the headliners would also want to play. I have a tendency to over think stuff like this all the time, and then doubt myself. Then i talk myself out of it. I really want to make the move from only open format, to playing at a festival.

Beatmatch,31lqo7,darkuplifting,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:45:12 2015 UTC,"Good mix /u/darkuplifting!  Your transitions are clean. They are beatmatched and phrased well. My favorite was the one into The Salmon Dance. Occasionally, there were some minor noticeable changes in volume.   When you bring in vocals, they are a little low to begin with. Use your mid EQ to adjust them in your cue before you begin your transition. You can lower the mid EQ and you increase the volume fader to keep the vocals even.  Careful with playing songs outside of their bpm range for too long. Ideally, you'll want to play a song at it's natural bpm, especially if vocals are included. This isn't a hard and fast rule, sometimes the distortion from speeding up or slowing down a track is desired."

Yeah I was quite happy with the transition in to The Salmon Dance although I felt at the very start of the transition the vocals from both tracks clashed slightly.  I will definitely keep in mind that during my transitions the vocals need a bit of a mid range boost though, this is something I have noticed myself listening back on mixes they can be very weak.  And I never even noticed playing at a higher BPM changed the sound all that drastically until reading this, something I'll definitely work on is big BPM jump transitions.

I tried to incorporate feedback I received in last weeks thread by trying to keep the beat going this time by always having a low going even in breaks of songs and with double drops. I definitely saw an improvement in the flow of the tracks and overall vibe compared to my first mix.  I was unsure about the 2nd drop in the uptown funk remix as to whether it flowed as there was a weird key change. Also in the transition from Julius Jax - Alpha into Afrojack - Kinga, I think I killed the mid too fast right when the drop ends making the break a bit too quiet.   https://www.mixcloud.com/hastin-lam/20-track-edm-party-mini-mix/  Any and all feedback welcome.

The second drop in Uptown funk does sound kinda strange (probably because it happened too suddenly), but I don't really see anything wrong with it. Transition into Circa sounds very good. I felt like the transition from Circa into Raise Your Head was kinda too sudden. It would probably need better phrasing. The next transition into Take Your Breath is pretty good. The transition into Wolf is too sudden, maybe you could have waited for couple more beats before you started it? Transition into Make It Right is solid. Next 3 or 4 transitions as well. I loved the transition from Booty Bounce to Alarm. I feel like transition into Psycho is too early. Transition into Ready could be better I think. You are right about the transition from Alpha into Kinga, I think you should have gradually turned down the mids and also start with Kinga a bit earlier.

Digging the intro, love when people ramp up mixes with something different Transition into the Flux song was great Transition into Juicy J was a bit more abrupt.  Slower BPM?  Could also be a change in the vibes between the songs. Love Guts FYI, nice choice.  This segue was a bit jarring too...seems beatmatched but maybe work on the phrasing a bit more.  The mashup you did is on point though, good work. Transition into Timbaland was tight - solid hip hop fader slam type of transition.  Awesome blend you've got in this song too. Hennessey transition worked, but it's another big vibe change in terms of the energy levels.  Halfway through the song it sounded like you brought in Drop it Like it's Hot added some reverb or something? At 9:37 it sounds okay when it goes into the chorus, but maybe gradually bring it up until that point for a smoother break.  Like the long transition into the Diplo mashup Bringing in Chocolate Boy was good, but some of the vocal overlapping made it a bit muddy.  Phat song and that drop worked well though. I like the Booty Too Fat as the next song.  Only rec I would have is that the bass seemed to go from pretty heavy in BAB and then the beginning of Booty Too Fat wasn't as bass heavy until a few bars further in, so maybe go for a long transition or figure out the phrasing so you could keep that bass going. Nice blend of the Hud Mo and Drake / Lil Wayne Jarring transition into that Unknown tune - sounds like the song just ended and you started the other one.  Add some echo or reverb or something from the previous song to keep the flow going. Next blend worked well, good job with that mashup Transition into Promesses worked well Transition into the Panda Bear tune worked well also   Overall I dug the mix.  I'm more of a classic hip-hop guy, but it was cool hearing new eclectic / electronic hip-hop songs with some other obscure tunes.  My piece of advice would be work on your song selection or arrangement because some of the transitions had totally different vibes as I mentioned above.  Besides that, a little work on some phrasing or general transition methods.  Also not sure if it warrants a ""BBC Essentials"" title, but what do I know.  This is just some constructive criticism, take it for what it's worth, but keep it up...refreshing to hear other tunes on here besides club jammers."

I know that 25 minutes doesn't seem like a long mix but I put in a lot of work in this mix and it seemed longer to me haha.   The mix itself contains 19 songs because I wanted it to sound very interesting. Maybe I gone too far with that. I've been DJing for about 3-4 months and I've recorded this mix only using my pc since I still didn't buy a controller.  Hope you like it.   I'd love to get some feedback on transitions and phrasing of this mix.

Beatmatch,31lixs,HaastenDazs,3,Mon Apr 6 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if this sounds too harsh, but right off the bat in your first transition into I am you, either the keys aren't compatible or the mids are clashing too much. Your second transition happened after the phrase finished by a beat which made it sound too unexpected. The next transition into Ghosts was off as well as Virus faded too quickly.   One of your better transitions was from Ghosts into Alvita, the phrasing and swap between the 2 songs was decent. Focus on this part in particular and remember what you did so that you can apply it to your future mixes as this is what you want to work towards for smoother transitions.  Overall most of the transitions were off because of phrasing or key mismatch. You started your transitions at odd counts in the phrase throwing off the flow of the songs. With the key mismatch, look up Camelot system. Your track choices were good but due to the key mismatch they clashed too much. It may have flowed better if they were in a different order such that the keys melded well together. It is hard to make a completely smooth transition without a controller. Maybe look into getting a starter/ beginner controller which aren't that expensive compared to the more intermediate or high end ones. The ease into which you can make a smoother transition by playing around with the faders/filters/EQs will make a world of difference. For now, I'd say, watch some of Ellaskins tutorials on youtube or DJTLM's channel. Both offer great advice.   This is a great mix to learn from. Best of luck."

I do find the key analyser to be accurate enough, though I mainly use it as more of a learning tool or if I'm stuck on trying to find a suitable song to transition into.

I've been mixing now for about a month and I just want to get some critiquing on how I'm progressing.  I know I messed up some parts which were obvious to me at the time, but anything else that I may have missed I'd love to get some feedback on, as well as track selection and my transitions. Thanks in advance!"
Beatmatch,31lixs,HaastenDazs,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to type this as I listen. The switch into Legacy from burn was well done. You may already know this since you said you know you messed up some parts but you started outside mid phrase which threw the mix off. The chop into crunk was in time but due to the energy/overall vibe of the 2 songs, it sounded weird. A less ""airy"" drop with more ""strings"" would be more appropriate and in line with how the outside feels if that makes sense (a more similar drop to the original song). I get what you're trying to do though. Also right before you chopped into crunk, the strings of outside are still going and haven't finished playing out which is also why it sounds unexpected. Transition into knock you out was good. You crossfaded out too fast from knock you out into one day, you should have extended it a bit so it faded out in phrase. Its alright to have a beat going while the vocals are going though I can see why you tried to do what you did. If anything, maybe echo knock you out  out so that it sounds less abrupt (thats just one possible suggestion). Going into wizard from one day was alright, it worked but just something about it didn't work for me, it might have been the fact that you're going from a very chill downbeat song into something too upbeat. You want to do that more gradually, build up to it, get the crowd warmed up before you drop something harder. For example, you could use a house song. Overall, the track choices could have been better but your phrasing is decent. The phrase mistakes in there you probably caught since most of the other ones were in time. I'd say that's a pretty good mix for a month of practice. Listen it to it again and again seeing what you can do to improve it and what you did right. You're on the right track though, keep it up!"
Beatmatch,31lixs,iScopedThePope,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I realised that change into Crunk as soon as it happened, there just wasn't enough ""umpf"" in it to cover the huge buildup from Outside. I really despise the drop in the Hardwell remix of that song so I attempted to chop Crunk in but the differences just didn't add up.  Going into One Day from Knock You Out, I didn't realise there was actually so much left before I cut into One Day, which is just my fault... I was a bit on edge mixing straight into vocals it kinda caught me off guard.   Good point on the mix from One Day to Wizard, I usually wouldn't go for such a drastic change in style so quickly but I felt like I wanted to climb back up for one big drop before I finished within 30 minutes. Had I been dj'ing live, Wizard would have no doubt been 3/4 songs down the line after One Day.   Really appreciate the feedback, thanks so much!"

Totally fine for a beginner (and I actually had my pair for 4 or 5 years until I could afford something better), although you'll definitely want to invest in some good needles. I'd recommend Shure M44-G's. Those tables don't have the best torque, so you'll have to develop a light touch but good needles will make a world of difference in tracking. You will probably want to pick up a different mixer sooner to later though. That Behringer is probably on it's last legs. Pioneer DJM-250 is good."

As for needles, I don't know what they're selling the tables with (not much info) but I'll probably have to upgrade them regardless.  As for the mixer, I'm wondering what kind of condition it really is in, but seeing as (at the current price anyway) it's basically free with the TTs it doesn't bother me. I'd probably have to get another one eventually anyway.  Thanks!"
Beatmatch,31l0cj,junglizer,2,Mon Apr 6 03:06:10 2015 UTC,My advice on the mixer is to wait a while if you can and get a handle on your style and maybe what you want for features and upgrade to that. I'd check out Reloop and Denon as they both make solid stuff that is often overlooked. I bought a DJM-707 (to replace the crappy Behringer mixer I got initially) quite a long time before I upgraded my tables.

Higher end mixers/controller setups are meant for that but that isn't the point right now. The point of these two controllers is to learn the basics before you move onto bigger gear.

It's noticeably larger and wider. Not sure if the build quality has changed, but everything looks more professional and less toy-like. The jogwheels are totally different-looking - the old ones were almost completely flush with the rest of the controller, and these have some height to them. The pitch faders are now full-sized (100 mm), and is placed to the side of the jogwheels. The transport controls are now made of metal, and have been rearranged to a Pioneer/CDJ-style layout. The pads have been moved to the front for easier access. There's a new Pad Mode - not sure what it's for. It now has a Master Output VU meter. (It doesn't appear to be possible to change it to show Channel VU, unfortunately.) Master Gain has been changed from a third line fader to a knob. There are now dedicated filter knobs. (No gain knobs unfortunately.) There's a touch strip for quickly scrubbing through tracks and controlling FX. The headphone and mic ports and controls have been moved to the front."

The resonance on the DJM is a little on the extreme side so just ramp up whatever resonance controls you have available. There is really no other way. You could perhaps use a parametric EQ and set a high Q value for a HPF. I do think there is a nonstandard shape to the DJM900 since it sounds so unique, but I haven't had time to do an analysis on it."
Beatmatch,31gbhh,christianjackson,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:57:38 2015 UTC,There is a DJM filter in Traktor: http://i.imgur.com/Tw0Qy2l.png. Just select the Filter:92 and set that effect deck to advanced in the Effects menu. Like the real DJM you have one button: anti clockwise for a jennifer low-pass filter and clockwise for a high-pass filter. There's even a seperate knob for the resonance. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well for knobs without a 'lock' at 12 o clock. Another way is to untrigger the DJM knob and use the seperate high-pass knob with high resonance.
Beatmatch,31gbhh,voeljediebass,1 point,Sun Apr 5 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"Filter: 92 is an emulator of the Xone 92 filters, not the DJM. Ladder is the one that is supposed to emulate the DJM ones, either way, your advice is the same one i'd have given, Single effect tray with a filter 92 , having full knob turns separate for HP and LP with a middle Resonance knob"
Beatmatch,31gbhh,Jinnobi,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:09:50 2015 UTC,Of course it emulated the Xone 92 but it literally has a DJM knob

Beatmatch,31ey67,hellr1,5,Sat Apr 4 12:49:23 2015 UTC,That's how old school house music was born in Chicago ... Live production... The 808/909 keeping the beat... 303 for some acid bass...
Beatmatch,31ey67,Tastygroove,2,Sat Apr 4 13:26:16 2015 UTC,I use three decks in traktor .. the fourth deck I use for a live input for my TR-8. I also changed my X1 to start stop the midi clock and to sync my drum machine to traktor.
Beatmatch,31ey67,kunho,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:54:10 2015 UTC,Seriously considered getting a TR-8. Have you had a chance to compare it to a Maschine or a Push?
Beatmatch,31ey67,hobbbz,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:27:49 2015 UTC,Its not really able to load samples like maschine so you either have want 808/909 sounds or use it as a controller for other software.
Beatmatch,31ey67,Derezzed_Iben,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"Okay help me understand this since i don't own a TR-8, Ableton Push, Maschine, or Traktor Kontrol, but intend to incorporate a step sequencer jnto my setup eventually. You're saying that your options with a TR-8 are: 1. to slave it to one of your inputs on the mixer and to Traktor  Kontrol, allowing you to easily sync it with the track, but limiting you to a few samples built into the sequencer. 2. To run a separate production/performance software alongside Traktor, giving you access to as many samples as you want but forcing you to time it by ear. Is that about right or am I way off?"
Beatmatch,31ey67,hobbbz,1 point,Mon May 25 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"more or less, but I think with #2 you don't have to time it by ear as Traktor will send midi clock to other software, which can time the sequencer and still receive notes for custom samples.   But unless you're doing some serious orchestrated stuff, just play the thing live through an audio channel. it's super easy to flick the dial and set the BPM to .1 precision"
Beatmatch,31ey67,Derezzed_Iben,1 point,Mon May 25 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"Cool cool cool. That sounds like a good way to go. I have a grand design in mind that is going to take quite a bit of time and money to put together, but the results will be so sweet."
Beatmatch,31ey67,antunica,2,Tue May 26 01:27:05 2015 UTC,I rock a push with a db2 and two x1 myself. Would highly recommend this setup as it allows for tones of creativity with sets. I love adding some live production elements to my sets :)

Beatmatch,31ey67,FishFinderPhil,2,Sat Apr 4 21:32:23 2015 UTC,if you need any help with anything let me know
Beatmatch,31ey67,zoink43,2,Sat Apr 4 23:27:57 2015 UTC,"I use maschine linked though traktor with a midi clock. It works fine and is fun. I use two decks on traktor, two decks on cdj and the mic channel for my maschine mikro. If you want to use both ableton and maschine you can run it as a software vst. Also with the maschine you can make it more that 16 beats it's just a little tricky and you have to navigate through a few more menus. I have found ableton as a step sequencer has more options for effects. Maschine when you figure out the interface is easy to use!"
Beatmatch,31ey67,francocroft,2,Sat Apr 4 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"There are also videos of Pan-Pot and Chris Liebing showing off their setups:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnzrT7jaKU (around 10min)  https://youtu.be/-aU5T0jcg1o?t=40m20s (form 40m 20s on)  I eyed on incorporating a step sequencer for quite some time now, but found I should master 4 deck mixing first before I can justify the need of one, but here's what I've found so far (I primarily searched info about the push as I already use ableton):  The push has double the steps, you can have the full 32 beats on 1/16th playing while the maschine has 16 beats on 1/16th (hope I got that right haha). Also the concept of the user interface is quite different. In addition I like the things shown in this video (yes, I know most of the things can be done with maschine too, but I like how most of the things can be directly accessed). I think hardware wise it bolts down to personal preference as both are solid units.  Another plus for me is that ableton is a full blown DAW and live performance tool which let's you do about anything, whereas I'm unsure about the maschine software.  All in all I find it quite hard to decide, but I will most likely go with the push as I'm already familiar with ableton and have all my stuff organised there."
Beatmatch,31ey67,francocroft,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:29:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've just been watching all those videos and found them really helpful! I've got two questions if you've got time;  Do you know if Push comes with a similar sort of sample database as Maschine or is it more of a process of sourcing and organising your own samples within Ableton? and;  I've got a 4 channel Xone DB2, however would I need to get a 6 channel mixer (like Chris Liebing's Xone 92) in order to manipulate volume and EQs on a send/return or could I just dedicate one of the channels on my DB2 for the same purpose?  It's going to be a difficult choice as the Maschine seems to integrate better into a DJ setup (less prep needed) but the Push seems far more capable for production (plus it looks nicer!)"
Beatmatch,31ey67,zoink43,4,Sat Apr 4 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"I have a Maschine and Push. The Maschine library is nicer right out of the box than what comes with Ableton in my opinion, but you can still find tons of free samples online which can all be used in Ableton. The Push is better for creativity I feel like and really improves your workflow for creation. Also you can route audio from Ableton into Traktor if that's your thing. Plenty of guides online. That's what I've been doing simply for the fact you can mix a lot of things simultaneously. The new Stems format for songs will be really nice too for mixing because separate parts of the track can all be incorporated."

Beatmatch,31fbpg,ultramarioihaz,2,Sat Apr 4 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"Surface Pro 2 (i5) can absolutely handle Traktor, though I'm using a DDJ-SX with it, and it's got an external power supply. Not familiar with the Beatloop, but the Surface USB port might not have enough power to drive the device by itself. If it doesn't have an external power supply, you might need a powered USB hub.  Having used the Pro 2 and had a hands on with the Pro 3, I'd recommend the latter, as it's got a slightly larger screen and I feel like it's the better device overall."

As far as when to start blending the tracks, just figure out the phrasing by counting it out. Then just bring in track 2 on the fist beat of a new phrase as well. Remember, you don't always have to blend the tracks at the end of track 1. Just listen carefully for a part where it sounds good to start the mix.  If you look back at the video I didn't wait till the end of the track to start the mix.

Otherwise, practice from the break of one track to the drop of another. You also generally want to fade the base out on the track playing and fade it in on the track you're going in to. This is very general and in time you'll get creative with looping and effects to transition."

Make sure the Load bar never gets full - play a track, mess with EQ's, filter and effect it to hell just to make your computer work.  You should notice when you change buffer sizes the latency will increase or decrease.  Usually latency < 15ms is not noticeable.

Beatmatch,31adw5,MaGomez7,5,Fri Apr 3 08:04:10 2015 UTC,"No one is any good at the start mate.  It takes time, but build up your library and learn it.  Genre, flow, tonality, tempo are all important.  I would recommend consulting the circle of fifths also, it indicates which keys (major and minor) are compatible with eachother.  Like learning to do anything it is all about practice and experimentation. Start off with music that you enjoy and go from there!"
Beatmatch,31adw5,tit_juggler,4,Fri Apr 3 12:05:05 2015 UTC,"This kind of question is too general to provide any specific advice.  Good music is subjective, the songs I love might make you say WTF. If you love the music you are into, and want to have fun DJing those tracks, it is easy these days to get into it for relatively little money.  Not sure what controller you are thinking of. Some things to consider are what software system you want to go with. Do a little reading to understand the differences, but I would recommend Serato or Traktor. If you like DJing and continue and grow with it, these software systems will grow with you and make it easy to transition to bigger/better controllers.  When you start out, you won't be good. You will be spending time learning the software, learning the controller layout, learning the controls, and learning the functions. Once you have a good handle of these things then you will be able to start learning to beatmatch, phrase, and blend songs that YOU like. Start with 10 songs that are similar in tempo, style, and genre. Play with these songs until you start to get comfortable with the song structure and when good places to mix them will be. When I learned on TTs way back in the 90s, i played the same 4 records over and over for 3 days trying to get the tempos lined up. It allows you to really know the songs inside and out so you aren't guessing when the transition or the break or the drop are coming.  Don't get discouraged if you aren't superstar DJ quality immediately. It takes a while, sometimes years, to refine your style and sound to make it effortless. That doesn't mean you can't rock the party with your friends, have fun on your station, and enjoy yourself in the mean time. Good luck and have fun."

Beatmatch,31adw5,PoopyButt_Childish,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:40:40 2015 UTC,An SX for $600 is a great price. Definitely jump on that immediately. You won't regret it later for having a lower quality software system and there is only one step up in the controller world and that's the SZ.

Beatmatch,31969r,DJGaristotle,9,Fri Apr 3 00:11:20 2015 UTC,I've seen a couple of times when a fellow dj was playing and he cut the music going through the PAs. He didn't realize for the whole song because he was using both ears in the headphones. I think its important to have some connection with the house/people so thats why I use the one  ear on and one ear off
Beatmatch,31969r,catroaring,2,Fri Apr 3 01:39:43 2015 UTC,"For myself, I've found it to be the opposite.  I find it much easier to beatmatch and control the volume with headphones on both ears.  As for forgetting to uncue, it is very obvious the moment you start pushing the fader up if you forgot to uncue, and it's a simple fix that is not even heard out of the mains.  I think it just boils down to what works for you."
Beatmatch,31969r,catroaring,3,Fri Apr 3 02:10:52 2015 UTC,"I've always mixed in my headphones, the one ear off just never felt right to me.  Never had any issues with PA volumes or connections with the audience.  It comes down to personal preference."
Beatmatch,31969r,brocuddlez,3,Fri Apr 3 07:26:57 2015 UTC,The only real issue is can you do the one ear method if you end up on a mixer that cannot cue multiple channels?
Beatmatch,31969r,hockeyd13,4,Fri Apr 3 02:15:50 2015 UTC,"You should get used to mixing in and out of your headphones, including one ear on, particularly if you're looking to play out at a bigger place at some point. The sheer volume of the bass, even with good noise-cancelling phones can make it very difficult to mix in-ear with both cups. I typically drop the phones once I've brought the second track in and rely entirely on the monitors at that point, so I know I'm not being fooled by any echo from the club bass or any sort of slight delay the system might have from the headphone signal."
Beatmatch,31969r,EmotionlessEmoticon,2,Fri Apr 3 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"Most beginners play their first gigs at small clubs or parties where there aren't any monitors, so you fully rely on your headphones because there's always a latency between when the sound reaches you and your pressing a button. So I guess you should be able to use both in my opinion.   When I'm in the crowd and the DJ has his headphones on all the time I think something's wrong. I've never seen a DJ do that though."
Beatmatch,31969r,SigmaTheDJ,2,Fri Apr 3 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"Learning both ways is best, then you can decide which works best for you.  The one ear cup method allows you to hear what the crowd hears, which is obviously a good thing.  Mixing solely in headphones is useful if you play at a place where there are no monitors, they're faulty, or they just suck.   One other advantage of IEMs is that some of them offer superb isolation, which means they're kinda working as headphones and earplugs at the same time, so you're protecting your hearing. As a tinnitus sufferer for nearly 30 years, I wouldn't wish it on anyone, so whichever method you use, think of your hearing."
Beatmatch,31969r,brokenstack,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"I only mix in my headphones. The one ear on/off thing is just weird to me. It helps to have a monitor system so you can avoid the ""mix into silence"" which is also just something you should be able to avoid with practice.  It can be really hard with IEMs, though, as mentioned in this thread, if the booth you're in isn't isolated and the bass is overwhelming without blasting a TON of sound directly into your ear, which is dangerous.  But it's also hard to do one ear on/one ear off with IEMs, so I'm not sure that's ideal."
Beatmatch,31969r,Traintraxx,0,Mon Apr 6 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"Gotta know what the people are hearing. When you're playing for you that's fine but, if you're going to play music for others, you've gotta respect their experience and make sure you do the music you are sharing with them justice. This is a basic tenant all musicians and music performers should keep steadfastly. Performers period really. Always respect and consider your audience because perspective is 99% of the... whatever that saying is. It's everything, always."
Beatmatch,3194i3,tractorfactor,2,Thu Apr 2 23:57:04 2015 UTC,Just get some intro edit tracks that begin with an instrumental rather than a minute of minimal intro beats. You don't need effects.
Beatmatch,3194i3,DJ_Theo,2,Fri Apr 3 05:04:22 2015 UTC,The audio effects need... audio to create sound. You COULD use a long gater and run that audio into something but that's so complex and the payoff is minimal. Find some radio/audio loop CDs and see if you can find something that works. Also check out sample artists like Electronic Control Committee and use some of their stuff cause it's awesome.
Beatmatch,3194i3,brokenstack,2,Fri Apr 3 13:12:00 2015 UTC,I was just trying to figure this out. What worked for me was to listen to a bunch of songs until I found one that had a great intro that I felt set the initial feeling of the mix and got the listener interested. This was for a pre-recorded mix. If you're playing live in many cases you'll need to mix in with the set before you so it might help to find out what that dj might be ending with or at least his style of music if possible so that you can transition with awesomeness. If you're the opener then of course use that song with the awesome intro.
Beatmatch,3194i3,kfc_spork,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"My typical intro is to either bring in from filter on a 32 or 16 beat (in time so it sounds like a bit of a phrase) or to just set the ""start time"" of the deck to a very long value and let it wind up from a breakdown."

Who would want to have a dry mic signal going directly to the main outs with only the gain of the input being controllable ? The Electrix eBox44 might be what I'm looking for !

They look like toys in the pictures but are quite impressive IRL. If you have a Guitar Center or similar nearby I highly recommend going to see and play with them in person. The reason I suggested the S4 is that I really love the move/loop knobs with the digital readouts next to them. They are so incredibly useful, easily my most-used physical controls outside of the EQ area."

Beatmatch,310mlq,laserglare,2,Wed Apr 1 05:01:07 2015 UTC,You can learn to scratch with the sx2 and turntables but it's not ideal.  The sx2 is really wide and scratching is a lot easier to do with a smaller mixer like a 2 channel mixer.
Beatmatch,310mlq,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:55:32 2015 UTC,"To get towards your goal, you will need at least one complete turntable. If you have one, get a real record with beats and run it into an input on any controller you have. Practice scratching.   If you want to do more, invest in a DVS setup, until then why waste the money?"
Beatmatch,310dc1,tadhgerty,6,Wed Apr 1 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"count in your head, memorize tunes, and just know your tracks.  A lot of it becomes instinctual after a bit.  That said, you should be able to glance at your waveforms and know if you're off or need to re-cue.  On vinyl, we used to look at the grooves to figure out phrasing on tunes.  Best way to practice is just cover up your screen."
Beatmatch,310dc1,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:18:50 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'm going to set up cue points and beatjump shortcuts so I can automate most of my moves with the jogwheel so I can spend more time listening/reacting to the crowd (once I get that magical first gig). Hopefully I can get it down so I pretty much only have to look at a screen to pick out tracks.  Thanks for your insight, all my favourite producers use CDJs live so I'm very curious about the way they perform despite the fact that I use Traktor."
Beatmatch,310dc1,dj_soo,2,Wed Apr 1 14:53:26 2015 UTC,All of those cue points and beat jumps will just be a crutch to getting a feel for just counting and feeling the music. I would suggest mastering that before relying on additional software features.
Beatmatch,310dc1,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"To my credit I do already count to know when to start the second deck, the waveform is just a secondary guide.   You think it would be worthwhile to practice starting track 2, then jog wheel to where I want to transition to (i.e. first breakdown) in the second track without any visual cues? And then is the goal to have it already playing in anticipation for the transition, or is it equally as good to stop it a few bars in advance and then hit play when you're ready to come out of track 1? Thanks"
Beatmatch,310dc1,dj_soo,2,Wed Apr 1 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's worthwhile to start the mix at the point where you know your transition points will line up perfectly.  You can use beat jump or cue points if you have to, but it's good to get the phrasing down from the start of the track imo.  The idea is you'll have a layered portion of your mix and can fuck about with eqs bringing in and out portions of each track TIL you hit the transition."
Beatmatch,310dc1,SynSyx,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:13:46 2015 UTC,Alright cool. Thanks!
Beatmatch,310dc1,dj_soo,2,Wed Apr 1 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"that's not to say a quick cut isn't going to work for you in some situations.  basically do what sounds good, but the more knowledge you have about your tracks and musical structure in general, the better."
Beatmatch,310dc1,SynSyx,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"one trick that has helped me a lot was to think of it this way:  128bpm = 128 beats per minute (obviously)  1 phrase = 8 four-beat bars = 32 beats  Now, the fun part: 128/32 = 4.0 So there are exactly four phrases per minute.  Transitions tend to sound best when done it multiples of 1/2/4 phrases, or 15/30/60 seconds.  Obviously, a slower bpm will mean slightly longer than one minute, faster bpm slightly shorter than one minute.  But you can use this in conjunction with the waveform and the minute markers to estimate when you might want to start/end a transition.  Most house tracks have a four-phrase (~60sec) intro and a four-phrase (~60sec) outro.  So you can usually tell just by looking at the waveform where that outro is gonna start, match with the lenghth of the incoming song's intro and mix over those 60 seconds"
Beatmatch,310dc1,dj_soo,3,Wed Apr 1 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"I think that's a lot of unnecessary math to work out.  Easier to just count 1234, 2234, 3234, 4234, etc."
Beatmatch,310dc1,brokenstack,1 point,Wed Apr 1 07:48:50 2015 UTC,"you're overcomplicating my comment. the takeaway is that actually doing that counting (to 32 beats) takes about 15 seconds, which you can use to approximate transitions by looking at waveforms"
Beatmatch,310dc1,brokenstack,2,Wed Apr 1 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"There's no real reason to bring time into the equation at all.  Dance music - and especially  electronic dance music - is structured in a way that it's almost always 4/4 with 8-16 bar phrasing.  This will change depending on the tempo of the track so trying assign a time frame in seconds to phrasing is kind of pointless.  Once you get that down, it can be pretty instinctual, and then it should really just be a matter of a quick glance at the waveforms to tell where you are in the track as when to start the mix."
Beatmatch,310dc1,brokenstack,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not terribly different between the two workflows. How's this for a comparison.  With a controller: Go to drop point on Deck B where you want the track to be brought in. Beatjump back 32 beats Wait for Deck A to be 32 beats from cut point (because you know the track) Press Play on B Mix.  On CDJs Scroll to drop point on Deck B. Wait for Deck A to be 32 beats from cut point (because you know the track) Press play on Deck B Mix.  I mean, you don't NEED the screen, it just makes it a lot easier. And if you understand the song structure for your genre it's pretty easy to do this without knowing the tracks 100% since they are pretty similar."

Beatmatch,30xfzh,TheOutdoorsGuy,5,Tue Mar 31 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"It's because Vestax has a better build on all of its controllers than the entry level Pioneer and Numark controllers. Vestax has full metal construction on all of its controllers whereas Pioneer and Numark don't. The inclusion of Serato DJ is also another reason. Vestax controllers overall are very hard to outgrow, whereas Pio's entry level controllers are made to be upgraded. The VCI 300 and the VFX-1 do everything the SB does. The VCI 380 is on par with the SX minus the 2 extra channels, and it's half the size and price.  TL;DR Vestax is a company that makes products that hold their value and generally won't break. Pio's entry level controllers are cheaply made and sold as cheap controllers."

Beatmatch,30vsh4,djthrowaway212,4,Tue Mar 31 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"Throwaway because I don't want to attach specific numbers to my main acct...  I DJ two nights a week, 4 hours each night. I make $250/night (62.5/hr) which works out to $26,000/yr from just my residency. I also double up on gigs from time to time, or will take special guest spots/festivals if they pay more than my residency and have someone fill in there... In total I make ~$30,000-$32,000/yr total when factoring that in.  I spend somewhere around $100-150/month on music... so let's call it [$1,500]/yr in direct expenses... [$20]/night on drinks or ~[$2,000]/yr in ""because I want to"" expenses and that leaves somewhere around $27,000/yr.  If that was my only source of income my taxes owed on the gross $30k would be ~$4,500 but you can get creative and register yourself as a business and expense music, your home office, and such so it could be less... but anyway, looking at somewhere around $22k-$24k/yr net. (I do have another job however so am in a much higher tax bracket and I don't expense my music yet so I pay a depressing amount of income tax.)  If you were DJing even more nights per week 3-4 is reasonable is a big city you can make more but week nights tend to pay less than Fri/Sat. Mobile (weddings, etc) work can also make you a lot more money but the expenses are higher and the hours longer/work harder."

What are the exact time slots?   Where I live clubs/bars/lounges rarely use time-slots, 1 night = 1 dj. It's the reason for the long sets; My current residency is 4 hours and my last few were all 5.  There are exceptions: ""raves""/parties, festivals, etc still use time slots but nothing permanent does.   Do you have to purchase all your music legally?   If you want to take this seriously and actually make it your job/life, I say yes. There is only so much free music on Soundcloud and a huge amount of it is not actually sound system ready as it's poorly mastered.  In any job where you are self employed and need tools you'll have to pay for those tools; DJing should be no exception."

Beatmatch,30vsh4,hobbbz,5,Wed Apr 1 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"The real money from a local perspective is in the mobile game.  Weddings, corporates, school dances etc.  The startup cost is much higher as you need lots of gear and a way to transport it all, but once you establish yourself, you can make well into the 4 figures per gig if you offer a high end enough product (high end sound system, lights, visuals, stage setups, screens, etc.)  It's much less glamorous than club DJing and the it's certainly not about the music or your DJing and more about pleasing the crowd in front of you, but it's the most lucrative without touring.  If you want to get into touring, then good luck.  You have to produce to really get somewhere and even then, you need to be good at it and good at promoting yourself internationally.  And even then it can often require a great deal of luck to make it.  Only the top 1% are getting rich from DJing and I know lots of established, internationally known Djs in smaller scenes that are just scraping by or only making modest incomes despite constantly being on the road.  you can also try to be good enough to win a big battle type show like the 3style or the dmcs and the like, but that means you have to be really good at DJing.  Clubs can be ok if you find one willing to get behind you, but they are often few and far between with little security.  The market is flooded with Djs undercutting the shit out of each other and there are a lot of unscrupulous people in the scene and they are often running clubs and bars.  The best thing you can do for yourself to break into the club scene is to build a proper following that's willing to come to every gig you do.  If you can draw 100+ people to your gigs, you will be highly sought after and possibly command more money."

Plus, some may find the convenience of 1 unit worth the price, rather than a bunch of modular things. And some DJ's prefer jog-wheels over touchstrips.

Beatmatch,30v7nj,Heyo_Maggots_,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:41:37 2015 UTC,Nope - Unbalanced RCA outputs only on the Z1.  And 3 USB connections not 1 - which may avoid you needing to use an external hub.
Beatmatch,30v7nj,LynusBorg,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:35:56 2015 UTC,"I was questioning this as well. Lets assume we are okay with using the touch strip vs the jog wheels.   Yea the s4 is 4 decks. If we were to use the S4 with remix decks on C and D, would it not be similar to using the F1 with mapping to swap decks?  Besides those differences and the i/o, what else is the difference?"
Beatmatch,30v7nj,TonyBologna69,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:51:33 2015 UTC,"If you make those concessions, then yeah, not a big difference (for beginners / all digital DJ's at least)."
Beatmatch,30v7nj,tmccoy00,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"you would still be missing the EQs on the 2 channels that you run your remix sets throught you can't easily loop a part of a third track in a 3rd track deck to play as an addition to the other two - you can only use them for remix decks no controls for the loop recorder you are restricted to cinch outputs. no extra booth outputs no MIDI in /out to sync it with external hardware The S4 has a Line in that you can use for a turntable, for eaxmple no Mic Input   ...weither you use any of those things depends on what you want to do"

As for connections, seems like you'll only need something to connect from the iPod to the speakers directly.  A quick google search says they use 1/4in connections.  So maybe 2 headed TRS1/4 to 1/8in for the iPod.   Definitely grab a power strip of some sort.   Umm... I think that'll be it.   You might need an audio interface actually...

Also, I suggested the TRS because they are balanced, which will minimize interference, especially in some big mofuggin noise blasters like those lol but that RCA to amp would also work, maybe find some balanced of those and you'll be gravy baby.   Bass will be fine, unless you want to add a sub, which imo, is unnecessary. You're tailgating, not throwing a mini concert haha  But to each his own man!"

Beatmatch,30uluf,C_arpet,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"I see the XDJ-RX being a better tool for you in this case based on your needs and preferences. The advantage with the SX2 is the built in DVS (need to pay to unlock it though) so that you can hook up a turntable for scratching if you're interested in that later.  I have the DDJ-SX (the older model) and it does what I like to do and it does it well. With the XDJ-RX you get more accustomed to the Serato workflow. When I started getting club gigs I needed to retag my Serato tracks into the Rekordbox software, so if you want to save the time and work only in Rekordbox, there you go.  As for the whole ""XDJ-RX closer mimics the CDJ feel"" argument I don't really buy it. Either of the two pieces of equipment will do and once you learn the basics of mixing (beatmatching, phrasing, etc) you can play on anything. My first club gig I brought a USB and without having played on a CDJ before I learned the workflow in 5 minutes. Granted my transitions weren't as adventurous as when I'm working in Serato, but the simplicity of setting up was great."
Beatmatch,30uluf,Methionine,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:47:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  I believe with both you can also connect two phono devices the mixer so I could use a turntable to scratch on the XDJ-RX but I'd be limited to only scratching what physical records I have whereas I could use a time coded vinyl on the SX2 right?
Beatmatch,30uluf,mrclean808,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:34:35 2015 UTC,Correct.
Beatmatch,30uluf,darkuplifting,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:58:51 2015 UTC,"I think for what you're looking for and including the price of a good laptop with the SX2 (so we'll say the set ups cost about the same)...  It entirely comes down to what you think you'd prefer to use, I used to use Serato with a Mixtrack Pro II, now I use an XDJ-RX and I've dabbled with Traktor too and what I'd have to say is (and I'm sure a lot of people would disagree) but they're not all that different, other than the layouts and a few features using the RX via the screen isn't a whole lot different than using Serato. At the end of the day you have all your track info, waveforms and controls infront of you and that's what you need.  They're both great bits of kit and do what they do well, if you're in to more of the controllerism and 4-channel mix side of things then go for the SX2, if you're more in to the having everything in one place infront of you and traditional 2-channel mixing then go for the RX. Another plus is having all your tracks Rekordbox analysed if you ever did play out on CDJs but if you go for the SX2 its not like you can't run them through Rekordbox quickly beforehand.  I will say I considered the SX2 heavily before I bought my RX but I really needed a standalone setup so that made the choice a lot easier... Plus that screen!  I'd personally vouch for the XDJ-RX, but it all comes down to what you think you'll need and what best suits it, I doubt you'll be disappointed either way though."
Beatmatch,30uluf,darkuplifting,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:18:00 2015 UTC,Awesome. Cheers for the info. I didn't think the xdj-rx hadn't been out that long so I wasn't sure if anyone on this sub would have one yet.

Any feedback on whether the 2 trap remixes (Beautiful world and No heroes) I incorporated fit with the energy of the set. I thought the transition from takedown into arsonist was off, but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was. I wasn't sure if the Laidback Luke tracks I used near the end of the mix fit in with the overall feel of the set as I felt they were a bit on the slow side.

Beatmatch,30s5le,Aexibit,2,Mon Mar 30 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"This is a great mix to learn from. Listen to it a few times. Feel the flow of the energy throughout the mix. Find points you enjoyed, find points you didn't, identify what to practice and how to recreate the those moments that sounded great. You should be able to tell where you felt comfortable and where you didn't, just by giving it a listen or two. On Mixcloud, find a dj that you enjoy and puts out weekly mixes. Study how they keep the mix going. PM me if you need a suggestion or two on this, I think I have a few right up your alley. I gave you a follow on mixcloud, our styles are really similar, so I look forward to what else you'll have to share in the future.  You had a real strong start, it was magical. Things slowed down around 15m, which was good, but stayed down just a little too long, you didn't begin to reignite that fuse until much later in the mix, around 40m. It came back to you though, that feeling, that groove. You had a great ending to the mix. I love ending a mix with a big anthem, it just has that great positive vibe to go out on. Use those intros and outros, use some double drops, keep that beat going, that flow grooving, let songs play out. If you are going to use breakdowns and buildups in succession, try to use the second half of the song so you have access to the outro to keep a beat going.  Beautiful world was unexpected and it hit perfectly. It was beautiful! After it hit, and it hit oh so hard, you had a lot of quiet and vocals, it let the energy fall too much. You gotta keep people dancing right after, hit a buildup into another drop, pump it up. No Heroes was great as well. Don't shy away from dropping a Trap song in there every now and then. It's something I'm still learning how to do, but you used them great.  You are right, the transition into Arsonist felt a little off. You can notice another spot you did this going into Robotic. Probably because there was no beat under it to draw your attention while you swapped over the mids, possibility it had to do with the transition happening in the middle of the phrase. No worries, sometimes you just gotta switch things up quickly, no one remembers these things once the beat comes back and they are dancing again. Try layering the buildups and make the swap right before the drop.  Ecco to Space Jungle to Titan was wonderful. That three song combination. It kept you dancing, gave you a break, then lit you right back up! This is your element. Aim to recreate moments like this and shine on. Keep some 3-5 song combos like that in your back pocket and know when you drop them you'll set things on fire. At the end of your combo, it's great to go into songs with a more anthem like feel, gives people a little break and let's them feel that good good, A sky full of stars was a great choice at this moment. Get right back into after the anthem with another combination of songs you know that works, bring that energy right back up!  If you feel Laidback Luke songs at the end there didn't mesh with your style, then perhaps they didn't. Perhaps you just need to find a better spot to play them in the mix. They are big sounding with low energy, they can have a place in your mix, you might just need to learn where that place is. Just an idea, try mixing them with your trap songs, see how they sound together with those."

Beatmatch,30s5le,HaastenDazs,2,Tue Mar 31 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly new to mixing as well so my advice may or may not be on par. Overall, I found the mix to flow relatively well with good song choices. The first few transitions were in phrase and pretty smooth. Well done.  Transition from G-string to let me clear my throat was too sudden in my opinion (maybe add a slight echo). The transition after that into watch out sounded a bit off as well, it may have been because the 2 mids were clashing (which is something I'm guilty of doing too). Aexibit suggested that this was because there were no lows to distract from it while you swapped the mids. Going into where the ladies at from watch out was slightly off as I found that the bass cut out too early from watch out before the bass of where the ladies at started to kick in. This might have been due to cutting out the bass mid phrase.  Its been a while since I've listened to trap so it was nice to hear a trap mix. Good luck and I look forward to your next mixes."

You're calling every step ""beatmatching"" which makes it almost impossible to understand what you're trying to do. Beatmatching is just lining up the tempo of the two songs. You can do that at any point. Then you mix. That's what we're talking about right?  When you're cue-ing your song, you should get the beats lined up immediately. Seek forward on the song to the most prominent, easily understood beat and make sure the tempos of the two songs are the same. This is called beatmatching.  Once the beats are aligned you need to focus on the mix. So you want the tracks to cross at 0:45? Or do you want to start track B at 0:45?"

Beatmatch,30strx,brokenstack,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"If you know you want to mix at 0:45, and there's a beat you can mix with, then just scrub through the track to 0:45, set your cue (works on CDJs as well), make sure the BPM is correct, and just drop the beat where you want it to.

Beatmatch,30twpi,junglizer,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:10:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  I'm pretty strapped for cash, but when I have the option I try to buy ""pro-sumer"" gear. For example I'm happy with my CDJ-900's but wouldn't settle for something lower in that series, if that makes sense.  I figure I'll have to spend at least $450 to get a second-hand Xone 42. That's already a decent amount of money for me, but I don't want to short myself and am OK with upselling so long as it's worth it for my particular needs.  For example, if I got lucky and found a good deal, I could stomach spending $750 on a second-hand 92 or DB2, but only if they were going to offer me things that the 42 couldn't. Seeing that my main concern is sound quality, I suppose that's the most important thing for me to consider between the two. In this case, the DB2 can keep things fully-digital, but I don't know if it's going to be that much better than using analog with the 42.  Thanks for any guidance."
Beatmatch,30twpi,Mr_RD,2,Mon Mar 30 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"The DB2 would allow me to keep things digital throughout the entire chain. How much better is this than having to use analog (eg RCA) on the 92?   If it's convenience that you're after, the DB2 will serve you well. The 92 is full analog. However (and simply put) depending on the sound system you may be able to tell the difference, but most likely not at home.    The DB2 has a built-in soundcard. Will this be any better or worse than a buying external soundcard with the 92?   I love the 92 but you'll save money as the DB2 has an integrated soundcard.   I'll probably never use more than two channels, but I do have two 1200's that I might use one day   The 92 is more suited to vinyl and only real vinyl given its analog build, but I can see the attraction of using a DB2 with digital equipment.    Are these the two mixers I should be looking at? I've eyed the Xone 42   The 42 isn't in the same league. The Xone 62 might be vaguely comparable but I'd suggest evaluating your need for either the DB2 or 92, as functionality and compatibility will outweigh the other factors."
Beatmatch,30twpi,Mr_RD,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this Mr_RD.  I suppose I'm not worried about large systems. Rather, I'm just curious if recording a fully-digital would yield a higher-quality mix than an analog recording. For example, here are two possible signal paths. I'm curious if the DB2 would sound better:   DB2: CDJ-900 digital out -> DB2 digital in -> DB2 usb to computer -> Audacity 92: CDJ-900 rca out -> DB2 rca in -> DB2 rca or 1/4"" out to an external soundcard -> usb to computer   If not, I'd just assume go with the 92.  Thanks again."
Beatmatch,30twpi,antunica,2,Mon Mar 30 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly in terms of signal path, the difference between the two is negligible. Both are professional-grade mixers (the 92 is industry standard) and for DJing purposes you won't be able to ascertain any differences in sound quality between the two.   Again, I'd heavily evaluate functionality and compatibility between the two before you buy. The DB2 has effects and an internal soundcard amongst other features, while the 92 has dual filters and 4-band EQ. There are of course a significant number of other differentiating factors but I don't have enough experience playing on the DB2 to provide more insight."
Beatmatch,30twpi,antunica,2,Tue Mar 31 06:38:26 2015 UTC,"Just picked up a DB2 about a month ago and I had the same doubt. In the end the DB2 won out for the effects engine, built in usb soundcard, and just overall ease of setup.  Let me know if you have any questions about the DB2  EDIT: The only huge benefit of the 92 are the send/returns. By the sounds of it though you wont be using external effects pedals/engines."
Beatmatch,30twpi,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  Correct, I don't have need for send/returns. And the built-in soundcard would be convenient but not mandatory.   As far as recording into my computer goes, I'm still curious if the DB2's ability to keep everything digital will provide a better quality sound than the 92. For example, here are two possible signal paths. I'm curious if the DB2 would sound better:   DB2: CDJ-900 digital out -> DB2 digital in -> DB2 usb to computer -> Audacity 92: CDJ-900 rca out -> DB2 rca in -> DB2 rca or 1/4"" out to an external soundcard -> usb to computer"

Beatmatch,30tvfh,ithinkmynameismoose,2,Tue Mar 31 14:03:08 2015 UTC,Honestly that's just untrue. Here is a video of James Zabiela scratching on CDJs. It might take a little bit of time to adjust but it's definitely doable. The timecode advice below is solid though. (or just put the timecode signal on your USB to have the option of either...).   Personally though I'd just recommend Switching over to CDJ only. CDJ 2000s are capable of basically everything and more than serato so you're actually just losing out on features at this point.
Beatmatch,30tvfh,vTwoPoint,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:58:49 2015 UTC,"If you are scratching, use SZ platters or turntable. CDJs were not optimized for scratching.  If you are talking about the SZ platters already then update the firmware and Serato DJ version"

Beatmatch,30sp2f,funkefresh82,2,Mon Mar 30 11:36:07 2015 UTC,"This is why I feel open format/mobile DJing is so much harder than electronic DJing.  You have to know a wide variety of music from a wide variety of eras and you have to be able to figure out on the fly what people want to hear or you can easily lose the crowd.  I do a lot of open format gigs, but it tends to be seasonal so when I'm not doing a bunch of gigs, I don't listen to current top 40 if I don't have to.  The only way to really do it is to listen to a lot of music, study charts, and go with personal experience.  You also have to really watch and study the crowd and figure it out from there.  If it's a bunch of 30 year olds, then you can probably do some 90s and 80s throwbacks - if it's a bunch of 20 year olds, maybe don't do too much 80s and stick to more current hits.  If it's a wedding, move from the 60s/70s and up to appease everyone.  As you do more gigs, you get a feel for what tends to work universally and create playlists or keywords based on that."
Beatmatch,30sp2f,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:56:33 2015 UTC,It really depends on the audience and how much of a variety of music you actually listen to. if you know your audience ahead of time and have a general idea of what kind of music they generally like then start listening to that. The best thing you can do when playing open format is give them a mix of what they expect and slip in similar music that they don't expect. If they vibe on the unexpected keep it up. Long story short though...listen to music and only play what you've listened to.
Beatmatch,30sp2f,citizenchris099,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:02:27 2015 UTC,"This is how a friend of mine used to do it before the advent of computers.  He'd pick a song and write it down in the middle of a piece of paper. He would designate three songs that it works with, connect them with lines, sort of building a chart. He would then choose three songs for each of those three new songs. This would increase until it filled the page. He would do this for lots of songs.  Now, though, we have playlists. And you can record mixes and test them out. This is the hardest part about DJing and requires the most practice. Build playlists based around energy, times of night, feel, etc., and just fill it with music that only applies for that. For example, make a playlist called ""Opening the Night"" and put only songs in that will work together for opening night. Hell, call it Opening the Night Starting With song X. Pick a song as your first track of the night and build a set from there. Build multiple sets. You don't need to use these religiously, but they are guides to get you from A to B. Build a playlist for energy transition songs. So you want to connect from early night to mid-night high nrg stuff. What will get you there? Build these on your phone while you are listening to music and then test them while practicing.  Curating music is SO important to us now as DJs, since we are showing up to gigs with 10,00000000000 songs, instead of 100 records."
Beatmatch,30sp2f,brokenstack,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"This is basically what I've done in terms of creating lists to use as a guideline. That's exactly how my brain works ha ha. I'm just having trouble figuring out what to put in them. I have a lot of music in them. It's getting the things i forget about in there, then knowing when the right time is to play them. I envy the guys who can go in, and play, and know exactly what they need/want to play. I'm the guy who's standing there drawing a blank then rushing out of stress to find another song. Not always, but more often than i'd like to admit."
Beatmatch,30sp2f,brokenstack,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"So make it harder to respond like that. You have all of those lists, combine with Ratings. Have a Prep list for the songs you KNOW you want to play. Use comments and genre and other tags to make searching easier. My problem is I fall into traps very easily. I play a song with a specific feel and it can be hard for me to move to another feel or genre without forcing myself to, so I end up spinning the same stuff for an entire hour and I get annoyed cause I didn't get to any of the NEW stuff I wanted.  So I have things sortable. I want to play something new? Sort by release date. I want to play something heavy? Sort by genre. Fast? BPM. It makes finding things a LOT easier."

Beatmatch,30pdf2,Jungle2266,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:19:21 2015 UTC,Do you ever feel limited by the fact that you only have two turntables though? Do you have any problems with the device itself? Thanks for taking the time to respond!:)
Beatmatch,30pdf2,Jungle2266,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"Not really, I have an F1 next them too so I can use the remix decks in Traktor or use it to control 2 normal decks essentially having 4 channels.

Keep in mind that this will effect the feel of the jogs during beatmatching. Beatmatching in vinyl mode feels more wishy washy. Alternatievely just press que again (this is what I do). The looping of audio when stopped is normal behavior on every cdj I have used accept for older 1000s. If you let Rekordbox do its thing and use its sync feature to update the content of your flash drives. The only action necessary on your part to view que points is to load the desired track which will que to 0:00 if auto que is on. You can select the que point pou want by pushing the left or right call buttons. Hope that helps."

Beatmatch,30nghy,bodhi8,4,Sun Mar 29 00:07:25 2015 UTC,Read this  http://www.djingtips.com/skills/phrase-matching
Beatmatch,30nghy,maggidk,2,Sun Mar 29 02:51:54 2015 UTC,i just found this site earlier today. the beatmatching tutorial is great. after a few hours working through the drills i've pretty much got straightforward beat matching down pat.
Beatmatch,30nghy,okraOkra,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:10:55 2015 UTC,"Best thing is just practice. It will seem difficult at first but over time it comes naturally. Now I can DJ in my sleep.   Phrasing like other people have said is very important, music sounds very odd if it isn't phrased correctly.  Get the basics of transitions sorted, look on youtube videos, listen to DJ sets of your favourite DJ's and try to copy them, you will find stuff you like and can do.  Use sync if you want while starting out, with Serato though I found sync worked so badly I don't bother with it. You learn to beatmatch very quickly without it.  I would reccomend mixing in key too, you can do it by ear but IMO much easier and more convenient to use a key analyser."
Beatmatch,30nghy,Revorocks,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Songs are made up of phrases, a phrase is 4 bars long but the actual time can vary depending on the BPM of the song. If the you mix two songs together you ideally want the phrases to be aligned.  To find the time of each phrase depending on BPM I use this site, http://www.buzzmachines.com/reviewfiles/Bpm2Seconds.txt  Essentially any number on that site times it by 8, so for example I mix Drum and Bass which is around 174 bpm, site says a 174 bpm measure is 2.758624. Times that by 8 and you get  22.07 (rounded).  So when I mix DnB I always find that start of the phrase (which will most likely be at 0:22, 0:44, 1:06, 1:28 etc.) and then set a cue point. And then hit play when the song currently playing reaches the end of a bar (which for 174 bpm will also be a multiple of 22 seconds so something like 1:50, 2:12, 2:34 etc.) but you can usually tell the end of a phrase by ear because it usually has a variation on it like a break or a drum roll.  From there you can use you headphones to adjust the EQ on the incoming track and when it sounds good slowly bring the volume up on it. Really surprising how little guidance I found online for learning to DJ and I kind of figured this out by myself. I have the exact same setup as you so hopefully this is helpful."

If you were in Paris I'd let you try my Urei 1620, but something tells me that you're not in France.  Rand currently has two rotary mixers on the market: the MP2015 and the MP2016. Both are kick ass products (the MP2016 is actually a remake of the Urei 1620). I'm pretty sure Pioneer had a rotary mixer add-on option for one of their mixers a few years ago, but I've never actually seen it in the wild.  That said, rotary mixers are amazing. You get way more accurate ""touch"" with rotary knobs than you do with faders, which also means that fader intensive types of DJing aren't compatible with rotary mixers. I'd almost go so far as to say that they're made for house music."

This totally depends on your mixing style - I make 95% of a mix with EQs, I find that gives you way more control of a mix than one rotary control could ever give you. And many rotary mixers don't even have EQs, or have only a master EQ, or have only two per channel. Also you can look at a mixer with faders across the club and know which channel is playing, something I find helpful in dimly lit clubs :)."

Beatmatch,30jg0u,softroxstar,2,Sat Mar 28 09:23:55 2015 UTC,"i have an ecler 3.  it's been a solid mixer thus far.  as someone mentioned, not alot of bells and whistles, but get a lot of compliments on the knobs.  ecler is often referred to as the rane of spain, so it's a solid buy."
Beatmatch,30jg0u,Kokkothespacemonkey,2,Sat Mar 28 03:54:47 2015 UTC,i had one for a bit.  the sound is way better than the xone 23 especially with vinyls.  mine kinda just stoped working after a while. probably cause i smoke too much. i tried to dismantle it and clean it. It worked for a bit but now it s fucked again and i cant fix it.  apparently it s a common issue on the ecler to get dust inside. Removing it is not that easy. I opened the thing and  tried to clean every knob and fader : /  i really wish i could find someone to fix mine because i loved that thing. especially the isolator.  Honestly it's way better than most mixers. I mean the sound is the most important thing right ?  A filter would have been nice but i d rather have a good sound than 25 effects.  the kick drums they sound really nice not boomy at all really thick.

I was literally holding on to it because I just loved how well made it was regardless of how much I actually didn't need it. When I got back into DJ'ing recently I really wanted one but just couldn't justify the price for what it does (or rather doesn't do) It really came down to buying another Nuo 2.0 or a Xone 23 and ultimately I couldn't justify the added cost of the Nuo. Both sound amazing but really the only thing the Nuo brings to the table over the Xone 23 is the slim form factor and big knobs."

If not, you'll want one instead of four outputs! Just sending the full signal to two (fullrange) monitors and an additional sub will not sound very nice."
Beatmatch,30j6fv,tilldrop,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yes my sub has a crossover, balanced with my monitors. The Steinberg UR 22 seems nice, but will I be able to connect a microphone using a XLR -> 6.3mm jack converter without losing the full quality of the mic? Also, do I connect my XLR cables from my monitors to the mic/line slots on the front and my sub's RCA cables to the line output at the back?  EDIT: I did some research, my questions above seem very confusing, lol. Let me try again: my monitors (Rokit RP3's) sound very soft at the low-end (<50Hz), that's why I really want to also connect a subwoofer to my interface. This means I need at least an RCA stereo output aswell as either XLR/TRS output for my monitors, and one XLR input for a mic.   I've searched for about an hour and the only thing that seems to fit my needs is the Focusrite Scarlett 2i4. This one, however, is a bit too expensive. Are there any other cheaper ones that fit the setup?"
Beatmatch,30j6fv,tilldrop,2,Sat Mar 28 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"Concerning the mic: The inputs on either the 2i2/2i4 or UR22 are combo inputs wich will work for both XLR and 6.3mm jack cables (XLR is standard for mics  and jack for line level instruments and guitars).  Concerning the sub: First off all there are no Rokit RP3's I think ;-) But I'm sure you are talking about the Rokit 5""? I have them myself and yes they are a bit weak in the low end (not a problem for me, but I use them for music production and not for listening). Anyways. Usually a sub will receive the stereo(!) signal from the interface and than you'll connect the speakers for the higher frequencies (in your case your Rokits) to the sub. The sub will have a cross-over which kind of ""splits the signal"" into the lower frequencies (which is what will be played through the sub) and mid/higher frequencies, which will be routed to the output of the sub and into the tops ( your Rokits). As you can see here: http://bdbo.thomann.de/thumb/bdb1900/pics/bdbo/3757175.jpg There are inputs and outputs on such subs. So you will not need four outputs (two stereo) from the interface, but only two (one stereo). If you intend to use a sub without a cross-over than you'll obviously want an audio interface with four outputs or a small mixer. By the way: There are only a very few cases I can think of where I'd recommend going for the 10s+2Rokits. It'll be hard to balance the levels between subs and tops in case you want to use it for studio purposes. In case that you want it for pure HiFI/DJ-purposes I'd just say sell the Rokits and get some HiFi or a small PA system."
Beatmatch,30j6fv,Hopeless_roman,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:17:02 2015 UTC,"I think I found my problem.. My sub is a relatively old Magnat.

Beatmatch,30hjc6,Jinnobi,3,Fri Mar 27 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"For $60 you can get a very basic controller to use with Traktor. Go for it. If you find you like DJing and want to continue then you can move up to a better system and if not, it's only $60 you spent. Hell, you could spend more than that just going out for one night, no reason not to go for it."
Beatmatch,30hjc6,PoopyButt_Childish,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:31:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I'll pick it up tomorrow
Beatmatch,30hjc6,jamesanator9,2,Fri Mar 27 21:13:05 2015 UTC,This was actually my first controller as well. The knobs and sliders are alright but most were pretty lightly built. Also....don't spill beer on it or it won't work very well :-)
Beatmatch,30fo6j,ehleman,4,Thu Mar 26 23:55:47 2015 UTC,Judging by the Dynamic Sound and Lighting slipmat I'm guessing your in the Bay Area.  I'd say $1000 is too high.  Checking Craigslist you should be able to find 1200's around $350-450 a piece.  If you have patience I see them go for $300 sometimes.
Beatmatch,30fo6j,catroaring,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"Canada actually so it's a little harder to find turntables at a decent cost, but I can definitely find some for a little cheaper just without the flight cases and a further drive out.  Based on the pictures though is there any other obvious signs of problems?"
Beatmatch,30fo6j,lshaped210,2,Fri Mar 27 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"A broken tone arm clip would mean these are not 10/10. I would be careful of further tone arm damage. Test them out before purchasing. Almost all issues can be fixed rather easily. If the tone arm clip is the only thing wrong, I'd pay a max of $800 for the pair."
Beatmatch,30fo6j,lshaped210,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:26:25 2015 UTC,"Okay any tips to test out the tone arm for further damage?  I was gonna pick up the tone arm and move it back and forth and make sure its not not janky, but other then that I'm not sure what else to do."
Beatmatch,30fo6j,PoopyButt_Childish,3,Fri Mar 27 00:36:50 2015 UTC,Use the floating tone arm test used in this video. http://youtu.be/Lq2Rk7_i6hQ
Beatmatch,30fo6j,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Fri Mar 27 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming by band you mean the whiteish band tied around the tone arm? That is a twist tie used to secure the tonearm to the rest for transporting. The little plastic clip that secures the tonearm if fine for when the table is just sitting there, but you wouldn't want to trust it when shipping or transporting. Also, that little clip can be broken easily and no way causes an issue with performance of the table.  Also, that does seem high for the pair, even in good condition."
Beatmatch,30fo6j,lshaped210,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:31:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I emailed him he assures me they're in tact.  Agreed it might be a bit more then the average going rate (I've seen them go as low as 725 usd for a pair here, without the flight cases mind you), but I live outside the city and it's hard to find people selling them around here.   I don't have a car either and he's delivering them for that cost.  If it is in fact 10/10 condition with flight cases for each, I'm fine with paying 1000$ USD"
Beatmatch,30fo6j,morevinyl,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"That is a higher cost for a set of MK2 tables, but if they really are in excellent condition and have the cases they are probably worth it. Do they come with stylus as well? If so, I would say jump on it. Have to figure the delivery is worth a bit as well.  After you get them, make sure you set up the tonearm properly for the stylus type you are using. Adjust the tonearm height, zero out the anti-skate, balance the tonearm, and make sure you are using the correct tracking weight for your stylus. More weight on the needle does not equal better tracking."
Beatmatch,30fo6j,Noctrin,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:13:12 2015 UTC,Seriously watch for faulty tone arm. When the tone arm clip breaks it is usually because something banged or slammed against the tone arm causing the clip to break off. Replacing a tone arm will be around $150 and requires some semi-delicate soldering skills.
Beatmatch,30g7hy,PdxShov,7,Fri Mar 27 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"DJing usually gets lumped together with production when they're really different things. Producers like DVBBS do both (Not Aoki though... He throws cakes instead of DJing).  DJing  -Stringing multiple songs together in a continuous flow  -Transitioning from song to song matching up BPM  -Not making music, but has production aspects with things like sampling, looping, ect.  -Everything is done live  -Using controllers, CDJs, Turntables, ect.  -Using programs like Serato, Traktor, Mixx, VDJ, Torq, ect.  Production  -Using MIDI Controllers and keyboards  -Using DAWs like Ableton, Cubase, Reason, Pro Tools, Ect.  -Done in a controlled environment. Not really something to do live, but there are many exceptions.  If you want to produce, head over to /r/edmproduction. If you want to DJ, tell us your budget and we'll get you setup with  an entry level controller and program that will most likely be a Mixtrack Pro II or DDJ SB."
Beatmatch,30g7hy,Dantejb,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:49:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help, ill checkout /r/edmproduction.  Also I had one question, would remixing songs be considered producing or djing?"
Beatmatch,30g7hy,Dantejb,5,Fri Mar 27 03:13:39 2015 UTC,"50/50. DJs can layer accapellas and instrumentals on top of each other while throwing in samples live, which is technically remixing (Moreso mashing up), but more elaborate remixes involving recreating portions of songs or making your own parts of a song are more production based."
Beatmatch,30g7hy,advocat3,-3,Fri Mar 27 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"How old are you? Chances are if you're over 18 you'll never be as famous as the artists you've listed.  It takes roughly 40-50 hours to master DJing. It takes 5-10 years to master producing or making your own music.   These two acts are entirely different and are often the difference between people who make it and are successful and those who aren't.  Choose wisely. If you live in a largely populated city you'll never get anywhere purely by DJing. Everyone is a DJ nowadays. It's not hard and it's not special.   If you're older and already have a career and you're looking for a way out, DJing is not for you.  If you're 16-18 and you have 8-10 free hours a day to spend on music, then you can dive right in and dedicate your entire life to EDM music. You'll have a decent chance of making a career out of it then assuming you make your own music.  Otherwise DJing should be enjoyed purely as a hobby and something to fill in your free time with and DJ at the occasional house party.  Anyways back to your question. To get started DJing you'll need a mixer, a pair of headphones and music. The Traktor S2 and the Pioneer DDJ SB are great intro devices. One is on the Traktor side and the other is on the Serato side. Serato and Traktor are like two sides of the same coin. They are both pieces of software that run on your computer or laptop and act as mixers which control digital software over a USB cable usually run by your laptop. This isn't the conventional way that the DJs you listed play their music but it is a way to get started. Once you've mastered beat matching and transitions on your primitive hardware then you can think about moving up to more expensive gear."
Beatmatch,30g7hy,Aniahlator,5,Fri Mar 27 06:48:07 2015 UTC,"It takes roughly 40-50 hours to master DJing.   This could not be further from the truth. It may take 40-50 hours to learn how to DJ well enough to blow people away, but that's because most people don't know all of the finesse and intricacies that go into DJing. If you showed up at a competition like the Red Bull Thre3style with 40-50 hours of practice, you'd be booed off the stage immediately."
Beatmatch,30g7hy,Alexcny,5,Fri Mar 27 07:02:25 2015 UTC,Why should age be that important?  A lot of the big name producers are in their late 30's to mid 40's.
Beatmatch,30g7hy,smacbeats,2,Fri Mar 27 16:48:38 2015 UTC,It's not. Age ain't nothin' but a number.
Beatmatch,30g7hy,jacksoncogger,2,Fri Mar 27 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"50 hours is probably an under exaggeration but I agree with what you're saying, as someone who does a bit of both, I would consider myself far better at DJing than producing. I'm not all that good at either though"
Beatmatch,30g7hy,SheepD0g,1 point,Fri Mar 27 06:57:51 2015 UTC,"I just turned 17, and I'm looking at music production as just a hobby for now, and if I end up enjoying it as much as I expect, I'll see how far I can take it."

Even if you're incredibly talented.   That said, follow your dreams. Just dont off yourself when you aren't headlining EDC after ""40-50 hours"""
Beatmatch,309n21,Getto425,36,Wed Mar 25 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"Wow the responses here are hilarious.  The rule of thumb is: don't be an asshole.  If you are going to show up to the club with your S4 and laptop and not be completely prepared to set up, you're an asshole. If you aren't prepared with cables, power strips, and don't show up early to set up (ESPECIALLY if you've never spun there before) you're an asshole.  if you're on a controller, no one should care. They will because, well, they are also assholes. The other DJs might judge you, but they are probably being assholes. If you are professional, and rock out, no one will care. Show up early, be prepared with all of the stuff you need, and know how to set your rig up with no lights. Check the venue out ahead of time, if you can, and get in the booth so you know how much space you have.  I DJ on a controller with a laptop in venues often. No one cares. Then again, I'm not an asshole, and I try really hard not to be around other assholes.  Also, it helps not to suck. But you can suck just as hard on CDJs as you can on a controller. And if anyone has heard a shitty vinyl DJ they know that it can be a terrible experience."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,9,Wed Mar 25 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this guy, however I want to add this:  If you come in with a controller, know how to set up with your eyes closed, but then continue to play banger after banger from the second the club opens, I will hate you no matter how clean your mixes are. Know how to DJ a crowd/club properly first, before you start banging shit out."
Beatmatch,309n21,Purpletech,3,Thu Mar 26 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"100% agree. Not knowing the theory of DJing, and going and DJing makes you an asshole too."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,3,Thu Mar 26 01:18:03 2015 UTC,but then continue to play banger after banger from the second the club opens   I feel like that's what every DJ in my city thinks is appropriate to do
Beatmatch,309n21,cthom412,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:42:48 2015 UTC,What exactly is the problem with this? Just the lack of thought that has gone into the set? Or just disrespectful to the other DJs?
Beatmatch,309n21,nightfire8199,3,Thu Mar 26 15:50:47 2015 UTC,Its not about just playing bangers for a hour. We all can check out the top playlist or mix for the week. You want to induce emotions and movement from the crowd and get them having a good time. Playing just the right tracks after each other with just the right mix and transition is the point. That doesn't really happen when you are not there in the moment feeling the music with the crowd.
Beatmatch,309n21,TonyBologna69,3,Thu Mar 26 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"ahhahh, so just Don't be an asshole, and all will be well."
Beatmatch,309n21,retroshark,4,Wed Mar 25 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"always be humble. knowing you are likely going to get hate for using a controller is half the battle. don't give in to the hate and react. Prove them wrong through your performance, as at the end of the day nobody can hate on anyone who can rock a club on a controller.   The main reason to NOT use a controller when it comes to performing is the fact it looks bad. Its not inherently bad as there are good controllers out there (I use a DDJ-SZ at home) but its just a controller. Withe rekordbox being free, and most guitarcenter/local dj shops having decks you can practice on for free, any time pretty much... there is no excuse to not know how to use them. I knew the functions of a CDJ before ever touching one. Ive still never hooked up my macbook to one, but I know how to do it and have the equipment on hand to do so. I also have all the manuals for any mixer or deck Im likely to use or perform on. In my personal opinion this is all part and parcel of being a DJ. Since old school turntable skills and crate-digging/collecting are no longer the driving force behind what being a DJ is, there has to be SOME kind of hard-work element to it, and this is it in my eyes. Anyone can use a controller with sync mode and play a half decent set, but it takes an artist to be able to do that on any equipment or none at all. Diversity is the ultimate goal for me at least."
Beatmatch,309n21,ultramarioihaz,3,Wed Mar 25 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"I like this a lot!! You bring up a great point, part of being a great DJ is being versatile and flexible. Show up anywhere and be able to put on a killer show with whatever tools you're provided. To me that is art: here's your situation, here's your tools, now BE CREATIVE."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"yeah man, currently saving up for cdj's now. can't wait to get my hands on em"
Beatmatch,309n21,retroshark,3,Thu Mar 26 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"But who does it look worse for? I mean, yeah, know how to use CDJs, I can't argue with that.  But does the crowd care? If the end result is just as good, does it really make a difference? And sync doesn't make mixes work. It really doesn't. We all know this. Sync just matches the tempo, and it doesn't even do that well if the tracks haven't been prepped properly. And then the mix falls apart."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,0,Thu Mar 26 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"look, I'm not disagreeing with you, but fact is that people judge based on first impressions. If you see a guy rocking a controller you tend to assume he's either not good enough to use the CDJ's or he's not allowed to. Either way, its not a good look. Everything in this industry is about looks as much as it is about sound. Im not going to lie, I support some artists who really aren't what I consider to be good artists, however they have a good look, a positive image and they help make my own image look better.   Part of this very complex industry is basically having to kiss ass, tell people they are good when they suck and basically watch the bad guys win a lot of the time. Thats just music biz. You don't have to participate, but you do have to realise that most of what you see is what the industry chooses to let you see... image management, artist styling even equipment choices... its all purposeful and intentional.   Im sure if Zeds manager said hey guy you need to learn to rock those CDJ's, he would learn pretty quick. What I like to imagine is that someone thought it would be a great way to sell traktor S4/8's with the ever-growing trend of only using CDJ's. The argument is perfect: Oh Zedd is huge and he uses a controller... so I could potentially get just as big using the same equipment.... and there you have the means to sell lots of entry level DJ equipment to people who will most likely never progress past the bedroom/hobbyist level. Thats too is fine, but if you want the ultimate reason why people like Zedd use controllers, its probably a combo of it being the easiest to learn, easy to market and receive endorsements from and also helps to create the image that remains relatable to the non-hardcore DJ lover fans who don't care what he uses."
Beatmatch,309n21,retroshark,3,Thu Mar 26 10:38:49 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself on this one. I have never judged a DJ based on what they use, I judge them based on how they sound. And, for me, I go to clubs to dance, not to see some man or woman dance around with some sort of image.  But I think I'm too old school for this modern club scene."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,2,Thu Mar 26 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"possibly a little too old, I like you am not one to judge a musician based on what instrument they use. Its just a reality that anyone interested in 'the business"" has to take into consideration. people are very shallow, especially so in the music industry. Whether you want to be a Steve Aoki or a Seth Troxler... or more of a Loefah or Plastician type of DJ... you're going to have to rub shoulders with a lot of people you don't like, who may not like you or how you do what you do... you have to keep that in mind always because its the people who can't get their heads around this and let the industry get to them on a personal level who don't make it to the big-top. Seriously I can't stress enough how shallow most people are and for me personally, as someone who is immensely self-conscious, anxious and self-aware its been difficult trying to get a feel for this industry. At the end of the day as long as you are having fun, not hurting others or their individual business enterprises (whatever those may be in regards to music/DJing) then nobody is really going to have a lot of negative comments to make about you.   For me its all about making the compromises that will affect me least whilst allowing me to get ahead the quickest. Ill work with anyone; even people I really dislike. Its not personal. If they can make awesome music or they are skilled in an area I am not, I don't let their personality get in the way of possibly collaborations. When you try to be TOO rigid in your beliefs or how you think the music industry should work, it tends to backfire. nobody in the industry wants to hear about how twitter is all fake, numbers are padded, images are manufactured by marketers and a great deal of music is ghost-produced... If you go along with how the industry is and accept it for what it is and how its gotten that way, you are more likely to see success than someone who is against that and tries to make it in the industry with that mindset. It just doesn't work, and that sucks, but its life. My life isn't long enough to be able to both change the music industry and also gain a reputation as a producer/DJ. you can't do both, so I've chosen my path and will do whatever I have to do in order to make my way - so long as my artistic integrity is never sacrificed."
Beatmatch,309n21,retroshark,2,Thu Mar 26 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree 100% with everything you said, so I'm not sure what we're talking about anymore. And I say that with all due respect, since everything you wrote is extremely eloquent, and I agree with almost all of it.  I understand my issues with that perspective. For a while I (when I was a bit younger) believed that if I had the talent it would get me what I wanted. Turns out that's just 100% not how it works and it was a hard lesson to learn. That hob knobbing, and socializing, and attending parties you hate to talk to people you can't stand is part of the game, and it took me way too long to learn that. And we don't want the end result to be ""nobody is really going to have a lot of negative comments,"" we want it to be ""they fucking love us and say the best things ever"" etc., right?  But yeah, you're right. Work with whoever you can to get ahead, as long as you hold on to the important parts of your art that mean something to you. It's not about avoiding ""selling out"" unless you want it to be. I, for example, have settled into my place, and I like where it is. I spin once or twice a month, have a good party in a big city, and have very little interest making a living on DJing. That's me, though.  But, that all being said, the only way these perceptions change regarding vinyl vs CDJs vs controllers is if we make a conscious choice to not give a shit about them. I just think the perception of what a DJ is has changed so drastically so quickly that it brought all these fights up. At first, DJing was about playing music. Then there was a small subset that integrated a musicality to it via scratching. And somehow that became was a DJ IS. My point is that a DJ is supposed to make a crowd have fun. And if I am best at doing that with an S8 and Traktor, it doesn't make me less of a DJ than if I have two turntables in front of me and a 05IVPro. That's my only point. Being a good DJ is what should matter, and what we should encourage, regardless of the gear.  But that all being said, I agree with your post almost 100%. I just don't like that some of it is too true."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"You make some really great points about the speed at which DJing has changed in the recent decade or so. I think its very natural that when a whole demographic of people feel that what they worked so hard to build has been suddenly devalued, and that the exclusivity of being a DJ is gone too. People get very defensive when threatened and so I think as a result of this the whole DJ feud over controllers/mediums sprung up to help those feeling vulnerable exert some control over their self-images.   Its all very complex and like you said, it doesn't make dealing with these things any easier just by knowing the preconceptions exist. We could also go off into a great conversation regarding artistic values and getting ahead in a positive or a negative sense... I love to talk about all of this because each time I do, I take away something new that adds to my overall perception of the industry.   On a more positive note, I do feel that these preconceptions about DJ's and their equipment choices will die out fairly soon. Without pointing the finger explicitly in the direction of the older generation of DJ's (what I would call the originators) it is somewhat mostly them who harbour a lot of negativity towards newcomers in general. Im sure in the days of Mozart and Tchaikovsky there was a certain degree of paranoia about the fact that chamber music was becoming more and more bourgeois and I bet you they are turning over in their graves at the fact that any rotter with a laptop can score an infinitely complex piece of music with little to no practical knowledge in music theory... Its all relative in the end."
Beatmatch,309n21,brokenstack,2,Thu Mar 26 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"We can take this to a private message thread if you want to continue, or we can keep pushing this thread longer. I love talking about this side of DJing, especially the theory, since it's what always gets left behind in the interest of ""VINYL OR DIE"" or whatever.  I agree with you, though, that the preconceptions will go faster than they did when things started moving toward CDs. And I find the older generation, by and large, to be far more accepting than what I consider the middle generation. Those from the 70s and 80s, from who I have met, are slow to move but not as fast to judge. Those who started DJing right before the switch to CDs are more venomous to those who started right at the digital switch. But that's just my perception, and I am the first to admit I can be full of shit.  I actually doubt that those composers from the olden days would care about access. They'd be shocked by it, of course, but they wouldn't be rolling over in their graves. My guess, and this is totally my own projection, is that since they come from an era of little to no access TO music for people who weren't obscenely wealthy, everyone having access to creating and listening to everything is probably for the best. Cause then there are more people making music. And then we all win."
Beatmatch,309n21,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Thu Mar 26 13:32:53 2015 UTC,"Well, not necessarily. I mean, if you aren't an asshole it won't stop others from being one. And just because you do everything right (or whatever someone considers right, since it's subjective) doesn't mean you won't still be greeted by assholes. They are everywhere, telling you you're not good enough. Trust me.  The moral of the story is to work your ass off to be as good as you want to be. Love it every minute, and don't listen to the people who say that DJing requires something. All it requires is music, and the ability to make people feel whatever is appropriate for the moment (you don't want people at an art showing to be dancing, and you don't want people at a nightclub to be sitting around NOT dancing). Beyond that it's all window dressing and illusions."

If you gained fame from being a sensational DJ then you were doing that on CDJs, Vinyl, etc. but if your fame stems from your production, the equipment you use becomes irrelevant because people are paying for your music not your dj skills.  Like said elsewhere, good luck getting respect from club owners and respectable promoters/production companies with your $200 controller and no ability to perform on professional grade equipment."
Beatmatch,309n21,ultramarioihaz,21,Wed Mar 25 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"This the problem with this argument, yes there are shitty toy-like controllers that are total crap, but what about a DDJ-SX? All the functionality of CDJs and a DJM mixer plus more. What about the SZ? Same build quality as the CDJs plus more functionality. What about the new XDJ-RX? That's basically an all-in-one equivalent of CDJ-900s and a DJM-850 with only 2 channels.

The club owner wants it popping the whole night with no interruption, this is why clubs spend thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars on their own equipment. Every Dj uses the clubs equipment thus it removes variables that could leave a lul in the night. It's not just controllers that are frowned upon, it's the Dj bringing their own equipment that requires re wiring/moving etc. I hate on controllers because you're the prick that's in the box twenty minutes before I'm done with my set in my way trying to figure out how to transition your own personalized gear into the clubs gear. It just makes things complicated, here's the industry standards, learn them, be able to use them and do your thing! Nothing wrong with controllers, if every club had an S4 or something else that's what would be used."
Beatmatch,309n21,PoopyButt_Childish,4,Wed Mar 25 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen it happen live plenty of times where the only set up thats happened is a laptop + controller being brought on stage during the final song of the first guy's set, and the controller is plugged into channel 3 or 4 of the mixer and theres absolutely no down time between DJs,  i understand it for abelton users who have multiple launch pads / drum pads etc, but if all you have is an s4 and maybe an f1 for samples, there isn't any real hang up."
Beatmatch,309n21,dankipz,2,Wed Mar 25 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"You are right, it's easy to set up a controller into a channel on the house mixer. The problem is, a lot of DJs that bring their controller haven't played on other gear and don't know how to set it up in a new venue. I think this is the main issue with ""real"" DJs and controller DJs, the guys playing in the club are used to the CDJ setup but the new guy maybe just learned on his controller. There's no fundamental background for connectivity of the components in a booth."
Beatmatch,309n21,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Thu Mar 26 02:53:42 2015 UTC,"i've not got much expirence with club set ups, but my friends have a set up with two controllers and a mixer, and all they do is run the controller into the mixer and use the mixer as the master output. so wouldn't the transition be as simple as plugging an rca/xlr cable from controller to mixer (replacing one of the four cdj's)?"
Beatmatch,309n21,PoopyButt_Childish,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:52:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've done this multiple times."
Beatmatch,309n21,erratic_calm,3,Thu Mar 26 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. If a club has gear set up, that's what you should use (assuming in good condition and functional working order). I've been DJing for 20 years now, some of that professionally, some in the basement for my own enjoyment, and right now part time for extra $ and enjoyment. I was there when the CDJs came on the scene. They were the ""toys"" back then and you weren't a ""real DJ"" unless you played vinyl. (Fuck those cd punks, grumble grumble) The same scenario is playing out now. Controllers are the new CDJ from years back. There are good enough controllers to hang with the ""standard"" club gear and some with more functionality, but this is the rub, DJs adopting the new tech aren't being catered to by the clubs. Yes, a DJ should be able to come in and play on the venues equipment, but I've played in everything from large clubs to restaurants to sidewalks. Not every venue has a dedicated setup for a DJ. I understand the frustration some DJs can have from all the gear getting piled into the booth which sometimes isn't big enough for two people to inhabit at the same time, much less there even being a ""booth"". The real argument here is not about what is ""standard"" it's about DJs shitting on controllers not being professional. If there isn't a standard to work with, you play what you bring. Right now the DJ culture is in a flux where controllers are becoming as powerful (or more so) than the standard CDJ setup. This is making a lot of DJs butt hurt. After all that, my point is controllers are the next wave of tech that may or may not become the standard. If a venue can spend $2k or $3k on the next XDJ-RZ MKII or whatever that utilizes a USB stick and can easily switch DJs, why would they spend the $5k on CDJs and a DJM? Just seems like the argument against controllers sounds VERY familiar to the bashing we did to CDJs all those years ago."
Beatmatch,309n21,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Thu Mar 26 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"I guess the difference with 1200s and then CDJs is there is a standard. With controllers, there hasn't been a standard established."
Beatmatch,309n21,simphon-e,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:20:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you look back at the history of CD mixers, there wasn't a standard to arrive until the CDJ-1000 arrived and even then it wasn't adopted that quickly. Controllers are in the same boat right now. The closest thing out there that could be seen as the next ""standard"" gear is the SZ and what will end up being a more powerful version of the XDJ-RX with a 4 channel mixer."
Beatmatch,309n21,simphon-e,4,Thu Mar 26 15:09:36 2015 UTC,I hate on controllers because you're the prick that's in the box twenty minutes before I'm done with my set in my way trying to figure out how to transition your own personalized gear into the clubs gear.   The feels on this.
Beatmatch,309n21,ultramarioihaz,6,Wed Mar 25 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"I think if you use a controller, you should respect the other DJ's by getting to the club extra early and setting up your stuff. that way its just a few wires and u can get a smooth transition without ruining the previous performers set. Im still a bedroom dj, but just seems like common sense"
Beatmatch,309n21,djdementia,5,Wed Mar 25 20:11:59 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world that would work, however, in the clubs I've played, there isn't ample room to set up alt. equipment, and I have literally held a CDJ up in the air that was playing the track that the club was hearing while some kid put his controller onto the space where the CDJ had been in order to get his controller set up and plugged in."
Beatmatch,309n21,simphon-e,3,Wed Mar 25 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"holy crap, well hopefully people read this and try not to be ""that guy"""
Beatmatch,309n21,PoopyButt_Childish,2,Wed Mar 25 21:17:39 2015 UTC,Hahah I've definitely seen that! And what if the club isn't rocking CDJs? Not like you can do that with a turntable
Beatmatch,309n21,simphon-e,2,Wed Mar 25 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly - the biggest problem with the pro controllers is there isn't enough space in the DJ booths for them.  If there is already a mixer, 2 cdjs, lighting controls, and various other crap in the booth.  The club I guest at does allow controllers - but there is only physical space for 2 laptops and controllers in the booth and usually there are 3 or 4 djs per night.  That means that we have to deal with switching gear or 2 have to be on CDJs.  It becomes a real pain in the ass on 4+ dj nights for sure."
Beatmatch,309n21,DJ_Theo,3,Wed Mar 25 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"I agree it is ego driven, but brand recognition is paramount in all things these days, and Pioneer's CDJs are the industry standard and therefore the default tool for performances. CDJs are just the iphone of the dj world. Club owners have already bought their cdjs/djm and thus expect their djs to use them. It creates less variables in the night, and removes worry about risks of outside equipment blowing speakers, etc."
Beatmatch,309n21,ParadoxSociety,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"This works if there is a standard to play on. Not every venue that wants DJs has gear. I've played for 20 years in every type of venue and a lot of them I've brought my own gear to. Remember 2 TTs a mixer and a crate of records? I do. Oh, don't forget to bring all your cables and, shit, that place doesn't have monitors so bring your speakers too. The point is, a controller is just a piece of gear. If you can rock it on that piece of gear, all the other DJs saying your gear is shit is just ego talking. No matter what you play on, as other comment in this thread have stated, don't be an asshole, show up early, get your shit together, and rock that mother fucker. That's all that matters."
Beatmatch,309n21,ultramarioihaz,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"I have done my fair share of bring my own gear too, but my argument was that club owners have already bought CDJ/DJM equipment, OF COURSE THATS NOT ABSOLUTE, but it is certainly in an aspiring young DJs best interest to be able to play on industry standard equipment. Sure there will be instances of gigs where the venue doesnt have equipment, but at mainstream clubs/venues where someone like Zedd or another pro is playing, there will be CDJs there. Hands down, you can't argue that fact."
Beatmatch,309n21,DJ_Theo,10,Thu Mar 26 13:18:19 2015 UTC,"Correction - you can probably use a controller if you are a pop sensation and people go because they want to hear you play clarity or animals.  If you are local or bedroom DJ you will get grilled for the equipment you use. No offense but any promoter worth his salt should at least think twice if you show up with a mixtrack pro that doesn't even have trim knobs. Love it or hate it, that the reality."
Beatmatch,309n21,Okidoki_Sir,5,Wed Mar 25 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"I'm brand new to the DJ world and have just purchased a controller and laptop. I don't plan on playing high end clubs/huge shows/etc with it, but is it really that big of a deal to use a controller vs other equipment? It could be something I'm missing due to being a total newb, but this just sounds like flat out elitism. If someone showed up with lesser equipment and played an excellent set, why would anyone give a shit what gear he has?"
Beatmatch,309n21,DJVendetta,3,Wed Mar 25 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"It's really boils down to preference. But you also have to consider history, which came first? Chicken or the egg? Turntables are what came first, CDJs were made in their image, and like wise controllers were made with both predecessors in mind. I am comfortable using CDJS, vinyl, controllers, etc but man do I love vinyl. There's just nothing like touching a record and manipulating the sound through it. So you can make the argument of 'history' and the roots of the art but the end product is all that really matters. I'm also a pro photographer, I LOVE film (as much as I love vinyl) but I'm doing head shots for a company this weekend and you bet your ass I'm bringing my digital camera. In the art world the goal is to match the medium to your situation!"
Beatmatch,309n21,scrap5,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"Because when a club spends +3k on equipment and builds a custom rig to house 3 CDJs and a mixer - they expect their DJs to play on that equipment. All the new DJs are going to bitch and complain because they can ""mix perfectly well with their controllers"" but that's not the point. With all that equipment already there, and no room in the booth for any more equipment, why would you want to lug a controller to the gig and play on that? It's a way of quality assurance, any DJ with enough experience can play on CDJs no problem. A promoter or club owner will know that you know your shit if you can play on their equipment.   If the club doesn't have their own equipment or if you're playing arena shows like Zedd, then sure go ahead and rock your controller."
Beatmatch,309n21,_Dotty_,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"You are totally right. It is only about elitism.  The thing is: Most DJs playing in clubs these days have learnt djaying some time ago. During that time there were no controllers and therefore they had to use CDJs/Vinyl. Clubs adjusted to this by providing CDJs/Vinyl and it became the ""industry standard"". Because of that, many new DJs think that they have to adapt to this standard. And because they cant have nice things (aka controllers), others should not have, either."
Beatmatch,309n21,Tastygroove,1 point,Thu Mar 26 08:39:50 2015 UTC,"yeah i agree here, He is using that because he is Zedd. Just as dillon francis uses his laptop on cdj's and doesn't catch any shit. They produce first, and damn, they put on quite the show. (I've been to their shows)."

I think using the clubs CDJs is better because of ease, but I wouldn't really say there's anything they can do that a good controller can't."
Beatmatch,309n21,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:51:25 2015 UTC,"CDJs are just the industry standard. Any club you show up to play at will usually have some Pioneer CDJs, mostly 2000s from what I've seen and a DJM-900. It just keeps things easier for artist not having to bring their own kit. At this point, I've shown up to play with just a handful of thumb drives.   Traktor has some crazy capacity to juggle beats with their memory loop function built into the middle of the S4. I never learned how to use it since I didn't play on an S4 for very long and it sounded like shit when I fucked around with it but some guys use it to remix live, which usually (when it's done right) ends up being a really kinetic performance.   It's all personal preference anyway. I've never had problems asking the sound guy to set up something different as long as I asked in advance and got there early. It's all about communicating. I imagine they'd probably say no if you asked them to set up your Mixtrack Pro though an RMX-1000 is a little different."
Beatmatch,309n21,machinesmith,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:13:09 2015 UTC,I can't even believe that Zedd makes top quality EDM with a controller ;) but honestly who gives a fuck ? Carl Cox uses a Traktor controller as well and he's one of the best actual DJs in the world.
Beatmatch,309n21,DJ_Selina_Style,5,Thu Mar 26 00:20:00 2015 UTC,Carl Cox is in his own league when it comes to mixing.  I've witnessed him on 3 turntables and the dude was solid for 6+ hours...Truly amazing dj skills.

Beatmatch,309n21,drnt4nttn,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"I like to walk a middle ground -- at home, I use my SZ because it gets me close to a CDJ2000/DJM900 setup without spending $6k. Sometimes I haul it out -- like to one local venue that refuses to fix their fucking 1200s so I can't dance or the needle skips, or when I've got a few other DJs that want to play on the fun gear. (I love the ""kid on Christmas"" look that some of my DJ friends get when they see I brought it out for a gig.  Otherwise, I just bring a couple USB drives and a SP-1, which gives me almost all of the workflow I use on my SZ (cue juggling, a few basic effects, sampler, beatroll) but lets me play on anything with two decks and a basic mixer. Since picking up an AMX, I toss that in the bag as a backup just in case."
Beatmatch,309n21,dj_soo,2,Thu Mar 26 02:33:46 2015 UTC,how do you use the SP-1 with just CDJs?  I thought it was just a midi controller optimized for Serato?
Beatmatch,309n21,Jinnobi,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"They use controllers because it's the best way to montage stems made with actual production tools. It's, really, the only way... They don't play acoustic instruments nor are they accompanied by other players. They aren't mixing other folks' tunes like a DJ they are mixing elements more akin to a mixing board in the studio. Watching a producer mix his own tracks on cd would be boring-as-fuck... We watch performers... So there needs to be dramatic live fx, etc...We don't stare at djs... These performers are only similar in that they appear in the same venues sometimes  and have some gear overlap."

Just have a good grasp of the fundamentals - beatmatching (strictly by ear), eq use, fader control, and knowledge of your tracks and you can play on anything.    You may not be able to do much more than the basics of mixing tracks, but if you can't rock a crowd using just pitch controls, faders, and eqs, you need to work a little more on your fundamentals."

Beatmatch,309n21,Jinnobi,3,Sun Mar 29 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"this is the difference between EDM and electronic music. money =/= success or good music. There are many, many great producers out there who were before their time and never earned success that might have been rightfully deserved. Had they had the same opportunities as Zedd did (read into his background) they likely would have had a chance at being discovered and having huge financial success. The music industry is very complicated like that. Im not for one minute saying Zedd isn't talented, just that he has had many helping hands from both his personal and professional life in gaining the fame he now has.   edit: thanks for the gold!

It's a great exercise to beatmatch on the fly. The songs are Blackalicious - Alphabet Aerobics Instrumental and Apollo 100 - Hall Of the Mad Mountain King, if you want to try it.  An exercise I give my students is picking an instrumental song and an acapella at different original tempos. Play the instrumental and drop the acapella at 0%, and beatmatch the acapella on the fly to the instrumental. It's easy to hear when the acapella drifts because it sounds like the singer is either rushing or bored of singing. You can try matching with both the pitch and platter or just the pitch, and find your own technique to beatmatch fast and bend when stuff sounds off."

The other way is to cue the other song just 4 bars before you wanna mix out so you don't have to ride the pitch/platter so much.
Beatmatch,309z7q,PeteyWinkle,0,Fri Mar 27 04:40:45 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to mix in this song it to just quick cut and drop that drum fill right on the 4 at the end of a phrase on the previous song.   I use that technique a lot mixing old disco tunes since a lot of them do start with a little drum fill like that. You just have to know which beat in the count the drum fill starts on and have the songs relatively close in tempo.   If it's a longer drum fill, like 3 beats or full measure, it's also a good way to do a tempo change."

Sometimes, if you're lucky and the person who mixed the song down is old-school, you can take a track with vocals, invert the phase of the left channel and play it back with the right channel, leaving you with only the discrepancies, which sometimes includes the vocals.

Some people do DJing of not-just-their-own-music in that way, but it's relatively esoteric.  If you want to bounce your tracks down to finished WAV/MP3 files in the studio, and then play them out with only using ""regular DJing"" levels of interaction, then you want to DJ and we're going to be pissy bitches about the value of beatmatching.  I suggest you get the book ""How To DJ (Properly)"" and read that, because that will give you a good general background about ""DJ things"" in a very friendly manner. Yes, it's very vinyl-centric, but you need to suck it up and read it anyway because even laptop-and-Traktor DJing uses the same metaphors of ""decks, pitch controls, mixer"".  To answer one specific question you asked: Modern CDJs (primarily thinking the high-end really expensive ones like Pioneer's CDJ2000 Nexus units) can be used in a laptop-connected mode to be a Traktor controller, but it's far more normal for them to be used on their own. They have USB sockets on, you prepare your music using Pioneer's (free) Rekordbox software on your PC and then plug USB drive(s) in to your CDJs, perform track selection using the controls on the CDJ."

The guy is a freaking wizard and uses some really nice set ups involving step sequencers and vinyl alongside ableton. I'm quite into the idea of having a sort of... 'performance djing' setup like his at the moment - not because it looks easier or more convenient but because it creates a really interesting style of djing which is a  welcome deviation from the traditional style of djing (mixing songs).   Don't get me wrong, the mixing/song selection/crowd reading  combo will forever be at the heart of djing. However, being able to directly control all parameters of an instruments such as, the drums, or launch samples with fx alongside the tracks you've already selected means you're not just guiding your mixes 'journey' but instead creating the journey - and these days this seems to be the requirement of a great DJ.  Can't give too well an informed opinion of CDJs as I haven't owned any but I believe its simply a case of hooking up via USB (with the newer models) and using Timecode with an external soundcard (like an NI Audio 6) and RCA cables.  Have a look at some more of KiNK's videos for some differently scaled set ups and song building."

In your dj'ing and mixing itself. It looks professional if it makes a crowd go wild. That is the only thing that matters. DJ EZ might be an inspiration. http://youtu.be/qQaEWVYuyXU.

Beatmatch,3091f0,Sgt_Floss,18,Wed Mar 25 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"I am slowly exploring house music and I find it a bit confusing (coming from a dubstep/dnb background).   Technically Drum and Bass is a sub-genre or sister-genre of Jungle which include a bunch of others like Ragga, Jazzstep, IDM, Techstep, annd so on... So the differences between Drum and Bass and Jungle for example are quantifiable in similar ways to the differences between Tech House and Funky House.   My question is : what are the defining caracteristics of tech, minimal, G, bassline and jackin house.   A lot of it is just ""they sound similar so we group it together."" There's a lot of cross over and debate when it comes to classification. Think of any genre... What makes emo rock different from alt rock? Sure, there are some things you can point to but the band composition, general patterns in the drums and bass, and so on are the same... Part of it is just ""this one sounds like all the other emo rock I've heard, so it must be emo rock.""   Tech House: There's often a lot of overlap with Electo, Progressive, and Deep House here but the main feature is Technoesque drums and almost monotonous repetition. This is Tech House: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4wWlxPAskA I'd say it's harder sometimes to pin down what makes it different from ""Techno."" Minimal: This is another Techno inspired sub-genre and the name is pretty self explanatory... Super minimal sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwkp2wnmeu4 Bassline: This sub-genre is related to UK Garage and Speed Garage... The emphasis is on the bassline. Bassline was created in Sheffeild and the genre is defined by adherence to the 'signature sound' which has very Speed Garage like synths: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yrewzqtL_I Jackin: This is another regional creation, specifically Chicago in the 80s and it was born out of a sub-scene active in the 80s. Again, mostly identifiable by the drums and bassline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HceLwsv03sk    Bonus if you can show me how garage is different than house.   Garage is closely related to House and has the typical 4/4 syncopated rythems... The main difference is a shuffled hi-hat pattern and beat-skipping kicks. The vocal samples are also often chopped up/pitch-shifted and the genre relies heavily on MC culture. Garage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m50ArrPjNw  It's old and highly opinionated but I suggest you checkout http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/ and I also suggest you read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:House_music_genres as it breaks down characteristics in most cases."

If you focus on one genre, you'll make less money, but you'll be a part of a stronger community.  One thing I also noticed it's that even the most die hard genre fan will want some change in the set at some point, so don't focus on only one genre, work on 3 or 4 that compliment each other."

Beatmatch,308vnb,tadhgerty,2,Wed Mar 25 13:10:21 2015 UTC,"I'd suppose it depends on what type of gigs you want to get. I haven't started gigging myself, but for me I would be djing future house and electro to complement my productions, so practicing and spinning that is obviously my preference. However, to get regular gigs at top 40 clubs or parties where people are going to be giving you requests, becoming comfortable with (and having in your collection) some of the current top 40, classic hip-hop or classic rock might be essential, for example. So if you are marketing yourself (or planning on marketing yourself) as a certain style DJ, that can be useful so you always get hired for the appropriate gigs (i.e. no one is requesting Taylor Swift during your strictly <118bpm deep/tech house set), but if you are adept at doing any style, you could be more versatile and get more gigs. I think what other commenter said about doing both is good advice, you can pick a favourite for now so you have an identity, and learn as many genres/styles as you want as well. I don't think the 2 have to be mutually exclusive :)"
Beatmatch,308vnb,DJ_Theo,2,Wed Mar 25 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of gigs you want - a top40 DJ who knows how to play a little bit of everything will have a much easier time securing a residency to play every week or every other week. However, you're going to be playing the same tracks over and over again and will be expected to play those tracks. In my personal opinion, I'd want to shoot myself in the head after listening to the same 40 tracks all the time.  If you specialize in a specific genre, then you will likely get gigs less often until you expand your brand and skills. However, people will look to you as an ""expert"" in your genre and give you the freedom to rock the house with whatever track selection you see fit. I play out about once a month, and the promoter always lets me play whatever dark and twisted underground trance I want because I'm the ""trance guy"" when promoters need a break from all the dubstep and trap on their lineups. Ultimately comes down to what you want to play - mainstream popular music that will attract consistently good crowds that are expecting the hear certain songs, or go underground and find a smaller, but more open-minded and loyal fan base that is down to hear something new."
Beatmatch,308vnb,Dantejb,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to actually stay with just one or two genres IMO. There's so much overlap between genres that it's almost impossible to not throw in other genres where they're deemed fit. If you limit yourself to one or two genres, you're honestly screwing yourself over. Yes, many have done genre exclusive DJing very well, but in regards to getting gigs, the more adaptable you are, the more people you'll have interested in booking you. Furthermore, by knowing more music, you'll begin to master each genre by trying tricks used in other genres to make transitions in whatever genres you're playing (EG: Beat juggling in EDM, or loop rolling in hip hop). If you know a lot of different music, you'll be able to understand how specific genres work. It drives me crazy when I see posts along the lines of ""I DJ EDM only. This gig wants hip hop. How do you mix hip hop?"" because it exposes laziness and fear of getting out of your comfort zone.   TL;DR, if you want to get good, do every genre and if you do it enough, you'll master the genres anyway."

Beatmatch,308ysc,CRYTEK_T-REX,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. The 400 never really got the greatest reviews. The 500 is old. While that in itself isn't all bad, the newer Pioneers have very noticeably improved in sound quality.   I personally dislike the layout of the Xone 22/23. The mixer is where you'll be spending the bulk of your time, and so I find it important to get one with a layout you are comfortable with. I prefer the clean layout of the 250 w/ the straight forward filter knobs for each channel. Allen & Heath are very well known for their sound and filter quality, which gets no argument from me, I just dislike it's arrangement."
Beatmatch,3096fa,NarwhalTeamSix,2,Wed Mar 25 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"Setting up DVS is easy. Plug things in, drop the vinyl and go.  You need to learn turntable maintenance and setup, like how to handle anti-skate, tonearm weights, etc. There are TONS of resources on youtube for that.  Most ""pro"" turntables are all identical, at this point, whether you're buying Numark, Reloop, Pioneer, Audio Technica, etc. They almost all come from the same exact factory and have the same insides (don't buy the hype, the Pioneer PLX-1000 has nothing to do with technics).  If you buy a pair of Technics 1200s, that's fine too if you can find them cheap used. Just get a direct drive set, and get a decent pair of needles to get started. Don't go crazy."

Beatmatch,3082yw,ehleman,2,Wed Mar 25 05:39:39 2015 UTC,"I had posted this in another subreddit some time ago:   3) AT-LP1240 - Super OEM turntables (same as Stanton ST.150, Reloop RP-6000, etc.) with the highest torque available on the market.  Owned them, loved them. Solidly built and perform well, but not as rock solid as Technics. Have a look at Turntable Lab's review here.  4) Pioneer PLX-1000 - Very similar to above. Nice feel to it, but the price is hard to justify considering that it's very similar to the super OEM turntables on the market which can be found for significantly less. I don't see any advantage that the PLX-1000 has over other super OEM turntables from a build quality perspective. Most, if not all super OEM turntables have more features than the PLX-1000.  TL;DR: Technics > Super OEM turntables (AT LP-1240 and Pioneer PLX-1000)   The straight tonearm supposedly is better for scratching as it apparently allows the stylus to better stay in groove. Unless you're doing any scratching I would steer clear and go for an S-arm."
Beatmatch,3082yw,Mr_RD,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:45:32 2015 UTC,"The differences will be minimal (and basically unnoticeable unless you're doing lots of scratching). I personally just prefer straight tone arms, although they do provide better tracking. There is a bit about this in the wiki. The ST(R8) tables are Super OEMs. Although I don't know why you'd need to pay extra for counterweights w/ markings for the AT. Just mark it yourself. You'll probably want new carts/styli regardless of which table you buy. As a dnb dj myself, I'd recommend Shure M44-G's."

It's a VERY basic skill, you should be able to do it without any kind of readout anyway!  At double BPM it should be as simple as the same BPM with the exception that it may sound weird.

Beatmatch,307949,Canadian_Government,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:17:34 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, using the phase meter in Traktor is not true beatmatching? For example, I never press the sync button, but I like to use the phase meter."

You should easily be able to beatmatch by ear since they're essentially the same tempo except one is in double time. Cut the low so the bass doesn't overlap, cut the high too if that helps. If you still can't match them, try setting the beatgrid manually with the tap button."
Beatmatch,307949,prdors,3,Wed Mar 25 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"You should be able to beat match by ear. That's using a readout.   Also, you'll never show up as matched by the phase meter, because according to traktor you're not matched, one song is playing at 80 BPM and the other is 160"
Beatmatch,307949,That_One_Stoned_Guy,2,Wed Mar 25 01:29:43 2015 UTC,True beat matching is done solely by ear. Try using the cue button when beat matching the incoming track to help you keep track of how much faster/slower it is than the track playing while still being easily able to distinguish the two tracks.
Beatmatch,307949,BuxtonTheRed,2,Wed Mar 25 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"The phase meter tells you the relationship of the Traktor beatgrids to one another. That's all they do.  If those grids are wrong, then the phase meter will lie to you.  If the grids are at half/double time relative to one another, Traktor is going to say the phase is all over the place.  You could temporarily edit the grid on one to double or half its BPM, but I'd suggest instead knowing when to disregard the phase meter and go by ear."
Beatmatch,307949,brokenstack,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:18:30 2015 UTC,"And the BPM readout might be wrong. If you haven't analyzed the tracks yourself. Remember there's a setting in Traktor that sets an upper and lower limit on the BPM. So if it isn't working those tracks might not actually be 80BPM and 160BPM, making your efforts impossible without actually beatmatching."

Beatmatch,304gmd,dj0ldguy,2,Tue Mar 24 18:07:25 2015 UTC,It means that i'll be listening to B in my headphones and i'll also listen to A in my headphones in which A is already playing out there loud on the dance floor once both are beatmatched i'll just take out both the cues and push the volume fader of B up!
Beatmatch,304gmd,chakan2,3,Tue Mar 24 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"yes, you can do that if you want, but you have to make sure the beats are totally locked before you push B up. I don't know if this will help you. Maybe it will? Maybe it won't? but I'll try and help you....  A is playing for everyone on the dance floor to hear so now you have B that you want to come in with but as you say, you are listening to B in your right ear with one headphone....so one way is to do what Ihunt said and have B come through the headphones with a little bit of A in which case you would have both A + B playing in your headphones. Another way is to only have B playing in your headphones and turn down the volume in your headphones of B so that the volume doesn't overpower what is being played (A) and try and match beats that way. Another option is to have B playing pretty loud in your headphones, but don't put the headphone directly into your right ear or you may go deaf. Instead, have it dangling or hovering over your right ear so that you are mainly listening to A with both ears, but can hear B slightly coming out of the headphones and match beats that way. Hope that helps?"
Beatmatch,304gmd,Con1750,2,Tue Mar 24 19:13:59 2015 UTC,Now i'm clear on how to beatmatch! Thanks for the help!
Beatmatch,304gmd,kfc_spork,2,Tue Mar 24 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"Almost all mixers should have PFL (pre-fader listen) that will allow you to mix what's cued with what's live over your headphones. That's how I do it to get the beats lined, then bring in the song."
Beatmatch,304gmd,Con1750,5,Wed Mar 25 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"The way you have described is what you will see DJs do in a club setup, one ear listens to the cue and the other to the booth monitor, you should learn this method if you are interested in playing in front of people. The idea of this is to create a stereo field as if you were listening in a pair of headphones, in a big club where the volume is very high this is a much better method.  Also learn to mix in your headphones because some places you play are going to have crappy monitoring or none at all, so you need this as a backup method.  To sum it up you are definitely on the right lines."
Beatmatch,304gmd,nowenknows,2,Tue Mar 24 15:39:56 2015 UTC,"Can you explain why this is preferable to doing the beat matching completely within the headphones using the mix knob? I find myself doing it both ways but I've noticed that it seems harder to match my left ear in headphones to my right ear hearing the speakers. I've also read (and observed) that there can be a delay between the mixer and sound coming from the speakers, it seems like this would also make it more difficult."
Beatmatch,304gmd,christianjackson,3,Tue Mar 24 18:07:53 2015 UTC,"Its just for playing out to be honest you would find it very hard to hear a mix when you have a huge sound system booming at the same time.  Also my beat matching improved tremendously using this method, I used the cue/mix knob when I first started but it isn't very good for hearing a change in pitch either. Split cue is a great way to mix in headphones if you have that, it sends 2 mono signals to your headphones rather than one stereo signal."
Beatmatch,304gmd,christianjackson,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"When you're completely in the headphones, you lose your monitoring of what is happening outside of the headphones. So if both your cues are on, you hear in the headphones that both songs are playing but your faders might not be up. The most important thing is to have continuous music playing through the main speakers. It might sound fine in your headphones (because it has a different mix/cue ratio as well as its own volume) but the outside levels maybe too high or too low. I always have one ear on the main mix (coming out of the speakers) because that's the most important thing."

Beatmatch,304qc3,Dantejb,3,Tue Mar 24 16:46:11 2015 UTC,"That's with anything really. Try mixing Get Low by Lil Jon with King Kunta by Kendrick Lamar. Both are hip hop, have the same key, and are around the same BPM, but the styles are so dramatically different it doesn't work without extensively modifying basslines, effects, ect.   I would say to start out with a basic electro swing drum beat and work it from there. Bring in the jazz after a drop, or on top of an outro. It's all about experimentation."
Beatmatch,304qc3,selib,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:54:33 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good idea based on my experimentation earlier. I prefer the more tech / house electro swing as I'm not particularly competent with hip hop.

[Someone please correct me if im wrong]. and make sure that they dont jerk around on a specific pitch setting. eg: you set it to -3% and the row of dots seems stationary, then slowly starts to lag, then seems stationary again, then slowly starts to speed up and keeps fluctuating.  check the headshell out, make sure its firmly connected and clean, and of course check out all the wire connections. can't think of anything else right now but this should be good.   As for the mixer, make sure none of the knobs/faders are sticky and move freely, make sure its clean, and ensure all the connections work properly. if the slope on the crossfader can be adjusted, make sure it works properly and make sure the xfader closes (isolates the appropriate channel) properly. can't really think of anything else to check.

The bad news is, you still need to at least appear and act professional, and know your top 40 inside and out, or they'll eat you alive if you can't honor at least some of their requests (high school kids are brats, I'm guessing that's not news to you).  You can take a huge amount of the stress out of the operation by knowing your gear perfectly, which means that you're going to be playing with it for a lot of hours, every day until friday. Know your tracks, organize them and know your gear. Know which buttons, knobs and faders you'll need and use and remember them to the point where you locate them without thinking. Forget about the ones you don't need. DO the same for the music: listen to every single track you take with you and organize the tracks in a way that makes sense to you and that you'll be able to search under pressure.  The DJs job is to tell a story that makes people want to dance. Obviously, this comes with experience, so don't worry if your story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It won't. Try to read the crowd and by this, I mean don't keep your eyes on your decks: watch the crowd and WATCH THE GIRLS. If you can get the girls to dance, the guys will follow like a fat kid follows an ice cream truck. When the girls leave the floor, you're not playing the right music. Simple.  So, quick recap to be clear:  -know your gear backwards and forwards;  -know your music backwards and forwards. Flag a selection of tracks that are sure things. Use them if/when the shit hits the fan.;  -watch the crowd. Make the girls dance.  -DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, LOSE YOUR COOL."
Beatmatch,300w18,dfmz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the action plan!  I am a quick learner and I'm lucky that another college buddy loaned me his S4 because there are so many tutorials on YouTube (unfortunately, he actually makes money as a DJ/producer and doesn't have time to hold my hand all week). You're right and I feel it as I type - unless I know this deck like a QWERTY keyboard, I'll shit my pants.   On the music, I'm a guy so of course my first thought was ""I better have some gangsta shit lined up."" What you said about getting girls dancing is pure gold though and it brought back a lot of memories haha. I've asked my friend to meet with his sister on Wednesday to look at what I have lined up so I can make adjustments based on her feedback.   If you have any links to guides that have helped you along the way in terms of organizing music and planning sets, I'd love to see them but I figure that's a part of the whole years-of-experience thing.   I do have a follow-up question and I don't mean to abuse your time and kindness so don't feel obliged to respond or delve too deeply, but is this process useful to me? A guide on a custom mapping for preparing beat grids, phasing, cue points. Blog Post or YouTube video  Thanks so much again!"
Beatmatch,300w18,burniemcburn,3,Mon Mar 23 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"I do have a follow-up question and I don't mean to abuse your time and kindness so don't feel obliged to respond or delve too deeply, but is this process useful to me?   Bad idea. The links you posted require more knowledge of the art of mixing than you have right now and will only add to the list of things you need to master by friday end of business. Midi mapping is an advanced feature that is not necessary for what you're going to be doing.  Basically, for the S4, the controls you need to master are the zones in red here. For the record, these are controls that are standard on every single mixer around, regardless of brand. Practice with these, plus how to load and cue up tracks (cueing is setting the starting point of a track, generally on the first beat). You really need to know your way around these red zones in order to be able to focus on the crowd and the track selection instead of fiddling with the knobs. I can't stress enough how important this is. On the bright side, these controls are quite simple and once you understand how they work, you'll feel a lot more comfortable.  Let me insert this here before I forget... headphones, you need a decent pair of headphones. And by decent, I mean over ear style, with good insulation from outside noise, so as to allow you to hear the tracks you want to play next in the headphones over the sound of what's playing on the speakers this is also called ""cueing"", btw). Do not underestimate the importance of good headphones. I imagine your friend who lent you the S4 can hook you up. If he can't, borrow some from someone else and wear them while you practice so as to get used to them.  Honestly, I think you have enough info to start working. If you have further questions, we'll be here to help you out until friday night, but you need to spend time behind the decks, playing music to yourself or to some friends (you've got that covered!) to get the hang of it.  One last thing... yes, you will have stage fright before you start. We all do and anyone who says otherwise is either lying or a sociopath (probably the first option). Do what you need to get over it, but if I were you, I'd stay away from liquor or narcotics, because they can really alter the way you see and hear things, and that can quickly become a problem when you're playing live. Don't sweat it, we've all been there. Prepare adequately, come back here for advice if you need to, and you'll be fine.  The gear, the music, the crowd. These are the three things you need to focus on."

Beatmatch,3002r8,TylerIn2D,2,Mon Mar 23 11:31:53 2015 UTC,"You basically have three options here:   ask someone who can beatmatch to do it for you; do it yourself using software that can sync (automatic beatmatch). The exact software will depend on whether you use a Mac or a PC, but think Djay or VirtualDJ or something along those lines. learn to beatmatch (there are tutorials here and on youtube that will help you learn) and do it yourself.   Option 2 is the easy/lazy way and option 1 will most likely be the most interesting, because you'll be able to watch someone who knows how to beatmatch how it's done, properly, while you watch. Who know, this might be the beginning on something amazing for you and lead to option 3!"

Beatmatch,3002r8,dfmz,2,Mon Mar 23 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"How good are the automatic beatmatchers?   I'm not going to lie to you, I have no idea how they compare. The only time I use the sync feature is when I get bored when I fly and test new song combinations on my iPad with DJay 2. It works well, but it's a little frustrating for someone who can beatmatch!  Anyhoo, the basic idea behind djing is simple: blend songs together so as to tell a story, a story that will make people dance. There are many, many ways to do this and the best way to figure out if you like it is to try.  If you're fortunate enough to know a good DJ (as was my case, a long time ago), ask him/her to show you how it's done. If you like it, learn. If you don't, no harm."

If you want to learn do it on gear that has physical faders as they will make it easier for you to ""feel"" what you're doing."
Beatmatch,3002r8,Mr_RD,2,Mon Mar 23 12:19:39 2015 UTC,"You're basically asking for a crash course in DJing but not wanting to put in the effort. It'll take a lot more than five minutes of reading to understand the core concepts of DJing. Track selection is a huge part of DJing.  To answer your question - use iTunes, seriously. Turn on the crossfader option go from there. That'll allow you to fade tracks in and out."

If you want to really be good your skills will need to be sharper than that.  you dont scratch.  you use the pitch control and match the bpms on both songs. There are some phone apps you can use to tap to give you a rough estimate of the bpm's on a song. If you want to do it manually just count the beat for 15 seconds and times that by four. 15x4=60 seconds."

Beatmatch,2zyatw,Aniahlator,2,Mon Mar 23 09:57:57 2015 UTC,"Back when a DJ friend of mine taught me to beatmatch, we did it using two identical records (I learned on vinyl). Both were house tracks and both were uneventful, vocal free tracks. The idea is to learn how to get them in sync without external aids (BPM meter, etc.). Once you can do it with two identical records, change the second record and once you can do that, start mixing tracks, adding tracks with vocals, etc.  The idea is to do it progressively. It took me a long time for it to click. Some people get it faster than others, but it always comes to you. After a while you'll be able to do it with almost anything. The hard part is mixing styles and some styles can be hard.  In the end, practice makes perfect. There's no way around that."
Beatmatch,2zyatw,dfmz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 09:15:24 2015 UTC,I'll try that out. Thanks for the response
Beatmatch,2zyatw,dj0ldguy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:59:31 2015 UTC,Man. This is golden advice for anyone having trouble learning to beatmatch. I was taught the same thing when I was first learning (before digital gear). Using identical records will help you a ton!
Beatmatch,2zyatw,brokenstack,2,Mon Mar 23 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"You can learn on anything, really. I learned, much like dfmz, on vinyl using two copies of the same song (Violent Mood Swings by Stabbing Westward). Start playing one copy, and pick a point you want to drop the second copy in. Cue up the track and get it ready for the drop, etc.  And if you have someone helping you, have them move the pitch fader or feather the platter while you're mixing and force you to change things."
Beatmatch,2zyatw,dj0ldguy,2,Mon Mar 23 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"I love this advice about moving the pitch fader. I used to do this with my friends too and it helped soooo much. It teaches you to stay on your toes. Once you have the beats locked and matched, moving the pitch randomly so the beats fall out of sync on purpose and trying to fix it asap is a great way to learn. It's better to have a friend do this while you are trying to beatmatch so that you are not conscious of when or what direction the pitch gets moved and it forces you to use your ears. Great advice."
Beatmatch,2zyatw,brokenstack,2,Mon Mar 23 22:31:34 2015 UTC,"Another alternative, if you find yourself technically capable, is rig up a MIDI controller to change the pitch. For example, take a basic, cheap thing like the NanoPad and have each pad move the pitch up or down a certain amount. Since you have no feedback you'll quickly forget what the changes are, and if you're using software just disable all the displays so you have to guess."
Beatmatch,2zyatw,dj0ldguy,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:11:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Never even considered that alternative. Can you explain this a little bit more because I am just curious how you would make that work? If I am understanding you correctly, using your example, I would just assign a pitch shift change via MIDI to the NanoPad and once I have beats locked and matched, I would then hit a random pad on the NanoPad and then try to beatmatch from there? Is that what you are talking about?"
Beatmatch,2zyatw,brokenstack,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's almost exactly it. You can set it in Traktor (for example) to either go to direct values (+2%, -5%, etc), or move up and down different amounts, which would be more challenging."
Beatmatch,2zyatw,dj0ldguy,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:09:01 2015 UTC,"yeah, that is an excellent idea. Never even thought about that! I know how to beatmatch, but I am always interested in different methods and techniques people use to learn. I did it the manual way when I was learning (before CDJ's were invented) and we used to just blindly move the pitch control randomly on the turntable. This is great. Thanks for sharing that!"
Beatmatch,2zyatw,AnotherRandomDude,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend investing some time into finding music with a beat that you really like. You're going to be searching for songs a lot eventually so you might as well start now.  The reason I say this is that this is going to take time, and you don't want to be listening to music you don't like. Make sure you are having fun."
Beatmatch,2zyatw,PugSmuggler,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:18:39 2015 UTC,It might not be to everyones taste but in my opinion hard house is probably the best genre to learn beat matching with. The reason is the high beats per minute. The faster the BPM the closer the beats are which makes it easier to tell when they are drifting out. Imagine trying to beat match a 10 BPM track for example and you'll understand why a fast BPM makes things easier!

Beatmatch,2zvy0i,DJ_Theo,2,Sun Mar 22 13:02:28 2015 UTC,Depends on the gig. Since music is relatively easy to carry it's kind of silly to not have at least a 16gb USB of AIFFs or WAVs if you need it. Keep it on your key chain and update the songs every few months.

Beatmatch,2zx682,filipopasto,4,Sun Mar 22 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"A good rave/dnb/dubstep/harcore/whatever DJ will try to contact producers to get unreleased tunes (to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack). But yes, they do download from soundcloud and buy them of whatever online service. Some will do their own edits of songs and some will produce their own.  The CDJs/controller/turntables have the pitch fader, so they use that to change the bpm, not the mixer. The mixer is what permits you to have two tunes going at the same time and it controls gains and volume (it's all in one when using a controller).  Yes, you pretty much only need a basic controller + laptop + software to begin. Although some crews will require you to mix on CDJs (sort of a quality control, to make sure you really know your stuff).  Virtual DJ is a good software to start with, it is pretty easy to use without a controller (while you save up to buy one). From then on, once you've done some research, you can move on to Serato or Traktor (or stay on VDJ)."

Beatmatch,2zx682,Chiafriend12,3,Sun Mar 22 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Hardcore DJ here!   so i always wonder. what do the djs at rave partys where mostly dark dnb & hardcore etc is played actually do?   Mix like DJs of any other genre :)   i dont think many of them produce songs on their own, do they?   It really, really depends, just like it does with DJs of other genres. All the DJs on this flier are also producers, many of them with half a dozen or more albums.  Now for me, I've only produced only a track or two I would consider good enough for playing out but I tend to rarely play my own tracks live. S3RL, however, is a hardcore DJ who exclusively plays tracks he himself produced.   they mostly get the songs from some soundcloud producers and use their mixer to higher/lower bpm and stuff?   Do you mean increase the speed to hardcore tempo when the track wasn't already at a hardcore tempo? If that's what you mean, no, not really actually. There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of tracks made within the hardcore and DnB genres. Sometimes hardcore/DnB DJs will use tracks from other genres and speed them up/slow them down so they fit within the 87.5/175 tempo (we're talking +10, +15% or sometimes more) but it's not very common at all.  Most of the tracks I use are bought. There are still a lot of CDs and some vinyl being released in the hardcore and DnB scenes where only a certain number of copies will be made with no intention of a digital rerelease, but there are tons of hardcore/DnB tracks both in digital music stores and on Soundcloud. Soundcloud is still a relatively new thing, so historically free hardcore tracks were distributed via blogs and forums almost exclusively.   so all you need is a controller (good ones start from 200€ right for basic beginning?) + laptop + software.   Yep, but you can also get started for free if you download a free version of mix software and use your keyboard/mouse to get a feel for the fundamentals before you buy anything.   now on the software, what can you recommend for someone with a mixtrack pro who wants to get into dnb and hardcore?   Any software will do. I use VirtualDJ, but I know other hardcore DJs who use Traktor and Serato.    If you're just starting out with DnB or hardcore, if you'd like I can upload a zip of several hundred free hardcore/DnB tracks I've accumulated over the years for you later."

Beatmatch,2zw719,Just_Fanta_Sea,4,Sun Mar 22 10:51:40 2015 UTC,"All tracks from beatport are 320 mp3 kbps, or higher lossless formats if you wish.  Also I wouldn't assume you are going to earn money from the trade if you are just starting out."
Beatmatch,2zw719,Con1750,-1,Sun Mar 22 12:21:31 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really answer my question about CDs. Also, $450 from two gigs in two weekends would beg to differ."
Beatmatch,2zw719,Con1750,2,Sun Mar 22 12:38:12 2015 UTC,"How does it not answer your question? I cant speak for all CDs but anything you rip should be generally be 320kbps, also beatport do not offer anything lower than 320kbps so serato is wrong.  Also i'm not being rude but anyone willing to pay someone that kind of money for someone that has just started djing is either really stupid or you are a real fast learner."
Beatmatch,2zw719,Con1750,-5,Sun Mar 22 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe because I've been a musician for 13 years, play multiple instruments and have a university degree in music. I'd say I'm a pretty quick learner, yes. Why would the owner invite me back if I was no good.  So, to simplify my question, is the track quality I'm getting from CDs less than downloads from Beatport."
Beatmatch,2zw719,Chiafriend12,2,Sun Mar 22 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to argue with you, its just that your post makes it sound like you are being a bit cocky thats all.  Yeah there are plenty of CDs around that are 256kbps instead of the 320 kbps you get from platforms like beatport. Although you have huge platforms like iTunes which are 256kbps, hence beatports more premium prices."
Beatmatch,2zw719,dfmz,2,Sun Mar 22 13:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah there are plenty of CDs around that are 256kbps instead of the 320 kbps you get from platforms like beatport.   Are we talking commercially released CDs or homemade CD-Rs? All commercially made CDs, unless if they were made by a sketchy label that doesn't know the first thing of what it's doing, have .CDA files on them which convert to 1411kbps WAV. This is the case for probably 99.5% of commercially released CDs. Any CD made with MP3s is considered to be made incorrectly.  In almost all cases, CDs will contain lossless audio."

That attitude is not going to get you anywhere.   So let me get this straight... a guy comes here, asks a clear and legitimate question, doesn't get the answer to the question he was asking, gets shot down and gets his balls broken because he found a way to work and HE'S the one with an attitude? Really, that's how you want to play it?  WTF planet do you people live on? And who the fuck are you to judge that he shouldn't be making that kind of money after a couple of gigs? Have you heard him play? Maybe he's lucky. Maybe he's really good. Maybe he's better than you. Who the fuck cares.  Damn people can be childish sometimes."
Beatmatch,2zw719,ptntprty,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"Wow. That attitude is not going to get you anywhere. What u/Con1750 was trying to say is that when you first start DJing, you won't make any money. $450 in two gigs is shit compared to the $4000-$8000 of equipment you are bringing, your equipment insurance, transportation, prep time, meals, drinks etc. Once you start, the equipment piles up and you start to buy $90 laptop stands and $50 gold tipped 1/4"" cables. And he's right, any club owner willing to pay a noob that kind of money is a FUCKING RETARD, there is another DJ out there 50 times more experienced than you that could do that job, there is no reason to pay a novice. With all that being said, in this business you have to have a tough skin. If you can't deal with a reddit comment, you won't be able to handle a drunk club owner, or the demanding patrons who request music or the barrage of comments you get when people don't get their way. Learn to calm yourself down. I don't care if you have been playing music for 13 years. You've never had to look away from your sheet music and realize that it's 12:45am, the girls in the back have been dancing for an hour straight, the bar looks thinned out, the meatheads that just walked in look rowdy so you have to drop tempo and make a key change to soften the mood and release people from the dance floor so they can get a drink. You're doing all this while shifting your playlist to account for the change. That's DJing as a job. So please humble yourself because aside from all the ""what controller should I get"" posts on this sub, some vets are willing to give you advice out of the kindness of their hearts and for the love of the trade."

Beatmatch,2zw719,derek589111,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:27:23 2015 UTC,"Easy fella. I think you've just misread me a bit.   As I stated, I've been playing in lounge and cocktail bars rather than clubs, which I will admit, doesn't seem as demanding as commanding a dancefloor at a club. Even so, and without trying to sound egotistical, I've been doing very well.   I've received positive feedback from multiple, multiple people about my style and fluency. One gig at a bar on a Saturday night led to another one the next Saturday, and the owner wanted my number to book future gigs. I also had a trial with a promoter at a cocktail bar which went well and now he's putting me on his roster, which includes 4-5 other lounge bars around town. I got requests and incorporated them into my mix, I've had to adapt to the mood, notice what people were vibing on. Last week I was booked for 3 hours, and ended up playing for 4 1/2, as there were still people inside getting rowdy, well past the bar's usual dying off point.  To think that a seasoned musician has only played behind sheet music and has no experience commanding an audience is a bit naive. I've played in several bands who've played gigs around town (making friends with promoters and owners has helped me with DJing, I won't lie). So I have experience in working a crowd and vibing on what they are vibing on. I've been practising DJing for a few months now, and most of what I had to learn was just learning how to operate a controller, beatmatch and mix, because I already have that knowledge of how music works and how to put it together. I will admit I'm still learning, and I'm sure there is much more to learn, but at the moment I'm pretty capable with building a mix and adapting it on the fly to create a good vibe and a successful gig."
Beatmatch,2zw719,derek589111,4,Mon Mar 23 07:35:22 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons I stay away from mp3s if at all possible. Technically speaking your ear won't be able to determine the difference between 256Kbps and 320kpbs. This is why when you buy an album from iTunes it is automatically downloaded at 256k. The sound quality is 'CD' quality to most listeners.   That being said, I can discern a difference between 256Kbps music files and 1411Kbps AIFF files, depending on the equipment used to play said files. It's hard to explain, but there is a certain richness and fullness to the body of a recording that isn't compressed. I don't have super hearing or anything, so I think this is normal for most people. Which means that lossless quality can be interpreted by your audience. The trade-off is support. A lot of newer equipment supports AIFF, (including Serato) but there is a lot of equipment that doesn't.    So, to answer your question; Yes, the files are lower quality than the ones you ripped, but unless you're playing the files through the highest end audio equipment, or have a discerning ear, you won't be able to tell the difference. Neither will most punters. If you have the space (hard drives are fucking cheap, man.) go with a lossless format. It's much better quality."
Beatmatch,2zw719,derek589111,2,Sun Mar 22 12:51:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this sums ups it up perfectly. The gigs I've been playing have just been through basic PAs, so I guess I don't need to stress unless I move into a club with a big system. I'm more of a lounge bar DJ rather than big room, so I'm not exactly looking at club gigs at the moment, I can make plenty elsewhere."
Beatmatch,2zw719,mikeb93,3,Sun Mar 22 12:56:09 2015 UTC,"If you've intentionally burned your tracks from a cd at 320 Kbps, that's fine but be aware a cd is 1000+ Kbps at a lossless compression. If you're looking for true cd sound then you should check what quality you are burning from your cd. The flip side is they are going to be much larger files."
Beatmatch,2zw719,citizenchris099,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is helpful. How can I rip CD files at a higher quality?"
Beatmatch,2zw719,dfmz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:55:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on what program you're burning with busy most should have the option to change your quality. The option is given to help people conserve space if they want to. When you find the options, you'll want to choose lossless or maximum. If maximum is less than 1400 Kbps or so, get a new program.   Personally, I burn with iTunes just because I already have that program, but iTunes has a lossless algorithm. I don't know what the Kbps are from the iTunes lossless burn, but I would imagine close to 1400 or so"

If you can't tell by ear if two tracks go together, or if you need to think about it for a long time, or if you need a special software to tell you what your next track can or can't be, you have a serious problem."

Finding the beat of electronic music is way easier than anything with vocals   Not sure what you mean by ""way easier"" because a simple hip hop drum beat on loop is pretty easy to practice on as well. Live music is tough to match as the beat may not be as consistent but most studio music with an instrumental intro can be used, also depends on what BPM you want to mix/beatmatch at."

B2B gigs are great when both DJs have a similar style and can also read the flow and atmosphere to get the best possible crowd reaction. I like B2B because while you do have to consider flow of tracks, you also have to kind of one-up each other so the energy is consistent. If you're using TTs its pretty necessary to be able to beatmatch by ear (when using 2 computers), plus its not very cool when both of you are just staring at computer screens the entire time."
Beatmatch,2zpm3y,Mr_RD,2,Fri Mar 20 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"Does the 92 not have adjustable fader curve? The 900nxs seems like a bit of overkill tbh. I'll have to look around, but you might look into some scratch mixers simply because the curves are so adjustable. I don't scratch either and generally mix w/ long blends. I had a Pioneer DJM-707 for ages. Huge battle mixer, but it had fully adjustable (via knobs, not a switch) line and cross fader curves. Loved it.   Edit: I suppose something like that probably won't have filters like you want."
Beatmatch,2zpm3y,junglizer,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response - no, unfortunately the 92 doesn't have an adjustable fader curve. There was a guide that I read a few years ago that walked you through how to tweak the fader curve but from what I remember that involved some soldering and there was a good chance that you'd screw up the mixer.  Yeah, I figured the 900NXS was overkill. Before I bought the Carmen I was eyeing an A&H DB4 but that definitely would have been overkill. From what I've heard / seen, the 900NXS has a perfect linear fader curve more or less. The Ecler Nuo 2.0 also has an adjustable fader curve but I've never used one so I don't know how it reacts.   While filters would be nice, they're not a deal breaker.  I've never used a DJM-707 but I did once use a DJM-909 at a friend's house and it was awesome."

Beatmatch,2zpmwf,Rivster79,2,Sat Mar 21 05:08:30 2015 UTC,I'd say that the Numarks are probably better. They're still fairly entry level but probably constructed better than the Geminis.
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,ehleman,2,Fri Mar 20 05:54:21 2015 UTC,"Also as I've said I spin drum & bass, and most of the time when im out at DNB nights watching other DJs mix, they've got their levels all the way fully in the red.  How do they adjust the gain for the incoming track in that case?  How do you know when one track is louder then the other when there both fully in the red?  I've always tried to stay clear of the red, would I be doing myself a disservice doing this for Drum & Bass?"
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,poejaxton,8,Fri Mar 20 06:14:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, I work as a sound engineer at a large but relatively underground club, and I can tell you that the way those DJs adjust is that thy don't. Most clubs will have a limiter of some sort on the amp rack. I will set the sound up so that if someone is keeping in the yellow then they will not be limited, using the mixing desk. Therefore if someone starts rinsing it in the red, they are being limited anyway, so it doesn't make it louder, it just makes the sound shittier. These DJs therefore are playing everything as loud as it will come out of the system anyways and will not need to match gain on tracks.  This might sound like a good solution, but it really isn't. All mixers (although IMO especially Pioneer ones) start distorting in the red. The lights are red for a reason. Red is bad. This is the point where the mixer can no longer adequately cope with the signal you are putting through it. This means for example in my club that all the work of Pioneer, Midas, Funktion One and me to make the DJ sound good, all those years of R&D, are being totally undone by a DJ who is too ignorant to set his gains properly.   Red lights. Not even once."
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,endmass,2,Fri Mar 20 10:11:57 2015 UTC,"This. All of this. I've had to yell at top international acts to watch they're gains.   Sure the yelling was mostly cause it was in a loud room, but these were headliners for Christ's sake. I was pleasantly angry.  Pioneers sound the worse pushed. Then again, if you've got a funkion one rig wired up to a pioneer; you're asking for it ;)"
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,poejaxton,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:35:54 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it haha, I've been shouting at guys on world tour to turn it down!   And as for the Pioneer/F1 mix, we use F1 for loads of our stuff and it's what the club wanted, but the DJs often specify pioneer mixers only, so that's how you end up with that mix going on."

I was messing around with a mixer last weekend trying to figure out whether they were, and it seemed as though turning down the EQ knobs lowered the VU reading. Does it depend on the mixer - anyone know about the DJM 900nxs?"
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,endmass,1 point,Fri Mar 20 06:13:21 2015 UTC,The pioneer mixers are definitely post EQ
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,endmass,3,Fri Mar 20 06:21:33 2015 UTC,Most are post eq. It kinda only makes sense that way.
Beatmatch,2zo8fr,DJ_Theo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:30:49 2015 UTC,"Xone mixers (the entire lineup) have a lower output than most. Usually theirs a jumper you can remove to bring the output up a bit, to match a Pioneer.  That will raise the overall gain, If you're having issues with the mix itself, say through the phones: then its because of the cleaner sound. The meters should stay around 0db.  0db or I'll break both of your kneecaps. As a sound tech, I run hard limiters to protect my rig. It'll sound like shit if pushed. Just dont do it. I know those red (blue on a&h?) Leds are pretty; but it makes me want to knock your face in.   Props for asking. Most would just run it harder and not think twice."

To go straight to CDs these days is just really expensive, or at least a WHOLE lot more expensive than at least testing the waters with software.

Sure 60 bucks is a great deal but I tried over and over to get that thing to work well with Traktor and I couldn't.

Unfortunately it's been having problems with output to the headphone jack so that will force the issue but honestly if not for that I might just keep using it. It's not what I would call a reliable or gig-ready controller (esp since any xponent you find will be old and used) BUT I love that it has tons of buttons and knobs in a very intuitive configuration and it has platters at the rear/top. For $60 I'd buy a second one just to stave off an expensive controller purchase and fix my headphones issue."

I've been experiencing the same thing, getting a pair of hd-25's has made a big improvement to my cue levels but could still be better. As for meters...  I have a pioneer ddj-t1, one of the things this is lacking is meters on the hardware. This leaves my only option being traktors onscreen meters (which seem to really suck, no colour and depending on how the master output is configured, may top out)   is there something I am not understanding about traktors meters? Do you have any other suggestions for people lacking per channel meters?"
Beatmatch,2zmqds,Myipad4,2,Fri Mar 20 02:58:47 2015 UTC,maybe twist the cue/master knob in your headphones a few times and see how the incoming track matches up to the track outputting to the mains?
Beatmatch,2zmqds,dj_soo,3,Fri Mar 20 03:50:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this helps, but set a Rekordbox cue point at the loudest part of the song. When you load a song, go to that point and then turn the Trip/Gain knob so that the VU meter is at 0 dB. If you set your gain from the beginning of the song, it'll probably go into the red later on."
Beatmatch,2zmqds,marymelodic,3,Fri Mar 20 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"I do this as a spot check. Needle search to the loudest part by waveform and just check the meter. I run on CDJs or DDJ-SX so I just go by ""in the yellow"" on a DJM and ""tickling the reds"" on my SX."

For instance, you can take 2 songs that both peak at the same place, but one can sound considerably louder than the other because of the way it's been mastered, which is why you can't rely on the LED lights alone."

His mixes were nothing short of magic and yet made with gear that was definitely not made for DJs, a concept that was completely novel back then.  My point is, if you can make people dance, and you can do this repeatedly over time, you will build a following. The ONLY thing that matters is the end result: people having a good time and dancing their asses off (their perspective) and people spending a lot on drinks (the club owner's perspective).  Remember, knowing how to make people to dance and enjoy themselves is a gift, a gift not many of us have. If you have it, use it. It doesn't matter in the least how you do it or what gear you use to get it done. All that matters is that people will dance, have a great time and they will remember your name.

The sort of people that have mixes up on SoundCloud and a Facebook fan page a week after they've owned their first ever DJ set up.

Beatmatch,2zgu0y,gregmolnar,1 point,Thu Mar 19 07:38:46 2015 UTC,"Actually you'll be expected to play on the CDJs and mixer provided by the club, and most likely there won't be room for either a cheap controller or a fancy one with all the bells and whistles. That's usually the case at more established clubs that have their own equipment - usually 3 or 4 CDJs and a DJM800 or higher. That's what you need to know how to play on at most clubs, just the basic truth."
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,DJ_Theo,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:08:51 2015 UTC,"Really depends on who's hiring.  there will be some promoters/clubs that look down on all controllers and there will be others that simply don't have room for other gear and don't want you moving their shit around.  Cheap gear has more of a stigma than more professionally oriented gear though.  If you limit yourself to just being able to dj on your own controller, then you can potentially be limiting the places and people you play for.  The thing is, you don't need a fancy cdj setup to learn how to play on them.  If you have a grasp of the fundamentals and don't rely on all the bells and whistles to dj, then you can play on anything.  A good dj should be able to rock a crowd using only 2 music sources, eqs, volume faders, and pitch controls.  If you can't play without all the extras like effects, sync, remix decks, cue points, loops, etc.  all you're doing is limiting yourself to only playing at places that allow you to bring your own gear and therefore the amount of places you are able to play."

Seeing someone with just a controller does not give me confidence on their technical ability, extensive track selection or appreciation for the dj culture because they're so popular with beginners and I've never seen anything truly impressive come out of a controller. Do what you want and do what works for you, but I strongly suggest that you always strive to improve yourself and your equipment."
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,MCMixing,4,Sun Mar 22 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"I thinks it's good for you to learn how to mix without a controller. There will be a lot of clubs or bars that have spent a lot of money on their own CDJ or vinyl set up and a booth for their DJs to spin in. I've had club owners ask me NOT to bring my controller, even though I prefer my DDJSX over CDJs, because they want me to utilize what they provide and have paid for.  As far as it being frowned upon, eh, who gives a fuck? The promoter, owner, and club goers really don't care either way as long is your mix is solid and your track selection is legit. However if you are wanting to make an impression on the other DJs then CDJ or vinyl mixing will grab their attention. That's just for bragging rights and recommendations though. The only thing the other DJs can do for you is recommend you for gigs, but if a promoter or owner are already offering you gigs using your own equipment, then why bother impressing the other DJs?  Just my 2 cents.  EDIT: I meant to reply to the OP, my bad, I'll still leave this hear for him to read."
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,DR1LLM4N,6,Wed Mar 18 14:31:30 2015 UTC,"What does the controller has to do with 'extensive track selection'?  Have you heard anything from Ritchie Hawtin? He plays 4 decks with controllers and I think I can say he is fucking good.  A controller just makes it easier to use loops and be creative with someone else's tracks by playing multiple songs together and not just transition them.   Also at end of the day the most important thing is whether the crowd like you or not. They don't care about what tools you use to play, they just want to dance.  By the way I only DJ for about 6 months, I use controllers and I welcome your honest opinion on my track selection: https://www.mixcloud.com/gregmolnar/bash-vol-6/"
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,gregmolnar,3,Wed Mar 18 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Richie Hawtin is not the best example of anything. Not even mixing and track selection, he's got quite a god complex."

What i don't like about Richie is how he doesn't seem to care about the messups, i think i've seen too much ""fuck you i'm richie hawtin"" videos where his tracks ended without him realizing, him making super sloppy and crappy transitions, the one where he threw the CDJ2000.  I don't mean to cuss on him , he's always been a talented fellow and he's got quite an unique and recognized place in the scene. But i don't like when this makes people lose their professionality  hahah, sorry if it came out like some sort of rant, i think it partly was :p"
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,Jinnobi,4,Thu Mar 19 07:19:27 2015 UTC,"It's a perception thing.  Someone who shows up with a beginner controller and refuses to play on anything else - even if there's a proper pro setup available - is going to seem like beginner. And anyone with experience in booking Djs know that most beginners haven't learned to read crowds, play for their times slots or even the event they're booked for, and likely hasn't built up a proper collection of music that they know inside and out.  Whether it's actually true or not is besides the point because perception does matter in almost any industry and it especially does in DJing. It's the same reason that executives wear tailored suits and drive expensive cars - what they wear and drive should have no bearing on how they do their job, but for the people hiring, it does and that's simply the reality of life.  You can't bring up Ritchie Hawtin to make your case because he's Ritchie Hawtin and you're a beginner with only 6 months experience.  Ritchie Hawtin can play on anything he wants because he's gotten to that level.  But Ritchie Hawtin can also play on cdjs if his laptop breaks down 5 minutes before the gig and only has a usb of some of his tunes."
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,dj_soo,3,Thu Mar 19 12:04:27 2015 UTC,"Man, I didn't say it is OK if you can't play on anything else than a controller. What I said is, track selection has nothing to do with the gear you play with.   You mentioned laptop breakdown which is a really good point why someone should be able to play on the club's setup. But if you can play with a controller you shouldn't have any problem with a CDJ as beatmatching is not too difficult(at least to me), and CDJs also has the sync button if that's what you prefer. But I still prefer to play with my own gear, my own samples, my roughly prepared playlist etc  I don't really agree on the experience thing you mentioned. First of all, in my eyes playing music is art and if you have the talent you can be as good with a few months experience as someone with a few years. It also matters how much time you spend with music? My profession is programming and I worked with guys who had 6 month experience but they knew more than others with 6 years. They had the talent for programming and they learned a lot faster. So years don't really matter in my opinion."
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,gregmolnar,2,Thu Mar 19 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"Here's the hard cold truth - if you're a top40 DJ playing at some random bar, then 95% of the time you can show up with your controller and rock the house. Nobody is going to think twice or bat an eyelid. You're basically just a jukebox playing all the hits and classics that people will recognize and want to jam out. Nothing wrong with that, but you're basically just fading between tracks with maybe a scratch here or there.  If you're a DJ that specializes in a particular sub-genre of music, such as tech house jungle or hard dance for example, then you're expected to be an expert in that genre and therefore have experience. If you're playing in a club that has a $2k+ setup and caters specifically to only techno for example, the promoter will probably be wary if you ask to show up and play on your Ricky dink $200 plastic controller instead of their setup. Most promoters at a club like this want a DJ with experience rocking the house and reading the crowd, and asking to play on a controller while trying to blast some hard trance or liquid DnB is a slight perception problem. In a way, yes the equipment you play on does matter. Whether or not you have the actual skill is irrelevant - a lot of other people will judge the book by its cover."
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,DJ_Theo,1 point,Thu Mar 19 07:31:46 2015 UTC,we aren't talking about possibilities.  We're talking about perception.  And the truth is that someone with a shitty controller demanding to play on their shitty controller - especially when there's a profressional setup available - will be perceived as a n00b and some promotors or clubs will judge and subsequently not hire based on that even if that DJ might happen to be really good on their shitty controller.
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,dj_soo,0,Thu Mar 19 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"I just find those sets to be pretty narrow minded. Beginners with controllers might have a shit ton of deep house or tech house or whatever, but what about music that's not house? Last week I had three of the most different types of gigs imaginable, my grandmother's 80th birthday party, my residency at a lounge/bar and a hip-hop show with a rap group. Every single crowd was very appreciative of my varied setlist, and extremely vocal about telling me that they liked how I spin vinyl. So yeah, people don't care about your tools if it's plastic, but they can and will care if its worth it.   EDIT: wasn't talking about you specifically, homie. I just saw the link to your mix and I'll check it out today!"
Beatmatch,2zgu0y,MCMixing,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't say anything about multi genre, as I play electronic music only. I am a bit fuzzy on the genres so I wouldn't say I play house, tech house or techno, but I guess those are the closest one to my style.  I am pretty sure there are quite a few very big names, who couldn't play a hip-hop gig, as they are not interested in hip-hop so they could probably mix it but if the DJ doesn't enjoy it, the gig isn't gonna be as good as it could be.  So my point is that, tools don't matter. If you have the talent and the determination you can move the crowd with whatever you prefer.   My biggest problem with vinyl is the the size by the way. I moved to 3 times in the last 2 years(each time to another country) and I have way too many stuff. I just gave up on physical books and records because digital helps me to carry a shitload more stuff in my pocket :)."

But they're already established and they're pushing the boundaries with what they can do with a traditional setup. If you're doing nonstop things to make the mix sweeter and to get more people dancing then by all means, go ahead and use your controller! But if you're using 2 decks and doing basic mixing. You really need to learn how to dj the traditional way. Most clubs nowadays have CDJ2000's and they're basically controllers with the laptop built in. Just show up early with some USB sticks and headphones and mess around and figure out how they work. It's not hard. I did it. Many djs I know and work with went straight from a S4 to cdj's. As a resident dj at a club, whenever I see someone with a controller I hope to hear some amazing 3 and 4 deck mixing skills but I haven't yet."

Beatmatch,2zhtxs,djjaneiro,2,Wed Mar 18 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't necesserily buy them for 150CAD, especially since you need two, here in europe they go for 40CAD a piece, which is a whole different world. But I don't know the prices for any gear in canada, so there is that (for comparison, one CDJ2000 nexus costs ~2600CAD here).   Compared to buying any MIDI/HID compatible CDJ I think they are great (if they are cheap, however). Another thing to consider is that a proper DJ software is needed (as stated here). Also you still need a mixer and maybe and accessory controller like the kontrol X1.  All in all, I think they are better than choosing not to learn beatmatching, but consider that just these won't be enough, you still need a mixer and a proper DJ software (with some routing, the right dj software and under certain conditions you could use ableton's built in mixer).  Edit: I should clarify, the thing is that I think you may get something better for the price, you would need two of the 101s, 300CAD, then a soundcard, let's say the traktor audio 2 which is 140CAD, a mixer section, e.g. the behriger CMD MM1 50CAD and ~70CAD for the traktor license, and e.g. an kontrol X1 (250CAD, but iirc comes with a traktor license) or something similar (you don't really need it, but sooner or later you want to have something like it) which leaves you at 560CAD without the X1 or with 740CAD."

It all depends, I must admit I quite like this approach because it leaves you with a very flexible, adaptabe setup which still has all the basics.   One thing worth considering is portability vs an all-in-one solution, though. But that's all preference, I don't really like all-in-one controllers, because with a setup like I described you may have to ludge around less than with an all in one controller as you can use nearly all th egear present in the booth you are playing.

The funny thing is, to my understanding, the RX has more functionality than the 2000s. 2000s will be pretty damn easy after a bit of practise on the RX.   If you want good cdj practise on your sr, just turn off beat grids, and don't rely on sync either.

Beatmatch,2zg2og,Kyderra,2,Wed Mar 18 09:25:49 2015 UTC,The SR does not allow additional inputs from hardware (other than 1 aux). The SZ does have this so CDJs/TTs can be added on. I believe the XDJ-RX has this ability as well.   The CDJ/Mixer setup will cost you quite a bit more and the controller (RX) gives you the same functionality without the laptop for much less. Actually less than the cost of 1 CDJ-2000. I would go with the RX for home and you will still be able to jump right on CDJs at the club.
Beatmatch,2zg2og,KrazyTrain18,2,Wed Mar 18 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"Do you think the XDJ-RX will be okay to be able to understand how to do everything on the CDJs?   Short answer, yes.   It's almost the same device put into one.  You can even learn CDJ's with the $800,- XDJ-R1 version if you want."

I think it might be the settings?? All the drivers are up to date, etc.   Sorry for hijacking the post, but to the OP, try and check out JWill's FX layer maps.

Beatmatch,2zbx6j,outoftheordinaryform,2,Wed Mar 18 02:05:26 2015 UTC,This is supposed to work:  https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202305054-Backing-up-and-moving-your-library-to-a-new-computer  Although I don't recall having much luck with it and was forced to rebuild all my serato crates the last time I got a new laptop.  All the songs would appear in the crates but would be missing when attempting to load
Beatmatch,2zbx6j,tilldrop,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Mixxx did the same thing when I switched music libraries. The program saved the crates that you made and the pathways to get to those files. So Serato is looking for the file in the old location. Since that location no longer exists, it won't load. You might be able to assign a new file location, but you have to do it manually. Its easier just to rebuild the crates."
Beatmatch,2zbx6j,ca_va_bien,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:39:31 2015 UTC,What's the size of your current HD? Maybe you can just get a bigger one (either for your current or next maschine) since you can get a 2TB one for 100+some$. An alternative would be to put a second HD in your current Pro. I've done that with mine so that I have a 256SSD and a 2TB HD. That should be plenty to work with I guess. Or do I underestimate the space needed for 55000 songs?
Beatmatch,2zbx6j,tilldrop,1 point,Tue Mar 17 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"I've got a 750, and it is pretty close to full. There isn't too much in the way of other stuff on there, so I'd say the collection is around 500-600G's. Adding another internal is possibly not a bad idea. How do you have your drives set up? Is the system on the SSD? I've always been a bit worried using my internal storage for both the system and my music collection. I don't want to overwork the drive and kill the motor."

But OP, what controller you use doesn't matter if the mix you do is good. Not everyone in the world realizes this, but it's the honest truth. I've seen people on CDJ-2000s do just absolutely awful mixes while I've also seen people on other controller models by Hercules just absolutely make the entire place jump.  If you can DJ on your mobile phone better than the next guy can DJ on $6,000 equipment, I'd rather listen to you. Aesthetics and pricetag don't make up for bad skill on behalf of a DJ. Only good skill can make up for that."

If they are rocking out and having fun, that's the only thing we should care about.  Companies release gear like this because it'll sell, so they can make more money. Their margins are razor thin on a lot of equipment (not EVERY manufacturer, but most) so they need to sell more to make money. So, they release updates every year because, well, that's the only way people will buy more gear."

Beatmatch,2z824m,Aexibit,2,Tue Mar 17 01:10:05 2015 UTC,"I gave it a listen last night. It was sound mix.  All of the transitions sounded smooth and the phrasing was well done.  Stylistically, I don't know much about deep house, but I know a little about Melbourne Bounce. Due to the high energy and the general formula of Melbourne Bounce, sometimes it can be easy to kill the groove. The chorus is high energy and exciting, i.e. dance time. The verse is low energy and often lacks a beat, i.e. break time.  Since the chorus often only lasts 4 phrases, going back and forth between the two too often (dance, break, dance, break, dance, break, etc...) doesn't leave enough time to dance and can be frustrating on the dance floor. Try mixing up the pattern with a double drop or buildup during the first phrases of your outro or the last phrases of a chorus. This will shorten your break time and lengthen your dance time. This isn't guaranteed to sound good with every song, but it can definitely payoff. Your last transition into Polluted is a good example of what I mean."

I do not know how you mixed it just using a soundcard, but the transitions do need some work imo.   The first thing i noticed was that some of the tracks were not quite beatmatched when the transition was made, mainly the transition from track 1 to 2 is a bit rough.   Another thing i noticed was that some of transitions were just a clear crossfader switch. This can be a desired effect but it is very easy to hear. Maybe try mixing in different levels (high, mid, low) one at a time. This can make the songs blend more instead of it just being a simple transition.  Otherwise nice, reminds me of ""2manydjs/soulwax"" :)"
Beatmatch,2z824m,cruxclaire,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:14:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice - I really appreciate it!  It was generally just crossfader switches, because I was using Mixxx with just the soundcard to find the parts of tracks I wanted to transition into without a controller. I'll have to look into key mapping (I'm not sure if it's possible with Mixxx), because otherwise I'm physically unable to change more than one setting at a time, since I was just using the mouse/trackpad.   If I mix switch the EQ levels one at a time, is it generally advisable to start with a particular setting (highs/mids/lows), or does it depend more on the track? If I can get a controller eventually or map out the keys, I'd like to try raising, say, the bass on the incoming track at the same time as lowering on the outgoing track, etc."
Beatmatch,2z824m,nielsegh,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:30:39 2015 UTC,"This is where it gets a bit tough without a controller :) I usually start an incoming track without the low, and then slowly introduce the highs and mids with the fader. Then i wait for a break in outgoing song and introduce the low from the incomming track. But it of course depends, and this might be more suitable for techno and house."

Definitely give the mixes a listen back and try again when something clashes like that. A lot of time's i'll record my mixes and when I hear something I will just give it another go, also sometimes two songs just don't mesh well. As far as most of the other tracks go I think you did a great job, and there were a couple really spot on transitions as well. The last song was the other one where I think your phrasing was off. Only other thing I can critique is your use of the filter. Could just be me but when you completely cut the track out on the builds it really hurts the flow of the mix in my opinion.

I think a lot of the transitions are pretty on-point; nothing flashy most of the time, just clean mixes. Biggest gripe is going from Destination to Dare You 2 Move... I feel like going from something uplifting to something so dark was a bit jarring. Feel like I'm ready to start experimenting with some more technical stuff. I also really love a lot of these new tracks: Summer is finally coming. All feedback is welcome."

It was a quick practice session I had before heading out to see Dada Life a few weeks ago.  I was trying out a new reverb technique I learned from /u/zoink43 to build and release noise during phrases. It's peppered in throughout the mix. I also gave looping the outgoing track on the buildup a try. You can hear one during the transition to Boing Clash Boom @ 10:40, I missed the timing slightly.  I don't really get a lot of feedback on my mixes, so anything will help. Particularly, I'd love some feedback on transitioning into vocal intros, such as the transition into Heroes @ 13:45. I'm also looking for any tips or techniques on how to vary/create, breakdowns and buildups for transitions or drops, without having to rely on the ones already in the song."
Beatmatch,2z824m,Krogers128,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"So i did listen to the whole thing, i'm pretty new at this (my mix is right below yours) but anything might help right? I kinda of think LRAD hung around too long when you mixed over to Rolling stone T shirt, idk what it was, but it just sounded a little funny in my opinion. the transition after that was not bad, i could tell you were looping the track forsure, i'm not sure if that's good or bad? but it worked and sounded fine to me. As for the mix into Heroes, I dunno  if this will make sense, might be a personal preference, but I dislike vocal songs playing over another song, unless its an acapella, it just sounds messy. I mean it worked, but i just feel like mixing the singing of the incoming song into the outro of another sounds weird. try using more cue points in a song maybe. the ability to jump within a song can help spice things up a bit and not constantly working on mixing intro/outro. the rest of it was pretty good, i think!! love me some deorro, seen him 4 times never gets old. anyways like i said i'm new to djing myself but i have listened to countless sets and heard good and bad haha. feel free to check mine out, hope i helped somewhat. EDIT: on my mix, I did do two ""vocal"" intros. one at 19:45 and another at 22:48 let me know if that is similar to what you're trying?"

I'm guessing you were trying use an intro that builds up. Good concept, but maybe a quicker build up.   Very solid transitions, though. I really liked them. The tracks you've chosen go well together. You really built up the energy level as you went on with your mix.  I would like to note that there were time some transition where your beat matching were just a bit off. nothing major, but just a tiny bit off, specifically around the 12:30 mark.

Beatmatch,2z7gn4,Okidoki_Sir,7,Fri Mar 20 09:34:09 2015 UTC,"It really depends on which way you want to look at it. The techniques of DJ's can be seriously varied at times. Two of my favorite DJ's are Andy C and Mix Master Mike, both incredibly skilled people, but the mixing style couldn't be any more different.  Also, how do you rate them? Is it their technical ability, or how well they can rock a crowd? Production ability? Personality? Way too many variables.  When it comes to your own personal abilities, I feel it can mostly be summed up with your confidence. Think you are good enough to have people listen to one of your mixes? O.k, that's one level. Confident to play out to a small crowd? There's another level. It's really a subjective thing."

Beatmatch,2z7gn4,steamcube,6,Mon Mar 16 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"I believe that you can differentiate a DJ just starting out vs. a DJ with a few years experience, but after that, stylistic development starts and that's where the spectrum becomes grey. If you can transition well, select good songs, and have a few tricks up you're sleeve, you're golden. You can't really judge how good two DJs of different styles are without putting your own preconceived ideas of what you find works for you, and at that point it's trivial.   In short, the more experience you have, the harder it gets. In the end, DJing  isn't about being better than another person, it's about rocking an event, leading the crowd, and letting them into your mindset with the song choices you make."
Beatmatch,2z7gn4,Kokkothespacemonkey,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"I guess the biggest thing I was trying to come to terms with, was that the crowd decides if you're good or not. Like you said ones you can transition well and select good songs it's all creative"

Beatmatch,2z7o6z,pyg1991,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:03:53 2015 UTC,"what version are you running? serato have released at least one or two major updates in the last several month so it may be worth updating. also, have you checked the firmware for the DDJ? I ask because when I got my SZ I had to do a firmware flash because what it came packaged with was out of date. Check the serato and the pioneer sites for possible updates/missing utilities or drivers you may not have the latest versions for.   Serato is one of the most stable DAW's Ive used in regards to DJ'ing so Id be surprised if the problem wasnt rectified after updating software/firmware."

Normally I find that when a piece of hardware is bugging out, its likely due to a driver or firmware issue rather than the device itself. I've saved many a day by not throwing away that piece of hardware that seemed to be dead and instead reflashing the firmware."

Beatmatch,2z7wb9,Lloydehh,5,Mon Mar 16 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"grab a box and upgrade your mixer unless you can afford a rane serato mixer.  Serato is also coming out with a license that allows you to run DJ on select Pioneer and alan and heath mixers, but those are only for the higher end ones and are also pretty pricey.  SL2 is $500 USD brand new, but you can probably find one used for around $300  The newer Denon DS-1 will be $300 USD"

Beatmatch,2z7wb9,dj_soo,2,Mon Mar 16 12:38:44 2015 UTC,Do keep in mind that the mixer is where you'll spend most of your time. Rane ones are expensive though. The revision of the TTM57SL might be a solid choice.
Beatmatch,2z7wb9,junglizer,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:07:12 2015 UTC,That's going to be way more than £1000

Beatmatch,2z7wb9,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:24:50 2015 UTC,Looking to scratch at all?  Are you set on serato or are you willing to try traktor?  Something for strictly home use or something you can take to gigs?
Beatmatch,2z7wb9,zoink43,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:58:26 2015 UTC,"It'd be pretty cool to learn to scratch, and the goal is to be able to play locally."
Beatmatch,2z7wb9,zoink43,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"I would look at a Z2 (~ £550) and then either use it with Traktor or, if you prefer serato, grab a Denon DS1 whenver those come out (~ £230) and midi map the controls to Serato.  I'm a Serato guy myself and while you will get more out of the Z2 if using Traktor, it's still a pretty good midi mixer for the price with great faders for scratching.  One of my regular spots has a Z2 installed and I use it with Serato and it works perfectly fine.  The other option for Serato, but more expensive, would be to look at a Rane 61 (~ £999) which is a better mixer in terms of sound and components imo, but with less features than the Z2, but will come with Serato built-in."
Beatmatch,2z7wb9,zoink43,2,Tue Mar 17 15:43:54 2015 UTC,"I assume you want to use your turntables as DVS control?  Your best bet probably is the Akai AMX, which offers DVS control, acts as a mixer and already comes with a full license for Serato DJ, but needs to be upgraded with the DVS expansion pack for the use of DVS control with turntables.  Only downside is that if you plan on playing out on another mixer and can't bring/use your AMX for whatever reasons you have to purchase the Serato club kit AND even then only the hardware named on the site works, otherwise you will have to bring the AMX or you ditch the club kit and lend a serato certified audio interface.  Another solution could be the Denon DS1, which basically is like the Rane SL2, a serato certified audio interface. Downside is that you will have to use your old mixer or purchase a new one and you need to touch your computer to load tracks (which you won't have to do with the AMX as it has browse controls). Plus side is you can play on any mixer.  Overall I'd go with the AMX, it isn't that big so you won't have much trouble taking it with you, and (assuming you are a begginer) most of the early gigs you will have have shitty in-house equipment (if any) anyways so you will bring your own gear nevertheless. These two are the most cost-effective solutions I could think of, knowing your budget would help!"
Beatmatch,2z7wb9,junglizer,3,Mon Mar 16 11:06:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your response.  The AMX looks great, then would i just buy the timecode vinyl and i'd be ready to go?"

My main gripe has been not enough gain on the Input amplifiers when using a device like an iPad or phone on the RCA inputs and now, after 3 years of love and gigging, a couple of my buttons are starting to not respond unless I press harder than normal - but they still work and it's a while off being dead yet."
Beatmatch,2z7p3o,tmccoy00,1 point,Mon Mar 16 10:12:34 2015 UTC,"You could hang on to your S2 and buy an additional controller instead. For example, maybe the Traktor F1 cmight be a more handy choice for a controller, to manipulate the remix decks. It all depends on exactly you want to do. I would think it's very rare that people would actually want 4 peer decks, usually they want 2 main decks plus 1 or 2 extra decks for samples and stuff."
Beatmatch,2z7p3o,bart2019,2,Mon Mar 16 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"Naw, you still want the 4 decks even with an F1.

I found it too easy to forget which decks the transport controls were currently assigned to, and having to stop and think about it irritated me. This applies to four deck mixing on any all-in-one controller, though, and it probably isn't a big deal for most people.  Having filter nobs and VU meters on each channel is a nice upgrade from the S2."
