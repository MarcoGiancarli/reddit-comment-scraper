Next time you ask her out, maybe invite her to your place instead so she knows its an option.   As for all the favors, if they are starting to bother you, always know that saying no is an option and she won't be offended if you say so.   Either way, seems like this could turn into a nice situation, just try not to over think, and let things happen on their own time.   Good luck and hope everything works out."

dating_advice,3e5rwf,redsuppository,3,Wed Jul 22 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"I was asked by a girl at work to come over to her house on a Friday night to help her move in.   When a girl likes you, she does stuff like this to get you alone.   After a few hours of building some IKEA furniture (and drinking a little bit of alcohol) things got a little heated up.   Who initiated?   We had some fun, but couldn’t go all the way even though we both genuinely wanted to (neither one of us had a condom).    You could have gone out and bought one.   She mentions how she’s scared of staying in this new house alone because she’s a female all by herself. I mention to her that she’s welcome at my place any time, and she kind of just smiles.   She obviously wanted you to spend the night at her place; I don't understand your response. Imagine what must be going through her head when you are just so oblivious to an obvious advance.  If she were distant in the days following, I think you would agree that it was because you failed utterly to take the lead. From her perspective, you either are oblivious, or weak, or not attracted to her because you obviously didn't try very hard. I mean, she practically invites you to stay the night and you say she's always welcome at your place. What the fuck is that?   The small little favors continue each day throughout the week, and I begin realizing that the only time she comes to see me is when she needs help with something.   These favors are an excuse to talk to you; you made shit so awkward that she can't just come over for no reason.   We honestly had a fantastic time keeping each other company, but she had a little too much to drink and ended up getting sick. I took care of her and put her to bed. She drunkenly asks me to please stay. Luckily I had packed a “just in case” bag of clothes for work the next morning. When we awoke, she was surprisingly not that hung over and thanked me for staying with her.   I think she's using alcohol to get things moving because you don't take the lead. Most girls are not comfortable making the first move, so she gets drunk in hopes that something happens. She asks you to stay again, which is horribly sad because she's just throwing herself at you and you refuse to do anything about it.   Before we parted our separate ways, she kissed me, which I was kind of taken back by, because up to this point we had only kissed while under the influence of alcohol (even if it was after a drink or two). She mentions that she wants me to stay over again but I disagree, only because she lives with a male roommate who I haven’t met yet because he only stays there like once or twice a week, because he works in another city. According to her they have been friends with for quite some time). I don’t want things to be awkward with me being there since I’m the ‘new guy’, and decide that it’s probably best to show her that I have somewhat of a life outside of being with her anyways.    This is seriously depressing; I genuinely feel bad for this woman. She kisses you and asks you to stay again; what the fuck is wrong with you? You keep making excuses for yourself why you can't be with this girl; no condoms, she's too drunk, her roommate; it's pathetic.   I’m just a little concerned now that she may just be keeping me around for help/emotional stability/support, or just as someone to keep her company. I wanna nip this in the bud before I really start falling for her.   Hell no; she wanted to have sex with you. She's probably got low self-esteem which is why she hasn't moved on. Most girls would drop you like a sack of potatoes after that first night.  I think that maybe you have low self-esteem as well and that's why you won't have sex with this woman; you don't feel like you deserve someone who truly wants you. So you make excuses for yourself and rationalize that she must be using you somehow."

I was the one who initiated getting intimate with her, not vice versa.   The second time we fooled around, she got sick as we were in the middle of getting intimate. If she wouldn't have, than I would have 100% had sex with her that night. Trust me.  I also typed the 'you can stay at my place anytime' part out of order. It was already concluded that I was gonna stay the night. I mentioned my place as we were laying in bed as an afterthought to make sure she knows she always welcome to come over.   Just trust me, I'm trying my hardest. I think you're being a little harsh with your words but at the same time its what I need to hear. The truth is I think I may have a lowered self-esteem from being single for so long. Regardless, thanks for taking the time to give me some advice."

dating_advice,3e4p53,redsuppository,2,Wed Jul 22 00:49:00 2015 UTC,One way to tell if a girl is receptive to being kissed is if she is looking at your lips. Usually they go back and forth between looking into your eyes and looking at your lips.

dating_advice,3e3eno,anon1211,5,Tue Jul 21 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"A couple of points that don't directly answer your question, but will go someway to helping, I hope. Im 24M, first off, I cannot flirt with girls in clubs, that atmosphere is not one for me.   Second, if I am to flirt with a girl, she has to reciprocate. Typically it can start off with a simple compliment, somewhat like one you mentioned, if she returns it in her own way and you think she's into it, it will lead into something else maybe a little more 'daring'.  With regards to what to say, my friends and I always used to compliment give a compliment about a girl, and lead it into a question, for example 'I love your tattoo, when did you get that?' or maybe something about her actions/surroundings 'I noticed you from across the room, do you mind if I sit with you?.. Yes? Would you like a drink?' etc etc.  Sometimes the tame stuff is better to start with rather than coming off as a real flirt unless you're an expert at it. The key is to get out there and get meeting strangers, the more you do it, the easier it will come.   I was once out for a friends birthday in a bar and sat down next to some girls. I wasn't looking to meet anyone, but smoker at the time, I asked one of the girls for a lighter. She didn't seem to want to talk but after a little small talk she opened up and her friend joined in too. We talked in more of a tame manner when the friend turned round and said to me 'She's got a boyfriend, but are you going to buy me a drink?'.  It came totally unexpected and was rather welcomed, but I had evidently said something right.   I think what I am trying to get at is just talk, talk to girls and see where it goes. The biggest flirt can end up being already in a relationship and a total dead end if you want more than just a chat, while the quiet shy girl who eventually opens up can turn into something more."
dating_advice,3e3eno,tk338,11,Tue Jul 21 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"Knowing what to say becomes so much easier when you focus more on listening.   She wants to have a good time. Listen to what's being said, and try and be witty and have fun. Quickly come up with inside jokes and nicknames you can use. Like if a girl says she is super tired, I'll call her zombie or zombs for the night. Tease her about her occupation, and see if you can relate it to you in a fun way. Like if she wants to go into law enforcement I'd be making jokes all night about that.  Overexaggerate how good she is at her hobbies. Maybe even take it yhe other way and tease her and say ""your pretty good, just wait till you see me do it"" and give them a type of smile that makes it clear you are being silly.   If you have a similar interest in comedies you've watched, bring them up and make them inside jokes. Videos are viral, it's very likely you've both laughed at a video you thought was funny."

dating_advice,3e3eno,hucky0,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you can learn to flirt from just one reddit post.  This is where you should start:  Understand that your interaction with this lady, though respectful, is no different in basic primal motivation than a caveman clubbing a woman over her head and dragging her back to the cave and that this lady understands this instinctively. She knows it's all about sex , wants you to be a man that isn't afraid of that fact and also to behave in a way that is socially acceptable. So basically, be aware of the motivation and completely cool with it without laying it all out there clumsily.  Then be confident in yourself, humorous and push the interaction forward.  Don't rush into it, just try to observe and learn, at first."

Maybe you're making these first dates out be more than they really are.  Essentially, the first date isn't really a date at all -- or at least you shouldn't think of it as one.  It's just a test to see if there's enough chemistry to bother with a ""real"" date beyond coffee / drinks.  Don't make it out to be a big deal.  That's usually a huge turn off for girls.  And even if you do everything ""right,"" keep in mind that there's no guarantee of success. Chemistry isn't a science, and you can't create it if it's not there."

Just spill out whatever you are thinking. If she is someone really worth being with, she will understand and respond appropriately.

If that's tricky, I've read some decent advice to go to a touristy area near you and to ask someone to take a picture of you.

It probably is better to have someone take your picture (and by that I don't mean professional, you can just have someone take pictures of you with your phone). You should have a couple of face and body-shots. Make sure the pictures represent what you typically look like in person. Meaning if you usually wear glasses, then wear glasses in your picture. If you typically have a light-beard/5 o'clock shadow, then don't take a picture of you clean-shaven. If you usually wear a hat when you go out, then have at least one picture with your hat on. Stuff like that.  With the body-shots, wear your usual everyday clothes (don't put on a suit and tie if you're usually a jeans and t-shirt kinda guy), but also don't try to hide any significant flaws. I'm not saying wear a skin-tight shirt, but if you got a little weight on you, don't wear some big baggy shirt that hides it all, so they think you've got a six-pack under there.   The thing is that you want to present yourself as you are. Remember, the goal is to eventually meet someone in person, and you don't want them feeling deceived or disappointed. That doesn't do you any good."

This is a picture that people can use to identify you in any pictures you have with family/friends. So at least one picture of just you (headshot or full body, doesn't matter) and at least one full body picture (it could be you alone, or you in a group setting). Think of it this way. If you were looking at a woman's pictures - what would you want to see? You'd want to see what she looks like in the face probably, you'd also like to see what she looks like in terms of height (and weight). A picture with her family/friends could tell you things she is interested in, or the type of girl she is. It's the same with guys. They want to see your face, they want to see your build, and they want to see normal pictures of you. Doesn't matter if it is you alone, or you with a large group.

dating_advice,3e5h1j,Thedaterthrowaway,4,Wed Jul 22 02:42:46 2015 UTC,"help me out should I bother continuing to be friends with this girl   Well the first question is, can you? Maybe you need some time to re-calibrate yourself.   Don't hold it against her that she's seeing somebody else though, we all like what we like...and at 19 we don't know whether we are picking the right person or not. I know it hurts, but this is life. I don't think there is anything wrong with staying cordial, but if you feel shitty in her presence, then I would pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move along."
dating_advice,3e5h1j,happypillows,2,Wed Jul 22 03:00:50 2015 UTC,Thanks dude.
dating_advice,3e5h1j,hucky0,2,Wed Jul 22 03:08:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also don't feel obliged to spend time with her because of what she said, only do it when you've moved on emotionally and seeing her again won't bring those feelings back."
dating_advice,3e5h1j,kaboxx,4,Wed Jul 22 04:13:00 2015 UTC,"The mature thing to do here my friend.. Is to  go on as nothing has changed. Dont create an awkward situation, because things can get messy! Tell her things will be the same, but you just need a little space to figure things out, and get a good grasp of the situation. So you can be in a better place about it, because like you said it hurts to be in that situation. One thing she has to realize though things will change, she crossed the line of dropping that bomb on you! but yes best situation is to dust yourself off and keep it going. Without the need of of ruining the small friendship you guys have left. Dont show her that it bothers you man. Once the dust settles, and your mind is cleared out, you can really decided what you want to do"

dating_advice,3e57hl,hucky0,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:30 2015 UTC,"but she qualified the date by saying we would be starting as friends and see where it goes from there   Well, considering how the night ended I'm inclined to think that this might be a common occurrence. Or maybe she just got out of a long relationship and is feeling lonely? Either way, you have some mixed messages.   Before I left her place, she reiterated that she still wants to take it slow because she's not sure what she wants, and that she'd like to treat each other as friends at work.   This is sounding more and more like a FWB situation. Or was she feeling regret about the making out?  What you DO know, is that she's conflicted. Whatever the situation, she is off and on and you can't really take anything she does seriously.   Which direction do you want this to go?"
dating_advice,3e57hl,happypillows,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:11:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I should add that we talked a little after getting physical. She briefly mentioned that she had been seeing a guy recently who turned out to be an asshole, so maybe she doesn't want to become too vulnerable too quickly?  At this point it could go either way, I'm just having fun."
dating_advice,3e57hl,happypillows,2,Wed Jul 22 03:25:26 2015 UTC,"so maybe she doesn't want to become too vulnerable too quickly?   Sounds about right.  Yeah, just make sure you don't walk right into her pattern of behavior. Tread carefully, could be a pain in the ass."
dating_advice,3e57hl,redsuppository,2,Wed Jul 22 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"When a girl says take things slow, what she usually means is that you are in some way communicating an over-eagerness to enter into a committed relationship.

Maybe she just never felt the same way, maybe she did or and things changed in her life so she became less emotionally available, or maybe something else entirely.  I would say the instinct to blame yourself is ill-founded.  The best thing you can do, and I mean this from the bottom of the odd, eldricth nightmare-scape I call a soul, is to tell her exactly what you are thinking and feeling.  Tell her it is important and as a friend or anything else or nothing at all you want to understand and you want to be there for her.  I don't know what you will get from it, but if all it is is a straight answer it may be enough."

I was thinking that by the end of this month- that if she doesn't try to text me, I'll give her a shout out and see what's up with her. She's never had a boyfriend, and she's always dealt with her problems alone. In-fact, she was a very solitary individual, but ever since we got closer, she started to open up a little bit and was anything but solitary. So that's basically why this situation confused the heck out of me. Thanks for the advice."

It'd just be selfish right now to put someone through that for the sake of my want for companionship.   You pretty much nailed it on the head here. If you were able to get into another relationship it would most likely end up being toxic.   My advice is to start and find something you're interested in. This may mean having to get out of your comfort zone, but if you want any long term change that has to happen.  Honestly I would cut down on the weed, at least for now to get your motivation in check.   You'd be surprised once you start getting all these things together how much easier it is to find a girl with mutual interests, respect, and attraction.  I know things are rough right now, but I can tell you want to change, and that's how it all starts. Good luck, and I hope things work out for you."

dating_advice,3e1odf,Sanskyv3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"I used to be exactly like you, despite smiling and being generally cheerful.  It took me way too long to figure this one out, but I finally did...  Being approachable is more about how you look at guys and how you react when they look back than how your face looks.  Someone can be unapproachable while smiling all of the time and approachable people don't always smile or look nice.  It is about looking them in the eye, smiling in reaction to them, and reacting to their facial expressions.  Try to start a conversation through eye contact.  That will put you in the right mentality.  For example, if you both witness something surprising, look at him and think ""That was crazy, right?"" and this will probably come across in your face.  It gives him a chance to pick up the conversation with real words."

dating_advice,3e22t6,dashasicard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. I was probably going to go with that plan. Thanks for the advice :)
dating_advice,3e22t6,ohiamsaucy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"No problem! Good luck. I'm similar to you, I'm not above making the first move but I've finally refused to chase. Not worth it!"
dating_advice,3e03ky,fashionite,47,Mon Jul 20 22:44:28 2015 UTC,I tell them I'm trans before the first kiss. It's just dangerous to do anything with them without them knowing. They could react violently. And do you really want to go around making out with transphobes? If you don't tell them you could end up getting frisky with someone who hates your guts and thinks you're a freak. Yuck!
dating_advice,3e03ky,MinorityStress,12,Mon Jul 20 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"i totally get your personal safety being a priority, but i think ethically, it is a really shitty thing not to tell someone for their sake that you're trans before they catch feelings or have sex. i'm not a trans phobe and wish everyone a happy life, but my life counts too, and i think not wanting to have sex with someone because of physical or emotional reasons is my right…i don't think you're implying all this btw, just wanted to give you a different paradigm about it."
dating_advice,3e03ky,desolationrow1,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is going through my brain during all of the interactions as well. That what makes it so difficult. Some girls are out and proud and don't mind people knowing they are trans. I'm completely the opposite, and since I'm stealth I dont want to right away tell every person who asks me to hang out that I'm trans. At that point I barely know anything about them and I don't feel something that private is justified."
dating_advice,3e03ky,desolationrow1,4,Tue Jul 21 05:53:00 2015 UTC,"you're right. i think when it's agreed upon that you two think you might be heading towards a romantic relationship, then it should be said…but when he picks you up to go see the new terminator movie or something, no need to tell him on the way to the theater….you'll know when you should tell him. it's usually when you start feeling guilty for not doing it."
dating_advice,3e03ky,MinorityStress,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:08:22 2015 UTC,"It would be unethical for me to lie and say I'm not trans, but I don't think anyone is entitled to know my private medical history that really has no effect on them whatsoever. I'm only up front about it for safety. There are also many who are emotionally opposed to having sex with black people. Is someone who has, say, 10% black ancestry obligated to announce it before sleeping with anyone? I don't think so."
dating_advice,3e03ky,desolationrow1,5,Tue Jul 21 05:53:03 2015 UTC,"no, not anyone, but anyone you have sex with deserves to know. the second part of your response was strange though, i'll just let that sit..."
dating_advice,3e03ky,MinorityStress,-3,Tue Jul 21 06:05:20 2015 UTC,"How was it strange? We're talking sexual preferences right? Well it doesn't matter to me, but I've encountered many people who say they are only attracted to certain races. Some are really hardcore about it. My friend's dad almost disowned him because his girlfriend's mom is black. So is everyone obligated to announce personal details like this before hooking up with someone? If you're fucking strangers, don't expect to know everything about them. If it's something contagious like herpes, of course it's obligatory to proclaim it. But having sex with a trans person doesn't actually harm you."
dating_advice,3e03ky,Actipissed,4,Tue Jul 21 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"Sex and race is not the same thing at all, especially when it comes to sexual attraction. It's completely disingenuous of you to suggest so. If someone is only attracted to cis women then that's just how they are. Just like being attracted to same sex. Going and throwing attraction of black people into this is freaking idiotic. Attraction to race is cultural and learned behavior. You just want to continue to defend your unethical behavior, don't try to use black people to do it."
dating_advice,3e03ky,MinorityStress,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:42 2015 UTC,"To stop being attracted to trans people only after you find out they're trans is also cultural and a learned behavior. It's the same situation. You're hot for someone until you find something out about them that society has taught you is ""icky."" I wasn't using black people, I was actually using racists."
dating_advice,3e03ky,Actipissed,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"Really..you think being attracted to a certain set of genitals is learned behavior? I find viginas icky in a sexual context, and that isn't something society taught me."
dating_advice,3e03ky,Actipissed,3,Tue Jul 21 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"Uhhhh, what just happened O_O."
dating_advice,3e03ky,desolationrow1,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry, her black ppl comment just ticked me off."
dating_advice,3e03ky,King_Awkward_IV,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"so i bet you would say that being homosexual is biological (which it has been scientifically proven to be), but someone not attracted to trans people are just expressing their trans phobic learned behavior, and they're cis assholes to you. you are ignorant and wrong for telling me that i'm that way for not being attracted sexually to trans people."
dating_advice,3e03ky,VonDoomsday,21,Tue Jul 21 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't hate trans people, but I would not want to have sex with one. There is a difference.  What reactions do you get when you tell guys?"
dating_advice,3e03ky,iblogalot,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:27 2015 UTC,The reactions from telling have varied. A lot if times they just wanna have sex but nothing more. Others have totally nit been cool with it.
dating_advice,3e03ky,VonDoomsday,-14,Tue Jul 21 05:49:23 2015 UTC,There is a difference. If a girl was ok to have sex with before finding out she is trans but not after then the ONLY thing you  are considering and discriminating is her trans status. It doesn't mean you hate Trans people but the action itself is by definition transphobic.
dating_advice,3e03ky,Justice_Prince,11,Tue Jul 21 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"Then by that definition I'd say that the vast majority of heterosexual men are ""transphobic"""
dating_advice,3e03ky,dhockey63,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"Its true, most of society is actually. I don't take it personally unless someone is being especially insensitive. Both LGBT persons and allies can be transphobic at times and i think it's ok if we acknowledge the root of the issues."
dating_advice,3e03ky,King_Awkward_IV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:04 2015 UTC,Or they'd at least say they wouldn't.
dating_advice,3e03ky,VonDoomsday,15,Tue Jul 21 05:06:08 2015 UTC,"Some guys don't want to have intercourse with an vagina sculpted by a surgeon, don't shame them for their sexual preferences."
dating_advice,3e03ky,MinorityStress,7,Tue Jul 21 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"Would you also say that a man who doesn't want to have sex with men is homophobic? I don't think you need to defend who you are and aren't sexually attracted to  I also see some practical problems. I admit I have no practical experience, but I seriously doubt a surgically altered male body is as good in bed as a natural female one. Surely I would notice the difference in many ways? Also, without any chance of kids, I'm not up for a long term relationship.  I do have a lot of sympathy for the rough hand trans people are dealt. OPs question illustrates how much harder it can be. But I don't think that means I owe anyone sex."
dating_advice,3e03ky,DreamSeaker,-6,Tue Jul 21 05:46:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call that homophobic at all if he is straight. Everyone is entitled to choose what they are attracted to but the truth is that straight guys are attracted to trans women because we can, more convincingly than you may believe, appear to be completely like natal girls.   Stories like OP's are common for passing trans girls and many find rejection soley because of their trans status. That doesn't mean every person turning down post op trans women is a transphobic bigot looking to undermine trans people at large. But a guy who politely declines because he is not comfortable is still being transphobic  in that moment even if they are not being a bad person."
dating_advice,3e03ky,dhockey63,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:31 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, and I feel the sane way. I just get caught up in everything and have trouble pulling the trigger on telling."

dating_advice,3e03ky,I3lackcell,11,Tue Jul 21 07:49:04 2015 UTC,"""What and when do guys want to be told"" - They want to be told that you're transgender up front. I guy who isn't ok with that will deny you upfront if you tell him, or later when you finally tell him after you've become emotionally involved with him."
dating_advice,3e03ky,I3lackcell,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:22 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing that is general consensus, but do you think its bad if you hang out first like something casual before you let out all your secrets? I don't want to be telling a guy everytime he walks up to me and shows initial interest. That isn't fair to me either. If that was the case then I would just be completely standoffish to all men in order to have my privacy."
dating_advice,3e03ky,michaelqueue,9,Tue Jul 21 06:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say before physicality, or the third date, whichever is first. It shouldn't be a big deal to you that you are trans. I understand its private, but you aren't ashamed are you? I guess I find it confusing that you wouldn't want to share it before confusion and regrets from either party, and spare emotional investment from both."
dating_advice,3e03ky,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:09 2015 UTC,"Trust me I am not ashamed of being trans, and I have done my part to help the community. In the past I have spoken at several colleges about my life and the issues trans people face openly and honestly. But I choose to live stealth because I came all the way to this point in my life because I just wanted to be like any other girl walking down the street. Not for all the extra bullshit that comes with it, and we both know that the general public doesn't have the best idea of trans people. Being stealth lets me live closest to the type of life ciswomen get to have."
dating_advice,3e03ky,another30yovirgin,6,Tue Jul 21 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"I think you should be telling them before the first date. I personally have no interest in dating a trans woman and would be horrified to find out afterwards. I'm sorry but it's just the way I feel.   You seem to get into this situation a lot from what you said. You need to tell them very early on. It's just not fair to them otherwise.   Any time a guy asks you out, or you ask a guy out, you should tell them. Any guy who doesn't want to be with you because of that will leave straight away and it saves everyone time."
dating_advice,3e03ky,dhockey63,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:30:22 2015 UTC,"I hear that, but I am worried of the repercussions from doing that. Unfortunately, there are a large number of guys who could and would spread that information to other people. That is one of my biggest fears."
dating_advice,3e03ky,hunteqthemighty,8,Tue Jul 21 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'd want to know before we kiss.  I think saying something before a date may be too early.  I would like to hear it by the end of the first date though, assuming it's going well."

dating_advice,3e03ky,mattymatt223,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:03 2015 UTC,"People dont disclose their entire lives before the first date, so I dont see a reason for you to do the same.  I would feel the same way about someone with an STD.  I dont need to know you have herpes before our first date, but i would really like to know before i kiss you.  (not to call being trans an STD, no offense implied).  I wouldnt tell a potential date that i have a fucked up relationship with my mother, before our first date.  That would come up pretty early though I assume, but its not something physical so its a bit different."
dating_advice,3e03ky,CanadaIsOkay,25,Tue Jul 21 14:14:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a straight guy, and I can tell you that I would feel attacked and betrayed if I'd gotten to the point of kissing someone and they revealed to me that they were trans. I'm not homophobic and I'm sure you're a great person, but I don't keep secrets from people I'm interested in, and I would ask that they do the same. That's not what I'm looking for in a relationship, and I'd feel lied to -- not a great way to start out anything worthwhile.  It sounds like you just want to be seen as an attractive lady and I respect that, but I wouldn't mind being seen as that guy who plays Thor and I'm not that either. It's neither of our fault that we are the way we are (it's genetics and fate), and to claim otherwise feels to me like misrepresentation.   I can promise you that there is a guy out there who you see as attractive and who is interested in getting to know you (and eventually be intimate with you) as the person you really are. Being up front about yourself early on will ensure that whoever you're with is the right person for you, and I think that's true for people of any gender or history.  People who are more experienced around transgender issues: I apologize if my opinions here aren't very PC or disrespect you in some way. I don't have a ton of experience with this stuff. OP asked for opinions from dating guys, though, so there you go."

That's not what I'm looking for in a relationship, and I'd feel lied to -- not a great way to start out anything worthwhile.   Agreed. I'm a straight guy, but I'm polyamorous. I would definitely tell someone before the first kiss 'cause I know full well that not everyone's into that, and it's not like they would have any way to know without me telling them.  A relationship founded on deceit is not a very good relationship, and if someone is holding back some knowledge because they think their partner won't want them anymore, then that's deceit."

She hadn't told her roommate and her roommate, a friend of mine, arranged for a blind date. Date went well, we were making out, and my wandering hands got the best of me.  If I had known, would I have still gone out? I don't know. But I was hurt and confused, and frankly upset simply because she had lied through omission and let it go on as far as it did.  Tell him sooner than later."

The later you tell, the more I can ""fall in love"" before the reveal and balance that against my inexperience and shock. I guess if I found out my girlfriend was trans, I wouldn't hater her or like her less, I would still be in love, but I would feel betrayed if it was after an emotional and physical bond."

The real answer is that all guys (and people in general) are going to react differently. Personally, I would want my partner to be as comfortable as possible, and when they're ready, I'd take it as it comes. I'd be fine with it, but other comments here say they wouldn't be.

I wouldn't want you to get into a situation that could potentially endanger you!
dating_advice,3e0ogs,EndersWorld,13,Tue Jul 21 01:32:38 2015 UTC,Maybe she thought there was no chemistry. Maybe she is busy (less likely). My suggestion for you is to move on. Most relationships IRL and from online dating end with the first date. Don't worry too much about this date. Focus on the ones that are yet to come :)

dating_advice,3e0ogs,dhockey63,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:27 2015 UTC,Well she seems to be receptive to hanging out again. She just seems a bit more quiet but that's just through text. I guess I'll have to figure out how she feels when we hangout again if we do.
dating_advice,3e0ogs,pixiepoof,6,Tue Jul 21 02:55:23 2015 UTC,I'm going to offer an opinion . she maybe was texting you a lot ..

When I share my dates with friends they offer bad advice like don't text him first or wait 3 days
dating_advice,3e0ogs,OPPyayouknowme,3,Tue Jul 21 02:41:39 2015 UTC,That's a nice way to look at things. What I think is that she is talking to other tinder guys or something. I'm trying to hangout again to see how it goes. If it doesn't go well or she still gives me the cold shoulder just going to let it go and move on. Thanks for the comment though.

Best compliments is basically saying that you notice characteristic from him. Like "" you are reserved but not really shy"", ""you really care about justice"" or anything. Underline something about him, i know its not really a compliment but it will tell him you are interested enough to notice things about him. Its the kind of compliments guy receives usually and we are most confortable receiving."

Then, move on to complimenting something he does or is good at, rather than simply his appearances. And try to do it in a smooth way, such as in the middle of conversation, as if you just noticed it; instead of out of nowhere which may catch him off guard and leave him with no other option than to change the subject."

dating_advice,3e2n03,Sintaax,0,Tue Jul 21 14:10:49 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like you are getting friend zoned. You might consider asking where this relationship is going and telling her what you want.  If you can't come to an agreement then you can retract slightly from the relationship  (maybe be a bit less touchy Feely so you don't fall deeper in love) without necessarily cutting her out completely.
dating_advice,3e2n03,m4dw0lf,0,Tue Jul 21 15:11:07 2015 UTC,She got out from a year and a half relationship does that maybe meens anything?
dating_advice,3e2n03,m4dw0lf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:03 2015 UTC,That depends on how long ago that was.  What kind of relationship it was and where she is now emotionally.  You might be filling the role of surogate boyfriend. Which means that she gets affection without needing to commit. All those questions can be answered by talking to her

The way you tell the story too, it doesn't seem she was sloppy drunk either.  I think you're in good shape and just plan for the next meeting.  I don't really think there's much you can do about the Southeast Asia trip other than tell her.  I dunno if you can even text her from your destination but that'd obviously help."
dating_advice,3e2jj6,skiptomylou1231,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:00 2015 UTC,"Is she into me or was it the alcohol?   If you talked the next day when she was sober and are going out again, then I'd say she's into you (at least a little bit), and it's not just the alcohol.   If she is into me, how do I keep up attraction? I'm going on a three week trip to Southeast Asia next week, after our meeting. Does this screw me over or is it possible to keep attraction up over this time?   Well, don’t jump the gun here, already thinking 3 weeks ahead. Right now just focus on seeing her this weekend, and trying to continue getting to know her. For all you know, you may find out something about her on the next date that makes you not want to see her again.    But if you do, well, it’s less than ideal, having to split for an extended period of time right as you’re getting to know her. But there’s not all that much you can do about that. Worrying about “keeping up attraction” is pointless and could just drive you nuts. She could met someone else tomorrow and decide she likes him more than you, and that could happen within the next three weeks, whether you’re gone or not.  I don’t want to sound too cliché and be like “if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be” but, really, either you two will pick up right where you left off when you get back or you won’t. I generally don’t recommend a lot of texting at these early stages. But every couple of days maybe you could text her a picture of you out somewhere, just sharing what you’re up to. But my point is, just don’t worry too much about it."

NO. I repeat: do not text her again at all.   omg, she was such a cuty, so much in common, really perfect   No jardeon5 she was not perfect. First of all, no one is. And you only had ONE date with her, so the truth is you don't really know her yet. But what you do know is that right now, and for the foreseeable future, she has a VERY busy schedule, which gives her very little free time. You, on the other hand, are more settled in your life right now, and would like to have a relationship with the someone that you can see, talk to, and be with, on a more regular basis. There's nothing wrong with that. That's totally understandable and, while some could say you were thinking too far ahead, it's actually pretty logical for you to make this decision now. Again, her schedule is unlikely to change anytime soon (however much more time she has to get through Medical School, and then after that starting her career as a doctor), so it's probably better for both of you to not even try to begin something now. She needs someone who is probably not looking for something serious right now, and you need someone who is more available.   The problem is the way you've handled it. Maybe you should have thought it through a little more before you sent the first text, although it sounded like you did. Then you panicked and tried to backtrack. I don't know why, but I suspect it may be because of her reaction. I don't know what you were expecting (or hoping for) her to say, but I think because she reacted so calmly, say it was ""no problem"" and that she specifically said that she wasn't ""thinking so far"" ahead yet, made you think that maybe you shouldn't have been thinking so far head yet either. But I say trust that you've made the right decision.  And, seriously, looking at this from her perspective, why would she give you another chance. You send her a text telling her you can't handle her schedule and then the very next day you text her again saying you might have changed your mind? How is she to know that you won't just change your mind again after a few more dates?  If she were hear asking for advice, I'd tell her to just forget about you.   Just like I'm telling you to forget about her, and move on."

If you can feel beautiful without makeup, I guarantee you will find a guy who feels the same. If you feel awkward or shy without makeup, then your dates are sure to follow suit and be awkward.   Men don't know jack shit about makeup. Wear whatever you want that makes you feel like you could run the world."

You should have a pretty good idea of his sincerity towards you and you obviously know how you feel about him. A lot of the things he is doing are red flags but I can only see so much into the situation being on the outside. Like I said earlier go with what you feel. Address this stuff to him and ask the questions that are making you feel this way.

If you're snooping on him already, get out of this one.  No judgement - you're doing that because something is making you uncomfortable, and that's only going to get worse over time.  The beginning of a relationship should be a fun time when the two of you are really excited about each other and only each other, and if there's already a third person involved, that's just going to get worse and you're going to feel like more of a crazy person.  Good luck."
dating_advice,3e270v,_neutrino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:10 2015 UTC,I did snoop. I lost my phone while on vacation with him and had to use his for 10 days to check and send emails. I kept seeing whatsapp notifications from the same girl and one day I snapped. I bitterly regret it because it something I've never done and I wish I didn't keep snooping and found out about the proposal. I'm realising though that since I know all of that my behaviour towards him changed a lot and I've been keeping my distances the last couple of weeks. The problem is I'm already deep into it and I don't have the courage to break up I'm done snooping and I will try and forget everything and go back to my normal self.

And how did you deduce that she's interested in dating? Did she just tell you to slow down but that she wants to continue getting to know you?   My plans are to remain friendly, cordial, engage in conversation and be relaxed around her.    That's how you should be with basically everybody.   Anyone else have any additional ideas? or is this going to be a more friends thing? She is an awesome, totally beautiful and graceful woman.   The ""just getting out of a long term relationship"" can be a tough situation. On one hand she's ripe to feel wanted/loved/cared for...on the other, those feelings are there to mask what's really going on. That she left all of those feelings behind and feels shitty. That means what she's feeling now may not even be real, they could be replacement puzzle pieces to keep herself level. When people tell you that you come on strong and that nothing will happen in the immediate future, it means they know what they are feeling isn't fair to you.  She's just not ready."

As for the relationship aspect, it is on both of us. I got out of a long term dead bedroom, and she got out of what I would consider an abusive relationship. We talked and expressed our impressions of strengths on each other (ex caring, independent, shy, gentle, etc) and our personality traits (through astronomy, I know, don't need you to rip me for it). I think she is apprehensive due to her previous relationship. The conversations were more than just the normal first date banter, more of a soul/spiritual searching."

The conversations were more than just the normal first date banter, more of a soul/spiritual searching.   Remember, that doesn't necessarily mean romantic progress. Through my experience, when people simultaneously go through the motions of exorcising a past relationship...things get dicey. Mostly because you're on different levels of progress. When you are still deep in it and you associate a new person with the ex...things don't go very well.   Sometimes the key to these interactions is providing a place where the person doesn't have to think about the pain of the last relationship.  All you can do is take it slow and let her dictate the pace. As long as you're prepared for it."

I don't have a social network, and I also don't see an end to this situation, so I feel like women will just steer clear.   This is no longer a matter of whether you want to date or not. Its a matter of whether you can respect yourself again. You have low self esteem, no job, how is any female going to love/respect you for that?  You need to get your own shit sorted out before you try to develop a meaningful relationship. Who knows if you follow this advice, but in order to be wanted, you have to have your own shit together. Otherwise you'll only attract the crazies or the ones that feast on guys on like you. No respectable woman, most likely, will lay eyes on you.

Try to challenge a girl rather than conforming or trying to be a pleaser. Do something to stand out from the rest of the guys trying to get with her. Also, you must build up some armor that protects you from the sting of rejection. If she says no, rather than whimpering in the corner, you can try and learn from the experience to use your newfound knowledge on the next girl. Also, as far as texting goes, be funny, yet get to the point of setting up a date. Leave her wanting you. So this also means instead of telling her what you like, let her know you're going fishing this weekend and you wanna show her your technique (not word for word). All in all, I really hate that these are the games that you have to play to get girls but they have tons of little petty nice guys lining up to suck up to them."

Personally I like manly men and I know a lot of girls do especially the ones that care about their appearance. Confidence is key as well as practice. Sure you're afraid of rejection now but I say just approach approach approach and soon enough little rejections here and there won't even phase you. As for the conversation just keep it casual, maybe even have a few different funny stories to tell that will be easy to set up. All in all confidence and practice are important. Just don't be creepy or over the top. Be smooth and keep in mind that you're someone they WANT to know and just act accordingly (without being douchey)"

""yeah!"" ""ok, let me save your number, I will remember to invite you if I find interesting bands/shows!""  or by the end of the night, if you guys have a great conversation, just go ahead and ask ""hey, I had a great time tonight!

Oh right, kids these days text each other instead of passing notes. Actually they probably use Snapchat or something, but still.  If you want to date him, uss your words. You can speak them with your voice. If he's not interested, it might be uncomfortable for either or both of you. Life is like that. Sorry. If he's outgoing as you say, maybe he'll ask you out."
dating_advice,3dzbvl,Regrowth220,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, although to clarify, I didn't send my friend to ask. She just did that. I was going to talk to him before that point, now I feel it is more awkward because of the conversation they had and that it sounded like he wasn't especially keen. Although I appreciate it wasn't me he was talking to and that I might get a different answer, he is close to my friend and I feel if he was interested he would have said that to her."

dating_advice,3dz5ej,throwawaycrush789,4,Mon Jul 20 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this has happened to everyone once or twice. But if this is something that is happening to you frequently, I think it could be a symptom of a deeper emotional issue.   I don't know what your dating/relationship history is, but is there any reason you can think of that you might possibly be...afraid, of getting into a real relationship?  Think about it. You say you want a relationship, but if you only find yourself interested in guys who are not interested in you, then you'll never be in a relationship. So you're left alone, but with a built-in excuse that it's not your fault that you're alone. For some reason, NO guy you ever like feels the same way about you. Poor girl.  That's just too much of a coincidence. I think you need to be really honest with yourself about your feelings, and what you're really looking for and what is holding you back."

Yeah, that just confirms my suspicions. Look at you, fantasizing a whole relationship with a guy that you know doesn't want you. Imaging exactly how your conversations would have went. Jesus. And you tried going on dates with other guys, but didn't work, because you were thinking of that guy. Yep, that's self-sabotage. You're not even giving these guys who want you a chance, you'd rather think of the one who doesn't.   There's something going on here, but only you can figure it out. I hope you do, for your sake."

But I think you may be right--I may have some underlying issues. Thinking about it more carefully, I think even guys who I had at one point been interested, once they started to show interest back, I lost interest.   I'm so confused by myself. Why is this? What is this? This is terrible.   My last boyfriend was a few years ago--I really fell apart when we broke up, but I'm totally over him now. I don't think he's the reason why I've been crushing on these guys that I know I'll never have a relationship with. I'm just sad and confused :(   I'm too old for this kind of teenage angst. :/"

dating_advice,3dy4f6,Ichorous007,7,Mon Jul 20 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"I dunno maybe you are over thinking this a bit. Marry someone for their mind more than that body. Just date her and see where it goes. This isn't like raising an animal or having a possession that you can maintain to your liking.   Date her and tell her your concerns one day. ""I really love your figure and wouldn't want you to change but I am concerned about your health if we are going to have a long term relationship."" Something like that.   You can't guarantee anyone's health will be great. Not even your own. Sometimes the healthiest people get hit with cancer for example. It's sad and unfortunate but its a reason to love the person you are with every day.   Overall you should ask a health professional about this but I believe they will give you a ton of reasons why she should try to achieve an average BMI for her health. This is her body and her life overall."

If you have a fetish like this, and you want to be with some with this issue, then you have to take the good with the bad. It shouldn't be any different than someone with other health problems - for example my husband is diabetic. It's likely at some point down the road it's going to cause complications for him. Its a risk I take - and really no one's health is guaranteed.   It IS likely she won't be able to do somethings you might want to do (amusement parks spring to mind). And you'll have to determine if that's the sort of relationship you want to have. IMO, having a fetish and being attracted to someone are 2 different things - it's not really fair to fetishize someone who doesn't want to be so you need to be careful of the WHY you are choosing to date someone of size."

dating_advice,3dzf8w,killallthezombies3,4,Mon Jul 20 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"The only reason I haven't asked yet is because I'm not 100% sure she's into me and also the whole mutual friend thing   This is the mistake so many guys keep making. Waiting for the 100% sure ""sign"" that a woman is interested, because they're so afraid of possibly getting rejected. So they come here asking complete strangers ""does she like me?"" Here's the truth, there is no 100% sure sign. No laughing, no smiling, no playing with her hair, nothing you've read in any books or online articles about flirting. Sometimes it means something, sometimes it doesn't. And our minds can play tricks on us, we see what we want to see. So you can't always rely on that. Sometimes you just have to take the chance.   If she said no it would probably a little awkward.   It will only be as awkward as you allow it to be. If you act totally cool about it and just interact with her normally after that, any initial awkwardness will fade pretty quickly.    Seems like she likes me right?    Yes, it seems like she likes you, but whether or not she likes you enough to want to date you is different story. You're just going to have to ask her that in order to find out.   What should be my next step? Texting her to hang out?   No do you should call her (or wait until you see her again in person) to ask her out on date. Be clear and specific, ""hanging out"" is what friends do, you're not trying to be her friend, so don't act like it. You want to make sure that she knows what your intentions are so that if she says yes, you'll know that the feeling is mutual, or if she says no, you'll know to drop it and move on.  Good luck!"

If you can’t learn to get over something like this, then you are screwed. See, I’m going to blunt, whatever happens with this girl, the odds are that it isn’t going to last forever. I hate to be a downer, but it’s just the facts of modern life, this probably isn’t the girl you’re going to married and have a bunch of kids and grandkids and grow old together with. You’re both young, you’ve got long lives ahead of you, you’ll date and get in relationships with a bunch of other people before you finally settle down.   So if you’re freaking out now over this one ex of a girl you’re dating, it’s just going to get worse later. She’s only 18, so this is some guy she was dating while still a kid. In the grand scheme of things, that’s nothing. Now wait as you get older, and start dating older women, who’ve had a lot more previous experience before you. You’ll meet women who may have lived with or even been married to other guys, who’ve had serious long-term relationships. You cannot allow yourself to always be comparing yourself to someone’s ex, it will drive you crazy."

I totally get that I'm probably not going to marry her or father her children. I feel like I'm not necessarily obsessing about this, it's just something that is in the back of my mind. Her previous man is relevant to the situation because they were dating relatively recently, I feel it's natural to make some sort of comparison.   But for real, I know I have a lot to offer and I won't let any of this get in my way, this is likely going to be a temporary thing and I'm cool with that.

dating_advice,3e1blv,krushkingdom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:21 2015 UTC,"I basically told her I really liked her and she says I'm cool and funny and what not but she wanted to be friends for now even though we went on a date after that. I've had a friend tell me that she likes me as well so is her schedule really that busy or does she just not have interest in me?   Agree with r/krushkingdom but I'll also add that you'll get through life much easier in terms of love/romance if you can judge people mostly on their actions. What I mean is, people can SAY anything whether its that they love you, that you'll go on a date ""someday"" or ""maybe some other time"" or ""You mean so much to me."" But none of these things mean anything unless they SHOW it. So when a girl says, ""you're cool"" thats good, but if she doesn't go on a date with you...then it doesn't really matter what she says right? How many times have you seen girls label guys ""cocky"" or ""douchebags"" only to hook up with them/date them later on? Its ridiculous right? Well that's the thing, the actions tend to reveal the truth.   What you'll learn to do is discern whether girls are giving you some lip service or are genuinely interested. In order to figure this out, there needs to be ACTIONS, not talk.   So here are some non-actions for you to consider:   so I asked her when the next night she would be free was and she replied with a not sure and that she'd get back to me on it.    If YOU were interested in a girl, would you ever just ""get back"" to her or would you propose an alternative date? I know what you'll answer.   We've been talking and texting for like two months and I've hung out with her and her bestfriend   You've hung out, but not really one on one right? Why is the friend always there?   I've had a friend tell me that she likes me as well so is her schedule really that busy or does she just not have interest in me?   Well it depends on whether you trust this person with the opinion...or you're just projecting your ideal situation. Remember, if she likes you, she's going to be proactive in trying to hang out. If she likes you, she wouldn't ask you your intentions and then say she wants to be friends. Right? I mean, just apply logic to these actions and you'll get your answer.    I was planning on bringing her over to my house and finally making a move on this next date because making a move on our previous dates would've been trouble..   So you think this next date wouldn't be trouble? She already said she just wants to be friends. And you think making a move is going to change her mind? If you told a girl that you are not attracted to her and that you want to be friends, and then she told you to come over and kissed you, wouldn't you be like WTF?  Just use some logic, it makes life much simpler."

She also said she wasn't sure about pursuing things because I'm going to be leaving for college soon.  The other friend was always there because we would go on double dates pretty much with my friend because her friend has a thing for him. Our dates have been one on one though.  Sorry I kinda left that out.  The friend that told me she liked me found out because his girlfriend is close friends with her so he was able to talk to her and he asked her if she had a thing with anyone. Before that he didn't even know we were talking really.  The previous dates would've been trouble because her mom was in the next room and had a pretty clear view of us so I didn't really feel comfortable making a move.

Even try and set something up. But do not make the mistake of obsessing over her and forgetting about all of the other potential women that you could pursue. If you really wanted that girl, your best bet was probably to get more out of her before she left, but it doesn't hurt to try as long as it doesn't take up too much of your time.

If she's already ignored a date request, what makes you think she's going to ""come around"" when you send a witty/funny response (which it isn't because she's just ignoring you)?  What you need to do is realize she's not into you and just move on. She gave you your answer with her non-response, understand it and don't go any further, she'll respect you for taking the hint. Now move on."

dating_advice,3e15ei,mbartelsm,2,Tue Jul 21 03:55:51 2015 UTC,"but ways to engage others as someone who simply doesn't know how.   The reason people ask this so much is because there's no concrete answer. Most of the advice revolves around ""meet more girls and it'll be like practice"" or ""put yourself in situations where you can interact with people"" But the problem is always that the person asking the question just resigns to the fact they are ""introverted"" and don't look to put in any work of their own.   This isn't due to a lack of confidence (you could even describe me as arrogant sometimes)   This is how I know you don't understand confidence. Equating arrogance to confidence is exactly what the bros of this day do, thus lowering your value.  The fact you cant connect with anybody outside a tight environment means that you aren't confident enough to engage in conversation with somebody that is new.   The best way to work on this is to constantly hang out and meet with new people. Get those reps in and eventually it'll feel like second nature. There are no easy-bake-oven shortcuts other than genetics."
dating_advice,3e15ei,happypillows,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:41:01 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree with your opinion.  The reason I opened the thread the way I did was because I wanted to avoid this kind of response as I believe that what you believe I am like isn't what I'm like (I don't know how to rephrase that).  I don't lack confidence to meet new people, I have no problem talking with someone I don't know. Perhaps I phrased my question poorly leading you to believe that was the case, though I assure you it is not.  The problem comes after actually engaging in conversation and, you could say, depleting my conversation repertoire for people I know nigh about.  Example:   I'm meeting someone new who was introduced to me by a friend. We will talk about simple things such as what do we do for a living or what kinds of things we enjoy doing. Should the answer of the person be things I'm not familiar with, I shut down, as I have nothing else to continue the conversation with. After which I will often make an excuse or something in order to end the conversation and avoid not having anything to talk about.   It's happened before, and I'm sure it'll keep happening unless I learn how to continue the conversation past that point. You stated that people who label themselves as introverts tend not to put in any work of their own, but the reason I'm asking is because I want to make an effort to improve myself and change my current situation.  I hope that clears any misunderstandings, though if you still stand firm with your opinion I'd like to hear why."

How long does it take for your conversation repertoire to deplete? And why must you need to know so much in advance about the other person in order to continue a conversation? Isn't that the point of talking in the first place? I would argue knowing less would create more conversation.   Should the answer of the person be things I'm not familiar with, I shut down, as I have nothing else to continue the conversation with.   That's why you ask questions. The point is to get them to talk more right? Learning how to ask questions is key to developing rapport, just like its key to being a great interviewer. The better the questions, the more engaged she will be and the more YOU learn about her."

But if you're reasoning for wanting to give the boss a ""heads up"" is because you think dating a coworker could in someway be problematic down the road (which it absolutely can be) then maybe that's a better reason for you to just not do it (which is what I generally recommend)?"

There's reasons justifying both. My mentality is this.. Breakups are always problematic down the road. Yes, seeing an ex for 15 hours every 2 weeks would suck, but it's not like we're around each other that often, and I can handle myself if things go south. And I know they wouldn't fire me over it (especially with sustained professional behavior), they love me and I'm an integral part of the company.

The point of a date is to get to know each other and see if there is sexual chemistry; the group dynamic gets in the way of this.  What you could do is simply consider this a group outing rather than a double date. Then, if you two get along, you can ask her for her number and then go on a proper date."

Especially since the other couple is your friend and his girlfriend. So neither you nor your date should have to worry about feeling like a 4th wheel during the night (which could happen if the other couple were just two of her friends or two of your friends), I think you'll both be a little more comfortable. And hopefully the friends, knowing you both, will be able to jump in if there's any lull in the interaction between you and your date, and keep things moving. You should go for it."

dating_advice,3e07l6,Akhaonmeh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:15 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what I usually say regarding texting. When guys come here asking about how often to text when dating a girl, I always say to keep the random texting to a bare minimum, just text to arrange and confirm dates. Little ""how ya doin'?"" texts throughout the day do more harm than good, in my opinion.   As for during actual dates, well, that's when you should be doing the talking. How exactly to define ""talking too much"" is not easy. It all depends. You don't want to dominate the conversation, talk about yourself, never let her get in a word, etc. But you do want to get to know each other."

I would personally go with option one and go from there. You want something more. You should express that by asking her out. If you want to be friends, what you are doing will be just that. If she's curious on why you moved on if option one didn't work out, voice your desire. It's simple honesty. You respect her time but want something more. You don't want to lose her but respect her decisions either way and you want to pursue other things. It's not a healthy relationship if feelings aren't mutual."

I gave her six, yes SIX chances until we finally had our schedules in order, and now have been on two wonderful dates. What I'm saying is, ask her out and gauge her interest. If she's more comfortable going in groups at first, so be it. You could go out with the group and try to isolate her to make it more intimate and gauge her reactions from there. Good luck!"

I don't see what's so awkward. She was honest with you, so that's it. As for what to do next, do exactly what you told her: back off for some time until you feel like you can be just friends with her, which may never happen. And that's fine. You've already got friends. So you just move on with your life. You met a girl you liked, you went out once, but it’s not working out. That’s the breaks. You’re 21, it’s not the end of the world.    Is her ex just an excuse to blow me off or is there really an emotional problem?   That’s irrelevant. Whatever her reasons, the end result is the same: you need to just forget about dating her, and move on.   I mean why would she go out on a date with me in a first place knowing that she isn't over her ex?    Maybe she thought she was when you asked her out? Or she thought that dating someone else would help her get over him quicker. I’ve actually seen people give that advice to folks who come here asking how to get over someone. People say “Go out and start dating again.” I don’t recommend that, I say don’t rush into anything until you’re ready, but others do.   Do you girls do that?   Yes, some do. And so do some guys."

She was probably looking for just a fling or something. Don't talk to her about getting serious and maybe you'll get lucky. Then, if you're nice to her and keep talking to her she might develop some feelings for you over time. Trust me though, do not talk to her about dating because right now there's only two possibilities. A. She is blowing you off. B. She's attracted to you, but she still has feelings for her ex and she doesn't want to date you, but like's you enough to hang out and possibly even hook up. It sounds like she was at least a little into you..DON'T talk about relationships, getting serious, or anything along those lines and I'm telling you...you'll get lucky if you don't screw it up. Now, if you're not that type of guy and you're looking for something serious...move on, my friend. You seem like a nice dude and I'm sure another lady will be happy to give you a shot."

If this is not want you want, you need to find someone new. As for the question about crying, I don't like it when a girl cries in front of me. I'm not confident on how to react and my personally doesn't reflect well to comfort someone that is crying. I feel emotionally on the inside but don't express it well openly. Therefore, it may look like I don't care but I actually do. I just let the person cry it out and be there, stay kinda quiet."

dating_advice,3dyk9m,Dre4meRv2,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"It's not that I lack emotions, it's just that I'm not experienced enough to express it well. Since I'm a guy, the idea that guys are suppose to act tough kinda sat with me growing up, showing weakness. That's only part of the reason. Since growing up, I never really had chances to express how I feel to anyone. I'm just not good at it. As of late, I'm getting better at expressing my feelings because it's way better than keeping them bottled up, being more expressive. Even this, my ability to express my emotions on the outside still seem more mellow. I rather find a solution than cry about it. I express my sympathy through solutions. What I mean is that I would express my concern and then acknowledged it for what it is and fix it.   For example, I think about it everyday on how to react if I loss someone per-say. How would I feel? How can I feel more emotions? Why don't I cry more? I'm really a shallow person? Honestly, I feel pain but not as much as I want it to be. It's like a subconscious side of me prevents me to feel anymore more than what it is. I acknowledge the fact, mourn and move on. I'm not ashamed of crying at all. I cry but it's rare and sincere if and when I do.   In your situations, I would give you a hug and say that everything would still be ok. Time heals wounds. We can get through this together."

SInce then are text have jsut been less and less frequent. Mainlycuase i have no idea ho to proceed"
dating_advice,3dympm,YouTwitInMyFace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, bad dates happen. It’s just part of the dating game. A lot of guys, especially the shy ones, focus so much on the act of getting date, thinking that they just need to get over their fear of asking a woman out, and then once they do that and she says yes, everything will be fine.  But that’s actually just the easiest part. Not every woman that you go out with is going to turn into a the love of your life or a serious longterm relationship. You can have one good date, or two good dates, and then by the third dates chemistry just wears off of whatever and you realize that it’s just not going to work. So you move on and try again with someone else. You can’t let all your self-esteem get to wrapped up in your success of failure with any one person.  But it also sounds like it’s possible that you’re jumping to conclusions and making assumptions which may not be true. You assumed that she must have lost all interest, and invited you along with the friend, just to be nice. And you say you don’t know if she wants to continue. Well, the only way to find out is to ask her. You say your texts have been less frequent, well you don’t need to be texting inbetween dates at this stage anyway. Random little texts don’t do any good, and that’s why it’s likely to fall off if you’re not doing anything. You should text to arrange and confirm dates. That’s it. Other than that you should saving your conversations for when you’re actually together and can talk in person. That’s how things move forward.   So that’s my advice, ask her out and see if things go better on the next date. And if it doesn’t, or she’s not interested in going out, then so bet it. You can tell her no hard feelings, and be cool about it. And when you see with mutual friends in the future just be like “Hey, what’s up?” like she’s any other friend."

But some things obviously we're wrong. When we first started dating, he lied to me about where he lived, car he drove, and stuff like that. Obviously I found. Long back story short, I applied to a college being led on saying we would move into his home together like 2 hours from where I had lived. Never happened, didn't start college that year, which is something we fight about.  So, in 02/2014 we move across country from CA where our families live to the Midwest after the death of my grandmother whom we had moves in with to care for.. Everything is okay, we work and our finances are all tie d together...   Blah blah  One day we get into an argument about something small, and since he always wants to ignore me when we argue I get frustrated and just pester him wanting him to actually speak to me instead of ignore the situation.. As I pester he turns and point blank says "" how long do you expect me to continue putting up with you?"" I'm stunned. Hurt etc.  3 days of me being visibly depressed and staring at walls, not a word. And this is after telling him 3weeks before hand that I was depressed and feeling kinda like self harming myself and suicidal and he just looks at me and says OK and nothing else. Anyways, he doesn't try to resolve just ignores me still.  And eventually we work it out so we are on speaking terms and everything is fine.

I just wish I knew how to proceed and if there was any option. I can say things are okay until I'm blue in the face, but it doesn't change that it isn't ok."
dating_advice,3dxhnd,SCR0,2,Mon Jul 20 11:15:27 2015 UTC,"doesn't really think of me when he does things.   this jumps out at me as being a tell tale sign of an unhealthy relationship, which you seem to already realize you are in. Proceeding forward, are you in contact with your family? I would let them know what is going on, ask if you can move home, etc. and begin to form a plan for the break up.  The house and the car are none of your concern, your SO is an adult (I hope) and can deal with things on his own. As for finances, if humans built a rocket ship that made it to pluto you can certainly find a way to ""un-gloop"" everything.  Lastly, mental health is not something to be taken lightly. If you are indeed suicidal here is the national suicide hotline number ---> 1 (800) 273-8255.

He won't want to open up to you and have an adult conversation if you're not respecting his space. This isn't to say that he shouldn't respect your emotions and needs, but sometimes arguments cause energies to flair that otherwise wouldn't have. You said you eventually worked it out? How so? Was there an actual conversation? A coming together of minds and emotions? A physical embrace? A recovery/release?   It seems like you're still holding onto this argument.   If you really wanted to leave, money wouldn't be an issue. That's almost always resolvable- your emotions aren't."

Not anything crazy, but you have every right to be there and I honestly was doing this as a way to get out of the apartment and catch up on sports etc. Also, don't hesitate to strike up convo. People have good days and bad days. They may not be receptive to you and just simply ease off. Respect their space. Once I did this, I not only was meeting women but also very interesting folks around town both young and old. Have fun!"

IF you don't workout regularly, start doing so. It will change your mindset completely. If you want to have some enjoyment in dating, you must forge yourself into a new person. The best way to do that is to physically alter your body through exertion. You will physically feel your body changing, and hopefully your mind will change with it. It is a long process, and takes more than a simple text box for me to explain why.   And I'm not talking about just lifting little weight, YOU NEED TO GO FUCKING HARD IN THE PAINT."

There's a pretty good Ethiopian restaurant called Abyssinia on like, 42nd and Spruce or close, it's pretty good food, very cheap, and I would recommend getting the meat and veggie platter as it's delicious and eating Ethiopian is a fun experience that she might dig(eat with your hands). Following that, there's a really cool speakeasy type bar on the second floor of the building called Fiume, cash only but good cocktails and a great beer selection.

dating_advice,3dwhef,owencoleman9,3,Mon Jul 20 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"If she's so easy to talk to then you should talk to her about this. Two dates in a month isn't so bad. And maybe her situation is going to change and she'll have more free time soon. Or maybe not. But it's a legitimate issue to discuss. So next time you do manage to get together (because you should talk about this in person), bring it up (in a non-confrontational way). Just be like, ""Y'know, I do like going out with you, but it seems like your schedule is always so busy."" Something like that. See how she feels about. She may be just as frustrated about this as you are."
dating_advice,3dwhef,iblogalot,2,Mon Jul 20 03:22:43 2015 UTC,It would be one thing she would say 'hey i can't go because I'm  busy' and another thing canceling outright almost everything.  I dated a ballet dancer. She was always upfront with her available time.   Looks like the girl in question is really just dating and not into relationship.
dating_advice,3duj5h,youthrowthatshitaway,14,Sun Jul 19 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"Literally just posted yesterday about something similar. Evidently a lot of girls refuse to text guys first in order to not appear ""too interested"" even if they are. It's really dumb but apparently that's how the world works these days. Just go for it dude, worst she can say is ""no""."
dating_advice,3duj5h,mewtodating,3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Every time I meet a woman interested in me, she texts me every damn day. She texts me at 2 in the morning, stalks my profile, likes every photo I have on facebook, and gives me opportunity after opportunity to set up a date. When a woman is interested in me, I don't have to think about how to proceed. I just proceed.  However, getting to that point where she is that interested, I usually have to set up at least 1 date. I name the date, place and time. They need an opportunity to observe me and rarely do they have enough ambition to set that up for themselves. If she has already observed enough, she will either act how I described, or flake out and make excuses for not being able to go.  Don't try to rationalize her excuses with more excuses. That'd be like buying an old car thinking maybe it will be new sometimes."
dating_advice,3duj5h,SneakyTouchy,3,Sun Jul 19 23:44:43 2015 UTC,Just a random question.  What kind of hobbies do you have that make you interesting enough for them to want that kind of attention from ya?
dating_advice,3duj5h,BelaKunn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"I have a handful that may play more or less into it. Not really sure if it makes a difference. Springboard diving, part time tutor for all the maths and sciences available at my college, recently started getting into coaching as part of an internship leading group exercise, fly model airplanes, ride a motorcycle, and video games (although that's mostly a with family thing). I think daily commitment to the gym and physical activities is probably the big one. Physical presence is a huge part of first impressions, and a good first impression can easily earn some irrational attention."
dating_advice,3duj5h,SneakyTouchy,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:36 2015 UTC,That would make sense but keeping busy and having several activities makes you far more interesting.  The more you do and busier you are the more interesting you become.  That way they know if they aren't around you have things to do.
dating_advice,3duj5h,BelaKunn,5,Mon Jul 20 02:31:59 2015 UTC,"Girls are just as, if not even more worried about embarrassment and fear rejection than guys. It's not the end of the world if she doesn't message you first, besides, sometimes it just turns out you need to pursue the woman more purposefully.  As long as she doesn't hate you, there's a chance."
dating_advice,3duj5h,SuperstarTinsanity,5,Sun Jul 19 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"As a girl, I do this too. Society basically makes me think that the guy is supposed to initiate everything (when you start dating, at least). I'm not shy about texting people first and asking to hang out, but because it's generally assumed that the guy is supposed to make the first move, I always just wait patiently for him to contact me even though I'm basically thinking about him all day. Why? Because if the guy knows he's ""supposed"" to initiate and he doesn't, I assume he's not interested. I'm always afraid that if I text first, he's just responding to be polite or if I ask him out and he says yes, he just agreed to be nice. I know these are the basic issues that guys always face when it comes to dating, but as girls, we're conditioned to think that if you don't initiate things with us, then you're probably not interested at all and we shouldn't bother. Girls also tend to think that if you stop initiating things, that you just lost interest and we shouldn't even bother reaching out to you. So, as the guy, I would say to just ask her out to lunch or something she says no, move on. If she says yes then great! You can get a clearer idea in person of how interested she is and know for sure by her answer if you decide to ask her out on another date."

I figure if two people like each other, they'll initiate conversation without waiting for the other person to.    For example, I asked this girl out last fall and she was a friend of my friend.  My friend said that she was excited and giddy and all that, but I was the only contacting her and after a while, I just assumed she wasn't interested so I stopped messaging/talking to her to see if she would message me first and she never did so I left it alone.    And I don't mind that the guy is supposed to make the first move (though that bugs me too, if you like someone, just say so), but once that's established, communication is a two way street."

dating_advice,3duj5h,shunny14,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"You probably just aren't on her mind like she is with you. She's probably a busy person, and you haven't made yourself interesting enough to her yet to stay on her mind. I mean you guys talked music, although it was for a decent amount of time, she's still not jumping at the chance to see you. Ask yourself, if it was Brad Pitt (or whomever), would she be as slow to respond? Just ask her out, go have a fun time, and see if she keeps up the pattern after that. If so, she's either not interested, seeing various guys (dating around), or just really bad at texting (I've met some people like this)."
dating_advice,3duj5h,WiretapStudios,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"I am a much older woman (43) but I often do this for a different reason than 'game playing' or 'trying not to seem interested'. I'm actually fairly introverted, and as such I tend not to say something to someone (via text or any method) unless I have something of importance to say. I also tend to have slightly low self esteem, so I don't like to 'bother' people unless I need to, but am always thrilled when someone messages me and will always reply promptly when they do.  So there are other explanations, and the only way to really know if she is interested in you is to ask her."

dating_advice,3duj5h,Nakedguyinlockerroom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:24:36 2015 UTC,"First off there's nothing wrong with being the first to start conversation just shows you have initiative. Expecting the girl to take on the responsibility of action is a very feminine mindset that a lot of guys are sadly falling into (not trying to call you a pussy or anything that's just coming from a more feminine polarity to sit tight and wait for results from someone that could ""provide""). You can disagree with societies idea of masculine/feminine roles but it is what it is so let's move on.  Second don't wait around, if you two are having an awesome conversation use that as fuel to ask her out ASAP (1-2 days minimum even that night if you can) giving her more time in between leaves room for friends and family who hold more importance with her to override you.   I go really in depth on this video if you're interested but I think it will help you out a lot."

After meeting her, see how to go from there. Declare what you want, ask her how she feels about it. How things should progress. I'm assuming this is the first time meeting her?

But that doesn't necessarily mean that she likes you. And the only way for you to find out for sure is to ask her out. And that means directly, no ""hinting"" and not about ""hanging out,"" you'll need to ask her on a date.   And I see no need for you to wait. In fact that is more likely to hurt your chances. I mean, first of all, again, we don't know if she has any interest in you as more than a friend anyway. If she doesn't, she's unlikely to change her mind no matter how long you wait, so you'd just be setting yourself for a bigger disappointment if you wait. You know that you're ready to start dating again, so if she's not into you, then you don't want to waste time hanging around waiting for her when you could be out meeting other women that you might actually have a chance with.   On the other hand, if she does have any interest in you, the longer you interact as ""friends,"" the greater the chance that those feelings will fade and be replaced by just feelings of friendship, as she becomes more comfortable with you and then can't see you as anything more than that.  Plus, there's the fact that you already have interest in her, so you're not really ""friends"" right now, because you have an ulterior motive. So you need to just be honest now."
dating_advice,3dweb8,iblogalot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:37:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think she is interested. if she doesn't want to hang with you alone, that's a clear sign of non-interest.  Also, don't fucking wait around for ONE girl. If you do the whole ""I'll be friends and then she'll see that I'm the right guy"" B.S. you will not have any good relationship with her. You speak like she is already yours, "" But then also I don't want to wait and have another guy come along."". She isn't, get that out of your head man.   Also, and this is probably the most important thing that you could take from my comment, just because she talks to you every day does not mean she is romantically interested in you. This might take a bit to wrap your head around. Girls receive so much attention from many different guys, ones they are interested in and ones they are not interested in but want to keep around for platonic reasons.   I'd stop texting/snapchatting her immediately. Go meet other women."

When I look back on my high school boyfriend, I am very grateful for the time we spent together. I would not be the same person without him, but we have become very different people than we once were.  I'm sure this isn't what you want to hear.

It is better to use texting to set up dates and meets rather than having constructive conversation, at least early on. I take about 1-2 hours to reply sometimes base on the conversations were having. It's not because I don't want to reply even though I see it right away. I want to have a good reply to keep the conversations going. A girl I am talking to takes quite a bit to reply. As long as she's replying, it's a good thing. Always keep yourself busy, it's definitely not a good look for you to depend on her reply to go on with your day.

dating_advice,3dwaow,iblogalot,4,Mon Jul 20 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"It can get worse, especially if you're pushing harder where you've already met with resistance. As /u/iblogalot pointed out, you are looking to unburden yourself for your sake, not hers. That's not a good reason. That's about you, not her. Don't. Do not. Keep it to yourself and leave her alone. She isn't interested. Take the hint.   The following nine words comprise a critically important life lesson, so pay attention.   If it's not a ""Fuck, YES!"" it's a ""No.""   People are too polite or shy or nervous to just come out and say ""No."" If they aren't expressing an enthusiastic affirmative, just accept that they're not into it, and don't try to convince them to come to the party/eat the sandwich/donate to your charity/watch the movie/date you. Stop wasting their time (and yours), and move on."

And if you don't want to fall into the so-called ""friendzone"", then don't hang out with as friends. That is in your control.

He flew into a fan. So I work a lot so she took him home with her to give him his meds and I told her to clip his wings. The other day I went to visit her and she took him outside, and for the past week I've been telling her to clip his wings. He got out of her hand and flew away and now I'm furious and really don't want to talk to her. It was a simple task that would take less than 2 minutes. I'm just tired of her not listening to me, don't talk to him, leave him alone. blah blah blah and now we've lost something near and dear to us both. What should I do? I know it's kinda cheesey asking for advice here but come on reddit bless me with some knowledge!"
dating_advice,3dvpdh,lil_draxx,2,Sun Jul 19 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"I asked her if she wants to meet up (I was gunna follow the advice I was given and tell her how I feel about her) but she said she don't wanna do anything after work, cos she'll be tired and that she is busy the weekend, so it seems like she really isn't keen on seeing me again.    Damn, I hate to sound so negative, and perhaps some here will disagree, but I'd say that's definitely a clear message of ""not really interested."" I don't know exactly what she does for work, but I'm 99% that whatever it is, she would not be ""too tired"" afterward is she really wanted to see you.    Like I don't even know what to do now...   You need to just accept that it didn't work out with her and move on.   I really do love this girl-   WHOA Slow down, buddy. According to your own previous post, you've only went one actual ""date"" with this girl, and since then you've ""hung out a few times casually."" You haven't even kissed her. And you already think you're in love with her?!?   That's way too soon. You have to get over this. You're only 18. You met a girl, you liked her, but it didn't work out. That's it. You can move on and try to meet other girls.   Do NOT tell this girl, via text or in person, that you're in love with her. That will not help. If she's lost interest, it won't change anything, and even if she is still interested and was just legitimately busy this weekend, telling her that is more likely to scare her off and make her back away."

I don't know her, or you, obviously, but I don't think the average 17 year old girl would want to date a 14 year old boy, even if she likes you as a friend."
dating_advice,3dvkzt,RvPs_gray_hair,8,Sun Jul 19 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"First, drop the phrase ""friendzoned"" from your vocabulary. It's stupid. Not every girl you like or even go out with is going to want to date or keep dating you. She didn't ""friendzone"" your other male friend, she just doesn't want to date him. And if it turns out that she's not interested in continuing to date you, maybe the ""spark"" just wasn't there, you aren't being ""friendzoned,"" you're just being turned down. It happens (to everybody). And if you don't want to be friends after that, you don't have to be.   Anyway I wouldn't jump to any conclusions just yet. Let's put this in perspective. You two have had one date. It may have been good, but you're not a couple already. You're acting like seeing YOU, specifically, again should be her first priority has soon as she got back, as if she was pining for you the entire time she was away. But, look, she was gone for a week, and now back in town she wants to hang out and catch up with some friends on her first night back. That's not so unusual. But she did include you.  So my advice is that you should have went, with no expectations, and just had a good time. And then ask for a 2nd date afterward."

You're focusing on this as if it's a major thing, but look what else you're revealing in this post. You say your relationship lately isn't healthy, that she becomes ""dissatisfied"" easily and she ""makes you"" say you love her again and again, suggesting some kind of insecurity on her part.

As a female who has used okcupid successfully for both casual and serious connections (currently in a long term relationship with someone I met that way)...I know what you mean about getting so many messages that a potential great match gets lost in the crowd.

dating_advice,3dtbe9,carlover13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:36:03 2015 UTC,Has she started talking back to you? If so does it seem she has gained more interest? Maybe the best thing to do is apologize for the awkward date and ask her again. Tell her that you don't know what got over yourself and this time really impress her. Bring her flowers and go to a semi fancy restaurant. After that go for a walk on a trail (that's open and public so it's not weird) and talk more.
dating_advice,3dtbe9,MitchB32,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:43:25 2015 UTC,"Did you listen to any of what she said to you? She may had mention a favorite band, favorite flower, favorite ice cream, fruit, etc.  My only advice is, if you're quiet, show her at least that you listen. Buy her a CD of her favorite band, or her favorite flower, or anything that might have came up in the conversation about her favorite something. Give it to her and say 'hey I think You said this was your favorite X thing, so I thought you would like it. Anyways here it is, I have to see my dad to eat so I gotta go (or any other lie, just go give it to her and leave). We should text later. Bye'  She's going to be amazed that you remembered something so trivial. Then take it from there."

dating_advice,3dss3b,AnnenWater,2,Sun Jul 19 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to chime in and say I'm down six pounds over three weeks without trying for similar reasons.  I'm basically eating two small meals a day and skipping all my usual snacking.  From a nutritional point of view I am clearly eating better under this emotional stress than I normally do.  It seems kind of perverse that I eat a healthier diet when I'm messed up like this than when I'm happy, but that's how it is working so far.    Sleep deprivation is a killer, though.  It's hard to concentrate at work.    As for whatever app you're on, don't sweat it.  On Tinder I've neglected people for a while and then subsequently gotten together with them.  The guy you're talking about sounds kind of like a douche, though, and he was probably just sounding you out to verify that he could fuck you if he wanted.  Nobody gets that excited about a dating app profile or a voice on the phone, and if they do, what does that even mean?  The only point of getting sexually explicit before you've met someone is to figure out which girls are dtf and to enjoy the fact that they're into you talking that way."
dating_advice,3dss3b,ElMelonTerrible,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:47 2015 UTC,I really had my hopes up and I was too excited but I've been trying hard the past couple days to think of reasons why I might not have liked him. I found out he was lying about his age by 3 years. Either that or the age on the site isn't updating. His torso looks weird. Like way too big which makes his head look small. I'll think of him as Goomba now. That's all I came up with but it's helping lol.
dating_advice,3dss3b,ElMelonTerrible,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"I've been doing Tinder for six eight months now, and I don't get excited over anything online any more.  Either I want to meet someone in person or I don't.  I don't bother with any other judgments until I meet them in person.  (Not to mention there are too many people online who just want to chat a bit and sense how great you think they are so they can get confidence to go meet somebody else.)  The person I'm dating now is a good example.  She didn't have a particularly impressive profile to start with, just a few positive signs that made her seem worth meeting, and when I met her she turned out to look five years older and twenty pounds heavier than her pictures.  But she impressed me more than any other woman I've met since I was 18.  (I'm 38, so that's more than half a lifetime ago.)  Meanwhile I've met women with much more promising profiles who turned out to do nothing for me at all.  They might be hotter, they might have more exciting lifestyles, but if I can't bring myself to give a shit about them in any other way, then what does it matter?  Until you meet someone in person you can't give them credit for being anything more than ""worth meeting."""

It was very depressing. (i don't know how guys can do that all the time) It definitely was not easier to do after the first couple times. It sucked for a while because it seemed like every girl I wanted to talk to, only wanted sex...which is cool, but I was looking for more of a connection (which it seems like You're looking for too). I was lucky enough to meet someone who was on the same page and who I waited a month before having sex with. It felt great not having to rush into it and to have the emotions that SHOULD go along with sex.    I started rambling...so I hope that I actually helped"
dating_advice,3drn8o,mistersmith1008,3,Sat Jul 18 23:45:20 2015 UTC,"Sex is a really powerful thing and it's really difficult to separate it from love. It's pretty easy to catch feelings by hopping into bed with someone. Some people just can't mentally separate banging around for fun from making love. So, if you're finding that this is happening often, casual hookups might be a thing you just shouldn't be doing."

Now as I get older I have 0 interest in one night stands and actually enjoy having a person I can talk to and what not.

That way you know she is interested in you for you not just to help you with your Aspergers.  Id wait till you actually meet in person or after you have been talking for a while online/texting. Give it a few weeks at least.   Dont want to ruin it before it even starts since people may have different ideas about what Aspergers is and that could deter them in the first place. Wait till further on once you are already dating then let her know.   Also what is a ""whatsapp id""?"

My hope is that people will respect it, and return the favour, though it doesn't always work out that way.  I'd rather be alone than have to fake it for anyone."
dating_advice,3drsdd,exgiexpcv,2,Sun Jul 19 02:03:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't make it a point to mention it early on when dating someone (or not necessarily even dating, just any relationship really), and I don't think you need to mention it at all unless it comes up naturally in the conversation somehow.  If it does come up, though, then don't lie about it. When dating someone it's important to portray an honest picture of yourself so that you know whether or not you're really compatible with someone."
dating_advice,3drsdd,Durpulous,2,Sat Jul 18 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"Disclosing your status as a person with Autism is something that you should do at your own discretion. People still associate it with stereotypes such as 'Oh, but he/she doesn't know feelings and emotions' and 'Oh, don't ask him, he's mentally retarded', as any sort of mental illness or peculiarity is frowned upon as different from the norm, which is the 'standard' for many people.  People can understand being gay, but they immediately go 'but can't you get a pill for that?' when you disclose that you've had depression or that you have Asperger's Syndrome, as if it is something that can be cured.   I personally think that people with autism are fully capable of feeling emotions and understanding other people and can have wonderfully stimulating relationships with others, as long as those others keep an open mind.   Still, with your lady friend, I would just reccommend to wait it out for a bit. It might be a shock to her that the charming young man she met has Asperger's Syndrome, but if she felt something, she'll be back. Being interested in psychology makes people more open to other viewpoints, because they can somewhat understand what a person goes through.  Good luck though!"

If anything it was the most logical as if you said ""it's either go out with me or were done talking"" then he would of seen you as bossy and crazy. Respect that he is in school and prioritizing on it then on a girl (no offense but his school is more important then you). He also has a job so it maybe whard to see him. Make time on weekends to hang out but don't bring it up as a date since he doesn't want that yet. Once he's more focused and able to handle more, bring up the subject again. Hopfully he sees you as a understanding person who respects his wishes. Until he says yes keep in contact with him, and it could all end with the one for you! Hope this helps and best of luck :)"

Get some great pics (variety, outdoors, friends, pro-social activities) and a half decent bio that is funny, related to a pic, and you can use in an opener. Also, you can get software to change the location on your phone, and trick Tinder into thinking you're somewhere else; I've found this great for practice.  Other than that, hit the town or join some kind of interest group that will have a demographic you're looking to date. I am at uni, so there are a bunch here, but you should suss out whatever is best for you. Doing sports is pretty good, same with fitness gyms if the vibe is right: physical, some group work, ability to show off etc.  Living with your parents can stifle some options, but it shouldn't prevent you from getting action if your logistics are tight."

The last girl I spoke with I gave up on because I tried to plan a date and she said she was busy all weekend then when I tried for the week she's like, ""I'm going to Vegas"". Didn't even mention an alternative at least. I try and take care of myself (dress nice, go to the gym etc..) and keep myself busy with different hobbies, but I guess I come off boring or something.

dating_advice,3dqaf4,novaksnow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"Dude, the standard is like > 1/20 messages at best, so you're already ahead of the curve. As far as the vegas girl, yeah a girl you haven't even met flaked, it's hard to keep the interest past a week of messaging. Also, these girls get like 50 messages a day, it's not personal if you just fade out. You cannot take online dating personally if you haven't even met yet. And just like dudes, some girls are boring, so realize you are more interesting than them, see it as a confidence boost and move on."

dating_advice,3dqaf4,Eternalmars,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"You don't know what women want?...Welcome to the human race ; ) The exact numbers don't matter the point is that online dating is a lot of work/rejection/not even rejection cuz they never message back. It's fun and new at first but a lot of people including myself get tired of it. Though this is definitely not 100% true, imho and limited experience, online girls are online for a reason, maybe they are a little shy or they could be just plain uninteresting. The day I find I girl who I'm really attracted to and can actually have a conversation with will be the one I marry. It also sort of depends what you are looking for, with the online stuff I always hoped that maybe an actually datable girl would come along, but for me it was mostly just hook ups to fill the time between meeting that person. If that's what you want, after the first casual meeting, invite them for a ""movie"" where you can see if they also just want to hook up to. But for the non-online and what I think is a better way, really just do things you are interested in, shows, museums, volunteering, new restaurants, bookstores, weird hobbies you are into, golfing etc etc. and you will just run into new people. It helps if you do these things with a buddy. if you know you are awesome, women will too. Work on being the best most interesting you you can be, and also make an effort to meet new people. as long as you aren't a creep, the worst that happens is they politely say no thank you and then you won't spend the next two weeks wondering what could have been. Above all, none of it should pain you, shitty dates make for hilarious stories and are just part of dating."
dating_advice,3dqaf4,TProphet69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:26:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I think I may just keep tinder as a back up but from what I've gotten so far most of the girls don't have their own hobbies or have much to say.

Talk to her more and then bring up meeting for coffee or something. If you don't really close to her say I'm in the neibour hood and was wondering if you want to get some coffee. If you live near her say something like I'm not to busy today, want to grab a bite or get a coffee today? When she replies go from there.

Would you like to go for a coffe?' Be direct. Be confident. Never use 'or something'. If she says yes you say that you'll text her the details, if she says no play it cool 'ah, don't worry. I'm gonna have some free time later in the week that's why I'm askin, but no problem ill take my cousin to the baseball game, I'll talk to you later' never sound resentful.

dating_advice,3drn8g,Brooklyn8828,3,Sat Jul 18 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"Generally, outgoing women are better at indicating interest than shy ones. So if she's as outgoing as you say and are befuddled as to whether she likes you or not, I'd say she probably doesn't.  When a girl likes you, they touch you, they notice little things about you like a haircut or new pair of shoes. They lean in when they talk to you, and the quality of their eye contact changes; their eyes get big and their pupils dilate. The tone of their voice changes, they smile when they talk to you.  Some girls do become shy or quiet around guys they like, but that's more difficult to discern."

I have noticed some leaning in and I dont exactly remember little things  Edit:Now I see little things and what you mean. I have given her a thank you and we kinda laughed about it with each other.

dating_advice,3ds11p,RadBradBruh,2,Sun Jul 19 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"The first thing you are doing wrong is doubting yourself.  You are not fat and ugly so start telling yourself that you are a good looking lady and deserve to be happy.  Because you are and you do!  Dating is a numbers game so be patient and start looking for men in other places where you may not feel all the comfortable but still feel safe.    And stop the negative thoughts about allowing a partner to beat you senseless in return for love.  You never have to lower yourself to that level, never!  Start every morning by looking in the mirror and saying over and over again for 5 minutes that you are beautiful and deserve love.  Do that for a few months and you will see that it is true and believe it.  Meanwhile along the way you will find him if you can be patient.  Good Luck."
dating_advice,3ds11p,cupidover40,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"You want it straight? I'll give it to you straight. You need to lose weight. Start working out, find something that you can enjoy doing while exercising. Follow fitness blogs, fitness Instagram accounts. Surround yourself by the fitness culture. Start eating healthy. My personal recommendation would be the keto diet or the paleo diet. These are hard diets, don't expect it to be easy. If you want to eat ice cream, eat it in front of the mirror without your shirt on.   Now, I've told this to my partner and its the hard truth, I would've never asked her out if she was overweight. For women thats the ONLY thing you need to do, to be attractive. If you achieve this one goal, men will be asking you out. I hope this helps."

Why are you asking yourself if you want her back? she didnt mention anything about that, so that's probably not even an option. She just said 'maybe we could talk'. And, notice, she put a MAYBE in there. I'm pretty sure she just wants to know that you're still bad about the breakup to feel better about herself.  Try and set an appointment TO TALK, not to get back together. And go from there. Im almost sure she just wants to see if youre still into her. Never mention how much your heart was broken.  As to the drinking problem, she's an adult, she has to deal with that eventually."

dating_advice,3dqpbc,ineedadvice49,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"Let's look at what I think were some missteps you made and what you could do better next time.   I knew she'd been interested for a little while, she actually asked me out for drinks first, although that date didn't materialize.   She asked you out, which indicates a high attraction level. However, because you waited for her to make the first move, it suggests to me that you were nervous. I'm curious as to the details of why that date never happened.   Anyway, a couple weeks later, we actually did go out, had some good conversation at a bar and hung out for a little after, but nothing happened.   2 weeks after the first scheduled date ""failed to materialize"", would indicate to me the possibility that you dithered.   I think that you should always go for a kiss by the end of the first date. This lets her know that you like her and that you are willing to take the lead. If she backs away or gives the cheek, then at least you know where you stand. She asked you out first, so there should have been no reason not to kiss her.   we made out for a little at my place after we left the bar.   I think this was a missed opportunity for sex. If you're making out at your place, as long as you do the right things, there isn't any reason you two shouldn't have had sex. If I had to guess, you didn't lead the action.  When you're making out, it's your job to escalate and hers to tell you when to slow down. A lot of guys interpret ""slow down"" as ""stop"", and so they give up and the girl gets turned off. It's better to simply pull back on the action and let her acclimate, and then try to escalate again; you have to be patient.  You may not have texted much, but when she starts flaking on you, it's better to back off and wait for her to reach out, and then make a date. The less interested a woman is in you, the less you can text her.  From this point on, I wouldn't contact her in anyway, and wait for her to get in touch. If she does, ask her out and try again, otherwise, forget about her."
dating_advice,3dqpbc,elegant_ejaculation,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"The first time she asked me out was the weekend of her sister's bachelorette party. She said she wanted to get together for drinks if she wasn't too hung over from the party, but she was so she canceled. The next date was actually 5 days later, I just looked back through my phone. Then it was 4 days from the 2nd date where we didn't kiss to the 3rd when we made out. But that was a weeknight and she had to leave. I started to take her shirt off and she wasn't into it so I asked her what she wanted to do, and she just said like ""idk I'm kinda tired and I have to leave soon"" or something. So after a while I walked her to her car and kissed her goodnight. We continued to talk frequently until the last time I asked her out, which is why I don't think it was anything I did other than maybe asking to hang out too many weekends in a row. I can't think of anything else, everything has gone really well. The dates, the conversations, etc. It's just like all of a sudden she doesn't seem interested."
dating_advice,3dqpbc,elegant_ejaculation,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"Women don't lose interest out of nowhere; there has to be something. It's possible that there is another man, but that's beyond your control. However, what you can control is your behavior and it would be good to consider that maybe, just maybe, you aren't Don Juan.  Whatever things you may have done, I'd be willing to bet it was the make out session that was the turning point. When a girl resists something that you're doing, asking her what she wants to do is not the right answer. I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but she will not respond well to your uncertainty. I know that from your perspective, you are being a considerate gentleman, but from her point of view, you are failing to take the lead and make sure the both of you have a good time.  When you asked her what she wanted to do, what she heard was, ""I'm scared, I'm sorry, please don't leave me; I have no idea what I'm what I'm doing"".  You see, when a girl is making out with you, there is no reason it shouldn't lead to sex assuming you know what you're doing. When a girl puts up resistance, it's a test; a test of your patience, sensitivity, and confidence.  The general approach to physical intimacy with a woman is: two steps forward, one step back. When a woman repels an advance, it doesn't mean stop everything and go home; it simply means slow down. It's a way to test your patience and fortitude, but also a way for her to become comfortable; she wants to know you'll slow down when she asks.  So when she resisted taking off her shirt, what you could have done was go back a step and try again a few minutes later. You don't have to act like you did something wrong or like she's not into doing the deed; it just the dance of courtship. When you reacted the way you did, you killed the mood because you don't know how to ""dance""."
dating_advice,3dr58k,menrepeller,6,Sat Jul 18 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, guys perspective here, You did too much and now you need to pull back and let him decide whether he should initiate contact again. That's the short answer.   I know you say you drink responsibly, but from the sounds of it, you got plastered, and his opinion of you clearly took a hit because of it, and that as it is you could've somehow redeemed yourself if it was just that, but it wasn't.   Then you go on to talk about all this emotional and serious stuff? On a third date? I wouldn't even want to hear anything serious until I've been in a relationship with that person for let's call it six months, now everyone's different, but for the sake of what I'm about to say let's call a spade a spade here, and assume he feels the same way, you at the very least probably scared him off. Nobody, but nobody wants to hear the emotional verbal diarrhea of a drunken person on the third date. He was your company for the evening not Dr. Phil, and I apologize in advance if that sounds a bit callous.   And lastly, you get to his house and puke on his floor.  Any and all attraction died when the contents of your stomach stained his carpet. That's the honest truth.   I know he said it was okay and not to worry about it, but he was trying to spare your feelings. Which means, he cares about you, which is great news.   But in the end, it's really in his hands at this point.  If he does initiate contact with you again, you apologize again for your actions that night, don't do it in detail, a simple ""I'm sorry for what happened, it has never happened before and won't again"" will suffice, and both of you can try to work past it."

dating_advice,3dr58k,Zaeden,3,Sat Jul 18 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"OK so here is another mans perspective. I met my girlfriend on new years eve. We were both smashed. Had our first kiss on our first encounter. Talked about life, love, sex, goals, dreams etc... all throughout the night. Pretty serious conversations for a first night. She was very upset the next morning as she thought it was a one time deal. If i had not reached out and contacted her we would never have been together for the 3+ years we have been since then.   Moral of the story is give it a chance ! What do you have to lose ! I mean i could have been rejected by her and what been sad for a few days. But my gamble paid off and instead I've been happy for 3 years and going.   Give it a chance text him and see what happens"

Nothing to be lost by reaching out (though you may be temporarily hurt) and a lot to potentially be gained. It would be good to briefly apologize for getting so emotional + sloppy, explain that you're not usually like that, and say something along the lines of ""I'd like to see you again, if you want to hit me up."" if he doesn't respond that's the definitive end of it and you can move on."

dating_advice,3dr58k,ElMelonTerrible,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a nervous drinker, too, and I have done shit that is similar to this, so you have my sympathy.  I'm going to put an optimistic spin on this and say he's silent because he's waiting for a fuller explanation and apology from you.   I wouldn't have liked me either if I were him lol bc i was being so emotional and talking too much about ""feelings"" yuck lol.    Guys like to talk about that stuff too, as long as they don't feel like the conversation is trapping them under expectations or obligations they haven't agreed to.  When guys go ""yuck"" to emotions it's usually because a girl is piling on expectations of artificial and premature intimacy instead of letting things take their natural course.  That's not what you did.  It's possible you overshared a little bit, but if you've been talking to this guy for two months, he should be ready to hear some of that stuff.  Maybe not all of it in one go, so maybe you overdid it a little, but still.  Your real problem is your nervousness.  It makes you babble, and it makes you seem incapable of taking things seriously.  That's a huge turn-off, especially in a situation like this where you did something that requires a serious explanation.  So, you and I have something else in common besides nervous drinking:  we find it really easy to talk about sensitive emotions if we use humor and irony to detach ourselves from them.  What I've learned the hard way is that nobody gives you credit for that.  Personally, I don't get it.  Why can't I communicate about my emotions the same way Woody Allen does?  But nobody appreciates it.  When you talk about something emotional, people want to hear the emotion, not a funny and incisive comment about the emotion.  Believe me.  I tried really hard on this one.  You could tell someone horrible things about your childhood, and if you told them in an ironic, detached way, they would feel like you weren't being open with them.  So no ""lol""ing or self-deprecating humor when you give this guy your explanation and your humble request for another chance.  No flippant remarks about never drinking again.  (Drinking is awesome and we know you're not going to give it up over one embarrassing evening.)  Speak (or write) slowly, deliberately, and without irony.  Take it 100% seriously.  You'll think that a little bit of humor will show off your spirit or your cleverness to your advantage, but you'll be wrong.  Draft/rehearse your message until all of it is true and no part of it makes you want to laugh.    I'm sorry, but that's what you have to do :-("

I don't believe you came off too strong i mean really all you did was compliment her. It was not done in a creepy way.   Just remember do not refer to her as fine.

Then you can move closer to her and work it out because the both of you need physical contact ... its just the truth man.

My ex just lost her sister to cervical cancer, and she has HPV herself and has had abnormal pap smears.  She didn't think giving it to me was a big deal, though.  I've never had warts, but I almost certainly have HPV now.  Nobody tests for it, so I'm not sure.  I've been through... maybe six STD screenings in the last fifteen years?  I always go for the most comprehensive tests, screw the cost, and not a single time has anyone tested me for HPV or even offered to.  Doctors seem to think it's better if people don't worry about it.    (I have learned that when you go to get tested for STDs, you have to ask carefully to make sure what you're getting tested for.  I had one doctor who didn't test me for herpes when I asked him to give me a full battery before I entered a new relationship.  I noticed it wasn't included when the nurse was giving me my results, and when I asked the doctor why, he said herpes isn't really a problem for people and people shouldn't worry so much about it.  So I got my herpes test elsewhere and never went back to that doctor.)"

That got to the point where I was having sex, but things fizzled out after for varying reasons.   I started to worry about my reputation and in fairness I can't expect to find a girl who hasn't slept around lots if I had been. I don't know if that makes any sense and I'm not saying anything is wrong with high numbers. I just have bad experiences with it.  The number of dates petered out as I focused on getting through a 4 year degree course. About 2 years ago I got plenty of yes and dates. Then somehow it turned to flakes ? Especially recently!   I'm pretty socially active. Spend about 5 or 6 days out with friends doings range of things. Even the girls I have as friends most people I meet think I'm either sleeping with them or have done in the past. Even if I protest.   The biggest thing is right now there's a cool girl I enjoy chatting to. When we first met I asked her friend on a date. She had a boyfriend so I thought nothing of it. I never dated her friend it all went sour. Fast forward and she's split with her boyfriend.   I'm resigned to just being her friend, but like I said she's cool so I invite her out and about. same as the girl I originally asked on a date.   I know I have flaws, jealousy was a major one when I was younger and I've worked on them as much as I can.

Depends on what type of people you are. Somewhere you can talk to each other. So movies and shit are kinda blah. Walking on a boardwalk, or as I said, aquariums/museums. Depends on kind of person you/they are."

dating_advice,3dpie8,Lenovo21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:17:10 2015 UTC,There is a bowling ally close to where I live and I have a pool table in my house. Although I guess asking her on a date to my house is kinda strange.
dating_advice,3dpie8,youresuchadorkvic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"If she's still up for more activities after dinner or bowling... ""I have a pool table back at my place, and by no means am I saying that to push my luck, just saying in case you like pool"""
dating_advice,3dpie8,Lenovo21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"A little, but maybe eventually that would make a good date. Take her to the bowling ally and have fun!"

dating_advice,3dpie8,Zaeden,2,Sat Jul 18 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"If your feeling up for it.   Adventurous   Horseback ride ( they are cheap and beginner trails are easy and plenty of time to talk.) Paint balling ( Its more expensive but loads of fun and you can always go out for a bite to eat after to chat about what a fun exciting day you had, (""OMG you shot me i cant believe your such a good shot"" blah blah)   You can always take her to the movies, Go out to eat, Go for drinks, go bowling.... but any guy would do that. Why not branch out a little. Do something both of you haven't done. Be exciting be adventurous. Have a good time, break a sweat. Just do something memorable and fun. On a date like one of the two above there wont be awkward silences and or boring movies. You both will have something to talk about after, A shared experience and perhaps that can lead to something more. Just my opinion on the matter but i'm not an expert.    Experience : 3 year and counting relationship."

What to do in Manhattan NY with your own pad is a lot different than what to do living in Nome Alaska in your parents basement."
dating_advice,3dpie8,Berettaboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:28:50 2015 UTC,I think going to play pool can be a pretty fun thing to do.
dating_advice,3dpie8,Tisguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:11:22 2015 UTC,"Something where you can talk to her, ice cream and a park it's my go-to first date. If you have a car, an ice cream place that its far away. Talk to her, a lot. Eventually she will be the one talking, when that happens for the love of whatever entity you believe of, listen to her. That will come handy in future dates."

dating_advice,3dp7sg,Yayabc16,2,Sat Jul 18 03:12:06 2015 UTC,"How far does he live from you? You should've addressed the sex asap after the fact, but there's nothing you can do about that now. Find a weekend you're both free, go visit him if you have a means of transportation, make sure you have a backup place to stay if things get super strange, and ask him about that night and what he thought it meant."
dating_advice,3dp7sg,Fresnel_diffraction,2,Sat Jul 18 04:58:53 2015 UTC,Yayabc160m1 We are 10 hours apart until I come back in the fall. So you think he may have been too nervous to bring it up? Or I should have asap just to avoid this situation of me wondering what if?
dating_advice,3dp7sg,Fresnel_diffraction,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:47:03 2015 UTC,"100% both. I would not be surprised if he finds his way on reddit and makes an identical post... ""had sex with my best friend under the influence but the next morning we didn't talk about it and now she's gone for the summer WTF do I do???"" Unless he was so stupid drunk that he forgot the whole thing happened but I don't imagine that was the case. If you can't make it there and you can't wait til fall, give him a phone call."
dating_advice,3dp7sg,rebelde_sin_causa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:42 2015 UTC,You said a couple of times that you were nervous..... well so is he....... a guy who will hang out with you in the bathroom while you puke seems worth going to some trouble for..... so don't be afraid to tell him how you really feel
