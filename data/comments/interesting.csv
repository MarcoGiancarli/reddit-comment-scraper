Microsoft owns Nokia now and there's tons of MS product placement throughout the movie, so it's not a huge surprise the ringtone is in there. Still weird, though."

Having been in the position more times than I can count where the idea of even saving every 5c that came to me would have been impossible I can say that while you might not be rich you definitely could make someone else's life a lot better. I dunno I've done a lot of 'charitable' things in the last few years, not going to pretend there's such a thing as a selfless act, but dude there's not really a greater feeling if you can make someone happy even if for a little while.  If you don't go down that route then I have no idea. Essentially do what makes you happy!"

Its conclusion is that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are in fact linked to creativity.  The Verge took the word ""psychosis"" (which is a state, not a disease) and used it as a replacement for the intended diagnostic terms, resulting in an opposition to its own reference.  Please do not proliferate irresponsible content."

interesting,3cvxc5,Ajax1419,2,Sat Jul 11 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"I think of it more like this:  Knowledge is if you were to see a square, you can call it a square. Then you move around, see three rhombus shaped objects connected at a point, call this a new shape. You have knowledge of seeing a cube head on, and from a point, but you haven't put them together and thought ""these are the same object, this is a cube"".  Understanding is when you can see the cube from any angle and think ""Yep, that's probably a cube"". Even if you've never seen a cube from a particular exact angle, you understanding of the properties of a cube allow you to deduce the nature of the object.  You can understand something without knowing it completely. No one knows anything completely. But you can, with a pretty good degree of confidence, understand it."
