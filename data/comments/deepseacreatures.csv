Colossal squid are a major prey item for sperm whales in the Antarctic; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the colossal squid, which indicates that colossal squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. It is known from only a few specimens, and current estimates put its maximum size at 12–14 m (39–46 ft) long and weighing possibly up to 750 kg (1,650 lb),based on analysis of smaller and immature specimens, making it the largest known invertebrate."

I know this for a fact at surface levels, and, because of thermodynamics, I'm reasonably sure that the same currents operate in the deep ocean. Think about how many jellyfish there are down there that rely on their quarry to float by them and become ensnared."
deepseacreatures,30xt17,tishmaster,17,Tue Mar 31 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"Also, its partially a trick of the camera.

deepseacreatures,30xt17,fivehours,2,Tue Mar 31 18:54:38 2015 UTC,"Could be a few factors. I think wide angle cameras are the norm; they capture more, but give a distorted sense of scale and, if something passes close to it, speed. Given that the lighting only travels so far, that same near-the-lens stuff is going to be exponentially more visible as the camera tries to balance the light levels in the footage.  Other things that might come into play are a limited field of view on the macro footage you sometimes see of plankton (not always relevant), and that the footage of slow-moving guys like echinoderms is often sped up (not always relevant, and you probably knew it already).  Something that almost always affects how you perceive deep sea footage though, whether the sea bed is in frame or not, is a lack of any kind of landmark that would help you gauge perspective. There's a difference between knowing you're viewing wide-angle footage, and it being apparent from the footage. I think this probably exacerbates the effects of lens distortion and lighting."
deepseacreatures,30xt17,Hyoscine,2,Tue Mar 31 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"I have helped operate a large ROV before and they are very hard to maneuver. Especially when you don't have any stable ""landmarks"" to watch when you are manning the controls. The propellers also stir up and push around a ton of debris and plankton that end up going everywhere in front of the camera.  In this particular footage, the giant squid is feeling (or attacking) the ROV because they were mimicking the bioluminesence of a prey item to draw the squid in."

This group of decapods all live in the deep sea near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps . The communities there obtain their energy not from sunlight, due to the depths, but by chemosynthesis which is the conversion of carbon or methane by chemosynthetic bacteria into usable energy."

deepseacreatures,2s3b4f,Nachteule,1 point,Sun Jan 11 21:55:39 2015 UTC,Has anyone seen that River Monsters episode where Jeremy Wade investigates this shark? I thought that there was some kind of traditional Icelandic preparation of this shark's meat featured on that show that involved fermentation. I believe it was acknowledged that this meat was very rare and often come by via an inadvertent catch of the shark in fishing nets targeting other species.

The male doesn't let go and actually fuses with the female.  To the point they share their circulatory system, the male becomes parasitic. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement.

The worm is round in shape, approximately the size of a hazelnut, and bears a strong resemblance to a disembodied pair of buttocks. Because of this, it was given a Latin species name that roughly translates to ""resembling a pig's rear.""  The worm has been recently observed residing just below the oxygen minimum zone between 900 and 1,200 metres (3,000 to 4,000 feet) deep — even when the sea floor is significantly deeper. The worms have also been observed floating with their mouths surrounded by a cloud of mucus. Current theories suggest that they reside in this area of the ocean because of its cornucopia of detritus and marine snow, and that the worms use these mucus clouds to capture particles of food and ""snow.""  The worm has a segmented body, but the middle segments are highly inflated, giving the animal a round shape. These morphological characteristics are unique among chaetopterids. It is unknown whether the specimens found to date were adult or larval forms. Their unusual size (five to ten times larger than any known chaetopterid larvae) might indicate they were adults, but all known species of chaetopterid adults live in parchment-like tubes on the sea floor. Comparison to larval morphology has indicated that the specimens have a close relationship to either genus Chaetopterus or genus Mesochaetopterus, and a phylogenetic tree constructed from mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequences from twelve different Chaetopteridae worms found them to be most closely related to other worms of the Chaetopterus genus.

Currently there are about 38 known species of lampreys.  Although they are well known for boring into the flesh of other fish to suck their blood, in fact only a minority do so;  only 18 species of lampreys are actually parasitic.  The lampreys are a very ancient lineage of vertebrates, though their exact relationship to hagfishes and jawed vertebrates is still a matter of dispute.

Thus, males never mature without parasitizing a female and die if they are unable to find one. At birth, male ceratioids are already equipped with extremely well-developed olfactory organs that detect scents in the water. Males of some species also develop large, highly specialized eyes that may aid in identifying mates in dark environments. The male ceratioid lives solely to find and mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female anglerfish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, the growth of the alimentary canals of some males becomes stunted, preventing them from feeding. Some taxa have jaws that are never suitable or effective for prey capture.  These features necessitate that the male quickly find a female anglerfish to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male to detect the pheromones that signal the proximity of a female anglerfish."

They are bony fish named for their characteristic mode of predation, in which a fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure.  Anglerfish are also notable for extreme sexual dimorphism seen in the suborder Ceratioidei, and sexual parasitism of male anglerfish. In these species, males may be several orders of magnitude smaller than females.   Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are pelagic, while others are benthic; some live in the deep sea (e.g., Ceratiidae) while others on the continental shelf (e.g., the frogfishes Antennariidae and the monkfish/goosefish Lophiidae). Pelagic forms are most laterally compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths.

It was described to science in 2001. Two morphological differences separating it from previously known comb jellies warranted the naming of a new family for this animal.   This mesopelagic jelly ranges in color from deep red, purple, or black to pale purple. The deep color of its belly may mask the animal's bioluminescence to hide it from potential predators.  Its ""combs,"" rows of cilia on its body, have a sparkling iridescence.  Specimens examined have ranged between 1.5 and 16 centimeters in length and 1.2 to 10 centimeters in width.

The convex outer surface is known as the exumbrella while the surface underneath is the subumbrella. A muscular flap of tissue surrounding the margin of the bell, known as the velum, distinguishes hydromedusae from their relatives scyphomedusae.   More on Hydrozoans here at the Wiki page.

deepseacreatures,2inp2c,autowikibot,2,Wed Oct 8 13:24:39 2014 UTC,"Grimpoteuthis:       Grimpoteuthis is a genus of pelagic umbrella octopus that live in the deep sea. Prominent ear-like fins protrude from the mantle just above their lateral eyes. They have a U or V shaped shell in their mantle which gives them a bell shaped appearance. Some species are short, squat and yellow, while others resemble a jellyfish with one, big, brown, walking shoe. Some have suckers, in addition to spines, on all 8 webbed tentacles while others look like a regular octopus with the addition of blue or other colored ""ears"". These octopuses are commonly nicknamed ""Dumbo octopuses"" or ""Dumbo octopods"" in reference to how the ear-like fins protruding from the top of their head-like bodies resemble the ears of Walt Disney's flying elephant Dumbo. At the moment scientists know that there are 37 different types of the Grimpoteuthis   each having a different aspect from all the others. These features could be larger ears or different colours. As these animals live at the bottom of the sea they have a very small food supply. Prey include Crustaceans, bivalves, worms on the ocean floor and Copepods.  These octopi have a short life span. The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years.
