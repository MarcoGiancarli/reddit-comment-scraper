rangers,3e2c4c,detarvatten,5,Tue Jul 21 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Vigneault is big on the zone matching strategy, so i think we will see different combos of forwards and defensemen. I could see the team start overtime with two forwards and a dman, then try and draw a whistle in the offensive zone and go with three forwards but make sure that one of them is Nash for his defensive abilities. Then in the defensive zone go with two defensemen and forward. One thing is for sure, it will be a lot of fun."
rangers,3e2c4c,77Columbus,4,Tue Jul 21 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah Stepan, Nash, DMoore, maybe we'll see Fast, are our forwards that really step up great defensive role."
rangers,3e2c4c,m4tuna,4,Tue Jul 21 13:38:21 2015 UTC,I think it's gonna be more straight offense. Kreids Stepan Nash.
rangers,3e2c4c,TheSensation19,5,Tue Jul 21 13:00:09 2015 UTC,"I truly think it will be Nash, Stepan and McDonagh  Its our PK like without Girardi or Klein. And our PK is pretty darn good at scoring goals with a man down.  McDonagh is probably the most reliable defender in all zones to handle the 3 on 3.   Nash is defensively responsible, a great playmaker and a big body.   Stepan has speed, finishing touch and great chemistry on more ice space with Nash."

So many teams in the Metro have a superstar player (Crosby, Ovy, Malkin, Kessel, Tavares, Giroux) that would need to be shut down, so not having a d man could be costly"
rangers,3e2c4c,RhynoSorceress,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:14 2015 UTC,Nash-Brass-Yandle  Kreids-Steps-Boyle  Zuc-Hayes-Mac  I don't like the idea of going with 3 forwards but I really have no idea what to expect. Be interesting to see how other teams go about their lineups as well. I think you could see most teams take a more conservative approach to it before going crazy with 3 forward groups.
rangers,3e2c4c,irishguy42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:15 2015 UTC,I'm weary on Boyle only due to speed. Girardi a similar way too.

rangers,3e022r,Ekardz,4,Mon Jul 20 22:32:13 2015 UTC,I was helping someone out and took a screen shot of ticket prices from my season ticket package.  Thought others might be interested in the way tickets are priced for the upcoming season.
rangers,3e022r,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:49 2015 UTC,Look at all these things I can't afford.   Well that's I lie. I could afford the cheapest!
rangers,3e022r,imnotthesmartestman,2,Mon Jul 20 22:40:29 2015 UTC,STH individual ticket prices looks the same from last year. Can't complain especially if there are STH's selling near that price.
rangers,3e022r,imnotthesmartestman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"mine went up $5 a seat, but that stuff adds up to an extra $880 this season."
rangers,3e022r,TheMillionthMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"Oh that's brutal. $5 isn't much for one or two games... But when you pay that much more for the package, it could become unaffordable for some and will also drive up secondary market prices. So then both some STH and non-STH can't go to games.   Makes the partial and mini plans that much more attractive."

rangers,3dzrx9,ncolaros,6,Tue Jul 21 08:48:10 2015 UTC,"Just a quick transcription of that section for you.    Are you gonna stay involved at all, with the team or with the league?  I don’t know exactly what I’m gonna do. The one thing for sure is that I’m gonna coach my kids, and we’ll take it from there. I’m, what, three weeks now? So, you know. I’d like to say I’m gonna stay involved in hockey in some capacity or form, and right now, for me, that is coaching my kids. And if that comes into something bigger after that, you know, we’ll see, but I’m not going to jump into anything right now.  Have you ever thought about life after the playing career?  For me, my focus has been my kids after I’m playing. And so, that’s been my thought. I’ve missed out a lot on their games and now to be able to be at every practices, and every game, help them on the ice, during practices, I think that that’s something I’ve looking forward to. My whole family has been so supportive of me and it’s been al about ME a lot, you know? It’s time for it to be about someone else than me, and that’s my kids. And my wife has been pretty happy I’ve been a full time parent alongside, and so... I think things will become a little clearer, what I want to do next, in the next year. I’m just going to take it a month at a time and see how it goes.   tl;dr: ""IDK MAYBE."""

rangers,3dxrcm,zuccit,6,Mon Jul 20 12:12:48 2015 UTC,You'll be able to get tickets for the canes and Avs relatively cheap via stub hub or the Rangers resale on ticketmaster. Isles may run a bit more because it's the Isles but if you roll the dice and get them off stub hub last minute as well you may be alright.
rangers,3dxrcm,Hailtothekingbaby,5,Mon Jul 20 13:05:23 2015 UTC,If the islanders game gets too pricy you could always watch it at a bar around MSG. There are a few that will probably have a great atmosphere with the goal horn and audio of the game.
rangers,3dxrcm,dontbthatguy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"yeah, i'd probably hang out at the flying puck and keep refreshing stubhub..if something comes up, jump on it."
rangers,3dxrcm,fosiacat,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:58 2015 UTC,Rangers individual games havent gone on sale yet so check back at the end of August or early September to try and buy tickets at face value. If that doesnt work out for you the other option is a website called Stubhub that is a secondary market for ticket sales. Stubhub will have deals a couple hours before the game.
rangers,3dxrcm,77Columbus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:06:40 2015 UTC,how much were you looking to spend?
rangers,3dxrcm,Ekardz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:38 2015 UTC,We set our budget on maybe $80 per ticket. Is that too optimistic?
rangers,3dxrcm,fosiacat,2,Mon Jul 20 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"you might be ok at 80/ticket for the canes/avs games, not likely for the islanders tho."
rangers,3dxrcm,Ekardz,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's very optimistic, there is only one ticket at box office price that is cheaper than 80.  There are about 5 season ticket holder prices lower than 80, but that's how much we pay when we buy 44 games.  My personal pair are 83 a piece (at cost for me) and 122 a piece for the general public.  For 80 a ticket, you will be sitting in the 400's with terribly obstructed view, I think its terrible after row 3 or 4 up there.  Here is a screenshot of the chart with this season's prices: http://i.imgur.com/bfMh6bN.jpg"
rangers,3dxrcm,Ekardz,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:03 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for taking your time! This is very helpful. I guess we'll have to reconsider our budget
rangers,3dxrcm,fezzikola,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"i still think you could get seats with a good view for close to 80-90 for the canes and avs game, but the isles will be tough because it's in brooklyn and they are using dynamic pricing, i think the minimum ticket for that game is 160.  i bet a lot of rangers fans will make the trek over to check out the new place."
rangers,3dxrcm,DiceGottfried,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"That arena was not made for hockey and there are some terrible terrible seats, too - without knowing how you're going to see ahead of time, it could be pretty disappointing."
rangers,3dxrcm,Incandenza2015,2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:51 2015 UTC,Check when tickets go on sale and be on your computer (preferably 2 or more of them) and try to get tickets on official ticket outlets when they first go on sale. You shouldn't have a problem getting good tickets at face value if you buy them the day they can come out. Face value tickets don't drop but sometimes there are people that aren't able to go to a game that are willing to sell below face or at the face value of their season tickets. Check stubhub 2 or so hours before the game.  The other possibility is to stand outside msg right before a game. You'd be surprised but I've seen guys in suits get stop a cab and give tickets away or sell them for 20 bucks to fans. This falls under the category of wall Street guys that have season tickets and would rather have a fan see the game then no one at all if they can't make it. It's a rare Long shot but I've done this myself twice (that is been a receiver).  Don't miss the isles game. Devils or isles games in regular season are the most fun.  Ha det bra o lycka till!

rangers,3dxrcm,Nezirsc,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"Everybody's comments have assumed the Islanders game is at MSG, and I'm not sure if you realize either. It is AT Islanders. This greatly benefits you since you'd be paying upwards of $125+ for the worst seat at MSG.  They previously played in the worst venue in all of American sports- Nassau Coliseum. I went to two of them last year at this dump- paid $65 each for some not-so-great seats and $90 for great seats. The Islanders are moving into the Barclays Center in Brooklyn this year. Not sure how this will effect you. On one hand, I imagine there will be some excitement over the arena and it's even easier for a lot of NYR fans to attend. On the other, Islanders fans are arrive-late and leave-early fairweather fans and many will balk at coming into Brooklyn for the Islanders.   I'd guesstimate these seats to go somewhere between $75 and $100 for lower end seats. Might be worth splurging on to see the rivalry and get to see two arenas. These games are also well worth the price of admission. Come damn close to playoff-game atmosphere.   If you aren't familiar with NYC, the Barclays Center is fairly convenient to get to from Manhattan (where MSG is located). It sits atop a train and subway terminal. Would also make for a nice day to see Brooklyn, which has some upside...most of which being the best pizza in the city."

It's like we adopted him from Tampa who wants nothing to do with him.

rangers,3dppra,tj_sad_boi_666,26,Sat Jul 18 06:28:01 2015 UTC,"Statistics are an evaluation tool, not an evaluation verdict.  It's as simple as that.  Don't present them as definitive proof.  This isn't baseball, there are still hundreds of things in a period of a hockey game that never find a stat sheet, but contribute to a win."
rangers,3dppra,DicNavis,3,Sat Jul 18 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of people who use metrics often overvalue them, and the vast majority of those who disparage them undervalue them. That's my humble opinion on the matter after dealing with this ""civil war"" in the hockey community for the last five years or so.  No metric or measurement of performance is valuable or insightful without context. Cheechoo's 56 goal career, without the perspective and understanding that he was being fed scoring chances by Thornton, is a wonderful example of how important context is. Sometimes you don't need metrics to understand perfectly what is going on and sometimes, especially in small sample sizes, metrics can be misleading to the point where they damage our understanding of a player's value or the events in a hockey game. How many times do we see teams lose games where they win the Corsi battle?  As things currently stand, there is no statistic that we can staple onto a player like an overall rating in an NHL game that tells us the hard value of any given player. With that being said, when we begin threading together several measurements of performance we can reach a more enlightened perspective about what a player does while they are on the ice to create scoring chances, drive possession, or suppress shots from opposing players. However, this method of evaluation requires a considerable amount of work and reasoning and is often bungled by those who seek out that one golden number that tells them how to rank NHL players.  They're incredibly useful and incredibly new and radical. There will always be resistance to new ideas and new perspectives on things, especially things that are admittedly imperfect and evolving before our eyes.   ""Don't present them as definite proof"" must go hand-in-hand with not disregarding them as having no value whatsoever."
rangers,3dppra,Paint_ThatNeverDries,0,Sun Jul 19 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"Ok but like it's absurd to me that people are just like ""nope these stats are completely not valid"" when there are stats that make a player they like look bad.    Also yeah of course but puck possession plays a pretty huge part in winning games and championships in the long run. It's not a perfect way of evaluating individuals or teams but it's pretty reliable."
rangers,3dppra,DicNavis,14,Sat Jul 18 16:01:09 2015 UTC,"What do you expect, really?  You've answered your own question.  We are on a subreddit for fans of the  New York Rangers.  If you say someone's favorite player is bad, expect an argument.  People like to draw way too many direct correlation assumptions when it comes to these advanced statistical measurements, though.  We can't just put our ""best"" possession guys all together and expect to have the puck 80% of the time and for shots on goal to always be in favor.  It's a hockey game, and it has to be played on the ice.  Strategies, chemistry, and all kinds of unmeasurables inevitably come into play."
rangers,3dppra,ncolaros,-2,Sat Jul 18 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"But putting out the best possession team, more often than not, improves our chances of winning. Yeah they won't have the puck all the time but no team ever does. Still it's not just a coincidence that top possession teams like LA and Chicago dominate the playoffs every year."
rangers,3dppra,phnxldr,3,Sat Jul 18 17:00:14 2015 UTC,Actually my biggest problem with possession stats is that they're not very predictive. About half the teams in every playoff have substandard possession stats. That's a bad percentage. Teams with high possession stats also miss the playoffs frequently.
rangers,3dppra,ncolaros,4,Sun Jul 19 06:02:00 2015 UTC,They are more predictive than even wins are for predicting postseason success.
rangers,3dppra,ncolaros,3,Sun Jul 19 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"Probably true, but that doesn't make them very predictive. It just means wins are terrible predictors."
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,0,Mon Jul 20 07:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well there's more to overall team performance than just the team corsi. It's true that good possession teams miss the playoffs fairly frequently (especially this year) and likewise bad/mediocre possession teams make the playoffs. Lots of factors play into this like the fact that LA had a terrible playoff record, or like how we had crazy good goaltending all year and a really productive offense.     But as far as playoff success goes good possession teams (more often than not) come out on top. It's not a guarantee of success but icing a team that has good possession ability will probably improve your chances of winning. It's not a guarantee obviously but I'd rather do anything that improves my team's chances of winning the Cup."
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,4,Sun Jul 19 23:01:57 2015 UTC,"For sure, they're decent stats. I just think, especially compared to baseball, hockey's advanced stats are still in their infancy. We'll see better numbers soon, and look back on the day we thought Fenwick and Corsi were end-all-be-all."
rangers,3dppra,heeheemcflora,0,Mon Jul 20 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"But putting out the best possession team, more often than not, improves our chances of winning.   No - the statistic says that winning teams more often than not have possession players.

Maybe you should spend your time dungeon mastering if you just want to look at numbers. Some of us are more interested in what happens during the game (which he just pointed out, a majority of doesn't appear on the score sheet), so I really don't understand why you think your response was even remotely intelligent. It's basically akin to ""but I want to and I don't understand what you are saying so I'm going to ignore it"".   The people who disagree with you aren't saying the stats are invalid. They are saying the stats reflect a portion of the game, and in the scenario you are talking about, not enough to draw the argument you are trying to make. Statistics don't exist in a vacuum, they are very myopic abstractions from an even-more complex system. That's why it takes analysis to understand why a stat is what it is and just looking at the number by itself is essentially deceiving."

rangers,3dppra,Itscominrightforus,12,Tue Jul 21 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"Do you really think Dan Boyle is our best defenceman? And that Girardi doesn't even deserve a roster spot? I trust actual people who work in hockey more than the way random internet people use stats. It isn't even the stats that are the problem, its the way people use them in their holier than thou argument. Hockey analytics were meant to supplement actual strategy, but instead are cited as gospel by people who don't realize they won't determine who wins a tied series with 3 games left."
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,0,Sat Jul 18 19:18:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not our best but definitely one of our better ones this season. And I wouldn't say G doesn't deserve a roster spot but the way his contract is I don't really want him around. If his cap hit was like half of what it is and he was playing on the 3rd or 2nd pairing I'd be happy with him on the team.     And I feel like a lot of people make the point about how they're supplemental but like nobody is saying that they aren't? My issue is that a lot of people on this sub just flat-out refuse to accept stats as a valid metric for performance at all. Possession stats aren't flawless but they're usually a pretty good indicator of playing ability.    And yeah actually the teams with better possession numbers tend to do better in the playoffs. Hence the continued domination of LA and Chicago over the past few years. That's a big part of why we were able to beat Washington this year too. We were crushing them in possession, Holtby just kept them in the series and they got a few lucky bounces."
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"And this is probably why people argue with you when you confront them with the stats.   First you said you wouldn't mind Dan Girardi at half his cap hit. Do you honestly think he's a $2.75 mil player? Do you think the Rangers just pod him more because they felt like it, or was this near his market value? I'm certain the stats you use to severely undervalue Girardi are the same stats the other ""experts"" use.   The people who complain the most about fans not excepting advanced stats are the same people who make everyone not want to listen."
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"Loyalty and emotion affect signings sometimes too. Look at Mike Richards in LA. Dean Lombardi is a great GM but in that situation he allowed emotion to get in the way in signing a guy who was a big part of LA's first cup run, even though he was pretty clearly declining. That contract screwed LA over for a while. I don't doubt that Girardi would have gotten a ton of money if he had hit free agency (considering that Brooks Orpik got even more than he's making now). But using market value for a player isn't always reasonable. Matt Beleskey is getting massively overpaid after hitting free agency."
rangers,3dppra,Itscominrightforus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"LA was the best possession team this year and didn't make the playoffs. I could cite more examples of it not standing true for standings and records. Like the guy above me said, those who quote the statistics on here act as if it has an R squared value of 1, but it's not even close. Acting as if corsi explains why we beat a team in game 7 OT is stupid.  No advanced statistics can truly measure some of the ridiculous boneheaded plays Yandle makes in the defensive zone, or times when Boyle would just not pick up a dude in front. On the corsi sheet is just one shot for. I say this as a fan of Yandle but stuff like that is just so obviously important to hockey but stats will never account for. I trust AV more than people on /r/rangers."

And yeah corsi isn't a comprehensive stat but no stat is entirely comprehensive. It's still a helpful tool though and pretty useful if you can use it in the right context. And yeah like AV watches the team more than any of us so he probably has a pretty good idea of how they play together but he also gives Tanner Glass consistent ice time so maybe take his opinion with a grain of salt. Still a fantastic coach tho, arguably one of the top guys in the league."

The press could do that but they refuse to address the topic of Glass despite the fact that the NY sports media has asked about roster moves in the past. There was, I believe, one instance of him being asked about Glass and his response was that Glass was ""a deterrent."" But in many of the games I've watched the Rangers play with Glass in the lineup his presence did nothing to deter people from starting fights or cheapshotting our players (not that either of those things happened all that often this season). I know he's a good teammate/locker room guy but being a good guy who isn't really great at hockey shouldn't net someone a $1.45 M cap hit."
rangers,3dppra,phnxldr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"Just his opinion that it's ""luck"", doesn't necessarily make it true."
rangers,3dppra,theygotsquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:42 2015 UTC,Fair point. PDO kind of quantifies luck to a certain extent but it's not exactly a great stat for it. That being said his assessment of the Kings' OT record being a product of their playing style is pretty insightful IMO.
rangers,3dppra,theygotsquid,6,Mon Jul 20 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"Fuck stats, Glass for Captain!"
rangers,3dppra,theygotsquid,11,Sat Jul 18 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"Because of the condescending as fuck way most stats arguments are written.  Because the stats aren't actually that great. You'd think corsi was ten times as valuable of a regressor as it actually is by the way people treat it. Like its r-squared value is over 9000 Because people are more willing to defer to award winning coaches than strangers on the internet. Girardi was favored by three separate coaches despite negative corsi. Maybe he's not an abysmal player who barely deserves the sixth spot.  Because you can select whatever stats you want to to make your point. I know because I do this. It's easy. Under use of other important details. For example, Klein takes practically zero penalties. Staal is basically a second Kreider in terms of penalties. This is never mentioned."
rangers,3dppra,DS9NY,11,Sat Jul 18 18:14:04 2015 UTC,Because there is more to a player than just numbers on a board. Player like Girardi and Staal never get mentioned in the elite Dmen because they dont score a stupid amount of points. I can use Tanner Glass as an example last few months of the season and play offs he played his heart out and still takes shit from the fans.   People need to realise that there is more to Hockey than Stats. Its like scouting a player based on his numbers and never seeing him play.

rangers,3dppra,MungTongue,2,Sat Jul 18 10:46:38 2015 UTC,"Girardi and Staal are top-notch dman. They log tough minutes against tough competition and do an excellent job.

rangers,3dppra,MungTongue,0,Sun Jul 19 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head: excellent shot suppression, the ability to drive play away from your own end, usually elite skating ability, good passing, able to win puck battles, good in all 3 zones, generally being smart as far as knowing what kinds of plays to make when."
rangers,3dppra,MungTongue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"Players like girardi and staal dont get mentioned as elite dmen because they allow more scoring chances against per 60 minutes then league average defensemen.

rangers,3dppra,rgby22,-4,Sun Jul 19 21:23:56 2015 UTC,Ok but you can use both an eye test and stats and still make valid analysis. And an eye test doesn't completely invalidate stats. Glass' possession stats were still terrible at the end of the season. Being slightly less noticeably bad doesn't invalidate those stats.    Like in a thread earlier tonight I was arguing why Klein was a worse defenseman than Boyle and he's worse in like a fucking ton of categories. Just because you don't see his flaws in an eye test doesn't mean his poor possession stats are invalid. I could list issues with his game that go along with his poor stats.     It's just wild to me. Like I get that stats aren't the only thing to a player. I really do. But you can't just disregard stats just because a player you like performs poorly in that category.
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,-10,Sat Jul 18 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"Now you're arguing with someone who thinks Staal and Girardi belong in the level of elite defensemen. Girardi is a bottom-2 defenseman in this league if you look at any number of advanced stats but people on this sub love to glorify the guy because ""he's a warrior"". How they're able to look past these stats and the fact that his contract and NMC are crippling the team, I'll never understand."
rangers,3dppra,phnxldr,-4,Sat Jul 18 08:05:43 2015 UTC,I know. But I'm trying to be reasonable and not immediately dismiss their arguments.    I totally agree that neither of them are elite and that Girardi doesn't belong on a top pairing though.
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,-1,Sat Jul 18 08:07:29 2015 UTC,"It's just such a bummer. Looking at McD's advanced stats with vs without Girardi on the ice are some of the more stunning/damning pieces of evidence I've ever seen regarding the ""eye test"" being BS."
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,-2,Sat Jul 18 08:13:02 2015 UTC,If you look at literally anybody's possession stats without Girardi they're better. Look at McD's numbers in the minutes that he was paired with Stralman a few seasons ago. That could have been our top pairing.
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:14:57 2015 UTC,I'll be really sad when someone eventually signs Cody Franson this offseason for 500K less than Girardi is making now and he goes out and scores 40 points while driving positive possession for that team.
rangers,3dppra,mexicaaaan,3,Sat Jul 18 08:24:10 2015 UTC,"Statistics are not ""objective arguments"". Statistics in themselves are objective yes, ie X player won 47.8% of his faceoffs last season. However, the ""story"" being told with said statistics, is far, FAR from objective, ie X player will therefore be our best center next season."
rangers,3dppra,jordansideas,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:49:10 2015 UTC,Well yeah of course. My issue is more that people just ignore the stats because they don't like what the stats say.

There's a girl on my team who doesnt get very many people out by throwing. She comes up with catches sometimes but is by no means an elite catcher. If you looked at her stats, they're probably really low and her +/- is also probably really deep in the minus category. If you went by her stats, you would assume she's not very good. However, she is one of the best girls in the league. She does a ton of things that dont show up on the stats sheets that make her an incredible asset to her team.

rangers,3dppra,5cotland,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pissed at Glass's contract pay, and we scratched Sheppard and played him. Is that his fault? No. Man works his ass off. His talent is not to the degree that will help this team, so we'll voice that. But disrespecting the man to his face, is shameful. You know what Glass is? A ranger. He has my love, my respect, yet I still can view him objectivly."
rangers,3dmozt,JackTheGordie,20,Fri Jul 17 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"i love how everyone is like ""that's why you trade glass and klein!"" like people are fucking ripping down the door to get to tanner glass? trade him to who?"
rangers,3dmozt,fosiacat,6,Fri Jul 17 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"Literally nobody wants Glass, people need to end that pipe dream. Sather fucked up royally giving him a 3 year contract."
rangers,3dmozt,RhynoSorceress,11,Fri Jul 17 16:39:00 2015 UTC,The Flyers traded Zac Rindaldo. Give me a break. Some one would take Glass
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,5,Fri Jul 17 16:56:18 2015 UTC,Yes and as soon as that happened the one team dumb enough to trade for Tanner Glass no longer needed him.
rangers,3dmozt,Blitz93,3,Fri Jul 17 16:58:10 2015 UTC,So that means nothing will change during the season and no one would be willing to take him? Gorton can trade Glass if he wanted to.
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,7,Fri Jul 17 17:00:40 2015 UTC,"do you really think that someone whose job it is to know hockey, doesn’t know as much as a bunch of people on reddit.com, and is actually just sitting on glass because he’s so valuable to the team?  the wildest scenario I can think of is a package where another team that is scraping to the cap floor will take him just as a salary acquisition. but AFAIK, there are no teams that aren’t hitting the floor anymore."
rangers,3dmozt,fosiacat,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:08 2015 UTC,This is what we needed. But it's too late because no teams are reaching to hit the cap minimum anymore
rangers,3dmozt,ncolaros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:16 2015 UTC,Nashville is currently below the cap floor.
rangers,3dmozt,profchaos2001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:03 2015 UTC,How much?
rangers,3dmozt,ncolaros,2,Sat Jul 18 08:41:33 2015 UTC,"-$1,943,277 SALARY FLOOR SPACE  Well they still have to sign Craig Smith and that's gonna cost at least 3 mil, so not really."
rangers,3dmozt,profchaos2001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe package him with a 6th rounder and trade for a 7th rounder.  It's twisted, but getting under the cap is no joke.  There are surely ways to offload him, but it's going to be another case of mortgaging the future to get him off the books, granted that it would probably only be late-round picks"
rangers,3dmozt,BongWaterTaffy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:35 2015 UTC,GMs make mistakes all the time. Assuming that they always know what they're doing with regards to player trades and acquisitions is kind of fallacious.
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:57 2015 UTC,Has Arizona hit the cap floor yet?
rangers,3dmozt,namesisfortombstones,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"There is a silver lining. His cap hit is higher than his salary. Lower income teams that want a filler contract wouldn't mind. Salary is $1 million in season 2 and 3 (these 2 years) seasons because of signing bonuses in year 1 and 2 and an extra $450k in salary in year 1.   $450k in payments isn't huge, but teams that want to save money might like his veteran presence and protection for younger players."
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you package them together then I'm sure you could make that work. Klein's value is high right now due to his offensive numbers this season and I'm sure there are some teams out there that value ""grit"" and ""toughness"" and hate fancy stats enough to take Glass (i.e. Calgary or Boston)."
rangers,3dmozt,Litig8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's funny that you know it's possible for a GM to make a bad choice in giving him his current contract, but you think it's impossible for a GM to make a bad choice in trading for him.   Nothing is impossible. The rangers have unloaded tons of bad contracts in the past."
rangers,3dmozt,fosiacat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"im not saying GMs don't make mistakes.   so you're saying a player will always be as good as he was in say..... 2009, when he was coached by vigneault in vancouver and had a decent year, and his stock will never be on the downturn?   sure it's possible that someone would take him...but i think that typically someone has to see some promise in someone to take a risk on them like we did. we got him coming off another ""decent"" year in pittsburgh (in terms of points for him) and AV has history with him. that in no way means he is on any kind of an upswing, or a steady level of ""decent"" for that matter. he's had a year of being entirely useless, that doesn't exactly inspire GMs to go after someone."

rangers,3dmozt,bkeschhh,3,Fri Jul 17 16:08:41 2015 UTC,With what money? We really don't have much cap space after signing Stepan.
rangers,3dmozt,rangersfan2461,-9,Fri Jul 17 15:12:52 2015 UTC,Trading Glass and/or Klein frees up more than enough cap space.
rangers,3dmozt,MikeyRage,9,Fri Jul 17 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"I fail to see why Klein is even an option to trade. He plays lights out day in and day out. Glass, different story"
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:40 2015 UTC,"He doesnt. Hes not actually very good at anything more then blocking shots, same as Girardi, he just shot at an insanely high %"
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,0,Fri Jul 17 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Why do people have this notion thay Klein is some sort of defensive god?   Edit: I don't want to trade him just to get Semin, i'm just saying"
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,-6,Fri Jul 17 16:59:09 2015 UTC,MUH GAME WINNING GOALS    Also people seem to think the only way to play good defense is shot blocking.
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:08:56 2015 UTC,I also think people are high in the fact that he isn't MDZ
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:16:46 2015 UTC,Which is silly to me because in hindsight MDZ wasn't that bad
rangers,3dmozt,theguerrillafund,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"No he wasn't. Here's what it comes down to for me. I don't want to trade Klein if we don't have to. We can probably keep Stepan without any trading. He's still a serviceable player. But if a trade has to be made, in has to be Klein. He's expendable."
rangers,3dmozt,wmm339,2,Fri Jul 17 17:24:04 2015 UTC,We can and will keep Stepan without making trades. It's what we have the freedom to do after that that is the question.
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:11:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, been saying that forever.  People acted like he was Marek freakin Malik."
rangers,3dmozt,uncivil_wrath,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:36:27 2015 UTC,I think even worse is the fact that there are people who think that the MDZ for Klein trade is on the same level of one-sidedness as McDonagh for Gomez.
rangers,3dmozt,uncivil_wrath,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:46:57 2015 UTC,Because league average 6th Defenseman aren't worth $2.9 Million
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,6,Fri Jul 17 15:37:57 2015 UTC,Boyle is pretty much our 6th defenseman
rangers,3dmozt,MikeyBlunt,-4,Fri Jul 17 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"Boyle is much better than either Klein or Girardi. He's our 4th best defenseman at worst, more likely our 3rd best."
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,4,Fri Jul 17 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? Klein had more points than Boyle, a better +/- rating, and a better shooting percentage, and Klein is supposed to be a defensive defenseman while Boyle is supposed to be offensive."
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Klein was shooting an absurd 11% this season. He was shooting almost 15% from October to December. There's no chance he repeats that. For comparison, Nick Lidstrom's career average shooting percentage was 6.8% (as was Brian Leetch's). If you believe that Klein can sustainably shoot at 1.5 times Lidstrom's (or Leetch's) career shooting percentage you're insane.     Also lol for the 10000000000th time +/- is a terrible stat for individual performance. Boyle's CF%, CFrel%, CF60, and CA60 were all better than Klein by miles. Same goes for Fenwick, scoring chances and high danger scoring chances. Boyle's Hextally chart is also better than Klein's    Dan Boyle is better than Klein by pretty much every metric of possession that you can record.    Edit: How did I know I was going to get downvoted for posting stats? Oh wait this sub is basically stuck in the fucking dark ages. I swear to god if anybody uses any type of logic on this sub they get fucking crucified."
rangers,3dmozt,uncivil_wrath,-4,Fri Jul 17 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"Klein's not shooting anywhere near 11% again, so his point totals are going to decrease. +/- is a terrible stat to judge players on. Boyle outpossessed Klein throughout the season, Boyle is better."
rangers,3dmozt,wmm339,3,Fri Jul 17 18:19:11 2015 UTC,What are you smoking? Have you watched Boyle with the puck last season... It was a disaster sometimes
rangers,3dmozt,Sailor_Chris,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:25 2015 UTC,Higher possession naturally leads to more turnovers.
rangers,3dmozt,uncivil_wrath,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"I've watched him outpossess his competition constantly, something neither Klein or Girardi did last season."
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:49 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Klein can block shots. That's about it. 2.9 is not good for a 6D
rangers,3dmozt,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:02 2015 UTC,Is that a joke he was second among defenseman in points
rangers,3dmozt,TheSensation19,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:52 2015 UTC,Klein's point total this year is kind of like B. Boyle's 22 goals a few years back.  Don't count on that again.
rangers,3dmozt,NYR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"No it isn't a joke. Look at the rest of his career. If you think he's going to do anything like that again, then you're crazy. He's also thirty years old and won't get any better. He's past his prime now. His value is as high as it will ever be. If a trade has to be made, Klein is the best candidate. He's making too much money for a sixth defenseman who can only block shots"
rangers,3dmozt,Grgy,0,Fri Jul 17 18:56:12 2015 UTC,You're saying Klein is past his prime at 30 meanwhile Boyle is 39...
rangers,3dmozt,teddywhite11,0,Sat Jul 18 03:44:07 2015 UTC,Lol Klein can't consistently shoot 11%. Nobody can.
rangers,3dmozt,dynamicSmurf,0,Fri Jul 17 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"If by ""lights out"" you mean poorly then yeah that's true"
rangers,3dmozt,Muriden,9,Fri Jul 17 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"At the very least take a good look into him. Put your 5 best scouts to watch hours of video on the guy. Find out why he failed. Can we take him and make him succeed. Call him, see his mindset. Can we trust his work ethic. Does he want to succeed, is he lazy? or does he need a 2nd chance.   Since he is making the butt load still from the buy out, he might accept less money from us. Since he really blew it these last few years, he might be very cheap.   I can see him being offered 1-2 million and playing on our 3rd line. Our 3rd line is not a checking line."
rangers,3dmozt,BongWaterTaffy,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:20 2015 UTC,No. Totally on the wrong side of the swing of his career. Enough of that.

rangers,3dmozt,DeanYoungblood10,2,Fri Jul 17 15:17:58 2015 UTC,"Who do you trade to make room for this?  If you trade glass, you're either going to take on another contract, or lose value in the draft.  If you trade Klein, you're banking on someone filling in that defenseman spot so we can take a gamble on a guy who seems to have disappeared.  I'm not saying there isn't a potential upside, but some guys in this league fall off super hard - just look at Cheechoo, Heatley, and M. Richards.  I'd rather have the solid top-6 D than take a shot on this, but that's just me."
rangers,3dmozt,uncivil_wrath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"Zac Rinaldo went for a 3rd Round Pick, so if the Rangers wanted to move Glass for a 7th Round Pick, they easily could. If you trade Klein, you pencil in Diaz as the #6 heading into camp, and unless Skjei has a really good camp and vastly outplays him, you have Diaz on the 3rd Pair, and we get stuck with McIlrath as the 7th, but he's probably making the team regardless of whether or not Klein is here."
rangers,3dmozt,ItsMachu,4,Fri Jul 17 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""easily"". The Rinaldo for a 3rd round pick was instantly mocked, and Glass is about at Rinaldo's level as a player (although he isn't a shitbag). I don't see any team willing to throw away any sort of pick to bring Tanner and his lousy contract in, unless they're trying to hit the cap floor or something."
rangers,3dmozt,adamrobertt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:22:08 2015 UTC,This is whats going to happen with Semin. NHL teams are going to offer him something between 1-2 million. The KHL will offer him around 10 million. He will go to the KHL.

rangers,3dmozt,NotFoley,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:43 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this ever since the Canes bought him out.  I think he would be a great addition to our team/system.    I love the low risk high reward signings.  Hell, if we could have signed Richards right after buying him out 1year/2 mil I would do it 10/10 times (kinda kidding, but not).  I said it about Ribero last offseason too!....god that would have been an awesome addition.   These are the diamond in the rough type of signings that will absolutely help us get over that final bump.  unfortunately we are really strapped for cash and thank you Buffalo/Ryan O'Reiley for making resigning Step harder.  Hopefully we can scoop him up!"

You will have a birdseye view which is nice but you may feel a little disconnected from the crowd atmosphere. On the plus side you will have easy access to consessions since there are a bunch of stands on the east and west sides of the bridge level.

You should check out /r/pinkfloyd. Lots of good stuff on there - song discussions, hidden bootleg youtube gems, art, cover band concerts and other things.  If you've never seen Australian Pink Floyd I highly recommend them. They play a lot of the classics but they tend to lean more toward's David's stuff (A Momentary Lapse and Division Bell). Going to see them again 8/16, the first time I saw them in 2011 there were times I couldn't even tell it was a cover band they were so good.

rangers,3dk00z,illkwill,2,Thu Jul 16 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"Perfect, thanks for the quick reply! I'll check stub hub now.   From your experience, are pre-season games still generally played to big/full crowds? There's nothing like that ""packed stadium"" atmosphere..."
rangers,3dk00z,imnotthesmartestman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"You won't get the same atmosphere as a regular season game, it'll most likely be a more casual/laid back experience, but it should be fairly full."
rangers,3dk00z,77Columbus,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"Its worth it, especially the first game since the majority of players will be looking to get back into a game situation after the off season. Also you have to do your homework to get the most out of a pre season game. Make sure you know what players are fighting for a roster spot and who is new on the team so you can focus on them."

rangers,3df3v1,isthatyoujohnwayne_,9,Wed Jul 15 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"Woooooooooow.....amazing job by Gordon. I think we have somewhere around 7.7 7.5 Mill in cap. space now. Plenty of space to get Stepan locked up, but I still want them to play a little hardball."
rangers,3df3v1,MakeItNashty61,7,Wed Jul 15 20:01:38 2015 UTC,Hes going to get 6 years at 6.5-6.875
rangers,3df3v1,MikeyRage,3,Wed Jul 15 20:03:29 2015 UTC,Which is fairly reasonable. The last year or so of that may suck (he's only 25). The question is do they add a potential veteran option somewhere or make a trade with the leftover cap space.
rangers,3df3v1,MakeItNashty61,5,Wed Jul 15 20:09:46 2015 UTC,Plenty of players are still very good at 31.
rangers,3df3v1,ncolaros,7,Wed Jul 15 20:11:00 2015 UTC,Freaking Jagr is going to be great at 97.

rangers,3df3v1,aereuske,2,Thu Jul 16 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Do you guys think this will make next seasons signings more difficult since we're adding JT to the mix? I know we have to resign Kreider next season and Hayes and I assume that those are both going to be high demanding contracts (let's hope the cap goes way up next year? To Canadian dollar?)
rangers,3df3v1,Frank_The_Unicorn,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:57 2015 UTC,"We will have quite a bit coming off the books with Boyle's deal expiring, and a bit more from Yandle and Moore.  We may not be able to keep all of Kreider, Hayes, Miller, and Etem; but three out of the four is still great.  Question: Does Hayes become an RFA or a UFA after his current contract?  Edit: Found it.  He'll be an RFA.  Thank GOD!"
rangers,3df3v1,DicNavis,2,Wed Jul 15 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks. I guess it depends on what happens next season with each of their performances, but it would be a real shame to lose one of them. I'm all on team Yandle--I think having a full season with the team will really help his chemistry and I would hope moves him up to 2nd pair with Staal--but hopefully the Wolfpack delivers some youngsters who can dominate defense for little $$ especially since we have so many big contracts tied up with defense. Or maybe we'll all be so happy next off season celebrating in the glory that is a Stanley Cup victory that we won't care. Please make this happen. Pleeeeasse"
rangers,3df3v1,Frank_The_Unicorn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:24:34 2015 UTC,Hayes being a RFA after next year is hugely helpful.
rangers,3df3v1,ncolaros,9,Wed Jul 15 22:00:16 2015 UTC,Anyone know how much cap we have left? Looking like in the neighborhood of $7mil which should be enough to make Step happy.
rangers,3df3v1,bcgrm,7,Wed Jul 15 19:55:00 2015 UTC,Should be about $7.7 million left of cap space. I read we had 9.5 left before these 2 signings.
rangers,3df3v1,dethside,5,Wed Jul 15 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"We signed McIlwrath too--is that included? He was only 600,000"
rangers,3df3v1,bcgrm,5,Wed Jul 15 19:59:23 2015 UTC,he will be ahl
rangers,3df3v1,TheMillionthMan,5,Wed Jul 15 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"He signed a one-way so only if he clears waivers. I guess that makes sense though since there's no way we keep 8 d-men on roster.  Can we sign Stepan, be over the salary cap with the knowledge that we will waive Wrath before the season starts? Not sure how that works..."
rangers,3df3v1,bcgrm,7,Wed Jul 15 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"We can be at a max of 10% over the cap during the summer, but need to be at/below the cap once the regular season begins."
rangers,3df3v1,irishguy42,5,Wed Jul 15 20:29:35 2015 UTC,^ ^ ^ This guy fucks. Thanks man.
rangers,3df3v1,bcgrm,3,Wed Jul 15 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"Assuming Diaz is our 7th defenseman and our 13th forward makes 600,000, then we have 7,524,500 in cap space."
rangers,3df3v1,hockeycyl,8,Wed Jul 15 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"Did not expect Fast would get more than Miller, but this gives Miller a solid chance to try and increase his payday next offseason."
rangers,3df3v1,DicNavis,3,Wed Jul 15 20:22:30 2015 UTC,Miller is only a 1 year deal so he'll make some more next year if he can be consistent
rangers,3df3v1,MakeItNashty61,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:09 2015 UTC,And we will still hold onto his RFA tag.
rangers,3df3v1,DicNavis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:39 2015 UTC,Fast is better defensively than JT but I assume Miller will get his pay next year
rangers,3df3v1,romano78,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"That's true, but JT showed a lot of the improvement we had been looking for out of him, and I find it strange that he only ended up getting his qualifier, especially after a productive postseason.  If he stays on the same path up, he will surely be paid much more eventually."

rangers,3dfagv,high5sexwhoa,2,Wed Jul 15 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"Or push Stalberg to the 13th spot. He's a really efficient player, and I hope he actually use him."
rangers,3dfagv,MuttenChops,2,Wed Jul 15 22:02:01 2015 UTC,It all depends on who performs and who doesn't throughout camp and the beginning of the regular season...it's almost impossible to speculate now
rangers,3dfagv,Moopband,2,Wed Jul 15 21:52:41 2015 UTC,I think we'll see Lindberg centering the third line. Moore is an ideal 4th line center
rangers,3dfagv,bcgrm,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:15 2015 UTC,Gotta think we're wasting some of Hayes capabilities at the wing. But it seems lindberg is the more natural center of the two.  Lots of talent on this roster.

rangers,3ddrit,wheelzr,5,Wed Jul 15 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"Wow $600k, way more than I'll ever earn in one year but the money and term should answer fans questions as to what Rangers coach's think of his potential."
rangers,3ddrit,JKaye57,2,Wed Jul 15 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"That or the coaching staff and McIlrath's camp realize this is his absolute last chance to crack the opening roster. McIlrath hasn't exactly proven much while in the AHL so his side didn't have much leverage and the Rangers have been more than patient. If McIlrath doesn't make the team as a 5th-7th defensemen, he'll probably be put through waivers and another team will take a chance."
rangers,3ddrit,JKaye57,3,Wed Jul 15 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"With number of dmen we have right now, and no real spot open, have to wonder if he's competing for the 7th dman role UNLESS somebody gets moved."
rangers,3ddrit,JKaye57,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"I'm still really not against Klein being traded. I love Klein and always rooted for him since he was a solid bottom pairing defensemen who could slot up and play on the second pair.  But the fact is when it comes down to it, trading Klein would leave us with: McD-G/Staal-Yandle/Boyle-McIlrath;Diaz;Bodie;Skjei  Yeah, we all have our opinions about Boyle but you know what? Those 6-7 defensemen together still make one of the strongest corps in the league. Klein's contract is definitely a good one at $2.9 for a few more years, but considering we're still tight for cash and have Stepan to worry about this year and fuck knows over the next year or two it just makes sense."
rangers,3ddrit,jm7393,3,Wed Jul 15 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"Klein is the most logical movie because it would be Boyle, but nobody's going to take him off our hands."
rangers,3ddrit,sinister_kid89,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:06 2015 UTC,Exactly. If there's any team that would want a Dan Boyle Gorton better make that move. But I don't see that happening anytime soon.

rangers,3d9tmq,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Tue Jul 14 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"The way that article analysed things confuses me.  As far as I can tell, he limits who he's looking at to only centers making $6M+. Of course if you look only at people making $6M to $9M, he's going to fall somewhere in that range.  It would be more interesting to include other centers, those making $4 or $5 million, especially other RFA's. He might have done that, and determined Stepan is better than them, but if so, he makes no mention of it."
rangers,3d9tmq,averyrule,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:12:03 2015 UTC,That could be interesting but I'm not quite sure where you're going with this. Would it be a way to see whether the Rangers would be able to pay less for him?
rangers,3d9tmq,averyrule,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"I just think he biases his comparison from the beginning, by only comparing Stepan to centers who make a certain amount of money, rather than comparing him to all centers.   At the end of the day, Step is probably going to make between $6 and $7 million a season. This analysis just doesn't do a great job of explaining why, or at least not a very complete job."
rangers,3d9tmq,DeanYoungblood10,-4,Tue Jul 14 22:20:09 2015 UTC,"From a statistical standpoint he's pretty comparable to most centers in that range. And I think almost all of those guys are #1 centers like Step. The only exceptions are guys who are pretty much considered steals from a cap standpoint (Tavares, Seguin, Duchene). Though I'd also consider the three I mentioned to be better than him.     I do see the idea of there being bias but I think if he clarified that he was using that range because Step is comparable that would have helped."

rangers,3d9tmq,DS9NY,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:16:36 2015 UTC,Step has the production of guys in the 7.5mm AAV range and from what the reports have been saying he's willing to take 6mm to keep things amicable. Add on top of that how badly hes been underpaid these last two years on the bridge deal and I think its an insult to offer him 5mm when(from certain sources) hes already willing to take a  1-1.5mm haircut on what his production is worth.

He's already been getting underpaid from his bridge deal for the past 2 years. We need to bite the bullet and sign him up long term for 6-6.5mm for the next 4-5 years. I think thats fair for both parties. But offering him 5 is a little bit of an insult at this point.(Just a sidenote one of the reasons I think hes so important isnt just his stats but his chemistry. He keeps the whole team together, in our second game against the islanders last season when he got injured and taken out it was like the whole team fell apart. He clearly has some tangible AND intangible value to our chemistry.)"
rangers,3db4o5,darknod,4,Tue Jul 14 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"Well of the three Zucc is probably the most universally loved player throughout the league and is likely the most popular of the three jerseys. He would be my personal choice. We also just locked him up for 4 years. Brass we've also got for four more years and is definitely an underrepresented jersey especially after his playoff performance. Finally Kreider has alot of promise for the future and may earn you some salty comments from opposing fans. His biggest drawback is we only have him locked up for one more year, but he'll be an RFA so we should re-sign him. So yeah you can't really go wrong with any, but I will always lean towards Zucc."

I've heard from other people that sometimes they buy tickets when the game is about to start (or has already started for a few minutes), which results in really cheap tickets because at that point the sellers are just trying to get rid of them. You'd lose half of the first period, but the tickets would be a lot cheaper.  Is this actually a feasible thing to do or were they talking out of their asses?

rangers,3d95dx,TheChiefiest,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"My family has season tickets and the Rangers make you buy the preseason games.  I have gone to a few over the years.  The game environment is the same as during the regular season -- same intros, music, MSG concessions, etc.  But the game itself and the crowd are nowhere near the intensity of a regular season game.  On the other hand, it can be entertaining to watch some of the prospects hustling to make a good impression.  Against the Flyers I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of fights between the goon prospects.  Are the tickets worth it?  At face value, no.  If you can get some cheap seats, go for it."

I sell the full season usually to a guy for 8600.  he has moved this year no longer buying em.  I make about 14 per seat per game over the 44 games.  When I sell em individually I usually make $13k but it's a hassle.  I have two seats of my own that I keep and only sell the ones I cannot make.  The ticket master price for the same seats purchased at the box office would be 122 per seat or 10736 the pair for 44 games if purchased for true face value.

The fact that the Rangers were top 3 in scoring, and their penalty kill was also very good, it leads me to think that the defense chipped in offensively (taking greater defensive risks) when it thought it had a good chance of scoring (at least that's what my amateur observations showed).  Worst case scenario, they turnover the puck and the other team still has to face a great goalie. It could be the defense is a lot better than what the article shows. it could very well be that both Talbot AND the Rangers D is elite.  Make sense?"
rangers,3d6722,yuneeq,3,Mon Jul 13 23:22:23 2015 UTC,This could be argued if the Rangers D contributed more offence in terms of % of goals contributed to but I don't think they do.

Klein and Staal don't contribute that much to the offense either (at least in 5v5). The only guys generating sustainable offense in terms of shot based metrics (like corsi, fenwick and scoring chances) are Yandle, Boyle and Hunwick (who isn't even on the team anymore). On the other hand, a lot of the guys who gave up the most scoring chances or shot attempts were our ""defensive"" guys like Girardi, Klein and Staal. Mac was kind of middle-of-the-pack in terms of scoring chances for and Yandle in the playoffs did allow a decent number of chances but for the most part it seems like our ""offensive"" guys aren't the problem in terms of the defense allowing a lot of chances.

For one injuries and the trade deadline don't let stats show the whole picture between mactruck, yandle, and Klein. The last Stat showing chances/Fenwick proves that this team doesn't give up good opportunities. There were some other things worth pointing out but I don't have time. Plus it's an oilers blog so it's likely skewed to promote his point for talbot. Great goalie, but not at the expense of this defense. I've seen a lot of praise for this blog from rangers fans, especially from blue seat blogs where they commended the defense all year outside of Girardi... now turn their back when it's convenient."
rangers,3d6722,greatway4stayinshape,2,Mon Jul 13 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"No, the last point was that the ratio of scoring chances to blocked shots was good. The overall number of scoring chances is still very average."

rangers,3d6722,rgby22,2,Tue Jul 14 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly? No.   Why? Injuries and a lack of people living up to their potential.   Mac and Staal had off years. Bothing being injured in the playoffs didn't help the situation.   Girardi showed flashes, but at times went back to the old him, which was frustrating.   Klein did well early on then kinda tapered off.   Hunwick was a solid 7th D man who is better off on another team where he can get some good consistent minutes.   Yandle and Boyle are odd. Boyle is old, and honestly he cost the Rangers a lot defensively. But, he still scored in the playoffs. Yandle took a month or two to get his stride going. Once he did, he was the best D man on the ice, but looking at his competition, it wasn't great. Being the best D man in a corp filled with injuries isn't something to write home about.   Rangers are in an interesting situation. Boyle will be gone at the end of the season. Klein or Yandle will have to follow. We can bring up McIlrath and Skjei, but thats not a great upgrade in some terms. Diaz adds some good bottom 6 depth, and a nice willingness to shoot."

My question is, do stats and our interpretation of them tell the whole story? Can they be the definitive  answer that closes the book on a debate? Smarter people then me might say 'yes', but when I look at the article - and I see some of the teams leading the stat categories listed, there's always one or two up in the top group that either didn't make the playoffs or were quickly bounced in the first round. How does a Rangers team that trails teams like these in a handful of categories manage to win the president's trophy?

Of course if you have a stocked prospect pool you can let guys go at the end of their bridge deals because you have guys like Kreider and Miller and Fast coming up to fill the gaps.  Kinda like what happened with hags and cally. Is the organizational depth still there given the lack of 1st round picks in recent/upcoming years?  I honestly don't know either way."
rangers,3d4hss,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:41:31 2015 UTC,"By that thinking, we would have given Hagelin a deal worth close to $3.5M instead of the bridge deal (which was $2.25M), we wouldn't have been able to get anything of value for him.  You have to make decisions on guys that you identify as core players (whicone of these and award h Haggy was to a degree), and who have the best shot of becoming stars.  If you screw up a big contract to a young player, you are not only paying more than you need to against the cap for the first 2 years but run the risk of a player not developing as you expected.  I like that they extended McD but I get why they didn't extend Step.  His numbers when he was up for a deal weren't a sure thing #1 center."
rangers,3d4hss,wmm339,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:03 2015 UTC,Does Hags get 4.5+ next contract?
rangers,3d4hss,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:12:40 2015 UTC,?  He got $4.5 over 2 years on his last deal.  His play regressed a bit so I think he will get $3.5-4M - but you never know.  I didn't think Pouliot would get 5/$20.
rangers,3d4hss,DeanYoungblood10,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:29 2015 UTC,Gorton has been pretty much handling these deals for the last couple of years. Expect it to continue.
rangers,3d4hss,PeteSamp27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"You give Miller, Fast and Etem 1 or 2 year deals for as cheap as possible, but Stepan needs to be locked up longterm and so does Kreider and Hayes (if possible next year)"
rangers,3d311n,NYRule1994,18,Mon Jul 13 03:05:10 2015 UTC,it will probably come down to the very last minute and be decided by a small amount.  like a post season game.   im used to this by now
rangers,3d311n,patton66,7,Mon Jul 13 04:05:47 2015 UTC,So we're going to win 2-1? Seems appropriate considering Stepan's jersey number.
rangers,3d311n,WrittenSarcasm,9,Mon Jul 13 19:59:26 2015 UTC,I feel like trading Stepan would be a huge mistake unless somehow we're getting someone like Tyler Seguin or something. Which seems unlikely.
rangers,3d311n,adamrobertt,7,Mon Jul 13 04:24:12 2015 UTC,Oh it'd be huge mistake. The guy's 25 and is destined for big things with us.
rangers,3d311n,NPHMctweeds,2,Mon Jul 13 04:33:10 2015 UTC,He is certainly destined for big things. We just need to hope it's with us.
rangers,3d311n,Ralph_Baconader,4,Mon Jul 13 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, plus it would take a lottt more than Stepan to get Seguin"
rangers,3d311n,arunnair87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:34:47 2015 UTC,"We can't trade him. I think if he goes all the way through arbitration we have to wait a year before trading him (if he elects for 2 years.) Not 100 percent sure about this.  If we deny the arbitrator's ruling, Stepan becomes a free agent."
rangers,3d311n,Blitz93,4,Mon Jul 13 16:26:58 2015 UTC,Every single year we hear reports about issues with how the Rangers' RFA negotiations are going and every year they get done. These articles are just panic pieces so people have something to talk about.
rangers,3d311n,wheelzr,3,Mon Jul 13 06:17:51 2015 UTC,"My bet is that Slats and Gorton are flexing on Step s agent,  who has shown in the past to be difficult to work with. It's also worth noting that Stepan's agent is not a big time guy, Stepan is good biggest client."
rangers,3d311n,EarnSquirm,3,Mon Jul 13 07:59:10 2015 UTC,"Arbitration is 14 days away, meaning a deal of any kind is likely 14 days away. Remember; when Dubinsky, Callahan, Zuccarello & Brassard were in this similar spot in summers past... negotiations went down to very shortly before arb hearing."
rangers,3d311n,irishguy42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:09:37 2015 UTC,"Kreider too, IIRC"
rangers,3d311n,PeteSamp27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:08:16 2015 UTC,"Still plenty of time to negotiate prior to arbitration, so wouldn't read into too much. Also the Rangers can't trade Stepan until after arbitration at this point, so he is safe for now. Finally, don't think they will sign any of the other RFAs until they know how much Stepan is getting as he is their priority"
rangers,3d311n,Legs_Feed_The_Wolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:20:44 2015 UTC,So is there a reason why they haven't even started negotiations at this point? I'm somewhat baffled now.
rangers,3d311n,Legs_Feed_The_Wolf,2,Mon Jul 13 03:38:04 2015 UTC,"There's two potential scenarios that come to my mind as to why they haven't. One would be that their trying to sign the other free agents first, which could very well be a possibility. The other could be that unfortunately a trade is in the works. Now whether that includes Stepan or not no one knows."

rangers,3d0lnu,hypnofed,2,Mon Jul 13 00:00:27 2015 UTC,thats cool and appreciated - in terms of having a master list it offers very little but a playlist. I was thinking something more along the lines of the following:  The Mask * Episode 1 - Mario Batali * Episode 2 - John Mcenroe * Episode 3 - Tiesto * Episode 4 - Michael J Fox * Episode 5 - Jeff Gordon * Episode 6 - FDNY * Episode 7 - The best of the mask   MSG Beginnings * Mats Zuccarello * Henrik Lundqivst * Carl Hagelin * Derek Dorsett * Derick Brassard * Ryan Callahan * Brad Richards 24/7 Road to the NHL Winter Classic * s02e01 - Flyers Rangers: Part 1 * s02e02 - Flyers Rangers: Part 2 * s02e03 - Flyers Rangers: Part 3 * s02e04 - Flyers Rangers: Part 4 The Boys in Blueshirts * etc... * etc.... * etc....
rangers,3d0lnu,keetner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"I like this idea a lot. One of the big reasons why I came to like the team so much was from some of the things you mentioned (eg.

rangers,3d0ld1,Swaggy_pnut,17,Sun Jul 12 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"RFAs who are looking for a payday tend to sign on later in the offseason. Galchenyuk, Huberdeau, Adam Larsson, Brock Nelson,  and Mike Hoffman all have yet to sign, among others."
rangers,3d0ld1,James_Caan,6,Sun Jul 12 14:54:57 2015 UTC,Stepan needs to be signed and given what he deserves. End of story.
rangers,3d0ld1,AoifeCheeks,2,Sun Jul 12 16:20:37 2015 UTC,Step shouldn't get more than 6m a year from us. We wouldn't be able to sign anyone else. If he demands more trade him.
rangers,3d0ld1,sofakingmad,5,Mon Jul 13 01:57:10 2015 UTC,"As I said, he should be signed and given what he deserves. For me that contract would be anywhere in the 5/6 year span with something ranging from 5.5 to 6 even."
rangers,3d0ld1,AoifeCheeks,2,Mon Jul 13 03:28:33 2015 UTC,ok good.  the way i read your response it seemed like you wanted him to get what he THOUGHT he deserved.  apologies.
rangers,3d0ld1,sofakingmad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:33:30 2015 UTC,"he isn't going to sign for that little long term. He will get $7m/yr or more once he becomes a UFA in two years and likely will get $6m or more in arbitration this year and next if he goes that route.  With what the market is now and what it is becoming, anything under $7m/yr longterm is a good deal for the Rangers (and pretty close to market for Stepan)"
rangers,3d0ld1,PeteSamp27,7,Tue Jul 14 13:24:21 2015 UTC,I am very worried too. I think the fact that there is almost no information about discussions being released is making it more tense.  The worst part was 2 years ago Stepan demanded 6x4.7 and Sather played hard ball and wanted a bridge deal. The bridge deal really didn't work out (it pretty much allowed us to sign Tanner Glass) so now they are in a huge bind. I just want them to get this over with.
rangers,3d0ld1,mcsyankees,6,Sun Jul 12 14:48:23 2015 UTC,There's not going to be any info yet. Arbitration hearings don't start until July 20. Don't worry!
rangers,3d0ld1,Milkwrapper,3,Sun Jul 12 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"We really had no choice but to sign Stepan to that bridge deal. Not sure if you remember, but Stepan was the last RFA we had to sign and we only had like $3.5M in cap space. I think Zucc took a ridiculous paycut too and we still barely had enough money to sign Stepan to his bridge deal."
rangers,3d0ld1,ducofnewyork,0,Sun Jul 12 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"Or Dominic Moore, who has a similar cap hit and tenure. We need to stop throwing Tanner Glass under the bus for the cap situation. He's only 2% of our cap. 2%! That's it.   Sure everyone wants him to be 0% but he's signed for 2 more years."
rangers,3d0ld1,jedimasterchief,14,Sun Jul 12 15:27:53 2015 UTC,Are you seriously comparing one of our best defensive forwards and our best faceoff guy to tanner freaking glass? Tanner glass who only had three points the entire season? Tanner who was supposed to be an enforcer and protect the skill guys but was out toughed by a 5'5 hobbit from Norway? Get lawst
rangers,3d0ld1,GiveMeTheTickleStick,11,Sun Jul 12 16:44:25 2015 UTC,Except for that Moore is a great player and has a tangible impact on our team game.  Glass does not.
rangers,3d0ld1,adamrobertt,6,Sun Jul 12 16:41:36 2015 UTC,Moore is our only hope at faceoffs at certain times.
rangers,3d0ld1,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,2,Sun Jul 12 18:01:10 2015 UTC,yeah except glass adds literally nothing and is way overpaid. Clearly not having him signed to a stupid as contract is hurting us now.
rangers,3d0ld1,gimbz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"Dominic Moore is a steal.  We are lucky we have such a dedicated, hard playing 4th liner.  He grinds, he wins face offs, he adds on the ice leadership.  Tanner Glass is not Dom Moore in any way what so ever, and it makes zero sense to compare their contracts."
rangers,3d0ld1,IzBox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:44:49 2015 UTC,Moore even had 27 points! That's pretty good for a 4th line defensive player who gets no PP time.
rangers,3d0ld1,phnxldr,3,Tue Jul 14 14:15:38 2015 UTC,This deal needs to be long term. There are so few players on this team I wouldn't give up to retain Stepan in a heartbeat.  PLS SIGN HIM
rangers,3d0ld1,k_nasty,3,Sun Jul 12 15:08:32 2015 UTC,They'll get it done.
rangers,3d0ld1,adamrobertt,6,Sun Jul 12 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yup. Still more than a week to make an offer. There's a reason we didn't re-sign Hags. All of the articles are click bait and speculation. It's Ranger fan instinct to panic and expect the worst, so none of this surprises me. He will be re-signed."
rangers,3d0ld1,high5sexwhoa,4,Sun Jul 12 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"Next year may be even worse. Dont Kreider, Hayes, and Miller all hit UFA status?"
rangers,3d0ld1,DevilDriving,3,Sun Jul 12 15:53:48 2015 UTC,"No, I think they should all hit RFA since they're all on their entry level contracts right now. I might be wrong though.

rangers,3d0ld1,irishguy42,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"Kreider has arbitration rights next year (Hayes does not) and the Saad contract isn't going to help things in arbitration or getting him locked up longterm.

rangers,3cp7oj,adamrobertt,18,Thu Jul 9 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"To me, this just shows that all the internet speculators focus too much on the salary cap and ""player stock value"" and ignore almost everything else.  It isn't the only thing that matters.  Also, focusing on trading Klein because he isn't a natural goal scorer and isn't going to score lots of goals next season is perplexing to me."
rangers,3cp7oj,tj_sad_boi_666,11,Thu Jul 9 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"Lol nobody's saying that we should trade him because he isn't a natural scorer. People bring up his unreasonably high shooting percentage from this season to show that Klein is pretty unlikely to repeat his points total next year. Therefore it makes sense for them to trade him now due to the combination of the cap crunch and his high value, rather than potentially later (when we could be in a worse cap crunch and his value will have decreased)."
rangers,3cp7oj,serfis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you for the most part. The part I don't necessarily agree with is the high value. GMs and their teams aren't stupid, they can see high, unsustainable shooting percentage as easily (or realistically, more easily) as the rest of us. I don't think his value is really that high."

rangers,3cp7oj,Paint_ThatNeverDries,5,Fri Jul 10 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"The main reason to trade Klein is because the Rangers are up against the cap, need to sign Stepan (and others) and Klein just so happens to have a contract without any clauses attached to it while taking up a significant cap hit. He's also desirable (which Tanner Glass is not).  If pieces need to move to fit Stepan, Klein should be at the top of the realistic list."
rangers,3cp7oj,Paint_ThatNeverDries,6,Thu Jul 9 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"I think that a move like that is more of a last resort, and it seems like people have been talking about it as a first option sort of thing.

rangers,3cp7oj,Paint_ThatNeverDries,3,Thu Jul 9 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"Hopefully we can get Stepan on a deal that means we don't have to move Klein (or anyone else). That would be the best case scenario.  However, I try to think ahead a bit on things like this and think about what the Rangers could get for Klein now as opposed to what they might get for him a year from now. Guessing the climate of the roster a year or two down the road is an impossible game, but it often feels prudent to move a guy when his stock is at its highest and when the team has some serious cap constraints this season and will have to sign Kreids next season (and find some replacements for departing UFAs)."
rangers,3cp7oj,serfis,4,Thu Jul 9 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"Adam Rotter makes a pretty good point about Klein in the article that I posted, though.  Moving him would just open another hole and create another problem we have to deal with.  I know we have prospects, but what if they aren't ready?  McIllrath is a bust IMO, and Skjei plays the left side I think, even if he is ready."
rangers,3cp7oj,nhlroyalty,10,Thu Jul 9 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"The side a defenseman plays is almost irrelevant. It's an issue of comfort when it comes to moving the puck and getting it out of the zone, but it is not a reason to overpay or retain a player. The Rangers currently have four righties on their back line, subtracting Klein and adding Skjei means more ""balance"". Handedness doesn't seem to make much of an impact outside of special teams.  Diaz as the 6th is perfectly fine, he's also RH, for what it's worth.  Several respected scouts and analysts believe Skjei is ready or close to ready. We are on the same page about Dylan McIlrath, but him being a ""bust"" doesn't mean he can't play on the third pair for a pittance of a cap hit if need be or serve as the 7th d-man.  Rotter's comment suggests that the Rangers fix one problem and in so doing will create another. However, the solution to retaining Stepan is leagues more important than the future of Klein and who the Rangers' 5th/6th defenseman will be."
rangers,3cp7oj,puckinright,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"I thought McIlrath was a bust too, but recent reports are saying he's improving and could end up being a decent bottom 4 defenseman. That's still a bust for his draft position, but it's better than him being a useless AHL plug like it appeared he'd be."
rangers,3cp7oj,nhlroyalty,-5,Fri Jul 10 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if the move simply ""allows"" the Rangers to OVERPAY Stepan, then it's a bunk move. You're robbing Peter to pay Paul at that point, because Klein in a GOOD value at $2.9 for the next few years, while Stepan $7M+ for the next 5-6 years is NOT good value."
rangers,3cp7oj,puckinright,4,Thu Jul 9 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"Good lord. You do realize Stepan is a first line center in this league, right?"
rangers,3cp7oj,puckinright,-2,Fri Jul 10 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"He's a debatable first line center, just like Brassard. They are interchanchable 1A/1B on this team. We've seen this team fall apart without Stepan, but in this league he's barely a $6M player and he's looking for $7.5... Derek Stepan is not a $7M+ hockey player, if you can't sign him for under that, I say it hurts but you gotta trade him."
rangers,3cp7oj,gimbz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"Also why do we always concentrate on the playoff performance, especially when we're talking about someone who broke his arm? He had a great year for us otherwise."

Klein adds some security to the 2nd pairing. He's no Stralman, but he's still a part of this D."

rangers,3coo0t,keetner,3,Thu Jul 9 16:51:10 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind me mentioning a few things!   I would agree that the article was a bit confusing to read. I do appreciate it when writers throw in a bit of humour/personality so it's not like you're just regurgitating what everyone else says...but at times I found it to be a bit much. And resultantly, I think your message becomes a bit lost (though I was greatly amused by the skull photo, heh.)  I also couldn't help but notice one thing. You wrote:    However, as Joe and others have pointed out, Kevin Klein is not irreplaceable.   It's kind of reaching that point of being a double negative (not irreplaceable) and I think it becomes easier to read when written as, ""...Kevin Klein is replaceable"".   That aside, I thought your point about Boyle/Klein was interesting. I didn't know that, but it made me realize how much people shit on Boyle at times :P (though to be fair, I think Boyle is more offensively-minded than Klein is). Before we ship Klein off somewhere else, I'd really like to see how he does for at least another season with us.   Thanks for for the article!"
rangers,3coo0t,invrsleep,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your feedback tremendously! How can anyone expect to improve if they don't take constructive criticism to heart?  I write far more serious and well thought-out articles for Blueshirt Banter where I take a great deal more time in my research and editing... this was not one of those articles. When things get categorized under ""Bantering Around"" on the site (and when they have a skull drawing and references to a historical figure from Kitchener) it means that they're humorous and not necessarily worried about making a great deal of sense from a sports journalism perspective. The objective of this article is not to make people finally agree about what the right thing to do about Kevin Klein is (IMO). The objective is to make people laugh, think, and perhaps come closer to sharing my opinion on what the Rangers should do with Klein. Also, to pass some time between today and when more real Rangers' news comes to pass.  Words are amazing. If I had phrased that line (which was intended only to provide a link to a story that my fellow writer wrote) ""Klein is hardly irreplaceable"" I would not have run into a double negative but I'd more or less be saying the same thing.   Again, thank you for your feedback and thank you for reading.   Another year of holding onto Klein would mean that we might find ourselves needing to move his contract when his stock is profoundly lower than it is today. Just some food for thought."

rangers,3coo0t,blueshirtdave,2,Thu Jul 9 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the article!  I'm one of those people that thinks we shouldn't trade him, so I just wanted to provide my opinion respectfully.    The basic bits of the article I grabbed were that he wasn't likely to continually score points at a higher than expected rate, and that last season was a fluke.  I'm not saying he'll win the Norris, but the stats seem to indicate that he's getting better each season.  Here's some other stats from the last 6 years (minus the 12/13 shortened season and the 13/14 season, where he played for multiple teams - always an adjustment period):    Scoring: 09-10 (NSH): 11pts (1 goal, 10 assists) 10-11 (NSH): 18pts (2 goals, 16 assists) 11-12 (NSH): 21pts (4 goals, 17 assists) 14-15 (NYR): 26pts (9 goals, 17 assists)    Playoff Performance: 09-10: 2pts 10-11: 3pts 11-12: 4pts 14-15: 4pts    Shooting Percentage / Total Shots: 09-10: 1.5 / 67 10-11: 2 / 99 11-12: 4 / 97 14-15: 11.8 / 76    From those, it seems to show me a player who's improving with each year that goes by.  Now, obviously 11.8% shooting is very high, and I don't expect him to hit that again.  But he HAS been increasing that stat each year (aside from the two I didn't include for obvious reasons), and he took fewer shots this year than he has since his first full year.  Is it that strange for him to shoot at a higher percentage with each year?    Again - I want to make it clear I'm not saying he'll score 40 or 50 pts and shoot 15%.  But to say that he had a fluke year, given his previous years, is just not something the stats seem to support.  I get that $2.9 million is a lot, but he's been incredibly consistent, and is coming off a career year (each year he's played in the NHL so far), so if we're going to trade him, let's acknowledge that it's purely for cap reasons, and not because we don't expect him to keep getting better.  The stats don't support that at all!    Like I said though, I enjoyed the article, and appreciate the discussion.  I'm not an expert at projections or judging someone's worth long term, I can only go by what I see and what the stats tell me year over year.  And unless I'm completely blind here, I don't see a declining player who had a fluke 14/15 season.    Cheers for the debate though!"
rangers,3coo0t,Sailor_Chris,3,Thu Jul 9 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"I absolutely appreciate your opinion and the presentation of your case, but the bottom line here is that we don't need to look at his offensive production to understand that he should go. His offensive numbers are, by and large, irrelevant because of the Rangers' cap situation and the several ""obstacle contracts"" (my pet name for them) that the Blueshirts have on the books. These are contracts that are long term and have NMC or NTC built into them either throughout the term of the contract or for the first few years (when the player's value is at its highest). When we stick the Kevin Klein debate into a pot and reduce it to its most basic points we should all come up with three things waiting for us at the bottom of the pot:   Kevin Klein will almost certainly not do what he did last season offensively. His stock will never be higher. We have 4 key RFAs, 8 forwards under contract, and about 10 million in cap space to play with.  One of those RFAs is Derek Stepan and it's a foregone conclusion that he's going to be making a lot of money (at this point, north of $6 AAV). Etem and Miller need bridge deals and Jesper, thankfully, just needs a shade under a million to keep him as a great player in the bottom six. It's tight. It's not impossible, but its tight. Because it is tight and because Klein has no clauses on his contract and is currently at the highest trade value he could possibly be at, the Rangers really should trade him.   Now, to your points! I'm not sure that I suggested in any way that Klein was and/or is a player in decline, but as it turns out I happen to believe that we can (and should) expect a noted decline in his play if he remains a Ranger for the duration of his contract. The jump in his production last season is a ""fluke"" not because he wasn't making small steps to being a more productive player (like almost all reasonably talented NHLers on the right side of 30 do), but because the preposterously high shooting percentage that he had is in no way sustainable or indicative of his ""growth"" as a player. The stats you provided very much support that a S% of 11.8 is exorbitantly high for someone who has no established history of elite scoring (anything over 10% is elite scoring).  The statistics that you presented do illustrate that he has been improving at a very modest rate, but as you said they by no means implicate that he can be expected to be a significant contributor to the team's offense next season or any season after that. The long story short- the small improvements made annually in his offensive production (which, by the way, is in no way how we should measure the value of a defenseman) has no impact on why the team should move Klein and his contract. He could have scored 12 goals and had a shooting percentage of 18% and the club should still be moving him given the cap constraints facing the team.  It is more or less universally accepted and proven that most players reach their prime within the age 27-29 window. There are a lot of factors involved that need to be taken into account, including injuries and how long a player has been playing at the highest levels of competition (wear and tear), but that is a pretty accurate window of a player's ""prime"" playing years. Klein is 30 and turning 31 in December. I wouldn't say that his game is in decline and that we should expect his basic offensive stats to dip from what they were two seasons ago. I'd say that he is a player that doesn't hurt his team when he's on the ice and can and does decent work on the third pair of a very good hockey team, with a very good defensive system, and one of the best goalie in the world behind him. However, like almost every human being that has played hockey before him, we can and should expect for him to reach his plateau well before he turns 33 years old which is how old he will be when his contract expires in 2018.   I'm glad that you enjoyed the article. Thank you for taking the time to share your opinion! I hope that I didn't infuriate everyone with my wordy response. I know no other way, I'm a mediocre writer.  p.s. I happen to like Klein a lot and would happily have him on the third pair for the next three seasons if the Rangers' salary cap situation was different."
rangers,3coo0t,sofakingmad,3,Thu Jul 9 17:39:54 2015 UTC,"I hear you, I really do, but I still disagree.  Many players have played some of their best hockey after the alleged ""prime years"" have passed.  Now, that doesn't mean Klein will, but based on his stats I'd say it's not out of the realm of possibility that in the next couple years of his contract, he ""could"" get better each year.    I guess my point is that we acquired him as a right handed defender who we could count on to be solid in defense, and perhaps chip in on the offense from time to time.  However, he's shown that he's capable of moving up and scoring, and putting quite a few points on the board.  So we've got a very solid defender who (based on his last few years) could be on pace to surpass 30 pts next season.  That would be an excellent return for 2.9million a year, and would probably get him bumped to the 2nd line with Staal.  If he simply maintains his scoring level with no improvement, it's still a good return.  In other words, the only way this situation with Kleiner goes south would be if he starts struggling on defense (not likely), or his offensive production falls off the face of the earth (which doesn't appear likely given his progression each year).  And if his point production drops to 15-20, that would put him in Staal's range, and we're paying him almost double what we're paying Klein.  I would argue that although Staal is a better 1v1 defender, Klein makes fewer mistakes and is more reliable.    I'm also tired of getting rid of solid defenders.  We shipped a good reliable defender in Anton Stralman off last summer, and he put up 39pts for the Bolts.  We've got a guy in Kleiner who hit 26 last season, and missed 17 games.  I calculated his stats for the whole season (if he wasn't injured), and it came to 33pts.  So we could potentially have a 33pt 3rd/2nd line D-man for 1.6 million a year LESS than Stralman.    It's almost like the mentality is to keep sponging.  At some point I think the organization needs to realize that when we scored a homerun of a deal (which Klein's is), we need to hold onto it.  So he'll be 34 in 2018... ok?  For a good reference point - Dan Boyle had his highest scoring years (50+pts each year) when he was 32, 33, and 34 years old respectively.  That would be the same timeframe on Klein's contract.  He's not the scoring threat Boyle was then, true, but again, we're getting a much more solid defender AND offensive production.    As for the shooting percentage - as mentioned I agree that it was very high and he'll probably never hit that again, but let's remember he took less shots than any year since his first full one in the league 6 years ago.  If you take fewer shots that are on target... and score quite a few goals... your percentage WILL be higher.  Think about it like this... if you push his ratio of shots per game out to a full 82 games, then assume he doesn't score another goal (definitely a possibility), then he shoots 9.4%.  The stat that jumps out at me though is that using that math, his shots for the year on 82 games would be 96 - which is perfectly in line with previous years.  So that tells me he's shooting about the same number of shots on target year after year, relative to the number of games he played.  It's just that more of those went in this year than they normally do.  Is it luck?  Yeah, some of it was luck.  Some of it was also having good screens (which he'll have basically the same players setting in the next few years), and some of it was simply taking initiative and trying to make a difference (see game winning goals).  Either way, the guy is consistently taking shots and playing a part in our wins, both defensively and offensively.    And again, I know we can only talk so much about offensive stats with a defender, but we're also talking about a guy that CAN do both, and has proven it over the years.  Were he just a Girardi clone, I'd argue we pay him too much now (just like a believe we pay G too much).  But since he's capable of both sides of the game, it puts him in a different conversation.    And on a totally different note - I know that most of this bit about potentially dealing Klein is related to how much we re-sign Step for.  I love Step and feel he embodies a great Ranger player, but I also don't think he's worth as much as he'll likely ask for (and get).  I've gone into detail in other posts about it, but his struggles in the faceoff circle are what keeps him from being an elite center making north of 6.5/7 million a year.  He's simply outstanding offensively, literally couldn't ask for more.  And he's tough, plays great defense when needed, and is an extremely likable guy.  But we were abysmal at faceoffs last year (and the year before, etc, etc), and aside from Dom, all of our centers struggle mightily.  We're paying Brass less than Step will ask for, and yet he's just as capable offensively.  I know faceoffs aren't the only component of a good center, but if you win 44.1% of them (Step's % last year), then every time you're taking one, more often than not you're giving up possession, and all those glorious offensive stats go to the backburner.  Again, I want to make it clear he's an outstanding player, but I'm not in agreeance with trading Klein or another solid player or two so Step can get that extra million he's wanting to be paid.  If he was at 50% or higher on faceoffs, no problem.  But when you can't even have half a chance to win them, that's a problem."
rangers,3coo0t,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Thu Jul 9 18:58:08 2015 UTC,"Many have, but the vast majority haven't.  Expecting him to surpass 30 points is asking a hell of a lot from Klein given his track record and the fact that he isn't on the power play, where the vast majority of scoring defensemen pick up a bulk of their points.  Happy to agree to disagree with you, Dave. I just don't think Kevin Klein is the player that you seem to think he is (or can be), and that's fine. Was still happy to get into a discussion with you. Have a great day, dude."
rangers,3coo0t,blueshirtdave,2,Thu Jul 9 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Cheers man, I enjoyed the discussion!  Also happy to disagree with you.  If he stays, I hope he scores 30pts each of the next three years and we laugh for doubting it.  If he goes, I hope Diaz really steps up and fills that hole in the lineup, and that Klein has a poor season.  We'll just have to see.  Have a good day sir!"

rangers,3coo0t,dakraiz,3,Fri Jul 10 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry to butt into this argument but I think you're underestimating Step.    You cite his faceoffs but faceoffs shouldn't be a primary metric of the performance of a center. Yes they are important to an extent but I think you're overvaluing them. A few studies (1, 2) have been done looking at the correlation between possession and faceoffs and while it's there it's kind of a weak correlation. Obviously there are definitely situations where it's important to win faceoffs (i.e. power plays, PK, empty net) but overall it's not going to ruin your team if you're not winning a ton. Rangers were fairly solid at regaining possession after faceoff losses which is part of the reason they were successful even with poor faceoff performances.    On the other hand, Step produces points at the level of a top line center (as you noted he's very good offensively). Since 2011-12, Step is ranked at 15th in the league in 5v5 Points/game among centers with at least 2000 minutes played. Ahead of Anze Kopitar, Joe Thornton and Logan Couture. Brass doesn't even crack the top 20. I don't think Step will make $7M but I think he deserves a bit more than Brass."
rangers,3coo0t,dakraiz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:17:30 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  Here's hoping we can sign him and not trade Klein.  That would be the best of both worlds.  We'll just have to see.

rangers,3coo0t,dakraiz,2,Thu Jul 9 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"It was just about Step - sort of an afterthought.  TL;DR - I don't think we should sell Klein or another solid player so Step makes 7 million instead of 6, or 7.5 instead of 6.5, or whatever.  His faceoffs are poor and as such I don't consider him to be significantly better than Brass, whom we're paying a lot less than Step will ask for."

Try to pick a player that you think will be around for a while, like Lundqvist, McDonagh, Zucc, etc. If you're deciding between Nash or Kreider...it's tough because I could see Nash being traded in two years or so, but Kreider is coming up on the end of his contract next season, and if we're going through this much of a hassle with our RFAs now...

I think fast can excel if taken off the 4th line but the problem is, who would go there instead? Maybe Lindberg on the fourth with Hayes/miller centering the third?

Taking a step back, though, its a pretty good problem to have. In the end, I suppose we'll just have to hope that Miller can reach his potential and be a solid top-6 winger.  I imagine that Brassard will be traded in a couple of years to make room for Hayes on the 2nd line, but that isn't something I want to think about..."

rangers,3cjzz1,PhilipK_Dick,5,Wed Jul 8 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't know he had an NTC, my mistake. I wouldn't want him gone by any means, but I figured management would maybe see Hayes as being more attractive as a 2C, being that he is younger and similarly skilled as a playmaker. That doesn't really matter, though, if Brass isn't going anywhere anyways.  All in all, while I agree that the top-six would be best suited with Hayes, it would make out bottom six, mostly our third line, a bit of a jumble."
rangers,3cjzz1,guninmouth,3,Wed Jul 8 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"Hayes has always been a RW and should stay there imo.   Except for most of last year when he was doing a pretty damn good job at center.  Aside from face-offs, he plays the position well with his size, skating and vision.  I'm not sure he provides more value on the wing.  I also trust him more than Miller at C"
rangers,3cjzz1,arunnair87,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:29:55 2015 UTC,aside from faceoffs   The whole team has been lackluster in that dept. Luckily we have great defense to negate that.
rangers,3cjzz1,OCDHost,10,Thu Jul 9 04:02:32 2015 UTC,Does anyone have Hayes' stats when he was a center vs rw?   I feel like his game is much more suited as a center.
rangers,3cjzz1,PhilipK_Dick,3,Wed Jul 8 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think he would be better off on the wing, that way he only needs to worry about one thing, getting the puck in the net. He's below average on faceoffs anyway. Personally, I think the only way he can reach his full potential is if he is a winger."
rangers,3cjzz1,OCDHost,3,Wed Jul 8 16:14:37 2015 UTC,There is a lot more to playing center than faceoffs.  He did a very good job with covering the amount of ice and defensive responsibilities playing center last year.  How does he add more value as a wing?
rangers,3cjzz1,PhilipK_Dick,2,Wed Jul 8 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"If he's a winger, he won't have to focus on all the things centers need to be aware of, meaning he can focus mainly on offense, which is something we need. We did not score nearly as much as we should have last year (mostly during the postseason) and we need guys who are going to produce consistently."
rangers,3cjzz1,OCDHost,2,Wed Jul 8 21:55:56 2015 UTC,That leaves the very important role of third line center to an unproven rookie in Lindberg or JT Miller who has shown questionable decision making in the past (though he really got cooking late in the playoffs).  You can argue they should take a look at Lindberg as 3C during camp but unless he proves ready to come in and really anchor a third line that needs to create offense - the job belongs to Hayes IMO.
rangers,3cjzz1,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"We could always go out and sign/trade for a bottom six center. We need someone who's going to win faceoffs and grind. Hayes belongs in the top 6, and the only way he gets there is on the wing."
rangers,3cjzz1,adstretch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:07 2015 UTC,"I got the impression from Jeff Gorton's comments that this is our team.    If they want to sign Stepan, as well as Miller, Etam, and Fast - he only has $10.8 in cap space to work with.  The only trade you are going to see is if they can't get deals in place for those 4."
rangers,3cjzz1,NYRule1994,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"I actually would like to see Lindberg in that role, though obviously he has to play well to start the season to prove that he deserves it."
rangers,3cjzz1,aeroranger,3,Fri Jul 10 12:46:46 2015 UTC,I think he should be kept at center. Ideally I'd like the lines to look like this:    LW C RW    Nash Brassard Zuccarello   Kreider Stepan Fast   Etem/Miller Hayes Miller/Etem   Glass Moore Stalberg
rangers,3cjzz1,TheCaptainRon,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like he should be used as a center.  He's shown plenty of potential to be very good center offensively and defensively, and the only way for him to continue growing is to keep him there during the regular season.  If the team badly needs an offensive boost come playoff time, we could do what Tampa did during the playoffs with Stamkos and move him to the wing."
rangers,3cjzz1,PhilipK_Dick,2,Wed Jul 8 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of an Etem/Miler/Hayes line slotted wherever. 3 young guys. Hayes had a great year for us, Miller put it all together too. Etem could benefit from it and if he ends up getting the boost from A.V's system those 3 could be great secondary scoring and give some opposing teams some headaches match up wise."
rangers,3cjzz1,rvbcaboose1018,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:59 2015 UTC,That could be this seasons version of Zucc/Brass/Pou
rangers,3cjzz1,Seanut23,2,Wed Jul 8 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"I think there's a good case for both.   Hayes can fill the center role of we need him to. Otherwise, Lindberg or even Miller could take the spot of 3C allowing Hayes to become a 2RW.   we have some time though. I think we may start of weak this year ( what else is new) but by December we'll have our lineups and chemistry all set."
rangers,3cjzz1,adamrobertt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:34:28 2015 UTC,It really comes down to who can win face offs between miller Hayes and lindberg. Hayes has shown the most offensive upside so you want him playing the most min between the three. It'll be a rotating door for the last winger spot; whoever plays the best gets it
rangers,3cjzz1,DicNavis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"Hayes should be on the wing.  Also, you forgot about Lindberg, who is a natural center."
rangers,3cjzz1,keetner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"I hope we keep him at center, and I think Sather and Gorton may play a role in keeping it that way.  He is so much more valuable at center, due to his size and hands.  He has shown marked improvement on faceoffs and was satisfactory on defense by the end of the last season.  If secondary scoring is what we preach, three solid and creative centers is key.  His game is definitely best suited for the middle of the ice.  He takes up space in the neutral and defensive zones and draws defenders to him when he has the puck with the hands and vision to find open teammates for scoring chances.  I don't think he has the speed effectively play the wings on our top two lines and fit well into the existing system, as well.  Tl;dr for best results for Hayes and the Rangers, keep at center."
rangers,3cjzz1,DicNavis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was center for so much of last season, I almost think it would be a shame to have him shift to the wing + figure things out again. I mean, we've seen players swap and all that before and I don't imagine it being a terribly huge adjustment, but as a 'rookie', the consistency would probably help him develop better.   I'd actually be very curious to see him on the wing with Kreids and Step...but in general, I'd agree with you. I mean, we have so many other viable options (eg. Fast, Miller, perhaps Stalberg/Etem), that it might be wiser to keep him as C for now. And like you mentioned, I think Fast/Miller both have that speed that would work well along the sides (and honestly, we saw quite a bit of it this past season). But then I guess there's the issue of whether he would see enough minutes on the third line (I don't see him beating out Brass/Step for the top six).   Faceoffs -- yeah, people have talked a lot about his inability to win them, but keep in mind it'll be something he'll be working on in the summer (he even mentioned it in an interview, heh). I mean, there's probably no way to get better unless you practice them more. For example, I think quite a few of our guys got much better by the Playoffs (especially Brass)."
rangers,3cjzz1,MungTongue,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:16:24 2015 UTC,"Etem and Stepan have played together in the past at Shattuck St. Mary's... Not that it's a definite chemistry, but it would be interesting to see.  Etem definitely has a really promising skill set, and I would love to give him the first go with that line.  Miller also had some great stretches playing with Kreider and Stepan, so that's always an option as well.  I'm sure we'll see Hayes on the wing at some point this season when injuries do funky things to our line structure, but I think he belongs at center."

The team chemistry makes them pull together and be competitive all the time.  AV has delivered us to a Cup Finals and a Conference Finals (and a President's Trophy) in his first two seasons with us.  Couple this all with a the greatest goaltender in the league, who can steal wins for us even when the team struggles.  We are MOST DEFINITELY have what it takes to go all the way. Winning the Stanley Cup is not easy, but I think we'll have a shot this year, and in the next few years to come."
rangers,3chu94,r2dance2,16,Wed Jul 8 01:06:16 2015 UTC,"This might be homerism and using an excuse to validate an outcome, but had three of our top 4 defensemen not been seriously injured in the Tampa series, I think we would have beaten them and I seriously think we would have had a shot at beating the Blackhawks in the Final.

rangers,3chu94,berkley1217,19,Wed Jul 8 01:06:26 2015 UTC,"First off, we are not worse. I was having the same fears when all of the big trades happened, but talking with some people who were quite knowledgeable about where our team is right now has erased them.   We have all of our good guys who played amazing during the playoffs. Brassy, Kreider, Moore, Zucc, etc. These guys are very hard workers and can get shit done.   Yes, losing Swagelin was hard, but from what I have been hearing, we have the prospects that can somewhat replace him at a fraction of the cost.   Losing St. Louis was a must. This definitely made us better, in my opinion, because even though he was a great player and helped us through las years run, he was starting to get old. Yes he produced in the regular season, but after his knee injury, he wasn't quite the same.   Second, we are not going to lose Step. I have full confidence that the Rangers front office is doing everything they can to keep him, and luckily by signing some of these people, we have made cap space to pay him. Even though I believe we should get him for 6.5 at the most, I wouldn't be surprised if the Rangers go up to 7 or 7.5. In any case, I can almost guarantee he will be back.  If I am wrong though, we should have enough cap space to replace him with another player who is just as good.   Hope my opinion helps ease your mind about this year:)"
rangers,3chu94,guninmouth,2,Wed Jul 8 01:07:13 2015 UTC,"we are not going to lose Step   I fucking hope not.  That would be worse than the Bruins letting go of Lucic, and we would look like idiots.  He plays a strong D role while putting up roughly .75 ppg.  The deal Sather gave him in the first place was a joke.  If only he had the foresight to have offered him a 6yr/15m contract and not a 2yr/6.15m contract.  Sather made a few decent moves over the last couple of years, but I hope Gorton can make better long term decisions (eg: Glass for over a million, Dan Girardi's huge contract, drafting McIlrath over Cam Fowler and Vladimir Tarasenko...the list goes on).  Anyway, I'm sure we will be formidable this season, but I just hope we continue to stay that way for more than one season."
rangers,3chu94,gianthamguy,4,Wed Jul 8 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"While we lost Hagelin, we should hopefully have a healthy Zuc for the playoffs next year.   I'm worried as well, but we also have to take into account natural development within the organization. Hayes, Miller, Kreider, and Fast should all continue to improve.  Also, we did get younger in a sense. Marty is gone, Etem is younger than Hagelin, and Lindberg and Skej might be able to find some minutes depending on how everything goes."
rangers,3chu94,NikDaQuick1219,5,Wed Jul 8 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"Remember last year when we lost Richards, Pouliot, Stralman, and Boyle and everyone predicted us to not make the playoffs. Our division is stacked but we should still be one of the top teams. I think either us or CBJ will win it barring injuries."
rangers,3chu94,romano78,3,Wed Jul 8 02:38:40 2015 UTC,Honestly people overrate Columbus far too much. I'd say that the division is between us and the Capitals. The Blue Jackets(while adding Saad is big) aren't good enough to contend for any big season just yet. I think they'll be a fringe wild card team again.
rangers,3chu94,NikDaQuick1219,2,Wed Jul 8 07:54:44 2015 UTC,"If the Blue Jackets were healthy last year they would have given us a run for our money. They were the most injured team in the league and it wasn't role guys getting hurt. Caps lost Green and Ward, both bigger losses than they would care to admit. Oshie is good but not great and their blue line are getting older, especially Orpik. I think the Caps will be fighting with the Isles for a wild card spot."

We have a really solid group, and are poised to be one of the strongest teams in the East.  Anything can happen in the playoffs, but we won't have excuses based on our roster."

A full season of Yandle and an uninjured Boyle, any new kids up from Hartford (Skjei, McIlrath, Lindberg), and any other signing or trade that is made (Semin pls. Move Klein and Glass plssss) all cannot be understated.  Where have the Rangers taken any steps backward? The retirement of St. Louis? Should be mitigated by committee. The Hagelin trade? Yeah we'll miss him defensively, but his production will be replaced by Etem and others.  The Rangers will more than likely be better next year than they were last. That doesn't mean we'll take home the president's trophy (no matter how good you are, that takes some luck) but we have as good a shot at the cup as we've had in recent memory."

We lost Hagelin but he was always another one of those depth guys. We will survive without him.   Look, the Caps signed Williams and Oshie, but they also lost Brouwer and Green. Williams is old, and Oshie is overrated. The Pens now have their salary tied up in 5 guys, they will be good but I'm not concerned.   We made these moves to make space for Stepan. I am sure they will resign him. As much as I love St. Louis he was not a factor in our run this year.   The season hasn't even started yet why is everyone saying that we are no longer contenders? Did we not make a deep playoff run this year and win the president's trophy? Who have we lost that is really going to hurt us next season? Relax. Have faith. This is a good team."
rangers,3chu94,RhynoSorceress,3,Wed Jul 8 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand how the Rangers have gotten ""worse"" like a lot of fans are saying. MSL was non-extistant for the entire second half of the season and playoffs. Hags will be missed on the PK but guys like Hayes,Miller,Fast and Etem will all step up and help fill that void.  Everyone needs to stop hitting the panic button just because a few other Eastern teams made moves. The caps added Oshie and Williams (big whoop on Williams) while losing 3 of their key depth guys. The Pens got Kessel and will be a bigger threat for sure but we've proven that we know how to beat them time and time again. Flyers will miss playoffs, Islanders haven't improved at all, Blue Jackets picked up Saad and if are healthy will be much more competitive.  So let's just dial it back a bit here with the skepticism. We've got an excellent core of players and a top 3 goalie in the league. Yes we are a contender and no we're not worse than last year, or older for that matter (dumping MSL instantly makes us younger)."
rangers,3chu94,emildickson,2,Wed Jul 8 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"Loads of people are saying that we don't, however we are not really all that different from the 14-15 season. What I think most people are talking about is the fact that other teams around the league and in our division have gotten stronger through new acquisitions this summer (Kessel to Pens, Oshie and Williams to Caps, etc.).  We are still going to make the playoffs and we know that this team has it in them to turn it on in the playoffs. And then anything can happen! If we can stay a little bit healthier and maybe not hit each other in the head with pucks I think we still have as much of a chance as all of the other teams.   Let's wait until the season starts and see how we look before painting any nightmarish scenarios. I, for one, am crazily excited to see what Etem can do and what the young guys from Hartford can do if/when they get the chance!"

Losing cam was disappointing but not gamer breaker and we've made moves to shore up that spot. No reason to think we can't have just as good of a regular season next year. Although the east had gotten exponentially better, the rangers are still very very good. Yes allot of our older guys are getting older, which isn't great. But allot of our younger guys are just entering their prime or not even there yet"
rangers,3chu94,Robotron_25,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"Ill play devils advocate since everyone here is saying we got better.      We loose MLS who was still what?? 5th in points for us. Who adds that production? Etem or Stalberg, I don't think so. Maybe Hayes if he plays that top 6 winger role, possibly miller if he exceeds expectations, but they're also still young  and unproven, and Hayes is going into his infamous Sophomore year. Hope they can handle that pressure of needing to score consistently. Nash had himself a great year, we'll see if he can reproduce that, but many players go up and down year to year with their production. We'll see what happens with him. Trading Hags in terms of production was ok, we can get those points from someone else, but now we have and incredibly important PK position to fill, and by trading him we are loosing part of our fast pace identity. Hags was one of the two players who could just fly past a D and create a scoring chance (Kreider being the other). I think part of our identity is being lost by this trade. Also Raanta isn't going to be as good as Talbot, and we should expect slightly worse stats in our Backup G role. Our back end seems fine, and Hank will always keep us in a game, but I think our offense is going to be less productive and unless Hank and our D have a spectacular season, I expect us to regress in terms of Points.   Also many competing Metro teams we're able to add big pieces to their puzzle, while we gave up a piece or two. I love this team and will always stand behind them no matter what, but I don't believe for a second that we got better this offseason. I think we are still good enough to make the playoffs and as long as you do that, you can win a cup, but I don't see us getting the Presidents Trophy again.  I think we will have a 2-3 place finish in our division, 5-10 in the league."

rangers,3chu94,TheSensation19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"We have an elite goaltender who is always ready for a challenge and has proved so for the last 10 years+  We have one of the best defensive corps in the league, and our additions plus our prospects (who are claimed to be ready) only further this argument.   We have a strong 3 lines with or without Hagelin. Yes we MIGHT lose Stepan (though I do not see this happening) and even if we do it will come with a price of obtaining someone who is already in their prime (not a scenario I necessarily want) but its not like we lose him for shit.   Teams you fear, overated.  Oshie is a role player at best. He has proven to be more flash than actual hockey performance. He made a name for himself with dangles and shootout moves that dropped our jaws. He was overpriced and overvalued.   Williams is older. They lose Joel Ward, and they obtained Williams. At the very best I see Williams being a proper replacement for Ward but I think its two vastly different styles of play.   How did Tampa Bay get better exactly?  Just because they beat us last year... where we had our 3 best defenders all banged up with broken legs... you can probably put 4 actually. We took them to Game 7. I mean, cmon.   For those complaining about Hank's age.  The dude showed his BEST season last year. The 5 best goalies I can think of all time had their best years, championship winning years as well, between 33-40. As long as we continue to put strong players in front of the goalie, Talbot could lead us to a championship. So Hank will be just fine.   We are more than OKAY.  We are once again a playoff team."
rangers,3chu94,shane727,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:58:50 2015 UTC,I heard somewhere on the radio today someone compare them to the 90's Knicks. You know a power house team that has made some runs but just can't get over that final hump. The logical part of me partly believes this and that our best MAY be behind us but the fan in me doesnt want to believe that. I dont want to end up like my Knicks in the 90s always contending but never winning. I think we have 2 seasons left to really make it happen before we'll need some real tweaking and rebuilding.
rangers,3chu94,CrowTR2,3,Wed Jul 8 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Probably the only reason someone made that prediction is the Lundqvist is Patrick Ewing. Which is a bit farfetched besides that both played in NY and haven't won a championship.   The problem with the Knicks in the 90s was always running into Jordan's Bulls. Sometimes Reggie and the pacers. There aren't teams in the East that are like that, I can't say the Caps because Rangers play well against them, maybe the Habs or Lightening but it's not clear at the moment.  And the Rangers window of opportunity is as long as Lundqvist is playing like Henrik Lundqvist so at least 5 years. Assuming he's healthy, and in those five years I'm sure the Rangers will be grooming a successor maybe Snapski who knows."

He makes his paycheck off of doom and gloom for the Rangers. The epitome of a hack. It's a crying shame that all of our beat writers are absolute dog shit."
rangers,3cbu4c,wheelzr,2,Mon Jul 6 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yep pretty much agree with you on all points. When you look around and see guys like Aaron Portzline with the CBJ and compare their work...not even close.  Of course there are a zillion blogs that regurgitate the couple of bear writers that have access to the team....we all know who they are. Occasionally they'll have relevant TV analysis of plays, but they are mostly garbage. I do miss Kevin Delury doing his blog, he had a format that worked and never made the mistake of taking his opinion too seriously.   All that said, Steve Zipay and Boomer are the only guys take seriously. Both generally seem to be conscious of their credibility instead of grabbing reactions and clicks"
rangers,3cbu4c,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you with everything except Zipay. He constantly gets things wrong and has pretty much no sources and has broken nothing of significance. Other great beat writers are Arthur Staple who covers the isles and the guy who is the main beat writer for the Wild Michael Russo.  And yes, Brooks does have legit sources but he is also a world class fear monger. Plus, he looks like a rat.   Please, there's gotta be someone of us out there with decent writing skills who can rise up and become the beat writer this city needs."

rangers,3cbzju,sleipe,3,Tue Jul 7 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for everything you guys do! I'm glad you all try to keep things up to date so it's really appreciated.   I actually quite like the sub. I mean, I like the colour schemes (eg. the third jersey colours we kind of have going) and the fonts. I also like how the side bar has been laid out with the image, relevant info (whether it be regular, post-season, or off-season related stuff), and associated links. The only thing I would have to really critique is the CSS (I think that's what it is?) that's involved.  By that I just mean, depending on the size/resolution of the monitor I'm using, I notice the layout tends to move. For example, on larger screens, you get a fair amount of white space and if you minimize the window just a bit, you can see the links at the top shift over. If you look at some of the other subreddits, you can see that whether minimized or not, the layout typically fits. Not to add salt to the wound or anything, but I think /r/Hawks does a good job at the formatting. I also think the button that goes back to the home page was accidentally moved too much to the left (from when it got switched to Glass and back, lol).   I understand that these might be more of a knit-picky thing, but the point is, I really like the ideas and all that we have on the sub, I just wish it could be cleaned up a bit because I think that goes a long way. Thanks again!  (P.S. I'm not sure if you're all thinking about completely redesigning the sub or not, but regardless, would it be possible to still keep the toast? I know it's been two seasons now, but damn, I love that thing so much and I feel like it adds a bit of subtle quirk to the place, heh.)"

rangers,3cco4x,johnjust,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"Some players can be instrumental in their teams success, but it doesn't mean they have the qualities to be a captain or assistant captain. But Zuc is great in the locker room, so he seems likely to be a good leader on the ice. I just don't think integral should directly correlate to captain however."

rangers,3cco4x,johnjust,14,Wed Jul 8 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"I think either Staal should get his A back permanently and rotate between G and Step, or give Step the permanent A. I think it's pretty clear the organization views him as our franchise forward, and he's deserving of it - he plays in all situations, leads by example, his teammates love him, there's really no reason not to. Plus, i hate having 4 A's - it seems gimmicky and not like something an Original 6 team should do.   But, if we have to give another A, it'll need to go to a forward, so my guess would be either Zucc (everyone loves that little spark plug), Nash (knows how to lead, our best forward), Brass (really came into his own last season), or Dom Moore (commands respect), but probably most deserving is the big number 15, Tanner Glass. Think about it, the dude has a sick mullet hair cut, singlehandedly turned the Hamburgler into the authorities with a wicked wrister, and since AV loves him, it seems like a perfect fit, just like how his fists fit perfectly into the faces of all those who tremble before him. Crazier things have happened, so....."

Someone else mentioned Brass. I get the feeling he's a little shy and I wonder how well he'd assume the position. He had a great season this past year, and I'd almost be too worried to give him an A in fear of it adding a bit of unnecessary pressure (I feel like this happened a little bit with Mac).

rangers,3casf6,Calad,3,Mon Jul 6 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"I could still see him being a late bloomer. The article clearly points out how his development was stifled by a bad knee injury, and it wasn't until the 2nd half of last season that he started to dominate the AHL. What we do know is that the organization qualified him, so they at a minimum still think he has value, and the AHL coaching staff loves him and have praised him for how well he's improved his positioning and skating. I think if they were going to give up on him, they would've done it already.   As far as I'm concerned, there'll be 2 spots on the blue line next year (16-17) after Boyle and Yandle are off the books. I think if the undertaker is still a part of the organization, he'll have one of those spots."
rangers,3casf6,PaulSach,3,Mon Jul 6 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"He lost me at ""Raphael Diaz could play second pair minutes better than Klein"".

rangers,3casf6,guyzieman,5,Mon Jul 6 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he never said that.    And even if the Rangers move Klein, Diaz is more than just a seventh defenseman, he's more than capable of playing even second pairing minutes for the Rangers if needed ."
rangers,3casf6,Ralph_Baconader,3,Mon Jul 6 14:37:17 2015 UTC,"I did paraphrase a bit but my point is that, assuming everyone is healthy, Diaz is not a top 4 on the Rangers. Even without Klein."
rangers,3casf6,guyzieman,2,Mon Jul 6 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"That's fair, I think everyone knows that Klein is better than Diaz. But to be honest I probably feel more comfortable with Diaz than Boyle. He's a strong skater and if Klein was moved and Yandle continued to have defensive struggles, I wouldn't be completely opposed to giving Diaz some time on the second pairing"

rangers,3casf6,BrettG10,2,Mon Jul 6 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"Please explain to me how you anticipated the Jessiman pick panning out ""a mile away""..."
rangers,3casf6,Sir_Dankity,2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:52 2015 UTC,It was a high-risk choice for a team bereft of prospects. Jessiman was a huge project for a team that wasn't well-positioned to take that risk. Getzlaf and Parise were lower risk picks than Jessiman.
rangers,3casf6,BrettG10,2,Mon Jul 6 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"Additionally, that draft demonstrated what I perceived to be a huge flaw in scouting that has gone away to some degree since - teams tend to overdraft bigger guys who dominate leagues before everyone else adds 2-3 inches and 20-30 pounds of size. Jessiman played well in an inferior league alongside other talented players. Once the size advantage was mitigated in the AHL, his lack of talent shown through.   Parise was a victim, sliding on concerns about his size.   McIlrath was another pick like this where the team focused on size/grit over talent (Fowler/Tarasenko) - however, I'm still hopeful. I've heard he's made tremendous strides down in Hartford this year."
rangers,3casf6,BrettG10,3,Mon Jul 6 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"I've heard he's made tremendous strides down in Hartford this year.   Thats probably th biggest difference between McIlrath and Jessiman - he's actually become a better player during his time in Hartford. From everything I've read, he has fantastic positioning and has greatly improved his skating. I think of him kind of like a tougher Dan Girardi type Dman, in that what he lacks in the skating department, he makes up for it with his awareness, positioning and grit. Yeah, probably not the type of player you want to pick at 10th overall, but at that time, it was an organizational need, our defense was as soft baby shit melting on a city street during the summer, with Hank getting run constantly (to the point where he had to take matters into his own hands) and McIlrath would improve our toughness.   I think, in hindsight, the pick just keeps seeming worse because the game has changed in the past 5 years, and so has this team. Yes, Fowler would've been nice, be we had a promising young offensive dman in Del Zotto (LOL) at the time. McIlrath will probably never be a 1, 2, or even 3 defenseman, but he should have some semblance of a career, barring injuries, of course. I think that's what truly separates him from Jessiman."
rangers,3casf6,PaulSach,2,Tue Jul 7 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Extremely well said, Paul. I hated the pick at the time (I recall wanting Fowler - I'm a huge believer in BPA, especially in the NHL where guys are usually 3-4 years away - I didn't know much about Tarasenko at the time). As you said, the game's moving away from 'tough' guys, especially poor skating tough guys - I think even AV made comments in this manner when McIlrath was up early in the year. I've heard Dylan's skating's improved, but he'll never be a plus skater - which is fine, plenty of pedestrian skaters have succeeded defensively. I've read that he's excellent at winning battles against the boards - a huge plus that can help drive puck possession.  That was the year of the Carcillo incident where Girardi stood around and did nothing when Gaborik was beaten up, if I recall correctly (I recall an incident against the Flyers, but my memory may be off). It felt like such a forced need pick at the time. I forgot the incident against the Habs, but do recall it happening quite a bit.  Trust me, the pick still burns me, but I'm hoping he becomes a force. Ranger fans, IMO (and this is a generalization), have had a hard time divorcing the cost to acquire a player and the player himself. I think we overpaid for Yandle, but still like him a great deal - my dad loves ripping on him even when it isn't really warranted because he loved Duclair."
rangers,3casf6,BrettG10,2,Tue Jul 7 12:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think we're all about in the same boat. We've all been burned in the past by bad drafting and signings and trades, and we don't want it to happen again. I'm also always on team BPA, but I guess Sather and Co wanted to draft needs instead that season, which could end up being a mistake, but it could also pan out well for us.   The past two years, people have been saying that we need to get bigger, stronger if we want to win it all, and McIlrath certainly adds the size and strength that has been missing from our blue line for a long time, so an argument can be made that he is still an organizational asset and need, but like I said, the game has changed, and it might not be as big of a factor as we think it is.   As for the Yandle trade, I always justify it in my head with the salary retention. Without it, we'd be in an even worse cap situation. That being said, was sad to see the Duke go, but glad to see our defense jump into the top 5 in the league."
rangers,3casf6,PaulSach,2,Tue Jul 7 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"Most Dman take a while to develop. He's had 3 pro seasons with injury setbacks that have slowed him down a bit. I'd have no problem having him on as a 7th. Diaz is pretty good but he's not a guy you have playing 82 games. I think Skjei could probably use some time to adjust to the pro game, and while he gets that, McIlrath could get some time with the big club."
rangers,3casf6,Jk186861,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:29:29 2015 UTC,He just can't seem to hit true nhl level for some reason. I think he's somewhat of a bust at this point.

rangers,3ccbal,DontTestTheUser,6,Mon Jul 6 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"Not exactly what I meant.  Glass is a hard working 4th line grinder whose not afraid to take the body, AV trusts him on defense and so forth.   A struggling Semin is not going to beat out Glass. Two vastly different positions and roles. You cant expect Semin to hit people.   I am just saying, why not check him out for our 3rd line."

rangers,3ccbal,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Mon Jul 6 20:37:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, Semin is actually good. He didn't score a lot last season but part of that was just poor luck. If we can get him for cheap then maybe that'd be good but idk where we'd slot him.

Hayes can play center with JT Miller/Fast and Semin"

rangers,3ccbal,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:33 2015 UTC,Faceoffs aren't the only reason for bringing him up. He's a pretty good player all around. I think he played well when he was called up this past season but AV's fucking Tanner Glass boner wouldn't let him stay with the team. Everything I've read has said that Lindberg is NHL ready.
rangers,3ccbal,xxdarksyde73xx,-1,Tue Jul 7 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"How do we even know he is good at faceoffs lol. Can I get some facts on this stat for him.   He played like 4 games. He played solid. But unnoticeable. Unlike Fast during his first few times. I am not saying he cannot make the team, I am saying that just because it was told that he COULD make the roster, that he is READY does not mean he actually will."
rangers,3ccbal,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Tue Jul 7 12:36:48 2015 UTC,Not really sure but from what I've heard he's somewhat solid. Would be nice to see some stats.    And honestly I disagree.

He's been one of the Wolf Pack's best players and a lot of Rangers bloggers (and apparently people in the organization) think he's NHL ready. Move Hayes to 2nd line wing. Lindberg is the 3C. Hypothetically we have: Nash - Brass - Zucc Kreider -Step - Hayes Etem - Lindberg - Miller Stalberg - Moore - Fast    Hard to really find a spot for Semin there. Realisically maybe we don't move Lindberg up and then Hayes and Miller swap off 3C/3rd line winger spots and we have Semin on the 2nd line wing. It'd kinda be a waste to use him in the bottom six.
rangers,3ccbal,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Mon Jul 6 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"I would not put Lindberg over D.Moore. And why is Fast on 4th line, fast proved he is good enough to play second line minutes.   Nash-Brass-Zucc Kreid-Step-Fast Hayes-Moore-Miller Stalberg-Lindberg-Etem   Either or with Miller/Etem IMO"
rangers,3ccbal,jm7393,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:39:18 2015 UTC,I would as long as he's comfortable in the NHL. I feel like Lindberg has more up side than Moore. And Fast being on the 4th line is simply because he isn't as good as Hayes or Miller. I liked him in the playoffs but I think he's a better fit for the 4th line than Etem.
rangers,3ccbal,redpotatochip6,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:46:26 2015 UTC,"I agree about Fast. It seems like a lot of people are hellbent on him skating with the 4th line, but he's deserving of a sport in the top 9. Give him the minutes, and he can put up points. He has great speed, is physical, has an outstanding IQ for the game, and a great shot. He's not just some grinding plug to fill in the holes."
rangers,3ccbal,OCDHost,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:29:56 2015 UTC,"Top 6 and Bottom 6 are for non-playoff teams now. Its top 9 and bottom 3 now. Look at the best teams last year and its true.   Semin playing for the 3rd line at the start is fine in our line up because the 3rd line is not a grinding line. Its just another depth line being asked to play Rangers hockey. Fast, quick, smooth"
rangers,3ccbal,Ben_Ulrand,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:56:24 2015 UTC,Fair point. But I still don't see room for him of Lindberg ends up NHL ready in October (which he very likely will be).
rangers,3ccbal,bjisba41,0,Mon Jul 6 21:01:16 2015 UTC,"Listen,   No one here more enjoys when we bring up a player from our AHL team. I like developing a strong core like this but just because AHL coaches said hes ready... doesnt mean he is. They said the same thing about Bourque.   It doesnt mean hes the guy. It just means they can start looking at him in a real role.   Fast was ready because he played in the post season. Lindberg has not. They are literally saying the same about Mcilrath right now. Buekaboom came out and said hes ready and hes improved a lot. Doesnt mean he can actually crack out the top 7.   Btw. Where is Lindbergs faceoff stats. Hearing hes better than Hayes in FO%, meanwhile I am hearing AHL doesnt offer Faceoff stats."
rangers,3ccbal,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:32:53 2015 UTC,Well the thing is it's not just the AHL coaches that said he was ready. Adam Herman from Blueshirt Banter said that some people in the organization believed he was ready (though he didn't drop specific names).     The other thing is that bringing in a free agent to potentially block Lindberg out of the lineup when we're already in a cap crunch seems counterproductive.     As for the faceoff stats thing I'm not so sure. Most major stats sites that I know of don't carry AHL stats.
rangers,3ccbal,bjisba41,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:44:37 2015 UTC,Everyone is better than Hayes at faceoffs.

rangers,3ca2rn,guyzieman,16,Mon Jul 6 07:42:36 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Brassard, remember how a lot of people (including myself, honestly) thought he was way overpaid at $5 mil coming off of a 45 point season? He really shut up any doubters this year."
rangers,3ca2rn,James_Caan,6,Mon Jul 6 12:49:17 2015 UTC,Such a bargain especially looking at the current center market. I was a doubter and he shut me up.
rangers,3ca2rn,swingingthechain,-12,Mon Jul 6 14:29:25 2015 UTC,Lets see if he does it again. One good season in his entire career and fanboys are picturing his face when they jerk off.
rangers,3ca2rn,stastro,9,Mon Jul 6 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"Of the five full seasons he's played (he got 25 points in 31 games before being injured as a rookie, and 29 points in 47 games during the lockout season), he's only once run below 40 points, and that was when he was 22. Combine that with his three really good post-seasons, and I would say his career can be summed up as more than one good season, and more like ~six good seasons and one really really good season."
rangers,3ca2rn,James_Caan,3,Mon Jul 6 15:01:44 2015 UTC,"This is nothing like the other 3. They knew what they were worth on the high end and planned accordingly. With Stepan, the number everyone threw around was $6-6.5mil. Ryan O'Reilly fucked that up big time signing a huge deal with a team that needed to blow some extra money. The arbitration award could easily be $7-8mil, which means we start dropping pieces in order to keep him."
rangers,3ca2rn,bjisba41,6,Mon Jul 6 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"This is factually incorrect. ROR was a UFA after that deal. Stepan RFA. Inadmissible in arb hearing, per CBA."
rangers,3ca2rn,MungTongue,2,Mon Jul 6 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"For one more year...either way they're going to be looking to buy up UFA years on this next deal. Arbitration is going to be looking at other contracts to similar players like ROR (7.5m cap hit) and Stasny (7m cap hit), so Stepan is no longer the 6m player we pegged him at."
rangers,3ca2rn,bjisba41,2,Mon Jul 6 21:05:40 2015 UTC,This is a very routine procedure. Tons of players file for it and it just keeps things from getting messy.
rangers,3ca2rn,swingingthechain,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"didn't Avery make it to arbitration a couple times? might have been before 2009. Man, I've been watching this team for a long time."
rangers,3ca2rn,profchaos2001,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:31:27 2015 UTC,"Some have made it closer than others, but you're absolutely right.  No one really wants this to go to arbitration.  Both sides would much rather come to a deal that they can both be happy with than have it decides by a third party."

rangers,3c8bzs,fakenipples,-14,Mon Jul 6 14:56:17 2015 UTC,Players are absolute money grabbers. Where is loyalty and playing for the team you love? They make millions of dollars and will make millions more but when is Greed a factor is players decisions. He would be offered a $2m dollar a year increase from NYR but that still isnt good enough. To label a 25 year old worthy of $6m plus is a joke unless they are of Crosby / Ovi / Gretzky standard.
rangers,3c8bzs,mcsyankees,10,Sun Jul 5 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, how dare he want to be fairly compensated. Hockey is a high-paying, high-risk job that, as a best case scenario, ends before you're middle-aged. He's not a worse or greedy person for wanting a competitive salary to people doing a similar job and filling a similar role."
rangers,3c8bzs,DeanYoungblood10,4,Sun Jul 5 22:30:39 2015 UTC,Where is the loyalty? Why don't the Rangers offer more money for the loyalty he has given to the club so far? It's ridiculous to completely blame the player. Calling him greedy for trying to get the most money for him and his family is stupid. The money he's asking for is also not completely ridiculous. Hopefully both sides can meet somewhere in the middle but this is not greed

rangers,3c8bzs,DeanYoungblood10,3,Mon Jul 6 00:33:13 2015 UTC,So that means that Stepan has to get screwed over?
rangers,3c8bzs,swingingthechain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"No it means that because of the cap the Rangers need to look out for their business. They can afford what they can afford.  If he wants to play in NY for awhile then he needs to make a sacrifice. If he doesn't want to do that, then hey more power to him.  I don't begrudge anyone trying to get their money when they are due. But playing in NY is a privilege and an honor. That's part of the equation that must be factored in. Loyalty isn't about blindly handing someone what they want, and it goes both ways."
rangers,3c8bzs,jacybear,3,Mon Jul 6 01:22:23 2015 UTC,The greed is In the owners that don't want to give their share to increase the cap so players can get paid

I had an engagement ring in my bag because I wanted to propose while we were at one of the more spectacular vistas of the Canyon.   Proposal went well (she said yes) and we later found a local townie bar in the middle of nowhere, Arizona.     I asked the bartender to switch to hockey and he looked at me like I was an alien.   This was a cliche western bar with sawdust on the floor and antlers on the walls.   After much searching through the channels, we found the game, but he wouldn't put the sound up.  We watched the 2nd and 3rd periods with no sound.  There was 1 other NY Ranger fan in the bar with us and we were living and dying on each play.     When (helmetless) MacTavish took that last faceoff with 1.6 seconds left, we knew we were seeing something special.   There MAY or may not have been a tear or two shed.     Marriage proposal accepted and Rangers winning the Stanley Cup.  It was a pretty good day.  When I got back to my apartment in NJ, my Ranger-fan friend who was feeding my cats left a post-it on my kitchen counter that simply said ""We got the Cup"""

Perhaps because it was documented so beautifully by HBO, my own memories of it seem richer. The show gave us a rare, much more intimate view of our beloved team, a team that was already one of our best in years. And the show's closing sequence gives me chills every time.  Despite how it ended, the 2011-12 season was truly special."

rangers,3c186b,RegularHorrible,5,Sat Jul 4 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"'94 is the obvious one for me and most alive at the time, so I'll give you my best memory I witnessed live at MSG: It was a game in 2001 against the Leafs. Late in OT, Mats Sundin has a 2 on 1, not a good sign for the Rangers. Mike Richter, with his trademark lateral movement, gets across to make the save. Play goes the other way and Brian Leetch scores the winner with just under 30 seconds to go. With that win, Richter passed Eddie Giacomin for the franchise wins record. The place was going bananas. Lundqvist has since broken that record, but it was a very special moment at the time. A few years later I was then lucky enough to be there for his number retirement ceremony."

rangers,3c186b,F_urOpinion,3,Sat Jul 4 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"I know I just wrote an entire novel, but this is some of the more meaningful and memorable moments in the past 10 years. Just a bit of the excitement, stressfulness, and just overall passion of what it means to be a Ranger.  Jagr's entire 2005-06 season - Best season ever for any NYR forward. That's all you need to know, this was just one of the beautiful goals that would happen.  Shanahan's NYR debut, 600th goal - You could just tell that Shanny was going to be a special part of the Rangers for the next 2 seasons. Sadly, we didn't get past the 2nd round, but he brought an identity for the fans and presence to the team that was just Hall of Fame worthy. It's no surprise that Cally embodied much of what Shanny resembled, after all, his late season call up and official rookie season were spent on the ice with mostly Shanny.  Shanahan fighting Brashear - this was amazing, Brashear was running around all game playing dirty, taking questionable hits on Jagr and others. Shanny had enough, at 38 years old, this guy took on one of the biggest heavyweights. Although he didn't really win the fight, he brought that entire crowd to their feet, he showed some balls and backbone that the Rangers didn't seem to have since the days of Messier. Special moment.  Cally goal vs Devils, game 1 in 2008 - I recommend watching the highlights to this entire series, the hate was terrific. But, the goal happens about 3min in, it just set the tone for the entire series and was a representation of Callahan's motor that never ever stopped. The best part is that this a time period where the Rangers and Devils rivalry was exactly what you thought it was. Crazy action, the fans hating each other, but what cannot be forgotten is the legendary Lundqvist/Brodeur battles. We all have to be appreciative over that, two of the greatest goalies of all time being the faces of this historical rivalry (that often doesn't get the respect it should).  Derek Stepan's 1st NHL game - Who can forget this? Hat trick in his 1st NHL game, it's crazy to think that he just finished his 5th season with us.  NYR comeback against Pens in 2010 - The Pens were a powerhouse team, a game like this was one of the building blocks that helped develop and make the Rangers what they are into today. The foundation that Hank, Staal, Girardi, Dubi, and Cally all learned under Renney and Torts became our identity, that leadership was grown and passed on to guys like McD, Stepan, Hagelin, Kreider and now you have guys like Hayes, Miller, Fast, and others learning from them. Back to this game, it was just resilience and damn sweet to watch. Shorthanded goal to tie, Dubi to Cally for the OT winner.  Zucc's 1st NHL goal, OT winner. - Gotta love to see how far Zucc has come with us, from an often (and unwarranted) healthy scratched player, to our best playmaking and top line winger.  Cally's 4 goal game, embarrassment of Flyers - You don't quickly forget 4 goal games, especially when it's accompanied with a national broadcast of an asskicking to the Flyers  Comeback against Boston - This game was a huge for the Rangers getting into the playoffs. Typical work ethic of the Torts' teams, you get some nice flashbacks too with the classic Prospal face, Dubinsky's energy that he and crowd shared together, even a Mike Sauer game winner. He could've been such a great player for us, sad that concussions had to end his career.  Winter Classic vs Flyers - The Rangers dominance of the Flyers that season was amazing, going back to the previous season, they had won I think 9 straight until Philly beat them. MSG is a house of horrors for them still. This whole game was great, freaking Mike Rupp with 2 goals, Henrik AGAIN with a God like performance. ""Richaarrrrdsss! Has broken the tie!""  Cally's 100th NHL goal - Just fun to watch, a beautiful, milestone goal in OT for one of the most beloved players and captains in NYR history during one of the most elating seasons that we have ever known.  Gabby's 3OT goal - No words needed, this was such a stressful and rewarding game.  Rangers/Caps, game 5, 2012 - One of my favorite games of all time, no words needed.  MDZ goal in game 7 vs Caps, 2012 - This happened right in front of me, I absolutely lost it here. The idea that the Rangers could actually make the ECF was becoming very real after this. They pulled it off, thanks for a memory like this MDZ.  Girardi OT goal vs Fishsticks - the goal happens around 6min. The Isles were making the playoffs for the 1st time in 7 years and this was one of the first classic NYR/NYI rivalry battles in a long time. Man, this was sweet, exact same atmosphere of those crazy games from this season.  NYR defeating NJ and NYR defeating NYI in the Stadium Series - I love these outdoor games, we take on our biggest rivals, crazy fan atmosphere, playoff type intensity, under the bright lights, and we've beaten all of hated local teams. We love it, and they can't stand us.  Carcillo goal vs Flyers in game 3 and Carcillo goal in game 7 - Dan Carcillo was probably my most hated NHL player a few years ago, but I absolutely adored him once he came here. It's just the perfect slap in the face to Philly after all those years of them using Carcillo to goon it up against us, we get them back with him scoring backbreaking goals.  Brad Richards GWG in game 7 vs Pens - If I could throw game 1, 5-7 in here, I would. From Brassard's OT winner, MSL inspiring the team, to Hank being a God, this was the finish of it.  MSL OT goal in game 4 vs MTL - Not only a fantastic and amazing goal, but putting the Rangers 1 win away from a SCF berth, that was special.  Rangers/Habs, game 6 - Just the entire game, the anticipation and excitement from the crowd, all the chances for NYR, the goal, just unreal saves from Henrik, then that final celebration. I miss these feelings.  Rangers 5 goal comeback vs Wild - Seriously, what an unreal game. It's almost bittersweet, really was hoping to see what Duclair could do as a Ranger, but nevertheless in his short time, he was a major part in a memorable game.   Rangers/Isles 6-5 and Rangers/Isles 2-1 - These games, along with the other NYR/NYI highlight on here is just classic. There's so much history behind these two teams, and it's fun when we're both good and hating each others guts. These two wins were just so freaking sweet. Suck it, Isles. Too bad they couldn't generate more than 11 shots on goal in game 7 to play us, like everyone wanted.  Kevin Hayes and Hagelin OT winners vs Pens - I'm gonna miss Hags so much, but so excited to see Hayes' career unfold here. Knocking out the Pens again is just so, so sweet.   Rangers/Caps game 5, 2015 - I was practically all out of hope. Our season was going to end on a goal by Curtis freakin Glencross (who I've disliked since a blindside/dirty hit on Drury years ago when he was a Flame). Kreider salvages some hope, McDonagh punches us a ticket for game 6. Love the emotion he shows when he's fired up.  STEPAN IN OT! GAME 7! - First game 7 OT winner for us since my 2nd birthday by a guy named Stephane Matteau! What can you say, unreal.   I don't even want to think about the next series, but knocking out the Flyers, Devils, Habs, Pens twice, and Caps 3 times (after they knocked us out twice) all since 2008, it's a lovely thing. We have memorable playoff series victories vs some of our biggest rivals, we have tons of Game 7's, we have some of the most stressful and life draining playoff storylines, we have some major ups along with some major downs. We almost have had it all these past 10 seasons in the post lockout/Henrik era. Everything, but that elusive  Stanley Cup.   We may win it with Hank and AV, we may not, but these past 10 years have given me emotions of happiness and sadness that couldn't be replicated, have given me some of the best/worst distractions that I just can't keep away from. No matter how sad every season ending has been, I just always want more of my Rangers. I can't wait for training camp and preseason (although 1st, there are specific personnel and roster moves I'd like to happen), but I wouldn't trade the heartbreak and happiness I've endured with this hockey club for the past 10 years for anything else, the highs have been so high and elating, while the lows have been real heartbreak.   Maybe, just maybeeee one day, we'll all be lucky enough to celebrate a Stanley Cup victory that makes all the emotions worth it. All that happiness and heartbreak can come together and can all get poured out at once, all of those memories would have been worthwhile for that elusive cup."

rangers,3c186b,ItsMachu,2,Sun Jul 5 04:30:48 2015 UTC,"Im 23 and an absolute nut job about hockey and my boys.  So after growing up with the Rangers being pretty crappy these past few years have been absolutely amazing to say the least.    I often have pretty decent watch parties at my house with 10+ friends and it gets pretty crazy, especially during the post season.  My favorite memory was the game 6 win over Montreal last year clinching my first (more than 2 years old) Stanley cup appearance.    I had probably 15 people over plus my family all decked out in our gear and when we clinched jumping and hugging that we made it, I actually fucking cried, it was amazing.  Sickest part is that I took a selfie video right when we clinched to capture the moment and it came out amazing!!!"
rangers,3c186b,CrowTR2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"My earliest memory is watching the Rangers slightly after 94 like mid to late 90s. I remember that gamenight intro theme and Sam Rosen shouting SAVE BY RICTHER, and JD with ""OH BABY CALL YOUR HEART DOCTOR"".  Rangers beating Montreal in game 6 is up there. I was in the city but was so busy I only could keep track of the score on my phone. Once I got free I went to Roses Pizza in Penn and was able to watch that amazing Lundqvist save, and Dominic Moore score in the second. Then my track number was called and I listened to the rest on ESPN radio.  That was more intense train ride, luckily it was pretty empty otherwise I probably would have scared a few people looking nervous. Listening to hockey games in general is tough, the announcers do their best trying to make you visualize everything but you still can be lost trying to picture what's going on.   I was kinda spoiled when I got a text from my parents that the Rangers won and then 30 seconds later I heard the call. It was a great feeling that the Rangers were going to cup. I was lucky to witness two of my favorite teams win championships in my lifetime but it nice seeing the Rangers get a chance to be in the finals (I was only 2 when they won 94, I have no memory of that) and I was so used to hearing on ESPN or NHL network predicting teams like Pittsburgh, Washington, New Jersey win the east."
rangers,3c186b,guyzieman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:43:44 2015 UTC,"Ill take a slightly different route here, and say when I had the opportunity to attend a practice session at their training facility in 2008. It was awesome being able to see first hand what goes into an NHL practice. I got to see guys inna looser environment. Before and after the session guys like Prucha, Voros, Dawes, and Korpikoski were just batting the puck to each other out of mid air lengthwise across the rink, its incredible how skilled even those guys were. We were sitting right on the outside of the corner boards so we got a lot of upfront action. The players were obviously very focused but every now and then between drills they'd give us a little nod or whatever, though a few players were a little extra generous and would go as far as flipping pucks over the boards to us (surprisingly enough the player who did this the most was probably Nik Zherdev). We didn't get to meet any of the players or anything (except for the on facility practice goalie) but it was still one of the coolest memories I have."
rangers,3c186b,NYRpuckhead,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"21 years old, but I have a couple of nice memories of the Rangers despite those dark years in the early 2000's. (List in no particular order)  1)Being at Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals with my friend who has season tickets.  It was the most intense Garden crowd I have ever experienced until 3 seconds left in the 1st and I knew it was going in before he shot the puck.  2)Being at Game 7 vs Ottawa. We were in the first row of the 400's and the fireworks went off right in front of us after the win. Just awesome to see us advance in that poorly officiated series.  3)Rozsival's 2OT goal vs Buffalo. The year after the Devils series where he kept passing the puck to Jagr (even though Jagr had a dislocated shoulder), it was amazing to see him actually shoot!  4)Nikolia Zherdev's goal with 8 seconds left in the game versus Pittsburgh.  The year after they eliminated us and the 1st game back at MSG vs them, just awesome!  5)Rangers vs Capitals December 30th 2006. Classic Old Time Hockey. Rangers win! Everyone fights! Shanahan beat up Brashear and then he goes and sucker punches Aaron Ward. My man Colton Orr won 3 fights and completely destroyed Ovie with a big hit and got suspended.  6)The line brawl vs Devils, as soon as Stu Bickel was in the dot I was prepared to see something awesome and we won all 3 fights.  7)One of the first few games I can remember going to was Rangers vs Flyers and Sandy McCarthy drops the gloves 3 seconds in. Good introduction to the game.  8)Game after Leetch was traded to Toronto on his birthday, I just remember the whole Garden chanting Go Leafs Go. Leetch was my favorite player growing up and was crushed when he was traded, and to be at the Garden after that helped younger me a lot.  9)When MSL score in OT I was on vacation in Disney. My family was going crazy and we were so pumped we couldn't sleep and took advantage of the magic hours and went to the parks until 4 am.  10)And this video has a hilarious ending, Sam's reaction is priceless."

Game was a roller coaster.  4) Gotta be surviving Game 5 against the Caps this year when our % chance of winning the series had dropped to like 1%.  5) The MSL Mother's Day goal and his reaction.  Outside of the playoffs:  The regular season game against the Pens in 11-12 where we were up 1-0 all game, the refs basically handed the Pens the game, we went down 2-1, and somehow we came back because of Dubinsky and Staal.

The Rangers games were on MSG, the Devils played on the now defunct Sportschannel. We didn't pay for it in my house so the video was scrambled but the audio worked fine. So, my whole family sat around and watched a fuzzy screen listening to Messiers guarantee come to fruition. I remember going crazy on the empty netter.

rangers,3c186b,F_urOpinion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:28:03 2015 UTC,"I just turned 23, my 2nd birthday was Matteau's goal in double OT in game 7, so 94 is out of the question.  But, man, I've lived and died with so many moments from these past 10 seasons. It's hard to have a particular order, but I'll throw some stuff out there   NYR sweep Atlanta in 1st round of 2007 playoffs, first playoff series win in 10 seasons. Callahan getting his 1st stint in the NHL (wearing #43), Henrik, Jagr, Straka, Nylander, Shanny, and Avery all giving NYR fans some real hope for the first time in over a decade. NYR beating NJ in 5 games in 1st round of 2008 playoffs, that was just sweet. Especially after them mopping the floor and sweeping us in 2006 (our 1st playoff series in 9 years). Henrik and the Rangers dominated this entire series, the famous Avery rule, Cally and Dubi just being relentless. The entire 2011-12 season was special, anyone who is around my age never saw a Ranger team have a season like that. The dominance of Hank, Dubi and Cally just having that fiery and emotional element to their game that all of us love, the rise of McDonagh, Gabby's beautiful goal scoring ability, Torts being that coach who you were proud of, and so many other things.   I'll go in depth for that season though. The Ottawa series was scary, we were down 3-2 and came back to win that series, it was relieving to get by the 1st round though. The first of many Game 7's the NYR would face in the next 4 seasons.   Specifically, game's 3, 5, and 7 of the Caps series. All unbelievable, the 3OT win in DC from Gabby, the amazing game 5 comeback and OT winner, then the intense/heart attack inducing game 7. I was at that game, and man I had never felt any emotion or anticipation the way I felt in when I walked through the halls of the concourse into the Garden. It was so amazing and unexplainable, I knew it was something special.   Again, the Caps series in 2013, I was also at game's 4 and 6 for that series. Game 4 was just so fun and amazing, the Rangers really put their footdown and successfully came back and won two home games to even the series after being down 2-0. Then game 6, facing elimination on mother's day, Henrik putting on an absolute show, Brassard's bomb from point, a narrow 1-0 win that had so many chances for both teams. You were so confident about the Rangers by that point though, you knew they wouldn't bow out without a fight at all. Obviously, that game 7 was just perfect to embarrass the Caps, and enjoy as an NYR fan. 2013-14 season, another one that will not be forgotten any time soon. Game 7 against the Flyers, that entire series was just so fun, minus game 6. Philly was lucky to be in it, the Rangers closed them out, always great to send Philly home.  The comeback against the Pens, that was something truly special and completely unexpected. I can understand being down 2-0 or 3-2 in a series, but I had ZERO hope after being down 3-1, I just didn't see it happening. The whole MSL thing was just special yet sad, but it was amazing to see the team pull together. Henrik putting on a show, so many different players and pieces that you loved just pulled off an incredible comeback that probably took another 5 years off your life.  Just dominating MTL, Henrik putting on a show, once again. I always hated the Habs, and man it was nice to finally end the curse and clearing out whatever ghosts we had going to Montreal. Game 6 was special, Dom Moore's goal, Hank being Hank. Obviously, the highlight is that game 4 OT goal from MSL, blew the roof off MSG. Our kids will be watching that highlight years down the road. This past season with the OT winners in game 4 and 5 against the Pens, just terrific, I love sending home and dominating teams that I hate in the playoffs. It's just so sweet to take out the Devils/Flyers/Pens/Caps in the playoffs. That Caps series, down 3-1 again, I had a glimmer of hope, but was essentially hopeless. No way they could pull it off in back to back years, right? But they did! McDonagh's OT winner in game 5 and Stepan's OT winner in game 7! Unreal! I could watch those all day.    I know there will be more to come, there truly is nothing like playoff hockey with the Rangers, especially at the Garden."

Hopefully he and Stepan can agree to a bridge deal instead of a 6 year thing as that will likely save us money in the short term but will also allow Stepans next contract to be even bigger...
rangers,3c11iy,dethside,2,Fri Jul 3 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is a shitty situation. I think if we can sign him for 5-6 years at 6.8 or less it's worth it as there are literally 0 other available potential top 2 centers on the market.

rangers,3c11iy,AoifeCheeks,2,Sat Jul 4 05:26:49 2015 UTC,I think Stepan deserves a good and solid contract; I think if you have something like 6-6.5/6-7 years is fair enough.
rangers,3c11iy,Itscominrightforus,3,Sat Jul 4 16:09:07 2015 UTC,If it was Sather he would penny pinch Stepan for another bridge deal and risk overpaying in a couple years or losing him in free agency. Hopefully Gorton offers around 6.5-7 for 6 years.
rangers,3c11iy,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Fri Jul 3 22:02:15 2015 UTC,Honestly at this point moving Klein and Glass should be a necessity and not just a hot take. Both are overpaid and Step is a far greater priority than keeping either of them.
rangers,3c11iy,blueshirtdave,2,Sun Jul 5 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"Respect your opinion but do you really think Klein is overpaid?  He's making 2.9 million a year, and is our lowest paid starting 6 defender.  Throughout the season he was frequently employed on the 2nd line, and finished 4th in the NHL Defensemen group for +/-.  Yes, we're paying our defense corp a lot, but we also finished 3rd in the NHL in goals allowed.    I've asked before but maybe it's worth asking again... when did we decide we wanted Klein gone, all of a sudden?  The guy has been our most reliable defender over the past two seasons, and has put up career highs in almost every category.  And all anyone could talk about until about a month ago was how happy we were that we locked him up at a relatively low salary for 5 years.  What happened?  Why on earth would we trade him away and go back to looking for another solid defender?    We never should've traded Strahlman, and trading Klein would be a mistake.  It's tough to find good right handed defenders, and he's a star making way less than a lot of other defenders who aren't as consistent.    Also, remember that if we trade him, that leaves us with the following right handed defenders (Girardi, Boyle, Diaz, and McIlrath.)  Girardi and Boyle are seemingly players that a lot of people want to be rid of ... Diaz is decent but he can't replace Klein's consistency or numbers, and McIlrath has yet to come up to the NHL and stay.  I just don't get why we want to trade him.    And yes, before anyone jumps all over me - I understand the salary cap - I just think that we can accomplish what we need to and keep him around.  I'm one of those people that thinks if we stick hard to what we want to pay Step, he'll take it."
rangers,3c11iy,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"He's making 2.9 million a year, and is our lowest paid starting 6 defender.      Yandle is making less and IMO I'd rather have Diaz or Hunwick (when he was making $600k)     Throughout the season he was frequently employed on the 2nd line, and finished 4th in the NHL Defensemen group for +/-     Yeah but being put on the second pairing doesn't necessarily imply that he's actually good. And +/- is a terrible stat for individual performance. In terms of possession stats he's negative relative to the rest of the team and considering that the Rangers this past season were a middling possession team that isn't good.     but we also finished 3rd in the NHL in goals allowed.     Hmm maybe that has something to do with our world-class goaltending and elite goalie coach     I've asked before but maybe it's worth asking again... when did we decide we wanted Klein gone, all of a sudden?     I can't speak for everyone but for me it was probably around the time I realized he's a terrible possession player. Puck possession is how you win championships in the modern NHL. If this was like 1993 I wouldn't be complaining about Klein's contract partially because of the lack of salary cap but also because his style of play probably would be a lot more at home back then.     The guy has been our most reliable defender over the past two seasons     Kinda hard to argue that when you look at his stats and hextally charts. Likewise if you look at certain aspects of his game (his skating, his ability to move the puck out of the zone, etc). I'm open to some evidence of him being reliable if you can provide any but I see a lot of people talking about Klein being ""reliable"" and I just don't really see any proof.     has put up career highs in almost every category     That might have to do with the fact that his shooting percentage was double his career average this season (and actually more than triple his career average from October to December). That's pretty unsustainable.     We never should've traded Strahlman, and trading Klein would be a mistake.It's tough to find good right handed defenders, and he's a star making way less than a lot of other defenders who aren't as consistent.     Hard to make that comparison when Stralman was pretty dominant in almost all aspects of his game. And I wouldn't really call him a star either.     Diaz is decent but he can't replace Klein's consistency or numbers     I posted this in another thread but Diaz got put into a similar role as Klein when he played in Montreal. Not exactly amazing stats but I'll take Diaz at $700k over Klein at $2.9M if their performance is that similar.    Edit: Haha love writing wordy, fact-checked argument only to be downvoted without a response :~) I forgot this sub is full of morons that don't believe in statistics."

rangers,3c11iy,spitfyer,3,Sun Jul 5 13:53:05 2015 UTC,no he's not
rangers,3c11iy,ncolaros,2,Sat Jul 4 04:03:56 2015 UTC,Compare him to the other Centers with his stats. He most certainly is.
rangers,3c11iy,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:50:30 2015 UTC,It's really sad that the majority of people don't realize the difference between being an RFA and being a UFA.
rangers,3c11iy,ncolaros,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"That really doesn't matter much in this situation at all. If we don't come to an agreement, he gets a bridge contract, and then he'll be an UFA and ask for more than what he's asking for now."
rangers,3c11iy,blueshirtdave,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"Which stats  are you looking at?  He's got a good scoring touch, and plays solidly on the PK.  He's also young!  However, he's abysmal at faceoffs (191st out of 255 in the league amongst Centers last year).  Also worth noting in that stat is that of the 63 Centers with a worse Faceoff % last year, only 13 of those played more games than Step did.  The bottom 30 or so played 25 games or fewer.    Is this just one stat?  Yes.  Is it a vitally important stat for Centers?  Absofreakinglutely.  It hurts my soul to think back on how situations we could've converted into goals if he had just simply won the faceoff.  He took 1232 total faceoffs last year (not including playoffs), which was good for 29th in the NHL.  He failed to win the faceoff 689 times, or 10 times a game that he played (68 games last year).    Now, naysayers may bring up that even Patrice Bergeron (60.2 Faceoff %, 1900+ total faceoffs), also averaged close to the same number of faceoff losses a game (9.58 to be exact).  The difference though is that he averaged 24 faceoffs a game, to step's 18.  So he won about 14 faceoffs a game, compared to Step's 8.  That's nearly twice the times Boston could start an offensive sequence compared to us with Step at center.  Despite those stats we still were a top 3 team in offensive production and defensive stats.  Just imagine where we'd be if Step hit even halfway between his number and Bergerons (about 52%).    Sorry for all the maths, I kind of dug into this further than anticipated.  I love Step, and think he brings a LOT to the team; worthy of a nice contract.  But not at 7 million+.  Not when he's horrible at a major stat for Centers."
rangers,3c11iy,ncolaros,2,Mon Jul 6 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"Well let's take a look at some other players who have similar or worse faceoff stats. Henrik Sedin (45%), Patrick Elias (39%, though he takes about en less faceoffs a game), Mike Ribiero (43%), Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (45%), and Evgeni Malkin (42.6%, though he takes 7-8 less faceoffs a game).   Evgeni Malkin is set to make $9.5 mil next year. Henrik Sedin is set to make $7 mil. Patrick Elias is set to make $5.5 mil. Mike Ribiero is set to make $3.5 mil, which is a steal for the stats he has. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is set to make $6 mil.   Now my point is all this is that centers in the NHL are generally not paid according to their faceoff stats. And yes, it is important, but I'll take a great player who's bad at faceoffs over a bad player who's good at faceoffs any day. Jim Slater had the second best FO% in the league last year, but he also only had 13 points. Antoine Vermette, a very good player by any standard, including faceoffs, is still not as good as Stepan. He's only going to make $3.75 next year, despite having great faceoff stats."
rangers,3c11iy,blueshirtdave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the discussion! I hear you, and agree in general that his offensive output justifies a high price. However, he's not an elite center - he's just not. He can score a ton but he sucks terribly at the most important thing a center does to start every sequence - a faceoff. It's like Sammy Sosa back in the day. He could laugh fastballs all day out of Wrigley but throw him something offspeed or slightly out of the zone and he'd fall over trying to hit it. He was unreliable for most of his career for that reason. Or you could say it's like Shaq. Deadly in and around paint but all you had to do was foul him and he can't make a simple free throw to save his life.  I know they're different sports but my point is I don't think we should pay him a nearly Rick Nash level salary if he struggles so much at a massively important stat.    Teams know it's his weakness, and that they can throw their best players out there to win the faceoff and create a scoring chance. That's why Moore takes almost every late game faceoff for us - we can't count on Step to win them. And if he's our #1 center, that's a problem."
rangers,3c11iy,ncolaros,2,Tue Jul 7 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"I still have to disagree. First of all, Shaq is one of the greatest centers of all time. He was league MVP. I don't think that's a good comparison at all. Second of all, I think you overrate how much a faceoff matters. Of course they're important, but they're not the most important thing a center does. If they were, Dom Moore would be a first line center, and Evgeni Malkin would be kicked out of the league.   Most goals in the NHL are not scored after a faceoff. The vast majority of the time, it comes after possession has already changed hands once or more than once, thus rendering the initial faceoff inconsequential."

rangers,3c11iy,blueshirtdave,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree he's an excellent scorer, but he's not a good faceoff guy. It all starts with the faceoff. If we don't win that and grab possession, we can't score."
rangers,3c11iy,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Tue Jul 7 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"The thing is, quite    a few    Examinations have been done re: faceoffs v possession and tbh the correlation seems overrated. Good teams can still regain possession even if they lose a faceoff. It's more important for a top centerman to be capable of producing points (which Step does) and driving possession (which Step would have done if he wasn't anchored with MSL)."

rangers,3c11iy,spitfyer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"Don't know what the difference is between per 60 and regular points but, as far as just points go he isn't close to any of those players lol sorry but you're definitely over valuing him, once again Brassard is a better center every way you look at it and is nowhere near that expensive, look around at the players making 7 plus mil, they are all number 1 centers, defenders, or wings, Step is a second line center at best"
rangers,3c11iy,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"Per 60 is literally points per 60 minutes. Here's another list of centers with at least 2000 minutes played since 2011-12. Step ranks 15th on that list, ahead of Steen, Thornton, Couture and Kopitar (three of which make at least $6M). Brassard is ranked at like 24th or something (the dude that posted the table mentioned that but I can't find his original table with a longer list). Not sure which ways you're talking about with Brass being better but as far as pure points production goes Step is definitely superior."

The only thing I can think of is that notion of, ""Hey, this guy got X amount and I should, too."" I'm not exactly familiar with signings/cap related things, so any input would be appreciated -- thanks.  But if that is indeed the case, it just seems a bit unfortunate that comparisons would be made to ROR's contract considering, well, I'm not sure what Buffalo's cap is at, but I imagine it's nowhere as tight as ours right now."
rangers,3c11iy,PeteSamp27,3,Fri Jul 3 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically Step's agent can say ""hey the market value for centers just went up, Stepan is arguably better than ROR so he deserves as much if not more than ROR."" Now, he probably won't get $7.5M or more, but he will be getting more than we all originally predicted."
rangers,3c11iy,DDB-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:14:38 2015 UTC,"If Stepan goes to arbitration this offseason and next offseason, O'reilly's new contract isn't admissible as a comparison because it does not cover any RFA years for O'reilly.

rangers,3c11iy,catlover16,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:12:34 2015 UTC,Ryan O'Reilly is getting paid more than other players of his talent because he's playing for a shitty team with a ton of cap space and an owner willing to spend.  The only thing similar is that we also have an owner willing to spend. If you want to keep together a good team you won't have a ton of cap space and hence players generally will sacrifice a little bit. I bet 6.5M AAV is where his contract ends up.

rangers,3c11iy,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:04:42 2015 UTC,it says Buffalo signed him for 7 years. but I think Andrew is saying that Stepan's agent might want the Rangers to pay him a similar contract because you may say they are similar players and Stepan should get a similar contract rather than a 4 to 5 year contract.  At least that's what I'm understanding.
rangers,3bzp4h,Jean-Paul_van_Sartre,15,Fri Jul 3 13:30:36 2015 UTC,Unleash. The. Lindberg. Finally! I'm very excited to see what he can do given a real chance at the NHL level.
rangers,3bzp4h,Sockittoum,8,Fri Jul 3 14:31:34 2015 UTC,So based on this article the lines will look like this?  Kreider - Steps - Hayes?  Zucc - Brass - Nash  Etem - Lindberg - Miller   Glass - Moore - Fast  Thoughts on this? Obviously we are getting way ahead of ourselves here but I thought Fast would slide higher up in the line up this season. There is no way Hayes fills a long term spot on the 4th line so I guess Fast plays on the 4th and picks up a ton of ice time on the PK?
rangers,3bzp4h,dethside,13,Fri Jul 3 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"It just seems like a total shame to have Fast on the fourth line. I remember when he was bumped up to third, but especially the second, he looked so much better. I actually thought he would be Marty's replacement, which would make the second line as Kreid - Step - Fast. I was thinking our lines could be:   Zucc - Brass - Nash  Kreid - Step - Fast/Hayes  Fast/Hayes - Moore - Miller  Etem - Lindberg - Glass"
rangers,3bzp4h,keetner,6,Fri Jul 3 15:55:32 2015 UTC,Agreed with Fast. I think Fast/Hayes/Miller/Etem will all rotate into the top 6 throughout the season until AV finds a combo that produces the best with Stepan and Kreider.
rangers,3bzp4h,RhynoSorceress,7,Fri Jul 3 16:21:15 2015 UTC,Can we just make Glass the healthy scratch in favor of Stalberg?
rangers,3bzp4h,Ralph_Baconader,4,Fri Jul 3 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Still hungover from the draft, and we're already in to sitting Glass. We're consistent!"
rangers,3bzp4h,fezzikola,2,Fri Jul 3 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"Thats what I do. I'd like to see the lines like this:  Nash-Brass-Zucc Kreids-Step-Miller Etem-Lindberg-Hayes Stalberg-Moore-Fast  Glass as the 13th forward. Those four lines are as good as any you'd see in the division, probably close to the Islanders in terms of depth. It sucks having Fast on the 4th line but AV always rolls all 4. Not to mention if Stalberg can channel his inner 2011-12 and show his skill, its not like Fast will be playing with a bunch of dead weight. I dont expect Stalberg to produce 20 but I think we can expect him to add skill to a 4th line. Unfortunately AV has made his love for Glass clear so we're bound to get a repeat of last year with Glass constantly getting minutes and bringing Moore and Fast's production down."
rangers,3bzp4h,TBlueshirtsV22,2,Fri Jul 3 19:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think Fast's playing style works better for the 4th line than Etem's though. Fast probably looked better on other lines because he wasn't being dragged down by Glass. Swapping Glass for Stalberg would solve that issue and give us a nice, fast-skating 4th line that's also defensively responsible. And idk I think Lindberg potentially has more up side as a 3rd line center than Moore."
rangers,3bzp4h,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Fri Jul 3 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"Fast -- yeah, that's actually a really good point.   Yeah, I'm kind of inclined to agree with Lindberg and Moore. Of the times Moore has been bumped up to third (and occasionally the second, I think) I always felt like he looked better on the fourth, just given the way he plays. But I figured with his experience, it would be better to let Lindberg start on the fourth and eventually work up to the third.   It also seems like we've forgotten about Shep...damn. Any thoughts on him? I was hoping he'd stay with us (I wish he had been given more playing time + liked what I saw from him in the Playoffs) but given the guys we've recently signed, I wonder what might happen with him."
rangers,3bzp4h,keetner,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"I love Dom Moore. Definitely one of my favorite guys on the team. He can play a 3C if need be, but I feel like Lindberg will end up there given his talent level. Maybe you're right about him starting on the 4th.    As for Shep, I liked him this season honestly, but I just don't really see where he fits in. If things go well our 4th line ends up being Stalberg - Moore - Fast and I just don't see him beating any of those guys for a roster spot. Obviously this is an ideal scenario and I could be wrong about the lineup but still."

rangers,3c1091,Calad,3,Fri Jul 3 20:33:42 2015 UTC,UFA contracts cannot be considered in arbitration cases
rangers,3c1091,poot_on_newt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:40:04 2015 UTC,The monetary terms aren't allowed to be used for basis of contracts in arbitration. In meetings between agents and general managers that is exactly what they are talking about. When they aren't in an arbitration hearing they can use whatever contracts they want to consider comparable.  I was commenting on the first part of the guys comment. The 2nd part doesn't really make sense because it seems that he was implying that Stepan would ask for arbitration rights as well as a NMC/NTC in his contract when the arbitration rights are automatic after 4 yrs of play.

MSL is also going to always be remembered for turning the puck over on a 5-on-3 PP leading to a shorthanded goal.

rangers,3bw7d7,plastictf,25,Thu Jul 2 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"Posted this to the /hockey thread when he was first rumored to trade  I've been a huge fan of Marty my whole life. Growing up, watching the Catamounts, and knowing that Marty used to be one made a huge impression on me as a player and a new fan of the sport. After meeting him at the Gutt while he was still a Flame and him being the nicest guy was such an impact, and then when he brought the cup to Burlington in '04 and remembered my name, that's when I turned die hard.   I remember asking my Dad how likely it was for Marty to be a Ranger, he just shook his head and chuckled. He said something about how he'll be a Tampa Bay lifer, and I got kinda bummed, but understood. I would watch TB games just to see him whiz around, almost a full foot shorter than the rest of the players. He allowed me to realize that my height wasn't as much of a disadvantage as I thought, and although I never made it close to anything past a few recreational games a year after high school, it showed me that it also wasn't a garunteed ""no, you're too short.""   My dad called me early in the morning a few years ago with the rumors about Marty wanting to be a Ranger, and my heart skipped a beat. No way could this happen, my inner 8-year-old was freaking out. My life-long favorite player on my favorite team? Better than Christmas. I didn't care about his age, only that there could be a St. Louis blueshirt.   Then the trade happened, and although we lost a captain, I was jumping up and down at work trying to make my co-workers understand how important this was to me. I called my dad and he just laughed, reminding me of the times I would wish he was a Ranger.   I'm sure at least some of you know this feeling, watching a player you idolize sign to your team, which makes this that much more bittersweet.   I 100% understand why my fellow fans are disappointed with his performance this past year, especially after coming off so clutch the year before. I had doubts, as did all of you, on how he would fit in our lines. I cursed a few dozen times when he would miss a golden opportunity, or during a terrible giveaway.   However, he never stopped being my favorite, and I never stopped believing in his game. Still, to this day, I am anything but disappointed in him.   He's still my hero. He's still the reason I continue to play, the reason I was comfortable playing in the first place. Not only is he a great player with a cup and a gold, he's a fantastic role model with 3 Lady Byngs.   I'll always be proud to wear my St. Louis jersey, no matter what anyone says. I'm so crushed to see him go. My heart feels broken, and a cup without Marty would be, to me, the most delicious cake without icing. Rather selfishly, I'd rather see him retire right now than become anything else, especially if he signs with a rival, but he'll still be my favorite and I wish him the absolute best with whoever is lucky enough to get him. I think two years is far too short, although most disagree. It would be just my goddamn luck to see him annihilate on his next squad, and I will never let any fellow Rangers fan forget which side I'll always take. I'm a blueshirt for life, but also Martin St. Louis' #1 fan.   I'm going to go drink myself to sleep now. I'm going to miss you, Marty.    welp, now I won't be haunted by the thought of Marty in a Pens/Devs jersey, and with Stalberg signed we can keep the Catamount alumni game strong. LGR"

rangers,3bw7d7,irishdude1212,2,Thu Jul 2 18:33:39 2015 UTC,I remember he tried previously to score on Tokarski throughout that game and the series (I think all top shelf) and he finally got it when it counts.

We got away from the Torts system and Callahan's potentially massive cap hit. He was integral in getting us us to the Cup final and got our young guys and Nash some deep playoff experience. I'm glad he ended as a ranger.
rangers,3bw7d7,irishdude1212,8,Thu Jul 2 18:01:09 2015 UTC,What is a cap hit?
rangers,3bw7d7,saintstryfe,9,Thu Jul 2 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"So since you got down-voted instead of an explanation, ill tell you with my crude knowledge. Every team has a cap limit for salaries. Every player salary contributes to this. Callahan was being paid a lot which means we had to pay other players less or get worse player because we couldn't afford the good ones  If im wrong someone correct me"
rangers,3bw7d7,joliedame,5,Thu Jul 2 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Callahan was in the last year of his contract and was asking for big money, and thus a big cap hit, for his next contract. Management decided that they wouldn't be able to or wouldn't want to re-sign him in the off season, so rather than let him walk and get nothing in return they made the trade for St. Louis."

Would they still have the same if not better success if they never made that trade? Who knows for sure but Marty's play against Pittsburgh and Montreal in the playoffs was a key why they became Eastern Conference Champions and made them the team to beat in the east.   Years from now Marty is going to remembered as a Tampa Bay Lightning, obviously. however he'll be one of those short term Rangers (no pun intended) who in his short time here was well liked, and was productive. I'll think of him like Brendan Shanahan, Martin Straka, even Gretzky, guys who towards the end of their NHL careers joined the Rangers and were pretty productive."

rangers,3bw7d7,Boof-Bubba-Dale,2,Fri Jul 3 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. I wasn't quite expecting this just because of the rumours of him wanting to continue to play + possibly end up elsewhere in the Metro. I'm a little sad because I'd love for him to try at it for even another year or so, but at the same time, I'm glad he did it as a Ranger.   I've actually been thinking about this in the past few days. I've gotten questions from friends who follow other teams if I regret the whole Cally/Marty trade given his rocky season with us + the fact that we never seem to have first round picks anymore, heh. I mean, I get that this draft was incredibly deep this year but I think I find a bit of solace knowing that our team was and is good enough to (hopefully) not be affected by it too much. Versus, say if you're a rebuilding team, then yes, having that first rounder would be incredibly valuable.   So looking at it retrospectively, even though it would have been great to have that pick (and to be completely fair, it was conditional, so I think once we made it out of the Pens series, we definitely got some heads turning), if we had the opportunity to make the trade again...honestly, I probably would. This isn't to rip on Cally or anything, but I think Marty coming here really changed and pushed this team to a different mindset + direction. I mean, there were probably a multitude of things affecting that as well (eg. AV) but still. Just knowing that our guys had the opportunity to have this amazing run with him for a chance to hoist that Cup...I don't think I could trade that experience away.  Thank you, Marty."

He’s the best teammate I’ve ever played with, without a doubt. It’s easy to say that. Not taking anything away from all of the amazing players and people that I’ve been fortunate enough to play with in my career, but Marty is one of a kind. He’s as character of a guy as you’ll ever meet, on and off the ice, and just kind of brought passion to his game every day (with) the way he approached it. I learned a lot from him, and (will) look back on playing with him as some of the best moments of my career.”  This fucking guy; such a stand up guy... Who never fails to make me feel feels."

rangers,3bwzfb,tj_sad_boi_666,11,Thu Jul 2 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"He really is. Everyone says hes amazing. He is a career 20 goal scorer, he is not going to propel them. Oshie doesn't show up in the playoffs and has 14 points in his career in the playoffs (so does Backes). Nash had 14 this season, and we gave him that much shit for ""not showing up""."
rangers,3bwzfb,bonesingyre,3,Thu Jul 2 23:41:29 2015 UTC,He is garbage.
rangers,3bwzfb,thebabybananagrabber,14,Fri Jul 3 01:23:10 2015 UTC,"Guys, Oshie's only broken the 20 goal mark once in his career and Brouwer has done it three times. Oshie also comes at a much higher price, which will limit what the Caps can do with their remaining cap space. If you look past his shootout performance in the Olympics, you realize that this wasn't nearly as good of a trade for the Caps as people think it is."
rangers,3bwzfb,DontTestTheUser,10,Thu Jul 2 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"He's still a 55-60 point player when healthy, throws the body around extremely well, and still comes at a relatively good cap hit. 4 million for  player like Oshie isn't bad with what guys have been getting paid this summer. They also still have 15mill to do business with."
rangers,3bwzfb,Itscominrightforus,7,Thu Jul 2 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"Good points, but I still think Brouwer is better and comes at a cheaper price. Oshie is good, but this trade is being way more overblown than it should be."

rangers,3bwzfb,BadSeedling,9,Thu Jul 2 22:10:36 2015 UTC,How did they get TJ for just that? This sucks for us. We have to hope Miller or Fast can step up and play a second line wing consistently or we'll have downgraded from last year
rangers,3bwzfb,ncolaros,2,Thu Jul 2 21:12:41 2015 UTC,I'm 100% positive both Fast and Miller will make large contributions to our team. They played well this season and now get to shake off their rookie rust.

I've been an avid fan since 94-95 when I came to America, I even fully bought into this team during the late 90's even though I was obsessed with Detroits Fab 5.  I love this team, I've always been a New Yorker, and for whats it worth I will die bleeding blue. I want this team to be successful, but it seems to me we are slowly digressing to become the islanders of the 2000's. I don't want us to be that team in the Metro. Meanwhile, Caps, Pens, Islanders, CBJ all seem like a legit threat to us now.

Last year they were a big, strong, hardworking, heavy forechecking team with the skill guys (Ovie, Backstrom, Green) sprinkled in.  This offseason has seen them lose three of their most important role players in Ward, Brouwer and Fehr plus their most dangerous defensemen.

Lindros was nearly a point per game player in his first year here - plus he stayed healthy all season.   Bure had ridiculous numbers here - just never stayed healthy.   I hated Gomez - right until Sather turned him into McDonagh.   Holik and Redden were clunkers, Drury was decent (just not at his contract.)   TL;DR - Over the course of 15 seasons, any GM would have blemishes and regrets. Sather never stopped tinkering and always knew when he made mistakes."

The guy was a disaster here for the most part and the recent qualified success came at the cost of our farm system and cap. Gorton will have his work cut out for him restocking the system and resigning our RFAs this year and next
rangers,3bw3sr,dethside,5,Thu Jul 2 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"Stepan's contract won't be signed until around training camp starts, considering his and his agent's negotiation tactics and history. We'll see the other RFAs trickle in throughout the next month"
rangers,3bw3sr,Calad,3,Thu Jul 2 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"I think Larry has been writing that Fast, Miller, and Etem will play for their qualifying offers, which all sit around 850k. I think it'd be kinda dumb to not give them bridge deals, but then again I'm not an NHL GM, so what do I know?  I've also been seeing Step for 6x6, which in all honesty is fair value for him, considering him and McD are the centerpieces of our core."
rangers,3bw3sr,PaulSach,3,Thu Jul 2 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"I'm all for getting guys on the cheap but it seems like 850k is short-changing Fast and Miller after this season/post-season, no? (And maybe also for Etem, just don't really know anything about him)"
rangers,3bw3sr,Frank_The_Unicorn,8,Thu Jul 2 18:06:02 2015 UTC,I think the idea is to save as much cap room as possible this year. The following season we have a lot of wiggle room with cap space freeing up
rangers,3bw3sr,broadwayschmo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure who downvoted you, even losing Boyles cap hit alone will free up 4.5 mil in cap space, we can easily get a bottom pairing D for ~1 mil to replace him"
rangers,3bw3sr,Ralph_Baconader,2,Thu Jul 2 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's just what their qualifying offers are valued at. They can sign for more, but if they feel they're not going to get a better deal, they can sign that for 1 year, instead. JT and Fast are deserving of true bridge deals, not sure about Etem, but he probably is, too. We have around 10 mil to fiddle with right now, ~6 of which is going to Stepan. That leaves about 4 to lock up those other 3, which I could see as totally doable."

rangers,3brywo,ShittyForeplay,32,Wed Jul 1 17:48:15 2015 UTC,"Sather really picked his shit up in the last couple years, I will miss him despite some shaky moves in the past.  I hope Gorton has a taste for cigars..."
rangers,3brywo,WilsonKingOfPrussia,19,Wed Jul 1 17:52:55 2015 UTC,I blame Dolan for the pre-2009 Rangers.  Those teams had his greasy fingerprints on them.  Seemed like he finally lost interest in hockey so he could focus on destroying the Knicks as his full-time endeavor...
rangers,3brywo,PhilipK_Dick,11,Wed Jul 1 19:25:22 2015 UTC,I'm two handshakes away from one of the MSG TV personalities you watch on a nightly basis.  What I was told was that Sather genuinely had no idea why the first half of his tenure wasn't working out.  There was a come-to-Jesus moment during the 2005 lockout that you can't buy a championship.
rangers,3brywo,hypnofed,6,Wed Jul 1 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"2001-02 was going great until Fluery had a long melt down and the team fell apart. But the Kovalev and Bure moves were way too risky, but the trade for Jagr was looking the same way until he lit the league on fire after the lockout."
rangers,3brywo,idontlikeketchup,3,Wed Jul 1 20:52:43 2015 UTC,"I think that pre-lockout, Sather actually got it right with Bure.  We'd have had very different fortunes if not for the NJD assassination.  JJ is an interesting case.  I know a sports journalist in the Czech Republic who covers a lot of Czech players.  Apparently JJ was the one who initiated trade talk.  Sather had realized that signing magastars wasn't the way to go, but JJ kicked everything off through his agent."
rangers,3brywo,hypnofed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:03:26 2015 UTC,What is the NJD assassination?
rangers,3brywo,boobiesucker,3,Thu Jul 2 12:06:12 2015 UTC,A Devils prospect dove at Pavel Bure's knees during preseason hoping to impress Lamoriello and ended his career.
rangers,3brywo,hypnofed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:12:24 2015 UTC,"And that same prospect, Mike Danton, ended up hiring a hitman on his agent, David Frost. The scheme failed and he ended up jail for almost five years."
rangers,3brywo,captars,12,Mon Jul 6 13:01:27 2015 UTC,That's probably one of the things Slats was training him in. Cigar appreciation.
rangers,3brywo,aereuske,11,Wed Jul 1 17:53:37 2015 UTC,There's always time for one last signing!
rangers,3brywo,WilsonKingOfPrussia,0,Wed Jul 1 18:02:01 2015 UTC,... in the past.  Like last week?
rangers,3brywo,Enzo95,10,Wed Jul 1 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"We clearly weren't going to re-sign Hags or Cam and Slats got what he could for them.  I'm gonna miss Swagelin, no question.  But he was just too expensive for us.  And I think getting a first round pick for Cambot was completely unrealistic.  I won't deny that Slats has made some very questionable decisions, but few GMs are on point all the time.  Needless to say, I'm very excited to see what Gorton can do with full discretion."
rangers,3brywo,WilsonKingOfPrussia,2,Wed Jul 1 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for Gorton too, he's been a huge part of our success over the last seasons.   I dunno if a 1st pick (from the Oilers) was realistic, but the return we got on Talbot was meh. We lost in this trade.   At least for Hagelin we got a decent player in return. Let's wait to see."
rangers,3brywo,Enzo95,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:19:16 2015 UTC,We did better than most of the goalie trades. Everyone keeps overlooking Talbot's contract situation going into the trade.
rangers,3brywo,jman2476,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:23:38 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate on the contract situation?
rangers,3brywo,aereuske,2,Wed Jul 1 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"Not much to elaborate on, but despite the fact that Talbot was probably the most promising goalie, he's an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2016-2017 season, which makes him much less appealing than Jones.   Edit: fuck it, to elaborate: as an RFA the Sharks get a hell of a lot more control over their future with Jones. If Talbot suddenly emerges as a top ten goalie he could easily be getting a bunch of offer sheets. That's not an issue for Edmonton, where the cap will be pretty wide open, but it is an issue for a lot of the teams that are just trying to fit in a decent goaltending situation."
rangers,3brywo,saintstryfe,2,Thu Jul 2 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that Henrik Lundqvist is the definition of a workhorse goalie who would TOTALLY start back to backs if AV let him. Cambot was really a starting caliber goalie last season in a backup role for most of it. We picked up another solid backup goalie to replace him and we gained, what? A net of two draft picks? (Or one after the Raanta trade?) I'm all over this."
rangers,3brywo,Enzo95,2,Thu Jul 2 05:21:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah as far as I can tell from what has been revealed publicly, we missed out on the best deal because of Talbot's contract, we turned down Florida's offer because it didn't suit our cap situation, and then went with Edmonton because it gave us a lot of dice to roll in development. The goalies traded after Talbot got much worse deals, so our decision only looks bad if you're imagining trades that weren't on the table."
rangers,3brywo,77Columbus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"I think you overlook the most important part of the Talbot trade: he isn't in the East. We might have gotten more from Pittsburgh or Boston, but we might have to face him then. I'd much rather get what we got and not have to deal with him more than twice a season, maybe."
rangers,3brywo,patrickhoagland,2,Wed Jul 1 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the silver lining of the trade. See the Leafs? Got raped by the penguins and kept Kessel in the east. Fuck'em."
rangers,3brywo,notaheadache,22,Wed Jul 1 20:56:39 2015 UTC,This is may be the last great move by Slats.
rangers,3brywo,BrutalJones,15,Wed Jul 1 18:10:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the years Slats!
rangers,3brywo,SMIRTLE,29,Wed Jul 1 17:53:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the years after 2009 Slats!   FTFY
rangers,3brywo,guyzieman,10,Wed Jul 1 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely the right move. Gorton and Gordie Clark are our best assets in the front office, and we would have risked losing Gorton if we hadn't given him the position this offseason."
rangers,3brywo,guninmouth,11,Wed Jul 1 18:13:34 2015 UTC,Gordon is also an exceptional drafter and Im very happy to have him as a GM.  Edit: this is also the guy that traded Raycroft for Rask during his time with the Bruins.
rangers,3brywo,sutsu,16,Wed Jul 1 18:11:45 2015 UTC,Jeff Gordon really knows how to work the draft
rangers,3brywo,aereuske,6,Wed Jul 1 18:13:58 2015 UTC,He's been known to make a few inside moves.
rangers,3brywo,DicNavis,2,Wed Jul 1 19:02:27 2015 UTC,Never afraid to bump and run to get where he's gotta go.
rangers,3brywo,kthoag,2,Thu Jul 2 00:46:17 2015 UTC,Something something racing pun.
rangers,3brywo,nothingsound14,3,Thu Jul 2 05:22:36 2015 UTC,This was perfect timing.  Remove the training wheels just AFTER the draft so he can get a full season under his belt before the next one.  That way you can make sure he doesn't go full Sweeney on us.
rangers,3brywo,phnxldr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:34:22 2015 UTC,I was mad about Slats not stepping down immediately after we lost but your post swayed me. Thanks!

The recent years have been good but there were a lot of terrible years and a lot of draft picks kind of just thrown away."
rangers,3brywo,josephnicklo,9,Thu Jul 2 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"Worth pointing out that Slats somehow offloaded that terrible Gomez contract while getting our current captain, McDonagh, in the process."
rangers,3brywo,nyg1,3,Thu Jul 2 01:12:21 2015 UTC,"Minus the Brad Richards part. He was going to sign with the Flames for more money if he didn't come to NY. We did what any team would do, go after an at-the-time elite center and best available UFA. That wasn't a bad contract, Brad just turned out to play at about 3/5 the level he was expected to play. It happens. Anyway, I love this."

rangers,3bs7tw,tj_sad_boi_666,9,Wed Jul 1 21:50:29 2015 UTC,"So I saw him as an older Hagelin-lite type, speed with stone hands, but I've been comparing their numbers. I decided to use their past four seasons combined to get a better sample size. Stalberg has a better P/60, higher CF% (barely), his PDO is under 100 so I wouldn't expect a major regression (Hagelin at 101.56 is fairly high). He's got a lower FA60, a lower SCA60, and a higher SC% and SC%Rel. Their offensive zone stats are roughly the same. Basically, Stalberg has been better than Hagelin in basically every major category over the past four years. Now, he's older at 29, so he could be dropping off a bit. He only played 25 games in the nhl last season, so comparisons are tough, but he still did better than Hagelin in all these categories."
rangers,3bs7tw,serfis,3,Wed Jul 1 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"This is encouraging to hear. Hags' only had 36 points last year. Could Stahlberg approach that number? Absolutely. I don't see him surpassing it, but crazier things have happened."
rangers,3bs7tw,ArsenalAM,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:20:49 2015 UTC,He could come close. I believe he's a career 0.5 per game player.

rangers,3bs7tw,ncolaros,3,Wed Jul 1 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Preds fan here - I watched him in Milwaukee in the AHL for most of the season - No he does not kill penalties! He can fly on the ice though and really has a nose for scoring the puck...when he wants to. That was the toughest thing with him, his drive."
rangers,3bs7tw,Nashwaukee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look like he's been used in that role, but I could see him fitting into it under our coaching staff. If that happens, I wouldn't expect him to be as good as Hags, and I'd expect some early struggles, but it could work."
rangers,3bs7tw,serfis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:57:47 2015 UTC,I would compare him more to Kreider. His speed is great for someone as big as him.  Should be great for our third line provided Etem is gonna be taking on a second line role.
rangers,3bs7tw,zombiexsp,2,Thu Jul 2 02:23:32 2015 UTC,There's no way that Etem plays on the second line
rangers,3bs7tw,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:51:55 2015 UTC,I second this^   Etem will be on the third line.
rangers,3bs7tw,bkeschhh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:20:00 2015 UTC,I don't see why he won't to be honest. I think Hayes/Miller/Fast/Etem will all rotate in and out of the top 6.
rangers,3bs7tw,RhynoSorceress,7,Thu Jul 2 17:31:49 2015 UTC,Well I like it.
rangers,3bs7tw,SteamHole,8,Wed Jul 1 18:58:23 2015 UTC,Reminds me almost of the Stempniak signing last year. Good guy to add needed 3rd or 4th line depth.
rangers,3bs7tw,TBlueshirtsV22,2,Wed Jul 1 19:01:20 2015 UTC,Arguably fits into our system better than Stempniak did.

rangers,3bs7tw,5cotland,6,Wed Jul 1 18:58:27 2015 UTC,1.1 mill.
rangers,3bs7tw,Sockittoum,5,Wed Jul 1 18:56:32 2015 UTC,Why not Zoidberg?  (someone apparently edited his wiki page......)
rangers,3bs7tw,fosiacat,5,Wed Jul 1 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, this isn't the greatest FA class anyway, Matt Belesky is the most sought after Forward and he's probably going to get 7 years. Slim pickings for everyone.  He'll be an ok bottom 6 addition, nothing more probably."
rangers,3bs7tw,guyzieman,5,Wed Jul 1 18:56:36 2015 UTC,A bottom 6 addition that will likely see very little-to-no playing time. I don't really see the merit in signing him unless Shep wanted more $ than he's worth.
rangers,3bs7tw,Mats_Zuccarello,3,Wed Jul 1 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"I won't say little-to-none, he does have size and has scored 22 goals in the past (not that I expect him to come close this year). He'll get as fair a shot as anyone in camp."
rangers,3bs7tw,guyzieman,3,Wed Jul 1 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"So at this point, what kind of players are we still looking to sign? And after that's all done with, how much do you think we'd have left to resign some of our RFAs? I'm worried about how tight our cap might be getting...  (P.S. If any Preds fans come across this, feel free to give us your two cents on Stahlberg!)"
rangers,3bs7tw,keetner,5,Wed Jul 1 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"We're pretty much only looking at re-signing our guys and bringing in depth. Stahlberg is fine. He's okay. He's big and he's had good seasons. He's a bottom 6 guy, and that's totally fine. He came cheap, so I like the signing. But unless we make any significant trades, these are the guys we're looking at."
rangers,3bs7tw,ncolaros,2,Wed Jul 1 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"After this signing, the Rangers really only need a 13th forward (unless that is what you consider Stalberg, in which case they need a 3rd/4th line guy). Now a trade of Klein/Yandle or an issue resigning one of the RFAs could change that, but things at this point seem pretty much set."
rangers,3bs7tw,Dont_know_where_i_am,2,Wed Jul 1 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Howdy - Preds fan here living in Milwaukee (where their AHL team is located) and watched Stalberg down here most of the season. The guy is SUPER talented. Is fast, a good skater, and a goal scorer. The problem with him, is his drive and will. He sometimes takes shifts off, and doesn't seem all that intense sometimes. Really a victim of Trotz's system and massive forward depth in our organization.   Also - you guys are getting a steal in Magnus Hellberg. TALL, smart, a GREAT guy. Treat him well."
rangers,3bs7tw,Nashwaukee,2,Thu Jul 2 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Cool, I went to UVM with him. My history professor says he's an idiot though...guess that doesn't affect hockey skills."

rangers,3bs7tw,ajpod,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"I like this signing. His potential is only about a half point per game at best, but it's good depth for the team, especially since he's on the 4th line. His scoring did trail off when he went to Nashville, but they were still playing under the Trotz system. And even though he didn't play too many games in Nashville this year, his scoring did seem to rebound somewhat under their new system"
rangers,3bs7tw,MakeItNashty61,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:34:23 2015 UTC,He's an affordable 3rd to 4th line forward with speed that played for a good team last year and fits our system pretty well. I see him sticking on the 4th line with Fast and potentially playing on the PK. For 1.1 Mill. and our Cap situation not sure there is much to hate there.
rangers,3bs7tw,Enzo95,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:50:55 2015 UTC,I like it. Specially because we can call him Shhtahlberg.  /r/shubreddit
rangers,3bs7tw,bu77munch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:58:24 2015 UTC,I like him. Arcobello went for the same and I had my eye on him the way he played against the Rangers stood out to me

rangers,3btvpw,berkley1217,10,Thu Jul 2 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people saying ""metro is getting better except for Rangers! Lol!!!""  I don't get it. Going from Talbot to Raanta is better than a wash due to cap hit. Hagelin is replaced by Fast, basically mini-Hags. Add Etem, essentially JT Miller 2. Stalberg is a great 4th line addition. Yandle for a full year. I just...I don't see the drop off that everyone else is, I guess. And MSL, he was sub-replacement level from before the playoffs.   I don't see Justin Williams as much better than Joel Ward. I don't believe Saad is an elite-level player. He's good but not a game changer. Kessel to Pitt, well, that's becoming a very top heavy team. The top is good, no doubt, but they have room for nothing but garbage on the 3rd and 4th line. It has regular season champs, playoff bust written all over it."
rangers,3btvpw,brother_of_menelaus,7,Thu Jul 2 03:23:05 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. That said, it took until after we won the Presidents Trophy for more or less anyone to acknowledge that we were a good team. And everyone before last season said we wouldn't be any good this past year--that we couldn't live up to the 13-14 playoff run. And then we had the best season on record. Sure, we may not have the best record in the NHL next season, we may not be adding a huge name player, but I think we have plenty of guys that are big enough deals that the likes of Justin Williams or Phil Kessel to a pretty broken Pitt team means we'll be knocked out of contention in the Metro. We have Lundqvist. We have Nash. And slightly below that, we have Kreider and Hayes. And the rest of the guys dont suck either. And Zucc and his beautiful hair will just have to take over for Hags. #TannerGlassForConnSmythe2016"
rangers,3btvpw,Frank_The_Unicorn,3,Thu Jul 2 03:55:37 2015 UTC,People just have a hard-on for hating on anything relating to New York City. You would do yourself an enormous favor by ignoring the opinions of other fans on the talent level of the Rangers.
rangers,3btvpw,poot_on_newt,5,Thu Jul 2 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"At least from what I saw last year + signings/trades thus far, I'm honestly the most worried about CBJ. When they were healthy near the end of the year, their run was absolutely insane (what, 10/11 wins? I actually think we were the one who broke that streak, heh). Assuming they're healthy + with the addition of Saad...ergh, they're looking pretty scary. Not to say Pens and Caps won't be good teams, but, I dunno. I just feel like CBJ might be the team that is a bit more well put together so far. But again, it's probably still way too early to really tell.   With all of that said, the thing I find interesting is how the tables seem to be ""flipping"" within the divisions, just in the sense that, a lot of the lower ranked teams are doing much better now. I mean, I guess that's what years of rebuilding/getting solid picks and all that might do + it might just be the nature of having the cap, but it's still pretty interesting to witness it kind of happen."

rangers,3btvpw,Mats_Zuccarello,2,Thu Jul 2 02:54:40 2015 UTC,Nervous? No. But it's going to be a hell of a battle next year that's for sure.
rangers,3btvpw,Sockittoum,2,Thu Jul 2 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"The only team I'm worried about is CBJ.  If they're healthy, I think they're a serious Eastern Conference contender with Saad in the lineup."
rangers,3btvpw,THEDoughBOI,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:32:13 2015 UTC,"Hell, even without Saad. They were so devastated by injuries last year, it's impossible to tell what they really could've been. Imo, if they hadn't been so injured last season, I think they make the playoffs."
rangers,3btvpw,PaulSach,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:00:55 2015 UTC,"No question they were a playoff team last year if half their lineup wasn't hurt.  That's why I think the Saad addition makes them a conference contender.  Hell, I'd even call them a legit contender for the Cup this year."
rangers,3btvpw,THEDoughBOI,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"The only concern they really have over there is defense, imo."
rangers,3btvpw,PaulSach,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think Philly is going to look completely different next season as well. Emery really isn't an NHL caliber goalie, so Mason's injuries really derailed their season last year. This is the team with Voracek, Giroux, Streit, Simmonds, Schenn... basically everyone in the Metro is going to be neck and neck. Plus the Islanders are young as hell. It's fun being a super threatening, competitive division for once though."
rangers,3btvpw,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"Williams won't make much of an impact, honestly. He's getting old and won't get many minutes. I wouldn't be worried about it."
rangers,3btvpw,dovakinda,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:01:14 2015 UTC,I guess we just have to beat the Washington Ovechkins in 5 games next year:)   Not concerned-- we have a good team and we have depth. It will be fun to watch. We will find a way.
rangers,3btvpw,PaulSach,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I think the division remains status quo, for the most part. CBJ should certainly be better though, and Pitt became a dangerous, though top heavy, team, but they've always been dangerous. The Isles have done nothing to get worse, and neither have the Devils, Flyers, or Canes. The Caps will be interesting, because I think adding Williams/losing Ward is basically a wash, but losing Mike Green could hurt - he was one of their better dmen, but was just on a bad contract. They do have a strong goal tender in Holtby, though, so they should remain competitive.   If you really think about it, not too much has changed, and I think the boys should be able to remain competitive in the Division. Going into last season, just about every team had the ability to be competitive, but injuries happen, depth shows itself, and the game just kinda plays. Really hard to predict what can happen year in and year out."
rangers,3btvpw,FLRangerFan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:17:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about the Pens. Their stuck in their old ways of grabbing superstars, yet they will have absolutely no depth. Once we shut down the Crosby and Malkin line, they have nothing."
rangers,3btvpw,MakeItNashty61,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:56:39 2015 UTC,Pens are 1 injury away from one of their big guys from being a joke. Columbus yes. Washington is always tough but they lost some guys too.
rangers,3btvpw,ptvnsux94,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah Kessel went to the Pens but they have no depth, so if you can shut down that top line you are fine. The Caps got Oshie and Williams, Oshie is pretty overrated and Williams is only scary if we play the Caps in another game 7. Saad to CBJ is probably the worst because he is a winner and CBJ has a lot of talent but Saad is still young and has only won with that amazing cast he had around him in Chicago. It might not work for him in Columbus. Let's remember that the Devils and Canes are still pretty bad the Flyers still have Flyers goaltending and fuck the Islanders. The Rangers will be fine next year and they have enough to compete with all these teams. Is it October yet?"

rangers,3brlb3,berdman11,3,Wed Jul 1 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"Explain, every time Hunwick was on the ice I got scared the other team would score, I don't feel the same way with Klein at all"
rangers,3brlb3,Serrathen,2,Wed Jul 1 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"Hunwick improved as the season went on and was a solid 6D man towards the end of the year. Klein might be better than Hunwick, but I think it's close. Klein certainly isn't $2 million better. And Klein over performed last year - we need to sell high on him now. No chance he has as many points as last year. I'd rather have Hunwick (now Diaz who we just signed) and Semin over Klein."
rangers,3brlb3,berdman11,0,Wed Jul 1 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Klein IS clearly $2 million better. Klein scored the 2nd most pts on D behind McDonagh. His +/- was 3rd highest on the whole team. His shot pct. was an 11.8% which is insane for a defenseman who doesn't even get PP time (McDonaghs the closest with 5.8%)  All the stats point to Klein being a top 2 D pairing guy on any team. And if you watch him, you realize he's an insanely talented shutdown defender.  Hunwick was the 7th defenseman the entire year when there were no injuries to other players. Klein is worth about $3.5mil more than Hunwick."

There's no way he's going to shoot 11.8% again. That's entirely luck and not anything he's doing differently from others. It's actually a bad thing when talking about how good he actually is.    All the stats point to Klein being a top 2 D pairing guy on any team. And if you watch him, you realize he's an insanely talented shutdown defender.   Literally none of the stats point to that. He's nowhere near a top pairing guy. And When I watch him I see a slow lumbering defenseman who's often out of position and can't move the puck."

rangers,3brlb3,berdman11,-4,Thu Jul 2 13:24:42 2015 UTC,"Klein isn't good. Just look at the advanced stats. And his shooting percentage will not even come close to what it was last year. Last year was a fluke. Hunwicks advanced stats were much better than Kleins  Edit: Does anyone actually know what Kleins shooting percentage was? 14%. Nick Lidstroms was 5% for his whole career. So when Klein scores three goals next season, now you know why"
rangers,3brlb3,Sailor_Chris,3,Wed Jul 1 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"Hunwicks max games per year is 55 with the Rangers, his career numbers a not that impressive and he's always been a 7th man in contrast to Kleins top 5. Klein is also one of our most physical defenseman and bigger and stronger than Hunwick and I've even noticed that Hunwick gets bounced around by opponents because of his height and strength. Klein isn't known as a goal scorer and has always been a stay at home defenseman, who is better than Hunwick in that aspect is well. I think if Klein leaves the Rangers when his contract is up he's making around $4 mill."
rangers,3brlb3,Serrathen,5,Wed Jul 1 17:45:40 2015 UTC,Enough with the advanced stats. Klein and hunwick are not even close to the same quality. If you would just watch the games you'd know this
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,3,Wed Jul 1 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"Fucking seriously. Advanced stats in hockey aren't baseball. They are fancy names with puck possession and shots attempts attached and everyone trots them out like gospel. Hunwick's best advanced stats season was followed by an entire year in the minors, clearly the coach must have seen something. People who think stats tell the whole story are an idiot."
rangers,3brlb3,Itscominrightforus,3,Wed Jul 1 17:45:13 2015 UTC,This. I hate the idea of advanced stats in hockey. It works in baseball because the game is based on throw ball -> hit ball -> make play as result of hit. It works in baseball. It does not work in hockey. It's an infinitely more dynamic game. Advanced stats are useless to me.
rangers,3brlb3,runninhillbilly,2,Wed Jul 1 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"I understand not liking advanced possession stats, but look at this graph. It shows the exact shots that are being allowed while he's on the ice. You can see he's seeing far more shots against from high danger areas than his team is getting. That is not the mark of a good defenseman."
rangers,3brlb3,jh1336,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"Hockey is still just too complicated of a game to know exactly what kind of story these charts tell. Maybe Klein almost always has his man tied up but his partner failed him, or he's more likely to be the defenceman who leaves the front of the net because he's a better skater. I just don't see why people think this says more than having a Jack Adams worthy coach watching these guys every single day, who can clearly see who is responsible for a certain scoring opportunity and how often it seems to occur to a certain player. If advanced stats were so great we wouldn't have made the ECF 3 out of the last 4 years playing a defenceman like Girardi 23 minutes a game when his hero charts say he isn't even worthy of a roster spot."
rangers,3brlb3,Itscominrightforus,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:04:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I thought hunwick was overall just weak on the puck and would turn it over easily after being checked. He's got a pass in him tho to be honest. That being said, Klein makes the same plays and is an animal defensively"
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"Klein was our worst player in the playoffs. Worse than Glass even. The only reason you think he's an ""animal"" defensively is that he gets stuck in his own end and is forced to play defense more often. I remember at least one occasion where he turned the puck over in his own end three times on one shift but nobody really made any note of that. If any of the less gritty defensemen that somehow get labeled as weak defensively turn it over even once they get crucified. Klein was absolutely lost."
rangers,3brlb3,jh1336,0,Wed Jul 1 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"So you're just going to blow off stats that mean a lot more than a stupid eye test? I'll take numbers and facts over the ""eye test""."
rangers,3brlb3,Sailor_Chris,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:38:05 2015 UTC,Yea it's pretty obvious you just watch hockey and have never played. It's a fast game where stats don't really paint the real picture for a defensive defenseman. If you can't tell that hunwick is a much weaker player than Klein then idk what to tell you
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,3,Wed Jul 1 17:39:45 2015 UTC,Let's just ignore the fact that his positioning is garbage and he gives up a ton of high quality scoring chances.
rangers,3brlb3,Sailor_Chris,2,Wed Jul 1 17:50:21 2015 UTC,I can give you plenty of proof that Klein isn't good. Or do you not want that because i can prove you wrong?
rangers,3brlb3,Sailor_Chris,-1,Wed Jul 1 17:48:46 2015 UTC,Give some proof other than some random guy tweeting stats
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,3,Wed Jul 1 18:08:29 2015 UTC,Can't read a graph from a stats website? Come on dude.
rangers,3brlb3,Sailor_Chris,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"I can, although I don't really think graphs paint the entire picture so maybe give some examples of exact plays or something. Because showing points on a graph maybe doesn't show someone else's mistake which led to kleins mistake which lead to your quality scoring chances let up stats. You're just trying really hard in an argument that's actually irrelevant lol"
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,2,Wed Jul 1 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"Let's forget the Hunwick vs Klein thing. Klein isn't good. He lets up a ton of high quality chances. Proof:https://twitter.com/AdamHerman_BSB/status/615977920000065537  Red is good, blue is bad. For someone who everyone claims is ""solid"" defensively, that's sure a lot of high quality chances for the opposition."
rangers,3brlb3,Sailor_Chris,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:54:58 2015 UTC,You're entitled to your own opinion. I just really don't have time to type an essay about why I think Klein is better than hunwick. I'm just glad you don't make decisions for the Rangers cause if you did we'd be bottom of the metro
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,2,Wed Jul 1 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, i proved you wrong and now you're just going to give up because you can't back it up. Maybe next time, know what you're talking about before you start saying things"

rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Dude you don't have to play to understand the game. I get it gives an edge but you don't have to be an explayer to know how a game works.  There are people who HAVE played hockey and say the same thing.  You keep saying eye test and who is weaker and just being able to tell yet every shred of traditional and fancy stat points to Klein being worse than Hunwick and it's not even close.  I just did this last night on another thread and broke it down in every possible that I haven't already. PPG GPG APG over careers, goals for last year minus Klein's two good months, turnovers (which I dont even believe in as a reliable stat but someone brought it up), Corsi, PDO, positioning charts, BetterO/BetterD charts. You can pick any way you chose to watch the game and every single way tells the same story: Klein is overrated. I like Klein and I think this.  The only argument for him is ""watch the game"" and I do watch the game I see a guy who for 75% of the season missed the net with his shot or shot it into the goaltender and had trouble defending against easy matchups.  I don't know how many more times I can break it down. You never see anyone in favor of Klein provide real tangible evidence  because it doesn't exist.  If you want to cite the eye test I want to see extensive video packages seeing Klein making great defensive plays and Hunwick failing to do so. But all anyone says is ""watch the game""  It's getting ridiculous. You can like Klein and also admit he's overrated.  EDIT: The reason I exclude Klein's first 2 months is because it's widely acknowledged that that production was unsustainable and he was just getting lucky."
rangers,3brlb3,TBlueshirtsV22,0,Wed Jul 1 17:50:07 2015 UTC,The problem here is that you're looking for scoring from Klein when that's not even close to his role. He's a solid bottom 4 d man and that's all he's asked to be. You guys are expecting too much from that type of player
rangers,3brlb3,catlover16,2,Wed Jul 1 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"Corsi, positioning charts, and Bettero/Better D charts all can demonstrate defensive value. When compared to Hunwick all of Hunwick's metrics are better. Same thing with more traditional stats like giveaways, because you don't seem to believe in fancy stats.  People like Babcock even acknowledge the value of them, he said that months ago (funny that his team signed Hunny...).  And no I expect Klein to produce like a 6th Dman. Which he does. But 6th Dmen shouldnt be getting paid $3mil long term.  As far as this thread hating fancy stats, I don't get it. I can prove to you that Hunwick is superior with traditional and fancy stats. People cite fancy stats for a reason. They quantify the eye test into something that can be used comparitively. Again I like Klein but I don't lie to myself about his quality of play. There are equal or better options out there for $2mil less."
rangers,3brlb3,TBlueshirtsV22,-2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Stats that after how many years of professional hockey all of a sudden become relevant and important stats? GM's survived for decades without fancy Corsi stats. As we've seen in baseball these advanced metrics get tweaked over time and some stats people thought were the gospel become irrelevant in 5 years.

Moore (I wonder if it's possible we see him back? That would be kind of interesting...), but I thought he did a great job filling in during all of our D's crazy injuries. I thought he was quite good in our zone, and honestly, there were countless times where he completely saved our asses by having good net presence to swipe the puck away. Plus, I remember there was that small stretch where he had so many good offensive chances (and maybe one that even got retracted, lol).   But I guess when you think about all the other guys we have, maybe he wanted a bigger role and/or it helps our cap just a bit, too. Regardless, hope he does well in TOR.   I just hope this doesn't mean we jump the gun on any of our other guys like Skjei or McIlrath (I hope they get more playing time in AHL than having to sit around as a healthy scratch)."

His name has the strange Y in it because his father was a football player named Jay Megna and he wanted his kids to have the same name, hence we wind up with brothers Jayson and Jaycob.  He was an excellent goal scorer at the AHL level, but his defensive game leaves a lot to be desired. At the NHL level he probably isn't going to be more than a 4th liner.   But he is extremely fast, and his best performance came while playing on a line with Brian Gibbons (whom the Rangers also picked up), so they could combine to be 2/3rds of a speedy NHL 4th line or a top scoring AHL line."

rangers,3brbcs,RANGERSTOWN,2,Wed Jul 1 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"Right, but when a guy's leading the league in points I think it's fair to think of him and Nash as 1a and 1b in terms of our go-to's for offense. We traded our captain and two first rounders for him (I know one was conditional, blah blah blah), but the expectation was that he would provide elite level offense. He came nowhere close to that this year."

In fact, he is still very fast. I personally believe his whole life changed when he went from being a guy in florida to a dad in NY. Not that he was not a dad before, but we all knew he came here to be closer to family. You think he still treats hockey as his #1? I dont. I do not think he was AWFUL in the playoffs. He just didnt score. he was streaky.  I think he was better than people give him credit for. I believe he can play one more year and get 60 points. I just do not want him on the Rangers.    I want someone with more versatility. Not another winger who likes to create plays from the outside and not crash. I rather spend 2-3 million on a guy who will be more diverse and be asked to do more than play on the PP and on the 2nd or 3rd line.   It has nothing to do with cap space. It has everything to do with the fact that I rather have someone else. Someone who puts their body in front of the net, crashes the net, finishes checks."

rangers,3brbcs,Calad,12,Wed Jul 1 15:14:26 2015 UTC,He was 4th on our team in points
rangers,3brbcs,airgyros,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:18:30 2015 UTC,"That's not saying much.  He really showed his age on the ice, especially in the playoffs.  There were times when it was downright embarrassing."
rangers,3brbcs,Calad,-2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it was clearly the wear and tear of the past year and a half that made his play drop off so much in the playoffs. That is a huge issue for a team that wants to contend for the cup"
rangers,3brbcs,LIGuy631,3,Wed Jul 1 15:41:20 2015 UTC,He was never the same after the injury. He's good but probably never recovered. Time to move on

rangers,3brbcs,Mats_Zuccarello,7,Wed Jul 1 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"Comments like this is what pushes him to do great things. I am sure people were saying the very same thing to him when he was an undrafted college kid standing at 5'7.   3 seasons ago he had 60 points in 48 games 2 seasons ago he split time with NY/TB and had 69 points in 82. Plus 15 points in 25 playoff games  last season he had 52 points in 74 games. 7 points in 19 playoff games. Correct me if I am wrong, but some 25 year olds in their prime wish they can have half of this in the AHL... let alone the NHL.   I think he had an off-year. But to say he was slower... You obviously are using this excuse because its what you heard. You do not watch.  Slower... Did you watch MSL trip on the PP, and still make it on the backcheck to ALMOST stop the guy. He fell, got up and hustled back to try and make a play that trickled in.   There are 25 teams out there who want him on their 2nd or 3rd line and many of these teams would want him on their 1st line.  Its why Pitts and NJ immediately contacted him.   I just dont think he fits in well with our blueprints. Doesnt mean hes not a great player.   Bet you, he signs with NJ next year and scores 60 points"
rangers,3brbcs,swingingthechain,2,Wed Jul 1 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Love it...now that the season is over and we don't have to see him play every other night, everyone is forgetting how absolutely atrocious he played.  Does he have some life left in him?  Sure.  But he is nowhere near the caliber player he was.  Why can't people just accept the fact that he's 40 years old, slowing down and maybe, just maybe, might be on the downslope from his prime?"
rangers,3brbcs,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:54:02 2015 UTC,Didn't he get a boost from another teammate after he tripped tho? Not saying he's slow but I think I remember hearing that
rangers,3brbcs,eanhart,3,Wed Jul 1 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Boyle pushed him forward"
rangers,3brbcs,swingingthechain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"Yea Boyle, who he originally beat out in that foot race too. But ill tell ya now as a player, that boost doesnt do much.   St. Loius is still a guy with giant legs and hes super fast"
rangers,3brbcs,jacybear,-4,Wed Jul 1 17:04:50 2015 UTC,Should have known that a player who demanded a trade over an Olympic roster snub would have been a diva. I'm not sorry when I say that I don't wish him the best. Sather really blew it with this trade and it's going to hurt the franchise for a long time.

rangers,3brt84,guyzieman,10,Wed Jul 1 17:22:18 2015 UTC,1) We still have one of the best defenses in the league.   But... but we still have that loser Kevin Klein who would only be a 7th D on Buffalo! /s

rangers,3brt84,jacybear,3,Wed Jul 1 17:33:19 2015 UTC,Letang and Maatta.
rangers,3brt84,AT-ST,2,Wed Jul 1 18:34:40 2015 UTC,"Penguins fan here don't hurt me I like the Rangers a little bit.  Our third line as of right now is Kunitz - Sutter - Dupuis.  If Plotkinov doesn't work on Malkin's wing then substitute him for either Kunitz or Dupuis.  That is actually a pretty good 3rd line, and will be the first time Sutter has had good wingers.  Our 4th line will be a little thin, probably made up of Bennett and some of our prospects.  Defense may be an issue while two of our Rookies go through growing pains.  Maatta, who will most likely be paired with Letang, is an outstanding Defenseman.    Ian Cole is very promising.  He looked like a legit 2nd paring defenseman through the end of last season.  If he can keep that up then we are pretty well off.  Pouliot is our most likely partner for Cole on the 2nd pairing.  Great offensive defenseman, but has some defensive lapses.  Hopefully his game matures over the off season and quickly into the start of the season.  He will make a great quarterback on the 2nd PP unit.  Dumoulin - honestly don't know much about him.  He is said to be very promising though.  The one criticism is that he isn't as physical as he should be.  It is said he has a good first pass.  Lovejoy got shit on pretty unfairly.  He is a bottom pairing defensemen in a top pairing role.  But he is very good for a bottom pairing defensemen and is capable of stepping up should injuries occur.  Scuderi, again another very good bottom pairing defenseman.  The only issue with him is that his contract is too high for too long.  Look at it this way, our defense is better than it was at the end of the season/playoffs last year and the Penguins managed to keep the score pretty low.  The problem was that the Pens couldn't score, but that should change with the addition of Kessel and the return of Letang, Maatta, Pouliot and Dumo."

rangers,3brt84,dethside,3,Wed Jul 1 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"No way they have any room for depth at this point.   They lost Martin and Erhnoff and do not have anyone signed yet to take their places.  As seen in the playoffs last year, these guys are in trouble defensively,even with Letang healthy, and especially if Maata continues to have health problems.  I'm not too worried about a team that completely top-loads with a D core like the rangers.  Our depth with run through their bottom lines."

rangers,3bs3ds,ncolaros,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:21:45 2015 UTC,We're going to make ourselves too shallow on D if we trade Yandle and don't get an equal D-man in return.  Plus to get Yandle's caliber at $3 mil is next to impossible.
rangers,3bs3ds,BrutalJones,-2,Thu Jul 2 04:07:41 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that's fine with this? I'd rather keep Klein than Yandle and Girardi has a NMC.  New GM, new view of the team."

rangers,3bs3ds,TBlueshirtsV22,4,Wed Jul 1 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's a more valuable defenseman than Yandle. He's not, but that's also why Yandle makes better trade bait. Yandle will bring in a way better return than Klein will. Plus it's not like Klein is bad, he's a legit Top-4 pairing guy IMO. And he counts for less against the cap, which is a necessity for us at this point."
rangers,3bs3ds,BrutalJones,7,Wed Jul 1 18:43:23 2015 UTC,"My problem is that our defense is fine. We didn't score enough in the playoffs, and trading away a guy like Yandle doesn't help that situation. He's an assist machine."
rangers,3bs3ds,Ralph_Baconader,3,Wed Jul 1 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you're saying. I think Yandle is a really important piece of this team.  As far as offense vs. defense being the issue, we scored 21 goals in 7 games against Tampa and lost, Chicago scored 13 in 6 games and won. To me, that's a defensive issue.  I'm not saying you're wrong, we did need more scoring but I think what this tells us is we should be evaluating how we are at every position (except Hank). I don't think Yandle is the guy you look to move, he's a wizard when it comes to puck movement, but I think it depends on the return for him. IF he moves, of course."
rangers,3bs3ds,BrutalJones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"trading away a guy like Yandle doesn't help   I mean, it's not like we're just discarding Yandle. We will be getting a return for him. A damn good one, even. As I said in the post you replied to: He's a very valuable defenseman, easily more valuable than Klein.   Our defense is fine.   Our defense is better than fine. It's extraordinarily deep, easily the deepest or second deepest (Nashville, maybe?) in the league. So deep that we've got Yandle playing on the third pairing.  If you're going to move somebody in order to bring in some additional pieces, Yandle would be the guy, I think. We've got both Diaz and Skjei that could each easily skate the third pairing along with either Boyle or Klein."
rangers,3bs3ds,FLRangerFan,2,Wed Jul 1 18:54:20 2015 UTC,Klein counts for more against the cap (2.9 vs 2.65) because the 'yotes retained half of yandles salary

rangers,3bs3ds,BrutalJones,2,Wed Jul 1 18:48:22 2015 UTC,Comparing Yandle and Klein is like apples and oranges. Can't hold Klein to the offensive standards of Yandle. Klein is a defensive defenseman.

If the Rangers can sign one of those guys to a cheap, risk-free contract (I'm thinking Hodgson, Arcobello, or Nash) I would be very happy to get a guy that can win faceoffs.    If they want to give Lindberg a try I would be happy with that too.  Seems that he's been hyped up in Hartford for the last two years but hasn't really been given a shot yet despite his decent numbers (no room for him I guess).  He's young and low-risk so why not?  I'm all for bringing in a center and pushing Hayes to the wing because it was so depressing to watch him take faceoffs last year."

But with one of those fans you get the loyal fans who have been through the team through thick and thin   New York/Big Market Cities   New York will always get hate as well other big market cities. Also Hockey is not seen as the number one sport in New York. So it could be seen that New York doesn't care enough about Hockey as much as a Montreal or Vancouver where it's the Primary sport. New York has so many teams with various degrees of success (and failure). And smaller market teams have a jealously over bigger market teams whether it's not being on NBC games as much or the idea that free agents would rather go to a New York over Nashville which isn't true all the time, It's money, quality of team, and where that player would fit in the organization that determines if they sign rather than just bright lights NYC."

But it's stupid to argue that Rangers fans ""know absolutely nothing about hockey.""

rangers,3bmw6n,Theige,4,Tue Jun 30 19:21:40 2015 UTC,I think selling him was smart.  He likely will be a solid player but probably not a perennial all-star.  I'd expect him to produce on a Kreider-like level within a few years.
rangers,3bmw6n,DicNavis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, he might be a perennial all star but so might Kreider...  Duclair was sold-high.  He looked like he has the skill but I remember watching Alexandre Daigle skate with the Rangers and thinking he could be a perennial all-star."
rangers,3bmw6n,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:11:10 2015 UTC,"Kreider most likely will not make any all-star teams in his career, and the chance of him becoming a perennial all-star is even slimmer.  There is one perennial all-star on the Rangers and his name is Henrik Lundqvist.  That's an insane sort of projection for Kreider to possibly live up to."
rangers,3bmw6n,DicNavis,2,Wed Jul 1 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"The kid just turned 24 and has unique skills.  If you don't think he could score 30+ goals several seasons in a arrow if given a decent power play, we aren't watching the same player.  That with all he does to a defense with his combination of speed and size.  Yes, I think he can get to a few allstar games.  Speaking to the rest of the team, you obviously undervalue Ryan McDonough as well.  Watch Stepan or brassard on next years all star squad..."

rangers,3bmw6n,xxdarksyde73xx,3,Tue Jun 30 14:46:51 2015 UTC,"It's interesting as Arizona acquired him at the deadline and is already giving up on him after the team pretty much gave up on the end of their season.  He is a 24 year old formerly highly touted prospect w/ a $850,000 cap hit last year.  It's worth a discussion about bringing him back as a depth D-man if we have cap room considering we do need some depth defensemen."
rangers,3bnvu5,ziggyy77,11,Tue Jun 30 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"Don't really know anything about Jones, but just based off of a quick search, he is 3 years younger than Talbot and is an RFA, which means longer control for less $$$ when they resign him."
rangers,3bnvu5,blinkme123,5,Tue Jun 30 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"Jones is younger and on a better current contract than Talbot, making him immediately more valuable not concerning stats. He also has a good amount of potential according to scouts. Also a lot of fans are saying the Sharks got robbed, and that this was a robbery by Sweeney."
rangers,3bnvu5,The_Other_Manning,4,Tue Jun 30 19:06:23 2015 UTC,"We probably got a little underpaid for Talbot, the Bruins probably got a little overpaid for Jones."
rangers,3bnvu5,patrickhoagland,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:11:19 2015 UTC,Sharks overpaid because they were basically the last team without a goalie. I honestly don't blame them for giving up a first. I think Jones may be riskier but has the higher ceiling than Talbot
rangers,3bnvu5,bu77munch,2,Tue Jun 30 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"Well, weren't here rumours of the Sharks giving up a first for Talbot? If it's true, I'm wondering if they were offering a first + something unfavourable (eg. taking one of our core guys or making us take a bad contract), but after waiting too long, decided to change the offer to a first + prospect. And as well, including everything mentioned about Jones' age + RFA status."
rangers,3bnvu5,keetner,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking... I guess the age and RFA helped Boston, but I was really hoping Sharks would have grabbed Talbot... especially seeing as they gave up a first+prospect for Jones over a few late round draft picks they could've given up for Talbot"

rangers,3bnvu5,RhynoSorceress,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"The value of draft picks.  A future first is much lower in value than a current first and depending on where in the round, a high second in 2015 is valued near a (possibly) late first.  Other factors are that this (2015) draft is considered much deeper than 2016 and the uncertainty of where that pick would be.  Then you consider that by 2017, a pick you draft in 2015 will be closer to the NHL than the pick from 2016.  They are not of linear value to teams."
rangers,3boc91,dethside,5,Tue Jun 30 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we have a plan to bring in a D on the cheap, or if they are going to put McIlrath or Skjei in as the extra D.  I would say putting the money out for a FA blueliner would be better than the latter, now that I think of it. Let the two of them keep playing regularly in the AHL."
rangers,3boc91,irishguy42,5,Wed Jul 1 01:23:24 2015 UTC,Hunwick is already cheap though. I don't really see the point of bringing in an FA if we can keep him at a similar price point.
rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Wed Jul 1 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why letting him go is confusing me. Putting McIlrath or Skjei in sheltered 7th D minutes hinders them more than anything.

rangers,3boc91,TBlueshirtsV22,-1,Wed Jul 1 01:38:09 2015 UTC,We're in a cap crunch so obviously it makes sense to let a good 3rd pairing defenseman with a $600k cap hit walk while keeping an average 3rd pairing defenseman with a $3.9M $2.9M hit.

rangers,3boc91,LGR1994,-9,Tue Jun 30 21:35:50 2015 UTC,lol is this the Boston sports media? Just because a player walks for free agency/gets traded doesn't mean there's personal strife involved.    He probably just got sick of sitting in the press box while watching Klein and Girardi's incompetent asses get big minutes.
rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,8,Tue Jun 30 21:38:24 2015 UTC,You're delusional if you think Hunwick is a better option than Girardi or Klein

rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Tue Jun 30 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"Yea I've said it before and I'll say it again when you look into Klein and Hunwick and actually study their games and the numbers Hunwick is better than Klein. This isn't an opinion this is an objective conclusion.  I love Klein, more than I like Hunwick but if I'm building a team I offer Hunwick a spot on my 3rd pairing before I do Klein"
rangers,3boc91,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:35:31 2015 UTC,Hunwick turns the puck over like its his job
rangers,3boc91,spitfyer,4,Wed Jul 1 03:37:38 2015 UTC,Klein's turnover ratio was a -29 (worst on the team) Hunwick's was a -12.  The team's leader in giveaways was Ryan McDonagh. He's surely not worse than Klein though right?  Klein was 4th in turnovers. Hunwick 14th.  Besides Subban led the NHL in turnovers and Tavares was 2nd. I'm not exactly sure what looking only at turnovers does for us. But if you want to evaluate it statistically I guess turnovers is another area where Hunwick (and every other Ranger really) has Klein beat
rangers,3boc91,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"how many games did hunwick play though lol, of course he has less turn overs, hes played in exponentially less games"
rangers,3boc91,spitfyer,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:27 2015 UTC,Klein turnovers per 60 mins was 2.1. Hunwick was at a 1.8 so all things being equal it is still in favor of Hunwick
rangers,3boc91,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"Some of the leaders in turnovers among defensemen this season include PK Subban, Erik Karlsson, Keith Yandle and Drew Doughty. Turnovers aren't a good metric of defensive performance when you're looking at a defenseman who's a good possession driver (like Hunwick, Yandle or Boyle)."
rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,0,Wed Jul 1 05:58:03 2015 UTC,Thank you.    I feel like if Klein didn't have an absurdly lucky stretch of offense this season people would feel different about him.
rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Tue Jun 30 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. A lot of people only remember October-December and the fact we got him for del Zotto.  The funny part is a lot of people dismiss the fancy stats that clearly show how Hunwick is better. They'll cite the offensive production even though what we saw from Klein was an aberration.  For proof, just look at their career per game averages:  Klein: .05 GPG .18 APG .23 PPG Hunwick: .05 GPG .17 APG .22 PPG  Even with that absurd production earlier last year from Klein he averages .01 PPG more than Hunwick over his career. So for those who don't believe in fancy stats, theres more proof in the traditional stats."
rangers,3boc91,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah career-wise Klein is pretty average to below average in terms of offense. He was shooting at an absurdly high percentage this season, especially from October to November."
rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Wed Jul 1 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it was a fluke.  If you evaluate them from towards the end of December on, Hunwick scored as many goals in fewer games (I think its 2 each from December 20th but I'd have to check to be exact).  So now someone would want to make the argument that being defensemen, the offensive production can be whatever as long as they defend.  Thats when you turn to the fancy stats and look at Corsi, high scoring chances, positioning charts from War On Ice, the better O/worse O charts that you see on Own The Puck.  Once you look at them you realize not only are they, over their careers, virtually equal offensively but Hunwick is BETTER (substantially so) defensively. You could see it in the playoffs too. Yes, Klein was coming off a broken arm but Hunwick was getting bounced in and out of the lineup all season and he never had a problem performing when asked.  So once you establish that Hunwick is a superior all around defenseman you look at the contracts and you scratch your head at the fact that Klein made five times as much last year than Hunwick.  I mean I think the evidence is pretty clear. I'm not saying Klein is bad, he's not. But Hunwick is better, and Klein is getting paid too much to be our 6th best defender (was 7th best until Hunwick became a free agent)."
rangers,3boc91,TBlueshirtsV22,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"Also I like how I'm the delusional one for using statistical evidence to back my opinion instead of subjective bullshit like ""MUH EYE TEST"" or basing my entire opinion on a stretch when Klein was shooting like quadruple his career shooting percentage.    EDIT: Also still waiting for someone to give me an explanation for why Girardi or Klein are better than Hunwick. Because so far, I've posted statistical evidence and the only dissenting opinions I've seen have called me ""delusional"" or downvoted me."
rangers,3boc91,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Wed Jul 1 01:16:27 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to Klein, his cap hit is 2.9 not 3.9"

Funny how you mention that Dubi not going far with CBJ, yet... but you have no problem ignoring the fact that Callahan beat us on his way to the Stanley Cup in Tampa Bay.

rangers,3bsiea,josephnicklo,-2,Thu Jul 2 13:28:01 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe Callahan is a good player, and I know a good one when I see one. Callahan had 54 points in the regular season. Not too shabby. In the playoffs, he had 8. Kind of weak, but against us he played well even if he was not on the score sheet a lot. And in the finals, he had 4 points in the 7 games.   The best part about all of this. Is not that he had more points than MSL, never is... Its the fact that beyond the points there is far more to his game.    He keeps his game simple. He helps produce a lot of chances using his go-to moves. The wrap around pass. Playing off the boards. Causing havoc in the offensive zone. Getting in the opponents way. Screening the goalie and his quick slap shot off a 1-1... Which I remember he scored against us that way, and/or hit the post on another chance.  He is responsible on the defensive end. Its not often that he spends his time on his side of the ice.  On the PP he does more than anyone on the Rangers has in front of the net. Whether or not he touches the puck, theres value to this He finishes checks, I am sure its not easy to play against him   Now this is exactly the argument I make when I see MSL and people say they want to sign him for 2 million. I would not take MSL back for 700,000. Why? Because he is a one dimensional player. A very good one but when his stats do not go up, then whats going for him?   Took him 2 series to look good on the PP (in the sense of moving around, creating chances, confusing the D)... and even then he slipped and fell on one that went for a SHG... so wtf.   Furthermore, if hes not scoring. Whats he good for?  He doesnt hit.  Hes not a very good defensive player.   We already have too many guys who play from the outside / boards. We need guys this year who can get in the crease and we cant rely on AV to decide to put Nash in that spot every time"

Young offensive talent. A strong depth that continues to grow. And a good coach.    I would say we have, without a doubt, a better coach. We also have some pretty good young talent. They've got a better prospect pool, but we're also in different stages as franchises. We're competing for the Cup, they're not.    Let me remind you, MSL hasnt made Tampa Bay that good in his career since 10 years ago.    I'm sorry, but what? MSL won the Art Ross trophy just a few years ago.

I know some people are on the fence about it, but in addition to rooting for that player and the team, I sort of see jerseys as a representation or a kind of a ""slice in time"" of a club's history. For example, if you saw someone wearing an Avery jersey, you'd probably think back to the Rangers from the mid-late 2000s and all that crazy shit that happened. I mean, you have the Avery rule, sure...but for me, I actually always think back to Torts being suspended after chucking water on a fan, lol. Had nothing to do with Avery, but just given the fact that it happened when he was still on the team, it's what I think about :P. Or, even something like a Richter jersey, you'd definitely think back to pre-Hank years. I get that this might be a slightly different situation given the fact that he's a retired Rangers with his number in the rafters...but...I hope it gets my point across any way.   But again, this is how I view it all. Some people might not want to pick up a jersey of a non-player, and really, that's completely up to them, too. I think at the end of the day, it's just what you prefer. For me, I had naturally gravitated towards both Hags and Cam, so I would feel more inclined to pick up their jerseys."
rangers,3bnxj8,keetner,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"Both Dubi and Avery were loved by the fans. People still have mixed feelings about Cally because of the money he wanted but he's fine.  I sort of agree with you. I guess some even less popular or memorable rangers jerseys can be acceptable (sort of) to remember what it was like back then or Remember our team in ""x"". Guys like Shanahan, Straka, Lindros, Gomez, Redden is like ""remember our team when we had this player"". Although who would wear a Wade Redden jersey unironically is beyond me. The other guys I mentioned ranged from ok to pretty good in their tenure   Also when I think of the pre Hank years I think about the post Ritcher years. That inbetween era of Dunham, Blackburn, Kevin Weeks."

I doubled checked with the picture and that has numbers on the arms. So if anyone is getting their jersey there may or may not be numbers there.   Two solutions is to either return it. (I plan to return in store hopefully find a Hagelin jersey there, during the summer or get my money back)  you can buy a number kit and iron or sew the numbers yourself. Good option for the people getting it overseas.   If it doesn't bother you then pay no attention, but for me it does. I had fake jerseys that didn't make this mistake."

We have little room to make such additions.   Hagelin left. This is fine. I honestly believe Fast can replace him on the 3rd line. I honestly think Fast can move onto the 2nd possibly. In 58 games on the 4th line at 22 years old, he had 14 points. With 82 games on the 4th line at 23 years old, I can believe he will score 25 points. On the 3rd line, I think he can reach 30-35 points EASY and give effective minutes on the PK. All in all, he will be 2 years younger than Hagelin doing the same stuff.   I think Lindberg or Bourque can fight for the 4th line spot and both be of strong value. Both have defensive value. Both are quick and promising young bodies who have shown some interest already by our NHL squad. I think one of them can fit in on the 4th line immediately. Playing 50-60 games and scoring 10-20 points.   Etem will be on the 4th-3rd or 2nd line.   I hope we can make out 3 million in cap room and go after Mike Richards. Well at the very least check him out. Hes likely to not want a big salary, still making $ from LA. He has potential to be a top 6 player. He is gritty. Strong. Experienced. Won a cup. Faceoffs.

rangers,3bhvnq,MungTongue,14,Mon Jun 29 10:25:47 2015 UTC,"Here's how I look at it.  What if the Rangers signed Hagelin and that money left them with having to chose between signing Stepan or Kreider?    The cap is a whole new ballgame and all moves have to be looked with that in mind.  I will miss Hags, but Rangers can't pay everyone."
rangers,3bhvnq,shantm79,2,Mon Jun 29 14:13:53 2015 UTC,This is an excellent point. I'd give up Hags any day of the week instead of having to make that decision.
rangers,3bhvnq,bkeschhh,12,Mon Jun 29 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"I for one, really liked this trade. Etem has good potential AND we cleared cap space.   Before the draft, I had resigned myself to the idea that we'd soon be losing Hagelin in Free Agency for essentially nothing, and was coming to terms with that. To get a player like Etem back was nice, IMO."
rangers,3bhvnq,elyankee23,3,Mon Jun 29 15:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah...it kind of sucks to say it, but thinking about it reasonably, I'm not necessarily surprised Hags was moved. I've mentioned it before, but in the beginning of the year, I think we could see that (i) our wingers were very much stacked, (ii) a lot of people were saying we'd likely only have room for either him or Zucc, especially after Staal's extension, and (iii), there was also quite a few people saying how there are a lot of other players that could take over for him. Initially it was Duclair, but I really think Fast's performance in the Playoffs got a few heads turning (eg. he's pretty speedy himself, is on the PK, shows he can be very aggressive on the forecheck, ...). I suppose that potential and the fact that his contract is so much more cap friendly was something too hard to look over. I just wish Hags had more of a chance to play with Hayes + J.T. Miller, because I remember their line had looked really good for a few weeks, until they had to get shuffled again.   But...yeah. I've come to really like the guy and it just sucks when you see some of your favourite players leaving. I think the thing that kills me most about the trade is knowing that he'll be split up from Zucc and Brass. Even if they never really played on the same line, there's still chemistry you never really want to mess with."
rangers,3bhvnq,keetner,2,Mon Jun 29 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"That was a pretty well written article.  I also agree with the trade, although I will miss Hagelin, of course."
rangers,3bj0c4,Jrelis,4,Mon Jun 29 16:54:59 2015 UTC,I don't think he likes AV. I'd like to take a shot at him for a cheap deal though. Just as long as we sign Miller fast and steps.

rangers,3bj0c4,jm7393,3,Mon Jun 29 17:04:30 2015 UTC,To be fair we had the same thoughts about Brassard and Arniel not getting along in Columbus. Either way I don't really see where Hodgson fits other than maybe 3C.
rangers,3bj0c4,guyzieman,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"Different. Brassard was already here. Also, he's a different person than Cody Hodgson."
rangers,3bj0c4,DeanYoungblood10,3,Tue Jun 30 01:58:41 2015 UTC,his father complained about it.   That's sad. Let him fight his own battles.

rangers,3bj0c4,DeanYoungblood10,3,Mon Jun 29 22:43:57 2015 UTC,I don't think AV was a fan of him.
rangers,3bj0c4,NotFoley,2,Mon Jun 29 17:02:10 2015 UTC,If we don't sign back Commander Shep then I definitely would like him as a 4th liner/healthy scratch. He's cheap but I don't think he has a fondness for AV.
rangers,3bj0c4,thehockeychimp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:21 2015 UTC,I could see it on a cheap 1 year deal.
rangers,3bjopt,5cotland,16,Mon Jun 29 19:48:43 2015 UTC,He already turned down a 2 year 6 mil offer from the preds plus I don't like him. So no.
rangers,3bjopt,jm7393,3,Mon Jun 29 19:50:05 2015 UTC,This...
rangers,3bjopt,booshyschmoozy,5,Mon Jun 29 21:25:46 2015 UTC,He turned down a reasonable deal for the situation he's in. If we sign him that's bad PR for us and also I don't think we need him. We need money to re-sign Stepan. It sucks though because he's a really good player.
rangers,3bjopt,plastictf,5,Mon Jun 29 20:08:40 2015 UTC,I don't want this trash on my team. Fuck that guy sideways with a rake.
rangers,3bjopt,invrsleep,3,Mon Jun 29 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"The drugs didn't bother me, since he got clean anyway. But the sexual misconduct allegations? If there's any truth he can fuck right off to retirement."

rangers,3bjopt,Michael_the_Guido,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:16 2015 UTC,no
rangers,3bjopt,Grgy,3,Mon Jun 29 20:41:33 2015 UTC,h-e-double hockey sticks no.
rangers,3bjopt,fosiacat,3,Mon Jun 29 20:44:30 2015 UTC,No.   He's trash and I do not want to have him in this jersey. We do not need all his off-ice bullshit coming into this season. From what I have seen and the contract that the turned down from the Predators (Which wasn't too bad of a deal...) it would be terrible PR for us to take him on.   So let him stink in the sun alone.
rangers,3bjopt,AoifeCheeks,4,Mon Jun 29 22:38:32 2015 UTC,He's asking for too much money and he's likely a sexual abuser so no

rangers,3bjopt,Ben_Ulrand,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:51:26 2015 UTC,He seems like a real bag of crap on occasion and I think he'll be sticking with the Preds anyway.
rangers,3bjopt,SteamHole,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:31:11 2015 UTC,Agree with what everyone else says. Too many off-ice issues and certainly not willing to pay more than $3mil/year which he already turned down.
rangers,3bke35,weissclimbers,11,Mon Jun 29 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'd much rather give the spot to a young prospect than an overpriced, underperforming veteran with a history of injuries and poor choices"

rangers,3bke35,RolandTargaryen,7,Tue Jun 30 01:07:53 2015 UTC,yeah nope. St. Louis 2.0
rangers,3bke35,wellfuckme_right,3,Mon Jun 29 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"Not worth it in my opinion. Beyond the fact that he's underperformed since 2010, he's aging and his skill and conditioning are way down. When you are small (just like MLS) if you loose you're skill things get bad real quick. Larger players can stick around because they have long reaches and are able to take the body, but when you're small you're left with nothing if you loose that skill and speed which makes you affective. Also I heard there have been off-ice issues with motivation and drive (or lack thereof) but that's just speculation on my part as there is no real evidence on this. Having said that, I think we can get better players than him. I would rather see some players from within fight for a spot. Just my 2 cents."
rangers,3bke35,Robotron_25,3,Mon Jun 29 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"Once again, completely not worth it.    He's aging and the skill is starting to go down hill, not to mention the motivation issues he has are starting to show more (even if it is just speculation) I'd rather not take the risk.   Let's let one of the boys from Hartford have their chance instead."
rangers,3bke35,AoifeCheeks,3,Tue Jun 30 00:15:58 2015 UTC,FUCK NO
rangers,3bke35,SleepYourLifeAway,3,Tue Jun 30 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"If they do sign him, I hope he wears number 19. At least some fans save some money."
rangers,3bke35,CrowTR2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:03:10 2015 UTC,Lol just like Boyle
rangers,3bke35,DontTestTheUser,3,Tue Jun 30 21:24:01 2015 UTC,The dude is straight up done. Last off season was the first time in his career that he used a personal trainer. He never took care of his body and it shows with his drop off in play. There is no reason to even entertain the idea of picking him up.

rangers,3bke35,kreiderismylover,6,Mon Jun 29 23:03:09 2015 UTC,"Eh I'm actually in agreement with the people who are saying he's too worn down. Aside from his being able to help up our miserable faceoff win percentage, there's not too much upside + a huge floor that comes with signing him, and imo, the money's better off spent on Step. I was curious if anyone had a strong opinion on why/why not the front office should sign him and I guess I found out pretty quickly haha"

rangers,3bevm6,Donkey_Puncha_Rello,3,Sun Jun 28 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"Man, this past season must have been a crazy ride for him. If I'm not mistaken, he signed that extension with us for the chance to work a little more with Allaire...but who would have thought he would have had that opportunity all smashed into the next two months.   I think a lot of us were pretty confident with Cam going in...but with the first few weeks being pretty rocky, he seemed to garner quite a bit of doubt. One moment that sticks out to me is our game against the Leafs back in February (it was Cam's first three games/four days). Despite the win, everyone looked fucking exhausted and it was actually a bit mortifying to see, only because you'd wonder how tired everyone would be over the next few weeks...  But still, everyone kept pushing and I'd say they really rallied/helped him out. I think some of the turning points was that insane 6-5 game against the Isles, where it was just constant back/forth fighting for goals. Although the real moment I felt for Cam was during that game against CBJ where it went into the shootout. His last save was with a really aggressive poke check, and I couldn't help but feel like there was some frustration underlying it from not playing too well.   And you know, after that he was absolutely amazing. I mean, I'm sure Allaire had worked with him throughout, but because fans don't always have the opportunity to see things like that, the change on ice is so much more apparent. Sure, there were still some anxious moments, but like with any goalie, there always is. He just looked so much more confident and you couldn't help but be happy for the guy -- even more so when the MSG crowd would chant his name, him getting the First Star in that Panthers game, and especially being awarded the Steven McDonald Award.   I only wish we could have made it all the way this year because he did so much for us...but...eh, what can you do. I'm just glad his season ended as well as it did for him, and despite a very terrifying injury...well, yeah, it's just fucking crazy how things fall into place, y'know? I'm happy that he was able to overcome the adversity he did and prove people wrong. He'll likely have to continue doing so while in Edmonton, but I have faith in him.   Any ways, I didn't mean to make this so long, but damn, I've come to really like the guy. I'm just grateful that we had the opportunity to see him grow as a player over the past few years...definitely going to miss him, but hope he rocks it in Edmonton + rest of his career.   Thanks, Cam. Wishing you all the best :')"

rangers,3bewcl,mexicaaaan,4,Sun Jun 28 16:54:26 2015 UTC,No way. I love Hags but our new faces should be there - welcome our new Blueshirts. I don't want to keep being sad.
rangers,3bewcl,kthoag,3,Mon Jun 29 03:32:26 2015 UTC,Agreed. LGR  Gonna have to change my flair for the next season... I was really hoping we'd keep him so he could work on getting the puck into the actual net. (One of) the fastest skaters in the NHL and he can't finish a breakaway :\
rangers,3bewcl,speaking_of_nabokov,3,Sun Jun 28 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"Disagree   I liked Hags just as much as the next fan and appreciate his work over the past few years, but this is a business and we must move forward."
rangers,3bepav,NewGoldx14,20,Sun Jun 28 15:19:02 2015 UTC,Buchnevich and Skjei are our top prospects right now. Skjei had a chance at seeing time this year but won't likely be a regular until next. Buchnevich is staying in Russia one more year. Lindberg will likely make the club this year in a bottom-six role.   No one that was drafted this year or last has a shot with the club for at least 3 years minimum.
rangers,3bepav,brother_of_menelaus,6,Sun Jun 28 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"That should read ""has"" a chance for Skjei."
rangers,3bepav,brother_of_menelaus,2,Sun Jun 28 15:24:28 2015 UTC,I would say there is a good chance Skjei gets called up at some point this season.
rangers,3bepav,kmort,12,Sun Jun 28 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"Bold Prediction here- Give Ryan Gropp one year, I bet you he may be ready. Most likely not but just a bold prediction. Otherwise, Buchnevich,Skeiji,Allen,Bodie,Saarela,Kovacs,R.Bourque,Lindberg(already should be) should all have chance in the nex three years.  Edit:Forgot Halverson and Tambellini."
rangers,3bepav,NashtyHands,4,Sun Jun 28 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"Is Connor Allen still considered a prospect at this point? He's 25 and a very proven AHL defenseman. I think he could be our 6th or 7th D while we wait for Skjei, and in another organization he'd already be in the NHL, but at 25 it's not like he's really a prospect with a ton of space still to improve."

rangers,3bepav,NashtyHands,5,Mon Jun 29 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Brady Skjei, Oscar Lindberg, Pavel Buchnevich, Adam Tambellini, Ryan Borque and Brandon Halverson are probably the top guys to look for in the next 1-3 years.  Edit: Added Borque"

rangers,3bepav,The_Other_Manning,4,Mon Jun 29 17:47:24 2015 UTC,Are we just writing off McIlrath? Is he officially a bust?
rangers,3bepav,SMIRTLE,10,Sun Jun 28 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"No, not officially a bust but he's past his ELC now and he'll have to clear waivers to play in Hartford, which he still needs time in. Injuries and a lack of skating ability, mixed with his penchant for poor decision making (he routinely gives up position to ""make the big hit"" - think Glass-level decision making skills) have limited his progress so far."
rangers,3bepav,brother_of_menelaus,2,Sun Jun 28 17:59:40 2015 UTC,He's not Duncan Keith material. More like Rich Pilon material.
rangers,3bepav,Enzo95,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:27:43 2015 UTC,More like Rich Pylon
rangers,3bepav,DontTestTheUser,2,Mon Jun 29 16:57:03 2015 UTC,I think Lindberg is first and then it's McIlrath or Skjei.
rangers,3bepav,bu77munch,2,Sun Jun 28 17:02:17 2015 UTC,McIllrath pretty much has to make the team out of camp or he will be moved (pretty much for nothing if it comes to that) because of the waiver issue.
rangers,3bepav,PeteSamp27,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:19:05 2015 UTC,Rough. He's going to have to beat out Hunwick for 7th D.  McD- Girardi Staal- Klein Yandle- Boyle Hunwick/McIlrath
rangers,3bepav,bu77munch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"It's doubtful, but I wouldn't be surprised seeing Allen or Skeji either making the roster and Boyle is the 7th defenseman or one of them are the 7th defenseman but get a solid amount of games, depending on Boyle's play."
rangers,3bepav,NYRule1994,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:25:25 2015 UTC,You're more likely to see Klein become the seventh defenseman then Dan Boyle.  Boyle at least offers something more then throwing his face in front of pucks.
rangers,3bepav,MikeyRage,3,Sun Jun 28 22:21:05 2015 UTC,I think you're not giving Klein any credit. He's a damn good defensemen and before his injury was pretty much loved by all
rangers,3bepav,The_Other_Manning,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:24:09 2015 UTC,Klein also had some huge moments last season. Boyle and Klein are competing as far as I see it.
rangers,3bepav,callmesnake13,3,Sun Jun 28 23:11:12 2015 UTC,Klein played great before his injury. I dont know why many people here think he's a liability. I bet he'll have a great season if he stays healthy.

rangers,3bfcsc,Vivalastool2,32,Sun Jun 28 18:52:09 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who remembers how they put him in the AHL? He's not good anymore. I don't want him on the roster.   Edit: a word
rangers,3bfcsc,jedimasterchief,6,Sun Jun 28 19:14:49 2015 UTC,I even got to see him play in the AHL this past season...they barley played him. so no
rangers,3bfcsc,He_who_never_sleeps,13,Sun Jun 28 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"Mike Richards situation is not at all like Brad Richards'. Mike's game has been destroyed by concussions and supposed lack of conditioning, and he seems to have regressed enormously, in the same vein as Heatley and Ryan Malone.  Brad Richards, on the other hand, is still a good player (albeit worse with possession), but was simply not worth his contract anymore, and we had the opportunity to dump it with a compliance buyout to make room for younger players"
rangers,3bfcsc,James_Caan,-1,Sun Jun 28 19:21:22 2015 UTC,"They bought out BR because his production didn't match his cap hit, and the back end of his contract would have crippled the Rangers cap situation in the later years. Similar to what BR did in Chicago, Mike Richards wouldn't be asked to produce top 6 minutes or quality, just solidify a 3rd line center position.  The lessened role could fit his game now perfectly"
rangers,3bfcsc,James_Caan,2,Sun Jun 28 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"But the problem was that Mike Richards on the fourth line with the Kings was slow and shaky. He was sent to the AHL because virtually every facet of his game had deteriorated and the Kings were trying to get his conditioning together. We could just as easily sign a cheaper FA who would be more effective on our fourth line so we could develop Hayes as a center.  If you want to get perspective on Richards' play, remember that Dom Moore had better production with Tanner Glass as a winger."
rangers,3bfcsc,puckinright,8,Sun Jun 28 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"you guys are nuts for the sake of nostalgia.   mike richards hasn't been a replacement level player for roughly the past two seasons. i'd consider him a last below $1m option for the fourth line, but that is absolutely it.  precious little cap space to waste on mike richards."
rangers,3bfcsc,zucarigan,4,Sun Jun 28 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"I don't even want him on the roster, even if we got him for free. I highly doubt he could help a team win the cup in any meaningful way.  I'd rather just use that roster spot for a rookie."
rangers,3bfcsc,fosiacat,8,Mon Jun 29 08:54:34 2015 UTC,I probably wouldn’t even take him for league minimum. no.

rangers,3bfcsc,huzzakawah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"I was just about to post this same sentiment. He'd come cheap on a 1 year prove it contract, possibly for less than 2 million. There's no doubt that he'd bring good leadership, he's brought that everywhere he's played. Not to mention, the man knows how to win a face off, and is a solid defensive forward. Could easily fill the hole on the pk that was made when we traded dear sweet hags.   Having him as the 3c would allow hayes to move up and take the top 6 wing spot (and we could say good bye to his abysmal face off numbers). 3rd line could look like fast-richards-miller. That would be a very physical, tough line to play against that could grind out shifts, but also threaten offensively.   I think slats has to at least give his agent a call to kick the tires, especially if we're a win now team."
rangers,3bfcsc,MungTongue,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:12:21 2015 UTC,I say we just cut straight to the source and actually get Brad rather than hoping Mike can pull a Brad. What the fuck did I just say

rangers,3bfcsc,HeadForTheSHallows,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"Kings fans have described his play as ""disinterested"". With his concussion history, I think it's safe to say he's not a healthy player right now.  He's still young and might be able to turn it around. Or maybe he's finished.

rangers,3bbvjc,AoifeCheeks,6,Sat Jun 27 19:16:16 2015 UTC,Haggerty is gonna be spending some time in Rockford learning how their system works and probably getting some time during preseason. But he'll make it up to the Blackhawks at some point in this season.
rangers,3bbvjc,jh1336,6,Sat Jun 27 19:20:28 2015 UTC,He probably won't. He wasn't going to make it up here either and he's definitely not gonna fare much better with the champs. He can score but his defense needs a lot of work still. And a guy like Teuvo had troubles breaking in last year even though he's a far far better player in both facets.
rangers,3bbvjc,gianthamguy,2,Sat Jun 27 20:45:35 2015 UTC,He had trouble breaking in against a lot stiffer competition though. I think Bowman has already said the leash is going to be a lot longer for their kids this year (though let's see what Q has to say about that)
rangers,3bbvjc,jedimasterchief,5,Sat Jun 27 22:44:17 2015 UTC,They are moving Sharp and Possible Bickell. Richards won't re-sign which moves Tevo up to line two with Kane. Their third line is basically empty now. Plenty of holes.

rangers,3bbvjc,nameless22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:50:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, he's good, cheap, and improving, and Haggerty wasn't exactly generating hype"
rangers,3bbvjc,bjisba41,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan here. The trade was slightly different than what we were expecting but still inevitable (we knew we were likely to trade Raanta as we have two usable backup goalies and Raanta is too good for the AHL, but I and others thought he'd more likely end up in Edmonton or something but with Talbot traded NYR makes sense now). Raanta is a cool dude, you'll soon fall for him. He'll be a good guy in the locker room too. He's a solid backup goalie, we only had him in the AHL because Darling ended up as one too and well you gotta choose sadly. Not quite sure how he compares to Talbot but Raanta has had times where he started multiple games in a row when Crow got hurt so he's capable, and he's solid enough in general. You can't go wrong with him as a backup. Please welcome him kindly (his infectious smile makes it hard not to).  I heard some concern about Haggerty getting a chance here. It's true it's difficult for a guy at wing to get up in the Hawks organization at the moment, but if he's a solid 3rd-4th liner who is willing to play the role provided to him he can make it in the next season or two. Though that does mean he has to learn defense (Q's philosophy is Defense first and while not for everyone it has been successful for our team's makeup), but that's pretty stressed in our system so maybe he'll learn it out in Rockford."

rangers,3bc287,jkant623,19,Sat Jun 27 20:06:43 2015 UTC,F Ryan Haggerty traded to Chicago Blackhawks for G Antti Raanta.
rangers,3bc287,CrowTR2,17,Sat Jun 27 20:08:38 2015 UTC,I like this trade. Raanta is a proven backup. He may not be talbot but he will suit and for a lot less money.
rangers,3bc287,phnxldr,11,Sat Jun 27 20:10:48 2015 UTC,I think working with Lundqvist and our goalie coach can do wonders for him.   In general I like that the Rangers are building up their prospects
rangers,3bc287,Jwpt,6,Sat Jun 27 20:37:10 2015 UTC,"I mean its a decent trade, but they are not building up prospects with this trade. They gave up a promising forward prospect for a backup goaltender who is very unlikely to be resigned after this year."
rangers,3bc287,Lythene-,5,Sun Jun 28 04:58:24 2015 UTC,Was Haggerty really that promising? I thought at this point it looked like he had a long way to go because he's pretty bad defensively.

Unpopular opinion, but his hands are so terrible that it negates his speed and other talents. No joke, I think Tanner Glass has better hands (to an extent and for what he's worth). I'm not hating on Glass, but for the price, you'd think Hags would be better with the puck."

In the the scheme of things--with such a difficult situation to be in--he was unfortunately the least valuable out of the group.

rangers,3bb32y,MikeyRage,25,Sat Jun 27 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"Ducks fan here. I wouldn't use this one play to define Etem. He has been an underachieving prospect that has been a healthy scratch consistently. He does show glimpses of being a very skilled player, but most of the time he is your average 4th liner.  Not trying to burst your bubble, just trying to give you an honest outlook on the guy."
rangers,3bb32y,Squarebush10,13,Sat Jun 27 16:16:59 2015 UTC,Maybe under the different coach and system he will blossom. Guy is only 23. Some of our players became better after Tortorella left and Vigneault came in.

We also got a promising second round pick out of it, and we freed up $3m or so in cap space that can be used on another player. It's too early to tell what we can do with all of the pieces of this trade."
rangers,3bb32y,fuzzyhunter0608,2,Sat Jun 27 17:14:46 2015 UTC,The rangers staff seem to be really good at getting the most out of young prospects though.  If only we could figure out how to get consistency out of the old guys...
rangers,3bb32y,pugwalker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"THIS! Thank you. The guy doesn't have the numbers. You take away Hags, a better player on paper AND a HUGE component of the locker room for someone who like I said previously is a healthy scratch most games."
rangers,3bb32y,wellfuckme_right,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:49:22 2015 UTC,I think it was more the cap crunch that forced the trade and this was the best we could get. I wish we could have  kept Hags tho the consistent speed and effort was amazing. That said I think we undervalued him with this trade big time. Let's just hope the Rangers coaches bring out the numbers from Etem like they did with Miller.
rangers,3bb32y,DAlts4996,0,Mon Jun 29 14:19:27 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Hagelin had 0 NHL games at the same age.  You're really discounting that etem will progress most likely and hags is what he is.

This garbage 4th liner that we got that gets scratched all the time? We have enough of those. And Hags always elevates his game in the playoffs. Our 3rd and 4th lines are always our best in the playoffs.

rangers,3bb273,bu77munch,16,Sat Jun 27 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, we are both going to miss that breakaway speed followed by a slapshot to the chest."
rangers,3bb273,irishguy42,2,Sat Jun 27 15:42:28 2015 UTC,We have Kovacs to do that now. But he likely won't shoot at the chest.
rangers,3bb273,Friscalating123,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:43:20 2015 UTC,Neither does hags. He had more goals this year than etem has had cumulatively over 100 games.  I don't hate the deal but the idea that hagelin can't score is so silly.
rangers,3bb273,Buffalohead_,-2,Sun Jun 28 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but your breaking up chemistry. I think this trade was made to room for another signing or trade, so either it will be for a good trade or a terrible FA signing. Ward for 5.5 AAv for 6 years in good old sather fashion."
rangers,3bb273,Sailor_Chris,6,Sat Jun 27 15:07:29 2015 UTC,It was to open up room to sign Stepan who is way more important than Hagelin

Based on what I'm reading Etem is okay, still hasn't reached his potential but he's 23. Hagelin gets traded to a team that we don't have deal with often except for two regular season games and a possible Stanley cup series.   Bad news is that these two players aren't at the skill level of Hagelin is, and you can't be sure that they will ever be.   As of now you can say the Ducks got the better deal but time will tell of how these two guys develop under the Rangers system and how the Rangers use this available cap space."

rangers,3bd8oe,NashtyHands,8,Mon Jun 29 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"Trades were definitely worth it, IMO.   Traded Talbot for a second and a third, which was more than the Canucks got for Läck.  Got Raanta for a down-the-line wing prospect.  The Hagelin trade may be a sore spot, but we cleared millions in cap space and got in return a promising young forward in Etem. He may be rather streaky, but he is also only 23 and despite his issues with consistency shows flashes of brilliance."
rangers,3bd8oe,James_Caan,3,Sun Jun 28 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"I just wish we traded Talbot for the first rounder, would have been the best action."
rangers,3bd8oe,James_Caan,7,Sun Jun 28 03:38:17 2015 UTC,"The only way we would have gotten a first rounder would have either been with Talbot being a single piece in a bigger trade, or with the Rangers taking on a bad contract. That would have been much worse than the deal we got.  Despite our fan bases' wishes, Sather cannot simply will value into our backup, even if we think he's the best backup there is."

rangers,3bd8oe,Mats_Zuccarello,4,Sun Jun 28 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"Gropp looks promising especially for a mid-2nd rounder.  Kovacs has been described as speedy and a player that enjoys agitating - something missing from our team (like it or not). Additionally, he has been compared to Hags.  Saarela was ranked much higher in the draft earlier in his career but injuries slowed his season down a la Duclair. Could be a steal.  I haven't seen much on Zborovsky or the other 3 prospects but it seems like a good draft for a team without a first round pick."
rangers,3bd8oe,ncolaros,3,Sun Jun 28 03:19:14 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Gropp looks to be a great value pick. His numbers and size indicate someone who could have a really high ceiling in the NHL. Plus, what a name, right?   Saarela is probably gonna be a steal. The only reason he's not high on the draft boards is because of injury, in my opinion. He's a project, but I think he'll be worth it."

rangers,3bd8oe,high5sexwhoa,2,Sun Jun 28 07:49:17 2015 UTC,"Positives: Solid picks. Cleared some much needed cap space to re-sign Stepan and possibly Yandle next year. Got a great return for Tabs. Acquired Rantta Clause for a project who may have never cracked the roster and got Etem, who is young and a similar style of play as Hags with better hands.   Negatives: losing two guys who were loved by the team and our fan base. They will be missed."
rangers,3bb35m,nyrangersgifs,20,Sat Jun 27 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"This draft worked better for us then we think. We were assuming Talbot hags for a first and a prospect. We got a second rounder for hag's and etem, then two Kore seconds and a 3rd for Talbot. So 3 picks in the second and an extra third plus a cheap contract for a talented forward with speed and size. This was the better package they were talking about. Hate to see hags and Talbot go but damn what value Edit: etem not stem"

They expected something that was asinine for Talbot and now are crying and lashing out at Sather. If he hadn't of done this we would have had to pay Hags a number that we simply can't afford. And then everyone would be crying and bitching about that. Especially when re-singing Stepan is priority #1. At the end of the day, you cannot appeaese everyone.

rangers,3bb35m,PhilipK_Dick,3,Sat Jun 27 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"Guys, Talbot is starting goalie material... keeping him on the bench is just going to make him request a trade which means we'd get less for him later on.

rangers,3bb35m,Cubby_Denk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"Guys, Talbot is starting goalie material... keeping him on the bench is just going to make him request a trade which means we'd get less for him later on.

If his salary would be under 3 maybe you can sign him but he doesn't do enough to justify a 3.5 million dollar contract.

rangers,3bbdpr,arise_chicken,0,Sun Jun 28 00:26:58 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but you made sense until Stepan. First off Stepan is by far the best center on this team. Brassard's value is inflated by BDR's monster season brassard's great playoff run. Also Hayes isn't even a natural center and he sucks at faceoffs. Wouldn't surprise me if he replaces marty as a top 2 line RW and JT miller becomes a 3rd/4th line center this year
rangers,3bbdpr,sizeablescars,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"Brassard had a great year and a great playoff, had the top line humming, and was better on faceoffs than Step.   I'm not against Step in any way, but you really think it's an outrageous statement that he might not be the best C on this team? Even from just watching them, they both move the puck well, and get production out of both their lines, but Brass' season is also backed up by stats."

It was either a prospect, Keith Yandle, or they were going to make us take on a bad contract that we can't afford. Sather did the smart thing by not making a dumb deal. If we get two seconds, or even one second, that's cool. If not, we play the season with two starting caliber goalies"

rangers,3bauqq,aceofpayne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"As cool as this would have been, there was no way it could have happened. The reason we couldn't make this trade is the exact reason we traded Hagelin - salary cap. Jimmy Hayes is an RFA - I'm not sure what his qualifier is, but I'm guessing he's due to make ~$2.5-3 mil on this next contract. If we could afford that, we would have just kept Hagelin."

Ill miss hags too but this was probably necessary and if youre asking me to choose between hags and zucc ill pick zucc every time.
rangers,3bb1yt,Jolmer24,4,Sat Jun 27 15:19:56 2015 UTC,Anyone know the deal with Etem? Is he fast? A PKer? Why hasn't he played a full season in the league?
rangers,3bb1yt,jedimasterchief,8,Sat Jun 27 14:45:25 2015 UTC,He's pretty damn fast. Has played PK. He has all the tools but just can't seem to put it all together. He could be a very good player if he could.

rangers,3bbl7n,DicNavis,6,Sat Jun 27 19:35:06 2015 UTC,I expect this year we see Lindberg make the jump
rangers,3bbl7n,MungTongue,4,Sat Jun 27 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"Lindberg's trouble in my opinion is that his style of play is suited for the top three lines, but he can't really earn an opening in those spots very easily."
rangers,3bbl7n,DicNavis,7,Sat Jun 27 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"He is very defensively sound, so could be a helpful duo for D Moore."
rangers,3bbl7n,MungTongue,5,Sat Jun 27 20:59:02 2015 UTC,Fast truly made the jump when he learned to throw his weight in the corners and get his nose dirty.  Both have tremendous vision on both sides of the puck and were effective together in Hartford.  They're very similar players.
rangers,3bbl7n,DicNavis,3,Sat Jun 27 21:15:58 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd like to see Lindberg's 2-way play and faceoff ability make him the 3C, and move Hayes to wing in the top 6, but I doubt that'll happen"
rangers,3bbl7n,brother_of_menelaus,4,Sat Jun 27 21:15:10 2015 UTC,Hayes is so dynamic at center and his size makes him especially valuable if we let him develop at center instead of wing.

rangers,3bbl7n,brother_of_menelaus,2,Sat Jun 27 22:52:17 2015 UTC,His numbers actually turned around in a big way after the all-star break.  He'll never get better unless he is given the opportunity.

Nash - Brass - Zucc Kreds - Step - Fast Hayes - JT - Etem Glass - Moore - Joel Ward   Mac - Danny G  Staal - Yandle  Klein - Boyle  Hank - Enroth (Generic backup)  I'm not ruling out a trade for the FA period. I don't want Nash to be traded but it wouldn't be uncharacteristic of Sather to make a random blockbuster move. I don't know too much about Etem but I know he's got some offensive upside so I'll throw him on the 3rd line. I think the Rangers will go after a big 4th liner (Insert Joel Ward because he might be able to fit under the cap). Lastly, i think the rangers will sign a decent backup and it'll be someone like Jhonas Enroth."

We got offered a 1st and also 2 2nds and he accepts this shit!  Sorry Sather, but today, You Fucked Up!"
rangers,3bbl7n,5cotland,12,Sat Jun 27 17:43:24 2015 UTC,We definitely couldn't have kept Hagelin if we wanted to keep Kreider next year too. And its become abundantly clear that those other trades were never real. They were made up by Sather and co. to drum up interest.

rangers,3bbl7n,emildickson,2,Sat Jun 27 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"That trade is to have the best line up possible this year, but to have the best line up possible over the next 3-5 years. Hagelin costs too much. We needed to replace him. Better players like Step, Kreider, Yandle, Miller, and Hayes will all need extension."
rangers,3bbl7n,jedimasterchief,4,Sat Jun 27 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think Fast's performance in the Playoffs really got things going; though might be more of Marty's replacement, but with the PK assets. I guess because of all of that + fact his contract is and will be far more cap friendly...it was probably better to keep him than Hags. Plus, I think we knew in the beginning of the year that our wingers were kind of stacked + Staal's extension made things a little more difficult.   My only concern is that we'll still see some cap-space moves. Brooks mentioned this tweet which is a bit disconcerting.    So NYR just under $58.1...Have about $13.3M to sign backup G, Stepan, Etem, Miller, Fast, add another F or two and a seventh D."

rangers,3bb4o7,TweetsInCommentsBot,11,Sat Jun 27 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"Appearently, Hags is similar to Robin Kovacs, who we just drafted.  Edi: drafted, not traded."
rangers,3bb4o7,emildickson,7,Sat Jun 27 15:16:21 2015 UTC,So we drafted a prospect who may one day be good enough to replace Hags?
rangers,3bb4o7,SanguisFluens,3,Sat Jun 27 16:07:31 2015 UTC,Wh knows? But let's just hope so.
rangers,3bb4o7,emildickson,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:16:07 2015 UTC,Jesper Fast is the replacement for hags. He's shown to be an excellent pk man with very good skating and hockey sense. Only difference is Fast has real hands whereas Hags' held him back from being a consistent top6 player
rangers,3bb4o7,Calad,14,Mon Jun 29 15:06:10 2015 UTC,Duclair is the only blue chip prospect we traded. Stepan needs to get paid. 3 picks for Talbot straight up is robbery.
rangers,3bb4o7,HeadForTheSHallows,6,Sat Jun 27 15:12:14 2015 UTC,Yeah it is. Sather has done well
rangers,3bb4o7,Sailor_Chris,4,Sat Jun 27 15:44:15 2015 UTC,Hags was my moms favorite i can't break the news to her :(
rangers,3bb4o7,NYRule1994,7,Sat Jun 27 16:10:39 2015 UTC,There were too many red flags with Duclair. After being sent down from the NHL he was a healthy scratch for a couple games with Quebec. A sign he didn't have the right attitude for a team competing for a cup. He will do well in Arizona but they are a a ways away from being relevant.
rangers,3bb4o7,77Columbus,6,Sat Jun 27 15:48:28 2015 UTC,Duclair was a great prospect. The only reason he was traded is because we needed to win and Sather thought that would be the best approach.
rangers,3bb4o7,thehockeychimp,6,Sat Jun 27 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"His junior coach, Roy, skipped over him 3 times in the draft. I feel like that speaks to how good he can be."

rangers,3bb4o7,Enzo95,21,Sat Jun 27 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"All of these trades were necessary. Hagelin wanted too much money, and with Kreider and Yandle close to free agency, we needed space. We stockpiled picks to secure our future without gutting our present."

rangers,3bb4o7,Nether_Ending,-9,Sat Jun 27 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"Cup final appearances are nothing if you arent the WINNER. Actually it's bad, cause you draft last but one. The bigger the tree, the bigger the fall.   Oh well who cares? We're going nowhere next season again. Not good enough to win the cup, not bad enough to draft high. It's a limbo.   P.S. Downvote all you want, I'm not losing money with downvotes. Also, I have the right to be pissed at Sather's stupid trades. It's a free country."

rangers,3bb4o7,callmesnake13,-6,Sat Jun 27 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"Talbot, Klein or Hags for Jimmy Hayes."
rangers,3bb4o7,Enzo95,3,Sat Jun 27 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Hayes was only on the table for Talbot, what we got for Talbot is a better situation. Jimmy Hayes is up for renewal as an RFA, and he'd probably want more money than Hagelin did. It's a lot easier to criticize Sather when you get to imagine trade possibilities."
rangers,3bb4o7,callmesnake13,3,Sat Jun 27 16:23:46 2015 UTC,Good job GM. If we lose next year then we are exactly like the devils and have absolutely no good prospects in the system.
rangers,3bb4o7,FLRangerFan,-5,Sat Jun 27 17:08:18 2015 UTC,"We lost the finals two seasons ago and we dont have an exactly rich situation with prospects now. Also gave up two 1st rounders for a guy we dont have anymore.   I dont think I would be a worst GM than Sather is.   P.S. When you say ""if we lose next year"" are you talking about the Cup? Because the if you're talking about the Cup, the correct to say is WHEN not IF. Yes, we're not winning it next year again."
rangers,3bb4o7,Enzo95,2,Sat Jun 27 17:16:07 2015 UTC,I don't see your point. You agree we have a depleted prospect pool. So you want to continue depleting it by not getting picks and getting Jimmy Hayes?
rangers,3bb4o7,FLRangerFan,-3,Sat Jun 27 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"But we are on winning mode now, right? So what's the point on giving up a proven asset (Talbot) for picks, when you can get a proven young stud like Jimmy Hayes? Only to get middle of the pack prospects who in the best case scenario will take two, three years to develop? Just to have a prospect pool? What are the odds of one of them becoming a steal like a Lundqvist or a Datsyuk? Very slim. What are the odds this kids will really turn into solid NHLers?  That's my point. Even if we had to give some picks along with Hags or Klein for Jimmy it'd be worth it. Now we have half dozen prospects that cant contribute right now.   The Rangers, at the moment, are much more weaker than it was in our last game against the Bolts."
rangers,3bb4o7,Enzo95,0,Sat Jun 27 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not happy we lost cambot. Especially after he was more than clutch while Hank was out...I feel like he earned a place on our roster for the foreseeable future. BUT  As long as Hank is around, which should be a while yet, Talbot is never going to get the spotlight so on a personal level I'm happy for him (kinda). He'll probably start for Edmonton and by the grace of the hockey gods MAYBE make them a competitive team.  On the other hand, we gained Raanta, and I can't yet see a reason to be upset with that. Time will tell (read: please don't get hurt, Hank).  The Hagelin move is still kinda leaving my mind blown. Sather has a cap to meet, and I get that, but there HAD to be a better way than losing Hags. Banter aside, I'm going to be really fucking angry when our PK sucks ice this season. Because we DEFINITELY don't have a PP going for us.  At the end of the day though? We've made trades in the past which, at the time, made no sense. We traded 2015 Eastern Conference Champion Ryan Callahan (who I'll remind you was our team captain at the time) who didn't really produce in the finals this year. We mistakenly (in retrospect) traded away Anton Stralman who has become the best defensemen in the league.  TL;DR Let's wait till the shit hits the fan before we declare that we smell some crap."
rangers,3bb4o7,acalltoarms1087,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:50:58 2015 UTC,Anton stralman is far from the best defenseman in the league.

rangers,3b7oso,Caltex88,2,Fri Jun 26 17:49:19 2015 UTC,"Klein an Talbot for a top 12 pick this year? That's very, very tempting, especially with the potential in this year's draft. There's a chance Barzal, or Zacha would be available as late as 12. Meier and Gurianov almost certainly will be available then. I like Gurianov a lot. He's big, has a great shot, can snipe from just about anywhere with a dman on him because of his size and reach. Meier is a little smaller I think but also has a great shot.  If we by some miracle got a pick that high this year, we have a chance at drafting a future all-star. I mean, with a pick that high, worst case is like Konecny or Bittner. This draft is stacked. I would be pumped as shit for a first rounder that high, and I think it would definitely be worth Cam and Klein.  Edit: well, that didn't happen. And apparently everybody's much lower on Bittner than I assumed. Konecny was a damn steal that late, though. Probably thanks to Boston fisting themselves with a couple guys who would have still been there in the second round."

No way they give up a giant third liner and a legendary second/third line mentor to their young guys for a backup, especially when they have Brittain and Houser coming up between the pipes.   Talbot is a great goalie, but the goalie market is very much over saturated, and he is not worth nearly what this sub thinks he is.  Also, we already had Jagr, and I wouldn't want $3 million spent on another slow old guy who doesn't fit our system."
rangers,3b9b7q,James_Caan,2,Sat Jun 27 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"Luongo is going to be 37 next year.  Talbot is 27. How many years does Luongo have left?  The Jagr comment was facetious, though a decent price to bring in the Hayes brother.  Talbot has been solid for us during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 seasons. Why are you selling the Rangers short here, especially if trading a good goalie in the same conference?"
rangers,3b9b7q,calvin43,3,Sat Jun 27 05:21:03 2015 UTC,"Luongo is still a really good goalie, though, and by the time he retires, and the Panthers young core has developed, Talbot will be in his early 30s. Talbot is a good, dependable goalie, but you need to look at the perspective of Florida's management. Why buy high with a good roster player when they can look to acquire the younger, more experienced Lack, or the even younger Raanta or Jones.   I'm not selling Talbot short, I'm just expressing the reality of the trade climate and the availability of players. Jimmy Hayes is young, huge, talented, and is an RFA. There is zero chance Florida would throw away his presence for the chance of one of many older starters down the road."
rangers,3b9b7q,James_Caan,3,Sat Jun 27 05:53:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone was offering a 2015 first rounder. I believe it was a 2016, which he should still go for"
rangers,3b9b7q,jedimasterchief,3,Sat Jun 27 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"i dont think this is such a bad thing. there are teams still hungry for a goalie, his trade value still has an A rating.  i could be wrong and i'll happily discuss this with anyone, but i think these draft picks, except for the two vunderkinds this year, are a little overrated. especially the way this team is now, i'd much rather get a 24-28 year old playing in shoot-to-kill mode than an 18 year old who still needs a few seasons to get his game together."
rangers,3b9b7q,patton66,2,Sat Jun 27 03:56:27 2015 UTC,I honestly think what will happen now is they will wait.  Let free agency happen.  See where they stand and try trade him for a good player at spot the need.

rangers,3b965a,SMIRTLE,8,Sat Jun 27 00:10:31 2015 UTC,I'm getting nervous too. I don't want to miss out on all of the talent in this draft.
rangers,3b965a,mattypong,10,Sat Jun 27 00:15:56 2015 UTC,This what we paid for MSL.
rangers,3b965a,PhilipK_Dick,6,Sat Jun 27 00:34:48 2015 UTC,IIRC one of the picks was conditional and it would become a first if we made it to the finals which we did.
rangers,3b965a,mattypong,6,Sat Jun 27 00:36:38 2015 UTC,Yup...  And we got back a second rounder this year because Cally signed.  We then shipped that and next years first rounder to Phoenix for Yandle and his reduced contract...
rangers,3b965a,PhilipK_Dick,2,Sat Jun 27 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"And all it has gotten us are the best two Rangers seasons in 20 years. Relax guys, Sather is a good GM."

I guess I'm a little bummed with how MSL turned out and it always sucks toot have anything on day one of the draft - esp 3 years in a row...
rangers,3b965a,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:33:55 2015 UTC,My big concern with MSL is that he's suddenly going to come back strong next year. With a player his age you've got to err on the side of caution though...
rangers,3b965a,callmesnake13,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:38:35 2015 UTC,I doubt it.  He had every chance to produce last year and seemed to noticeably slow down as the year progressed - to the point that he wasn't the same player by the playoffs.  He will have good games here and there but I will be surprised if he is more than .6 PPG (and you know he will pout if he doesn't get tons of PP time and offensive zone starts)
rangers,3b965a,PhilipK_Dick,2,Sat Jun 27 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"I think we're all just hoping for Jagr, MSL, and Chara on the Panthers."

I was there the night before working a gig, wearing my conference champions hat with Marty's number sewn on the side with absolute pride. Wearing rangers gear in there was my favorite thing to do, but I knew I needed a little more good juju for the game the next day. As I was leaving, I was able to knock on the goals for good luck.

rangers,3b74ef,Enzo95,2,Fri Jun 26 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"...I mean, our 2013 draft we had no 1st or 2nd round picks and so far the players we drafted are looking solid. Tambellini is maturing and had a solid season and should see time with the Wolfpack, Buchnevich is almost guaranteed a spot on the team in 2016, and Duclair looks like he's gonna be a star...it sucks we lost him but I imagine Yandle with another year will be solid. Then we took Ryan Graves who continues to make GIGANTIC strides and finally Mackenzie Skapski who we have all seen.   Our draft last season it's still a bit hard to tell but again -- no first round picks. So far Halverson and Shesterkin are looking great. We'll get a better idea on the other picks over the next year.  The Rangers scouting team has done an insanely good job with the picks we've had and I'm expecting no less this year. Yes, I would LOVE to get a first round pick for Talbot, but if we can manage 2-3 second round picks or 2 second rounders and something else...I'll be just as happy."

rangers,3b5ux1,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Fri Jun 26 17:00:57 2015 UTC,Yeah if he can ever stay on his feet. Seems to trip over the blue line at least once a game
rangers,3b5ux1,neeners9223,7,Fri Jun 26 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I love it, but I also love the shootout, even though the Rangers struggled in that department last season."
rangers,3b5ux1,PlatinumPancake,4,Fri Jun 26 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not crazy about it. The Swedish Hockey League implemented this last season (right in the middle of it too, for some reason) and I don't think it was very well recieved. But who knows, maybe it'll be awesome. I was hoping they would go for the AHL model of 4v4 and then 3v3, but I guess they didn't want to make the games longer.  If it makes more games end in OT then that's great, but we can't know thay it will do that. Everybody's sending around that clip of the Devils and Kings playing 3v3 OT and it does look pretty fun, but the goal in that OT period comes when the penalties end and Jagr comes shooting out of the penalty box, so there's really no way to say that that game ended because of the 3v3.  But it's here now wether we want it or not so I guess we just have to watch and enjoy!"
rangers,3b5ux1,emildickson,4,Fri Jun 26 07:15:07 2015 UTC,"I also would've liked to see 4v4 and then 3v3 but apparently the players union was very against it, since it adds so many more minutes of ice time and makes players more at risk for injuries.  I think it'll be fun to watch and decrease the number of shootouts (which seems like a good thing)."
rangers,3b5ux1,Harkeshark,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:57:43 2015 UTC,Does this apply to the playoffs?
rangers,3b5ux1,emildickson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"No, not the playoffs."
rangers,3b5ux1,illkwill,5,Fri Jun 26 17:06:45 2015 UTC,I'm all for it if it will prevent more games being decided by a shootout.
rangers,3b5ux1,joeybriggs,2,Fri Jun 26 09:35:34 2015 UTC,I think it is making a silly situation even sillier. there is no good way to end certain sports in a swift matter of time. I thought 4-4 plus a shootout with the loser point was the best bad scenario we could ask for. I think 3 v 3 is as much as a gimmick as the shootout is.
rangers,3b5ux1,ncolaros,2,Fri Jun 26 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"As much a gimmick? I mean, let's be realistic here. There's still passing, defense, blocked shots, penalties, etc. This is still hockey. The shootout is not hockey."
rangers,3b5ux1,ToughTalkingHoodBoy,2,Fri Jun 26 21:38:01 2015 UTC,Watched it all year in the AHL. It's very exciting and decreases shootouts tremendously
rangers,3b5ux1,SMIRTLE,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:43:51 2015 UTC,Didn't we have a brief 3 on 3 OT due to penalties at one point this season?
rangers,3b5ux1,Ben_Ulrand,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:32:24 2015 UTC,Yeah but it lasted like 2 seconds i think
rangers,3b5ux1,nylawman21,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"I thought it was going to be 4v4 followed by 3v3 if necessary.  Granted, I think the extra open ice will really suit our style, though"
rangers,3b5ux1,fosiacat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:54:25 2015 UTC,About a year ago I had a chance to speak with Brian Leetch at a season subscriber event and asked him his thoughts on 3-on-3 overtime.  He was not in favor.  His view (which I agree with) was that teams would play conservatively and keep two guys at the blue line in the offensive zone.  The effect would be lots of 1v2 battles (not exciting).
rangers,3b5ux1,shane727,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:41:09 2015 UTC,anything to get away from the fucking shootout.
rangers,3b5ux1,NavinRJohnson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:18:02 2015 UTC,"Well I don't like shootouts deciding games even though they can be very exciting, but I also don't think I like this either. I just wish they would have kept the old system and maybe added 1 more OT period to give them a chance to win it with a goal and then go to shootout."
rangers,3b5ux1,pejede,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:26:36 2015 UTC,This would end up being boring since both sides would protect and wait for the point.  I suggest that they go 4 on 3 for a minute then 3 on 4 for a minute and keep this up until someone scores. Then give the other team a minute to try and match the goal. If they can't - game over.

rangers,3b3r59,EZE16lg,2,Thu Jun 25 19:39:24 2015 UTC,I'm heading to the University of Delaware. The closest arena is Philly. So I might suffer some serious rangers withdrawal.

rangers,3b9vku,willdawgs31,10,Sat Jun 27 04:22:08 2015 UTC,Yeah bring back someone who hasn't played in the past 5 years or has a desire to play. I l like Avery as a hockey player but a lot of Rangers fans have this weird obsession with the guy like he had a Conn Smythe and Stanley Cup to his name here
rangers,3b9vku,bu77munch,0,Sat Jun 27 04:43:28 2015 UTC,Honestly I feel like Avery with 5 years of rust is still an improvement over Glass
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,7,Sat Jun 27 13:11:52 2015 UTC,Well you are wrong.
rangers,3b9vku,bu77munch,-2,Sat Jun 27 13:14:08 2015 UTC,Glass is awful by literally every metric of player performance except hits
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Sat Jun 27 13:16:24 2015 UTC,"He's still in the NHL. Avery was average in hockey skill. 5 years removed from the league, he'd be terrible."
rangers,3b9vku,bu77munch,0,Sat Jun 27 13:18:20 2015 UTC,Yeah John Scott is still in the NHL too. If that's your way of determining skill then idk what to tell you.
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,0,Sat Jun 27 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"The thread is about Avery, not about the worst NHL players in the league. There is always going to be somebody who is the worst player in the league, and replacing them with someone who hasn't played for 5 years who wasn't a game changing talent doesn't affect us at all. The guy isn't making a comeback and if he came back to the Rangers tomorow he doesn't make this team any better. This thread is stupid."
rangers,3b9vku,bu77munch,0,Sat Jun 27 13:26:55 2015 UTC,"Well no shit, he's not actually coming back. And yeah he's not a game changing talent but he was an excellent 3rd/4th liner. Arguably better than anyone on our current 4th line (except maybe Moore). A 5 year absence would mean that he wouldn't be a good but I honestly think he'd still be better than Glass."
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:33:50 2015 UTC,And yet again I'd say you are wrong.
rangers,3b9vku,bu77munch,3,Sat Jun 27 13:35:07 2015 UTC,I enjoy the thought. I loved watching Avery just getting in guys faces with his 'fuck you' attitude.
rangers,3b9vku,nicholasg88,2,Sat Jun 27 04:25:13 2015 UTC,God I miss Avery....I bet he would still be playing if it wasn't torts coaching him back then.
rangers,3b9vku,AgentZeroGA,4,Sat Jun 27 13:32:42 2015 UTC,I'm one of the Ranger fans who couldn't stand Avery. I only started watching in his second to last season but I couldn't stand him. Could've been influenced from reporters but he just seemed like a jerk to me.
rangers,3b9vku,PlatinumPancake,2,Sat Jun 27 05:10:35 2015 UTC,Read his last article of being a post player. His on ice personality will make a lot more sense to understand.
rangers,3b9vku,MungTongue,-1,Sat Jun 27 05:56:09 2015 UTC,That article was pathetic.  He's so full of himself and greatly delusional about his skill as a player and what his role was on the team. He talks about himself like he's fucking Wayne Gretzky.
rangers,3b9vku,adamrobertt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:11:16 2015 UTC,Loved Avery on the ice.

rangers,3b9vku,adamrobertt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:10:17 2015 UTC,If you think Avery was talentless you're honestly a moron
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was really lighting it up with his career high 15 goals.  What a banner year.    If it wasn't for his antics and the Roy fiasco, no  one would be talking about him right now.  He's a nobody aside from that shit."
rangers,3b9vku,adamrobertt,-2,Sat Jun 27 13:12:40 2015 UTC,Obviously he's not fucking Sidney Crosby but he's arguably better than any of our current 4th liners besides Moore and he could probably slot in on most teams' 3rd line and do well also.     Also lol at using goals as your only metric of good play. I bet you think Nash had a terrible playoff run this year.
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:15:39 2015 UTC,Nope. Rick Nash is an incredible player and one of our best. Avery was a fucking chump. I'm amazed that anyone would defend that cumblast.
rangers,3b9vku,adamrobertt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:19:36 2015 UTC,"Probably because he was good when he wasn't doing silly shit on the ice    Also I don't get people who hate Avery, they act like he ended someone's career. All he did was chirp people a lot at fuck around."
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"I hate him because he had no class, no sportsmanship, and no respect for the game or his teammates. The league does not need players like him. I hated having him on our team. If he scored 40 goals a year or something maybe I'd have been ok with it. Maybe."
rangers,3b9vku,adamrobertt,0,Sat Jun 27 13:33:48 2015 UTC,no class   lol    Get over yourself dude. I really don't care that he acted like an asshole when he played. He was a great bottom six player and if Torts hadn't run him out of town and he was still on the team now we'd have a better team than we currently have.
rangers,3b9vku,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:37:06 2015 UTC,Ok Sean.

rangers,3b5iuq,PhilipK_Dick,2,Fri Jun 26 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"Too bad we traded away duclair, he'll be big one day"
rangers,3b5iuq,SteamHole,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:53:43 2015 UTC,"Or not.  In all fairness, we traded him at his highest value.  The one thing I think about regarding him is that he made it to the 3rd round and his juniors coach was Patrick Roy who had 3 chances to draft him.  Maybe there is something to that?"
rangers,3b5iuq,Thugable,2,Fri Jun 26 19:20:48 2015 UTC,There should be a serious rule against tanking and getting the top pick year after year. Edmonton is being given wayyyyy too much and now they magically landed first choice. The Gretzky years are over for them they have to get over it and stop squandering all of this top pick talent.
rangers,3b5iuq,SteamHole,2,Fri Jun 26 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"Well, they had 9 Hall of Famers on 1 team. They have to relive the legend somehow."
rangers,3b5iuq,emildickson,2,Fri Jun 26 22:26:09 2015 UTC,I do wonder what would've happened if Gretzky was never traded. They probably would have won two or three more cups it's just unbelievable.

rangers,3b2lpn,tonyprent22,2,Thu Jun 25 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"exactly.  I assume it's showing that Lundqvist has been in the top voting every year of his career.  While that is impressive, I don't find it interesting to note that it's a historic decade for him.  I don't understand, however, how the best goaltender in the league has only won it once.  What do they take into consideration for that trophy? It can't be just save percentage, right?"

rangers,3b2zyv,Sockittoum,6,Thu Jun 25 16:52:47 2015 UTC,Do you think he'd be willing to sign an extension in Edmonton? I guess if he's the true #1 goalie with a young core around him he could  be convinced. They have to get better eventually.
rangers,3b2zyv,berdman11,8,Thu Jun 25 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think so, especially if they're going to pay him. Only 30 starting jobs out there...can't see him going somewhere and trying to earn one of those jobs all season, only to walk at the end of the year to try to find another one."

Toronto is much more like New York than it is like Edmonton. Here they are on a map just to give you an idea of differences in temperature, in addition to the difference in population.   edit: actually just looked and he is further out of Toronto than I'd imagined. Kind of like Suffolk County to  NYC. That said, the north south disparity between Edmonton and Toronto is the same as between Toronto and South Carolina."
rangers,3b2zyv,bcgrm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:31:27 2015 UTC,Temperature I cant speak to but players want to play in Pittsburgh which I have been to and will try never to go back to.  Players want to win and get payed.  A player like Talbot will have money as a driving force since he hasn't earned anything yet as a 28 year old.  He will go where he can get the best contract IMO.  Playing with a generational talent doesn't hurt the equation either...
rangers,3b2zyv,PhilipK_Dick,2,Thu Jun 25 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, agreed--I'm just saying it won't be because he's a country boy or anything. Even though he is the goaltending pride of the great state of Alabama."
rangers,3b3o2d,thehockeychimp,12,Thu Jun 25 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"After the 2013-2014 cup run I was so sure he was solidifying his place as a top 10 or even top 5 defender, but I was underwhelmed with his play most of this past season.  Maybe I expected too much, but nonetheless I see him as at least a top 15 guy."
rangers,3b3o2d,superchronics,6,Thu Jun 25 21:44:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I have to agree. I was so astounded by his play last season, he was absolutely everywhere on the ice, solid, decent offense.  This year he was still one of the best, but he definitely looked like he regressed, wasn't quite as aggressive in the neutral zone, and was more inclined to make poor turnovers."
rangers,3b3o2d,eipark,3,Fri Jun 26 02:56:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. I wonder how much of that was injury related and how much was due to the fact that he partners with the biggest anchor in the league.
rangers,3b3o2d,brother_of_menelaus,5,Fri Jun 26 11:54:19 2015 UTC,Probably Top 15. I like this list: http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=729524

rangers,3b3o2d,MikeyRage,2,Thu Jun 25 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"I think he gets underrated because he is not as big an offensive force as some of the other big name d-men. But he certainly is in elite company when it comes to defending, which is what counts from a d-man, and leadership."

rangers,3b2xx6,G-Dad,3,Thu Jun 25 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"Stubhub is your best bet. Wait until tickets are actually released however, around October time. Prices will fluctuate depending on standings and whatnot.   A common strategy is to wait until a day before or the day of the game to buy tickets, since prices might come down. However, Saturday afternoon games (especially those vs a division rival) are always going to be in high demand. So expect to pay around that price. Again though, wait till the tickets are actually come out."

rangers,3azrag,sketchymike90,54,Fri Jun 26 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"Welcome to NYC.   Some pointers:   You should never be in the Bronx. Unless you're at a Yankees game.  Little Italy in Manhattan is a pure tourist trap, and home to ZERO Italians. And awful Italian food.  Chinatown is not a tourist trap, is home to what seems like every Chinese person ever born, and has amazing Chinese food.  Never (EVER) accept a CD from a guy on the street. He's not a struggling singer, the CDs are blank and he will accost you.  We have a street named Houston. It is NOT pronounced like the city in Texas.  Avoid all Times Square Elmos, Buzz LightYears, Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?) and various other costumed miscreants. They are all hardened criminals.  Never buy a MetroCard swipe from someone. They take your money and run faster than Usain Bolt.  A can of soda in Manhattan costs $3. You just accept this as normal.  Anyone from the following locations in Brooklyn: Bushwick, Crown Heights, Greenpoint, Long Island City, Park Slope or Carroll Gardens is NOT a native New Yorker and was probably born in Iowa. Also - they are 100% hipster. No exceptions.  People from the following locations in Brooklyn: Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Coney Island and Gravesend are native New Yorkers, were born in Brooklyn and HATE the other areas of Brooklyn.  Sometimes, you'll walk down the street in the summer and smell something so bad, it literally buckles your knees. It may be the sewer. It may be the guy standing next to you. You'll never be sure.  You will encounter someone from New Jersey. I'm sorry.  There are rats in the Subway tunnels. Don't stare at them - they will stare back and intimidate you.  Taxis are yellow in Manhattan and Green in Brooklyn. Why? Fuck you, that's why.  You have to go out of your way to find truly bad pizza.    Those are the basics. There's a steep learning curve - but, it is seriously the greatest city on the planet."

Also you can easily get a bottled water or big cans of Arizona Iced Tea for a dollar, rather than paying three bucks for a Soda. Go into any Walgreens or Duane Reade. Same with some Pizza places like 2bros for a quick bite to eat.  Another notes off the top of my head.  Don't get into conversations with anyone handing stuff out or asking for things. Just keep walking.  Don't walk slow, if you have to check your phone or stop do what you would do if you were driving and pull over.  If you are a fast walker but is in a sea of tourists, and slow walkers, walk on the bus lane, just make sure there are no oncoming Buses.

rangers,3azrag,blueshirtdave,3,Thu Jun 25 11:44:48 2015 UTC,"This is a solid list, so I just have a couple additions:     Despite what you may have heard, living in NYC is not necessarily going to destroy your wallet.  Rent is more expensive for sure, but with rare exceptions, I've found that it's very affordable if you you're patient and know where to look for things.  There's a LOT of free things to do as well: http://www.nycgo.com/free   Once you know where your job is, where your residence is, and where the nearest subway station/bus stop is, become familiar with at least 2-3 or more other ways to get where you're going.  Subway lines can experience delays, shutdowns, or re-reroutes, and sometimes with little or no notice.  Download an app like Embark or NextStop, and use them religiously.   We're generally nice people, unless you a) piss us off, b) are obviously a tourist and get in our way (see part a), or do stupid things on the subway (see part a again)   Always use the right side of the stairs.  Every time, no matter where you're going.  Now, once you're on the right side, know that the left portion of the right side is where the fast lane is.  Move quick or stay to the right portion.   Let people off the subway car before you barge onto it.  In fact, get familiar with all the etiquette signs in subway cars.  They may seem hilarious at times, but if you abuse them, someone WILL call you out on it.   Get familiar with the parks asap.  They're wonderful here, and are just about your only chances to get anything relatively close to privacy outside of your residence.   Become accustomed to being bumped into, gently pushed aside, and generally coming into contact with lots of people, daily.  We're all in a hurry, and there's not enough space for everyone on the sidewalk.  It's nothing personal, but it's something I wasn't initially prepared for.  After a while though, you hardly notice, since you're likely doing it as well.   When you're wanting to go out for a night and grab some dinner and drinks, pick a neighborhood to explore, as opposed to narrowing it down to a specific restaurant or pub.  My best finds have been through not having a plan and walking around until something caught my eye.  That's how you get to know the city, as opposed to living off Yelp reviews. I live in Queens and each neighborhood here has it's own cultural identity, so you can visit and really get a feel for their character.   If you're buying beverages in can form, be aware of the bottle deposit tax: http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/usa/newyork.htm"
rangers,3azrag,runninhillbilly,2,Thu Jun 25 13:16:25 2015 UTC,"Number 4 is a cringe for me.  I went to the city for a day with my friend once and when walking down the street I basically got shoved INTO a guy that was doing this CD thing, so I basically had no choice but to accept his CD, and I threw him $3 or whatever to make him shut up.  Still have the CD, haven't listened to it yet, felt like such a damn tourist. But anyway, welcome to New York OP.

It's affordable, close-by to everything you need, and I can get anywhere in middle/lower Manhattan much quicker than people who actually LIVE in Manhattan north of Central Park.  Also, the R/M/E lines are FAR less crowded than riding the damn 4/5/6 or 1/2/3 lines (depending on which side you're on).     I look at it like Vegas.  You want to be able to visit Vegas often, but you don't want to live there.  So you live in Henderson NV, a short 10-15 min drive away.

rangers,3aycix,EarnSquirm,24,Wed Jun 24 14:13:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hagelin's speed is such a disruptive factor that the drop from him to replacement 3rd line winger is much steeper than the drop from Klein to replacement. Having him and Kreider on two different lines keeps the opposing teams' defenses on their heels half the time. I would much rather keep Hags around than Klein. Additionally, I think it would hurt the team from a personal standpoint as Brass, Zucc and Hags are basically best friends."
rangers,3aycix,brother_of_menelaus,7,Wed Jun 24 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"Well detailed thought out and entirely plausible. Comes down to Klein or Hagelin. I've made my peace with Talbot leaving (He deserves to be a starter after this season and I wish him all the best. Where ever he ends up is instantly my second favorite team).   So........ uhhhh...... (closes eyes and points)..... scenario A. Hate to see Klein go but we did okay while he was gone mid season and we have Yandle at least. plus it gives us a bigger cap cushion (Granted only 25,000 worth but still more). Thoughts anyone?"
rangers,3aycix,aceofpayne,4,Wed Jun 24 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"This article was impressively well written, from cap logistics to linemates, I thoroughly enjoyed the read... hats off to whomever wrote this!  On the other hand, I do hate to see any of our Broadway guys leave the team, but I understand the predicament we are in. Regardless, I think there are a few players on the non-trade/move list who are really setting this scenario back, specifically Dan Boyle, whose performance this season was lack luster at best in my opinion"
rangers,3aycix,TheRonBurgundy,6,Wed Jun 24 16:40:54 2015 UTC,I still can't believe we're paying Boyle $4.5M.

rangers,3aycix,tubaisetamere,3,Thu Jun 25 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"One other thing the article missed pertaining to Hagelin or Klein:  If Hagelin files for arbitration, he cannot be traded. If he actually goes to an arbitration hearing, he cannot be traded for 1 year if Rangers accept arbitration ruling (which they will have to 99.9% of the time).   Klein on the other hand, can be traded at any time no matter what all summer.  So if Hagelin is traded, it'll be within 10 days. If Klein is traded, it could be anytime the next 3 months."
rangers,3aycix,Snurrehus,2,Wed Jun 24 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"Or the Rangers could sign-and-trade Hagelin. Even if he files for arbitration, as long as a deal was struck before the ruling, and there are no NTC/NMC's... Hagelin could be signed-and-traded at any point up to the ruling"

Personally, I can't see this deal happening, but at the same time I can. Yandle is a great D man, absolutely a top 4, but with our Cap issues I don't know if he'll be on the team this time next year. We gave up a ton for him, so it would suck if he walked after 1.5 seasons, but if hes too expensive we might as well try to shop him.   As for Lucic, well, I'd hate to have him on the team, but he would definitely fill a need of grinding winger who can at least score occasionally. Lucic's salary is 6 million, so any deal with him will have to retain 50% cap.      A confusing offer, but I guess both Yandle and Klein are on the block. Rangers must really have some confidence in their young D men."
rangers,3b0vz7,NashtyHands,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:59 2015 UTC,Lucic is a player you hate to play but love to have. I would not be opposed to this.

I will never forgive Slats for signing Brashear, by the way."

He had a pretty good playoffs from what I hear, but i wonder if hes ready for the next step. Only time will tell.   As for the enforcers...some work, some don't. Its a very tricky thing. I think Carcillo worked out considering the price (low round pick IIRC), but we shouldn't reach for these guys unless they can score, I agree. Still, we do need some toughness, and Lucic can score."

Not to mention, he'd be third in the pecking order behind Nash, Kreider, and Swagelin at LW.  And that's assuming Glass is traded or is a scratch.  So we'd be paying $3 million (assuming they keep half his contract), to put him on the 4th line.  Don't see that happening at all.  In addition, if we bumped him up to 3rd line and didn't trade Swags, then all that speed goes to the 4th line, and is rarely used.  None of it makes any sense."

Trapezoid, crease, two-line pass rules were never even a thought for these prospects.   As much as I hate to say it, but the rangers tendency to give away picks is probably going to bite them in the ass soon."
rangers,3aw0lh,Fagical,0,Wed Jun 24 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"It'd be harder to get one of those straight out of the draft, considering they may not be NHL ready.  On the other hand if we can get someone like Nugent - Hopkins/Eberle from Edmonton through a Talbot trade, that could immediately benefit the team. I don't know how plausible that would be, but that's a possibility."
rangers,3aw0lh,lionson76,2,Wed Jun 24 01:53:31 2015 UTC,Not very plausible.
rangers,3aw0lh,profchaos2001,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:08:08 2015 UTC,"Like the other posters, any trade for EDM top 6 forwards is implausible. winning the lottery just gave them the win now approach a la toews/kane in chicago. Talbot is not a proven goalie, especially in the playoffs. No way a package of talbot and whatever gets us RNH / Eberle. And I dont even want eberle. Seems like a disaster"
rangers,3aw0lh,domspart,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:18:17 2015 UTC,"Well, the consensus of the GM's around the league is that Cam Talbot is a starting caliber goalie."
rangers,3aw0lh,xxdarksyde73xx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:41:02 2015 UTC,I'd even take Hall or Yak tbh.. Edmonton has so much wasted talent just ripe for the picking
rangers,3aw0lh,lionson76,11,Wed Jun 24 03:03:38 2015 UTC,Hall is one of the best LWs in the league. He's not going anywhere.
rangers,3aw0lh,xxdarksyde73xx,-2,Wed Jun 24 03:06:35 2015 UTC,Hall was on the block at deadline because of his mouth and his injuries. I feel like talbot/hall could happen with draft picks and prospects involved
rangers,3aw0lh,lionson76,3,Wed Jun 24 03:15:59 2015 UTC,"He was only ""available"" for a ridiculous package of players and picks. In other words, not at all available."

rangers,3avdyu,imaknife,2,Wed Jun 24 01:50:49 2015 UTC,what's the difference between no trade and no movement?
rangers,3au51z,ryaninspace,39,Tue Jun 23 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"Hot damn, Sather is going for that 1st round pick, hop on board the Wild Ride!"
rangers,3au51z,bonesingyre,30,Tue Jun 23 15:13:30 2015 UTC,McDavid for Cambot Hype Train now boarding.
rangers,3au51z,Sharkbait41,10,Tue Jun 23 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"Haha, I wonder if Sather is trying for one EDM's big three, although I heard Yakupov was discussed too."
rangers,3au51z,bonesingyre,10,Tue Jun 23 15:39:53 2015 UTC,Give me Yakupov and Edm's 33rd for Talbot and Klein!
rangers,3au51z,berdman11,7,Tue Jun 23 15:47:43 2015 UTC,We'd have to give up more than just those two.
rangers,3au51z,RhynoSorceress,6,Tue Jun 23 16:20:09 2015 UTC,We'll throw in Glass lol. What about Yak and EDM's 56th pick?
rangers,3au51z,berdman11,3,Tue Jun 23 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly Talbot+Klein for Yak straight up probably wouldn't cut it. The kid is a former #1 overall pick and still has heaps of potential. We'd probably have to also include a pick or maybe Hagelin's rights. I don't want to shell out what we'd need to for Yak. If we can get the #16 or #21 (Buffalo) then I'd be very happy. We may end up having to accept an offer like 2 2nd rounders for Talbot, which would not be a bad deal at all."
rangers,3au51z,PattyMcShady,-4,Tue Jun 23 17:12:16 2015 UTC,probably Talbot+Klein+Stepan/Brassard for Yak+56th
rangers,3au51z,BELEAFFF,10,Tue Jun 23 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"That's an overpayment from the Ranger's side. Yak is good but he isn't even close to as proven as Step or Brass. He's never had more than 40 points and he was -30 +/- the last two years. He's a RW and both those guys are Centers. They are both our top centers. The only advantage I see is that he's 21 and cheaper.   Include a solid winger instead of either of those Cs and it's closer to an even deal. I think Talbot has more value than people are realizing. Sather doesn't have to trade him, so he will only take a sweet deal.    Maybe that deal works for Eberle+56th, but he's a RW too.   I think Talbot for a pick is the way to go. Talbot+3rd for #56 and a 5th round or something.   EDIT: Talbot can also be a deadline deal as a ""rent and sign"". Less value that way, but NYR would keep a top backup for the majority of the season."
rangers,3au51z,brian2686,3,Tue Jun 23 18:45:44 2015 UTC,No.

rangers,3au51z,SeeDeez,-4,Tue Jun 23 16:45:47 2015 UTC,We're not getting McDavid without giving them Hank. I don't even think Nash would be enough to secure that pick.
rangers,3au51z,ANGR1ST,7,Tue Jun 23 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"Hank wouldn't get us that pick from Edmn. Doesn't really make any sense for them to trade it at this point and certainly not for a 33yr old goalie or a 31yr old winger, both who have very high cap hits"
rangers,3au51z,PeteSamp27,3,Tue Jun 23 17:01:41 2015 UTC,literally nothing we could offer would get Edmonton to give us that pick.
rangers,3au51z,Screwbit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"? Hank+Mcdonagh+Kreider+Hayes+Nash?   Nothing sane, but at some point McDavid is one dude."

rangers,3au51z,McDuderer,13,Tue Jun 23 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all surprised. I've been saying since the beginning there's a huge difference between what's fair value and what's market value. Teams seem to think he's a legitimate starter, and the demand for his services is driving the price up...some team will get desperate as the draft gets closer."
rangers,3au51z,booshyschmoozy,19,Tue Jun 23 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"He's a goaltender that can be used as a starter at $1.45 million for next season. If he doesn't pan out for the team that used him then he can be traded or go to UFA, if he works out they can come to a new agreement on a contract. I just hope Talbot has a great career wherever he ends up."
rangers,3au51z,SteamHole,13,Tue Jun 23 16:13:12 2015 UTC,I just hope Sather actually trades him soon enough and doesn't hold him hostage to the point where we get just one late second rounder.
rangers,3au51z,imnotthesmartestman,8,Tue Jun 23 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, Talbot for McDavid, that's a fresh original joke right?"
rangers,3au51z,DeanYoungblood10,13,Tue Jun 23 17:31:24 2015 UTC,Talbot for McJesus confirmed
rangers,3au51z,blinkme123,6,Tue Jun 23 15:22:57 2015 UTC,Talbot for McDavid. Yeah I can see EDM doing that.
rangers,3au51z,OMGiTzViN,5,Tue Jun 23 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we still need a backup. If no one offers us what we need then I say hold onto him. We have a capable backup that can win 15 games for us. I know we're in win now mode but no need to throw this season away."
rangers,3au51z,arunnair87,19,Tue Jun 23 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"Can get a cheaper FA backup to play those 15 games. Talbot's stock is the highest it ever will get, time to sell high."
rangers,3au51z,RhynoSorceress,2,Tue Jun 23 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. But what if the highest offer is 2, 2nd round picks. Would you keep talbot or trade him at that point?"
rangers,3au51z,arunnair87,4,Tue Jun 23 16:46:59 2015 UTC,Probably - can then flip those 2 and our own second for a first rounder in a very deep draft.
rangers,3au51z,PaulSach,5,Tue Jun 23 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"or just pick three people in the 2nd round, which could be just as good as picking one guy in the bottom half of the first round (assuming we aren't getting in the top 10 and maybe not even the top 15)"
rangers,3au51z,PeteSamp27,2,Tue Jun 23 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"We're not going to get into the top 15. If anything, We'll get a late first. I was honestly surprised to see we didn't accept 2 second rounders."
rangers,3au51z,PaulSach,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:18:43 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we want a guy that can contribute now.
rangers,3au51z,arunnair87,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"But at what cost? Moving talbot only get us up to around 13 mil in cap space, and we'll still have to re-sign Fast, Hags, JT, and Stepan, plus the guys we want to keep in Hartford. Factor in a move for a back up goalie, because even though we all love him, Skapski probably isn't ready to be the full time back up, we're still strapped for space with not a lot of room for a guy who can contribute now."
rangers,3au51z,PaulSach,2,Tue Jun 23 19:04:19 2015 UTC,if both picks are in this year's draft and one is at the top end of the 2nd round I would do that trade if that's the best offer at the end of the day. That would be a good return for him and probably better than taking a high 2nd rounder and a fringe prospect (like that Edmn defenseman that has been rumored)
rangers,3au51z,PeteSamp27,3,Tue Jun 23 17:03:34 2015 UTC,Anybody here the guy suggesting to get rid of Hank and calling last season a fail season? Seriously that comment pissed me off.  Anyway Talbot for McJesus....wooo wooo
rangers,3au51z,UndoneSic,3,Tue Jun 23 16:36:12 2015 UTC,"Well sure, that kind of crap is ridiculous but let's not go pretending it was a success in any sense of the word."
rangers,3au51z,notromanbellic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:02:59 2015 UTC,"I really would like to know what team made that offer and where the numbers were in the second. If they were lower than the first twenty, than fuck that.

rangers,3aucmo,bonesingyre,11,Tue Jun 23 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"Well that was good for numbers, but moving Girardi is impossible because of his no trade clause, and also probably not good because we're in win-now mode."
rangers,3aucmo,ncolaros,7,Tue Jun 23 16:24:28 2015 UTC,"Right now we have 12 million for Stepan, Hags, Miller and Fast. Those 4 are projected to sign for about 12 million - it's going to be very tight. We can gain some more room by trading Talbot, Klein and Glass."
rangers,3aucmo,berdman11,4,Tue Jun 23 17:00:59 2015 UTC,If we trade 3 of those guys that would give us about $5 million. That's huge but I doubt we're going to be able to trade away Glass.
rangers,3aucmo,plastictf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:12:00 2015 UTC,Do you honestly think we could offload Glass? I would hate to see Klein go while retaining Boyle but if it needs to happen to retain the more important pieces so be it.

rangers,3avjuj,TheSensation19,6,Tue Jun 23 21:09:02 2015 UTC,I like him at around the 3 million mark. Anything above 3.5 I think would be too much.
rangers,3avjuj,plastictf,7,Tue Jun 23 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel hagelin is an essential player on the team and we need to sign him. He has the highest recorded top speed of any player in the NHL, he's a beast on the PK (honestly if consider his forward pairing with Dom Moore on the PK as one of the most effective in the league), and once in a while he'll bury a nice goal. Many linemates have cited his speed as a great way of creating chances and openings for them.  I agree that to a certain extent, Fast brings a comparable skill set but he's no Hagelin, at least not yet. I'd be pretty sad if he wasnt re-signed."
rangers,3avjuj,universalremonster--,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"Hagelin and Kreider say they are pretty comparable in speed. Hagelin may win without the puck, but Hags speed slows down with it.  Where did you get the highest recorded top speed from? ASG? Because every year they mix up the track route so its unfair to judge"
rangers,3avjuj,universalremonster--,2,Tue Jun 23 21:53:24 2015 UTC,There was a post on r/hockey about 6 months ago maybe that had data recording certain players speed over the course of something like 50 games. Hagelin got highest top speed while ovechkin had the most powerful acceleration. Kreider wasn't in the sample of players but I'd definitely agree he is as fast and there's no doubt he has more power and better puck control
rangers,3avjuj,mexicaaaan,0,Tue Jun 23 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I always felt Hags was the fastest in the league.   Anyway,  speed does kill. But:  1) I think AV does not use him correctly 2) Fast can play like him. Slower... but quick. And better finisher. Can also play PK and even shown some skill on PP.   3) I hear Bourque is extremely quick as well. Kreider is only getting faster. Our whole team is built on speed. If Hagelin wants more than 3 million, I will seriously reconsider. That is all I am saying. I would also try to have most of his contract on the back-end."
rangers,3avjuj,mexicaaaan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:54:10 2015 UTC,If you are playing slower than hagelin... you aren't playing like hagelin
rangers,3avjuj,mexicaaaan,0,Wed Jun 24 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"I do not NEED hagelin's speed. In fact when you look at actual Stanley Cup winners, no one has a guy of that speed.   The truth is that Hagelin was a 3rd line guy. He got 5 points. A few rushing chances, most of which I remember being shut down by the goalie. We all know he cant finish well.   Fast had 6 points. He was a 4th line guy who only in the last 7 or 8 games got a bit more time on the 2nd line. Funny how Hagelin did not get that chance.   I remember Fast scoring a Hagelin-like goal too. Except he only needed 1 chance to do it.   The truth is, Hagelin is expandable. I dont need that speed when he still only puts up 30-40 points."
rangers,3avjuj,isthatyoujohnwayne_,3,Thu Jun 25 12:37:46 2015 UTC,Ok? Doesn't change my point
rangers,3avjuj,isthatyoujohnwayne_,-1,Thu Jun 25 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"No I dont expect to change your point. But your not going to change mine. The dude should be paid 3 million. Simple as that. Even that is a lot for a 3rd line winger who has never scored more than 38 points, and last few years have declined."
rangers,3avjuj,powwow42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"I wasn't changing your point. However, it's true that if you aren't skating as fast as Hagelin, then you aren't playing like Hagelin. There are plenty of other players to play like in the NHL.   Maybe you aren't too bright, but I never even contested his pay or anything like that with you so... go figure"
rangers,3avjuj,mexicaaaan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"His salary is exactly what this is about. Of course I want Hagelin back, but this is a game with cap space and the only thing I have been referencing is that if he wants more than 3 million then we should reconsider. Thats it. Thats this entire post.   And I have some guys who are careless of this and just saying the Rangers need him back.  I am telling you this now. We do not NEED him at anything more than 3 million. 3.15 THE MAX."
rangers,3avjuj,bkay28,4,Thu Jun 25 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else is saying, around the 3 mil mark. Hes one of our best penalty killers and we can't afford to loose another great PK'r and grinder after losing Brian Boyle. Hags always steps it up in the playoffs too."

rangers,3avjuj,mexicaaaan,3,Wed Jun 24 22:18:59 2015 UTC,You are under stating hags skills by saying fast can replace him and the same goes for fast saying Lindberg or borque could replace him. Hags does a ton of things that don't show up on the box score. I'm sure there is an icings negated stat out there somewhere and id bet hags would be near the top 3-5 and that's only one thing he does
rangers,3avjuj,blueshirtdave,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:47:53 2015 UTC,"No I am not.  First, I have no idea if that is even a statistic of value. Negating icings? I can not say that I see that as often as I should to make it significant. Let alone see Hagelin being among the elite in that. In today's hybrid icing rules, I rarely see this."

rangers,3avjuj,ANGR1ST,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:18:49 2015 UTC,I see it pretty often with him and it is a big deal to be able to change your men when you're in a position where you needed to ice the puck or on the pk where you ice it but hags gets to it first and that's only one element of his game. I didn't say hags was ELITE but he is a damn important part of this team especially with the short shift system we run.
rangers,3avjuj,DicNavis,2,Thu Jun 25 15:28:20 2015 UTC,I'd say re-sign him at 3-4 years at about 3mil.  He absolutely needs to be re-signed though.
rangers,3avjuj,ANGR1ST,2,Tue Jun 23 22:30:46 2015 UTC,For everyone in favor of letting him walk... WHO WILL SCORE OUR EMPTY NET GOALS IF HE'S NOT HERE?
rangers,3avjuj,Ben_Ulrand,2,Wed Jun 24 14:57:31 2015 UTC,Hags can definitely play on the 2nd line.   Unfortunately when he is paired up with players like MSL and good ol' Brad Richards - his production somehow drops
rangers,3avsgf,jm7393,6,Tue Jun 23 22:12:52 2015 UTC,I don't think he likes it in Edmonton. I think a change of scenery would benefit him greatly. I can see him playing for us but I know EDM would want something big for him and honestly I'd rather have a first round pick if we were to make a trade with the Oilers.
rangers,3avsgf,judge_death1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:38:16 2015 UTC,If he didn't like why would he resign recently? Also I don't think Oilers are ready to part with a number one overall prospect from two years ago with a goalie who has played only two years in the league and hasn't played more than 36 game in a season. Don't get me wrong Talbot can fetch a good return but I think Yakupov is a bit too much to ask for him.
rangers,3avsgf,NYDevilsFan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:38:18 2015 UTC,He re-signed because he was an RFA and the team has a lot of leverage when dealing with RFAs

Maybe it'll take some pressure off Nash? I dunno.   I understand Cam must go and everyone throwing in Glass cause we hate him, we love him, we trade him. I'm still reeling from the loss I guess and I can't imagine losing Klein or Hags during these trade talks."
rangers,3avsgf,ATinyBoatInMyTeacup,2,Tue Jun 23 23:00:52 2015 UTC,Not a chance in hell... The Oilers wouldn't give up Yak without first seeing how he does with McDavid. Can you imagine McD's speed with a quick snap pass for the 1-timer to #10? Jesus...   It'd take someone like Staal to get the Oilers to give up on Yakupov.
rangers,3avsgf,onebandonesound,3,Wed Jun 24 10:43:55 2015 UTC,I would do talbot+Klein for yakupov in a heartbeat. I'd probably even do talbot+Klein+mcilrath if it got yak on the Rangers
rangers,3avsgf,smitty046,15,Tue Jun 23 22:54:02 2015 UTC,"Mcilrath is a bust people. I'm so god damn tired of people talking about him.

It really gets on my nerves that they keep getting these 1st overall picks and they still suck, but it's Edmonton so of course they'll get McDavid, the powers that be weren't gonna let him go to Buffalo. I think Yakupov is a gamble, but then again any trade you make will be a gamble - especially acquiring a first round draft pick... Maybe Yak would have some massive seasons with us though."

rangers,3apopv,BrosBeforeHossa,5,Mon Jun 22 14:34:02 2015 UTC,Both of EDM's first round picks for Talbot confirmed
rangers,3apopv,booshyschmoozy,10,Mon Jun 22 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"I think, as has been discussed, ""fair value"" is probably 33rd + a prospect (Marincin has been a popular choice) - assuming it's Edmonton. But with so many teams involved I really will not be surprised if Sather finds a way to get a 1st round pick. Either way, we're going to be getting great value for an un-drafted back up goalie. And Cam will be getting a greatly deserved opportunity."
rangers,3apopv,brian2686,9,Mon Jun 22 15:03:30 2015 UTC,"That's the key here. Cam wants and deserves a starting role. I'm sure he would prefer another year in New York though. Best team in the league as far as player treatment goes. Benoit Allaire. Lundqvist.  This is a rare Win-Win for the Rangers. Even though I would prefer to keep Talbot for next year's run to help keep Hank fresh, we can find someone serviceable that will shine in front of a Top-5 D core. If Talbot stays, NYR have arguably the best goalie tandem in the league. If Talbot goes, we recoup a much needed 1st round pick. If we can somehow package another roster player with Talbot and find some Cap relief, that's even better.  Don't fuck up this 1st round pick now Gordie. He's been incredible with mid-to-late round value picks, but his track record with 1st rounders has been pedestrian. Unless Dylan McIlrath rises from the dead like the undertaker, then Gordie looks even better.  When does the season start again?"
rangers,3apopv,booshyschmoozy,5,Mon Jun 22 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like Cam a lot, but this is a win-win for both the organization and him. I'm sure he'd prefer to stay, but he'd never turn down an opportunity to start somewhere else. And if we can turn whatever draft pick we get into a legitimate top-line player then that would be even more amazing."
rangers,3apopv,brian2686,3,Mon Jun 22 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"If we're just getting picks, Buffalo seems the way to go. The 16th pick would be pretty sweet for Cam. Maybe even swap some mid rounders too, like we get a 5th and they get a 3rd (have no idea what picks NYR have this year. I know there's no 1st rounder and probably no 2nd). Gordie has been a wizard with those value picks.  If they can make some kind of move involving Cam + Roster player for a solid pick and a returning Roster player, I'd prefer that.  The NYR have a huge advantage over most the teams in the league: They attract formerly drafted but unsigned FAs. Gilroy, Hayes, Bodie (was he undrafted?) and a couple other players they didn't get but were in the running for. There is another player this year they might grab too, forget his name.  This means NYR doesn't have to be incredible drafting prospects. They can be mediocre and augment their roster with unsigned draft picks. My point is that draft picks have a slightly lower value for NYR compared to the majority of the league. Hopefully Sather uses this to make some roster moves.  I'm excited for this year, again."
rangers,3apopv,dammitOtto,3,Mon Jun 22 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"We have #2 and #21 in the first and #2 (31) in the second.  At /r/sabres we are thinking that Murray won't give up 21 for a goalie without a long term deal, but maybe the second round pick.  But if he thinks it's critical, he might sweeten the deal."
rangers,3apopv,brian2686,3,Mon Jun 22 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm all fucked up. So, it's EDM has #1, #16 and #33 and then Buff has #2 and #21? That makes a little more sense then. EDM would value their 16 a little less since they get McDavid.  Eichel is the bomb, but Buff is still rebuilding (at the end of it, but still technically in building mode, right?). You guys got Evander Kane too. Add a good, young goalie and things are looking sunny in frigid ass buffalo. The 1 year deal is an obstacle though.  A #21 with mid-round swap seems pretty cool to me. But Talbot for #31 straight up seems more reasonable. Maybe throw in a 6th or 7th rounder.   I think I need to do some research though..."
rangers,3apopv,booshyschmoozy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"I think the whole UFA thing is getting blown out of proportion. There's only 30 starting jobs in the entire league...why would Cam play a whole year with a team trying to earn one, only to leave at the end of the year to do it all over again? I'm not saying it wouldn't happen, it's just far more unlikely than if he was a F/D..."
rangers,3apopv,PaulSach,5,Tue Jun 23 13:58:18 2015 UTC,"I see no reason why Talbot wouldn't be worth Buffalo's 21st ovr. Edmonton's 16th is a little high, but I think Talbot could score a late first rounder. If Schneider can nab a top 10 pick, then cam should be able to be had for a late 1st."

rangers,3apopv,DeanYoungblood10,2,Mon Jun 22 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"Fuck picks. Even 16. When will that player be a legitimate contributor to this team?  During this window?  Likely not. Likely drops even further for 33.  Get a player for now. Not Marincin, who the Rangers don't have any use for at present.  Make it a package, not suggesting straight up. Get something that is going to help this team be successful in the now and near future.  If not, keep Talbot. Trading him creates a hole that needs plugging. If we are going to create a hole in our present team then we need to receive something that helps us now."
rangers,3apopv,PhilipK_Dick,8,Mon Jun 22 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"But then you look at how the Blackhawks do business and realize that if you make smart trades for picks, the window never closes.  Take a look at Brandon Halverson and Igor Shesterkin.  Either one could be a very good NHL goalie in 2 or 3 years...  That's the same time #16 could be the top line forward we draft."
rangers,3apopv,DeanYoungblood10,3,Mon Jun 22 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"Which traded for draft picks by the Blackhawks developed in significant contributors in their runs?  Teravainen was 3 years removed from his draft by the time he was ready to contribute, but this pick was theirs to start with.  Saad was picked with a pick that was acquired in 2009, 4 years before he contributed.  Shaw was also drafted in 2011, also with the Blackhawk's own pick.  The reason the Blackhawks win is because they have 3 of the top 10 players in the league playing for them in their primes.  That and good drafting while they were bad.  They also trade picks for players.  Vermette, Timmonen.    Relying on either one of those goalies to come and be full time NHL starters is a real bad idea.  The likelihood is never very high.  Again, when is the #16 going to contribute?  Very likely it would be years.  Never is also a legitimate option.  Draft picks are essentially lottery tickets.  The Rangers don't need lottery tickets, they need young cost controlled players that are already established to some degree."
rangers,3apopv,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'm commenting on the way teams set up for the long haul.  I don't think we have to say that our ""window"" will only be open for another year or two.  By the time Hank is on the downturn, we have 2 excellent Goaltender prospects who should be ready.  When Nash is on the decline - we will need whoever we draft in this one to step up.  #16 in this deep draft could very well yeild a 30 goal scorer in 2 or 3 years - when we will need one.  EDIT:  To add on, I think this team as currently constructed could have won the cup with a little injury luck (not just Zucc but the guys who were playing injured).  I don't think there is any one player who would make a huge difference and with MSL leaving, there will be some addition by subtraction - with a youngster getting more top 6 and PP minutes (Hello JT Miller).  Also, Buchnevich..."
rangers,3apopv,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:53:46 2015 UTC,"Again, you're relying on best case scenarios for everything which is never the case.  The #16 pick is going to be a 30 goal scorer?  How often does that happen?  You expect both Halverson and Shestyerkin to bloom into NHL starters?  That's a rarity.  It's just as likely that the complete opposite happens, or even a freak accident like Cherapanov (RIP).  You're point about the Blackhawks was very wrong.  They've made no ""long haul"" acquisitions during this run, although they are about to now, because the cap is forcing them.  The time to compete is now.  Injuries killed us, won't argue with that at all.  But getting futures instead of present help isn't going to get us any closer in the next few years."
rangers,3apopv,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"The Hawks are extremely deep.  That is why they will continue to be a top team for years to come.  Yes, #16 in a draft this deep is going to be a very good prospect.  Experts are comparing this draft to 2003.  Teams need an influx of cheap young players otherwise they have to blow the team up once players need contracts.  First rounders are not a luxury - they are the only way a team can stay competitive long term.  Getting a guy who will help us in 2 or 3 years is going to be huge as we will be paying Brass, Step, Kreids, Zucc, Miller, Hayes, and others on real contracts...  Yes, I am expecting Halverson or Shestyerkin (or Skapski) to evolve into an NHL goalie.  That is why you don't draft only one goalie prospect.  I am relying on this draft to be as full of studs as experts are saying.  I am not an expert but if you look at 2003, there were about 20 top NHL players that came out of it.  As long as we don't pull another Jessiman....  But, our drafting has been much better in recent years so I have faith."
rangers,3apopv,DeanYoungblood10,2,Mon Jun 22 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"The Blackhawk's depth is a product of many bad years, some good free agent signings and trades.  At no point during there run of success did they do what you are suggesting the Rangers do.  Just because experts say this is a good draft (and really most are actually saying that after 10 it drops a lot), doesn't mean you're gonna get a stud, or even a someone who will contribute in the near future - the fact of the matter is that whoever is drafted at 16 is more than likely 3 years down the road from competing for a spot.  Even with better drafting it's no guarantee.  Look at some of our own recent picks.  McIlrath was drafted in 2010 and still not on the team.  Brady Skjei just turned pro, and needs time in the minors.  It's more likely that after this player drafted at #16 signs a pro contract that he'll need to spend time in the minors to adjust to a pro game.  ""Experts"" shit all over the 2011 draft and it turned out to be a good one so far.  You can bet your ass the Rangers aren't relying on these experts.  You say the team needs an influx of cheap young players - I agree.  But when is #16 playing on this team?  The influx you're speaking of isn't happening with anyone picked in this draft.  The influx needs to be now.  If you're trading away a roster player you have to get another player back who is ready to play now.  Trading away two players for a kid who MIGHT be playing on this team in 3 years is not going to help us in the near future, which is when help is needed.  3 years from now this team could look VERY different.  Just as its as different as it was 3 years ago right now."
rangers,3apopv,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, agree to disagree...  I think after all of the picks we gave up in trades recently it is a good time to recoup a high pick."
rangers,3apopv,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:52:34 2015 UTC,"Listen, I'm not gonna say recouping picks is bad.  It isn't.  And you're right, we have given up a lot recently.  My feeling is that if you are gonna create a hole on a team, get something that is either going to replace that hole or something that fills another need immediately.  We'll see what they end up doing.  If they do get #16, or #33 or whatever, I hope they draft a gem."
rangers,3apopv,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:00:27 2015 UTC,There is no way we keep Talbot/prevent him from being a #1 somewhere.  The choice is what we take for him.  I think we are going to feel the picks we have traded in the last few years sooner than later.  Picking up a first to go with our 2 seconds in this draft will lessen that blow tremendously....

Do not blame him at all for this year. He improved.   However I think Klein can take on his role of being a shut down defender. A player who has shown he can, and makes 2.9 million  7 million... We can then look to go get a Erhoff for 5 million. A rental player at best.   And use 2 million to assure signings."
rangers,3av7ft,kalegg,7,Tue Jun 23 21:20:39 2015 UTC,We literally have everyone's cap on the sidebar. It would've taken you two seconds to check and see Girardi's cap hit at 5.5 mil.
rangers,3av7ft,jedimasterchief,-7,Tue Jun 23 21:35:07 2015 UTC,"I am well aware of his average cap hit. However I believe, according to one site I was using, that next years cap hit is 7 million. The year following is 6. The year after that is 5.5. yada yada yada.... I may be wrong.  Either way, forget the specifics.  He is overpaid IMO.   He may be a top pairing D. But so was Coburn for Tampa Bay alongside Hedman and I wouldnt give Coburn 5.5.   All I am saying is Klein can fit his role.  And hes 2.9.   That extra 2 million is really needed now."
rangers,3av7ft,amHOCKEY,5,Tue Jun 23 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"He might be getting paid $7m but his cap hit is different than what he gets paid.   Example: $5 over 2 years could be 4million in year 1, and 1m year 2. Cap hit is still $2.5"
rangers,3av7ft,redpotatochip6,0,Tue Jun 23 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"Right. Okay. 5.5   Eitherway, is that really fair? Anyway that NTC is tough. You do not want to try and trade him and find out he gets pissed either."

rangers,3av7ft,SamRosenSexyTalk,-8,Tue Jun 23 19:42:57 2015 UTC,NTC? Sooo a player has never been moved because of that?  Cant believe giving Callahan a NTC was no hard for the team but Girardi made sense.
rangers,3av7ft,TBlueshirtsV22,5,Tue Jun 23 19:45:03 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he has an NTC
rangers,3av7ft,MikeyRage,3,Tue Jun 23 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"Only if the return is good. I don't want to get rid of Klein. He's very good for his salary and now people want him gone because he didn't do well after an injury. I get it was during the playoffs, but he seems like a scapegoat and I don't want a good player gone because of recent actions"
rangers,3av7ft,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Tue Jun 23 20:00:18 2015 UTC,Someone recently stated that Hunwick was better than Klein.  -___________-
rangers,3av7ft,keetner,3,Tue Jun 23 20:21:49 2015 UTC,Hunwick is better than Klein. Again people only remember Klein's first 2 months this year and that we got him for del Zotto. A lot of people say Hunwick is better than Klein because there is truth to it. And if he's not better they're probably even with Hunwick getting paid a fraction as much.
rangers,3av7ft,The_Other_Manning,3,Wed Jun 24 15:36:21 2015 UTC,He is.  The only think Klein can do is block shots. People remember when Klein was shooting 35% but not when he had about 4 points the last 4 months of the season.
rangers,3av7ft,keetner,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:32:47 2015 UTC,He is.     Klein is pretty poor at both shot suppression and shot generation.    Hunwick is actually pretty solid at both
rangers,3av7ft,The_Other_Manning,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I'm not really sure why people have jumped on having Klein traded so quickly. Though I get the feeling it's because Hunwick filled in pretty well for him, is a lot more cap friendly, and if I'm not mistaken, Klein will be a UFA next summer. But still, he had a pretty stellar season with us. When I look back at all his goals, I can't help but grin like an idiot (eg. OT GWG against the Pens after losing a chunk of his ear, another GWG in that crazy game against the Isles...). Not to mention, while he isn't the best skater, I feel like he has potential to be a pretty solid two-way D for our bottom pairings, and without him, we might be losing a bit of depth there (maybe like the D. Moore of defensemen?)  Sure, he wasn't great in the Playoffs. But like you mentioned, I'm not really sure what you could expect since he sat out for about two months with a broken arm, only to be thrusted back into the second round of the Playoffs.   Not to rip on Boyle or anything, but if it weren't for his NTC, I'd rather see him go. I dunno...honestly, his situation has been a little weird. I don't know if we brought in Yandle to have another offensive-kind of D, but it really seems like he's taken over the role Boyle was meant for. I also get that having different types of D is more advantageous...but...ergh. I just wish he was more consistent + not always bobbling the puck at the blue line. I dunno. Granted, he did play pretty well in the Playoffs...so I guess depending on how one weighs regular vs. post-season play, you might not have any issues with him."

""lawl""...I didn't know Eberle is a top 20 player in the nhl now because a 1st, Talbot on a wicked good deal, a speedy twoway winger, a depth (albeit useless) player, a 2nd round pick AND a top rated prospect goalie for Eberle and nothing else?

I'd prefer to keep the main core of players for the next few years; especially the trading of Stepan.  While the Oshie on the Rangers would make me happy (I like him) but not at the expense of Nash (even though the goals shrink up like a shrinky dink in playoffs). I'd rather look at some young players coming up to UFA status and trade Talbot plus another piece for that Oilers Pick.

You don't trade the third highest scoring in the league for a fucking penalty shootout specialist like TJ Oshie and you don't trade a budding 24 year old two way center like Steps
rangers,3almaa,isthatyoujohnwayne_,2,Sun Jun 21 16:17:09 2015 UTC,D
rangers,3almaa,blueshirtdave,2,Sun Jun 21 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"None of those sound particularly appealing (which seems to be the consensus).  We don't need Brad ""waltz slowly down the ice"" Richards, and we don't need a loose canon like Carbomb (again).  Trading for either of those players regresses on the strides we've made to improve in those areas.  I'm also not in favor of any trade of Step.  He MUST improve on faceoffs but that's it.  He's a major cog in our framework and trading him would be silly.  I have every confidence that we can meet on a amicable contract for him.  TJ Oshie doesn't interest me at all.  He's a great 1v1 player, and that's about it.    Only other comments are ones I've been saying ever since the season ended... First, we should not trade Klein at all.  He's extremely reliable defensively, is coming off a career offensive year, and we have him for 3 years at <$3 million a year.  That's a steal any way you shake it.  If we trade him we're right back where we were when we were tring to replace Del Zotto.  Regressing again.  Second, Hags is not worth north of $3million +.  He's making an adequate amount right now, and at most is worth $2.75 million in my opinion.  He fluffs breakaways and can't shoot with a high enough percentage to be more than a 15-17 goal/15-17 assist guy each year.  Not that those are terrible numbers, but they're fine if we're spending 2.5-2.75 million.  If we're paying him north of $3 million, then we're paying more for him than Klein, who scores almost as much and also plays defense.  Hags is wonderful on the PK, and his speed is feared.  But no one really believes he'll score on that breakaway, so it's only the thought of him they're afraid of.  I love the guy but if he doesn't sign at 2.75 million or less I'm totally fine packaging him with Talbot and a pick for someone solid."

We will have one of the fastest teams in the league I imagine, I say we develop a strategy based on our speed and, depending on whether or not it works, we can trade Cam for a player that will suit us best. I could be deranged, I don't know."
rangers,3almaa,blinkme123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"Cambot's value will be tanked by the deadline since he'll only be a rental for a few months (rather than the whole season) plus we can't count on him to necessarily be as good as he was this year, which would further deplete his value. Trading him now makes the most sense. If we could put a package together around him that nets us Edmonton's 16th overall in this draft, it could be huge. Even getting Edmonton's 2nd for him straight up would be very nice as well."

The Blues can't seem to sniff the 2nd round of the playoffs and I want nothing to do with Oshie because of that. It wouldn't be a huge upgrade to get Oshie.

Talbot is a perfect trading leverage now. And also we can't trade Klein as he is a great defensive player, it'll  probably be Boyle (even though I love the man). Though it's hard to say. He is older and we got Yandle and Sheppard did a good job too.  St. Louis will give us some option towards something hopefully."

rangers,3akd8b,Friscalating123,2,Tue Jun 23 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"If there is a chance, I would really like to keep him on the team. He did a good job and was noticeable in a good way on our fourth line.  I hope the front office can work something out."
rangers,3akd8b,AoifeCheeks,2,Sun Jun 21 15:25:24 2015 UTC,I really hope they can find a way to keep him. I don't think we've seen everything from him yet. I truly believe he could do well here if he played more. I was so upset he was scratched from Game 7.
rangers,3akd8b,James_is_my_sheppard,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to comment on Shep one way or the other, as I really need to re-watch some of his limited play to form a more solidified opinion, but I think it's comical how everyone rollercoasters on Glass.    He was blamed for everything early on, then from about late Feb - early March he stepped it up and became a solid player we needed.  Fans started liking him a good bit!  Then, in the playoffs, I without hesitation would say he was one of our most consistent performers.  The guy really stepped it up, and fans went crazy over him, and kept talking about how much he had changed and how well he was fitting into the mold of our team.    Now, it's back to ""fuck that guy, he doesn't do anything"".  I'm not trying to say I think he should stay, but I just think it's hilarious how short a fuse some fans have.  If we keep trading 4th liners for other 4th liners, we're not making much progress.  We need to stick with someone for a while and see how it goes.  I think Tanner is motivated to keep his level solid going into the new season, and perhaps we should recognize his improvement, and what he MAY bring to us next year.    Again though, I'm not necessarily on one side of this argument or the other, I just wanted to comment that a lot of folks are really quick to jump the boat.  I'm far more concerned that people think Hags is worth more $3.5 million."

He really played his ass of during the playoffss and I think some people are a little too quick to forget that, hence why my flair is still for him!"

rangers,3aikf9,ArsenalAM,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"KHL > AHL is very debatable. It's completely different hockey IMO. Bigger ice surface, less of the ""North American"" style hockey that he'll be playing here, and there's always the risk of him staying there. With that said, I'm ok with the decision. He seems to be developing nicely over there, and while I'd rather him come play in Hartford so the team can get him on a fast track to the NHL...I can't blame him for staying. Hopefully we see Pavel after next season."
rangers,3aikf9,booshyschmoozy,8,Mon Jun 22 13:53:19 2015 UTC,Makes sense. He won't crack the roster next year and he'll make more money in the KHL than Hartford. It'd be nice if he took the time to get acclimated to the North American game but can't say I wouldn't do the same in his shoes.
rangers,3aikf9,brother_of_menelaus,9,Sat Jun 20 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"He's gotta good head on his shoulders, he gets more development time and we get a better player"
rangers,3aikf9,AoifeCheeks,7,Sat Jun 20 15:40:31 2015 UTC,What type of game does he have? I know his name but I'm not sure I've seen much game footage.
rangers,3aikf9,g3ckoNJ,7,Sat Jun 20 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"very similar game to Duclair, which is why he was expandable. He's slightly taller at the same way, better hands, but maybe a slightly weaker shot..overall, has more upside. He was the main reason why the Rangers' brass felt that it could trade Duclair since we already had a similar player waiting in the wings."
rangers,3aikf9,truthlesshunter,3,Sat Jun 20 17:19:11 2015 UTC,And we're also pretty stacked at wing. Hayes is a future top line winger in my opinion.
rangers,3aikf9,BrutalJones,2,Sat Jun 20 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Zucc, Nash, and Kreider are etched into the top 6 wings for the next bunch of years, and we have Miller and Hayes already as ""centers"" that are really more comfortable on the wing. Add in Hags, who I hope we can re-sign to a reasonable deal, and you have your top 9 wings, the oldest of whom is Nash at 30. Having both Buch and Duke in the pipeline was nice, but it was going to be tough to find a spot for them for a while."
rangers,3aikf9,brother_of_menelaus,3,Sat Jun 20 21:47:30 2015 UTC,"Also way, way harder on the puck and more patient than Duke IMO. Duke is shoot first, Buch tends to hold on and make that insane pass if he can."
rangers,3aikf9,Friscalating123,2,Tue Jun 23 21:33:22 2015 UTC,Offensive playmaker from what I can tell. Needs work defensively. Doesn't just produce in the KHL. 6 points (5 assists) in 7 World Juniors games.

rangers,3aikf9,theguerrillafund,2,Sat Jun 20 17:36:02 2015 UTC,That comment makes it seem like he wants to come over and the quality of the competition is probably better in the K so I think we're good!
rangers,3ajwnz,mdoneil,3,Sat Jun 20 22:39:04 2015 UTC,We'd probably sign a backup goalie or consider purchasing the contract of whoever the vet goalie was for the Wolfpack last season.   Skapski will be the starter for the Wolfpack...he's still young and him sitting on the bench will do him no good.
rangers,3ajwnz,JKaye57,2,Sun Jun 21 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"I think bringing up Danis short term would be a good idea. He isn't a liability, and he definitely did a lot of great work in the WPs run this year, taking up the workload from Skapski while he was out.  Skapski needs at least another year in Hartford."
rangers,3ajwnz,irishguy42,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:06:08 2015 UTC,"Right, Danis.   Skapski definitely needs another year, plus with his recovery from hip surgery...making him the backup goalie next season just makes zero sense and I'm not sure why analysts and fans don't realize that."
rangers,3ajwnz,JKaye57,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd look at the goalie market.  And I am keeping an eye on what the Blackhawks will do.  With Crawford, Darling, and Raanta that bench is getting a bit crowded.  I wouldn't mind looking at Raanta."
rangers,3ajwnz,AoifeCheeks,3,Sun Jun 21 00:52:25 2015 UTC,Raanta would be an excellent fit.  His cap hit is low next year and we could probably just swap some spare parts for him.  My only concern is whether he is handsome enough to play goal for the Rangers.
rangers,3ajwnz,DicNavis,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:36:49 2015 UTC,He has the adorable factor which would fit well within the group. We're expanding our Scandinavian faction on the team too.  It is either him or Eddie Lack (Who has a huge mancrush on Lundqvist)
rangers,3ajwnz,AoifeCheeks,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"There are some options. Skapski is probably the #1 choice for the organization, but his injury will probably force them to sign someone. Greiss, Enroth, Budaj, Bachman, are just a few potential targets. I'd love to hold onto Cam, but the reality is he probably won't resign here to be a back-up again after next year...and any chance you can flip your back-up goalie for a 1st or 2nd/prospect you have to do it."
rangers,3ajwnz,booshyschmoozy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:00:19 2015 UTC,Skapski would have to take on a big role. As for that surgery he'll be fine by next season.

rangers,3alent,PattyMcShady,3,Wed Jun 24 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"On St. Louis, he would need to take a ridiculous paycut compared to what he will get on the open market. In order to resign Stepan, Hags, Fast, and Miller, we probably would need to sign him to a 1-1.5M deal, when he probably will get over 3M as a UFA.  For Talbot, it's a couple reasons. To begin, he's not that young, he's 27, so his prime will be over the next years when he would still be a backup. Also, this is his last year before becoming a UFA, so if we do not trade him in the offseason or before the deadline, we lose him at the end of the year in all likelihood since we wouldn't pay him what he will command just to backup Hank.  As to why trade him now? By all accounts this is the deepest draft since 2003, and getting a potential 1st rounder or high 2nd rounder could really help to strengthen a weak prospect pool. Also, his value will really never be higher than it is right now. He has played incredibly over the past two years, and looks like a starting caliber goalie. If he continues his level of play, his value should remain about the same since it will still be in a backup role and won't have many starts before the deadline. However, if he begins to regress this season leading up to the deadline, his value will go down. Talbot is a very hot commodity on the market right now and competing interest is only serving to drive his value up, so we should try and capitalize while we can."
rangers,3alent,Stevezie,3,Sun Jun 21 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all accounts here. You just cannot overstate the importance of having a higher end pick this year. If you can snag a prospect and either a first or second pick then you win the Talbot trade. Goalies never really have great trade value but Talbot is this rare opportunity thta needs to be cashed in. Bring in a Raanta, which someone mentioned in another post, to fill the void or bring up Desjardins from the minors to fill the role for a season.  As for MSL, I wouldn't bet against him being in a Blueshirt next season for 1-1.25m and some minor bonuses. I feel like he has a ton of pride and someone who wants to prove to not only himself, but Rangers fans, that he can get the job done still. Sure, he could go to the island or to the Rock and do the same but he wants to win and win now, the Rangers give the best opportunity for that. He isn't hurting for money by any sense so I see it happening. Not sure if that is a good thing though."
rangers,3alent,xxdarksyde73xx,2,Sun Jun 21 11:53:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this until you mention the ""weak prospect pool"" the wolfpack went to the Eastern Conference Finals, doesn't seem too weak to me. I see a few players with high potential."
rangers,3alent,PattyMcShady,3,Mon Jun 22 13:45:03 2015 UTC,"Hockey's future has our prospects ranked as 28th. A lot of our AHL success comes from guys who are very solid players who project to no more than a bottom 6 forwards (i.e Lindberg and Bourque) and career AHL players (i.e. Mueller). Realistically we have 1 projected top 6 player in Buchnevich and 1 top 4 defenseman in Skjei. While there certainly is talent that could pan out, each team has that in their pool. What we really lack are top end prospects, which is exactly what we could get from a Talbot trade before the draft."
rangers,3alent,JKaye57,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I completely forgot that he becomes a UFA next year, makes more sense now. Talbot won't be out goalie of the future, although it'll still be sad to see him go."
rangers,3alent,DrChopChop,3,Wed Jun 24 21:16:01 2015 UTC,"Why re-sign St. Louis? Yeah, Marty had a 52 point season which wasn't bad. But he just turned 40. We have a couple of young players who should be competing for his spot in the lineup. Plus, right now the bigger concern is making sure we have the cap space for Stepan, Miller, and Hagelin. I'm still in the camp that by the beginning of next season, Hagelin will be starting on another team. We already have enough money locked in on an old player (paging Dan Boyle), it just doesn't make sense to bring Marty back. If Marty is smart, he'll take a one year deal like Richie did and try to do something special with another team. I just don't think he has a future here.  As for Talbot, again, why not trade him? In goalie years, Talbot's pretty young as he hasn't played in the NHL much. But by the start of next season he's going to be 28 years old. He's not that young. He's not like he's a prospect anymore. He's basically entering the years where most players hit his prime and he only has, altogether, one full season of games under his belt. Talbot has shown that he can compete at a high level and take on being a #1. He will NEVER be the starter for the New York Rangers. If we don't trade Cam Talbot before the start of next season or at all, it would be the same mistake the Mets made in not trading Jose Reyes in his final season.   I love Talbot, the guy is calm, cool, and a competitor. But take a good look at the Rangers prospect pool with the Wolfpack. There are a couple of guys I'm excited about (Skjei, Lindberg), a few of guys that I hope pan out (Allen, Bodie, McIlrath, Haggerty), and then a lot of guys who are still with their junior teams or in Russia who may not have an impact for another few years down the ride. Talbot could net us a pick where we can get someone big and exciting in the draft. A Kreider type pick. Since aside from Buchnevich, there's really no forward that has me on the edge of my seat just waiting to show up. We traded that other guy away for Yandle.  So while it would suck to trade Talbot from a fan perspective...it's something we've gotta do. And re-signing Marty is something we just should not do at all."
rangers,3alent,defiantgrit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:42:49 2015 UTC,All good points.
rangers,3alent,blinkme123,2,Wed Jun 24 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"""7. As for Cam Talbot, the toughest thing preventing the Rangers from getting the best possible price for him is that he’s on a one-year contract with free agency beckoning. Under CBA rules, he cannot be extended until Jan. 1, 2016. If teams knew they could do it in July, you could get permission to talk to him and have an idea of what you’re looking at. That’s not possible. He’s still good value. But this gives the acquiring team less control.""  LINK"
rangers,3alent,DeanYoungblood10,2,Sun Jun 21 15:59:17 2015 UTC,That playoff performance by St. Louis was enough for the team to let him hit the skids. Giving up a shorty on a 5 on 3 in the series they eventually lost really hurts this team. His skill set has diminished. I know he had another 20 goal season but we can't have a guy who has a good offensive regular season look that bad in the playoffs and keep him.  Instead of shooting he was tossing drop passes to Tampa's D. And sometimes Tampa's best offensive players. I'd rather see Miller and Fast get Marty's minutes and develop then watch him drop a pass to Stamkos forgetting he plays for the Rangers now.
rangers,3alent,F_urOpinion,2,Sun Jun 21 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"Second of all, why trade Talbot? I get that he is great trade bait, he doesn't want (or deserve) to be a backup and it's not like Lundqvist is gonna leave, and we can trade him to get someone to improve our offense, but...I don't know, I just don't like it. He's too good. I'm not a fan of trading really good young players in sports (especially prospects, easy to say that I was not a fan of trading Anthony Duclair).       Talbot is not particularly young. He'll turn 28 shortly after the draft and, while goalies can play well into their late 30s, that gives Hank several strong years left and at that point Talbot will be approaching the age that Hank is now. He is not our goalie of the future, trade or no trade. That said, it makes the most sense to use him to pick up other assets that will be more valuable to us."

rangers,3affll,jedimasterchief,2,Sun Jun 21 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"Assuming no major injuries I think the metro top 3 will be: Rangers, Islanders and Blue Jackets. WC from the metro most likely the Caps."

He's terribly efficient in powerplays."""
rangers,3affll,ANGR1ST,-81,Fri Jun 19 18:23:07 2015 UTC,"I would rather give everything over the years I have left to win with the Rangers than trying to do it elsewhere.   How about some of that cap space? Think he'd give that? Nope.  Downvote me all you want, but that dirty Bostonian Brady gave up some of his pay to help re-sign all of his teammates. Look at our cap space this season and tell me we wouldn't be better off with Hank being paid less."
rangers,3affll,jedimasterchief,17,Fri Jun 19 19:13:38 2015 UTC,The NFL allows for players and teams to restructure their contacts. So Brady took away money currently and just delayed it. The NHL doesn't allow you to do that. Otherwise Hank would have restructured.
rangers,3affll,JKaye57,17,Fri Jun 19 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People think Brady is a saint for restructuring his deal -- the fact is he's still getting paid every goddamn penny, just at different times throughout his career. The NFL CBA allows for that to happen.  The hockey CBA? Nope."

Swedes are not even allowed to complain, because they are afraid to be called racists. They just sit, pay taxes and see their country, culture and ethnicity destroyed. lol  Feminists dont want equality, feminism destroys women and the family. You're just plain stupid.

rangers,3affll,Enzo95,-9,Fri Jun 19 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Too bad only 5 of these 14 points are goals. Also, Rick scored these 5 goals in 4 different games. Four games. A player his caliber (with his cap burden) contributing only 4 games out of 19 or at least 23 if we made the finals... not good man. Hank stood on his head, did his job, we cant blame him. As we always joke, he cant score from his crease.  Dont get me wrong, I like Rick, I'm just desperate to see this team winning. Last summer Rick lost some weight and changed his workout. It made wonders for him. Now I think he just needs to keep doing that and look for a sports psychologist (just like Kreids will). He has the talent, but after only 4 playoff games in 9 years and coming to a big, pressure market like NY... it is tough, he's under pressure. His lack of playoff scoring is probably mental in addition to a lack of a supporting cast. (Marty sucked, Hobbit got hurt, etc)  Oh well. Sather just need to make Chiarelli an offer he cant refuse. Get gangsta Slats."

rangers,3affll,ANGR1ST,-7,Fri Jun 19 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"Right, because you can't live comfortably indefinitely off a $20mil nest egg.  The same argument you're making about Nash not performing at crunch time can be applied to Hank. But no-one around here wants to hear that it's ever his fault that we lose a game.  He might be deserving of the money we're giving him. But sometimes if you want to win you need to make some sacrifices. Is it more important that he ""gets cash"" or that ""he wins a cup""? I know I'd rather see a win."
rangers,3affll,Enzo95,7,Fri Jun 19 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"Dont forget it's a business. Would u accept a paycut on your job, just to see the company you work for do well against it's rivals in the business? I know it's different, we cant compare a multimillionaire athlete to us, regular guys, but... go figure. If Brady wanted to lose money, it's his problem. Many guys said they loved playing for the Rangers, but when they were not able to get 250k more in their contract, they left.  Money talks."
rangers,3affll,ANGR1ST,-1,Fri Jun 19 20:28:29 2015 UTC,"I know it's a business. But these people are always talking about wanting to win, not wanting to get paid.  Many people take jobs that pay less than they might make elsewhere because they believe in the work a company does, or because of the other perks of working there, even if it's just that they get to live in a particular place. I make less money than I could because I enjoy where I currently work.  I just take issue with these people making these statements about ""doing anything to win"", but then not backing it up with their checkbooks. Just keep your mouth shut and play then."

With Stepan Hayes Brass Moore Lindberg I think Center is the last place the Rangers should be allocating money (with the exception of Stepan needing a new deal). The signing of Hayes and Lindberg's development solved our center issue from 2013-14 and early this season.  As far as $3.5mil goes I dont see how we sign him for that much and don't lose Hagelin.

rangers,3aefg3,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"Idk, I think we lose depth by resigning Sheppard and playing him. Besides he wouldn't get any powerplay time. Hayes probably will. Its a tough situation but if anyone has a chance of improving himself on faceoffs its Hayes who is still growing as a player. I agree, it sucked losing faceoffs for the powerplay but I don't know how I feel giving a roster spot to a guy just because he can win faceoffs. Just my opinion, I'd rather see it go to a skilled player who could put the puck in the net more often."
rangers,3aefg3,NYRule1994,3,Sat Jun 20 05:32:08 2015 UTC,frolik pls
rangers,3aefg3,NYRule1994,3,Fri Jun 19 14:02:30 2015 UTC,Can I ask why you want him? I've never been particularly attracted to the idea of him in a Blueshirt.
rangers,3aefg3,NYRule1994,3,Fri Jun 19 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"He had his best season last year, he's a very underrated guy, he makes a lot of right decisions and if we're losing Marty I think our best bet would be to sign someone experienced like him, someone who has won a Stanley Cup and knows what it's like to be there, rather then throwing Fast up there. Not that I don't love Fast, I honestly think he has the potential to be that 2nd-line winger but if we're still in win now mode then Frolik is our guy for that spot. We just need to get the cap space for him."
rangers,3aefg3,NYRule1994,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:19:06 2015 UTC,"I do like that he's still young, I'll agree with that at least.  What do you think his asking price is going to be?"
rangers,3aefg3,ncolaros,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:23:37 2015 UTC,Probably around 4.5-5M but it could end up being 5M+ if several teams are interested in him.
rangers,3aefg3,RedlineChaser,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"Oh dang, that's quite a lot"
rangers,3aefg3,RedlineChaser,2,Fri Jun 19 14:37:20 2015 UTC,That's exactly our problem.
rangers,3aefg3,PaulSach,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:44:03 2015 UTC,"I think he'll end up going for 4.5, to be honest with you. Probably till too expensive unfortunately."
rangers,3aefg3,PaulSach,2,Sat Jun 20 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see anyone on that list that would fit, IMHO.  We really don't need to spend the cash on anyone over 30, Defense(unless Klein goes w/ Talbot), or Centers.  If Klein goes...I'd like to see Yandle move up to 2nd line and us get a big bruiser to pair with Boyle."
rangers,3aefg3,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:17:02 2015 UTC,Why don't you like the idea of Soderberg in a blueshirt? Just curious
rangers,3aefg3,redpotatochip6,2,Fri Jun 19 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"I think it would be awesome to have him.  I think he's the best option on that list...just not on THIS team.  At this point, he's a 2nd line center.  On his end, I don't see him wanting to move to the 3rd line and he's looking to make 2nd line center money(as per the article you linked....so I don't know all of the details).  We're really not in the market for a center.  Stepan and Brassard are fan favorites and not going anywhere or getting bumped down the line.  Miller/Moore I like.  They could be bumped, but again, Soderberg won't want anything less than 2nd line IMHO.    If he wants to to play RW and we get rid of St. Louis then all bets are off and we should absolutely throw cash at him.  But that's not going to happen."
rangers,3aefg3,anonymous_reader,2,Fri Jun 19 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"Don't think we'll be chasing anyone without a surprise trade. AV has already stated they'll be looking to Hartford to plug some holes, mainly McIlrath, Lindberg, Borque, etc."
rangers,3aefg3,bu77munch,2,Fri Jun 19 15:30:54 2015 UTC,Really? Would you mind linking that to me? I'd love to read it
rangers,3aefg3,Jwpt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"Just from sny, but it wouldn't surprise me. If we manage to retain our RFAs, then the only real hole we'll have is an extra forward, extra defenseman, and a top 9 spot which 4 of our bottom 6 can step in to, and 3 of those 4 could fill a top 6 role. No reason to not give more young blood a chance to prove their worth at the top level."
rangers,3aefg3,dese44,2,Fri Jun 19 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"Looking through the list, Beleskey's asking price according to Friedman is shocking to me. This is a guy who scored more than 10 goals for just the second time in his career and I'm sure it had a lot to do with playing primarily with Kesler and the rest of the time with Perry/Getzlaf. Its not like he gets a load of assists either. I thought he might be a guy the Rangers could look at for the wing but if he wants $5mil after his first 30 point season...I mean Jesus Christ"
rangers,3aefg3,DicNavis,2,Fri Jun 19 17:28:04 2015 UTC,I would love to have Joel Ward
rangers,3aefg3,theguerrillafund,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Beauchamin (horrible spelling) would be great to replace a possibly dealt Klein.   I'd take two of ward, belesky, and soderberg"
rangers,3aefg3,lionson76,2,Fri Jun 19 16:36:14 2015 UTC,We'd have no cap left with any of those two out of three
rangers,3aefg3,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"He's aged quite a bit over the last 2 seasons, he hasn't looked so hot lately at all. Klein is the better option by far and McIlrath or Skeji would probably fill the hole just as well."
rangers,3aefg3,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"Isn't soderberg going to be due for a pretty hefty payday, which is the main reason Boston is letting him walk? Would love to have him, but since we're so up against the cap how exactly can we afford somone like that? How much do people think he's going to demand on the market?"
rangers,3aefg3,redline42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"He thinks he is, but his production doesn't seem to be worth the initial asking price for any team."
rangers,3aefg3,Muriden,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:38:18 2015 UTC,Petry is probably out of our price range but I'd love to replace Boyle with him.
rangers,3aefg3,Nezirsc,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"Up until yesterday, I would have said Soderberg as well. No doubt he's on several teams's wish lists - teams with more money to spend than us.  Based on how Hayes and Miller played at the pivot last year, I'm also leaning more toward a proven center to play on the 3rd line:    LW C RW    Nash Brass Zucc   Kreids Step Hayes/Miller   Hags  Hayes/Miller   Glass Moore Fast    However, because that position could be hard to fill, our best hope is to have Hayes or Miller there so we can more easily fill the 4th line RW role:    LW C RW    Nash Brass Zucc   Kreids Step Hayes/Miller   Hags Hayes/Miller Fast   Glass Moore     Finally, is there anyone from Hartford ready to make the jump? Could Lindberg fill the 3rd line center spot? Or Danny Kristo on the wing? I'm genuinely asking, because I don't know.  It also remains to be seen what we get for Cam.  Edit: I don't mean for those cells to be green. Looks like a wonky sub style."
rangers,3aefg3,ptvnsux94,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"The only thing he screams to me is ""Going to be overpaid"""
rangers,3aefg3,anonymous_reader,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:53:33 2015 UTC,I'd be kinda meh on Soderberg. He's good but I feel like he benefitted from playing on a line with Eriksson. If we can drop Klein and Skjei isn't looking NHL ready or if something doesn't work out with Hunwick I might be down to pick up Petry.
rangers,3aefg3,NDIrish27,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:49:27 2015 UTC,Ribeiro and Belesky.  They would be cheap high point guys that bring a lot to the table.  Soderburg is nice but I'm not sold yet
rangers,3aefg3,NDIrish27,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Belesky won't be cheap, Ribeiro is great but I think he is staying in Nashville."
rangers,3afe3h,rangers8905,3,Fri Jun 19 18:05:19 2015 UTC,Thought this was a good article that counters all of the talk of packaging Talbot and Klein to Edmonton for their first round pick (16th overall). Would sending a different defensmen make it more likely? If so who?
rangers,3afe3h,PattyMcShady,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of our other defense align right in value. If Staal or G go we would need another roster player or more picks beyond the 16th. If Klein isn't involved (which I still think he will be), it would likely be for the 33rd"
rangers,3afe3h,ncolaros,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:47:11 2015 UTC,My thought process on including Staal or Girardi is that dropping one of their contracts would free up more cap space for resigning and potentially picking up another forward. It seems like we're not going to sign St. Louis but he did end up 4th on the team in points and tied for 2nd in goals so we'll need to replace that.
rangers,3afe3h,averyrule,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"Girardi has a no trade clause, I believe."
rangers,3afe3h,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:17:21 2015 UTC,Ahhh true.
rangers,3afe3h,averyrule,3,Sat Jun 20 02:21:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the article. Those are some cherry-picked stats, though. Quality of Competition and Zone Starts are going to be relative to the team you're on, and where you are on their depth chart. Corsi relative on the Rangers is going to be different than Corsi rel on the Oilers.  Not to say I bothered to look up other stats (CF%, etc), but it's worth noting."
rangers,3afe3h,ncolaros,4,Fri Jun 19 19:08:20 2015 UTC,The problem is that Klein's corsi rel is still bad relative to the Rangers. Even if you account for blocked shots with Fenwick rel% it's still pretty bad.     His hextally chart isn't very great either
rangers,3afe3h,averyrule,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:54:47 2015 UTC,Fair points.
rangers,3afe3h,SteamHole,2,Sat Jun 20 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"The real question is do the Oilers care? There was a great article that showed how much the teams of the league looked at advanced stats. The Rangers were ""skeptics."""
rangers,3afe3h,ZachxNYR,2,Sat Jun 20 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"It's true. And a lot of them say they use ""other"" advanced stats. Rather than corsi/fenwick/etc, they have whatever internal things they measure that are hopefully more advanced than plus/minus."

rangers,3af1ow,spitfyer,8,Fri Jun 19 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"0% chance he makes the roster. His stats in junior last year look good because he was an overage playing against kids. He should've put up big stats and he did, so the best I think we can say is he met expectations. He's still young and lanky and will have to put on weight to compete against men, but he can probably earn a spot on Hartford. As far as the Rangers' roster goes, there are people ahead of him on the totem pole: Lindberg, Borque, possibly even Haggerty."
rangers,3af1ow,brother_of_menelaus,4,Fri Jun 19 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"More than likely will go to the wolf pack, potential injury call up... Unless he kills it at camp like Duclair did"
rangers,3af1ow,bjisba41,-1,Fri Jun 19 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"Then we can trade him, a first round pick, and klein for another defenseman to run our powerplay sort of."
rangers,3af1ow,ramblinrabble,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:57:35 2015 UTC,Give him another couple of seasons. I think Lindberg is our next call up.
rangers,3af1ow,bu77munch,0,Fri Jun 19 17:38:49 2015 UTC,Yup. Lindberg is the next one up.
rangers,3af1ow,high5sexwhoa,0,Fri Jun 19 19:30:47 2015 UTC,oh ya and the kid had a +- of 43...
rangers,3af1ow,PattyMcShady,0,Fri Jun 19 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt he's earned himself a legitimate shot in training camp. Depending on what contracts we give out/what happens with Talbot, we will probably have an internal competition for MSL's winger spot. Between Buchnevich, Tambellini, Lindberg (shift Hayes to wing and have Oscar center the 3rd), and others it's anyone's guess who comes out."
rangers,3af1ow,irishguy42,0,Fri Jun 19 16:54:32 2015 UTC,"Buchnevich won't be around for training camp this year or at all for the season.  However, depending on what happens for next year's camp..."
rangers,3af1ow,PattyMcShady,0,Fri Jun 19 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I missed that announcement this summer it looks like. In that case, I'd say Tambellini or Lindberg are the best bets. All in all I anticipate us moving Klein and signing a top 9 winger (Frolik?)"
rangers,3af1ow,RhynoSorceress,0,Fri Jun 19 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"I got to watch him a few times this season in the WHL (including two playoff games) and he's definitely got skill. Has a good shot, scored a few nice one-timer PP goals and could be a good addition to our non-existent powerplay. Can't really recall how he was defensively as most of his shifts were spent in the offensive zone. IIRC he seemed like a decent/good skater and has good puck skills. If I were to guess, he could probably use a year in the AHL to get adjusted to the pro game and get more minutes than with the Rangers."
rangers,3af1ow,Sockittoum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:03:09 2015 UTC,is the WHL really that much younger than the AHL?
rangers,3af1ow,RhynoSorceress,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:36:47 2015 UTC,In the WHL you'll usually see kids 16-18.
rangers,3af1ow,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:42:14 2015 UTC,He was playing against teenagers in the WHL. The AHL is anyone 20 years or older. Some guys can make the jump easier than others but I would bet he needs time in the AHL before being ready for the Rangers.
rangers,3adzkb,EarnSquirm,5,Fri Jun 19 10:07:39 2015 UTC,"All fair deals. Shit, I hate all of them. I want a 1st."
rangers,3adzkb,Enzo95,5,Fri Jun 19 13:50:24 2015 UTC,I feel like talbot is a somewhat proven nhl goaltender.  That has to be worth more than a second round pick.
rangers,3adzkb,pugwalker,2,Fri Jun 19 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"Not with only one year left on his contract. He'll be a UFA at the end of the season. While he is worth more than a second, they will be paying him more if they want to keep him. They even mentioned he's worth ""a late first round pick."" Problem is that the teams trading don't seem to have one of those."
rangers,3adzkb,bcgrm,0,Fri Jun 19 16:39:10 2015 UTC,Yeah let's get Eberle and RNH for Talbot and a 7th rounder. Maybe throw in Glass to sweeten the pot. /s

rangers,3adzkb,KingNickyThe1st,4,Fri Jun 19 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those are fair if they were the only team that wants Talbot. Also, this article does not take into account how much of a trade whisper Sather is. With a possible bidding war and Sather on our side if the Rangers don't get either a NHL ready player or a 1st round pick for Talbot, I don't think the trade is worth it. If we want to make another run to the cup we need a competent back up to give Hank rest and not be a liability in those games. Talbot is such a huge piece to part with for just a 2nd round pick."
rangers,3adzkb,ptvnsux94,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:10:22 2015 UTC,I agree.  Hank is amazing but having a good backup will really be helpful come playoff time.  I don't want to have a not so good backup so Henrik needs to play 70+ games in the regular season.  I don't think it is worth it to trade talbot for a 2nd rounder who may pan out in ~3 years when we can win the cup now.
rangers,3adzkb,NYRangers721,2,Sat Jun 20 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think those are all ""fair value"" deals. But IMO two things the author hasn't considered is a bidding war/other pieces being added to a deal. If we're talking Talbot straight up, then yes I think those are all pretty fair deals. But Slats is capable of driving the price up, especially with so many teams involved. I'd be happy with probably any one of those trades, but I also won't be surprised if Sather squeezes a 1st round pick out of someone."
rangers,3adzkb,booshyschmoozy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:31:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, say we get Edmonton to bite and trade us the 16OA for Talbot, I still think it would be smart to try to trade back a little bit later in the first round.  A good option would be to Buffalo for the 21st and 50th picks, while we can toss them a third.  I'd also be really happy with Talbot for the 33rd pick + Marincin"

rangers,3aar0u,PhilipK_Dick,2,Thu Jun 18 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"While I don't think Yak is off the table permanently, I think Chiarelli will recognize that the past few years Yak hasn't been playing too well(under Eakins) and will give him a year to prove himself before he is ever traded(so that he is traded at a much higher value)"

rangers,3aemfi,TheSensation19,11,Fri Jun 19 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"Nash is a much better player than anyone on the Blues minus Tarasenko. It would be foolish of us to trade with them. In that off-season move post on here, it said since 2007, Nash is 5th in scoring behind Ovie, Stamkos, Perry, Iginla. You don't just give that up."
rangers,3aemfi,bonesingyre,-9,Fri Jun 19 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"Looking at stats alone is foolish.  Nash is a very inconsistent player. 2 years ago he seemed to score 3 against Buffalo but then go scoreless in the next 3 games. Score 2 against Ottawa and then go scoreless for the next 3 games. Score 1 here and there. The intensity inst there. The leadership isnt there.   I love the player, but with the cap space included you have to look at options like Steen or Backes. Steen is a much cheaper, 30 goal scorer. Backes is a hard nosed, versatile player.   I am not sure AV will like either, but the cap space on both of these guys are reasonable.   Plus when you look at Nashs efforst in the playoffs (MOSTLY) I am ready to make moves. Its inconsistent."
rangers,3aemfi,jh1336,5,Fri Jun 19 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"Looking at stats alone is foolish.   This is exactly what you're doing with the guys you want to trade him for.    Nash is a very inconsistent player. 2 years ago he seemed to score 3 against Buffalo but then go scoreless in the next 3 games. Score 2 against Ottawa and then go scoreless for the next 3 games. Score 1 here and there. The intensity inst there.    I've pulled out the stats to disprove this kind of thing on here before. Frankly it's confirmation bias and completely untrue. And do you honestly think every goal scorer scores every game or even every other game? This isn't 80's Gretzky. Nobody is.   The leadership isnt there.   This is complete bullshit. You don't know that at all. Nash was the one having the team at his house and organizing things for the whole team after all. To say he's not a leader is ridiculous. I'm sure Cally and his 2 goals all playoffs is a shitty leader too.   I love the player, but with the cap space included you have to look at options like Steen or Backes. Steen is a much cheaper, 30 goal scorer. Backes is a hard nosed, versatile player.   Steen has scored more than 24 goals one time in his entire career and he's now on the wrong side of thirty. There's no reason to think he's going to start scoring even more.    Plus when you look at Nashs efforst in the playoffs (MOSTLY) I am ready to make moves. Its inconsistent.   The results haven't been there as much as we'd like, but if you're going to say the effort hasn't been there you just haven't been paying attention or have no idea what effort actually is. He is far from being a problem on this team."
rangers,3aemfi,bonesingyre,6,Fri Jun 19 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"Are you retarded? The Blues are the king of choke artists. Why would we want any of them? I'm gona assume Tarasenko isn't even in this discussion.  Steen is not a solid 30 goal scorer at all, he is not even remotely close to Nash in any respect. He hit 33 once in his career. Nash hits 30 most years and even the 40s in goals. Want playoff performances? Steen has 14 points in the playoffs total. Nash had 14 points this year. Same exact conversation could be said of Backes.  We should not trade Nash unless we can get some thing really good. St. Louis offers nothing close to that.  The rangers don't need anymore talent to fill the top 3 lines. We need either a superstar swap with Nash and someone else (not gona happen), or fill in our depth and talent pool because that bit us in the ass when Staal, McDonagh, Zucc, Girardi, Yandle, Fast were all carrying some medium to severe injuries.   It says a lot of your depth when 2 of your top d-men have broken feet/ankles, and are still being dressed up to play."
rangers,3aemfi,bonesingyre,-10,Fri Jun 19 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"I find it truly hilarious that you believe in choke artistry. And that I would be retarded for wanting a talented player with less cap. Of course Tarasenko is not involved in this discussion. If you read the reports, and had half a brain you would understand that Blues are making moves to shake up the team that has faied.  However just because they failed as a group, does not mean obtaining one or two of these guys will fail with us.... This whole ""choking"" aspect is ridiculous. Their whole team fails to beat better teams.   I do not think of hockey as a game of isolated pieces and parts. Its a system.   We abs need more talent. Look how we lost against Tampa. MSL is gone. And we will need to replace him. Furthermore it be nice to have a center who wins faceoffs. Your acting like we won something... we won nothing. Everyone faces injuries. Tampa's goalie for gods sake was injured in Game 2 of the finals.   It says nothing that coaches allowed people with broken legs to play. AV was outcoached by Cooper. Enough said."
rangers,3aemfi,fosiacat,5,Fri Jun 19 15:37:37 2015 UTC,"Why would we want to blow up our team and trade Nash? We won the presidents trophy. We made the ECF 3/4 years and the SCF once. We're one of the top teams in the East and you want to blow up our team and trade our best player for 1 or 2 guys who aren't even in the same category.  We don't need more top line talent at all. We need role players to fill in the 3rd and 4th lines and depth. Chicago contends each year because they have superstar talent and fill it in with solid role players and young prospects. Look at their lineup: Saad, Tuevo, Nordstrom, TVR, are all prospects who got the call up. They picked up Richards and Carcillo as role players. They traded for Vermette and Timo to shore up their defense. They didn't break their core.  You know who could have slotted in for Zucc or now that MSL is a UFA? Duclair. We didn't need to do the Yandle trade (hes pretty good though).   We lost to Tampa because we had injured defensive players and couldn't press them enough. We definitely scored a shit ton in that series so it wasn't offense.  I only agree with having a center who wins faceoffs. We're better off re-signing Brad Richards again.   http://www.blueshirtbanter.com/2015/6/19/8789289/a-comprehensive-guide-to-saving-the-new-york-rangers-cap-space  EDIT: Calling you retarded was very harsh and I apologize for that remark."

Then meditated on this for a second, your just negative. I mean look at the comment. I bring up a discussion of possible NHL players to trade for and you use profanity. Oh my...   I am amused by hockey fans sometimes. You bring up a discussion that is out there on NY Ranger fan sites and you never ever get a full agreement. There are always a couple who agree, a couple who disagree and then the rare person who comes out that has to make fun of the entire discussion.   That same person though, loves to bash all discussions yet still views them all.   Nothing is wrong with talking about this.  Ken Hitchcock LOVES Rick Nash. Why do some Ranger fans not? 8 million a year for a guy who is NOT carrying a team on his back. Did he improved from 2 seasons ago, fo sure. However there were still overall inconsistencies in his game. For example. The first 30 games he was on a scoring spree. He was crashing the net and he was a force to be reckon with... We were amazed! Then he started to slow down and ultimately was MIA. And into the playoffs he was very similar. However, at least he finished his checks and gotten a little edge on his game in the Tampa Series.   However its not his fault we lost.   However I am looking how to improve this team.   We need cap space.   So if WE CAN GET A GREAT PLAYER IN RETURN for NASH. Or a few dam good players. WHY THE HELL NOT?   Oh because its not NHL15.   No.. Its NHL16 mofo"

rangers,3aemfi,judge_death1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"Backes is a natural center, I think he'd stay there if we trade for him.

That's a quality shutdown line that can put up points as well."

I have faith that the Rangers will do so properly.  3) Trade Talbot for Edmonton's #33 and a defender of theirs. Do not resign Hunwick if thats the case. Do not resign Sheppard.   4) I expect the Rangers to thus have about 4 million to play with. Maybe 3 million. I would try to go after Joel Ward @ 3 million. If we have 4, I would go for one of the RW FA over at WPG. All 3 of these guys would be worthy RW in place for MSL.   Its nice to know that the worst case scenario, we just let Fast come up as he is.

rangers,3a9nyz,Djevvy,11,Thu Jun 18 09:38:03 2015 UTC,"Some more comments from the article /u/Vikingrage posted (some are pretty grim):  Hagelin on visiting Zuke at the hospital: Brassard and I, along with a swedish friend living in Jersey, went to visit Zuke. When we met him he wasn't able to get a single word out of his mouth. We understood that he was 100 percent okay mentally, but unable to articulate or speak. He struggled and ended up  lashing out in frustration. We went out in the hallway and started crying. It hit us hard. We had to really pull ourselves together before going back in (to zuke).  Hagelin is also quoted on saying that the right hand side of Zukes face was ""dragging"" and that there were tubes and stuff everywhere. The first few minutes they weren't sure if ""this was going to end ok"".  Zuccarello on seeing Hags being on the verge of tears: When I saw them (Hagelin, Brassard and friend) choking back tears, I struggled as well. It was even worse when mom came, and I could tell she was trying to stay strong. She had to excuse herself and pretend she had to go to the bathroom...  Zuccarello on being scared: I might not get 100 percent of my speech back, but that's ok. I can live with that. I'm calm now, but I was afraid at first. I didn't panic, but I was scared.I couldn't say a single word for five days.  Zuccarello on being ""Two Face"": I was like ""Two Face"". When I smiled, everything on one side of my face moved, but not the other. The shot hit me on the left side, and I lost control of the right side of my face, tongue, arm and fingers.  Zuccarello on next season: I'll be ready for the training camp in september, and ready to play in october. I feel great now. I've had a lot of headaches, but I'm better.  Brassard on seeing Zuke in the hostital: I had to take a timeout. It was really hard to see Mats that day. It's one of the most frightening thing I've seen. It was very tough emotionally. I'm glad he can play again. That's what the doctors are saying. His health is most important though, the doctors need to get the last word..."

There're some words and letters sometimes.. It might not get any better. But it works. I'm fine.  I've been to a speech therapist. Everything else, the body, feels good and healthy. I might not be fit after only eight weeks, but my head is feeling very well. I've regained the feel of my arm and face.  I haven't moved too much in eight weeks. It's been eight weeks tomorrow. That's why I can play. It's gonna be great to sweat again.  Until now I haven't been lifting weights or really pushing myself. I've been on the bike. I've taken it easy. You push yourself a little extra because It's The Cup. When it was over (NYR went out) I stopped. I only rested.  On being allowed to play in his charity game: I explained (to Rangers) what kind of game it was. That it was for charity. They supported me. Hopefully there won't be too many nasty hits. I'll try to avoid that. It's for a good cause, so I think it'll be alright.  On his team mates being involved in the charity game (Hayes, Brassard, Hagelin and Kreider are also playing): I haven't moved for eight weeks, so I'm sure I'll be the worst. The boys will have to ""carry me"" and show me how it's done. I hope the crowd will enjoy it. We'll do what we can to make it a fun game. It'll be very exciting!  Bonus quote from Brassard: I would've loved to have been here last year. We're here to support Zuccarello, the charity, and to see Norway. Mats has told us so many nice things about this country. We're really looking forward to staying here a couple of days and contribute to charity."

rangers,3a7l1x,bonesingyre,2,Thu Jun 18 14:50:18 2015 UTC,He'll be competing with Tim Erixon as well. Reilly still needs to work on defense so he might be in Rockford for a year. It depends on what the Hawks get for Sharp and Bickell.

rangers,3a7l1x,Ekardz,5,Wed Jun 17 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"He is in a similar situation Hayes was last year. They refuse to sign with their drafted team. Hayes got 900k from us, and a couple of years ago Justin Schultz pulled the same thing and got 925k from Edmonton, so I guess it'll be around that 900k ballpark. Apparently the top contenders for him are Rangers, Chicago, Kings, and Wild."

rangers,3a7l1x,booshyschmoozy,2,Thu Jun 18 11:07:49 2015 UTC,"Yes definitely. We've been in the conversation since the beginning, and most of the top rumor guys seem to think we're among the 3-4 finalists. If I had to guess who was the front-runner, I'd say Chicago since he's from the area and they're a Cup contender, but so are we. And we have plenty of connections - Skjei, Miller, Fogarty (off the top of my head) - and are in need of a player like him. I wouldn't be surprised if he signs with us."

rangers,3a7l1x,booshyschmoozy,2,Thu Jun 18 15:33:29 2015 UTC,Oh well. We don't have a need at puck moving defenseman right now anyway.
rangers,3a7l1x,FLRangerFan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"If we're looking to trade Yandle and/or Klein, i would say so.  Rangers set the bar on what to do with these young guys. Sign em low, but with lots of performance bonuses. Hayes has success, and he could too.   Biggest issue for him is ""why go to NYR when they have a solid D core already?"". Hence, look for the Rangers to send one of either Yandle or Klein packing. I think Klein is more likely. Then, when Boyle goes away next year, Skjei can come up (it looks unlikely that he will play this year, unless he changes his mind about it)."
rangers,3a7l1x,brother_of_menelaus,2,Wed Jun 17 23:07:55 2015 UTC,"Klein is almost definitely gone, he'll probably be packaged with Talbot for a nice return (hopefully EDM's no. 16 pick). Therefore Skjei will get the Duclair treatment (minus the being traded part) and get some experience. If he plays well he sticks around. If not, he can play in Hartford and Hunwick can take the 6th D spot, a role he's shown he can fill.  What I'm hoping for is a Kreider/Hayes situation, where their past as teammates drew Hayes to New York. Hopefully Reilly would be interested in coming to a team where one of his friends plays."

rangers,3a67dy,mso2219,5,Wed Jun 17 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't move Klein in that deal. Cory Schneider got the 9th overall pick a few years back and he was the same age as Talbot with around 20-25 more starts than Cam at the time he was traded compared to Cam now. I don't think those extra 20-25 starts = Klein in terms of value. I'd do Talbot & McIlrath for 16... Hagelin and Stepan should be the top priority IMO. Fast and Miller very likely won't be offer sheeted, so they can wait if their terms are too high.  Doubtful, unless it's a ""hockey trade""...he was better in the playoffs than previous years, but his 42 goals in the regular season are a big reason why were in the playoffs Yep...see ya Don't think he's going to be traded either. He wasn't awful...his cap hit is too high for what he brings, but at least it's only for 1 more season. Let Skjei play in the AHL for a year until he's more than ready."
rangers,3a67dy,booshyschmoozy,4,Wed Jun 17 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly think we should get a LITTLE more for that Talbot/Klein trade with EDM. Throw in someone we could actually use, instead of getting a prospect that'll be useful 5 years down the line."
rangers,3a67dy,ScythianPJ,3,Wed Jun 17 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"The problem is that this is a very deep draft, so the 16th pick is even more valuable. Talbot's value is also weakened for the fact that Ottawa and Vancouver are both shopping potential number 1 netminders. Sure, Cam is probably at the top of the available netminder list, but a guy who's relatively unproven in net is tough to justify trading a top pick for straight up."
rangers,3a67dy,Jwpt,2,Wed Jun 17 19:13:30 2015 UTC,Is there a chance we flip the 16th for maybe a 3rd line center who's a little selfish and takes shots a little too often?
rangers,3a67dy,booshyschmoozy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need a more selfish player, but why would we trade a potential starter (that's what we're billing Cam as, right?) and a top 4 D for a 3rd line center? - serious question, not being sarcastic..."
rangers,3a67dy,Jwpt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:10:42 2015 UTC,"It's that potential bit in there, Cam isn't a proven starter, he's only really proved he deserves a shot to be a starter. It's a big risk, especially with goalies, especially coming from a team with a stacked blue line. Klein might be top 4 on some teams and I believe he saw top 2 for some minutes in Nashville due to injuries, but realistically on a lot of teams he's a 4/5 not a 2/3. I doubt a 16th for a selfish 2/3 C would be straight up, I could see maybe getting a 2nd or 3rd round pick back, or possibility (though doubtfully because AV) getting rid of Glass' contract."
rangers,3a67dy,booshyschmoozy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. I posted below about Schneider getting the 9th overall pick a few years back...and granted Schneider is the better goalie of the two, but he was still relatively unproven back then. I wouldn't put Talbot's value that much lower to where you need to include a top 4 defenseman (with a bottom 6 salary) in order to get a pick that's 6 picks later."

rangers,3a67dy,Ben_Ulrand,2,Wed Jun 17 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Stepan is really the only MUST sign.  He's part of the core.  Hagelin may get moved.  I love the guy and he fits AV's system, but his production, or lack thereof, may not be worth what he'll likely ask for.  You can find a similar player for less.  But Fast and Miller are really emerging as important players and I'd be surprised if Sather didn't hold on to them.  The only way Marty stays if he takes a HUGE pay cut and less playing time.  I could see it going either way, but, yes, he's probably done."

rangers,3a5rzi,joeybriggs,7,Wed Jun 17 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"Man,  this is a weird offseason. Rangers are in this weirdest transition I remember them being in. They aren't in the shutdown d team anymore (yandle and boyle) but they aren't fully committed to the d jumping (girardi), they have young guys (kreider, miller, hayes) and they have old guys (st louis, boyle, moore), a goalie who's biological cup clock is clicking (my cousin vinny reference), they have a goal scorer who gets them to the playoffs but can't score there (nash) who gets more shit than Stamkos does, yet they were 20 minutes away from the finals with a d core with broken legs.  I am glad I am not the GM!"
rangers,3a5rzi,tomlambsays,5,Wed Jun 17 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"Whatever happens, I hope NYR doesn't deal for Phil Kessel.  Guy is lazy with conditioning and diet, which effects his mindset and hunger to win.  Decadent physiques accompany decadent minds and Phil is pretty lazy when back checking.  Such a one way player, it's a joke."

rangers,3a5rzi,mjh84,4,Wed Jun 17 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"There is no way Edmonton would give up a top center who has Elite potential for Talbot, Klein and Glass. Its just not enough value going over to Edmonton. To be honest, I don't even think they would make that deal for Yakupov.   On the topic of Nash, he isn't going anywhere. His contract is too big to move unless we eat some of his contract, which isn't going to happen and lets not forget he scored 42 goals. Who else is going to give us that kind of production. If Nash was traded, we wouldn't be getting an elite scoring forward for him, that would just be a silly trade, so we would be getting prospects and ""middle tier"" forwards/d-men which wouldn't come close to matching Nash's regular season production.  And I agree that guys like Skjei and Buchnevich should get a chance but at the same time, I doubt they would get a big chance. They would probably do what they did with Duclair at the beginning of last season. Let him play a few games, get his feet wet, and send him back to the minors to mature. I also agree that we should trade Mcllrath while he still has some value."

Look at Matthew Barnaby, Kasparaitis, Avery, Rupp. Big Buff is a physical force which is something I think the Rangers are lacking. He'll clear the crease for Hank which is something they didn't do too well throughout the playoffs."
rangers,3a5rzi,Ben_Ulrand,3,Wed Jun 17 18:55:47 2015 UTC,"I like you.  This team is a little too vanilla and a little too soft. Teams can and have taken liberties with our guys. Look at the Capitals series. Our guys were getting banged up left and right. The physicality of that series, in addition to no Zucc, cost us the ECF.   Even without counting my personal bias for big, physical players, I think a Byfuglien/Lucic type is something we need."
rangers,3a5rzi,HighPlainDrifter,2,Thu Jun 18 02:19:34 2015 UTC,I do too. Plus one that can actually play. What Ranger fan wouldn't want to see him bomb some slapshots from the blue line?  We all saw that dirty play on JT Miller a few months ago. I don't doubt that he has some discipline issues. But the guy is a physical force and there isn't anyone on the team that currently will clear the crease for Hank. Buff can do that.
rangers,3a5rzi,Incandenza2015,3,Thu Jun 18 02:47:35 2015 UTC,"Edmonton is willing to give up the 16th pick, but they don't believe Talbot is worth more than a 2nd. Realistically, Klein and Talbot for the 16th is possible, but it depends on NYR's confidence in Brady Skjei. RNH is a huge reach, EDM have been in transition for too long to give up a core guy like that, unless it was an absolute steal. Nash for Malkin? That's comical, just stop. Nash to Buffalo is a little more interesting, but I still doubt it. While the Rangers are looking to re-stock the cupboard a bit and clear some cap, Nash is still important as a regular season goal scorer and very responsible defensively. He also has a no move clause, which I believe becomes a partial no move this summer but I'm not sure. McIlrath being dealt would probably return nothing of real value. Funny how the Wolf Pack coaches talked up his improvement to end this season, seems like a trade ploy to me, the dude skates like he's got a loaded diaper on. We have forward depth now that Miller and Fast have proven they can play, so Buchnevich is on the outside for now. Like I said before though, Skjei could be very important next year..."
rangers,3a5rzi,ncolaros,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:36:10 2015 UTC,"The only way we trade Nash is if we get a similar package to what we traded to Columbus for him which is unlikely to happen.  As for Talbot, I think him to the Oilers is going to happen. I think it'll be for the 16th overall pick. But it'll take a bit more than Talbot. So here's an offer I think could work-- Cam Talbot and Kevin Klein for Oilers 16th Pick and LW Prospect Mitch Moroz. Moroz is 6'3"" 214lbs, a former 2nd round pick, and he's 21 years old. He struggled a bit in the AHL but showed in juniors that he has a knack for scoring.   Fact is, Dan Boyle isn't going. As much as I like Klein, he's the most expendable: he's 30 years old, still has several years on his contract, and we just are pouring too much money into defensemen. Our top four of G-McD/Staal-Yandle is still one of the best top four in the league. I think at this point, we have to give one of our young defensemen a legitimate chance. One of Allen, Bodie, or McIlrath. We re-sign Hunwick as well. A third pairing of Boyle and one of those four isn't bad. Fact is a defensive grouping like that is still solid and one of the best in the NHL. We have options, it's time we put them to use instead of throw money at defensemen and trade picks.   It's also time we give Lindberg a fair chance to crack the bottom six. Fast was given a chance, time for Lindberg."

As you can imagine, there's a lot of disappointment; a huge contrast to the Hawks, who they can hear celebrating. Even though they can rationalize how it was a great season compared to last year + good experience, there's never a guarantee that you'll be in another Cup final, and that alone is a pretty heavy feeling (they use Brendan Marrow as an example, of how when he made the SCF with the Dallas Stars -- said he was kind of naive at the time thinking it was a more common occurence).

rangers,3a35dr,AoifeCheeks,3,Tue Jun 16 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"I want Brad to come back, especially at a contract that would be in the 1.5M-2M range. He's a great fit here, he provides great leadership, and could help our team. But there's three reasons why it doesn't look too promising that he'll be back in the a Rangers sweater. Those reasons are:   Cap problems. We need to resign our guys first and see where we stand after that.  We need to find a replacement for MSL. We are in full on win now mode and getting a great replacement for MSL on the second line wing is extremely important. I believe Frolik would be a perfect fit for that role, but we'd have to play our cards extremely well for that to happen.  Roster space. Hypothetically, let's say everything this offseason goes beautifully. We've got all our free agents back, we've signed Frolik, and by some grace of God we have about $2M in cap space. Great, Broadway Brad is making a comeback! Where are we going to put him? This is what our lines would look like pre-Brad.      LW C RW    Kreider Stepan Nash   Zuccarello Brassard Frolik   Hagelin Hayes Miller   Sheppard Moore Fast    Where would we put him? The only thing that comes to my mind would be not resigning Shep, bring Miller down, Hayes to 3rd line RW and Brad in the middle, which actually doesn't sound too bad. I just hate losing Shep though, he provides that Brian Boyle-esque presence down there. I'd love to see Brad come back, but it's going to take a lot to bring him back."

rangers,3a35dr,mso2219,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"I have said this many times in cases of many different players - The Rangers need to focus on bringing in players that are not only good, but also good with handling NY. I think all nyc teams need to have this mind set. For richie, I think he was a great player but based off of a couple of things he said, the contract really weighed on him. That's one thing that won't exist if he comes back to NYC, but I think it is telling that he can't shrug off the spotlight the nyc area can put on him. If he comes back here, every second he is slow, it will be ""Oh he is too old. OLD MAN GO AWAY!""   To give a good example, I remember watching a documentary on messier when his sister was interviewed, she spoke about how much hate messier was getting when they finished terribly in 93. She said messier's response was along the lines of, ""It's okay. that's their opinion. they have every right to feel that way.""

Losing in the Stanley Cup. You can't say for certain what the Rangers would be with either of those guys resigned.  But Hayes is just a rookie would he have made the team and got a chance?  If he was like a 29 year old experienced player maybe a 2 to 3 line player that has proven himself, than he would have had more chances.   Maybe the only reason why they're taking shots is because they know they lost a great player that could help them in the future."

rangers,3a1n77,high5sexwhoa,0,Tue Jun 16 16:07:35 2015 UTC,I think Hayes was ultimately intended to be a replacement for Patrick Sharp whom they cannot afford to keep next year unless they shed some cap space elsewhere. Their gamble payed off. They won another cup.
rangers,3a1n77,isthatyoujohnwayne_,6,Wed Jun 17 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, im sure he'd love to be in the AHL watching the main club win, instead of the chance to actually play in the ECF."
rangers,3a1n77,brother_of_menelaus,2,Tue Jun 16 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Chances are Hayes (and the others they mention) wouldn't have been playing or seeing significant time. Is it really ""winning the Cup"" if you're just there in a suit and tie following everyone else around?   Additionally, not only did it make more financial sense in the short term, but the long term as well. Chicago is about to start paying Kane and Toews $21 mil combined for the next 8 years. Had Hayes signed with them, he'd be looking at low-ball contracts until he reaches UFA status because of the Hawks' cap crunch."
rangers,3a1n77,F_urOpinion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Isn't it crazy how the Hawks lost 3 young centers with some real nice scoring potential? Hayes (FA), Pirri, and Morin (both traded away). That seems pretty silly to me. Richards was obviously a 1 year thing. Vermette likely won't re-sign there. Now they're going to have to shed salary space and retool the team while likely losing Sharp, Oduya, possibly Bickell, and possibly Crawford.   Their only true C behind Toews is Kruger, they do have Teravainen, who played wing these playoffs, but has originally been a center, still he's got some more development to go for on the defensive side of his game. They also have Shaw, who isn't really a natural C. So now they're quite limited at C, don't understand why they didn't keep more than 1 of their young 4 C's (Teravainen, Hayes, Pirri, and Morin), because the best way to retool your team after cap casualties is with good young players who can grow whilst having a cheap contract. Just a bit of a curious situation."
rangers,3a1n77,jedimasterchief,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:04:43 2015 UTC,"Let's do a little butterfly effect. Hayes signs with the Hawks. If he does make the roster, he's on the team. They reason he didn't sign is because he wanted PT. let's say it goes similar to how he was on the Rangers, slow start but earned his spot. Now do the Hawks trade for Vermette at the deadline? Hayes plays center. I'd say probably not. Without Vermette there's no victory in Ana or game 5 in Tampa. Hawks lose before the cup."
rangers,3a1n77,rvbcaboose1018,0,Tue Jun 16 15:29:19 2015 UTC,"The Hayes/Hawks situation is a bit tough to really figure out. Since, Hayes didn't leave out of spite (even though he wasn't happy with how they handled his brothers situation). He left because the team didn't exactly have a whole lot of space for a young player like him to get a legitimate chance to start. It took an injury to Patrick Kane for them to insert Teuvo into the lineup and show that he could play.  It didn't seem like Hayes would have cracked a roster spot this season. Him signing with the Rangers, we had spots available and he took wound up taking advantage of it. Honestly, it worked out well for all parties involved. Hayes has shown he could play at the big level at both C and wing and the Rangers have a legitimate role player on their team, and the Hawks won a Cup."
rangers,3a1n77,THEDoughBOI,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Hayes a cap casualty? Chicago has been playing things rather close to the chest when it comes to cap space, i was under the thought that Hayes left because A) They couldn't keep him and B) He wanted a bigger role (and more money), something that he probably wouldn't have gotten in Chicago. Hell, Hawks didn't bring Teräväinen in till past the halfway point of the season. Doubt Hayes has any role on the team there.   In a way though, its kinda flattering. Normally fans don't think about the players they loose in the offseason, and Hayes didn't strike me as a really beloved player in Chicago. I think those fans are just upset that their front office has managed their cap pretty poorly (worse then us i think), and it cost them a chance at a potentially pretty good player."

rangers,39zstf,zmars26,14,Tue Jun 16 06:59:34 2015 UTC,"I just got a chance to watch the game. It leaves me with really, really mixed feelings. I was rooting for the Hawks for a few reasons -- I don't really harbour any bad feelings against them, I always wish we had gone up against them last year (and this year, too), and when Broadway Brad + Carbomb were signed over, it was hard for me to not to develop a bit of a soft spot for them. Even though we have some ex-Rangers on Tampa, I just could not root for them knowing that they were the team that got in the way of our chance at getting Hank the Cup.  Any ways, when I saw Richards make a pass to Kane for the second goal...it was so fucking emotional. I don't even know why, but it honestly made me tear up. I guess it was a mix of feelings of poetic justice, happy for Richards, but that disappointment knowing that that wasn't our team. I mean, I remember when there was only about 5-8 minutes left, I felt a bit of that excited anticipation of being so close...but then I realized how weird it was. There was disappointment underling it, knowing that I have yet to have an opportunity to really feel like that about the Rangers. Sigh...I dunno. It's tough. (By the way, if any Hawks fans are reading this, seriously, relish in these moments.)  Any ways, I don't mean to make this so depressing...there's just a lot of mixed feelings right now."
rangers,39zstf,keetner,6,Tue Jun 16 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"yeah trust me man i feel you.  all i wanted this year and last was to win one. i honestly just want one, and i'll be okay for the next 20 or so years. to have to think every year, year after year, ""maybe next year"" is getting harder to swallow as i grow older.  i cant even fucking imagine how it must feel to be a team like the blues, or the canucks. just, never winning it. its been 21 years and will be 22 years and seriously it feels like sooo long ago (i mean it sort of was).  its a key part of my mind's eye in terms of life accomplishments. for me to be in the building when the rangers win.....i could die happy.  fuck. 3 cups in 6 years.....after all the years of heartache...they deserve it. they didnt have a fucking TV deal for a few years after the lockout. they brought that franchise back from the dead into pure glory. 3 cups. cant even imagine it."
rangers,39zstf,x94x,5,Tue Jun 16 06:43:21 2015 UTC,"Your words are very kind. It's not overly common for fans of other teams to remember/recognize the ""heartache years."" I grew up with it. We were SO awful. These last few years have been surreal and I BADLY want the Rangers to get a slice of the pie.   I have wanted a Rangers/Hawks final for a long time, and a huge reason for that is because I know if the Rangers win I could still be happy. I couldn't wish loss on my team but truly I want to see a Rangers win too. Seeing Kimmo hoist it tonight was awesome, but seeing Hank do it would just be magical. I believe your time is coming!"

Why remain butt-hurt and vengeful over it?? I really don't get it.  I was actually rooting for them, because I saw a lot of aspects to their play that were similar to many of the reasons that I like the Rangers for. Sure, I'd rather be rooting for the Rangers in the SCF, but that doesn't automatically mean that I should be hoping that the team who took us out should lose."
rangers,39zstf,Nezirsc,2,Wed Jun 17 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"The Blackhawks are my father's favorite team, so I had a reason to root for them. I was happy that they were able shut-out the Lightning, who I felt indifferent about during the regular season, until they shut us out during games 5 and 7 and then my defense mechanisms clicked in and the indifference turned to frustrated annoyance.   Anyway, I don't feel like rooting for a team I don't care about because they are the better team and sometimes it's okay to feel butt-hurt and vengeful over things that really don't matter in the long run. I don’t feel like being the bigger person all the time and seeing as I am just fan, I don’t need to carry the kind of sportsmanship that athletes do.   That being said, I got over the loss a few days after game 7 and am looking forward to next season. I just thought it there was some sort coincidence that Tampa was ousted with the shutout."

They clearly have a great chemistry, as we have seen the last two years. They seem to be best friends, constantly hanging out on Instagram together, going to charity games/events. Why would someone break them up? Zucc skated before game 5 of the TBL series. He hung around and saw Brass. Look how Brass played that night."

I think Stamkos is in for a pay day, probably looking at ~$9 million a season on his new contract, maybe $8.5 mill - he's a goal scorer who just came off a great season and a stanley cup final series so he will get his $. I doubt he will go anywhere at all or that Tampa is even considering the idea of trading him or letting him walk."

It maddens me that Bishop played in a Cup Final. We won't even hear this guy's name in a few years. What a shitty goalie.

Three of them were about as relevant as if he saved them for three months for the preseason. Meanwhile Johnson puts up 9 go-ahead goals in these playoffs. Chicago's got half a dozen guys who have a reputation for showing up big in the playoffs and won another cup to no one's surprise. Not putting it all on Nash when most of our forwards were doing too little for a successful cup run but I'd love it if Nash was scoring and we were winning cups instead of it being an uphill climb every year.

I liked Sather's hard line stance though to say I don't give a fuck if you are captain I make the decisions not you.

rangers,39x4nc,tehburaldeh,6,Mon Jun 15 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"Honest question here. I don't really pay to much attention to Toronto but I know Phil Kessel is a great player. What has he done to make him ""uncoachable""? I always thought that there was a bad team around him"
rangers,39x4nc,Ralph_Baconader,13,Mon Jun 15 15:25:14 2015 UTC,The Leafs ex-coach Ron Wilson said that Phil Kessel was uncoachable. I don't think that anyone else actually believes that in the hockey world. It's just become a circlejerk quote that is a jab at the Leafs being a horribly managed organization in recent years. At the all star draft Toews even made a joke about it
rangers,39x4nc,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"When Kessel scored a natural hatty one game in college, his coach told him that if he took the game seriously he could do that every game and then some.   A Leafs assistant coach just recently was asked to draw up a new break out scheme. He came out to say Kessel refused to practice it. He went to the coach and the coach and he said that its typical. However he will get away with it because he is the superstar player. We are just coaches.   Is this really all that shocking? I have played/coached with/against these type of players. They are use to getting things there way. They rely heavily on talent and its usually enough. Kessel doesnt look like the type of guy who works exceptionally hard at his game. Some guys are this way and can still succeed.   He seems to me an offensive focused type of guy. A guy who will glide back on defense. Who will give 50% to defensive duties. But once he gets the puck, lights out."
rangers,39x4nc,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:56:23 2015 UTC,Yea... He also happened to choose teams that were exceptionally loaded with talent lol.   I mean of course he wants to play for us. NY is nothing like Toronto. The media is half the BS.   The trade would likely be Kessel for Nash
rangers,39x4nc,guyzieman,10,Mon Jun 15 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest though, like 97% of the high profile players on the trading block in the cap era have said they'd waive their NTC/NMC to come to the Rangers. Point aside we don't exactly have the cap space or the lineup spot to accommodate him without blowing up our top 6."
rangers,39x4nc,SteamHole,10,Mon Jun 15 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, it is Kessel, he is an Olympian and has great regular season numbers. But I'd imagine Nash would have to go before taking on his contract, unless Sather can pull off a Yandle type deal where they retain some of his contract."
rangers,39x4nc,77Columbus,14,Mon Jun 15 16:47:19 2015 UTC,I had a crazy vision of Sather trading Talbot and Klein to Edmonton for their 16th overall and then using that pick plus a defensive prospect to get Kessel from Toronto while they retain most of his contract.

rangers,39x4nc,Screwbit,13,Mon Jun 15 18:57:08 2015 UTC,dont think so.  Kessel has never scored 40 goals and is terrible defensively.  And he costs more than Nash.
rangers,39x4nc,TheSensation19,3,Mon Jun 15 19:13:54 2015 UTC,Yea. I am with you on his lack of defense and focus. Costing more and longer. And ultimately I like Nash. I think Nash is better than Kessel.

The only thing I could possibly think of would be a change of scenery type deal, Nash for Kessel straight up. Otherwise It'd be hard to take that kind of salary without sending quite a few contracts their way or having quite a bit of salary retained. Although I'm thinking I'd rather have Nash."
rangers,39x4nc,SteamHole,5,Mon Jun 15 16:28:20 2015 UTC,Straight up Nash for Kessel could be an idea. Kessel is younger and signed for longer but who knows what Sather is thinking.

rangers,39x4nc,puckinright,2,Mon Jun 15 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"OP needs to change the title of this sub.  The NYR are an approved team on Kessel's NMC, there is no waiving required. He can be traded to any of those 8 teams without his input.  He would have to waive his NMC to go to a team NOT on the list."
rangers,39x4nc,rvbcaboose1018,2,Mon Jun 15 17:11:31 2015 UTC,"He would, but it would take quite a lot if you ask me.   First, Rangers would need to shed cap. Losing marty's 5.5 is a step in the right direction, but most of that would go to Stepan in what would probably be a 5.5+ AAV deal. 6.25 worst case. Getting Kessle means no Hags next year. Realistically, Toronto would need to hold on to some cap. At an 8 million AAV Cap hit, they would need to retain at least half to make things manageable.   Then, theres what you get for him. Toronto wants young guys. This means any deal for Kessel would involve top prospects (Skjei, buchnevich, Lindberg, and maybe even Allen), young players (Hayes, Kreider, Fast, Miller, Talbot) and, worse, draft picks."
rangers,39x4nc,SirusRiddler,2,Mon Jun 15 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like Rangers haven't had the best luck in getting star players to retain their great numbers that they had playing with their previous teams. Like St. Louis and Rick Nash (though, with him, I'll chalk it up to a slow start)."

rangers,39x4nc,aceofpayne,3,Tue Jun 16 00:14:50 2015 UTC,Head me out guys. I'm going to make this somewhat of a possibility with this off season.   Talbot and klien go to the oilers for their 16th and let's say ptbnl (no idea who but probably a prospect or 4th line guy) that frees up a little cap. St Louis retires or moves on in free agency (reports of him moving on have come out). Then to get kessel we give the leafs the pic we just got plus one of the prospects close to the big time  for kessel. Keeps us close to the cap and its kinda possible. Long shot but one can hope

rangers,39y9hn,EarnSquirm,19,Mon Jun 15 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"From the article:   The average NHL goalie stopped 1.037377 Goals Above Average in 2014-15   The average NHL goalie played 2,267 minutes in 2014-15 The average NHL goalie had a cap hit of $3,011,066 in 2014-15   Taking these three findings into account, we can bundle them into a single, concise ""going rate"" of the average NHL goalie in 2014-15: - The typical NHL goalie stopped 0.027525 Goals Above Average per 60 minutes, paid at a $3,011,066 cap hit  So...  How does King Henrik compare relative to that clearinghouse rate? - Lundqvist stopped 10.43 Goals Above Average in 2014-15 - Lundqvist played 2,743 minutes in 2014-15 - Lundqvist had a cap hit of $8,500,000 in 2014-15  Therefore... - Lundqvist stopped 0.228144 Goals Above Average per 60 minutes, paid at a $8,500,000 cap hit  How does Lundqvist directly contrast against our mean findings? - Lundqvist's GSAA/hour rate was 8.29 times the NHL's average goalie rate - Lundqvist's salary cap hit was 2.82 times the NHL's average goalie cap hit  In essence, Lundqvist performed over 8.3 times the market rate for only 2.8 times the price!"

rangers,39y9hn,HeadForTheSHallows,7,Tue Jun 16 11:28:50 2015 UTC,"Only saying this to play devil's advocate, but Kane & Toews' cap hits don't get astronomical til next season."
rangers,39y9hn,SteamHole,3,Tue Jun 16 11:57:49 2015 UTC,Yessss you're absolutely right. I guess we'll see what this does to the Blackhawks. I'm sure they're getting some nice bonuses with their 3rd cup as of last night...
rangers,39y9hn,mjh84,3,Tue Jun 16 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"Of course it hurts...because it's so large in a sport with a limited cap. The real question should be ""Is his cap hit worth it?"". My answer to that is 'yes'."
rangers,39y9hn,Darclite,4,Tue Jun 16 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"Glad this was done, helps when you see someone say that we should trade Hank because of the contract. I get that it's frustrating that the two goalies in the finals right now are fucking Crawford and Bishop and that points to the idea that you can win without an elite goalie, but we're not built that way. We aren't a very good team without Hank. Hank's WAR is the best of any goalie in the past decade and puts him as the sixth overall player of the period. We aren't going to suddenly get those wins from somewhere else."
rangers,39y9hn,ANGR1ST,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"How does Talbot stack up in the same analysis?  Even if we're getting a ""deal"" on Hank's performance, that still doesn't mean we wouldn't be better off with Talbot in net and another expensive forward.  Look at Crawford. You don't need elite goaltending to win if the rest of your team is put together well. We're not there yet, just flat removing Hank would hurt too much. But if we brought in the right talent for him I think we could fix the issues up front."
rangers,39y9hn,ANGR1ST,2,Tue Jun 16 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"The average rate established in 2014-15 was:  1.0374 goals saved above average per 2,267 minutes (or 0.027525 GSAA/hour) @ $3,011,066 salary  Talbot put up:  11.6 GSAA in 2,095 minutes (or 0.33222 GSAA/hr) @ $562,500 salary  So...  Talbot's quality-of-play (GSAA/hr) was 12.07x the NHL average  Talbot's salary was only 18.7% of the NHL average goalie  Talbot's play was 12x the average quality for less than one-fifth the price  However...  Talbot's salary jumps from $562,500 this year to $1,450,000 next year  If we treat Talbot's $ last season like he was being paid next season's $...  Talbot still played more than 12x as good as the average goalie for less than half the market price"
rangers,39y9hn,ANGR1ST,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   Talbot still played more than 12x as good as the average goalie for less than half the market price  In essence, Lundqvist performed over 8.3 times the market rate for only 2.8 times the price!   So normalizing quality over average goalie price:  24 for Talbot, 8.3/2.8 = 2.96 for Lundqvist. Hmmmm."
rangers,39y9hn,joeybriggs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"Other factor is this: Lundqvist guaranteed to be under contract for years to come. He's proven consistency and ability to perform excellently in big-pressure situations. Talbot is younger, but only 1 year away from Unrestricted Free Agency. He's only played a few minutes in the NHL playoffs in his career, and never played more than 36 games in a season. He hasn't been on the world stage, so investing big in him to be that guy is a lot less certain than Lundqvist.  So the tradeoff is: Talbot is younger and cheaper, but not contractually locked up nor a proven track record for huge workloads or pressure-cooker games. Lundqvist is older, but guaranteed to play games for many years, with an impeccable reputation, although expensive and less-economical than Talbot's numbers."
rangers,39y9hn,blueshirtdave,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Based on the way Talbot handled Hank's injury, I expect that he'd perform very well as ""the man"". Sure, there's some risk in that, but I'm pretty confident that he's less of a headcase than many of the other goalies out there.  I don't see Hank with the ""impeccable reputation"" that many in this sub do. He tilts very hard in big games when facing adversity. He choked in the ECF against the Devils. But yes, he's still a great goaltender.  It bothers me that people equate Hank with the entire team. I was a fan long before he was our goalie, and I will be long after. If dealing him wins us a cup I'm all for it. But we need the kinds of analysis that you put up along with an honest conversation about him that not many seem to want to have."

rangers,39vd0r,LIGuy631,3,Mon Jun 15 14:41:22 2015 UTC,"Here's some stats of MSL play over the entire season:  October - 6 points in 9 games (4 games w/no points)  November - 12 points in 14 games (5 games w/no points)  December - 9 points in 12 games (5 games w/no points)  January - 8 points in 12 games (6 games w/no points)  February - 8 points in 14 games (9 games w/no points)  March - 3 points in 7 games (5 games w/no points)  April - 5 points in 6 games (2 games w/no points)  Playoffs - 7 points in 19 games (13 games w/no points)  To put that in perspective, he had no points in 36 games this year (almost half the season) and only 1 goal in the playoffs. So yes, he had 52 points on the year but his numbers dropped off in the second half of the year and he was held pointless on far too many games to justify bringing back even at veteran minimum."
rangers,39vd0r,RhynoSorceress,-1,Mon Jun 15 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me when he got injured his production went down? Woah, mind blowing."
rangers,39vd0r,ESEADupes,3,Mon Jun 15 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"He was playing bad before the injury too. The main point was to show how many games he went without a point (36) and that at his age, his body just cannot keep up with the grind of a full season and long playoff run. He had 1 goal the entire playoffs. If you want to pretend that he was the catalyst to our offence last year then go right ahead but you're wrong."
rangers,39vd0r,RhynoSorceress,2,Mon Jun 15 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"I like the dude, but they need to drop him like a bad habit..."
rangers,39vd0r,Fiedy88,2,Mon Jun 15 13:07:29 2015 UTC,"This isn't about cap space, per se. We could technically get him to come back at the league minimum.  His roster spot is valuable. We have plenty of in-house options (Tambellini, Bourque, Lindberg) that could be given a chance next season.   His regular season production could be replaced by any of them at a tiny fraction of his cost."
rangers,39vd0r,_TheConsumer_,2,Mon Jun 15 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of comments saying bring him back on a bonus laden vet minimum contract. If anything, he would get something like $2.5-3 million in bonuses. (most likely 15+ goals, point totals relative to team, 50+ points, and playoff performance)That would put the Rangers in another bind next season with dead money in bonus overages paid out. I think mutual separation is in both parties best interest."
rangers,39vd0r,PhilthyPhil666,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"If they can keep all the young guys and bring Marty back for 1 season (with minimum salary and bonuses) I think it would be great. Sure, he really fell off in the playoffs but he was really good in the regular season and is a great veteran."
rangers,39vd0r,zuccarelloislife,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:41:34 2015 UTC,I like his attitude and all but let him go. He's past his prime and Kessel would contribute a lot for an offense that sometimes sputtered in big games. Free up cap-space.
rangers,39vd0r,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:35:35 2015 UTC,This makes me so sad. It's the right move but I wish he could have won while he was here. He should have came in 2011-12 instead of re-signing with Tbay.

rangers,39v2qo,thehockeychimp,26,Mon Jun 15 01:11:57 2015 UTC,We was probably our best defensemen in the Lightning series anyway.
rangers,39v2qo,ncolaros,2,Mon Jun 15 01:48:03 2015 UTC,"I said it after game 7. I thought he was our best skater that night, which wasn't hard to be but he really stepped up in McD's absence."
rangers,39v2qo,bu77munch,2,Mon Jun 15 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"Best skater by default. Jk though, I'm excited to see what he can do after training camp. I feel like more often than not, big trades at the deadline result in an initial drop in performance."
rangers,39v2qo,rangers8905,13,Tue Jun 16 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Find me a top pairing defenseman who is 28 years old, who is excellent at moving the puck and who cost $2.5m? You can't do it. He's a UFDA after the season no one is going to trade for him. We wouldn't get anything for it.   Anyone saying he sucks needs to go back and watch the Tampa series. He's our best defenseman. Hell start with the middle of the Washington series and see that Yandle rising up and plays incredibly."
rangers,39v2qo,jedimasterchief,2,Mon Jun 15 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"Our best offensive defenseman. In terms of the whole package, I don't know how anyone could say our best defenseman isn't mcdonagh without diving into cherry picked advanced stats"
rangers,39v2qo,onebandonesound,2,Mon Jun 15 04:19:25 2015 UTC,I was solely referring to the Tampa and Washinggton series. McD played like hot garbage a lot. Yandle played better.
rangers,39v2qo,jedimasterchief,4,Mon Jun 15 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"Ah gotcha. I took ""he's"" as he is, not he was"
rangers,39v2qo,onebandonesound,-5,Mon Jun 15 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"Thats exactly why you move him. We already have a top pair (mcd + G). We already have a second pair (staal +klein/boyle/hunwick).   This is a cheap commodity with extreme upside.   After this year when his contract is up, are we going to continue to overpay on defense, when our obvious issue is lack of scoring and forward depth? If we can move one of Girardi/Staal/Boyle, OK. We cant be spending 50% of the salary cap on the D-Core and Hank.   Look at chicago. They're running Keith-Hjalarmasson and Seabrook-Oduya for basically all 60 minutes of the game. If you have the horses, run them. Their 5,6 defensemen are irrelevant."
rangers,39v2qo,profchaos2001,5,Mon Jun 15 07:16:00 2015 UTC,"Thats exactly why you move him. We already have a top pair (mcd + G). We already have a second pair (staal +klein/boyle/hunwick).    Hunwick is good, but he can't crack the second pairing at the same level of skill as the rest of the NYR D - including Yandle.   Look at chicago. They're running Keith-Hjalarmasson and Seabrook-Oduya for basically all 60 minutes of the game. If you have the horses, run them. Their 5,6 defensemen are irrelevant.   This isn't an ideal situation; CHI is pushing their top 4 primarily because their 5 & 6 D-men aren't capable of keeping up. The Rangers D-core can, from Mac at #1 to Hunwick at #7.  Yes, Sather could deal Yandle, but it wouldn't net a return that's as valuable as keeping him on the roster."
rangers,39v2qo,evanhc,-8,Mon Jun 15 13:25:16 2015 UTC,"They're in the Stanley Cup and we're not. They also have the series lead on the Lightning which we couldn't get, despite no home advantage. I wouldn't say their defensive situation isn't working."
rangers,39v2qo,profchaos2001,10,Mon Jun 15 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"We didn't lose to the Lightning because of our defense. That's why they scored goals on us, but we got shut out twice at home. Our offense was the problem. Chicago is successful because they have a ridiculous amount of offensive depth. Running with four d-men isn't sustainable."
rangers,39v2qo,mantiseye,-5,Mon Jun 15 14:42:23 2015 UTC,"Are you ever watching the series dude?  Every game Chicago has won was 2-1. They're not being carried by offense. In fact, their D got pounded every shift in their own zone vs. Anaheim and theyre still shutting down Tampa's offense better than we did. So no, it is clearly sustainable."
rangers,39v2qo,profchaos2001,3,Mon Jun 15 16:11:18 2015 UTC,They also have two of the best players in the game on offense in Kane and Toews. Getting rid of Yandle won't help us more than it would hurt us because we wouldn't be able to acquire that kind of talent from trading him.
rangers,39v2qo,The_Other_Manning,-4,Mon Jun 15 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"As I said to the other poster, Chicago has won every game this series 2-1. Their offense is not carrying them."
rangers,39v2qo,profchaos2001,2,Mon Jun 15 16:13:09 2015 UTC,Let's say Slats wants to trade him. What do you expect to get in return? We definitely aren't getting A 1st round for a rental 1 year. We could get a mid round and a prospect/player. Yandle would need to approve of the trade. To me it is like the situation with  Leddy. However Leddy was a RFA.
rangers,39v2qo,jedimasterchief,-2,Mon Jun 15 15:14:44 2015 UTC,Anything. It's the same as the Callahan situation. They're not worth the money they'll get on the free market. Move him now to get the best value (I.E. a full year with another team that wants some offense on the backend) instead of a 3 month rental at the deadline or nothing if we keep him until July 1st next year.
rangers,39v2qo,profchaos2001,2,Mon Jun 15 16:15:35 2015 UTC,Can someone please state the case for Hunwick because I wasn't that impressed with him.
rangers,39v2qo,callmesnake13,8,Mon Jun 15 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Everyone needs to read the Dave Tippette quote about defensemen.
rangers,39v2qo,arunnair87,4,Mon Jun 15 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"I think that should just be a general required reading, even regardless of this thread."
rangers,39v2qo,tj_sad_boi_666,5,Mon Jun 15 16:43:42 2015 UTC,...Do people want Yandle to be traded?
rangers,39v2qo,JKaye57,2,Mon Jun 15 14:32:29 2015 UTC,People who don't really follow the team. He was slow to start but there's no way we made it to seven against Tampa without him.
rangers,39v2qo,callmesnake13,9,Mon Jun 15 19:37:04 2015 UTC,People who don't realize that Yandle is great don't have a very good handle (Yandle) on the game.
rangers,39v2qo,adamrobertt,3,Mon Jun 15 03:21:23 2015 UTC,"Have people actually been talking about Yandle being traded? If anything, I've heard Klein's name more.   His performance in the post-season has already been addressed, though -- he injured his arm in the Pens series but got better as time passed. I think this makes sense because he didn't look great against the Caps at all, but was certainly much better in the Tampa series. Not to mention, he was actually pretty good in the regular season with us (eg. made great passes/setting up plays, had a fair number of assists, and two goals).   Furthermore, if I recall correctly, Coyotes are paying about 50% of his salary right now. So given all those circumstances and what you mentioned about giving up so much to bring him over, unless we get the most insane deal, I agree that there is no way he is being traded this summer."
rangers,39v2qo,keetner,3,Mon Jun 15 02:25:15 2015 UTC,He's also our cheapest. Can't even think of a realistic circumstance where it would make sense
rangers,39v2qo,Darclite,3,Mon Jun 15 03:36:21 2015 UTC,11 points in 19 games in the playoffs along with being one of our few consistently positive defensemen in CF%. Yeah better trade him.    What a bunch of fucking morons.
rangers,39v2qo,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Mon Jun 15 06:08:50 2015 UTC,For real. It's more likely they extend him than trade him.
rangers,39v2qo,DeanYoungblood10,2,Mon Jun 15 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yandle is a great player and I have no idea why people are suggesting we trade him after we traded a heavy price for him. We should use him effectively for what we gave up for him. He's hasn't been a bust, it just takes some time to adapt to a new system."
rangers,39v2qo,plastictf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:54:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I think once he goes through training camp and pre-season with the Rangers he should be up be able to produce more than he has already. While I am guilty of yelling at him through my TV during the post-season, I think it was the salt getting in my veins."
rangers,39v2qo,PlatinumPancake,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:24:41 2015 UTC,"Who the hell is saying this? We all agree that he played great in the Lightning series and very good after he was traded, and our PP need a creative playmaking D-man, and he is that guys.   Boyle on the other hand..."

rangers,39t0dn,playdohplaydate,16,Sun Jun 14 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"Talbot for 16th overall is great value. I wouldn't mind that deal, but this team is in win now mode. Yes, the 16th pick stretches the window a bit, put I'd prefer a package of Talbot/Klein for a good 2nd/3rd line winger if we can get it. The 16th pick won't make an impact for 2-3 years best case."
rangers,39t0dn,berdman11,11,Sun Jun 14 15:27:00 2015 UTC,Cam + Klein sheds a good amount of cap and if we play our cards right when resigning our guys we could get a good winger in Frolik and still have that 16th overall prospect.
rangers,39t0dn,NYRule1994,5,Sun Jun 14 15:35:17 2015 UTC,Why is everyone packaging Klein together with him? Doesn't he have a few years left on his contract?
rangers,39t0dn,Rowan94,4,Sun Jun 14 19:42:57 2015 UTC,Because the Oilers desperately need a defensemen.
rangers,39t0dn,ncolaros,2,Sun Jun 14 20:07:21 2015 UTC,It also opens a spot for Skjei
rangers,39t0dn,Sailor_Chris,0,Sun Jun 14 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Klein plays RD, Skjei plays LD...so it doesn't really open up a spot for him. Plus, he needs at least half a season in the AHL, so there's no point in trading one of our best D just to open a spot he won't fill until mid-January."
rangers,39t0dn,booshyschmoozy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that Klein is not one of our best d-men and comes with a relatively large cap hit for his skill set. If you ignore his high and unsustainable shooting percentage this year, he is pretty average. A player like Hunwick provides about 90% of his skills at a much lower cap hit.   Not saying that I would want Hunwick over Klein in a game but when you look at the cap situation, it makes more sense to go with Hunwick."
rangers,39t0dn,thisaintnogame,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. I watched 95% of games this year, so without looking at any stats I would comfortably say that he was arguably our best/most consistent defenseman this season before he got hurt, and even after he came back he was nothing but solid. IMO he's a top 4 D on at least 15 teams in this league, and he carries a cap hit under $3 mil per year for 3 more years. That's invaluable for what he gives you on the ice.   For comparison, here's a list of guys that make more than Klein - Mark Fayne ($3.625 mil), Nicklas Grossman ($3.5 mil), Rob Scuderi ($3.375 mil), Andrew Ference ($3.25 mil), Stephane Robidas ($3 mil), Deryk Engelland ($2.916 mil). For his price, he's an absolute steal."
rangers,39t0dn,booshyschmoozy,2,Tue Jun 16 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"He does, and at a sweetheart rate - 3 years left @ $2.9 mil cap hit. We would have to be utterly insane to trade that contract away IMO. The guy is a top 3-4 D at a bottom 2 price. That's invaluable to a team that has cap issues.   I will agree that his is probably the easiest contract to move, but there's no way I'd do it unless we got an amazing deal. And to me 16 for Cam + Klein is not an amazing deal."
rangers,39t0dn,booshyschmoozy,8,Mon Jun 15 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"I hope we trade Talbot for the high pick, get a really good prospect, then trade that prospect in a few years in a package for an overpaid veteran."
rangers,39t0dn,bjisba41,15,Mon Jun 15 01:35:02 2015 UTC,Let's just hope the return is good enough. And let's hope we don't have to package all too much along with him.
rangers,39t0dn,emildickson,14,Sun Jun 14 14:51:01 2015 UTC,According to the other thread it looks like the oilers want to give us their 16th over all pick. With this deep draft that's amazing. Guess we got lucky when the oilers got first overall. They don't value it as much with having the first overall
rangers,39t0dn,aceofpayne,3,Sun Jun 14 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"I read that and got excited but we would have to give up more than just Cam, so I'm still a bit nervous about it..."
rangers,39t0dn,emildickson,3,Sun Jun 14 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Probably Klein too.
rangers,39t0dn,ncolaros,5,Sun Jun 14 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"its not going to be that much.  Goalies don't fetch much, especially backups.  I know Schneider got the Nucks 9th overall but he was more proven than Cam."
rangers,39t0dn,Screwbit,4,Sun Jun 14 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"After his performance while Hank was out, I think Cam had proven he can start"
rangers,39t0dn,darkdrgon2136,7,Sun Jun 14 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"If Jeremy Roy is available with that pick, I think the trade is a great value.   Right now, he's projected to go 16th. If he (or someone of similar potential) is available, it's a huge win."
rangers,39t0dn,_TheConsumer_,6,Sun Jun 14 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"I may be a little out of the loop and this may be a dumb question, but if we trade Talbot, who is our backup to Hank at that point?"
rangers,39t0dn,AConcernedMan,8,Sun Jun 14 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on how ready we think Skapski is. Yeah, he played well in 2 games this year but he's also still only 20 (21 now?). We'd probably sign a vet goalie to backup Hank."
rangers,39t0dn,bernardrfrederic,5,Sun Jun 14 15:41:28 2015 UTC,Definitely bring in a vet...Skaps needs to play everyday to continue to develop. I doubt he'll be the backup next season.
rangers,39t0dn,mwjc001,10,Sun Jun 14 15:55:12 2015 UTC,...and he just had hip surgery and will be out for the 1st month of the season anyway.
rangers,39t0dn,high5sexwhoa,2,Sun Jun 14 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"Skapski was only called up because Hartford's top goalie Desjardins was hurt, so doubt very much he was ever going to be our backup goalie next year"
rangers,39t0dn,PeteSamp27,2,Mon Jun 15 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"http://www.spotrac.com/nhl/free-agents/goaltender/  I like signing Bryzgalov as a backup. I think Skapski will be ready in two to three years, just work with the Rangers goal tending coach."
rangers,39t0dn,CrowTR2,4,Sun Jun 14 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"I love Bryz, so much so I have a Bryzy astronaut t-shirt. He looked absolutely horrid this past season."
rangers,39t0dn,Jwpt,3,Sun Jun 14 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"Didn't Bryzzy opt to leave the NHL in the middle of his backup role with the Ducks towards the last third of the season? Iirc, he wanted to spend more time with his family and the Ducks were gracious enough to let him go but retain his contract anyway"
rangers,39t0dn,FrigidFringe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:54:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much; it's mentioned here.   I really don't think he plans on coming back, though. I think he was already kind of in retirement, but the Ducks called him up and he agreed to it. I don't see him doing it a second time, especially for a team/city he's not as familiar with. Edit: Here's another article talking about it.  One person I'd be curious about is Budaj, actually. Though I'm not really sure how the trading would work in this case (if someone could explain it to me, I'd appreciate it a lot!)"
rangers,39t0dn,keetner,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:55:52 2015 UTC,"Another person to keep an eye on is Jake Allen. Although it seems highly unlikely that the Blues would let him walk after the amazing job he did to keep them alive when Elliot was struggling, he could prove to be the biggest steal in terms of goaltenders. Plus, he's only 24/25, so being a backup with the right coach could result in seeing another Holtby-like emergence."
rangers,39t0dn,FrigidFringe,6,Mon Jun 15 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"Middle first round? The meat of this draft is in the first 8-10 picks.  Most analysis I've read sees a deep drop off from picks 2, 5, 8. Unless Rangers can get a conditional pickup ( make the trade at the moment Edmonton gets their 2nd pick) and Rangers know exactly who they want, I say wait until trade deadline."
rangers,39t0dn,wheelzr,3,Sun Jun 14 21:06:04 2015 UTC,"Teams who desperately need a goalie will either go elsewhere to find one or be sellers at the trade deadline. Starting goalie trades happen at the draft, IE the Corey Schneider trade."
rangers,39t0dn,Blitz93,3,Sun Jun 14 21:30:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not really surprised. It's probably better to have him traded around this time to make a bit of room for some of the other guys we need to re-sign. Not to mention, many teams aren't typically in search of a goalie at the trade-deadline (just seems pretty late), so I guess we'd get a lot more value for him now than later.   Still, I'll be pretty bummed when he leaves us. He played absolutely great (not just during Hank's injury, but the many other times he's filled in). I'm pretty sure this year was unexpected + kind of crazy for him, but I'm glad he did as well as he did, and that we had the opportunity to witness it all."
rangers,39t0dn,keetner,3,Sun Jun 14 19:12:12 2015 UTC,You're damn right their trading a 28 year old backup goalie with one year left on his contract if the 16th overall pick in a deep draft is on the table.
rangers,39t0dn,Blitz93,3,Sun Jun 14 21:29:56 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who's against trading Klein?
rangers,39t0dn,Serrathen,2,Sun Jun 14 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I'm not really sure why everyone has jumped on Klein being traded. But assuming a trade is made with EDM, apparently they really need defensemen, and of the guys we have, he and Hunwick are really the only ones that could be moved (eg. Boyle, G, Staal with NMC, no way we move McD, or Yandle who we just got). I guess that leaves the option of Hunwick, but my guess is that people feel like he proved himself quite well when filling in for Klein, is much more cap friendly, and Klein will be UFA next year any ways. I suppose you could look at forwards, but I think EDM is so stacked in that department, I'm not sure if that's something they're looking for (or, they would probably want some ""veteran"" presence to help the kids).   But I would agree with you. Klein had a stellar season up until his injury, and I feel like his absence + poorer play in the Playoffs made people forget that. I mean, the guy was gone for two months with a broken arm and was thrown back into Round 2 of the Playoffs...so I don't really know what else people were expecting, y'know? Plus, I always felt like Klein was/has good potential as a two-way D. I dunno. I'd love to see him stay with us, especially after sacrificing a portion of his ear for the team...ha :'(."

rangers,39t0dn,Serrathen,2,Thu Jun 18 12:38:41 2015 UTC,Nope. I love Klein. Why does everyone want him gone=[
rangers,39t0dn,Imstephalee,2,Mon Jun 15 06:10:32 2015 UTC,If we trade the pick and package it with Klein then hopefully we the cap space to keep Hags! :)
rangers,39t0dn,powwow42,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:58:25 2015 UTC,we'll re-sign him either way
rangers,39t0dn,SMIRTLE,3,Mon Jun 15 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, if this actually happens I'm sitting shiva."
rangers,39t0dn,Idontknowflycasual,4,Sun Jun 14 19:39:51 2015 UTC,If it's Talbot + Klein for the 16th pick. I'd be totally okay with that trade.
rangers,39t0dn,judge_death1,3,Sun Jun 14 15:14:37 2015 UTC,Shed a little more cap space and get a 1st round pick if the Oilers trade rumor is true? I love Klein and Talbot but this sounds like a steal for us.
rangers,39t0dn,Mats_Zuccarello,2,Sun Jun 14 15:27:28 2015 UTC,It is. I'd be thrilled if we get the 33rd overall and maybe another later pick for Talbot+Klein.
rangers,39t0dn,imnotthesmartestman,2,Sun Jun 14 15:45:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds great, but I dont think it's happening. Too good to be true."
rangers,39t0dn,Enzo95,2,Sun Jun 14 16:31:04 2015 UTC,I think this is right. I wish we could hold on to Klein but his contract is a bit too long and we need cap space.
rangers,39t0dn,plastictf,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"I love Optimus Klein, he's a great guy and a hell of a DMan but this deal seems like a win win."
rangers,39t0dn,judge_death1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:59:56 2015 UTC,would want more than that if Klein is included. He is signed for another three seasons at a very low cap hit and we could very well have two openings at D next year as Yandle may be too expensive to resign
rangers,39t0dn,PeteSamp27,2,Mon Jun 15 17:26:51 2015 UTC,It sucks because this trade has nothing to do with their play and everything to do with the salary cap. At least at this point the Rangers will be on the other end instead of sending picks away.
rangers,39t0dn,g3ckoNJ,10,Sun Jun 14 16:27:14 2015 UTC,He's a UFA next season. I don't know what you're upset about.
rangers,39t0dn,puckinright,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:29:50 2015 UTC,I'm good trading him away as long as we get another backup that can play 20+ games. Hank's not getting any younger and he needs that rest to be sharp in the playoffs.
rangers,39t0dn,gianthamguy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:34:21 2015 UTC,“no shit”   what i hate about this offseason? clickbait is a huge thing.
rangers,39t0dn,fosiacat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:43:48 2015 UTC,"Crazy ridiculously unlikely hypothetical, but what does everyone think of a possible three way trade with Edmonton and Colorado to get ROR? Talbot, Klein (and likely mcilrath/Allen/bodie) to Edmonton and probably another piece(hags so there's cap space?) to Colorado as well, the 16th overall to Colorado, and ROR to the Rangers. It's a pipe dream, but I think the value is close enough for everyone if the rumors of Edmonton being interested in talbot and Klein for 16 are true"

rangers,39zw4b,redpotatochip6,8,Tue Jun 16 03:26:56 2015 UTC,At least he was playing in another SCF...   I don't get the Boyle hate that is suddenly emerging around here.
rangers,39zw4b,emceen,4,Tue Jun 16 04:31:53 2015 UTC,Be wanted a bigger role in our line up and refused to sign without it. Yet he goes down to Tampa and has the same role
rangers,39zw4b,jedimasterchief,2,Tue Jun 16 05:38:47 2015 UTC,"Eh...I honestly think there was more to it than that. If I recall correctly, his wife is from Orlando, so I get the feeling being closer to her friends/family played a big part in him heading to Tampa. And given that Boyler is from such a big family himself, I'm sure it's something he'd understand.   But assuming that is the case, although he could have said, ""Oh, I'm moving for family reasons"", I think it would have (i) kind of thrown his wife under the bus, and (ii) if you are planning on heading to another team, wouldn't you want to ask for a larger role? Whether you expect something out of it or not, it'd definitely open up more opportunities than just saying, ""I am completely okay with what I am doing right now. Take me.""   Also, I think the fact that Cally and maybe Stralman (can't remember if he signed before or after Boyle) were familiar faces, it probably wasn't too bad of a deal for him."
rangers,39zw4b,keetner,-1,Tue Jun 16 06:42:34 2015 UTC,his wife knew what she was getting in to when she married the guy.
rangers,39zw4b,fosiacat,2,Wed Jun 17 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"After the SCF last year, AV said that he talked to Boyle and told him that he would not get a bigger role with the Rangers and that he would use him in the same way this season.   The Lightning at least gave him the opportunity to work for a bigger role so I don't think Boyle really lied about why he was leaving. He didn't end up with a bigger role in Tampa but he at least had the opportunity, and he was told he wouldn't even have that opportunity in New York."
rangers,39zw4b,emceen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, an interview I read last offseason Boyler said the Rangers didn't actually give him an offer."

rangers,39zw4b,SleepYourLifeAway,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"The hate Boyle got as a Ranger was really different than this post and the various comments about him last night though. I usually defended him, but I understand that people didn't like him as a Ranger. I don't understand taking jabs at him not winning the Cup again when the Rangers didn't make it back to the SCF..."
rangers,39zw4b,emceen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:30:10 2015 UTC,They're just trying to make themselves feel better. I thought that seeing Tampa lose the Cup would make me feel better too but it didn't. I see your point about some of these posts. I'm just trying to be happy for Richie and Carbomb.
rangers,39zw4b,SleepYourLifeAway,3,Tue Jun 16 17:00:33 2015 UTC,"This is fucking stupid. Boyle wanted a bigger role, he left where he thought he'd get one, ended up not getting it. He helped convince Hayes to sign here in spite of him already being a member of the Lightning. He has nothing but the greatest of respect for the Rangers and the fans.   This post is the exact reason why I hardly ever come into this fucking sub anymore. It's just devolved into the fucking hot takery ever since we lost."
rangers,39zw4b,invrsleep,2,Tue Jun 16 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"Like I posted above, there was an interview during last off season and one of the questions was why he didn't re-sign with the rangers. His response was they didn't even give him an offer. He liked it here but I dont think AV wanted anything more from the guy except for being a fourth line grinder/pker"

rangers,39q4kc,redpotatochip6,3,Sat Jun 13 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"He performed as an upper-tier keeper under tremendous pressure at the drop of a hat.  I could see him straight up for a 16, especially given the fact he's on for a million-five next season."
rangers,39q4kc,candidly1,3,Sun Jun 14 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"But to be fair, he's a UFA after next season, he had good numbers on a really good Rangers team, and he hasn't shown if he's ready to be a starter on a shitty team. Look what they did with Ben Scivens. Had an unbelievable run with LA, got traded and sucked."
rangers,39q4kc,Screwbit,2,Sun Jun 14 03:32:28 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but it's not like you're a lock at picking up a phenom at 16, either.  Maybe not straight up, then, but pretty close, anyhow.  I think the kid showed some real poise."
rangers,39q4kc,candidly1,2,Sun Jun 14 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"if he had more years on his deal maybe, but hes an upcoming UFA due for a raise."
rangers,39q4kc,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:13:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you could look at it as a one year, 1.5M audition, too.  If his 2-month 2015 performance wasn't a fluke, you got yourself a real keeper, cheap, and you sign him long-term.  If not, you hope that 16 doesn't turn out to be Ray Bourque..."

As of right now, the only place I can find one is under the ""custom"" jersey option on the NHL store site. Those are ~$200 and I can't imagine that price will go down when he gets traded, since they'll just take his name out of the option menu."
rangers,39q450,callmesnake13,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:25:19 2015 UTC,FullMoonJerseys will probably stock up on Talbot jerseys if he's traded. Be patient. They sell old jerseys for <$100 and they are usually pretty solid quality.

Tampa looks stronger though and doesn't matter who's in net. They're blocking shots making it hard for a team to get quality looks at the net.  I think a Ranger/Hawks stanley cup would go in 7. I think the Rangers would have beat the Ducks in 5 they were really good against the West in the regular season and the whole league except for Boston, and Tampa. But it's pointless to think what could have been."

Rangers are my number one, but in this situation go Hawks. Crawford has always been hit or miss for me, but as long as he can keep making those big saves you guys should be good."
rangers,39o9xa,Serrathen,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:14:33 2015 UTC,Crawford is CERTAINLY hit or miss.  You see games where he is just insurmountable but sometimes he plays like he did in the beginning of the first round.  Usually you can identify how he'll do for the rest of the game by paying attention to him in the first ten minutes.

While some slip ups have occurred, the levelheadedness of the team is a great thing; I am expecting Kane and Hossa to come out swinging with their sticks tonight and Toews leading the charge.

rangers,39n5y4,BadSeedling,2,Sat Jun 13 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"We tried to use Miller as the 3C earlier in the year, and it didn't work tat well. Besides, not using Hayes at Center would be a waste IMO. His patience with the puck, really good vision and playmaking skills (He led the league in Primary assists/60, in both 5-on-5 and All situations, so even with other players getting loads of PP time to inflate their stats, Hayes still put up more), and big frame makes him perfect to be a future #1 or #2 Center down the road. Thornton, Getzlaf, Kesler, all these big, playmaking centers, and Hayes had very similar attributes to all of them."
rangers,39n5y4,BrosBeforeHossa,2,Sat Jun 13 13:41:05 2015 UTC,But his face offs. That's the only reason I said miller over Hayes. You can't have a 30% win percentage

rangers,39n5y4,TrimmedXP,3,Sat Jun 13 01:01:12 2015 UTC,He difference then is that he was expected to play like a #1 center. With the emergence of Stepan and Brassard he'd be no more than a 3c barring injuries. Plus in '14 he was pretty good for us in the cup run.
rangers,39n5y4,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:20:06 2015 UTC,It was more that he was out of shape the entire season because he didn't train during the lockout. The nice thing about Richards is that he is usually big in big games.

rangers,39n5y4,fosiacat,2,Sat Jun 13 01:32:44 2015 UTC,Considering the Blueshirts' lack of depth at Center it's not the worst idea... depending on the contract.
rangers,39n5y4,MyButtisItching,5,Sat Jun 13 01:47:30 2015 UTC,Don't really have a lack of center depth anymore. We got 5 centers on the roster and Lindberg waiting

rangers,39n5y4,torax819,2,Sat Jun 13 03:54:31 2015 UTC,"i've been saying and i really think it'll happen, he signed a 1 year deal so that he can come back to the rangers for cheap!"
rangers,39n5y4,iurocky,2,Sat Jun 13 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Just cause he's playing well with the Hawks doesn't immediately mean he'll play well with us. You see how Cally, Gabby, St. Louis, Richards (when he was with us), etc. performed compared to when on other teams. Not as well. We build up our players like Step, Hags, Zucc, Kreider, Hayes and whoever else. Bringing in old players with ""leadership"" qualities won't help us. It may have worked for us 21 years ago, but the story is changed. Although he is free, give the younger guys a chance, they will be more valuable to us than Richards will be."

rangers,39n5y4,Wandering_OrLost,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:01:35 2015 UTC,I see Hayes as a center and think that Brass-Step-Hayes-Moore is a good group. We need to add some skill on the wings to the third and fourth lines. Hopefully we can keep Hags and find a Stempniak-type winger to play with him and Hayes. Tanner Glass needs to be off this roster. Call up Lindberg and have him play with Moore and Fast.

rangers,39kc7w,saxmfone1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:00:35 2015 UTC,And now we just need a vine of his playoff goals...
rangers,39kc7w,TheSensation19,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"2 seasons ago, Rick Nash continued his downward spiral of points and play. He is always and has always been a smart player. Very talented. Can do so many good things but he never had that drive. That 'eye of the tiger' feel to him. (A look I like to see in my ""best"" players but whatever)  Last season he came in looking slimmer. He even came out with some goals and helped us win games I did not think we should have. People said you look like you lost weight, you seem faster and more energetic. Do you think that this has effected your play?  He said, ""No"". He said that last year he was not getting the bounces and this year he is.   Yea... Uh Okay!  Fact: He went from doing his normal routine of working out to going outside more and doing more track and field stuff. Which I know included agility and ladders. More of it.   Nash always seemed like a medium intensity kind of guy. A guy who played off of his size and talent and did the normal stuff at the gym.   He then says he switches over to more higher intensity work outs. And he comes out skinnier, more energetic and thus you could see his play elevated.  He started crashing the net more. He was all over the place.   He had an amazing first 4 months.   Then something happened. He started going back to his old ways of playing more defensive. Stopped attacking. And later on he started to look more sluggish again.  Having experience in physical training and athletic performance. Something tells me he was not keeping up with his work outs that had gotten him to this new level.  He probably laid off of the HIIT as much. And continued back to his regular in-season training. However everyone knows that if you do not keep up the S&C stuff then your gonna become weaker over time and lose that energy.   That is why in the last 4 months he did not have that same performance. And at the end of the season he looked just as he did 2 seasons ago.   And why in the playoffs, though he played his best so far... he still ultimately did not do much for us offensively.   The biggest issue is his training. And his answer that he thinks his training did not effect his first 4 months of amazingness is proof he does not realize how much it truly does effect performance."
rangers,39kc7w,FLRangerFan,5,Fri Jun 12 13:02:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think he needs to see a sports psychologist. He has the skill and talent to be elite as we see in the regular season, but I think he's just in his own head in the playoffs. He doesn't seem to have the same drive to win as someone like Hank."
rangers,39kc7w,TheSensation19,2,Fri Jun 12 15:01:39 2015 UTC,I think he actually played well this post season. We expect him to score goals all the time. He has never really been that guy.
rangers,39kc7w,FLRangerFan,2,Fri Jun 12 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"This post season he scored goals when the game was already of out of reach. He can perform in low pressure situations, but needs to reassess his sports mentality to be able to perform under the big lights. Fleury has been able to turn around his playoff performance with the help of a sports psychologist."
rangers,39kc7w,TheSensation19,2,Fri Jun 12 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"A lot of players use them. Its why Kreider is going to one because so many people told him too. I am sure Nash has. Maybe not.   What I do know is that we have to get away from this concept that Nash has to score goals in order to be effective. I do not buy it. What we need is for our team to come out playing well. Having 3/6 defenders with broken legs is not necessarily going to have us playing our speed game. I think AV got outcoached that last series.   Nash played great by finishing checks. Creating chances. And yes, he scored goals even when we needed him too. He was amazing on the PK and he was good overall"
rangers,39kc7w,keetner,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"Nash played great by finishing checks. Creating chances. And yes, he scored goals even when we needed him too. He was amazing on the PK and he was good overall   This is really true, but I think the thing that makes everyone a bit antsy is the fact that he's being paid 7.8M to do this. There are a lot of other guys on our team doing these same things (though yes, I get at varying degrees), but being paid far, far less. I'm not really expecting him to have a goal every game or anything, but even when he had chances, they just didn't look all that great (eg. shooting from the hash marks around the boards into the goalie's glove). Though I think he started breaking out a little more near the end of the Tampa series. For example, he'd drive to the net a little more, he'd change the angle up if he shot it from the outside, create traffic in front of the net, etc.   So...yeah, I dunno. Clearly he was still able to play really well, so I'm starting to wonder if it might be more of a psychological thing. He has a pretty hefty contract and is expected to be this top winger, so when he's not producing (especially when he's needed to), I wonder how much that might affect him. It kind of reminds me of Brad Richards, actually. I feel like he's done pretty well with the Hawks because he's not expected to be this key player with an insane contract, allowing him to adjust a little more easily, y'know?  Any ways, I'm still holding out some hope for Nash. I'm just not convinced he's a Playoff ""dud"" kind of player."
rangers,39kc7w,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:38:27 2015 UTC,"I have heard the argument before. Why are we paying Rick Nash 7.8M a year to do a Tanner Glass job.  Quite frankly, its a bad argument. Nash is 7x more likely to get a scoring opportunity. He is 7x more likely to keep his defensive responsibilities. He is 7x better a player than most players you refer to that can do the ""same"" job.   I agree he is getting slightly overpaid. But at this point its not that easy to say... okay lets get rid of him.   For MSL. It is that type of scenario. For Nash. I say do what you got to do. But unless were getting a truly great return, keep Nash.   Nash can abs. do so many  things to improve himself. He can continue his new off-season work outs which have proved to do so many great things. He can now take on a new approach in the season to keep up that energy and strength. Something I think hes missing. His diet, I would be surprised to learn is optimal. He can def go  do meditation, breathing exercises... and sooo many things to be better. Everyone can.   I just think ultimately this is who Nash is. He is not a guy who can put a team on his back and win you a series. He is a depth super star. So if for any reason a trade for Malkin were to happen and we give Nash to the Pens. I could honestly see The Pens win the Cup next year lol. Why? Because Crosby, Kunitz and an array of super stars will continue to be the Pens. And nash will be what he is to Canada. A 2nd line, 3rd line, no pressure superstar who scores every other game lol"
rangers,39kc7w,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"Listen,  I am no Nash fan. I like the guy but I would have never made that trade.  I would have loved to have that ECF 2011 team we had and continue to progress with that team. The only difference is I would have traded Gabby to CBJ anyway for Brass and all."
rangers,39kc7w,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:55:40 2015 UTC,"The Pittsburgh goal yes, out of reach. Washington goal was the 3rd goal of a 4-3 win. Tampa Game 4 he scored the first goal of the game and then the 5th to give us a bigger cushion against a Tampa team that could come back. Tampa Game 6 yea he scored in a blow out.  So by my count thats 2 goals that 'don't matter', 3 goals that did.  Does anyone count garbage goals for any other players on the roster or do we just do that for Rick Nash?"
rangers,39kc7w,Darclite,2,Fri Jun 12 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"The fifth goal in a 5-1 win, scored with eight minutes left in the third, isn't a garbage goal?"
rangers,39kc7w,TBlueshirtsV22,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:01:11 2015 UTC,"I think it could go either way.  Everyone thought Dan Boyle's goal in game 6 vs Washington was a garbage goal until they came back and made it 4-3.  Tampas proven they could explode against us at any moment. There was no guarantee that at that moment they couldnt score 3 in the last 8 minutes and tie it.  It's a lot easier to look at the final score a judge what was a garbage goal. But at the time the goal actually happens, the situation is that the game isn't over at 4-1 against the leagues best scoring team.  If you want to count it as a garbage goal go ahead. Its still not like all of his goals are garbage goals.  And I ask again, why do we only keep track of Nash's garbage goals? By that logic, Brassards hat trick goal was a garbage goal. Really by your logic, Brass' 2nd and 3rd goals were garbage goals. So we should discredit his hat trick right? I'm sorry just in my opinion using that against Nash makes no sense.  We kill him when he doesn't score, we kill him when he does score."

rangers,39fly6,callmesnake13,16,Thu Jun 11 14:53:48 2015 UTC,This might be a really good thing. Imagine the talent we can get if Norway's best are only interested in the Rangers. Undrafted Norway star sneaks under the radar and he's only interested in signing with the Rangers or even a draft pick who pulls a Hayes and signs with the Rangers anyway.
rangers,39fly6,esseo2,5,Thu Jun 11 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"the problem being that Norway isn't exactly known for its hockey talent, but i see your point."
rangers,39fly6,ethixz,4,Thu Jun 11 21:11:48 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily think it's because Norway is devoid of talent like other countries; I think part of it is that NHL scouts don't really pay attention to Norway in the first place. Like Zucc was the SEL's MVP and yet he was still undrafted. Who knows which other Norwegians are passed up because scouts don't give them the respect some of them deserve?

rangers,39clme,TheSensation19,4,Wed Jun 10 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. I will counter with my thoughts on everything:   I really really hope MSL doesn't get signed. I will always love him for the great moments he gave us, but it's clear as day he's physically lost a step and we've likely seen the best of him. I'd rather watch one of the young guys come up and take his place than to keep him around. Resigning Stepan is an ABSOLUTE MUST. He took a huge step up this season scoring 55 pts in 68 games and his presence on the ice made a huge difference for us. I can 100% assure that the FO agrees and will get him paid. Hagelin is someone who I'd love to see come back, but I don't want to overpay him. I trust the FO to handle this properly, however, as I don't think he leaves NY.  JT Miller is essential for us to keep around, and I'm certain that he'll be re-signed for cheap.  I'd love to see Hunwick and Fast back for the right price. In fact I'd love for Fast to take the place of MSL if we don't re-sign him (which is what I'm expecting/want) Regarding FA, I don't think we'll be making a big splash. Maybe signing guys for depth that's about all I expect.    As for the last big elephant you mentioned...  Trades. Now, let me preface this here by saying that at the end of the day, I root for the front of the jersey, not the back. I don't mean to sound heartless here - I do love all the players on this team. And there are some who I have a bigger emotional attachment to than others.  But in the grand scheme of things, I care more about this team winning than anything else. I will hope that the FO makes the right moves to help this team win, even if it means seeing some of our beloved blueshirts leave.  That being said, I predict that Talbot will definitely be moved. SJ and Edmonton seem interested from what I've read and lets be honest here he doesn't have a future on this team. This is still Hank's team for the foreseeable future and with the contract he has, we ride or die with him. I don't think Talbot will get as big of a return as we're thinking, but he should still get us something positive in return. If he's not moved this offseason I say he's absolutely moved at the deadline for better or worse.  Also, I am predicting there will be a defenseman traded, Klein looking like the most likely option here. For people on this sub saying it's gonna be Boyle, Staal, Girardi, etc. keep in mind they have NMCs and for them to leave they would have to want off the team completely as the NMC allows them to block any move. Or they could be bought out (doubt this happens). What we would get in return for Klein if he's traded? Idk. I'm not an expert on the rest of the league or what other players around are worth off the top of my head.   As for the Malkin/Nash trade rumors... it's all speculative BS to me. Do I want him on this team? Absolutely. But unless Malkin explicitly states that he wants out of Pitt and to come here, I don't see even a 1% chance of it happening. I also don't see Nash being traded unless it's for a huge haul either.   Hope what I have said is useful/engaging. Love you guys. Can't wait for the season to start again.  LGR"

Think about this - all Sather has to say is that he entered the net in the absence Lundqvist and guess what... we won the President's Trophy. Look at his numbers in games that he has started. Over 30 games he went 21-9 with a .926 save percentage. That, plus throwing in a defenseman such as Klein would be a sweeeeet package for the team with the right pieces to give back. Edmonton."
rangers,39clme,SteamHole,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:59 2015 UTC,All for Talbot trade. Just dk if it happens now or later. This year for sure.   I think our goalie coach has proven he can turn bad goalies - good. Good goalies great. And I think Skapsi is ready. Worse case scenario we realize he needs one more year and we go after a 1 year signee. I think the team in front of the goalie is most important so idc who we get.

rangers,39clme,EarnSquirm,3,Fri Jun 12 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"My opinion of Stepan's $$$ in terms of years:  1 year = 6 million/yr  2 years = 6.25 million/yr  3 years = 6.333 million/yr  4 years = 6.5 million/yr  5-8 years = $6.6 - 7.1 million/yr  And before people say ""ZOMG Steapn isn't worth that much!"" ... Look at Jason Spezza's deal last summer. Look at Paul Stastny's deal last summer. Stepan is 24 months from unrestricted free agency and turns only 25 years old next week. Market value, like it or not."
rangers,39clme,anesqguy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:20:56 2015 UTC,I think he will shoot for 6.5 but ultimately it will come down to 5.5 Good comparisons especially with Stastny but PS was 28 when he got that deal. That is usually the big money maker year for most players.   Stepan will probably want a 3 year deal around 6. Get 3 years at 5.5 and in 3 years hope to make that same huge 7 year deal later on.
rangers,39clme,berdman11,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:54:29 2015 UTC,I think it would be tough to get him for anything under 6. Look at ROR for a comparison.

However that was 2 years ago. This year he apparently matured, played a 2 way game and improved significantly. In fact, he may not even be tradeable lol.  Soooo I would look into it.

rangers,39clme,Enzo95,2,Thu Jun 11 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"And he's only 21 years old -- still so young.

rangers,39clme,Enzo95,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:25:00 2015 UTC,The thing is that we don't actually know where his ceiling is.  Lots of highly touted prospects don't go anywhere in the NHL.  It seems dumb to me to trade our only real tradable assets for a project player with a lot of risk.

rangers,39clme,lionson76,2,Fri Jun 12 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"I understand and respect everyone's points of view, but I'm still trying to figure two things out from what I'm reading... what is everyone seeing in Hags that makes him worth north of $3 million a year AND why is everyone seemingly all of a sudden in the ship to package Klein as a trade?    Both of those baffle me.  Hags can't score more than 40 a season, can't finish on breakaways, and is one of the bottom 3 forwards on the team in shooting percentage.  He had that game winning goal against Pitt, then really nothing else these playoffs.  I love him, but why in the world it's thought he should be making $3+ million a year is beyond me.    As for Klein.... first, he's not a 3rd line Dman - he's a second line Dman.  We're paying our other 2nd line Dman (Staal) nearly 6 million a year - so why is Klein's salary that abnormal?  KK struggled after coming back from injury (which is normal), and was moved between the 2nd and 3rd lines to shake things up.  However, he's a normal 2nd liner, and produced a heck of a season for us.  There've been countless threads and articles on how awesome of a deal trading Del Zotto for Klein was, and they all mention what a good bit of economics it was in terms of financial impact/years.  But now, everyone is screaming to trade him so we don't have that cap hit?  Huh?  Did I miss something huge?  Everyone shifts so easily sometimes, it kills me.  We made that trade to improve the D, and we got that plus more offense to boot.  Why again do we want to start over there?  No idea.    Again, just my thoughts"
rangers,39clme,zmars26,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"Hagelin - Is worth 2.5-3 million in my opinion. I think he was under utilized this year. A lot of us felt he should have been on the ice more during Tampa. He was all over the place in a very good way. If Tyler Ennis who is around the same age, who only produces 40 points on the top lines in Buffalo can make 4.6.... Why cant Hagelin expect 3 million? He is a great PK. He is consistent. And 25 is still young. If you think hes worth less, I hope he does too.   I have no problem keeping him. Who would you replace him with? He had 5 points in the playoffs... Not amazing but what I expect from his role. Almost as good as MSL. lol  I just dont see him being easily replaced either. If he wants more than 3, he can go. He probably will make more money for a team like Buffalo or Detroit and do much better on a bigger role anyway.   Klein is not really a 2nd pair guy for us. He is a 2nd pairing but when were all healthy he could very well be placed on the #5 spot lol. Do you really want to pay him 3 million? I say its close but no cigar. I rather get rid of Boyle but its not gonna happen. I think we can replace Klein a lot easier than replacing Hagelin."
rangers,39clme,PeteSamp27,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Couple counter thoughts:    ""He had 5 points in the playoffs... Not amazing but what I expect from his role. Almost as good as MSL""    That's kind of a problem then, if he's not producing more than MSL, who was criticized daily for his struggles.  I have no idea why Tyler Ennis makes so much, and since we're talking about a potential raise for a current player, and not a new one, I only want to base my opinions off what he's done in the last season or two.  Which frankly, isn't worthy of $3million+, in my opinion.  He's wildly inconsistent at times, and for all his speed and ability he can't finish on breakaways or shoot with a decent percentage.  Yes he's excellent on the PK and flys all over the ice, but we need him to use his speed and stick handling abilities to score, which he isn't at a rate we expected him to in the past few years.  I love the guy, and he fits in perfectly for us, I just think he's right where he needs to be at about 2.25-2.5 million.    As for Klein, why do you say he's not a second pair for us, out of curiosity?  We're paying him $2.9 million, and he produces a career year, finishing in the top 15 in +/- and putting up only a few points less than Mac, who makes almost twice as much.  And we've locked him in at that rate for years.  He's consistent, loves the team and is a fan favorite.  He also happens to be a damn good right handed defender (which we desperately needed at the time we signed him), and has blossomed into a solid offensive threat as well.  If we trade him, we're starting back at square one with needing a right handed defender who can score.  Remember ... Mac, Staalsy, Yandle, and Hunwick are all left handed.  And G doesn't score very often.  So our sole right handed threat would then become Boyle, who you want to get rid of..."
rangers,39clme,zmars26,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:28:03 2015 UTC,"Its not a problem. Understand the worth here...  MSL got 50 points playing on the 1st & 2nd line. Rarely on 3rd line. He played on the PP #1 unit which I feel got 80% of the time on the PP if not more.   What did Hagelin get? Mostly a 3rd line guy. SOMETIMES on 2nd. No PP. Some PK.   MSL was a 50 point player.  Hagelin was a 40 point player.   Playoffs. Similar scenarios. Same thing. 6 pointish.   3 million is what I expect to give a young (25 is young) looking for a 3-5 year deal, who gets about 40 points playing on the 3rd line.   He is the fastest player in the league. His work ethic is there. So I have no issues getting him. Speed kills. It works well in our system. I rather keep Hagelins speed and experience in our system and roster than go after a new guy. I do not see many guys who can fill his role.   I do not expect him to do much more especially with the time given. He is a PK... which is harder to come by than most of you think. If we can get him for 2.5 then sure... But guarantee a team like Detroit swoops him and gets him for 3 and he goes onto being last year's Stralman and everyone says we shoulda kept him."
rangers,39clme,adamrobertt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:37:18 2015 UTC,McD and Girardi on #1 Staal as #2  That 2nd pairing is pretty much anyone from Yandle to Boyle to yes Klein. But not all 3.   So depends on chemistry but Klein was mostly  on our 3rd pairing. which is great. At 2.9 hes fine but if we can use him in a trade then why not. I think we can replace the guy a lot easier.

I'm still a kid, if I work hard, and the gig as well next season, maybe the chance will come in a year. I certainly was not upset.  Additionally, you are dealing with yet another dilemma. New York Rangers will offer two-way contract. What about your future?  They are pleasant affairs. They extended period watching me, I've been there twice at the camp. We'll see how everything goes. A few days ago ended in a playoff, in a few days everything should be resolved. If staying in Pilsen, whether or interest Rangers take on.  If the offer will be valid, you decided to leave?  Furt me wallows in mind, it's a tough decision. In Pilsen is a super team, I've got a great environment, I get a lot of space on the ice. But the NHL will probably refuse. Yet even now I do not want to say either yes or not.  Either way, you toil in Sumava not escape. How do you handle that?  Every day is so hard. We're working one hundred percent and we hope that the season will see. Maybe Wednesday we had a long stage around sixty kilometers. We went a little over two hours. We have reached the bottom.

He had sparks but it couldn't translate to the newer NHL of Speed really.  Let's say that Klein & McIlrath are thrown together in a trade together... It would have to be for strictly another defensemen (preferably a right handed defensemen) since you have McD, Staal, Yandle, Hunwick, shooting Left (In Hartford, Skjei, Bodie, Allen & Summers shoot left as well)."
rangers,393mc0,jh1336,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:44:31 2015 UTC,McIlrath also just turned 23. That makes next year his age 23 season. Klein didn't spend real time in the NHL until his age 24 season. Girardi's first full year was his age 23 season. Boyle's first full year was his age 24 season. It's unfair to call Mcilrath a bust already.
rangers,393mc0,AoifeCheeks,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, which is why I referred to McIlrath as an experiment; so to speak. His game needs to translate (if that means working on skating technique and mental re-hauling so be it) & hopefully it does so he can bring his height and his physical play to main roster. I like him and hope he can stay within this organization.   If he cannot bring his level up to where it needs to be; packaging him in a deal wouldn't be too bad."

rangers,393mc0,callmesnake13,7,Tue Jun 9 13:07:12 2015 UTC,I really think the Rangers should try to move Yandle.    Why? He was pretty clutch in the postseason
rangers,393mc0,TheSensation19,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:24:36 2015 UTC,4.5 million for 1 year.  We have a few younger D-men who can try for that #4 spot. We are looking into that 22 year old Czech kid. Looks promising.   And there are plenty of free agents at the 2-2.5 million range. Using the remainder to sign a replacement for MSL  Oduya Weaver  We have to move somebody on our team. I think.
rangers,393mc0,berdman11,6,Tue Jun 9 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"We're only paying Yandle 2.6 mil - Arizona is paying half. That's a bargain for a guy like Yandle, no reason to trade him."

rangers,393mc0,callmesnake13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"That's a good argument, but the 22 year old Czech kid isn't going to be anywhere near ready. If we can get MSL for an absurd discount and keep him as a third liner I'm fine with that.   I'll probably catch hell for this, but if there is anyone that I think should be moved, based both on their value to other teams, as well as their contract situation, it's Hagelin. He's fast, I like him, but his shot is god awful and hasn't improved over the last couple years."
rangers,393mc0,TheSensation19,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:54:09 2015 UTC,"Your statement to keep MSL if we can get him at absurd discount is another thing I HATE.   Sorry bud but I do not want him on the team. Sure, he can give us what... another 35-45 point season. Nice. Wow Woooo eeeeee. I even am among the few who think MSL played fine during the playoffs but why keep him?  I rather go for some one younger. Who is 100% of the free agents out there. And there are plenty who are cheaper than MSL was, and can still get you 40-50 points guaranteed.   I am fine with Hagelin being kept. Depends on how much he wants. He is a guy I thought should have been played more during the Tampa series but for some reason did not.   There is a rumor on a trade to move Nash and maybe land Malkin. I think the only way I allow Hags to go nicely is if he HAS to be in this deal."
rangers,393mc0,Theige,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'd rather get MSL back on the cheap than resign Hagelin, who I think will command more money.  Hagelin shows flashes but I think MSL is still the better player, and if he's cheaper.... really a no brainer to me"
rangers,393mc0,TheSensation19,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"MSL is a better player. However, it is not what we need. MSL plays far too much to the outside. Hagelin has no problem crashing the net. And in the playoffs what does ""better"" mean if in the end they both barely produce?   Plus think of the future. Hagelin is 20 years younger lol. He will develop into an even better player in 3 years, let alone 6 when he is in his hockey prime.   Its not all about points. I believe Hagelin was under utilized against Tampa Bay. And a lot of people will agree with me that Hags speed was not used enough in that series. He should have been double shifted at times, because Hags was one of the few who was going at it and causing havoc.   I will say it over and over again.  MSL is too comfortable right now. He is near retirement, he came here to be closer to family. He is not the guy he use to be, which was always a work horse. He is still an experienced player with so much skill and use. But I rather have someone who can play on the 'inside'   Watch MSL. Its all on the outside with him. Roaming the perimeter of the offensive zone. Comes in sometimes for a one timer but often gets nothing. Hes small and only getting slower.   idc if he wants minimum salary. I rather go after a guy like Joel Ward. Whose 6 years younger... Tougher and stronger. We need more size. I would love the guy."
rangers,393mc0,Theige,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"If Hagelin crashes the net it's VERY rare. His trademark move is to blaze down the ice... and take a slap shot from 25 - 30 feet out.   I've never seen him take the puck to the net hard. He gets into the slot sometimes from the corner, and that's good. I wish he'd do that more"
rangers,393mc0,phnxldr,3,Thu Jun 11 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think Klein would be better to trade for the rangers. Not because he's bad, but he has a higher cap hit than yandle  and we need the money to bolster our forwards. I think having him on the third pairing is a luxury we can't afford anymore."

rangers,394u9n,ptvnsux94,5,Tue Jun 9 11:13:48 2015 UTC,Talbot isn't a goaltender you trade for rentals. I'm hoping Sather packages Talbot with someone else so we can get the star player/difference maker we need. I'm thinking a true top line center.
rangers,394u9n,SteamHole,5,Tue Jun 9 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone expects to get an amazing haul for Talbot. He's great, don't get me wrong but playing well for a month doesn't warrant a top line center. I also don't want him to be traded for nothing though."
rangers,394u9n,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"Ok he isn't someone we trade for rentals, and he doesn't score us Malkin either. But he's certainly proven that he can start."
rangers,394u9n,callmesnake13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:18 2015 UTC,Oh no doubt. I just think a lot of people are over valuing him.
rangers,394u9n,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you look at the history of goalie trades you can see players who are equally as proven (Schneider being the best example) typically netting a first round pick, or a 2nd or third liner at best. All the teams that are needing goalies right now have more to offer than those with goalies to spare."
rangers,394u9n,callmesnake13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"Talbot is a massive part of the reason we were able to pull off the President's Trophy in the absence of Lundqvist... That being said, he would have to be packaged with some other pieces for what we really really need. Edmonton is perfect because they have all of this talent that they can't seem to develop and they certainly won't be able to sign all of their phenomenal picks (Hall, Nugent-Hopkins, Yakupov, and now McDavid...), so it makes sense to give them what they need. I think they need a Talbot, a Klein (or Girardi), and possibly a  winger with experience in order to pry one of those top players from them.  I hope we can get Nugent-Hopkins, he's signed for the next 7 years at $6 mil per."
rangers,394u9n,SteamHole,3,Tue Jun 9 16:28:14 2015 UTC,There's no way in hell that we'd get RNH. The only one I could see the Rangers getting is Yakupov. Hall amd RNH won't be moved. They're both extremely young and the faces of the franchise
rangers,394u9n,Sailor_Chris,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"Yakupov would also be a good replacement for Marty. We really need a center who can win faceoffs, but I don't think it 's a priority. Step, Brass, Hayes/Miller and Moore are likely our centers next season, just like this season."
rangers,394u9n,mantiseye,6,Tue Jun 9 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know who the fruitcake is that wrote this piece, but I can tell you right now, the flames are not interested in another goalie. We've got Hiller for one more year at 4.5m, Ortio coming up on a one way this year and Ramo made a strong case for a new contract.  In the post season presser, Treliving seemed to indicate that he wants to keep Ramo but repeated ""We will not carry three goalies"".  Ortio is a given, he's the future of this franchise, so my money is on us actively shopping Hiller. If we find a taker, we resign Ramo and he and Jorts split the duties. If not, Ramo walks and Hiller and Jorts split the duties.  What's more, Hudler is a third of one of the most dominant lines in the league, an integral part of our mentor system, and one of only two official right wingers on our team. he is as unlikely to get moved as you guys are to move Lundqvist.   Russell more likely but still, no way. He got handed an A when Gio went down - he's from Alberta and grew up a flames fan and it shows in the way he plays, we don't move him unless we get someone better to take his spot, but were already committed to improving the bottom pairing and we have exactly ONE defense prospect that could move up this year. Why would we break up a D-core that proved to be solid right through the season to try something else?  So no, Hoodles doesn't move, Russell doesn't move and we don't want a goalie.  Next?"
rangers,394u9n,Nine-Foot-Banana,3,Tue Jun 9 07:26:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, if the guy does this...I feel like it might be hard to argue him being moved, heh."

rangers,394u9n,keetner,2,Tue Jun 9 16:29:18 2015 UTC,No.
rangers,394u9n,ANGR1ST,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:26:24 2015 UTC,"It really seems as if most people here are either overly optimistic or completely delusional. No people, Talbot as a centerpiece of a deal won't net us RNH, Taylor Hall, the first overall pick or Malkin. Throwing in Klein or McIlrath won't get us any closer either. It's currently a buyers market for goalies like Talbot (Ramo, possibly Gibson), so being honest the best we can hope for from Talbot is probably a 2nd round pick or a decent 3rd line player."
rangers,394u9n,Itscominrightforus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"Calgary fan here: lots of issues with this proposal. Let's go through them.   We don't really need a back-up. Ortio's been a promising prospect for us, and he needs to go through waivers to put him in the AHL. If he's not the back-up, it's because we traded him (or, if we somehow injure our starter leaving training camp or something). He's got enough potential that putting him on the waiver wire would likely get him picked up.  So, a trade like this would have to include Talbot for Ortio, which is kind of a sideways move right now for Calgary. Calgary's weakest position on the depth chart, by far, is RW. We've got Hudler (who's playing his off-side, I should note), then David Jones, then two right-shot centres (both of whom have played less than 60 NHL games). After that, it's AHL prospects in varying states of readiness.  Moving Hudler as a 70 point scorer is a pretty big roster move already, especially since he's proven to be a very useful veteran presence on a roster that basically doesn't have one (Bollig doesn't count, despite his cup ring). Moving Hudler as our only true top-6 right winger and leaving us with three holes in our top-6 would need to net a pretty big pay-out. We're getting back Tanner Glass? Our bottom 6 forwards are already crazy crowded -- like, we literally have so many that we could run an extra 3rd line every night if we had the space, and still have guys to healthy scratch. We don't need another one, especially not in exchange for Hudler. If he's just another number in the cap dump in this trade, then we need more than just Lindberg and McIllrath as asset gains. Talking about Lindberg and McIllrath, Calgary really doesn't need another left-handed centre who's projecting to around the 3rd line and although McIllrath is basically Burke's ideal player, if he's not projecting to top-4 defense I doubt Treliving would go for him either. The assets we're getting aren't valuable enough to Calgary for us to sell Hudler after a career year.     For those reasons, I think the return for Calgary would have to be very different if you want these players. From the perspective of our team, if we want to stay competitive, we'd need to take back a defenseman -- we're already looking at improving the second pairing. If you guys are so desperate to move cap that you're trying to dump Glass, we'd probably be looking at Staal instead of Klein. Obviously losing Staal would hurt, but you're trying to get a guy who was 8th in scoring last season and who scored more points down the stretch than any other player in the NHL, with 50% salary retained. Getting him is going to require making a tough decision, not spare parts and a great goaltender prospect.  From the Rangers perspective:   Russell isn't an upgrade on Girardi. He's not a bad player by any means, but he's not going to be pushing anyone down to the second pairing -- right now the consensus on the Flames sub is that we should be looking for someone to push him or Wideman into the third pairing. Out of defensemen playing more than 1100 minutes, Russell and Wideman gave up more high quality scoring chances than any defenseman in the NHL last season expect Phaneuf, Rielly, and Ristolainen. Notice who those other guys play for. Any trade that looks like this would have to include at least one promising prospect coming back, who's expected to be a real goal scorer in two or three years -- do the Rangers really have any more farm to sell?"
rangers,394u9n,Roughly6Owls,0,Fri Jun 12 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"As much as I'll get downvoted for this, I'd rather deal Hank.  His cap hit is too big, and when you look at a team like Chicago you realize that you don't need ""elite"" goaltending to win a cup. We need to re-sign a bunch of players that need raises, and we really need a little more scoring depth. Dealing Hank for the right return gets us that. Maybe he wins a cup playing somewhere else, but so will we."
rangers,394u9n,ANGR1ST,3,Tue Jun 9 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"If Hank ever decided he wanted to leave for a Cup contender, I certainly would not hold it against him. But I feel like if you did trade him at this point in time, it would be such a huge mental/emotional blow to the club that...yeah. Unless it's absolutely mutual, I don't think it would be a good idea for either party.  Not to mention, I'm kind of curious to know who would be willing to pick up Hank + his contract. I don't think it would be Playoff/Cup contender at this point, simply because (i) many of those teams already have a goalie/goalies they would not be willing to give up, (ii) they likely won't give what we need (eg. forwards you mentioned), and/or (iii) cap issues."
rangers,394u9n,keetner,0,Tue Jun 9 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"The contract is an albatross. It makes him hard to deal (has a NTC too I think), and it hurts us in cap space.  The best prospect on that front is still Edmonton. I don't think McDavid is on the table, and I don't think a new draftee is what we need either. Not sure just dropping Hank on that team with their current roster makes them a contender, and it would be worse with whatever they gave up to get him.  Rather deal Hank than Nash."

Sure Nash didn't score a ton of points in the playoffs because teams could assign their best d-pairing or defensive forward assigned to him. With absolutely no other consistent offensive threats out there he's going to be completely ineffective. Sure, other guys showed flashes but then disappeared.   I hate this idea because this team came so close as it is and could get pushed over the top if some of these young guys just develop. Again, I'll quote it. Aside from Nash, the top 9 forwards on this team are younger than 29. Aside from Brass and Zucc the rest are younger than 25.   If any one of those guys, Hayes, Stepan, Kreider, Fast, or Miller becomes a consistent offensive threat in the playoffs this team can win the Cup, and not only this year, but possibly a few years in a row.  The last thing they want to do is trade with St. Louis, who every season seems to finish the season looking like cup contenders then losing in the first round."

You would need another star coming back - which makes the trade a wash.   Plus, the new players coming to NY would have zero chemistry with the team.

rangers,38x3wx,tj_sad_boi_666,5,Sun Jun 7 17:43:31 2015 UTC,Boyle was matched up against Malkin's line in the Pittsburgh series and Stamkos' line in the Tampa series soooo
rangers,38x3wx,HeadForTheSHallows,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"No, they're facing 3rd lines and checking lines. Different roles, not ""worse"" lines. Just because bottom 6 guys don't put up sexy numbers doesn't mean they're worse. Now consider the fact that a team's bottom 6 is supposed to suppress oppositional scoring and Boyle and Yandle are STILL driving possession, SAT and corsi and it's glaringly obvious that they both did exactly what they were supposed to be doing."
rangers,38x3wx,F_urOpinion,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:38:21 2015 UTC,They're facing the checking and shutdown lines of each team and still making them look silly.
rangers,38x3wx,pugwalker,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yandle and Boyle both used to play against the best lines of the west. Yandle was on PHX's top pair for years, Boyle was on SJ's top pair for years. Oh, and they both dominated whilst doing so."
rangers,38x3wx,F_urOpinion,-1,Mon Jun 8 20:25:41 2015 UTC,Boyle is old and the rangers are much better than PHX.  Yandle was never dominant defensively.
rangers,38x3wx,Rural_Juror,0,Mon Jun 8 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, Boyle is old. Yet he can still play well and produce. Who cares if the Rangers are better than Phoenix? They had a good 4 year stretch, doesn't matter if they were good or not, Yandle was their top D man and he dominated.   Your definition of dominate defensively likely is incorrect."
rangers,38x3wx,TBlueshirtsV22,3,Mon Jun 8 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"i think that's close to what he meant, yeah.   The reality is, the team needs both types of players. i'm certainly not a huge girardi fan. I think he makes terrible decisions with the puck that are more harmful than not.. but he's an important part of this team and a critical component of our defensive ecosystem (arguably our team's, as well). unfortunately he's being paid slightly more than what he'll provide in a vacuum, but that's what it took to retain him.  Also, i think a lot of people will be pleasantly surprised by yandle next season (once the sting and promised-hype of 'putting us over the top for a cup' wears off). He's going to be a big part of this team's success."
rangers,38x3wx,mantiseye,4,Sun Jun 7 16:37:25 2015 UTC,"The hype with Yandle is such an accurate comment. After we traded for him all anyone reported was that it made us Cup favorites and we basically were delcared Conference Champions that day. It made the perception that we were getting Bobby Orr. Keith Yandle was a very good player, but I do think the media overvalued the move. It's not like we made move for Ovi or Crosby."
rangers,38x3wx,TwinkiesForAmerica,2,Sun Jun 7 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"He also came onto a team with a power play that looked completely lost a lot of the time. One guy, even if the power play is his strength, wasn't going to fix that."
rangers,38x3wx,Darclite,5,Sun Jun 7 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yandle was really good in the TB series. So was Boyle. Both of them came up big. Girardi didn't have his best series but maybe that was because of his pretty serious injury.   To me, all of this goes to prove the logic behind the balancing of defensemen. You need one guy who is more of a puck mover and another who is more defensive. You see that all around the league whether it be Keith/Seabrook or Boyle/Staal. Those are the only two examples I can think of right now but there are definitely more."
rangers,38x3wx,F_urOpinion,2,Sun Jun 7 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"You know, I like looking at stuff on war-on-ice and hockeyanalysis as if I'm going to be the one making the decisions too, but it's kinda weird how people treat Corsi like the be-all, end-all of statistics when its R-Squared value is pretty awful. It speaks volumes about how much advanced stats are set to develop when this is the best we have right now.  Here's an example. These are two teams, one is made entirely of top 100 forwards and top 100 defensemen in terms of Corsi. The other is made of guys in the bottom 100 of each of those groups.  Team 1:  Thomas Perrault Ritchie   Burakovsky Schroeder Paajarvi   Puempl Kennedy Bennett  Lowry Bergenheim Connolly  Postma Kindl  Rozsival Visnovsky  Colaiacovo Manson  Team 2:  VanRiemsdyk Monahan Iginla  Moulson Duchene Cammalleri  Stajan Girgensons Stafford  Tanguay Horvat Stewart  McDonagh Giordano  J.Johnson E.Johnson  Seidenberg Greene  Which would you take? If you want to have a team with astoundingly good Corsi, that first one will give it to you. But I'd enjoy watching the other one stomp them. Now sure, you could do the same thing the other way around, but this does pretty much demonstrate that plenty of elite players may not be the best possession drivers, and plenty of possession drivers may not be elite players. Half of those ""great"" players can't even hold on to a spot on a starting roster, and half of those ""shit"" players are guys any team would take in a second.  I've seen so many posts that basically add up to ""X is better than Y because X has better Corsi"" without consideration of situational ice time, matchups, systems, special teams, zone starts, and a bunch of other very relevant pieces of data. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely worth looking at. If you're searching for a problem with consistency, like Toronto, then it offers a pretty good explanation. Another example is the constant complaining about Boyle, where there wasn't really a single statistic to hold against him and it was clearly mostly just bias. But when most people across all fandoms consider us to have a top five defense, we're godlike at holding leads, we have a tremendous penalty kill, we just won the President's Trophy, we just made it to game 7 of the ECF, and we've seen several consecutive successful years, a complete overhaul of our defense might not be the best idea just because the Corsi told us it was."
rangers,38x3wx,defiantgrit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"It isn't the end all be all. Trouble is, even going on the eye test Girardi has been awful.  Constant snow angeling, constantly getting beat to both the outside and inside, zero offensive presence or puck moving ability. More often then not we'd get pinned in our own zone because of his inability to clear the puck or beat someone to a loose one.   So no, Corsi isn't the end all be all, there are many more stats then that saying he simply isn't a good dman anymore, and isn't worth that albatross contract."
rangers,38x3wx,defiantgrit,0,Sun Jun 7 18:38:00 2015 UTC,"It's not the end all be all, but it's a good tool. There are many other tools than Corsi, there's Fenwick, there's SCF/SCA, QoT, QoC, shot charts, zone entries/breakouts, WOWY charts, there are so many tools it's not even funny. It's not all Corsi, there are so many tools to look at different perspectives of the game."
rangers,38x3wx,MungTongue,2,Mon Jun 8 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's ""buttmad"" (the proper internet term is butthurt, btw) because we're doing what is so stereotypical for NY fans its disgusting. You know the reason why the Mets, Jets, Knicks and Rangers have such awful recent success? A complete inherent lack of patience and these stupid threads when the team loses that force managements hand.  This was the best team during the regular season who lost in a heartbreaking game 7 and was wrought with injuries. The line up doesn't need to be re-tooled.  I'll ask what I ask in every thread.  Say you don't re-sign MSL. Say you trade Girardi. After re-signing Fast, Miller, Hagelin and Stepan you probably have about 4 million of Girardi's salary left to work with.  Who do you sign for 4 million that scores 2 goals in that game 7 or puts up a huge playoff performance and brings home the Cup?"
rangers,38x3wx,defiantgrit,4,Sun Jun 7 19:10:36 2015 UTC,If we re-sign MSL we should all probably jump off the Empire State building
rangers,38x3wx,defiantgrit,-1,Sun Jun 7 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, but again, this is my question.   MSL is most likely retiring to save face because the Rangers aren't going to re-sign him anyways.  Now Fast, Miller, Hagelin and Stepan need to be re-signed as RFAs.   Now say we trade Girardi before we re-sign any of those guys. After re-signing all those guys you have at max 5 per season to work with from not re-signing Girardi. You've got to bring up a two way player like Hunwick or Skjei so now you're down to 4.4.   Who do you sign for 4.4 million that puts this team over the top? Who do you sign for 4.4 million that scores two goals in a game 7 when McD, Staal, and Girardi are injured in very important places to play effectively?  Trading one of the two with the cap woes this team is in now doesn't solve a damn thing. Please also remember that you're trading one of the three defensemen that were responsible for one of last season's best goal differentials and the President Trophy winning team.   Talk all the corsi stats you want. But your idea takes away a key part of the defense of a team with the best goal differential and does not allow any room to sign anyone who would put up a great playoff performance and bring home a cup.   Once more, being a stereotypical NY fan that wants a huge shake up and change when the team just happened to lose in a game 7 while 3 of their best defensemen were hampered with injuries, and one of their best offensive players was suffering from a traumatic brain injury so he couldn't play."
rangers,38x3wx,defiantgrit,2,Sun Jun 7 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"Why do you keep bringing up our RFAS? I fail to see the point your making.  In an ideal world, MSL retires, Girardi is traded and we free up 10M on the cap in one swoop. This is gravy because I don't believe we'd have an issue with our RFAS anyway.   You also give Oscar Lindberg a shot at the NHL roster.  Asking for one of our two worst defenseman to be gone to make room for someone who is either young and eager to prove himself (Skjei) or someone who is an affordable two way dman who has proven he can handle significant minutes (Hunwick) is not a shakeup in any way shape or form."
rangers,38x3wx,F_urOpinion,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"G is not gonna be traded, NMC"
rangers,38x3wx,kthoag,-1,Sun Jun 7 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"Because you have to sign those RFAs or they become UFAs. Do you want to just let Stepan, Miller, Hagelin and Fast go?   You don't free up 10 m. Stepan needs to be re-signed because he's an RFA. He's going to get an upgrade from what he makes now. That takes away some of this 10 million you're talking about. Fast and Miller are going to ask for upgrades. So will Hagelin. Its the nature of Restricted Free Agency. It's not 10 million that's freed up even if you trade Girardi.  You're still not answering the question. Who do they sign with this freed 10 million that wins that game 7 for them?"
rangers,38x3wx,F_urOpinion,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"These hypotheticals you're presenting are not helping your point.  Girardi doesn't add anything to a team who needs a goal in a game 7 either. He's quickly becoming a pylon.  You also don't seem to grasp that the only RFA who's getting a raise is Stepan. Miller and Fast will both make under 1.3m a season.   MSLs money will go to Stepan, maybe +500k"

When we go to games, I give her my Lindros jersey to wear. Finally, after 5+ years of going to games, she turned to me and said,   GF: ""Why am I the only one with a Lindros jersey?""  Me: ""He played a long time ago.""  GF: ""So did Richter. I see his jersey everywhere. You gave me some has-been jersey.""  Me: ""Actually, he was really good in Philadelphia.""

rangers,390yl3,keetner,4,Mon Jun 8 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"I think last year we did it by player numbers too, right? (Like a photo of McDonagh when there were 27 days left, etc.) I liked that and I think by using player numbers it doesn't start so soon..."
rangers,390yl3,emceen,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:35:26 2015 UTC,A countdown is fine. But let's wait for the actual season to end and once we actually hit a Rangers player let's start. Although I guess this year it'll be starting earlier than expecting wit Yandle and 93

rangers,38uexn,Searingm1,-11,Sat Jun 6 23:12:12 2015 UTC,HE CANT PLAY DEFENSE
rangers,38uexn,this_guy_says,5,Sun Jun 7 04:08:01 2015 UTC,It because he plays little defense because he's usually making plays to get out of the Rangers' zone.
rangers,38uexn,F_urOpinion,-2,Sun Jun 7 14:47:41 2015 UTC,Gave up possession way too many times in our zone though (but then again so did many of our players).

rangers,38uexn,irishguy42,-4,Sun Jun 7 17:06:30 2015 UTC,yeah you are right. He is a Defenceman that cannot play defense.
rangers,38uexn,ncolaros,4,Sun Jun 7 17:16:02 2015 UTC,He can play the kind of defense that he can immediately make cross ice plays or generate offensive pressure from. Not a shutdown type defense like Staal or Girardi do. He purposely makes defensive plays that creates opportunities for our team to make a rush or effectively get into the offensive zone.  JFC not every defensemen plays to just block shots or poke check the puck away or check someone and then not do anything with it.

rangers,38ukq1,fosiacat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this the other day. SJ has better options for a trade than Edmonton. Edmonton either has #1 or high end 1st round picks, or bottom of the barrel guys in their system. You know you're not getting any of the former #1/2/3 picks for Talbot.   SJ has a few solid prospects that we could really use. In particular, Center Dan O'Regan (5th round pick.) Hockey's Future labelled his game play and skills ""electric.""  Would SJ trade a blue-chip prospect for Talbot? I'd say yes - because they would view it as a trade of hidden gems. They're trading a 5th round guy that blossomed, we're trading an undrafted goalie that blossomed into a starter."
rangers,38ukq1,fosiacat,4,Mon Jun 8 18:06:22 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if we get any player instead of just picks for Talbot. Maybe Yak?
rangers,38ukq1,onebandonesound,2,Sun Jun 7 00:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yaks a possibility, but we would need more then just Talbot. But Yaks kind of a wild card right now. He improved by leaps and bounds under Nelson, and we still have yet to see him under McLellan. He won't be in play at least for a little while, so I don't think this deal happens."
rangers,38ukq1,JackTheGordie,13,Sun Jun 7 00:33:47 2015 UTC,I don’t think you’re really in the position to be saying “you need to give us more” - you’re the one that needs a goalie. forwards are a dime a dozen.
rangers,38ukq1,EarnSquirm,-5,Sun Jun 7 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"Thats not how the NHL works though. We may need a goalie, but your guys' window at a cup is getting smaller every year, so you might be in a tougher position than us. Trading Talbot + picks could be what gets you guys over the top, seeing as Talbot isn't doing anything in the playoffs when Hank is clearly your guy."
rangers,38ukq1,d2t0z,3,Sun Jun 7 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"we need (as far as i’m concerned) to dump some old legs (boyle and msl) and pick up a potent scorer, but even that isn’t really that necessary... I think kreider is going to have a solid year, stepan will get moving as well. we really had everything we needed this year, except for top 4 people had injuries they were trying to play through. my point is, we don’t NEED to get anyone from YOU - there are other teams interested. give something valuable, or continue playing oilers top-heavy hockey.... 4 lines of top draft picks and zero defense and goaltending. you’re much more desperate than we are."
rangers,38ukq1,d2t0z,3,Sun Jun 7 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"Cam and one of our defensive prospects not named Brady skjei for yakupov? We could maybe throw in a lowish pick as well  Last I heard was the oilers needed young d with potential, and the rangers need a scoring winger, I think that could work out for everyone"
rangers,38ukq1,redpotatochip6,3,Sun Jun 7 13:35:30 2015 UTC,Talbot on his own should fetch a high 2nd Round Pick. Talbot+KK should fetch a mid-low 1st Round pick.
rangers,38ukq1,kthoag,2,Mon Jun 8 00:31:10 2015 UTC,I think that's a good estimate on trade value.
rangers,38ukq1,kthoag,2,Mon Jun 8 20:43:22 2015 UTC,The 1st Rounder that you guys got from Pitt for Perron. Maybe your own 2nd rounder.
rangers,38ukq1,kthoag,2,Sun Jun 7 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"That first rounder is a big ? for us right now. I'm not sure what our management is going to do with it as of right now. I think right now they're leaning toward using it instead of trading it away, but I have absolutely no way to confirm that. All I know is the interview process at the combine went really well, and they may have found someone they like at that #16 spot. I wouldn't be against trading it away, but adding a 2nd rounder on top of it is too much I think. Maybe a conditional pick, or something in a later round. but 1 and 2 seems like a lot from our side, considering how deep this draft is looking."
rangers,38ukq1,this_guy_says,2,Sun Jun 7 01:18:05 2015 UTC,Don't need both. What I meant to say is the Pitt 1 gets its done. Edm 2 might get it done. Talbot is going to go for the highest draft pick
rangers,38ukq1,onebandonesound,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok, I understand. Pretty interesting then."
rangers,38ukq1,redpotatochip6,2,Sun Jun 7 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"What about Talbot, Klein, McIlrath, and a 5th for Draisaitl? I'm thinking it's not enough but please, I want to to see what you would want for Draisaitl. Realistically, of course."
rangers,38ukq1,rfhwbass,3,Sun Jun 7 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"As I said, I don't think the Oilers even consider moving Drai right now, unless the deal is outrageous. He's coming off of a very strong WHL campaign and Memorial cup. Klein is good, but he isn't good enough to consider moving a guy like Draisaitl who has a very high ceiling.  What would I want for Drai? I'm not sure. I'm not that educated about the players on your team. Would someone like Kreider ever be in play? I honestly have no idea, so I cant really give an educated answer."
rangers,38ukq1,haamm,3,Sun Jun 7 00:14:49 2015 UTC,"Kreider would not be in play. To me Klein+Talbot+picks is a good return, but without knowing your teams needs it is tough to say."
rangers,38ukq1,EarnSquirm,2,Sun Jun 7 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"Again, I just don't think we're moving Draisaitl, at least not in the near future. Maybe 3-4 or maybe even 5 years from now, but only getting Klein on top of Talbot + picks would be highway robbery by you guys. He's still only 19, and his ceiling and potential is very high, which is why I think the trade isn't good for us at all."
rangers,38ukq1,MwehttaM,2,Sun Jun 7 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"That is fair - I don't know much about Dras other than hype - and as well as Can has flourished under Benoit Allaire, he was undrafted. That's why this is a discourse. What would you like to see the Oil give up for Talbot?"
rangers,38ukq1,SleepYourLifeAway,2,Sun Jun 7 01:38:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. We have a crazy amount of one thing on the Oilers, fast, skilled forwards. With McDavid coming in we also have a lot of Centers in the NHL and in our system. I've been given the impression that the Rangers really need centers, so a deal is definitely there, I just don't know what it is. But giving up one I'm sure wouldn't be that bad, if Talbot is as good as advertised."
rangers,38ukq1,SleepYourLifeAway,3,Sun Jun 7 01:43:22 2015 UTC,"The Rangers after this season will have Stepan and Brassard for 4 years+ each, and Kevin Hayes on an ELC. Definitely not weak at the center position. We need all manner of fast, skilled forwards, however."

rangers,38tm1k,nimperatori,15,Sat Jun 6 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"With what cap space? We can't afford Hank, Nash, and Malkin while also hoping to re-sign Stepan. We also have a lot of money invested in defensemen so that becomes an issue as well. So we'd more than likely have to get rid of one of Hank or Nash or one of Staal or Girardi to the Penguins. Which doesn't seem likely."
rangers,38tm1k,JKaye57,4,Sat Jun 6 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine if you somehow land Malkin then Stepan is not longer a need to resign. Plus Malkin never has any wingers to play with I'd imagine he'd be a monster if you let him play with Zucc and Nash, or Miller and Kreider or Hayes. Either way I'm with you I don't think there is a way to make the money work without unloading some key pieces."

rangers,38tm1k,NJ_Yankees_Fan,2,Sun Jun 7 02:32:42 2015 UTC,Mark Twain quoted someone about lies and statistics. Averaging 3 goals a game looks impressive but means nothing when we still lost the series after getting shut out twice. Especially since Tampa also scored 21 goals in those same 7 games. The offense didn't fully disappear but you can't argue that there were a few individual games they didn't show up.

rangers,38tm1k,thehockeychimp,6,Sat Jun 6 19:35:17 2015 UTC,I think Nash has a no-trade clause in his contract too.

rangers,38tm1k,James_Caan,7,Sat Jun 6 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"Other than cap space, the other issue I could potentially see with this is, assuming we resign stepan, we would have 3 centers who think they deserve to be in the top 6, and one would be on the outside. It could potentially cause problems in the locker room."
rangers,38tm1k,aeroranger,6,Sat Jun 6 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Stepan would be going the other way anyway
rangers,38tm1k,DeanYoungblood10,4,Sat Jun 6 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe not necessarily. IF this were to happen, I could see the penguins being interested in someone like nash so crosby has a legitimate winger to play with."
rangers,38tm1k,aeroranger,3,Sat Jun 6 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"Certainly not out of the realm of possibility but I think it's more likely they they'd want a young, 1B center to Crosby who will be on a cheaper contract than Malkin for the foreseeable future rather than a winger making 7.8 million who can't perform in the playoffs and is on the wrong side of 30."
rangers,38tm1k,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"Nash may be on the wrong side of 30, but it's not like he is signed until he's 38 where it is clear he will drastically regressed.  While he could have done better point wise this playoff run, playing with an elite player like crosby can change a lot.  One reason we were able to shut down crosby this year is because we could focus on him and just him.  If nash were on his line, it could open up things for nash since there would be a huge focus on crosby.  I'm not saying it will lead to a better performance, but it definitely could."

rangers,38tm1k,artvandelay1994,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"Be realistic. Pittsburgh is in no way letting him go with the skills he brings to the table and with what they're paying him. They have more then enough cap space to keep him. Also, Malkin's been quoted recently that he wants to stay in Pitt because he, Crosby and Fleury have won a Cup together and he thinks they can do it again."
rangers,38tm1k,defiantgrit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"Malkin's salary cap hit is $9.5 million.  Rangers need to reduce salary for next year's ~$71 million ceiling.  So Rangers would almost 100% have to (at least) trade Nash to get Malkin. I'm not sure Nash is getting moved this summer, so a Malkin trade seems highly unlikely."

rangers,38tm1k,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Mon Jun 8 01:31:36 2015 UTC,lol this is stupid. I'll never understand fans claiming that they wouldn't want an elite player from a rival team on their own team. If by some miracle the Rangers managed to get John Tavares or Claude Giroux or Alex Ovechkin or Malkin on the Rangers I would be so fucking happy. You'd have to be an idiot to not want any of those guys on your team.    Marty Brodeur is the only exception tho lol.
rangers,38tm1k,SleepYourLifeAway,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah fuck Brodeur for sure.  I would have a very, very hard time rooting for Giroux, Ovenchicken, or Malkin.  I know they're elite but I just fucking hate them so much... next level douchebaggery hahaha"

rangers,38thzx,Carzo,5,Sat Jun 6 18:03:48 2015 UTC,I would trade Cam for sure. Kid is talented enough to be a starter and he has already proven it this season. I don't think Shittsburgh would give up Malkin and even if they wanted to who would we give up for him? I think we need to focus on our bottom 2 lines this offseason and get permanent replacement for MSL and Boyle.
rangers,38thzx,thehockeychimp,0,Sat Jun 6 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"Talbot, Klein and mcilrath for yakupov. Gives us a scoring winger that I think will flourish under one of the best coaches in the league. This would put hunwick on the third pairing until Brady skjei or Conor Allen are ready to go. It would also clear up a little cap space I believe (I'm pretty sure yakupov is on a contract smaller than kleins 3M a year) that could be used to re-sign all our Free agents this year"
rangers,38thzx,onebandonesound,3,Sun Jun 7 13:48:25 2015 UTC,I would give a good draft pick instead of Mcilirith simply cause we still need good depth on our bench. Other than that it seems like a good deal for a 1st overall pick.
rangers,38thzx,thehockeychimp,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"I don't believe mcilrath is going anywhere. He's big and slow and an intimidator, and there's unfortunately not much room for guys like him in the league anymore. Not to mention he hasn't really improved much since he's been drafted, I really think he's a bust.  I do think we could trade him though and get some value in return from a team that still thinks he could be something. I want him off the team to give minutes to other young talent that I think could actually make the NHL"
rangers,38thzx,onebandonesound,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"Did you miss the article where Beukeboom talks about how much progress McIlrath has made this year since December? There will always be a need for crease-clearing defensemen, Dylan is going to be that guy for us. He's coming along slower than we'd all like, but he's getting there."
rangers,38thzx,HeadForTheSHallows,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:32:04 2015 UTC,So you want to trade a d-man who before his injury and probably early return from that injury during the playoffs was widely regarded at times as being one of the Rangers best for another Nikolai Zherdev in the making?
rangers,38thzx,defiantgrit,0,Mon Jun 8 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"I think Klein had an entirely unsustainable shooting percentage at the start of the season and he fell back to earth in the second half. I think for his defensive production hunwick is just as good at a fraction of the price, and we need all the cap space we can get for our free agents   I think yakupov in a good environment (read: not the oilers) with a great coach and solid productive players around him blossoms into a perennial 30 goal scorer, if not more"
rangers,38thzx,onebandonesound,2,Mon Jun 8 04:58:14 2015 UTC,You guys are overvaluing Hunwick who was a perennial journeyman his entire career. I don't know what your participation level on this sub is but Klein was highly regarded as putting up one of the best defensive performances any of the Rangers had this season and last at a fraction of the price a guy his talent level could produce. Optimus Klein? Remember?  Yakupov isn't worth both Talbot and Klein. Though I'd let them take Allen or Skjei with Talbot for Yakupov. The difficulty is though is Nail really that talented or is he another Zherdev? There have been a lot of highly drafted Russian picks that have busted recently. I don't know if I'd let any of our top 4 defensemen go for Nail. I think if Nail gets traded and is treated awfully in NY by the fans and media he'll run right to the KHL.
rangers,38thzx,defiantgrit,0,Mon Jun 8 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree on most of your points. Before getting traded to the Rangers, Klein was nothing special, he was maybe a step above journeyman. Since coming to the Rangers his offensive output has increased but his defensive play is still on par with hunwick who just seems to work well in our system. Hunwick would be a temporary solution while we wait for a dman to come over from Hartford. There is absolutely no way the Rangers should even think about trading skjei unless they have a chance at landing a top 5 in the league superstar, I wouldn't do skjei for yakupov straight up because I don't want to wind up looking like Montreal in the Gomez trade.   I won't deny that there's a chance yakupov might bust, but I'm willing to trade Klein betting on those odds. From everything I've seen, he has the talent and is just in a toxic environment that makes it difficult to grow as a young player. The chance of him reaching his potential is worth a (on our team) bottom pair defenseman that'll 1 or 2 million in cap, and a goalie we wouldn't be able to retain anyway."
rangers,38thzx,onebandonesound,0,Mon Jun 8 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"Klein played a bunch of his career with Nashville. Then played for the Rangers. Do you know what journeyman is or are you just spouting the same BS rhetoric everyone else is for sake of spouting it?  Hunwick couldn't sniff a roster spot for the majority of his career. NY was the first time he saw any regular play time and even then after the Yandle trade he had to sit. Klein has played for two teams in his career and now has top minutes with the Rangers.  You're willing to bet that sort of stalwart defense on a kid who could end up being the next Zherdev?  Again, I""m going to ask you the same thing I ask everyone else with these crazy trades.  How does trading for Yakupov make this team better? Has Yakupov ever played in the playoffs? What the Rangers need is consistent offensive performance in the playoffs. Yakupov has never played in the playoffs. You're willing to trade for what that improves this team and makes them win that game 7 vs Tampa?"
rangers,38thzx,defiantgrit,3,Thu Jun 11 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"I am definitely interested in Frolik from Winnipeg.   Right Winger, 42 points last season, UFA, and could add some solid depth."
rangers,38thzx,themagicalpanda,2,Sat Jun 6 18:21:06 2015 UTC,Trading talbot for Malkin would never happen but we should trade him for a good depth player. We can bring up hunwick to replace Boyle all we really need is someone to replace MSL on the right wing
rangers,38thzx,Michael_the_Guido,3,Sat Jun 6 20:16:28 2015 UTC,The pens dont need Talbot. They need bottom 6 depth and a winger for crosby.

rangers,38thzx,ncolaros,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:12:36 2015 UTC,"Lindberg is a center, so he wouldn't necessarily be MSL's replacement. Buchnevich is a winger, so he'd be an actual replacement. Lindberg should be up next year, though."
rangers,38thzx,n7staq,2,Sun Jun 7 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"I liked the way Hayes played on the Wing in the playoffs, so I thought it's possible we could move him there and play Lindberg at Center."
rangers,38thzx,ncolaros,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard that idea thrown around quite a bit. I like the idea of putting Fast on the 2nd line and having a Hags-Lindberg-Hayes 3rd line. However, Miller will hopefully still be here so AV's gonna have plenty of lines to experiment with."
rangers,38thzx,n7staq,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:32:43 2015 UTC,I sure hope they re-sign JT. He's really proved himself capable this year after showing flashes in the past. The guy really ended the season doing great and if he keeps it going he will finally be worth his draft status.
rangers,38thzx,haamm,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, dude had a killer playoff. Would be criminal not to resign him at his current price"
rangers,38thzx,n7staq,2,Sun Jun 7 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"I am fairly certain we will see Cam go one way or another. He has already expressed interest in finding a #1 starter position, and apparently would have signed a longer extension with us if it weren't for that reason.    What I've noticed is, however, is it seems like quite a few people are overvaluing Cam. Don't get me wrong, I really like him and thought he's always done a great job stepping in -- especially during Hank's injury. But I still think his sample size of games played is really small...and for that reason alone, I don't think we would see a one-to-one kind of trade (if we're looking for a better/top player, that is). I really think Cam would have to go in some kind of package deal.   Moreover, you have to look at the teams that would be in need of a goalie. EDM and SJ have expressed interest (I still feel like he might have a shot in Buffalo. I have no source/reason for this besides gut feelings, though, heh). But other than that, I don't think there are too many teams that are in absolute dire need of a solid #1 goaltender (I'm not entirely familiar what's going on league-wide, so I could be mistaken). Otherwise, it would almost seem like he'd become more of a trade piece than the key reason for a trade, y'know? I mean, not that that isn't possible. But I guess the point I'm making is, the depth in our goaltending is quite favourable. So if the return on Cam isn't great...I don't see why we would move him.   Any ways, to answer your question; sure, I would make the trade. But realistically, I don't think it would happen."
rangers,38thzx,keetner,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"Talbot stated that he wants more time playing under Benoit Alaire and watching Lundqvist. I don't think I've ever heard him say he really has a desire to stay in New York, which makes sense since Lundqvist is obviously our number one for a good number of years."
rangers,38thzx,Jwpt,3,Mon Jun 8 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to agree. Seems like Cam is just going to stick around and give NYR another strong year as a backup. Then he leaves and signs somewhere for $$ and #1 spot.  I get that people always want a return, but you're not getting much in a trade for a goalie with an expiring contract, despite his high value. I doubt he gets traded."
rangers,38thzx,brian2686,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"I don't see how holding on to Cam past this summer will benefit us. Trade him while his value is still high after the show he put on this season. He'd bring in high draft picks at most from the teams that are in the market for starting goalies (Edmonton, Philly, Buffalo etc.)"
rangers,38thzx,datfritch,2,Sat Jun 6 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"Flyers? Mason has been very good for them (and honestly, I think is underrated at times); I doubt they would be looking for one."
rangers,38thzx,keetner,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"I've read rumors that Malkin wants out of Pittsburg. Would you trade Cam for him?   1) It would need to be A LOT more than Talbot to get Malkin. I doubt the pens take anything less than Girardi, Talbot and high pick for Malkin. Even then it's unlikely.  2) It doesn't make any sense for the Pens to want to trade for Talbot (unless they are also trading MAF). MAF is a better goalie than Talbot and still has plenty of years left in his career. If Talbot is getting traded it's going to be to a team that wants to use him as a #1 goalie, otherwise what we get in return is extremely unlikely to be worth giving Talbot away in the first place.   3) Our center depth isn't great, but fishing for Malkin (or someone of his caliber) would cost way too much. The cost that it would take to get Malkin would cripple us too much for a trade to ever be worth it.  4) We would be fucked for cap space. 8.7 million is a ton to bring in to a team that's already close to the limit."
rangers,38thzx,Rocoman14,0,Sat Jun 6 22:54:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgot as an armchair GM that the Pens have no reason to want Cam. That wouldn't make any sense."

rangers,38thzx,EarnSquirm,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:33:02 2015 UTC,The only teams that will trade for Talbot are teams that:  A) Are looking to immediately improve goaltending B) Are in a position to offer Talbot a big contract next summer should he continue to play well in the NHL C) Are probably teams that take a shot at Devan Dubnyk if/when he hits the open market on July 1. Very unlikely Talbot is traded before Dubnyk signs somewhere.

rangers,38p80k,kalegg,18,Fri Jun 5 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"By his track record I mean that he was the interim GM for the bruins for the summer of 2006 and had the draft of a lifetime. He picked Kessel in the first, Lucic in the 2nd, and Marchand in the 3rd. He also traded  Andrew Raycroft straight up for Tuuka Rask. The bruins stupidly fired him after the summer. Their 2007 draft was a complete bust without him. The only player to make the NHL was their 1st round (8th overall) pick of Zach Hamill. He only played 20 games in the NHL though. Jeff Gorton is the real deal."
rangers,38p80k,kalegg,8,Fri Jun 5 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"Guy said Slats was awful, so I had to instill some knowledge in him. (gretzky mentioned because he cited signing gretzky as a terrible move):  Shall I name the ways you are wrong?  Marian Gaborik had not one, but two 40 goal campaigns for the Rangers, and when he faded Sather dealt him for: Derick Brassard, who if you didnt know, is one of the best players on the team, and is on a fantastic contract.  Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier carried an injury decimated team the the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997. Gretzky notched 97, 90, and then 62 points in 70 games in his final season in the league. Along with 20 points in the 1997 run. Also fun fact: SATHER DIDNT BECOME THE RANGERS GM UNTIL THE YEAR 2000!  Alexei Kovalev was a rookie with the Rangers and spent 5 years with them before Slats was ever involved.  Pavel Bure had 31 goals in 51 games with the Rangers, on a team that couldnt stop a puck due to awful goaltending. Lindros had similar numbers.  Brendan Shanahan recorded 108 points in 140 games with the Rangers.  Bobby Holik? Awful.  Scott Gomez? Not a great contract, had a few good seasons with us, one at 73 points the other at 58, and was ultimately traded for Ryan McDonagh.  Drury? Again, not a great contract, but had several good seasons with us.  Markus Naslund? Wasnt a great signing, 46 points in 82 games. Contract wasnt expensive and was for a single year.  Jaromir Jagr has our fucking single season goal scoring record, our single season points record and was our captain. HE HAD 290 POINTS IN 246 GAMES AS A RANGER.  If you want to knock Sather knock:  Girardi's six year contract. Drafting Dylan McCilrath over how many other guys. Hugh Jessiman. Letting Zuccarello go back to the KHL the first time. Letting Stralman walk. Letting Boyle walk. Signing Tanner Glass to take Derek Dorsett's spot. Drafting Randy McNaught over Tyler Johnson ( i blame Clarke for this, as with most of our draft choices really)"
rangers,38p80k,MikeyRage,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:24:57 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much spot on. I'm going to go ahead and disagree with letting Boyle walk. Boyle wanted top 6 with NYR and wasn't getting it. That was the big concern. He wound up playing 3rd line minutes for Tampa anyway, but rangers certainly weren't ready to upgrade him to top6. I don't blame either party and don't think it was a mistake on either side. Boyle's in the finals and we certainly didn't lose to tampa because NYR didn't have him and Tampa did.  That is totally fucking nitpicking because I agree with everything else. People forget Gomez was the leading scorer when he was here. Why did people expect a 10 goal 70 assist guy to all-of-a-sudden score 30 goals? Then Sather moved his crazy contract for McD.   Gaborik only flourished in LA because he was a secondary scorer for them. He would've been the same guy if LA expected him to lead the way. And he scored 40 for the Rangers when he WAS leading the way. Gabby was a great deal.   McIlrath wasn't even a terrible pick. His knee injury and the Rangers great D-depth have kept him off the roster. He is probably an NHLer for a bottom 10 team. This is the offseason that makes or busts him. The real problem was leaving Cam Fowler on the board (and other forwards... but they were only great picks in hind-sight. Cam was ranked high and was a sure bet), but he wasn't the type of D-man we needed at the time. NYR had Del Zotto, Gilroy and Sauer. Plus a young McD. They had great skaters and puck movers, but the only tough guy was Boogard. I honestly think it was a smart, calculated risk. They were banking on MDZ developing after his stud rookie season and Gilroy being a solid 3rd pair guy. Neither works out (MDZ sophmore slumps hard), so missing Cam Fowler hurts more. But if the undertaker is punching people out in a Blueshirt next year, it will be considered a great gamble.   I fucking love talking hockey."

If the Blue Shirts don't win the Cup within the next two years, or even after next year, I think the Rangers should move him for the right price. Before you spit coffee into your monitor or start screaming incoherently about some maniac on reddit shooting out blasphemy, let me make a couple points.   Our farm system is a joke. The Yandle trade was an indefensible disaster and cost us a 30 goal scorer for the next decade. I couldn't believe the trade was done at the time, and I can't believe it now. AD was our only prospect worth mentioning, and I can't imagine the farm will get any better over time. See here for more. http://www.hockeysfuture.com/teams/new_york_rangers/ Great goaltending isn't commonplace but it also isn't some necessity. The Hawks are about to complete a salary cap dynasty with Corey Crawford playing a prominent role. Tampa and Anaheim made deep runs with above average netminders who's main attribute is height. Ottawa and Minny had their seasons saved by goalies off the scrap heap. If you provide a solid defensive framework, then the burden will be lessened on the goalie. See: Tuuka Rask's trophy case.  Money is better spent elsewhere. Hank made $8.5 million this year and $11 million next. That's too much when the salary cap sits at ~$61 million  $71 million. I love Hank but I'd take Talbot and a $10 million first line center any day of the week. Hank deserves a Cup, and he doesn't deserve to bear 100% of the burden night in and night out. It's not fair, and I think the Rangers play with less urgency knowing he's in the net. If Boston can trade Bourque, we could trade Hank.   Edit: salary cap estimate was off"
rangers,38k06j,Incandenza2015,7,Fri Jun 5 08:10:56 2015 UTC,"First, I respect your opinion, and am glad for the discussion!  Second, I'd like to provide a counter-opinion for two of your points, just to be devil's advocate.    1)  We have no bonafide proof that Duclair is/was going to score 30 goals a season for a decade.  Who can honestly say that?  He's never played a full season in the NHL, and in 18 games for us he only managed one goal.  If we use that ratio for a full season, he scores 4 or 5 goals.  Now, it's unlikely he won't improve, but to say he's a 30 goal scorer for a decade is a complete guess.  And I wouldn't write off our farm system yet.  We've got plenty of talent down there and have already used it from time to time, with decent effect (Skapski, Lindberg, Allen/McIlrath, etc).    4)  I agree he doesn't deserve all the burden, and also that we play with less urgency.  However, trading Hank is not the answer.  The worst thing we could do is give up on getting him a trophy and make a trade that means we could face off against him in the future.  He loves NY, we made him the face of the franchise, he's the main representative for the Garden of Dreams Foundation, and frankly, we live or die with him.  If we trade him away, it will be an absolutely massive hammerblow to the organization and the fans.  This to me is one of those times where we have to keep trying to win with him as long as we have him.  I don't see us making a trade and getting anyone nearly as talented, professional, and organizationally important as Hank.    For the record, I love Talbs and think he could take the reigns of this team and be successful.  But I don't think he'd be as consistent as Hank year after year, and can't see him having the lasting impact on the city and fans that Hank has had (and does)."
rangers,38k06j,blueshirtdave,0,Fri Jun 5 13:14:32 2015 UTC,Haha I appreciate the discussion as well. You've made plenty of good points. I was more venting frustration with another season finishing too early the team relying on Hank to bail them out.   I stand by my take on the Yandle trade. It was indefensible whether Duclair scores 0 or 500 goals as a pro. He was our top asset at the time and Sather spent it on a 5th defenseman who's an adventure defensively if you're being kind. Someone who could win faceoffs and snipe would have made me infinitely happier.
rangers,38k06j,Incandenza2015,0,Fri Jun 5 20:44:07 2015 UTC,He was not our top asset. Buchenivich and Skjei were always ranked higher.

rangers,38k06j,rcn85,-1,Fri Jun 5 18:52:25 2015 UTC,Definitely hyperbole but he's 19 with a high ceiling. I was more frustrated with using an asset to fill a non-need than anything else. Rangers desperately needed help in the face-off circle and someone with some snipe. Instead Sather used his best asset to get a 5th defenseman.
rangers,38k06j,Incandenza2015,2,Fri Jun 5 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"Idk, I think wingers can be found in FA.  Its hard to get a top flight offensive defenseman, they dont hit the market often, plus its at half cost this year and next.  The 4 1st round picks traded hurt more than DuClair (IMO)."

The off-season is just happy recollection, you remember the times where things didn't look good and remember when the team turned it around and started to win.   I enjoyed this season up until the third period of Game 7. The city doing the Rangerstown was great, the viewing parties were nearly as good as being in the Garden, got Matteau's and some other rangers' autographs and pictures. Besides Olympic houses, the rangers are the only team I know that does this every year they're in the playoffs.  Unlike last year however, a trip to the Cup was more of a given with expectations were higher being the President's trophy winner. Although they have at least 5 years with this current squad to make the playoffs every year and alot of young guys like Hayes, Krieder, Miller, not even in their primes (just hope they stay in NY and perform well).  It's like what a wise person once said.  You take the good. You take the bad. You take them both  And then you have  The facts of Life The facts of Life."

rangers,38jsvx,notromanbellic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:12:37 2015 UTC,"The feeling I felt when the rangers lost was a feeling I had before, but with the mets in 2006. It ripped my heart out and made me watch as it got stabbed before my eyes, and game 7 made me relive that pain. It was game 7 of the NLCS. The mets were down 3-1, with two outs. Carlos Beltran was at the plate, full count and bases juiced. Adam Wainwright winds up and delivers. Beltran watches the last pitch cross the plate without budging, ending the mets dreams, leading to two back to back collapses of epic proportions in a row, plus 6 years of horrid mediocrity to date.   I can't help but feel the same way after game 7 of this year's ecf. In 2006, it was the mets year. They were supposed to win it all. This year was the rangers year. We were supposed to bring Lord Stanley back to New York. But like the mets, they didn't show up. They were flat. They changed the ending, alright, but they changed it for the worse. It's the same nightmare all over again, and I just want to wake up.  The difference is, I'm more optimistic for the future. Hank is still at the top of his game, we have tons of youth down on the farm, and a solid core to keep building on. Let's just hope Sather and the front office don't fuck this up."

There is no way we're getting Draisaitl (selected 3rd overall) for Cam Talbot and a mid-grade defenseman.   What intrigues me is that SJ is interested in Talbot, also. They have a deeper ""prospect pool"" than Edmonton. In particular, they have a center named Dan O'Regan (drafted in the 5th round) that has tremendous upside. Hockey's Future literally used the word ""electric"" to describe his style.   They also have Mirco Mueller (a late first round choice) that is an interesting defensive prospect.   Those two guys in SJ fall more in line with the type of return we can expect from Talbot."

rangers,38n1cn,firstdibbz,0,Fri Jun 5 07:40:50 2015 UTC,"Somewhat unpopular opinion: At 2.8M for 3years, I really don't want to give up Klein, he's the one underpaid D we have and he plays great. If we cant find a trading partner for Boyle and he has to stay, I would try and get Staal to waive his no movement clause.        Never quite got back to where he was before the injuries and makes more money than any other D. We can't pay someone 5.7M to be on the second parring. I love Staal and for less money I would love to keep him, but 5.7 for what, 5years, is too much for him. He plays great defensively but we already have two of the best shutdown D's in the league with McD and G, and Staal doesn't add any offense to our game, both Klein and Yandle do (something all good teams have to have). Our 3rd parring should be two low cap hit players who are responsible to eat up a couple of min each game.       This year: McD and G Yandle and Klein (Open)/Hunwick and Boyle       Next Year: McD and G Yandle and Klein Hunwick and (Open)        I know it would look better with Staal on it, but next year Boyle's contract runs out, so we can actually keep Yandle. Who I think has played real well for us and adds offense to our team.       Either way this was a long winded explanation to why I don't want to get rid of Klein. Financially it makes absolutely no sense trading a really solid two-way D who only makes 2.8M. Our cap situation looks soo shitty every year, we are basically handcuffing ourself sometimes. I love Staal and I don't want to see him go, but the more I look at it, he's the one that needs to get moved if we want to resolve our cap issues. If we can find someone to take Boyle, I would consider keeping Staal and then eventually moving Klein in a year when we need money for Yandle, but who knows if anyone will take Boyle.       Having said that I would love to get Draisaitl, Im german so i was really excited to see him enter the league."
rangers,38n1cn,Robotron_25,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:12:30 2015 UTC,Klein doesn't add offense. There's a reasons he's scored more then 4 goals once in his career that's lasted about a decade. There's also a reason he scored 1 goal after the month of December.
rangers,38n1cn,MikeyRage,0,Fri Jun 5 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"Im talking about the way he plays, Staal is a much more cautious player, Klein will skate to the net if he thinks he can get a good chance off."
rangers,38n1cn,Robotron_25,0,Fri Jun 5 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling Talbot will be here all season as Skapski is hurt and he is not ready for the NHL as of yet. If Talbot has a good year and all of the youth in Edmonton still don't gel, you might see Talbot go to Edmonton but not for a first. Why trade Klein as he  is coming into his own and has a great shot on the PP. We will probably give McIlrath a shot as we need a big body on D who will hit, but if he cant play steady NHL D, he will be a wasted pick and trade fodder real quick."

Obviously Lindberg is the most advanced and most likely to make the team. Mueller and Bourque are right there also. Haggerty can really shoot the puck, I have no idea how the rest of his game looks though.  On defense, Skjei left Minnesota and is probably the top D prospect. I'd imagine he needs another year in the minors, he's projected as a ""shutdown"" D-man, and they normally need more time. NYR also have Conor Allen and Mat Bodie. Plus big McIlrath will get his last chance to crack the NYR lineup.   I expect MSL to be gone and hopefully they can move Boyle (I doubt it though). Hunwick was serviceable, so I don't mind him staying, but if they are confident in any of the D prospects, he'll be gone. I wouldn't mind giving Sheppard a chance out of camp, but he'll have to take a pay cut to be on a top 5 team.   I'm excited about the competition at camp. Fast and Miller really stepped up this year and deserve more responsibility. Kreider seems committed to really developing and could still improve. The Rangers have paid their core players handsomely, I hope the in-house investment and commitment continues."
rangers,38jsqw,onebandonesound,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:22:23 2015 UTC,"Biased because RPI but I love Ryan haggerty's game. No idea how he's been developing, but in college he was a very chippy scrappy player with a hell of a shot who just knew where to be. His positioning, at least offensively, was phenomenal. I wanna see him get a shot and see how he skates with the big boys, even if it's only for preseason"
rangers,38jsqw,brian2686,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was good in the few games I saw him. I think he played traverse city and a couple preseason games. He looked like he was a player. Kid has a nasty shot and was all around solid. He was closer to making the team than you would think.  People forget we had a ton of competition last year. Step broke his leg and all of a sudden 3 spots were open. Hayes, Duclair and Fast took those spots easily, no one else really had a chance, but Hayes was a last minute free agent signing and Duclair surprised everyone by being a year ahead. Fast was expected because he was a call-up. We also had Stempniak and Matt Lombardi on contract. Even Ryan Malone had a chance to make the squad. Tanner Glass makes the team as the 13th forward and even Chris Mueller had a call-up where he played well.   Ryan Bourque spent the majority of the play-offs with the Rangers. It's part of the reason Hartford lost, because they were missing him for so long while he was practicing with the big club.   Oscar Lindberg is still considered next man up, even ahead of Ryan Bourque, simply because of his play-style. Rangers love those swedes.   Ryan Haggerty is right there too. He was in the conversation last year with all those guys listed above.   Gonna be a sick training camp, that's for sure."

rangers,38jsqw,lionson76,2,Thu Jun 4 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"Although the league still isn't quite sure what the cap will be next year, they're expecting something in the $71M range.  Using numbers here, that means we'll have closer to $10M in cap space - not $11.5M as this article says. Does anyone know how accurate any of these numbers are?  EDIT: We have $59.5M locked up for sure. So yeah, cap space looks to be about $11.5M.  Either way, I'm not sure the article's estimates on the UFA/RFAs are realistic. I'd say both Fast and Miller will get bigger raises than just $100K. Yesterday I estimated that one or both of them would be closer to $1.5M. Perhaps that's too high. Maybe $1.25M each?  Hagelin's cap hit was $2.25M last year, but his salary was $2.4M. He's also due a raise, I think. Somewhere around $2.75-3M?  And I think the only way Hunwick stays is if he get a slight increase. Someone else will certainly throw another $100-200K his way. I wouldn't be surprised if he even breaks $1M AAV. He stepped up admirably when Kleiner got hurt.  Shep would also get a raise if he stays; he was only at $193K last year. If we can bring them both back for a total of $1.5M, I think that's money well spent."

Don't think he's gonna get $3 mill but I can definitely see $2.75.  If Hunwick does ask for more than an extra $100k I would say no. I really like Connor Allen in our minors still and feel he could step up and be immediately effective.  Shep's a weird player too. I feel like he could be great, but we never got to see enough of him. I would like to re-sign him, not sure for exactly what price though."

Hm, I see Spotrac counts a few extra players against the cap than Hockey's Cap does: Chris Summers, Nick Tarnasky, and Ryan Bourque. That can't be right.   They have zero leverage in negotiations.   I mean, they could always hold out or accept another team's offer, so I wouldn't say zero leverage. Their performance this year strengthened their value as top 9 forwards. Miller top 6, maybe.

The other of Yakupov/Eberle, and Draisaitl are the ""we'd love to keep, but will probably need to trade eventually. This more applies to Draisaitl than to the ""loser"" of Ebs/Yak.   Schultz is most likely not part of the plan, though it's not like we are actively shopping him. Klefbom is faaar better and more valuable to us, but even he isn't in the the ""big"" list.  That said, I don't think it's realistic to expect one of these big guys in a trade for strictly Talbot what with his free agency coming up. These guys will be expensive, and we'll have to part with at least one sooner or later, presumably Draisaitl, but that will likely be closer to when ELCs are running out for Drai and McDavid."

Giants played in Yankee Stadium. Coincidentally all three have patriotic colors.   Islanders/Mets/Jets  Mets and Jets shared Shea when both won in 69. All three were much younger than the three teams above. Islanders and Mets were the best teams of NY in the 80s. Mets, and Islanders same color scheme.   also if you live in Nassau you were closer to both Shea and the Coliseum than Yankee Stadium and the Garden.

It wasn't a rivalry series. Cooper made a bunch of douchey comments but that's not atypical for a coach trying to rally his guys.   I lived near the Tampa area for a few years during school. Of course I didn't wish for the best while they played my team, but I always hope they sustain some good hockey teams because its actually a great hockey market. The St. Pete Times forum was amazing and the area around it is great now that its called Amalie Arena or whatever.   As much as I'm a fan of the Rangers I'm a fan of the game, and success for teams in the non-traditional markets is good for hockey overall. The more a strong fanbase grows in places like Nashville, Tampa, Columbus, the more people will start to realize that hockey isn't insignificant."

rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,7,Thu Jun 4 16:51:10 2015 UTC,"lol give me a break, adv stats is hardly objective. This isn't like statistical analysis in baseball; adv stats is very much in its infancy.  And that one man is Alexander Ovechkkn, the bet goal scorer in the league. When that guy says you're pretty tough, you have to be pretty tough."
rangers,38figc,esseo2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:57:03 2015 UTC,"How aren't they objective? They're numbers not someone's opinion.    And besides that ""tough to play against"" doesn't necessarily mean good. 4th line goons are tough to play against if they hit you a lot but they're still usually bad."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Thu Jun 4 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"Numbers without context are meaningless. In my opinion, his high SA rate in the defensive zone is because Girardi has an INSANE number of defensive zone starts compared to offensive zone starts. Like, much, much higher than the rest of the league. And then when you're on a team that can't win faceoffs.... you tend to stay there, at least for a little bit."
rangers,38figc,esseo2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:15:49 2015 UTC,The guy who compiled the stats in the OP addressed another poster later in the thread who brought up zone starts and did an analysis    Seems like the guy in OP doesn't value zone starts very much so I'd be interested to see his reasoning why.

rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,9,Thu Jun 4 00:42:42 2015 UTC,"Are you really telling me that AO doesn't count as an authority on which defensemen are effective?  This isn't really a case of this logical fallacy. If I'd said Carlos Beltran is a Girardi fan, so he must be good, that'd be applicable. AO is the most effective offensive player in the game."
rangers,38figc,Zer0flames,-9,Thu Jun 4 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"Ovi is one of the best goalscorers in the game obviously but I would say this argument is akin to saying ""well the coach plays him a lot"" and in that case it's similar to appeal to authority. Ovi and AV know their shit but ignoring objective evidence because Ovi says Girardi is hard to play against or because AV gives him lots of ice time is a fallacy."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,10,Thu Jun 4 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"Individuals who are an authority on the subject really ought to be considered. Obviously, AV playing Girardi in and of itself doesn't make him a great player, but it really ought to be considered.  When Girardi is named an NHL all star, it ought to be considered.  Advanced Stats in hockey can be indicative, but hardly determine a player's value or skill, partly because of the completely situational and sometimes random nature of the game, and partly because advanced statistics aren't nearly as, well, advanced in hockey as they are in other sports.   Dan Girardi has proven many times over that he's capable of containing some of the biggest stars in the game, and he's the best option we have on the right side. To suggest he's a bottom paring defenseman is asinine, and clearly fueled by a HFboards poster personal feelings about a player (as someone who used to post there, all of HF is fueled by rage and vitriol. Brad Richards second year was the worst.)"
rangers,38figc,Zer0flames,0,Thu Jun 4 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"Right, again AV and Ovi are authorities on the subject of hockey but there's objective evidence which goes against both of them.     That all star nomination happened in 2012 which was actually a good season for Girardi (you can see on the dCAimpact/dcorsiimpact plot)    Again this is a pretty comprehensive analysis (at least of 5 on 5 play) and I'm pretty sure Corsi and Fenwick are capable of accounting for a lot of situations.  He clearly doesn't contain big stars as often as you think considering his numbers though. I'd think it's more asinine to ignore evidence which contradicts your opinion simply because it contradicts your opinion."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,6,Thu Jun 4 01:16:23 2015 UTC,"Except statistics aren't perfect, because of the reasons I lifted above. And advanced statistics, in hockey in particular, are not always, and often not, indicative of a players overall play.  Hockey is a rare game where the eyeball test is often the most effective."
rangers,38figc,Zer0flames,2,Thu Jun 4 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry to interrupt this very serious argument but I just wanted to say that when you said:   because of the reasons I lifted above.   ..I read it as ""listed"" like you what you meant just with a listhp.  Carry on."
rangers,38figc,archersoflovecrosse,2,Thu Jun 4 02:38:11 2015 UTC,Do your arguments even lift bro?
rangers,38figc,Darclite,-4,Thu Jun 4 02:59:45 2015 UTC,"Well like, how would you say that these stats are limited? Again, it's not like the guy just pulled up Girardi's corsi and was like ""he's bad."" The Hextally charts in particular are pretty damning.    Also I'd say eye tests are limited in that they're prone to bias more often than numbers are."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,28,Thu Jun 4 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"If advanced stats were all that mattered, we'd be a middle of the road team. Out team corsi was pretty average.   This is why advanced hockey stats haven't necessarily convinced me yet, unlike in baseball. Advanced stats aren't predictive. You can look up a million articles about their merits, but ultimately, the team with the best advanced stats never win the Stanley Cup. I'm not being anti-progressive. As I said, I think baseball has done a great job with advanced stats because they tend to be way better at predicting success.   Once hockey gets to that level, then I'll care more about their advanced stats."
rangers,38figc,ncolaros,-1,Wed Jun 3 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"but ultimately, the team with the best advanced stats never win the Stanley Cup.    Right but teams within the top 5 in categories like corsi and fenwick do. Having good values for those stats doesn't guarantee a win but it certainly improves your chances of winning by a wide margin, especially in the playoffs."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Wed Jun 3 22:54:46 2015 UTC,"(For the record, I didn't downvote you)  You're right that the two teams in the Stanley Cup this year are both in the top 5 for CF%. But a look at the rest of the teams who made it to the playoffs (and who didn't) is telling.  LA was #1, despite missing the playoffs. The Rangers were 20th, despite winning the Presidents trophy. So as not to be biased, most teams who made the playoffs were within the top 15, but teams like Montreal, Calgary, and Anaheim were below the 15 (along with us, as previously mentioned).  I know CF% isn't the only advanced stat, and this analysis doesn't disprove those stats entirely. That's not my point, though. My point is that the stats aren't predictive enough to be relied upon entirely. I do think they are good at giving a general summation of a team or a player, but without actually watching the games, they don't always do the teams or the players justice.   I also think dump and chase hockey tends to make defensemen look bad (because it counts as a turnover, I believe) and the cycle makes forwards look bad because it doesn't always result in a shot and can also lead to turnovers."
rangers,38figc,ncolaros,0,Thu Jun 4 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah LA missing the playoffs was weird but I think that had something to do with their terrible OT and SO record (not 100% on that though). Montreal made it basically because of Carey Price, Calgary regressed in the playoffs and I think they're gonna be kind of like last season's Avs in that they may not be as successful next season as they were this year. I don't know what the fuck is up with Anaheim though, they've been baffling analytics people for a while. Every trend is going to have a few exceptions though. Ultimately even when the Rangers and Ducks made it to the conference finals the better possession teams won (Chicago and Tampa).     But yeah of course stats aren't predictive to be relied upon exclusively, nobody is saying that. The dude in the post that's linked here mentions a lot of non-statistical things that Girardi does poorly towards the bottom of the post. And with my comment I was just saying that having a good CF% improves likelihood of success; obviously it doesn't completely guarantee victory.    Interesting point about dump and chase though, I'm not really sure how that's counted either. But I feel like cycling the puck could still count for good possession since you're not allowing shots."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,5,Thu Jun 4 00:24:09 2015 UTC,"I guess I just disagree with a lot of what we said about the non-statistical stuff. I think G-man blocking shots is good, and we need a bit more of it. I'm convinced Tampa Bay won because they spoiled some of our best chances by going down and blocking shots. They out-shot blocked us the entire series.   I will say that Girardi does a fairly bad job at consistently getting the puck out of our zone, but I think he does a good job of forcing players to take bad angle shots because they can't go through him; they have to go around him instead. He's also not a very great offensive player, but he's no worse than Staal offensively, and they both have similar contracts. For the record, I thought Staal was our worst defensemen for the entirety of the playoffs, by the way. But both him and Girardi were playing hurt, so it's hard to fault them too much.   Finally, I just want to say having a guy who does not ever get injured and miss games is an underrated bonus, especially when our best defensemen is somewhat injury prone."
rangers,38figc,ncolaros,2,Thu Jun 4 00:32:46 2015 UTC,"Blocked shots is a statistical measure though. Corsi assumes blocked shots is random occurrence. But Fenwick does not include blocked shots, assuming that a blocked shot is not a random event, but a matter of skill."

rangers,38figc,bonesingyre,2,Thu Jun 4 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. It still doesn't eliminate my problem with hockey advanced statistics as they are. I'm assuming Girardi has bad Fenwick scores, but that they're better than his Corsi. All this tells me, then, is that Girardi blocks shots. My other criticisms of advanced stats remain."
rangers,38figc,ncolaros,-3,Thu Jun 4 03:15:05 2015 UTC,He does address the shot blocking but he makes the point that since G's fenwick isn't great there are still lots of chances happening that he doesn't block. And even still while I agree that it's a nice bonus to have someone who never gets injured I don't really like the idea of paying $5.5M a season for a guy just because they block shots and don't get hurt.
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Thu Jun 4 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is that he got paid too much, but not way too much. I thought 4.0-4.5 would have been better."
rangers,38figc,ncolaros,-1,Thu Jun 4 00:47:17 2015 UTC,I'd personally say less but to each his own
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,7,Thu Jun 4 00:49:55 2015 UTC,"Goal based statistics trend pretty similarly to shot based statistics. Over the past five years, which I'm guessing is the period he used, Girardi has a 50.2 GF%. That ranks 156th out of the 365 defensemen that have played at least 300 minutes in this period.  It would be nice if someone could mention that, you know, he's kind of an important penalty killer when discussing all this. Of the 64 defensemen who have played at least 150 minutes on it this season, his goals against per 60 ranks 8th best overall, and his Fenwick against per 60 ranks 4th best overall. So if we drive him out of town somebody better be replacing those minutes.  Also, it kinda helps that the dude never misses time.  This post is hardly unbiased also. That bit at the end is laughable analysis. And comparing him to other Rangers defensemen is going to paint a pretty poor picture. Most of those stats are pretty middle of the road and place him as a second pair guy if compared to the whole league.  Don't get me wrong, he's overpaid and isn't an elite defenseman by any means, but he's not a bubble third pair defenseman."
rangers,38figc,Darclite,2,Thu Jun 4 00:39:11 2015 UTC,"I posted upward that just the fact that OV vouches for his skill makes him top 4. There is no amount of adv stats in the world that can override OV's judgment to me.   What Girardi is actually bad at, by my eye, is he can't get the puck out of the defensive zone easily. He's not the best on the perimeter and he prefers to stick around the ""high-danger zones"" of the ice to block shots. Still, Girardi is the absolute first guy bar none on this team you want out there when you're protecting that one goal lead and the other team is throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you. That's what makes him the top RD over Klein and Boyle."

rangers,38figc,slicedpan,9,Wed Jun 3 23:30:15 2015 UTC,So it was Girardi's fault the team lost 2-0 in a game 7. Gotcha.
rangers,38figc,defiantgrit,3,Wed Jun 3 22:40:25 2015 UTC,You can't generate sustained offense when you're constantly getting hemmed in your own zone    Edit: Also this piece isn't just in reference to the playoffs. This is regarding Girardi's entire career with the Rangers or at least the last several seasons.
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Wed Jun 3 22:53:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think Girardi is the piece that needs to be traded to put this team over the top. Regardless of all the Corsi talk and advanced stats here. The Rangers biggest problem in the playoffs has consistently been offensive performances in the playoffs. Gaborik's production dropped in the playoffs. Nash's performance does as well. We have no Getzlaf, Perry, Johnson, Stamkos, Toews or Kane to put up big numbers in the post season. Nash could be that guy if he wasn't the team's only weapon.  Again, Girardi's stats might not look great when you look at advanced stats but fans, Coaches, and the GM of the team dont' see those advanced stats. They see a beast of a d-man who is usually never caught out of position.   I think this is reaching and grasping for straws here. Its okay. I feel awful about the loss too. But I don't think trading G for another bottom feeding team's talented offensive player is going to help."
rangers,38figc,defiantgrit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:44:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, however you have to notice that defense generates offense.  If we can't get it out of our zone and give it away, how do you plan to have offense?  Imo, Staal and Girardi extremely lackluster this playoffs"
rangers,38figc,Tiipster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:25:52 2015 UTC,"Staal and Girardi with surgery to their ankles. The foundation for playing hockey is in your lower body, being able to skate effectively. They were injured for who knows how long. THat's probably why they had lackluster playoffs."
rangers,38figc,defiantgrit,0,Sun Jun 7 04:29:41 2015 UTC,"As I posted earlier, you cannot generate sustained offensive pressure if your defense is poor and you're getting stuck in your zone. Girardi is terrible at moving the puck up ice both in terms of breakout passes and carrying the puck into the opposition's zone. I feel like more people need to realize that offense and defense aren't as dichotomous as y'all think. You need good puck movement to generate good offense and good puck movement largely comes from having defensemen that can start breakouts or lead attacks via zone entries. Note how both Chicago and Tampa have elite puck moving defensemen on their top pairings (Keith, Stralman, Hedman).    And yeah coaches and GMs don't always see analytics stats, which is why so many teams passed on Stralman until he fell into Tampa's lap and now he's one of their best players. Weird how that works out.    Nash finished 2nd on the team in points with the same fucking number of points in the conference finals as Pat Kane and Steven Stamkos. He's not he problem. Brassard had a strong postseason too. Even when he wasn't scoring he wasn't actively bringing the team down the way Girardi does (which, hey, is addressed in this post). I'm not even saying we need more talent as a reason for trading Girardi so much as the fact that we're about to be in cap hell and I'd rather not see the Rangers pay $5.5 M for someone with the skill set of a bottom pairing defenseman."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:32:15 2015 UTC,"If the Rangers don't resign Marty there is room for everyone under the cap. Even after next season because then Boyle comes off the cap and they can bring up Skjei to fill in at an entry level contract. If Miller and Fast improve, Boyle's salary coming off the cap means they can both get decent deals.   Again, this game 7 loss isn't on the shoulders of any one player. Its on the entire team being bit by the injury bug. 3 of our best defensemen were injured with lower extremity injuries when the foundation for hockey is skating. That's going to cause some problems with every aspect of their game.  Trading G or Staal, again, ins't putting this team over the top. Its actually putting them at a detriment."
rangers,38figc,defiantgrit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"Trading G doesn't exactly improve the team but it certainly relieves the cap crunch the team is in, in what is likely the least detrimental move to relieve the cap crunch. Think about it, who else could the Rangers move that has a big cap hit? Moving almost any player that to fix the rangers' cap situation would probably hurt the team except Girardi or Klein, who, at least in the case of Girardi in this post, have been shown to be statistically not worth their cap hits."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"Again, MSL retires or isn't resigned the cap crunch doesn't hurt as bad. No UFAs this season the team wants to re-sign. Stepan is going to get a upgrade to not sit out too long RFA but that will be part of Marty's money. The rest of it will be bridge deals for Fast, Miller and Hagelin.   Once those bridge deals expire, if Fast, Hagelin and Miller have great seasons and the team wins it all? Well guess what? Boyle is going to come off the cap, and that 4.5 million Boyle was making can be redistributed to Fast and Miller to re-sign them for what they're worth at that point in time. I doubt either of them are going to be worth more than 2-3 million per season after next season unless they both jump offensively considerably. Hagelin might ask for 3 in RFA and maybe get 2.5 as a bridge deal and 3 once Boyle is off the books.   Also remember too they can trade Talbot for a pick or prospect that has a two way entry level deal. That's another 1.45 of wiggle room."
rangers,38figc,defiantgrit,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:03:41 2015 UTC,"Or, we can let MSL retire and also clear out $8.4M in overpaid defensemen. I just don't see why we shouldn't considering that we can bring in Hunwick, who's an excellent 3rd pairing defensemen, and Skjei, who has a very high ceiling as far as potential skill and is expected to be NHL ready next season. That just gives us so much more maneuverability in terms of cap space for re-signing Hags, Miller and Fast or potentially even adding another player."
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:31:30 2015 UTC,After you re-sign those three guys who are you going to add that's going to be the difference maker though?

Stats show what you want them to show.   Stats are there for you to manipulate them. He only uses 5 years with of data. He compares Girardi to players who aren't too pairings. Stats aren't false but they can lie. It's good analysis but that doesn't mean it's not bias.
rangers,38figc,jedimasterchief,2,Thu Jun 4 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Ok so show me some stats that suggest that Girardi is a top pairing defenseman if they're so easy to manipulate. Also you say this like 5 years is a short amount of time. That's quite a lot of games to get data from, not to mention it's more relevant and recent data.  Also, as he mentions lower down on the post, quality of competition doesn't have a significant impact on corsi or fenwick or other analytical stats"
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:17:12 2015 UTC,He didn't include zone starts.  Why?  Because G's zone start percentage is among the toughest in the NHL.  That is bias.
rangers,38figc,Mophideus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:56:28 2015 UTC,Actually later on in the thread he points out that he doesn't feel that zone starts play a major role in affecting corsi. For example Girardi's zone starts were more favorable last season and his corsi was worse. Obviously that's a small sample size and someone would need to do a more detailed analysis but I'm not sure zone starts play as big of a role as some people think.
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Fri Jun 5 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"Girardi is a warrior but he's also a fucking fraud. He's not good whatsoever and once the average hockey fan can understand why he isn't good, then maybe Glen Sather will too."

I completely agree Girardi stinks, but I do think he's an NHL defenseman. The main issue is his contract. If he were making, say, $ 2.5 MM a year, it'd be different. At his current salary, it's a nightmare."
rangers,38figc,MetsBBT,-1,Wed Jun 3 23:13:04 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think it's harsh since it's mostly objective evidence, but I totally agree about the contract thing.

rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I just think there might be some hyperbole at the end, even though the assessment is pretty accurate.   All in all, he's the type of guy you want to shelter at all costs, yet he's the Rangers' ""number two"" defenseman. Welp."
rangers,38figc,MetsBBT,0,Wed Jun 3 23:27:28 2015 UTC,Agreed that the poster let his emotion run a little rampant at the end - but it almost kind of makes all of the analysis hit home. You know that the reason he's so upset is that this guy is truly a die hard NYR fan and it pains him (as it does me) that G occupies such a lofty place in fans and management's hearts when in reality players of his ilk have been figuratively (and sometimes literally) booed off other teams' rosters.
rangers,38figc,MetsBBT,2,Wed Jun 3 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"100%. Funny how a guy like G gets the benefit of the doubt all the time, despite his poor play. For the money he's making relative to his performance, he deserves Glass-esque criticism. I get that he's made great contributions in the past (i.e. his stellar '11-12 campaign), but it's time for the fans (and management, too, if they haven't already) to realize he's not what he used to be. It sucks that it's come to this, but this is a meritocracy. Results speak for themselves."
rangers,38figc,MikeyRage,2,Wed Jun 3 23:51:36 2015 UTC,"Girardi is an average defenseman who knows how to block shots and works hard.  I wish he was better at moving up the ice, I really do, he would be a much better player then his is now.  Also he needs to stop with his fucking snowangel bullshit.  Him and Klein both get penned in our own end more often then not but this makes it infinitely worse."
rangers,38figc,m4tuna,3,Thu Jun 4 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"That's cool, where do blocked shots factor in here? How could these be called advanced stats if they don't account for all things D men are counted on to do?"
rangers,38figc,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Wed Jun 3 23:20:28 2015 UTC,Blocked shots are factored into Corsi but not Fenwick. So I think if his shot blocking made a big difference his Fenwick would be decent since Corsi counts blocks as a scoring chance against.
rangers,38figc,jedimasterchief,-2,Wed Jun 3 23:41:10 2015 UTC,The basic summary of this is that the shots he generally blocks are not super important and that the shots he lets by are highly dangerous compared to many other defensemen in the league right now. That's a rough combination to have pinned on you as a defensive defenseman.
rangers,38figc,Mac-Truck27,5,Wed Jun 3 23:44:27 2015 UTC,How did you determine the blocked shots are unimportant?

Also the grain of salt is cause these number mean nothing to me cause I don't know dick about advanced stats but they look damning and I'll be watching G more closely next season.

rangers,38figc,jedimasterchief,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:58:40 2015 UTC,"Now, let me start off by saying that I don't 100% follow or comprehend all of these stats. I tried, but just couldn't keep up with it at times. That being said, here's my opinion based on what I did understand vs watching things as a fan over the years he's been here...    The stats here say he isn't elite and I agree with that, in general. In my opinion he's missing a few pieces that hold him back from that level, like quickly getting the puck out of the D zone, speed in general, and offensive production.  In today's NHL, if you're not scoring 30-40 pts a season as a blue liner you're never going to make the top defenders list. Look at Karlsson, Doughty, Weber, Keith, Subban, etc. Those guys pile on the points and play solid defense for the most part. G will never posses the scoring touch or speed those guys have.  He's a throwback defender, built to block shots and be physically solid.  All of that means his salary is too high based on what we really need for a 1st line Dman.  However, as black and white as stats are, there's some parts of the equation that don't fit, based on these analytical formulas and projections. Specifically, if G is so terrible, and Staal hasn't been elite, and Klein ranked below him once or twice in some categories; then how are we not giving up 4-5 goals a game, and how are we scoring 3+ goals per game on average this season?  We had the 3rd best goals per game average, and if we look at which Dmen were on the ice for those goals, I just can't believe that Boyle/Yandle or Mac (our best offensive Dmen) were the only defenders contributing to goals being scored. They all put up solid point totals, but each one also was susceptible on Defense this year. So a lot of what they brought offensively would've been stifled by their lapses on Defense. And yet we still scored a LOT of goals and kept a lot out. And had the best record. That means we were playing solid D and scoring no matter who was on the ice. If we look at our 3 more defensive Dmen (G, Staal, and Klein - despite his breakout year), I think it can generally be said that they all had solid defensive performances. We averaged about 3 goals a game, and won more than anyone. So that means that we frequently held the opposition to < 3 goals. Hank/Talbs had a lot to do with that, but it also means we had some incredibly timely defending. Given G leads the team in minutes, that means we can focus on him for a good glance at how we performed defensively. And despite what the stats say, we had an excellent regular season, being the best team. And in the 1st/2nd rounds we were largely magnificent on defense. We only began to struggle to stop goals vs Tampa, who was one of only two teams to score more than we did during the season (so that seems to make some sense). And even though we struggled defensively that series, we scored a lot to stay in it. And let's not forget that G was a +5 and had 4 assists these playoffs (and in my opinion was the MVP of the Pens series).  Just for shits, I compared his +/- for the past 5 years to the Norris Trophy winners (leaving out Lidstrom since he retired 4 years ago), and it turns out G (+27) is only behind Keith (+65) and Subban (+30).  He's significantly higher than both Doughty and Karlsson.  Not that he should win the Norris Trophy, but I bring this up as an example that stats can be used to tell any kind of story you want.  If we're looking at advanced stats, G seems pretty poor, but in the more well known stats, he seems pretty great.  At the end of the day, winning the Division, Conference, and President's Trophy, then going through two rounds, giving up only 20 goals in 12 games (1.67 goals given up/game) speaks volumes to the defense we had, which G was a main cog of.  Even if you include the Bolts series, we gave up 41 Goals in 19 games, for a 2.16 GAA.  That's would've put us at #1 for the Regular season.  Obviously the Cup was not won and so I'm not saying it was a successful year, but I can't look at the defense, specifically G, and say they performed poorly.  Our offense sputtered in the playoffs and didn't find it's feet until we were under the gun, which ultimately was the main reason we lost.  I really appreciate the thoroughness of the article and all the discussion. And I generally agree that G is making too much money and is not elite. However, the regular season performance and 2/3 rounds of playoffs tell me that our defense played better than we give them credit for over the course of the year. And when G leads in minutes, we're looking heavily in his direction. So in the end, I don't think letting him go would be a good idea, despite advanced stats.  Thanks for the discussion!!"

rangers,38c5j5,MikeyRage,4,Wed Jun 3 07:12:57 2015 UTC,"I've had high hopes for Dylan ever since we drafted him ahead of Fowler back in 2010. It's been a long time coming, but between all of his injuries and projected time-table, it was somewhat expected. I never expected him to become a top 2 D, but reading this brings back a little hope that he can still become an effective NHL defenseman...and hopefully sooner rather than later."
rangers,38c5j5,booshyschmoozy,4,Wed Jun 3 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"""There's a heart and soul guy,"" Gernander said of McIlrath. ""If you watched the way he finished the game, finished the season, he has made great progress. He played hard right to the end, some big hits, and they were all clean. He certainly was a presence, someone to be dealt with, in all three series with his physical play. But he didn't take himself out of position.""   I'm not sure if his work ethic was ever in question, but it's great to hear he's making clean hits and smart decisions. That's definitely progress.  The big question remaining is, at the NHL level, has the game changed too much for a player like him to still have a role? And I don't mean just on the Rangers."

rangers,38c5j5,JKaye57,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:34:55 2015 UTC,McIlrath will be an interesting story this postseason.  He loses waivers eligibility.  Is he included in a trade?  Do they Rangers trade someone else and give him a shot?  Does he make it as the 7th?  He's essentially exactly the archetype of D-man the Rangers need but can he actually play D up to snuff in the NHL?  Will be interesting for sure.

rangers,38as4q,domn8r2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:08:26 2015 UTC,"I can somewhat see their reasoning.   the small sample of Talbot's play during a time when it helped the Rangers towards a playoff push. Talbot will 28 next season and Hank will be 34 in March. A fear of Hank declining as he gets older, and dumping him now while he has value. Maybe some idea that Lundqvist/Talbot situation is like a Vanbiesbrouck/Richter situation. Where the older (but not as old as Lundqvist) was traded to let the (slightly) younger goalie start. Both however went on to lead their teams to Stanley Cups, one of them won the cup.   I would rather trade Talbot, probably get more value. I have no problems with Lundqvist play and think he can play his type of game for the next five years. (assuming he doesn't break down with an injury)"

Someone with the voice of reason needs to be heard loud and clear over the exhaustive din of knee jerk reactionary fans that start following the team in late March. Hearing you scream actual logic in my head as i read it was comforting and vindicating for the passionate feelings i have about this hockey team. This team does not need a major overhaul. It needs a few tweaks in support roles. And perhaps Sather works his magic in the summer and gets a defenseman or forward in that truly can elevate the caliber of overall play.  And lastly, just some positive karma coming the team's way when it counts. A few generous bounces, a few less non-existent off sides calls, and above all - the ability to stay as healthy as possible. I'm done mourning and sulking. I did my share. It's warpath time now. Lets start the long march back up the mountain."

rangers,38as4q,thataznguy34,6,Wed Jun 3 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"He has done very well for himself in the playoffs, no one is debating that. He definitely came through in his limited role when crunch time rolled around, HOWEVER, look on the sidebar to see how much he's costing us. 1.45 MILLION! Look at the other players that are solid 4th liners on the Rangers. Fast: 805k, Miller: 894k, Shep: 1.3 mil, Moore: 1.5 mil. Moore is our #1 faceoff man BY FAR (which is another issue the Rangers have to address), and Shep can at least win faceoffs as he came in as a center and was ~50%+ in the faceoff circle before he came to us. They offer us SO MUCH MORE than Glass and Glass is making more than all of them except Moore and that's only by a narrow 500k margin.   TLDR: He was solid in the playoffs but WAY overpaid. If he cost 900k a season, then probably keep, but at $1.45 million he doesn't fit into a cap crunched team. Keep in mind this doesn't even factor in the abomination of a regular season he had (and has had his entire career)."
rangers,38as4q,mantiseye,2,Wed Jun 3 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"Fast and Miller are likely to make more next year, probably 1 - 1.5m each.

rangers,38as4q,F_urOpinion,3,Wed Jun 3 08:22:20 2015 UTC,"He's not very good, that's why. Our 4th line this year was significantly worse offensively, defensively, and possession wise this year. He was a constant of the 4th line, scored only 1 goal in his last 121 NHL games, and was just flat out our worst forward while there were better options all season (Stempniak, Duclair, Lindberg, Bourque, Sheppard), so that's probably why."

Shep showed great passion after coming into the team late, and Glass started very poor but kept getting better.  By the end of the playoffs he was one of our most consistent players.  Really liked what I saw.    For the dumps, Boyler and MSL are great guys, but are aging out of consistency, and can cost us games easily.  I've already said a lot about Hags in two other threads, but to sum it up: he isn't good at breakaways or shooting in general, and with his speed he should be much better.  <40 points a season is not worth the $3mil he'll most likely ask for, so I say we dump him.

rangers,388g5r,RegulatorRWF,8,Tue Jun 2 16:44:22 2015 UTC,I don't think Skapski's recovery will have any impact on Clambot. Skapski wouldn't be the backup next season anyway -- he's too young and should continue developing as a starter in the AHL.
rangers,388g5r,JKaye57,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:26:08 2015 UTC,Assuming we hold on to Talbot we'll probably have Halverson or Shestyorkin groomed for backup over Skapski. Both look much more promising.

Is Igor spending another year in Russia? Halverson the OHL? With Skapski being 20 (turning 21 this month), none of the three are ideal to be backups right now.   If we trade Talbot, I'd rather we have a vet to bring in to be Hanks' backup. Yann Danis played well in the AHL, not someone I'd call ideal but someone I'd rather have on the bench than any one of the three kids. Those three have to be playing, they have to develop. They shouldn't be close to being Hank's backup for another few seasons."
rangers,388g5r,JKaye57,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"No definitely not, I just don't think Skapski is going to see the big show full time as a Ranger - by the time he's really poised for that spot, Halverson or Shestyorkin probably will be as well."

When he's ""slightly off,"" he's vilified. When he's the best player on the ice, there isn't a single mention of him.   Girardi was one of the best defenseman on the ice in the Pittsburgh and Caps series. His performance may have suffered against TB - but he was playing injured."

rangers,388zqg,sleipe,3,Wed Jun 3 01:27:14 2015 UTC,"This is completely false. Girardi was killed during the entire playoff run. He allowed the most shot attempts per 60min and the most high danger scoring chances per 60min in the playoffs out of all NYR defensemen. He had a horrible playoff year last year, had a bad regular season, and once again had a horrible playoff year. BSB doesn't have it out for Girardi, they just talk about how bad he's been because he's been bad."
rangers,388zqg,F_urOpinion,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:53:12 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. He was a lockdown defenseman in the Pens and Caps series. He was noticeable (in a good way) on nearly every shift.   While I enjoy BSB, they are biased against Girardi. It all started with his contract, which got worse when we didn't re-sign Stralman.   I also find it funny that BSB will flat out ignore Nash's stats through 2/3 of the playoffs and just tell us ""he's doing all the right things - he's noticeable."" Meanwhile, Girardi can be rock-solid during a game but if he were to sit awkwardly on the bench, they would start their threads with, ""Did you see Girardi on the bench? For $5 million, you have to sit better than that."" And then the circle-jerk begins.   I have little use for fancy-stats when I understand what I see from a player day in and day out. If I had to bet, Dan Boyle had better fancy-stats than Girardi. That's still won't convince me that Boyle didn't look overmatched and out of place during most of the playoff. Girardi didn't."

Nash did play well these playoffs, did he score like we needed? No, but the Rangers were far better with him on the ice opposed to Girardi. Not to mention, Nash's offensive and defensive value is worth so much more than Girardi.   If you seriously can't see how Girardi was completely overmatched in the playoffs, then you're being completely biased, ignoring the numbers which show you're completely wrong, and really aren't that knowledgeable with hockey.   Also, Boyle was decent, he's not the best in the defensive zone, but 6 goals, 10 points, 19 playoff games. Girardi didn't come CLOSE to that production."
rangers,388zqg,F_urOpinion,0,Fri Jun 5 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"Which ""stats"" are you talking about them ignoring with Nash? You mean the stats where he had the same number of points in the conference finals as Stamkos and Kane? Or the stats where he finished second on the team in points? Or the stats where he led all Rangers forwards in shot attempts?    Also did you read any of this article? They pretty clearly state that Boyle had better advanced stats than Girardi. If you don't think Girardi looked outmatched and out of place during the playoffs then lololol."

rangers,388zqg,F_urOpinion,0,Fri Jun 5 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Like I have nothing against the guy, he was great in 2012. I know he'd saw his own leg off to help this team, but he's not worth a $5.5 M cap hit in any universe."

rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Fri Jun 5 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"I say this all over the place here. It was definitely Vatanan and likely a pick or prospect. Make that trade, keep Stralman, no doubt we're in the finals."

He made multiple gaffes, was soft on the puck and do not get me started on his board-play decision in Game 1 against the Capitals.   Were his fancy stats better than Girardi? Possibly. But however he was playing, he was clearly targeted by the opposition as weak."
rangers,388zqg,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:51:19 2015 UTC,Here's a pretty comprehensive read on everything Girardi does wrong    Spoiler: it's a lot
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Wed Jun 3 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"yeah I definitely agree that Klein didn't play well. Sucks that he never returned to the ""optimus klein"" form that we saw in the regular season. I don't really agree about girardi tho. He was playing hurt and often goes up against top guys. I thought he played well."
rangers,388zqg,freegucciburr,2,Tue Jun 2 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately a lot of Klein's apparent success in the beginning of the regular season was a result of him shooting at like triple the league average in shooting percentage. I don't dislike him, I just wish we weren't paying $3m for basically a bottom pairing defenseman."
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Tue Jun 2 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't completely give up on him just because of a bad 2 playoff series where he never really got the chance to get back up to speed. It wasn't just good shooting which made him good earlier, it was great skating which allowed him to join the rush and even forecheck while being able to get back into position. He's far from a lost cause and could still prove to be worth 2.9mill with the price of defenceman in today's NHL."
rangers,388zqg,Itscominrightforus,3,Tue Jun 2 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think the bigger problem is not whether or not he's good but whether they can afford to pay a third pairing defenseman $2.9M a season, and I don't think they can with how tight the cap is. The smart move IMO, if he's ready (and by all accounts he is), they move Klein and bring up Brady Skjei to replace him."
rangers,388zqg,Blitz93,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"By all accounts Skjei was unimpressive for the last two years at Minnesota. Everyone heard one Mcdonagh comparison and jumped on the hype train but the kid is gonna need quite a bit of seasoning down in the minors. McIlrath is a lost cause. Bodie may be an option but who knows. Defenceman cost a lot in today's NHL and while Klein didn't play great he still has #4 dman potential, that isn't thrown out because of 3 weeks of bad play coming back from a 6 week injury. People are kidding themselves if they think we can find someone better."
rangers,388zqg,Itscominrightforus,3,Wed Jun 3 02:37:52 2015 UTC,"It's not about finding someone better, it's paying a third pair defenseman nearly $3M. He's not unseating anybody in the top 4. And even if Skjei isn't ready (and your ""by all accounts"" is nonsense, I've read a TON of scouting reports that claim he's ready, not to mention many top NYR guys believe he is as well), with the tight cap space and other spots to fill as well as pay their RFAs they do not have the luxury of keeping Klein."
rangers,388zqg,Blitz93,3,Wed Jun 3 03:17:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with ya man. Sign Skjei to an entry level 900k contract and that gives us 2 mil towards the cap. This gives us that cheap bottom D pairing but removes the option to move that D up to the 2nd pairing. Frankly, I'm OK with this. I like Klein, but he isn't exactly cheap for a bottom pair."
rangers,388zqg,thataznguy34,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"Thats what #5 dmen cost now. Go look at the caps, ducks, habs, blues or lightning. They're all paying their 5th dman Klein money. Is it ideal for any team? Obviously not but just about every team is doing it because thats what it costs. If Klein's contract is such an albatross who would take it anyways?"
rangers,388zqg,Itscominrightforus,2,Wed Jun 3 03:54:18 2015 UTC,All three teams are projected to have significantly more cap space than the Rangers this year. That's why it's a luxury to have an expensive third line defensemen. The way this team is constructed they desperately need some guys on rookie contracts and the way to do that is pushing out guys like Klein and bring in guys like Skjei and Lindberg.
rangers,388zqg,Blitz93,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"Gonna just repeat that Matt Hunwick has a $600,000 cap hit and was can pretty much play better defense than Klein"
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"You're talking about Klein's last 14 games, not his first 65. He was a significantly better player than Hunwick during the regular season."
rangers,388zqg,Itscominrightforus,2,Wed Jun 3 05:10:57 2015 UTC,"No I'm talking about the whole season. People seem to love Klein because he had a stretch of absurdly high shooting percentage which resulted in a bunch of points at the start of the season. Hunwick is just as good, if not better, at shot suppression. And again at a fraction of the price. Klein isn't irreplaceable."
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Wed Jun 3 05:14:52 2015 UTC,Matt Hunwick is making far less money and was better in the playoffs and just as good in the regular season
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:07:13 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with his scoring. He was one of our best defensive defensemen when he got hurt. I don't think he adjusted well from not playing at all to being thrown into the playoffs.
rangers,388zqg,dakraiz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:38:32 2015 UTC,"His scoring endeared him with a great deal of this fanbase, which kind of skewed a lot of people's perceptions"
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,8,Sat Jun 6 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"This is considered sacrilege around these parts, and no doubt I will get downvoted, but please hear me out... Girardi has been overrated for several years. He can do a good job in a certain style. In particular, the Washington Capitals series (i.e., the Rangers style circa 2012) was really well suited to his abilities.  It is a methodical game style -- Girardi's job was to play man to man against Ovechkin. He didn't have to move the puck or go north-south, because the game was plodding.  When he gets in against a fast team, he treats the puck like a hot potato.  The half ice dump from the d-zone into the neutral zone does nothing for possession. Rather, it gives the defense a 10-second respite and, in the 1st and 3rd, a chance to change lines. This is why the Rangers struggle so much in the 2nd period.  Occasionally this hot potato treatment leads to a bad turnover. (Exhibit A: LA Kings overtime goal in SCF 2014).  Fans like to say Stralman's money went to Boyle. In truth, Boyle was a short term contract and Stralman wanted several more years. The Rangers locked up Girardi for several more years and did so instead of Stralman. That's why Stralman never really got an offer. The decision had been made a year earlier with Girardi's contract, and in my opinion, it was a mistake that cost us the Eastern Conference."
rangers,388zqg,nylawman21,5,Tue Jun 2 21:43:11 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely right. He's great against slower, physical, checking teams but against teams like Tampa or the Isles he's typically one of the worst players on the ice."
rangers,388zqg,Blitz93,3,Wed Jun 3 00:15:55 2015 UTC,And with more teams building towards speed and puck possession I think it's only gonna get worse with him.
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:27:04 2015 UTC,The speed style I say split mac and g up and move g down to second pairing. That was my opinion the whole Tampa series
rangers,388zqg,xxdarksyde73xx,3,Wed Jun 3 04:10:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. Yandle+McD would've worked well IMO. Oh well. Can't live in the past.
rangers,388zqg,josephnicklo,2,Wed Jun 3 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"Oof, Yandle against the top offensive line is a bad idea. He's okay defensively, but he mostly seems to get by with marginal interference and some luck."
rangers,388zqg,mantiseye,2,Wed Jun 3 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"Or, ya know, just not play G and roll out a defense where everybody can deal with speed."
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,0,Wed Jun 3 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"Brace yourself for a lot of negative responses, but this article is right. Klein was flat out terrible for the entire playoffs and wasn't nearly as good in the regular season as people make him out to be.    Though I'm not a fan of arguing that the defensemen are payed to play a certain way. Idk I just feel like players are paid to be good, not play a specific way or generate a specific stat."
rangers,388zqg,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Tue Jun 2 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"Correct, I don't like Adam, but he's spot on in this entire article. Girardi and Klein just flat out aren't very good and make way too much money for their production and role."
rangers,38865p,_TheConsumer_,17,Tue Jun 2 15:19:29 2015 UTC,You should use save% instead of gaa. I agree though that a goalie's prime is longer especially if a lot of the success is technique and not just pure athletic ability.
rangers,38865p,MFitz24,6,Tue Jun 2 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"Nice suggestion- when I have a chance, I'll add it in an edit."
rangers,38865p,rcn85,2,Tue Jun 2 15:41:52 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Always felt save % was a better metric than GAA.
rangers,38865p,thisaintnogame,0,Tue Jun 2 20:58:25 2015 UTC,"If we really wanted to get all statistical, we should also adjust for the times that these goalies played in. Hasek and Roy finished out their careers during the dead puck era of the late 90's early/ early 2000's. This probably would have deflated their goals against and inflated their save percentages. So these numbers might be a little optimistic (just in terms of measuring these other goalies).   That being said, Hank will be winning Vezinas through his 40's. :-)"
rangers,38865p,Ben_Ulrand,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I thought along similar lines - just haven't figured out a method to make a proper comparison to modern era.   Also, a deeper analysis should evaluate total team make up. For example, the Devils and the Red Wings utilized some form of the trap defense - which would limit offensive opportunities, making their goalies ""look better.""  The Avalanche were built, more or less, as an offense first team. This would/could put their own goalie under more stress.   The only thing that makes me feel Hank's future numbers aren't optimistic is that they basically fall in line with his current career averages. The analysis of the other goalies showed that there is negligible erosion of skill approaching 40. So, it's not totally unreasonable to expect ~8 more years of Hank being an elite goalie."
rangers,38865p,nylawman21,9,Wed Jun 3 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Good post.  For me the ""window"" isn't really for Hank, rather the whole team - or the core group - right now.  I think the Rangers need to win a Cup in the next 1-3 years max before they have to overhaul and rebuild.    It's not unconscionable to see Hank go to a contending team if things are going south after that window.  The man is loyal to the organization but is a competitor above all else.  But another point that gives me hope is that Tim Thomas was 37 when he won with Boston, and he was playing some of his best hockey.  Considering how consistent Henrik is, providing he stays healthy, I don't doubt he'll be playing just as well at that age"
rangers,38865p,kmort,5,Tue Jun 2 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"Great post. Goaltending is so mental and, more than any other position, based on concentration and hockey IQ more than athleticism.  When you factor in his reputation for staying in great shape, if all goes well, Hank could continue playing at a very high level through the end of his contract. Let's hope he does."
rangers,38865p,darkeagle91,4,Tue Jun 2 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"Should also note what styles these goalies played, Brodeur was so durable because he played a stand-up style which is very forgiving on the body vs Henrik & Roy who are butterfly and takes a bigger toll on the body. Not sure about Hasek though."
rangers,38865p,kevinjamesfan_6,7,Tue Jun 2 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"Henriks not really a butterfly goalie, that might be his closest comparison but if you compare his style to Holtby or Price, Henrik plays a more hybrid/unconventional style, staying further back with higher hands, showing a larger 5 hole, and gambling his reflexes are good enough to make up for it.   His unbelievable instinct/reflexes have made him one of the best in the world, but if those deteriorate with age it's cause for concern at the very least. I think that's why is age is being discussed earlier than most goalies."
rangers,38865p,josephnicklo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:32:29 2015 UTC,"his knees and hips will most likely not last that long given that he goes down into the butterfly for almost every shot he sees. the reflexes will go eventually to an extent, but i'd be more worried about his body holding up"

He frequently fluffs on breakaways, and has the second worst shooting percentage of any forward, only bettering Dom and Glass.  Kredier has that insane speed, size, and has scored more in both the regular season (by 15 points) and post season (by 5pts) than Hags.  And Kreids is at 2.475mil.  There's no way anyone can convince me that Hags is worth 3.2-3.4 mil/year.    I love him, and think he gels perfectly with the team, and has incredible speed.

rangers,388bak,blueshirtdave,5,Tue Jun 2 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"You're looking at point production as the only factor in salary.....  So Hags actually puts up slightly more than 50% of Toews production. Is he worth 50% of the $10.5M Toews is set to make....fuck no. Not all players should be judged monetarily on their Goals and Assists, intangibles are real and should be taken into consideration.       Dorsett just got a 4 year - $2.65 AAV extension, by your rationalization he would be worth more/same as Hagelin."
rangers,388bak,colin6,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to judge on point production alone, which is why I brought up his poor breakaways and low shooting percentage.  That may be only two areas, but for someone who can create space with speed as he can, they would be two of the primary areas he should be fantastic in, but he's not.  If you can outskate the defenders, you should have time to make a better move on a breakaway, and get a much better look at the goal for your shots. He's quite poor at both.    As for Dorsett, he DOES the things he is supposed to do quite well.  He's a physical player, takes the necessary PIMs, and gets in the head of the opposition.  Scoring 25 pts last year was icing on the cake.  I would say he definitely does deserve a bit more than he receives currently if we're looking at recent performances.  But that's another team, and different expectations.  Not to mention a different style of player on a different line.  Hags is not great at the things he's supposed to be good at.  So why would we reward him for it?  He's currently making almost what Dorsett's extension will be, and you're saying he should be at 1 million more.  That's the part I don't understand.    I'm not asking to be a jerk, I'm literally asking because I'm curious... what are you seeing in the past year or two (let's say), that proves he's worth more than $3mil/year?"
rangers,388bak,blueshirtdave,4,Tue Jun 2 17:29:24 2015 UTC,I'll back you up here. I love Hags I dig what he brings to the team. But while his speed is blinding he does struggle to finish.  I look at Hagelin like a borderline 3rd/4th liner. He's a predominantly defensive guy whose speed creates chances. I personally agree with you that 3 mil+ is steep for his services especially considering the Cap situation and who we'll need to resign in the near future.

rangers,388bak,PragmaticNewYorker,7,Tue Jun 2 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"Hagelin.  We love the guy, but he's going to command way more money than he really should be paid, and of the three, he's the most replaceable. Fast is cheap, effective and won't make more than 1.5 or so. Miller is blossoming and might get 2.3 for a few years. Hagelin's going to need/want 3.5 or so, and we'd need to buy UFA years.  He's easy enough to replace with our farm system - perhaps not his speed, but his tenacity, grind play and defensive acumen can be plugged from below."
rangers,388bak,jeanzus,4,Tue Jun 2 15:56:42 2015 UTC,the way hags played tho... one of the b est on the team
rangers,388bak,Rowan94,-10,Tue Jun 2 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"was invisible this playoffs; most of our team was, but he seemed to be just skating around"
rangers,388bak,blueshirtdave,13,Tue Jun 2 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"He may not have scored/assisted much, but he was definitely a factor in the foreheck as well PK."
rangers,388bak,mexicaaaan,5,Tue Jun 2 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly 100% disagree with you there.  Our PK for the playoffs was 80%, which was in the bottom half of the teams.  We scored 0 short-handed goals, and Hags had a 5.6% shooting percentage, good for 4th from the bottom of the list on our team (forwards).  And that's on 36 shots total for the playoffs, so he had that game winner and that's about it.  For someone that can create space with his speed and skills, that's not acceptable.  Bottom line is that aside from the game winner against the Pens, he was pretty poor these playoffs.  Did I mention that he was a -4, which was 3rd worst on the team?    Again, I love the guy and think he fits perfectly on the team.  I also think that what he's being paid right now is more than fair, based on what he brings."
rangers,388bak,blueshirtdave,-2,Tue Jun 2 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"Our PK for the playoffs was 80%, which was in the bottom half of the teams.

And that's on 36 shots total for the playoffs, so he had that game winner and that's about it.   I wasn't aware Hags was our only player on the PK. You did notice he was playing on the same line as MSL - who according to this sub ruins everything, right?"
rangers,388bak,mexicaaaan,2,Tue Jun 2 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"Of course there were others, but it was suggested that his play contributed to a successful PK, which I'd disagree with"
rangers,388bak,blueshirtdave,-2,Wed Jun 3 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"Well you probably aren't great with statistics if you think the general PK% is representative of his contribution, but then again given the rest of your posting... I wonder what you do notice from the game."
rangers,388bak,mexicaaaan,3,Wed Jun 3 12:10:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks?  Not sure why you're taking the insulting route here. I simply provided a respectful difference in opinion, and you've twice given a snarky, insulting reply. However after reviewing YOUR post history and seeing that nearly every comment is insulting someone for their opinion, I'll just end it here. You can have all the internet points for this one sir. Good day."
rangers,388bak,anesqguy,-2,Wed Jun 3 23:39:57 2015 UTC,You can have all the internet points for this one sir   Yes! finally!  Having an opinion doesn't mean it's unfounded or not stupid. Citing the PK% as evidence of Hagelin not doing much on the PK seems to defy an understanding of statistics.
rangers,388bak,Ben_Ulrand,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"Pavel should be coming up this year and he can replace one of these wingers, thats why its almost 1000% one of them will get the axe. Hopefully a team like Edmonton or Buffalo doesnt throw money at Miller specifically, I think he will be a huge part of our team over next 3-4 years"
rangers,388bak,mantiseye,8,Tue Jun 2 15:59:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he signed another 1 year deal to stay in the KHL.
rangers,388bak,kmort,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"ahh yea, just saw this."
rangers,388bak,bu77munch,0,Tue Jun 2 16:12:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. Fast and Miller really proved their worth as prospects and are likely to improve next season.  Always liked Hagelin but he's not essential and can be replaced for less than what he'll ask for.
rangers,388bak,mantiseye,4,Tue Jun 2 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"Both Miller and Fast are RFAs without arbitration rights so they'll likely get one year at their qualifying offer (777k for Miller, 851k for Fast) or two year bridge deals for ~1.1m or so. I'd be surprised if both didn't come back because it's almost impossible to lose a RFA without arbitration as long as the team wants them back (and I can't imagine they don't).  Hags, however, does have arbitration, and his qualifying offer is 2.4m. I think both he and the team would like to make it happen but it might just not be possible with their cap space. He'd likely want like 2.8m or more. Even with the space freed up by MSL (who won't get 5.65m even if we do re-sign him) it's going to be tight because Step will probably get anywhere from 6m - 7m."
rangers,388bak,RhynoSorceress,2,Tue Jun 2 16:18:03 2015 UTC,Stepan will get a long term 5.5 deal mirroring Brassards.
rangers,388bak,xLeonex,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:19:14 2015 UTC,I don't see steps getting 7. 6.5 max.
rangers,388bak,Tiipster,2,Tue Jun 2 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"I've seen speculation as high as 6.75 so I rounded up, but you're probably right. I'd be surprised if he even gets 6.5, but we'll see. It's not like we have anyone to replace him."
rangers,388bak,lionson76,2,Tue Jun 2 17:19:05 2015 UTC,If we don't bring back MSL (we shouldn't) then there's no reason to believe that all the RFA's will be back next season. Step and Hags will be costly but Miller and Fast will be signed for cheap 2 year deals.
rangers,388bak,Friscalating123,2,Tue Jun 2 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's Hagelin as well. With all that speed, he really doesn't finish as much as he should. He would have broken out by now in terms of points so I don't see it happening."
rangers,388bak,xLeonex,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"agree, we dont need every player on our team to be the fastest on the ice, swap hagelin with a bruiser/grinder kind of player like a Ladd/Callahan guy it would be much better"
rangers,388bak,Friscalating123,2,Tue Jun 2 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Speed is the game atm.  You have to be fast to win in the most recent years.  That's why we got Yandle, someone who can be offensive and be able to move the puck down the ice fast at the back end.  We need people who flourish in high-speed games."
rangers,388bak,Tiipster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't know about that... Both conference finals were between four of the league's fastest teams.  Ladd or Cally would be great, but we're not turning Hags into one of those guys. Not for $3M."

rangers,388bak,lionson76,2,Fri Jun 5 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"Miller played absolutely unbelievable this playoffs. Really think he is underrated.  He will became a talent in a few years for sure.  Fast played well this playoffs too.  Hard decision, but I think Hags has got to go."
rangers,388bak,Friscalating123,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:54:35 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that none of them get moved. I liked what they all brought to the playoffs and they are all fairly young. I don't think MSL will be back unless it's a very cheap deal. I think his money will get distributed around and someone from the AHL will come up full time like Oscar. I think for a team that went so far last year you don't have much to gain by making big changes to the roster. At least you know what you have in all 3 of those guys. It all goes out the window though if Sather gets a good trade offer for any one of them.
rangers,388bak,Blitz93,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"This may be a dumb question, but what is the probability Stepan takes a contract comparable to Brassard's?   They are on par production wise, both regular season (barring a 15 point point difference) and playoff."
rangers,388bak,nazicumfarts,2,Tue Jun 2 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"i think it will be similiar, but a little higher, 4 years 22-23 mil or 5 years 27-28"
rangers,388bak,StonedArcticPenguin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"I suppose Hagelin is the most expendable, since he'll be the most expensive of the RFAs. But are we sure we can't keep all 3? Has anyone done the math? Let's just do the math right now... Jump in if you see anything way off.  The cap is going up to $71M next year, and according to this site, that means we'll have about $9-10M in space.  Let's say Step gets a $1.5-2M raise, and Miller and Fast each in get bridge deals in the $1.5M range:   Step $5.5-6M Miller $1.5M Fast $1.5M   That's $8.5-9M right there, with none of our UFAs returning - which includes Marty, Hunwick, and Shep. (Hunwick and Shep might be worth re-signing, but there's no way Marty is coming back. No way.)  Finally, Hags will probably be around $3M.  Hmm. So at best we only have half of that left in cap space. We'll need to check the sofa cushions to come up with the rest.  Cam will make $1.45M next year. That would cover the difference. Or ship out a couple of minor leaguers counting against the cap. We could use the draft picks, anyway.  Either way, it shouldn't be that hard to come find about $2M if we wanted to keep Hags... Right?"

rangers,388bak,colin6,0,Thu Jun 4 15:47:02 2015 UTC,Lose Fast....don't get rid of Hags. Hags fits into AV system perfectly and his speed alone is worth it.   Imagine if he learns to finish his breakaways and don't for get his OT winner against the Pens.

rangers,383lxq,berdman11,3,Mon Jun 1 17:24:26 2015 UTC,It makes everything else seem petty. Crazy.
rangers,383lxq,thehockeychimp,11,Mon Jun 1 18:11:34 2015 UTC,Just get healthy for next year and the future zucc. That's all I ask. LGR
rangers,383lxq,berdman11,6,Mon Jun 1 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"Wow. I don't even know what to say right now. I'm just grateful to know that he seems to be recovering well, especially if he travelled with the team and all. Hopefully there aren't any long term effects of this...wishing him a speedy and healthy recovery :(."
rangers,383lxq,sizeablescars,6,Mon Jun 1 17:15:46 2015 UTC,Silver Lining we didn't make the Cup is that he now has a full off season to heal.
rangers,383lxq,Shreeken,2,Mon Jun 1 18:04:17 2015 UTC,But what would he have been doing with us in the cup?
rangers,383lxq,wheelzr,7,Mon Jun 1 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe playing. My point is - we didn't potentially rush him back, which is definitely a good thing."
rangers,383lxq,azizinator25,-1,Mon Jun 1 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"That's idiotic, you don't know whether we'll ever get another chance like this at the cup, you exhaust every available resource to win the cup if you make it to the scf"
rangers,383lxq,puckinright,4,Tue Jun 2 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"A few days ago I heard from a friend in the organization that he had suffered stroke like symptoms, I didn't want to believe them but holy shit, that's so scary.."
rangers,383lxq,Maria513,3,Mon Jun 1 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Not going to link to it, but I had a post about the physics of a puck hitting somone's head and bouncing in the way that it did --meant that his head absorbed a direct blow....not a glancing one.   In all honesty, he's fortunate to be alive. Department of player safety should analyze how and why this injury occured and take action to keep a similar play from happening."
rangers,383lxq,lionson76,3,Mon Jun 1 19:47:42 2015 UTC,Expect to make a full recovery    is the only thing I really see. Get well soon Zucc <3
rangers,383lxq,Maria513,3,Mon Jun 1 21:18:35 2015 UTC,how is a brain contusion different from a concussion?
rangers,383lxq,jacybear,7,Mon Jun 1 17:23:41 2015 UTC,It's a concussion on the next level. More bruising/damage to the tissue itself.
rangers,383lxq,puckinright,3,Mon Jun 1 20:32:02 2015 UTC,"It's a concussion on the next level.   Kinda. Contusions are more immediately critical, but they are not a ""worse"" concussion. They're just different kinds of injuries with different consequences.  A contusion is a black and blue mark (bleeding and swelling) on the brain that can be spotted in scans. A concussion is an injury to brain cells themselves (no bleeding) that cannot immediately be seen.  A severe contusion can kill soon after the injury. A severe concussion won't kill by itself, but might permanently change the brain to make life a living hell, as we're slowly coming to realize through the deaths of so many recent athletes.  So they're both pretty serious, I'd say. One just more immediate than the other."

rangers,383lxq,ChelseaGRYN,2,Mon Jun 1 17:24:36 2015 UTC,awww jeez
rangers,383lxq,peterzlee,2,Mon Jun 1 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"Just read about it in in the Norwegian media. Couldn't speak and lost touch sense in arm and face for 4-5 days and had a hard time moving for 2 weeks. Shit, weren't just a concussion... Hope he gets well soon!"
rangers,383lxq,jedimasterchief,2,Mon Jun 1 18:12:19 2015 UTC,damnit that's scary...I want to give Zucc a huge hug
rangers,383lxq,mdrelich90,2,Mon Jun 1 21:41:59 2015 UTC,"Well it's a good thing Hobbits are resilient little bastards. He was struck with a morghul puck! where the fuck is Arwen when we needed her.  Sorry Zucc I miss you out there, if I could id give you my skull to use."
rangers,383lxq,dberti22,2,Mon Jun 1 22:42:11 2015 UTC,"Imagine that you are a world class athlete and suddenly not able to speak, lose arm functions while fully aware of what is happening to you and not knowing if you can fully recover... scary shit."
rangers,383lxq,ziggysmalls1,2,Tue Jun 2 01:28:15 2015 UTC,[Serious] what would have happened with our cap space and his salary if he became paralyzed?
rangers,383lxq,thehockeychimp,7,Mon Jun 1 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Same thing with the Flyers and Pronger. LTIR and the cap space comes free at that start of the season, I believe."

rangers,385o1l,illkwill,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:32:15 2015 UTC,That's it! It's a weird size which is why I had to go cough up the money to get it professionally framed. Totally worth it
rangers,385o1l,Heisenbergs_own,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:17:24 2015 UTC,That's from the Ottawa game! Best giveaway all season. I'm having mine framed as well.
rangers,384pkg,BadSeedling,13,Mon Jun 1 20:59:29 2015 UTC,"Speech therapy? Wow, that must have been terrifying for him when he it happened."
rangers,384pkg,ncolaros,6,Mon Jun 1 21:10:39 2015 UTC,You can tell he's still getting back to full-strength speech wise. I'm just glad they say he'll be okay in the long run. I'm looking forward to seeing zucc and this team come back strong.
rangers,384pkg,dberti22,9,Tue Jun 2 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"Man, I teared up watching this. You can hear his speech is still off. I know he's getting better but this just made me emotional. We miss you and love you Zuccy. Rest up and we'll see you soon."
rangers,384pkg,blueshirtdave,7,Tue Jun 2 00:25:30 2015 UTC,"I compared this to a few other interviews and I didn't really notice anything except maybe just barely a couple of sounds he struggled a bit more with, but I'm no expert."
rangers,384pkg,DicNavis,4,Tue Jun 2 01:21:46 2015 UTC,Really scary to hear he couldn't speak for days. That was a very serious injury. I'm glad he's doing better now.
rangers,384pkg,razzbaronz,2,Tue Jun 2 01:27:57 2015 UTC,And not to sound shallow here (Because Zucc is my boy) but what shirt is he wearing?
rangers,383oez,JKaye57,67,Mon Jun 1 16:59:54 2015 UTC,So our top 3 defensemen were gimped and our best playmaker lost the ability to speak for 4 days. Fuck you hockey gods I dare thou to smite me.
rangers,383oez,dakraiz,9,Mon Jun 1 17:10:36 2015 UTC,I mean this makes sense. I knew we had heart... The bodies just weren't willing. Hockey hates us.

rangers,383oez,tonic14,0,Mon Jun 1 17:56:07 2015 UTC,28 minutes average TOI versus 8 minutes average TOI.
rangers,383oez,DicNavis,10,Tue Jun 2 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. The fact that the three of them stayed in the lineup and took regular shifts (for the most part) is nuts. I wonder though, would sitting one of them for Hunwick have been better for the team? Gimped Staal/G/McD > Totally healthy Hunwick???"
rangers,383oez,josephnicklo,3,Mon Jun 1 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I wondered this too. Especially in Game 7, where we could have put Shep in the game instead of 7 defensemen. But honestly, I don't know the answer."
rangers,383oez,ncolaros,5,Mon Jun 1 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind benching Shep and double shifting Nash, Hayes, etc. And apparently, Hunwick was insurance for Mac, G, and Staal.  Could we have dressed 8 defensemen? Lol, just kidding. Mostly.  I think AV played the right odds with the crap cards he was dealt."
rangers,383oez,lionson76,2,Mon Jun 1 18:50:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally valid opinion. Really, it's one of those things where if it works, you made the right decision, and if it doesn't, well who knows?"
rangers,383oez,ncolaros,2,Mon Jun 1 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"True. In the end, we're just fans."
rangers,383oez,josephnicklo,2,Mon Jun 1 17:57:25 2015 UTC,You would rather have Shep instead of your captain out there?
rangers,383oez,KevOK80,3,Mon Jun 1 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"We got, what, 12 minutes out of McDonagh? 12 minutes of him not being able to really play. Shep has size and he contributes well on the fourth line. That also means we wouldn't have had to double shift Fast or Moore. I'm not saying either decision is the right one, but it's at least worth considering.  It's really more that we hadn't dressed 7 defensemen all year, and changing things up in a Game 7 like that is generally not good. But of course having your Captain out there is a great emotional lightning rod. But let me ask you: did it look like having our Captain out there energized our players?"
rangers,383oez,ncolaros,2,Mon Jun 1 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"He played over 17 but that's besides the point. I don't know what the ""right"" decision was but I don't think sitting him was an option for game 7 of the ECF for a 4th liner."
rangers,383oez,KevOK80,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"And you might be right, but you have to accept the possibility that playing him was the wrong move, too. We did lose, after all."
rangers,383oez,ncolaros,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"And that's why I said ""I don't know what the ""right"" decision was"". I am saying from NYR/AV/McD side of it I don't think it even crossed their minds not to dress him. Part of me does think that they may have wasted an opportunity with Hunwick and only playing him just over 4min. He maybe could have had more of an impact with some more minutes."
rangers,383oez,KevOK80,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:36:50 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. If you're gonna dress Hunwick, you need to play him more than 4 minutes. Especially when you consider the list of injured players on defense."
rangers,383oez,ncolaros,18,Mon Jun 1 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know, you can say all you want they didn't PLAY well, but I don't see how anyone can question the team's heart/dedication when you read stuff like this."
rangers,383oez,runninhillbilly,15,Mon Jun 1 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"Nope. Didn't you get the memo? They have no heart, and AV needs to be fired. Trade Nash and burn MSL at the stake."
rangers,383oez,ncolaros,5,Mon Jun 1 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"Oh - and Hank too, he's getting old!"
rangers,383oez,mexicaaaan,5,Mon Jun 1 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"It all makes sense...  With our top 3 blueliners hobbled, the forwards were no doubt instructed to help out more defensively. That led to a lower powered offense with fewer stretch passes, less sustained pressure, and mediocre scoring chances - made even worse by no Zucc.  Couple that with Tampa's smart coaching against our system - full credit to them for that - and there you have it. Season over.  Game 6 was our last stand. Even if we somehow made it to the Finals, how much would the boys have left?  Anyway, every team battles injuries this time of year, so this isn't a bitter fan making excuses. I think we were all genuinely shocked by how it ended, including Hank... As if George R.R. Martin  was calling the game.  This help explains it. Now I get why it ended the way it did... The fates were just not on our side. Oddly, that's kind of comforting."

rangers,383oez,Darclite,2,Mon Jun 1 17:01:03 2015 UTC,I wonder how many injuries Girardi has had in his career that he's just played through. He's missed like 5 games in his career and has been in the top 10 in blocked shots every year.
rangers,383oez,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Mon Jun 1 18:12:12 2015 UTC,Yandle had a shoulder injury too
rangers,383oez,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"Someone shared a Ranger's blog post that criticized our depth. Essentially, the author indicated that our injured players should have been benched - and replaced with able-bodies.   In his argument, he pointed to the situation with McD in Game 7. Rather than dress 7 defensemen, bench McD and slot in Hunwick. Healthy is always better than injured.   To a certain extent, I agree with the author. We needed other capable players to slot in in the event of injury. 1/2 of our defense was hobbled - we could have used depth players to give those injuries a rest."
rangers,383oez,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"Who would you have dressed in Game 7? You mention Hunwick for McDonagh, but then after that who? You have injuries for Staal and Girardi as well."
rangers,383oez,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"I definitely would have called up Kostka. He wasn't terrible and could have given Staal/Girardi a breather.  After that, maybe Summers or Allen?   For a game or two, it wouldn't have been devastating.   During the offseason, the Rangers should aim to improve depth. Maybe sign some in-betweeners to 2-way contracts."
rangers,383oez,Rocketman_man,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"The only time we ever could have taken a breather in this years playoffs was the Penguins series, and we got that breather by winning in five games.   The Caps and Bolts series were so fucking close and intense that there is no Game in which I would have felt comfortable inserting an 8th or 9th defensemen in place of a 2nd or 3rd defensemen, even if they're injured."
rangers,383oez,grc_tv,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"No, I understand that and I totally agree.   I think the aim of the article was that the Rangers need depth players that they can trust - in the event of injuries."

Just happy we played so strong this season."

I can think of only 2 things: A) Walcott and Rangers could not agree to a contract (most likely bonuses, if this is the case, as Entry Level Contracts cap out at $925,000/yr) or B) Rangers figure they have enough left-handed defensemen in the fold, and are making room for right-handed defensemen prospects to come under contract this summer.

rangers,384807,_TheConsumer_,9,Mon Jun 1 19:06:22 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking as they clinched the presidents trophy that this was the most fun season of hockey I have ever watched. Rarely did I wake up miserable in the am after a Ranger's loss the night before. There were winning streaks, come back wins, over time wins, dominant wins- it was amazing.   When they went down 3-1 against Washington I was so disappointed but that game 5 comeback I remember thinking at the very least the team gave me one more awesome game. I cherished hearing the goal horn on that overtime goal by Mac.   Then they do it again and come back from 3-1. Epic game 7 win that will go down in history as one of the best ever. Hearing Doc yell SCOOOOAAAR will bring a grin to my face for years to come when I listen to that replay.   Is it disappointing game one SC finals isn't wednesday for the Rangers? Fuck yeah it is. Does it hurt. Fuck yes it does. Shit man they spent 8 months building a ladder, climbed within 5 rungs of the top only to have it pull away from the building and collapse. Absolutely heartbreaking.   But that's hockey. It's a heartbreaking sport, perhaps the most heartbreaking sport out there.  What it all comes down to, is  when you look back on this season and remember all the high times, yes the shadow of not making the SC finals will be there.  But the day they hoist that cup up, the day our flair stays lit, the day we wake up champions, on that day you will remember all this heartbreak, and it will make the celebration that much sweeter.   Thanks to the Rangers and all the Ranger bro's here for a great season."

I am however really looking forward to what AV tries to do next, I think we have played better throughout the complete season than last year its just that we lost it at the end. Some of that is on heavy injuries that appeared now and som non disciplined moves that we hadn't seen before. Otherwise they have been solid after solid.  I got to see the Rangers live for the first time kicking some Buffalo ass 6-1 and I kept myself awake for every game even if the click was 1 am or 3 am locally here in Sweden. Obe thing is certain I am going to have a lot of fun next season and I hope we pull it off!"

rangers,384807,cooljammer00,2,Tue Jun 2 07:01:19 2015 UTC,"You guys are so spoiled to have an incredible team like the Rangers in your hometown. I honestly don't understand the hatred this team has received for getting knocked out in the Conference FINALS... That's TOP 4. There are 30 teams in the league, and this team has made it to at least the TOP 4 three times in the past four years...... just let that sink in. Take it from a guy who lives in a city where we're just happy to see our team make the playoffs. NY has a FANTASTIC team. I would rather be able to see my team make a deep playoff run year after year after year than to win the cup once then disappear from the playoffs after that."
rangers,384807,Nezirsc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:59:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, Pilon was claimed on waivers from the Islanders. But your point stands. That '99 team was filled with major free agent busts like Valeri Kamensky, Kevin Hatcher, Theo Fleury had a disappointing first season, etc. When Slats took over for Neil Smith, he followed the same philosophy of trying to buy a championship before the salary cap forced him to actually be smart.  And I definitely understand what you're saying. I started following this team in '99 so my first few years as a Ranger fan were filled with nothing but disappointment. We've become a team expected to make the playoffs to a team expected to go deep in the playoffs. It's a huge turnaround when you look back on the dark days of the 21st century. But it's still disappointing to watch this team bow out the way they did. I think that's what makes it so hard. Last season, I don't know how many of us expected to go all the way to the Cup Final. Coming back against Pittsburgh, riding the emotions of Marty's mom passing. This season, winning the President's Trophy, I think more was expected.  I distinctly remember watching game 1 against the Penguins in the opening round which we won 2-1. While it was great to take the first game, I thought that they could do so much better. A 2-0 lead became 2-1 and if it wasn't for Hank, who knows how that game would have turned out. They basically just sat on the lead and were under siege the rest of the game. Not much changed after that. The storyline became how the Rangers were finding ways to win 2-1 games. But there was that killer instinct missing. And to see that egg they laid in game 7 where they looked so limp, it left a bad taste in my mouth."

There are other teams in our conference are going to be better.  It's going to be harder to win.  Look at the Bruins - windows close.  How about the Sharks?  They're a ""perennial contender"" as well, until this year.  The Canucks?  The Blues?  These teams never got over the hump.  I'd give up a few years of being a perennial contender for a championship.  That's what matters.  That's pretty much why I'm upset.  This was a missed opportunity.    I really appreciate your optimism in such a dire time though, and personally I don't think the window is closed yet, but optimistically how many more kicks at the can is Lundqvist gonna get?"

rangers,386233,Koko2315,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:46:53 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Elite goalies tend to remain good into their mid-30s. Though I can't really think of any goalies at Hank's level that declined suddenly at his age. Guys like Roy, Hasek, Brodeur, Belfour all played well into their late 30s (sometimes 40s)."
rangers,386233,TheCaptainRon,2,Tue Jun 2 03:13:06 2015 UTC,Yes I'm a proponent that after 36 goalies drop off. Yes I agree Hank has as good a shot as anybody to hang around til 40.  Nobody said the window is closing tomorrow. Lets say on the low end the team has 3 years left to really make a genuine run. Right now they've played in 3 of the last 4 ECF's. That means for 7 seasons they'd be a serious contender for the cup. Before that they had a couple playoff runs as well which I wouldn't really count.  Now lets say Hank lives up to being as good as well all think he is and plays til 40. He'll be behind a very different team at that point thanks to the cap and all that jazz.  End of the day we don't know shit.  Lets enjoy the ride and we can reopen this conversation about the window when we're not right in the middle of it. Hopefully we'll have a Cup win or two when the dust settles.  EDIT : Words done happened.
rangers,384t0u,hkygoalie30,7,Mon Jun 1 21:22:42 2015 UTC,I think we would have been ok. These guys know how important the SCF is and no matter the injury they would have pushed themselves until they couldn't play.
rangers,384t0u,thehockeychimp,4,Mon Jun 1 21:56:47 2015 UTC,Well if our scoring was consistent then I believe we could have won easily against the backhawks. Injured Defensemen doesn't explain our lack of scoring at home
rangers,384t0u,TB0NE99,5,Mon Jun 1 21:56:53 2015 UTC,It kinda can. If you're stuck in your own zone for large periods of time because your defense is struggling then you don't really have a lot of opportunities to score.
rangers,384t0u,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Mon Jun 1 23:32:10 2015 UTC,"Also our top 3 D were limited in mobility. Prevents being able to pinch and get to the puck in the offensive zone, which allowed the Lightning to clear and kept us out of their zone"
rangers,384t0u,bu77munch,5,Tue Jun 2 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"Call up Kostka. He was playing pretty well in the AHL.   If we were really spread thin on D, call up Summers or Allen too.   I think MSL should have been benched (for at least one game) to send him a message. Give Bourque a start or two."

I guess you know better than him because those AHL numbers are just so glaringly obvious that he'd do well in a fucking playoff game after basically getting shouted off the ice during the regular season. christ."
rangers,384t0u,mexicaaaan,2,Tue Jun 2 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"This is a speculation thread- specifically asking how the Rangers would play in this year's SCF.   If the injuries to Stall and McD were that bad, I could imagine AV calling up another defenseman or two. The two highest defensemen on the call-up list are Kostka and Allen/Summers. Players get called up from the AHL - where they have AHL season stats.   I have no idea why you're reading this as me knowing better than the coach."
rangers,384t0u,_TheConsumer_,2,Tue Jun 2 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the team was too worn down to really compete with Chicago. I think it would have been a  bad series with all those unfortunate injuries. Our chance to win would have been on our offense and I think Crawford is shaky enough to beat, I'd be worried about their defense though."
rangers,384t0u,bu77munch,2,Tue Jun 2 00:22:30 2015 UTC,"Before knowing the injuries, I'd say we would win in 7 against either team. We have been very hit or miss in the last 2 rounds. So it would be close.   Knowing about these injuries and seeing some players regress, I think we'd lose. The only healthy dman is Yandle and he just became healthy. Klein doesn't look like himself, Boyle can't defend top players. Yandle could actually play on Kane/Perry. Our offense might show up it might not. It's honestly a coin flip."
rangers,384t0u,jedimasterchief,2,Tue Jun 2 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"Knowing the extent of the injuries, not too well.   Mac had a broken foot. Hell he missed the first couple of min of game 7. Doubt he would have been of any use.   Staal with the fracture helps to explain some things, or at the least give an excuse. Hope he does better Next year, because as of late hes been...inconsistent at best.   Girardi doesn't sound too bad. Yandle either. Hell, Yandle was getting better. I'm not reading too much into their injuries.   As for Zucc...I think a lot of us were hoping hed be on the ice for the Finals if we got there, but that doesnt seem to be the case. It sucks, we could have used him, but oh well.   Honestly, the worst thing was not hearing about one particular injury; MSL. I might have thought about a Vet min contract if he had some sort of injury, but now it just seems like we gotta let him go. Shame, but ill take the extra Cap back."

rangers,382ykm,nyr16,2,Mon Jun 1 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"Each scored a goal and then 3, 2, and 1 assists. 9 points in 6 games. I see what you're saying. I still say while we're in fantasy land we ignore one of them and get Tarasenko. Cause he's the shit. I bet he smells nice too."
rangers,382ykm,TheCaptainRon,3,Mon Jun 1 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"Only possible in the deepest, happiest parts of fantasy land. Id give so much for a guy like tarasenko"

rangers,382ykm,TheCaptainRon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:17:08 2015 UTC,Buchnevich is basically going to be Tarasenko so I don't see why we need to trade Nash
rangers,382ykm,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:46:22 2015 UTC,"So untrue. Dude where do you get your facts from? Some of the shit you say sounds like your living in a different world. Buchnevich is a guaranteed success in Ranger dreams, in reality hes far from it. I think he can be a great player, but its pure speculation, his KHL stats are far from spectacular. Tarasenko is a top 5 forward this season, who is incredibly young, talented and a skill ceiling that is not even visible yet."
rangers,382ykm,nyr16,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:29:48 2015 UTC,He had more points and a better points per game at the same age as Tarasenko in the KHL    But yeah I guess 30 points in 48 games in the KHL at age 19 isn't that impressive
rangers,382ykm,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Tue Jun 2 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"First off, tarasenko had 47 pt season (54 games between 2 teams) at 20, and 32 pt season at 21. Those are impressive numbers. If you want to just base it off the pts, look at Kuzzy on the Caps, hes good but hes not even close to tarasenko despite having solid u20 stats. Tarasenko is a super elite player man, to say any1 from the khl without nhl experience is going to be ""basically him"" is just stupidity and predictions, nothing more. Connor Mcdavid and Jack Eichel have yet to prove to be ""basically tarasenko"""
rangers,382ykm,nyr16,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:40:00 2015 UTC,Obviously I didn't mean that Buchnevich is going to become a carbon fucking copy of Tarasenko. But given they had similar production at the same age it's not unreasonable to think that Buchnevich has potential to reach Tarasenko's level in a few years. I think you're taking my comment too literally. Also if you don't think Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel are going to be stars lol.
rangers,382ykm,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"I do think they'll be stars, but right now they're nothing but big names, they have a whole lot to prove before they live up to their expectations, or are comparable to tarasenko. There isn't much to argue here, all I'm saying is saying buchnevich will be as good as tarasenko at this point of time is reeiculous, with Kuzzy being a prime example excelling there doesn't guarantee anything"
rangers,382ykm,nyr16,3,Tue Jun 2 22:12:25 2015 UTC,drop one of them and get me Tarasenko. If you're talking anything from St. Louis you should be trying to get Tarasenko.  Buying something from St. Louis airport? Better be Tarasenko!  Best BBQ in St.Louis? Shut up and go kidnap Tarasenko

I will literally never understand these people. The Rangers average age is near the top of the NHL, but take away a 39-year-old Marty St. Louis and a 38-year-old Brian Boyle and they'd be near the middle at the least.  There are so many guys on this team just entering their prime. I have absolutely no idea how you could think this team is over."
rangers,382ykm,razorhater,12,Tue Jun 2 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"I personally think Rick Nash is fine.  I do not believe that your salary is based on your points (which btw he did pretty dam well this season on).   People love to say that paying Nash that much to do what ""glass"" does is ridiculous however Nash is 10x better than Glass.   I am fine with Nash.  If we could trade Nash for something more that be great but honestly Nash is a good player. He played well  DO NOT RESIGN MSL Go after Ward"
rangers,382ykm,TheSensation19,3,Mon Jun 1 14:47:25 2015 UTC,"If Zucc comes back healthy and MSL wants more than 2 mill per season, I'd love for us to get Ward. I really wish we could get rid of Glass' contract. Ward would be exactly what we need."
rangers,382ykm,truthlesshunter,3,Mon Jun 1 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"Even if MSL wants 500,000 what is the point?!  He will just be taking up space for another guy we can have who is younger and brings more to the table.   Several guys on that list I would love to have. I would even want to see what Lindberg/Fast can do... And move them up and see if we can get a differ forward for in the 1 million range..."
rangers,382ykm,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"MSL still got a decent point total this season. His playoffs were hard to watch, but as a player, we're losing track of focusing on his age/salary rather than what he brings. It's a lot like with Richards. MSL will be good for 50-55 points and bring tons of leadership and heart to the team. I think that's more than a young person would at this point, since we have our core already under 25 (Kreider, Stepan, Hayes, Miller, etc.).     edit: two train of thoughts at the same time."
rangers,382ykm,truthlesshunter,2,Mon Jun 1 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I do not agree.  MSL is continuing his downward trend of points and overall production. I would much rather have Lindberg taking over Fasts position and Fast moving on up than resign MSL for 500,000.  Realistically I would much rather go after Ward, Frolik, Stafford, Fisher, Vermette then keep MSL for 500,000.  He is a good player who can bring that 50ish and 15-20ish goals. However so could Jagr and I do not want him either. These guys are  good for one thing. Playing that top 4 winger. He wont go in front of the net. He cant provide much defensive value. We have far too many short guys and MSL is in his 40s. I say drop the guy. Let him go to Islanders or Devils where he can score 70 points and not make the playoffs.   Ward could be the guy they need in front of the net on the PP. He can play a top 3 with Nash or he can be the 3rd liner who can dominate with Hayes. He can dominate people and I want him."
rangers,382ykm,TheSensation19,2,Mon Jun 1 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"Lol. MSL is a veteran, hall of fame player. Your a fool if you think he would accept 500k (baby change) from any team. That would be disrespectful. Thats also coming from a person who thought he was the worst player on the team this playoff run."
rangers,382ykm,nyr16,2,Mon Jun 1 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"...  Your totally missing the point.  I am not saying lets offer him 500,000. I am saying even if he WANTED only 500,000 then I would not bring him back. For all the reasons above/below. Simply put... I rather have someone else. Several good RW in the FA. Couple of good ones in our system, with Fast proving his worth at 2nd/3rd line. I think MSL is getting slower and older and in the playoffs he was nonexistent.   All season he was inconsistent. Scoring 3 points one night. Going pointless for 4 and then scoring 7 points in 2 games. Then going 0 for 3 again. WTF.   Anyway... I hope to God he does not resign. He retires orrrrrrrrr we dont bring him back. I would prefer if he goes on to some other team but you know it will be a local team near CT cuz of his family now that hes 40."
rangers,382ykm,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, you agree we should drop him. My misunderstandings."
rangers,382ykm,nyr16,3,Tue Jun 2 04:24:36 2015 UTC,lol  For sure Idc who he is. How many points he had or what he can get us. Unless he can assure us over 60 points and 15 points in the playoffs then what is the point. Give some one else a chance
rangers,382ykm,TheSensation19,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:21:46 2015 UTC,This opinion is unpopular but I think MSL will be the judge of if he has anything left in the tank.  I'm pretty sure he will retire if he feels like he lost a step (which is what it looked like in the playoffs).
rangers,382ykm,PhilipK_Dick,-1,Mon Jun 1 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"Even if MSL wants 500,000 what is the point?   League minimum will be around 625K, firstly.  Secondly, you sound like a complete idiot. This is a hard cap league, MSL for cheap is a great asset. He scored 21 goals and 31 assists in the regular season. MSL is a 40-point player next year, i.e. a very very solid 3rd liner.  40 point players are not as dime a dozen as you are implying  MSL for ~2-3 million is a GREAT investment"
rangers,382ykm,jordansideas,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"Good. Then let me sound like an idiot.   Or maybe I just understand that hockey is far more than just paying for players based on how many points they get. MSL is not useful on the defensive end. He is not especially now and I do not think that will change next year. Even with 31 assists, how many of those were actually primary assists and not just secondary. Because I know many assists he had in this years playoffs were secondary and hardly the reason if the reason at all we scored....  I much rather have:  Frolik / Stafford - Both guys who are bigger bodies. Who score 40 points. More physical. More versatile. Cheaper than what MSL was this year. However both are in their 20's  Ward - Who landed NEARLY 40 points bouncing around all 4 lines, playing most of his time on the 4th line. He is in his 30s but will be much cheaper. And just as he showed us in the playoffs, he would be a physical force that MSL was not. And a bigger presence on the PP than MSL is. Nash is great in front of the net but they like his skill on the outside. So now with Ward they can place Nash outside still and have someone so effective in the middle. Do not forget he also was better points wise than MSL in playoffs.   Vermette - Was not a 40 point guy last year but has been... And can be when put onto a playoff team right away. Is he overrated, maybe. But hes better than MSL. As he can play bottom 6 if the top 6 does not suit him in our system. He can play PK. He can play Center. He has great FO%. He can do PP.   And once again... I rather have Fast take over his spot on the 2nd or 3rd line  who had 14 points in regular season on the 4th line and 6 points bouncing around in the playoffs. And then bring up Lindberg to play Fast's old role.   MSL is getting older. He is getting slower. He has said he chose NY because he wants to be closer to his family predominately, yet when he came here he looked off from the start. He got a whole year to get use to it and still its the same inconsistency issues. Maybe hes more focused on retirement and family then the Rangers.  As I said, I rather not resign him. Do 10000 other things because I rather have more size, similar points and for 3-4 million and go on without him. Cuz watching the playoffs Its proven we can. He is not there.   And ya know. He would probably go to Brooklyn or New Jersey cuz its close to CT as he could get. Probably make 3 million a year... Get 60 points playing top 3 minutes. And ya know what... thats fine. Doesnt make it a right move for us to bring him back by any means"

rangers,382ykm,annihilus813,3,Mon Jun 1 15:42:10 2015 UTC,Would I do this?  You're goddamn right.
rangers,382ykm,TheCaptainRon,2,Mon Jun 1 14:23:39 2015 UTC,"Because they are a much younger team with more in the pipeline, and not enough money to go around.  If you bring in Nash and surround him with young talent, you probably get a thriving power forward.  Nash doesn't create. He benefits from others' creativity."
rangers,382ykm,annihilus813,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:22:24 2015 UTC,I think when Nash is ON he creates his own goals or benefits from butt goals. Part of being a big forward with good defensive play is he creates for himself we saw that during the regular season. A guy like Ovi or Stammer they score from standing and benefiting. Granted its been a while since we saw that Nash playing but he was there in the regular season
rangers,382ykm,TheCaptainRon,2,Mon Jun 1 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe I drank too much of the Kool-Aid, but there was a great article linked here a few days ago about how Nash flourishes when he is the recipient of passes.  Those passes dried up big time in the playoffs, so his productivity dried up also.  As such, I think Nash requires a certain kind of system to be successful.  It also means that if a team is capable of neutralizing that system, then Nash's productivity will disappear."
rangers,382ykm,annihilus813,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:59:20 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to come off as he does it all himself. But he's certainly capable of muscling himself into scoring position and scoring goals where the primary assist seems like a technicality.  No doubt he benefits from zucc and brassards playmaking abilities when they're on their game as well.  But when he shows up for real and uses all the ridiculous physical tools he has he creates for himself sometimes others (that takeaway on sustr to set up Brassards goal in game 6)
rangers,382ykm,TheCaptainRon,2,Mon Jun 1 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"But when he shows up for real and uses all the ridiculous physical tools he has he creates for himself   This is the biggest problem.  Regardless of the reason why it happens, in the playoffs he just doesn't ""show up for real."""

If all 3 of those players were to be moved we'd have to give them at least one of JT/Hags/Fast plus Nash, probably plus picks too (of which we have none)."
rangers,382ykm,josephnicklo,2,Mon Jun 1 20:46:55 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely we trade a defenseman for the last offensive piece we need.

rangers,382ykm,josephnicklo,2,Mon Jun 1 15:36:32 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it'll be Girardi at the trade deadline either next year or the following.   Edit: Girardi isn't going anywhere. He's got a No movement clause. So he's got to approve any movements. I doubt he's going to willing leave a team he's played his whole career with and he's signed until he is 36.

rangers,382ykm,PhilipK_Dick,2,Mon Jun 1 18:07:23 2015 UTC,I keep seeing this here. Who the hell is voluntary taking on Girardi's albatross of a contract?
rangers,382ykm,Darclite,3,Mon Jun 1 17:38:35 2015 UTC,What makes G's contract an albatross?  He gets paid as a top pair shutdown defender.  Worth every penny...
rangers,382ykm,PhilipK_Dick,3,Mon Jun 1 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"If you're judging by shot attempts, he's not a very good defenseman.  However, he's probably the exact candidate to demonstrate that raw 5 on 5 corsi is an incomplete stat. He definitely provides extra value in that he never misses time, he is forced to take defensive draws and play against top forwards, he's been a big part of an elite penalty kill his entire career, and he always finishes top 10 in the league in blocked shots.  He's probably still somewhat overpaid as he makes a ton and won't be worth that much as he ages, but I do think that having this group on defense has spoiled Ranger fans. If people want to see actual bad defense watch Philly or Edmonton and realize that when Girardi is your biggest concern you've got it pretty good.  Doesn't matter anyway though. He's got an NMC."
rangers,382ykm,boxtowire,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, Corsi doesn't show G's brilliance.  Shutdown defensemen who are always in the lineup are rare indeed..."
rangers,382ykm,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:56:10 2015 UTC,I love the guy but the way he plays is gonna take its toll sooner rather than later and we're gonna be stuck paying a broken-down one-dimensional D-man almost $6 million a year for several years.
rangers,382ykm,boxtowire,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:19:06 2015 UTC,All long term deals factor in future degradation of skills.    What are the chances Lundqvist will be worth $7M in his age 38 season?

But G is the one guy on the team that blocks shots, and he's missed, what, 2 games his whole career?   I think we lost the last series because they blocked all our shots, and we made it hard on Hank by going down and blocking very few of theirs. Guys like Girardi on defense is what we need. I'm not saying you go full Torts (never go full Torts), but bringing back a bit of that mentality would help us, I think. Just a bit."

Yes, he had a fantastic regular season. But once again, he came up short in the playoffs. Why are we paying him the big bucks? To score goals, no? Yes, he plays both ways and does a great job on defense. But how many years of lackluster playoff performances do we have to witness before we say enough is enough? He had plenty of chances this postseason, game 7 notwithstanding, and almost the entire time he was throwing soft little wristers from 10 feet out. It wasn't until game 4 where he looked like regular season Nash and made a power move to the net. Where has that shit been all postseason? He did it all season long but come playoff time he just turns into a big softie. He's a guy we were supposed to count on but let's be honest with ourselves, when we need a big goal, I feel like most of us are looking at Stepan or Brassard to come through.

rangers,382ykm,josephnicklo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"Trading Nash for Steen, Schwartz, and Oshie?  I'd take Steen and Schwartz, but I'd be okay with not taking Oshie. Overrated, though who knows how well he'd do with our system.  Then again, I wouldn't want to trade Nash. He isn't the problem."
rangers,382ykm,ncolaros,3,Mon Jun 1 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to trade Nash. He isn't the problem.   I disagree 100% about trading Nash. That would be foolish considering he's such a huge asset to the team, especially in the regular season however. That being said, Nash is definitely not the problem, but he certainly is part of the problem. The team clearly didn't have any ""fire"" or deterimination when they needed it most. Like Foitu said in his interview, Nash needs to get fired up and stop playing like a scared little pet turtle.  He did (finally) come through with some important goals and he definitely had a drastic improvement offensively over last year but the team needed more out of him."
rangers,382ykm,callmesnake13,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"Nash needs to be better, of course, but so does everyone besides Brassard. Even Stepan was absent during Game 7."
rangers,382ykm,MakePie_NotWar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who doesn't see the need for any immediate trades? I'd rather wait until the regular season, see how things pan out - maybe Klein and MSL were just slumping, it happens - and work from there. I know they underproduced but the absence of Zucc really threw a wrench into everything from a chemistry standpoint, and I don't think it is possible to objectively view the situation without him."
rangers,382ykm,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should trade Nash, he's too much of a threat.   However, something has to be done about his post season production. Our goal scorer isn't scoring goals.  To use an analogy: say the Rangers are a group of construction workers and they're currently building a house. Nash's job is to bring the hammers for everyone. He helps out with other stuff like carrying wood and setting up electrical shit. That's great and it's a big help, but he DOESN'T BRING THE HAMMERS!  You can't build a house without hammers!   For some reason, he turns into a shell of his regular season self and it seriously hurts us, in more ways than one. If he's scoring and doing all the things he needs to do, he's going to command the attention of the other team's best dman. That will free up our other forwards to do their thing and will hopefully give us better matchups.  If he's not scoring, though, they can put a lesser dman on him and put their better/best dman against someone/a line that isn't as skilled as Nash, effectively taking away production from at least two lines.  He has to be better, period. 5 goals is unacceptable from a guy who's being paid to score goals."
rangers,382ykm,MakePie_NotWar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:03:32 2015 UTC,Should the Lightning get rid of that Stamkos guy for only scoring 7 goals in the playoffs so far?
rangers,382ykm,PhilipK_Dick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"A. I said we shouldn't get rid of Nash  B. The Johnson(?) line scored more than half of TB's goals. Stamkos' lack of productivity wasn't as detrimental to them as Nash's was to us. Would they be having this conversation if we had won on Friday? Possibly. They might still have it if they lose the SC.   I don't care what they do, I'm not a Lightning fan. I'm a Rangers fan and our lack of scoring in the playoffs is worrisome. The first way to fix this is to start with Nash and work our way down. Do we get another scorer to take pressure off him? Do we have him talk to a therapist to get his confidence back?"
rangers,382ykm,rvbcaboose1018,2,Mon Jun 1 19:44:18 2015 UTC,Players of Nash's caliber are few and far between.  I don't see how we could replace him so we have to look at what does the teem need to improve scoring.  Perhaps a healthy Zucc and the trickle down in the lineup he would bring would have been the answer?
rangers,382ykm,Rocketman_man,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"Nash+Cam for all three. I'd do that trade.   I don't 100% believe that Nash is a problem, and I get the idea of trading our best goalscorer as a tad extreme, but Nash's 7.8 million contract is becoming a burden. Plus, while paying him the big bucks he hasn't exactly had a tremendous performance in the playoffs. This year was better, but at 7.8 million you expect Nash to score more than once per series. Turning Nash into 3 players who combined had more than 180 points for roughly the same amount of money is something I'd do.   As for Cam...well I'd hate to trade him, but goalies are a hot commodity right now, and he could really sweeten a deal. Skapski as a backup doesn't sound too bad IMO. He is the chosen one after all."
rangers,383nwq,BeardedNino,26,Mon Jun 1 16:56:24 2015 UTC,The Rangers trading Nash would be really fucking stupid
rangers,383nwq,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Mon Jun 1 17:21:23 2015 UTC,I imagine it would depend on what they get in return. These blanket statements are dumb.
rangers,383nwq,Litig8,5,Mon Jun 1 21:44:35 2015 UTC,I can't really imagine a situation in which a President's Trophy winner that just made an appearance in the conference finals parting with its top forward is smart.

rangers,383nwq,hockeysauce,2,Tue Jun 2 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but like I said in response to a similar comment, it's likely that there aren't any realistic trades that the Rangers could pull of where sending Nash to another team would make them better."
rangers,383nwq,tj_sad_boi_666,-1,Tue Jun 2 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Why? He has a history of being a bad playoff performer, and the team's offense is centered around him. If he scores a few more goals in key spots in the last two years (like the 3 OT games against LA), maybe we have a cup."
rangers,383nwq,ashnayde,15,Mon Jun 1 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"Ugh. This again.  He was number 2 in scoring in this year's playoffs while battling against the top 2 Dmen of the Pens, Caps and Tampa.  He had 14 points in 19 games and was a +8.   Enough of this."
rangers,383nwq,tomj,2,Mon Jun 1 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"Numbers alone don't tell the whole story. Look at the breakdown of his scoring here. Those numbers were boosted by him racking up 7 points in the two laugher games they played against Tampa. That's just 7 points for the other 17 they played! He's much more absent in the tight, to the wire games. You could see it in his game. When the pressure's on, he doesn't drive to the net, he doesn't park his big ass out front, and every shot he takes is into the opposing goalie's chest."
rangers,383nwq,ashnayde,8,Mon Jun 1 22:11:14 2015 UTC,He also has a history as our top point/goal scorer.
rangers,383nwq,thehockeychimp,3,Mon Jun 1 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"That might be good enough for more great regular seasons, but probably not good enough for a Cup."
rangers,383nwq,ashnayde,5,Mon Jun 1 22:16:00 2015 UTC,But he's (one of) the reasons we got to the playoffs and the ECF.
rangers,383nwq,thehockeychimp,3,Mon Jun 1 22:44:06 2015 UTC,"That is true, which is why you don't trade him for garbage - you'd need to get a pretty good return. I'm just saying that he's not an untouchable and the team might have to move him if they want that cup."
rangers,383nwq,ashnayde,4,Mon Jun 1 22:54:57 2015 UTC,He had the same number of points in the conference finals as Steven Stamkos and Patrick Kane. I guess that's struggling though.
rangers,383nwq,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Mon Jun 1 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"For me, I love the idea of my Wings trading for a top liner.. but I think he would be too pricey for my liking.  Bucci's tweet did intrigue me, however. (let's be honest, it doesn't take much in the off-season)"
rangers,383nwq,sketchymike90,8,Mon Jun 1 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"IF this were to go down, I'd definitely want Nyquist plus anoter guy or two.

rangers,383nwq,Darclite,4,Mon Jun 1 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my initial reaction is that this trade should not happen. The Rangers just came off winning the President's Trophy. Trading our leading scorer would absolutely ensure we are worse next year - even if we get blue-chip prospects.   There are other areas where we could be creative - but we do not need an epic overhaul."
rangers,383nwq,Andrewplaysdrums,3,Mon Jun 1 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"I hate when trade speculation happens and people either go ""LOL idiots want to trade X"" or ""thank god just get rid of X."" There's a breaking point for every trade. Hank is off the table, theoretically, but if there was a package of the 6 best points per dollar of cap hit forwards then you'd take it lol (note, I'm the last person who would ever suggest trading Hank, just saying that trades are about what the exchange rates are).  If the return was something like Tatar+Sheahan or Helm+Athanasiou(or one of their other various promising forward prospects)+2nd rounder, yeah, I'd take it. Would save a ton of cap space to sign someone else in addition to what we got in return (maybe B Richards?), give us some depth on offense, and those guys are good two way players with solid possession numbers, GF percentages, and fit what we need.  If it's like Tatar+3rd rounder then no, obviously. The two teams in the finals demonstrate a need to have several major offensive threats. Giving up Nash requires that what he brings gets replaced immediately."
rangers,383nwq,ncolaros,3,Mon Jun 1 18:34:41 2015 UTC,Personally I'd be willing to do Tatar + Helm + Athanasiou + 2nd   but there are definitely people (on both sides) that would think their respective team is getting boned.. I get what you are saying for sure.  Thanks for adding to the discussion!
rangers,383nwq,TrimmedXP,2,Mon Jun 1 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"I would think Nyqvist + A prospect (Mantha or Pulkkinen) + either a roster player on a cheap contract OR a 3rd or 4th would be fair, but that might be asking too much?"

rangers,383nwq,DeanYoungblood10,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"That's totally reasonable to want back, I expect it'd be something like:  Nyquist/Tatar + Mantha/1st Round Pick to get started"

rangers,383nwq,invrsleep,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:56:43 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to do Nyquist + Mantha or Pulkinnen.. if you guys are interested in him
rangers,383nwq,x94x,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"What we'd want you wouldn't want to give, what you'd want to give wouldn't be enough.  Wings would never give up Nyqvist, Tatar, Mantha which would be at the top of our wish list.  Not sure Wings make great trade partners with the Rangers."

I have no issues with him really but I do not care if he wants the minimum pay... We cant afford him on the roster. Too many small guys as is. Too many older guys as is. Does not contribute as much as you would hope in 2 years, you cant expect him now to do any different.  Replace him with:  (in no order)   Drew Stafford - Points wise your probably overpaying but hes an all around player who would be 2x better than MSL at the RW position. He is in his hockey prime right now, and you can see once he entered the Jets system he was much better in the stats category.   Michael Frolik - Younger than Stafford. Cheaper. But overall I am not sure which one is better. Either way both are on my radar.   Justin Williams - Excellent player. However maybe inconsistent? Hes older and maybe not in my top 3 overall when I meditate on it but hes on my list  Joel Ward - Would be nice to have his size. His presence and his attitude. Hes a very good player who can play top 3... and bottom 3. Wow  Mike Fisher - Can this guy play wing? I would love this guy  Vermette - Center/ RW... top 6 bottom 6. Idk.... I like it!!!!!  Honestly I think Joel Ward would be best here. I would love him on the PP. He can move all over the place. Hes giant. Hes big. He hits  So what?   Nash - Brassard - Zuccarello  Kreider - Stepan - Ward Miller - Hayes - Hagelin  Fisher - Moore - Fast   Yes I want Glass out.  If boyle retires, which I hope he does in a way then I hope we can go after a guy like Erhoff."

rangers,380pqr,josephnicklo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:39:29 2015 UTC,Can we afford any of those guys? I feel like not. Ward makes 3 mil a year now and is gonna want a raise. Fisher makes what 4 mil a year? In Nashville with no income tax. I'd imagine this team next year looks a lot like they do this year. I'm sure Sather manages to pull of some Cap maneuvering but I don't think we have the cash flow to do much of anything besides resign the guys we need to keep.
rangers,380pqr,TheCaptainRon,2,Mon Jun 1 16:11:04 2015 UTC,I am sure we can.  MSL was like a 5.5 Million Dollar Contract. If we go after Ward for like 2 years at 4 million per... thats way more than he made now. Hes 34...  Then we save 1.5 million. That 1.5 million can go to Stepan to increase his pay.   The rest of the guys we need to resign should be no issue. Hagelin will probably want 3 million. Fast wants about 2. This can all be done easily with the expected cap to rise as its suppose to go 2-3 million  And we might even have wiggle room after that
rangers,380pqr,TheSensation19,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the estimated 11-12 mil they say they have in Cap room was including the cap raise and then not counting any free agent contracts.  Like Stepan Hags Miller Marty none of them have contracts on the books right now.   Meaning Steps 1.5 mil raise puts him at 6 mil, Hags with 3 mil thats 9 mil add in Fast and miller. Not a lot of room.  I could be mistaken though I'm surprisingly not a hockey professional haha."

rangers,383i89,BadSeedling,2,Mon Jun 1 18:21:26 2015 UTC,"Santorelli is just slightly better on faceoffs vs. Moore and he's a defensive liability. The fourth line really isn't the problem for the Rangers, though I think we'd all be happy to see Tanner Glass and his bloated deal go elsewhere. That all being said, I'd rather Sather not over pay for a guy like Santa, because we all know he will if he tries to sign him."

Truth is I saw /r/nflmarketplace get created and figured it would be a good idea to create a subreddit for the NYC based teams since most fans of 1 New York team are fans of New York teams across all sports.
rangers,37zgan,tomj,15,Sun May 31 18:33:26 2015 UTC,i wish torts and av both can coach this team. hey a depressed dude can dream right?
rangers,37zgan,BadSeedling,10,Sun May 31 18:39:03 2015 UTC,Torts would make an awesome assistant coach I think.  Someone who wouldn't have complete control over everyone at every time but someone who was able to step in and lose his mind when the team needed fire and AV isn't the guy for that
rangers,37zgan,Mr_Tophat_Jones,5,Sun May 31 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"This fire needs to come from the on ice leaders. AV is a strategic coach. He consistently will get the team into a position for the on ice leaders to take them to the next level.  Don't get me wrong, he definitely made some strategic errors throughout the TB series, but I believe a little heart and basic hockey concepts demonstrated on the ice would have pushed them into the finals.  They have a lot of the pieces to get the Cup except for an on ice leader that plays with the heart and emotion of the greatest team leader the city has seen--I am not talking about Jeter either.  The offense of the New York Rangers has been lethargic at times and it becomes debilitating. From that point, the rest of the team looses their minds and starts to try to become the hero. This has been a problem since 2005. Until they can get a tactical leader who is self sacrificing and a natural born motivator of his teammates, the Rangers will only come close to getting the ultimate prize.  Their power play is also predictable. I could take a squirt team and teach them a concept to stop the NYR power play. Still there is no on ice leadership during the power play. The front office can't even buy one."
rangers,37zgan,juice_noose,2,Sun May 31 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with all these points I was just thinking that torts was able to get the rangers to where he did by coaching the player rather then just the system. By demanding the most from them every shift and not accepting a player taking a shift off. The problem here was players were saying by the end of the ecf that they were exhausted, worn out,  and just over worked. If they could get him as an assistant he could still bring that fire and that high demand of each individual without having sole reasoning. It'd be to a lesser extent that might be able to last longer and take the players deeper"
rangers,37zgan,Mr_Tophat_Jones,0,Sun May 31 21:47:01 2015 UTC,I was just thinking that torts was able to get the rangers to where he did by coaching the player   Yeah - but I think we can agree that it apparently had it's limits. The players really have to just want it - and we can't rely on a coach to inspire that in them.
rangers,37zgan,mexicaaaan,2,Mon Jun 1 04:42:12 2015 UTC,Jonathan Toews comes to mind
rangers,37zgan,Vivalastool2,2,Mon Jun 1 00:24:22 2015 UTC,1st line Center making 6.5m that scores 2 goals in game 7. Guy is the definition of a leader and a captain. To bad this teams 1st line goal scorer has 10 goals in 60 playoff games.

Just sayin."
rangers,37zgan,One_2nd,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"it sounds an awful lot like Ryan Callahan. Just sayin.   Being one of the few people against the MSL trade, I have to agree 100%. Callahan may not be the guy who will score in bunches but he fits the role that the team was sorely missing this year in the playoffs. He may not have made a huge impact in the playoffs for Tampa up to this point but it's not over yet..."
rangers,37zgan,josephnicklo,3,Mon Jun 1 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"Ego would get in the way I'm sure BUT I'd love to see a mixture of Torts & AV to form some super mega head coach!   I loved how Torts would get fired up. I also loved how he wasn't afraid to bench star players when they sucked. Unfortunately, his system had more negatives than positives."
rangers,37zgan,josephnicklo,8,Mon Jun 1 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Let's face facts; this series probably would have looked a little bit  different with Marty on the bench and a healthy Zuccarello getting all of his minutes.  I know you can't whine about injuries, but..."
rangers,37zgan,candidly1,-5,Mon Jun 1 01:01:47 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, they had flat performances with Zucc in the lineup against the Caps.  Team just doesn't have any killer instinct."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,8,Mon Jun 1 04:06:13 2015 UTC,Zucc was injured vs. the caps dude..
rangers,37zgan,Snurrehus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:44:31 2015 UTC,That's right. I meant to say they still had flat games against the pens.   A bunch of 2-1 games isn't stupendous. They had a bunch of flat games to finish the season.
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"I think the physicality of the Pens and Caps probably would've neutralized Zucc as well.  Against the Bolts, I'm much less certain that Zucc couldn't have made a difference.  He brings a lot to the team, tangible and not.  He is creative, fiery, fearless.  All the things we seemed to be lacking in those critical spots."
rangers,37zgan,annihilus813,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"People keep saying ""if Zucc was back we'd have better offense and heart"".  Fine, maybe, but this is a team that won the first game then proceed to score score 5+ goals THREE times in the rest of a playoff series and lost. Tell me if you think in 7 games, if the Rangers score 21 goals while being shut out twice, would anyone say they'd lose that?  The problem wasn't offense, and it wasn't one forward."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,2,Mon Jun 1 23:27:30 2015 UTC,Zucc was out for the entire Caps and Bolts series...
rangers,37zgan,irishguy42,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:26:15 2015 UTC,Late night typo and brain fart.   They had flat games against the pens as well. A bunch of 2-1 games against a broken team wasn't compelling stuff.
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:48:54 2015 UTC,"I just saw Marty blow so many chances that I think Zucc would have buried, but you might be right.  I really expected more of an edge from Kreider and Hayes, I must admit.  After Stamkos ran Hayes in the corner, I figured Hayes would make it his mission to take his head off later on when he got the opportunity.  Nothing.  Maybe it's just not in this group..."
rangers,37zgan,candidly1,6,Mon Jun 1 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"He's got a point about Nash. Remember how great Nash played pissed off against Columbus a couple times. He was mad in his heart and he fucking took over. He should be doing that in the playoffs, especially the ECF game 7. Personal vendetta or not that's the Nash were paying 7.5 million for."
rangers,37zgan,Itscominrightforus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"This.  I think most Rangers fans would agree, that if there was a switch to throw on Nash for him to ""turn it on,"" we'd gladly keep this $7.5MM beast.  But his output is too unpredictable, and when he disappears he does a pretty damn thorough job."
rangers,37zgan,annihilus813,3,Mon Jun 1 21:15:29 2015 UTC,I just signed in to post this same thing. This was a great piece & younger fans should look up some of Nick's footage.  I'll start it with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYuVrk-RWV0&feature=youtu.be&t=2m13s
rangers,37zgan,JohninBK,3,Sun May 31 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"One criticism you can make of this is that the toughest team doesn't always win. We outhit Tampa Bat, but we still lost. Other than blocking more shots, I don't think ""grit"" is the issue with this team."
rangers,37zgan,ncolaros,-1,Mon Jun 1 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think people just mean hits when they say grit. They had no heart or toughness. They took metaphorical punches and folded.   I don't see this group ever winning without a shake up. Need a new coach for sure, a team playing that flat twice after a big win in the playoffs. Someone's head needs to roll."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,3,Mon Jun 1 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"Completely diagree, to be honest with you. The guy's been with us for two years, and he's taken us further than we've gotten in the last twenty."
rangers,37zgan,ncolaros,2,Mon Jun 1 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"Torts got the the ECF with a much worse team. The team this year won the presidents trophy so a berth in the ECF wasn't exactly over achieving.   The only two series he's won in less than 7 were Montreal with no goalie and Pittsburgh with the entire defense out. Every other series went 7 (except the SCF they looked horribly out coached in) and in only one of those five did they have a 3-2 lead. Hell two they were down 3-1.  With this collection of players, arguably the best defense and goalie in the league and solid forwards, that's the best he can do?  Add in the number of games the team just looked completely soulless on the ice (games 2,5,7 here, couple times against Washington, few games last year). Its just not acceptable.   It's not all his fault, the players also failed to motivate themselves or adjust. But you can find another motivator behind the bench. You can't fire the entire team."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,2,Mon Jun 1 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"Montreal's backup played just as well, if not better, than Price that series. You can't use that as an excuse. Likewise, if you wanna talk about injuries, we were missing Zucc and our Captain was playing on a broken foot. Meanwhile, TB was pretty much completely healthy. Getting rid of a coach who the players clearly love playing for would be a huge step backwards for this team. They've now had a whole year to work the system. If you get a new coach with a new system, that's gonna mess everything up. I guarantee we'd be worse with a new coach, no matter how good that coach is."
rangers,37zgan,ncolaros,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:49:20 2015 UTC,You don't know for sure if Tampa is 100% healthy though.   And Price would have been better.  Plus Zucc was there when they were barely beating Pittsburgh who was even more injured.
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:09:39 2015 UTC,Price pretty much couldn't have been better Go back and look at that guy's numbers. They were incredible. Better than Price has ever been in the playoffs.   Now go read the list of injured on the Rangers this year. Our top 3 defensemen were hurt.
rangers,37zgan,ncolaros,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"You forgot Staal's hairline ankle fracture and Girardi's sprained MCL.  And who knows what else.  TB's coach did say that a bunch of them had the flu Game 6.  And Cally's pre-series surgery.  Other than that, not a peep about injuries."
rangers,37zgan,annihilus813,0,Mon Jun 1 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"Agree with you, this was not the problem. He's been a great coach and done wonders for the team. It would be ridiculous to let him go when things are clicking. Yeah, not making the final sucked but we were damn close and I don't think coaching is why we didn't make it."
rangers,37zgan,sleipe,3,Mon Jun 1 04:31:58 2015 UTC,You're out of your god damned mind if you think the guy who walked into a brand new team and took them to the SCF and game 7 of the ECF in his first two years is the issue.
rangers,37zgan,Blitz93,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:41:00 2015 UTC,"Why?   Because a team doesn't show up for games they need to win multiple times in multiple playoffs. They give away leads.   It's quite possible with a better coach they're in the finals to defend the title. It's getting to the point that just going to the ECF and looking awful half the games is enough. With how skilled the team is an ECF berth this year wasn't really unexpected. So kudos for underperfoming?   I don't get it. They need a shakeup, theyve won 8 series in 4 years, with 2 coaches, 6 of them were 7 games. None were sweeps. They should be doing better. And since you can't fire half the team. Well."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"Lol yes, let's fire people just to fire people. That's a swell plan."
rangers,37zgan,Blitz93,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"What they have didn't work.   What do you want to do, go back to the playoffs with the same (older) team and a coach who really didn't get it done."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,2,Mon Jun 1 23:24:56 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. Let's fire the coach who's had about as much success as one can in his first two years without a Stanley cup and tear apart the roster and go back to the early 2000s dark age Rangers teams who never made the playoffs. This fan base is so beyond spoiled these last few years that it's laughable."
rangers,37zgan,Blitz93,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:32:30 2015 UTC,"And before that it was ""yes, lets fire a coach who got us back to the ECF for the first time in forever, this fan base is spoiled"".   What would you do to correct the abysmal lack of effort and massive outcoaching that happened in the playoffs this year (and to a lesser extent last year). What would you fix?  People aren't spoiled or entitled, they're impatient. The Rangers can't wait 2-3 more years to figure it out, next year might be do or die for it, maybe they already missed the window. The key players aren't getting younger, the salary issue isn't getting any better.   So do what, be a really good regular season team again next year and bow out with a whimper again? Maybe they can do that much another 2 or 3 times before they start struggling to make the playoffs. Although considering the rest of the division should be improved next year maybe sooner on the struggling.   It's not spoiled, it's ""do something, because we might have one more chance at best before it's the dark again again""."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:28:09 2015 UTC,And if you think firing the coach is that one move you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Good day sir.
rangers,37zgan,Blitz93,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"Well theres a few others that I'd want to do, but some of those are impossible due to salary and other issues.   I said it's one of the few you can do that would make a difference."
rangers,37zgan,PyreDruid,3,Wed Jun 3 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"Fotiu is not wrong, at all.   A message (by the coach) needed to be sent to unproductive players - in particular MSL.   Perhaps a benching would have made MSL step up - or at a minimum, light a fire under the rest of the team.   I also believe the Rangers are a finesse team that could be rattled by more aggressive teams. It was readily apparent during the Caps series. I'm not saying the Rangers need goons - but they do need a few versatile, heavy hitters. Such players could have gotten in the face of Johnson and Stamkos - and intimidated. Instead, these players were left unchecked - and carried on with their shenanigans.   A fourth line featuring Glass and another aggressive grinder could give us the grit we need to rattle other teams.   Fotiu is also right about size - smaller players (like Zucc) can be just as aggressive as bigger players. It comes down to heart."
rangers,37zgan,_TheConsumer_,2,Mon Jun 1 01:13:27 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a benching would have made MSL step up - or at a minimum, light a fire under the rest of the team.   AV <3's his stars. He's the polar opposite of Torts in almost every single way. Where Torts would bench an underperforming player (Richards for example) or straight up send them to the press box AV will just let it ride out for an entire playoff run, praying that the player snaps out of it..."
rangers,37zgan,josephnicklo,3,Mon Jun 1 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"There has to be a middle ground. After 10 games of limited production, an undisclosed ""day to day"" injury for MSL would send a proper message. Talk with him privately.   You don't need to go full Torts and call players out in the press in addition to benching them."
rangers,37zgan,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Even if it's just taking MSL off of the PP, that would've been a good ""first step"". I kept hearing/reading that it would ""ruin MSL's confidence"" but I don't buy that. The guy is a professional and has been around the block several times. If getting taken off of the PP destroys his confidence, well then maybe it really is time to hang the skates up."
rangers,37zgan,josephnicklo,2,Mon Jun 1 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"How about leaving Sheppard in the lineup for Game 7 and benching MSL?  Since MSL isn't scoring, you can argue that Sheppard provides much more spark in the lineup than MSL does.  And if you need a physical element to skate in the dirty parts of the ice, it's not going to be MSL."
rangers,37zgan,annihilus813,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:16:36 2015 UTC,"I had been saying what Nick said about toughness since christmas...the team had no balance..too many finesse guys that disappear once playoffs start...we blew it not getting Stewart when he was available to help balance out the fact we intimidated NOBODY...i was downvoted on here and told to go back to 1980...I was never saying goons, just more balance between grit and finesse..I wish i was wrong I really do. maybe things will be better next year..."
rangers,37zgan,enigmaman49,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:51:48 2015 UTC,Fotiu's right but he forgot to factor in injuries into his assessment. I'm pissed at those guys up front because none of them pressed hard to get to the net in a game 7.
rangers,37zgan,defiantgrit,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:42:29 2015 UTC,"Fotiu was critical of Rick Nash, who scored 42 goals in the regular season but only five in the playoffs. ""I would hear people say, 'At least he's playing defensive hockey.' No one cares about that,"" said Fotiu. ""Back-checking my (butt). Score some goals. ""He's a big guy, but he doesn't like to get in front. In the playoffs, usually guys are all cut up with black eyes and such; he didn't have a mark on him,"" said Fotiu of Nash. ""And he never shows any emotion. He doesn't jump around; he doesn't get mad.""   So, Fotiu says it and people agree with it but if someone reddit says it, they get downvoted to hell? Makes sense.  Anyway, Fotiu went all out with this and pretty much said what was on plenty of people's minds. I made a post earlier in the series about what it would take to stop Johnson and while he was kept somewhat quiet, his linemates still did a lot of damage...laying Johnson and playing physical with him was one of the frequent things that came up yet Fotiu is right, we never saw him getting layed out or fucked with and the same goes for Stamkos."

rangers,37zgan,sutsu,2,Mon Jun 1 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between gritty players and goons.   A gritty player is like Glass or Dorsett. These players have more than one dimension and can score/ contribute offensively.   A goon is Carcillo, Colton Orr or Krystof Oliwa. They contribute nothing other than being freight trains on skates.   The Rangers are a finesse team that needs a little punch. They need spark plugs that go out there, rattle a few bones and have some offensive threat."
rangers,37zgan,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"Lol I think Carcillo can contribute more than Glass tbh. Glass is the exact kind of grit that we don't need. Poorly timed hits that take him out of the play and don't really serve any major benefit.     I think the best kind of physicality can be seen in Hayes, Miller and (when he's not taking stupid penalties) Kreider. Those three are all incredibly strong on the puck and it makes them difficult to play against, but they're not running around and jeopardizing a play to throw a big hit. Also they actually have skill."
rangers,37zgan,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you - Kreider absolutely fits the ""physical/skillful"" mold, so does Miller.   I would like to see Hayes develop more of his physical play - he's a big body and could be a force on the ice.   I hated the way Glass played during the year. I really thought he stepped up in the playoffs - and was more of a contributor.   I really felt the Rangers were too finesse - and it showed during the Caps series. It seemed like every game, the Caps were steamrolling us. It was less apparent during the TB series - only because TB was our physical equal."
rangers,37zgan,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"You can be physical without throwing hits though. Hayes was a force when he drove to the net and parked himself in front of the goalie.    And I think the only difference with Glass is that he was a little bit less of a liability. He did start hitting a bit more responsibly but again, still not exactly the physicality that wins championships.    And lol I don't really think you can be ""too finesse."" Tampa and Chicago are proof of that."
rangers,37zgan,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:04:09 2015 UTC,"A goon is Carcillo, Colton Orr or Krystof Oliwa. They contribute nothing other than being freight trains on skates.   Pretty sure Carcillo did more than Glass in the playoffs last year."
rangers,37zgan,josephnicklo,2,Mon Jun 1 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"If it were up to me, goons would still be a major part of the game. They were a fun part of the game and added a wrinkle to a team's play.   But, in the new NHL, they have no place. IMO, Glass is a bit more versatile than Carcillo. That's not to say I didn't enjoy every shift of Carcillo in a Rangers uniform."
rangers,37zgan,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"Carbomb was so fun to watch! I honestly felt like when he was on the ice, there'd either be a fight, a goal scored or a scuffle of some sort.

rangers,38106w,SteamHole,3,Mon Jun 1 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"Another player to mention is Ryan Miller. Although he still has value to other teams  he really hasn't been the prime goaltender in recent years, he's 34. Like others have said, on average players tend to drop off in their mid 30's."
rangers,38106w,MagicSeat,6,Mon Jun 1 11:33:07 2015 UTC,"Because goalies start to decline in their mid 30s. Look at Brodeur for example. He was one of the best, and played a conservative style too.   People aren't saying he won't be able to play in a couple more seasons. But he probably won't be at that elite level where he can put the team in his backpack every game he is at now.   The next year or two are the best chance at cup because he will still be at that level."
rangers,38106w,TheCaptainRon,2,Mon Jun 1 04:33:15 2015 UTC,I'd say you got it. It's the ELITE aspect we're talking about after 35.  I think what leaves them is those reflex saves. The athletic saves that are goals against 90 percent of the goal tenders in the league. Those start to happen less and less so while the save percentage doesn't look like a huge drop off that's going to start adding a goal against where he might've had a shutout earlier in his career which can now take a win and make it a regulation or OT loss. Meaning like has been said he isn't able to carry the team.
rangers,38106w,stealth540,5,Mon Jun 1 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"Playing deep in the net also means he relies more on his reflexes to make saves compared to the average butterfly goalie who uses positioning. Your reflexes deteriorate more as you get older.   That being said, I think Lundqvist is adapting and relying on positioning when he makes the correct reads.  I really hope he works more on two areas: * (1) Stick Handling - I think this would help with clearing the zone effectively instead of weakly banking it off the glass. Also, great to initiate the offense. * (2) Positioning - Especially to challenge shooters off the wings."

rangers,38106w,Blitz93,7,Mon Jun 1 03:19:07 2015 UTC,And if the Rangers didn't get shutout maybe those goals don't matter in the end. They scored 4 goals in 4 Eastern Conference Finals home games and were shutout in two. That's absolutely pathetic and Hank is last on the list of people to blame.
rangers,38106w,NPHMctweeds,2,Mon Jun 1 05:50:25 2015 UTC,For the team to score no goals for hank in the final two home games of the ECF is a disgrace.
rangers,38106w,ANGR1ST,2,Mon Jun 1 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"Eh.  The last game was in big trouble when we failed to get a goal on two power plays early. It sucked the life out of the game. Need a little goal support before we bitch about the soft goals.  But that being said, there were a bunch of other soft goals that really did screw us earlier in the series."

rangers,38106w,johnjonah,2,Mon Jun 1 04:18:57 2015 UTC,"Nothing to do with that; he's just getting old.  Physically, it's not that gradual of a decline, either.  Speaking from personal experience, I was able to work out until I was in my early 30s or so without much decline, and then for the next couple of years, there was a noticeable difference in how much I could do (but not too bad)...and then sometime around age 37 it all fell to crap and everything was a lot harder.  Obviously I am not a world-class athlete, so I assume Hank can do a lot more than I can at those ages, but it's reasonable to wonder.  Happens to us all, sooner or later."
rangers,38106w,mexicaaaan,0,Mon Jun 1 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"Yes - I don't think the idea that hank will get old is astounding.    Nothing to do with that;   It has everything to do with that. No one posted this article two weeks ago. Give me a break. Trade Nash, trade Lundqvist, sacrifice MSL to the gods, merge boyle and yandle into one person... well the rangers must have just been kicked out of the playoffs!"
rangers,38106w,johnjonah,2,Mon Jun 1 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"Saying that Lundqvist is aging is not the same as moaning that ""the sky is falling,"" which is what you implied.  And no one is in favor of trading Hank, whereas everyone has been disappointed by MSL.  Even if the Rangers hoisted the Cup this year, people would still be saying that, unless he magically started scoring goals left and right in the Finals.  It's a little insulting to the rest of us to imply that having opinions about these things is somehow a shortcoming of the Rangers fanbase."
rangers,38106w,mexicaaaan,0,Mon Jun 1 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Hanks age is clearly not going to be a problem for years to come and nothing of his play suggests anything besides that. Yet this happens each year after we lose. If we won - people wouldn't be talking about how Lundqvist has limited years left... they'd be talking about how many more cups we can get before he has to retire.   I'm not saying it's wrong to have such opinions. I'm saying there is an intellectual dishonesty in not earnestly recognizing why it's a topic of a conversation. And frankly, sharing negative opinions is insulting to everyone, in my opinion.    And no one is in favor of trading Hank   you should read more comments in this subreddit as well as the articles posted in it because that's not what I've seen. This is the time of year when people talk about Hank's age (well that happens after he plays a bad game during the regular season too), and how a goalie with his cap hit makes it impossible to win the cup, etc."

rangers,3802nb,anesqguy,3,Mon Jun 1 03:02:30 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, this is going to get long...   Cam being our starter. I know a lot of us were concerned when he first went into the net, especially when he was letting up all those soft goals. The moment I really felt for him was when we went into that shootout with CBJ, and he made that last save with the most aggressive pokecheck. I feel like it was kind of a ""FUCK EVERYTHING"" kind of moment, because after that, he played absolutely wonderfully. I remember during the Panthers game (in March), he was called out as the first star, the crowd was chanting his name, and when he went back to the tunnel, I heard a lot of little kids shout, ""Talbot, Talbot!"" And admittedly, it actually made me tear up...couldn't help but be really happy for him that moment, y'know? Not to mention, he definitely deserved the Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award, of which was another great moment for me.  The first game against LA Kings. There was so much hype surrounding this game given the SCF last year which made it a little tough for me to watch (especially when we let in the two quick goals). However, the team came back when Boyle scored late in the first and we came out absolutely flying in the second. I remember the Kings had so much pressure for the last few minutes that when the game ended, my organs were ready to implode and I could not stop shaking. But still, it meant a lot to me that the guys were able to come out the way they did. Definitely an emotional game.  That fucking Rangers/Isles game. Holy shit. Everything about it was utterly insane in the most glorious hockey-kind of way. I'm pretty sure defense kind of went out the window that night with all the battling back and forth between the two teams. But me describing it would simply not do it justice. I loved the atmosphere by both fanbases, too. Seriously. I still grin like an idiot when I hear the duelling chants (courtesy /u/BetterCallStaal!) I thought Klein had a really stellar season with us. I still can't believe he took that Ovi shot point blank, basically (glad he's okay from that, though) and he had a ton of big goals for us. My favourite is probably the whole clipped ear thing + OT goal against the Pens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSLgKlRl6R4 Both the Skapski games. Looking in retrospect, when I think about them letting in a goal ~14 seconds in (poor guy), you can't help but laugh about it. I remember in a post-game interview, Staal even said something like, ""The hardest one to let in is the first one, so we'd figure we'd give him an easier time with it."" Heh. But really, he had such a young/sincere outlook to the game (eg. cheering every time our guys scored + celebrations) that it was really refreshing to see. I'm glad he had got the experience to play with us, though.      I could go on and on, but those are just a few of the highlights that come to mind for me. There is one more that is a bit more personal than a specific moment, which was when I went to my first Rangers game this year. Even thinking back to now, I can't help but feel super excited about it. I remember I was so jittery the night before and the day of, it was great seeing so many other hockey fans on the train, and stepping into the stands to feel that cool air was amazing. But I think the biggest moment was when I stood next to the glass and all of the guys came out for the warm-up. Honestly, I was shaking with excitement and I nearly teared up because to know they were all right there in front of me...it was just an unbelievable experience. I mean, you get so used to seeing the guys skating around on TV that you kind of forget that, well, they're real, haha.   It was great seeing the warm-up though. I couldn't believe how big they all were + how crazy it must be at ice level (they skate around so fast and pucks are flying everywhere). I also remember when Hank was in net, the guys were making quick shots at him. Zucc shot a puck in when Hank wasn't entirely ready (I think double tapped his try or something) and looked back with this shit-grin. Couldn't help but laugh at that a little. The other thing I found pretty amusing was during the game, when the guy next to me looked up Nash's stats and he just laughed at his photo saying something like, ""HAHA it looks like a middle school photo...oh my god. He needs to change it."" I got a good laugh out of that just because of how big [[NASHFACE]] is/was here.   All in all, it was great night. There was so much awesome scoring that night (plus a Glass fight, too!) and we ended up winning. Even though it was at an away game, there were a fair number of Rangers fans and it was great to receive acknowledgement from them. Don't get me wrong, everyone here is great, but to feel some of that camaraderie in person...it was just fucking amazing. I can't wait to see them again in person."

Just listless play and no direction, while Minnesota had their way in all aspects of the game. We booed them off the ice, and even the team would probably tell you that they deserved it.  And then they came out in the 3rd like they had just all taken a pull from the bottle of ""Michael's Secret Stuff"" from Space Jam, and played like GANGBUSTERS.  The crowd was delirious on the Klein and Nash goals to come back within 1. Then the Wild went right back down the ice and shoved one down our throats to shut us up... and then BRASS!! and then DUUUUUUC!! and then ZUUUUUC!! to finish her off.  It was such an emotional rollercoaster. Easily the most fun I've had at the Garden in a few years. I went on Steiner and was able to find a game used puck from that game."

rangers,380gvq,EarnSquirm,10,Sun May 31 23:02:05 2015 UTC,"Thought this was an excellent assessment of everyone's values for the first half of the article, but I thought the second half was a bit strange in two ways:   I get the logic of trying to trade Klein after a career year, but when we have three defensemen being overpaid, it seems strange that we'd get rid of one of the underpaid ones. I'm a fan of that Klein contract. He was solid this year and I think the injury was playing a role in the playoffs. I don't see us packaging all of our appealing pieces for a pick in the middle of the first round. This organization does not seem to place a lot of value on first round picks. Next year is probably the best chance we have of winning and I anticipate it will go downhill after that. I see Talbot and whoever else we move being traded for NHL-ready forwards."
rangers,380gvq,Darclite,5,Mon Jun 1 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, I could never see a Talbot+McIlrath+Klein for a #9 deal going down that would be ridiculous."

I think Klein is the most ""replaceable."" All those other guys contribute on PP or PK, while Klein only plays even strength minutes. Boyle, Girardi, Staal & McDonagh will be tough to move with their contract clauses. I think it's Klein by default, but I agree, I'm a big fan of his."

rangers,380gvq,PeteSamp27,2,Mon Jun 1 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"If they Marty walk, they shouldn't have to trade Klein to clear cap space. Not to mention that we will also will need Klein once Boyle is gone and if they cannot or choose not to resign Yandle after next year.  Now if someone blows them away by offering a young stud offensive player for Klein then so be it, but I see no point in trading him for anything less than a top 6 forward."
rangers,380gvq,blueshirtdave,2,Mon Jun 1 03:38:08 2015 UTC,Even if they let MSL walk and trade Talbot for a draft pick... they STILL can't afford everyone. The salary cap is only supposed to be around $71 million...
rangers,380gvq,thisaintnogame,2,Mon Jun 1 05:35:28 2015 UTC,"Very informative, and a good read!  Couple thoughts:     I can't see us trading Klein.  That was a steal, and his struggles in the post season were clearly due to the injury he suffered.  Trading him away would be an absolute moronic thing to do, given what he brings offensively, with still being very reliable defensively.  If we trade him now, why did we acquire him and sign him to that awesome deal in the first place?   I can definitely see Hags getting moved.  I love the guy, and certainly would hate to see him leave (and hate to face him on the ice), but he's not worth nearly $3 million in my opinion.  Yes, he scored a big goal to end the Pens series and is very fast.  But I can't even count how many times he fluffed on breakaways, or came up short offensively in the Caps or Bolts series.  His speed is a weapon, but other teams are scared of it, not him.  He's good for about 17 goals/17 assists a season, which is respectable, but not enough for $3 million a year.  Kreids makes less, and had 11 more points in the regular season and 4 more in the post-season.  He also uses his speed to good effect.   I thought Hunwick was very solid almost every time he was on the ice.  He's not going to light it up offensively, but he'll be very reliable on the blue line.  Personally, I'd love to see him take Boyle's spot full time, however that works out financially/physically.  Boyle's offensive capability is there, but he's a liability on defense, and we have Yandle to ""handle"" the quarterbacking.  Once Yandle set in to the powerplay, we got a LOT better.   Talbot will be traded, 100% sure of it.  I love the guy and hate to see him go, but he deserves a starting spot, and it's unlikely Hank is going to pick up another injury of such duration.  We can sign a solid backup, trade Cam, and free up a mil or so cap space.  No sense in not taking such a deal.     *** Unrelated note: While the article was awesomely detailed and very informative, it was grammatically pretty poor, and could've done with a proof-read.  Several times I had to stop and re-read a sentence to figure out what the blogger was trying to say.  Not meaning to be harsh, but it's something I noticed."
rangers,380gvq,berdman11,2,Mon Jun 1 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your assessments on both Klein and Hagelin for reasons of possession stats. I understand that stats like possession are not 100% bullet-proof but I think Hagelin is one of the Rangers better players in terms of shot attempts for and against. His speed really gives us a third line with solid forechecking ability. Plus he is a top pair for penalty killing, which is something that should not be overlooked. I really hope we keep him.   And similarly, I think Klein had a great year and we might be wise to sell high on him. His deal looks amazing right now because his stats were so good this year but if he regresses to his mean performance, then it's just an OK deal. Might be a good idea to trade him for a team that really needs some defensive pieces."
rangers,380gvq,blueshirtdave,3,Mon Jun 1 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this. Hagelin's value is not in his scoring, but in his possesion play, PK skills and speed. He was one of the few who was going 100% every game in the playoffs. He's a huge piece of the puzzle. I think it's time to sell high on Klein. Either Brady Skjei or Hunwick  can slot into his spot. We should look to package Talbot and Klein for a dynamic winger like Yakupov."
rangers,380gvq,josephnicklo,3,Mon Jun 1 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but think Klein is a vital piece of the defensive core.  I can think of quite a few big mistakes Mac, G, Staal, Yandle, and Boyle have all made that have directly cost us games.  However, I can only think of maybe 1 or 2 bad KK plays.    I guess my counter point then is that if we're saying he's putting up great stats and has a sweet contract, why would we trade him away and start over with filling his slot in the D line?  That seems like backwards logic to me. Yes, he could degrade in stats, but what if he doesn't?  He was 14th in the NHL in +-, and had a career year last year.  What if next year is even better?  Do we trade him away and hope he sucks?  Or do we see how things go next year?  I'm a big believer in momentum, much more than stats by themselves.  He'll be motivated to come back from the injury and put up big numbers again.  And he knows he's on a winning team that can get back to the SC Final, so that will help.  I just don't see the logic in giving away a position we need help in.    At the end of the day, we'd be trading him away and hope to get the same thing back, only cheaper.  Would anyone trade Fast (805,000) for another winger around the same age for $705,000 and hope he's as good?  Of course not.  If we have something that works, why try and change it?  Yes he ties up 2.9mil, and that's a chunk for non 1st line Dman.  But he's one of the best.    As for Hags, here's the thing.  Yes, he's great with possession, but that's only half the game.  Arsenal is good at retaining the ball in the Premier League, and only had less possession than their opponents 3 times from 2004-2013.  That's almost 400 games.  Their trophy haul?  Zero.  They just in the last 2 years began winning something occasionally.  My point is, you can retain possession and keep the opposition from getting shots, but at the end of the day, you have to capitalize.  Hags had the worst shooting percentage (9.20) of all our forwards this season, with the only exceptions being Moore (8.60) and Glass (1.90).  For someone who is able to create space and breakaways like he does, he has a poor shooting percentage.  And it's not just the percentage, it's whether he actually scores.  Zucc was right above him at 9.70, but scored 14 more points in 4 fewer games.  So even though they both shot about the same percentage, the reality is that Zuccy was putting 'em in the net or on a teammate's tape, and Hags was simply failing to produce points.    He's stellar on the PK, and has speed - that's the only two things he brings to the table, in my opinion.  If he shot at a higher percentage, he'd score more.  If he found an open teammate with regularity, he'd score more.  The simple fact of the matter is that he's Luis Mendoza.  He has all the speed anyone could dream of, and nowhere to go once he gets there.  Also, Kreider (46) and Hayes (45) both scored more points than Hags (35) during the regular season, and both in fewer games.  They also both outscored him in the playoffs. Heck, Marty (7 pts) and Boyle (10pts) both scored more than Hags (5 pts), and had fans calling for their heads the entire time.  For that matter, if Kleiner and G had each recorded only 1 more point, then all the Dmen aside from Staal would've either tied or outscored Hags.  That's just not good enough for him.  Again, I love the kid, but he's not producing what he should be for 3 million.  Cheers though on the discussion!"

rangers,37yjrc,coolman1581,0,Mon Jun 1 14:24:30 2015 UTC,Wow really showing your class ranger fans
rangers,37yjrc,doitforthewoods,-4,Mon Jun 1 15:51:58 2015 UTC,Aspergers confirmed.
rangers,37yjrc,mexicaaaan,5,Mon Jun 1 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar school of thought right now.  There are other teams with more young talent than us, which scares me and we had a number of guys have career years this year which I'm not sure we can count on to happen consistently.  I hate to say it, but this might have been the year we were going to win it all.    Of course, as we've seen, we can be mediocre in the regular season and still get hot at the right time and steal a Cup so not all hope is lost."

rangers,37yjrc,ChaseTheBear,16,Mon Jun 1 00:17:34 2015 UTC,Gotta say from what we've seen of McIlrath so far my confidence is low but I am still holding out hope. We could really use the size.
rangers,37yjrc,themongoose85,3,Sun May 31 14:41:49 2015 UTC,same here. hopefully im wrong but 10th pick for an enforcer is just too much
rangers,37yjrc,BadSeedling,5,Sun May 31 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"Don't be hopeful, you aren't wrong. That 10th pick was a complete waste."
rangers,37yjrc,F_urOpinion,6,Sun May 31 20:37:17 2015 UTC,Brady Skjei is more likely to have an impact next season than McIlrath    Edit: That isn't a knock against McIlrath either since I heard he's been solid for the Wolfpack. Skjei is just really good.
rangers,37yjrc,tj_sad_boi_666,8,Sun May 31 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for the years to come. We have one hell of a coach and core. The thought of Yandle having a full camp with the boys has me so excited. I expect him to be a monster next year.  At the start of this year I thought we were a better team than the year before and still think that turned out to he true. Between the maturation of the young guys and probably not losing anyone significant, I see no reason why we can't be even better."
rangers,37yjrc,dakraiz,6,Sun May 31 14:19:20 2015 UTC,It's possible that Yandle will have a monster season next year now that he is more comfortable with AV's system.  Should be fun to watch!
rangers,37yjrc,IzBox,3,Sun May 31 17:01:38 2015 UTC,I have high hopes for Yandler
rangers,37yjrc,YandlerTheManHandler,7,Sun May 31 19:55:16 2015 UTC,He was tied with Nash for most assists in the playoffs for us.  He was awesome this series. I think playing with the other guys will make him a better defender.
rangers,37yjrc,bearvsshaan,8,Sun May 31 14:21:48 2015 UTC,"other teams will close the gap, but hockey is flukey. this isn't the nba, where one player going to a team guarantees them a finals appearance.  lightning and islanders can be better than teh rangers next year, but that does not guarantee that they will advance further than them at all.  think 8 years ago, to 2007. everyone in the world thought the penguins were a surefire dynasty - crosby, staal, malkin, MAF, orpik, solid role players.  they got won cup and nothing else for that core.  you never know what will happen.   one thing I will say is that a lot of this hinges on how hank is giong to age. i pray he's a roy/belfour/hasek type of aging goalie."
rangers,37yjrc,KMFCM,4,Sun May 31 16:46:10 2015 UTC,yup.  Rangers were #1 in the league  Ducks were #1 in the league  neither made the final

rangers,37yjrc,tj_sad_boi_666,32,Mon Jun 1 01:35:44 2015 UTC,For fucks sake Dan Boyle was good this season. I can't wrap my head around how so much of this sub thinks he's bad.
rangers,37yjrc,devilslefthand,10,Sun May 31 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. He was brought in solely for his offensive game. 20 points in 65 games and only 3 PP goals is not acceptable for a guy that doesn't play D well. Not sure why you love him so much, but the Bolts were smiling every time he touched the ice."
rangers,37yjrc,Robotron_25,4,Sun May 31 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"I think he had a good year, it's just that everyone always expects so much from every player. There's no such thing as a team that doesn't make mistakes, he made a few bad ones but without him we don't make the ECF, he had some timely goals."
rangers,37yjrc,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Sun May 31 17:39:26 2015 UTC,He was brought in because he's a good defenseman. He led the team in corsi in both the regular season and the playoffs. He was pretty much our only defenseman who was positive against the triplets and was one of only a few who was positive against Stamkos
rangers,37yjrc,mexicaaaan,-1,Sun May 31 20:01:20 2015 UTC,yeah - but did you see the fear in his eyes anytime he had to do anything?

rangers,37yjrc,devilslefthand,7,Mon Jun 1 02:45:11 2015 UTC,If we could trade Dan Boyle to a team looking for a veteran defenseman to mentor their young players I would be soooo happy

rangers,37yjrc,Phat_Tony_Crew,2,Sun May 31 15:27:13 2015 UTC,We failed this year mainly because our best scorer didn't perform well and our coaching staff didn't have a solid offensive game plan. I obviously wouldn't consider getting rid of Vigneault but we need someone who runs an effective power play.
rangers,37yjrc,irishguy42,3,Sun May 31 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"Can someone play devils advocate for me and explain the rationale that our team is washed up, and we have no young talent? On top of the young guys listed by OP, and the guys in their prime, it just seems like wishywashy talk by our rivals' fan bases."
rangers,37yjrc,PeteSamp27,4,Sun May 31 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"The ""No Young Talent"" comment is mostly from people who saw us trade Duclair, and not know what our prospect pool looks like.  Fair enough that they don't know who is upcoming in our system in most places aside from the AHL or QMJHL. But I feel like a lot of people forget that other leagues exist, and more prospects come from there. Hence, they don't know that our prospect pool is deeper than three people.  And somehow, having a bunch of current players that are 27 or younger means they don't count towards our ""young talent"""
rangers,37yjrc,patton66,1 point,Sun May 31 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of good young players in the NHL already, but we are rather thin on potential offensive stars in the system. Basically it's just Buch and maybe Tambellini, but he is more of a long shot.  We also sure have to hope Russia doesn't enact that law that would prevent Buch from coming over here until he is 28"
rangers,37yjrc,TheCaptainRon,8,Sun May 31 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"there is no rationale, they are just salty. hearing that our team is ""Washed Up"" (Nash, mostly, with Marty they aren't 100% wrong...) and that we have ""No Young Talent"" (look at OP's text, Step, Zucc, Brass, Kried, Miller are all under 27, I dont know if any of them have even Peaked yet) is just salty fans being salty. the only real liability, and pains to say, is Hank, he's got maybe 3 more seasons to play at his level before he becomes an issue, especially with his salary"
rangers,37yjrc,Enzo95,5,Mon Jun 1 03:42:23 2015 UTC,It is a terrible thought but I remember reading somewhere goalies tend to drop off pretty heavily after 35-36. Now the fact that Hank doesn't rely purely on reaction and highlight real saves should help. But end of the day the chances of Hank playing like Hank after 36 aren't great and that is a bummer. Then again its hard to count Hank out ever so lets hope for the best
rangers,37yjrc,mexicaaaan,4,Sun May 31 17:52:16 2015 UTC,I dont think Hank has only 3 more seasons to play at his high level. The guy has a fantastic work ethic and is very competitive. He's not injury prone and has a healthy lifestyle. I bet Hank will play like this until his late 30s.   Let's hope '94 isn't the new '40.
rangers,37yjrc,ESEADupes,1 point,Sun May 31 20:32:53 2015 UTC,honestly - some of the talk by rangers fans here seems like wishywashy nonsense from another team's fans.   there is a guy a few posts above you talking about how much Girardi sucks!
rangers,37yjrc,LIGuy631,4,Sun May 31 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Nothing is gonna change until we have a forward(s) that can step up in the playoffs the way Henrik does. When your 1st line center who is on the line to be the play maker is the one scoring 9 goals and your 43 goal scorer has 5 (3 garbage goals that had 0 impact on their respective games) we aren't going to win anything. This team scored 9 goals against a Pittsburgh team that was starting 3 AHL defensemen.   Hagelin might not even get resigned because of MSL (although letting him go would be a huge mistake), Buchnevich is playing in the KHL for this upcoming season, Mcllrath has been nothing more than a bust from what we saw this season. On top of all that we have 1.45m worth of cap space being used in the form of Tanner Glass. To work with what we got I imagine were gonna have to sign the young guys (Hayes, Fast, Miller in that order) to short term 1.5m/year contracts. Ontop of those 3 guys we need to resign Stepan and Kreider and I doubt they'll be cheap.  With the improvement of the Eastern conference teams (Ottawa, Tampa Bay, Panthers, Islanders, Capitals, Blue Jackets assuming they don't get fucked by injuries and Penguins getting healthy) all I imagine is us going back to the good old fighting to get that 8th spot and just getting into the playoffs like we have been before this and last year. If we're lucky I imagine us having 1 really solid attempt left in us but even them I'm skeptical and fully prepared for more 1 and out playoff runs coming up."
rangers,37yjrc,irishguy42,9,Mon Jun 1 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"Other than Tampa and the Islanders, I really doubt any of those teams will be closing the gap on us next year"
rangers,37yjrc,rangersmetsgiants27,9,Sun May 31 15:45:04 2015 UTC,The Isles are going to be a monster contender next season.
rangers,37yjrc,mexicaaaan,5,Sun May 31 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Islanders will be scary for the upcoming seasons. They scary right now."
rangers,37yjrc,ChaseTheBear,1 point,Sun May 31 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think the Isles will be good but I can't see them being all that much better than this year. Halak is mediocre and they have a shitty coach, so it all rests on young players improving for them."

rangers,37yjrc,Enzo95,2,Sun May 31 21:42:51 2015 UTC,Washington is going to resign Holtby (already have?) who has proven himself as an elite goaltender this past post season. CBJ went on a tear at the end of the season when they were all healthy. A 14 game win streak or something along those lines. Tampa is in the Stanley Cup Finals while we're at home watching. Islanders beat us 3/5 times last season. Penguins made the playoffs while starting 3 AHL defensemen and Fleury is more consistent than he's ever been. Ottawa went on a tear at the end of the season going like 25-2 and just resigned a potential star goalie and have a young star (Mark Stone). Frankly the only reason they didn't beat Montreal is because they got bullshitted by the officiating. Panthers we're on a playoff run towards the end of the season but just couldn't close it out. They're the only ones I would count out to be honest. The Eastern conference is the best it's been in years and we are in trouble.
rangers,37yjrc,Franz_Kafka,0,Sun May 31 20:15:28 2015 UTC,"Washington is good and they could get even better if Kusnetsov and Burakovsky turn out to be studs. But Ovi and Backstrom are getting older and they'll probably let Green go. Columbus should be good but can we really be sure based on just a late winning streak after being eliminated? Tampa is going to be very good for a long time assuming they resign Stamkos and keep the triplets together The Penguins are older and seriously restricted by the salary cap. They have no serious youth coming up. As of right now, they're probably done as a serious contender unless they make some serious changes. The Islanders are young but they have serious depth issues on the blue-line and an overrated goalie.  Ottawa has a lot of young guys but they only made the playoffs because a journeyman goalie caught fire. He won't do that again.  Panthers are too young to be a serious contender yet.   Really, the only teams I can take seriously right now are the Caps, Isles, Bolts, and Habs."
rangers,37yjrc,ESEADupes,0,Sun May 31 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"The worst move by Sather in this decade was giving our future for MSL. What a huge mistake, a wasted 1st pick. Maybe we can reshape this roster to give Hank a chance in the final years of his career, but for now, I agree, our window has closed.   Unless Sather magically can get rid of Nash's contract and some of our prospects turns out to become a world class talent, I dont see us improving over other eastern conference teams."
rangers,37yjrc,FLRangerFan,9,Mon Jun 1 00:31:28 2015 UTC,Gets rid of Nash's contract.... He was second in goals in the league this year and it was his personal career high. What the fuck are you talking about?
rangers,37yjrc,Enzo95,5,Sun May 31 16:43:33 2015 UTC,He can score 93 goals next regular season and beat Wayne's record but he's useless if he cant score in the playoffs.
rangers,37yjrc,MFitz24,1 point,Sun May 31 16:56:44 2015 UTC,Trade him for Kessel who will show up in the playoffs
rangers,37yjrc,Enzo95,1 point,Sun May 31 17:14:59 2015 UTC,That's great and all but he also has 10 goals in 60 playoff games. I don't think we need to get rid of his contract but his inability to preform in he playoffs is already obvious.
rangers,37yjrc,artvandelay1994,2,Sun May 31 22:27:16 2015 UTC,We were 2 wins away from winning the cup last year. We would of never made it that far without Marty.
rangers,37yjrc,F_urOpinion,6,Sun May 31 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"We made that far but we didn't DO IT. That's the problem. People says that the Blackhawks window is also closing and the penguins did not get their dynasty like many believed they would get, but they won the fuckin Cup (the Hawks did it twice and probably will get another). We're the fucking New York Rangers, not the Winnipeg Jets who are supposed to get happy cause ""we made far"".   I dont know you guys, but for me a successful season is the one you win the Stanely Cup, everything other than that, is failure for me. We cant fucking buy a Cup. You guys can keep downvoting me, I dont care, not losing money on it. It's the truth guys, I love this team but we have to face it. Without a fucking goal scorer who can perform in the playoffs, a generational talent like Toews, we're going anywhere. Poor Hank cant score goals. And the fucking goals are the ones who wins games.  Unless Nash does something different this offseason like he did last year (losing weight), I dont know, he's not our guy in the playoffs. And in a salary cap league you get rid of guys who cant get the job done.   But what I know, I'm just a fan who desperately wants to see this team winning. Just my 2 cents. Now go and downvote me."
rangers,37yjrc,F_urOpinion,3,Sun May 31 17:43:02 2015 UTC,Would you consider a bottoming out and a top pick to be a successful season? That's basically the only way to get a generational talent without ruining your cap situation or future.
rangers,37yjrc,wsc3,5,Sun May 31 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"Tanking is not the answer, at least it's not anymore, see the Sabres who lost what possibly will be the best player in the last 20 years. Also we're not bad enough to do it.   Maybe we can lure the best scouts in the world. The Red Wings built their successful winning campaigns in the last 15 years without 1st picks. Hell, we got Hank in the 205th overall. Jeff Gorton is one of the guys responsible for our post lockout success (only not good enough to get us a Cup). I'm pretty sure there are more Jeff Gorton like guys out there ready to find us those hidden gems."

Gaborik, Richards, Nash, Marty, and in the next 3 seasons or so its very possible that Krieder, Step or Brass turn into a Backstrom type player. any of them could wear a C on their chest in their early 30's. They'll never be a ""Scotty Pippen"", but the Salary Cap seems to be making sure that that can't happen on a team (Kane/Toews being the exception, but we'll see what the next few weeks/months/seasons bring). oh, did the author forget about rebound juggernaut Dennis Rodman as well? 90's Bulls had depth, it wasnt just MJ and Pippen.  the problem isn't the lack of a star player, its that for 60 minutes on Friday, our stacked, deep team wasnt able to produce, and that in those 3 OT games in the last SCF, a few pucks made some shitty bounces. Chicago also has Keith and Hossa, TBL has the Triplets, as everyone else is saying on this thread, its not a 1-2 punch that wins in the NHL, its full scale depth. heck, look at MTL; Price-Subban is absolutely star power, but their lack of Offense from everyone else kept them out of the ECF  decent article, interesting point, but i dont really agree with what hes trying to say and how hes saying it"
rangers,37yrk5,patton66,2,Sun May 31 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but it is pretty naive of you to think that Brassard, Stepan or Krieder can turn into a player of Backstrom's caliber. Backstrom has been one of best (and criminally underrated) centers in the NHL his entire career. He's been scoring at just about a PPG since he made it into the league. Krieder and Stepan aren't gonna be making such a huge jump in a few years. Especially not Brassard who is the same age is Backstrom and had less points in his best season than Backstrom had in his worst full season (while he was a rookie)."
rangers,37yrk5,beardlessdick,3,Mon Jun 1 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"you're probably right, sorry for using hyperbole like that"
rangers,37yrk5,patton66,7,Mon Jun 1 01:23:47 2015 UTC,short answer no.    Long answer noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
rangers,37yrk5,speedk0re,18,Sun May 31 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"This isn't the NBA. You need a whole team to win. Crosby has Malkin yet they've won just one Cup, a disappointment considering the hype the Pens always get. Ovi has Backstrom and they haven't won yet. Stamkos has Johnson yet I'd be surprised if they beat the Blackhawks, who have a whole team around Toews and Kane. The NBA comes down to who your #1 man is and how good his #2 is. Everyone else on your team just watches."
rangers,37yrk5,NJ_Yankees_Fan,6,Sun May 31 15:36:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We've seen teams who can roll 4 deep go far in the postseason.   I used to be a huuuuge Knicks fan and Patrick Ewing is far away and my favorite athlete of all time. But in an era of dominant centers, Ewing wasn't the best. Hank, since he first graced The Garden ice 10 years ago, has been the best goalie in the NHL. If he goes by the way of Ewing, I don't even know. I hate even entertaining the idea that the Rangers may need to do some Ray Bourque type shit and trade him to a legit Cup contender before it's too late."
rangers,37yrk5,otter_pop_n_lock,-2,Sun May 31 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't happen in the next two seasons I hate to say it but I want to see Lundqvist traded.   I want to see him retire as a Ranger, but I want him to get a cup more."
rangers,37yrk5,MagicSeat,6,Sun May 31 18:09:50 2015 UTC,Oh please
rangers,37yrk5,Sailor_Chris,6,Sun May 31 20:09:36 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't win as a Ranger, I don't want him winning a Cup...  well, I do want him winning a Cup, but with the Rangers"
rangers,37yrk5,m4tuna,14,Sun May 31 21:14:43 2015 UTC,Wholeheartedly disagree here. To win an NBA final you need a full squad to eat minutes for your top players.
rangers,37yrk5,NJ_Yankees_Fan,5,Sun May 31 16:16:18 2015 UTC,"With the exception of last year's Spurs and the 2011 Mavs, how many teams have recently won with a deep roster? Most of them win by having 2-3 or more stars, because they all play like 35 minutes or more and make your role players better."
rangers,37yrk5,veebs7,2,Sun May 31 20:05:12 2015 UTC,We just saw the Heat win 2 championships in 4 years with a sub-par team outside of the Big 3
rangers,37yrk5,BrownKidMaadCity,6,Mon Jun 1 05:16:25 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. Why do Hockey fans always feel like they need to be constantly defending their sport by putting other sports down? Its all over /r/hockey too.
rangers,37yrk5,JohnnyVNCR,2,Sun May 31 18:37:58 2015 UTC,It's the little brother effect. The less attention you get the more you become a whore.
rangers,37yrk5,johnjonah,5,Mon Jun 1 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"This may only be a reflection of my own opinions, but the age of writing this sort of sports analysis without any supporting statistical data is over.  Without it, the ""analysis"" is no better than the rant of the guy next to you in the bar.  The closest Bondy came to providing data was to point out that teams like Pittsburgh and Tampa had two or more stars (although he failed to mention that the Rangers defeated those same two Pittsburgh stars in the first round, and that Tampa was one third period away from being eliminated by those same Rangers).  The rest of the time he gives a brief transaction history that everyone is already aware of.  Ultimately he's not saying much more than ""The Rangers need to improve the team,"" which isn't saying much.  I'm not gonna be sad when that generation of sportswriters retires."
rangers,37yrk5,ismele,8,Sun May 31 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"A dynamic goal-scorer that shows up reliably - in both the regular and post- season - would certainly be nice. But the article says it: we don't have draft picks and we don't have cap space.   Like the author says, winning with this team isn't an impossible task. We could have done it this year - truthfully, in this series against Tampa, I feel like we lost more than they won. Anyway, this team is really Lundqvist's only chance - hopefully the young guys continue developing and next year we're even better.  The #1 and #2 aren't enough or Crosby and Malkin will win every year. Hawks have Kane and Toews, sure, but look at that supporting cast. We may not have a star like Kane or Stamkos or Crosby but I think we have a very balanced team, which is another kind of threat."
rangers,37yrk5,darkdrgon2136,5,Sun May 31 15:44:10 2015 UTC,"We have the players to win, the team is good. There's just some basic stuff they need to practice more consistently.  Don't pass into double coverage,  use your speed, get in front of the net, bring everyone in on the forecheck and don't keep your d-men on the red line"
rangers,37yrk5,coolbeansburnz14,4,Sun May 31 17:03:47 2015 UTC,And we gotta clear the puck much better.
rangers,37yrk5,IzBox,2,Sun May 31 20:13:08 2015 UTC,Basketball sucks now but I was a huge Ewing fan as a kid.  He deserved better and so does Hank.  Let's hope that changes in the next few years.
rangers,37zkoe,BadSeedling,5,Sun May 31 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"When our forechecking is strong we dominate.  We just need more players who do that with vigor, and more consistently.  It's no surprise, we got clobbered on physicality last year with the Kings, and this year we declined to return the favor against small but talented teams."
rangers,37zkoe,IzBox,8,Sun May 31 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not like Detroit and Chicago are perennial contenders. Also who on the Bolts is even remotely tough? We didn't get pushed around. We got shut out twice at home. The finals will have two teams that don't exactly strike fear in anyone with how they fight back. We all know that Brian Boyle's a gentle giant, and the only other guys on the Bolts who ever drop the gloves are Paquette and an ancient Morrow. The guys on Chicago's playoff roster accumulated a grand total of 10 major penalties throughout the regular season and playoffs.  The cup winners in the past eight years, including whoever wins this one, have tended to be teams that fight less (aside from Boston). If you wanna look at goal differential, scoring depth, balance, and Fenwick, all of those are pretty influential regressors. But ""yo just be tougher"" is the textbook example of bad hockey analysis, and yet we always hear it after every failed season because there's a large percentage of hockey fans who would prefer a team of Prusts instead of a team of Zuccarellos"
rangers,37zkoe,Darclite,5,Sun May 31 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"Please re-watch the Caps series. We were pushed around, badly.   We were lightyears ahead of the Caps in skill. Their physicality made it a close series.   We don't need goons - there's no room for that in hockey anymore. But we need more physical players - guys who hit hard by nature, stick up for teammates and ensure parts of the ice are ""off limits"" for other teams."
rangers,37zkoe,_TheConsumer_,4,Mon Jun 1 01:53:23 2015 UTC,And Holtby. Don't forget Holtby. Dude went all brick wall and kept the Caps in it
rangers,37zkoe,MagicSeat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:38:14 2015 UTC,"Holtby did a great job. But, going into the series I figured that if we could shut down Ovi, we would win in 5.   The Caps physical play took a serious toll on us, and exposed our weaknesses.   We need physical players to counter some of these teams."
rangers,37zkoe,_TheConsumer_,2,Mon Jun 1 16:04:58 2015 UTC,but you dont have to fight to be gritty. zuc is not soft at all
rangers,37zkoe,lespaul210,3,Sun May 31 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're not talking about being like the Hanson Twins, but just being a little tougher, take the body more. I don't think a strong defense can use more way finesse than grit, but a healthy mix gets the job done. The rangers' forecheck and backcheck had it's moments, but it wasn't consistent enough... Hence the lack of scoring in the first two rounds. Alain Vigneault made a grave mistake in telling his team to not play tough, to turn the other cheek, and it cost us our run at the cup. I can't help but blame him now for our team's effort in game 7."
rangers,37zkoe,Jwpt,3,Sun May 31 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, with Pittsburgh we didn't need tough, with the caps thats playing into their game. However the lighting we absolutely should have been more chippy with. It was quite a reaction from the triplets (Johnson especially) when we started to."

We consistently get less penalties than other teams because we play smart hockey. The idea that our players are mental midgets who's will will be destroyed because they got hit hard is idiotic"
rangers,37zkoe,Darclite,3,Mon Jun 1 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"It always reminds me of my uncle who would bitch that we would give ice time to Zuccarello instead of Brandon fucking Mashinter.

If it was as simple as ""be tougher, take the body, finish checks"" then we could fire all the coaches in the NHL. Kane, Toews, Keith, Hossa, etc. are all known for their skill, smarts, and finesse, not their toughness, and they beat Anaheim who's fucking humongous and hits as hard as anyone.

It's like if your team got outshot 50-5 every game and lost 1-0 every game and you conclude your goalie is the problem.

Then you'll try to cheer everyone up and it'll work for like five seconds and then you'll remember that you just got eliminated in the CFs game 7 and you'll back to square one.  TL;DR- drink whatever makes you blackout until the season is over

They'll give your team no credit and circlejerk around the other. They'll make it seem like an embarrassing sweep instead of the hard fought 7 game series. Also everclear helps. You'll focus on the burning more than the loss

Another example of a bush league move - worrying about filling your home arena in the playoffs with your own fans.  I understand the Florida teams have unique challenges, but they've been in the league for awhile now. They have at least two generations of home grown fans to work with. Why is filling your arena with home fans still a concern?  Anyway, were they actually able to enforce that policy? I wasn't really paying attention."

rangers,37x2nq,DicNavis,6,Mon Jun 1 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, to me it's more about the Cup itself. TB fans are about as wayward as it gets. I really hate watching a team win a Cup and the fans care for about as long as it takes to announce the NFL schedule or whatever. I know a few TB fans and they even admit they only care and bother to learn the names of their players if they have a decent season.   That's 1.   2: The ex Rangers and the big deal about it all. It's very bitter and in bad taste and I'm completely in the wrong, but fuck Cally and fuck Boyle and, well if they win the Cup I don't hate Stralman so there's that. He's alright.  3: the way we fucking played. We made Bishop look better than he actually is. He's solid, but he's the worst goaltender we've faced all playoffs. We lost that series more than they won it, if that makes sense. And I really hate watching teams win a Cup because their opponent is bad. It's not fucking Lombardi after all."

rangers,37x2nq,tomj,4,Sun May 31 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"Callahan got more respect here than he ever deserved, he's a glorified 3rd line winger who got to where he was because of Tortorella's system. Than he fucked us midseason by not agreeing to a contract that probably overpaid him a bit. People like to remember the way he played but the guy's a dick."
rangers,37x2nq,sizeablescars,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:12:55 2015 UTC,"For me, I don't necessarily hate the team. Rather, it's just some interactions with fans that I can't deal with, and unfortunately, it translates over to the team at times (mind you, this isn't strictly Tampa and can be said for many others). It sucks because it can make it difficult for you to be happy for your favourite players on other teams.   There's just been a lot of vitriol between the two of us given the players that have been swapped around. I realize a lot of hate is directed moreso to the players than us but...I dunno. When they talk that much shit about them/your club it's hard not to feel a bit weird about it at times. And then when the opposing team succeeds in some way, I feel like it ends up giving them even more leverage which some people kind of go overboard with.   I mean, I realize that chirps/shit-talking is to be expected, but sometimes I feel like there's a line a lot of people cross."

rangers,37x2nq,rangersmetsgiants27,2,Sun May 31 20:22:56 2015 UTC,Hawks fans aren't new to other teams trying to keep them from over running their arena. Nashville instilled a similar rule that only people from TN can buy tickets there cause the Hawks regularly over run Bridgestone during the regular season. Plus the size of their fan base I think there is a solid chance they show up in full force.

Other than that, I'll just move on to the Yankees, maybe learn a little about soccer and follow NYCFC. I found Tampa to be a surprisingly unfun team to watch play, and since hearing pierres voice may drive me to unthinkable violence, I won't be watching the finals. If TB even takes the finals to a game 6, I'd be shocked. Only thing is the Chi D is probably exhausted.

rangers,37xdye,ncolaros,8,Sun May 31 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, there's no reason not to re-sign him unless it affects signing Hags or Miller.   But it will. The Rangers will have roughly 12 mil in cap space, of which 6 is going towards Stepan. That other 6 has to be divided between Fast, Miller, Hagelin, and MSL if they go that option.   I think it's safer to let MSL walk, and bring up a guy like Lindberg for the 3rd/4th line with a 750k cap hit instead of MSL's 5+/mil  So to your original thread title, I'd be in favor of keeping him if it didn't affect the rest of signing the younger core players...but there's not a snowballs chance in hell it won't affect them  EDIT: also a possibility of Sather working some trade magic to make some extra cap room"
rangers,37xdye,bjisba41,0,Sun May 31 14:35:57 2015 UTC,I imagine MSL will take a huge pay cut in order to stay in New York. I don't see him signing for more than 1.5 or at most 2 mil.
rangers,37xdye,peskysens,4,Sun May 31 16:42:16 2015 UTC,sorry to say but I doubt a guy rocking 52 points is going to sign for 1-2Mil. Especially as it will be one of his last years playing.

rangers,37xdye,artvandelay1994,3,Sun May 31 23:05:57 2015 UTC,I don't doubt he cares about his family.. I doubt that he is going to turn down a 4-6Mil contract from a team like NJ who is damn close to NY. Or the Islanders? Or even Philly.
rangers,37xdye,swingingthechain,2,Sun May 31 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"Flyers are in cap hell. Zero chance they sign MSL.   The Devils have enough cap space, but if MSL wants to win a cup before he retires he's more than likely not gonna go there.  The Islanders have space as well, but Brock Nelson and Anders Lee are going to be RFA and I'm sure the Isles will pay those two before looking at anyone else."
rangers,37xdye,jedimasterchief,3,Mon Jun 1 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"If he is re-signed I would want him designates to the 3rd line. I think Fast, Miller, Hayes and Hagelik are talented enough to get top 6 experience and have room to grow. MSL is on the decline"
rangers,37xdye,bjisba41,2,Sun May 31 13:06:43 2015 UTC,"I think of MSL contract as the cap increase. Whatever it goes up by, sign a 1 year. It's not gonna go up more than $2 million. This still gives us like $11 million to resign everyone and try and bring in a cheap 4th/3rd liner."
rangers,37xdye,jedimasterchief,1 point,Sun May 31 07:30:40 2015 UTC,"They have 11-12m free after all of next years contracts are factored in, MSL isn't part of that"

rangers,37xdye,fosiacat,2,Sun May 31 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"The question is, does the money matter to him?  If he wants to live at home with his wife and kids, and still compete for a cup with us, he's going to need to take a massive pay cut. I'd love to see him sign at league minimum to give us the most room to help the team WIN by signing everybody else.  Don't think it's going to happen that way though."
rangers,37xdye,Tsunkatse,2,Sun May 31 19:41:50 2015 UTC,This is exactly my point. I think he will take a massive paycut.

rangers,37xdye,coltrane2989,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think St. Louis fits in AV's system, at least not anymore. Maybe four years ago he'd have plugged right in, but he's in a serious decline and it's not going to slow down anytime soon. He's 40 on a team build for speed and often lagged, especially later in the season in the playoffs. His shot has lost a lot of its power, his accuracy is taking a hit with it, too. He posted weak possession numbers this season and posted his lowest point total since his 2001 injury shortened campaign. I love Marty, I think he's a class act and a hall of fame, all-world talent but he's past it. He isn't what the Rangers need to get over the hump and win the cup next season. Worse, I think signing him costs us one of Step, Hags, Fast or Miller. No thanks."
rangers,37xdye,coltrane2989,0,Tue Jun 2 20:57:25 2015 UTC,"Why? Why not look for a signing in the offseason of someone who could actually help this team out? I don't know if you saw him out there during the last two months here, but he only brings the team down. He didn't do a damn thing to help."
rangers,37xdye,TrimmedXP,2,Mon Jun 1 00:21:40 2015 UTC,"He ran out of gas for sure, but he's one year removed from being our best postseason player. I don't know if you remember Nash last playoffs, but he did not do well. Sometimes guys just don't have it, and other years they do. Give him less ice time during the regular season, and he'll have something left in the tank for the playoffs. Who can we sign that will give us 20 goals and 30 assists with the cap room we have?"
rangers,37xdye,Darclite,0,Mon Jun 1 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"No clue who we could sign for that. But he didn't do anything that showed me he deserves a roster spot. I sincerely feel that anything he gets, will be too much."

rangers,37wx1i,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 31 03:39:05 2015 UTC,"Sherman's March to the Sea:       Sherman's March to the Sea is the name commonly given to the military Savannah Campaign in the American Civil War, conducted through Georgia from November 15 to December 21, 1864 by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman of the Union Army. The campaign began with Sherman's troops leaving the captured city of Atlanta, Georgia, on November 15 and ended with the capture of the port of Savannah on December 21. His forces destroyed military targets as well as industry, infrastructure, and civilian property and disrupted the Confederacy's economy and its transportation networks. Sherman's bold move of operating deep within enemy territory and without supply lines is considered to be revolutionary in the annals of war.

It has nothing to do with the recent ""islander love"", What it comes down to we don't have any ""stars""(which is horseshit) or good ""Canadian boys"" on the Rangers. It doesn't help that Krieder is a major villain in a lot of people's eyes.   Not saying Nash/MacT/hank/ arent awesome, but our team keeps stirring the pot. Especially with the MSL situation.   Idk I like being the villain. Fuck Long Island, fuck jersey(laughing at the current state there in), fuck the entire state of Pennsylvania, Boston seems in trouble so I will be light on them.. Your dickheads...  We maybe looking downward but we have two more years before we get scared the king will get his crown in New York.   I do miss stralman lots though.... LGR"

rangers,37vrje,IzBox,2,Sun May 31 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly why I'm not sure why people are panicking so much. We will have pretty much the same team next year. Sather will do whatever it takes to lock up Stepan, and Miller and Hags should be back as well. We'll have a full season of Yandle next year as well. Only player probably leaving is Shep, barring a trade."

rangers,37vrje,bjisba41,9,Sun May 31 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"What he said is the take home message people should come back with.   Many are calling for a complete tear down from top down and dumping Hank? (Seriously? Dumping the king???).   There's a lot of fresh frustration. The season ended on a veritable whimper and we all wanted more. That's fair. But in finessing a team together starting from scratch when you were 5 wins away from the ultimate prize is plain dumb.   This probably isn't a popular opinion right now but why the hell have we now forgotten the absolute QUALITY hockey we saw this year? There were games I couldn't believe this was my team: highlight tier goals regularly, papa johns giving away pizza at the price it's actually worth on the regular.   We had enough balance and depth to make it through a significant injury to Hank, which most thought would push us to a bubble team, and triumphed through the standings as the presidents trophy winners. That is not something to just throw away.   The blessing and curse of a major market team like NYR is that the fanbase is so damn scatterbrained in looking for immediate success they'll cry panic all the time and throw the baby out with the bathwater.   Don't panic. Be patient. And LGR."
rangers,37vrje,honus,3,Sat May 30 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"That's New York sports in a nutshell. As soon as a good team ""fails"" (if you consider anything short of a championship a failure) then everyone needs to get traded or fired. There is a weird subsection of fans that comes out of the wood work once in a while that just seems to really want to trade Hank. They came out when Talbot was playing well and they pop up once in a while. This is the King's team. He's not going anywhere."

He can start for someone, he's going to want to start for someone. You can't afford to pay starter money (probably even more in this case since we'd be actively keeping him from starting) for a backup.  If we don't trade him, he'll walk and we'll get nothing."

I've bitched about it before, but why is it we can never get a guy that's a legitimate and consistent scoring threat? Watch what the Oilers do with Connor McDavid. Guaranteed they get a cup before Henrik does."

rangers,37syp3,EvanLeonard,4,Sat May 30 06:54:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you everyone,  finding this sub has really provided me with an unbelievable sense of joy and it was a pleasure going on this run with you all.  About 5 years ago i really fell out of hockey after playing & watching since 4 years old.  Almost felt like I was burnt out.  I stopped watching and playing for about 2 and a half years.  I didn't have a team, i had a favourite player (coincidentally MSL), and a favourite goalie.  When I chose to get back into it, being a goalie, I decided to take up the team of the guy who I modelled my playing style after, Henrik, and these New York Rangers.  This team is so fucking likeable, from Steps to Zucc, Brass, Hags, Kreider,  BDR, Moore, the King, Mcdonagh(fucking warrior, heal up that foot) & all of our D, the young guys like Miller, Fast, FUCKING AV, this team plays hockey the way I've always enjoyed it.  They got me back into the game like never before, but this sub topped it all off for me.  The passion you guys & girls have really showed me that I made the right choice picking the Rangers as my team. I love all of you, everyone who contributes in any way shape or form and especially the mods, thank you, from a young canadian kid, for restoring my passion for hockey and in the greatest sport on earth.   TLDR: THANK YOU ALL I LOVE YOU,  & LOVE THIS TEAM"

Thank you for another year of quality hockey plastered with every type of human emotion throughout the season. Great job mods. And I think we can agree that we should never touch that god damn President's trophy again....only leads to broken dreams and broken feet....and concussions.

rangers,37sxpj,_TheConsumer_,42,Sat May 30 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"You can't sit McDonagh if he's able to play, so I understand the 7D decision.  What's frustrating is just how effective the 4th line was this series.  I mean, you HAD to sit someone from the 4th line for Hunwick but they were generating, forechecking, and doing just about everything in the first 6 games.  Such a tough decision to make."
rangers,37sxpj,Phase_Six,17,Sat May 30 03:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I feel bad for Sheppard because I feel like ever since he came in for Zucc, he gave that 4th line a lot of energy with his checking and physical play. Hunwick had 6 shifts and I get why AV went with 7D, but...I don't know. Not saying the 4th line would've been the difference but almost seems like a waste of scratching Sheppard.  That being said, I really hope Fast continues to improve. He really showed a lot of character throughout the postseason."

rangers,37sxpj,NJ_Yankees_Fan,17,Sat May 30 04:44:28 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't have played. It's that simple. Why deplete the lineup with an injured played when you could've dressed a healthy Sheppard, especially when he's been playing well?"
rangers,37sxpj,bjisba41,23,Sat May 30 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"AV said it had been broken ""for a few games."" I guess it flared up badly today.   You're right, though. We missed Sheppard tonight."

rangers,37sxpj,darkknight915,9,Sat May 30 03:42:49 2015 UTC,I really liked the way Sheppard played in this series. Him being on that line generated offense through grinding and winning board battles. He played with a ton of heart.
rangers,37sxpj,jaspor,6,Sat May 30 03:44:40 2015 UTC,wouldn't have mattered. It's not like Sheppard is an offensive juggernaut and the defense really didn't cost them.

rangers,37sxpj,BadSeedling,2,Sat May 30 03:36:53 2015 UTC,"He played 17:30 in 2 periods and wasn't a liability (despite finishing -1) and you can't only dress 6 D if one of them may not be able to play at all.  AV had no choice.  Shepp was a good influence on our 4th, but shouldn't have been the difference between 7 goals and 0"

rangers,37sxpj,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Sat May 30 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"Knew it for a while now. His stride and turning has been wacky these past few games. For all you people wondering why he left and returned, he most likely just got a cortisone shot before he went on ice.  Also, Shepphard could have made a difference today, 100%. You people are acting like he has to score to be effective. Screwing up the lines, and completely changing how a 4th/3rd line operates and the loss of chemistry after coming off a blowout is huge.  Rangers would have been more in sync and fluent if they had him.  That being said, I believe that if we had Zucc, this cup is ours. We had to give St Louis a point producing role, and he obviously isn't capable of that anymore.  Zucc would've made everything about our team better, PP, 5 on 5, everything.  Zucc is the equivalent of Tampa losing one of the triplets.  Overall, whatever. Hopefully we can go far next year and Tampa can win it all so we know we lost to the best."

rangers,37ui9b,swingingthechain,27,Sat May 30 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"MSL should not be resigned.  I know we can get a hometown discount on him, but he isn't even worth the roster spot given our other options.  Fast earned himself a handy raise over the last two months.  He should get a bridge contract, one or two years for one to two million per year.  Lock up Stepan long term.  5+ years, hopefully about $4.5 million annually.  Hagelin should get 3 years for $2-3 million annually.  Miller played really well this year, at just about every forward position on every line at some point.  A bridge contract for him too.  That should give him something to aspire to over the next two years.  $2 million-ish for him.  Sheppard isn't a necessity but for the right price, I wouldn't mind keeping him around.  Hunwick is probably one of our better options available for defensive depth.  He already knows our system and is a very good skater.  He won't cost us much either."
rangers,37ui9b,DicNavis,9,Sat May 30 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"Lock up Stepan long term. 5+ years, hopefully about $4.5 million annually   No way that's happening. We're going to need to offer him 5+ in order for him to stay."
rangers,37ui9b,themagicalpanda,9,Sat May 30 15:13:35 2015 UTC,$5.5 should be the cap.  He's not Logan Couture.
rangers,37ui9b,DicNavis,7,Sat May 30 15:17:01 2015 UTC,You also have the realize that Couture's contract was signed back in 2013.   The cap has risen and the market has changed. Here are some of the yearly average salaries for centers that signed in 2014 and 2015:  Dubinsky - 5.85 million  Krejci - 7.25 million  Statsny - 7 million  Duchene - 6 million  Spezza - 7.5 million  Nugent-Hopkins - 6 million  Steps is going to get paid.  EDIT: Formatting
rangers,37ui9b,themagicalpanda,2,Sat May 30 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"Statsny and Spezza were on the UFA market...  I'd value Stepan somewhere between Dubinsky and Duchene, only he plays for a team with a bigger cap crunch.  Edit: we could give him that Krejci contract if we wanted to get into the same situation as the Bruins."
rangers,37ui9b,DicNavis,2,Sat May 30 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"Krejci gets 7.25 per year?? I get that he's an important player for them, but that is the definition of overpaid"

rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,5,Sat May 30 14:56:00 2015 UTC,Isn't Stephan your #1 C? I think he could command a little more than 4.5.
rangers,37ui9b,devilslefthand,9,Sat May 30 15:16:26 2015 UTC,Don't know why you're downvoted.. Stepan will not even be close to 4.5.  Ryan O'Reilly career: 427gp 90g 156a    246pts  Stepan career: 362gp    89g 163a    252pts  The guy is getting paid.
rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,5,Sat May 30 15:57:39 2015 UTC,I think O' Reilly is getting 6 million a year at the moment. You showing they have similar amount of points but Stephan has played about 70 games less so he could easily ask for more. Probably downvoted because of my name but interested to see how the Rangers' offseason will unfold as well as Chicago.
rangers,37ui9b,themagicalpanda,3,Sat May 30 16:06:55 2015 UTC,"Believe me, us Rangers fans are interested as well to see how this offseason goes."
rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,2,Sat May 30 16:10:59 2015 UTC,I think Stephan should be the first priority before anyone else. Going to be 25 by next season. I think MSL is expendable and could be let go. Boyle I believe has a year left with a NMC. He had a decent playoffs with 10 pts in 19 games.
rangers,37ui9b,devilslefthand,5,Sat May 30 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Boyle was ok point-wise, but his actual play was atrocious. Between his awful giveaways in the d zone and his lack of footspeed when manning the point, he gave up more odd-man rushes than anyone else. I can't wait to be rid of all Boyles."
rangers,37ui9b,irishguy42,2,Sat May 30 16:37:24 2015 UTC,I would think that we drop Hunwick since we have Skjei coming in. He did great in the Wolf Pack for the time he was there. I don't see him not making it out of training camp if Hunwick isn't re-signed.
rangers,37ui9b,DicNavis,1 point,Sat May 30 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"We don't want to use Skjei quite like we use Hunwick though.  We need Skjei to be playing full time, whether in New York or Hartford.  Hunwick showed he can stay fresh and ready as the 7th defenseman."
rangers,37ui9b,Jrelis,1 point,Sat May 30 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"You don't have Skjei as the 7th D on the NHL team.

Similar to how the Rangers handled McDonagh when he first signed"
rangers,37ui9b,machphantom,11,Sun May 31 05:07:07 2015 UTC,One thing we need to do is bring Buchnevich over and give him a shot to win a spot in the preseason. This kid apparently can snipe and that's one thing this team has sorely missed for a long time.

rangers,37ui9b,redpotatochip6,3,Sat May 30 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"We would save ~ $5 million by not re-signing MSL.  That raises our available cap to ~$14 million to sign Fasth, Step, Hags, Shep and Miller.   Realistically, Step gets close to $6 million. As far as I'm concerned, he's well worth it. He plays well in big games - especially the playoffs.   Fast deserve a pay bump - but nothing crazy. Possibly 2 million. Same goes for Miller.   That leaves us with ~ $4 million to sign Shep and Hags.   I won't lie, I wasn't thrilled with Hags' performance in the playoffs. 5 points in 20 games is extremely pedestrian. If his price is crazy, it would be best to let him walk.   Give whatever roster spots are available to prospects. Tambellini, Bourque, possibly Buchnevich."
rangers,37ui9b,Muriden,3,Sat May 30 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, i completely forgot about Tambellini. He did some pretty amazing things in the WHL from what i heard and Buchnevich just resigned for another year in the KHL. Him or his agent said that it was for development purposes."

The only way the cap is higher is if it moves up, which should be about $1-2 million."
rangers,37ui9b,Muriden,3,Sat May 30 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"We currently have $200k in cap room  Coming off the books:    Hagelin - $2.25M Stepan - $3.05M MSL -     $5.63M Fast-      $783k Miller-     $682k Shep-     $193k   All combined, that leaves us with cap room close to ~12.75M.

rangers,37ui9b,beric33,3,Sat May 30 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm going to preface this with these are my favorite things to talk about and I'm at my lifeguarding job and no ones here so if anyone can keep me entertained with a discussion on this I'd  appreciate it lmfao.   First day for us to make moves and all that good stuff is draft day. Our number one priority should be moving Dan Boyle. We're in a tight cap situation this year and his 4.5 million could be better used elsewhere, especially after the way he played this year. This year's draft is a very deep draft and I think it'd be a good idea to trade into it. One potential target for that could be trading Talbot to Edmonton for the 16. By the way Talbot has played he'll be able to make a good amount of money on the open market next offseason.   Second, we need to let Marty go. His age is really starting to catch up with him and he's starting to become a liability out there. The guys who should be our priorities to sign are Step, Miller, Fast, then Hags. We should also try to get Shep back.   In free agency if we have some cap to work with, we probably won't but for arguments sake let's say we do, I think one guy we should look at is Michael Frolik. Especially if we're losing Marty he'd be a great guy to come in and take his spot, even though we have a good amount of depth at the wings I think he'd work for us.   Lastly, one thing that I think could happen is seeing Nash being dealt. While I don't think it's likely I think it could happen. Let's say it did happen, what would his value be and what could we get back for him?   Those are my thoughts on what could/should happen. Anyone care to discuss?"
rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,3,Sat May 30 16:12:25 2015 UTC,For Nash I want a solid center and a young scoring winger. Forget the picks   And I think the highest we can get for Talbot is a 2nd. Doubt it for the 16
rangers,37ui9b,DicNavis,2,Sat May 30 16:30:02 2015 UTC,Nash+Talbot+Boyle for McDavid!!! /s
rangers,37ui9b,tomlambsays,1 point,Sat May 30 18:14:37 2015 UTC,So what team do you have in mind to get a solid center and winger.
rangers,37ui9b,Jrelis,1 point,Sat May 30 16:35:45 2015 UTC,I don't know. Stepan and Brass are our 1 & 2 so I'm really looking for the scoring winger. We have great wing depth so maybe a winger can also be part of the deal. The center would be a third liner and be there for faceoffs really
rangers,37ui9b,The_Other_Manning,1 point,Sat May 30 16:38:56 2015 UTC,Toronto has a few different options if they were interested.

rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,1 point,Sat May 30 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"The thing about trading Nash for a center is that we won't have a bonafide first line winger and our centers would be 1a, 1b, and 1c."
rangers,37ui9b,NYRule1994,1 point,Sat May 30 17:22:44 2015 UTC,Don't NEED a premier center just someone for the third line who can win face offs
rangers,37ui9b,irishguy42,2,Sat May 30 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"that's my fault, I didn't see the part about the scoring winger so I thought you wanted like a too notch center. I could get on board with that, someone who could put the puck in the net who's younger then Nash with a better cap hit."
rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,1 point,Sat May 30 17:38:26 2015 UTC,Younger than Nash with a better contract? Probably most players in the league. I'm on mobile but I can definitely get back to you. The problem is I don't know who would want Nash
rangers,37ui9b,thehockeychimp,1 point,Sat May 30 17:52:30 2015 UTC,One situation I can think of just off the top of my head (I'm on mobile too) might be Detroit for either Nyqvist or Tatar. Just a thought right now.
rangers,37ui9b,thehockeychimp,2,Sat May 30 18:39:21 2015 UTC,"Boyle has a NMC. He has all the leverage in where he wants to go if he wants to. Edmonton may choose to go the UFA route for goalie. Niemi has been linked to them, but they do need a goalie. Agree with MSL. Frolik's last contract was at 3 million so I think he would want to demand at least 4 million. I don't know if a team would want to trade for Nash with the cap hit and his playoffs was in line with his contract."
rangers,37ui9b,bjisba41,2,Sat May 30 16:32:53 2015 UTC,I just found out Boyle had a NMC which is very unfortunate because the team would be a lot better without him.
rangers,37ui9b,Jrelis,1 point,Sat May 30 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, he only has one more year on his contract."
rangers,37ui9b,fosiacat,1 point,Sat May 30 18:42:04 2015 UTC,Unfortunately some players may have to be cut/dealt this offseason because of his contract.
rangers,37ui9b,Crossfire912,8,Sat May 30 20:25:27 2015 UTC,Boyle and MSL out. Everyone else stays.
rangers,37ui9b,plastictf,11,Sat May 30 14:46:36 2015 UTC,Boyle has a no movement clause. He would have to waive it to move. If he was out our situation would look a lot better but I'm not sure how that will play out.
rangers,37ui9b,plastictf,2,Sat May 30 14:48:37 2015 UTC,I would waive it just to keep everyone else. He's still a great player but he's no machine like he used to be.
rangers,37ui9b,strongbad3689,6,Sat May 30 14:51:36 2015 UTC,"I think he's the one who needs to waive it, so maybe Dolan can just throw him money on the side to do it"

rangers,37ui9b,strongbad3689,1 point,Sat May 30 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the way it works is that you pay one year of his salary for the remaining years of the players contract against the cap. He only has one year left, so a buyout just gets him off the team and doesn't clear up cap"
rangers,37ui9b,irishguy42,1 point,Sun May 31 02:49:33 2015 UTC,You eat the money but there's a cap penalty for a certain amount of his money but it's not the full hit.  Although it might be different with the new CBA's rules on 35+ y/o players? Not quite sure
rangers,37ui9b,keetner,0,Sun May 31 05:08:31 2015 UTC,"so pay him because there is no choice, and bench him every night until he gets hungry to play and asks for a trade, or retires. can’t keep those old legs on this team. him and msl are the odd men out and it showed."
rangers,37ui9b,irishguy42,2,Sat May 30 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"I think we let MSL and Shep go and dip back into our talent pool in Hartford. Klingberg and Bourque are NHL ready. Then, we resign everyone else."
rangers,37ui9b,keetner,2,Sat May 30 15:43:38 2015 UTC,Not a lot of talk about Staal. Is he really worth 5.7 Million?
rangers,37ui9b,NYDevilsFan,3,Sat May 30 17:47:43 2015 UTC,He would have gotten more on the market probably. I think aging Boyle at 4.5 is the worse situation.
rangers,37ui9b,irishguy42,2,Sat May 30 17:53:35 2015 UTC,Yes but we only have Boyle for 1 more year. So it's not a completely disaster of a situation.
rangers,37ui9b,ChaseTheBear,2,Sat May 30 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"I was about to start a thread. I know my post is going to sound rash and fueled by disappointment, but try to at least hear me out. (I apologize for the length)  The Rangers are in a tight spot. They have a lot of cap tied up and they have players they need to re-sign. I'll keep it short:   St. Louis needs to go. It looks like age, or a mental block, hit him hard. He's not the same player he was and he was virtually useless all playoffs. His contract is up, so we let him walk and wish him the best. I wouldn't be surprised if he retired because I doubt many want him unless he wants to a take a near-league minimum deal, but I don't want him back for that.  Try to move Dan Boyle. He honestly did pick it up as the playoffs went along, but he's just too old. It's a young man's game now and he's too slow, both physically and mentally. He can't  keep up with fast forwards and his decision making is too slow. That would free up some cap space, but I'm not sure if they can find a trading partner.  Yandle was a disappointment, but he's not taking up a lot of cap room and we have him for another year. Hopefully he can adjust to AV's system.  Nash...nobody is going to take that contract. As much as I'd like to try to move him, it won't happen unless picks/prospects are involved and that's a bad idea. Let's be honest: he isn't worth his contract. Yes, yes, he played well in the playoffs, and was a beast in the regular season. But you can't have that much cap room invested in a player who was playing like a great third liner. He just doesn't have the playoff edge and there's a big enough sample size at this point. He scored 5 goals this year, and one came with 3 seconds left in a 4-2 game, and 2 came when the deficit was already 3+ late in the third. That's not enough when your job is to score. So I'd like to shop him but it's unlikely he'll be moved. If he's not moved, he needs to see a sports psychiatrist.  I'd also have interest in shopping Staal. He was OK this year, but he's making big bucks. He provided no offense and his defense was just pretty good. We need that cap space with how long he's locked up.  With some of those moves, the Rangers have enough cap room to sign their players. Stepan needs to be locked up long term. He's a core player and a great playoff performer. He's young and has a lot of career left, and he can really do it all. I'd like to see Hags get a few years, but I'm worried that his age will start affecting his biggest asset, which is his speed. I'd like to see Fast get a one- or two-year deal to prove himself. He had a pretty good year and is only 23. I'd like to see Hunwick back for another year, he was really solid and will come cheap. JT Miller still has a lot to prove. He's shown flashes but he's also made some dumb plays. I see the potential so hopefully he can learn. We need to also make sure we have the space for Kreider, Hayes, and hopefully a FA or two for next offseason.  Finally, the coaching. I'm not saying to change the personnel, but something needs to change. The power play is stupid bad. It makes me crazy and was a key reason for our failure. Two power plays in Game 7 and no momentum. They've given up almost as many chances as they generate all year. The power play coaching needs to make adjustments. And I don't know how fixable this is, but there's something off with the ""leadership"" part of the coaching. You could tell most of the Rangers didn't have the edge. Whether that's the coaching or the players I don't know, but I feel like a great leader can get his team to play with that fire and urgency when it really matters. Great regular season coaching, poor playoff showing, which is more important.  I want Hank to win a Cup. He's getting old. Not sure how many great years he has left. Part of me wants to trade him and go with Talbot because it might be the smarter long-term decision with some of the young talent we have, minus the D. Talbot has shown he can play, though we don't know his playoff potential (whereas Hank is a stud in the playoffs). A partial rebuild might not be the worst decision. It will never happen, but it's interesting to think about. The only negative I see is the aging defense. I highly doubt anyone here agrees and I'm not sure I agree with the idea either, just something to consider.  If you read this far, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my opinions and would love a response either way."
rangers,37ui9b,strongbad3689,11,Sat May 30 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"I actually thought that Boyle and Yandle played well in the ECF and I don't think Nash needs to go, considering didnt have as bad of a playoff as people though. I do agree however on the coaching personell. Im completely fine with AV and Ulf, but the power play NEEDS to change. Scott Arniel has to go."
rangers,37ui9b,darkeagle91,3,Sat May 30 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"I agree those two played well for most of the ECF, but they were bad in the first 2 rounds and in the regular season. Yandle has potential to get better with this team, but Boyle is just on the decline. I just think it's hard to win when your ""best"" scorer has difficult generating offense, and it's now been 3 years of poor playoff performances. Power play absolutely needs to change."
rangers,37ui9b,DrChopChop,5,Sat May 30 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Yandle was getting over a shoulder injury or something during the course of the first two rounds, or something like that. He then got better in time for the ECF, which is why he played like he did.  It was odd how he was doing well in the preseason, did poorly in the rounds against PIT and WSH, and then came back to do well against TBL. Must have been some kind of injury or something.  And yeah, Arniel needs to go. Our PP is so awful."
rangers,37ui9b,strongbad3689,4,Sat May 30 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"I may not hit all of your points:   I forget how long Staal's extension is, but isn't there some form of a NMC in there? I know it's for a few years and only after that he can be possibly traded. I see us keeping him for a few more years, but I think there is the possibility that he is traded at some point. I think things will be a little more interesting once Skjei is brought up.  Yandle -- Yeah, people raved on and on about how great he was, so I don't know if that skewed my idea of what he was capable of. That said, I'm pretty sure he hadn't adjusted to our system entirely and/or was playing sick or injured at some point. I thought he looked very solid for us during the regular season when he came along, but started dipping downwards during the Pens/Caps series (I remember he did sit out for a few practices and what not). However, he got much better during our games against Tampa. So I don't think what he did in the past couple of months was really indicative of how he usually plays, and since ARI is paying a part of his salary, may as well keep him around.  Nash -- I have slightly mixed feelings. I'd like to see him given another chance just because I wonder if he was finally starting to break out in that series (Game 6). You could make the argument that offense was terrible in Game 7, but to be completely fair, you could attribute a lot of that to Tampa stepping up their D. Furthermore, there is always that one aspect about Zucc being out. I don't know. I feel like it would be too hasty to bail on his contract right now.  I really want Hags to stay but...ergh. I get the feeling he might not be long-term with us. I mean, there was so much talk about him or Zucc being on the chopping block and how we could only get one or the other, so I'm wondering how things might have changed since then. I really hope we at least give him a few years (2-3?) because I thought there was a lot of potential when he's with Hayes.  Miller is very interesting. Like you said, I think he has a lot of potential. The thing I noticed was that it seemed like he made the lines he played on a lot more effective. Not all the time, but there were a handful of cases. For example, there was the Hags/Hayes/Miller line, the Kreider/Step/Miller line, and arguably the more recent Nash/Brass/Miller line. I can't exactly remember all the games (a lot of it was in the regular season) but the announcers were always talking about them. Not to mention, he can be pretty physical at times and I feel like he can provide a bit of ""energy"" to the game that not a lot of other guys can. And even though he has done some dumb things, he is still very young + this was the longest season he's played with us (plus, who would take all those too many men penalties for us...ha.) I'm not sure what to say about our PP at this point, except that it's very confusing. I feel like it must be a coaching thing at this point because we've had/brought in players that are supposed to be the ""quarterback"" for it (eg. Richards, Dan Boyle, Yandle). I mean, it got good looks in the Tampa series but...yeah, I don't know. I think for a good portion of this year, I was more confident in our PK and I often felt like the PP would just kill our momentum.  I don't want to trade Hank. If it's for the possibility of him going to another contender to win one, then I would be okay with that. But if we trade him for the sole reason of being better long term...eh, I don't know how I feel about that. I get where you are coming from but...man, that would seem so wrong."
rangers,37ui9b,darkeagle91,2,Sat May 30 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"I think he was playing injured during the PIT/WSH series, or at least parts of it. He played really well in the TBL series, and during the regular season, which made it weird for the first two rounds.  I think he'll be fine with the team, and might be worth re-signing next offseason.  Also, Staal doesn't have a NMC, Girardi does (through whole extension, I think)."
rangers,37ui9b,darkeagle91,1 point,Sat May 30 18:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly, considering the circumstances with Yandle (new system + illness/injury) he played pretty well for the most part. Definitely interested in how things will be when he gets a full season with us, though.   I'm pretty sure Staal has one. While the sources don't explicitly confirm the terms (at least none that I could find), they mention a full NMC for the first three years and then a partial NMC for the next three. Here's an article in case you're curious. Which is why I feel like Staal might be moved at some point. They probably wanted to lock him up just given the fact that it would have been better for our cap versus open market, and by the time the fourth year of his contract hits, we might have other D brought up."
rangers,37ui9b,strongbad3689,2,Sun May 31 06:12:52 2015 UTC,I think Boyle has a NMC.
rangers,37ui9b,darkeagle91,1 point,Sat May 30 15:18:05 2015 UTC,He does.
rangers,37ui9b,Enzo95,2,Sat May 30 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"I want Hank to win a Cup. He's getting old. Not sure how many great years he has left. Part of me wants to trade him and go with Talbot because it might be the smarter long-term decision with some of the young talent we have, minus the D.   At this point I am totally OK with it.  Trade for some consistent offense/leadership, or some prospects that will make a difference.  Teams have been winning with subpar goalies, we cant put all our eggs in one Lundqvist."
rangers,37ui9b,Nether_Ending,2,Sat May 30 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of your post but a few points   -agree with MSL. Let him walk whether it's to another team or a retirement home  -I would LOVE to part with Boyle but I am unsure who takes him. It's not even worth buying out because he only has one year left anyway   -Nash is seriously a playoff bum. Last night he had 21:00 TOI and 1 SOG. Complete embarrassment and there is no defending him. That being said, he's worth having. I don't see any team paying for him and we are contending, we need him for the off chance he scores.    Stepan long term I support as well as keeping Miller and Fast.   -I 100% agree with Hagelin. I think he's the odd man out    No way we trade Hank. Him winning a cup with another team won't happen this season, but it's becoming a possibility down the road.  Trading Henrik and Nash destroys our win now mode. We need to hold on to them, don't blow it up.   I think this offseason hangs on MSL and Boyle. One will go, hopefully both."
rangers,37ui9b,irishdude1212,3,Sat May 30 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"Trading Hank definitely goes against the ""win now"" mentality, but I don't see that with Nash. He's not a playoff performer so he's just not going to really give your team that postseason edge whether it's now or 5 years from now. He's taking up too much cap space, and if you can trade him for some parts, or another scorer, that would contribute to the win-now mode. You agree that he's a playoff bum so moving him shouldn't hurt"
rangers,37ui9b,Nether_Ending,5,Sat May 30 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"Most important part of ""win-now"" is putting your team in a position to win with a favorable seeding and home ice.  Nash had 70 points this season, if you replace that with an interchangeable 40 point winger, we could've easily been the third seed in the east or been a wild card and matched with TB in the first round.  I doubt a first round exit as opposed to pushing a conference finals to a coin flip game 7 is improving our win now odds.  Plus we have plenty of young guys (Zucs, Krieder, Hayes, Miller) who can provide a spark in the postseason any given game.  I get Nash's postseason contributions aren't worth a superstar size cap hit, but they also aren't worth selling extremely low on right now."
rangers,37ui9b,irishdude1212,1 point,Sat May 30 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, this -- he sucks in the playoffs, but his regular season point totals are nothing to sniff at. It's a big cap hit, but we're better off trying to find a great line that makes him productive, instead of getting subpar returns on a trade"
rangers,37ui9b,Nether_Ending,1 point,Sat May 30 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"Was home ice really that valuable to the Rangers this year? They were 6-5 at home and 5-3 on the road this postseason. They had a better record on the road and performed better on the road. They blew out Tampa twice on the road (none at home), and were blown out once at home. They were shutout in Game 7 on home ice. I'd argue that home ice hurt them because for whatever reason, they play better on the road.  Plus, with the new playoff format, the matchups barely matter. You pretty much have to get through the best, or next best, team of the division one way or another, the winner of the other division, and then the winner of the West.  As for your last point, I know we were missing Zuc, but obviously the ""spark"" from those other players wasn't enough. Sorry, when you pay a guy that much to score goals and generate offense, he has to do his job or the team falls apart. It would be like if Hank started putting up tons of assists but let in lots of goals. Each player on the team has a role and Nash's was to be THE guy. He failed and it really hurt the Rangers. I'd rather finish last in the division and have guys who can step it up in the playoffs. The #3 team in the East and #4 team from the West are the ones in the finals, so clearly you don't need home ice advantage throughout to win, you just need playoff performers.  I also don't understand the logic of playing Tampa in the first round or third round. In that scenario, we'd have to play them either way, and it doesn't matter when you lose. And Game 7 wasn't a coin flip because Tampa was the better team. They performed in Game 7 and the Rangers didn't, and it's likely that they were/are the better playoff team."
rangers,37ui9b,Enzo95,1 point,Sun May 31 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"Home ice is always valuable.  You get last change, you get to put your stick down last, you get to sleep at home vs. in a hotel the night before etc.  The Rangers record this postseason home vs. away is what you'd call a small sample size.  There's no way being a low seed puts you in a better position for success if you're looking at a 20+ game postseason stretch.  As for 1st vs. 3rd round, I was more referring to the kneejerk reaction fans would have.  This season ended short of expectations, but in hindsight people will agree it was pretty damn good.  If the Rangers are instead a 6/7 seed and go home in the first heads would roll.  That's a huge difference in maintaining our continuity vs. viewing ourselves as a semi-rebuilding team, and Nash played an enormous role in that.  You also didn't address why selling Nash for pennies on the dollar would be a good idea right now, just because he doesn't provide ""enough"" of a spark."
rangers,37ui9b,Nether_Ending,1 point,Sun May 31 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. The trading partner and package need to be right for Nash, I just see us on the losing end of a trade"
rangers,37ui9b,tomlambsays,1 point,Sat May 30 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"The power play is stupid bad. It makes me crazy and was a key reason for our failure.   The inconsistency was definitely frustrating, especially not showing up at all in the largest game, but it went something like 7/24 in the series.  That's pretty damn fantastic against one of the better penalty kill units in the league.  That said, there are plenty of other shortcoming of the coaching staff the Capitals and TB exposed, but I doubt any changes get made after a presidents cup year.  I've also thought about if it wouldn't be more reasonable to keep Talbot than Hank, but I think the fact that Talbot's already pretty old to have never played a full season, and we have pretty good young goalie prospects coming soon, means we have to trade Talbot, try for 2-3 more years to make a run with Hank, and then start to ease his workload, like the Bruins did with Thomas/Tuuka."
rangers,37ui9b,darkeagle91,1 point,Sat May 30 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"The power play was actually at 21%, which is surprisingly high. However it doesn't factor in the shorthanded goal against (a 3-on-5 shorty) and all the chances generated by opponents while down a man. Tons of odd man rushes the other way and momentum killed. I know at least one of the PP goals of that series came when the game was over. They failed to come through in the most important game of the year, it just killed momentum. The PP needs to change, and maybe changing personnel will help.  I also forgot about the option of trading Talbot. It's probably smart to move him for something that can help us now. It'd be nice to have a great backup, but letting him walk for nothing would probably be a mistake (I think he's a UFA)"
rangers,37ui9b,Nether_Ending,1 point,Sun May 31 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"The 3 on 5 was entirely MSL from turnover to cannonball, the other 5 guys (counting Hank) had no responsibility in that.  I agree it killed momentum at times, which was extremely frustrating, but I wouldn't say it's one of our offensive priorities, and changing a piece of the coaching staff could just as easily hurt it as help it."

rangers,37uzn6,inferno138,20,Sat May 30 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"Another well written and thoughtful piece by SI.   Trade the franchise goalie (and best goalie in hockey) so you have financial flexibility.   That's called a rebuild, you dolt. Not exactly what the President's Trophy winning team should concern themselves with.   I swear half of these authors are monkeys with keyboards."
rangers,37uzn6,_TheConsumer_,2,Sat May 30 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Trade the franchise goalie (and best goalie in hockey) so you have financial flexibility.   He never says that; it's Talbot he expects to be traded.  It's hard to fault his logic on that point; Talbot has a lot of trade value and Slats may be able to get a good cheap piece in return.
rangers,37uzn6,johnjonah,2,Sat May 30 20:20:54 2015 UTC,"Please re-read the article.   Directly quoting the article:   Lundqvist will be back next season, although that won't universally be regarded as a positive development. The 33-year-old remains one of the best at his position and he's established himself as a franchise icon. But there's an argument to be made that his $8.5 million cap hit puts too much strain on the team's financial flexibility and that the younger (and cheaper) Cam Talbot could hold down the fort just as well.   According to the author, the fort Cam Talbot could hold down is our fort."
rangers,37uzn6,_TheConsumer_,2,Sat May 30 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, all he said is saying here is that Lundqvist is a huge chunk of the cap, but that is not the same thing as saying ""trade the franchise goalie.""  He doesn't even say that he is of this opinion; he only generally floated the idea.  In any event, the writer very clearly states that he doesn't expect Lundqvist to be traded.  Here is your own quote, with my emphasis:   Lundqvist will be back next season, although that won't universally be regarded as a positive development. The 33-year-old remains one of the best at his position and he's established himself as a franchise icon. But there's an argument to be made that his $8.5 million cap hit puts too much strain on the team's financial flexibility and that the younger (and cheaper) Cam Talbot could hold down the fort just as well.   What's more critical is the paragraph that came after it:   Assuming Lundqvist stays, it seems inevitable Talbot will be shopped at a time when his value is high. Any young talent he brings in return would restock a cupboard that's a bit bare and has no first-rounder each of the next two seasons.   edit:  It must also be noted that there were a few people in this sub during the Tampa series who were clamoring for Hank to be swapped out in favor of Talbot.  So while I don't think any of us want to trade Hank, the writer is probably not the only one who wondered about this."
rangers,37uzn6,johnjonah,2,Sat May 30 21:00:07 2015 UTC,Someone would have to be completely insane or oblivious to even entertain the idea of trading Lundqvist.   The author is suggesting that there are people in our fanbase that want Lundqvist traded. I haven't encountered one. This tells me that the author was floating an idea that he alone created.
rangers,37uzn6,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Sat May 30 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"Well, we are at least in agreement that this would be an unthinkable idea.  The only way I would be in favor of trading Hank is if he was close to retirement in a year when the Rangers didn't make the playoffs, and we had a chance to send him to a Cup-contending team, the way Boston traded Ray Bourque to Colorado."

rangers,37uzn6,bjisba41,-2,Sat May 30 22:07:55 2015 UTC,They're saying that he's getting older and his cap is only getting higher. I think the article is pretty well written.

rangers,37uzn6,ismele,2,Sat May 30 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm confused as to how you're saying it has risen. It's higher than his previous contract obviously, but cap hit is the same across the contract - it was 8.5m this season and will be the same next season. And every season until 2020."
rangers,37uzn6,bjisba41,1 point,Sat May 30 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"The context of the article is how the rangers are in a cap crunch. It's a generalized statement, Lundqvist is getting paid more as he's getting older. You're reading into it too much. Obviously he's not making more this year then the next, but he's making more then he was years ago."
rangers,37uzn6,jedimasterchief,2,Sat May 30 19:34:40 2015 UTC,People that suggest trading Henrik are blinded by the fact these 'average' goalies win the Cup. Quick and Crawford are both top tier goalies. You need a top tier goalie to be competitive. You need one to be a contender. Trading away our best player is by far the dumbest idea.

The only thing that bothers me is when people pretend they know what they're talking about when they clearly have no clue. But all you have to do is ask them an easy yet not obvious question about Hockey and chuckle to yourself at their response.

It happened to Chicago when they won back in '10, it definitely happened to the Kings in '12, and it happened to us last year.   In a way, I don't mind some bandwagon fans. It helps the sport grow, and I'm all for hockey growing. Its just the fans that come out like they've been fans all along. In a way though, a test of a teams fanbase is the good times AND the bad. Look at the Isles. plenty of bad years, and respect for those that actually stuck through them. But one good year and we're swarming with Isles fans. Its happening with the Devils right now. It just happens."

rangers,37svcn,A_Delicious_Soda,40,Sat May 30 03:05:54 2015 UTC,I think the general hate for the Rangers stems from FAs choosing to come here for $ when Sather was handing out blank checks. People still see us as a rich trust fund team even though we are primarily homegrown now.

Also some of us fans can be loudmouths, including me at times. And of course we represent the greatest city on planet earth. This seems to make us a pretty easy target to hate on, we don't get it to the same magnitude, but you see similar things with the Yankees and Cowboys.

rangers,37svcn,ThomasJCarcetti,6,Sat May 30 10:44:26 2015 UTC,"I spend a lot of time on all the main 4 sports subs and hockey is slowly becoming my least favorite.   From my perspective, r/baseball and r/NFL users are pretty level-headed and rarely do I see flair-based hate. Sure there's some minor trash talk if you're a fan of a popular/successful team (yankees, cardinals, pats, etc.) but it's not so bad that you'd feel unwelcome.   r/NBA is a notch below those two, but it's not terrible. The main problems with it are that there's a lot of bandwagon fans/shitposting, but they are easy to drown out and ignore. I get the feeling that there are a lot of younger users on the sub (ie a lot of high school kids) so this might be why. Can't confirm it but it feels like there are.   But on r/hockey? I just don't get it there. They flip-flop back and forth between whether they like or hate a team/player to the point where it doesn't make sense anymore. Also, ANY opposing opinion is immediately drowned out via extreme downvoting, to the point where it makes no sense to discuss what you think because the hivemind will just go against you. Worst of all, there is a lot of hate/animosity in general towards rival fans. Much more than I see anywhere else on reddit. I'm a Yankee fan and have better interaction with Red Sox fans on r/baseball than I do with most opposing fans in r/hockey. It's the only sub I've ever avoided at times because the users are just fucking nasty. There's a reason they literally had to fade comments you decide to downvote - because they know the users there abuse it like you wouldn't believe.  anyway my drunken rambling probably makes no sense but I hope this provided some insight."

Who cares about how many championships in how many years, the Islanders couldn't even stay in their own stadium they were so fucking awful.  That's not just a new occurrence, they have been awful since the 90s.  Stop acting like the Islanders are even remotely close to the level of the Rangers when your team hasn't won since they had one unbelievable squad.    The Devils are another story.   Quit whining. You guys aren't special. Just another under performing good team who's fanbase thinks it's all about them.   You're in /r/rangers you dumbass, of course the fans here want it to be about their team.  Last I checked, going to the Stanley Cup Finals one year and the ECF another doesn't constitute underperforming.  Underperforming would be if the Rangers didn't make the playoffs.   Look I understand, you're not used to your team being in the playoffs, you don't know how it is.  Any team in the playoffs can win the whole thing, its not just some equation.    The whole point is that /r/hockey is not a place for rational discussion, its a place where people look at your flair and instantly downvote you based on it.  All of the top posts have nothing to do with the game except for the result, there is no discussion, just hate."

They also won the President's Trophy but came up short in the playoffs.  The 93-94 team, however, that was the chosen one...  So maybe the pieces will finally come together in the next year or two... Fingers crossed."

Game 7 exit in the conference finals, and after that absurd performance, is a different story for this Rangers team. They bottled it in an embarrassing way.   I agree with the sentiment about Henrik though."

rangers,37stxx,ToTheBattery,4,Sat May 30 02:58:22 2015 UTC,Would've won it in regulation too if Wondolowski didn't bottle it. I really hated that selection. He's good in MLS but not cut out for the international stage. Brought on as a poacher and blew his opportunity.

rangers,37stxx,shane727,2,Sat May 30 02:52:42 2015 UTC,I said after the first goal this game felt similar. This game hurts just as much as that one.
rangers,37stxx,stevemillerisevil,21,Sat May 30 03:24:21 2015 UTC,Scott Arniel needs to be fired. The team just wasn't prepared for the Lightning to do exactly what they did in game 5.

rangers,37stxx,Curiousme14,8,Sat May 30 02:48:07 2015 UTC,That's what frustrates me. Why can't they score? Did our guys not show up? Or did Tampa shut them down?
rangers,37stxx,Gyroflex,12,Sat May 30 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"little of both..... we try to be too flashy most of the time, and our powerplay is pretty inconsistent, but we they shut us down by blocking sooooo many of our shots"

rangers,37stxx,VSPinkie,89,Sat May 30 02:48:09 2015 UTC,Rangers would rather lose going for cute shit than win putting shots on net.  Hope they're happy to be the fanciest guys on the golf course.  I never thought they would just give up like that.  I feel so bad for Lundqvist.  He deserves so much better than this limp-dicked shit.  Fuck it.  See you guys next season.

rangers,37stxx,nimperatori,5,Sat May 30 02:49:19 2015 UTC,Hank and Mac gave it their all and they can't even win for them. What a sad product we put out there on the ice.

rangers,37stxx,Protspecd,15,Sat May 30 03:00:24 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Shut out twice by a goalie that doesn't even command the respect of his own fan base. That's about as hard as an offense can choke.

rangers,37stxx,CaptainAndorra,3,Sat May 30 03:26:05 2015 UTC,AV should of seen the game 5 defensive strategy coming back for this game. It seems like they didn't do much to counteract that and hoped game 6 momentum would win them the game.
rangers,37stxx,slimer16,2,Sat May 30 03:49:10 2015 UTC,"We couldn't win two in a row. When they were able to make adjustments and counter what we were doing, we got killed.

Because of Ragecenter, this was the first season in forever where I was able to really watch every game (havn't lived in the northeast in 7 years). It was also the year i discovered reddit and this sub. While it hurts like hell right now, this has been one of the best and most magical years of sports i've ever experienced. What a run! That regular season; starting slow and taking shit from my freinds, getting hot in december (as i told them we would), the california sweep (right when i got RC), The ISlanders Game, the reign of prince cambot, the push to the finish, BDR, the presidents trophy. Listening to that last minute kreider goal on the radio in the car on a late night drive to float the Guadalupe outside San Antonio, right as i was crying to my buddy (a sympathetic blues fan) about just this moment, waking up the entire car with my screams. I feel let down a lot right now, but I love this team and I love all of y'all. It hurts so much because of how great this team is, not just on paper or on tv, but off the ice and as people. I feel like they are my friends too. I've read this sub every damn day and its really helped me get deeper in to this team. The whole squad is back next season, and I'll be there too.

Getting shutout twice at home is just wrong, especially against such a bad goalie that we scored 5 goals on in 3 different games. Lundqvist deserved much better than this, yet the Rangers keep letting him down year after year.  Losing Zucc was a big deal IMO. Can't blame the season on an injury to 1 guy though. Everyone should've stepped up when it mattered most.  Overall, it was a good season. Another year where we got close but just couldn't finish in the playoffs.

Probably not.   Did we let Hank down?  Most likely.  But this team has the heart. They have the skill. Buchnevich will come and help us on scoring. Our defense is still the best in the league. Yandle has become a big fucking help to this team. We have Hayes. We have Kreider. We have the best fucking goalie in the league.   We will get Hank a cup. We will.   Until then, Go Hawks. Go Ducks. Fuck the bolts. Fuck Cally. LGR.   Love you all. Stay positive."

It was a great season, and I love this team, and as long as Pierre is calling it, I'll never watch another NBC game the rangers aren't playing in. Holy god Jesus, he is the absolute worst.  Like many, most probably, I have little interest in an Anaheim TB finals, and I will be shocked if TB can even take the finals to game 6. Peace out Rangers reddit, see you next year!"
rangers,37stxx,thebabybananagrabber,2,Sat May 30 02:58:07 2015 UTC,I just don't get how they can play so different from game 6. Everything they did right in game 6 they didn't do in game 7. A softie from Henrik and that's all TB needed. Grats to them for taking it to us when it mattered. Can't wait for next season and hopefully a few changes to get us out of these game 7's. LGR!!!

I feel like I connected with a lot of you and i'm excited to continue subscribing to this sub. This was a huge let down and I can't help but cry and be incredibly depressed. I'll see you all next year. Until then i'll be drowning in my own tears I love you all. BLUE SHIRT NATION...I LOVE YOU!
rangers,37stxx,PowerIsPizza,4,Sat May 30 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm dissapointed. As we all are.  People are saying we played like shit but I don't really think so. The guys should have shot it more and kept it simple (and maybe also not given up after one goal against), yes, but the truth is that in this game, Tampa simply played better. I feel bad for Hank, because he's the one who did (almost) all the right things. And if that weak shot hadn't gone in, who knows?  Anyway, to the people who say that Hank will never win a cup or that the future of the Rangers is going to be terrible: GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH A CACTUS. We actually have a lot of young guys on the team (and in the farm system), Hank is still Hank and I don't think two first round draft picks are the be-all and end-all of success here.  Thank all of you for an amazing season, it has been a pleasure sharing it with you people again this year. Now let's look forward to an exciting summer and get right back to it in the fall!"

We can't have a guy not do the job he's supposed to do. Yeah, it does a lot of other stuff well, but that's all for naught when he doesn't do the specific thing he's supposed to do.   Hopefully we'll get somebody worthwhile for Cam instead of another star who's 5 years passed his prime.  Thanks for a great season, guys.  I'm sorry, Hank."
rangers,37stxx,Crossfire912,4,Sat May 30 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"Well now that I've shed some tears...  I won't totally defend or condemn the team's effort tonight. I won't say we didn't show up, but I won't say we played great either. It's infuriating how inconsistent we were this series, but especially the last 2 games at home getting shut out and putting 7 in the net in game 6 on the road. What the fuck? There's never a reason why you should get shut out in 2 consecutive games on home ice. We got beat by a better team and Tampa deserved to move on, but I just don't think we gave them everything we could. It's not like last year, where I thought we played well and just got beat straight up by a better team when we were the underdog anyway.  There was a lot to like about this season. Starting with that crazy (erm...Wild?) minnesota game where we had a huge third period comeback. The whole month of January, then Lundqvist gets hurt, then Talbot comes in and we keep winning, that fucking Islander game out on Long Island with ""you can't beat us!"" and then we did, clinching the Presidents trophy in Newark. Then we knocked Crosby out of the playoffs again and pulled off another ridiculous comeback against the Capitals. Lets not forget that a lot of other fans and ""experts"" said our run last year was a fluke and we wouldn't come close this year. Won the president's trophy and proved those experts wrong.  I've always been a Giant fan first and a Ranger fan second, but this season was probably the first time that I felt that role was reversed. I never was more invested into the team than I was this year, it was also my first full season on this sub after coming on midway through last year. I love this team more than I ever have before and a blown past 3 home games won't change the way I feel about the players. It makes it more of a bitter pill to swallow.  It's maddening we keep getting close and get nothing to show for it, it kills me Lundqvist still doesn't have a championship that the guy fucking deserves more than any other athlete on any NY sports team right now and more than anyone in the NHL. Something's missing from the team. I don't know exactly what it is. Some will say heart, and game 5/7 can justify that to an extent, but a team with ""no heart"" would've been out in game 5 against the capitals if not folding before that when Lundqvist went down, nor would they play on a broken foot like Mac did tonight. I think we peaked too early, even at the end of the regular season we seemed like a bit of a different team.  Ultimately, an incredibly fun season, a very shitty end, a very hollow feeling, but I'll still always love this team. Until next season."

I gotta say, the most disappointing thing about this is the fact that we played so uncharacteristically bad at home with Hank in goal. And we ended up with the same score as game 5.

rangers,37stxx,IzBox,7,Sat May 30 02:55:27 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts at once:   No camera shots of Callahan in the handshake line? NBC fails to the very end. None of the forwards played well tonight, none of them. Complete no shows. We missed Zuccs way more than anyone would have imagined. If he's in there this series, I think we have more energy. Yes, Hank looked locked in early tonight and I feel bad for him that the team scored zero goals in the last two home games in front of him. BUT he also let in that softy OT goal, and that weak goal tonight sucked the air out of the place. He was far from flawless. I believe whoever wins the west is going to completely and totally light Bishop up. Unlike the Rangers, both the Ducks and Hawks have superstars who have consistently scored in the playoffs.   All in all it was an exciting season, but this is certainly a disappointing end to it, especially with the lackluster performance tonight."
rangers,37stxx,itsstevens,4,Sat May 30 02:59:46 2015 UTC,Why is Hank expected to carry this team through 2 periods. Before Bolts scored we looked like shit and it didn't seem like we were going to be scoring much. I think Hank can only do so much before his morale dies down.

I grew up as a Detroit fan surrounded by Rangers and Devils fans, and loved hating every moment of it. But Lundqvist has always been hands-down my favorite non-Wing, and watching him lose it last season absolutely crushed me. I really thought you guys were going to finish off what you came so close to last season, this season. Of course I had a glimmer of innocent hope that the Wings would make it, but when I was being realistic I thought it would be the Rangers.   I'm just here to say, I'm sorry; your team had a hell of a season. And I know how it feels; when Tampa kicked us out in Round 1 I went home from the bar drunk and cried."

rangers,37udpw,rgby22,1 point,Sat May 30 16:51:27 2015 UTC,ya I got you
rangers,37udpw,defiantgrit,8,Sun May 31 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"The fans were disappointed. As they should have been. This was a team that offensively scored 7 goals against the Lightning the last game making them look awful. When you do that and get into a goalies head, you can't come back and get shut out. You just can't.  They know Hank played his heart out. Those other guys just didn't show up. And give credit to the Lightning and Cooper too. They knew that if they played responsible D and scored the first goal they could just defend and win. They were the better team."
rangers,37udpw,jemesnyc,6,Sat May 30 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I go to almost every single home game and have been since 2008 (did partial season before that).  I want this team to win so badly and I'm devoting time and money and emotion to following them.  Henke has been amazing and the team had a good season, but you got to arrive in the playoffs.  Getting shut out 2-0 at home, twice, is just not something I'm going to cheer for.  I'm not a fair weather fan or a complete asshole, I just have the same, valid opinion as a lot of fans who are truly committed.  You don't have to cheer mediocrity."
rangers,37udpw,artvandelay1994,26,Sat May 30 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"That's what happens when you price out real fans and let in the suits. The diehards were at Bryant park this whole series, not the lower bowl of MSG."
rangers,37udpw,gummy_vitamins,5,Sat May 30 14:05:27 2015 UTC,If the diehards were at Bryant Park last night they saw Two Gentlemen of Verona. If they were there Tuesday they were playing Settlers of Cattan. Last week I think there was a concert and Contra dancing.   Not trying to be snarky. They only had one game at Bryant Park. People in NYC need to know more about what their awesome parks service does for them.
rangers,37udpw,artvandelay1994,-2,Sat May 30 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, I stand corrected. I'm in NJ and am not aware of what goes on in the city. I had just assumed they always had viewing parties there."
rangers,37udpw,MikeyRage,8,Sat May 30 16:10:32 2015 UTC,You can screw off. Im at every game. When your team is flat in game 7 they dont deserve even a round of applause.
rangers,37udpw,artvandelay1994,1 point,Sat May 30 16:09:49 2015 UTC,Well of course - I don't blame the crowd being deflated after last night's game. But in general I wish more fans could afford to go.
rangers,37udpw,MikeyRage,4,Sat May 30 16:13:43 2015 UTC,"Blame the secondhand market, not the organization.  The organization isnt charging 600 bucks from 200 level seats EVER.  The only tickets that run that much are on the glass and in the luxury boxes."
rangers,37udpw,artvandelay1994,-1,Sat May 30 16:16:43 2015 UTC,I know. I guess I'm just pissed that it always costs a lot to come to the garden. But that's what happens when you play in a big city.
rangers,37udpw,anesqguy,1 point,Sat May 30 16:18:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, I still think they deserve a round of applause at the very end. They played their asses off all season. They won the president's trophy, and they didn't give up until losing at the end. I'm not saying don't be disappointed. I am extremely disappointed. But I still think they deserve some appreciation at the end."
rangers,37udpw,hammersticks359,1 point,Sat May 30 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"There was a round of applause at the end. After the handshake, they gathered together and the remaining crowd cheered. It wasn't huge because by the time TB celebrated and the shake, the crowd thinned out a little, and the team was so down that there wasn't a cohesive stick raise or anything.   Additionally, after the game ended, while TB celebrated, Hank was in the circle to the left of his crease hunched over for a while. First, a skater was consoling him, not sure who it was, then he eventually left, Henrik was still hunched over. Talbot came over to console him next and by that time, the crowd gave one more HEN-RIK chant.  So there was a crowd there that appreciated the team. No, not everyone there is a die-hard, and it sucks that some people are priced out, but simply because a person either a) has season tickets; or b) has money, doesn't mean they aren't a true fan. I was lucky enough to get in with seasons after the 2013 season before the run to the SCF. I find it funny when I see a guy in a suit screaming next to a guy in a hat and jersey sitting on his hands."
rangers,37udpw,artvandelay1994,4,Tue Jun 2 03:19:37 2015 UTC,"I know, it's just so disappointing to watch"
rangers,37udpw,Sailor_Chris,2,Sat May 30 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"I really hate to go on about this but I'll be brief. The tickets are priced where they are because of supply and demand. If the tickets sold for 40-50 bucks for the playoffs, they would sell out even faster than they already do and immediately be listed for resale at the same price point they are now. Clearly the garden has no problem selling out an arena full of playoff seats when they're reselling for 350 bucks per seat minimum, what makes anyone think that lowering the face would change that?"
rangers,37udpw,artvandelay1994,2,Sat May 30 16:15:05 2015 UTC,I know how supply and demand works. It just sucks that it is the way it is.
rangers,37udpw,nylawman21,1 point,Sat May 30 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"Oh look, more of the blaming suits bullshit"
rangers,37udpw,nylawman21,5,Sat May 30 15:57:26 2015 UTC,Why don't you go and drop a grand on playoff tickets then? It's a legitimate gripe. Majority of us can't actually afford games.
rangers,37udpw,nylawman21,5,Sat May 30 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"I was at the game. You don't know what you're talking about. Henrik got HUGE ovations last night. In fact, last night was probably the loudest cheers for him I can remember in 10 years. Very few people left before the end of the game. I'd say less than 5%, although notably, the #winforzucc guy was one of them -- he walked out at 5 mins and said ""keep on believing guys!"" -- hypocrite. Yeah, people left at the buzzer, but it wasn't just the ""suits"". The escalator towers were packed upstairs too.   My disappointment lies with the fact that the Rangers lost 3 straight HOME games in the Eastern Conference Finals, and were shut out twice in a row by a team's road-game playing STYLE they couldn't figure out (not by Bishop,  who played fine but was never really challenged in games 5 or 7). When you've invested thousands of hours (and dollars) in watching a team, and they've kicked the shit out of teams all year, excuse me for not jumping for joy when they play garbage hockey and get knocked out."
rangers,37udpw,evilkarebear11,1 point,Sat May 30 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying jumping for joy, neither am I saying don't be disappointed. From watching on tv it really looked like right before the period ended that seriously about 40% of the fans had left. I guess I could be wrong, but from watching it really looked like that to me. And the last 5 minutes sounded pretty quiet. also obviously I'm not calling out 100% of the fans, just the majority was disappointing. I clearly specified I love the fans on here and clearly you are one of them"
rangers,37udpw,evilkarebear11,3,Sat May 30 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"The first 6 rows between the blue lines are ""event level suites."" Those are the true uber-suits and that might be why it looks like an empty house on TV. In my section of the lower bowl corner, everyone around us is family-owned tix. Same people every game. It's like that in most of the Garden, but you can't see it on TV."

rangers,37udpw,Crossfire912,8,Sat May 30 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"That is a shame to hear. People who want to be there just to say they were there when something good or dramatic happens. Most will boast how much they paid for their ticket.   It drives me crazy when I see people during the play are on their phones or tablets, etc. Why even go to the game?  Anyway. A good season for the Rangers. There is always next year."

rangers,37rebp,haXona,3,Sat May 30 03:01:00 2015 UTC,It was good to see him start playing smart hockey instead of goon hockey. Ever since he scored he played better. Hopefully that can continue into next season.

rangers,37svox,berkley1217,30,Sat May 30 03:01:37 2015 UTC,We absolutely cannot let Hags walk by re-signing MSL. Marty will always be one of my favorite forwards but it's time for him to hang them up. I think a lot of our off-season moves will happen as a result of Slats decision with Marty.
rangers,37svox,Mats_Zuccarello,7,Sat May 30 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree. I was hoping that we would be able to win the cup this year so he could gracefully retire on a high, but I don't know what is going to happen."
rangers,37svox,high5sexwhoa,3,Sat May 30 03:05:28 2015 UTC,I love Marty but no doubt in my mind that he's done as a Ranger.
rangers,37svox,ncolaros,6,Sat May 30 06:10:18 2015 UTC,"I hope we resign him to a really small deal. He may have faltered toward the end of the season, but he was still third on our team in points during the regular season. If his signing effects our ability to sign anyone else, though, then let him go."
rangers,37svox,MagicSeat,6,Sat May 30 03:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yup. If he wants to keep playing, and keep playing here thats fine, he looked good most of the year and can definitely help the younger guys. But we can't spend a ton on him, or prioritize him over younger guys at this point."
rangers,37svox,swingingthechain,2,Sat May 30 03:30:29 2015 UTC,He better take a huge discount if not he needs to walk.
rangers,37svox,m4tuna,2,Sat May 30 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"I hate to point fingers, but it is possible that part of the lack of production this year from Hags was partially due to being stuck with MSL. I always see Hags as a much better player than the numbers he put up in 14-15."
rangers,37svox,high5sexwhoa,7,Sat May 30 16:03:42 2015 UTC,I can't believe what I am reading in this thread. Let Hags walk? Trade Klein and keep Boyle? I know everyone is emotional right now but goddamn. Our D core is what got us to G7 of the ECF. MSL walks/retires. try to trade Boyle. Re-sign Hags and do our best to hang onto Yandle. Jesus Christ.
rangers,37svox,this_guy_says,1 point,Sat May 30 06:20:27 2015 UTC,"Hank is what got us to G7 of the ECF. How many times did he have to make ridiculous saves when 1 opposing player snuck in unmarked between 2 of our guys right in the crease?  Maybe they're further down and I haven't seen them yet, but I see no one saying to keep Boyle."
rangers,37svox,m4tuna,3,Sat May 30 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"Rangers' final shot on goal this season came from Jesper Fast. With 6:50 remaining in the third period. No shots after that.   That stat makes me nauseous after the incredible season this team had. We need a forward (maybe 2) that is fearless and ready to put the puck in the net at times like this.   Zucc makes this a different series, but I'm not sold on the effort given in that 3rd period from our FWDs. A couple of moves might be needed this offseason, hopefully they don't go crazy though, I just think some tweaks would help here for next season."
rangers,37svox,Sapz93,6,Sat May 30 16:01:37 2015 UTC,I'm getting tired of saying next year. It's been too many seasons in a row . Hank has 3 more solid seasons the way I see it. At this point I'm nothing but disappointed
rangers,37svox,lespaul210,-1,Sat May 30 06:24:41 2015 UTC,This. I came to this sub just now to say this.
rangers,37svox,NYRule1994,0,Sat May 30 09:16:24 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but I am really trying to not give up hope by focusing on our future instead of wallowing in my own sadness.   This has happened every year since '94 and next year will always be our year until we win. You just gotta keep up the faith in our team :)"
rangers,37svox,artvandelay1994,5,Sat May 30 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"Let MSL walk. For all that is good and holy in the world trade Dan Boyle. He needs to go and we can use his cap elsewhere. If we could get a pick thats 10-16 or so for Talbot and Boyle I wouldn't be too mad because we might not have space to resign Talbot in the future. By the way he's performed I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted to go chase money. Try to get Hags back but cheap, priorities are Step, Fast and Miller though. I really feel like Fast could be a really good replacement for MSL, especially if he can kick his offensive game up a notch. If we have some cap to throw around, which I doubt we will but let's say we do for arguments sake, I think one guy to look at in FA would be Michael Frolik. He had a really solid season and he might fit good into our system, especially if we cant get Hags back or if management thinks we need a better established player tp replace MSL. Try to get Buch at training camp and see how he looks. Also, try to use Connor Allen as a 6th defenseman. Kids a stud."

rangers,37svox,tj_sad_boi_666,-1,Sat May 30 03:59:19 2015 UTC,"I'd let Hagelin walk, I know it won;t be popular but are you really gonna pay a guy over 2.5 million for speed? I'd let Hags and MSL walk, pray to God Boyle retires. Trade Talbot and Klein for a forward, bring up Bodie, Skeij and Lindberg."
rangers,37svox,darkknight915,-2,Sat May 30 03:10:54 2015 UTC,Boyle has been one of our best defensemen in these playoffs. Agreed on trading Klein and let's trade Girardi while we're at it before his value drops any more.
rangers,37svox,tj_sad_boi_666,7,Sat May 30 03:18:04 2015 UTC,"are you willing to pay Boyle 4.5 million again? I agree with you he was solid but he's making too much money, you also cannot trade Girardi he has a 3 year no movement clause in his contract."
rangers,37svox,darkknight915,4,Sat May 30 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yes I would, Dan Boyle has been one of our best possession driving players all season. Including in the playoffs and particularly in this series. And ok so management should tell Girardi to give them a list of teams he'd want to play for cause god damn I am so sick of seeing his incompetent ass bring down McDonagh."
rangers,37svox,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Sat May 30 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I don't agree. I hope he retires and they bring up Bodie. Boyle's skating ability was bad this season and it showed, if he was signed for about 2 million less I'd agree with you. for 4.5 million that's top  four d man money and he;s not performing at that level."
rangers,37svox,darkknight915,2,Sat May 30 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"You can't not agree. It's a statistically based fact. Boyle led the Rangers in corsi in both the regular season and the playoffs    If you want to talk about overpayments, giving Klein and Girardi a combined $8.5M to be our two worst possession players is overpayment."
rangers,37svox,tj_sad_boi_666,4,Sat May 30 03:37:00 2015 UTC,"If you read what I said I'd trade Klein, you cannot move Girardi like i said because he has a three year no movement clause in his contract. You have to make the best with what you can do right now. Boyle at 4.5 million is too much money."
rangers,37svox,darkknight915,-2,Sat May 30 03:40:09 2015 UTC,Trading Boyle in favor of keeping Girardi is almost like letting Stralman walk in favor of keeping Girardi (not quite as bad). Lots of players with NTCs are told to give a list of teams they'd be willing to waive the NTC to go to.
rangers,37svox,tj_sad_boi_666,6,Sat May 30 03:42:11 2015 UTC,"ok again you're clearly not getting this, the new york rangers by contract cannot trade Girardi because he has a no movement clause, completely different from a no trade clause. if they could trade Girardi I would happily do so but they cannot by contract trade him."

rangers,37svox,CaptainObvious_1,0,Sat May 30 13:24:42 2015 UTC,"Boyle has been one of our best defensemen   Can you read bro? And again there's the part where he led the team in corsi, having done the best job at preventing his opponents from getting shots off. He was pretty much our only defenseman to be above 50% CF% against the triplets and one of only a few to be above 50% against Stamkos."

rangers,37tst4,EarnSquirm,4,Sat May 30 09:31:31 2015 UTC,You honestly think Hagelin will accept an increase of only $600k? He will demand at least $3.75m - $4m. I honestly think he is one of the most under-rated players in this squad and should do all we can to keep him
rangers,37tst4,5cotland,5,Sat May 30 10:50:50 2015 UTC,"What is Hagelin’s value? There has been only 1 single salary-arbitration case the last few summers… Vladimir Sobotka’s in the Summer of 2014. Oddly enough, Sobotka appears to be a very similar player to Hagelin statistically. Specifically…   Hagelin will be 27 years old this summer when he is eligible for arbitration… the same age Sobotka when he had his case. Sobotka went 9-24-33 in 61 games the season before his hearing, and had a STL career of 29-72-101 in 247 games. Hagelin is 17-18-35 in 82 games, and has a NY Rangers career of 58-72-130 in 266 games. Both have a career differential of 20 seconds contrasting career average ice time per game of the two   It would seem Hagelin likely gets a similar salary increase as Sobotka received, or perhaps a bit more considering better career numbers (despite a slightly worse season). Sobotka was awarded 1-year, $2.725 million settlement (which remains pending as Sobotka had already defected to the KHL), or 3.95% of the incoming $69 million salary cap. Considering Hagelin may get slightly more than Sobotka, and the salary cap may only slightly increase next season…  My estimate, for a 1-year arbitration result, would be something like 4 percent of $71.5 million (assuming a modest $2.5 million increase of the cap). That math gets us somewhere around $2.85 million cap hit on a 1-year arbitration result."

rangers,37t07h,Vanguard2k,5,Sat May 30 03:43:50 2015 UTC,I disagree with what you say about Nash. Second on the team in playoff points is not production reducing by any means. Sure he had more assists than goals but a point is a point. I do agree its time for Marty to retire thougj
rangers,37t07h,DDSloan96,1 point,Sat May 30 03:49:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah he is a big part of our offense, but I just feel like he isn't the same as a Patty Kane. Obviously Kane is on a different spectrum of stars, but imagine what we could do with Kane instead of Nash."
rangers,37t07h,DDSloan96,2,Sat May 30 03:55:31 2015 UTC,And who do we give up to get Kane?
rangers,37t07h,darkknight915,1 point,Sat May 30 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"I'm just using Kane because he's known to do what he does, and he's the first star that pops into my head.  By no means could we afford him unless we dumped our best players into the trade, which wouldn't work with the hawks current cap issues.  But an all star forward that can produce consistently is plenty."
rangers,37t07h,manunited9,3,Sat May 30 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"I think we let Hags and MSL walk, try to trade Klein and Talbot for an impact forward. Bring up Lindberg, Bodie, and Skeij, the latter two move depending on trading Klein and hopefully Boyle retires. Boyle had a solid year but for 4.5 million it's really hard to keep him."
rangers,37t07h,nimperatori,1 point,Sat May 30 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"I think if MSL hangs it up, we can keep Hagelin.  Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I would like to see if Buch can produce in North America."

rangers,37t0wd,nimperatori,4,Sat May 30 03:50:32 2015 UTC,Marty St. Louis needs to retire. That's all I can think of ATM. Also resign Stepan.
rangers,37t0wd,artvandelay1994,2,Sat May 30 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"Now I can look at all those people who were praising the Callahan trade and tell them how it really as bad for us. We damaged our future by giving up picks abd Callahan was more effective these playoffs then MSL has been. Not only did we lose draft picks while trading for a worse player, we lost any picks/prospects we could’ve got if we traded Callahan to a deadline buyer."
rangers,37t0wd,beardlessdick,3,Sat May 30 04:00:45 2015 UTC,"I'm still torn on the Callahan trade because if we had decided to sign him, it would have prevented us from keeping some key guys from this year. Plus as much as we all ragged on MSL this playoffs he stepped up big time last year and despite the results I will always be thankful for him for that. It sucks that we lost the picks but the best we can do is trust the FO to find those diamonds in the rough and make smart moves."
rangers,37t0wd,artvandelay1994,1 point,Sat May 30 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this, apparently everyone thought that trade was excellent, Callahan played with purpose tonight and St. Louis gave his best invisible man impersonation tonight."
rangers,37t0wd,Sailor_Chris,6,Sat May 30 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Callahan and MSL each has one goal. Actually, I think MSL had more points in the playoffs. And their point production was about equal in the regular season too. But keep telling yourself we would have been better off"
rangers,37t0wd,beardlessdick,3,Sat May 30 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"Callahan plays with heart and effort. Similar to Zuccarello, even when he isn’t getting points, he is doing something. His tenacity and defensive presence add something even when he isn’t getting on the scoreboard. MSL is at best useless when he isn’t getting points and at his worse a huge liability. Add the draft picks we gave up and the potential assets we could’ve gained from a another trade its pretty clear that the trade was a blunder."
rangers,37t0wd,JustinBradshawTaylor,2,Sat May 30 04:35:12 2015 UTC,"Also Callahan did have surgery right before the start of the series, so he wasn't at 100% until games 6 and 7"

rangers,37t0wd,DDSloan96,3,Sat May 30 05:03:54 2015 UTC,MSL  gone. Step gets a great (deservedly) contract.
rangers,37t0wd,bjisba41,4,Sat May 30 04:02:15 2015 UTC,"resign Stepan and Hagelin, don't resign St. Louis, find a way to trade Boyle, trade Talbot while his value is still good and promote Skapski to the backup position, let Sheppard go, get Skjei and Buchnevich on the team, and for the love of all that is holy, find a way to get rid of Glass. Other than that, just find some guys to fill in on the 4th line"
rangers,37t0wd,redpotatochip6,6,Sat May 30 04:40:56 2015 UTC,I really don't understand this Nash playoff curse. He had 14 points. Second highest on team
rangers,37t0wd,FLRangerFan,5,Sat May 30 03:56:53 2015 UTC,14 points...3 goals. He's a goal scorer. Needs to score some goals.
rangers,37t0wd,jedimasterchief,1 point,Sat May 30 04:17:36 2015 UTC,5 goals. But anyway I  still see your point. I feel like him and Brassard switched places during these playoffs.
rangers,37t0wd,darkknight915,2,Sat May 30 21:03:35 2015 UTC,"He didn't preform on a consistent basis, he played well, just not consistent."

rangers,37t0wd,bjisba41,1 point,Sat May 30 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"We need a leading center. Not a 1A/1B. Not a power winger. Not a play marker. A power center, a guy like Stamkos, Getzlaf, or Toews. Play making centers who want the puck and want to shoot. I'm aware these guys would only ever be available through draft but that's who we need to find. I think Miller can progress well as a center. One day it could be him. But we should try and move a winger or Talbot for an up-and-coming one."
rangers,37t0wd,artvandelay1994,1 point,Sat May 30 09:11:44 2015 UTC,"Marty gone, Hagelin walks. Trade Talbot and Klein for an impact forward. Hopefully Boyle retires to free up an additional key 4.5 million this offseason. Let Skeij Bodie and Lindberg compete for key roster spots in training camp and see what happens."
rangers,37t0wd,bjisba41,2,Sat May 30 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"Hagelin is an RFA. He can walk over to the bench and not play if he does like our offer. If he gets a QO from another team we will get compensation, so Rangers are fine."
rangers,37poft,InDrublic,79,Fri May 29 12:32:19 2015 UTC,"Suits have always been in the stands. At every game I go to they are there. Doesn't matter if it's the lower bowl or the old  400s. They don't bother me. They leave work and hurry to the garden to watch the game. Most often than not they're season ticket holders so it's all good. Plus it's not like they're not knowledgeable, they love the team just like you and I do. LGR!!"
rangers,37poft,airgyros,15,Fri May 29 12:59:53 2015 UTC,Seriously. I hate when people say it's the guys wearing suits who ruin the place. I was sitting next to a guy at the last game I went to and he was in a suit. Loudest guy in the whole arena
rangers,37poft,Sailor_Chris,3,Fri May 29 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"Every game I go to I'm in a suit because I'm running over from work to get there. I try to always bring a shirt and my hat, if I know im going ahead of time. I lose the tie and put on the shirt under my suit jacket and scream.   We are not all douches."
rangers,37poft,famousmike444,7,Sat May 30 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, somewhat.  I've been to a few games, and yea, a lot of times it's guys who just got off work, came straight from the office and are just as stoked to go.  Other times though, especially in the corporate suites, they are only there because ""it's a place to be"".  I was in a suite for the last game against the Coyotes at MSG.  Guys in front of me had suits, but were big fans of the sport and the team.  Others in the suite were suits who barely watched the game, and kept talking shop all game.  Such a waste"
rangers,37poft,Drunken_Black_Belt,24,Fri May 29 13:26:53 2015 UTC,There's plenty of people with jerseys on who don't know what's going on as well. There's always going to be people there who go just because it's the hot thing to do.
rangers,37poft,airgyros,4,Fri May 29 13:33:48 2015 UTC,Oh that too. But it's one thing to be watching and non knowledgable and another to go and talk finance all game
rangers,37poft,Drunken_Black_Belt,6,Fri May 29 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, and it would be nice if everyone at every single game was there for the game, but the corporate suites are designed to be somewhere that companies can wine and dine people, show off, and talk business. Almost all sports arenas have them."

A lot of the time, the people who go, see this as a networking event which they can't refuse. It's unfortunate, but more of the blame should be on the firm who pays for the box and then gifts tickets away in order to impress clients.  I got invited to the US Open at Arthur Ashe and got to see Andy Murray play. But, the entire time I'm trying to watch I have people who are with the firm that owns the box coming up to me and asking me about my role and experience trying to network. I can't be a prick and tell them to shut up because I am their guest. It's a shitty thing all around."

rangers,37poft,Sailor_Chris,2,Fri May 29 14:54:22 2015 UTC,The garden is noticeably quieter than a lot of arenas but it's not because of the suits. It's because of acoustics and empty blocks of corporate-held seats. The Wall Street guys always go completely apeshit at a game.
rangers,37poft,callmesnake13,1 point,Fri May 29 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the garden is quieter than a lot of other arenas.  Having been to Flyers games, Devils games, Caps games, and Bruins games (all on the road against the rangers) I thought the only building that was louder than MSG was the Caps arena, and it wasn't because the fans were going crazy, it was because that ass hole with the stupid airhorn couldn't go more than 30 seconds without using it.  It was really fucking annoying.  Without the airhorn prompting the chant the caps building may have been the quietest of them all to be honest.  The garden gets a bad wrap because people like to hate awesome things.  I wouldn't trade the garden for any arena in sports."

rangers,37poft,PigeonProwler,13,Fri May 29 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who usually has to work right up until game time, this constant hate for people in msg based on attire makes me really frustrated.  Sure there are plenty of corporate non-fans at the game, but to think someone isn't a true fan just because he isn't wearing a jersey doesn't make sense.  I don't have time to go home get changed before the 7:00 games so I'm stuck in work clothes.  That doesn't mean I'm not rowdy as fuck screaming my ass off for the rangers."
rangers,37poft,Mophideus,2,Fri May 29 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"People have this perception of what a fan should and shouldn't be. But the common consensus always seems to be that 1) you have to dress the part and 2) you need to act the part.  As many of you have said, it's unfair to judge all ""suits"" as being shitty fans or to think that they might even be fans at all. Seems like some of you guys even happy to be ""suits"". I've sat next to them at games and sometimes they're the loudest ones. So I think it's fair to say that attire has little to do with fandom. Besides, how do we know some bandwagon fan who knows shit about hockey didn't just pick up a jersey or a hat before the game? We don't.  As for acting the part, I go to a couple of games a season if I can afford it. I'll show up at The Garden in my Ranger gear. Am I sitting there screaming my face off? No. It's just not the type of fan that I am. I'll get up and cheer when they score. I'll partake in a few ""let's go Rangers"" chants. I'll applaud when they clear the puck on a PK. But I'm not loud. I'm not trying to start chants. I'm not getting out of my seat and calling Crosby a pussy. So does that make me a shitty fan? Because if anyone wants to question my fandom, I'll have words with them."
rangers,37poft,otter_pop_n_lock,16,Fri May 29 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"I am a suit, but I leave a ranger jersey hanging in my office to wear to games. Also just because someone wears a suit it doesn't automatically make you (OP) a bigger fan."
rangers,37poft,nyg1,19,Fri May 29 17:50:34 2015 UTC,As long as the suits make noise and support the team as much of the rest of us I can't care less what they wear.
rangers,37poft,bleedblue314,-12,Fri May 29 14:04:06 2015 UTC,"But in general they often don't. They seem bemused by goals and all the cheering that the rabblerousers are producing around them. It's a all a fun spectacle.   That being said, you can put a Rangers jersey on a millionaire and they're still going to prefer paying some plebe to shout ""cheerio"" rather than do it themselves."
rangers,37poft,elyankee23,3,Fri May 29 13:10:33 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty much what I was getting at. Putting a ranger jersey isn't going to change the way they act
rangers,37poft,bleedblue314,5,Fri May 29 13:30:57 2015 UTC,What does being a millionaire have to do with anything? You can't feel emotion for a team if you have money?
rangers,37poft,HockeyVG,-6,Fri May 29 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"I regret nothing. Good to see the millionaires among us redditors are being supported. Lord knows they need it.   I was having a laugh, but in all honesty, I do think there's a direct correlation between the price of Rangers tickets and the fact that we have a pretty quiet arena in the playoffs. Say what you want about the suits being real fans, and I'm sure some of them are, but on average they're less likely to be there for fandom than the upper bowl people, and less likely to make noise."
rangers,37poft,elyankee23,3,Fri May 29 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"Correlation doesn't emply causation. The tickets are expensive because we just went thru a $1.0 billion renovation. It seems quiet on TV because the mics are set up to pick up Pierre, Doc and Eddie rather than the crowd noise. I've been to mulitple playoff games this year and in past years and its never quiet in there."
rangers,37poft,RIPCountryMac,9,Fri May 29 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"I don't get the hate for ""suits"" at the garden at all.  A ton of people are required to wear them for work, and then have to work long enough hours that they don't have time to go home and change.    Same goes for well dressed women in the front row.  I feel like a lot of people just assume that all women in the front row not wearing jerseys were brought there on dates.  I could be wrong, just a vibe I've gotten (mostly in /r/hockey).  If someone cheers, gets nervous, gets HYPE, they deserve to be there.  Stop trying to exclude people based on what they're wearing, it's shitty."

And I have several friends who wouldn't be allowed to change at work, even if they were about to walk out the door, because of dress codes.    And in the end I just don't think it matters.  We're a huge city with a ton of offices, a lot of them near MSG.  Most of us thought it was really crappy when TB had rules about what you could wear and where, so how is this different?  It's worse even, since we're talking about excluding our own fans."
rangers,37poft,Harkeshark,1 point,Fri May 29 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"It is incredibly crappy for TB to pull that crap. Honestly, I'm not for or against the OP's opinion, I really don't care so as long as the Garden is rocking and people come out to support the team. I wish I could be there."
rangers,37poft,josephnicklo,7,Fri May 29 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"How about we take pride that this is NYC, and not look to Tampa for fashion or fan advice? Personally, I like looking at our crowd and seeing all these upstanding office drones in their suits and business wear (myself included!) going absolutely apeshit when we score. That matters more than what we're wearing. LGR!"
rangers,37poft,PigeonProwler,7,Fri May 29 15:07:24 2015 UTC,"A note for all you people who believe that you need to wear a jersey to be fan:  The famous ""Now I can die in peace"" sign from the '94 cup win was held by a guy in a button down shirt.  Please shut up, we're all fans."
rangers,37poft,HockeyVG,12,Fri May 29 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"Since when did wearing a jersey make you a real fan? Who cares what you wear to the game.   This gets brought up all the time on this sub, and it's really pathetic that someone thinks they are a better fan because they wear a jersey and aren't rich. That is just ridiculous. Guess you can only be a true Ranger fan if you're poor? What is that?"
rangers,37poft,HockeyVG,-4,Fri May 29 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest with ourselves here. It's New York. It's the playoffs. It's Madison Square Garden. Celebrities and the 1 Percenters are jumping on the bandwagon. Aside from the few loyal Celebrity fans (MJF and a few others), I wouldn't call them ""true"" fans at all...just some wealthy people who know they'll get on camera for being at a high profile sporting event. Where are they in the regular season?"
rangers,37poft,josephnicklo,7,Fri May 29 14:04:35 2015 UTC,"And a lot of them are long time fans. Look at McEnroe, Boomer, etc. Every team has bandwagoners.

rangers,37poft,Sailor_Chris,7,Fri May 29 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give you a thoughtful response to this.  I think there are generally 2 groups of ""suits"" at games:  Group A:   Real Fans in Suits That Day  My family has had season tickets since I was 10 years old.  I'm now in my 30's and go to lots of games on weeknights straight from work. I'm not 1st row on the glass but we are in the lower level.  Ever try to put a jersey on over a suit jacket? Doesn't work. Ever try to figure out what to do with your suit jacket at MSG if you were to take it off? No great options that don't result in it falling to the beer soaked floor. For a playoff game (e.g., tonight), I will change at work into jeans and a jersey. For other games, I either don't go to the trouble of changing or I don't have the foresight to bring my jersey to work.  In any event, regardless of what I'm wearing, I (and other Real Fans) will watch the game for all 60 minutes, and cheer loudly in support of the team.  What I'm wearing that night doesn't matter.  Group B:  Suits who Happened Into Tickets (S.H.I.T.s)  These are folks who happened to get tickets that night. Often these S.H.I.T.s are in corporate-owned tickets for client relations purposes. Many times these S.H.I.T.s are actually legit Rangers fans.  Indeed, even for a ""big game"" like tonight, hockey is not the Super Bowl and the only clients who want to go have at least something of an interest in hockey. But being a Real Fan on the inside doesn't help you when you're a S.H.I.T.  I hate to say it, but I have occasionally gone to games in my company's tickets and, at those games, I have been a total S.H.I.T.  Even if there are S.H.I.T.s or, like me, occasional S.H.I.T.s there that want to be Real Fans, it is really hard to do if you are in S.H.I.T.-mode!  Clients want to talk about client stuff. And that Real Fan outburst at the referee is no longer funny -- it is borderline inappropriate. To many S.H.I.T.s, the game becomes an extension of work. But don't blame the S.H.I.T.s!  Those tickets are $400 or more per game in the regular season!   And I have no clue what a suite costs for the year. Many of those tickets have to be sold to corporations or they wouldn't be sold at all. And that money helps make being a Rangers fan better for the Real Fans.  All that said, if your main concern is attire, I will say that almost all fans, both S.H.I.T.s and Real Fans alike, will don the free t-shirts the Rangers give out in game 1 of each series. So if you just want people in blue, that's probably the solution."
rangers,37poft,nylawman21,2,Fri May 29 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Yes, a lot of people in those front areas are still big fans who can happen to afford tickets/work for a place that has tickets.  But there are also a good amount of them that are barely casual fans.  MSG still has a good atmosphere, but it's never going to be 10/10 craziness anymore."
rangers,37poft,parallacks,2,Fri May 29 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I would note that the 10/10 craziness, if it ever existed, was before the 1990s. Even back then, the ""red seats"" (first 10 rows or so around the ice) were pretty much the same atmosphere as the club seats post-transformation.  I think it was actually a little worse because of the internal hallways forming a moat around the red seats.  Back then my family's seats were in the 300s, and I distinctly remember hearing chants from the 400s directed at the red seats.  I believe it was ""red seats suck!"""
rangers,37poft,nylawman21,4,Fri May 29 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"Why are we Rangers fans picking fights with other fellow Rangers fans?  To someone like me who could only afford a ticket to tonight's game if my wife and I took a serious hit to our bank account and not pay our mortgage, this thread is making me feel down on a night I should be upbeat.  I would be thankful to just be able to GO to the game!  And you're all going to argue about who's a better fan?  Grow up. For real."
rangers,37poft,khalaron,1 point,Fri May 29 15:16:34 2015 UTC,Why are we Rangers fans picking fights with other fellow Rangers fans?   That's been happening a lot lately.

rangers,37poft,josephnicklo,9,Fri May 29 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"This is one of the stupidest complaints I've ever heard. I couldn't give two shits about what the fans at the Garden wear to games, and neither should you.   As others have said, imposing some kind of dress code would be a great way to piss off the fans who drop $1,500 to sit in the front row. Not because they can't afford a jersey, but because it's a slap in the face to say ""Hey thanks for buying these expensive tickets. Now, the only way you'll be allowed to sit here is by wearing this and only this."" Understandable to force NON-Rangers fans in those front rows dressed in opposing team gear to put on Rangers/neutral attire (as many baseball teams do when opposing fans sit behind home plate), but as long as the suits cheer just as hard as the guy in the Messier jersey, I don't care.   The atmosphere and appearance of the fans at the Garden is just fine how it is. Besides, we have much bigger things to concern ourselves with today.   LGR!!!!"

rangers,37poft,pejede,4,Fri May 29 13:14:19 2015 UTC,What makes them dickheads?  I agree that I would like to see ranger jerseys but people that work in the city and go straight to the game don't always have the luxury of going home to change or want to bring a change of clothes and carry around a bag all day of clothing.    I don't think you should be mad at people for being fans and going to the game when they have other obligations as well.
rangers,37poft,KaladinStorms,4,Fri May 29 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, points taken.  Of course you can be a great fan in suit.  Of course you can be a shitty fan in jersey.  I just think it looks better when the fans are showing their support for the team by wearing jerseys.  I just hope everyone who is lucky enough to go to tonight’s game is loud and cheers even if we’re down.    I didn’t mean to offend anyone but I realize I have and I’m sorry.  It was meant to be tongue in cheek.  I guess I’m just jealous because I can’t afford to go to the game.    I fucking love this team and I’ve watched nearly every game for the past 20 years and I want a win tonight more than anything in the world.

Brian Leetch used to say when we played together that there is nothing better than a Friday night at the Garden. The Garden will be rocking tonight. I anticipate a great game and you play all year to have home ice and because of that I think the Rangers will win in a squeaker.”"""

The Knicks are his team and he wants to be the one to get all the attention because he'll always wish he was a major league athlete. So he gets too involved with an NBA team that hates his fucking guts. Guy can't even tank right. He's fucked the Knicks and I couldn't be happier he's stayed away from the Rangers. He knows it's Sather's team (from a front office perspective) so he lets him do his thing.  In short, he wants to be a big deal, gets involved in the knicks, lets Slats handle hockey."

rangers,37rjdw,machphantom,2,Fri May 29 21:56:02 2015 UTC,"That's just not how things work. The teams have designated times for meeting with the media prior to these games, where it essentially becomes league/team-sanctioned Q&As with approved journalists.   Players are expected to be available to answer questions because that is what the league wants them to do. Team PR people are often(especially for the Rangers) hovering about during these sessions to make sure nothing gets said that they don't want to be said.   This is a well coordinated business."
rangers,37t98x,slicedpan,3,Sat May 30 05:13:27 2015 UTC,I agree. It blows to get this far and lose but I definitely think there's gonna be more opportunities coming. Let's all keep our heads up and look forward.
rangers,37t98x,Curiousme14,2,Sat May 30 05:16:54 2015 UTC,"I have had a few passionate Rangers fans (some on Reddit whose names won't be mentioned) say that this run was probably the last good one you guys would have in a while.  While I don't disagree, I would like to hear your reasoning as to why you ""promise"" this team can only go up, especially while the other teams in your division are strengthening with picks and FA signings while you guys have a lot of big contracts of decent players to decide whether to keep or release to FA.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Staal, MSL, Hagelin, and Stephan all expire at the season's end? Do you guys have space to resign these most of these guys?"
rangers,37t98x,KimmoTargaryen,6,Sat May 30 05:19:27 2015 UTC,"Most of the team is good through next year. After next year there is some trouble. I always thought we had as good of a chance next year as we did this year but there are some question marks after that.  Staal got a contract extension a few months ago. Whole defense core is set in stone (McDonagh, Girardi, Yandle, Klein, Staal, Boyle with the Yotes taking half of Yandle's salary)  MSL is probably either gone or will be making way way less.  Hagelin is an RFA, so he'll get a slight raise, probably not going to be a problem.  Step's gonna get PAID though lol. Way too important to us. Only real concern but I don't see us letting him go."
rangers,37t98x,Darclite,3,Sat May 30 05:49:17 2015 UTC,Arizona retained half of Yandle's salary? Holy shit that's nice.
rangers,37t98x,KimmoTargaryen,1 point,Sat May 30 05:51:20 2015 UTC,"Capgeek would be nice, but MSL is the only big piece that will go. The cap will go up, stepan will get some decent cash, other RFA's will stay put, and hopegully here'll be enough to bring in another forward.   Again..... that being said... capgeek would be great to look at"
rangers,37t98x,kerry_kittles_,1 point,Sat May 30 06:45:51 2015 UTC,"Fact is that in a post season where both the kings and bruins got left ou,t  the Rangers were out maneuvered by a team with two great lines. Not having Zuc was a massive blow. That guy creates chances, and losing him meant slashing apart lines that worked.  Rangers window to win with this core starts narrowing in two more seasons. Nash is up in 2018, Kreider,  Sterp and Hags will be free agents as soon as end of next  season. Yandle ufa end of next season.   Also, at some point Hank will start feeling his age, which for goalies is usually around 35-37 for elite caliber athletes"

If I were you I'd just try to convert some of your existing friends to hockey freaks rather than make new ones, and there's no better opportunity than an ECF game 7! I've gotten a whole bunch of my friends to start following the Rangers by just watching games with them and explaining the rules/our various beefs/which players to hate/etc.   Also a steady stream of alcohol will turn any casual observer into a die hard fan ;)"
rangers,37q4ff,jacybear,3,Fri May 29 15:37:09 2015 UTC,If you have any girl friends that are into sports it shouldn't be hard to have them switch over to hockey. I drew in many of friends both female and male by dragging them along with me to watch some playoff hockey

rangers,37q4ff,fullofgreendust,3,Sat May 30 09:17:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say my Ranger friends are pretty evenly split men/women.  Three of us ladies are going to catch the game on tv tonight!  It's not strange at all, embrace it!  In college I used to go to my guy friends' house and was in the same boat as you, like eight guys, myself, and possibly a girlfriend.  We are out there for sure.  I've also found it's easier than you think to convert girls to hockey fandom!"

My gf was never into hockey, but once we were dating for a while she fell in sync with the season schedule and wound up watching every game with me and sometimes with out me.

In terms of finding other women to watch the game with...I have no idea. I'm not a woman, so I wouldn't even know where to begin."
rangers,37q4ff,dovakinda,3,Fri May 29 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"Virtually none of my female friends are into hockey. I watch games with my boyfriend and his dad sometimes, but usually I just spend game nights on here."
rangers,37q4ff,CoMaBlaCK,3,Fri May 29 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"There are lots of us here in /r/rangers.  Or at least it seems so to me.  I've also gotten my roommates pretty into the rangers now.  I like to watch alone cause I get weirdly nervous, but they watch in the other room and yell across the apartment with me.  Lots of people, especially women since ""sports aren't for girls"", have just never watched hockey before.  Show them the light."
rangers,37q4ff,m4tuna,7,Fri May 29 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"Putting aside that you asserted you are a girl 5+ times lol...  I  just watch the games with my hockey pals. Two of the people are girls like me (other 5 or so are guys). One of the girls is a hard core redwings fan, but likes the Rangers casually, the other girl is a a casual hockey/Rangers fan, but seems to enjoy watching other sports like football a bit more. I just met them by going to the same bar in my neighborhood for Rangers games. Lucky j guess, but took a while.  Aside from them though, I don't care who I watch the game with as long as we are cheering for the same team. I will watch the Rangers with anyone, haha. Super fan or first time watcher? It's just nice to have company. It's better when you get to see the game with someone who knows exactly where all the players are at, the moment of the team, etc. but that's a pretty tall order imo. Everyone starts somewhere.   Not saying you do this, but I don't care for the types who make a big deal about being a Rangers fan and ~~girl~~. It makes me cringe and think they are just there for attention, which takes away from watching the game. This goes for anybody really, but I'm more sensitive to when girls do it because we are in the minority. There are fewer representatives. I want to be treated like a fan, not like, ""lol the cheerleaders love a good party"". I don't say anything to them or bad about them (it's a big assumption, and maybe I'm totally wrong), but if I feel the person is trying to make watching the game about them, I will avoid them."

rangers,37plbg,AnubisZX5,41,Fri May 29 11:59:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, it's time for another game 7.  This is the best time of the year to be alive.  It's time to pull that jersey out of the closet, find your beat up dusty Rangers hat, and start high-fiving everyone else doing the same.  It's time to remember where we were 7 months ago, where we are now, and where we're going. All of the big saves, huge bone crunching blocks, snipes, and lung bursting shifts are in the past.  They're memories of the journey, and reminders of strength when we're at our weakest.  What a long, crazy ride it's been!  So many terrible second periods, incredible comebacks, and momentum swings.  From the depths of despair to tears of joy, it's all been an incredible ride so far, but it isn't over yet.  We've got so much more to say, and so many more memories to make.  We'll go as far as we believe in ourselves.  And we believe in ourselves.  We believe that this is OUR time, OUR fight, and OUR moment to shine through.    So wherever you are today, make it the best day.  Tie it together with the best of moments.  Remember why we're here, and what's left to do.  No matter the outcome, we're in this as one.  All of us.  One collective heart, one pulse, one dream.  This time, we'll change the ending, and this time it's different than it ever has been.  We're bringing an army to this fight, singing loud and proud.    It's the best time of the year to be alive."

It was a good series and I wish I could be moving on feeling that way, but we just gave them this game. This was painful to watch."
rangers,37susu,TheeMC,15,Sat May 30 03:00:43 2015 UTC,They looked like fucking hot steaming garbage in the first and the rest they tried cute bullshit instead of coming out like a team. Don't fucking kid yourself
rangers,37susu,romano78,2,Sat May 30 02:56:44 2015 UTC,Hope they show some pizz-azz of the golf green if they are going to fucking play like that.   We should have beat Tampa but because we decided to not bring our offense back to New York for game 7.   This isn't the performance you see out of the President's Trophy winners and last year's Eastern Conference Champs.

They played fucking terribly. That is definitely true and we all certainly deserve to vent. This post is largely inspired by my stubborn insistence on rationalization during all circumstances, even when others need to talk more with their emotions. I appreciate the thought you put into what I'm saying though."

They were skating but I'm not sure they were playing hockey. This is a team that is built to win now and is not built well enough. How can you be happy with that? Do you want to be the San Jose Sharks of the East?

This year, he has been MUCH better. More decisive, more controlled. He takes more shots too. He has been one of top defensemen on the team, aside from Kostka (if you can believe it).  I think he has a really good shit at cracking the team this coming season. If not, if they aren't happy with his progress, I'd expect them to try and trade him."
rangers,37r376,k_nasty,1 point,Fri May 29 19:32:42 2015 UTC,Kostka deserved more of a shot with the team. He barely played at the beginning of the season and was relegated immediately. I wish we would've pulled him up at the end of the season so he could play a bit more

rangers,37tfyh,nyr16,7,Sat May 30 06:31:54 2015 UTC,Without Nash our PK wouldn't be as strong.  Without Nash there's a big chance we barely make the playoffs.  You want to get rid of a man who just scored 42 goals in the regular season?
rangers,37tfyh,Nether_Ending,-3,Sat May 30 06:36:59 2015 UTC,"yes I do. 7.8 mil is a huge smack to a salary cap is the main point. Aside from that i full heartedly believe we could have made the playoffs without Nash, and if we didn't, there would not be much of a difference between that and losing at any point along the path. And my opinion on your first point, is that Nash should not be on the PK. I am fully aware that he is a very defensively disciplined player, but Nash is a big guy, who honestly isn't as fit as some other top line players who clock in more minutes. The focus with Nash should not be on the PK, because hes here to score not to play defense. The short handed goals he had this season are pretty, I can not deny it, but how many short handed goals were there in these playoffs (probably can count on your two hands), and the rangers may have not even contributed to that, because short handed goals are not an important method for scoring in the playoffs."

rangers,37tfyh,tj_sad_boi_666,-1,Sat May 30 06:47:25 2015 UTC,his 9 assists warrant a 7.8 mil contract???
rangers,37tfyh,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Sat May 30 06:56:50 2015 UTC,Marian Hossa is making $7.9 mil and has the same number. Toews has the same number and is going to be making $10 mil
rangers,37tfyh,kerry_kittles_,2,Sat May 30 07:00:47 2015 UTC,"Toews quality of play is head and shoulders above nash in the Playoffs. Him and Kane produce year in and out in the post season. Marian hossa makes 5.2 mil, but I guess that's the same thing as 7.8 and their third/fourth best forward contributing as ~as many points as our number 1"
rangers,37tfyh,Legacy406,1 point,Sat May 30 14:45:12 2015 UTC,Toews quality of play is head and shoulders above nash in the Playoffs.     Evidently not by that much this season.

rangers,37t0qq,bgold4,7,Sat May 30 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"I can live with the MSL move. Callahan wanted a lot and I can't fault him for it. Marty wanted out of TB and only to come here. Why not, right? Losing the two first rounders sucked, but despite that he was a key part of our cup run last year. I will never forget his OT goals last postseason that got us to the cup.  The move with Yandle concerns me a little bit because we gave up another first rounder. But I'm not concerned about losing Duclair - he isn't even proven yet and our depth at the wing is fine.  What bugs me the most is Stralman. I wish we could have kept him instead of sign Dan Boyle.   In the end, you could look at all these moves and say ""oh but we didn't get the cup, it wasn't worth it."" Or you could say ""we did what was best to try and put us over the top, it was worth the gamble."" There's a few perspectives you could have on it - I try and see everything positively despite the loss here.   But in the end, I'm behind this team thru thick & thin. LGR."
rangers,37t0qq,artvandelay1994,1 point,Sat May 30 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"Agree for the most part, however...  I think Stralman gives us a much better shot at cup then Boyle (and I would have said the same at this point last year), and the two have comparable salaries.   Also, I agree on Marty, but two first rounders is HUGE for a player with a max of 3 years left. That's a ton to sacrifice.   I can't think of an angle where the Yandle deal makes sense. I don't think he is a serious upgrade over Moore (+ a first rounder??).  Anyhow, next couple years could be very promising, but I'd be very concerned past that."
rangers,37t0qq,artvandelay1994,1 point,Sat May 30 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"As long as Hank plays at an elite level (which I'm guessing is at least another 3+ years hopefully), I won't be concerned. Plus you can't look too far ahead because there is only so much we can attempt to predict."
rangers,37t0qq,darkknight915,5,Sat May 30 04:08:17 2015 UTC,Everyone is complaining about Yandle but he was literally thrown in at mid season and still was top ten in the NHL in points during the playoffs. Give him a full offseason camp under his belt and he's going to make a difference.
rangers,37t0qq,Nether_Ending,3,Sat May 30 04:12:55 2015 UTC,Yandle played incredible against Tampa. I will not miss Duclair if Yandle plays the way he did against Tampa.
rangers,37t0qq,StarkiusMaximus,2,Sat May 30 05:08:04 2015 UTC,"You can't help but like MSL, Yandle is a solid, solid defenseman who stopped Callys presence time and time again in a game where he'd usually thrive.  Hindsight is always better, but things happen.  The thing that really got me was the last one.  I HATED letting Stralman.  I'm not just saying this because of the series, you can check my post history.  I'm saying it because it didn't even feel as necessary as the Yandle, Cally, etc trades.  It was an overlook, and apparently they didn't only make the wrong decision, but they handled it in possibly the shittiest way they could have, besides taking an ad out in the times that reads ""Anton Stralman has a small dick"".  He was extremely put off by the whole situation.  I think I've typed for long enough.  I need to be alone now."
rangers,37t0qq,jedimasterchief,2,Sat May 30 04:09:38 2015 UTC,"The MSL trade was original a 1st and a 2nd round, with the condition if we made it to the SCF it becomes two first rounders. So that's fine to me.   Everyone seems to forget that Boyle and Stralman have different terms. Boyle now has 1 year left. Stralman has at least 3. That would mean our entire defensive unit is signed for 3 more years. All of them. McD, G, Staal, Stralman, and Klein. All signed for long contracts. There's no room for a prospect to develop. At the beginning of the season, we had John Moore as our 6th dman. He's an RFA that would also be developing. Thus causing even further problems for Dmen in Hartford. They'd leave us, like Hayes left Chicago."
rangers,37t0qq,nimperatori,1 point,Sat May 30 09:18:40 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. The Callahan trade was bullshit, but Yandle is a good player and played good for us in the playoffs and I think he'll be a great player for us next season. He will actually last us unlike MSL who is a one and done for us."

rangers,37max5,jedimasterchief,9,Thu May 28 21:23:35 2015 UTC,Sure he has a large contract but he accounted for 16% of our goals. Where is that offense going to come from? Who do you want to get that can score 30+?
rangers,37max5,thieflikeme,8,Thu May 28 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"nowhere.  Rick Nash is staying, he's earned the money he makes by leading the team by far in goals and being in the running for the Rocket Richard trophy.  He broke his own record for most goals in a season and is at the top of his game, there would be no reason to deal him unless the Rangers got an offer for him that they couldn't refuse."

rangers,37max5,SublimeOwnzzz,4,Thu May 28 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"I was at that game and it was deflating for sure.  In terms of my sheer disappointment leaving the garden the only thing that comes close was game 5 against Tampa Sunday when I expected us to come out firing.   That being said, Campbell didn't simply state the Rangers played a bad series, or that Pittsburgh was better.  He said the first round series vs Philly marked the two worst teams in the playoffs, that the Rangers were a bad team and they would not win a cup nor come close anytime soon so may as well burn the whole thing down.  He also took a thinly veiled shot at Zuc (yes, superstars need to be better but Zuc is one of the most creative players in the league) and said the Rangers would get ""ripped to shreds"" if they played in the West. Now that's where the idiocy comes in."
rangers,37max5,ScientistStephen,3,Thu May 28 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I never counted us out. I mean of course no one's feeling too optimistic right after a loss like that. But come game time when I ask ""can the Rangers win this game?"" the answer is always yes. As long as we have Lundqvist I believe we are capable of winning any game. No reason that can't happen 3 or even 4 times in a row."

rangers,37lvxo,MungTongue,18,Thu May 28 16:01:48 2015 UTC,"I know it's fun to be optimistic about the return of zucc because we all love him so god damn much and he's an awesome ranger, but, as much as I hate to say it, I think we have a bit of false hope going on here (just for this post-season).  Even if we take care of business tomorrow night, zucc has yet to actually participate in practice with the team in a meaningful way.  Concussions are no cake-walk as we've seen with our guys in the past (Nash, Sauer, and now Zucc).  I would love to see him have a miracle return, but I think we need to manage our expectations realistically.  With all that said I really, really would love to see him return before we close shop for the summer, but I just don't think it's realistic.  Hopefully I am proven wrong.  LGR."
rangers,37lvxo,Mophideus,7,Thu May 28 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed on that. Your list, took Staal like 2 years, Brian Boyle like two years to be ""back"" back. I think he's sparking the team just being around again. Brass said he was on the ice with him morning skate before his Hatty and zuccs made him feel different before the game"
rangers,37lvxo,owlsandbears,7,Thu May 28 16:49:00 2015 UTC,brian boyle was never there :-P
rangers,37lvxo,dberti22,6,Thu May 28 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"You're right but the team and the fans can still be optimistic about his presence in the locker room. I think that when they showed him on the jumbotron at game 5 last series, he gave the crowd and team a huge jolt. I actually like to think that he's the reason we scored that late goal. He just gives us that never say die attitude and just having him travel with the team is great.   Like brass and AV said, they love having him around because he smiles a lot and is making he best out of the situation.   Lets just be glad he's not in the hospital haha. Also, obviously we need him to have the great season we've had and we still wouldn't be alive without his presence. I've thought about how sad it is if the team makes it far without him but they're not really without him. Overall, even though he's not playing, he's helping this team."
rangers,37lvxo,otter_pop_n_lock,4,Thu May 28 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"You're right. What's more important is the long-term health of Zucc and if that means shutting him down for the rest of the season, so be it. I want to see him back as much as the next guy but I think we've all learned that head injuries aren't something to mess around with."
rangers,37lvxo,keetner,6,Thu May 28 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel like they're doing this to partially counteract all the ""A FRIEND OF A FRIEND OF A COUSIN'S SISTER BOYFRIEND'S DASHOUND SAW THE MAILMAN SPEAKING TO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS A BAKER WHO SOLD BREAD TO A FRIEND'S NEPHEW WHO KNOWS ZUCC JUST FROM BRIEFLY PASSING HIM IN THE STREET SAID..."" rumours.   Regardless of whether he is back for this post-season or not, at the very least, I'm just glad to hear that he's doing alright (eg. skating, travelling with the guys, etc). Wishing him a speedy and healthy recovery."
rangers,37lvxo,_TheConsumer_,1 point,Thu May 28 17:40:30 2015 UTC,"I think you're right - we definitely need to temper our expectations. It is great that he is skating regularly (IIRC, that means he's no longer symptomatic, even after physical activity). But, just because you're no longer symptomatic doesn't mean you're ready to play. We saw that with Nash last year. He was back relatively quickly - but his game was diminished for months.   His activity is also a good sign that it was only a concussion. It wasn't some weird brain injury that put him in a coma. (Ahem, Twitter/Reddit gossip ladies.)  Interesting side note- 15 years ago, a guy like Zucc would have been back on the ice 2-3 days later. Who knows how many careers were shortened by that ""warrior"" mentality?"
rangers,37lvxo,berdman11,5,Fri May 29 15:53:44 2015 UTC,"""Mats Zuccarello off the ice and into the Rangers' room when Rangers practice started in earnest."" according to beat reporter Andrew Gross.   Sounds like he's still a week away, best case scenario...which is fine if we take care of business tomorrow night."
rangers,37lvxo,MakeItNashty61,3,Thu May 28 16:05:47 2015 UTC,Step one obviously is win tomorrow. I do think he could be a possibility for a game 3 or 4. If he has back at all he could make a huge impact on this team late in a cup series. So I think the excitement is justified as long as you have a realistic time frame in mind. You also have to keep in mind that we need to win tomorrow first.
rangers,37lvxo,LIGuy631,1 point,Thu May 28 16:49:42 2015 UTC,Yeah series or not time will tell. After any head shot with time out just excited by his recovery so far
rangers,37lvxo,godlyjacob,14,Thu May 28 16:53:41 2015 UTC,"So many people on the Rangers FB group are foaming at the mouth about Zucc possibly coming back for game 7.  If he was 100% cleared, you still don't bring him back during a game 7.  He needs time to practice and get back into the swing of things.  You don't just throw him into the mix during an elimination game."
rangers,37lvxo,LIGuy631,27,Thu May 28 16:08:37 2015 UTC,Yes you do. He missed what? 3 weeks? Not 3 months. He didn't forget how to hockey. He provides so much to this team.
rangers,37lvxo,ranick10,10,Thu May 28 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"No.  You don't.  Hockey players are streaky enough as it is.  When you're in a game 7, you don't toss a fresh player into the mix who hasn't played in 3 weeks after a decent head injury, and just hope that he comes out playing as if nothing happened."

rangers,37lvxo,Chexjc,1 point,Thu May 28 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"While true, that's only relevant if St. Louis is pulled out of the lineup in favor of zucc, which he won't be. It would be Sheppard or possibly glass"
rangers,37lvxo,darkknight915,2,Thu May 28 23:26:47 2015 UTC,Am I mistaken or did we throw Klein right back in on his first day back?
rangers,37lvxo,Ben_Ulrand,2,Thu May 28 20:10:24 2015 UTC,Klein played in a game 1 of a series and came back from a broken arm. It's fairly different in the fact that he was able to at least skate while injured where as Zucc hasn't done much of anything conditioning wise for about 3 weeks. It's also like /u/LIGuy631 said it's not even fair to Zucc to throw him back into a game of this magnitude. If he makes a mistake or is rusty which is a high possibility the fan base is going to slam AV for putting him back out there in an elimination game.
rangers,37lvxo,brian2686,1 point,Thu May 28 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"Of course you do.  He's a professional hockey player and a good one at that.  Furthermore, it's not like he's been a couch potato this entire time.  He'd been working out and maintaining his fitness.    If he's 100% ready and cleared, play him.  Within a few shifts he'll be fine, if that."
rangers,37lvxo,Calculusbitch,3,Thu May 28 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"Cleared for contact doesn't necessarily mean he's in game shape. He 100% needs at least a few practices.   Best case scenario: He's cleared for contact on Monday morning and can play 48hours after that.   I don't see him getting re-evaluated over the weekend and then he needs 2 full days of practice, at minimum.   Most likely scenario: They put his name on the cup with the other Rangers and he gets the off-season to fully recuperate."
rangers,37lvxo,Frank_The_Unicorn,6,Thu May 28 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"Im still convinced nothing was ever wrong with him and we are using it as an excuse to have a healthy scratch (without negative press) so we can unleash a completely fresh forward in the SCF when every one else is gassed.....  It's a gamble, one that we will see rewarded with a win tomorrow night."

The one thing that the Rangers recent record in elimination games at MSG shows is that they bring their A-game when it counts. And I'm sorry, I know Tampa Bay is a top tier team, but when the Rangers play their best game, there's really not much you can do about it. Because their best game doesn't just include pretty good offense, it includes a top defense and a world-class goalie.    Good luck with that Tampa Bay."

Highway robbery that was."

I'm thinking of going to Stout myself.  Edit: If you have time, you should check out the Rangers Hockey House next to MSG."
rangers,37lab6,kreee,5,Thu May 28 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"All of the above. The Flying Puck gets crowded and crazy loud, but is pretty damn awesome. If you have to eat Mustang Sally's/Harry's is right there, as is Harrington's. All good places just south of MSG on 7th Ave."
rangers,37lab6,TotalHavoc,3,Thu May 28 14:04:32 2015 UTC,"I would suggest Stout, it's huge and you should be able to get a few beers (but probably not a table unless you go straight there from the airport). However you probably want to stop by the Garden first, definitely check out the hockey house as was mentioned above and take in the atmosphere, see the President's Trophy, etc."

rangers,37lab6,xdaero,8,Thu May 28 16:50:15 2015 UTC,The best Rangers vibe outside of MSG that you're going to get is at Hudson Station (http://www.hudsonstation.com/). They'll be hosting  the We Bleed Blue Game 7 viewing party with open bar (https://instagram.com/p/3M0FxNoNLQ/?taken-by=webleedblue).
rangers,37lab6,bkeschhh,3,Thu May 28 15:07:49 2015 UTC,This right here.
rangers,37lab6,Juicecoder,7,Thu May 28 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"As a resident of Queens (and a fellow Ranger), I'd love to weigh in on your journey over to MSG.    I'd recommend taking a Bus/Subway instead of the Taxi.  It'll only cost you $5.50, and with the traffic cars run into - it will probably take you the same (or less) time.  Here's some thoughts/directions:     The taxi from LaGuardia to MSG will be a bit pricey.  You're looking at $35-$40 at least before tipping.   It'll also potentially take a while, since you'll have to go through Queens then cross a bridge on a Friday just after rush hour.  Obviously most of the traffic will be headed out of Manhattan, but it could still be crazy.   If you're not familiar with Queens/Manhattan, the cabbies WILL take you on a longer route and drive up the price.  Unless you're confident about the quickest streets and keep them on track, it'll drive the price up.  Plus if it's busy they'll take alternate routes, which also drives the price up.     Now, here's what I'd suggest:     Hop on the m60 MTA Bus from LaGuardia (oh yeah, that's what it's called baby).  Look for the MTA Bus signs and you'll find it easily once you're just outside the airport doors.  The fee is $2.75, and you can pay using a Card or Cash at the little machines right where the buses pull up at.  It takes <30 seconds and is super easy.  Ask anyone around and they'll help answer questions.  We're actually friendlier than you think :)   Ride that m60 bus for about 15 mins or so to Astoria Blvd/31st St.  It's a common stop, and once again, ask anyone on the bus and they'll point it out if you're unsure.  Once you're off, turn around and you'll see the Subway stop (elevated), for the N and Q lines.  Walk up, pay the $2.75 fare, and grab either line (they both run on Friday).  You'll ride it for 11 stops until 34th St Herald Square.  Both lines make the same stops from where you're going to 34th.   Once you get off at 34th, exit the station and then just use the super simple street layout.  West up 33rd St and pass 7th Avenue.  You'll see it then.  Honestly, just follow the Rangers fans once you get to 34th St.  They know the way.  :)     BONUS: The bars/pubs mentioned already are good stops.  If you're looking for some gear, the team shop in MSG has a decent selection, but Modell's is better.  You'll pass it right before you get to MSG.    Hope this helps!  EDIT /u/RallyTowel: If you'll be here for a few days, it might make sense for you to get a weekly unlimited MTA pass.  It's $31, but you can get on and off the subway and buses as much as you like.  Once you have the card, you can just insert it at the bus ticket machine, and it spits out a bus ticket.  It's included in the unlimited plan for the week.  It's almost certainly going to save you money if you'll be traveling around the city a lot and don't want to walk everywhere.  Over three days, if you hopped on the subway or a bus 4 times a day, you'd spend $11 each day.  Might as well spend $31 and travel as much as you want.  Keep in mind each time you enter a station and get on the train, that's $2.75.  So a trip from say, 34th St to 186 St (Columbia University) is $2.75.  A ride back to 34th is $2.75.  So as you can see it adds up quickly.  Weekly/Monthly unlimited passes are your friend.  Plus you don't have to stand in line to buy a ticket each time."
rangers,37lab6,blueshirtdave,4,Thu May 28 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent info above, if you don't have a lot of bags then definitely take the M60->N/Q.   If you do take a cab, tell them to take the 59th street (Queensboro) bridge, and avoid the hell that is the Midtown Tunnel. And don't go with any of the shady people offering you rides, no matter how nice the town car looks. They take advantage of out-of-towners and charge you 2-3x cab fare once you get to your destination."

rangers,37lab6,aceofpayne,1 point,Thu May 28 21:59:38 2015 UTC,I thought airport to anywhere in Manhattan was a flat fare for taxis? Still a ton more than the subway and traffic is a killer as well. So I guess it doesn't matter because I would do what you suggested too as a life long Queens person. Lol
rangers,37lab6,esilac,4,Fri May 29 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Not quite as close, but not too far:  http://greybarnyc.com/  They have a projector as well as 10-15 TVs & the Ranger's get priority.  They also put the audio on the speakers which makes it a great atmosphere. Good food as well."
rangers,37lab6,Mophideus,2,Thu May 28 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"You guys are killing it! Thanks for all the advice. What does MTA stand for? Are there different buses, as in I'll have to find the m60 bus from MTA in a sea of other buses like BFD and PPQ?"
rangers,37lab6,Techngro,3,Thu May 28 15:25:29 2015 UTC,MTA stands for Metropolitan Transit Authority.  They control all of the public transit in the New York metropolitan area (up from Connecticut down to New Jersey).  All mass transit busses near the airport will be part of the MTA.  You just need to focus on hopping on the m60.
rangers,37lab6,irishdude1212,2,Thu May 28 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"MTA is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It basically covers all of the public transportation in NYC (5 boros).    Are you actually going to the game? Because it starts at 8pm and that's more than enough time to get from LGA to MSG. Honestly, you don't need to pay for a cab, especially a cab during rush hour. Just take the bus to the train and then you're set."
rangers,37lab6,blueshirtdave,1 point,Thu May 28 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't have a dog in the fight so probably not, but it may depend on how far down the ticket prices drop on Stubhub.

More recently around Manhattan in tourist spots like Times Square and MSG they ask me for my ID at the door.   You might be ok if you don't get a drink. But if you go to a bar and you are under 21 there is always the possibility that you might get asked to leave :( it kind of sucks.

rangers,37gywc,EggersIsland,79,Wed May 27 15:43:42 2015 UTC,Dont act like game 7 is a gimme
rangers,37gywc,MikeyRage,28,Wed May 27 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"This is by far the most nervous I've been for a game 7 lately. Tampa can score and last time the offense opened up they were non existent the next game.   Still, getting the chance is all you can do"
rangers,37gywc,PyreDruid,110,Wed May 27 18:28:40 2015 UTC,This is precisely why I'm nervous as fuck.
rangers,37gywc,esilac,36,Wed May 27 16:27:27 2015 UTC,^ I'm with this guy.
rangers,37gywc,tomj,15,Wed May 27 17:11:52 2015 UTC,This is great and all but we can't rely on this. Need the boys to come out flying and put a few past Bishop.
rangers,37gywc,Milol,8,Wed May 27 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"Not acting like this is a gimme.  Statistics are only as good as the sample size and it just takes one bad game.  However, I'm slightly less apprehensive than last night!"
rangers,37gywc,Shaman-d,18,Wed May 27 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Just because it rolls black 10 times in a row, doesn't mean the next one is going to land on red."
rangers,37gywc,iBS_PartyDoc,10,Wed May 27 16:35:16 2015 UTC,Well this isn't exactly a dice roll. Perhaps Hank has a secret bank of adrenaline that only gets released on Game 7's.
rangers,37gywc,TALQVIST,12,Wed May 27 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said. Excited, but apprehensive. No, it's not a gimme, but I wouldn't rather anyone else between the pipes!"

In fact Im rather nervous.  On another note, if we win, we would have won 5 elimination games this post season. Is this the most we would have won?"
rangers,37gywc,PyreDruid,2,Wed May 27 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"No they won 5 last year.   Game 7 round 1, game 5,6,7 in round 2 and game 4 in the finals."

My sister lives in Chelsea and just missed bumping into the tripod (Hags, Brass, and zuc). She called Hags over when he was on his way out and he talked to her and her friends for a while (she's obsessed with him) and he told them Zucc and Brass literally just left. She's just a bit of a stalker and might just know where Hags lives (in Chelsea) and apparently the three of them either all live there or go out in the area.  P.S. Hags scored later that night after going scoreless for a bit so maybe my sister needs to take off work the next two days and stalk the streets of Chelsea"

Typical conversation from there as a 10ish year old talking to someone who I think is my dad's old friend he bumped into. As soon as the guy walks away with his wife and baby stroller my dad is like do you know who that was? IT WAS MIKE FUCKING RICHTER. He was my idol but I was too young to recognize him off the ice. He was such a nice/humble guy."

There are always outliers, though. I've never had a bad experience there. But then again, I only go for Rangers atmosphere. I wouldn't go otherwise. Last game two Tampa fans were there, causing noise when Stamkos scored his one goal. Our 5 shut them up pretty quick. They left when it was 4-1."

They first threw out my buddy for no apparent reason and when I protested/demanded to know why, they forcible picked me up and threw me out. One of the bouncers punched me in the thigh and it def caught some sack.   But that was probably well after midnight, so I'm pretty sure the Ranger's games are a lot more tame. And we probably deserved somehow."

rangers,37jqat,Fergus_CL,6,Thu May 28 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"chicago would be less travel. They're more banged up. We've handled great scorers like Kane.  My only fear? Richards. We played a former player in last years final in Gabby and it didn't work so well.  But in reality, I'd prefer Chicago just to remind the NHL who's great: The Original Six.   That said, I don't really care, I think we can beat either in a seven game series. But we need to focus our mental energies on force choking Tampa Bay first."
rangers,37jqat,saintstryfe,4,Thu May 28 07:18:58 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see ny put chicago down, but that's more about a general 'fuck off' for chicago  obviously LA can fuck off too, but I think we'd rather the kings for that, no?"
rangers,37jqat,mexicaaaan,7,Thu May 28 07:03:21 2015 UTC,"SHOULD the Rangers advance, it would be either NYR against the Blackhawks or against the team that beat the Blackhawks. The Rangers would be considered the underdogs regardless.  That being said, the Blackhawks are basically running 4 defensemen out there who are taking a physical beatdown at the hands of the Ducks. Hawks have tremendous offensive power but the Rangers have done an efficient job of shutting down Crosby, Ovechkin, Stamkos, and the Triplets line through 18 games. The benefit of playing the Ducks is a lack of experience (for the coach and players) and Andersen has been roughed up quite a bit. Ducks PP has been garbage against what was an even worse Hawks PK.  I think the Rangers may line up better against the Hawks but the Ducks weren't really tested in the playoffs until now. I think I'll go with Anaheim. Idk if I can take any more Chicago bias. In the meantime, LGR on Friday night!"
rangers,37jqat,NYSportsGuy4,7,Thu May 28 03:37:09 2015 UTC,"I think Rangers fans undersell their team. The Rangers have arguably the best goalie in the world, supported by the most talented blue line in the world. They're far from an underdog.   K. Yandle R. McDonagh D. Boyle D. Girardi M. Staal K. Klein H. Lundqvist.   It's retarded how good the Rangers' back end is."
rangers,37jqat,Blue_Freezie,-6,Thu May 28 13:13:41 2015 UTC,You haven't watched Girardi and Boyle this season... Thank goodness Yandle finally relaxed and is settled in. Now if only Klein could return to midseason form we'd be pretty set.
rangers,37jqat,TotalHavoc,9,Thu May 28 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"I can only think of how well Girardi played this season... can't recall any particularly bad plays/games. Especially this postseason, I'd say Girardi has been pretty solid?"
rangers,37jqat,inferno214,-1,Thu May 28 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"Girardi has been his usual standard self tbh. He is great at making desperate defensive plays, giving 110% percent, laying out to block shots, and playing pretty well physically. But he is a bad possession player and routinely ends up with one of the lower Corsi ratings on the team. And this is DESPITE playing with McDonagh, one of the better Corsi players on the Rangers. Girardi is usually more of an anchor for McDonagh and turns the puck over too much. Stralman would've been the better player to keep imho, and he would've cost you a million less against the cap too.  This is not to say I don't like Girardi. But he's not a top pair defenseman; he doesn't drive possession well enough for that role. He is a solid second pair defenseman who excels defensively and on the PK, and would work great paired with someone like Keith Yandle on the second pair. But if not for McDonagh (or with Staal before that), he'd be exposed a lot more."

rangers,37jqat,thebabybananagrabber,5,Thu May 28 14:54:02 2015 UTC,I would say the ducks but they turned into a complete powerhouse during the playoffs. I think it's a tie.
rangers,37jqat,hman1025,1 point,Thu May 28 03:10:37 2015 UTC,They played the two worst teams in the playoffs first two rounds.
rangers,37jqat,NJ_Yankees_Fan,4,Thu May 28 07:54:48 2015 UTC,And are possibly about to advance over the Chicago motherfucking Blackhawks.  They are for real
rangers,37jqat,notromanbellic,2,Thu May 28 13:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on the west teams. I'd like for us to play ANA so I can go and watch us win in persons I think we match up better. But if we play Chicago it'll be a tighter series and we can play our hockey, low scoring and finesse. But I don't want Chicago to win the Cup if we lose. 3/6 Years of cup winning no thank you"
rangers,37jqat,jedimasterchief,2,Thu May 28 03:30:46 2015 UTC,I say it dont matter.  If we make it to SCF. Bring on whoever.  We got this.
rangers,37jqat,shredmasterJ,2,Thu May 28 12:17:01 2015 UTC,Chicago.   Better TV ratings. The sport needs more exposure and what better way to do it than by having two Original Six teams from two of the biggest cities in the U.S face off against each other for the Cup?
rangers,37jqat,josephnicklo,2,Thu May 28 15:35:58 2015 UTC,I like Anaheim a lot and I would like to see a gritty and physical Stanley Cup Final

rangers,37jqat,gigglyweeds,1 point,Thu May 28 12:05:48 2015 UTC,Either team is a worthy opponent. I want to see Chicago advance even though I think if the rangers win I think they will find beating Chicago challenging. But it would be so much fun to watch.   I see the Rangers having an easier time with the ducks because they are so much faster.  Rangers have to win on Friday though otherwise I don't think I could bear to watch the final.
rangers,37jqat,NJ_Yankees_Fan,1 point,Thu May 28 13:20:56 2015 UTC,The Rangers
rangers,37jqat,TotalHavoc,0,Thu May 28 05:36:52 2015 UTC,Still not convinced about Anaheim. They're poor in goal and defense and they had the easiest road to the conference final after playing in the league's worst division. Chicago is terrifying and will be a tougher challenge with their depth on defense and Kane and Toews.

Practice ends and about 15 of us are waiting in the lot for autographs as the snow is starting to fall. Kovalev and Niklas Sundstrom come out and sign for everyone there. Took pictures with whoever wanted and just stood around shootin the shit for a bit. I was about 12 years old and just completely starstruck. Once they had taken care of everyone there they get in their cars, Kovalev in his Lexus and Sundstrom in a total beater. These two guys in their 30s are complaining that their car is on the other side of the lot and it's cold as shit. Sundstrom tells them to hop in and drives them to their car.   My mom wrote a letter to the Rangers praising them on how classy they were. Rangers sent me a puck and some other swag.   20 years later and I remember it like it was yesterday.

His odds of winning the hand and winning the game should be equal after going all in, since if he loses one he immediately loses the other.  Edit:  I realized that what I just said there was wrong.  They would both have to be all in, or the other person's odds would be the same of winning the match and winning the hand.  If the guy all-in wins the hand then he continues play.  My bad."

I feel like that is applied here, rangers have a 10% better chance of winning taking into account the momentum, home ice. Cool stuff. Computers and poker, then relating it back to hockey.

Maybe not great (MSL is not playing ""great"") but there are tons of points, tons of big moment plays, etc.  Nash is on fire.  Yandle has been fantastic with 4th most points and a +7 (remember when we were worried about his regular season +/-?).  Even if someone has a bad game, another member of the squad always seems to step up and fill the gap when it counts.  Also who the fuck seriously thought they should pull Hank after those blow outs?  I was worried, sure, that maybe this would break him.  But he stepped up and kept us in it as he always does.  In other words, fuck the haters and LONG LIVE THE KING."

The hate has died down once Nash started doing something and rightfully so. I was extremely frustrated with him prior to this series but I'll be the first to admit that I can't say a damn thing about him now...and I'm damn happy for that!   In regards to you saying ""fuck the haters""...I think that way of thinking is silly and juvenile. We're all Rangers fans and all entitled to our opinions. When a fan favorite gets called out, no one likes it but when someone like Tanner Glass (who may not be good but he does hustle and plays hard when he's on the ice) gets shit on all day long, it's ok. Pretty much a double standard. The whole thing where a bunch of Rangers fans saw Glass exiting MSG after a game and turned their backs to him was flat out disgusting.  Whether you're going to defend a player's poor performance like he's your first born child, or whether you're going to get pissed at a player for poor performance...just be consistent.   Still...MSL is done though. The dude needs to just ride skate off into the sunset and hang em' up."

I think the biggest conflict amongst fans is come playoffs he's an 8 million a year role player. We could have kept cally and prust for that price. He's being paid the big bucks to score goals.

rangers,37c2h0,dakraiz,90,Tue May 26 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"quick story about that game:  I was 6 years old and about halfway through my day in first grade, when the school nurse calls my teacher over PA system. She tells the teacher to have me pack up my things and report to her office.  I walk down to the nurse's office and find, of all people, my dad standing outside her office. He says that he told the nurse that I was sick in the morning and he just got me a doctor's appointment, thus was taking me out of school to head there. That was a lie.   He actually secured two tickets to Game 6 in New Jersey (side note: even at 6 years old, I knew how important this game was. My dad and I watched the 1st period of every game that started at 7:30PM that year, before I had to go to bed. Every morning after a game, I'd ask my dad for the rundown of how the rest of the game played out, and would pour over the sports page for every little ounce of information I could pull from the box-score, the game report, the standings, etc.). Inside my dad's car were my Rangers hat and jersey which he got for me for Christmas that year.  We spent the next 3 hours on the Merritt Parkway, driving down from CT through a ridiculous storm where trees had come down all over the road, however the weather would not stop us. We listened to Francesca, who, like every NY area sports personality, was splitting time between the Rangers and Knicks on air, but all the Rangers fans were flooding the lines.   We get to the game, scarf a few hot dogs and get to our seats, where we meet up with our old neighbors who were Devils' season ticket holders, and helped secure the tickets.   First period, we go down 2-0, and I remember sulking in my seat. In between the first and 2nd periods, Yogi Berra was brought out to give some sorta speech, I couldn't tell you what he was talking about, as my mind was fixated on the deficit we faced.  We all know what happened in the last two periods of that game, and certainly it will always live forever in Rangers lore. For me and my dad, it was point of pride and a moment that we could always look back upon.   For years after, especially in those awkward teenage years when you shy away from your father, my dad would bring up Game 6 of the ECF, and the story of how he yanked me out of school to go to the greatest game in Rangers' history.   The Rangers have always been our common denominator. Regardless of what was going on in my life, with job struggles, relationships, and all the other tribulations of growing up, we'd always be able to ground our conversations on the Rangers. Even years after, when I'd moved to the West Coast, we'd talk on the phone about the recent Rangers runs, who was playing well, who needed to step up, etc. Even over this Christmas, my dad bought me two tickets to see the Rangers out in San Jose for January 10th this year.  I never made it to that game as my dad passed away unexpectedly the morning before. Instead of watching that game, and sending my father pictures during the game, I found myself on a redeye, desperately trying to get back to my family to make sense of what had happened. Over the last couple months, I've found myself caught in moments of remembrance of all the times my dad and I shared together. This is the first year I haven't been able to call up my dad, or vice versa, and figure out together how the Rangers would need to break down a strong opponent.   This has been a pretty rough winter and spring, but I've been able to watch these games over the last few months and think of my dad throughout. Regardless of how tonight's game goes, I know that he'd be proud of this team and how they've performed with the adversity of losing Hank. More importantly, he'd be happy to know that even without his physical presence I'm still thinking of him during every game.   TLDR: Let's go Rangers"
rangers,37c2h0,OweDoyle,14,Tue May 26 17:10:35 2015 UTC,Damn near teared up. My dad and I are the same way about the Yankees.  We also had a similar experience in that we got to watch Game 6 of the 09 series together. Maybe being a bit selfish but hoping I can also see a Stanley Cup game with him at MSG as well.
rangers,37c2h0,machphantom,2,Tue May 26 17:29:49 2015 UTC,Same here. My dad isn't a huge hockey fan (though he does root for the Rangers in the playoffs) but we are both huge Yankees fans and have bonded over the Yankees for years.  I'm trying to get my dad to play NABA baseball with me since he hasn't played in any rec league anything since I've been born.

He's a sort of nicer Tortorella, and I love the way he handles the stupid questions every coach/player is asked after every game.  It's not just him being salty, he's this way even when they win. When he does give real answers, they always feel more genuine and honest than the answers that sound pre-programmed like a lot of coaches give.  I can't stand the majority of sports reporters, asking questions that everyone knows the answer to just for a sound bite they can use in their same articles and stories, over and over again.

rangers,37cd4y,saintstryfe,0,Tue May 26 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"This feels like the most important game in 20 years.  And I don't have happy feelings unfortunately. Last game was entirely deflating as a person who's watched this this team. They're capable of so much more but they're simply not doing it, and I don't know how else they can attack. The Lightning are just too quick to respond to any changes, while AV, bless his hard work, just doesn't change that fast.   If we can win tonight, we'll win game 7. We don't win tonight, I don't see us winning a Stanley Cup until we rebuild the team from the bottom up.   AV, this is your night to prove you're more than a great regular season coach. I hope, no, I pray, you can do that. This is the night. I wish I could feel peppy but I don't. Please give me a reason to hope."
rangers,37cd4y,Ralph_Baconader,2,Tue May 26 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"Even if we hypothetically lost tonight, we made the finals last season, and two other conference finals since 2012 and you're talking rebuild ""from the bottom up""?"
rangers,37cd4y,saintstryfe,2,Tue May 26 19:41:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do think that. The people we have now can't get it done if they don't do it tonight. They're blocked at that hump. People like Nash, MSL can't get it done. Other players like Girardi, Stall, McD will be labeled as such too. And taking them out you're rebuilding around a 30+ year old goalie.   Please don't misunderstand me - I really REALLY hope they do... but I can't pin my hopes on it. I cannot assume given how we've lost two of these games - by a blow out and by a complete no-show - we can do this unless our coach can adjust and fix the problems. I truly pray that he can. Sadly, history doesn't back him up."
rangers,37cd4y,Ralph_Baconader,1 point,Tue May 26 19:57:49 2015 UTC,"Yeahhhh so, we don't ""rebuild around a 30+ year old goalie."" Hank has had absolutely zero signs of decline, and no injuries other than his freak injury which will likely never come up again, unlike knee and hip injuries which are somewhat common for goalies. The Rangers organization will actively try to win the cup every single year probably until Hank hits 40. You're right that MSL can't get it done anymore, so we don't resign him, that a pretty easy fix. Also I have complete faith in Girardi, McD and Marc Staal*- please try to spell our players names correctly."

rangers,37caqd,colin6,17,Tue May 26 16:02:20 2015 UTC,Zuuc would be a fucking Rangers legend if he somehow plays tonight and helps us win. A la Willis Reed (even though he didn't do anything in the game he famously played in)

rangers,37caqd,Enzo95,3,Tue May 26 18:00:45 2015 UTC,Willis opened the game with two made jumpers before leaving though...then Walt Frazier went off and won the game with 36-19-7 and (they didn't keep track of steals yet).   The hockey equivalent would be if Zucc came in for a couple of early shifts and set up a goal before sitting out and the team winning behind Lundqvist masterpiece

rangers,37caqd,LIGuy631,3,Tue May 26 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yes.  If the trainer feels they're well enough to skate on their own, but not well enough to take hits, they'll wear the non-contact jerseys.  Otherwise the regular practice jerseys are blue (home) and white (away) for scrimmages."
rangers,37caqd,Sparvy,5,Tue May 26 17:10:22 2015 UTC,I've heard teams often do regular jerseys regardless on game days and consider all players no contact instead. Don't want to risk losing any just before the game.

The only way I would go is if there was a good chance the game would be on in the suite because then I could just drink a ton of free beer and watch that. I wasn't sure if anyone knew if that would be the case.

rangers,37dcvf,fullofgreendust,3,Tue May 26 22:41:13 2015 UTC,It's disrespectful to attend the Yankees game just to watch the Rangers in the booth.   If the game is on in the background and you watch the Yankees cool.   It also depends who else is going to be in this booth.
rangers,37dcvf,jedimasterchief,2,Tue May 26 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"these are suite tickets from a big name we work with.   If any of their representatives will be attending and sharing the suite with you, don't do it. If you're alone, LGR. but really LGR either way"
rangers,37dcvf,mozeknows,2,Tue May 26 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's complicated it's our suite but clients get access to it depending who they are. Regardless, I think for the sake of my job I may just sit this one out and watch the game from home. They cannot fire me if I yell terrible things from my couch...so that seems to be the best option. Sucks though Yankees Suite tickets are great."
rangers,37dcvf,hman1025,2,Tue May 26 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"So in case anyone cares this is how last night ended up....   Went to the Yankees game walked into the suite NBCSN was on so I was thrilled. Around 7 the TVs all automatically switch to the Yankees game because the game is on Pix 11 and the pre-game coverage was on YES. I think ""fuck fuck fuck"" but did not want to say anything to be rude. The client that was host noticed and then said ""Someone get a damn employee in here to get the Rangers game on before I kill someone""  So in conclusion I underestimated the power of the Rangers fan base and was clearly not the only one who had this thought last night.   Yankees Won. Great night. Great Wins All Around. Most Importantly LGR."

rangers,37c5ep,anthonysciotto,10,Tue May 26 18:20:29 2015 UTC,It'd be funny if everyone just wore St Louis/Boyle/Moore Tampa jerseys and went ape shit.
rangers,37c5ep,One_2nd,10,Tue May 26 16:21:43 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents but I'd just leave it alone. It must suck for die hard Lightning fans and season ticket holders to have their home arena constantly overrun by visitors. A home arena, especially during a playoff run, should be a special, sacred place but when ""Henrik"" and ""Potvin Sucks"" chants are almost as loud as their ""Let's go Bolts"" chants, there is an issue, IMO.    Sure, their policy might have overstepped some ethical boundaries but it's intent is pure and I just don't think there's a need to impose a flame war over it, especially when we have greater things to worry about (ie winning game 6)."
rangers,37c5ep,must_be_the_mangoes,9,Tue May 26 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"We aren't as outnumbered as you think, and honestly the handful of crybaby fans we have are the ones making us look bad. I've only had a FEW run in with bad opposing team fans (Boston fans mostly) but everyone else is there for the love of sport.   Those who are calling over management for opposing jerseys need to stop. It just makes us look pathetic, and it's unfair to the fans who may have been civil and are just there to watch their team.   I am, however, sick of the stigma we are getting over this. Our fans did not create this rule, and only a handful of assholes are narcing on your fans. You'll find us to be one of the nicest fanbases, and like everyone, we have our shitty people. Do what you must with the whole tweeting thing, but please remember, these rules do not reflect our fanbase."
rangers,37c5ep,Squeaky_Is_Evil,2,Tue May 26 19:55:41 2015 UTC,Agreed.. But then work to develop your own fanbase and arena culture. Clamping down on the flair paying customers choose to wear and on respectful celebration is just totalitarian-style bullshit. It is just as shameful as when the devil's employed similar tactics -- and bragged about it -- in the 90s before their cup runs.

rangers,37c5ep,kthoag,6,Tue May 26 17:13:44 2015 UTC,Why?
rangers,37c5ep,tomj,6,Tue May 26 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"Because Tampa fans in their building have been using twitter to alert ""guest services"" if Ranger fans are wearing Ranger jerseys in ""designated parts of the arena that forbid away colors from being worn.""   Guest Services actually supply neutral colored shirts that visiting fans must put over their jerseys in certain zones in the arena.   Being that Tampa fans have been notifying guest services through @TBLightning, it gives us the opportunity to have fun with this situation. I think this is a brilliant idea."
rangers,37c5ep,The_estimator_is_in,9,Tue May 26 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's sad that out of the 1.5% of ""no opposing color seats"" in that whole arena, you want to launch a twitter war flooding of their twitter feed. #NotYourPersonalArmy  Edit opon request of OP."

rangers,37c5ep,kthoag,0,Tue May 26 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"It's a painfully stupid move by management.   I understand the aim of the policy - but enforcing it is just pure douchebaggery.

rangers,37c5ep,Russki75,3,Tue May 26 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Just kind of seems like a waste of time, will affect 3 guest services workers and one Twitter rep, and no one else will know or care. Meanwhile, I'll be watching the game (Hayes will score tonight)."

There's a pre-order window to help people who want to go to a home game be able to do so, and the front two rows of seats and a section of the second tier do not allow away jerseys, but the vast majority of the seats are absolutely fine for away fans to wear their team's jerseys.  As far as ticket prices go, even on the secondary market, you'll get an amazing seat for what a ""cheap"" seat costs in MSG.  If you get a chance to go, I recommend it!

I now live in the Bay Area, and that last game against the Kings in the finals happened on the same night when the Yankees were in town to play the A's.  So there were many Rangers fans in the Coliseum that night, and we all gathered in the stadium bar to watch the Rangers, thinking that we'd grab our seats once the game was over (of course that didn't happen until the 8th inning, thanks to the overtimes).  Anyway, it was basically several hours of New Yorkers screaming at the TVs about everything the Rangers were doing wrong, how they were overpaid scrubs, and so on.  All the A's fans who happened to walk past were shocked and a little confused by us.  (The average Californian is many times mellower about their sports fandom.)  Like, ""Um, doesn't playing in the Finals mean your team is really good?""  SHUT UP, A'S FAN, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, THIS IS HOW WE DO."

They were subdued (either by our defense or by their fear of opening up) and were vulnerable.   The Rangers owned puck possession last night - but had few (if any) scoring chances. I kept screaming at the TV ""shoot the puck!"" It's great, you stayed in TB zone for 2 minutes - but one shot during that time isn't going to hack it.   So, I have no faith in a team that can't win winnable games...in the playoffs. There was no sense of urgency, and that frightens me."
rangers,376n5k,_TheConsumer_,20,Mon May 25 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"Should you be mad? YES. Should you be upset, frustrated and disappointed?ABSOLUTELY.  But do you start talking shit about YOUR team?? The team YOU want to win??   I find these to be completely contradictory. All I ask of this ""high level, NHL"" team is that they show up and play 60 minutes. They killed the first 30 minutes, then let the lightning back in the final 10 minutes of the second. Then, they make ZERO push until the LAST MINUTE of the 3rd, still down 2 goals. Don't even have to mention the PP, which was great this series, turned to total shit.  So yes, I'm going to talk shit, because the game thread is a DISCUSSION thread. I can't tell you how many people downvote me or ask me ""are you even a fan?"", like they're all high and mighty, when I post some negative feedback. At this level, these guys can use some criticism. Their cup window is closing fast, and not even scoring a goal and getting shutout in a very pivotal game 5, at home none the less, is a big fuck you to the fans. This team has talent, and could beat the lightning, but sometimes the passion/drive/determination isn't there at all.   So sorry if me saying things like ""this game is over"" after 2 periods, or ""Staal is playing the worst games of his career"", offends you. I believe I am justified. If that hurts your feelings, have the mods ban me. And for the people questioning my love of this team, I believe I'm a bigger fan than all of them, because I take it to this level."

rangers,376n5k,tomlambsays,3,Mon May 25 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference from being negative as a player and being negative as a fan. I get negative as a fan sometimes because I have no control, I can't play, I can't score, and I can't even talk to the team to inspire them and fire them up. As a player it's completely different. I would be positive because I was playing and they were my teammates. If they weren't playing well I at least had the chance to light a fire under their ass, or at least help them to make adjustments if I notice anything that we can do better.

rangers,375oqv,owlsgohooot,2,Mon May 25 02:44:39 2015 UTC,Let's hope they win on my birthday. :( Going to an Irish pub.
rangers,375oqv,nysportsfan87,6,Mon May 25 02:51:10 2015 UTC,They lost in a shitty showing on my birthday last year. I feel you.
rangers,375oqv,TwistEnding,34,Mon May 25 02:40:08 2015 UTC,45 seconds left and they're not even shooting the puck. what the hell are they thinking?
rangers,375oqv,wellfuckme_right,23,Mon May 25 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"""I'm tired and this is boring. I want to go home."" Just like a bunch of 5 year olds"

rangers,375oqv,wellfuckme_right,10,Mon May 25 02:37:03 2015 UTC,Because if they lose they still get their millions and go spend summer travelling and playing golf. We get nothing. :(

rangers,375oqv,nugget136,29,Mon May 25 02:39:33 2015 UTC,There was a time during this game when we looked so dominant.  Fucking FINISH.  FUCK.
rangers,375oqv,rangersmetsgiants27,3,Mon May 25 02:32:50 2015 UTC,It's at the point where when the Rangers look dominant I actually get uneasy. That shouldn't happen.

rangers,375oqv,rangersfan2,20,Mon May 25 02:33:21 2015 UTC,Rangers played like the game was over once Tampa scored.  We should not be getting shutout in the third round of the playoffs.
rangers,375oqv,mattypong,10,Mon May 25 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"Word of the day today: ""Wide"". Worst thing to watch ever."

rangers,375oqv,darkknight915,9,Mon May 25 02:33:40 2015 UTC,I can see it now. Zucc scores 4 goals in his series debut from injury to lift the Rangers to game 7
rangers,375oqv,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,2,Mon May 25 02:34:15 2015 UTC,Zucc hug me.  :(
rangers,375oqv,mrpark3s,15,Mon May 25 02:43:11 2015 UTC,"that was a completely embarrassing game, how can you put forth that performance on home ice?"
rangers,375oqv,Mr_Tophat_Jones,8,Mon May 25 02:34:08 2015 UTC,Worst game of the playoffs?  Everything looked good in that first PP and then everything went to shit.   Tampa had way better scoring chances last game and we lose this one. Ridiculous
rangers,375oqv,Matthias86,8,Mon May 25 02:34:39 2015 UTC,5 goals against to a shutout.... Damn. Good first period but gotta finish
rangers,375oqv,AwesomeExo,22,Mon May 25 02:34:42 2015 UTC,Hash tag rangers in 7

rangers,375oqv,daveedgamboa,7,Mon May 25 02:38:31 2015 UTC,Pros: Hank looked great.  Cons: Did you watch the game?
rangers,375oqv,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,14,Mon May 25 02:40:44 2015 UTC,Embarrassing. At home. Fucking disgraceful. No fucking effort out there. They should be fucking embarrassed. Can't even hit the net.
rangers,375oqv,daveedgamboa,6,Mon May 25 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"What a fucking embarrassment. Bring on game 6 I guess.  Shooting into the chest/pads, turnovers in the center of the defensive zone, shooting right into defensive players, missing passes 10 feet away and so little fight in the 3rd."
rangers,375oqv,Saladus,2,Mon May 25 02:32:46 2015 UTC,I still don't understand how no one fakes a shot. Teams do it against us constantly
rangers,375oqv,MagicSeat,3,Mon May 25 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"The answer is, they're not the rangers"
rangers,375oqv,chenzo512,5,Mon May 25 02:36:01 2015 UTC,Fuck everything about that game
rangers,375oqv,MagicSeat,6,Mon May 25 02:33:29 2015 UTC,...fuck  Not this goddamn elimination game bullshit again.
rangers,375oqv,hman1025,8,Mon May 25 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Tampa has a good chance of just putting this away. Idk what the fuck the Rangers are waiting for here."
rangers,375oqv,chenzo512,1 point,Mon May 25 02:35:58 2015 UTC,So did Washington.
rangers,375oqv,Nether_Ending,7,Mon May 25 02:38:54 2015 UTC,Yeah but tampa actually scores goals
rangers,375oqv,brampower,3,Mon May 25 02:42:10 2015 UTC,Yeah but it wasnt the same style of play. Nearly every game there was a battle and good effort. I haven't questioned the Rangers like i have this series. =/
rangers,375oqv,strongbad3689,8,Mon May 25 02:46:30 2015 UTC,Still staying positive.. This team thrives on the brink of elimination. AV knows what he has to do next game. The boys know what they have to do next game. They're not going down without a fight. LGR!! BELIEVE.
rangers,375oqv,_TheConsumer_,6,Mon May 25 02:35:21 2015 UTC,Bullshit. They knew exactly what they had to do this game. They did the opposite.
rangers,375oqv,airbagged,6,Mon May 25 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"Series isn't over. But certainly not a confidence builder. I honestly can't think of a single positive that game, other than they have a lot to work on and can hopefully be motivated in Game 6. What happened to the offense? Did Bishop have to make a single tough save? Hank was good again. Maybe could have saved the first goal, no chance on the second. Power play continues to be the bane of my existence. I don't understand how it can be so bad and they just keep doing the same thing over and over and over and over until it doesn't work and then they do it again until they keep failing at it. Effort level wasn't there. Several players are still in regular-season mode. Need to get some gritty goals, need to put in a better effort. Just crash the net with speed and get a bounce or something, goddamn."
rangers,375oqv,darkknight915,6,Mon May 25 02:36:05 2015 UTC,The Pros were that Hank looked great and we dominated the first period and a half.  The cons were every-fucking-thing else.
rangers,375oqv,JSolo1797,5,Mon May 25 02:40:12 2015 UTC,How in the hell do they keep making that cross-crease shot?  :(
rangers,375oqv,Broddit5,6,Mon May 25 02:45:27 2015 UTC,The Rangers go down to block shots too early and Tampa is just waiting for it and make that extra pass and bam they get a guy wide open because our d man is still out of position to make a play.
rangers,375oqv,Broddit5,15,Mon May 25 02:47:59 2015 UTC,Someone tell me every Henrik Lundqvist elimination game stat there is. I need to feel good.
rangers,375oqv,Broddit5,5,Mon May 25 02:33:33 2015 UTC,hank is 14-3 in elimination games since 2012
rangers,375oqv,The_Orange_Bird,5,Mon May 25 04:27:13 2015 UTC,in that 14-3 his worst save % is .926
rangers,375oqv,chenzo512,11,Mon May 25 04:30:40 2015 UTC,In every single elimination game he has looked fucking beautiful and has 100% perfect hair.
rangers,375oqv,MagicSeat,1 point,Mon May 25 04:33:22 2015 UTC,I'm confident now.
rangers,375oqv,chenzo512,8,Mon May 25 15:37:16 2015 UTC,Yeah but his stats aren't great against the Lightning.
rangers,375oqv,truthlesshunter,15,Mon May 25 02:37:26 2015 UTC,Shhhhhhhhhhh
rangers,375oqv,truthlesshunter,3,Mon May 25 02:41:53 2015 UTC,I mean...what? :)

rangers,375oqv,joliedame,4,Mon May 25 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"i'm aware. it's just funny that the person was asking for support and someone with a flair from another team just tears him down, hehe"
rangers,375oqv,razzbaronz,3,Mon May 25 02:46:14 2015 UTC,Love you guys.
rangers,375oqv,joliedame,3,Mon May 25 02:44:14 2015 UTC,I follow both teams all season every season. Love my Rangers and my Stars. I thought the games against Dallas this season were outrageous.
rangers,375oqv,ajpod,23,Mon May 25 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"I had my heart broken twice tonight. Once by an ended relationship and once by the Rangers. But tomorrow, I'll still wake up and breathe and ""lace up my skates"" and face another day. We're still in this. We still have heart. We'll be ok. I love you all."
rangers,375oqv,minarets1834,5,Mon May 25 03:15:38 2015 UTC,Great attitude. Sorry about the bad day.  It'll be better soon.
rangers,375oqv,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,9,Mon May 25 03:29:12 2015 UTC,I know it will. I'm still breathing. I'll be ok.
rangers,375oqv,Crossfire912,6,Mon May 25 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, hope things look up"
rangers,375oqv,surren,8,Mon May 25 03:42:36 2015 UTC,"At least we know we play our best when facing elimination. Other than that, I can't think of anything positive"
rangers,375oqv,Duck_It44,6,Mon May 25 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"I can't agree more, this was all u could think during the third..."
rangers,375oqv,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,3,Mon May 25 02:36:44 2015 UTC,It's so hard to eliminate teams is our only saving grace
rangers,375oqv,DeanYoungblood10,4,Mon May 25 02:40:30 2015 UTC,That was pathetic.
rangers,375oqv,captars,5,Mon May 25 02:33:35 2015 UTC,fuck
rangers,375oqv,callmesnake13,5,Mon May 25 02:33:49 2015 UTC,this team has been so inconsistent these last few weeks... 5 goals the last game so i guess that evens the average out for this game.
rangers,375oqv,aw9417,5,Mon May 25 02:34:14 2015 UTC,Did they switch out our players during the 1st Intermission?  I think them may have just dressed up some junkies and sent them out onto the ice with promise of opiates and laxatives after the game.
rangers,375oqv,stevemillerisevil,6,Mon May 25 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"Not good, not good at all.  Think they might be cooked here."
rangers,375oqv,ajpod,9,Mon May 25 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"The Rangers sucked, plain and simple. It was an embarrassing display this deep in the playoffs.  They deserved every single boo they got."
rangers,375oqv,fakeplstictrees,9,Mon May 25 02:36:08 2015 UTC,They actually looked completely dominant for the first half of the game. And then I don't know what the fuck happened
rangers,375oqv,darkknight915,4,Mon May 25 03:37:21 2015 UTC,that was fucking terrible. i don't know what i just watched.
rangers,375oqv,NYHComedy,4,Mon May 25 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"Our coaches need to step it up. If everyone is getting their shots blocked, adjustments are needed."
rangers,375oqv,LittleMissLokii,5,Mon May 25 02:34:59 2015 UTC,you could just see the momentum shift after Tampa scored that first goal
rangers,375oqv,Gyroflex,3,Mon May 25 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, thought we were fine until they scored:/"
rangers,375oqv,blueshirtdave,5,Mon May 25 02:42:45 2015 UTC,Also where are the in game adjustments? what is this coaching staff doing at intermissions? clearly what you were doing after the second was not working anymore make some changes holy shit. AV just keeps changing lines as if thats the answer.
rangers,375oqv,TheGreenBastards,6,Mon May 25 02:42:37 2015 UTC,"Waited to watch Game of Thrones until after, still heard the theme song playing by the organ dude during third period."
rangers,375oqv,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,3,Mon May 25 02:51:06 2015 UTC,Breathe in  Breathe out  Game 6. Let's go.
rangers,375oqv,AoifeCheeks,7,Mon May 25 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"the fuck did i just watch? they had no urgency the whole damn game, if they play like this in tampa we are going to get ran off the ice"
rangers,375oqv,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,6,Mon May 25 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, crap :( Tough loss, and I'm sure that was frustrating to watch. There's two games left in this series, so we're not done yet. Keep your heads up and let's come out flying in game 6. We beat them in Tampa, and we can do it again. I still believe!!  See you in game 6.  LGR. <3 you all"
rangers,375oqv,LordKaT,3,Mon May 25 02:37:20 2015 UTC,Fuck
rangers,375oqv,high5sexwhoa,3,Mon May 25 02:33:35 2015 UTC,Ugh.
rangers,375oqv,fakeplstictrees,3,Mon May 25 02:33:50 2015 UTC,I hate everything.  I hate this game. Rangers fucked up tonight and now we need to fucking come out like a wrecking ball on destruction day for Game 6.
rangers,375oqv,Jwpt,3,Mon May 25 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm gonna smash my TV. Someone please help me get a new one.    Fuck, 18-24-61-b-17-17-4"
rangers,375oqv,hen12yc,3,Mon May 25 02:35:46 2015 UTC,"This fucking team, man."
rangers,375oqv,nimperatori,3,Mon May 25 02:36:45 2015 UTC,Well that was disheartening. What a terrible effort. Back's against the wall again.
rangers,375oqv,NJ_Yankees_Fan,3,Mon May 25 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"START SKAPSKI!!!!!!!!  Totally kidding, guys.  Calm your tots.   Edit: Meant tits, but okay."
rangers,375oqv,TwistEnding,3,Mon May 25 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"My tater tots get pretty excited, you're still okay."
rangers,375oqv,keetner,3,Mon May 25 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"Fucking disgusted - After getting utterly stopped on their two consecutive power plays, they just went completely lifeless. They never showed any urgency from then on (not even in the 3rd!!!). FUCKING PITIFUL, the Bolts clearly wanted it more today.   Now my memorial day monday is ruined too, FUCK!"
rangers,375oqv,runninhillbilly,3,Mon May 25 02:42:19 2015 UTC,"Well...Time to regroup and take this to game 7 I guess, we were in a deeper hole vs Washington. And I think people are overreacting a bit, this is a concerning loss but nothing that the Rangers haven't dealt with or seen before. Hopefully we come flying out of the gate like we did in game 4 and hope for the best at this point. Plus Zucc is day to day so it would be great if he came back for this series."
rangers,375oqv,superchronics,3,Mon May 25 02:44:23 2015 UTC,Hopefully we have a hat trick on our hands on Tuesday for us.
rangers,375oqv,Ghostinthamachine,3,Mon May 25 02:44:58 2015 UTC,Somebody better call people out and fire up this team in the locker room after that poor excuse of a performance
rangers,375oqv,must_be_the_mangoes,3,Mon May 25 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"Ergh...pretty frustrating game.   We looked quite good in the first period, but close to the latter part of the second, things just started falling apart (momentum definitely shifted in Tampa's favour with those goals :/). I'm always so wary going into the second because it seems like we always end up (i) taking our foot off the gas and/or (ii) we show our entire hand in the first period that the opposing teams adjust very quickly and come back. I got the feeling we were waiting for the third to come to regroup and do better, but that second goal really killed the momentum.  That said, I don't think we played like complete shit. Rather, I think Tampa very much stepped up their D (eg. SOG was quite low today + two goals). I noticed they cut off a lot of our passes, took away the boards, forced us to chip/dump and chase all the time, and always had guys back in their zone. It was frustrating because even though we had solid offensive zone time, they really kept us to the outside + made us take long shots. And with Bishop, it's hard to score like that when he can basically peer over everyone.   I thought Miller had some good looks tonight and Marty with some early ones -- unfortunately the puck really bounced around him. But still...sigh. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. Not only will it be an elimination game, but I imagine the guys might be kind of fatigued from having to travel back and forth at this point. I really, really hope we can make quick and effective adjustments for Game 6. Incredibly anxious for Tuesday :(."
rangers,375oqv,Rocketman_man,7,Mon May 25 02:56:05 2015 UTC,Don't know what happened. We looked great until that shitty first goal. Then it just looked like the guys gave up.
rangers,375oqv,itsstevens,3,Mon May 25 02:45:49 2015 UTC,we're gonna win on tuesday
rangers,375oqv,blu3shirt,5,Mon May 25 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"That was a bipolar effort to say the least.  He first 30 mins looked good, good speed and pressure, just not finishing and got too cute with the passing again.  They get one goal and it totally deflated us.  Are the Rangers that fragile?  Hardly.  They were down 3-1 to Holtby and the caps and pulled it off.  Bishop isn't unsolvable, we just need to put bodies in front of him, actually take shots, and not shoot into his damn logo. Tonight, he wasn't even tested.  I'm sure everyone will clamor about how he shut us out, but anyone who watched that game will know that we defeated ourselves.  The players have to realize it and the coaches have to recognize it, that was an uninspired effort.  We're capable, we know that, so it's a matter of playing like we want to win and playing our game. They can win if they have the right attitude and put forth 60 minutes of effort."
rangers,375oqv,thatonedouchebag,5,Mon May 25 02:50:32 2015 UTC,We're gonna win it in 7. I stand by it.

rangers,375oqv,titfaced,2,Mon May 25 04:19:37 2015 UTC,After what they did in game 6 in Washington I'm confident they could push for game 7. The King won't go down easy. Best Road team in the league two years straight for a reason.
rangers,375oqv,MikeyRage,6,Mon May 25 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"Team deserved every boo, every jeer, every bad word that was said towards them tonight. It's one thing to play poorly. It's disgusting when you don't even put any effort out there. Fuck that dog shit effort. I'll be there for game 6. And I pray to the hockey gods that this team decides they want to play for a championship again.   Embarrassed doesn't even begin to describe what I feel supporting what we just saw out there."

rangers,375oqv,Nezirsc,2,Mon May 25 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"Staal needs to not play anymore I'm sorry; he was out of position on that first goal, takes 2 boneheaded penalties , the second one leads to a goal. He's been horrendous this entire series and it's costing us now."
rangers,375oqv,donthateflatulate,2,Mon May 25 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"Just got out of a class that started at 12 PM only to watch the last thirty seconds were we not only lose but get shut out. Fuck... Whatever, it wouldn't be Rangers hockey if we weren't fighting for our life in the series. Lets take this back to Tampa and then win in front of our home crowd."
rangers,375oqv,Rocketman_man,2,Mon May 25 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"Still optimistic, they've been here before. This team seems to only play up to the situation. I fully expect them to win Game 6. But whether this inconsistent, bi-polar team is championship-caliber, I don't know..."
rangers,375oqv,King_Karfa,2,Mon May 25 02:41:44 2015 UTC,I should learn to expect this. No team I cheer for will ever win a title in my lifetime. I hate sports.

rangers,375oqv,josephnicklo,2,Mon May 25 02:48:58 2015 UTC,Legitimate question for anyone who was actually at the game: Was there booing as the final seconds were ticking down? It sure sounded like booing from what I heard from NBCSN. The worst fucking thing any fan base can do to their team is boo them. Some of these professional athletes actually do this for the love of the game and for their fans more than they do for the money. To drop all pretense of supporting the team and utterly booing them is a worse injury to these players than the loss itself. Shameful behavior.  Please tell me I misheard the TV.
rangers,375oqv,zombiexsp,2,Mon May 25 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"Please don't ever move to NYC because you'll get eaten alive.    I'm not into booing, but I won't blame those who expressed their dissatisfaction with tonight's limp-dicked effort.    I know, I know, those poor players. :'("
rangers,375oqv,nyyankeegal,1 point,Mon May 25 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"I was at the game. Was surprised how loud my section was for how low we sat. The sections on either side of us weren't as loud though. Garden was very raucous for Amirante and then about MSG typical volume the rest of the game. After each TBL goal, the crowd still got a LGR chant going to try and lift the team. But when the team wasn't even shooting with less than a minute left, yeah, there were some boos. I can't say I blame them. It really looked like the team just gave up."
rangers,375oqv,shy_guy_ry,3,Mon May 25 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"I don't even care, I'm preparing for elimination. There is no way in hell they can win this by playing like that. Fucking disgrace to New York sports"

rangers,375oqv,Kalothe,1 point,Mon May 25 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"Looked pretty good. I'd wager it was a better played game than game 4, but we just couldn't score.   We controlled the first almost the entire time, the second we played well too, but slumped for a few minutes and were reeling by the end of the period. The third was okay. Clearly saw the effort, but we struggled for those last two minutes trying to at least put one on the board."

Effort was there, Tampa just clogged the zone in the second half to hold onto their lead.  They did it to Montreal.  Rangers did look down for sure after down 2 but you cannot say they weren't trying hard.  Trust me, losing is worse for (most of) them than for us.    Let's hope they make the correct adjustments for game 6 and our beloved team executes. We need to win just one game. LGR."

Is there any way we could get a gif of Kreider waving his finger at (I think) Kucherov at like 17:30 in the 2nd period?  That was some funny shit."

rangers,375oqv,donthateflatulate,2,Mon May 25 02:59:11 2015 UTC,Because they assume they can ban visiting fans from the internet like their shitty arena.
rangers,375oqv,iamirishpat,0,Mon May 25 21:48:12 2015 UTC,They think everyone is against them so they whine and since everyone is actually with them people hop on to their whine trains and then it sounds like a nursery.

rangers,375oqv,Jwpt,-2,Mon May 25 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if they seem defeated in their post game interviews or just calmly confident.    AV also seemed to sort of blow off a lot of their poor play, but maybe he's just trying to stay positive for his guys.  Also, I'm coming to really hate John Cooper.  He seems like an arrogant braggart, and he talks way too fucking much.  AV's pressers are like a minute long, but Cooper's always last like 8 minutes.  Shut up dude."
rangers,375oqv,Major_Tom42,1 point,Mon May 25 02:56:57 2015 UTC,Welp. Looked good at the start of the game but after Tampa scored we looked fucking atrocious.  At least you HAVE to think the boys will show up with a sense of urgency for game 6. They seem to like elimination games!
rangers,375oqv,TwistEnding,1 point,Mon May 25 03:27:51 2015 UTC,"What really frustrates me about this is I numbed myself before the last game thinking of we went down 3-1  that I would just accept it.  Instead, we win 4-1 and I'm heavily emotionally invested again.  And then they break my heart again.  It's like I need to numb myself again in case they lose the next one."

rangers,375oqv,andrewanthem,-3,Mon May 25 02:39:11 2015 UTC,I feel embarrassed to be a fan of this team right now. The hustle is fucking atrocious. Kreider took like 10 seconds to get up when he fell and was clearly not injured. No heart. Literally zero heart. I feel like I'm watching a bunch of pre-schoolers who get tired and bored after like 5 minutes and just decide to sit down in the grass and not play anymore. This is just ridiculous. The team deserves to be booed after this. They get paid millions of dollars to play this game and half of them didn't even try. Frustrating to watch to say the least!

rangers,375186,_TheConsumer_,8,Mon May 25 00:40:38 2015 UTC,Rangers are in control right now. Tampa looks worn down and the Rangers look hungry. Gotta feast right now though.
rangers,375186,VSPinkie,6,Mon May 25 00:41:14 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with the possession but, we definitely need better scoring chances."
rangers,375186,liquid1ce,7,Mon May 25 00:47:50 2015 UTC,Spending 80% of the game in the offensive zone doesn't mean shit if you can't finish and they can capitalize on their breakouts.
rangers,375186,roadcrash1,7,Mon May 25 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that goal wakes up the Rangers and they start shooting more.  Need to send players into the crease, screen the goalie, shoot for the pads and get the rebound.  Dirty goals!"
rangers,375186,isthatyoujohnwayne_,7,Mon May 25 01:29:54 2015 UTC,Yeah real injured there Boyle.
rangers,375186,DDSloan96,7,Mon May 25 01:32:17 2015 UTC,"Staal having an awful game. Garbage period, holy shit."
rangers,375186,liquid1ce,6,Mon May 25 01:41:32 2015 UTC,OPs mom isnt singing yet. It aint over. We gotta come out flying.
rangers,375186,Matthias86,8,Mon May 25 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"Kreider required to take 1 stupid penalty per game, hopefully that means he will also score."

rangers,375186,misterlakatos,7,Mon May 25 02:10:34 2015 UTC,Is it too much to ask for an Anaheim-esque explosion right now
rangers,375186,coltrane2989,7,Mon May 25 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"I truly feel sorry for our fans who paid a shit ton of money to watch this abysmal, embarrassing shit show of a game."
rangers,375186,wellfuckme_right,7,Mon May 25 02:22:53 2015 UTC,Oh my god. What a fucking awful game. Absolutely embarrassing effort tonight. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Heres to game 6. Hopefully something kicks in for this team.

rangers,375186,shy_guy_ry,7,Mon May 25 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"If we keep the cycle game and our defense respects their speed we can herd them to play our game.  There offense scores a lot- and last game was a test. But their defense shows many holes, and give up lots of puck movement in their end.   Their triplet line can't back check! Let's kill it"

rangers,375186,Other_World,6,Mon May 25 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"Why can we just NEVER play odd man rushes? We literally fuck them up every single time. EVERY FUCKING TIME. I'd rather see a normal attack at this point, better chance we'll score."
rangers,375186,fakeplstictrees,5,Mon May 25 00:30:56 2015 UTC,Rangers throwing the body around without abandon. Love it. Punish these kids.

rangers,375186,fakeplstictrees,7,Mon May 25 00:40:00 2015 UTC,Wow Nash drew a penalty - he normally gets mugged and it never gets called.  Lets go PP!
rangers,375186,fondlemeLeroy,6,Mon May 25 00:44:27 2015 UTC,That's what we get for our shitty powerplay. Why aren't we taking shots like that?
rangers,375186,Nether_Ending,7,Mon May 25 01:17:23 2015 UTC,TIE THIS SHIT UP
rangers,375186,strongbad3689,6,Mon May 25 01:27:49 2015 UTC,I've never seen a team so bad at finishing. It's honestly impressive.
rangers,375186,TimmyC,7,Mon May 25 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"Get to the net and fire the puck, we can beat Bishop. They'll come back. LGR!!"
rangers,375186,crazyg0od33,6,Mon May 25 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe how bad the power play is, or how bad it can be in stretches. Aside from that first one, total crap. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rangers were outshot in those last 3. Not only does it kill all momentum, but it takes all the scorers off the ice because they just had their shift on the PP, while Tampa's scorers are rested. See: Tanner Glass vs. rested Stamkos. They REALLY need to make some changes on the PP and it boggles my mind that it always looks the same. No different looks"
rangers,375186,C_L_I_C_K,6,Mon May 25 01:30:08 2015 UTC,How do you leave them so much space on a power play..
rangers,375186,Nether_Ending,7,Mon May 25 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"looks like its one of those games again, boys"
rangers,375186,AoifeCheeks,6,Mon May 25 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, time to start crashing the net on Bishop. This guy can and will give up a lot more goals, but the Rangers need to play like they're desperate all of 3rd period if they're going to win this game."
rangers,375186,rangersmetsgiants27,5,Mon May 25 01:39:32 2015 UTC,Its not over. There's still 20 fucking minutes. The boys will come out firing.
rangers,375186,dakraiz,6,Mon May 25 01:42:06 2015 UTC,Kreider's hitting things. Let's do it.
rangers,375186,_TheConsumer_,6,Mon May 25 01:42:46 2015 UTC,How many wasted odd man rushes do we have these playoffs?
rangers,375186,AoifeCheeks,7,Mon May 25 02:00:05 2015 UTC,HIT THE FUCKING NET
rangers,375186,darkknight915,7,Mon May 25 02:07:05 2015 UTC,I don't see this working out in our favor tonight.
rangers,375186,dezzrokk,5,Mon May 25 02:08:20 2015 UTC,"look at that, another odd man rush ruined.  Come on Rangers, you really need to step up your fucking game tonight, kind of pathetic."
rangers,375186,avicon,6,Mon May 25 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"Nothing getting to the net, can't even generate momentum right now."
rangers,375186,Other_World,5,Mon May 25 02:09:14 2015 UTC,How is there not too many men by Tampa?
rangers,375186,bjisba41,6,Mon May 25 02:09:37 2015 UTC,Yea it's been like that all series.
rangers,375186,liquid1ce,5,Mon May 25 02:13:34 2015 UTC,I don't get excited when I see an odd man rush anymore. I was excited when they entered the zone but once i saw it was a 2 on 1 I knew nothing was going to come from it.
rangers,375186,brampower,6,Mon May 25 02:14:31 2015 UTC,They haven't scored on an odd man rush since Jagr was on the team
rangers,375186,slimer16,5,Mon May 25 02:15:37 2015 UTC,Rangers need to fake the shot more often ... let them snow angel and then skate around them.
rangers,375186,_TheConsumer_,6,Mon May 25 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Two guys. Laying on the ice. Couldn't move. HOW DID THEY STILL BLOCK THE SHOT?! Please, rangers. What are you doing. Please."
rangers,375186,darkknight915,6,Mon May 25 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"They were doing this against the Caps, taking too damn long to setup the shot"
rangers,375186,misterlakatos,6,Mon May 25 02:20:26 2015 UTC,Attention Rangers: Shots from the point do not work on blocking teams like TB.   Get in close. How many rushes were stopped and kicked back to the point? Enough already.
rangers,375186,AoifeCheeks,7,Mon May 25 02:21:44 2015 UTC,Shutout at home after two back to back games of scoring 5. What a disgrace.

Last night there were several quality chances missed because there was no one home. There are only a few forwards on this team willing to screen the goalie, and I'd argue even they don't do it often enough."
rangers,3765mx,One_2nd,2,Mon May 25 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"Most of our goals have come from in close, either rebounds/deflections/jam-ins.   I have no idea why the Rangers were obsessed with shooting from the point last night. Every rush into the O-zone was delayed, the carrying player kicked it back to the point and the shot was taken with zero screen/bodies in front of Bishop.   None of our goals have come from this approach. It is lazy and (if repeated on Tuesday) will cause the Rangers to get their golf clubs."
rangers,3765mx,_TheConsumer_,2,Mon May 25 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"I think point shots are a good strategy, so long as they get some bodies to the net. Make it tough on bishop and pick up those rebounds."
rangers,3765mx,One_2nd,1 point,Mon May 25 17:41:22 2015 UTC,Priority number fucking one of offensive strategy needs to be just park the biggest fucking body on the ice in front of Bishop

rangers,373l77,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,28,Mon May 25 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"I've already seen it in this thread, but let me just jump in and make it clear; neither St. Louis or Zucc belong on the fourth line. The fourth line isn't just where you put your ""worst"" players or players coming back from injury that ""need time"" to get back up to speed. The fourth line is a grind line, a checking line, and both Zucc and St. Louis couldn't be further from the type of player you put on that line. St. Louis belongs on the third line, Zucc will be back on the first line the first game he's back."
rangers,373l77,Tsunkatse,9,Sun May 24 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's pretty obvious that our 4th line will be Fast, Dom, and Glass, and it will be a force to be reckoned with."
rangers,373l77,dakraiz,18,Sun May 24 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"Miller, Dom, and Glass. Fast has proven to be far more consistent/responsible than Miller and he makes that 2nd line better. Personally, I'd even consider keeping Sheppard in for Glass (not happening lol) or Miller."
rangers,373l77,Schrambino,4,Sun May 24 17:17:41 2015 UTC,"Normally I would prefer shep, but I think Glass has somehow been better this post season. And I think it is very possible Miller is on the 4th too. I could see Miller, Fast, and Hayes all shuffling around on lines 2 through 4."
rangers,373l77,dakraiz,4,Sun May 24 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"I don't see Hayes going down, too much production"
rangers,373l77,The_Other_Manning,2,Sun May 24 17:33:18 2015 UTC,I don't think he should either. I just mean that on a game to game basis they will likely be shuffled depending on performance. Kind of like how Hayes temporarily was on the 4th in game 3 and Miller was bumped up.
rangers,373l77,dakraiz,2,Sun May 24 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I fully agree. It's been a while since I saw a major defensive lapse from Tanner. He's hitting people hard and everything, but he still has next-to-zero offensive awareness. Miller is like the exact opposite, great offensive skills but every few defensive plays he makes some idiotic mistake and needs a bailout. Sheppard IMO is a solid defensive forward with 2-way stick skills and some semblance of offensive awareness."
rangers,373l77,Schrambino,5,Sun May 24 18:00:04 2015 UTC,I say keep Fast with Stepan and Kreider since he's been playing so well with them.
rangers,373l77,sinister_kid89,5,Sun May 24 19:39:14 2015 UTC,Yeah no way you move Fast with the chemistry he's developed w/Step and Kreids.
rangers,373l77,boxtowire,3,Sun May 24 21:03:41 2015 UTC,You dont demote one of our top producing guys to the 4th line in fast.
rangers,373l77,FLRangerFan,8,Sun May 24 21:04:59 2015 UTC,Excellent...
rangers,373l77,hman1025,14,Sun May 24 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"I love Zucc for many many reasons.  But the amount I bet he could start pestering and pissing off the triplets and Stamkos would be invaluable.  Even Hedman.  Hayes did it a little bit last game, but no one is as tricksy as a hobbit."
rangers,373l77,gigglyweeds,6,Sun May 24 16:40:05 2015 UTC,I'm failing to contain my excitement. ZUUUUUUUUUUC. In reality though who do we scratch/move to the 4th line? I like Dom as the 3rd line center and don't love Hayes being moved back to center against a team this good offensively. Fast has been unreal I think it would be a huge mistake to move him back to the 4th line. Maybe Marty?
rangers,373l77,Itscominrightforus,7,Sun May 24 15:47:48 2015 UTC,I still think Fast would get dropped down to the 4th line. But I think that line would get more ice time given how responsible fast is.
rangers,373l77,Moopband,2,Sun May 24 15:53:07 2015 UTC,Sheppard will go back to being scratched.  Edit: and Marty on the 4th with Moore doesn't seem awful
rangers,373l77,imnotthesmartestman,12,Sun May 24 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"Dear god Marty does not play the fourth line.  Our fourth line serves a purpose.  Marty does not suit that purpose.  This isn't the Torts era anymore.  And after the way Marty finished last game, you want to give him 4th line minutes?  Crazy talk."
rangers,373l77,gigglyweeds,2,Sun May 24 16:40:54 2015 UTC,Its not like Zucc is playing today... When he's ready they move whoever should be moved at that point.
rangers,373l77,imnotthesmartestman,5,Sun May 24 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"Regardless, Marty won't end up on the fourth line."
rangers,373l77,gigglyweeds,0,Sun May 24 17:33:56 2015 UTC,"As much as I like him, he's been pretty non-existent out there lately."

rangers,373l77,NYSportsGuy4,2,Sun May 24 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"This is obviously all contingent on if Zucc returns but maybe Nash-Brass-Zucc, Kreids-Step-Fast, Hags-Moore-MSL, Glass-Hayes-Miller (or maybe Glass-Miller-Hayes). Hard time seeing MSL getting bumped to the 4th line, especially if G4 is a sign of him potentially heating up. AV may want to put Zucc on the 4th line his first game back since he'll be a little rusty but I doubt he does that.  EDIT: On second thought, Moore will probably go back to the 4th line. Glass-Hayes-Miller isn't great defensively. Maybe Hayes gets bumped to the 3rd and Miller stays on the 4th."
rangers,373l77,thehockeychimp,-1,Sun May 24 20:26:08 2015 UTC,Krieder needs to be first line and Zuc pushed back to second. Of course I would always love Sheppard over Glass but since he is AV's favorite....
rangers,373l77,derpoftheirish,8,Sun May 24 16:30:59 2015 UTC,No way Kreider & Fast are playing so well together. That whole line has been about the only one producing before Friday night.

rangers,375rc5,callzor,2,Mon May 25 10:14:12 2015 UTC,"the three crowns are very much related to Sweden, it is the small seal of the kingdom, you can find them on Swedish passports for example"
rangers,375rc5,goingdiving,1 point,Mon May 25 22:36:32 2015 UTC,I thought it was three crowns for the three Scandinavian kingdoms?

rangers,375rc5,thehockeychimp,2,Mon May 25 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly clear where they come from, they have been used by Swedish kings since 1270 (probably earlier than that) and were made official seal in 1338. Most likely explanation is that it is a representation of the biblical three wise men, the city of Cologne has used the three crowns since the 1100's in just that representation.  Interesting sidenote is also that King Arthur used the three crowns as a symbol"

rangers,373iqy,Darclite,8,Sun May 24 16:03:46 2015 UTC,I don't even mind the notion that Snow deserved it over him. Isles have a ton of promising young talent. It's just the reaction that this is the most unheard of crazy thing ever. You'd think we finished we the same record as Edmonton. Also apparently everyone forgot that we have Kevin Hayes and all he did was give up a lot for Yandle.
rangers,373iqy,Darclite,1 point,Sun May 24 17:45:23 2015 UTC,Why is Snow more deserving than Sather exactly?
rangers,373iqy,sizeablescars,3,Sun May 24 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is, but there's an argument to be made. A lot of people didn't like the loss of Stralman and Boyle, or the Boyle signing, or thought we gave up too much for Yandle. Isles put together a worse team than ours, but a much better one than people expected. Snow's moves in the past year were pretty good (goaltending, Grabo, Boychuk, Leddy, decent draft). My point is basically that people's reaction that this came out of absolutely nowhere, when the President's trophy winner is almost automatically in the running. The reactions are as if Sather traded Lundqvist for Zac Rinaldo."
rangers,373iqy,kthoag,1 point,Sun May 24 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"Well Sather has spent years putting this team together, made some key moves like moving a bag of dog shit for Mac. Regarding Stralman, we have a ton of guys we need to re-sign in the next few years and Sather figured Dan Boyle is an adequate replacement for Stralman, which he was during the regular season. I just feel like it's silly to think the man who put together a squad that won the Presidents Trophy doesn't deserve to be nominated."
rangers,373iqy,BELEAFFF,2,Sun May 24 20:24:44 2015 UTC,Dan boyle has never even resembled an adequate replacement for stralman
rangers,373iqy,godlyjacob,1 point,Sun May 24 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase that. He's a semi-competent replacement? Let's be honest, he wasn't too bad in the regular season."

rangers,373iqy,BELEAFFF,-4,Tue May 26 05:51:25 2015 UTC,"yes but the only reason they got Hayes was because he was too scared to play for the Hawks. Then the Yandle trade was atrocious, that alone makes his nomination a joke. On top of that, he let Stralman go and replaced him with Boyle, who sucks. Bob Murray, Chuck Fletcher, and Yzerman should have been the nominees."
rangers,373iqy,PhilipK_Dick,3,Sun May 24 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"The Yandle trade obviously happened so that the rangers could win now and was doable because of Sather's unexpected pickup of Hayes.  Boyle hasnt been as bad as you think either. 9 points in 16 playoff games, tied with McDonagh and Yandle."
rangers,373iqy,Screwbit,2,Sun May 24 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from your obvious trolling, what was wrong with the Yandle trade?"
rangers,373iqy,wheelzr,0,Sun May 24 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"Prospect who will be a top 6 guy, probably a first liner, consistent 30+ goal scorer+Future top 4 defenseman+first round pick  for  An overrated and one-sided defenseman who will probably leave when his contract expires in two years because of the salary cap"
rangers,373iqy,Jk186861,2,Mon May 25 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"Or, you could say that he traded a third round pick - Duclair while his value was at its highest.  If you think John Moore has a greater chance of being a top 4 defenseman than the next coming of MDZ, we were watching different players.  and the 30th pick in the draft.  For- a legit top pairing Dman for less than $3mil against the cap this year and next year (they retain half of his salary).  Look, Duclair may become a good player but he hasn't proven anything and with the emergence of Hayes for the current team and Buchnevich and Tambellini (equal prospects to Duclair IMO) - you make that trade and try to win it all this year and next year.    After next year, we can go young again but this is how teams win it all - by trading youth for veterans who can help you win now.  Duclair wasn't going to help us win this year.  Yandle is.    We will see but Duclair probably isn't going to be a top 6 forward next year either.    Stralman is better than Boyle but I don't have to figure out how to sign Stepan and Kreider over the next 2 seasons.  Boyle's contract comes off the books when Kreider gets paid and they are hoping that Skejl is ready to contribute by then.  Could I be wrong?  Of course but teams like this don't come together often and you have to go for it when a championship window opens up.  I can't for the life of me see what you could have against Hayes but you are entitled to think whatever you want.  The guy is a stud and he was free (allowing us to trade Duclair).  You may be giving Duclair too much credit.  Keep in mind his coach in Quebec was Patrick Roy who had 3 chances to draft Duclair before he fell to the Rangers so maybe there is something we don't know about his character or ethic.    Remember Evgeny Grachev?  He put up 80 points in 40 games at the same level as Duclair.  A kid tearing it up in juniors does not translate into NHL success."

rangers,373iqy,commy,-3,Mon May 25 00:50:41 2015 UTC,"I mean it is gm of ""the year"" not gm of the decade. by my memory most of his recent moves have sucked,the msl trade, Dan Boyle signing,  yandle trade, glass signing,  and letting stralman go all look like mistakes now. the only good things I can think of are signing cambot and zucc to their current deals for cheap. we were a Stanley Cup team last year so it's not that big of an upswing for us to win the president's trophy. garth took a shit team and added a few guys that had a huge immediate impact."
rangers,373iqy,antisocially_awkward,3,Sun May 24 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yandle trade didn't necessarily suck, St Louis played well in the regular season and let's be honest, Callahan is no better.

I have found that there has been several occasions where I was unable to find a jersey that I wanted because it wasn’t being sold by most official stores and most of the time pickupjerseys.ru has what I am looking for. They also have great customer service."

For me it started last series, the first game we won I missed when I was at a festival and all 3 losses I watched, after that I stopped watching to see if it would work again and by some coincidence(or not?!) we came back and won. I thought the curse might have only been for last series but winning the afternoon game while I was at work and losing the next two that I watched I decided to try not watching again and now Nash scores 2 goals? What am I supposed to do if this keeps working? It's killing me."

It is still a little pricey but it is worth it.  The letters and numbers are stitched and good quality. Only draw back is it takes about a month to get it because they order from Reebok then do the custom action themselves.

rangers,372fdk,CaptainObvious_1,2,Sun May 24 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"If you want cheap and officially licensed jerseys, FullMoonJerseys on eBay has them.   They're typically of players that are no longer with a team, so you would have to be okay with that. Alternatively, I think the numbers/letters are hot-ironed on (not stitched), so you might be able to remove the hot glue they use to stick them on (look it up -- quite a few sources on this).   They occasionally have blanks, too. I'm not sure why they're so cheap but I read somewhere once that it might be because they have a slight factory default (eg. odd stitching or something like that). If it's something you're worried about, I'm sure you could send them an email.   But if you don't want to deal with all of that, Aliexpress is often used (as the other user mentioned), however, they are fake.  Good luck!"
rangers,372fdk,keetner,2,Sun May 24 08:14:14 2015 UTC,"I have bought fakes, from Aliexpress and the like. Don't do it. Like others say, get a blank one for a little more money and be a little happier. Even though the fakes look ""close"" they don't look 100% and you are going to regret it. Just trust me.  Wait a little longer, save a little more money, get a real one. That's what I'm going to do from now on anyway."

All the fans that donated did their part, contributed what they could, and are good, trusting people. That piece of shit will get what's coming to him down the road. The worst part is that you can tell he his proud of what he's done. Scammed a bunch of people into donating to a cancer charity. Yeah, money was still raised, but fuck him if he thinks he deserves some kind of credit. He made our sub look bad."

I live in Florida, about 45 minutes/an hour away from Tampa, so I'm down there every time the Rangers are in town during the regular season, and I got to catch one playoff game.   Up until Wednesday night, I had NEVER experienced anything like this in the arena and usually had pretty great interactions with other fans. We weren't threatened with being kicked out or anything, but the things people in our section were saying to us were far more rude than I've ever put up with, with the exception of one person. I'm borderline dreading going to games next season if this select little bunch of fans continues to be so shitty to a visiting fanbase. I'll drive my ass the 3.5 hours to Miami because it's pretty much MSG, Jr. there."
rangers,370p3n,owlsgohooot,13,Sat May 23 22:36:31 2015 UTC,It is a ridiculous policy but that is what they choose to enforce.   It's dumb and hopefully it comes back to bite them in the ass.
rangers,370p3n,AoifeCheeks,16,Sat May 23 21:58:51 2015 UTC,"I only saw one set of people getting tossed and it was because they were being loud and doing rangers chants (nothing remotely reasonable to throw people out for). It was very weird. I was a little embarrassed that other fans couldn't celebrate, but the rags fans around me were losing it.   The top voted comment in their sub. An account from a Tampa fan at the game that shows at least some people were kicked out despite not being disruptive/rude. Some Tampa fans with some serious homer goggles at /r/hockey are downvoting me because I'm saying that kicking people out for cheering for the other team without being disruptive is disgraceful."

But apparently, it's not because he's being a dick, no that can't possibly be the reason why he's getting downvoted and being called out.

I mean if he wants to insult us consistently that's fine but don't act like you're getting downvoted for your flair. You're not a fucking martyr, just a douchebag.   And I find it hilarious how he's spent so much time complaining about the media saying Bishop has gotten lucky with posts and such but he's also commenting saying the rangers only won because of luck because the bolts hit posts."
rangers,370p3n,jh1336,1 point,Sun May 24 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"Amen. I noticed he was going on a rant last night about how people were picking on Tampa about luck, while conveniently ignoring how he spent like half an hour during the /r/hockey GDT for last game attributing the fact that we were winning the game to ""luck"", and calling any Rangers fan disagreeing with him ""delusional"".

This is also a team that has attendance issues to begin with (like most professional teams in the Tampa area) and they are creating a difficult atmosphere for hockey fans. Don't alienate people who will be spending money in your arena. They might not be yelling for your team in their seats, but they are supporting your team with their money."
rangers,370p3n,johnmcalp,1 point,Sun May 24 15:07:17 2015 UTC,"As I agree that the policy itself isn't the best thing to have, to say the lightning have attendance issues is just plain wrong. http://espn.go.com/nhl/attendance  We averaged more in attendance than the rangers did, granted our arena is bigger. For anyone who is from Tampa or lives here can tell you, this area is a melting pot from everywhere else in America. We have a BIG population of people from the NY area that have decided to live here instead of up there for various reasons. We will never be the area of the country that is 100% any team because most people are here as transplants. Thats why we if you ever go to a rays/Lightning game during the redsox/yankees/tigers or Bruins/Rangers/Redwings games, you'll see a lot of opposing fans, but we do sellout almost every game. The other teams in the area do have attendance issues, but the lighting do not.  Remember, Tampa/St Pete has a combined population of 600,000 while NY has a population of 8.4 million."

rangers,370p3n,Jk186861,1 point,Sun May 24 14:00:22 2015 UTC,"Alright so I'm on the fence about this. I don't like the situation since many Rangers fans travel with the team and give them a huge boost, and for the Lightning to restrict them from cheering for their team is simply classless. On the other hand, the Lightning are a small market hockey team in a city full of transplants, primarily people from New York. If you're the home team, you don't want 50% of the arena to be full of the opposing team's fans. All I can is let's make sure the Rangers receives the proper support at home, in front 18,000+ die hard Rangers fans."

rangers,36ztbq,tomj,25,Sat May 23 15:16:49 2015 UTC,"I think Sather definitely needs to be in the discussion for best GM.   10 of the 20 starting lineup players have come directly through our system. It's all home grown talent - with some guys picked up late in drafts.   This lineup had the best record in the NHL. It's not some scrappy upstart - it has some serious, proven talent. All thanks to Glen."
rangers,36ztbq,_TheConsumer_,13,Sat May 23 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"The 10 players are: Miller, Girardi, Staal, Stepan, Talbot, Zuccarello, Lundqvist, Fast, Hagelin, Kreider.   Most notably, a majority all of the players who were drafted were during the very late rounds: Fast (6), Lundqvist (7) and Hagelin (6). Miller and Staal are both 1st round picks. The others were not drafted either by choice (ie: Zuccarello) or by default (ie: Girardi).   I almost counted McDonagh and Hayes but keep in mind that Mac was drafted by the Canadiens first and Hayes was initially drafted by the Blackhawks.   EDIT Zuccarello, not Stepan."
rangers,36ztbq,TwinkiesForAmerica,10,Sat May 23 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"It really is an impressive resume. Sather has done a great job.   Side note- I tend to think McD as ""our own"" because we developed him and Sather was able to get him for a bag of pucks. Canadiens GM was oblivious to his talent."
rangers,36ztbq,_TheConsumer_,6,Sat May 23 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"True but I was just not including him just to be technically correct.   People say that Lundqvist has a small window to win the Cup but when you look at this team, its core and its youth, it's really easy to see us having solid years 5-7 years down the road.   We have a lot of pieces in play."
rangers,36ztbq,TwinkiesForAmerica,3,Sat May 23 19:29:53 2015 UTC,What's the story with the Stepan draft? I always thought he was drafted normally
rangers,36ztbq,Frank_The_Unicorn,3,Sat May 23 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why do you say Stepan was not drafted by choice?"

rangers,36ztbq,mantiseye,25,Sat May 23 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"For the horrid decisions made from 2000-2005, and the waves of mediocrity from 2006-2011... Sather's 3rd act has been GM-of-the-year-worthy imo. Looking over the current roster & salary cap... the ""worst"" contract is Tanner Glass @ 1.45 mil/yr. If that's the worst contract you've got on the books, you're doing something right!"
rangers,36ztbq,EarnSquirm,3,Sat May 23 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly not disagreeing with your overarching point, but I wouldn't quite say 2006-2011 was ""mediocre."" I like to think that the team kind of knew that there was a plan in place, we were getting guys in the minors game experience and then up to the team, and long-tenured players like Hank, Girardi, Staal, Callahan etc. were growing. That team was ""learning how to win."" And this is where it's ok to bring in an occasional high priced vet. Guys like Jagr, Straka, Shanahan, etc. really could've pushed the younger guys to be better played. I don't know.  Honestly, people kinda forget that Smith left our cupboard bare when he exited. I think Sather wanted to have the homegrown talent the entire time, but until we got to the point where we had serious prospects, ""we'll just sign Lindros, Holik, Bure, Fleury, etc. to put a somewhat competitive/entertaining team on the ice."" Of course, that didn't work in the worst way and it usually never does. Had that 04-05 season been played, we might've been the worst team in the league. But it WASN'T played, and Lundqvist then came over from Sweden, and guys like Callahan were starting to come up to play for the Rangers, and we got competitive.  All in all, the team's track record over the last 10 years, but especially the last 4, has been quite good."
rangers,36ztbq,runninhillbilly,12,Sun May 24 05:36:04 2015 UTC,The Hayes acquisition was one of the most important moves of the offseason in the entire league. Everyone knew he could be good but 45 points right away made a huge difference.
rangers,36ztbq,Darclite,7,Sat May 23 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"Islanders fans can't be happy because no matter what happens they will always feel they are being slighted. Whether it's by the NHL or the city of New York itself. They always have an inferiority complex and that clouds everything for them.    They see a team that has been to the ECF three of the last 4 years, the finals last year, lost key players and STILL won the President's trophy this year, and they think ""Well, the GM isn't that good.""   If he's not that good, and he's had that much success, then why does their GM deserve the nomination?"
rangers,36ztbq,Techngro,4,Sun May 24 05:51:33 2015 UTC,I thought Johnson was undrafted?
rangers,36ztbq,BullOSullivan,2,Sat May 23 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"It depends though, because we don't exactly know what criteria they use to judge the ""best GM"". It seems like the success of the teams plays a huge part (which is why Snow isn't here and the 3 are all in the playoffs still).   Depending on how far we end up going, and if the criteria is something along the lines of ""Who has assembled the best team of players this year?"" I can see Slats being a real contender for the winner."

rangers,36y86m,artvandelay1994,3,Sat May 23 14:26:18 2015 UTC,Must've had something to do with Kevin Connoly's affection for the Isles. Dunno how that Rangers gear made it in there though.
rangers,36y86m,emildickson,2,Sat May 23 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"That was in the pilot episode where they unleash the guard dog on Turtle. The jersey is blank on the back. Besides that, I didn't see a single Rangers reference in the show (nor did I see a Jets reference either. Only NY team not mentioned at all).  On the contrary, Kevin Connolly's character (Eric) wears an Islanders hat/t-shirt in some episodes. When he gets his own office in the later seasons he even has a framed Tavares jersey."
rangers,36y86m,artvandelay1994,2,Sat May 23 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. I figured they just used hockey gear for the guard dog thing because they needed a lot of padding and they felt it was appropriate to use stuff from a New York team.  I've noticed the framed jersey also, and I read somewhere that Kevin Connolly tried to implement as much Islander-stuff as he could into the show.

rangers,36y6oi,averyrule,3,Sat May 23 03:09:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! Happy to gif all these games
rangers,36y6oi,djrob0,2,Sat May 23 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!   A bunch of penalties   LOL at the name. And hey, after looking at it, it's a bunch of penalties, and then some Hank highlights. I can do with that."
rangers,36y6oi,kamikazi34,3,Sat May 23 02:49:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah theres nothing to show when theres 5 penalties aside, its just your typical scrum only everyone gets tossed but I have to put something there to show for it... And it came with a bunch of Hank saves!"
rangers,36y6oi,assortedvariety,3,Sat May 23 02:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not complainin'! At least, unlike NBCSN, you actually show us the penalties."

rangers,36y6oi,andrewanthem,2,Sat May 23 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I'm still amazed at how Johnson got away with grabbing Klein's stick out of his hands and it led to a 4 on 1(2)."
rangers,36y6oi,Nezirsc,9,Sat May 23 02:54:21 2015 UTC,"So I was at that game tonight.  Lots of salty bolts fans, especially after the MSL goal.    Halfway through the third,  bolts fans were leaving, so a few Rangers fans went down and took their seats towards the end of the game,  in my section,  we're talking around 2 minutes left - Rangers fans were asked to return to their seat.  Some were  escorted out/asked to leave (for reasons that I don't know).  We sat in our ""assigned"" seats the whole time, towards the end,  my gf was asked to stop screaming (I'll admit she was loud with her cheering,  but FFS, it's a sporting event).   Rangers fans were out in force tonight,  we  hijacked the chants a few times,  even got a nice ""henrik!"" chant going.  Glad to see so many of us in enemy territory.   I'll be sitting in the nosebleeds for game 6, that should be fun. Just thought I'd share my playoff hockey moment/rant at Amalie arena.   Edit: I have to admit they have a great pregame show and some awesome music."
rangers,36y6oi,dontbthatguy,5,Sat May 23 05:04:02 2015 UTC,So proud of you guys in full force! I heard the HEN-RIK chant on TV! there was a lets go rangers chant to!

Good job stepping up by Yandle, Nash and MSL finally found the back of the net.  Also, Kreider is just a playoff warrior.  So awesome to watch a kid like him step up on the biggest stage.  Lastly, All Hail the King!"

rangers,36y6oi,plastictf,8,Sat May 23 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"I've been lurking. I find that I don't really have that much to say and it's been because of St. Louis.  Marty's been my favorite non-Rangers player for over a decade. He's one of my heroes in the same way a child looks up to star athletes as their heroes, too. I even met him once and had the opportunity to speak a little French with him, a language that I love and I've been trying to learn for awhile now. There's so much to admire about him and when I heard that he even might become a Ranger, I was ecstatic. I link this post all the time because I still believe.  Yet this postseason, he's disappeared in a huge way. One of my heroes for over a decade in possibly the most important postseason of my life just drops off a cliff. He's looked slow, he's looked weak... he's been a huge detriment to the team at times, like on that 5-on-3 SH goal. It's been devastating. I know I shouldn't attach such strong feelings to some athlete but man, he really is just such an admirable person. It's humbled me and I've been hesitant to post... until he scored tonight."
rangers,36y6oi,C_L_I_C_K,6,Sat May 23 04:10:47 2015 UTC,"Nah I get it. I've been trying to kind of walk the line with my judgment of him because he really has been bad, but at the same time he's the kind of guy who can suddenly go back to putting up 10 points in 7 games. Also yeah, he's the fucking man, there can't be many bigger achievements than winning the Art Ross and Lady Byng in the same season at 37. And as a smaller dude I love watching him (and Zucc) just make shit happen out of nowhere by outworking and outskating guys.  It's really cool that you got to talk to him, definitely one of the best players to get to meet."

rangers,36y6oi,Ralph_Baconader,7,Sat May 23 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"we were so fuckin due. Did we actually just win 5-1 in the playoffs with nash yandle and marty scoring?! this is amazing. Also, [[NASHFACE]] [[YANDLEFACE]] [[MARTYFACE]]"

rangers,36y6oi,zombiexsp,6,Sat May 23 02:46:23 2015 UTC,This was fun. Let's do it again on sunday. And then again on tuesday.
rangers,36y6oi,Milol,5,Sat May 23 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Looks like Hank snapped out of his 2 game stuper and regained his form and focus. Nash (2) and MSL scoring will hopefully give them confidence because we desperately need them to not suck for the rest of the playoffs. Nash looking like Nash again was great to watch.  Rangers still need to clean up their horrendous defense. They left guys wide open in front of Hank at least 3 times tonight. 3 of ours (both D players) chased 1 guy behind the net, which left the trailer wide open in front. We're lucky none of those shots went in and Hank played lights out tonight. LGR!!!"
rangers,36y6oi,ball_out,5,Sat May 23 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"This was the best game I've seen from Boyle all post season. He will likely be overshadowed by the Big Dick and Marty scoring but deserves some recognition. Yandle and Klein contributed a lot tonight offensively. I liked the chirpiness of Hayes - something we hadn't seen at all before now. And of course, Hank was a god.  That being said, I thought Mac and G were subpar - for what is expected of them. That's my only big complaint.  Lastly, hey /u/JP_Whoregan where you at?"
rangers,36y6oi,Nezirsc,6,Sat May 23 02:48:08 2015 UTC,We played a more physical game. That's what we needed to do. Grind it out. It is the way of the Ranger.

The outcome doesn't change the factors that you use to decide it.   Think of it this way, if you get home safely after driving drunk, does that validate your decision to drive drunk?  Edit: I also said he could turn it around, but given the situation I wouldn't want to take the chance. Playing the odds (at the time). I'll stand by that argument win or lose.

rangers,36y6oi,lespaul210,3,Sat May 23 03:26:38 2015 UTC,"YEAAAAAAAAAAH!!!   I'M SO HAPPY FOR ALL OF OUR GUYS! It was absolutely fantastic to see Nash and Marty score tonight! I thought Nash did a great job at trying to establish more presence in front of the net (driving to it for his first goal, screened Bishop for the second), and he had a few other chances, too. And for Marty, it really seemed like his goal lifted his spirits. He had at least 2-3 good chances after that, playing with a bit more edge + speed to his game. But really, I think the two of them really needed those goals and so seeing them convert tonight -- can't help but be excited for them. It was great to see Fast and Yandle score, too (though at first I really thought Yandle's shot had deflected off of Glass...I went absolutely nuts, heh). Also, Boyle's read + effort in keeping the puck during our PP leading to Marty's goal was pretty amazing to see.   I thought we did a much better job at stopping the Bolts in the neutral zone and had better positioning to prevent/break-up any rushes. That said, I actually thought we prevented a lot of SOG but apparently they had 40 tonight. But while it might not sound all that great, I am wondering if they were maybe poorer chances and/or from the outside because asides from the second period, I thought we had the better game. Nice to see our PP convert again, too.   In addition to our offense/defense, Hank had so many key saves for us. There were times I felt like he still looked a bit shaky, but I'm wondering if it was just from having to tweak his game a bit. Though I thought he looked a lot more comfortable as the game went on, plus, I think it probably helped ease his mind a little knowing he didn't have to keep the guys in a tight game once our offense got going. Regardless, glad to see he looked a little more like himself today.   Overall, while there were still some very anxious moments (first half of the second period...!), it was a great comeback win and pretty complete game played by all of our guys. Hopefully this will give them momentum + confidence into the next games!"
rangers,36y6oi,rangersmetsgiants27,2,Sat May 23 03:30:34 2015 UTC,Honestly the high SOG total is mostly the second period. Not many in the first and the third was just a product of them taking a million risks to try and stay in the game. I think we had the better game other than the second too.
rangers,36y6oi,DrOrangePie,3,Sat May 23 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"Amazing win! Best of three now.  Also, fuck /u/RangersDonations (formerly /u/RangersDonation) with a big rubber dick, take it out and beat him with the rest of it."

One of the /r/tampabaylightning mod was unbearable today in the /r/hockey GDT calling Marty a c*nt constantly, talking shit about Rangers fans, New Yorkers in general, etc.   It was quite interesting to see the difference. We generally react to heavy losses by criticizing the team's effort and calling out players name, they attribute everything to luck and go full out flame the opponents mode."

I can't believe people actually believe leagues would so openly support another team. Would they like to have big market teams competing and in the limelight? Of course they do.

I get comments occasionally but it's really not a big deal. I've cheered for the opposing team at the Bell Centre and I have met some really nasty people on occasion but for the most part it's just friendly chirping.   Depending what university you're going to, there will be a fair amount of non-Habs fans, anyway. I'm at McGill and there's a huge out-of-province/international community here so there are lots of people who cheer for other teams.  Early welcome to the city, btw! :) I've lived here my entire life and it really is a great place (though the Habs are one of my least favourite teams)."

rangers,36wdv4,khalaron,6,Fri May 22 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"This proves Nash shoots from outside the dots, when he needs to be driving to the net."
rangers,36wdv4,jedimasterchief,5,Fri May 22 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"It's sad how glaringly obvious it is :/  He's a power forward, and desperately needs to start playing like one."
rangers,36wdv4,Homeruns,4,Fri May 22 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"While this is true, the article said he's received only one pass while in the attacking zone during the playoffs. He tends to be the one who enters the zone with the puck while the rest of his line changes. Which also can contribute to the low scoring chance shots"
rangers,36wdv4,xxdarksyde73xx,3,Fri May 22 19:22:45 2015 UTC,How is that even possible? He only got one pass in the offensive zone through 15 games? There's no way.
rangers,36wdv4,One_2nd,6,Fri May 22 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"...ZUUUUUUUUUCC?  Yeah, I feel like Nash had some better looks in the Caps series, so to think he's only gotten one pass -- seems pretty nuts. That said, and maybe I'm stating the obvious, but when we consider how much of a great playmaker Zucc is, it wouldn't necessarily surprise me if the number of chances have gone down."
rangers,36wdv4,keetner,4,Fri May 22 20:00:32 2015 UTC,Have you watched Brass recently? He's shooting when he should be passing to Nash. CBC did a whole piece on it in Game 2.
rangers,36wdv4,ANGR1ST,1 point,Fri May 22 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"I don't remember when, but there was one sequence where it was so obvious that Brass should've passed to Nash. But he didn't. Almost like he knew Nash wouldn't score even if he did pass it to him.   This article makes it seem like the passing needs to come before Nash will heat up. Hope someone important reads it and takes note."
rangers,36wdv4,annihilus813,1 point,Fri May 22 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"Almost like he knew Nash wouldn't score even if he did pass it to him.    But it's not his job to make that decision. It's his job to get Nash as many chances at the net as possible and get him going. He's a fluffer, not a finisher."
rangers,36wdv4,ANGR1ST,1 point,Fri May 22 22:10:36 2015 UTC,Correct. And it's the coach's job to reinforce those roles.
rangers,36wdv4,annihilus813,4,Sat May 23 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"He just isn't driving to the net anymore. I truly don't understand it, he had an amazing break away last game and what did he do? Wrister from 30 feet out. If it was the regular season he would have manhandled any defender on him and made the goalie look like a fool. At first I thought it was injury and then I saw the way he was laying out hits in the Caps series. It's his confidence. He has zero confidence in the playoffs, but I don't know why."
rangers,36wdv4,ball_out,2,Fri May 22 19:30:23 2015 UTC,I really don't think it's the playoffs that's in his head. He has been like this ever since he missed two games from the neck spasms. He cooked down and can't hear back up again I honestly don't get it but this definitely didn't start in the playoffs.

rangers,36xovr,xxdarksyde73xx,2,Sat May 23 04:26:27 2015 UTC,"I frankly have to disagree, Torts turned the wheels on making this team we have now from the dumpster fire the rangers were before, I will always respect him for that. AV fine tuned this team and I love him too. AV coach Torts assistant coach plz"
rangers,36xovr,fosiacat,1 point,Sat May 23 13:22:29 2015 UTC,"completely respect your opinion but I disagree. Torts didn't inspire confidence in any non big name players. Look at Kreider for example, he hated playing Kreider. Kreider meanwhile is one of our best players. He also kept sending JT miller down to the AHL when he would have one bad game which was also not only a mistake, but makes players feel insecure and more at risk about if they don't play their best all the time."
rangers,36xovr,AoifeCheeks,1 point,Sat May 23 16:50:32 2015 UTC,a large part of our success in the last two years can be attributed to torts. he instilled discipline and smart hockey to everyone on the team. and those that are still here still play with that edge.

rangers,36xovr,otter_pop_n_lock,3,Sat May 23 00:08:02 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure he worked for ESPN for a little before he came to New York. I think it was when melrose coached Tb

Bishop is definitely banged up, keep shots low. CLEAR THE SLOT to avoid cross ice passes (like 84 of Tampa's goal this series), keep Boyle locked in the stick room, and unleash the Hundwick. Also, my sources tell me tonight is the night Nash goes full speed. Not scoring, but full speed into the post after losing the puck on another turnover. 4-2 Rangers.

rangers,36wg1f,wheelzr,3,Fri May 22 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"Bingo. He's an effective player when he isn't scoring, but that effectiveness does not hold the value of his contract."

rangers,36wv3k,Grassandapples,4,Fri May 22 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"Lil B is a rapper who recently put a curse on James Harden for stealing an element of his signature ""cooking"" dance. The curse originated when Kevin Durant dissed Lil B on Twitter. Lil B put the curse on Kevin and claimed the only way to lift it would be if they played 1 on 1. Lil B even put out a diss track on his basketball themed album ""Hoop Life"". (http://youtu.be/vtE3_voC3qU) ""The Based Gods Curse"" gained legitimacy on social media after the Houston Rockets got eliminated. If a player gets cursed, they'll never win a title until it's lifted by Lil B. Hopefully that sheds some light on it all.  TL;DR: rapper cursed basketball players, they'll never win a title until the curse is lifted   I just don't see why St. Louis or Nash would be cursed though."

He was given a letter in 08-09 on a roster of over the hill stars Naslund/Gomez/Redden/Drury (Which Drury captained until he was bought out before the 11-12 season)  He plays a style of hockey the team no longer plays.

rangers,36ytrj,hockeysauce,2,Sat May 23 14:19:14 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but pretty much disagree... I don't think we should shit on Nash, I just don't think we need him...   Nash doesn't suck.... he's just hasn't been doing what he gets paid to do.  This team was built, like any other team, to win the Stanley Cup. Part of that build was $7.8 million, a significant chunk of the cap, to Rick Nash... to score goals. Not in December, not February. In April, May, and hopefully June. He didn't do it last year, has hasn't done it this year.  I don't hate him. I don't boo him. In fact I much appreciate what he did last playoffs, when he basically said ""okay, I'm not scoring, might as well contribute somehow"" and he developed a very good defensive game, which he carried over to this season and playoffs.   But again, he doesn't get paid $7.8 million to backcheck and kill penalties. When we're 1-1 late in Game 1 vs Washington, Rick Nash gets paid to score that goal we need. When we're in OT vs. Tampa Bay, Rick Nash gets paid to score the goal we need. And he's had his chances to do so... and didn't. Of course he won't always do it, but he's gone way too far to the other end of that spectrum..  Yes, he has contributed in different ways. But IMO he hasn't contributed $7.8 mil worth. That $7.8 million could, IMO, be spent better, elsewhere. We don't need a 40+ reg season scorer, we need a guy who will put a puck in when we need him too. Stephane Matteau was never a 40 goal scorer but scored perhaps the biggest goal in this teams history. Sergei Zubov, a defenseman,  led the team in regular season points that season. You don't need big numbers from October to early April, you need consistency and players who make it happen in the spring. Dan Carcillo scored at least two big goals last posteason (not comparing him to Nash at all, just an example of how an afterthought player can contribute when it matters). Carcillo scored goals when we needed them, goals that changed the complexion of the game. Save for tonight, Nash hasn't really done that, this year or last, and that is exactly what he gets paid to do.  To me, he's a bit soft for the postseason. I don't know what it is, but he doesn't seem to have the fire you need to play your best this time of year. He's got 9 goals in 57 career playoff games. That, IMO, is not worth $7.8 million a year. I want the Stanley Cup, not the Presidents Trophy.   Even if we pull it off and win it this year, I'd rather see Darth Sather find a way to offload Nash this offseason. He's not a big game, big-time player. For $7.8 million we can sign two players, one to score 10-15 goals and kill penalties (a la Dominic Moore) and one to score 25 goals and than another 10 in the playoffs. That's what we need, and Rick Nash is not providing it.   Just me 2/5 of a nickel..."

rangers,36s399,CalmingCollection,1 point,Fri May 22 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"You're not sitting Sheppard or Miller, and AV won't sit MSL. I think, the two realistic options here would be either Hayes, who has somehow been getting manhandled AND was demoted to the 4th line last night (don't think he's playing poorly, though), or Glass (who also hasn't been playing bad, but he's an offensive liability), because we don't necessarily need his physical play right now. We need possession and bottom six scoring if we want to give Tampa a run for their money and make their matchups more difficult."
rangers,36s399,PaulSach,1 point,Fri May 22 02:24:34 2015 UTC,I'd sit Miller before I sit Hayes honestly. Hayes has been pretty good so far I know he was demoted in game 3 which didn't make much sense to me.
rangers,36s399,darkknight915,1 point,Fri May 22 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"JT took Hayes' spot because he was playing better, plain and simple. Hayes was getting ragdolled out there, and looked a little out of it after Stamkos crushed him.  Miller also brings a more physical element than Hayes and has shown flashes of brilliance on his stick with some of his passes and dangles he's made these playoffs. He's also a total effort player, drives hard to the net, has great speed, and isn't afraid to stick up for his teammates. I think he should be a great compliment to Nash because he can be the guy that crashes the net on that line (even though this is what BDR should be doing).   The only thing JT has done wrong this entire playoffs is how snakebitten he is around the net - the pucks are either hopping on to his stick, or just slightly rolling off. Somethings gotta give soon, though, right?"

I feel like he has several bright spots during most games but usually averages out with some boneheaded decisions. I see him coming out of the lineup in favor of Zucc, to be honest. We all know Glass is a staple at this point, but to his credit he's played really well."
rangers,36s399,FlossThatSaucyBanjo,9,Fri May 22 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"I think Shepards board work is pretty good and his puck possession is solid as well, he's playing on a line that has absolutely no offensive punch so it's hard to see the benefits of what he has done."

Cally trade seemed unnecessary but he basically handcuffed us with his contract demands and that's why there's a lot of resentment toward him, as well as frustration towards fans who say stuff like ""but he's got grit and heart"" which is certainly true, but he doesn't deserve to be the second highest paid skater on the team and had to go. No choice in the matter."
rangers,36s399,Darclite,1 point,Fri May 22 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is going to be the same scenario with O'Reilly and the Avs. No one will deny that he's a great player who has ""grit and heart"", but I don't think he's worth a penny more than what he's making right now (which is pretty high). We're looking at re-signing him during this off-season so it doesn't complicate things later on next season when his contract would be expiring soon, but I'm afraid he's going to try to ask for more than what he's getting now - which is an absolute NO in my judgment, because MacKinnon will be out of his rookie contract at the same time, and deserves a handsome salary as well."

These people are citing stats and adding discussion and getting bombarded with downvotes. Others are supporting the general consensus with false stats and getting upvotes. It's really not cool guys. This is precisely why there are seemingly no positive comments about the rangers in r/hockey."

rangers,36sp01,gigglyweeds,-10,Fri May 22 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry AV, I don't agree with you on this one. I said it the other night, but Hank hasn't and can't beat Tampa. Look at the regular season and look at this series. There's a lot of poor elements, but he's let in 4+ goals in over HALF the games against tampa in the regular season. Has that happened against any other team? I doubt it. I think pulling Hank is a no brainer on this one.   EDIT: Poor elements referring to nashless Nash and whatnot  EDIT2: I don't care about the downvotes, but would much rather have downvotes +  other thoughts an opinions rather than blind downvoting. Simply stating what I thought here fellas..."
rangers,36sp01,fiddle_me_timbers,2,Fri May 22 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"He's let in 6 in half the games.   The stats are atrocious. He can figure it out because game one was pretty good, but damn he's going to have to figure it out soon."

But it's not a ridiculous suggestion. Tampa has his number. And 2 goals a period for in half the game this year isn't going to get it done.   Not counting game 1, 5 games, 27 goals allowed."

rangers,36swz0,dersnarp,3,Fri May 22 03:49:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think any reasonable person has a problem with an opposing fan attending their event. The problem (at least in my opinion) comes when someone is disruptive and it stops being good natured. Taunt and heckle all you'd like, but at least respect that you're at someone else venue and don't be a pain in the ass or ruin someone else's experience"
rangers,36swz0,angelsil,3,Fri May 22 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"For sure. As I noted below, we're very used to opposing fans here in Tampa.

rangers,36swz0,ForeignAlphabet,6,Fri May 22 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Was this guy being a jerk? Sure, but the viewing was open to the public and if you can't take some trash talk you shouldn't be a sports fan, especially in NYC.

rangers,36swz0,sergeyuf,4,Fri May 22 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"if you can't take some trash talk you shouldn't be a sports fan   THIS. Being overly sensitive does not give one permission to assault others. ""Taunting"" includes a very broad spectrum of behavior. And only a tiny subset of it constitutes invitations to brawl. I wasn't there so can't speak to what actually happened in this specific case."
rangers,36swz0,sergeyuf,-6,Fri May 22 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"This is where you're wrong. You can have a ""specific"" party and exclude whomever you want if you hold it at your home, a bar that you own/rent out, etc. This is not MY opinion - it's the law.

Obviously there was nothing legally preventing Lightning fans from attending, but please don't try and make it sound like this wasn't an event explicitly designed for Rangers fans.   I personally think that guy was there to cause trouble. I didn't see him with any friends. I can't imagine going to a official viewing party for a team playing the Rangers. I don't see how it would be fun to watch a game in a huge crowd of people that want the opposite outcome you do.   None of this excuses the fan being punched(assuming that he was). I never saw anything like that and we have one person here saying he was and one saying he wasn't. There was no way he was going to be hurt by the people throwing or hitting him with the foam batons. They were using way too little force. It still looked like mostly good natured taunting."

If led out because of his own safety, I can understand that.  But why not taunt when your team is up.  He wasn't doing anything that deserved having garbage thrown at him.   We were all there just to have fun...  Also, screw the guy that came from near the screen to go back and find the Lightning fan because ""I'm gonna go beat him up!"" He should have been thrown out for being an idiot."
rangers,36swz0,khalaron,11,Sat May 23 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"If you're a Lightning's fan in a crowd of thousands of Rangers fans, celebrating goals scored and good plays is fine. But taunting and acting like a douchenozzle? What did he expect to happen? Nothing good could have come from that situation. For his own safety, it was best he was escorted. Especially with the way the game ended. He would have done something ridiculously stupid while people were leaving and he would have, most likely, gotten his asked kicked.  There's a time and place for taunting. Being the only fan of your team surrounded by thousands of others...that's not it."

rangers,36swz0,Darclite,1 point,Thu May 21 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"I would never act like an idiot at Fenway Park while wearing a Yankees jersey.   I think the difference is that here in Tampa, we always have a ton of visiting fans and 99.9% of the time they are gracious and civil. We're not really used to dealing with the kind of animosity like Yankees/Red Sox or Flyers/Penguins. I mean, hating the Lightning isn't really a thing...  This playoffs has brought out some real winners. The prime example being the Red Wings idiot who lit up our Lightning flag while it was over the heads of fans during the pre-game ceremony. She was arrested for arson, by the way.   As a fanbase we're still learning this whole rivalry thing. Not excusing this guy, though it just sounds like he was drunk and that was probably not the wisest decision given the time and place."

rangers,36swgc,LIGuy631,6,Thu May 21 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"Friendly Lightning fan here who always cheers for NYR unless they're playing Tampa.   Changing goalies is ridiculous. Sure, Hank's been having trouble stopping the triplets, but the Bolts are the highest scoring team in the league. Everyone has trouble stopping Tampa from scoring. If they didn't, we wouldn't have made it this far. Why haven't I heard anyone saying Bishop should be swapped out? He had the lower save percentage of the two at .850. He almost lost the game for us. Anyway, that's all I have to say. If NYR wins this series, I'll be here cheering with you guys for the cup.   EDIT: Obviously blaming poor defense entirely on Bishop is a bit much, but you know what I mean."
rangers,36swgc,Banthrau,2,Thu May 21 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"Because Bishop won both games. For some reason in the New York media world, when the Rangers lose a game, they immediately call for Lundqvist's head. Then he'll win the next game and talks for the Conn Smythe pick up right where they left off."
rangers,36swgc,HockeyVG,7,Fri May 22 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"Lundqvist isn't elite. He's the gold standard and the best goalie in hockey.   Of the 12 goals TB scored, I count 4 that were garbage. The others were pure skill combined with a total defensive meltdown.   There is no way Hank is pulled in favor of Talbot.   The Rangers need to slow the game down, like they did in Game 1. They will lose this series if they continue the run and gun play that TB thrives upon."
rangers,36swgc,_TheConsumer_,2,Fri May 22 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"You gotta understand talk radio is designed for people to react to.

rangers,36swgc,Ralph_Baconader,1 point,Thu May 21 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to them.  Hank is a terrific goalie. The rest of the team has to step up and play good defense and not take shit penalties.  Even goalies have bad days. He had 2, and knowing him, that's it. Nobody works harder than him. He's going to win Game 4 for the Rangers. He will be the difference this time."
rangers,36swgc,khalaron,1 point,Fri May 22 13:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's an easy argument for them to make.  Cause it's never going to happen.  So they'll never be proven wrong.

rangers,36swgc,tomlambsays,1 point,Fri May 22 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"Man we're really circlejerking this today.  I've said it in two other threads.  Hank has a bad history with Tampa this year.  It is not insane to say start Talbot when he performed above and beyond expectations this year in a high pressure situation.  Hopefully Hank is Hank tonight, but we shall see.    One thing I would note is the amount of easy rebounds Hank is giving up this series.  He is popping pucks into the slot constantly.  I.e. the Stamkos goal.  I honestly think Tampa is in his head.  But far be it from me to say we should start our amazing backup when Tampa has scored 5+ goals on Hanks 5 times this season."
rangers,36swgc,gigglyweeds,1 point,Fri May 22 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"People will overreact to things like that.  I was just as bummed as anyone else last night (especially after the OT goal) but not in a million years would anyone with a brain start Talbot over Hank in the Playoffs and I loved AV's reaction when he was asked about it.  But from what I can see the defensive lapses and bad turnovers are the biggest reason our boys lost the last two, just got caught flat footed far too often and Tampa made them pay.  But I know better than to give up on this team, it's still our year!  LGR!!!!!"

But because it is mental and not physical, I have a lot of hope for us. I just takes one little thing to set us on the right track for the rest of the series.   People think St. Louis is too old, and while he's certainly not in his prime, his shortcomings in the playoffs are due to his lack of confidence. Even a blind 3 legged dog can hit the net from 2 feet away. So clearly it's not physical for him. He needs a confidence booster.  Nash is the same thing. His mentality/attitude is just not the same as the regular season. he isn't putting his big body to use and he's playing like he's Marty's size.  Lundqvist doesn't tire. He just feels unsupported the last few games. At one point last night, he came out of his crease for a shot that ended up being a back door pass and he just gave up on the play. Luckily we broke the play up before they could score but still.  Minus a few of the young guys, we just look lost mentally. I don't know the solution to these mental issues for our team (if I did, I'd be a coach), but that's simply it. The goals we've given up are lack of focus and attitude. But I have total faith that if we get the right mentality back for the next game, we can go all the way no problem."
rangers,36rf78,atrain444,2,Thu May 21 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"they are adjusting to us.   To be fair they let in two goals in the first two games and 5 in the third.  We really exploited Bishop and their shaky defensive pairings well game three, and had rock solid power plays, that just can't come at the cost of every other aspect of the game."
rangers,36rf78,darkeagle91,1 point,Thu May 21 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"The 2 power plays we scored on looked great. The others in game three were pretty horrible. I agreed our offensive zone puck possession looked great when we could get it going and we created more high percentage scoring chances on Bishop, but the Bolts have done a very good job at exploiting our weakness to forget about players off the puck. Normally we leave weak-side and off-the-puck players open and Hank will bail us out or we will make a scrambling play, but they have really attacked that part of our game, especially directly in the slot. We are puck watchers and it's killing our defense."
rangers,36rf78,atrain444,6,Thu May 21 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I see is passive play coming from the Rangers (e.g. waiting for the puck to float to them) versus the Lightning's active play (e.g. actually expending energy to skate quickly to where the puck is). This couldn't have been more evident than when Girardi gave up a fucking icing call by gliding down the ice toward the puck while a Lightning player hauled ass to negate the icing.  We need to get to the puck assuming EVERY TIME that there's a Lightning player hot on our heels - which, in a lot of cases, is true.  This team is much too good to be giving up a 2-0 lead only to seem them trailing 2-4. Undisciplined, lazy play is what caused that. AV needs to bench someone to make an example, holy shit. I'm pissed."
rangers,36rf78,Nezirsc,2,Thu May 21 17:18:47 2015 UTC,I think this is a great point. I thought maybe the Lightning were faster but it really did seem like the Rangers were slow to get to puck at time.
rangers,36rf78,tonyprent22,1 point,Thu May 21 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"They are putting so much pressure on the Rangers that any mishandling of the puck creates a turnover and an odd man rush.  Seems like Tampa has an all out pressure mentality.  They skate after us if we hold behind the net to set up.  They pressure us on the power play to the point of nearly creating shorthanded opportunities on almost every power play.  They are relentless and it just seems like there are no adjustments to the style of play.  That being said, I fully expect AV to come out and have a whole different approach to game 4.  I think the Rangers expected Hank to shut it down in net after giving up 6 in game 2 and the game plan was to let him bail us out of trouble.  Problem is that game plan created too many odd man rushes.  If we see the same style of play in game 4 then sadly I think this wont be a 3-1 we come back from"
rangers,36rf78,sofakingmad,2,Thu May 21 18:08:55 2015 UTC,and that would be to bench MSL and demote Nash.  i'm not kidding.
rangers,36rf78,Nezirsc,2,Thu May 21 17:57:32 2015 UTC,I was thinking benching MSL or Girardi.
rangers,36rf78,tonyprent22,3,Thu May 21 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"I was astounded at how there was no adjustments to the rush game that the Lightening was playing.  I understand we can't just play back and let the play come to us but if that is the case then we need to figure out how to match speed.  It just seemed at one point that every counter rush was a two on one, and in the third guys just kept getting caught up in the neutral zone and not turning quick enough, creating breakaways.  I missed game one, so I didn't get to review the way we played, and I'm not a coach, and I hate listening to couch coaches telling everyone else what needs to change.  But what were we doing that game to minimize Tampa's chances?    I don't know who's calling for the switch to Talbot but the series is 2-1 and people need to relax.  Henrik is the best in the league year in and year out.  You don't pull the best goaltender in the league because you're down 2-1 in a series.  The Dan Boyle fuck up that led to the breakaway goal in the second, at first I was in hysterics the way Nash played that, but after watching it again, I think he made the best play he possibly could against their speed.  I'd of liked to have seen him sprawl out and extend the stick to take away a pass, but I think he made a decent attempt at trying to defend.  The bad penalties need to stop.  It's happening out of frustration and Tampa is just too talented when they can pass the puck around.  We look lost on the kill.    I'm not too worried overall.  AV is a great coach, and I think that this was a HUGE wake up call to everyone that changes need to happen."
rangers,36rf78,cordlc,2,Thu May 21 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"The Dan Boyle mess that led to a breakaway was played well, then Henrik poked it right to Stamkos. He could have covered it or sent it anywhere else but where he did.  And yeah, we can't be taking penalties. Tampa is scary as fuck when they have space."
rangers,36rf78,tonyprent22,1 point,Thu May 21 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"For sure.  Unfortunately Henrik made the best play he could when put in the shitty situation of trying to stop a 2 on 0.  That was just puck luck that it went to Stamkos.  Watching the game, you can see their game is now to hop on rebounds.  They crash the net and shoot from the blue line and seem to always have two guys low to clean up, and it's working.  And yeah, there is too much talent, and they are so smooth on entering the zone, that we just get lost.  I thought the first or second penalty kill looked amazing.  We had guys reacting quick to the passes, and I noticed instead of doubling up on the puck the Rangers looked to be more man on man, putting pressure on the carrier and forcing them to pass to the blue line.  Then suddenly the next penalty kill we looked completely out of sync."
rangers,36rf78,josephnicklo,3,Thu May 21 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"Fast, Miller, Stepan, Hagelin, Staal, Klein, and yes Tanner Glass even looked solid I will say that.   Fast has been so freaking impressive this playoffs. AV hit the lotto with that line. Can't wait to see how it does next season, if he keeps it together."
rangers,36rf78,khalaron,2,Thu May 21 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"Let's stick with Hank, and if he gives up more than 3 goals in less than 2 periods, put in Talbot.  Better defense will take pressure off Lundqvist. It MUST start on Friday, or the Rangers are golfing on Monday.  I also noticed that on the forecheck and the backcheck, a lot of guys were losing track of the puck. I don't know if anyone else noticed that, maybe it's just me.  Game 4 is a must win. They can't fall behind Tampa 3-1 and expect to pull off a miracle comeback. It won't happen against the Bolts.   And for Christ's sake, STOP WITH THE STUPID PENALTIES!"
rangers,36rf78,MikeyRage,2,Thu May 21 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"dan boyle has been our best dman this series, and has been solid since we got him. Stop being terrible at watching hockey.  Hank tilts worse then a bronzie in league of legends"
rangers,36rf78,ANGR1ST,2,Thu May 21 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"There will be some talk on Henrik and let me just make this clear…we don’t bench him. That is absurd stupid bandwagon fan panic bullshit that I am sure we’ll see in thread. Henrik can only do so much, but at the same time he has to be better. The OT was really soft. Scream all you want if you don’t believe it was, but it was. He has to set the tone for this defense and simply be the amazing goalie he is at times. I am not scared he cannot do that, and I am certainly not blaming him for a lot of the goals last night, but like the other big boys some blame does fall on him.   I hate the blind admiration that Hank can do no wrong in a large part of this fanbase. I think we should bench him. Hell, he should have been pulled last night. (Edit: He also could have been pulled after goal 4 in game 2.) He played like shit. I'm not talking about the goals where he got hung out to dry by the bad D. The other plays, not even goals, but the rest of his game looked bad. Then the softie at the end.  This guy goes on tilt. He lets in soft goals, quits on plays he shouldn't, and loses his rebound control when the game is going badly. Then he stands on his head and makes a couple of insane saves that everyone remembers.  He's gotten shelled every game we've played TB this season, except GM1.  Talbot is a great goalie. He's not going to lose us a game. The D might. But maybe putting him in will be a wake-up call to the D to get their act together.  ( A lot of fans love Hank, but all of the guys that I grew up with that played hockey as kids, and still play hockey, are much more critical of his play too. I don't think that's bandwagon panic, it's 10 years of seeing him make the same mental mistakes in big games like last night. )"
rangers,36rf78,neonbible47,2,Thu May 21 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"Someone else in another thread made a good point here: if Hank gets benched and Talbot gets lit up (and rust + the offensive prowess of the TBL makes that a good possibility), then what? You put Hank back in? Benching after two shitting games probably takes a hell of a psychological toll on a player. Henrik has been around. He wants a cup. He's probably harder on himself than anyone else could be. I have faith that he'll get his shit together... and I don't think AV has any other option but to have that same faith in him."
rangers,36rf78,ANGR1ST,2,Thu May 21 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"He's already been shelled 2 games in a row, and shelled every game we've played TB except GM1.  If Talbot get's lit up, so be it. Hank's mental state is obviously already fucked. He's not playing well. Don't focus on the goals where the D imploded, look at his positioning, rebound control, and soft goals."
rangers,36rf78,ncolaros,1 point,Thu May 21 17:31:57 2015 UTC,It's not blind admiration it's just had to say well he gave up 6 goals. Being short-handed constantly and giving up odd man rushes like they are candy on halloween make it tough for a fan like me to say this is Hanks fault. The OT absolutely soft as baby shit no denying that. I think maybe 1 other goal I would blame on Hank. Not to mention with these 2 teams playing I don't know if there is a goalie that would shut down the other team.  That being said if this team shows some heart on defense and we lose 3-2 in game 4 on soft goals I will gladly jump on the Talbot bandwagon.
rangers,36rf78,neonbible47,2,Thu May 21 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Staal's been our worst defenseman for a while now, actually, but no one seems to notice. People keep saying we need to move him up, but he's been so bad with the puck. He's got the worst possession numbers on the team in the playoffs."
rangers,36rf78,Darclite,3,Thu May 21 16:03:30 2015 UTC,Does he really? Worse than Boyle? Damn... I wouldn't have guessed that.
rangers,36rf78,boxtowire,1 point,Thu May 21 17:25:50 2015 UTC,Boyle's are the best lol.  Shot attempt differentials through the playoffs with each on the ice are +53 for Boyle and -47 for Staal. 100 shot attempts apart.
rangers,36rf78,blueshirtdave,2,Fri May 22 00:29:55 2015 UTC,"He played well in Game 1 this series but was atrocious in Games 2 and 3. I agree, I see no reason to move him up based on his play."
rangers,36rf78,sofakingmad,2,Thu May 21 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"I've talked a lot in various threads about the points you've brought up, so I'll pull them all into this response.  Since I like sandwhich approaches (positive statement - weakness call outs - restoration of faith), let me start by saying that we can (and I believe will) get out of this series and play for the Cup.  It'll be a mountain, but it's one we've climbed before.  Here's how I see it, in Start-Stop-Continue format (see the Manager in me shining through yet?):    FORWARDS:  Nash: START driving hard to the net, and pulling defenders out of position.  Play hard, and skate like it's game 7.  STOP with the twirl move, and trying to snipe it from 40ft out.  CONTINUE tracking back on defense and hitting hard on the forecheck.    Brass: START driving hard to the net with Nash and pull him in with you.  Lead by example.  STOP taking so many damn penalties.  Keep your stick down.  CONTINUE popping shots from wherever you're at.    Kreids: START pitching a damn tent in front of Bishop.  Make sure he can only see you, and nothing else.  STOP letting the Bolts get in your head.  If you take a hard hit, shake it off and remember the big picture.  CONTINUE throwing your weight around on the forecheck, and forcing the opposition into mistakes.  Also, scoring.  Step: START winning some faceoffs for christsake.  Spend every minute of practice squaring up with Dom if needed.  STOP (have no idea - he's honestly doing everything right aside from faceoffs).  CONTINUE looking for an open lane to pass in.  That's what makes you elite.    MSL: START ... scoring?  Spend every minute of practice taking line drive passes into your skates and tipping it in.  We need you to hit those Marty.  STOP being hesitant on the Powerplay.  Pick a spot and fire it - don't think too much on it.  Use your instinct.  CONTINUE skating hard and causing trouble on the forecheck.    Hayes: START using your size to drive hard to the net.  STOP, for the love of god, trying to be a hero.  We know you handle the puck well, but you don't need to attempt to skate into 4 defenders to prove it. CONTINUE playing on adrenaline.  We need your youth and fire.    Hags: START shooting more.  You scored some big goals, and lately all we've seen is speed.  Fire it on net dude.  STOP trying to be cute with the puck and just run at people.  When they're on their heels facing you, they're dead.  CONTINUE with your redirections.  It's so fast I laugh each time.  It's hard to contain you on the boards.    Fast: START shooting more, my god.  You've got moves kid.  STOP (can't think of anything - he's on point right now).  CONTINUE playing until your lungs burst.  You're an inspiration!    Miller: START using your size to gain an advantage.  STOP trying to pip one in from 40ft (see: Rick Nash).  CONTINUE looking for that cross ice pass.  You're downright solid at that.    Moore: START training the rest of the centers to take faceoffs.  STOP being over physical at times.  Getting close to costing us.  CONTINUE winning faceoffs (see a theme here?).    Shep: START being more offensive minded.  Take some shots kid!  STOP (can't think of anything really).  CONTINUE playing your ass off, skating hard, and flying into challenges.    Glass: START looking to shoot maybe a little more?  STOP (can't think of anything honestly).  CONTINUE being a heart and soul player.  You've proved everyone wrong and are one of our most consistent players right now.  Really earning it every night.  Proud of you.    DEFENSE:  Mac: START shooting more - you've got a helluva shot - take it!  STOP relying on your speed to catch the opposition.  Play smart, and use your speed when it's critical.  CONTINUE wearing your heart on your sleeve.    G: START working on your shot.  You're on the PP, so you need to be a force.  STOP losing speedy players.  If they're faster, use your body to slow them down.  CONTINUE being made of Girardium and throwing your body into the fray.  Inspiring.    Staal: START taking shooting lessons.  Can't be missing the net from a few feet out.  STOP holding the puck until the last possible moment before clearing it down the ice - playing with fire.  CONTINUE playing fairly solid 1 on 1 defense.    Klein: START shooting more - use that laser shot.  STOP holding back on offense.  See point #1.  CONTINUE putting in solid defensive minutes each night.    Yandle: START throwing it on net when you have a lane.  STOP assuming Boyle will cover his man each time.  Play more defensively when not on the PP.  CONTINUE making smart plays with the puck at your stick.  Just shoot it more!    Boyle: START taking it hard up the ice, instead of causally skating into the neutral zone.  Keep your head up on the PP.  STOP trying the no look passes.  Look where you're passing, so you can also see who's about to take the puck from you.  CONTINUE being in the right place at the right time around the net.  Dude cleans up the garbage.    GOALIE:  Hank: START firing the puck around the boards when you play it instead of looking for a perfect pass.  This is the playoffs, and it's nearly costed us several times.  Be quick and don't think about it too much.  STOP coming out of the crease as much.  Stay there and do what you to best - react and use your reflexes.  CONTINUE staying positive and believing in yourself and the team.  You're a huge reason we're here, and we believe in you.    ***  Last point, specifically about Hank.  We don't need to put Talbot in.  I know that sounds like a reasonable choice on paper, but remember  - the team plays differently with Cam in net.  It will take them a game or two to adjust (remember?), and we don't have that luxury.  Hank is hard on himself, and will remember what he needs to improve.  Trust and believe.  Cam is a big reason we're in the playoffs to begin with.  He played his part and now we need to count on Hank to bounce back and help us even this out.  We'll do it.  LGR."
rangers,36rf78,high5sexwhoa,3,Thu May 21 18:34:40 2015 UTC,This was great too read. Agree/disagree I still love the writing style.
rangers,36rf78,bjisba41,1 point,Thu May 21 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"bench MSL need to clog the neutral zone to slow down their zone entries (it's been said) split up the D pairings. Mac/Klein, G/Staal or Hunwick.  Klein isn't as slow as you think and Hun in for Boyle works for me. demote Nash...   Miller/Brass/Fast  Kreider/Step/Hayes  Hags/Moore/Nash  Glass/Shep/Bourque  allow your best playing players the top lines. perhaps Hags' speed will open up space for Nash.   also, is it possible Nash is playing hurt? he's not driving to the net like he did in the regular season.  NBC even acknowledged it in OT intermission.  Milbury was all over him and i was glad he was. Hank's issues are in his head.  he's made some splendid saves the last couple of games and stood on his head when we've needed him to.  most goals are because of defensive breakdown.  that said, like some of you have also mentioned, there have been softies.  the 5th (palat) and 6th (kucherov) goals were abysmal.  there is no excuse for either of those going in."

rangers,36spz1,Ralph_Baconader,3,Thu May 21 20:36:03 2015 UTC,The neutral zone needs to be contested. Too many times Tampa entered our zone without someone on them. Perfect example is the GWG from last night.
rangers,36spz1,jedimasterchief,2,Thu May 21 20:46:52 2015 UTC,Agreed but Tampa is to skilled and fast to have the defense stand them up on the blue line so the Rangers would need the backcheck from the forwards to do that. Both Palat's goals come when Mac on the first one and Girardi on the 2nd stepped open on a forward on the blue line and left only one dman back
rangers,36spz1,LIGuy631,2,Thu May 21 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"Give MSL a chance for a few shifts, if he still looks terrible, bench him.  The guy has been an absolute liability out there.  Utilize Hayes, Miller, Fast and Hunwick.  Get players in front of the net and start shooting the god damned puck.  Sloppy goals are still goals, and it seems they're trying to make every goal perfect.  I know the players don't always have a lane to shoot, but they are passing way too much.  Sometimes you need to launch a puck towards the net and hope for the best."
rangers,36spz1,grc_tv,2,Thu May 21 21:24:01 2015 UTC,I think refraining from shooting the puck into Bishop's chest at 20mph is smart.
rangers,36spz1,averyrule,1 point,Fri May 22 01:33:32 2015 UTC,"Don't get scared and give them space when they come into our zone. Better gap control from the D.  Forwards need not to have brainfarts and need to actually cover their guy.  If we play sound defense, we'll get good offense. That's been the basis of our game all year. We need to get back to that, because a track meet will turn into a tire fire for us against this team."
rangers,36pl8r,sinister_kid89,7,Thu May 21 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/b2ny89e.gif  On mobile, hope that worked"
rangers,36pl8r,DSPGerm,-5,Thu May 21 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"Even with the goal, Boyle still needs to be pulled and Hundwick needs to be in. Against a deep, fast, skilled set of forwards like Tampa, Boyle is a liability more than anything else."
rangers,36pl8r,tj_sad_boi_666,6,Thu May 21 03:38:19 2015 UTC,Dan Boyle was one of only 2 positive possession players defensemen for the Rangers tonight. If you wanna bench someone because they're playing poorly against Tampa's speed and skill maybe bench Girardi or Klein considering they both played like fucking dumpster fires tonight.
rangers,36pl8r,guninmouth,15,Thu May 21 05:46:46 2015 UTC,"We need all the help we can get. This is the playoffs. You should be praising his work, not shunning him. He actually produces. We are playing the best teams in the league. Believe it or not, but we made it this far because of plays like his. He might not be popular, but he's been effective even though he's been a problem. I get what you're doing, but he's actually been extremely productive defensively and offensively, aside from a few minor mishaps, even though those mishaps could have been offset by decent work by the work of his counterparts. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think I'm unreasonable. Defense has been falling, and offense has tried to pitch in, but has also failed (but that's not their fault either)."
rangers,36pl8r,Darclite,14,Thu May 21 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should just have a copypasta of his stats (both regular and advanced) for every time someone wants to bench him, because it's becoming a full time job to explain that he's not one of the bigger problems with the team."
rangers,36pl8r,blueshirtdave,3,Thu May 21 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  As much shit as he catches, he scores big goals, and is one of our best offensive threats.  There's about 3-4 other players lagging behind that aren't producing that need a kick in the pants way before he gets one."

rangers,36pnc6,CunnilingusPhD,10,Thu May 21 03:11:09 2015 UTC,St Louis and Lundqvist need to pull it together. We keep making mistakes on a team that will kill us for that.
rangers,36pnc6,Superwasteful_sober,4,Thu May 21 03:13:06 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of sloppy/ sub par play all around, MSL played better tonight I think, but the defensive ass hattery tonight was crazy in our zone. Oh and if you find Nash let him know that there is a series going on."
rangers,36pnc6,CunnilingusPhD,5,Thu May 21 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think MSL is in rougher shape, at least Nash is a good two-way player."
rangers,36pnc6,Superwasteful_sober,10,Thu May 21 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"And Nash is getting shots off once in a while, weak as they may be. I'm losing count of how many good chances MSL has whiffed on now..."
rangers,36pnc6,ismele,5,Thu May 21 03:19:35 2015 UTC,Shots that miss the net completely for 5 feet out.
rangers,36pnc6,Superwasteful_sober,2,Thu May 21 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"He had three SOG tonight. Not saying it's good - two went right into Bishop's glove - but MSL had none, and he had at least two good opportunities in front of the net.  In the end if none of the shots go in I guess it doesn't make a huge difference, but bad shots are better than none. You never know when you get a good rebound or deflection."
rangers,36pnc6,ismele,2,Thu May 21 03:24:07 2015 UTC,"Oh man I was talking about MSL missing the net from five feet, my bad! Yeah Edzo on NBC is right about that, never a bad play to put the puck on net."
rangers,36pnc6,Superwasteful_sober,3,Thu May 21 03:25:38 2015 UTC,He only played better in that he didn't directly cause a goal. He's still useless out there.

rangers,36pnc6,guninmouth,45,Thu May 21 03:57:04 2015 UTC,Who the FUCK would've thought Hank and the defense would ever lose us two straight games while our offense keeps us in it. FUCK.
rangers,36pnc6,emjayd,39,Thu May 21 03:06:52 2015 UTC,"Extremely dissapointing. Even though it was close, this was not Rangers hockey. We need to stop playing their game and play ours. That means defence."
rangers,36pnc6,beardlessdick,5,Thu May 21 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"Putting Hank's rough game aside, there were multiple Rangers on most of those goals that had chances to make EASY defensive plays and just shit the bed. I'm fine with possibly giving up an odd man rush or 2, but we had numbers on basically every goal that Tampa scored."
rangers,36pnc6,nugget136,34,Thu May 21 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"What the fuck, Hank?"
rangers,36pnc6,sizeablescars,86,Thu May 21 03:05:58 2015 UTC,Downvote me all you want but hank let two very weak goals in. Tonight not his best outing. Hockey really is the most heartbreaking sport. This one hurts..

rangers,36pnc6,guninmouth,3,Thu May 21 03:56:46 2015 UTC,After the 4th goal I thought they were gonna yank him
rangers,36pnc6,callmejoe8,27,Thu May 21 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"12 goals in two games. Our defense has been getting burned, bad. But Hank has not been at his best."
rangers,36pnc6,mr_thr0w_away,15,Thu May 21 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"arguably at his worst honestly. Yes he made a few great saves, but Tampas goals tonight weren't exactly unstoppable."
rangers,36pnc6,MikeyRage,3,Thu May 21 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"Look, I understand not benching him, but this cannot continue to happen. MSL on the other hand..."
rangers,36pnc6,mr_thr0w_away,5,Thu May 21 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"This is something that worries me. I can't help but feel like our guys are emotionally, physically, and mentally spent from our past two series. I mean, it must take a toll when you're constantly playing these one goal games, throwing everything at the opposing net, blocking all these shots, Hank having to make all these saves, etc. There are obviously other things that could be worked on...but I don't think you could necessarily rule this out, either.   I am curious to see if Cam or Hank will play, though. However, I just don't know if starting Cam would be an overreaction at this point because to be fair, Hank was kind of left out to dry in Game 2 (so many goals came off of odd-man rushes/PPGs). If anything, you could argue that tonight's game was his one bad game. Not to mention, not that I think Cam is incapable or anything, but I think there would be some concern starting him when he hasn't played in almost two months now."
rangers,36pnc6,keetner,29,Thu May 21 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"Here's the unpopular opinion.   Bench him, Talbot is pretty good, and something isn't right with him.  12 goals on 66 shots in the playoffs is atrocious. I don't care if ""he's the guy"" you need to play the best team you can to win. And he's not right now, don't know if its injury or mental or Tampa just figured him out. But time to bench him.  Should have benched him going into the 3rd and maybe they win this. Terrible."
rangers,36pnc6,PyreDruid,27,Thu May 21 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree here. If Lundqvist lets in a few early next game, bench him. But don't completely lose faith in him because he had two shitty games backed by a horrible defense. To me benching Hank would be demoralizing as a player. Hank knows he hasn't been good enough, but look at game 1. I don't think he's lost his game, I think these games are just bad outliers not helped by the play in front of him. Give credit to Tampa, many of the shots he's faced just aren't stoppable."
rangers,36pnc6,rangersmetsgiants27,7,Thu May 21 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"If Lundqvist lets in a few early next game they could be out of the series for all intents and purposes.  If they won tonight I agree. But he's been below average at best in 5 of 6 games against them this year. And Friday is must win. You can't take that chance.   People say look at game 1, sure, but he's had a 83% save against Tampa this year including game one. Game one was the aberration, not the norm."
rangers,36pnc6,PyreDruid,7,Thu May 21 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"It's also a mental thing, if they see Talbot playing over Lundqvist, it might be a wake up call. On top of that Lundqvist has let up an average around 4 goals a game against TB this year."
rangers,36pnc6,romano78,3,Thu May 21 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"I think they've figured something out about him, he really hasn't been sharp against them this year. I don't have any faith they can get into this series with him in net.  Maybe one of the ex-rangers they have told them how to beat him. But it has to be Talbot. You can't hope he figures it out when he's shown over 120+ minutes he's struggling, this isn't November when a 4 game losing streak is meaningless."
rangers,36pnc6,PyreDruid,2,Thu May 21 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"I think this is the biggest thing keeping Hank in net. The only reason to keep a struggling goalie in net is because he can add cohesiveness ( which has struggled tremendously, at least on the ice)"
rangers,36pnc6,something_irrelevant,3,Thu May 21 03:29:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Tampa knows something about how to beat him. They've had his number this year.   Aside from Game 1, out of the other 5, this was the 2nd best SV% he's had against them this year. And it wasn't good. Maybe an ex-ranger gave them hints or something."
rangers,36pnc6,PyreDruid,2,Thu May 21 03:25:24 2015 UTC,He should have been benched last game.
rangers,36pnc6,jedimasterchief,2,Thu May 21 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"I also agree - the Lightning clearly have his number. As for the debate about switching if hank lets in more next game, it seems like making the switch midgame is a much bigger mental blow than starting with talbot."
rangers,36pnc6,ajayaday,2,Thu May 21 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Are we sure Talbot would perform that well right off the bat, though? He was a beast when he was filling in for Hank earlier this season, but it took him a while to get there. His first few games were rather horrid."
rangers,36pnc6,lucidorlarsson,2,Thu May 21 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"No way you bench Hank.  He is the rock of your team. He ain't Crawford. He is the King with two bad games.  He got you here. He'll come back. Yes,  2 to 3 bad goals. He should have gotten the primary assist on that Stamkos goal. But no way you put Cam in. He has 0 playoff starts."
rangers,36pnc6,eatmyputin,2,Thu May 21 04:05:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. This hurts really badly.
rangers,36pnc6,owlsgohooot,2,Thu May 21 07:47:21 2015 UTC,"Hes allowed to lapse here and there of course, but he needs to play shutdown for the rest of the series now. He'll responsd big like he always does, but tonight was ugly to watch."
rangers,36pnc6,librbmc,26,Thu May 21 03:29:23 2015 UTC,i'm sorry but this is on Hank 100%. 3 goals that could have easily been handled. Lightning are in his head.
rangers,36pnc6,skunkbutter,4,Thu May 21 03:28:10 2015 UTC,"the last one was definitely his fault and maybe the 5th, the others were defensive lapses."
rangers,36pnc6,darkknight915,3,Thu May 21 03:36:43 2015 UTC,The one where Hank pushed the puck out with his stick right into a Lightning player was Hank's fault too.
rangers,36pnc6,Teddie1056,7,Thu May 21 03:08:12 2015 UTC,I think the defense was to blame for half but there are 3 especially that last one that are absolutely brutal. This sub will continue to complain about Nash but he's not the reason this team has given up so many goals
rangers,36pnc6,bu77munch,6,Thu May 21 03:11:29 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but in this case the D did everything that could be reasonably expected and Hank failed to make elementary saves. It is one thing if he isn't making highlight reel saves, but we're talking about basic, expected stops. He needs to elevate his game against this team or V needs to think about Talbot. I know that is an emotional reaction, but no one can deny that Tampa has his number."
rangers,36pnc6,skunkbutter,21,Thu May 21 03:17:41 2015 UTC,Lundqvist should have fucking had that
rangers,36pnc6,artvandelay1994,20,Thu May 21 03:09:42 2015 UTC,"Down 2-1 again. Series can be won, but damn I would have loved a lead in the series."
rangers,36pnc6,aceofears,2,Thu May 21 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"Knowing this team, even if they won tonight, they'd lose Friday. It seems to always be 2-2 or 1-3 after game 4."
rangers,36pnc6,jaspor,2,Thu May 21 03:06:04 2015 UTC,Every time we've lost two this year we've come back to win the next three.
rangers,36pnc6,schroderrr,13,Thu May 21 03:05:55 2015 UTC,FOUR GUYS ON HIM.   AND HANK.... AFTER A SAVE LIKE THAT?!
rangers,36pnc6,berkley1217,1 point,Thu May 21 03:22:41 2015 UTC,THIS.
rangers,36pnc6,janschonp,15,Thu May 21 11:04:12 2015 UTC,Hank got caught sleeping.
rangers,36pnc6,UnlawfulShadowban,42,Thu May 21 03:06:33 2015 UTC,All I can say is BELIEVE IN THIS TEAM.  Take it one game at a time. Don't give up. The series isn't over. It's only 2-1. BELIEVE.
rangers,36pnc6,Nether_Ending,11,Thu May 21 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"I will ALWAYS believe in this team... BUT you can't help but be bummed after another game of NON-Rangers hockey. We ARE figuring out Bishop, but a win would've been VERY nice. Defense needs to stop letting hank out to dry. That loss was everyone's part but the Rangers need to play RANGERS HOCKEY."
rangers,36pnc6,Walk_Yo_Dinosaur,3,Thu May 21 03:06:35 2015 UTC,If we can figure out Bishop. AV will have a way to figure out Johnson's line and once they do. The Rangers will be able to breathe more
rangers,36pnc6,Nether_Ending,2,Thu May 21 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"I think the summary above said it all pretty well... Yes we did stay in the game (this game was mostly us, not any rebounds or own goals like the last two) but as a team it was awful. Every time one part of the team would do well, another would just falter, and vice versa. We looked like a (trying to think of a good analogy) machine that would jam somewhere but as soon as you fixed it another part would jam (sorry best I could do). I know that goal (well I feel) was an awful one to let in (the OT goal), with the hockey we SHOULD be playing we should have been smiling our way out of Amilie at the end of the 3rd. We can win this series but we cannot, I repeat, cannot drop to 1-3. Regardless if we flourish there, I do not want to see survival hockey, because we shouldn't be there in the first place. The team has to wake up on all ends, and whoever feels like they're not doing anything wrong better help those people that are struggling. Johnson can have his singular highlight reels all day, but he can watch that shit on his couch when we head to the Stanley Cup finals. If one person is going to have a breakout game, EVERYONE needs to have a breakout game. We need to play as a team. The series is only 1-2 (I use the word only with reservations) but I ain't exactly going to sleep happy. I feel that the worst part is that we ALL know that we can do better. Only reason I can wait for the next game is because the boys in blue need to get their act together, and play like the team they really are. Lets go Rangers!!!!!!!!!"
rangers,36pnc6,Walk_Yo_Dinosaur,12,Thu May 21 03:11:46 2015 UTC,Agreed totally. This is going to be a thread of negative pile-on but if any team comes back its the goddamn rangers. HAVE FAITH
rangers,36pnc6,ansky,2,Thu May 21 03:17:55 2015 UTC,It's only 2-1. This is a patient team. They'll find a way.
rangers,36pnc6,sinister_kid89,11,Thu May 21 03:38:16 2015 UTC,"Hideous game overall.  Defense needs to step their shit up big time.  If Lundqvist is letting in 6 goals a game, you are doing something extremely wrong.  Granted Lundqvist hasn't been himself either, getting beat on fairly average shots and that pokecheck giveaway earlier was horrific."
rangers,36pnc6,VSPinkie,11,Thu May 21 03:07:13 2015 UTC,Hank needs to stop a goddamn puck.
rangers,36pnc6,fondlemeLeroy,16,Thu May 21 03:35:55 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that since December 1st, every time the Rangers have lost 2 games in a row they went on to win the next 3 or more games. I will not lose faith."
rangers,36pnc6,PAGANP666,3,Thu May 21 03:05:57 2015 UTC,Amen.
rangers,36pnc6,owlsgohooot,8,Thu May 21 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"It's only 2-1, but that was absolutely not encouraging in any way.  And that last goal from Lundqvist was absolutely brutal. That was like Richter-against-Francis-in-1992 bad."
rangers,36pnc6,runninhillbilly,8,Thu May 21 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"Even if we lost the series, I really just wanted to win this game so we could have gone nuts in the park. This quiet subway ride home sucks so much I'm spending it writing this comment."

rangers,36pnc6,NJ_Yankees_Fan,9,Thu May 21 03:06:59 2015 UTC,Ugh tough loss. We need to tighten up on D and find a way to stop all the breakaways. I have faith. We win on Friday and it's tied coming home. Keep your heads up. LGR
rangers,36pnc6,blueshirtdave,7,Thu May 21 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"I love Hank, but that was the worst game I've ever seen him play."
rangers,36pnc6,michugana,5,Thu May 21 03:05:12 2015 UTC,Last series gave me heart attacks and now this series is just pissing me off
rangers,36pnc6,racistfetus,8,Thu May 21 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that even though we're ""only"" down 2-1, those 2 losses feel really big."
rangers,36pnc6,ajayaday,5,Thu May 21 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"Never would've thought 2 weeks ago that our offense would be keeping us in games and the defense/goaltending would be letting us down.  That was really a disgusting display tonight. I'll give Boyle somewhat of a pass because he did score the game tying goal and assisted on another. He's even as far as I'm concerned. But the rest of the defense was atrocious - even if you weren't a defensemen. Kreider played like a 23 year old hothead on that 5th goal when he went for a hit and blew his assignment in the process (and took Girardi out of the play with him). Klein's playing right defense and he's immediately to Lundqvist's left on the 3rd or 4th goal - leaving a guy who SCORED A HAT TRICK TWO DAYS AGO wide open to get ANOTHER one. We let Tampa, a team that's basically playing our game, skate into our zone. We had way too many turnovers leading to odd mans. Penaltywise, we were a bit better than last game but still not great. AV gets blame for this too - I haven't seen any adjustments made.  Marty is a black hole at this point. If he was a healthy scratch next game I wouldn't complain.   Lastly, Lundqvist has not been great and I'm very worried based on his history this year that Tampa is in his head. But I think starting Talbot is way too much of an overreaction. Pulling your goalie for a guy who has not played in over a month when you're already down 1 game, can't afford another loss (at least not until game 6), and are playing shit D is a very bad idea.  With that said, we can take two big positives out of the game: our power play is still connecting and Bishop isn't looking great either."

rangers,36pnc6,MADBARZ,12,Thu May 21 03:19:52 2015 UTC,Hank fucked up twice.
rangers,36pnc6,avicon,1 point,Thu May 21 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"And made plays a dozen more times. Don't get me wrong, he's playing horribly. But I still blame the weak defense more than him."
rangers,36pnc6,MADBARZ,2,Thu May 21 03:07:05 2015 UTC,This is the dilemma. Yeah he gave up some weak goals. But he also had a few saves that no one else would have stopped. It's weird in a way
rangers,36pnc6,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,18,Thu May 21 03:08:18 2015 UTC,"I'm so fucking tired of watching us get so many perfectly great chances to put it into their net, only to have this team shoot it wide or right into Bishop's chest/pads.  Then, through our stupid mistakes and defensive blunders that we continue to make, be able to easily put one past Lundqvist."
rangers,36pnc6,slimer16,14,Thu May 21 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the offense converted this game. You won't hit 100%, and we were like at like 18% of shots converting. That's not bad."
rangers,36pnc6,Teddie1056,9,Thu May 21 04:11:24 2015 UTC,We got 2 PPG's tonight and 5 goals total. The offense did their job. 5 goals in every other night gets you a win.
rangers,36pnc6,FLRangerFan,8,Thu May 21 03:06:13 2015 UTC,"We scored 5 goals. That's a playoff high. You can't ask more from the offense, we need to play our game and play better defensively. If we are to lose this series, it'll be because the defense did not step up. We're letting Tampa play their game, we need to enforce ours like we did in Game 1. LGR!"

rangers,36pnc6,NDIrish27,5,Thu May 21 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"TB has us completely off of our game.   I cannot count the number of odd man rushes TB has had thus far. In the regular season, the Rangers always had proper defense back.   We're leaving Hank to fend for himself. 3 goals were due to sloppy play.   That being said, Hank totally blew it on that last shot."
rangers,36pnc6,_TheConsumer_,3,Thu May 21 03:06:31 2015 UTC,"Hank did not play well today. Yes, I am disappointed, but I also have total faith that he will step up and lead this team to victory. It's gonna be a tough series, but the best teams face adversity before finally lifting the cup. If we are truly the best team in the NHL, we will rise to this challenge and find a solution to this problem.  I believe in Hank.  I believe in our team.  LGR!"
rangers,36pnc6,Byrne_XC,2,Thu May 21 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, I believe in Hank too, but two games in a row? Thats not an anomaly, thats a sign of a problem."
rangers,36pnc6,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Thu May 21 03:11:33 2015 UTC,"And I believe that he has the potential to solve that problem. Great players aren't always flawless, but they do have the ability and drive to bounce back from slumps like this."
rangers,36pnc6,Byrne_XC,3,Thu May 21 03:16:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he does. Normally he does. I expected today to be a bounce-back game for him, as it normally is when he lets up 4+. But he followed it up by letting in another 6. Not all his fault, D definitely has some explaining to do, but that last shot? I see that go in and I know something is wrong. Mentally or Physically he is tired, and he might benefit from a few more days off than usual."
rangers,36pnc6,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Thu May 21 03:20:22 2015 UTC,"We'll see what Vigneault does about it. I would like to see Hank in net, but maybe give Talbot a game to give Hank a rest. Only problem is that he hasn't played in a month and a half."
rangers,36pnc6,Byrne_XC,3,Thu May 21 03:23:40 2015 UTC,"Sigh...fuck.   I knew the series against the Bolts wouldn't be easy, but argh. I still feel like we can be the better team, but it seems as though we haven't figured out how to shut them down properly, and it's quite frustrating to see.   They keep generating all these fucking odd-man rushes. And really, I don't think it's too dissimilar to what we've done to try to create chances. When we have offensive pressure, I notice they have guys waiting near the blue line for a puck to pop loose, or they just forecheck our guys there (eg. Stamkos on Boyle, leading to that goal). I'm pretty sure they know we have a tendency to pinch, so it honestly doesn't surprise me they've had so many chances like that...  I think our defense needs to be better all around. Not just play from the guys per se, but WHERE we're defending (though to be fair, I thought we got better at breaking up rushes near the end of the third/more in OT). We let them transition into our zone way too easily, and we'd just collapse in front of the net + try to block shots. But the issue is that Tampa moves the puck so damn well that we need to prevent chances like that. I mean, as far as I can tell, so many of the goals have been from passes left-right across the ice, forcing Hank to lunge across his crease. And unfortunately...he can't always make it in time.   I don't really want to harp on our players too much, but man. We really need some kind of spark from Nash or Marty. I'm not asking for super hot scoring (I mean, that would be nice) but for the past three games now, I feel like they're also having trouble making other plays that they often do (setting stuff up, defensive plays, etc.). Definitely missing Zucc right now, though -- I feel like he could lift things up a bit :(.  On the plus side, it was nice to see we were able to battle back for the most part, PP + FO% looked better, Fast had a fantastic game (two goals + very aggressive tonight) and I thought Boyle, despite that slight flub in the first period, looked better as the game went on. But even then, you can't help but feel frustrated about the outcome of this game.   Really hoping we can turn it around."

But for the first time, I just don't know if they can get it done. That optimism I've kept up, even to the end of this game just died out. Hopefully it comes back by game 4, because watching any sport when you think your team can't win isn't any fun at all."
rangers,36pnc6,AwesomeExo,4,Thu May 21 03:07:32 2015 UTC,That's because you can typically rely on Hank. Not anymore apparently.
rangers,36pnc6,fondlemeLeroy,5,Thu May 21 03:08:32 2015 UTC,We just got outplayed on defense...
rangers,36pnc6,something_irrelevant,4,Thu May 21 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"No, they had a worse save % and let in a bunch of goals too.   Goalie isn't right. Need to make a change in the third there. Henrik had what, 10 goals through 5 periods, time to make the change. Maybe you make that change and you win that."

rangers,36pnc6,jaspor,2,Thu May 21 03:10:24 2015 UTC,2 of those goals were completely on Hank. And again we get burned on almost every mental mistake.   I think we can take some positives from this though. The PP was really affective. The ability to come back. But fuck if we can't do a better job holding onto a 2 goal lead.
rangers,36pnc6,jjjaaammm,5,Thu May 21 03:18:27 2015 UTC,A win Friday night is CRITICAL. These don't seem like the same Rangers that came back from a 3-1 series against the Capitals. That team was a defensive powerhouse.

rangers,36pnc6,bellajella,3,Thu May 21 03:07:50 2015 UTC,why can't we put a good offensive and a good defensive game together in the playoffs?
rangers,36pnc6,ajpod,3,Thu May 21 03:06:13 2015 UTC,"Can we just play like we played in game 1? That was beautiful. Also bishop is 6'7"" but he's soft so fucking shoot the damn puck."
rangers,36pnc6,dberti22,3,Thu May 21 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"This one hurts...a lot, but Friday is now massive. We gotta play like it's Game 7, can't afford to go down 3-1. If we can tie it up going back to NY, we're where we need to be."
rangers,36pnc6,MoJ0SoD0Pe,3,Thu May 21 03:13:26 2015 UTC,Defense was terrible. But I said it all last game and this game just proved it: Bishop cannot control a rebound to save his life. We just need to shoot from anywhere and crash the net.
rangers,36pnc6,elyankee23,3,Thu May 21 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"It's kind of nice that we can play this badly and still only lose in OT to the best team in the playoffs. Our first line is nonexistent, and one, maybe two goals are entirely on Hank. I kind of wanted them to put Talbot in for the third just to make Hank angry."
rangers,36pnc6,callmesnake13,7,Thu May 21 03:17:44 2015 UTC,That was a fucking pitiful performance from Lundqvist. Absolutely disgraceful.
rangers,36pnc6,Shwinky,3,Thu May 21 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"Dont you guys see what Henry is doing? Its so blatant, I cant believe no one has mentioned it. He wants Zucc back for the cup, so he is prolonging the series by letting the lightning take a few games. You think its a coincidence we drop 3 to the caps and come back to take the series in 7? delusion sets in"

rangers,36pnc6,darkknight915,2,Thu May 21 03:23:57 2015 UTC,Up two goals early thought maybe just maybe this will be a nice relaxing dominant playoff game I could wake up happy about.
rangers,36pnc6,dontbthatguy,2,Thu May 21 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ulf needs to fix the defense. We can't keep letting Tampa's top lines just walk into our zone.    Also Girardi was awful tonight."
rangers,36pnc6,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Thu May 21 03:08:33 2015 UTC,I think the defense on a whole was pretty bad tonight.
rangers,36pnc6,darkknight915,1 point,Thu May 21 03:08:55 2015 UTC,Yeah agreed. Just saying G in particular seemed to be flailing around a  lot and letting Tampa's best guys just kind of walk in.
rangers,36pnc6,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Thu May 21 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"That was bad. Hank should've had that last one, so unlike him. Keep in mind though, with a better defensive effort this hadn't gone to OT at all. But let's just shake this shit off and take game 4 to send the series back to NY all tied up! Hank is NOT going to be letting in 6 goals anymore, I don't think."
rangers,36pnc6,emildickson,2,Thu May 21 03:10:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. I don't think it's as dark as people are painting it here. THey scored 4 times in a row and still needed overtime.
rangers,36pnc6,saintstryfe,2,Thu May 21 03:11:54 2015 UTC,If we could play an ounce of defense we would have won this easily. But of course we pick the day we score 5 to do shit like drift off to the side on a 1 on 1 (Klein) and completely miss your man leading to an easy goal (Kreider).  But Hank... what the fuck?
rangers,36pnc6,rangersmetsgiants27,2,Thu May 21 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"Our defense fell apart, Hank fell apart. We're obviously tired, we've played a lot of games over the past month and Hank is feeling the aftereffects. I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I think we should go with Talbot for game 5. We need to get Hank rested and create some competition between the two goalies. We CANNOT be giving up 12 goals in 2 games. You can say some of those weren't Hanks fault, but 12 goals can't just be unlucky. I also think that Matt Hunwick and Chris Bourque should be introduced into the rotation in order to add fresh legs. We need to rejuvenate this team and I hope AV can do just that. LGR!  EDIT: I know the 6th goal was bad, but wtf was hank doing on the 1st goal. He gifted the goal to Stamkos."
rangers,36pnc6,Crossfire912,2,Thu May 21 03:11:25 2015 UTC,HhaahaAhahahaahHaah I'm gonna cry myself to sleep now
rangers,36pnc6,andy2hill,2,Thu May 21 03:10:37 2015 UTC,Enough with this tired excuse. They knocked the Pens out in 5 while the Bolts had to comeback 3-2 from Detroit and let the Habs hang around for another two games.
rangers,36pnc6,NJ_Yankees_Fan,2,Thu May 21 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"Nash is a fucking disgrace. No hoobie joobie horseshit for luck, straight up - he sucks when we need a goal and scores when it doesn't matter. Fuck him."
rangers,36pnc6,NYR,2,Thu May 21 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the Rangers looked flat out awful for about 75% of that game. Tampa has 4 forwads and 1 defender, and the 5 of them absolutely dominated. Yet again, the Rangers made some really dumb mistakes. Kreider needs to put his pride aside after getting nailed and ended up taking out Girardi and lead to that goal.  Brassard needs to cut the fucking shit with these dumb penalties.   Lundqvist had no chance on a few of those goals but had the worst game I have seen him have in quite some time. That last goal is inexcusible.  Rangers need to be way, way quicker moving the puck.  Martin St. Louis should be a healthy scratch next game, no matter what. He's washed up, unfortunately. I would rather see a call up from Hartford with some juice, just like when the Rangers had Korpikoski come up years ago against the Penguins.  Rick Nash just needs to score. I don't know what else to say there.  We really, really miss Zucc."
rangers,36pnc6,Armadillo19,2,Thu May 21 03:14:50 2015 UTC,"Please put in Talbot, It's worth a shot."
rangers,36pnc6,ThatPrettyCoolGuy,2,Thu May 21 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"V needs to think about Talbot. I know that is an emotional reaction, but no one can deny TB has Hank's number. He has looked like dogshit the last two games. We need to do something different."
rangers,36pnc6,skunkbutter,2,Thu May 21 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Kreider has been bad defensively, but most of our goals this series are the result, directly or indirectly, from him parking his big ass in front of Bishop."
rangers,36pnc6,Rocketman_man,3,Thu May 21 03:16:40 2015 UTC,FUCKING EVERYONE has been terrible defensively!!!!!!!!!
rangers,36pnc6,SleepYourLifeAway,2,Thu May 21 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"It seems like the Rangers allow a lot of shots in 1 on 2 or 1 on 3 situations. Our guys tend to shy away from physical play it seems. We hit a lot in this game but we need to be able to do that when the Lightning are moving into the offensive zone, not just along the boards."
rangers,36pnc6,stevemillerisevil,2,Thu May 21 03:22:30 2015 UTC,Head up kids... We just need to steal the next one

They need that eliminated. Honestly, if I were the Bolts I'd be worried - they peppered Bishop and let them come back twice. And the Rangers have this thing about coming back in series."

rangers,36pnc6,NYSportsGuy4,2,Thu May 21 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"I look at this game, this way: We were bad, horrible. But we only lost with one goal in overtime. It could have gone either way. It's so close that everything will clutch and we will win the next game."

rangers,36pnc6,hman1025,2,Thu May 21 03:06:39 2015 UTC,I posted this in the game thread but here goes again:  I think the rangers need to consider Talbot. I'm not saying game over for Henrik in NY but still. He hasn't played well against this team. 12 goals in two games and 15 goals in three games in the regular season (right?).

rangers,36pnc6,Enzo95,3,Thu May 21 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with Boyle is that he still plays like he's 28, but he can't skate like that anymore. Against a team like Tampa, who fucking flies and smokes their opposition in transition, Boyle is nothing but a liability on the blue line (i.e., getting muscled off the puck by Stamkos who then took off with the puck and set up Tampa's first goal)."
rangers,36pnc6,sinister_kid89,3,Thu May 21 03:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, Stamkos can level guys like Hayes. Guy's a beast. Also Boyle is probably hurt. I dunno, I'm worried. Many said the Rangers had a hard time against the Caps because they are a heavy hard hitting team. But now we have a speedy team and we are being outplayed and outmuscled. We better tie this series next game, cause I dunno if we still have the energy to go the distance with these guys."

rangers,36ppnl,rgby22,4,Thu May 21 03:32:57 2015 UTC,no I dont think it will continue as is. What has me more worried are the goals that Hank had no chance of saving. The ones the D just gave up. They really need to figure out how to play like they did on game 1 again.
rangers,36ppnl,lespaul210,2,Thu May 21 10:24:14 2015 UTC,"I sadly missed the last two games due to work, but from what I've heard and seen on replays, we look terrible. We looked great in game one, but really, how does our top tier defense allow Tampa prime chances to connect on 12 goals on, arguably, the best goaltender in the world within two games?  Age  has RAPIDLY caught up to Marty. He can't connect on shots, and defensively he hasn't been astute either. However, he can still pass the puck as he does have a few points on assists this post season.   BDR, on the other hand, seems to have lost his figurative libido. He has gone to Big Dick Rick to Limp Dick Rick with the quickness as he has yet to perform like he did in the regular season. Granted, he does have a couple or three goals, but he hasn't shown enough prowess or aggressiveness. It almost makes me hope he has an injury that might be hindering his game that they're not disclosing, as it would give insight on what happened to his game.  Whatever it is that's wrong with this team, it needs to be solved by Friday at 5pm pacific.  That being said, I have total faith in our team. I know we are resilient, and I know we can score now. We put up 5 in this loss. If we can score like that and stop this bolts' defense, this series is ours to be won, regardless if we are down 2-1 in the series.   We got this!! LET'S FUCKING GO RANGERS!!!!!"

Our offense is finally putting up some what respectable numbers. I know our defense has left plenty to be desired but he's letting in some soft goals.  I hate how no one can question or criticize Hank without being told they're ""giving up on the team.""   Start Talbot. We don't have the time or games to spare waiting around for everyone else to figure out how to stop Tampa."
rangers,36ppnl,rangersmetsgiants27,14,Thu May 21 12:37:04 2015 UTC,We stop believing in this team so easily on this sub. Same people that jumped ship when down 3-1 to Washington. There's no reason to believe we'll go out giving up 6 goals a game. We'll rebound because we always do. That's our identity.

rangers,36ppnl,Darclite,7,Thu May 21 03:36:34 2015 UTC,They outplay the bolts in game 2 and lose by 4 then they look like a pos this game and only lose by an OT garbage goal.. that's hockey folks.  Maybe the rangers should stop giving them blueline to blueline to carry it up and learn how to use the boards rather than these cross ice passes and they would have taken a game.

Lundqvist will NOT have another bad game like this. He is better than this. Our team is better than this.  We proved tonight, if anything, that this team is beatable. We put up 5 goals against them. We can SCORE against this team. We just need to play some fucking defense.  Adjustments will be made. No reason to lose faith. LGR"
rangers,36ppnl,Imstephalee,3,Thu May 21 03:42:08 2015 UTC,they reason people are suggesting starting talbot isn’t because hank is bad. it’s because there is a different dynamic when you start talbot than there is when you start hank. the team seems to feel less comfortable and more on their toes with cam in goal. they need to tighten up their defensive play. sometimes a change like that can cause a needed spark.
rangers,36ppnl,andrewanthem,2,Thu May 21 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"Hanks numbers against the bolts aren't great, that said I still think he played amazingly tonight and had some clutch saves. I would love to see them Play Talbot because I love Talbot so damn much and I never get to see him play. I would love to see him get some experience in the playoffs before we trade him in the off season and my heart breaks. I think he deserves it. I know it will never happen but I can dream."

This isn't just these past two games, it is hanks history with this new Tampa team.  I think talbot definitely deserves the next start.  And more if he plays well.  But just like Chicago did with darling, it's hanks playoffs and we'd go back to him of we advance or cam has a bad game."

rangers,36ppnl,jedimasterchief,-1,Sat May 23 13:39:56 2015 UTC,at forward they're actually much deeper. And defensive depth is comparable. They were only in this one by luck.
rangers,36ppnl,BELEAFFF,1 point,Thu May 21 06:18:35 2015 UTC,Defensively it's not fucking comparable. We have a better defense. Stralman is on their top pairing. He played second pairing here and might even be on the 3rd pairing if we still had him.
rangers,36ppnl,BELEAFFF,3,Thu May 21 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"Stralman is very underrated, and the Rangers defense has been weak these playoffs. The Bolts have a top 5 or at least top 7/8 dcore in the league, the Rangers are maybe 3rd best (NSH is better no question, STL is arguably better, maybe Anaheim is too, WPG is close but worse). There is not that much of a difference."

rangers,36sc4d,One_2nd,8,Thu May 21 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"If he gives up three in the first, yank him regardless if it was his fault or not. Hank should absolutely start though."
rangers,36sc4d,freegucciburr,13,Thu May 21 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"I say if #30 gives up 4 goals in less than 40 minutes, or 3 in less than 20, give him the hook and let Talbot try it.  He played a big part when Hank went down. Putting him in could be the slap in the face the D needs.  Hank is getting torched right now. Part of it is him, part of it is the defense. They both need to step up."
rangers,36sc4d,khalaron,1 point,Thu May 21 19:27:39 2015 UTC,I just worry that pulling him mid-game will create a big moral blow.  Starting with Talbot is embarrassing but not as embarrassing as being pulled out in the middle of a game. Also those 3 or 4 goals will put us in a reallllllly bad place for the series.
rangers,36sc4d,ajayaday,2,Thu May 21 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think either option is embarrassing. And even if they are, fuck it. Do what gives us the best chance of taking the series."
rangers,36sc4d,Tsunkatse,6,Fri May 22 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"Hank should start. You don't turn away from an all-world goalie in the ECF because he's had two bad games that were largely driven by piss-poor defense and taking too many bad penalties. There were goals Hank would normally stop and should have, but didn't, but he's just too good to go away from. Typically after he plays poorly he gets really pissed and puts up a streak of ridiculous games and I don't remember him looking this bad in a long, long time, so I expect him to rebound big time moving forward.  That all being said, if he stumbles out of the gate tomorrow night and coughs up two or three quick goals in the first, it should be Goal Buster time. If Talbot holds fort and the Rangers win that game, now you have some legitimate questions about who should start game five. We aren't there yet, though.   All hail the King!"
rangers,36sc4d,unspokenfor,6,Thu May 21 20:22:53 2015 UTC,Good thing you don't make decisions. AV rightfully won't let Talbot start.
rangers,36sc4d,cherter1,7,Thu May 21 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"Not a good idea. It won't happen, either. But, you can't just throw in a back up goalie, no matter how good, who hasn't played in over a month and expect him to be ready to play in an Eastern Conference Finals game. The team knows they need to improve defensively. It certainly shouldn't take a goaltender switch for top professional athletes to come to this realization and act upon it. Also, I just don't see Hank playing poorly again. Two 6 goal games in a row, but I don't foresee such active goal scoring for a third game in a row. Hank is a top notch athlete, arguably the best currently playing at this time. He along with the team will make the necessary adjustments, and that doesn't include giving him a night off."
rangers,36sc4d,cherter1,0,Thu May 21 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I felt going into last night's game. But like I said, henrik has responded well in the past to being pulled. I disagree that talbot would be shakey, I have full confidence that he can play better than hank has in this series thus far. I agree that it probably won't happen, but for the sake of discussion, I really don't think it'd be a bad move at this point."
rangers,36sc4d,cherter1,2,Thu May 21 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Talbot fan. Wherever he ends up in the future, minus the Flyers or Devils, I will support him. But, I think you always take a risk of a goaltender shaking off the dust. What kind of message does pulling Hank send to the team? And do they respond positively? Those would be the biggest issues. I'm just afraid the team is aware they've been outplayed, and this can shake their confidence. I don't think they've ""met their match"", but I don't want the team having those thoughts subtly instilled in them. I wouldn't be horrified to see Talbot in net (hypothetically) next game. I'd be indifferent to hesitant about the decision."

Obviously we disagree on the effect playing talbot would have. Like I said, in the past when talbot comes in, and I'm not sure why, the team plays much better."
rangers,36sc4d,FlossThatSaucyBanjo,1 point,Thu May 21 23:12:30 2015 UTC,I don't think we completely do. There's risk reward for every action. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the risk involved in one of the most important games of the season.  The stage is too big for such a drastic change. I think we beat Tampa with hank in net game 4. Just my 2 cents.

rangers,36sc4d,Tsunkatse,7,Fri May 22 02:41:15 2015 UTC,":raises hand:  Not everyone thinks it's sacrilegious to pull a goalie that's gotten destroyed all year by the opposing team, and put up a stinker of a game last night.  Hank plays like shit any time the D hangs him out once or twice. Those goals aren't his fault, but then he tilts like a mad-man and plays poorly. He makes some stellar saves, but part of why they look that way is that he's out of position or coughing up juicy rebounds. Then he lets in softies.  Put in Talbot. He's good, and he's calm.  He should have gone into game 2 after the 4th goal anyway. Hank looked like shit then too, and it would have gotten Cam some reps at game speed.   but in those games the rags came out   Don't use that abbreviation."
rangers,36sc4d,Nezirsc,5,Thu May 21 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"Agree with all your points.  Likewise, I cringed when I saw rags."
rangers,36sc4d,dakraiz,2,Thu May 21 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's kind of silly that it's okay to completely bash every single player of this team but the second anyone suggests that hank should sit a game people lose their minds.   He's an amazing goalie, but he's not prone to being rattled after getting scored on a ton."
rangers,36sc4d,invrsleep,6,Fri May 22 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think we should at least consider Talbot. I know Hank is the man and will continue to be the man but I agree with what Eddie O. and some people here have been saying. Tampa has his number. Looking at his stats vs. Tampa, they're pretty awful. Maybe putting Talbot in will give this team a new look or some intangible that will help them win, we will never know.   On a side note, it kind of pisses me off how quickly this subreddit can turn against each other. Merely suggesting an unpopular opinion will result in downvotes and being called a ""fake fan"". It's okay to disagree but not to the extent some people take it to."
rangers,36sc4d,dakraiz,5,Thu May 21 19:42:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. I never downvote someone unless they are contributing nothing or being a dick. Downvote does not equal disagree. It's really dumb. It's a million times worse in /r/hockey.
rangers,36sc4d,invrsleep,2,Thu May 21 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"I can see the argument that Tampa ""has his number"" but they were one of the highest scoring teams all season, so they had everyone's number pretty much. It's up to Hank and the Rangers to make adjustments to Tampa's style of play and I think they can do that. I expected as much last game. I don't see any evidence that would suggest Talbot will fair much better against the Bolts, especially with how poorly the defense has been playing. If they step up their game that will take some pressure off of Hank and we'll see better results."

rangers,36sc4d,jedimasterchief,8,Thu May 21 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"Like okay. Let's pretend he didn't carry us from down 3-1 against the caps. Let's pretend Talbot didn't stumble towards the end of the season. Let's pretend Hank wasn't playing the best hockey of his entire career less than 5 days ago. Even then. You don't fucking bench a superstar goalie in the ECF after 2 games in which the defense was ATROCIOUS.   Anyone who watched the last two games and puts the blame on Henrik and not the defense is clueless. I'm sorry, they just are. Has he been his best the last two games? No. Has he let in a couple of soft goals? Yes. Should we bench him for a young backup against the highest octane offense in the league while our defense is getting embarrassed??????????? I wonder.  /rant"

rangers,36sc4d,MagicSeat,3,Fri May 22 03:04:24 2015 UTC,Talbot shouldn't start.  Hank should have been pulled after letting in 3 goals but that's done now and he's our guy.
rangers,36sc4d,rockabob,2,Thu May 21 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"If Hank wasn't pulled when we were down 5-2 or 6-2 then it won't happen. He should have been pulled in game 2, so he could bounce back in game 3. There is no way we play Talbot and let our season effective be in the balance with a back up. Lundqvist is starting and playing the entire game."

I had a shopping bag with a blanket in it and then a Rangerstown bag where I had headphones, deck of cards, phone charger, two books and then a bottle wrapped in a Rangers shirt.  The other stuff, as you may have surmised, was mostly for distraction. They peeked in, poked around and let me through.  I went with a seltzer bottle filled with a mixed drink concoction.

rangers,36n3zf,UndoneSic,17,Wed May 20 16:40:54 2015 UTC,Kreider and Stepan have been our two best players so he gets the advantage of that as well as being on the PP. Their play makes him look better on the statsheet but in-game you can see how much worse he is than his linemates. He better figure it on the 3rd line or he'll probably get scratched in the next 2 games
rangers,36n3zf,sizeablescars,14,Wed May 20 17:15:49 2015 UTC,Scratched?! For who? Chris Bourque? Come on now. There is no other option.
rangers,36n3zf,jwesty297,-8,Wed May 20 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, Chris Bourque, don't wanna pretend I know his skillset b/c I don't but I find it hard to believe he's not capable of stepping in. I've watched guy after guy step up the last few years like Fast, Miller, Carcillo. I'm sure Bourque can play better than MSL now although obviously he doesn't have as high a ceiling."
rangers,36n3zf,sizeablescars,8,Wed May 20 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why he hasn't been implemented. Bourque's skill set is 4th line, at best. He is a AAAA player. Fast and Miller were both high potential prospects. Carcillo was a NHL vet that knew what it took, even then he only played in 8 games. MSL may not be what he used to be but he is still a better option than CB. Not to mention that he does have 6 assists. 5 of them being Primary. I am frustrated with MSL as much as the rest.. but there is no better option."
rangers,36n3zf,jwesty297,1 point,Wed May 20 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"He had an assist in every Brass goal in the first round, I think."
rangers,36n3zf,ncolaros,1 point,Thu May 21 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"MSL had 1 point in the first round, it was a secondary assist on a Hayes goal"
rangers,36n3zf,sizeablescars,1 point,Thu May 21 01:01:11 2015 UTC,Then I guess it was the second round.
rangers,36n3zf,ncolaros,0,Thu May 21 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"I mean... I sort of wish AV would do something a little dramatic. It's not like he's just not producing (like Hags and Nash), but he's very noticeably not playing well and giving up turnovers that lead to difficult situations for the team. Nash is invisible for the most part. MSL on the other hand is very, very visible... and not in a good way."
rangers,36n3zf,neonbible47,34,Wed May 20 22:30:33 2015 UTC,Just don't re-sign him.
rangers,36n3zf,Ed_of_the_North,-11,Wed May 20 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"Great contribution!  Edit: Shower me in your downvotes, MSL haters!"
rangers,36n3zf,Ed_of_the_North,7,Wed May 20 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"Look hes a future hall of famer, has a cup his regular season numbers were pretty solid for an older guy, he hasnt been too bad this post-season, just has been failing to convert on chances.  He really just needs to retire but he seems like hes one of those guys youre going to have to force out of the NHL.  For the price-tag he comes with he is not worth it as a player.  Do you see any team that would want to trade for him?  If he re-signs for a good discount then go for it (We need to free up some cap). If not I see his salary being more fruitful spent elsewhere.  I'm sure hes going to ask for a raise like every one does, especially once we make it to the SCF  We want old marty not old man marty"
rangers,36n3zf,fondlemeLeroy,4,Wed May 20 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"I know dude, he's not a young man anymore.  I just wish people would wait until after the cup to talk about the guy -- especially after what he did for us (and how he did it) during the playoffs last year."

rangers,36n3zf,truthlesshunter,7,Wed May 20 22:53:48 2015 UTC,Same thing with Boyle.  The stats show that he's not nearly as bad as the haters rant about.  He's made some seriously solid contributions in the playoffs.
rangers,36n3zf,jm7393,0,Wed May 20 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"He's been so much better than Yandle, it's not even an argument."
rangers,36n3zf,callmesnake13,4,Thu May 21 00:14:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for MSL his age is showing just like Richies was last year, he's not a bad player but def not top 6 anymore"
rangers,36n3zf,TheSensation19,12,Wed May 20 17:27:10 2015 UTC,And now Richards is back in the finals and playing well for the Blackhawks. I think MSL is just in a slump that people are using as evidence of him being aged out. If he wants to resign at a discount for next year I'd be thrilled.
rangers,36n3zf,Chanlsrfer,3,Wed May 20 18:13:01 2015 UTC,or maybe it's because the Blackhawks are deeper than we are and Richards can play a different role that's more suited to his current skillset. And we can't forget that he's a good 5 years younger than MSL.
rangers,36n3zf,Darclite,6,Wed May 20 19:36:23 2015 UTC,Both are playing third line roles right now.
rangers,36n3zf,theygotsquid,5,Wed May 20 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"You can make the argument that Richards has better chemistry with the Blackhawks but everyone - everyone was calling him too old to produce last year. MSL has the most assists in the postseason and decent numbers all year. Yes he had one huge error on Monday, but the idea that we should bench him over Shep, or cut him, or whatever else, is shrill nonsense at this point."
rangers,36n3zf,Thugable,12,Wed May 20 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"If MSL scores a weak, trashy, deflection goal today... all the hate will go away. Typical sports fans"
rangers,36n3zf,freegucciburr,2,Wed May 20 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"You mean like contribute to the scoreboard for the first time post-season? Yeah, that may calm some of the dissent."
rangers,36n3zf,truthlesshunter,2,Thu May 21 00:23:15 2015 UTC,There is always the chance that fucking up lights a fire and makes him go on a tear. He's always been streaky and been getting more and more so in the last few years.
rangers,36n3zf,freegucciburr,1 point,Wed May 20 17:31:53 2015 UTC,I give the chance of this chance no chance.
rangers,36n3zf,adamrobertt,2,Wed May 20 22:27:45 2015 UTC,I feel like he has a soft spot for TBL. Everytime we played them this year he went from non existant to noticeable in a bad way. Its like TBL is his kryptonite.
rangers,36n3zf,theygotsquid,2,Wed May 20 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"It's odd that the Nash hate has completely turned to MSL hate, especially when Nash has looked worse this series than the previous two.   But I've said it before and I'll say it again: while Nash and MSL are easy scapegoats, our offense on the whole has really sucked. Our lightning fast speed and puck control is very inconsistent, compared with how we looked in the regular season. Tampa is an incredibly talented team but I think we match up well with them. Hopefully the shots start going in the net."
rangers,36n3zf,truthlesshunter,6,Wed May 20 19:21:24 2015 UTC,Nash has been one of our best two way forwards in the playoffs. He has 7 points for an insanely low scoring team and has been extremely reliable defensively.    How low scoring? Nash had 69 points this season while the team had 252 goals...so involved at 27.3% of our goals.     He has 7 points in 28 team goals...so 25% of our goals. Do you really think a 2.3% drop off is THAT bad in tight low-scoring playoff games while still being responsible defensively?
rangers,36n3zf,theygotsquid,3,Wed May 20 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"dude I'm totally with you, in fact I was one of the only nash defenders in the last series when there were calls for his head when we were down 3-1. However in this series, so far, he hasn't had as many chances and his finishing has lacked."
rangers,36n3zf,truthlesshunter,2,Wed May 20 20:41:30 2015 UTC,That's a really interesting way to look at it.  I'm not a Nash hater by any means but my brother has been defending him and his play to the death.  Never seen that kind of stat before.
rangers,36n3zf,theygotsquid,1 point,Wed May 20 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"I hate this analysis of Nash's offense (and I've seen it a few times).  If the Rangers only scored 1 goal total over a 4 game period (while being shut out 3 times) and the lone goal was by Nash, would you still defend his scoring? No. You'd expect him to be creating more offense overall and helping the team score more goals in total. Stop using the ""ratio"" argument as a crutch."
rangers,36n3zf,theygotsquid,1 point,Wed May 20 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"that might be the poorest counter argument i've seen.     If the system/style we play in limits our scoring (and from what we've seen in these playoffs, it has, as we've been focusing much more on the perimeter), then obviously everyone's scoring goes down. It's not a ""crutch""...it's called data and statistics. It's like saying ""we're lost the game so obviously we didn't play well"" when you know very well (assuming you watch hockey...or any sport really) that isn't the case. There's a reason fenwick, corsi, +/-, face off %, etc etc exist beyond the actual score of the game.     If a goalie has a 3.00 GAA but a 95% save percentage, would you say he's a bad goalie? of course not."
rangers,36n3zf,truthlesshunter,1 point,Wed May 20 22:42:13 2015 UTC,"OK let's try this out for size and see if this makes you understand where I'm coming from.  Team A scores 100 goals in the 2016 NHL season. Player 1 scores 50 of them (50%). Team B also scores 100 goals in the 2016 season. They trade for Player 1 in the offseason as their only personnel move.  Then, Team B scores 200 goals in the 2017 season. Player 1 scores 50 goals again (25%).   Would you say he didn't play as well in 2017 because he now figured in for less percentage of the offense with the new team? Not at all. He still scored 50 goals. The fact that he's dangerous offensively would have obviously opened up the ice for his new teammates and caused different matchups against lines of the other teams. Assuming he drives possession in the offensive zone he would have caused more offensive zone faceoffs to happen. He would have given another line on his team the opportunity to match up against 2nd pairing defensemen instead of first, etc.  This is the opposite of Nash. Nash not scoring directly contributes to the Rangers overall team not scoring. Yes, he still might account for the same percentage of offense. But the fact that he's not scoring makes everything about NY easier to defend, easier to match up against, easier to keep off the board."
rangers,36n3zf,theygotsquid,1 point,Wed May 20 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"i get where you're coming from, but that actually doesn't counter the original point.     And the counter argument to your point would be Gretzky. Gretzky scored less points when he was with the Kings after he got traded from the Oilers. Does that mean Gretzky was less of a player? Hell effin' no. He was great for the Kings but scored more with the Oilers because of that system."
rangers,36n3zf,truthlesshunter,1 point,Wed May 20 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"So if you get it, how does it not counter your point?  If Nash had 5 points in the 2 games so far to lead the team and the rangers had scored 20 goals total (giving him 25%) don't you think we'd be up 2 games to none and on our way to a sweep? Wouldn't you be praising Nash for turning it on and leading the team offensively?  Or would you just say, ""hey guys, slow down, it's the same thing he did earlier in the playoffs."""
rangers,36n3zf,BonerSupreme,1 point,Wed May 20 23:15:37 2015 UTC,Let's take it a step further as well. Nash is a goal scorer and that's what NYR pays him for. In the regular season he accounted directly for 16.7% of all NY goals scored... because he scored them.  In the playoffs that number is down to 7.1%. Less than half.  Listen I know the guy is playing great defensively but there is simply no defending his utter lack of goal scoring in playoff situations.
rangers,36n3zf,fosiacat,1 point,Wed May 20 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"i know he's a goal scorer...but point production has not dropped off. that's the main point and he's lost one of this best linemates for the last 9 games.    anywho, agree to disagree."
rangers,36n3zf,josephnicklo,2,Wed May 20 23:28:23 2015 UTC,Let's Go Rangers. If Nash has no points and we win every remaining game 2-1 I think we'll both be just as happy.

This is a new game and I'm feeling very optimistic. We are going to play like a team tonight. Hank will stand on his head. Nash and St. Louis both get on the board. If we stay disciplined we are going to take it back to them 5 on 5. All this stuff about MSL being benched is non sense. He's playing against his former team that he made a career with. He wants to put one in more than anyone to show he made the right decision coming to NYC. Show some support for all our boys and let's fuckin go tonight. LGR!!

You can buy a ticket at the box office, on StubHub. Local fans want to go to the game, but a lot of the time, as an away fan it's cheaper to buy a round trip ticket and tickets to 2 games than it would be to go to a game at home. Sure, Tampa could raise their prices, but they don't want to price out their fans (cou-MSG-gh).   This was mainly done because of the first round. There is a HUGE red wings following in Tampa, and a quarter of the arena is in red when they're in town."

rangers,36mhko,Superwasteful_sober,6,Wed May 20 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"I think the ticket rule is actually aimed at ticket brokers. During the 2011 playoffs, I met the single largest season ticket holder for the Lightning. He was a ticket broker from New York. Nice guy, but he was personally responsible for a lot of Lightning fans having to immediately turn to the secondary market.   I get that people think we don't have fans here, but that isn't it. Our fans will get priced out by people who will combine their trip with a vacation.   I went to a Blackhawks game in February with my whole family, and it was difficult to find tickets for it when we started looking for them in November. It isn't that Tampa doesn't have fans, it's that we also have lots of transplants and lots of people who will come here on vactaion for games, and will buy tickets (for regular season) way in advance because of that.  I don't blame the Hawks fans for wanting to get out of Chicago in February, but t does suck to be outnumbered in your own arena.   Besides the Lightning win, the best part of that Hawks game was that a Hawks fan who had been calling our fans ""fags"" got called out by the guy sitting next to me: ""Yeah, gay marriage is legal here. We know that's why you came down!"" The guy shut up and then tried to fight people when he left early. It was hilarious."
rangers,36mhko,fuckyouabunch,5,Wed May 20 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"After watching quite a number of teams institute a ""keep the red out"" policy, I can completely understand why you guys would put those ticket policies in place. It's pretty frustrating for teams with fan bases all over, but I get it.  As a side note, I believe gay marriage is legal in my state as well. But yeah, that guy's a douche. We all have asshole fans. Thanks for putting him in his place. Best of luck to both teams!"

rangers,36mhko,LunaticNik,-10,Wed May 20 16:16:54 2015 UTC,MSG doesnt price out fans...re sellers do. And they have the ability to do it because there is more demand than supply of tickets.  Tampa is a shitty hockey town full of fair weather fans and people who carry their fandoms from their home town.  This rule is just so they can keep the illusion that people are actually bolts fans to the businesses that spend money to have seats / boxes   The arena will be at least 50% ranger fans if it is anything like the panther games ive been to.

rangers,36mhko,Lauxman,8,Thu May 21 09:43:45 2015 UTC,"They absolutely price out their fans. Nearly all the lower bowl seats are corporate accounts.  Sure, the Lightning, and every other team in every sport have some bandwagons. If you look at attendance numbers, you'll see quite clearly that the fans have been pretty consistent.   If you spent 5 minutes googling before you typed this up, you would have come across far more intelligent.   Panthers have a terrible following due to their marketing, location, and fan experience. The only thing they have in common is the state they play in. Their arenas are 250 miles from each other."
rangers,36mhko,Lauxman,2,Wed May 20 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"And here it is, the reason why I support this rule. Keep the douchebag New Englanders away from the arena. 2011 vs the Bruins was awful with how obnoxious the Bruins away fans were, starting tons of fights with anyone they could in the parking lot."
rangers,36mhko,sizeablescars,-4,Wed May 20 19:55:03 2015 UTC,Your fan-base is 50% transplants from new england or canada (and their offspring whom may have grown up in florida) and 50% tampa white trash.  For bruins/habs/rangers/devils/leafs/hawks games your entire arena has an identity crises.
rangers,36mhko,LIGuy631,3,Wed May 20 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"So you mean like every other expansion team ever? Wow, go figure!  Your entire arena has an identity crisis between discussing the results of their 1st quarter overtime to payroll percentages and actually pretending to know what hockey is. I'll take tesla coils any day, thanks."
rangers,36mhko,LunaticNik,-5,Wed May 20 20:16:06 2015 UTC,I can see the logic but it's still embarassing and you guys would probably be better off just letting people wear their blue and red. Bettman should have not allowed the lightning to do this.
rangers,36mhko,cooljazz,4,Wed May 20 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"So you can't wear a non-Lightning jersey in certain areas of the Lightning arena (probably in areas that are on camera more than others) and you can't buy a ticket if you don't have a Florida address.    I understand wanting a home ice advantage, but isn't this a bit over the line?  It's not our fault you don't have enough home town fans to fill an arena."
rangers,36mhko,derpoftheirish,16,Wed May 20 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"you don't have enough home town fans to fill an arena.   This is what I don't understand...I used to live in Tampa and they have a HUGE fanbase there.  However, they also have a huge Rangers fanbase, and believe it or not, Montreal fanbase.  Tampa is a melting pot and a TON of people move there from NY and Canada."
rangers,36mhko,JP_Whoregan,7,Wed May 20 14:51:02 2015 UTC,2nd level behind the goal is the only place you can't wear an away jersey.

It's OK, I get it man.  I'd be pissed too if my Original 6 team was getting schooled in hockey 101 by an expansion team from 1993."
rangers,36mhko,bonesingyre,-7,Thu May 21 06:56:43 2015 UTC,"No, it's not.  Because north easterners are infamous for retiring, moving down here to Florida, and keeping their allegiances to their teams (Bruins, Yankees, Red Sox, Rangers, etc).  They want to take advantage of our generous state tax structure and our nice weather, while still supporting and backing their northern teams.  Guess what?  FUCK YOU.  I was born in Florida, raised in Florida, and I support Florida teams.  I back the Rays, the Bolts, and the Bucs.  And I'm sick and fucking tired of northern retirees moving down here, only to support their northern team allegiances.  This is not NY-South.  This is not Boston-South.  This is TAMPAY BAY.  If you wanna move into my neighborhood, then support the local teams.  If you don't, then FUCK YOU.  And I completely support the Lightning taking the first step in the ""fuck you"" to northern team support in MY TOWN.  Get lost.  Keep crying.  You get your home games, we get ours.  You don't get to get both simply because more NY and Boston degenerates exist than native Tampa Bay area people."
rangers,36mhko,juxtaposition21,2,Thu May 21 06:46:39 2015 UTC,you seem like you'd be a lot of fun at parties
rangers,36mhko,cooljazz,2,Thu May 21 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"I have mixed opinions on this, but my perspective is that of a Swedish hockey fan.    First off, limiting tickets using postal codes really seems douchey to me. Away fans should definitely be able to travel to your arena, everything else seems stupid. However, I do understand limiting the number of ""active"" fans of the visiting team. Especially if you have a smaller fan base like Tampa Bay has.    Here in Sweden/Europe, the short sides of the arenas are usually ""reserved"" for each team's fans. This isn't enforced by the organizers themselves, but usually there's a side note when you purchase tickets that says something along the lines of ""This is the cheering section of the away team"" or ""If you purchase a ticket in this section, please note that you are expected to stand on your feet and sing the entire game"" that way, the ""cheering squads"" (mostly young people) ensure that there will be energy, noise and songs that naturally favor the home team while the away fans also get to be organized but in slightly smaller numbers. The long sides are usually mixed.    It works really well and ensures that the atmosphere of rivalry match-ups is always insane, but I don't think NHL or North American sports in general really have the supporter culture to back it up. The way Tampa's doing it just seems forced and weak."
rangers,36mhko,apreche,1 point,Wed May 20 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. I'm an fan of Euro Soccer (Liverpool) so I get the whole supporters thing, but we lack that here."

rangers,36mhko,mydrumluck,1 point,Wed May 20 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"I think it is complete douche nozzlery to put these rules in place. The NHL should really step in here and condemn these actions and update their member by-laws to prohibit this behavior. They are already sport #4 (in the US) behind Baseball, Football, and Basketball, and this stupidity just gives the league a black eye."
rangers,36mhko,mollarirulz,-1,Wed May 20 14:43:04 2015 UTC,The commissioner of the league should immediately tell the team to stop this policy and fine them if they don't.   Yet another reason to boo at Bettman when the cup comes out this year. It's actually a major reason I want us to win so badly. The Kings fans did not give him the greeting he deserved last year.
rangers,36mhko,MakePie_NotWar,-1,Wed May 20 15:08:52 2015 UTC,I wonder if this arena was privately or publicly funded.   Because if it was publicly funded restricting the colors you can wear in certain sections doesn't seem ok.
rangers,36mhko,MakePie_NotWar,-2,Wed May 20 14:23:21 2015 UTC,Honestly this sounds like something that would exist in Florida.
rangers,36mhko,candidly1,7,Wed May 20 14:23:02 2015 UTC,Seahawks did it.  As did Ottawa.  Not unheard of.
rangers,36mhko,sizeablescars,0,Wed May 20 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'm split on this issue.   They just come off as the whiney kid who takes the ball and goes home because he's losing. It also seems like a REALLY bad business move and if I was a shareholder, I'd be raising hell over this. I WANT people in my stadium, even if they're the other team's fans. If we can't fill the stadium with our own fans organically, something is wrong with our team.  However, I have no problem with a company running their business the best way they see fit (that being said, I have no idea who actually decided to this). As long as they're not hurting anyone, I say go for it."
rangers,36mhko,saintinthecity,5,Wed May 20 16:30:23 2015 UTC,Its a good business move...  The majority of people in the restricted sections are in company seats (businesses buy season tickets or boxes).  These companies whom often give away this tickets as comps to clients and employees want to see that there are lightning fans at the playoff games and its not all [away team fans]  (Florida fans are notorious for keeping their allegiances to other teams).
rangers,36mhko,ANGR1ST,2,Wed May 20 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense then."
rangers,36mhko,c3h8pro,-1,Wed May 20 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter.  Half of Rangers season-ticket holders have a vacation place in Florida anyway, or know someone that does..."

Regardless of their fans though this is an absolute embarrasment to the lightning franchise. I guarantee there will be a Ranger fan holding up a sign about how he can't wear his jersey, and there will be a picture of it that will hit the front page of /r/hockey then the Lightning will look even more stupid."

rangers,36ps0d,nimperatori,11,Thu May 21 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"He was great for us last year in the playoffs. And we can't expect him to stay in his form forever, but I don't think anyone saw his downfall coming so drastically and so quickly. We can't re-sign him next year."
rangers,36ps0d,isthatyoujohnwayne_,6,Thu May 21 03:48:46 2015 UTC,He did his job last year. He took us to the SCF with 4 OT game winners. This year he suffered a knee injury and since then he hasn't been 100 percent and it's obvious. If we won the cup last year it would have been 100% worth it.
rangers,36ps0d,ESEADupes,0,Thu May 21 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"IF we won the cup, we nearly got swept, and even if St. Louis gave us that extra boost to win, he would have been gone by 2016 (or sooner) so the payoff would be winning the cup (which is obviously pretty nice) but then we would have to go out and search for a RW."
rangers,36ps0d,jedimasterchief,2,Thu May 21 03:59:40 2015 UTC,"Do I really have to explain that the Cup was a lot closer than a 4-1 series? Especially to a Rangers fan. 3 OT games, 2 of which were double OT."
rangers,36ps0d,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Thu May 21 12:49:29 2015 UTC,I know what but I just feel that we could have made a better move trading for someone else
rangers,36ps0d,jedimasterchief,9,Thu May 21 13:05:52 2015 UTC,"Its not necessarily the player swap that pisses me off, but the fucking picks.   2 first rounders. Then we go ahead and give another 1st rounder and a young developing player for Yandle, basically Boyle 2.0 who's been playing like Boyle .5. We can go on all day about the good moves, but so far MSL was a jump of the gun and Yandle, while it a bit early to make a judgement on the trade overall, is so far not the immediate upgrade we had hoped we were getting.    We had to get rid of Cally. That is a fact. We would not have had the money to pay him and keep the team somewhat intact. But we got hosed on the picks."
rangers,36ps0d,Juicecoder,3,Thu May 21 04:14:28 2015 UTC,"You are crazy if you think Yandle is Boyle 2.0 or .5 Boyle or anything like Boyle. Yandle is a skilled puck moving defenseman. He's been playing very well offensive and above average defensively. He has 6 assists. He's a good skater and a good player.   Next season I think he'll be paired with Staal and Boyle will be more sheltered. You will really see a step up in his play next season, mark my words."
rangers,36ps0d,rvbcaboose1018,1 point,Thu May 21 13:02:13 2015 UTC,Exactly. Cally got overpaid. Not sure why we had to give up 2 1st rounders for a 38 year old demanding he be traded to the Rangers.
rangers,36ps0d,owlsgohooot,1 point,Fri May 22 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"That's what I was trying to get at, I felt as if we reached for MSL and could have gotten a younger player to replace Cally. Both players have been equally as productive for their respected teams with the exception that MSL is going to burn out faster"
rangers,36ps0d,owlsgohooot,2,Thu May 21 04:18:37 2015 UTC,"The issue is, we were always gunning for MSL. He wanted out, so we were going to get him not matter what.   We could have added another player to what we wanted. Definitely lots to pick from in Tampa. But in the end, hindsight is 20/20, and they were on a Cup run just like we were. Just chalk this up to a Sather bad trade and get on with it."
rangers,36ps0d,callmejoe8,1 point,Thu May 21 04:24:21 2015 UTC,I just brought this up because St. Louis has been playing like Casper the friendly ghost and that's strictly because of age and I feel we would be better off without him
rangers,36ps0d,callmejoe8,4,Thu May 21 04:47:26 2015 UTC,"It paid off last year, and it paid off during the regular season. He's not performing now, but that doesn't mean it's not paying off."

Now that MSL is playing bad everyone is so quick to criticize the trade last year, even though he did so much in last year's playoffs.  Cally hasn't done anything crazy on Tampa either during this series so I think everyone should give the 39 year old guy some slack."
rangers,36pw5v,ChrisYaNeighbor,10,Thu May 21 04:21:41 2015 UTC,Hear me on this: Girardi was out there for 3 GA McDonagh 4. Boyle wasn't an issue tonight.

Boyle makes THREE and he's being defended... What the actual fuck is going on, I'm lost... Is this some elaborate prank that nobody has cued me in on?  EDIT: spelling  EDIT 2: and of course Mac and G were out there for 4 and 3 GA, respectively. They play 25+ minutes a game, against the fucking Triplets line. Boyle is 3RD FUCKING PAIR. He contributed to 3 FUCKING TB GOALS. How many minutes did he play? 15? 18? Holy fuck... I'm at a loss for words..."

rangers,36pw5v,The_estimator_is_in,5,Thu May 21 15:20:18 2015 UTC,Ya definitely bench the guy that ties it up for us.
rangers,36pw5v,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Thu May 21 06:14:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he only tied it at 5 because he had about 20 square feet of open net to shoot at. And we only needed to tie it because he directly contributed to at least two of Tampa's goals. Your point?"

rangers,36pw5v,isthatyoujohnwayne_,1 point,Thu May 21 04:41:50 2015 UTC,It's almost like defensive breakdowns can't always be attributed to one individual player.
rangers,36pw5v,Sochax92,3,Thu May 21 06:38:59 2015 UTC,Our entire blue line played sub par tonight. Greatest d core in the regular season amd tampa did what they wanted. The first and the last goal were on hank other then that Johnson palat and killorn played the d like a fiddle. The good that came out of tonight is that they were able to put 5 in and one late in the game. They've proved they can score with this team tonight. If they can do it again then two hank mishaps and the d taking the body a few more times in the slot and they'll be fine in game 4
rangers,36pw5v,josephnicklo,1 point,Thu May 21 06:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I bet the majority of r/Rangers agrees that Danny B has been out weakest link defensively all season and especially in the playoffs. But as others have mentioned, the problem runs way deeper than one over-the-hill defenseman. Even our top defensive pairing shat the bed tonight. Nash looks like he's playing through an injury and is afraid to drive to the net like he's done all season, preferring to lob a shot from the outside instead. MSL was god awful and single handedly brought down Hags and Dom, who were playing great. Kleiner hasn't looked the same since his injury and clearly the loss of Zucc has killed us. We were so sloppy today and pretty much our entire defense was absent. We deserved to lose that game and the fact that we made it to OT was a shocker. We, Hank included, have let in 12 goals over the past two games. The problem extends way past Boyle.   That being said, I have faith in our team and faith in AV to get to the bottom of this. As much as a liability Boyle is defensively, he does contribute to our offense which has been struggling of late (tonight was an anomaly). I don't know if benching him is the answer or not but like I said, I trust AV will make the right call. If we win the next game, we'll head back to MSG tied and I like our chances from there."

Other than that, we played alright. We were only down 3-2 at the end of the 2nd period despite all that, then the game went full clown tits in the 3rd."

rangers,36hrzk,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,4,Tue May 19 15:37:42 2015 UTC,I forget how many there were. But we can't go toe to toe with another teams power play. I think PP chances were pretty even?  Bishop looks like a psycho in net giving up big rebounds. Falling over. Miss playing the puck. Just need to sustain that pressure we brought  back  in game 1.

Besides Callahan looks good playing on Tampa next to Stamkos and the Triplets but if we were paying him 6 million a year to be a top 6 forward we would be calling for his head so the trade definitely worked out.

rangers,36kqlv,NowIRockATellerSuit,2,Wed May 20 14:42:42 2015 UTC,Go with premier. Authentic is the actual ones they wear in the game which are a lot heavier and are sized bigger for pads. The premier still has the stitched lettering and are the ones you'd generally find for sale at the arena or local modells. They run for $170.
rangers,36kqlv,MustacheCashStash22,3,Wed May 20 02:46:29 2015 UTC,"The Reebok Premiers that you get at Modells or the NHL store have a faux-stitched lettering and the letters are a sort of plastic/vinyl hybrid that crease - permanently - very easy.

rangers,36kqlv,CoMaBlaCK,2,Wed May 20 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"Lets start with the difference with the Premier and the Authentic jersey. The Premeir is a replica jersey.  This means that it is not the exact thing they wear on the ice.  It is taylored more to fit as a sweater/hoodie and not fit over equipment.  The fabric it is made of is very similar, however it does not have double bolstered shoulders and elbows. The authentic jersey, has two flavors depending on where it is purchased.  What the players wear is made in canada and made to high standards.  What shop.nhl.com sells as authentic and what they sell in the garden are made in indonesia, and made to lower standards.  Cosby's authentics are made in Canada. Authentic Canadian made jerseys are EXACTLY what is worn on the ice. Price divergence between the two is usually $150vs$300 before customization.  Now for the customization question.  Shop.NHL.COM is trash for customization of replicas and I simiply wouldn't buy an authentic from them as its not truely authentic. Cosbys uses the same double layered tackle twill for the replicas as they do the authentic.  I live in Denver now, but send my jerseys to Cosbys because they are the only shop I trust. If you have any questions please feel free to ask away."
rangers,36kqlv,flinkazoid,2,Wed May 20 15:53:35 2015 UTC,Basically cosbys jerseys are premier in the front and stitched in the back 200+tax. I've bought a bunch from them and the stitching holds up wayyy better than nameplates which eventually start to peal off

rangers,36i5tg,callmejoe8,3,Tue May 19 23:24:52 2015 UTC,He had 12 goals this year.

rangers,36i5tg,RandomassDude,12,Wed May 20 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"Earlier in the season I was hoping we would re-sign him for a one-year deal at about $2M. Now I think we might be watching the end of his career, we're better of saving that money to pay Stepan and giving one of our young guys a shot."
rangers,36i5tg,Ralph_Baconader,5,Tue May 19 16:25:10 2015 UTC,League minimum.
rangers,36i5tg,ANGR1ST,5,Tue May 19 18:14:47 2015 UTC,the dude has way too much pride to accept that sort of deal...
rangers,36i5tg,josephnicklo,3,Tue May 19 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"for how he played during regular season, 2M would be cheap. Regular season he was actually decent-good. Thank god no1 jumped to resign him."
rangers,36i5tg,nyr16,2,Tue May 19 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"True, but he was even struggling towards the end of the season, especially after the minor knee injury. This team is built to win now, playing well for the first 50 games and then dropping off does not help us at all. We will make the playoffs either way, but we need players who have enough gas left in the tank to step up in the postseason."
rangers,36i5tg,Ralph_Baconader,1 point,Tue May 19 18:43:58 2015 UTC,agreed
rangers,36i5tg,nyr16,1 point,Wed May 20 04:24:04 2015 UTC,"Dump MSL, put Zuc in his place, and Fast in Zuc's old spot."
rangers,36i5tg,callmejoe8,2,Tue May 19 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"When Zucc's healthy you have to go back to the Zucc-Brass-Nash combo, it's a big reason why Nash is a 40-goal scorer again."
rangers,36i5tg,Ralph_Baconader,1 point,Tue May 19 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"True.  Who knows, I think Fast may be able to take either spot.  He has really stepped up his game."
rangers,36i5tg,callmejoe8,12,Wed May 20 04:28:53 2015 UTC,"IMO, I think this has less to do with his age, I think this is in his head. There is a lot going on that we don't see as fans. I think the thought of having to leave the Rangers next year is scary to him, I truly believe he loves this organization and that he is comfortable here's he's thinking about how he won't be getting even close to what he got in the past and that next year is probably his last season. All I can do is speculate but I really believe he has to get out of his own head.  I really hope he pulls himself out of this funk because the look on his face after he was essentially responsible for that breakaway was heartbreaking."
rangers,36i5tg,dovakinda,3,Tue May 19 16:49:52 2015 UTC,I agree with you. He still put up 20+ goals this season at his age. We know he's in shape. Look at the shorthanded goal. He lost an edge or whatever the fuck happened to him and yet he still managed to catch up to try and make a defensive play. Look how hard he was skating on that play and tell me he physically can't keep up anymore.  He has no goals through two rounds. I think he's just trying too hard.
rangers,36i5tg,otter_pop_n_lock,1 point,Tue May 19 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. As has been said, his mind is there but the body isn't. He's got experience and he can still set up nice attempts, but he can't put anything away himself.  Not to mention, the last two series were pretty physical, and now this one is all speed. Even if his problem isn't his age, his body isn't gonna keep up like it did a couple years ago.   But his age isn't what makes him whiff shots, passes, and fall down (ok, sometimes) but I do agree that more often than not, it's just him overthinking things."
rangers,36i5tg,FirstReactionFocus,15,Tue May 19 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"I see what you're doing here, but I honestly don't think it's his age. He's been in decent position and he's getting opportunities, but he seems to just be whiffing on shots. This indicates more of a confidence problem than an age issue, but I don't play hockey so I guess I can't really evaluate the physical aspects too much."
rangers,36i5tg,penguinrockr222,5,Tue May 19 15:53:03 2015 UTC,what about falling over then panic chasing them and falling again and sliding 10 yards into your own goal causing a goal?
rangers,36i5tg,KingNickyThe1st,17,Tue May 19 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"He didn't fall again, he dove to knock the puck out of his hands. Just sayin."
rangers,36i5tg,fondlemeLeroy,10,Tue May 19 16:08:23 2015 UTC,DEFINITELY just straight up fell the first time though.
rangers,36i5tg,thataznguy34,5,Tue May 19 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sure."
rangers,36i5tg,thataznguy34,10,Tue May 19 16:28:20 2015 UTC,You know what his play has shown me? That he still has really good hockey IQ but his body can't keep up with his brain anymore. On that pass he wanted to catch it with his skates and deflect it to his stick but the foot speed just wasn't there. He wouldn't have even come close to catching Johnson if Boyle hadn't pushed him forward with his stick. I mean last night was the 96th game off the season (technically) and a 25 year old would still be worn down. A 40 year old who relies on his speed because he's tiny isn't gonna cut it anymore.
rangers,36i5tg,Ralph_Baconader,7,Tue May 19 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"he still has really good hockey IQ but his body can't keep up with his brain anymore   I can't upvote this enough, everything I've seen leads me to believe this is his main problem. He still sees and reads plays the same way he always has, which is exceptionally well. His body just isn't fast/strong enough to make the plays that he would have in his prime. He's still trying to do all the same things, but he's sadly physically incapable of doing them anymore, so he gets himself into trouble more often than not."
rangers,36i5tg,ANGR1ST,5,Tue May 19 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"Know how every once in a while in a men's league game you and your teammates make a couple of nice plays/passes and score, and it looks like you actually know what you're doing?  MSL looked like a men's league player usually looks on that sequence."
rangers,36i5tg,Rocketman_man,2,Tue May 19 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"I had exactly one game like that. It will always be ""that game"" and I will always remember it. It was a holiday weekend or something and like half our team showed up. We had 3 subs the whole game. I think the insane amounts of ice time everybody got just put us all in a zone where we didn't have time or energy to think. We just played. And holy fuck it's as if we just manufactured a modicum of talent out of thin air."
rangers,36i5tg,mpflug7,1 point,Tue May 19 19:25:04 2015 UTC,Is there a link to this? I missed the first half of the game because I was at a graduation

rangers,36i5tg,NjJoe,-1,Tue May 19 17:44:33 2015 UTC,What was the point of saying that we all saw the game the other night
rangers,36i5tg,piratetone,8,Tue May 19 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"Alright - time to go against the hivemind to step up for Mr. Marty.  Let me preface this with - yes, last night's game was atrocious for him and yes he is missing out on most opportunities that come his way in the playoffs.  Now, is he a total dud? Is his career over? The stats say otherwise. The dude ended the regular season with a higher point total and a higher average point per game than clutch players like Matty Zucc and Chris Kreider.. He also had the second highest average time on ice for a forward - meaning Vigneault has recognized his stellar play throughout the year.  So his playoff numbers need a lot to be desired, but even after last night's embarrassment - through 14 games, he's still a +1 in his +/- rating while Dan Boyle is currently at a -3. (Boyle I think is having a much tougher post season than Marty - I panic when he's on the ice).  He is not worthy of being scratched and to think they're better off replacing him with an AHL prospect is ludicrous."
rangers,36i5tg,dovakinda,3,Tue May 19 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this.He is a future hall of famer, he isn't going anywhere.   Sorry you are being downvoted for actually having an opinion. This fan base is better than that."
rangers,36i5tg,EarnSquirm,2,Tue May 19 22:02:27 2015 UTC,"MSL's game has dropped off a lot. His numbers from early on in the season were good, but over-reflective of his overall season. At age 40 he might not have the stamina he used to... 18-26-44 points / his first 58 games this season (0.76 pts/game) 3-11-14 / points his last 30 games this season/postseason (0.47 pts/game)"
rangers,36i5tg,OCDHost,1 point,Tue May 19 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with you mostly, however, I really think they need to drop him to the 3rd line and take him off the PP."
rangers,36i5tg,piratetone,1 point,Wed May 20 16:20:04 2015 UTC,He was dropped to the 3rd line in game 2. I think he still has use on the power play just not as its QB.
rangers,36i5tg,OCDHost,1 point,Wed May 20 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"Shit, I missed a lot of game 2 so I must have missed that."
rangers,36i5tg,MakeItNashty61,3,Wed May 20 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's his age really, I just think he's not as sharp and confident in himself as he was last year. Last night aside, (the mistake falling down which I think Boyle should be blamed for on that pass, and the other missed chances) we have seen St. Louis just flat out miss on blatant chances in front of the net. Every game it seems like he's alone in front of the net, or in a position to try and snipe a shot on the PP and he can't convert. Idk if that is because he is old, I just think he is in his own head right now and he HAS to be put on another line and taken off the PP. The 2 assists he had do not out weight the constant mistakes."
rangers,36i5tg,vertigounconscious,3,Tue May 19 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, and Richard McLaren Nash is starting to show his age too AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF 30."
rangers,36i5tg,cooljazz,3,Tue May 19 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"He looks done. However, I think he looks like that because right now he has ZERO confidence. It's amazing how much your mind/mindset can affect you physically."

rangers,36i5tg,2min4cc,3,Wed May 20 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"Sad to watch really.  as a Bolts fan from before St Louis..... Even before he asked out..... we were all like "" Get him off the PP point"" he's killing us there....   cant keep pucks in and gives up turnovers....."
rangers,36i5tg,MakePie_NotWar,4,Tue May 19 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if we had anyone that could take his spot, I'd fully support benching him. As you said, I think his body is just physically done and, unfortunately, it's costing us."
rangers,36i5tg,RhynoSorceress,4,Tue May 19 16:32:51 2015 UTC,Sather better not entertain the idea of bringing him back next season. Absolutely worthless out there. May as well have a kid out there getting some valuable experience instead of Marty falling down and turning the puck over constantly.
rangers,36i5tg,SP821,5,Tue May 19 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"A rare misfire for Sather when it comes to trades. He's had 1 or 2 big goals as a Ranger. It's pathetic watching him slowly glide around the rink and turn it over on nearly every possession. Really starting to fear that the St louis & Yandle trades are going to blow up in our faces and hurt our chances.   There's no one who would rather have St Louis & Yandle over Callahan, Moore, Duclair, and 3 1st-round picks."
rangers,36i5tg,mangowarfare,7,Tue May 19 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Callahan wanted money that we can use to keep Steps, Kreider, and Zucc. You're right about not wanting those two over Cally, Moore, Duclair and the picks. But if the deal is MSL, Yandle, Krieder, Zucc, Steps for those guys? Way more reasonable."
rangers,36i5tg,SP821,3,Tue May 19 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"I had no issue letting Callahan walk after last season, he wasn't getting 6M per year. Giving up 2 1st-Rd picks is what will hurt us more in that deal"
rangers,36i5tg,rdmorley,3,Tue May 19 19:44:02 2015 UTC,Potentially.  Also look at Rangers first round picks in the past....they're horrible.  NY isn't a place where you necessarily need first rounders because we can snag them from other franchises down the line.  Just playing a bit of devil's advocate
rangers,36i5tg,Franz_Kafka,2,Tue May 19 23:50:52 2015 UTC,As much as a storyline it's been I seriously don't see us going to the finals last year without Marty and that makes it worth it. But yeah Yandle hasn't been worth it and we need it to be worth it now.
rangers,36i5tg,nyr16,2,Wed May 20 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"Ive been bashing him this entire playoffs. Horrible, I think he fears reinjuring his knee at this age. Either ways, I dont want to say its been like this all season, he was pretty decent in the regular season (not that it matter). We really need to figure out a way to reduce his presence on the ice. The fact that he continued on the PP after that give away was mindblowing and infuriating."
rangers,36i5tg,EarnSquirm,2,Tue May 19 18:38:48 2015 UTC,It's definitely his mind not his body. He didn't have a GREAT season but our whole squad played consistent. That's how you win a presidents trophy is with consistency. It's in his head now and it's starting to become extremely noticeable.   A body isn't going to degrade to the point where he can't catch a pass on the blue line with no immediate pressure in a week. Long term age needs to be considered and if we can get a younger guy to fill his shoes that would be the plan for any guy over 35 on an nhl roster. But he didn't go from playing consistent a few weeks ago to this because of his body.
rangers,36i5tg,nimperatori,2,Tue May 19 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"MSL turns 40 in a few weeks. It's unfortunate, but his age is indisputably showing. I don't think he's played poorly enough to warrant be scratched for Oscar Lindberg, but I can't justify keeping him on the 1st PP unit any longer. At this point I'd put him on the 3rd line, giving him sheltered even-strength minutes, and go with just about any other forward on PP's.   It's a shame, especially since a year ago he was the heart and soul of the Rangers postseason... but hockey players can fall off quite quickly at age 40. Don't see him being re-signed, unless he agrees to a 1-yr $600,000 deal or something.  Please let him win the Cup and retire on top this summer. I don't think this is 'just a rut' or 'in his head', he's aging out of pro sports. Just like every other NHL player since the beginning of time."
rangers,36i5tg,parallacks,2,Tue May 19 21:26:39 2015 UTC,I just want Cally back. Bonehead trade in the first place
rangers,36i5tg,airgyros,1 point,Wed May 20 03:31:38 2015 UTC,Also we don't know how injured he might be playing (if we assume that all players at this point in the season are playing hurt at some level).  Younger players get the benefit of the doubt.  Older players are just given up on as being done.
rangers,36i5tg,candidly1,1 point,Tue May 19 18:49:54 2015 UTC,I think he's still hurt. Hasn't been the same since the sprain and we all know a close to 40 year old body doesn't heal quite the same as it used to.
rangers,36i5tg,mexicaaaan,1 point,Wed May 20 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"Falling at the blue line last night was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  He's gotta sit now.  He has become a liability.  He used to have some of the best hands in the business; now he squanders great chances.  I don't know who should get all of his minutes, but he has to sit."
rangers,36i5tg,fiddle_me_timbers,-5,Tue May 19 20:04:00 2015 UTC,So do you feel better now that you got it out on the internet?
rangers,36i5tg,mexicaaaan,1 point,Tue May 19 18:49:43 2015 UTC,Umm. What is this sub for if not discussion about the team?
rangers,36i5tg,fiddle_me_timbers,0,Wed May 20 14:22:20 2015 UTC,right - because I expressed a problem with discussing hockey as opposed to his negative attitude
rangers,36i5tg,mexicaaaan,1 point,Wed May 20 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"It is his opinion and this is an open forum in which he is free to discuss it with other fans. If you disagree, then you should offer your own opinion instead of responding with a snarky comment."
rangers,36l2t0,andrewanthem,8,Wed May 20 04:26:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right to me.   There's always an ebb and flow to things. In a game that's going on long and still early in the series, not surprising for things to be lower key, and ramping up just for moments like sustained offensive shifts, big plays, etc.  Also MSG has always come off as one of the quieter arenas in general, to me anyway."
rangers,36l2t0,commy,2,Wed May 20 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially compared to other arenas durring the playoffs.   Don't know if its how the arena is miced, or if its the ticket prices preventing the rowdier crowd from going, but its definitely quiet comparatively."
rangers,36l2t0,MagicSeat,2,Wed May 20 14:27:57 2015 UTC,Too many suits who got their tickets from their companies. These people are not real die hard Rangers/hockey fans.

rangers,36l2t0,Shaman-d,3,Wed May 20 05:36:05 2015 UTC,I remember reading something about NBC using equipment that significantly drowned out the noise of the crowd so that you could hear the mic's on the ice and the announcers better.

rangers,36igl5,MakeItNashty61,3,Tue May 19 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"And with all that, it was a winnable game going into the third.   This team has alway bounced back well. Too many heady players and a great coach who makes smart adjustments. Game 3 will look a lot different."
rangers,36igl5,whiskey_smash,3,Tue May 19 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno why anyone would be worried. It really was just one terrible period. If Marty and Staal don't slip on banana peels in open ice, we're ahead 2-1 going into the 3rd. No doubt we got our shit handed to us in the 3rd, but if anything that'll serve as motivation for us to come out guns blazing to start Game 3. Main thing is staying out of the box unless absolutely necessary. Rangers are the better team 5-on-5 but Tampa's power play can be the difference maker for them."
rangers,36igl5,boxtowire,2,Tue May 19 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"The first period was some of the worst playoff hockey I have ever watched, from both squads.  Just mashing at each other in the neutral zone until the puck squirted somewhere.  But, nonetheless, a couple key saves from Bishop kept the Rangers from getting back in it and TBL was able to capitalize on chances.  I'm not worried.  Terrible game.  Lundy will come out angry and probably be off his rocker.  The team has the composure, we've seen that already.  They'll come ready to play Wednesday.  Rangers in 6."
rangers,36igl5,gigglyweeds,2,Tue May 19 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"The silver lining is that both teams were horrible that game, and Tampa just got the bounces. Simple as that. Anyone who is looking at the score to make a judgement didn't watch the whole game."

I never once was worried about Pittsburgh, and even when we went down 3-1 to the Caps, I still had confidence we could win. But this Tampa Bay team is no joke. And they're better than the teams we've beaten to get here (we're certainly better than the teams they beat)."
rangers,36igl5,Techngro,2,Wed May 20 05:09:33 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. My main concern is their serious scoring drought. I mean, maybe it's just me, but they will need to do better offensively against a team like Anaheim if they want to win the cup. I know it is the playoffs and all the teams are playing to their best ability, but we can't rely on only scoring 2-3 goals per game."
rangers,36igl5,jdietrich26,4,Tue May 19 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"We never score in the playoffs, I cannot explain why maybe it's Nash, maybe it's the system we just don't do it. I have given up worrying about that lol."
rangers,36igl5,grc_tv,1 point,Tue May 19 20:23:47 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty OK with how that game went honestly. We played terrible, awful, completely ass, sure. But I believe if Hank played normal / just as well as normal we could have even won. If not that we would have a much more even (3-2/4-2) scoreline, and with how terribly we played, that is a pretty good score.  Does this make any sense?"
rangers,36igl5,xxdarksyde73xx,1 point,Tue May 19 22:37:53 2015 UTC,I really didn't think Boyle looked too bad last night TBH but MSL should be moved to 4th line if not scratched
rangers,36igl5,Techngro,1 point,Tue May 19 23:14:24 2015 UTC,"I am actually relieved that they had one of these horrendous type games early in the series. Get it out of the system. Rather have it in game 2 than game 6 or 7.    Also, I think this will have guys so mad at themselves for playing this badly that they will be more focused from here on out. I can only hope that a really bad game like this wakes everyone on the team up.    And a word about St. Louis. I was watching him especially closely during these last two games and he just plays so fucking hard. I can see it in the way he skates and the way he shoots. He clearly is over matched with the pace of the game that these two teams set. But I still think he can be useful on the power play."
rangers,36igl5,m4tuna,1 point,Wed May 20 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a sloppy game all around. From both teams down to the refs. Pretty sloppy playoff hockey.   EDIT: Actually, the goalies had good games."
rangers,36igl5,TheGreatBrassby,1 point,Wed May 20 17:42:08 2015 UTC,Henrik made one bad mistake out of net that I thought was bad but unusual
rangers,36igl5,eatmyputin,1 point,Wed May 20 18:03:19 2015 UTC,I think we should really tinker with the lines. And Boyle and MSL should never ever ever be on the power play at the same or really be on the ice at all at the same time. Ever.
rangers,36igl5,gigglyweeds,0,Tue May 19 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"My biggest fears are the follow: 1) The Pens (which the Rangers beat only by 4, 1 goal games) and the Caps, which were up 3-1 and it took 7 games to beat are not very good teams.  Pens had everyone hurt.  Caps, barely beat an injured Isles team. 2)  Bolts are a very good/great team.  The Rangers beat them pretty easily in game 1 but game 2 is the true indication of the matchup.  They forced the Rangers into these mistakes and the Rangers do not have much hope to win the series."
rangers,36igl5,Carzo,9,Tue May 19 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree with your assessment of the Caps.  If they won our series, I would have put them up there with a good chance to win it all."
rangers,36igl5,gigglyweeds,5,Tue May 19 17:50:27 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Holtby was playing out of his mind. He could've carried that team to a cup himself.
rangers,36igl5,eatmyputin,2,Tue May 19 17:58:57 2015 UTC,Good puck possession team with a goalie playing off his rocker....sounds vaguely familiar.
rangers,36igl5,gigglyweeds,2,Tue May 19 18:26:38 2015 UTC,Yeah the Caps were pretty much at full strength. They are not as deep scoring wise but their defense is pretty damn good. Not to mention Holtby was playing just as well as Bishop. Can't agree that the quality of our last opponents effects anything.
rangers,36igl5,eatmyputin,2,Tue May 19 20:26:35 2015 UTC,I hope you're right.
rangers,36igl5,gigglyweeds,2,Tue May 19 17:59:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure who is downvoting your posts, I'm not.  But the Caps, really good puck possession and a goalie playing off his rocker.  That should remind you of somebody: the Kings.  I think it was the ability of our defense to shut down Ovi and our incredible PK that won us that series honestly.    I mean, imagine.  If our PP can score on TBL, think about how the Caps would have dismantled it.  I also don't think TBL would have matched well at all with the Ovi line, then the Killer Bs, and then Kusnetsov.  When you get down to it, the Caps were really good.  We just eeked out of that series."
rangers,36igl5,Techngro,2,Tue May 19 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"No worries on the down votes but thanks for your concern.    Holtby was bananas last series and really, the only reason the series wasn't shorter.  That said, 3-1 with 1:40 left...that was scary.  But that's playoff hockey right?    So you aren't afraid of the getting blown out this series?  Rangers cannot continue to win 2-1.  They need to score more."
rangers,36igl5,eatmyputin,1 point,Wed May 20 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"No, I think we can actually continue to win by one goal.  Playoff hockey is tight, blow outs are aberrations.  I would love if the offense woke up more, but I thikn we need Zucc back for that.  So, we'll rely on our defense and goal tending.  I think experience will end up winning out this series.  Especially if we can take this game tonight and get in their heads."
rangers,36igl5,Techngro,1 point,Wed May 20 18:45:11 2015 UTC,"Caps were a solid team in my opinion. A step below Tampa, but still capable of winning that series with the Rangers. They would have taken any of the top teams in the east to 7 games I think.    As for the Pens. Yeah.    Rangers have plenty of hope. Because when his defense doesn't leave him out to dry by making silly mistakes, Lundqvist gives them a chance to win every night. And you're not going to get too many games where his defense leaves him out to dry."
rangers,36igl5,eatmyputin,2,Wed May 20 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"Hank had his one bad game.  They did lose, what 7-4 to the Habs last year in game 5.  Then Rangers won game 6 1-0.  I'm a pessimist.  Down vote that."
rangers,36igl5,Techngro,1 point,Wed May 20 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't down vote you but I understand why other people did. Saying the Rangers have no hope after two games is kinda...well, kinda silly.    But I would say that the Rangers definitely don't have the luxury of thinking that they could fall behind 3-1 like they did last year against the Pens and this year against the Caps. The Caps were good, but this Tampa Bay team is a different story."

rangers,36j4n7,Ahkahseekapoo,1 point,Wed May 20 01:40:44 2015 UTC,Logic and reason?? BUT THIS IS PLAYOFF HOCKEY!!!!!
rangers,36j4n7,ball_out,12,Wed May 20 03:13:00 2015 UTC,Honestly you have three choices:  1) Shave that shit. C'mon man look presentable. This is a very good opportunity for you to get back out in the working world. Make money and be an adult. This team is just a hobby. There is no way your beard is the be all end all even in the most perplexing butterfly effect way. Get some cash in those pockets and some respect from your other working peers. This team will always be here but a chance at a good job will not.   2) Keep it for the team but make it look presentable. The rugged look is in my friend but being a neckbeard is not. Trim any unsightly hairs get rid of that patchy shit on your neck. Go out there and nail that interview (and possibly interviewer who knows anything can happen when you're looking like a sexy bearded man right?)  3) FUCK shaving. You bleed blue. This team is your life. You think of the shine on Messier's head and you get harder than a diamond taking an advanced engineering final. They ask what's with that shitty beard and you say that you're the type of person who goes all in or nothing with everything they do.  INCLUDING this job. They'll respect you and make you CEO right then and there. Bonus points you didn't ruin the rangers playoff run. Wait I'm sorry YOUR playoff run.   Take a pick and enjoy.
rangers,36j4n7,isthatyoujohnwayne_,2,Tue May 19 20:54:41 2015 UTC,Look them dead in the eyes and rub your beard....to assert your dominance.

rangers,36j4n7,NjJoe,2,Tue May 19 20:51:48 2015 UTC,"I shave my beard after every Rangers loss.  That way, I can blame the beard for when we lose and feel like it works when we win."

rangers,36j4n7,unreal_zen,2,Wed May 20 06:20:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think you'll be penalized for having a beard.  99% of all interviews I've conducted for my company I've started off with small talk. The candidate's resume already tells me about their skills and I really like to make sure they have a pulse before bringing anyone on.   You could easily lead with being a Blueshirts fan and bring the beard up in casual conversation prior to the official interview. You'll likely have opportunities while you're escorted to the room they're conducting interview so clear the elephant in the room and nail the interview.  Just presenting an alternate perspective - best of luck!"

FullMoonJerseys is the seller. I bought a Callahan jersey for $40. I know he's no longer on the team (and even playing for the enemy now...), but $40 for a real jersey is a fucking sweet deal."
rangers,36j494,thehockeychimp,1 point,Wed May 20 00:17:07 2015 UTC,Are they real?
rangers,36j494,Nezirsc,2,Wed May 20 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"Now, mind you, if you aren't familiar with Reebok Premier jerseys (replicas, ~$170 from most retailers - including shop.NHL.com) versus Edge 2.0 jerseys (the very same jerseys that the players wear, ~$300 from most retailers), then it would be worth your while to research the differences. To the best of my understanding, the Premier replica jerseys resemble the player's jerseys in almost every aspect, but are not made from the same kind of material. Also, some logos may be ""screenprinted"", rather than actually stitched. Basically, the Premier is for the fan who wants to show their colors, and the Edge 2.0 is for the fan who actually wants to wear their jersey when they go play hockey themselves (more durable)."
rangers,36j494,Nezirsc,1 point,Wed May 20 00:33:26 2015 UTC,"(authentic Reebok Premier jerseys)  $40 for a real jersey is a fucking sweet deal   I wouldn't have emphasized it twice if they weren't, lol. Just make sure that the jersey you are looking at is advertised as ""Reebok Premier"". I got mine in the mail during game 7 against the Caps. It's the real deal, and I'm incredibly stoked about that price."
rangers,36j494,Nezirsc,1 point,Wed May 20 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"As for my Callahan jersey, the red part of the ""RANGERS"" font is most definitely a stitching. There is tangible threading making up each letter. However, the white backing that the red stitching is attached to is adhered onto the blue fabric, rather than stitched into place. The captain's ""C"" is a flat screenprinting on what I imagine is vinyl adhered onto the blue fabric.  The Edge 2.0 would probably be truly stitched across the board, but you'd be paying ~$300 for it.  Great jersey, and I'm incredibly happy with it.  Edit: I guess I should mention the nameplate / numbers as well. The name on the back and numbers are all screenprinted, BUT they are actually stitched into the fabric of the jersey, rather than adhered on like the letters on front."

rangers,36g34e,Super_Sic58,8,Tue May 19 10:09:51 2015 UTC,"This, plus this year we need to resign Step, Hags and Kreider.  Marty's contract coming off the books allows that.  Plus, without Marty, chances are we wouldn't have gotten as far as we did last year."
rangers,36g34e,Grgy,3,Tue May 19 13:17:41 2015 UTC,Marty was fantastic during the tail end of last season. I guess we just thought we'd get another good year after that.

rangers,36g34e,FLRangerFan,33,Tue May 19 15:02:33 2015 UTC,Difference in the game: finishing chances. Rangers have sucked at it all playoffs and it really caught up to them tonight. Lightning left basically one great scoring chance out on the ice and finished the rest. Rangers left about 5. That's how you get blownout and thats how you lose important games.

You don't look at the score and say ""oh shit it's 7-0 we just absolutely got smoked."" We had a bad twenty minutes...an awful twenty minutes...and that needs to be rectified.   Bolts really didn't walk all over us tonight. Bunch of chaotic plays that went their way, this game could have been 8-2 Bolts or 7-4 Rangers or 5-5 going into OT right now. We need to calm down a bit. Things aren't going to go that well for them if they put up that kind of performance in the upcoming games."
rangers,36g34e,KwanzaaSanta,9,Tue May 19 03:02:12 2015 UTC,Exactly.   100% props to Tampa for finishing but we fucking killed ourselves tonight.   Marty and Staal = 2 goals.   3 power play goals and (I'm pretty sure) the 4th was like 10 seconds after their power play ended.   Fucking Jesus.

MSL looked pretty bad. Nash with 3 points in his last 10 games.

On the radio after the first period Brass said the game had a late start so they had to find their legs... That's not a good reason at all.  In an earlier interview I heard Torts say MSL would thrive under pressure with the spotlight on him, as that's been a motivator throughout his entire career. I wanted to believe, but I just can't any more.   I'm confident the Rangers will bounce back from this. Nothing fires up the King more than getting lit up.   Let's go Rangers!"
rangers,36g34e,pejede,3,Tue May 19 03:10:32 2015 UTC,Not all bad.   According to the post game -   Brassard is only the 2nd Ranger to record 10+ points in each of 3 straight postseasons. The first? Mark Messier.   He and Stepan are proving to be really clutch players.

Lose by 1 or by 10, a loss is a loss. Take this for what it is, an anomaly. Not worried about Hank.   WAY too many penalties. No reason for it. Most importantly, tonight and game 1 showed that they absolutely, positively CANNOT skate with us. Push the pace, control the flow of the game, make them keep up. They turn the puck over, they're out of position and Bishop gives up rebounds, all of which lead to dirty goals. We had about 100 near misses in game 1, but we were controlling the pace so it was ok. Our near misses tonight were much more costly because they controlled the pace.    Take this one on the chin and play game 3 like we did game 1."

We had the chances, but ultimately the bad penalties and defensive collapses are the reason we lost. That, and MSL. Hank wasn't his sharpest, but it is hard to blame him here.

Hopefully this will be one of only 1, 2, or 3.  2) The refs were bad on both sides. Called everything in the first and nothing in the second. We got away with some too. Don't want to hear that they cost us a victory.  3) Enough of MSL on the power play.   4) We killed ourselves with a lot of bad plays, especially on defense (although Hank was bad tonight too). With that said, the game was within reach at the start of the third. I really thought we were going to pull it off.   If we just DON'T PLAY STUPID, we totally outplay them and I think we got frazzled early tonight and let the bad breaks early get into our heads. I think straight up we're the better team and playing disciplined will lead to very good things in the future. Holtby I thought looked better than Bishop has so far."

rangers,36g34e,josephnicklo,2,Tue May 19 13:14:40 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of breaking up Nash and Brass. Their chemistry has seemed off the first two games of this series. I think Step's game has the potential to wake up Nash a bit, and it could also let Brass stickhandle through the middle more with Miller and Hayes working their size along the boards. I also like the idea of Step moving into the zone with Kreider and Nash, as the two of them will be able to drive harder to the net to set up some quality screens on Bishop, which is really we really need to beat him. Shots from Yandle/Boyle, McDonagh, and Klein I think will be much more effective with this line, with those three big forwards looking for big rebounds."

rangers,36g34e,josephnicklo,1 point,Tue May 19 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"Owch...  I knew the Bolts would come back after Game 1, but damn, that was pretty bad. The frustrating thing is that, I didn't even feel like we played terribly (I would make the argument that Game 4 against the Caps wasn't great + there were plenty of times the Caps had us trapped in our zone far worse than what happened tonight), however, the quality of chances/rushes we gave the Bolts were TERRIBLE. Seriously, it was just rush after rush. I also said this last time, but we have to be incredibly careful with giving them a PP. Some had mentioned it ""ran dry"" when they were up against the Wings, but I think it's becoming more apparent that the the Wings were just so much more defensively sound on the PK compared to the Habs and what we've been so far :/. I'm starting to question if we should commit to blocking the shots all the time now, too. I think it worked against the Caps since their style seemed to focus more on feeding the puck to Ovi for a one timer...but Tampa...fuck. They move it around so well and I think they're taking advantage of open lanes when we go down (eg. that one goal right when the Bolts' PP expired; off a faked shot).   I also think we'll have to be extremely careful when we're at the blue line. Oddly enough, I feel like a lot of their chances were generated the same way we make ours (force the puck out of the zone past the blue liners or wait for our guys to pinch in). Poor Hank, though. On Tampa's last rush (Boyler made the shot) you could tell he was really angry. There was no traffic or anyone really in his crease, so I can only imagine he was upset with our guys for letting that chance even happen...  But as I mentioned, I don't think we played absolutely terrible. The fourth line, especially D. Moore and Glass, had really great games tonight (Glass was really a huge surprise -- caused a few turnovers that led to some solid chances + had a couple of blocked shots). It was great to see us convert on the PP twice, too. The latter part of the second period looked quite good, but it's unfortunate that things just really fell apart once it went up to 4-2. But I think because we showed flashes of decent play, it sort of offsets how upset I am about the loss, I guess. And if there is any silver lining in this, it's that at least we know what Tampa is capable of a little more now and hopefully we'll make adjustments accordingly.   P.S. Even if Boyler isn't on our team anymore...man. I'm really curious to know what's up with him because he looked absolutely ghastly; like his soul was sucked out or something :/."

rangers,36dbqp,irishguy42,2,Mon May 18 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"I wonder how this will eventually affect lines. Third line has been clicking, and showed good promise in G1. Speed is just what MSL needs, honestly. Pairing him with Hagelin and a solid center like Dom is exactly what he needed.  I figure Zucc will go back to the first line, and I hope Fast stays on the second line.  But I see us going back to the lines we had pre-Zucc-injury."
rangers,36dbqp,nyr16,1 point,Mon May 18 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"Hayes finally producing on 1st line is a big deal, might be optimal to keep him there. I think zucc is more versatile and will improve any line he comes back to. Maybe:  61-16-13  20-21-36  62-28-19  15-10-26  Fast and Marty being interchangeable, but based on quality of play. Fourth line looking a bit weak though, mainly in size."
rangers,36dbqp,gigglyweeds,0,Mon May 18 15:03:41 2015 UTC,"MSL on the fourth Line?  Are you mad?  Why would you even break up Hags / Moore / MSL when that line was brilliant the other night?  MSL is not a player you want in for fourth line scenarios, ever."
rangers,36dbqp,nyr16,1 point,Mon May 18 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"As I said, Marty and Fast are interchangeable in that scenario. I personally believe Fast has played better than Marty in the playoffs so far, and is far more defensively disciplined. Not to sure what you are getting at, MSL had a disgustingly pitiful game on saturday. Just because D.moore tore up on his own, with some avg play for hagelin, that line wouldn't have been shit without moore."
rangers,36dbqp,gigglyweeds,1 point,Mon May 18 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"MSL doesn't play the style you need for our fourth line.  This isn't the Torts era of just demote people.  Our fourth line serves a purpose.  MSL does not suit that purpose.  He played well Saturday with Moore and Hags.  The cycle on that line was dangerous.  If you didn't notice, I don't know what game you were watching."
rangers,36dbqp,nyr16,1 point,Mon May 18 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, I somewhat agree that simply demoting him to 4th line will not solve the issue of his pitiful play. And yes it was disgustingly bad, where he turned over a puck or 2 that lead to either goal scoring chances or near goal scoring chances, and haglin didnt have a pretty game either. That line was heavily, heavily carried by moore. So then the only alteration to the lines would be to swap fast and msl. And yes MSL has played so bad that it warrants 3rd and 4th line minutes."
rangers,36dbqp,gigglyweeds,2,Mon May 18 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"AV rolls 4 lines, so you still need a competent fourth line to do its job:  Grind.  MSL can't grind, he would ruin any effectiveness the fourth line could have.  Torts could give a guy ""fourth line minutes"" because he didn't really have a purpose for the fourth line.  AV definitely does.  I still disagree with your assertion about that line playing terribly. I was actually really excited about MSL / Moore / Hags.  Especially they're cycle game.  But we'll see tonight I guess."
rangers,36dbqp,nyr16,1 point,Mon May 18 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"This is no offense to you, but need I say more? FUcking loser MSL, cant tip a shot on net, and another great giveaway allowing a goal."

rangers,36fazg,artvandelay1994,19,Tue May 19 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"Alright now let me try and break down what I've noticed here:  They are running away with this game because of turnovers and us taking too many penalties. All the goals they scored have been the result of these two things.  Goal 1 - Marty has perhaps the worst turnover I've ever seen on a 5-on-3 advantage that leads to them going up 1-0. Then we tie it up.  Goal 2 - Both of us take some penalties, Tyler Johnson scores again to put them up 2-1. They had a PP here 4-on-3.  Goal 3 - Another turnover (by Staal) leads to an odd man rush on the net. Too much activity here causes Johnson to get his hat trick. Then we score on the PP from Stepan - odd play involving Bishop leaving the crease.  Goal 4 - This goal really pissed me off because I feel like Lundqvist could have been in better position to stop it. That or our defense could have had a man on Killorn. Not to mention we JUST had a PK and then let this shit happen.  Goal 5 - Deflection off Stamkos. Another PP goal for them.   So looking back at all 5 of these, 2 are on the PP, 2 are created directly off turnovers, and 1 was just a shit play altogether where Lundqvist was completely on the other side of the net and our defense wasn't on Killorn.  Why am I posting this? Idk I've been drinking and dealing with trash talk on twitter (not my finest move there) but I just want to point out that we still GOT THIS SHIT!  So what it's a 1-1 series tie? We knew we weren't gonna roll by this team. We knew this was gonna be tough and we would have to be on our A game. Tonight we simply weren't. The whole team got beat hard tonight. No big deal.  We go into game 3, fix the mistakes we had this game, and beat em like we did in game 1.  LGR"

(MSL - 52, Cally - 54).   The motive for our trade was to get rid of a malcontent that was holding the team financially hostage.   If we lose Cally, but are able to retain Zucc, Stepan, Kreider - the trade is a no-brainer. Whether or not we keep MSL is irrelevant."

Old/Slow/Timing is off, whatever, I don't know what he brings to the locker room. I can't even pretend to think I know what goes on based on  30 second clip of them yelling nicknames at each other.     Yes, I have seen him make bone-headed plays.  Last night happened to suck the life out of everything - He knows that - He also got an assist with the tying goal - and people booed his name when they announced it!    What they didn't see was the massive back check he had.  It didnt work - but he was moving - even caught the guy - He didnt give up. Guys like him don't.  He is smart. He has been around this league for a long time.  This very league that told him he wasn't even good enough to play in.    I think it is easy to pick on St .Louis because of his age - hell, I used to call Jager ""Old Fat Ass"" as I watched him hang above our own defensive blue line.  Look at him now.     Guys like that know how to play the game at any level their mind and body is at.   Did anyone ever think that St. Louis seems to stand out (poorly) the most when the Rangers are losing?  Everytime I see him and grumble his name I take a step back and look at what is actually happening. He seems to stick out because he is actually WORKING and GRINDING AND GENERATING, granted it does not always work out, but that is what leaders do. They motivate.    Sometimes you have to be the shiny turd. Let everyone else see that there are other turds laying around."

rangers,36f7t7,bcgrm,2,Tue May 19 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd agree with what was mentioned about the fonts. I can see why it might be useful to have something up there (you'll have a fair amount of empty space), but since it'll be a phone background, it might actually work better to not having anything at all. Otherwise I'd pick another font.   Other than that:   I couldn't help but notice the thin lines on the bottom + bottom right. Not sure if you did that to extend the photo or maybe it hasn't been touched up yet, but I feel like getting rid of them would make the wallpaper a little cleaner. Not to mention, I noticed the NHL Playoffs logo overlapping with the red just a bit, which again, I think prevents clean lines.  I'd be curious to see a version without the shadowed corners (I think this is more of a personal thing, though).    Other than that, really nice job. Interested in seeing what else you might have in mind if you plan on making any more! Might be cool to try some different shots, too (body, action, closeups, etc.). Thanks for sharing."
rangers,36gd3r,AnubisZX5,5,Tue May 19 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"The first period was very tightly called.  I have no problem with that, as long as Refs are consistent.  Players and coaches can adapt to how the game's going to be called.  However, the reffing was not consistent, and as the game went on, especially after Devorski* came in after Linesman Brad Kovachik's injury, the game was called totally different. (The game was called less tight, but there was a blatant trip by Carle that went uncalled, possibly as a make up for the Paquette high stick that Moore embellished.)    I didn't feel the calls were particularly biased one way or another, nor that it was the worst called game I've seen in the playoffs this year, but playoff games should be called more consistently than that.  * I know Devorski was just filling in as a linesman, and didn't call penalties."

Also keep in mind that Glass hasn't been good with any other team either, and that this is his second go around in a Vigneault system. You're right, he's not a superstar, he's not a star, and he's arguably not NHL caliber. He's playing better and that's good - it's not like we aren't rooting for him to do well."

Those are both teams' strengths, and I can see Glass being overwhelmed by the speed of the game (much as he was in the regular season).  Otherwise, I totally agree with your sentiment as far as the first 2 rounds are concerned. He was one of the few guys consistently creating space on the ice and actually playing through the more physical style of the Pens and Caps."

rangers,36fkon,Robotron_25,3,Tue May 19 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"I respect that. Here is my take on it. Sitting in a crowd, beer and hotdog in hand you're about to enjoy a sporting event, relax a bit from work (never the case at a rangers game) or let some steam out, either way it is definitely a leisure activity.   My take is that the national anthem serves as a reminder before you have a great time at a game that there are people out there that have their lines on the line and have lost their lives in the military protecting our country.   Same thing when there are moments of silence to honor a recent death. Just serving to ground us so we are thankful for what we have.   Just my 2 cents."
rangers,36fkon,fosiacat,6,Tue May 19 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you're making it sound like we have to be thankful for the fact that our country has sent people into wars (justifiable or not) so that we can watch a game of hockey.

rangers,36fkon,mexicaaaan,5,Tue May 19 18:17:55 2015 UTC,"do we constantly need reminders? i can't think of a single person that has forgotten any major tragedy in this country. where does it end? why don't we do the pledge of allegiance before everything we do to remind us?   and that ""died protecting our country"" thing is a bit of a farce, let's be honest. we've been attacked on american soil twice in the last 100 years and once it was pearl harbor. we're protecting our interests, we're maintaining a show of strength. we're pissing off a lot of other people and countries, and causing uprisings like ISIS due to our intervention, destabilization, and ultimate abandonment. the problem with the constant glorification of military and military members is that it ingrains the mentality into people that being in the military is one of the most honorable things one can do, and that war is honor, and that war is good. of course no one will ever say this in public that 'war is good' but boy oh boy is war good [for business]. it's a constant push for militarization and endless wars, our soldiers are the pawns in the game, lockheed martin, northrup, link, etc., all of the rest of the military industrial complex is the king. they rake in billions of dollars in government contracts as payback for ""donations"" to campaigns that use my friends and family as the charcoal briquettes.   defense is one thing. what we have is an entirely different thing. we have an actual economy based on the exchange of lives for money. lives that are sold on some false pretense of honor and duty, when the reality is you're a dollar sign for Boeing.   i really hate even having to say this, but i really sincerely mean it out of love - people are being duped left and right into this shit and it disgusts me and they don't even realize it because it's ingrained into our culture going back generations. it does not need to be this way.  i don't mean to come off as anti-military, or against people in the military - it's not that, and it's not their fault. i respect the people that believe what they are doing is right, and i know a lot of it is in fact necessary. but the constant beating it into my head that MILITARY GOOD TERRISS/EYE-RACK BAD is so fucking...ugh, basic, simple and inaccurate it fucking bothers the hell out of me to the point where when i see displays of this type of shit it just pisses me off more than it makes me proud to be american. there are many levels to this onion, and when you start peeling away the layers it starts to stink."

rangers,36dhdm,DreamcastWriter,3,Mon May 18 18:36:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, short answer is no. It's a combination of interest/logistics  Nobody does it here because we're preoccupied with playoffs and other things, and most of the Wolf Pack games fall on nights where there are Rangers games. And /r/HartfordWolfPack is mostly a collection of news and whatnot, as a sort of helper for the subscribers of /r/rangers and they can quickly peek over and see what the latest is.  Over the summer, I hope to get AutoMod/that game-info bot over in /r/hockey to get stuff going for the Wolf Pack next season, as I'd love for something to just automatically run and be liveupdated. But I don't see much discussion and stuff happening, as, like I said, the Rangers usually play the same nights. And by then, you guys will have the Reign and will be over on the West Coast :/"

I've just been watching the Monarchs games a lot this post-season and it seems there isn't a subreddit for them (at least there is no link over on r/ahl) or place for discussions.  As for moving next year, I know many Kings fans, myself included, are very excited about having the team out here next year.

I also found out that there is a 2015 Playoff dress code policy in Amalie Arena, basically no rangers jerseys, only lightning jerseys are allowed, no away teams colors. This isn't for the entire area, just certain sections, not all of the sections, but most of them. I thought that was crazy and a nice TIL."
rangers,36ddne,Sochax92,5,Mon May 18 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"Club level and first two rows. Not most. I'm not a fan of it, but I would at least like to see less misinformation. Below is the entirety of the policy, from [here](www.amaliearena.com/guest-services/a-z-guide), under dress code.  Here's the map, if you want top see what they are talking about.  Don't think for a second that you won't see Rangers fans, or that they will have somehow snuck past this policy. They'll be there, they'll be wearing their gear, and they'll likely be loud. Just like anywhere else. Also, these policies are pretty common anymore. See you guys tonight in a GDT somewhere.   In support of our hometown Tampa Bay Lightning and in furtherance of our goal to turn Amalie Arena blue for the playoffs, please note that Tampa Bay Arena, L.P. d/b/a Amalie Arena (TBA) has adopted the following Playoff Dress Code Policy (the “Playoff Policy”), which shall be in effect in the Chase Bank Club (inclusive of all 4th Floor club common areas and the corresponding seating sections), the Lexus Lounge (inclusive of all Lounge common areas and all ‘Row A’ and ‘Row B’ seats), and the North Party Suite (together, the “Club”) throughout the 2014-2015 Lightning playoffs.  STATEMENT OF POLICY: Only Lightning-branded or ‘neutral’ attire and apparel will be permitted in the Club and the Club-designated seating areas during 2014-2015 Lightning playoff games (including any pre-game and any post-game activities). Any attire, apparel, articles of clothing, accessories (e.g., hats, lapel pins, hair accessories, jewelry), or promotional collateral (e.g., mini-flags, noisemakers) that are branded with the name, logo, or registered mark(s) of the then-current 2014-2015 playoff opponent of the Lightning are expressly prohibited in the Club and in the Club-designated seating areas (together, the “Restricted Apparel”). For purposes of clarification, Restricted Apparel shall include any clothing and/or merchandise (whether official or unofficial) that bears any reference to the Lightning’s then-current playoff opponent (e.g., Detroit Red Wings in Round 1). Fans/guests/patrons who have any Restricted Apparel on their person (each, an “Impacted Ticket Holder”) shall have 4 options: (i) check the Restricted Apparel with a member of the Amalie Arena ‘Guests Services’ staff (the “Check Option”); (ii) obtain an Arena re-entry pass from an Amalie Arena ‘Guest Services’ staff member so that the Restricted Apparel can be placed in a vehicle, hotel room, etc. (the “Re-Entry Option”); (iii) have Club ticket(s) relocated to an alternate section of the Arena wherein the Playoff Policy is not in effect (the “Relocation Option”); or (iv) if the Impacted Ticket Holder purchased their Club ticket(s) directly from TBA or Lightning Hockey LP, request a refund of the amount paid for such tickets (the “Refund Option”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Playoff Policy, any apparel that features the “Head-to-Head” branding (wherein the Lightning’s logo is ‘facing-off’ alongside the logo of the Lightning’s opponent) shall not be deemed Restricted Apparel.  In the event that an Impacted Ticket Holder elects the Check Option, the Impacted Ticket Holder will be required to sign a TBA-maintained ‘check log’ outlining the item(s) checked (the “Checked Item(s)”), and, in exchange, will be given a claim ticket that they can use to collect the Checked Item(s) following the game (or at any time prior to the end of the game if the Impacted Ticket Holder is leaving the Arena). While TBA will use its best efforts to safely store the Checked Items during the game for the Impacted Ticket Holder, TBA’s liability to the Impacted Ticket Holder (or any agent, assign, or representative of Ticket Holder) in the event of loss, damage, or theft shall be limited to money damages equal to the value of the Checked Items or $300.00, whichever is less. TBA shall have no responsibility for any Checked Items that are left at the Arena more than twenty-four (24) hours past the conclusion of the game for which the items were checked with TBA. In the event that the Impacted Ticket Holder elects the Re-Entry Option, the Impacted Ticket Holder shall comply with any and all Arena policies and procedures regarding exiting and re-entering the building (including, without limitation, subjecting themselves to a follow-up security search at the time of re-entry). In the event that the Impacted Ticket Holder elects the Relocation Option, the Impacted Ticket Holder shall be required to surrender their Club ticket(s) to an Arena Guest Services staff member, and, in exchange, will be provided with an equal number of tickets for an alternate seating location, precise location to be determined at TBA’s discretion based upon its then-current available inventory. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, TBA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Impacted Ticket Holder with a replacement seat location that is reasonably comparable to the Club tickets that were tendered for relocation. In the event that the Impacted Ticket Holder elects the Refund Option (such election option strictly contingent upon the Impacted Ticket Holder being able to establish that they purchased the Club ticket(s) from TBA or Lightning Hockey LP), TBA’s Ticket Office staff shall facilitate the refund via the method of payment used for the purchase of such tickets (e.g., refund the same credit card used at time of purchase).  As a courtesy, fans/guests/patrons that elect either the Check Option or the Re-Entry Option will be offered a gratuitous non-branded t-shirt for wear in the Club (either an unmarked black or an unmarked blue t-shirt, varying sizes available). A limited number of such replacement t-shirts will be made available by TBA, and TBA shall have no liability to the Impacted Ticket Holder in the event that any inventory for such replacement t-shirts is exhausted before the Impacted Ticket Holder is distributed a t-shirt.  Any questions or concerns regarding this Playoff Policy should be directed to an Arena staff member located at the Guest Services kiosk at Section 101 or to Susan Danielik at sdanielik@amaliearena.com  We thank you in advance for your cooperation and GO BOLTS!"

No reasonable person, or even totally unreasonable hothead, could say that it is.   It pisses me off because it's unnecessary. Who gives a shit about club level? Like you can see them on tv anyway. There will be Rangers jerseys on TV no matter what. So what is the point of this policy, outside of giving opposing teams' fans something to complain about that not one of them has ever shown the true nature of? No offense intended, OP, you just said exactly the same thing every Wings and Habs fan said."

And you don't have to imagine what would happen.  Event  Controversy, 2  What actually happened, which doesn't matter because just like here and every other time this gets posted, it isn't about the truth, it's about the bad press, just like you said.  And for the record, I have repeatedly posted against it. I don't like the policy, I just explained what it actually was because OP was mistaken, as was every other person who posted about it during these playoffs. And while I don't think this was the case with OP here, many of them (and the Canaidan media they were linking to) were deliberately misrepresenting it.  It's a bad policy."

But you'll be missing out on a lot of side content.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqMr0OvQog  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSftIRQzYCM  The game is getting great reviews so it might be worth it to try it out and see if you like it. Or watch someone else play it if that's your thing.
rangers,36ddne,TALQVIST,2,Mon May 18 14:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely recommend redbox/gameflying it first and seeing if it's your type of game.  I played the last one because it was being given away free on xbox live, and looked really sweet.  Got to the monster at the end of the first town(~6 hours in), beat it, and said well that's enough of that game for me, and haven't gone back to it since.    It's definitely one of those games with a lot of go to x, kill y, get z, but I found the customization options/spells you could tech out pretty limited and once you've played a couple of hours you've basically seen all the game has to offer and it's more about progressing the storyline than anything else.  Combat also isn't nearly as engaging as the trailers make it seem.  And since I just went on that ridiculous tangent in /r/rangers for not much reason, I'll add that you can take Nash bucketing his second goal tonight to the bank.  He came a post away from it last game and Tampa can't handle him, Brass, and Hayes on a line.  LGR."

Yes, I do commission work, if you don't mind waiting a bit of time. As far as tattoos go, I'm asked frequently to do designs, but it would depend on what you want, where you plan on having it done on your body, and I would need half up front, and half after it's completed. I would like to note that i use very fine pens to execute my illustrations, line work that tattoo artists might not be able to copy effectively, and line work that will surely blur over time. With that in mind, I could definitely draw you all something, more simplified, and hope it's to your liking? With commission work, I remain in constant contact with my clients, all to ensure that what I'm drawing is entirely up to their standards. What do you think?"
rangers,369lec,conimal,1 point,Mon May 18 20:07:34 2015 UTC,I think that all sounds very fair.

rangers,36ai6b,thebabybananagrabber,2,Sun May 17 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"Diddling — or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle — is sufficiently well understood. Yet the fact, the deed, the thing diddling, is somewhat difficult to define. We may get, however, at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by defining — not the thing, diddling, in itself — but man, as an animal that diddles. Had Plato but hit upon this, he would have been spared the affront of the picked chicken.  Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken, which was clearly “a biped without feathers,” was not, according to his own definition, a man? But I am not to be bothered by any similar query. Man is an animal that diddles, and there is no animal that diddles but man. It will take an entire hen-coop of picked chickeus [[chickens]] to get over that.  What constitutes the essence, the ware, the principle of diddling is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons. A crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles. To diddle is his destiny. “Man was made to mourn,” says the poet. But not so: — he was made to diddle. This is his aim — his object — his end. And for this reason when a man’s diddled we say he’s “done.”   -Edgar Allen Poe"

rangers,36g453,bcgrm,4,Tue May 19 03:04:31 2015 UTC,I don't want Boyle out of the lineup. I just don't want to see him and St. Louis take up 1:20 of every powerplay anymore. It's not 2004. It's not working. Adjust.
rangers,36g453,hockeysauce,3,Tue May 19 03:19:21 2015 UTC,You nailed it. It's insane that these two waste half of every power play.
rangers,36g453,ranick10,2,Tue May 19 03:21:18 2015 UTC,I'm pretty fuckin sure we scored a powerplay goal. It's not the personal it's the style we play a 1-3-1 on the pp and it's just doesn't generate good traffic in front. Hence the reason we scored on a nice rebound

rangers,36g453,darkknight915,2,Tue May 19 03:04:30 2015 UTC,I actually thought Boyle has been solid this series. He was horrible against the caps but this is more his style. This loss really wasnt his fault.

rangers,36g453,rhenze,4,Tue May 19 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's almost like our third pair defenseman who is 6th on the team in points, leads the team in power play points, and has the best corsi on the team in the playoffs isn't the reason we lost.  I feel bad for Sharks fans who come here. Boyle gets blamed for all of our woes in the most convoluted ways possible."
rangers,36g453,Darclite,2,Tue May 19 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Let's look at the goals against he was on the ice for:   1st goal - MSL totally gaffs a pass that he had plenty of time to handle, leading to a breakway 2nd goal - Other Dman (didn't see who) falls on the blue line leading to a 2on1. He lets a pass get through high in the zone, but takes away the low pass across close to the goal. 3rd goal - Rangers on the PK, the 3 other PKers circle high leaving Boyle to deal with 2 Lightning players by himself in front of the net, one of which knocks in a rebound."
rangers,36g453,rhenze,1 point,Tue May 19 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw the -2 and was trying to figure it out, then I remember the image of him lying down to stop the pass on the odd man rush where no one even came close to being helpful, and then of course the MSL play where somehow it's his fault even though guys control passes like that with their skates a dozen times a game.  It's like Game 1 against the Caps. He gets boarded while pinning the puck along the boards with 4 seconds to go resulting in the last second game winner. If it's Klein everyone would be up in arms, but when it's Boyle people are going off about how terrible of a decision it was to pin the puck. That happens at the end of so many periods and somehow that came to be the big problem. Not the illegal boarding.  I'm not even a huge Boyle fan, I'm just exhausted from seeing so many posts on here after a game where he's either contributing offense or just serviceable and not all that visible that are calling for his head. Every important measurement for him is fine. It's not like he's our #1 D-man. He's on the third pair. He doesn't need to be doing more than this. Our top 2 wingers need to step up.  Someone pointed it out to me that we have a weird history of scapegoating some defenseman who isn't actually that terrible as if they're the source of all our struggles. Before this it was Del Zotto, before that it was Rozsival or Malik or Redden. Maybe the fact that this team hasn't been able to put up goals in the playoffs in a decade is a bigger problem."
rangers,36g453,josephnicklo,1 point,Tue May 19 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"It's disappointing, but I guess people need their excuses :/  Tampa was just the better team tonight unfortunately."
rangers,36g453,darkknight915,2,Tue May 19 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't think it was really that lopsided. We had the advantage in shots and shot attempts in all three periods, just took too many penalties and Staal and Marty made two remarkably terrible mistakes that killed our momentum. Not surprised we lost but if you showed me every stat from the game besides the score I wouldn't have guessed we lost 6-2."
rangers,36g453,hockeysauce,2,Tue May 19 04:04:24 2015 UTC,True that. Gotta stay out of the box next game and keep it from being a track meet.

rangers,36g453,Chexjc,1 point,Tue May 19 13:48:25 2015 UTC,"Boyle has been really bad. It's age it's not for a lack of effort that is for sure but the man is done. He can't skate, he gets abused on the boards and loses many battles for the puck, he also has trouble clearing it too. His decision making on the PP isn't that great either at this point so it's really hard to justify his spot in the lineup."

rangers,368215,FLRangerFan,5,Sun May 17 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"At the time, it looked like Del Zottos ceiling was much high than Klein's. Klein was 29, and MDZ only 23. He had shown flashes of brilliance, and a lot of people thought a change of scenery (ie getting the fuck away from the torts system) was all he needed to really break out. While we clearly won that trade, it wasn't so obviously one-sided when it originally happened. It could have at least ended up being mutually beneficial."
rangers,368215,Ralph_Baconader,1 point,Sun May 17 19:46:34 2015 UTC,Nashville have a lot of defenseman to play around with so I guess they felt they could take a risk.
rangers,368215,idontlikeketchup,2,Tue May 19 00:47:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, it was a pretty good trade but I feel like people put it on the same level as the McDonagh-Gomez trade, which it isn't at all."
rangers,368215,tj_sad_boi_666,3,Sun May 17 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"I mean the McD trade was obviously better, but there were a lot of pieces there. In the Klein trade we simply traded one top six defenseman for another, and look what we ended up with. Do you remember what it was like having MDZ on the ice? Klein is a massive upgrade, and we pulled it off in a straight up one-for-one swap."
rangers,368215,Ralph_Baconader,1 point,Sun May 17 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean like I said it was a good trade, but I remember when Klein was on his hot streak earlier this season people were acting like it was on the same level as McD for Gomez"
rangers,368215,tj_sad_boi_666,31,Sun May 17 21:28:32 2015 UTC,Mcdonagh (and cap space for gaborik) for gomez. Best trade ever?
rangers,368215,godlyjacob,17,Sun May 17 02:01:14 2015 UTC,"He turned Gomez and his salary into McD, Gaborik and Prust (traded Higgins for him).  Probably up there as one of the best moves in sports history."
rangers,368215,annihilus813,4,Sun May 17 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"I'm just worried that Yandle for Duclair might be in the ""best trades ever"" category :/"
rangers,368215,shantm79,16,Sun May 17 21:50:11 2015 UTC,I think the assistant gm Jeff Gorton is responsible for quite a bit of behind the scenes work as well. It's the reason the Rangers won't let him interview for other jobs.
rangers,368215,darkknight915,2,Sun May 17 02:14:17 2015 UTC,Bingo. People glaze over him all the time.
rangers,368215,josephnicklo,12,Mon May 18 16:24:03 2015 UTC,Sather and the front office brought us (in terms of home grown talent):  1) Lundqvist  2) Kreider  3) Stepan  4) Hagelin  5) Fast  6) McDonagh   7) Girardi  8) Talbot  9) Staal  10) Zucc  This doesn't count the numerous impact prospects in the minors.   10/20 starting lineup players were developed by the team. I'd say Sather is worth his weight in gold - thats a damn decent resume.
rangers,368215,_TheConsumer_,6,Sun May 17 05:55:48 2015 UTC,captain isn't home grown
rangers,368215,kamikazi34,3,Sun May 17 07:26:48 2015 UTC,Neither is stepan  EDIT: Both from Wisconsin! (where I reside)
rangers,368215,Ripoge,6,Sun May 17 07:58:23 2015 UTC,i meant more that captain wasn't our draft pick. he came from mtl's system.
rangers,368215,kamikazi34,4,Sun May 17 08:22:38 2015 UTC,He came from another system - but our front office noticed his potential. McD was a throw in for the Gomez trade.   Also - McD was developed in our system before he made his NHL debut.
rangers,368215,_TheConsumer_,9,Sun May 17 14:49:00 2015 UTC,Yea Sather has proven himself many times over to be an elite GM. I mean the last shitty Sather decision was what? Redden?
rangers,368215,Arctic_Drunkey,9,Sun May 17 02:24:10 2015 UTC,Fucking hell I almost threw up.
rangers,368215,Lynkx0501,5,Sun May 17 04:24:39 2015 UTC,I've tried very hard to forget about him
rangers,368215,darkknight915,2,Sun May 17 12:06:37 2015 UTC,"The only thing I hated was 2 first rounders to Tampa. A 1 and a 2 should have gotten it done. But wtf do I know, it almost got us the title last year"
rangers,368215,Schrambino,2,Sun May 17 21:37:42 2015 UTC,Glass for 3 years.
rangers,368215,brother_of_menelaus,3,Sun May 17 19:57:45 2015 UTC,Blame Alain. Slats gave him Sheppard at the deadline (IMO for the purpose of displacing Glass with a defensive forward) but AV only gave him 2 games before putting Glass back in for good. AV just loves Glass almost as much as Pierre loves Crosby
rangers,368215,Schrambino,3,Sun May 17 21:34:26 2015 UTC,He has played well lately IMO.
rangers,368215,kthoag,1 point,Mon May 18 02:35:39 2015 UTC,I begrudgingly agree with you.
rangers,368215,Rib-I,1 point,Mon May 18 13:35:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree but no team needs to sign a 4th liner for 3 years. Guys like this are available on the cheap every year. No need to commit yourself to one.
rangers,368215,brother_of_menelaus,1 point,Tue May 19 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"One could argue Richards' contract and Stralman's lack of a contract were both poor moves one could blame on the GM.   There's an argument that both moves were reasonable, and neither were as bad as some of his prior signings. Overall, I think we're beyond the days of chanting ""Fire Sather."""
rangers,368215,averyrule,1 point,Mon May 18 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"Macilrath over guys like Tarasenko was pretty bad. As was not signing Steadman in fair of Boyle.  But yeah, his good outweigh the bad."
rangers,368215,lAmARedditorAMA,8,Mon May 18 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Other than the botched first round picks I have no gripes with Sather. We have missed the playoffs once since 2005 and that has a lot to do with him building a solid roster over the years. Now we are finally seeing his team in action - mostly late round draft picks, undrafted guys, with a couple of smart trades/FA signings too.   One of my buddies (a Devils fan, go figure) tried giving me flak saying our team is too old and will crumble, but I pointed out to him that besides Nash, MSL, Hank, and Dan Boyle, just about every important player on our team is 30 or under. We just need to keep Stepan and Kreider in the long term picture and our roster will be fine."
rangers,368215,artvandelay1994,5,Sun May 17 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"That's the best part by far. Fast, Kreider, Miller, Hayes, Stepan, McDonagh, Brassard, Haeglin, Zucc...and some decent prospects (who I'm not very well versed on but from what I've read here they're pretty solid) coming up. You can see why Sather determined that a move for Yandle with DuClair was totally feasible. It was the right move, even if Yandle has disappointed a bit."
rangers,368215,Jewtheist,3,Sun May 17 05:17:48 2015 UTC,I feel like yandle hasn't fully adjusted to playing on the team yet. Can't judge the trade for another season or so.
rangers,368215,artvandelay1994,10,Sun May 17 05:20:14 2015 UTC,"For sure. And even if DuClair becomes an all-star and Yandle never gets much better, it doesn't change the fact that it was the right move at the time. The Rangers had enough youth and forward depth to absorb the loss of DuClair if it meant adding one of the more reliable and skilled under-30 defenseman in the league for a Cup run. It may turn out badly, but I don't think you can say it was a bad move."
rangers,368215,Jewtheist,2,Sun May 17 05:25:45 2015 UTC,Especially with buchnovich waiting in the wings
rangers,368215,godlyjacob,5,Sun May 17 07:25:12 2015 UTC,I heard that the big contracts in the beginning we done purposely to provide a cover for an internal rebuild. Those contracts were to expire around the time of a new wave of players coming up through the newly revamped scouting and farm system.  Those big bad contracts just didn't pan out as they'd hope though in regards to keeping the team enjoyable and watchable.   I did not find this out until years after the fact.
rangers,368215,staticzen,2,Sun May 17 13:13:26 2015 UTC,Hmm that would actually make a lot of sense.

rangers,368215,domspart,4,Mon May 18 06:01:40 2015 UTC,he does a great job ignoring Dolan
rangers,368215,playdohplaydate,3,Sun May 17 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think he certainly deserves credit for where the team is now but he has been the President and GM of the Rangers for 15 years without a Cup to show for it.  When he first took over, he took over for a team loaded with bad contracts in a pre-salary cap era. And he continued to spend a shit ton of money on aging stars. Anyone remember the Bobby Holik contract? The team was terrible his first few seasons in charge and I think he finally realized it when he had that fire sale back in 2003-2004 which included trading Brian Leetch.  I think the salary cap saved his ass. He was forced to think about budget and couldn't just spend money like a drunken sailor. But he still continued to give out the occasional bad contract - Drury, Gomez, Redden, Richards. We'll see how Dan Boyle pans out and if he'll re-sign Marty and at what price.   We've had a decade of playoff hockey since the big lockout, missing it just once, but I think we have to look at the whole picture and not just the success we've had now before determining his legacy. Hopefully we can add another Cup to his resume."
rangers,368215,otter_pop_n_lock,3,Sun May 17 18:02:30 2015 UTC,Anyone remember the Bobby Holik contract?   I'd prefer not to.
rangers,368215,josephnicklo,2,Mon May 18 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"Haha. Sorry if I brought back painful memories.  Still, I have to marvel at where we've come as an organization from those dark days to now. I mean, those were really, really terrible Ranger teams. Just going to throw out random names just for the hell of it: Kevin Hatcher, Valeri Kamensky, Dave Karpa, Rich Pilon, Mike Dunham, Steve McKenna, Tomas Kloucek...."
rangers,368215,otter_pop_n_lock,1 point,Mon May 18 16:29:00 2015 UTC,Ugh.
rangers,368215,josephnicklo,1 point,Mon May 18 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, even while he was playing for the Rangers, I'm pretty sure Holik hated the Rangers."
rangers,368215,averyrule,2,Mon May 18 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"I do think the Cap Forced him to change his game plan. He was giving out some questionable contracts prior.   But, his genius really flourished under the cap. Growing up, any time the Rangers had a ""can't miss"" prospect, it wound up being Jamie Lundmark/Pavel Brendl epic busts.   Now, it seems like every prospect is an impact player - in some capacity. McIlrath is bordering on bust - but that's one out of dozens."
rangers,368215,_TheConsumer_,2,Sun May 17 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"I try not to put so much emphasis on the draft because it's so hit or miss. Not saying that having a good farm isn't important but going back to guys like Malhotra, Lundmark, Brendl, Jessiman, etc. it's so hard to predict. I mean, a lot of these guys were can't miss and do you really blame Slats for them turning out to be busts?  I think you have to appreciate his scouting abilities regardless. He got guys like Cally and Dubi and was able to get the most of guys who seemed like hardworking third/fourth liners. Girardi was undrafted. Stralman claimed off of waivers.  The only real issue I have with Slats is that I think he still falls in love with the aging star. Redden was a disaster. He got guys like Markus Naslund and Brendan Shanahan who were good but still past their prime. He traded for St. Louis. He let Stralman go and signed Dan Boyle."
rangers,368215,otter_pop_n_lock,2,Sun May 17 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"He's still made some terrible, terrible decisions as Prez/GM of this team. I'll never stop giving him shit for it.  He's had the best goaltender in the NHL for a while now and he's failed to capitalize on that. I understand multiple trips to the ECF's, yearly playoff visits, great regular season records and all is nice but ""2nd place is the 1st loser"".  Let's also compare Sather to some of the best modern GM's of big market teams like Ken Holland (4 Cups), Dean Lombardi (2 Cups), Stan Bowman (2 Cups). These are GM's that have been with their respective teams for a lengthy period of time and have won multiple championships without going apeshit over blown up free agent signings.   They did it by making smart moves and good drafting not by making marquee moves like Sather (still) can't seem to avoid doing.  Say the Rangers win the Cup this year. That helps Sather's legacy with the Rangers however if they dont, this guy is going to go down as just a dinosaur that was given they keys to a franchise and did nothing but spend a lot of money.  To be fair, Sather is an expert at ripping other GM's off in trades. The list of trades Sather has ""won"" is pretty extensive.   • Chris Simon for Blair Betts (miss this guy)  • Higgins+Kotalik for Prust+Jokinen  • A bunch of scrubs for Pavel Bure  • 3rd round pick for Brian Boyle  • Anson Carter for Jagr (I still don't believe it)  • Gomez+Pyatt+Busto for McDonagh+Higgins+Valentenko+Janik (which in turn was dealt in the Prust trade)  So yes, he's had a great track record with trades but when the Rangers win the Cup, he'll get some respect.  TLDR: When you compare Sather to long-tenured GM's of other big market teams, he is crap."
rangers,368215,josephnicklo,2,Mon May 18 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think Slats is doing a great job, but this team for the last decade is nothing without Hank, and everyone knows that.  Hank was drafted in the 7th round, and he wasn't even the first goalie the Rangers took in that draft! It was luck, if they had any idea he would be this good he woulda been taken much higher.  Hank carried this team, getting them into the playoffs in years where they had no business being there (cough drury gomez)."

Let's not discredit 2008 - we had Shanahan, Jagr, Gomez, Drury, Straka, Dubi, Cally - we were a stacked team offensively and most hockey writers not only predicted a playoff appearance, but a chance at the Finals.  This doesn't discredit Lundqvist, I'm just saying that we had additional pieces to be great that year!"

While I can't argue that our offensive production has been lackluster, we fucking win these games for a reason.

rangers,366ywj,XD229,3,Sat May 16 20:01:59 2015 UTC,I've noticed that they're having an easier time getting to the net last couple of games. The Caps were able to keep them out for a lot of that series. The Bolts don't have a group of defensemen as deep or good as them.
rangers,366ywj,IzBox,4,Sat May 16 20:04:58 2015 UTC,That and also Trotz is a much better defensive coach.
rangers,366ywj,jxnfpm,4,Sat May 16 20:06:36 2015 UTC,Much better coach period. Babcock very nearly won that series with a Wings team that sputtered towards the end of the regular season.

rangers,366ywj,lagavulin16yr,2,Sat May 16 19:38:38 2015 UTC,Moore owned that whole shift where he scored the game winner. You could see it in real time he just wanted the puck more then anyone else on the ice. It was awesome to see.  Great game all around. 9 down 7 to go. LGR!

rangers,366ywj,kamikazi34,2,Sat May 16 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Even though this was a 2-1 game again, I honestly think this was the best played game of all the 2-1 victories.

rangers,366ywj,MrSovietNinja,3,Sat May 16 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"If the Rangers just finished more of their chances, they could have won 3 or 4-1."

rangers,366ywj,redline42,2,Sat May 16 22:28:19 2015 UTC,D.Moore has been the most consistent Ranger these past few years. Regular and post-season.  Points don't show how important this man is.
rangers,366ywj,captars,2,Sun May 17 00:20:17 2015 UTC,Can I say that I was so much more calm watching this game than i was during that last series?  I was so uncomfortable with a 1 goal lead against the caps. Seeing the Rangers get to play their game sort of calmed me. I knew everything was going to work out.  I think the Rangers really showed everyone that they are the fastest team in the NHL right now.
rangers,366ywj,NYSportsGuy4,4,Sun May 17 02:21:15 2015 UTC,Refs seem very fair thus far.  Nice to see no questionable calls and the conspiracy theories
rangers,366ywj,keetner,2,Sat May 16 19:43:34 2015 UTC,New York Lightning > Tampa Bay Rangers! Moore deserved that so much!
rangers,366ywj,darkknight915,2,Sat May 16 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"I realize it was faster paced game, and we finally got to see the type of game the Rangers like to play - the kind we've seen in the second half of the regular season - but why can't they also throw bodies around like they did during the Caps series?  They've shown the capability to play really big, physical and strong and also combine that with blazing with speed and finesse.   I want to see more of the intense, intimidating physical play.  This will show total dominance.   It will lead to more scoring."
rangers,366ywj,frontadmiral,1 point,Sat May 16 21:15:40 2015 UTC,They were 31-19 in hits.  They were physical.   Didnt seem like it but the pace was so fast the camera didnt concentrate on the shots like against the Caps.
rangers,366ywj,runninhillbilly,1 point,Sat May 16 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"We played a tight game. It wasn't pretty, but we got good chances, played well positionally, and forced takeaways. And needless to say, Hank was fantastic as always.  We need to stop taking weak penalties and do better on faceoffs, I have very little to complain about."
rangers,366ywj,AwesomeExo,1 point,Sat May 16 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"Said it before and I'll say it again: Rangers really lost those 3 regular season games because of penalties. Have to limit penalties against this team. Their PP is lethal. Bishop is certainly underrated. Hopefully we solve him sooner than we solved Holtby. Great first start, very solid defense, and couldn't be happier for Dom. Looking forward to game 2."
rangers,366ywj,darkeagle91,1 point,Sun May 17 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"Really solid first game! I was quite nervous going into this one just given the emotional narrative surrounding the series about ex-teammates and all that. I thought it'd be a little more emotional (and I dunno, it might still end up so), but it seems like the ""business"" side of the Playoffs has usurped those feelings a bit and/or a  lot of it was dealt with earlier on in the regular season. If so, it would make watching this series a little bit easier for me :P.  One of the biggest things I noticed was how open of a game both teams were able to play. There was a lot of tight forechecking in the Pens series, and even more so + grinding kind of play against the Caps. Whereas today, although we saw our rush/stretch-pass game a bit in the past few games, I felt like today was the first time we were able to really implement it for a good portion of the game. It was pretty refreshing to see and I think it worked well to our advantage; made it difficult for the Bolts to gain possession + set up plays. I thought we defended against them pretty well, too, by forcing turnovers and defending in the neutral zone/at our blue line to keep shots out or on the outside. That said, I am very sure Tampa will make changes accordingly, so I am pretty curious to see how both teams will respond.  I mean, as excited as I am for the win, I can't help but feel a little anxious, still. For example, Boyler was a late scratch for the Bolts, it's game 1, was an early game...so yeah. I imagine things will be changing quite a bit as the series goes on. As of now, I'm probably the most worried about their PP. People said it ran dry when the Bolts were up against the Wings...but I'm starting to think a lot of it had to do with the Wings being very good defensively/on the PK (how the Bolts were able to move the puck so well was a bit scary). I'm glad we could gain a win following our stats against Bishop, but I am still a bit worried about him just given his size + how has done quite in the post-season thus far.  But overall, I thought we played pretty well. Great plays leading up to to the goals, too; happy to see Step get another and D. Moore has been playing so well for us this entire postseason. Also, props to McD blocking the puck with his butt at that one point, though :(. It looked absolutely painful, but admittedly, I couldn't help but laugh a little from his reaction. Poor guy."
rangers,366ywj,gimbz,1 point,Sun May 17 07:26:23 2015 UTC,"Good thing Moore scored that goal, he made an absolutely awful pass on that 3 on 1."
rangers,366ywj,NJ_Yankees_Fan,0,Sat May 16 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"Did the refs seem very one-sided in this game? I saw tons of non-calls on the Lightning, especially in the first with Callahan grabbing sticks."
rangers,366ywj,domspart,3,Sat May 16 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of that stuff is close/judgment. I didn't see anything that would have you blatantly think ""WTF?!"" like when we got called for delay of game back in game 6 against the capitals."
rangers,366ywj,AwesomeExo,1 point,Sat May 16 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"This was probably the first game this postseason I didn't feel like they were calling borderline calls, or even just making stuff up against the Rangers to keep the calls even. Sucks we played sloppy, but at least we actually committed the penalties we got called for. Good news is (hopefully) we can clean our game up, and there won't be a lot of whistles."

With just under 3 minutes remaining, my brother ripped off his shirt in frustration and threw it across the room, and it got hooked on a nail over our office doorway (we use small finishing nails to hang Christmas lights and garland on in the winter). About 60 seconds later, Kreider scored, and the rest is history.  On Wednesday morning, I came downstairs to find our cleaning ladies about to take the shirt down, and I yelled ""NO, PLEASE LEAVE THAT UP!!"" While I scared the shit out of them, I feel it was worth it. That night we set/tied/extended SEVERAL NHL records with yet another game 7 win. (For the record, we aren't rich or loaded by any means, we have two ladies come every other week to vacuum and mop because we all work full time in my house.)  The shirt will remain hanging, untouched, until the playoffs run their course. We duck under it and walk around it, but we don't dare touch it. All hail the Thrown Shirt."

rangers,365mzq,Sockittoum,41,Sat May 16 11:04:17 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else cautiously optimistic about this series more so than the other two? I know Tampa Bay killed us this year but that was before we found our game, I feel like our strength's play much more to Tampa's game than they did against Washington and Pittsburg.  To be honest, I feel like people underestimate how good the Rangers were these first 2 series. Rewatching a lot of those games it looked like for most of them we completely dominated and the only reason we didn't win by more was incredible goaltending by Fleury and Holtby. I know Bishop is a beast, but I don't think he can make some of those saves the other goalies would so I think this series we'll start seeing the end of those ""2-1"" games. But who knows, it could just be that our poor shooting made Holtby and Fleury look better. I guess we'll have to find out!  LGR!"
rangers,365mzq,3kool5you,11,Sat May 16 11:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'm with you 100%. The media and sports world has talked about how the rangers have been ehh the whole playoffs... Not only were we the best team in the reg season, but if those two goalies weren't playing out of their mind we destroy those teams. If we can get a few bounces this series, it will be real fun to watch.  WE WANT THE CUP"
rangers,365mzq,TheSnappleman,3,Sat May 16 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"We're the (slight) favorite in Vegas to win the cup, have been since we forced Caps into a game 7. In that sense I don't think we're underrated, as the guys with money are actually betting on us, but I haven't been following national media, only NY sports stuff."
rangers,365mzq,cordlc,2,Sat May 16 13:51:58 2015 UTC,Future odds are weird though. They get set certain ways to protect themselves sometimes from earlier season bets. All about  covering  your ass and not losing money.
rangers,365mzq,jmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrz,2,Sat May 16 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Yes, because I agree with you. We were a lot better through those two series than most are giving us credit for. Fleury and Holtby were both playing out of their minds and the Capitals were playing a brilliant strategy against us that took us a while to crack. No, because it sucks to be optimistic and be wrong. I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but I certainly think that the series with the Capitals will have been the most difficult of the three rounds. If we were to get through Tampa, and I'm also thinking this will be a 6 game series, I'm mostly scared of Chicago."

rangers,365mzq,Ralph_Baconader,5,Sat May 16 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"if it were a goaltending competition hank would win all the time.  Since it's actual hockey, the team around him must also perform well.  If you think the reason hank has no cups is because he is not good enough you have never seen the man play."
rangers,365mzq,Mophideus,-9,Sat May 16 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"Hank is, out of respect a very good goaltender, BUT, he has  nothing to show in regards to Stanley Cups, in how many years in the NHL? Brodeur won his 1st in his 2nd season! He just isn't good enough to carry a team."
rangers,365mzq,wheresmyswimsuit,5,Sat May 16 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"Brodeur won all his cups in a completely different era of hockey on loaded teams that played the trap and faced significantly less shots than Hank has and does. Yes, Brodeur was a phenomenal Hall of Fame goalie, but to even compare the two is stupid. To compare them by number of rings? It just makes you look stupid."

rangers,365mzq,Not_Stalin,1 point,Sat May 16 16:14:21 2015 UTC,The obvious counter to this statement is how goaltenders contribute to the flow of a hockey game. Hank is an amazing goalie. He stops pucks from going into nets under insane and completely unreal scenarios. But you need more than a goalie to make it to the cup (ex: habs). You need a very good team to represent the east coast and take on the smelly westerners.

rangers,365mzq,joliedame,6,Sat May 16 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"But, but, but...in the regular season...  So many people are forgetting some key points here...   Playoff hockey has fuck-all to do with the regular season.  For all intents and purposes, the Playoffs are a brand new, mini-season. We didn't have McDonagh We didn't have Stepan. Hayes was only in his first month of being in the NHL. Hank hadn't gotten hot yet. The team hadn't got hot yet. Bishop is nowhere near as good as Holtby, so expect a lot more goals. We've got the desire to win the cup and the momentum/drive from winning these past series has likely lit a fire under our ass hardcore."

rangers,367ip1,berkley1217,2,Sat May 16 22:54:24 2015 UTC,What row are you in? That'll make all the difference.  I sat in the last row (row 7) in 417. Your view of the net on the opposite side of the ice is obstructed by the bridge. You kinda have to slouch in your seat to see the action.   The net closest to you is obstructed by the lower end of the area.
rangers,367ip1,brokenstatues,2,Sun May 17 00:32:31 2015 UTC,Depends on the row. Iirc rows 4+ are obstructed in some way. There are TVs so you can see the obstructed parts.

So does Ovi, but at least he still has a few years to do it. I'm glad to hear that Ovi said this, because even though we have faced each other WAY too many times in the playoffs recently, I'd like to think that both teams have a mutual respect for each other.

rangers,363sbk,metalunna,28,Sat May 16 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it is not about the obvious.  He is going to the game with his Dad. Just that thought is enough to make YOU giddy (even red eyed).    I recommend that you walk around outside.  Take a little time to get stuck in the NYC crowd.  Don't pull him or grab his arm. He will be OK. Watch out for him, but make him feel that he is part of the heartbeat of the City.   Buy a corner Dirty Water dog.  Get it with everything on it.  Dont freak out if he gets mustard on his jersey or shirt.  Tell him everyone does that. Point out your own.   Stop walking for a second and hanve him smell the air.  Yup...thats the subway - Yup - that is the charcoal smell of cooking Street Meat and toasting pretzels.    Point out the crazy dude banging on a 5 gallon drum. Point out the hot chick walking in front of you.    Walk inside the Garden like it is your own home.  It is."
rangers,363sbk,metalunna,3,Sat May 16 00:21:43 2015 UTC,I just got the feels. I love this advice. Thank you!
rangers,363sbk,m4tuna,1 point,Sat May 16 00:52:20 2015 UTC,So?  Are you Super Dad?  You can't beat that type of game.  With a loud crowd like that - and a late goal to go up 2-1 after a PK - The script was written for some nice memories that he will remember for his whole life..and will carry over to his kids.

rangers,363sbk,pandajungle,4,Sun May 17 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"This was very nice, but uh, you should probably hold your 7 year old's hand in a NYC crowd. Just saying, this shit ain't fantasyland, gotta keep an eye out, no matter how serene the moment is."
rangers,363sbk,Lynkx0501,3,Sat May 16 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying to let him walk free.  What I'm getting at is don't just grab him and drag him around like he is a rolling suitcase. Keeping track of your kids is a given..but allowing them to enjoy being a kid is also parent's job.  Edit - I've taken my 4 year old to several games (and one when she was 3) - and I can tell you it was the hardest thing to do, both mentally and physically.  It was a lot of work to make sure she was always safe, and she never once let go of my hand, but she loves going."

rangers,363sbk,NYRule1994,1 point,Mon May 18 19:50:17 2015 UTC,"Nope - Just a long time fan. First time I can remember ""really"" hugging my mom was in '94 on that magical night. That was the night my dad, who bad mouthed the team he loved every night actually said, ""I don't believe it"". My family grew up Ranger fans, My mom was a fan but got my dad into them before they got married.    Today, I love going over there and talking hockey. They follow the NHL, they know all the players and as saintly as my mother is, she has been known to call players ""...and that Fuckin' Bum"".    Hockey was a way of life in my family - I have 2 younger brothers that play as well as myself  - imagine 3 boys on 3 different teams all playing on a Sunday morning in 3 different arenas.  When my parents die, they will be elevated to the  the Hockey Gods and become one of them. I even expect them to piss some of the old gods off a bit..  What I'm getting at is that the passion for this sport, and this team flows from the parent to the child. I cried like a school girl when a section mate of mine bought a jersey for my son the day he came home from the hospital.  I thought, ""how am I supposed to pass this burden of loss to a baby - not even a few hours old? Do I want him to know what loss is so early in life? The answer? Yes! Life sucks. You don't always get what you want. But...But, when that puck bounces off the knee of one of the hardest working players of your team and it wins the game, there is balance. Balance that proves that a good old fashioned hard day of work can actually account for something. Sometimes it comes when you aren't looking. It is life.  Embrace that life . It truly is a drop in the cosmic bucket, but your stars are aligned. All of our stars are aligned to the Red, White and Blue Pattern that warms us up on sight, but can sometimes sting when we wear it, but we use it as a weapon when people covered in Orange, Red, Black or Yellow are near by. We are a team. We are a family. We believe in each others ability to do what ever needs to get done so be at the best level we can be. We are the Heart. We are the Soul.  We ARE the NEW YORK RANGERS."
rangers,363sbk,kennymakaha,2,Tue May 19 05:03:34 2015 UTC,"This. The first game I went to with my dad was a lackluster, midseason, 1-0 loss to the Panthers and it is still one of my favorite memories. To walk into the hallowed halls of MSG to see the Rangers play is always an incredible experience, and that first time I went with my dad was just so much more; I'm not even sure I have the words for it--it felt like a right of passage.   I hope you both have a marvelous time tomorrow. Lets go, Rangers!"
rangers,363sbk,DrDrangleBrungis,9,Sat May 16 04:13:38 2015 UTC,"get down as close as possible for warm ups. Trust me, I've been there and when I was younger I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Hell, I still go down there before every game. Seriously though, do it, he'll love it."

rangers,363sbk,ayoitzjoe,1 point,Mon May 18 18:31:58 2015 UTC,just show about a half hour or so before so you have plenty of time for whatever else you want to do but just go down to a lower section and walk down as close as you can. I'm not sure if you can get right up on the glass but I doubt you can.

rangers,363sbk,vudumonkey25,1 point,Mon May 18 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"One thing I did notice is that after the renovations that it's only specific sections they let you go down into, but if you just say nicely that you're looking to go down and watch warmups they'll be fine with it. Tons of fans do it."

I hope it's not to late and you get to read this I thought of another thing you guys can do. If your willing to wait around for a half hour or so after the game walk up 33rd Street. The players come out of the doors over there and get cabs, it's a good place to try and get autographs. I got a few myself and some great pictures with the players. You can also usually catch hank or brass driving out of the side on 34th st and they will usually stop and sign stuff"

I think you get $10 off your first time. If not PM me your email for an invite and you'll get $10 off.  Rangers town next door is always a great start. To get there go up the front area towards the main entrance but hang a right and you'll see the tents outside.   Maybe check out http://www.thegarden.com/tours.html  you can't go into the Rangers locker room on game day I've been told, but maybe worth a look.

rangers,36329d,UndoneSic,3,Fri May 15 20:25:40 2015 UTC,93 was technically NHLPA 93. The licensed the player names but not the team names so the rosters are all correct but they just have city names.

One week asked which famous actress was Arthur Miller married to (Marilyn Monroe) because they had just finished the Crucible.   I do this because when they get to college they need to know how to take good notes and how to retain important information.

Before Game 5, my wife bought a new wreath and got mad when I took it down to hang the Jersey.  She yelled at me and told me it isn't even working.   Solution - I hung the Jersey from the Dining Room light fixture.  It has not moved since. Result: 3 Wins in a row.

We dominated the league for multiple years with him as our main guy, but unfortunately all coaches have a shelf life, and it was just time for both the organization and him to move on. I still think about what could have been done instead of firing AV, like firing Mike Gillis first, but I know that in order to get to where we are today, sacrifices had to be made."

rangers,360ce3,ESEADupes,12,Fri May 15 01:03:16 2015 UTC,There's a ton of hate for messier in /r/hockey. The Vancouver fans really come out with their pitchforks anytime he is mentioned.

rangers,360ce3,m4tuna,8,Fri May 15 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"Well when kreider is hated more than guys like Corey perry, you can throw non-bias out the window. Canada dominates hockey talk. So if a canadien team hates something, eventually people jump the bandwagon. That's what I've noticed in that sub anyway. Price is the best goalie since ever, Toronto is the butt end of every joke, kreider is literally satan, so is messier. Just a few that come to my mind."
rangers,360ce3,ronton_soup_,3,Fri May 15 17:39:09 2015 UTC,The Kreider hate is intense and ridiculous for sure. Habs fans do NOT want to let that go. I forget if it was a Pens or Caps GDT but there were almost as many shitty Habs fans in the thread as fans of the team we were playing against.

Although we're also mad at him for cheap shotting a defenceless Linden in the dying seconds of the 6th game of the 1994 SCF, injuring him even further.  Pretty good write-up on him.  TL;DR: Messier is a PoS who deserves no respect from Canucks fans.  PS. Also, it's ridiculous to call him the ""second best player of all time""."

rangers,3622bp,iamsmrtk,3,Fri May 15 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"Bull shit. So does every player who turns their back to a player when near the boards. Boyle was skating, had his head up, and orpik gave a high RISING hit. Not to mention that orpik is a repeat offender. And he tried to do the same hit twice earlier in the game on Hags and Marty. He was trying to destroy someone with a high hit. That has no place in the game anymore with evidence of CTE and horror stories resulting from concussions."
rangers,3622bp,dakraiz,0,Fri May 15 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"Bull shit. So does every player who turns their back to a player when near the boards.   Yea, and rarely do we see the DoPS come down on instances like that. With Boyle skating at practice today, there's no way they do anything.  I'd also argue that the hit wasn't high, a brutal hit maybe, but certainly not high. Boyle was skating with his head down, around the level of Orpik's elbow, there's no way the DoPS does anything about it.  And I don't remember the Hags hit but the one that Marty barely dodged didn't seem like it would've been a high hit to me. It would've been big, but I don't think it was high."
rangers,3622bp,iamsmrtk,6,Fri May 15 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"Principal contact was the head and Orpik was elevating upwards with that hit instead of following through the body. He could have easily rocked Boyle into the boards and taken the body. If it was another player without a history of injuring players I would give him the benefit of the doubt but he is a fucking piece of shit.   I hate Milbury like the rest of us but he is right. Watch highlights of Orpik and he goes for the hit on unsuspecting defenseless players. And he does it up high. There is no place in the game for these hits. Football wisened up, and Hockey needs to do the same  Hit on Kane with Milbury rant  Attempt to injure boarding  Knee to knee on Franzen  Knee on knee to Stepan  High hit on defenseless Skinner"
rangers,3622bp,dakraiz,3,Fri May 15 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"That knee to the head had nothing to do with Orpik, that was James Neal. He did lay a nasty hit earlier in that game, and he pussed out when Thornton tried to fight him which is why Thornton went after him here.  Not that I disagree with your larger point. Orpik is a piece of shit."

rangers,35y2b0,potatojoey,7,Thu May 14 15:44:01 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I knew how Dom played before he lost his wife, but I feel like he plays his heart out for her every night. I've never once seen him quit on a play, the man plays with such vigor and clearly lacks fear. One of my favorite Rangers for sure."
rangers,35y2b0,ajayaday,5,Thu May 14 22:19:41 2015 UTC,when he lost his stick he put his whole body into defense and was decently effective. V impressive.
rangers,35y2b0,MagicSeat,4,Thu May 14 15:16:24 2015 UTC,I love Dom Moore. He has been killing it during the end of the season and the playoffs.   I hope he stays with the Rangers for a while this time.
rangers,35y2b0,pappy511,5,Thu May 14 17:46:57 2015 UTC,I thought it was such a slap in the face when they only brought him back for 1Y/1M...and then Glass got the multiyear deal for more $ as a newcomer.  We gotta take care of him this offseason.  True Ranger.
rangers,35y2b0,DJCrinkleCut,4,Thu May 14 17:49:29 2015 UTC,He's definitely one of my favorite players. I swear every time he was on the ice I remarked to myself how good he was playing.   I should buy a Moore jersey.
rangers,35y2b0,SleepYourLifeAway,1 point,Thu May 14 18:31:52 2015 UTC,What's his contract situation?  If he's going to be around for a while I think Moore will be my next one too.
rangers,35y2b0,DJCrinkleCut,2,Fri May 15 07:13:55 2015 UTC,"We got him for another year.   He shouldn't be too expensive, so we damn well better resign him."
rangers,35y2b0,Juicecoder,3,Fri May 15 13:27:01 2015 UTC,He was a beast last night. He came to play.
rangers,35y2b0,thedeutschbag,3,Thu May 14 15:00:44 2015 UTC,"I want to see him sneak a nice goal past Bishop. If someone deserves it, it's him"
rangers,35y2b0,DicNavis,3,Thu May 14 15:30:30 2015 UTC,I wanted that backhander to be the winner so badly.  Hagelin blasted his man off the puck and Moore swooped in with a head of steam.  Would have been an epic one.
rangers,35y2b0,joliedame,3,Thu May 14 16:12:01 2015 UTC,He's an inspiration to me for obvious reasons... I love Dom.

rangers,35y2b0,m4tuna,2,Thu May 14 17:16:17 2015 UTC,I kinda wanted D Moore to be the hero last night. Dude was the hardest working skater in last night's game. Tremendous night for that dude.
rangers,35y2b0,SleepYourLifeAway,2,Thu May 14 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"I know it was ESPN, and ESPN doesn't know LeBron's ass from a hole in the ground, but christ I can't believe they gave Comeback Player of the Year to fuckin Russell Westbrook over Dom last year.  I remember Hank presenting that award and looking pissed off when they read Westbrook's name.  They redeemed themselves a little with the E:60 piece about his wife and him."

rangers,360x92,NJ_Yankees_Fan,6,Fri May 15 04:05:23 2015 UTC,"Tampa fan:   We are a weird and inconsistent team. I think the reason we struggled against the Detroit mainly because we were being out coached, Coops only got 2.5 years in the NHL.   Hard to argue with 4-6  Bishop is capable of being average at worst, but when he is on we feel safe with him in the net"
rangers,360x92,coop72,3,Fri May 15 04:46:55 2015 UTC,"To say I'm not scared of tampa would be a lie. However, they have looked human this postseason at times.  I think we can win, but it'll have to be the hardest we have ever played. Anything less will result in a loss."
rangers,360x92,arunnair87,1 point,Fri May 15 10:35:17 2015 UTC,I think if both teams play the best and hardest they can this will be an amazing 7 game series

rangers,360x92,ronton_soup_,4,Fri May 15 04:11:00 2015 UTC,"I would like to switch MSL and hagelin on their lines. I feel like between hags speed and play on the boards, he can really open up shots for Nash. Nash can draw enough defenders for hagelin to use his speed. Idk, I'd like to see it."
rangers,360x92,steel438692,4,Fri May 15 04:56:30 2015 UTC,I thought Hagelin was playing his best hockey all season this past series against the Caps
rangers,360x92,ronton_soup_,2,Fri May 15 05:04:08 2015 UTC,He played very well all playoffs. As he has done since he's been on the team. Him and kreider really step it up in the playoffs. But that kreider line is playing so well I wouldn't touch it at all. Put hagelin with Nash and try to establish a dominate 1st/2nd line again.
rangers,360x92,steel438692,1 point,Fri May 15 17:35:29 2015 UTC,Agree 100%
rangers,360x92,irishguy42,3,Sat May 16 02:32:34 2015 UTC,This is a 6 or 7 game series. I don't think either team has it in them to pull a 4 or 5 game series win over the other.
rangers,360x92,wellfuckme_right,2,Fri May 15 13:21:28 2015 UTC,"6 is my guess too. We need to score goals, and get healthy.   Zucc comes back in games 6 and gets a hat trick."
rangers,360x92,hman1025,2,Fri May 15 04:50:01 2015 UTC,"either 6 or 7, but an exchanging wins 7 instead of a comeback 7. I think it will be hard for either team to win more than 2 in a row."

rangers,360x92,LIGuy631,1 point,Fri May 15 12:55:02 2015 UTC,"We didn't have Stepan or McDonagh when we played them, and Hayes was only in his first month in the NHL.  We're a much better team than we were then.  Also, Bishop isn't nearly the goaltender that Holtby is, so expect to see our boys scoring more goals.  While I don't think we're going to sweep the Bolts, I do think that the Caps were probably our toughest opponents during this SC run."

rangers,360x92,beavedaniels,4,Fri May 15 04:27:35 2015 UTC,This guy!
rangers,360x92,irishguy42,3,Fri May 15 07:19:23 2015 UTC,"Despite the amount of blocked shots in the last series, we did a good job more than half the time in getting shots on net. If we can keep the pressure up, we can do this.  TB plays a different style of game than the Caps. I think we'll be able to get a lot more chances to score than last series, whereas last series, they were constantly blocking and checking hard, really preventing us from getting close or do much aside from at the point."

rangers,35yaui,Dewwk,2,Fri May 15 00:24:20 2015 UTC,"A, it'd be a real feather for the organization to have both an NHL and AHL team go deep. B, look at the AHL Grads who are big parts of our team; Captain Mac, Zucc, Cam (I got to see him do a Playoff shutout game live at the XL Center, that was fun), Miller and Kreider all played real time in the AHL learning the trade. And that's just the Wolfpack - Klein played for the Admirals, Yandle with the Rampage. The AHL is where the next generation comes from. It's silly to say that it's unimportant."

rangers,35wl44,CaptainObvious_1,18,Thu May 14 03:10:01 2015 UTC,I don't ever want to hear Rangers fans say we're out of it until we're actually out of it. So many people gave up after game 4. I didn't even come to this subreddit for game 5 because of all the negativity.  This Rangers team have proved they never say never and don't quit in the face of extreme adversity.
rangers,35wl44,C_L_I_C_K,39,Thu May 14 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"Congratulations lads. The Rangers winning this series is 3x sweet for the Flames  1) that lazy, selfish prick Curtis Glencross gets no further.  2) the two picks we got for Glencross are about five picks earlier in the draft than they would have been if the no caps had made it through.  3) the Rangers have a better chance of knocking those no-good cheating bastards from Tampa out of the cup.  and bonus #4, our man Johnny G's best mate is one of your crew.  Best of luck stomping the Bolts! Everyone in Calgary's pulling for you."

Our lake had a rope swing, one time while one of my friends was climbing out of the water, this idiot girl decided to just go off the rope.  She didn't even think to yell ""watch out"" until basically the last second.  My friend had just enough time to look up, and her knee got him right in the center of his forehead.  He was out for like 30 seconds, and when he got up this one douchbag was standing over and yelled ""YOOO son you're bitch ass just got cracked"".  This gif reminds me of that day. good times."

rangers,35wlpq,tj_sad_boi_666,30,Thu May 14 03:03:35 2015 UTC,LOL yeah dude he made that guarantee to disgrace Messier's name. It definitely wasn't to rally his teammates after 2 bad losses.

rangers,35wlpq,tj_sad_boi_666,10,Thu May 14 03:09:33 2015 UTC,Honestly when he scored that fucking ridiculous goal in game 2 I'm pretty sure I even got excited a bit. He is disgustingly good. No question he deserves to win one.
rangers,35wlpq,C_L_I_C_K,-12,Thu May 14 03:10:39 2015 UTC,I would feel sorry for Ovi if he wasn't such a dirty player and if he didn't talk so much shit this series.
rangers,35wlpq,speedk0re,3,Thu May 14 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're getting downvoted.  You don't score on our goalie and say ""ALL SERIES BABY ALL SERIES"" to him, then expect me to feel sorry for you when you lose to that goalie.  No denying he's a great player, but he can go fuck himself.  And like /u/Darclite mentioned below, if he wasn't a star forward he'd have amassed quite a few suspensions by this point."
rangers,35wlpq,C_L_I_C_K,2,Thu May 14 21:37:11 2015 UTC,"Meh, I couldn't care less about downvotes or upvotes. I just speak my mind.   I think this thread is filled with a bunch of pansy Ovi / Caps sympathizers who either forgot about all of the dirty hits Ovi has taken on the Rangers in past playoff games or they're new / casual fans who have no clue about Ovi's history of being a dirty player. Ovi didn't play as dirty as I've seen him in the past, but he still took a few runs at Rangers this series. He talked shit to Hank and guaranteed a series win, but failed once again to make it past the 2nd round of the playoffs (I think this is the 9th or 10th year he's failed to do so). Guy is a pompous scumbag and shouldn't deserve any Ranger fan's sympathy.   Ovechkin is a great scorer, there's no denying that. But that's all he does well. He doesn't help his line forecheck. He doesn't hustle to backcheck or play any defense. He almost never passes the puck unless he's being double teamed. All he does is conserve his energy, sit in a corner by himself, and try find open ice so he can get shots. He's a selfish player through and through. People love to criticize Nash for not scoring in the playoffs, but Nash is a much better overall player than Ovi will ever be."
rangers,35wlpq,Darclite,4,Thu May 14 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm with this. Long history of borderline plays, lots of high hits, charges, and boards that would be more scrutinized and more heavily punished if he wasn't a star forward.

We went the second time a few days later to meet some of her friends, the night of the Game 5 OT win over the Penguins. We were there again last Friday after we left our regular bar because there was a awful band playing. Again, the Rangers win in OT and then I finally realize that I have been at this bar for every Rangers OT goal in this playoffs.

rangers,35wkyo,angrye,4,Thu May 14 03:01:52 2015 UTC,"Fellas, for anyone who talks about the 3-0 record against the Rangers: it means nothing, and not just because of the whole ""postseason is a different animal"" argument. No McDonagh for 2/3 (he returned the game before the final TBL game), the team was simply lost (as they usually are at the beginning of the season under AV), and Tampa was the hottest team in the league. Playing Tampa three times in eight games doesn't show growth.   It's worth noting that the Rangers gave up 12 penalties in those 3 games and the Lightning had a success rate of 33%. The Rangers gave up 12 penalties through 6 (SIX!) games to the Capitals, the best PP team in the regular season. Through those 6, the Caps converted once, in the very first game. Bishop has made strides this season and Hank is Hank. The Lightning is a great team that has earned its right to be in the ECF, but any H2H comparisons with the Rangers do a disservice to the debate.   Let's savor the win tonight! So proud of the boys. LGR"

rangers,35wlx0,jordansideas,16,Thu May 14 02:58:47 2015 UTC,Guys I'm actually worried about this series.
rangers,35wlx0,tj_sad_boi_666,9,Thu May 14 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"TAMPA BAY IS REALLY GOOD AGAINST US, OUR RECORD AGAINST THEM IN RECENT YEARS ISN'T GREAT. THAT SAID, RANGERS IN 4 LGR!"
rangers,35wlx0,sizeablescars,2,Thu May 14 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"Rangers have a better defense than the Canadiens did, and while Price was the best player on the ice this season, he wasn't the best against Tampa. NYR has shown they can handle Crosby & Malkin and OV & Backstrom. Lightning are deep though and great offensively. Rangers have the defensive edge and have better goaltending. See this definitely going 6, if not 7. Should be another great series"
rangers,35wlx0,NYSportsGuy4,1 point,Thu May 14 04:02:55 2015 UTC,Idk I think their depth is gonna kill us. Their defensive depth probably isn't as good but their top pairing is gonna be hard to beat.
rangers,35wlx0,tj_sad_boi_666,2,Thu May 14 04:12:50 2015 UTC,we haven't played them since we got new pick ups. Playoffs are a different beast. PLUS there is no Callahan. idk what it is about him but he always plays SO good against us
rangers,35wlx0,Alona8,1 point,Thu May 14 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"He is already back on the ice practicing, the man doesn't know how to quit."
rangers,35wlx0,beavedaniels,1 point,Thu May 14 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm more worried about Palat - Johnson - Kucherov tbh. We don't really have an answer for that in terms of our forward group."
rangers,35wlx0,tj_sad_boi_666,1 point,Thu May 14 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"That may be but you've got to have faith. Tampa's incredibly talented but the Rangers have been here before. Three times now for that matter. Tampa and its core are new to this even though the team made it to the ECF in 2011. Besides, who knows how to defend Cally and Boyler better than Mac, Danny G, and Marc? Rangers need to do a good job with not committing penalties like those 3 games against Tampa but they have been much better since then. Important for the Rangers not to get behind 3-1 as Tampa hasn't lost 3 in a row this year"
rangers,35wlx0,NYSportsGuy4,2,Thu May 14 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"Our regular season would show that you guys might not be a huge challenge for us, but we also should have demolished the Canadiens based on our regular season. We have been very shakey in these playoffs and I'm hoping the Rangers don't take advantage of that"
rangers,35wlx0,WAR_T0RN1226,1 point,Thu May 14 14:46:09 2015 UTC,"I see Tampa as a threat (I'd be a fool not to) but I have been very surprised by the team's performance in the postseason. Going the distance against Detroit and like you said with the Canadiens showing some real signs of life throughout the whole series shocked me. Price was the best goalie (best player) this season but his overrated defense simply couldn't help him. I believe the Rangers' defense and the red-hot Lundqvist, who has only played 58 games this season, will be huge factors in trying to stop TBL. I think the biggest mismatch in this series is the Rangers offense to Tampa's defense (which isn't bad by any means), but if Stammers and the triplets are on their game the Rangers will be in trouble"
rangers,35wlx0,NYSportsGuy4,2,Fri May 15 17:33:43 2015 UTC,I'm utterly terrified
rangers,35wlx0,lucidorlarsson,15,Thu May 14 15:21:45 2015 UTC,Can we put Ovi's face on the pawn?
rangers,35wlx0,AConcernedMan,13,Thu May 14 02:59:33 2015 UTC,Crosby on the queen?
rangers,35wlx0,ZombieSpaceWolf,11,Thu May 14 03:17:57 2015 UTC,thought about it but i didn't want to alienate the female fans of the sub by doing that
rangers,35wlx0,ZombieSpaceWolf,9,Thu May 14 03:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'm 35, I don't belong on here anyway"
rangers,35wlx0,cromo1969,3,Thu May 14 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, the Queen is the strongest piece..."
rangers,35wlx0,LittleMissLokii,2,Thu May 14 03:58:06 2015 UTC,"so it shouldnt be crosby because we already showed he can be shut down, along with Ovi.  that would just be an insult to the ladies ;D"

rangers,35wlx0,Nether_Ending,2,Thu May 14 06:13:59 2015 UTC,"All the games Tampa won against them this season were all before early December, this team didn't hit their full stride until well after that.  I think it's a good matchup"
rangers,35wlx0,Tenziru,2,Thu May 14 13:55:50 2015 UTC,This is cute; but its time to dethrone the king ;)  good luck in ECF
rangers,35wlx0,Nether_Ending,19,Thu May 14 02:59:27 2015 UTC,Hey!!.....fuck you guys!  Let's have a good series.
rangers,35wlx0,irishguy42,6,Thu May 14 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"shhh that can wait till saturday ;D  Should be good, both teams like to play fast. Glad you guys made it I hate psychical teams they slow everything down."
rangers,35wlx0,mytwocentsshowmanyss,5,Thu May 14 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. Physical teams like the caps really piss me off. Usually results in injuries. This series should be amazing to watch."
rangers,35wlx0,NYRxCorona,2,Thu May 14 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Right?!  Everyone will be flying this series, now that the goonies are out of the way!"
rangers,35wmp7,Teddie1056,39,Thu May 14 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"Here's how palpitating this series was:  The two teams played 7 hours, 21 minutes, and one second of hockey.  For only 32 minutes and 49 seconds was there more than a one-goal lead. The only three-goal lead was for 3 minutes and 16 seconds.  The two teams were tied or within one goal of each other for 92.66% of the time (6 hours, 48 minutes, and 12 seconds).  The breakdown:  Rangers had a one-goal lead for 1 hour, 36 minutes, 10 seconds (21.81%)  Capitals had a one-goal lead for 1 hour, 30 minutes, 12 seconds (20.45%)  The teams were tied for 3 hours, 41 minutes, and 50 seconds (50.30%)"

Or they think of pretentious new yorkers who are rude and fast paced hipsters even though most people in New York are wonderful human beings. They just believe the stereotypes.

No faulty gloves or easy goals. Everything was fought for. Old school hockey.  Trots is your AV."

rangers,35wnkf,Super_Sic58,5,Thu May 14 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"hey, if the caps had won, it'd be damn well earned. that was one hell of a series and one hell of a game 7."
rangers,35wnkf,shredmasterJ,5,Thu May 14 03:49:56 2015 UTC,It's quite nice to not completely shit the bed this time around.  Baby steps and all.  I had a really bad feeling after we didn't score on that massive press we had in the middle of the OT period.  Three or four prime chances there that just wouldn't go.
rangers,35wnkf,fredagostino,6,Thu May 14 03:52:34 2015 UTC,"went to school down in DC, have a friend who actually writes for RMNB blog (shares a name with one of NYR players, ironically enough)   you guys are a dedicated fanbase and a great team. if you weren't in our division, i'd totally be pulling for you through the season  now grab a big bottle of booze, an AED and come enjoy Rangers hockey with us"
rangers,35xp5j,juice_noose,5,Thu May 14 11:37:26 2015 UTC,Awesome.   Also shout out to the guys in /r/Devils and /r/newyorkislanders who had their 'Rags lose. Rags suck.' posts ready to roll during OT then had to delete it. That had to sting.

rangers,35x231,mattmatt93,3,Thu May 14 08:38:02 2015 UTC,I shaved my beard after game four and we won every game since
rangers,35x231,Rib-I,7,Thu May 14 09:02:59 2015 UTC,I kept mine and we won. Gotta keep the faith!

rangers,35x04p,cstevens727,15,Thu May 14 05:25:36 2015 UTC,Hayes and fast will be the future of the Rangers. Throw in hags krieder and Steph we got a solid future up an coming
rangers,35x04p,NjJoe,8,Thu May 14 05:46:18 2015 UTC,"Even Miller, dude!  He's still going through some growing pains but you can tell he's figuring it out."
rangers,35x04p,penguinrockr222,3,Thu May 14 12:55:30 2015 UTC,Miller has been close so many times.
rangers,35x04p,irishguy42,3,Thu May 14 14:25:53 2015 UTC,haven't you heard? we traded our future away! /s
rangers,35x04p,Djbearjew,3,Thu May 14 13:55:33 2015 UTC,u talking bout duclair?
rangers,35x04p,NjJoe,7,Thu May 14 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Tonight's OT goal and the Game 5 OT goal are two that I can think of offhand that were plays started/generated by Fast.   That Kreider-Step-Fast line looked great this series, too."
rangers,35x04p,subterraneanbunnypig,3,Thu May 14 05:41:26 2015 UTC,Fast started the first goal of game 6 too.
rangers,35x04p,Superjam83,6,Thu May 14 11:18:58 2015 UTC,He's been solid in every single game. His hockey IQ is seriously impressive. And he definitely deserves an assist for the GWG tonight. I love this kid. Check the flair.
rangers,35x04p,isthatyoujohnwayne_,7,Thu May 14 05:27:46 2015 UTC,Fast has been on the ice for all OT goals this postseason
rangers,35x04p,EarnSquirm,4,Thu May 14 09:12:39 2015 UTC,"damn..didn't even think of this.  We're 4-0 in OT, that's pretty awesome!  I love this team!"
rangers,35x04p,LGR1994,3,Thu May 14 13:46:13 2015 UTC,One of our best forwards in the series no doubt. So smart and reliable and does all of the little things needed to win in the playoffs. Could be the next Zetterberg if he keeps developing like this.
rangers,35x04p,Itrx,1 point,Thu May 14 06:38:12 2015 UTC,"Dude really stepped it up this series.  I hope he keeps it up.  Between him, Hayes and Miller, I see good things ahead for the Rangers.  All 3 of them are going to turn into great players methinks."
rangers,35x04p,LIGuy631,1 point,Thu May 14 16:13:02 2015 UTC,It's like having a second Hagelin out there... They both augment their natural skating ability with exceptional reads and constant effort.

rangers,35x2kb,Rocketman_man,8,Thu May 14 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm taking it as a good sign he's not shut up in a dark, quiet room"
rangers,35x2kb,juice_noose,4,Thu May 14 06:58:06 2015 UTC,Don't touch his brain bucket.
rangers,35x2kb,fosiacat,2,Thu May 14 11:41:06 2015 UTC,"oh good, i was wondering if he did"
rangers,35x2kb,irishguy42,2,Thu May 14 13:38:56 2015 UTC,The fact that he's out there for a prolonged period of time...with all the flashing lights and the loud noise...that's a great sign for Boyle.  Dude is a beast. Angry Grandpa Boyle will crush the Bolts.
