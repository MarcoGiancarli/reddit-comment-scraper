It's obviously inspired by anther person, and it's so beautiful to read about the great things that one person sees in another. I think it would flow better if you formatted it so it wasn't all one big paragraph, but the language is very descriptive. I really enjoy how none of her physical attributes are described except for her blemishes, and how they make her perfect. The ending is a little unsatisfying, but I like it. It's like a cliffhanger, promising more. It reminds me of how love always feels at the beginning. ""But together..."" Well that's for you to find out. Good work :)"

OCPoetry,3e2zgg,purpleliving,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"That last line says it all. Beautiful. I enjoyed reading this. The descriptions were deep, meaningful, and no cliche. The only cliche part was    But her imperfections are perfection.   This is in almost every love song/love poem every. Other than that, you stayed away from the cliche. I personally want to thank you for that.   Flawless writing. The lack of line breaks or any type of white space makes me just read through this like the characterization passage in a short story. Without the white space or some type of formatting, I think this poem loses its magical quality. I don't know which words are weighted which are emphasized. I'm not tantalized to see what is next but it all just trails together.   I would through in more imagery. Not just sight; tough, taste, smell, etc.   Great word choice nonetheless. Other than that, great writing."

OCPoetry,3e11jl,Demon_Marionette,2,Tue Jul 21 10:48:15 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. I love the short lines' economy.   There's plenty of tension between the imagination and the senses, between stillness and movement.   Centrally: The idea of ""slipped through his fingers"" forces the reader to move toward the idea of regret. Then ""last he counted/stopping at seventy-six"" pushes us toward resignation.  That central movement is surrounded by ""dead,"" ""cold,"" ""after sunset,"" the ghostly white glow, and the poem's subject then, resigned, allowing himself to be conveyed forward (forward in the poem, but maybe back. Back as in back to a more familiar place of home and home cooking and, following the conceit, past/away from a learned love lost) toward the more instinctual and familiar pleasures.  Maybe I had to read a lot into the poem to get there. I don't know.   My only thought for a change would be to consider painting the thing in present tense. I don't particularly think you would need to shift from past to present between the poem's two parts (""Dead ... fingers."" and ""That was ... fish."") The poem would articulate in a crystalline way in present tense. Play with that idea.  Another thought: The poem is 14 lines. A magical line count for poets. Any poet that reads your poem will count the lines and go... ""Hmm... I wonder if he was thinking about sonnets.) Your poem ALMOST breaks in a Petrarchan fashion. (octet -> sestet) While a modern poet would be foolish (melodramatic statement) to suggest shoving your diction into the rhyme scheme of a Petrarchan sonnet, I think it would be a wonderful treat to have the poem break in that fashion. Just a thought.  I enjoyed spending some time with your poem. Keep writing!"

All literature requires some kind of ""conflict"" and here there isn't one explicit, but I feel like there's so many things it could be.  The first and most obvious is how the boy is playing ""she loves me, she loves me not"" which opens up a whole can of worms about youthful love and whatnot.   It still really enjoyed the read, it had that resonating quality that when you finish it, it kind of hums, like you see that last scene before your eyes and kind of think about what happens after that."

Starting each stanza with a line about ""My shadow"" connects each thought to all the others, changing the perspective while reminding of the previous stanzas. This poem is a perfect picture of the loneliness of night, but also the beauties and uniqueness of the solitude.      I really enjoy how the first stanza focuses on the landscape and scenery without, and then the poem gradually shifts. By the end, it is describing the inward thoughts of the writer, completely focused on the individual and no longer on the outward atmosphere. Despite this shift of focus, the poem still maintains the original feel, which nicely ties together the ideas about the ""sticky thoughts of loneliness"" to the beauty and the unique sights of the night.     Good work! :)"

In the first stanza, you have lots of really great descriptive extra additions, like ""huffy airport farewells/ choked with tears, snot cascades,""  and similar.  My opinion on these is to clearly separate them out with dashes or parenthesis or whatever mark you find appropriate.    The second stanza I'm not as much of a fan of.  The fact the poem ends on ""hello"" and is called goodbye is really resonating which I do like.  It lacks the kind of vividness you give in the first.    Overall, not a bad poem.  Very nice job."

I don't really like the word 'tryst' in this context - it doesn't fit with 'stories' and 'shows', to me.  from the line ""til now"" on, it reads more like prose to me, or like a rambling thought that doesn't fit in with the rest of the poem. The rest of the poem is written in short sentence fragments or remarks and suddenly this bit is very proper and conversational   and it makes me think: Is it because I've stayed inside, stopped letting others in? Is it because I've started closing doors before even saying hello?    So I think the sentence structures of the last few lines detract from the poem."

The highlight for me is the ""til now""; it has a finality to it which changes the tone of the poem. Someone else suggested that the lines after that don't fit with the rest of the poem, and I agree to some extent, but I don't think that's a problem. In fact, the poem seems to me to progress fairly logically from chaotic half thoughts at the top (""closing chapters"", ""pulling curtains"", for instance, both excellent examples of a ""goodbye"" that wouldn't have occurred to me) through more literal descriptions (""walking out with shame and closing the door behind"") before finally arriving at a crux of the matter, the key question (""Is it because...?""). It's an unspoken thought that needs to be unearthed like the bones of a dinosaur, only being spoken when the thoughts around it have been cleared out.  I wonder if there isn't something missing, though, in terms of what makes this goodbye different. Why is it this one where the protagonist feels something has changed. Is this something that's just hit her (or his, indeed, but I'm assuming ""her"")? When? Is it after a ""okay, see you!"" in a coffee shop, or after a first date from a dating website that just didn't mean anything?  Maybe it's not important-- the poem stands without it and I certainly don't think there's a need for a specific instance to be described-- but there's a leap from the first stanza of ""goodbyes in general"" to the second one of ""why is it now so different?"". I feel there's potentially a place either between the stanzas or between ""til now"" and ""and it makes me think"" to play a little more with the trigger for the poem.  Of course, this is just a vague thought and not in any sense a criticism of a lovely piece of work. Thanks!"

Thus let me live, unseen, unknown  Thus unlamented let me die;  Steal from the world, and not a stone Tell where I lie.   The ""I hope I die"", that casual confession, and ""I envy the ones who burn out unspectacularly"", they're beautiful. I can' t even say exactly what's so good about those lines, but they're absolutely beautiful. I personally took it to kind of mean that because of your friendship, neither one of you dying would be unspectacular/unimportant because there would be one of you still alive, feeling the weight of the loss.

OCPoetry,3dukl1,jiamixiexie,3,Sun Jul 19 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"A few of your rhymes are a little tenuous. 'game,' and 'again,'; 'chaos,' and 'for us,'; 'vivid,' and 'stupid,' are the ones that popped out.  For the first rhyme, perhaps something like:   ""'Don't write another bad love poem, stupid!' Has been my one refrain There are already so many out there Yet here I am again""   Of course, it changes the sense of the stanza a little, but it's a truer rhyme than game/again. I also switched up the adverb's position in the third line, as the line seems to run more smoothly if it's not at the end.  The second set is a little trickier to work on, since without punctuation, the meaning of the stanza is unclear, but I'll run it how I read it.   ""I enjoy the sound of your breath. And in this tumultuous space, This house that billions share, We've carved ourselves a place.""   Again, the absence of punctuation makes it hard to know how you want the line to be read, but I gave it a fair shot. I changed a couple other things to help bring out the sense you're going for.  For the third set:   ""But till I better words can find, Or make a friend of Cupid I'll put my pen to paper: Here's your dumb love poem, stupid.""     The problem with rhyming 'vivid' and 'stupid' (sort of applies to 'chaos/for us' as well), as I see it, is that both words are pronounced with a stress on their first syllables, not their second. So although their final syllables match up, the rhyme still comes off awkwardly when you read the poem because you stress 'vi-' in 'vivid,' and 'stu-' in 'stupid.' Looking into 'feminine rhyme' might also help explain why the rhyme didn't work here.  At any rate, those are my major critiques. Take them with a grain of salt. I like your fourth and fifth stanzas very much. You might look into incorporating rhythm and metre into your poem--many of the most famous love poems in English use rhythm and metre to great effect, and it can give a poem that extra touch it needs to make a girl smile.  Here's a love poem by WB Yeats which I read recently that you might like."
OCPoetry,3dukl1,Arkellian_Pilot,3,Sun Jul 19 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"A) Deviate from standard rhyme schemes. Check out Spenser's sonnet scheme - ABAB BCBC CDCD EE -  Use a different one per day until the ABAB is gone.  Then forget all of the rhyming schemes and make your own.  Then go back to ABAB.  B) This point follows my first, but speaks to the idea of your poem.  You criticize Roses and Red, Violets are Blue ideas in corny love songs and poems while using one of the most standard formulas.  There is nothing wrong with the standard formula... consider just about any set of Beatles lyrics as an example.  If you want to be out of the box, look at E.E. Cummings.  Being corny the appropriate amount has much power.    C)  Keep it up!  No one has the balls to write anymore.  D) Write with your own pen and an empty notebook.

Some other people here are recommending you try and make more true rhymes, but I think that with the content of your poem in particular, it wouldn't help.   I think that where you do have true rhymes (such as in the second and third stanza) you should change it to be more faux rhymes. Most of what you right is fairly colloquial, with no devotion to either assonance or cacophony. So there's my opinion, more rugged rhymes."
OCPoetry,3dukl1,Chesapeake_Gentleman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"I like the way the poem is written, I can almost hear the change in tone from stanza to stanza. I like the way you used words that almost rhymed rather than fully rhymed here and there, I think it gives your poem a bit of tenseness, that gives the true rhymes a satisfactory release."

OCPoetry,3dvhci,dkenshu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"I love the flow of the first few lines especially!  Best lines are definitel ""her smile inviting/but still fifteen"". If you change everything else remember to leave that line alone, it's beautiful.   I think in these lines :""I calmly say To her waiting gaze""   Waiting might not be the best word but i'm not sure why. I think there's an opportunity to expand the 9already beautiful) meaning in those lines.   I know it fits the rhyme shceme...but ""to what was she"" sounds a little awkward. Jus' saying."

OCPoetry,3dv2i4,RosesRead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"Overall I liked it. The general meaning/message was a little hard to figure out, especially in the first stanza. However, that's definitely not a bad thing, it just means it's more of a challenge to interpret - it forces you to think.   I definitely picked up on some political/social themes. The middle stanza seems to be describing issues prevalent in modern society, like obesity and income inequality. I like how you really tried to reflect how stuck/caught the middle class is. I assume you intentionally put those particular lines in the middle of the poem? You mention three classes, the poor, middle, and rich. Is that the scheme you were going for, with the first stanza representing the poor, and so on?    You get your news from the puppets    A criticism of bias and partiality in the media?   I think you're touching on some good ideas, and the poem currently has a good general structure. The thing I would really suggest is for you to look back at some lines, particularly the ones in the first stanza, and see if you could rewrite them in a way that reveals more about what you're really trying to say."
OCPoetry,3dv2i4,kantianspaghetti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:25:24 2015 UTC,"I coded the first half as more corporate problems  Computer/tech problems- Blue screen of death, Microsoft, Apple, Selfies as a reflection of reality  Greedy economy problems- McDonalds, Walmart, Big Oil  Middle (yes, intentional)- I'm incredibly hungry and broke at the moment, so this one fit.  But the rich folks have the money to eat and the poor folks (of course a generalization) can't afford proper food and obesity becomes a problem  You figured out the last bit pretty well.  The thing is that I wanted it to be slightly thought provoking and hard to figure out.  The theme is greed and how that hurts everybody."

OCPoetry,3dsyz6,dinozaurs,2,Sun Jul 19 03:59:33 2015 UTC,"I see what you're going for, but I feel that it's too short to make a meaningful impact given what you've written. Generally a short poem will use double entendre or deeper meaning to make up for its length. This one doesn't really do that. I'd be happy to talk with you over what you were feeling when you wrote it.   It's a good (first?) effort though you've definitely got the rhythym portion of it down. 8 syllables in eace line is how i wrote my first poems as well. Modern poetry these days doesn;t seem to be as concerned with the sing song nature anymore.   Suggesstions:   1. Add some imagery. I can't see  where you're going or what you're leaving from.    vary the rhythm octo-syllabic lines are cute but not really ""in"" right now"
OCPoetry,3dsyz6,Doublerolls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:20:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the critique. I wrote the first two lines a week ago because it made sense to me, and I wrote the last two lines last night, because I thought it flowed well. This poem really isn't meant to be meaningful, it's just short and it rhymes. You're supposed to make what you want to make of it, decide for yourself what it means. It's supposed to be imaginative, if that makes any sense. If it sounds too general or it doesn't seem deep, that's because it isn't deep and because it is general. As for the rhythm, I'm not too concerned about what's in right now, I'd rather write the way I want to write. I don't mean to come off defensive, I do appreciate your suggestions."
OCPoetry,3dsyz6,DragonLadyoftheWest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"It feels a little basic. 'Car' is rather specific, and makes the poem feel lackluster; there is a lack of imagery/compelling storyline to keep the reader invested in the prose. It's an interesting thread to have, but altogether it feels somewhat stunted in its growth and development of meaning."
OCPoetry,3dsyz6,laughterful,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. It's meant to be a basic poem, a Shel Silverstein-esque poem. It's short, it rhymes, and you can make what you want of it. I'll admit that it lacks a lot of elements a poem normally has, like imagery, storyline, emotions, etc., but it is meant to be a basic poem, something you don't have to think too hard about.

OCPoetry,3dsxui,EmilyEggplant,2,Sun Jul 19 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"Nine degrees Celsius in the morning, In-between the middle and end of November, the first drops of an overdue drizzle tinker onto the snaggletoothed roof of a mobile home in faded periwinkle.   Oooh. Nice, playful opening. I like it: really gently brings you into the poem.  From here, I got really drawn into the poem, and invested in it.  Strong as hell.  You call upon these images, and you might want a title that does the same. BUT! There are dozens of poetic sounding poem titles. In my opinion, the best titles are the simplest ones. Not motivated by sounding pretty, but simply stating what the poem is. You don't need a mysterious or engaging title really, you have that in your poem.  I suggest, and forgive me if you dissagree, something along the lines of ""A house in the morning rain"". Exciting? Engaging? Well no. Not really. But sometimes, and I think that this is the case, the mythos and story of the poem cannot be captured by something poetic. You capture the story and the nuance within the poem. The title is to capture the poem. SO? A House in the Morning Rain. A house, any house. And morning and rain both call upon enough thought to be interesting. That's my opinion, do what you will with it"
OCPoetry,3dsxui,Chesapeake_Gentleman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"I really like the words ""house in the rain""; i do agree that there is a beauty in the minimalism of the title. The titles i had in mind were ""A Mobile Home in Periwinkle"" or ""Rain and Periwinkle"" or something along those lines. Thanks for the inspiration and ideas!"
OCPoetry,3dsxui,Chesapeake_Gentleman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Personally I would be careful of drawing on periwinkle again as a word, because you use it twice in the poem. I think it would really change the later parts of the poem to also include the word periwinkle making it more of a motif.   That said, I think ""Periwinkle Rain"" would sound better than ""rain and periwinkle"". I do see the appeal that word has."
OCPoetry,3dsxui,dorkmania,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"Hm...i see your point. It's difficult because I don't really want to call it ""House in the Rain"" or whatever because it seems a little too bland and cliche. At the same time Periwinkle might be too redundant."
OCPoetry,3dsxui,brainintercourse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"The following is strictly my opinion and any offense is unintentional. The author has made use exquisite use of imagery, to paint a vibrant picture of what appears to a trailer home in a suburban setting. The choice of words gives a visceral quality to the work. There is not much artistic criticism to give but possibly a grammatical one, ""place too small for map"", here 'any' or 'a' before 'map' would seem to make more more sense. All in all great piece of work from my perspective.  Title:Suburban Rain (Yes it's cliched but fairly accurate)"
OCPoetry,3dsxui,Doublerolls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, i realized that ""any"" would be more grammatically correct :)  Thanks for the title suggestion, it's great!"

OCPoetry,3dsxui,Doublerolls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Alright let's do this on a stanza by stanza breakdown.   I. I don't think tinker is the word you're looking for.  Maybe ""patters"" or ""alights"" tinker doesn't sell it for me.  (Love the snaggletoothed roof imagery. Much better than a lot of the stuff i see around here.)   II. A timpani is already metallic so that line loses the punch it should have. I'm really digging the mountain god thing, maybe instead of just having the wrinkles be wrinkles they could be cracks in the tectonic plate, or monstrous chasms? I'm a  sucker for embellishment.   III. I like it a lot. Inhibit is a bit of weird word choice just because it doesn't really flow but i like these verses.  IV. I don't know what i don't like about these verses.  I know weeds growing in a porcelain cup just sounds like forced imagery. It's not something I've ever seen so it doesn't resonate you know?   Lump is a very uncaring not beautiful way to describe a  baby. Maybe that's what you want( it seems to reinforce the hopeless theme you've got going on) but it seems a  missed opportunity for poetic embellishment.   V. I don't really get it, maybe i'm just tired, but how is tax designed like architecture?   VI.  Not really beautiful words but it has GREAT cohesion.  VII. There's not a person in here? Who is oneself?   I actually liked it over all, I think it could be a diamond in the rough. :)       Beyond that maybe some of the word choice is a little simple but that saves you from pretentiousness which runs like a plague through amateur writers' ranks.   Title: Empty Dreams of the No-One    Hope it helps, maybe you'll return the favor some day?"

OCPoetry,3ds1mx,yourselfiegotleaked,3,Sat Jul 18 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"This is great but the narrative is confusing to me. It starts out as first person ""I woke beside a lifeless corpse."" and then continues on in third person for the rest of the poem. I'm finding it hard to figure out who the narrator is supposed to be. Him, her or a third party.  Everything else about it is great though, the rhymes flow well and none of them feel forced. I'm assuming the ""Knife at last"" is a metaphorical knife in his back from an adulterous betrayal. I like how you present the man with a defeated apathetic attitude and then help paint that picture further by describing him as if he was dead. So you have the image of a sort of lifeless zombie dragging his feet through a tragic relationship.   Unless it's meant to be taken literally but it doesn't seem like it to me."

OCPoetry,3dr5yr,schrader52,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"I love it!  My feedback is only minor and is mostly just suggestions.  I would consider changing up the first line so that it is ""Exhausted, rundown, a lump."" I think the three-syllable, two-syllable, two one-syllable words reflects the impression of losing steam.  ""Spent like a fat kid's money in a candy store, But without the satisfaction.""  Ha! I love this line. I think ""gratification"" might be a better word to use than ""satisfaction"" here, but that's really up to you.  ""My heavy eyelids are harder to hold open.""  Nice alliteration. ""H"" is kind of a tired sound, too, so it works nicely.  ""The smell of coffee sneaking in from the kitchen,""  I think you should ask yourself whether ""sneaking in"" or ""sneaking out"" would be better here. I'm not sure myself, but the choice would certainly impact the mood of the poem in a subtle but important way.  ""If only my tired mind could manage the telekinesis of a coffee cup.""  Again, I love this. All in all a short, sweet, simple little piece that conveys its theme very well. Nice work."
OCPoetry,3dr5yr,BlitheCynic,2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:43 2015 UTC,It's short so there's not a whole lot to say.   I agree with the other poster about the re-order of that first line.  I don't think there's a lot to fix. It's not a magical piece but for what it is it's delightful.   Love the imagery with the fat kid.
OCPoetry,3dr5yr,Doublerolls,0,Sun Jul 19 07:12:00 2015 UTC,"Third line should read, ""And just as satisfied.""  Not only does it say what you mean with style, but it's also iambic!"

Something that struck me was the repetition of sounds that seemed to be a counterpoint to the more obvious repetition of words. Like ""...to say"" and ""...desperate, eh?"". And the repeated ""again""s and ""you""s at the end of the line. It makes you feel you've read the line before.  If I had to make a suggestion for improvement, I might tentatively suggest that I'm not sure it needs the ""The end?"" at the end. It might be more powerful if the end of the last line mirrored the first line with the repeated ""writing about you"".  Something else: The way the lines get shorter and shorter and then start long again in the first half; I like that. It feels almost like taking a breath.  Probably one of the best examples in poem form of the theme of being trapped in a cycle. Thanks."

There are a few places where I think it's worded too awkwardly or formally, especially for a poem about a dick. I also think there are two or three lines that can be removed for some more subtlety.   For example for this stanza:   ""I don't care the price, just take it all. I can't think or sleep or work, with this dick in control.""   I would say ""thing"" instead of dick. It makes it sound more conversational. Also I think you missed an 'about' before price.  For this stanza:   I don't need the heartache anymore. No need for the pain of my ill willed mind. Though they say, ""two heads are better than one."" I have found one will always rule.     I would ditch the second line and reword the others, again to be more conversational:  I don't need the heartache anymore. They say two heads are better than one, but one always rules over the other.   And for the last stanza, I'd reword the first line to look something like this:  I can't connect heart and soul   It's all my opinion of course, but I hope it helps!"

The first two or three stanzas were riddled with cliches and lackluster imagery and when ypu weren't reciting tired expressions, you were creating sentences incapable of deeper evaluation.       I know that is a harsh way to start this, but I do have some constructive criticism... I suspect you have fallen victim to one of the worst parts of poetry, the over-glorifying of a very specific event, of which the common man cannot relate to. While yes, poetry is meant to transcend social and financial classes, and allow everyone to derive their own meaning from said work; too often do we nitpick and focus on particulars when it would have been just as easy to take a few steps back and look at the big-picture. Tne big-picture is where the beauty, power, and transcendence originate, so please try taking another stab at this, and never stop writing!"

Because I wrote it about a loving relationship torn apart by circumstance and the freedom one feels after releasing oneself from such a relationship. In other words, how to see the good in an awful situation.  If you read it again with this in mind, does that change your perspective on it? Or does it still do nothing for you?"

I'm wondering if you can imply throughout the middle of the poem that you're looking at your phone/laptop so you don't have to say 'screen' 'apps' etc - then you could just write ""scrolling through faces or torsos, faceless,""  I think including language about typing, the glow of a screen, etc, would allow you to mix up your words/make the poem sound nicer.  lastly: fein --> feign"

It hold's the readers' attention; in the wrong places, and while you may think- just perhaps- that the audience (your audience) will follow your lines of punctuation like youre BREATH; this is not the case.  I like the interplay of a subjective reality.  'I remember it differently' is the crux of this piece and needs to stand out more directly."

OCPoetry,3dmtio,Squeech11,3,Fri Jul 17 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"This is my personal opinion of course, but I'm not a huge fan of the rhyming here. As is the problem with a lot of rhyming poetry, I feel like some of the lines are worded awkwardly to fit the rhyme scheme. For example, not a fan of    All that's there are lies   Maybe ""you'll find only lies"" is better?  Also, not a fan of    Fixate not on ahead.   though I can't think of an alternative.  And lastly,    To find what makes you Grin   can be ""for what makes you grin"".  I'm a big believe in the rule of threes. Repeating things three times seems to be the sweet spot. You say ""Don't look to the skies"" and then ""Don't look to the ground"", but then you switch it to ""Avoid looking behind"". I think you should make that ""Don't look behind.""  I would also change   Lest you'll stay blind   to ""Lest you stay blind.""  Also, it might just be me, but I don't really understand the second part. Why would someone look to the ground for something profound? I figured the skies part could be a reference to astrology, but not sure about the ground.  Anyway, hope that helps."

OCPoetry,3dmsh5,BrowningHighPower,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"The first stanza got me hyped for a really dope rhyme scheme, but the second stanza kind of let me down in that regard. The second stanza breaks out of the ABCB, and it felt a bit jarring after re-reading the poem.  I thought that the internal rhyme on the second-to-last line created a pretty good feeling of conclusion.  I really love second person narration, so props to you.  I feel like in the last sentence you try for a different word than 'fool,' because that sentence (at least it seems to me) is supposed to indicate a shift in how we view the king of fools, but youve been using fool to describe him for the entirety of the poem."
OCPoetry,3dmsh5,EqualToHeaven,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:07:06 2015 UTC,Do you think scrapping the rhyme scheme to begin with would soften the blow? I was also trying to think of a different word in the last line but couldn't think of anything that rolled off the tongue as nicely. The only alternative I was really considering was 'old man' instead of 'poor fool.'
OCPoetry,3dmsh5,EqualToHeaven,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:31 2015 UTC,I think the preferable thing to do in terms of the rhyme scheme is to change the first stanza from ABBBto ABCB would make the lack of rhyme in the second stanza less noticeable.   I think old man would work well in the last line.

It indicates that the narrator was following them around, and that makes the POV awkward, since it is never mentioned otherwise. I recommend changing it to 'there were' or something similar. -'Fade' in line 13 sounds too ambiguous. -Line five has a bit of an award meter. Add a monosyllabic word there to help keep the beat. Same goes for line nine. -Line 18: Change 'passed' to 'past' (Grammar Nazi me, whee) -Lines 33-36 are charming, but lines 33-34 seem too abrupt in change. The realization that the girl carries the puppet with her comes to quickly and ambiguously for it to have much emotional impact. Otherwise, I think it was a very excellent poem. Keep writing, you have some good ideas!"
OCPoetry,3dlqi6,Aqua783,2,Fri Jul 17 08:05:43 2015 UTC,"What's interesting about this piece is how easy it is for us to ruminate on things and, without care - become self-absorbed ourselves.  What we feel others should or shouldn't do, how we perceive their actions & and that we feel almost entitled to a certain level of imaginary, indignant entitlement to it, is quite profound. Yet we are our own selves and while it is so easy to imagine that someone is is self-absorbed for not considering your feelings, or for dismantling your trust, it can be easy to become that which you set out to underline to another.   I enjoyed reading your poem. Thanks for sharing."
OCPoetry,3dlqi6,badbaud,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:00:23 2015 UTC,"That's the thing! If you're talking about your feelings, you're called ""self-absorbed"". If you talk about other people's feelings, it's like playing telephone. I get what you mean about the ""what we feel others should or shouldn't do"", but I wrote this about an experience that happened moments before, and this person was deliberately trying to make me mad (that's what he told me, believe me). I think I have some right to think he was being self-absorbed by continuing something he could've stopped and reAlly think about my feelings. I don't believe that someone wouldn't just not think about someone else's feelings, but to the extent of which I experienced with that person, it was just wrong. So sorry for the little rant I guess :/ I'm glad that you could connect to my poem even a bit, and thanks for taking the time to leave a comment :') Happy reading/writing!"

OCPoetry,3dkqb7,Aqua783,2,Fri Jul 17 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"Alllright. So, let me start off by saying, ""This is really too perfect!"" Great sense of rhyme (none of them sound forced) and choice of words. Addicting topic (because we all have friends, don't we?), and my my! What pretty lines you have here!       We were young and mistakes hammered harder than voices / Filling coffins with nails forged from bad choices.   Omg this is amazing, I swear. It hits me right in a soft spot because I'm a ""perfectionist"" so I always think my mistakes are like the end of the world, so going onto the next line makes a LOT of sense to me and I can relate so much to these two lines that it's actually frightening. I imagine it like this (even though it might not be precise): nails are hammered through the coffin (these are your bad choices right?) well, when you feel like a bad choice has left you for dead (so you lay down in the coffin), it sinks deeper into your heart than you could have ever imagined. And that alone makes me applaud this poem.   But now you mean very little to me and I mean nothing to you.       Ouch, okay, I actually felt that one. (and that rhyme is so sweet!)   ...bloodied my favourite shirt...       Okay, Idk why but I imagine that the day you realize all of these things, you're wearing that shirt, so it kind of leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you wear it, haha.   I mean I wrote this in a dream and it choked me in reality;       Speechless, really. Just... really good, just so you know.  So, well, I really like this piece! Gave an up-vote and will probably share it with some of my friends, and save it on reddit. Kind of spooky that I read it today because after 2 hours reading it, I had a fight with one of my friends so... thanks for this. Reading it after the fight just helps me realize some things can't be avoided. (We made up, but I'm still a little upset because he did something really mean.)

Surprisingly I  don't find your rhymes grating or overly repetitive. You manage to rhyme pretty much every line without sounding ""Dr. Seussy"", a problem I constantly struggle with.     My favorite aspect of this poem is the imagery. I get a very offbeat surrealist vibe from it, and that's just up my alley. The only thing that bothered me about it was that you rhymed every line except the last one.

The idea of saying a name like a profanity, the notion that hearing your own name just doesn't feel right anymore because the ""Thief"" has stolen it from you. Love these ideas.  I think you need to be more bitter, more angry. Spew more vitriol at the Thief. I don't really feel the anger that I think you're trying to get across. For this poem, I would consider breaking it down into three stanzas. I think your first stanza is fine, the second could convey a memory of the closeness you once shared with the thief, the warmth you once shared. And for the third stanza I think you should basically be screaming at the thief, conveying all of your anger and despair.   But these are just tips. I think you have style, don't lose that. It needs some work but I think you have the makings of a very good poem here."

If anything, I would cut ""Lying next to me you whispered it,  a prayer in the night."" which is a bit cliched. And then if you're going to get rid of the third stanza, combine the third and the second? I mean, just the muttering in your hair image is very beautiful, and perfectly captures the idea of a name signifying intimacy in just one very simple image."

OCPoetry,3dg4yy,samanthalynnie,3,Thu Jul 16 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"I really dig the first two lines, it just came off as a pleasant, witty surprise. Good introduction to the content of the poem. I also really enjoyed the lines describing you sitting on your bag waiting for the train ride home.   My two main problems with the poem are the three ""I remember"" lines. I don't feel like they really build on each other, if that makes sense. I feel like repetition is supposed to make each successive line more powerful, and I don't feel like the repetition in this instance did that. However, these lines tell an important part of the story, so I would recommend writing them using different methods or trying to make the repetition more effective.  The ending left me kind of unsatisfied. And I don't mean that you successfully conveyed a feeling of dissatisfaction to the reader, because that would be fine. What I do mean is that I expected something more poignant, more powerful. I don't find that the poem conveys any particularly strong emotions, so I was expecting the last stanza to be a loaded one.   To me, most of this reads like a piece of prose than a poem. If you take away all of the line spacing and just read your poem as a paragraph, I don't feel like you really lose anything. Why did you write this poem? What message are you trying to communicate to the reader? Why is poetry the best way to convey this message. If you answer these questions I think you stand to improve the poem immensely.  Hope this helps. Feel free to send me a message."

OCPoetry,3dg1xk,Crapturret94,2,Thu Jul 16 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"There is one thing really exceptional about this poem, and that's the flow. The meter and rhythm in this poem seriously impressed me, so I'd like to try to help you with what I perceive as some of the weaker aspects of the poem.    I know this is a sonnet, and you are held to a certain rhyme scheme. But maybe bend the rules a little bit in one particular case: the line , ""And with one eye on the page..."" was really disruptive to the flow of the poem to me because I found it didn't play well with the other lines. And I don't think this disruption serves to further the message of the poem.     I also have a problem with the line starting ""'She has a smile more gorgeous..."". It just strikes me as a little...uninspired. The rest of your imagery is pretty striking, so this line stuck out to me because it seems dull in comparison to the other lines, and maybe a little cliche. I'd recommend whipping out the rhyming dictionary and maybe taking that line in another direction. And since the next line doesn't have a rhyme, that gives you some flexibility as far as making changes goes.    I think this poem would be a great thing to read as slam poetry, or just aloud in general, simply because the rhythm is so spot on. Hope this helps."
OCPoetry,3deh47,tgosubucks,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Beautiful poem. Dark and bitter mood from beginning to end, very nice. Be careful not to repeat words and phrases too much, unless you were going for parallelism. Try to find synonyms for words like ""pavement"" and ""liquid."" Those were the two that jumped out at me"
OCPoetry,3deh47,swaztastic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"I was talking about New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco.   I used liquid twice, i think. Pavement is a bit overused (3 times) but  it helps connect the idea of the person's conscious falling off and the person falling."
OCPoetry,3deh47,swaztastic,2,Wed Jul 15 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"I understood the meaning behind the use of the word but I just think that other words could be used. In my opinion, unless it is parallelism, the exact same word multiple times in the same stanza makes the poem feel slightly more boring and redundant. I don't think that using synonyms would detract from the ""falling"" concept either; in fact, I think it would strengthen it. For pavement, you could use words like ground, street, sidewalk, gravel, dirt, cement, etc. For liquid, you could easily swap one out for the word fluid (although I agree, that one is a bit nitpicky).  I still think this is a wonderful poem; I just wanted to offer my advice."

Not all poetry should be an epic Odyssey (and definitely not all poetry should be that long).

It's a little ambiguous because the speaker used words like ""Pretend"" and ""imagined"" while referring to how the speaker interacted with her.  I really enjoyed the way you portrayed the longing felt by both the speaker and the women. I also noticed the way that you started and ended the poem with her eyes.

OCPoetry,3dbg1g,DeceitfulCake,3,Wed Jul 15 11:19:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is pretty fantastically constructed. It's a great poem with some really thought-provoking moments. Unlike some other repliers, I love the the simultaneous ambiguity and specificity of the characterisation of death; letting it exist as both an abstract personification of death, and a representation of a real lover. Both layers add nuance to our understanding of the other, without one overshadowing it. Also, the title is perfect. It really highlights this weird duality, don't change it.  However, I do feel some of the earlier lines let the poem down somewhat. Phrases like 'murky New York sky a black shelter above us' and 'void of stars' aren't particularly compelling or interesting images, and I personally don't think they really add much thematically either; it kind of feels like a sort of obligatory scene-setting that just fills time before you get to the ending. I'd suggest scattering some verbs in it to make it feel more active and maintain the sense of movement of the characters (it instantly becomes more engaging once you reach 'flickered', and the poem's pulse feels great from there). Maybe something along the lines of 'murky New York sky softly breathes - a black shelter above us'? A verb just adds a bit more sense of pulse, otherwise the descriptive fragments just sort of float around and feel a bit wishy-washy.  Also, I love the phrase 'rain-padded silence' but I think the rhythm of that line just doesn't quite flow with the rest of the poem. I don't know exactly what would fix it, but enjambment recurs pretty strongly as a motif in most of the poem, but is surprisingly absent for the first four lines. Maybe experiment with adding it in somewhere in the opening sentences?  I really love this though."

I might still change it A LITTLE though as it IS pretty long.   I also find it extremely interesting that you call out ""void of stars"" and ""murky New York sky..."" because those were the lines I thought people would like the most! Haha, well, I'm always surprised, thank you. Your suggestion ""murky New York sky softly breathes - a black shelter above us"" is truly beautiful and would work better in the poem.

First,  ""And I wouldn't"" kiss her. It's a bit of an awkward placement and I see how one could get a little lost. Next, it's left out in the open a bit, but in my mind the character tells death that she loves her...only to have death slip away into the night again after a show of mutual love. So then is death saving the girl or hurting her? If death accepted the proposal and killed the girl, would it be a favor? Alright, and then yes, I changed ""creek"" to ""creak"" thanks for catching that. Death wears shoes because she does (and because she is loosely based on my ex...). Thanks."

Great work! It seems to flow nicely; I haven't had the chance to count your syllables but I didn't have any hiccups anywhere. Oh, but I noticed you didn't have a rhyme in stanza 5! It seemed to be the only odd one out... well, I still think it's great.   Thanks for sharing!! Please keep writing"

There is clever usage of language at multiple places and figurative references abound. The narrator's dislike of his home is also implied at many instances. All in all a worthwhile read. Thank You.

The ""she didn't break me"" is a curious line and makes me wonder ""who is she and what did she do?""

The poem evokes a deep sense of nostalgia for the city and the narrator's time spent there.

OCPoetry,3db5md,widget0001,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:08:35 2015 UTC,I loved the flip of perspective - it's not often that the Other Woman gets her say - and the bitterness is palpable. Your rhythm is great.
OCPoetry,3dbgjx,RUItalianMan,3,Tue Jul 14 23:48:33 2015 UTC,"I want to preface my feedback because it might give off the wrong impression about what I think.  First, I quite like the poem, I wouldn't be giving feedback if I didn't think it was good.  Second, your poem has a very strong and comfortable rhythm to it, so that's what I decided to focus on.  Third, I have pretty specific tastes as far as syllables/rhythm, so what I think sounds natural might sound unnatural to you and vice versa.  I don't mean to say my suggestions would make your poem objectively better.  My strategy for feedback is saying what I would do if this poem were mine, so please, if you disagree with something I say, ignore it.  Last line of first stanza, I might consider changing it to ""drink a glass of wine,"" or ""share some bottled wine,"" or something similar.  One less syllable would help it flow better in my opinion.  Normally I would probably prefer the 5 syllable rhyming with a 6 syllable line, but the way you have that last line written would force an emphasis on the wrong syllables.  If I read it with the natural rhythm that I feel throughout your poem, I would read it like drink A botTLE of WINE.  The first syllable in the word ""bottle"" is the natural one to emphasis, so it kinda feels awkward.  So I'd either lower it down to 5 syllables to let it flow better or find a way to make ""bottle"" properly emphasized.  Similar thing I noticed in the third stanza, third line.  The emphasis on easy feels unnatural given the cadence you've established.  To follow the cadence it would emphasize the second syllable in easy: eaSY eNOUGH i THOUGHT.  Which feels unnatural, I'd rather emphasize the first.  For example, the line ""I easy thought enough,"" displays the cadence I'd look for in this line.  Of course my suggestion doesn't even make sense, I'm only focusing on the rhythm.  5th stanza, third line, I would change to something like ""but I fucked up and got nervous-""  Again, this flows more naturally in my eyes.  This also places emphasis on the words ""fucked"" and ""nervous"" which seem like the kind of words I'd want to emphasize in that line.  As is, I naturally emphasize ""I"" ""up"" and ""nervous.""  6th stanza, 3rd line I would cut down.   Again, my example isn't a recommendation to use this particular line, but just from a cadence/rhythm perspective, I'd want it to sound like: ""I can't believe that woman was/making me feel like a boy"" instead of ""I couldn't believe that this young woman.""  I think the line is just a little wonky overall, maybe too long, because I can't really fit this line into the rhythm of the poem at all.  If you want to minimize the change in the third line, another option would be to change it to something that reads like: ""I can't believe that this young woman/made me feel like just a boy.""  I can't really exactly explain clearly and concisely why I prefer some of the changes I suggested, so my hope is that my examples can help you understand what kind of changes I'm thinking of as far as cadence and emphasis go.  Two things to keep in mind if you do want to go in this direction: First, obviously, if you want a line to sound stilted then keep it stilted, jarring the reader out of the rhythm has its place.  Second, the poem may feel a little too sing-song or like a chant, depending on how you change the rhythm, and that's usually not desirable.  Sorry if this was a bit harsh or came across like I think I know better than you, I don't want to tell you how to make your art.  I hope something I said will help you think of something that will work for you, not me."
OCPoetry,3dbgjx,myocpoetryaccount,3,Wed Jul 15 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the detailed response! I don't usually (read: almost ever) read or write poetry, so I appreciate everything you've said. I don't have much of an ear for it yet, so I definitely will use your advice, and you're right, it sounds much better. I knew some of the lines were awkward and you came through big time. I feel slightly encouraged that the lines you picked out were also the ones that stood out to me, especially the 6th/3rd. That is certainly the weakest one.   I'll play around with the changes you suggested, and thank you very much for saying that you liked it!

And I always consider it a victory when the lines I'm not 100% on are the ones other people pick out as awkward.  Like bmcmb already said, the meaning should probably trump the form in most cases, I agree with that.  I just tunneled in on the rhythm because its relatively easy to comment on versus some harder stuff like rhyme scheme or synesthesia or whatever.  It sounds like you already know that, but I thought it was worth mentioning again.  Anyway, keep writing, man!  Oh, I forgot to add, I absolutely love the phrase ""bourbon being bled."""

OCPoetry,3da8xm,jenshu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:39:03 2015 UTC,The following is merely my opinion with no offense intended. Not the prettiest poem in the world but it hits hard. To me it tells of the perverted nature of what people have come to call love. how we are hypocrites when talking about it. To the extent that the author 'finally believes' that the person with whom she was in what appears to be an S&M relationship loved her. This work is a gain for the art of poetry. Kudos.
OCPoetry,3da8xm,dorkmania,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"Actually I was trying to express that the main character was always skeptical of the ""I love you"" phrase. In the last stanza she's in a seemingly hurtful relationship w/ similar aspects to her previous ones 'snap, crack' and all that, but the other party never says 'I love you,' and that's the main difference which brings this story whole circle. This sort of pain, though the same, is administered w/o the typical ""I love you"" phrase which is something she's comfortable w/. Which is of course sad b/c in the end she has never really been loved, but also not so bad b/c she is no longer being lied to.

It was needed as I felt you crossed several different stories or experiences in this piece. That may be why a title escapes you. I would check the little things as well.

This theme seems to be subtly satirizing the event consistently throughout the poem. Thoroughly enjoyable. Look forward to your next work. Thank You."
OCPoetry,3d8jw0,dorkmania,2,Tue Jul 14 10:01:40 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I get the feeling that people only write poetry about depression. I liked the poem, but it does leave me a little empty. I would have liked a couple more stanzas on the idea, it's interesting enough to warrant them."
OCPoetry,3d8jw0,jameswal_,2,Tue Jul 14 11:51:35 2015 UTC,"Thank You for your kind words. If you'd like I can share with you a poem that is not about depression but also not disingenuous like most ""happy"" poems. As for the terseness of the poem, I am no poet but a base human driven by emotion as would be apparent in what you've read. I've attempted to restructure and expand upon the original feeling. Do let me know if it does justice to the original."

In my opinion, this poem could be divided into a few stanzas - but perhaps you were going for one flowing image?   Perhaps it was even just a slip of the formatting. Either way, great!"

OCPoetry,3d7c64,wigglecandy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:15:28 2015 UTC,Really sad poem. Tired of lending you want to commit suicide . I dont know how the leap year measures in though. Is it cause you are going to leap too? It doesnt really connect  . Also the second line from start is larger and breaks the flow. Otherwise good effort keep it up
OCPoetry,3d7c64,jealous1stillnv,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:03:04 2015 UTC,It gives me a pit in my stomach as if I'm falling  Definitely troubling and uncomfortable to read the first couple of times.  I think the beginning stumbles a little bit and then the rest of the poem flows more naturally. I felt this matched the content well with some resistance initially that gains momentum towards a horror veiled in sarcasm.
OCPoetry,3d6e5r,vira13,2,Mon Jul 13 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Over all this was a very good read. It allowed me a glimpse at the picture you were painting as well as letting me paint my own. There were a few spots that I thought lacked some flow, it sort of ran together. Still, good read."

OCPoetry,3d6l0i,Hassan_Amir,2,Tue Jul 14 04:32:34 2015 UTC,"I generally disregard posts like this, but the teacher in me can't let this one slide.   In my classroom, everyone is a writer and everyone publishes. Not all of my students are natural writers, nor will many of them publish anywhere besides our room. Very few are good writers, let alone great writers, because beautiful writing is a dying art. But the point is for them to try, to strive to be better.  We have so few people who still strive to write, to improve, to use the written word to express the best parts of humanity. And most of us fail.   If you are here for the same reason I'm here--and I'm betting I'm close, since you have taken the time to write and rewrite and edit and revise and then publish a book of poetry--it's to appreciate the beauty of writing, and the struggle we undergo to convey the best parts of us. If we fail, then we fail, but it is an honorable failure. It is an attempt to do something great, to write poetry.  So please, do not abuse the beautiful words I have come here to honor and appreciate to degrade another potential writer. If you have helpful critique, by all means, critique, but do not abuse what we come here to revere."

I love the alliteration there, too.  For big idea suggestion, I would say play with your line breaks. You can use a variation of long and short lines to flesh out ways to build on the tension you already have, plus it will allow you to form a more subtle internal rhyme scheme rather than at the end, which can be a little contrived (your 3rd line in particular).   Last nit-picky suggestion is to check your punctuation in the 17th line, maybe add commas and check the lower case ""i"".   Cool piece!"

OCPoetry,3d2eu4,jizzlyn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:39:05 2015 UTC,"1) the line itself stretches as if enveloping the reader aka the 'audience' and so 'you' becomes 'me' aka the speaker. would work less well if the stretch (i.e. the longer line in the stanza) is split in two, in my opinion.  2) the 'concrete monolith' is 'in the way', not sure what you mean by it not making sense?  3) articles are deliberately missing from the glass disaster cage line, it's intended to resemble a newspaper headline or personal ad. it would be 'an escape from a glass...' otherwise.  4) stuck is stuck between commas just as 'in the way' is separated by a comma; obstructions are grammatically highlighted. these could certainly use some polish as commas are the only punctuation and don't always refer to obstruction, but this was doubtless my reasoning upon writing the piece and i think it's a somewhat worthy idea albeit inconsistently executed.  sorry if this seems abrupt or unappreciative, i really do like the feedback! thanks for the comment, if there's anything you want to send my way please feel free!"

OCPoetry,3d1r3i,aboutyourpower,2,Sun Jul 12 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"okay so this is quite brutal but i can't find a better way of saying it. this feels less like poetry and more like a self help audiobook with some rhymes thrown in. i like that it's a positive, motivating piece, but it feels lacking character. it's not tightly constructed, the rhythm is all over the place, the rhymes are forced and sometimes a bit twee (you see, entirely, yes indeed). for me it needs more focus and something to draw me into it a bit more, i get that it's morally instructive but that doesn't mean it has to be straightforwardly didactic."

At times the rhythm breaks down a bit; some lines have just one too many beats.  I was wondering about this line: ""It looked at me as I stood phased;"" Maybe you meant fazed instead of phased?"

OCPoetry,3czil2,DrMarcov,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:20:00 2015 UTC,"there's flashes of powerful writing here but the style wears thin very quickly for me. endless paragraphs about how much the speaker hates modernity or the system or pretty much everything also became tedious. a paragraph of jumbled phrases such as    Kill the Terrorists Murder the Muslims Exterminate the Jews Fuck the Man Rape the Women Buy the People   what is your intent here? it comes off as an attempt to be edgy about how the world is so bad and the speaker is this prophet of truth or reality or what's really good and that in itself makes me dislike the speaker more, which is fine cause you don't have to love every speaker of every poem, but then i don't want to keep reading this large stream of consciousness paragraphs of their thoughts, you see what I mean?"
OCPoetry,3czte3,jealous1stillnv,2,Sun Jul 12 07:25:03 2015 UTC,"Ok look at those first three lines. There you show some instinctive understanding of form and establish a meter. And it's great too.  A silent kiss,  In a moment of bliss,  Holds you in heavens embrace.    (You missed the s on holds)  That's lovely. It sounds good too, because of the rhythm. However you instantly abandon the rhythm. That is where the flow stopped, isn't it? You poured the first part out naturally, then you thought about the rest of it. That's what I think happened.  While freeform poetry has its place, until you understand form you will never be a good poet. Here you establish a rhythm and then abandon it straight away. As a reader, I am drawn in and then immediately put off.   Form is constraint - that is where its freedom lies. Try rewriting all of this using the same meter as the first three lines. It will be hard at first, but as you continue your mastery of poetry will increase and it will become second nature.  Despite what many here will tell you, just because you thought something, doesn't mean it's interesting or poetic. Here you abandon poetry for just saying things and ending sentences inappropriately. The first three lines tell me you can do better."
OCPoetry,3czte3,PomesByJesse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:50:24 2015 UTC,I really appreciate you guiding me its true this is actually what happened after first three lines the flow was gone. I don't know how to maintain it though can you tell me what to do?
OCPoetry,3czte3,PomesByJesse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"I write my best stuff in that flow state you felt in those first three lines. My best bits all come out in about ten minutes. That's why I sorta saw what you did there.  Maintaining it is hard some times, but the best thing is not to force it. When the mood strikes, sit and write for as long as you can. Even if you write a thing and think 'ah, nice that's done', change the page and keep writing. Flow is everything.  But when it does leave, when you're only a couplet or so into a thing, just keep writing. Because what you're writing is the thing inside you, whatever it is. Sometimes that thing speaks for itself, and it flows through you, and then you have a poem. Sometimes you need to nudge the thing. Sometimes you need to push the thing - just remember that when you do, the thing is not at its best. It's being pushed. It's there but it's not really there yet. When you bring it out into the light of text, the light of language, you can see it better. You can hone your description of it.   Write and write and write. I recommend this to everyone here and should probably add it to my flair - read Stephen Fry's The Ode Less Travelled. It's beautifully written but it's also educational. It will teach you form. Form is important for a poet, especially if you choose to abandon it. Even if you can't find the book, use things like your opening lines there as a spur.  So, you felt the flow of the first three lines. Keep it up! Fit your feelings to the form. Keep the rhythm of those three lines in you, and think about what you're saying. Don't sit and think words, hold all those images, memories, feelings in you.. Hold them. When they come out, they'll pour out. Into that form, that mold, that you are working with. Form will free you through constraint.  I'll be honest with you, this that you've posted now, it's not very good at all. But to me it seems like you, the poet, have potential. You should keep writing. You should learn about the form. You should break it and make something your own.  It's that sweet spot between feeling and thinking. Practice will get you there."

""I aspire to be a warrior -- And never bow my head"" is missing rhyming couplets, which you've pulled off throughout the rest of the poem. I really like your rhyming, so I wonder if this was intentionally left un-rhymed?  I really, really dig your message here. I think you've conveyed exactly what you wanted to. The references to lust and a ""flimsy love"" give it a very human vibe despite sounding ethereal and talking of higher powers.

I liked that you start jumping into the abyss, pretty dark as spacial metaphors go, but it turns out that you're jumping into life. Reminds me a little bit of Kipling's 'If'.

""So look to the stars, and marvel at its mars.""  not too sure about this line though. you mean mars the planet? it sounds as if you're using mars as an adjective or a quality of the stars, in which cause it should be 'their' since stars is plural."
OCPoetry,3cw9nk,jealous1stillnv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"Yes ! That is exactly what I meant by ""mars"", and looking at it now, ""their"" would make a lot more sense. I will definitely work on my grammar next time around, thank you."

OCPoetry,3cwegf,derintellectual,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"Fantastic imagery. If I was a painter, I could put this on canvas. I thoroughly enjoyed this poem."
OCPoetry,3cw5pp,carterza,2,Sat Jul 11 07:32:22 2015 UTC,"The rhyme was perfect generally when someone uses such big words the rhyme feels forced you know, but the way you have done it is a good example of how to construct a poem The idea you have portrayed spot on .this poems only critique is the first line you know it seems a little off to start a poem like that but well done i lovec your poem"
OCPoetry,3cw5pp,jealous1stillnv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:35:01 2015 UTC,"i have to disagree, the rhymes felt forced and awkward, and for lyrics especially the rhythm is very inconsistent."
OCPoetry,3cw5pp,downtownseoul,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:49:41 2015 UTC,"thanks for your feedback - can you elaborate on the inconsistent rhythm? I think you can make rhythm work depending on how you pronounce words.  for instance in this poem when I wrote -   that whole set it free, if it's meant to be saying has sent my brain on a crime spree and it's disobeying  the rhythm works if you speed up the pronunciation of disobeying  this wouldn't be the chorus of a song, more like some type of rap / hip hop interlude, at least that's what I had intended"
OCPoetry,3cw5pp,downtownseoul,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"by inconsistent rhythm i meant the rhythm was not consistent, i don't really know what else to say. if you tap a beat with your hand to the first two lines, it's impossible for me not to stumble over the second line because of the syllables, it breaks up the flow. in fairness i can see that as a whole piece it works better rapped fast because there's more room to vary the syllable stresses and speed, but there are a lot of bits where you'd have to either be off-beat, very very quick, or stressing syllables oddly. perhaps i'm not getting it right in how i'm trying to do it, it's hard to convey that in text.  also the first line doesn't make any sense to me personally, the callback to it in the fourth line is an interesting idea but it feels clumsy in execution, and the -ality rhymes, especially banality, were a bit forced."
OCPoetry,3cw5pp,jealous1stillnv,0,Sat Jul 11 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"yeah I mean the last stanza has rhyming issues for sure - it was 3 AM though and rhyming dictionary was at hand.  again it's all about how fast you say the syllables - if you don't try to make it flow, it's not going to flow... If you say certain words with more rapidity, it's quite easy to make the entire thing flow together.  Regardless thank you for the feedback - I definitely am with you on the second half, I need to rework it but it's a start I guess."
OCPoetry,3cw5pp,CookizMonstz,0,Sat Jul 11 18:05:48 2015 UTC,Well i liked it and anyway its just my opinion. It matters dude from person to person But i apreciate your candor

OCPoetry,3cw5pp,PomesByJesse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"I really like this. Its a good look into someone's mind when their dark thoughts cloud their judgement and this portrays the result. Being in the 1st person saying ""bye bye"" to logical thoughts and becoming irrational and on the brink of suicide really makes people relate to that thought (if you want to go that far, but everyone has thought about it at some point in their life)"
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,downtownseoul,2,Sat Jul 11 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"I like open-ended poetry, you can take from it whatever you see in it. This reminds me of Odysseus' journey through seas and hardships and hell."
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,StinzorgaKingOfBees,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"I want to read more of this. Like three or four more stanzas, even. Could use punctuation, but you've an excellent style."
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,Samus-the-Witch-King,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely like it. Not sure what it means, but in my book that's a good thing.  Your imagery is quite strong; I could really envision where I was and what was happening.  One thing to think about is that the last stanza doesn't seem to be in the same place as the other stanzas. It has strong imagery, but it isn't consistent with the rest of the piece.   But if that's intentional, more power to you."
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,RO_MrGrumbles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:20:00 2015 UTC,i started with the last stanza and came across a theme in the others as i wrote them that was in a different place. it definitely does stick out a bit and i'm not sure if i want to insert another stanza or two to help it transition more smoothly. do you think it would benefit from that?
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,RO_MrGrumbles,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:02:55 2015 UTC,Maybe one more stanza would help the transition. I wouldn't do more than that unless you really discover more to say
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,carterza,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:20:54 2015 UTC,"I like it - very dark. Makes me think of undead / zombies. I especially like the last stanza... Kind of enforces the notion that whatever subject the poem is referring to, they have no emotion / feeling / say nothing they just walk around on burning floors in empty rooms. Pretty cool image."
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,jealous1stillnv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:37:40 2015 UTC,The beauty was in its simplicity ya know great but i am not sure what you want to say
OCPoetry,3cvd1f,RobinGayle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:36:43 2015 UTC,"i tried not to write it about specific things because i prefer it to be ambiguous, to suggest several things but not commit to one interpretation and exclude another.  but one of the things i was thinking about was the amount of poetry on this subreddit (and in general, of course) that features a speaker explicitly telling us how dark/corrupted/crazy they are. personally i find these speakers/characters/personas a bit tedious. you start faceless and you end saying nothing. a bit rude and maybe uncharitable but that's one of the things i was thinking when i wrote the poem."
OCPoetry,3ctu3j,MikelH,2,Fri Jul 10 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"I love it based upon the fact that: A.) I can relate to the feeling provoked by this poem, and  B.) The flow, the play with words, the description remind me of my own writing.   I think this is an accurate description of writer's block and how one has to ""forage"" for writing, especially when you must write."
OCPoetry,3ctu3j,Time09,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:00:35 2015 UTC,"I am currently stuck trying to write a poem for my brother's wedding and faced with trying to rhyme their story of how they met! Nightmare especially as the wedding is in 2 weeks! - This poem perfectly describes my feeling at the moment. I am impressed with your creativity and word choices, they flow very well, my poem sounds like its written by and for a child!"
OCPoetry,3cvqht,lickemandSTICKem,2,Sat Jul 11 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"I really like the second line, it's just ""The sun"", it makes me feel like the poem itself is slowly rising like the sun."
OCPoetry,3cvqht,CookizMonstz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:23:04 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was going for. A very brief rise then immediate dive back down. Just like me every single morning lol
OCPoetry,3cvqht,downtownseoul,2,Sun Jul 12 09:30:16 2015 UTC,"just an FYI, *revelling with two l's maybe the last line could be broken up? it's the kind of languid movement that doesn't happen all at once, i feel."
OCPoetry,3cvqht,downtownseoul,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:19:10 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you. A typo my phone didn't catch when I submitted this lol  As for the the last line, I was trying to have the end of the poem capture that feeling of falling back into bed and drifting off back to sleep. I agree with you on the kind of movement to a point, but can't seem to work it out where I break that line up and keep that effect, for myself at least.  How would you break it up, if you don't mind me asking? It could be I'm just not looking at objectively enough. Thanks for the feedback either way though!"
OCPoetry,3cvqht,NoisyCabbage,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:37:44 2015 UTC,"i would suggest maybe between dive and back, ending with 'back to my dreams'? that would just be my choice, i guess i like the enjambment of dive / back."
OCPoetry,3cvqht,Deus_Fax_Machina,2,Sun Jul 12 12:40:41 2015 UTC,Makes me feel as if something so profound like the sunrise can be pushed away with a button  Certainly very interesting idea indeed
OCPoetry,3csfpc,die_dunkle_seite,2,Fri Jul 10 12:00:23 2015 UTC,"""Lay our bones in catacombs""  That really struck me. Obviously for the near rhyme but the brevity and gravity of the line really resonates with me. Very well done."

OCPoetry,3csfpc,ancestralelf,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm new to oc poetry and english is not my native language, still, the musicality of what you created here and the message, really got me somewhere. Maybe it's  just because I feel your lines like I read it from my mind, or maybe you're just good."
OCPoetry,3csfpc,snbdmliss,2,Fri Jul 10 16:17:07 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this comment. I am happy that I can create something that speaks to people. I recently published my first complete work but I have pushed the boundaries since. Thank you again for your kind comments.
OCPoetry,3csfpc,downtownseoul,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"Overall I like this.  The theme is very interesting, and your words have good imagery.    However, the cadence tripped me up a little bit.  Some lines have too many or few beats to match with their lines above or below that it looks like you are trying to match with.  Also, there was a little bit of the rhyme structure that got confused in there.    For pacing of the poem, maybe it might be good to break it up into stanzas a bit more, unless that's not your style.     Lastly, the last line didn't match for me, and rather lost me.  Maybe that's just me?    Overall good read!"
OCPoetry,3csfpc,snooploli,2,Fri Jul 10 17:42:03 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your input.  I actually prefer the ""offbeat"" cadence and I use it quite often. It is a signature of sorts. This was amazingly constructive criticism. Thanks again!"
OCPoetry,3ct9v7,Redrum01,2,Fri Jul 10 16:24:23 2015 UTC,Pretty good!
OCPoetry,3ct9v7,derintellectual,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"Nice poem. Few things that I personally, would've enjoyed more.  I feel it guiding me, spurring me on  Reads better as:  I feel its guidance, spurring me on  ""I gulp down panic, choking back my fears I make my feelings plain Our aspiring hearts broke in unison As its sombre buzzes soothe my pain.""  This passage feels a little off to me as well. The first line definitely needs improved rhythm. ""I gulp down panic, choke back my fear"", for instance. Or perhaps ""I gulp down panic, choking back fear."" Prefer the first one personally.  ""Our aspiring hearts broke in unison"" should be ""Our aspiring hearts break in unison"" as the tense change is ill fitting with the rest of the passage."
OCPoetry,3ct9v7,shakyamunii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:23:02 2015 UTC,"The ""it"" seems to be the phone, though the first line would seem to equate ""it"" with ""a trademark buzzing."" Then ""it"" has glee and suddenly ""it"" is the major actor. And ""Our aspiring hearts broke in unison"" says that the relationship is one of tragedy.  Still the speaker continues to exchange messages with the other half of the broken hearted, as if to poke at a wouind and thus somehow enjoy the pain. So this ongoing exchange after the hearts break is a place that is new and different and which the poem is trying to manifest in the phone itself.  This could be really interesting.  Having embodied the pain/pleasure of the broken heart in the phone, will you now toss it - and the relationship away or use it to resolve somehow?"
OCPoetry,3cs8x7,bobthenotnobody,2,Fri Jul 10 10:32:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the other posters here. Personally, I don't think this is a very good poem. The first one we write never is though. The first stanza reads more like it should be part of a paragraph. There needs to be some sense of rhythm driving the timing of the poem that just isn't evident in any of the stanzas. ""Then she betrayed me / Then, my brother and my best friend betrayed me"" is probably one of the most awkward lines of poetry I've ever read.  Not to mention ""But when I was young I met a girl / She was older than me and we fell in love"" is literally just sentences. Your poem could be structured as a paragraph and it would make more sense than it does right now.  Can't you see it in my blue eyes? I'm a wolf, and I live in snow. This is where I can survive, where I can howl. But when I was young I met a girl; she was older than me and we fell in love. Then she betrayed me. Then my brother and my best friend betrayed me. I was all alone, and I haven't trusted anyone. Then I fell in love with you. Please just tell me why you did it, so that I can trust you again.  Using Then as the opening word of 3 lines in a 4 line stanza also does not read well by the way."
OCPoetry,3cs8x7,shakyamunii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:31:45 2015 UTC,"i agree largely, though i would also say that 'literally just sentences' isn't a bad thing in and of itself. but yeah, hitting enter (or whatever weird formatting reddit requires) after each sentence does not a poem make."
OCPoetry,3cs8x7,downtownseoul,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:07:39 2015 UTC,It would be nicer if you  could keep same stanzas with short last verse as in first stanza. Bit that's my subjective opinion as I like regular form and rhymes
OCPoetry,3cs8x7,Kellermann,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:54:41 2015 UTC,Your poems good just a few pointers I didn't really understand the sense of i can howl line if u remove it I think the flow would be better. Also the concluding line could've been better  Something like   Tell me the truth it will ease my pain Or even lie to me I still would trust you again  In the white snow the lone wolf howls  Ok but just my opinion otherwise well done
OCPoetry,3cs8x7,jealous1stillnv,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:34:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/jealous1stillnv on this one. Your ""I can howl"" line seems a little out of place. Seems like you had a bit of a rhyming scheme going with the other lines in your first stanza. Eyes/Survive. Maybe if you can incorporate your ""I can howl"" line with that a little bit, it would improve your flow."
OCPoetry,3cs8x7,MikelH,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"Please just tell me why you did it So that I can trust you again   is a powerful ending stanza, considering the prior content.  Very emotional:   Then she betrayed me Then, my brother and my best friend betrayed me I was all alone, and I haven’t trusted anyone Then I fell in love with you   Sorry about the drunken rage news :(  Hope you are feeling better!  It's a nice short poem dealing with important subject matter. I suggest improving the format slightly.  Thanks for sharing! Please keep writing!!"
