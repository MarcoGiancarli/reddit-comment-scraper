Some states have different qualifications, but typically to be paid a decent salary you'll want the MLS.  Librarianship is pretty competitive right now. Young librarians tend to have an edge because we can be paid less, although that would probably apply to you too. I'm not sure what type of librarianship you're interested it, but I feel like you'd be a stronger candidate for military librarianship than most civilians. Otherwise, I'm not sure what kind of edge it would give."
Libraries,3dygxr,myeyestoserve,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"There was a time that there was a shortage of librarians on military bases abroad. Based on my discussions with a recruiter about it, it sounded like essentially being a children's librarian at the base school. You'd still need the Bachelors and Masters, so probably 5-6 years of additional school. For an academic library job, a 2nd Masters or a PhD is very valuable. Plus tech skills and a passion for customer service. But in 5-6 years, things could be very different.   An undergrad degree in a hard science, if you enjoy it and are good at it, will be valuable for an academic library job. But then it would also qualify you for a higher paying non-library job."

Our most recently hired library technician (in our military library) had both an MLS and Veteran's preference (not sure off the top of my head if he had 5 points or 10 points).

But that could change in the 6 or so years between now and getting your bachelor's (assuming 2 years service + 4 year degree).  Try to work in a library part time while you're doing your degree and see if you like it.  Some schools offer undergrad librarian degrees that aren't worth it.

Not only that, but think about what happens as the current tech-savvy lib populations moves from their ""fresh out of grad school"" positions and into management.

So yeah, there's my perfect world scenario for public libraries in the US: we'll be able to capitalize on the influx of MLS grads by fully embracing a decentralized librarian workforce that blends teaching information literacy skills to the public through tech literacy.

I actually worked as a librarian who merged small developing world library catalogues, in order to produce national bibliographies. Fun except for those libraries who kept the catalogue records in Microsoft word!  My tip is if you have to use excel, try saving the document as a .CSV (comma separated) file. A systems librarian will be able to write a small program to import your records into a library catalogue, which is much easier from a nicely formatted CSV file.  Perhaps you could talk to a larger regional library, a great solution to this issue would be for the regional library to have a template excel spreadsheet that they could provide to all the smaller libraries.

You also might want to add columns like:  -publication date -ISBN -number of pages -reading level (for children's books) -call number (Dewey)  Most of this can be found on the book itself, other stuff (genre, reading level, etc) can be found on World Cat's website (just Google World Cat if you're unfamiliar).  As far as what system to use, if you're government uses Dewey, stuck with Dewey. It will be way easier in the long run. World Cat will also have suggested Dewey Call Numbers.

We have stipulations - non-perishable food items in good condition; each item removes $5 from a patrons overdue fines (but not fines for say, replacement costs or replacement cards or paying for prints or something).   This year, we only took in about 150 cans/items. But that's still a decent donation to the local food pantry.   We've had to turn away things like unlabeled cans (what is this?), bags of cereal (like, no box, just a clear bag of cereal), and handfuls of individual packets of... stuff (knockoff ketchup, some other sauces, powdered coffee creamer, etc)."

Libraries,3dn00s,_JackBlue,7,Sat Jul 18 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course it applies to everyone.  I've woken up people from all walks of life. There are a number of reasons, but the main one is that sleeping people take up valuable desk space that could be using it to study, our reading room is frequently full and the library is a place for study not a sleeping space. Also sleeping people often snore and/or drool, snorers are often woken up very quickly, because other members of the public come to get members of staff, and drooling is just plain nasty. Sleeping is often done by people who are also drunk which creates its own set of problems (including pissing themselves while they sleep which is pretty high up there on the list of things I don't want to have to deal with.). Finally,  it creates an unpleasant environment and people generally don't like studying/reading next to someone sprawled out."

We have some very specific policies on how to wake people up that include keeping the table they're sleeping on between them and you, and an absolute no touching rule. We're really suppose to stay at arms length and try to get them to wake up with words alone, and call for police/medical assistance if they don't respond.  It can sound silly, but the last thing any librarian needs is to get stabbed for waking up some sketchy person sleeping at a table."

You should (hopefully) be using a computer reservation program which keeps track of usage stats in all kinds of ways.  Same with wifi like the u/librariant noted, but this can be a little trickier to do.    Do you have self-check stations?  This could lead to a boost in circulation stats.  Do you offer scanning/faxing?  You can offer stats on that as well.  Same thing if you check out laptops or tablets.    Finally, if you are using RFID at your library, you can use a people counter device connected to your gates which will give you foot traffic numbers, which are always nice to present.

Between 1 and 2 is not a disaster, but something to think about. Happy to talk more about this one-on-one.   Compare to previous years. Compare to other libraries in your network. Compare total/direct circulation at your library to other libraries in your network of similar size.  Also - why are you looking at calendar years rather than fiscal years?  There are other things you can do to improve your circulation than buying multiple copies (which is, incidentally, a really good thing to do). You can weed under-used items. This will help with your turnover rate, and it will also make it more possible to display more books - facing books out helps encourage browsing.  I'd also encourage you to allow your reference books to circulate, to lower your fines, and to simplify your loan rules. This is particularly big with DVDs, which often only go out for a week or less and have high fines."

Libraries,3dibnr,Iswitt,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"In my state, when we say direct circulation, we mean circulation that happens, essentially, IN the library. So, if you sent a book to another library within your network, it would count as an ILL rather than as a circulation.  A longer loan period for DVDs by itself might result in a total number of circulations going down, yes. But the idea of loan rule standardization is that, if everything in the library goes out for, say, two weeks and has the same, relatively low daily overdue fine (we have ours at 10 cents), it's much easier to use the library and people are encouraged to check out more items.

So we did a big display taking popular shows from Netflix (or ones we had on DVD) and building displays of items that related to the show, fiction and non. People loved that and it drew a lot of attention. . I don't think CD circulation will ever increase again. When you live in a world where only two artists in a year sell more than a million albums (!) then you know people are torrenting, streaming, YouTube-ing and finding other ways like never before. If you circ video games at all, those will be gone forever in a few years as consoles move away from physical media. It's just the way it is."
Libraries,3dibnr,kodemage,2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Do you share numbers with other nearby systems?  Do you have multiple branches or just the one?  What are your numbers as far as total number of visitors? items checked out? How does that break down as average items per visitor?      I'm not really looking for the numbers myself, but those are some other ways to look at these things besides just number of books out the door.   At my library, we have the advantage of tracking these things across 4 branches, so while one branch might have a decrease, another might increase.   Building displays can help some - especially if you can find/tap into whatever is currently big among your patrons. But even then, over the course of a month, I'm not sure if it's really that big of a bump. Sometimes we do a 'Forgotten Gems' style display with books that are in good condition but haven't circulated lately. Displays that tie into other programming (speakers, movie night, summer reading) also help, too.   Do you do any outreach with the local schools? We've currently got a HUGE section set aside just for the summer reading and a selection of AR books. Easy to find, easy to re-shelve into that separate section. During the school year we do some other minor things with/for the schools as well."

Libraries,3dibnr,kodemage,2,Thu Jul 16 16:58:23 2015 UTC,"Our circ has been steadily going down also. It likely isn't your fault. It's the times we live in. Your trustees need to acknowledge that public libraries are changing from a place that provides information to a gathering place that provides services. As others have suggested in this thread, show your trustees computer and internet usage. Show them program attendance also.   Some recommendations for mitigating those circ numbers: Do you have a librarian that goes out to local establishments (starbucks, panera, community center, fitness center, and so on) to advertise your services? I have found that a lot of people don't know what we actually have ebooks and audiobooks  for checkout on their smartphones.   Have you done a foot traffic study? By this I mean have you looked to see where people walk a lot and put displays/items on a table or stand so that, when people walk by, they see them and go ""oooo""? A lot of times saving people the trouble of finding something in the stacks is enough to get them to pick up the item. Be vigilant about the displays though. If something is there and has not moved in 5-7 days, it's time to put something else there.   Do you do passport execution? Around where I am, a lot of post offices don't do this service anymore so the libraries picked passport execution up. It's an easy way to get people in the door. My experience has been that a lot of the people that come in to get their passports don't frequent the library, so they don't know what services we offer. Just yesterday I did passport execution for a family and told them about our ebooks and audiobooks while I was processing the passport forms. None of them knew we did anything like that.   Do your patrons know that circs mean money for the library? Circs are part of the equation where I live and a lot of our patrons don't know how the library gets money. It's taxes. That's all they know.   Get rid of those dead and grubby items. Keeping your shelves full of mostly nice books means the patron isn't innundated with tons of potentially outdated things when they go to the stacks. Not to mention how do you feel when you go up to the shelf and there are tons of books that look...questionable? Personally, if I see that I'm not likely to check something out.  Just some suggestions. I don't know if they will work for your library. Best of luck to you!"
Libraries,3dibnr,benfranklinsmustache,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"Books are on the way out. Your library needs to acknowledge this fact and embrace it. I think we've hit the tipping point where circs are down for almost everyone all across the country.   Many libraries are working on opening things like Media Studios and Makerspaces to keep the public engaged. You need to go to your board and say circs for physical items are down and they will keep going down because people are moving to ebooks. The same will eventually be true for all kinds of media, surely you've seen a similar decline in CDs if you stock them.   Libraries need to move towards providing a variety of services for the community not just acting as a book sharing service. We can help our community improve its digital literacy with computer classes and we can offer access to hardware and software that people simply can't afford on their own. Instead of investing in more books we need to aim for enabling the community with more access to knowledge whatever the form.   You cannot reverse this trend. Over the long term it's bigger than any of us."

Before, books and information were hard to find and needed, so libraries provided them. Now, computers, the Internet, and technology literacy are what is needed, so we must focus on those instead.  The problem isn't the change in trend. The problem is that the people doling out the moneys still look at number of circs to calculate how much money they give the library as opposed to switching that over to a more service-oriented calculation."

One thing I found to be good was to find a particularly gripping passage in the book. One that builds a lot of tension with the audience. Then just before the resolution/reveal of whatever is going on (sometimes the book does this for you in the form of a chapter change), stop. Use this method as your opener. Obviously this works well if you're comfortable in front of groups and have a strong reading voice that moves with the story. After this intro, you can easily move into the finer points of the book since you have their attention."

Don't talk about the plot of the whole book, but find one compelling thing in it and give a taste of that ; for me it's generally either the premise or the voice.

Libraries,3dfxkh,blkichigo,3,Wed Jul 15 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"Let me know if you have any questions about youtube.com/sanfranciscolibrary I make most of the things on there. It's a FT job, with PT help on shooting days. The goal is one and a half videos per week: about 50 new events each year, plus 25 archive tapes or internal training or misc. grant documentation.   (This is the main adult channel, later products from the newly opened teen media lab will be posted on their own teen channel.) The equipment was $50,000 and was from a three year purchase plan. You could get started for under $3,000 though and make great videos. The equipment is easy, having consensus goals among all the department stakeholders is hard.  You'll be managing expectations and saying No to people within six months.  Most event promotion is better handled by still pictures, unless it's a repeating event and then you can put new text filling in the video donut each month. (I'd put those directly on Facebook, so they auto-play in silence but the text tells the story.) I could keep rattling, but it probably wouldn't apply to you.  You'll have to look at SF, LA, NY and see what feels right to your library. They don't have a ""fun"" feel exactly.  Now look at the Carnegie Science Center. Really fun but sloppy (last time I looked).  Seattle Library just did an epic green screen project with summer campers.  Fun, but time consuming.  That takes it back to the consensus vision question. Given your library's equipment/personnel/time, what is the repeatable, achievable goal? Is it adult education classes, entertaining TED talks, news-style packages, or little ten-second nuggets of video?  All of those are valid to me.  But the audience (internal and external) develops an image of you pretty quickly- and then expects a regular rotation of content that fits that image.  I can tell when the new summer interns arrive at 92Y or Commonwealth Club or the JCC- content takes off for two months and then dies until next summer.  I don't mean to be overly serious about it, but you've already noticed ghost YouTube accounts. They didn't sell their libraries as well-planned and organized to you."

Honestly, what do you hope to gain from your YouTube channel? Are you trying to reach an existing audience of subscribers, or build a new one? How are you going to point people towards the videos (In the branch? Your website? Facebook? Because if it's Facebook, I'd recommend posting the video files directly on there rather than hosting them on YouTube - Your reach will be significantly higher...)

Libraries,3d2o6y,eestilove,7,Mon Jul 13 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Acid free is definitely the best. Since the diary and note book go together, you may want to consider an archival box to keep them together in and protect them from wear and uv light.  If you can't get a scanner to use for digitizing them, use a digital camera on a stand so the pictures are consistent. If the binding is brittle, you'll want a cradle of some kind to hold the without stressing the binding. It doesn't have to be fancy, two triangular pieces out of card stock like from a cereal box and put one under each side as you photograph the pages. How big the triangular pieces are will depend on how far the book can open without stressing the binding. You may also need something to hold the pages open during the process, depending on the book."
Libraries,3d2o6y,lvbiblio,3,Mon Jul 13 08:23:44 2015 UTC,"In reference to scanning it, you may want to see if there is an academic or special collection library near you that offers scanning services to the public. I know Penn State offers scanning services, I've visited their lab and they have some great digitization equipment that allows them to digitize an item without damaging it. I would not recommend trying to scan it yourself, the chances of damaging the binding is high. However, if that is all that is available to you due to cost or other circumstances, find a library that has book edge scanners. These scanner's scan beds go all the way to the edge of the machine allowing for the bound item to be scanned without pressing/flattening the binding."

A previous poster mentioned a book-edge flatbed scanner, which are great.  An even safer option would be an overhead scanner, where the document is scanned from above, so no pressure is put on the document at all, like this one.    I agree that you may want to check with your university to see if they have something like this.  You can also purchase your own (and perhaps return it when you're done, or resell?).    Hope this helps."
Libraries,3d2o6y,mimosa22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"Also, I would like to add that depending on the binding of the item, a flatbed scanner may not be a good idea. You want to place as little stress on the binding as possible when scanning the item. When scanning very old books (circa 1500s), we used foam cushions to support the books, and took photographs of each page one by one. The camera was mounted to prevent shaking, and was aimed straight down at the page being captured, with the verso pages and cover propped straight up, or as vertically as possible. This was to prevent stress on the books' bindings. With this method, you may see a portion of the adjoining (standing up) pages in your pictures. But, if the bindings are not too tight on your items, you may be able to crop the verso pages out. I hope this helps!"

Libraries,3ctt8l,AdavenKing,11,Fri Jul 10 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"There is more than one system of call numbers. Many college libraries in the United States use the Library of Congress classification system. On the other hand, many school libraries and public libraries in the United States use the Dewey Decimal system. It was invented by Melvin Dewey. He grouped books into categories and gave each category a number. For example, Math and Science got the number 500. As a librarian, any book I get about Math or Science will get a number in the 500s.   He even went so far as to make subcategories. Wild animals got the number 590. Reptiles got assigned 597.9. A subcategory of reptiles, lizards, was assigned 597.95. Any book by any author about lizards will be given the same number. Each idea is assigned a number, not individual books. As you can imagine as new technology comes along, more subcategories are created. It's an evolving system.  For the most part, true books (nonfiction) are given Dewey numbers. Books of imaginary stories like Harry Potter are not given numbers. Instead librarians put F or FIC on the book which stands for fiction. They are usually put on the shelf in order by author.  Some libraries have tried to be more like book stores. They put all the mystery books together and all the sports books together. The trouble comes when you get a book with both mystery and sports. Where do you put it?  Different countries have developed their own classification systems."
Libraries,3ctt8l,bluesimplicity,7,Fri Jul 10 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"Excellent description, but I'll add this: The Dewey system (the DDC) is ""prescriptive."" Dewey was setting up an ideal system for the organization of human knowledge. The Library of Congress system (the LC) is ""descriptive."" They already had a large collection which needed organizing.  As a result, the DDC is much easier to remember. There's an underlying theoretical logic to it and any experienced librarian can make a good guess at where to look for a subject, just by understanding the system. The LC system, though, is almost entirely a matter of memorization."

My thinking is that if you already have library experience and you're just looking to move up in a system that knows your worth, a free but sub-par education is all you need.

My experience w/ a lower tier library school is that a fabulous education is possible, but you can't sit back and expect it to be delivered to you. I don't know what it's like in a top program, but I can tell you looking at resumes that there are a lot of grads from top library programs with senses of accomplishment that are are not matched by their CVs.   I'm sure there is 20k worth of value in the top library school's education and networks. I'm equally sure that you can do as well if you are self-motivated and seek out opportunity by going to the free school. So, if you have the luxury to throw around 20k for a fancier degree, go ahead. It's like if you were buying a car. You could get a functional VW Jetta or you could take out 20k more in loans and get a fancy Audi A3. Both will get you to work. My view is that you'd be MUCH better off putting the student loan payments towards a down payment on a house and getting the free degree. There's got to be a better use you can put that 20k toward than a posh-upgrade to the same degree."

Still, it's probably a wiser decision for you to attend the free program. As wonderful as some of the more expensive programs are, it's true that your work experience counts much more strongly at the end of the day. The difference in long-term outcome is not worth putting yourself into tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

I suspect it is because the university is proud of the GSLIS program and it is not just tack-on diploma mill."

I've often shared the same observation, that people who go to crappy schools think library school is worthless, but it's nice to see someone else agree.  Incidentally, I also went to UIUC.  Furthermore, I've worked at a handful of academic institutions and 2 Fortune 100 companies and been on dozens of search committees.  Every single one of them was impressed with degrees from Ivy League schools and the best library schools.  Given candidates of similar skills and experience, we always choose the best school.  I understand people don't like to hear that.  It's very warming to think that the world judges each of us on our own unique characteristics, but the truth is that we've always had so many applicants that beginning the process with a quick sort to reduce the number has been both necessary and useful."

Libraries,3cr7hx,riverfaerie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"I can't say for this place specifically, but I would say it depends on the job and your qualifications. For a low-level or entry position, I found years ago ( when I was applying for such things) that location absolutely did matter. I never got interviews outside of my state but got several as soon as I stated applying in-state.  However, given people's insistence that there isn't normally an issue with this, I've come to assume that it's a matter of experience and desirability. Which makes some sense.   From a hurting stand point, for a lower level position, why should they look far afield to hire when there are undoubtedly numerous qualified candidates nearby?   Either way, I would suggest that you still apply if you want the job. It never hurts to apply."

Is your volunteer at all technology literate? If so, you could ask him too test DVDs that are reported damaged and clean them if your cleaning machine is user friendly enough.  Project based work could be great too. If you are doing any weeding, make a list of books and have him pull the them and put them on a cart. Our volunteer helps with weeding all the time in this way. Our CDs needed a lot of attention and we couldn't have completed our weeding project in that section without her.

I think the key might be less changing what you have him do and more expressing that you're not treating him differently; these are the tasks that are the most helpful for a volunteer to do for the library. They might seem simple, but it's important for you to have clean, neat shelves.  We often use our volunteers to clean board books or toys (a few swipes with a lysol wipe to get the grubby feeling off) and to block the shelves (line everything up nice and neat). We also have a train table with two sets of trains and legos. We have three bins, but everything gets mixed together, so every so often a volunteer will sort it all out for us."

The second question: Is the new job a better job? What factors are most important to you? For example, I hate driving. If the new job cuts the commute by 30 minutes each way, that's a hell of a benefit. How much do you care about exactly which age group you're serving?

Some of the libraries discussed are getting rid of a ton of books (300,000 at one place, a million at another), but this probably isn't happening just because of ebooks. They aren't cutting a million print books and replacing them with a million ebooks. The books being cut have probably not been circulating all that well and these libraries probably haven't been weeded properly in a while."

Weeding is also something that, unless you do it properly and do it constantly, you can get in trouble with (like the libraries in this article) the public. People notice if you have to throw out a million books. It's easy to get scared off by the potential PR issues.

Libraries,3ck32l,bookchaser,3,Wed Jul 8 18:08:57 2015 UTC,This is a really interesting line of thought. I've heard that people in poor communities often have pretty decent smart phone numbers because they use them as their only source of internet. Smart phones are a great ebook platform. This seems like a potentially good combination.  A little support for smart phones among poorer communities: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/25/smartphones-digital-divide_n_1546899.html
Libraries,3ck32l,ergonaut,2,Wed Jul 8 18:32:29 2015 UTC,"IMHO, the 'poor people have smart phones' belief is generated by right wing media to suggest poor people are to blame for their poverty.  My experience with poor families at a Title I elementary school in California is of being asked whether I would train parents how to use a web browser. Those who had cell phones had clamshell pay-as-you-go dumb phones with no reasonable use of the Internet. They certainly didn't own e-readers.  If a parent has a smart phone, it's not safe to assume children have smart phones or even get to share their parent's smart phone. We're talking about a country where half of all Americans are low income or living in poverty, and there is a federal breakfast and lunch program to assure kids get two meals a day. Some areas even have dinner programs.  Sorry, your question wasn't really only about kids. I can understand that if a poor person has a smart phone, it's probably their own Internet-enabled device because they can't afford both a smart phone and a tablet or bargain basement laptop, and a pay for Internet access on a second device.  It makes free Internet terminals in public libraries all the more important."

My experience with poor parents is that most don't take their kids to the public library. We gave poor kids gift certificates to a local bookstore, and many went unredeemed. It's why school libraries are vital. If the school doesn't provide it, the kids may not get it at all.  The question is, do the families not go to the public library due to time and transportation restraints, or because they don't value the library? If it's time and transportation, then maybe e-books would be of value to them."

Opening up about something like this (safely) puts her in a position to be able to both mentor you for the job search AND help find ways to uncramp your current work situation.  New job openings and opportunities are part of the profession. It's not a betrayal or disloyal to look after your prospects, but it can get weird. It's best when people are able, behind closed doors, to be frank and up front about what's going on. That's not always possible, but if it is in your case, you can set a good tone for future boss relations by doing her the favor of being appropriately honest with her."
Libraries,3cgtj0,Alushia,4,Tue Jul 7 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"I second /u/ellbeecee's approach to it.  It depends on context and how things are with your boss, but at my last library my boss was aware that I wanted to move up in the ranks and she was supportive of that and is the type of person that wants to see others succeed. My current boss is also very supportive and I'd feel perfectly comfortable giving him a heads up on future changes.   Since you mentioned your boss being married to someone at the potential place - My last boss is married to my now-current boss (they work at two different library systems). Prior boss was able to vouch for my work ethic and skills and new boss was able to trust that judgement (unexpected networking, I guess?)   I was also able to learn a bit more of what they wanted in a new hire through the boss at the old place (ex: one thing you wouldn't see on the job posting, they wanted was someone ""nice"" to help counter-balance some of the personality types there. Even though I'm the quiet type, I've got super-friendly customer service skills so I was able to bring that to the table). So having ties between the new and old place can help you kind of guage what other expectations and needs there are, or maybe see what skills you can improve on to be able to match their needs.

I don't think they required very high scores though. Pretty reasonably priced, because I was able to get in state tuition. 36 credits. Multiple tracks available- tech, childrens, etc. I don't know enough to compare it to other programs now. Most of my classes were real time and required attendance, either 6-8 or 8-10 pm.   The vast majority of jobs requiring an MLS will specify it needs to be from an ALA accredited program.  Try to find out how often noncore classes you want to take will be offered. I missed out on a couple classes, because I finished in four semesters, and they were rarely offered.  Depending on where you are geographically, look into the Academic Common Market. You may be able to get in state tuition at an out of state program if your state doesn't offer an ALA accredited program.  Consider a focus in youth services if that is of interest to you. In my system, it is arguable there are more options for youth services staff in terms of promotions. But you should research your local systems or systems you're interested in to see how they are structured.  Speaking a second language will make you more competitive. Customer service experience, even outside libraries will make you more competitive. And most importantly, you will need library experience to be competitive in the job market.    It is still a buyers market right now. There are not enough full-time public library positions for all the MLS grads. If you join a few groups on Facebook or hang out with libs on Twitter, you'll hear a lot about this.   I don't want to be discouraging.

I don't personally like the online set ups where you are essentially self-taught and rarely ever have a session with a teacher. We had weekly sessions with our professors.   So, first off, I recommend looking for am online program that has all classes taught live. Second, find out what skills you went and ask which courses they have cover those skills. I really wanted to learn some more about managing electronic databases, websites, and web content, for libraries. USM ended up not really having classes for that. (i have heard that they have since broadened their content in this area.)  Third, cost does not determine quality. USM was very affordable and I never felt like the quality of my instruction suffered.   As for places to avoid, I don't know about many other programs. I did look into the University of Alabama.

The one thing I wish I'd known before starting was what exactly I wanted to do with the degree, and where in the library world I wanted to end up.  I started my MLIS with just sort of a vague idea of ""I would like to be a librarian!"" but not enough actual direction, and I sort of spent my first few semesters just taking a mishmosh of classes (there are only 2 required courses in the program, everything else is pretty much up to you).  I don't necessarily think all the classes I took early on were a waste, but there are classes I wish I could had taken that I just didn't have time for by the last semester or two.  With that said, the advising staff at GSLIS are really fantastic, and they helped me out a lot."

Libraries,3c5117,jmurphy42,2,Sun Jul 5 04:01:42 2015 UTC,"I just completed my MLS with Texas Woman's University. I enjoyed the program very much. No GRE,  I took the Miller Analogies Test. I volunteered extensively in the public and school library settings throughout the program, enriching my academic experience, increasing networking opportunities, and bolstering my employment prospects. I worked with students from Alaska to Germany over the two years. The program is do-able, even while raising a family.   Most of the professors were outstanding, and the lessons learned outside of the curriculum (advocacy, presentation, etc.) will always be relevant. That was my personal experience. I wish you the best as you seek your own!"

Libraries,3c5117,kaiserverbalbyrnes,2,Sun Jul 5 01:34:27 2015 UTC,I'm glad you are looking for a library job that doesn't require an MLIS. I think it is important to work in a library if you are obtaining your Master's online since you do not make as many connections in an online environment. I think you will find it easier to find an MLIS job with library experience and the connections you make on the job after graduation.

They do offer the program in person and I didn't feel as though my education suffered because I was online. I did not have to take the GRE or any type of graduate entrance exam and I did not have to write a thesis, though I did have to put together an electronic portfolio."

I just want to second what everyone else has said about synchronous classes (as opposed to asynchronous, self-paced courses). I think you can get a lot more out of the coursework when you have opportunities to interact in real-time with your professor and your classmates, and the synchronous classes offer that. We did group work, presented projects to each other, and could chat about the content during class in a little chat window. I feel like the ""meeting of the minds"" and hearing different perspectives was really critical to my learning, especially since there were people from all walks of life and all parts of the country in the program."

My one complaint was with a particular course. Research Methods. We didn't write a single paper. It was strange and I thought, a complete waste of time and money. Maybe it was that particular professor, but I don't know. That was really my only complaint. What I would recommend to you is to take GRE test prep classes. I am not a good test taker either, but the GRE courses taught me how to take the test. You may find a program you really want to apply for and then you won't have any GRE scores if they require it."

Like at my program, we frequently went out tours thoughout various libraries & museums, did preservation workshops in class, met with AV masters to learn about different older formats, played with boxes full of computer parts, etc etc etc. And while yes, librarians should all be masters at doing things online, I find it hard to imagine having gotten a lot out of a fully online program.

Libraries,3c1u4p,alonelyargonaut,2,Fri Jul 3 23:54:48 2015 UTC,"We had the sales pitch from CollectionHQ and then the reality of funding reared its ugly head. At this point, our selectors are just circ reports from our ILS system, which of course, doesn't give the best picture.   Our budget has been so strangled, I doubt we could afford this type of luxury. So, I'm very curious as to what gets discussed here."
Libraries,3c1u4p,gruntledlibrarian,2,Sat Jul 4 10:58:31 2015 UTC,"We are using CollectionHQ (CHQ).  I. Love. It. It shows me hard data that I can give to staff that I generate into reports for them to use. I'm a weeder. If it is old, outdated, grundgy, has that ugly bookbinding I recall from my childhood, or just plain old has not circ'ed in a while, I say get rid of it. People don't want old books and we don't have infinite shelving. Hence, my favorite things are the dead, grubby items reports, and ""experiments"".   Dead item reports show items that haven't circ'ed in so many years, whatever you set it to: 2 years, 1 year, 6 months, and so on. Dead reports show you what percentage of a collection (adult fiction, fantasy, the 500s) is dead. this is great. When I run this report I can say to who ever is in charge of that collection ""Hey, the X section is 20% more dead than it should be. Do you think you could take this Dead Item report (from CHQ) and withdraw as many as you can from the collection?""  Grubby reports show you high circ things. The ""grubby"" comes from CHQ thinking that after going out 50 times, a book might start to look a little, well, grubby. Time check on the item, see if it is grubby and order a new one and/or withdraw it.   Experiments are things like ""I wonder what will happen to the circ of these items if I put them over here instead of over there."" I do these often. I make a little catchy display, put items in these ""experiments"", and CHQ tracks their circs for the duration of the experiment. At the end I get to see how things did. I've been pretty surprised. Items that only went out once or twice the year prior have gone out 2+ times during the month I held an ""experiment"". Granted, it shows you what you probably knew already, the more advertising you give something the more likely people will be to check it out, but now there is hard data to back it up. People can argue with hard data all they want, they'll just be wrong.  Other nice things are seeing what is in demand for each section and assigning tasks with reminders to do things. We haven't used these yet as we are just getting a handle on weeding, but I see their potential.   A downside has been that it ingests your ENTIRE collection. That being said, with such a large amount of data there are some anomalies. For example, running a dead items report for the 800's gave us some items that we shelf in with the classics. This was fine though because CHQ didn't give an 800's call number. It gave the call number we use for those anomalous items. People might complain about that so just FYI. Oh and staff push back. People take it real personal when you ask them to weed their section. They also say ""I weeded that section two years ago"" or ""I just weeded that 6 months ago"". They didn't; they just don't want to tend their section. The numbers can't lie.   I'm not sure what the cost is, as I'm not privy to that info. I'm also not sure how good a job our ILS did of this, as I was never trained on that. Sorry I can't give that comparison."
Libraries,3c1u4p,mustEscapePants,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:41:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply!  Why would ingesting the entire collection be a downside?  I get the sense from talking to others that most of the reporting is done via monthly information dumps to the CHQ.  A spreadsheet that has to be manually curated.  And that ""on the fly"" reporting (on-demand) is fairly limited.  Is that your experience, and if so would more immediate on-demand reporting be something you'd find useful?"
Libraries,3c1u4p,mustEscapePants,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:56:56 2015 UTC,"It isn't TECHNICALLY a downside, but I guess when this was introduced to staff and reports were run, people said ""See? It put this item in the 800's report when we don't shelve it there. This CHQ thing is broken."" It added to the staff resistance.   Yup. Every month CHQ has new reports for us and, depending on what report you are looking at, you can compare different data.   The spreadsheet is manually created, but I like that. I can choose what data I export to the spreadsheet and then distribute it to staff so that they can handle their sections. This kind of reporting is really useful for deads and grubbies.   So far I have found the reports informative and not limiting at all, but remember we just really started using this earlier in the year. We'll have to be using it longer to know for sure really. You have to know what the numbers all mean in the reports. That's the thing. When I first started doing reports I didn't understand what anything meant (I'm a jump in the deep end right away sort of person when learning things). I like that I can easily see what areas are understocked, overstocked, improving in performance, how dead my collections are, and more. I also like that if anyone has a dispute about any of these things that they can look at the data or an unbiased report.   More immediate on-demand reporting such as...? Do you mean something like what is trending, like how twitter or reddit works?"

Libraries,3bx26a,sharksarecutetoo,11,Thu Jul 2 21:25:22 2015 UTC,"For a smaller specialized collection like that, it might work better to come up with a custom system. For example, you could group by the subjects that are most meaningful for your office, then by format, author/title, publication date, etc. Whatever you come up with just needs to be internally consistent and flexible enough to include all the types of materials you have.   The library I work in has a very specific subject focus, and if we'd cataloged by DDC or LOC, all 80,000+ books would be in the same narrow range of call numbers, which isn't terribly helpful. It all depends on how people use the materials. Are they browsing subjects they're interested in? Do they need all materials by the same author grouped together alphabetically, or is it more important to organize by material type or publication date?"

Libraries,3bx26a,coltranedis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:20:04 2015 UTC,Can you give me an example of the custom system your library uses? It's most important for us to access the information by subject and date
Libraries,3bx26a,retrievethekraken,2,Mon Jul 6 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"Sure! For example, in our city directories, a call number could be: Directories 2013 New York. All the directories would then be shelved together by year and then by city.   In another area, it might be [Subject] [Year] [Author], if it's useful to have works by the same author together. For a small section of books, it could just be [Subject] [Author]. So, for the history section it could be History 1950 Smith, or just History Smith if the years aren't important. Or H Smi, if you'd prefer to use abbreviations.   There's no need to make the system more complicated if the books are findable with a simple one. All a call number needs to do is enable you to find a known item or browse a collection. We only add sections to a call number if further organization is required, such as numbering volumes in a set or splitting up all the Smiths by adding first names. In that case it could be History 1950 Smith, John v. 1. Just be consistent in applying the call numbers to each category, so you don't end up with things filed under both Directories NY and Directories 1999 New York, or use D to abbreviate both Directories and Dictionaries.   We post a list on the first bookshelf of all the possible call numbers, a description of each, and the physical location, so staff can see how they're organized and where to find the start of each section."

Face coverings like the niqab are not mentioned, and it's more contentious issue with a lot of recent litigation. However, Title VII mentions that if the religious dress poses ""undue hardship"" to the employer in terms of security or other concerns, it may be banned.  Either way, I don't think this guy has any legal standing to wear that in your library since it's not for religious reasons. But you need to have a rule on the books banning face covering that isn't for religious reasons, I'd guess. I worked at a rare books library (very different admittedly) that had a LOT of rules, because of past thefts, and difficult patron compliance was basically down to consistent enforcement by library staff and assistance from security guards."

For example, a behind the scenes online tour of the library - that sounds super cool! I've taken in-person behind the scenes tours at libraries such as the British Library, and they are really interesting. I'd love to see one at the BPL! And having librarians blog about their work in the library would also be interesting to read (at least to me, a fellow librarian...I would hope other people find our work interesting too!).   However, you completely discredit yourself by arming yourself with false information. We discussed this in a different thread and yet you keep repeating your opinions in place of fact. Simmons College is not failing; it has an excellent program and offers the exact same courses in library studies and archives as your much-touted U of A. The instruction is not out of date. You claim they are overpriced, but then suggest that BPL have a teaching program run by Northeastern...have you seen how much tuition is for Northeastern grad programs? It is hard to compare since Northeastern does not have a library science program, but looking at comparable programs their courses would run roughly $700 more than Simmons. And as I said to you before, the job market is already over-saturated here in the Northeast, the last thing we need is another program educating more librarians when jobs are continually being cut and/or not filled when someone retires.

Libraries,3bpcsh,vampirelibrarian,3,Wed Jul 1 03:36:09 2015 UTC,"When I did my internship at a public library, one of my duties was to have a sit down with each staff person at some point and talk about their background & how they got where they are. It was a real eye-opener. I was surprised to see which staff were officially lib assistants vs librarians (because, like the public, they all looked the same to me from the outset). It was also surprising to see which positions required the MLIS vs did not. For ex, at the particular library I was at, the copy cataloging position did not require the degree, but the subject headings position did. The guy who was known & loved by patrons as the best scifi readers advisory staff was a lib assistant while other librarians had far less knowledge in this area. There were folks with massive amounts of technical knowledge that ran the media lab like wizards, who didn't have the degree. At some universities, the acquisitions staff have vast stores of knowledge about every single rare books publisher out there & where to find random book X, yet don't necessarily require the degree for such support positions. In some larger cities or universities, you can make $50k+ as a lib assistant. It varies so much depending on the library you're in. All of these are reasons why I really stress trying to land a job in a library as a library assistant before taking the plunge & going to grad school.  edit: what I really meant to say is don't write off library assistants just because they have the word ""assistant"" in the title. It's not a nothing job. They often have just as much knowledge & responsibility as a librarian."

Many will hire non-MLS holding staff to work service desks (like circ), stacks maintenance, or ILL, etc. If there aren't library positions available, look for admin. assistant positions or basically anything else to get your foot in the door at a university, but research it well! Make sure you get in at a university that offers tuition benefits to faculty and staff. This is what I did. My employer (a mid-sized state university) offers free tuition at any in-state school within the same university system (i.e. the public university system, not the community college system, or a private school). My classes are all online via the state's flagship university. I do have to pay for my books and a tech fee--that's usually around $500 per semester, but I could be paying $6,300 every semester (or more if I did an out-of-state program), so it's a sweet, sweet deal--especially considering that many of my coworkers, who are faculty librarians, have on average $44,000 in student loan debt for their graduate degrees."

Not that we have any problem with hiring them into librarian positions, but they have to go through the application/interview process like every other applicant. There's no automatic step - partly because the librarian hire process here is a faculty hiring process, and that's different from staff and partly because we want to make sure we are hiring the best candidate we can for the position, whether they come from inside the library or outside)."

You know, make sure you actually like librarianship!  One word of advice, if you do start down this path, don't necessarily mention your intent to pursue graduate study in your interview. Your employer will want you to be committed to the job you're being hired to do first and foremost (understandably so).   Edit to add: Regarding your original question, I've learned far more about libraries from working in them than in my MLS (really MS in Information Sciences) program. What the MLS program has been better at is teaching some systems or IT programs that we don't have in my library. It's also been good at exposing me to tangential career possibilities (data and knowledge management, project management, data analysis, etc. etc.)  That said, I found the books used for the three required core classes in my program to be really useful:  Introduction to Information Science by Bawden and Robinson  Reference and Information Services by Cassel and Hiremath  The Organization of Information by Taylor and Joudrey  If you want something a little more theoretical--looking ahead at the future of librarianship, check out David Lankes' Atlas of New Librarianship.

I work in a flyover state (Indiana) and many, MANY of our rural libraries do not require an MLS even to be the director in a small town. My branch does require an MLS, but also hire lib assistants who have the experience, but not the degree, and the pay scale is not all that different from mine.

Academia's far tougher: some academic libraries (NYU, for example) will hire someone with a subject masters into a librarian position, but they are required to get the MLS to move to the tenure track.

The pages voted to unionize (like 73% yes) because the clerks and librarians were apart of AFSCME and had some things that we did not.   While starting conversations with others seemed awkward at first, we were all adults about it and were able to chat about things we wanted and feared. When the administration sent out letters basically lying about some things...it galvanized us to vote yes.   What did we get? We got a 3 consecutive years of pay raises locked in and also bargained for and got seniority and just cause clauses. The union had a labor lawyer sit down bi-weekly with anyone that wanted to put in feedback about what we wanted...and in 1 employee's case, what she did not want. She had voted NO and wanted to make sure her fears were still voiced.  All in all it was a very positive experience. I have since moved out of the city & system but was very happy with how things went. It was fortunate timing too, as the state Governor began dismantling unions the next year, and the 3-year contract protected hundreds of people from 14% pay cuts."

We have four main unions; one for the librarians, one for the administrators (HR), one for support staff (pages, circulation, secretarial), and one for contracted employees (I'll be honest with you, their union is the shittiest shit).   So I guess I'm asking, what do you want to know specifically? I should mention, in my city, many people argue that the unions have too much power (and there is something to be said there).

Being tied in with the faculty gets them a whole bunch of other sweet things, like research days! It also ties them to the fact that they need to be publishing papers in order to be considered for promotion. The unions do take away some of the individual bargaining power, but I think they generally get MORE than a fair deal from the University. You get step increases, and guaranteed raises every year, a stupid amount of vacation days (seriously, it's like 6 weeks).  HOWEVER scoring one of these contracts is ridiculous. You're more likely to end up in the shittiest shit union, where you don't get sick time, you don't get vacation days (paid 6%), your contract is only for like, 3 months at a time, etc. Because the faculty contract is such a sweet and ripe fruit, they are REALLY cracking down on the number of positions qualify in an attempt to save money.

In my non-union system, I was expected to work unpaid overtime every day to either open the branch or close the branch. In my union system, that's worked into the schedule as paid time, which is as it should be, I think. In my non-union system, raises were partially based on yearly performance reviews (you might get 3.5% for a better review vs. 2.5% for a worse review). In my union system, everyone gets the same raises based on title and seniority. It's a bit demoralizing to feel like I don't get rewarded at all for going above and beyond, especially when my raises have been kind of sad lately! It's easier to fire people in a non-unionized system, obviously. I don't want to see anybody getting fired for bad reasons, but I do think it's bad for morale when people who have terrible attitudes or who are just warming a chair till they get to retirement age or who are outright bullies are kept on indefinitely.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like it's worth arguing over, for example, whether we get 15 minutes of paid time off every two weeks to cash checks when most of library staff has direct deposit anyway.

It's certainly a benefit. Wages are much higher than they would be otherwise and you can just do your job knowing that someone is working for your interests. The union at my past job was quite aggressive in pursuing pay equity between female-dominated library positions and other similar male-dominated positions in the municipal government and secured several raises because of it.  I suppose the downside is that it also protects people who should honestly be fired. I've worked with people who threw books at patrons, who said racist remarks, who were drug addicts, etc. If they had passed their probation period none of them were fired. Sometimes they were politely asked to change their behaviour or were shuffled off to another branch in the system for a ""fresh start"". That is a tiny minority though. And it's not entirely due to the union, at least in Canada there is a certain amount of leeway in library jobs for making mistakes and not losing your job due to the discretion of the managers."

Libraries,3bjx5w,Branical,30,Mon Jun 29 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"Often ""donation"" is slang for ""to be sold by the friends' of the library, not actually put on a shelf"""
Libraries,3bjx5w,Hipster_Bear,4,Mon Jun 29 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"Obviously we would want at least 1 copy to remain in circulation so as many kids could enjoy it as possible, but we're expecting a few copies to be sold. Does the staff member that makes that decision tend to look through a book first to see if kids would like it, or does it automatically get sold?"
Libraries,3bjx5w,Hipster_Bear,19,Mon Jun 29 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"You have your work cut out for you.  If you've previously been published your odds are better, but even then they're not great.  Depending on the size of the library, they might have a director for the children's department.  If they do, this would be the person to talk to.  Don't get too hopeful, though.  You might be surprised how often people will show up at a library hoping to get their self-published books on a shelf.  And you might be surprised how often these self-published books are really bad.    Often after a rejection they'll find silly ways of trying to get it stocked, like requesting to check out ten copies and asking the librarian to stock it because of that.  This kind of behavior tends to make librarians not like self publishers.  Many libraries have limited space on shelves, and they fill these spots by going through their selection policy.  I can't remember the sources my wife uses to find reviews, but if she can't find any real reviews of the book, it never gets bought.  The only time she takes any donations is if they're valuable and will definitely be circulated.  Smaller libraries are sometimes more flexible.  Likewise, if you're good friends with the children's librarian, they'll often do a bit for you.  It's not impossible, but it'll be a ton of work and possibly a ton of luck as well.  Hopefully a rural librarian can come on here and tell you how difficult that might be.  Edit: Wife confirms.  Selection policy insists on reviews from review journals or review blogs.  Getting your book reviewed will make a difference in getting it shelved, but even then the self-publishing will hurt you."
Libraries,3bjx5w,ergonaut,2,Mon Jun 29 21:35:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your insight, we will definitely keep this in mind! Do you think there are other places that would be easier to donate to, maybe school libraries? Or do they have similar donation requirements?"
Libraries,3bjx5w,Hipster_Bear,7,Mon Jun 29 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Try to get some real reviews. Try to get it in the local papers. Ask if you can do a reading/signing at the library. Maybe the library will take one. Don't try to get more than one. Know that if the book doesn't circulate in a year, it will likely get thrown out."
Libraries,3bjx5w,vampirelibrarian,5,Tue Jun 30 11:22:36 2015 UTC,"School libraries often have more strict selection policies, but it varies from district to district. (Some districts get little to no book funding, so they're more willing to scrounge, but others are might be more worried about covering their butts, so they won't slide from their policies for anything.) Odds are good that with a five minute conversation you'll have a good idea as to whether they'll want it or not."
Libraries,3bjx5w,Fillanzea,4,Mon Jun 29 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"For our library, any book that gets donated goes to the friends and they sell it for 25 cents. Unless it REALLLLLLLY catches the eye of the librarian, we want more copies, and the copy is in excellent condition."
Libraries,3bjx5w,stuckinabook,13,Tue Jun 30 02:27:27 2015 UTC,"It takes a significant amount of time and staff effort to catalog a book and process it for adding to the collection... so every donation that gets added to the library catalog is in effect a demand on the library's time and money.   In my current library, we don't accept donations at all (unfortunately, I'm in an area where books are a big vector for bedbug transmission!), but in my previous library, we wouldn't add a donated book to the library collection unless there was already a record in the catalog for it. That certainly wouldn't necessarily be the case in all libraries! But I suspect you'd hear a lot of that in large library systems.  When you call, you can ask to speak to the person in charge of collection development for children's materials -- but any librarian on duty should be able to tell you about their policy for donations. (And if it's a larger library system, expect them to tell you that there's no person at the branch who does collection development -- often this is done centrally rather than in individual branches.)"

Libraries,3bjx5w,MrsSylviaWickersham,9,Mon Jun 29 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"Just want to give you a little hope. I'm a librarian, and my library has a local author collection. Now, we don't necessarily put everything that we get into the collection. But we will at least seriously consider it. And if it fits in with our collection development policy and we think it will circulate, we will add it to the collection.  Of course, its not a guarantee, but hopefully you'll find some libraries willing to give you a chance. I definitely second the comment about trying to talk to someone specific about getting your book into the collection. Best of luck!"
Libraries,3bjx5w,fifteensmiles,2,Tue Jun 30 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"We have a number of truly terrible books from local authors (and some pretty okay ones). If it's from a local author and doesn't violate any of our collection policies, we'll accept it into the collection. Some libraries are much less strict on this than others!"
Libraries,3bjx5w,ergonaut,4,Tue Jun 30 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely don't bring it in as a regular donation! Start with libraries in your local area, explain that you're a local author. They may have a special collection for that purpose. I know my library has a surprising number of self-published children's books but most of them have to do with the local area history or wildlife (I'm in South Florida, so for us that usually means books about manatees)."
Libraries,3bjx5w,ladyerwyn,2,Tue Jun 30 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"My library has a pretty open local authors collection, but we still probably wouldn't want more than one copy, unless the book has good reviews and/or is locally relevant. The people to contact would be in the children's department or collection development."
Libraries,3bjx5w,jeanclaudevanDAM,2,Tue Jun 30 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"We're based in San Diego and there's 33 branches of the county library and their website says they gladly accept self-published works from local authors. It's a great start, but of course we'd also like a more nationwide donation distribution. So we'd be better off waiting a month or two until the reviews start being posted. What places do you look at for reviews?"
Libraries,3bjx5w,librariantattooed,3,Tue Jun 30 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"School Library Journal, Kirkus, Booklist, that kind of thing. Occasionally a major outlet like npr or the New York Times, but a book being in one of those usually signals that we'll need multiple copies of a book we likely already have."

For my most recent job posting I received phone calls or emails from about 30% of the applicants. To the best of my knowledge, none of them got my email or phone number from HR. You should be able to find the hiring manager's contact information on the law school's website.   I personally don't mind a call from candidates early in the process. Don't expect an immediate request for an interview because of your call, but generally someone is willing to tell you if your application has been received."
Libraries,3bc5ui,littlesharks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"When you applied, did the job description say ""no MLIS required"" explicitly or did they just not mention needing one? It's been my experience that most institutions (my own job searching in the past and having been on hiring committees) will not hire someone with a Master's degree for a job that can be done without one. Especially if it's a job in circulation. But, as you said there is a supervisory component so that could easily push them into looking at MLIS holder. Just keep your head up and your fingers crossed! Typically, when dealing with large institutions (i.e. not special or public library jobs) it is a mistake to follow up. Usually applications get weeded out at multiple levels, and sometimes by algorithms that knock off applications if they do/don't have certain keywords and/or missing fields in an online application form. And, usually they don't give you a direct name of someone to follow up with. It usually just ends in confusion.    Sorry, that all seems rather dower and that's not what I'm trying to say. tl;dr ...

Libraries,3b9d9t,Library-tech,8,Sat Jun 27 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"From my 8 years in the public library, there is a lot of cross departmental work.  So many blurred lines between info/circ/page/tech.  While there might be some benefits of having a specific sub, I think one would miss out on a lot of valuable experience you can find from the users with various library and library-related backgrounds in this particular sub."

I had just been reading some articles and conference proceedings on the (sometimes) conflict between paraprofessional staff and librarians and it made me realize that I hadn't seen a subreddit for lib.techs. Has anyone seen library-type specific subreddits? Again, probably don't need them, just curious. I'm new to reddit but I've worked in libraries in a variety of jobs and library types for 11 years and I'm interested in the general library community on reddit :)"
Libraries,3b9d9t,PHilDunphyPHD,3,Sun Jun 28 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"I think the conflict arises because of the defensive-stance librarians take because they feel threatened by the current trends of replacing degreed librarians with paraprofessional staff.  Librarians are the only ones to blame for the degradation the profession is taking.  They're good at talking about how important libraries are but they mostly waste their breath on other librarians or people who already have the same mindset, but that's a whole other rant for another day!  The sidebar here has some good subs that relate."
Libraries,3b9d9t,Mhysa25,2,Sun Jun 28 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"I work in an academic library as a technician and there is some conflict between the salaried librarians and the hourly technicians.  The big issues are salaries and benefits.  Most of the hourly annual salaries top out at around $40K and that's only if you've been around since the late 70s/early 80s.  The average hourly is in the lower 30s annually.  Salaried staff start in the mid 40s for new hires to up to almost 100K for directors.  The salaries for both levels are low by regional academic standards and when there was more political support for higher ed funding, there was a merit raise fund.  I'm not sure that was used according to the intent because most of the raises went to people within 5 years of retirement, with the intent of raising their pension payouts. In my view, the merit raises should have gone to people hired within the past 5 years who got hired at rates lower than their peers.  They're also the ones more likely to leave for that reason.  I know my predecessor left the job for that reason, even though she had received a raise. She's now in a different position that was a significant raise for her.  The other issue is benefits, including leave time and flex time.  Hourly staff are expected to be in at a certain time and leave at a certain time.  It's all honor system because we still use paper time sheets, so it's abused a lot.  It takes special circumstances for hourly staff to get flex time arrangements, usually family related.    I came from the private sector, so working in academia where performance reviews are done annually, it's tough to get rid of bad performers, etc.  My boss has to go beg for more student money annually because her and my coworker can't manage the student budget fund.  Part of the problem is her insistence on paying the library school students more, even though with a few exceptions, they are worse workers than the undergrad students.  One supervisor spent most of her time on Facebook and watching videos online.  It's tough to get them to do shelving when they would rather be online or doing homework."

I think it depends on the individual library as to whether a specific task/job is one that is filled by a library tech/assistant or a librarian.   I work in an academic library where librarians do not work on any desk, nor provide reference help to the average student. We do it. Librarians fill more administrative roles and work directly with faculty. In very similar institutions, I know of librarians who have been hired to sit on a general reference desk all day. It's interesting to see the differences."

I'm also a government employee so while I am not very well-paid considering I have two master's degrees, I make a very decent salary.

I remember thinking that my first school where I taught was in the dark ages and quite deficient against the standards.  It was my first gig in the professional world.  Guess what?  All institutions are flawed, some more deeply than others.  Instead of trying to fix the system (hell, you're new still and you need to develop trust among staff before trying to influence change), try being okay with yourself where you are.  I was at a job that loathed, but I forced myself to stay a full year.  It was great experience for me. I developed strategies for dealing with nutty coworkers, and I felt more in control of my life.  Is my current institution perfect? By no means, but over time, I have found my place and am growing into a place where my voice can be heard.

Sometimes you just take the job you can get in order to pay rent, and then try to move on to something that is a better fit later. I would be concerned if you had several positions on your resume that were under two years (and weren't term positions, contracts or service type jobs).

On the other hand, Dewey, LCC, etc., are classification schemes, which deal with arranging information and resources in a logical way (usually by subject or author). The two types of systems don't compete. Quite the contrary, they complement each other. The classification scheme uses the metadata in the catalog record to create a call number, which tells library staff and users how to find the book or movie or video game or whatever that they're looking for.  To be honest, though, most of the general public doesn't much care about that. I think I'll be sharing this with some of my friends, so they can better understand what I studied in library school."

If you're not using a patron-driven acquisition model, then I would guess you don't need to purchase anything patrons request.  But if you are using a patron-driven model, you could easily add some language or requirements to patron requests to give yourself some policy coverage.  For example, my library uses a patron driven model and for R-rated DVD requests, we require that the movie be award winning AND based on a work of literature.  This allows us to point to policy when we get requests for every single movie just released on DVD.  (I don't necessarily agree with the policy, but as we have a fairly high ""lost"" count for DVDs, it does lessen the impact on our budget)."

We've heard from quite a few customers that SignUp isn't where it should be and we completely agree. Right now the calendar is painfully slow and we're addressing that as we speak...well as I type this ;)  And with input from our new user testing group, we're redesigning the calendar so that it's WAY more functional than it is right now.   (If you're interested in joining the user testing group, so that you can give us direct input on how it should work, just let me know :)   Here's what we're trying to say... we understand that we have a lot of work to do to make SignUp an amazing product, but please don't give up on us just yet.

While I understand where you're coming from I can't make a recommendation to purchase something based on what it might be or even what it will be. I have to go with what it is now, and right now, SignUp isn't very good. It's slow, painfully so. The UI isn't very intuitive and it's not mobile friendly. While I'm sure those things could be fixed or adjusted, they're not working right now. We had a demo account for a while and those who tried it felt that it was a slightly prettier interface for Events and that was about it.  Beyond SignUp, we're also using D!BS and, while I understand D!BS has some limitations, the customer support interactions I've had recently with my last two questions haven't been on par with what I used to get from Evanced. Maybe those two incidents were flukes, it happens, but neither I nor my coworkers were happy with how the questions were handled.  In the end, I'm not here to air grievances. I know what's available from Evanced and I think the company could have some stellar products in the future. My problem is that I need something that's good sooner rather than later.

I can sit here and list all of the things we PLAN to do with our products but if you can't use them right now, it doesn't really mean much...  So, as we start pushing these improvements to the software, we're hoping to get another chance to make things right and become that company with stellar products ;)   By the way, if you're going to ALA, we'll be at booth #3201 if want to stop by and chat with us.

Libraries,3ae6k0,librarian45,-2,Fri Jun 19 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"The reason library e-books cost more is because they are worth more. The licensing behind library e-books allows libraries to lend those e-books to a large number of people in a super convenient way (DRM annoyances not withstanding). A printed book that costs $20 can only be checked out by one person at a time, who must physically drive to the library and grab it off the shelf and read it. Even if an e-book is limited to one digital check out at a time, I can still check it out from home from the convenience of my couch.  Now is a 5x cost multiplier excessive given this additional value? That's a good question, but I still think the library director is being disingenuous.   I'm also unmoved by the plight of library patrons who wait up to six months for an e-book (or any book for that matter) to be available simply because they are too cheap to spend $10-20 on a newly released popular book. If you really really want that book right now just buy the damn thing. Otherwise if you're strapped for cash, used books are usually sold for pennies, or the library is filled with thousands of amazing books that are available on the shelf right now. Libraries shouldn't be expending millions of dollars of public money to fulfill the urges of patrons who only want to read new popular titles. I think the value of libraries is much greater as the repository of countless books that would be unrealistic for a private citizen to own in their own home, not as a way to enable book and DVD penny-pinchers."

But we're also caught between a rock and a hard place. There are loads of resources that we need that only come in e-formats. Publishers also argue (not entirely without reason) that print books do 'expire' after a certain number of reads (i.e. wear and tear) and that since ebooks won't naturally decay, that they should have a right to limit the number of lends. Now, is the model upon which they do this fair? No. Those numbers should be a much higher number of loans OR they need to greatly expand the length of time a book needs to be open before it triggers a loan. In an ideal world we'd be able to buy every ebook we purchase as a perpetual title (and frankly, most of what we buy is just that ... even if it's more expensive, that's what we do ... the problem is, not every ebook title has that option). It's not as easy as ""no, we won't do that"".   I totally hear what you're saying, but there's more to it."

As the book ages, it's more easily damaged. I dunno. My experience is with an elementary school library where the majority of its books are from the 1980s and, despite numerous lendings by careless kids, are still in good shape. I'd push for a time limit on ebooks, not a lending limit.  I guess I'm just more hardline than you, at least in terms of regular everyday fiction/nonfiction books for a public library.

What I'm thinking is along the lines of, they need to login into Google Drive to retrieve a document that they then need to email to you. They then need to post about it on social media. Once they do, you respond with a query (roleplaying as a patron) about a certain government form you need, which they then need to save to a different 'cloud' (i.e. OneDrive) and then email to you, and also provide you with am ebook title on a related topic and suggest an app on which you could read it. ... or something. This would be a crap-ton of work, multiple 'fake' accounts would need to be created, and maybe wouldn't be useful, but a lot of overcoming luddite behaviour is getting comfortable with the tech. In my (admittedly limited) experience, staff will aimlessly 'play' with tech to try it out without actually learning anything.

The middle school loaned the library a copy of some of their textbooks each year, so the students could come to the library after school each day, borrow the book & do homework, and then not have to lug their heavy books back and forth from school all the time. It's a great idea."
Libraries,3ad6na,vampirelibrarian,2,Sat Jun 20 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"We do something similar in the academic library I work at. We try to keep at least one of the required course books for all courses on reserve, so students can check it out for 2 hours at a time to get the relevant information. I'm not sure how popular it is, but if I was a student I'd certainly try to take advantage."

I actually had a patron pull a book off a shelf, hold it up to my face, and ask me if something in particular was in it.    I worked at a library with a lot of budget issues, and it was really tough to get people to stop leaving us garbage donations that were more of a burden than anything.  No, we we don't need the 30 year old encyclopedias that you cleaned out of grandma's attic."

Not only was she a librarian at the public branch, she also devoted much of her time at the College Of Charleston's academic library as well; you could tell she really cared about community outreach.  While I wasn't hired for the position I applied to in CCPL, she was one of the interviewers in the room--I could immediately percieve a sense of warmth about her, which made the entire interview process (my first, in the library field) so much easier on my nerves. I immediately felt more comfortable, almost at home, just by being near her.  It's been a month since I graduated from the College and moved out of the city, but it's only now that's I'm really starting to feel the separation.

Working in Children's is tough and not for everybody. Is she close to retiring and just looking to ride out her time doing as little as possible? Are you unionized or civil service? If she is refusing to fulfill her job requirements up to standard, perhaps it is time for a formal performance review and warning. What does the top administrations say?"
Libraries,3ac6de,mrorke,3,Thu Jun 18 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"Unionized. I have done a lot of gentle stuff. I marked her down in a performance review for leaving the desk unattended during busy periods (the only think I dowgraded her on since I knew she was looking to transfer and I wanted her application to be well received). Well this very well documented issue in her work was cause for her to grieve me with the union for unfair performance evaluations.   It makes me crazy for the same reason as you. I actually adjunct teach at a library school and there are a total of three library schools in the city I live and work in and we cannot get new talent hired.   You are not wrong, really you are not wrong.  As for admin, they are utterly terrified of the union. I have a staff member who has been calling out sick every day with a wide variety of rapidly changing ailments for FOUR MONTHS (he has shown up for work a total of five days in four months) and I cannot get him fired so we can hire someone who will at least show up to work. (yes he burned through all sick leave and vacation months ago, I am not shorting him anything he has a right to)  (no I am not attacking him due to medical condition, I have tried to get him on FMLA numerous times and have told him we will work around health conditions but he calls with a different illness every day and goes to five or six different doctors offices to get medical notes which are always for wildly differing reasons)."

Libraries,3ac6de,bluesimplicity,7,Fri Jun 19 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe just check in on her and have a ""how are you doing/how are things going?"" chat.  It could be that she doesn't like her job, as you suggested, or it could also be that she's feeling incredibly burned out or stuck in her career, or that she's dealing with some sort of problem outside of work that's leeching all of her energy away.  You could also use an informal chat to make your expectations clear.  Maybe canned storytimes and pre-made crafts are how she's always done things.  Maybe she has a very different idea of what she should be doing than you do.  Consider how you might get her excited and inspired to try new things.  Maybe send her to a conference or let her attend children's programs at neighboring libraries to get ideas."
Libraries,3ac6de,vampirelibrarian,6,Thu Jun 18 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"thanks these are good suggestions, which I have unfortunately already tried (which is not to say I shouldn't try again).  she has requested a transfer to another library as an adult librarian (which makes me feel like the kids thing is something she is just done with) but will only go to one fairly low foot traffic location   she is not involved in the professional organizations so conferences are not really an option  I have had the chat and she has told me that the problem is the kids and that 6th graders should not be allowed in the kids section  you are right about the ""this is how she has always done things"" thing and she does predate me at this branch  these are good suggestions and I will use them as the impetus to get back in there and try again. It is just really exhausting when the kids are out of school and suddenly I am the only one on the floor or, like today, she has a class visit of sixty kids(!) and tells me right as they show up that she is not feeling up to it today and can I take the class."

Admin and the union had a wicked fight about a year ago and the union won, handedly, and now people are just very nervous all around.   You are not wrong about the new position thing, although I have applied for a couple of jobs in the last six months and I find the entire process stressful as hell and I am not sure that I want to get into it right now. Kind of want to take a few months off, even though I am haunted by the need to get a yard for my family."
Libraries,3ac6de,glaval,4,Fri Jun 19 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"Why can't you just tell her to do these things? You're the boss. Storytime is like the bare minimum for a children's librarian and as the boss, telling your children's librarian to do weekly in-person storytimes is not at all a crazy request, which I'm sure would be supported by your higher ups if it came to that. What is her excuse? What does she say when you tell her to do it? Same goes for not working at the desk during her desk hour. What can her excuse possibly be?  Craft kits, on the other hand, don't sound crazy. Doing crafts is not a prerequisite for being a librarian. I don't know the first thing about crafts either and would probably also turn to some sort of packaged deal if I needed to do crafts."
Libraries,3ac6de,Blugentoo2therevenge,2,Fri Jun 19 04:54:47 2015 UTC,"We have done a bit of this and it has not really gotten me results but it has gotten me big resentment from my other staff who are friends with her and normally do quite good work for me.  You are right there, I am trying to do it as a cajoling kind of thing rather than dropping the hammer.  Spot on with crafts, I suck at them myself and do science experiments in lieu of them because, again, I suck at them. I just kinda want to see more than the bare minimum effort."

Be cautious of what your MOUs state, but you might be able to cross-train other staff to take over story time and children's desk time. Present it as a branch-wide effort. Ask everyone what departments they would like to know more about. If your children's librarian wants to work adult reference, give her some of your hours on desk. Then you could take over children's for a few hours, during which you could cross-train someone else, emphasizing your ideas about children's librarianship."

Just smiling and talking to some patrons makes them visibly relax, tear up, or stand a little straighter. That knitters are thieves. They steal magazines and cut patterns out of books. No other section of our library suffers like the knitting section. How real the digital divide still is. We have many patrons who depend on us for computer and internet usage, for all sorts of reasons. Anyone who says that libraries aren't relevant in the digital age hasn't considered what we mean to people who don't have the means (or in some cases, desire) to access the internet at home. That some people think we have access to just about everything, including their Yahoo password that they can't remember.

But my older coworkers tell me it used to be the anatomy books, so at least that doesn't happen anymore because people can see sexier things on the internet.  I absolutely love dealing with disadvantaged populations. It can be difficult, but I find they are the most appreciative group. I also find I learn a lot from those groups - if it wasn't for my job I don't think I would encounter many people who live in shelters or on the street, work as survival sex workers, were raised in the residential school system, etc etc. and if I did encounter them, they likely wouldn't be sharing as much of their personal stories with me.

There are a lot of people who are missing some marbles.   We have a patron who reads the same 10-20 books all day, every day, and claims the devil speaks to him. He wears a hood so you can never see his face.  Another who sits at the same table every day, gathers a stack of 20 random books, and guards them while staring at other patrons (he sits at the table until the library is about to close).  Another who unpacks an entire suitcase of action figures, enough to cover a table for 4-6 people. She will play handheld console games or sometimes PS2 on her laptop.  One regular patron has tourettes, and will randomly shout out words (sometimes obscenities). He will also stand in a corner and repeatedly hit himself with a book (he hits himself softly, and doesn't like to be bothered while he's doing this).   Another who likes to hide all the ghosthunting books under a chair, along with a lot of science magazines.  There is a regular who carries a hiking cane (8-10 ft tall pole) and wears a surgical mask. He likes perusing the science fiction section on his hands and knees.  Many of these people probably need mental assistance.

OverDrive is compensating $0.50/WMA-checkout for the past 12 months -- but only on titles that were purchased (and remained) in the WMA format since January 2011.  A vast majority of our WMA titles were published by Brilliance and the company stopped working with OverDrive at the end of 2011. By 2011 we were already focusing on purchasing mostly MP3 audiobooks. Many of the audiobooks purchased since 2011 were able to be converted to MP3.

Large print mostly comes out of Centerpoint and Thorndike.  Thorndike is bigger than Centerpoint and they also sell large print that other companies publish, so you don't miss things.  We avoid Amazon if possible because of the invoicing.  We buy most of our regular print through Baker and Taylor and go to Ingram for anything B&T doesn't have.  It's very rare that neither of them has what I'm looking for.  I don't know how much time you have for selection, but I got off our Recorded Books and Centerpoint standing orders and order everything myself.

He has written a lot on digital issues, especially in regards to copyright.  He may be a smarter choice politically having clerked for Antonin Scalia and Richard Posner, both conservative judges, as well as a former colleague of Obama's at U Chicago Law school.  I think a more realistic choice in light of the LOC's well documented administrative and technology problems would be the head of a major research university library, especially one from a public university.  They would have the experience working with donors and fundraising and working with university administration, trustees/regents, and politicians.  They also have the much needed administrative experience.  Universities have taken the lead from the LOC in digitization and how libraries adapt to changing technologies.  Hiring the head librarian from Stanford, Harvard, or Michigan wouldn't be as exciting of a hire from a news standpoint, but it would be a start in fixing the LOC.    I don't think that the appointment of a writer or public intellectual would be a good idea.  The only one I can think of that has significant administrative experience is Henry Louis Gates, but he may not be politically acceptable to some Republicans."

In library school, our preservation teacher (conservator at Duke) brought in a bunch of damaged books to show us, including her all-time favorite. It had come to her after the library staff discovered a disgustingly moldy book in the book drop.   It was beyond saving, but she hung onto it because it was so unique in terms of mold. Several different kinds of mold, in all the colors that mold comes in. She opened it to a page, double bagged it in a few ziploc bags. Every once in a while she'd open it on a vacuum table and turn the page, just to keep it from falling apart at the binding.   So one day she's turning the page and BAM, she finds the cause of the mold. There on the page, was mold in the perfect shape of a banana. Someone had shut a banana in a book, and let it get really moldy before returning it.   IIRC, once she discovered this, she vacuum-sealed the book so it was open on the banana page.  Another one of her favorites was the time raw bacon was used as a bookmark."

And your director put you there.  This sounds like a huge project even for someone with professional training.  Do you have a budget for archival supplies?  Do you have a place to put this stuff aside from the random closets?  Step one should be to get rid of all the useless stuff.  Then you can worry about what's important.  Are the newspapers issues of the town local paper?  Or are they of the New York Times?  You don't need to save the latter.  What kind of personal financial documents and school records do you have?  That sounds like stuff that should not be publicly accessible or even retained.  Be ruthless.

The financial documents are things like school and city expenditure ledgers, city pocketbooks; school records include teachers' class rosters, grade reports, curricula plans, etc. I've just begun digging through all of this stuff, so there could be much more in the way of variety."

I ask because to do the job some justice, you will need at least some specialty supplies like acid-free boxes and folders.  The actual archivists will know more, I just did an internship processing material for an archive (and that convinced me not to become an archivist).  Your director possibly isn't sure what he or she is even asking of you, so it's important that you come up with a solid plan to manage expectations.  Treat this as a research project about making an archive, you will learn a lot.  And you don't need the metropolitan area paper, another library will already have that on microfilm almost certainly (unless you are in the city)."

Make sure that it includes a requirement that others that will be helping you; you CANNOT do this by yourself. Make sure the director knows that this is a serious and time-consuming project. A lot of people think you can just BAM! make an archive. It's easy, right?  Find out what you have and get rid of the garbage. What is garbage? Nationally published newspapers or magazines (they have their own archives) and anything that I could get somewhere else by contacting a company or using the Internet. This is the history of  the city and that means unique documents I couldn't get anywhere else. Also. remember, if you are making the archive that means supplies which are expensive. The less you have to spend on supplies the better.   Don't look at everything at once. You will just wind up feeling overwhelmed. Instead, say to yourself ""I'm going to work in X first. A-M can wait until I'm done with X."" Measure your success in small amounts :)  Document. Document. DOCUMENT!  At first, don't worry about finding aids, especially detailed ones. Just worry about getting everything sorted in to logical groups and knowing what is in those groups. IE: Put all the school records together and record the gist of what is in them. Do this with every type of thing before worrying about finding aids.   Have a collection policy and a donation form that spells out the terms of the donation. You'd be surprised how many people THINK something should be in the archive when the reality is their stuff is just junk. Then they get mad when you pitch it.   That's all the advice I have.

Plenty of librarians have also worked in bookstores  (I did).   Librarianship is so diverse, it's hard to say ""do this thing"", because different areas of librarianship will benefit from different experiences. Want to go into computer stuff? Find a job working with computers. Want a front-end position like reference, instruction, programming? Look up what those jobs do, and try to get analogous experiences.    What do you wish you would have know before pursuing a career as a librarian?   Tracking. Basically your first job is going to define you in the eyes of a LOT of people. So if you start in technical services, but then decide you want to do reference, you are going to have a bitch of a time switching. Same goes for library types. Moving from one type of library to another is hard.   Breaking out of the track is done, but it is not easy.   The job market also sucks. You have to be willing to move.

There is a good chance you'll also be cobbling together a FT job with part-time positions (no benefits, working 7 days a week..that kind of stuff).   Why did you want to work in a library?   Honestly? I went into it for the wrong reasons. My intention in school was to be a lawyer. That didn't work out and I needed a backup plan like..last month. Someone else in my class was going to library school, and I thought ""I like to read, I could be a librarian"".   Now, if someone says to me ""I want to be a librarian because I like to read"", I search for the nearest rolled-up newspaper. Fortunately for me, this all worked out. I pretty quickly figured out that I would have HATED being a lawyer (and I work with them daily now...I would've hated it), and I liked librarianship. But I imagine that for every person like me, there are at least 3 for whom it did not work out.   Last thing I would impart:   DO NOT pay out-of-state or private tuition for library school unless you are given scholarships, grants, etc to bring the cost down equal to in-state tuition. Name recognition does help a bit with things, but is it a $50K+ (plus undergrad loans) difference? No."
Libraries,39vhi7,jemlibrarian,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:46:46 2015 UTC,"What do you wish you would have know before pursuing a career as a librarian?   Tracking. Basically your first job is going to define you in the eyes of a LOT of people. So if you start in technical services, but then decide you want to do reference, you are going to have a bitch of a time switching. Same goes for library types. Moving from one type of library to another is hard.   Breaking out of the track is done, but it is not easy.      That has been my problem. I got my MSLIS in May 2012 with a concentration in school library media. I got hired in August 2012 and moved from NY to NH for the job. It lasted a year, and ever since I've been unable to get hired for anything. Not schools, not public. Nothing.     The job market also sucks. You have to be willing to move. I've seen people not willing to move, and then bitch because they haven't found a position (in their major metro area) despite searching for 5 years. There is a good chance you'll also be cobbling together a FT job with part-time positions (no benefits, working 7 days a week..that kind of stuff).     I couldn't even get PT library work. Best I got was PT retail, and I had to hide the fact I had gone to grad school."
Libraries,39vhi7,RebeccaNobody,2,Mon Jun 15 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"A good strategy to avoid ""tracking"" issues if you're unsure of what you want to do is to try to have your first position be in a very small public library. You'll get/have to do a bit of everything. Stay for a year and then apply to a more specific job closer to what you'd like to do."

Libraries,39vhi7,jemlibrarian,2,Mon Jun 15 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's not perfect, but I have seen people go from public to academic and other types of libraries with this strategy. If you interview well and explain your proposed switch effectively, it can be a decent strategy.  It's not a solution for everyone, but if you're not sure what area of librarianship you want to go in, starting in a small library allows you to try a lot of different things."
Libraries,39vhi7,ergonaut,-1,Mon Jun 15 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Working in a small public library will be looked at negatively by (some) large public libraries and academic libraries. While you may get some experience in lots of areas, you won't actually be cataloging in a way that large libraries expect: managing a team of paraprofessionals, customizing an ILS, integrating with APIs, etc. And reference will be helping people sign up for Internet computers, not managing a virtual reference service and developing deep subject expertise. It can be great fun working in a small public library, but doesn't guarantee providing experience to move to a larger library.  If you work hard and find the time to develop some specialization, you may be able to leverage into work at a larger library. But a small public library may be a black mark you'll need to overcome. Depends on the biases of the librarians you'll be interviewing with."
Libraries,39vhi7,danthelibrarian,4,Mon Jun 15 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"We have totally different experiences. Looking at your profile, I think it might be because you're on the west coast, where libraries tend to be county-based, I believe.  I'm in New England. We're mostly municipality-based, with large regional networks. In my network, there are libraries serving populations of less than 5000 and libraries serving populations of over 150,000. Librarians move from small to large libraries and from large to small libraries frequently and without prejudice. It's true that doing technical services work at a small public library probably wouldn't qualify someone to run the technical services department at a large public library, but that's not really a reasonable expectation. And it's not what I was suggesting in my comment.   Our network handles the ILS and related APIs. They also handle original cataloging, which is rare whether you're at a large library or a small library.   In my experience, it's rare for even large libraries to have reference subject specialists these days. It's true that a lot of ""reference"" work in small libraries involves helping patrons with technology, but that's also true in large libraries."
Libraries,39vhi7,ergonaut,6,Mon Jun 15 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"can't think of anything I'd like more than spend my time helping people find good books and working in a library with all its neat activities   Librarians (at least where I am in an urban Public Library) spend very little time doing that kind of stuff.  It's more like you're a mid level manager in an office.  You'd be more like, planning stuff and managing people than actually doing the fun things directly.  Which is cool too, but different.  BUT BUT BUT the up side is that the employees who actually execute the fun things and work the front lines are generally just college grads.  This is (probably) true in your area as well: You'll see Miami Public is currently hiring ""Library Assistants"" in Reference and Public Services (http://www.floridalibraryjobs.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=job.search&action=search&IsProfessional=0) -- those jobs just require a HS degree.  Though in my experience, most everyone who makes it to the interview stage has an undergraduate degree (or like you, is about to have one).  My suggestion would be to throw a hat in for one of those positions.  If you're friendly, positive, outgoing and awesome you probably have a pretty good shot at it.  A number of our library assistants have decided that this is seriously what they want to do and then go to library school (that makes them totally hire-worthy as librarians because they have experience AND the piece of paper).  Others say meh and move into other fields.  HTH!"
Libraries,39vhi7,rmosquito,-4,Mon Jun 15 06:01:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the insights. I think it will be beneficial to work at a library first hand too and that seems to be the general response im getting. So, I applied for all three positions, let's see what happens."
Libraries,39vhi7,vampirelibrarian,2,Mon Jun 15 12:28:23 2015 UTC,"As far as what /u/rmosquito says about division of duties, I want to say that it depends greatly on the library you're hired at. I'm a librarian at a small branch in a county system and I spend a lot of time on the front desk (too much time I'd say, single-service desk, but that's a different issue...) so I would say that I do spend a lot of time helping people find books in the catalog, use the computers, etc. The other huge part of my job programming, which I haven't gotten too much into yet (still new) but it will be a lot of work like surveying the community to see what they want and then trying to come up with engaging speakers to invite, workshops, projects, etc.  At my library at least, I'd say that the library assistants do virtually the same work as librarians, except the librarians are technically the ones in charge and making the larger decisions about the collection, etc. Where I work, library assistants also do reference, programming, volunteer management, committee work, etc, the same as librarians."
Libraries,39vhi7,_cuppycakes_,0,Mon Jun 15 18:43:28 2015 UTC,I hope that I get the assistant job.  I think it would go a long way in helping decide in what direction I want to go with the degree. I also need to figure out where to get the assistantships and help to pay for school.
Libraries,39vhi7,techsupportlibrarian,4,Mon Jun 15 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"the first thing that should be pointed out is that while librarians still ""help people find books"", it isn't solely the main focus for the profession anymore, which most people not in the library world don't realize.  as with most things, technology has really changed the profession so it isn't all about books, but rather access to information and serving the needs of communities.    I'm currently a MLIS student (3 years in) with only my final cumulative project left to complete before receiving my degree.  Like you, I love books, which was one of the biggest reasons why I want to be a librarian.  That being said I had already been working in a public library for about 5 years, so I was coming in with an understanding about the library world.  I'm personally interested in youth and public librarianship, so I tailored my classes in library school to gain knowledge and skills related to these areas (have taken courses about children's lit, collection management, reference, etc.).  I think most programs out there that offer MLIS degrees offer similar customization, so it's really important to know what area you want to get into so you can make the best use of your time (and money).    If you've never worked in a library before (a surprising number of my library school classmates haven't), I highly suggest volunteering first because I think the profession is romanticized a ton and a lot of the not so fun aspects (working with people, limited funding, material challenges, bureaucracy...) cannot fully be understood without actually experiencing them, even just to a small degree.  Additionally, the job market isn't the best and trying to get your foot in the door without any previous experience in the area I (used to) live in would be so hard/impossible, because you are often competing with people with both the degree and experience."
Libraries,39vhi7,jemlibrarian,4,Mon Jun 15 04:00:36 2015 UTC,My mind is also blown by the amount of people in my classes that don't have any experience in a library... I hope none of them are paying for school on their own/getting loans.
Libraries,39vhi7,_cuppycakes_,5,Mon Jun 15 06:02:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a whit of library experience before library school, and even then my experience wasn't traditional. Had a job before I graduated. Of course, this was before the housing bubble burst."
Libraries,39vhi7,vampirelibrarian,3,Mon Jun 15 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends where you are looking for a job and in what area of the profession.  I'm originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, and even my job at the bottom of the ladder of a smaller urban public library in a college town (basically P/T shelver) was ridiculously competitive.  I've worked with lots of subs for librarians who had been looking for jobs for years, with degrees and tons of experience as librarians.  While I emphasize the importance of library experience, it isn't just about looking more desirable to employers, but also to point out that getting a feel for what actually goes on in libraries and what the profession actually entails.  That isn't to say passion and good networking can't get you far, I just think a lot of people come to library school thinking ""I want to get this degree to help people find books and read books all day"", while that is usually just a small part of the job (if at all)."
Libraries,39vhi7,RebeccaNobody,2,Mon Jun 15 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I went to school in the midwest and a lot of my cohort was directly out of undergrad, no library experience, excellent full time jobs right after graduation. I moved around a bit and ended up in the SF Bay Area and it is a completely different world out here when it comes to looking for library jobs."
Libraries,39vhi7,techsupportlibrarian,2,Mon Jun 15 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any experience in libraries when I was in grad school. I was working full time for a records management company.

I had been volunteering with the local library, but now I'm totally broke and have to move in with my parents in their seniors condo."
Libraries,39vhi7,heybookworm,4,Mon Jun 15 13:59:54 2015 UTC,"For major, get something tech related or web 2.0-y, something that is useful. I can't think of anything right now (super sick). You need a masters to be a real librarian, so that means you have to get into an ALA accredited college for it. You should volunteer or find a job in a library first, because working in a library is not what you initially think it is. Sure, we help people find books, but you do way more than that.  We are like charity workers (sometimes/usually reluctantly), social workers, teachers, researchers, and we help bridge the gap between people and information. Being a librarian, a public facing one anyway, is completely a service job. You will experience the same kind of shit you see at retailers, but sometimes more entitled depending on the area the library is in. People totally confused why the newest blockbuster dvd has 100+ people on hold and they wanna yell at you because it is clearly your fault somehow.   I wanted to work in a library, because I really like working with teens. I am basically a teen librarian right now. While it can be a sweet job, I would say it is actually 75% stress free depending on how often you have to work the public desk, it is pretty rewarding and challenging.   Getting a job in a library though? You really need to get experience first, then once you know you want to work in a library, you can focus on a degree. There are some positions that don't require more than a HS diploma, but those jobs usually pay shit. Being a librarian officially pays more, but depending on where you live (like where I live for instance) it blows and I really don't make enough compared to the training I had to go through.  I am still in library school, and its not that hard. Just very time consuming. I would honestly recommend you volunteer at your local library first and see how you feel about it. Or try to get a job as a page/circ/etc. Beware, advancement is usually hard in this field too."
Libraries,39vhi7,heybookworm,3,Mon Jun 15 06:01:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone else that it would be best if you can work in a library for a little while and make sure it's something that REALLY appeals to you. It's a great career path, but certainly not worth its troubles for someone who isn't passionate about it.  If it IS the path you choose to pursue, a few thoughts: -Find an in-state Master's program (as others have said) or one that will give you scholarships/assistantships. Try to minimize debt, because the job market can be tricky. My program was in-state, and while I applied late and missed out on scholarships the first year, I got involved in the program and was able to get an assistantship for the second year that paid my tuition and a small monthly stipend. So look for those opportunities!  -When you get the Master's degree and start looking for jobs, be super flexible about location if you can. If you're less than flexible about moving, think about that when choosing a field of librarianship. Certain job fields within librarianship can be MORE difficult than others in terms of finding employment, so try to research that, especially in your area. Example: In my area, despite there being a number of colleges/universities nearby, it is VERY hard to find an academic library job. Public library jobs are a little easier, but still few and far between. School library jobs, however, are easier to find in my area right now--I know of several school districts with multiple openings in my area.  -If you decide to get your MLIS, make the most of that time. If you can continue working in a library, that will be super valuable to you in your classes and for job prospects after finishing school. Be involved in student organizations, know your professors and interact with them, and look for opportunities to network with current librarians at every turn (professional organizations at the state and national level, social networking/Twitter, Facebook, listservs/etc.). This will help TONS in the long run!  Best of luck to you! If you decide to look into school librarianship one day, that's what I do, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have :)"
Libraries,39vhi7,tjb122982,-1,Mon Jun 15 14:30:27 2015 UTC,Is there a large difference in school librarianship and general? I'm not super informed about the differences.

It's done a lot to carry over the best aspect of the last few editions while trimming off the fat and providing an engaging play experience.  You absolutely need to make sure that every book you get is for the same edition.  They are not cross-compatible.  Each recent edition has a different 'Dungeons and Dragons' logo, so this shouldn't be too much of a problem.  For absolute minimum support you should offer the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual.  You may also consider collecting the published adventure paths (Horde of the Dragon Queen, Rise of Tiamat, Princes of the Apocalypse), though they're not necessary to play.  The only other accessory I might recommend circulating is a Dungeon Master's Screen.  How do you anticipate the material being used by your patrons?  Do you have any plans to put on DnD-based library programming?"

Before the big Satanic Scare of the mid 1980s some schools were using DnD to help kids learn basic math, problem solving skills, and team work.  There was actually just an article with a super basic adventure for smaller children, Champions of the Elements.  As for dice. . . in my experience, circulating items that have multiple parts are hard to deal with.  Very easy for something to go missing.  But, dice are fairly inexpensive, so you could order a pound of dice, separate them out into sets, and just replace individual dice as they go missing.  Pathfinder Pawns might be a good alternative to miniatures.  Though, again, possibly problematic to circulate.  If you absolutely must have miniatures, I would go with Reapers Bones series over the official DnD minis.  They're unpainted, but ultimately less expensive, and it's easier to decide what you're getting. . . and a miniature painting workshop might be another community event you could work out of it."

Do you think trying to hold another tournament, like the one you mentioned in another comment, at a better time for teens would be a good way to assess interest? What if you bought a few games and held a monthly/weekly tournament or after school gaming session in place of buying a large circulating collection?  The old library I worked at had a policy where basically they bought whatever books patrons requested because the library is for them, afterall. I don't know if this would fly when it comes to starting up an entirely new type of collection of video games though. I recall they did some gaming days for kids on a regular basis. They did have a circulating video game collection, but it was housed in the adult area & they did charge people for late/lost items. At the time I worked there, their dvd cases were locked and were only unlocked at check out.

To answer the question though---probably money. 1) The servers may pay for their own energy when installed, but the library still has to raise the means to acquire the servers in the first place. /u/wipeout pointed out that the need is already being addressed by some companies. And since said companies are making a profit in the business, they're less likely to offer discounts to libraries for server acquisition. 2) If the libraries were to have the servers operating in house, they would have to find a place to properly store them (with temperature management & all that jazz) which costs money. 3) The library would have to to pay at least one staff member who could install, operate, train others, and maintain the system.

When we used it, we noticed it getting a little unwieldy at just over 1000 items, but we were new to the game and didn't really know much.  Your experience may be different.  We're running LUNA Imaging's system now, which is amazing in every way and a few thousand a year (like a mid-level database).    If you want to take a big step, you could look into something like OCLC's contentDM product.  If your library already subscribes to OCLC's FirstSearch or whatever they call it now, you get a starter version of it for free.

We don't have any quiet rooms (small building), so there's no escaping the noise.  If you think about, it makes sense.

No, I didn't know that. It's okay that I didn't know that.  2) The basis of your idea was frivolous. When I asked why you suggested that more gay men work(ed) in libraries than in other fields, you replied ""that was the case ... [where] I worked."" While I did find some support for the idea after doing some research, your comment was not based on that. Your comment was based on how you thought some of your coworkers were gay and on how some friends of yours thought some of their coworkers were gay too.  3) I felt that you didn't understand the comment to which you were replying. /u/HemingWayward was jokingly referring to the fact that library staffers are overwhelmingly female (84.1%). I think he was also joking about how male librarians are not included in the ""sexy librarian"" stereotype, but I'm not sure. You then replied that you thought a lot of male librarians were gay."

I wasn't reporting academic research. The discussion didn't call for it. My comment was based on the considerable number of my coworkers who I was absolutely certain were gay -- mostly because, even in the '60s & '70s, once they understood that I wasn't judging and didn't actually give a damn, they made no secret of it.   3) I felt that you didn't understand the comment to which you were replying.   Your call. I'm aware that the majority of professional librarians are female, and always have been. Only two of my supervisors over 30+ years, and the admins above them, were male. Probably 3/4 were female. I got along fine with my female bosses. In fact, I often preferred them.  Actually, your response comes across as far more judgmental than anything I originally said. You apparently think I have some problem with other people's sexual orientation. While I'm hetero myself, with three kids and seven grandkids, I also have two nieces who are gay. My best friend since we were both 16 is gay. Several of my closest colleagues at work have been gay. It's simply irrelevant to the job.

Your inclusion of ""you do know, don't you"" and ""historically"" and ""proportion"" made me think you had statistics. I like statistics and wasn't aware of this information you were sharing. I wanted to know more. It turns out that you were reporting personal and secondhand observations. Basing your implication that it is obviously and ""historically"" factual that a significant ""proportion"" of male library workers are gay on your being ""absolutely certain [that some of your coworkers] were gay"" is frivolous.

I read constantly all though my youth, and always 4-5 years ahead of my theoretical reading level. I was in the Library Club all through high school (graduated 1960). The ""occupational recommendations"" tests they put us through said I should be a librarian.  However, going into college, I actually intended to become a history professor, tweed jacket and all, and did my degree in Classical & Medieval. Then I put in a year as a TA in grad school and discovered I was terrible at teaching for various reasons. Very disappointing. But then I thought, ""Hmmm. Libraries. . . .""  Moved over to the School of Library Science and started on my MLS -- and also began work full-time in a very large urban public library system (because I was married by then and had a kid). Took me three years to finish, but I also already had three years of professional experience when they handed me my degree. I jumped two civil service pay grades the next day. (And I went back and finished that M.A. in history a couple years later, and also my Archives Management Certificate.)  I stayed with the system for 33 years, retiring just as the field was beginning to shift away from the traditional stuff to ""information,"" with many new, young staff members knowing a lot more about computers than about books.  Looking back now, I probably retired just in time. I should add that I've always been an early adopter and my first home computer was a TRS-80 Model I in 1980, so I'm not one of those Old Farts who doesn't know where the power switch is. I was even responsible for teaching Internet research skills to staff members in our system who were younger than me in the late '80s & early '90s. Still, it's always been about the books.

If something's long overdue, have the registrar withhold class registration and transcripts.  That will get your items back real fast.

People making little honest mistakes would never spend out the credit but abusers would still be punished.  Our library has an extremely lenient fines system, basically if you keep up with your renewals you only have to return a book if it has been requested. Most of the fines come from Tech and requested items coming back a little late."
Libraries,383di4,vampirelibrarian,4,Mon Jun 1 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"Our library has fines but yeah, you can collect up to $10 and still use the card (Our ILS puts a block on their card). Once it hits $10 you have to pay it down, at least a penny. It's pretty common for people to just slide $1 over the desk and ""promise to pay the rest later..."" and then just rack it up again. I don't care, as long as it's under $10. Also, our county-wide system is a bit inconsistent with waiving fines, which makes it hard for a new staff person like myself to feel comfortable handling situations. For example, if a patron complains that they didn't understand the rules about fines, some people will waive it all, some staff will ""compromise"" and waive 1/2, some will be steadfast because they believe the patron is trying to pull one over on them-- like if we have notes on their accounts about lots of past fines being waived.  Overall the goal though is to keep people using the library so we tend to waive a lot and tell them ""this is an exception..."".   The big deal with ours though is that DVDs are a whole dollar per day they're late (books only $0.25). I think that's ok though because the DVDs are incredibly popular and I know patrons would just keep them for weeks, especially considering that they love checking out their absolute highest limit each time."

Libraries,383di4,librarianzrock,2,Mon Jun 1 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"Community College librarian here: all of our students are technically remote students so daily fines are impossible because everything is returned and shipped back via USPS. The materials can be returned and not arrive at the lending library for a week so we don't have daily fines. If an item is overdue by 3 weeks, they get a letter. After 3 letters, we charge them for the item with a flat rate of $45 per item (as a replacement fee) plus a $10 late fee. If the items are returned after that, they can get the $45 back but not the $10 (which is for processing and staff time, basically).   When a student simply doesn't return a stack of books, then gets a $300 bill, we usually get the books back. Sometimes they'll try to replace books themselves which is not encouraged unless with the help/blessing of our Acquisitions Coordinator - they tend to find beat up used copies through Amazon/ebay rather than library binding or new copies we'd get. Overall, it seems to work pretty well. It's very generous but not so generous that people can really take advantage and not return materials."

We charge realistic replacement costs for lost materials, which can add up quickly, but our main goal is to get the stuff back.  A very large bill often makes lost materials magically appear.  We're actually part of a small consortium, and one of our partner libraries did actually charge fines for a lot of things, but just recently switched earlier this spring.

Where I was previously we primarily worked 9-5 and had part-time people covering evenings and weekends, but we did work the occasional evening/weekend when people were on vacation or when we had modified finals hours or if we were short on part-time staff and needed one night a week covered. I do have to say I liked the flexibility of that schedule  I do think it can be dependent on the type of institution you're at as well though. Since most academic librarians also do some sort of instruction you're often expected to work when the classes need you and have a more varying schedule. On the other hand academic librarians are often considered part of their institution's faculty and are expected to be around during the day to participate in meetings and the like."

Do the same with the public library for whatever county you live in (and if you live in a metro Atlanta county other than Fulton, check Fulton as well as your home county). ETA:  If Tech has them, you may be able to renew them enough to get through the summer.   The Jacksonville Public Library might be an option for you to check out books over the summer. A six month non-resident card will cost you $25.00. Take a look at their catalog first, to see if they have the items on your list.   Another option, though it'd mean more driving, would be to use the GILexpress option you have through Tech (I work at another state school, so I'm familiar with this system) and have them delivered to, say, Savannah State.  Tech's policies might be different, but you should be able to request books through that as long as you're registered for fall classes. There may be other institutions that are in the area that would work - you should be able pick up at any of the USG institutions.  The other option would be to look at universities in that area and see what options they have for you to use books. The University of North Florida - they have special borrower cards for $50.

For each weekly program they attend, they get one ticket for a prize drawing at the end of the summer.   Since we're a rural area we also offer a way for kids who can't make it to the library to participate with a reading log. Every 10 books = 1 ticket for the prize drawings.

Libraries,37kt5e,kiliimanjaro,4,Thu May 28 10:37:05 2015 UTC,"In the US, normally your library usage are restricted to where your residence is.  Often neighboring libraries band together and share items; my library collective is 78 libraries working together.    As someone else mentioned, normally you are able to buy into a library system.  Ours costs 30$ per year for non-resident membership. Shop and ask around.  The reason your library's Overdrive does not have too many titles is likely because the books are all darn expensive.  Usually it is about 50-80$ for one title. Depending on the publisher, x amount of people can check the title out before we have to repurchase it.  Not more than one person at a time can check out a title.  Very frustrating as budgets are so tight, but it is what people want/need!   Ask your local librarian for more information!"
Libraries,37kt5e,Bibliotheclaire,3,Thu May 28 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"From what I know of Overdrive, you have to purchase a license for each copy of each book you want. Our library has teamed up with a few dozen other libraries in order to help with the cost of licensing.   So, the short answer: yes. Ask around and see if your conglomeration of libraries can join up with another larger group and share the cost & materials."
Libraries,37kt5e,zomgdavidbowie,3,Thu May 28 11:13:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely talk to your library and tell them what you want from OverDrive. Your feedback is hugely helpful. And your use of OverDrive will help your library a lot too.  One thing to keep in mind about OverDrive is that it isn't great if you're looking for a specific title. Because its collection is relatively small, the best way to use it is to browse a collection (audio fiction, audio non-fiction, ebook fiction, ebook non-fiction) or a genre (science fiction, self-help, etc) and restrict the results to ""Available Now."" That will allow you to borrow something immediately. Looking for specific titles can be frustrating. But OverDrive has a way of improving over time as consortia realize it's worth funding."
Libraries,37kt5e,ergonaut,2,Thu May 28 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"Normally fee cards are not eligible for Overdrive access, according to our Overdrive contract at least.  Overdrive/Publishers don't want libraries selling access to their Overdrive collection, they want to be doing the selling, to other libraries.  Our contract states that only residents in our service area are eligible for Overdrive Access.  But some libraries may not actually follow their contracted terms, you might get lucky.  The Library across the river from us doesn't enforce limits, because their ILS is old and busted and cannot provide the proper AAA.  But they are migrating to something modern soon (Koha!) and will probably start restricting access."

Libraries,37c9pn,snakesarecool,13,Tue May 26 17:34:27 2015 UTC,I don't recommend a 3-D printer unless you have a plan. Do you have the space? The policies? The people on staff that can fix it when it does indeed break down? Have you budgeted for keeping it supplied with raw materials? Or will you charge full price for the people to use it?
Libraries,37c9pn,mxwp,9,Tue May 26 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"This is very true.  3D printers are not ""set it and forget it"" resources.  Although the cost of materials isn't crazy high (comparatively...).  The makerspace I volunteer with goes through maybe 1 total spool @ $20 each a month.  Although you'll want to have several colors on hand starting out.  You'll want to charge some amount of money for the consumables and to cover maintenance costs.  This usually goes by weight and isn't an insane amount.  Policies are very important.  Given that even a basic whatever can take 2+ hours to print, tension can get pretty high if you've got high demand.  3D printers also require practice to use.  I say this as I'm warming one up right now to start a print as part of my own practice.  You'll need to have someone who can really dedicate some time to learning the machine and using it with whatever computer you'll have connected to it.    That said, they are an easy way to get rid of a lot of money at once :-)  I always recommend connecting with a local hack/makerspace to check out some hardware and pull in as potential trainers.

Pretty cool stuff, and I felt like I learned quite a bit.  Library of Congress finished the switch-over to RDA 3 months later.

In my new school, I'll actually be one of TWO full-time, certified librarians.  There is a guideline for placement of certified librarians in schools based on student population here in TN (see here.)

I recognize that things are definitely different in other places, but I do feel like it's important to mention that positive experiences are out there, too! Best of luck to you in your job search!"

Libraries,36tn2u,sadie11,14,Fri May 22 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on what area you work in.  Circulation is relatively demanding - books are heavy! Carts of books, checking in books, hundreds a day, shelving and moving them all about.   Librarian position itself may vary. Cataloging, reference desk, some things may have lots of nice, long sitting periods. Programs may require more physical activity depending. I helped a coworker with her program and I was moving and on my feet for hours (so many sore muscles the next day), then other programs could just teaching computer classes so it's only standing for an hour at a time."
Libraries,36tn2u,Alushia,6,Fri May 22 01:03:14 2015 UTC,"Hard to expound on this post but I'm feeling up to the challenge.  Basically two different areas in a library: back of house desk jockey & everything else (public service).  The back of house folks may include administration, tech services, finance, etc. Just depends on the organizational structure. Most of the people in this area are not going to see much physical labor. Some more than others of course. For instance, some people in tech services will be working with books and other materials directly. They'll be lifting individual books, rearranging shelves in back, taking care of shipments, carts, whatever. They'll be moving things, but nothing extraordinary. Probably rarely over 30 pounds.  Other people in tech services (catalogers, collection development) will probably not often lift more than a book or two at a time under ordinary circumstances. Administration will lift a pen, maybe a ream of paper if they're feeling frisky.   On the public service side is where a lot of the heavy lifting will occur. Here at the bottom you'll have the pages doing the shelving. Aside from moving around carts and checking items in, how much they lift depends on their ambition. If they don't want to tax themselves, they may slowly move the cart down the aisle as they go and only lift one book at a time. Slow but not physically demanding. On the other end of this spectrum, they could put 30 books in their arm and shelve the entire stack in one row (my method back in the day). This will be a hell of a lot quicker and more taxing.   Circulation supervisors will not be doing much heavy lifting, but may have to assist in the check-in room, with shelving, or any other menial task depending on personal and library preference. People between the two will do physical demanding work somewhere between supervisors and pages.  Librarians and library assistants on the public service side will see a variety of physical demands. If someone is a reference librarian and that's all they do, then the most taxing thing they may do is get on a step stool and grab a dusty dictionary from the top shelf in storage. Or someone may be a children's librarian and engage in a number of story times throughout the week. They may be high energy and do a lot of set up. This could be physically demanding, but really depends on the person. Also, someone doing story time will have time off desk to prepare (depending on a number of variables), so not all of their working hours will be taxing.   Basically, the higher you go up the pay grade, the less physically demanding your job will be (depending on your personality).   I hope these 450 words suffice."
Libraries,36tn2u,Jayviar,3,Fri May 22 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"Basically, the higher you go up the pay grade, the less physically demanding your job   Depends on where you work.  I am at the top of the food chain at my library (Director), and some days, I carry boxes of books up and down narrow, twisty, 120 year old stairs because we don't have an elevator.  Boxes, bags, carts of books to empty the book drop are full.  Delivery bins are heavy. At 5'4"", I am the tallest person of my staff of six.  Guess who gets everything off the top shelves?  We get very heavy boxes of books from UPS.  Someone has to move/unpack those.  Cases of paper are heavy.  So are cartons of tax forms. Carts of books are heavy, almost everyone pushes carts of books.  Shelves are constantly being shifted.  We move chairs and tables for programs.  The book you need is always on the top or bottom shelf.  I think every library will answer this differently, because every physical plant, staff size and demographic, and job description vary.  Personally, I would not hire someone who cannot carry a box of books (40#), because we all have to do it."

I still do plenty of shelving, toting large boxes of books (new orders, weeded boxes, donations, book sale books, etc), I do a lot of shifting of furniture, dragging around tables and chairs to clear space or set space up for children's events.   At one point we did a massive restructuring of shelving units and desks that was about 4 days straight of very heavy lifting and dragging.  Last year I put my back out in the run up to summer reading doing stuff at the library, and ended up working through two days of severe pain because it was just before the big kickoff for a summer reading program I had spent 5 months planning for.

Libraries,36qthe,beamfollower,3,Thu May 21 11:44:40 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Open source software is somewhat of 'my thing'. Especially using Linux to save money in lots of exciting ways.  In my previous library we used a lot of open source software, especially when we could replace expensive paid for software.   Gimp and Paint.net as Photoshop Replacements.  Our older laptops ran Ubuntu LTS, and were used by the library staff as admin machines. We kept windows machines for the public, becoming Linux based when they got too old and slow.  The catch/release print server and public display boards ran Ubuntu. We also had electronic resource demo machines and a library catalogue searching machine running Ubuntu. The catalogue machine was significantly more reliable than a commercial system (running windows) so I really don't understand why it isn't more common.  Linux web-server naturally!  One of the most useful things we had was a staff laptop that ran Ubuntu and Smokeping keeping track of the wireless network access points and web resources, so you could see when something needed attention.  The most recent upgrade was where we consolidated two network connections installed in two separate buildings. We cancelled one and then connected using two DD-WRT boxes and very long aerials. this saved enough money to upgrade the main connection to asynchronous fibre, allowing HD video-conferencing and faster uploading of holiday and kitten pictures to facebook.  I wouldn't hold back from looking at open-source video/photo editing software as users probably won't be pre-trained with an industry standard application (as they are quite expensive). Unlike office where I wouldn't recommend a move to Open/Libre Office as users are usually used to it and tend to resist change. Didn't stop us using OpenOffice during a financial dry spell once, but converting documents between various formats for users got old very quick!  The major advantage was the cost savings, as we didn't have the usual support contracts for a lot of library systems, and no ongoing software upgrade charges so budgeting for our computer resources was much more predictable.  Good luck!"

Libraries,36nji5,Samanthamarcy,8,Wed May 20 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"technology often times gets swept into a big pile, and both infrastructure and public access are intermingled with not enough staff to properly support either.   This. Even with major library open source initiatives I've seen, there is a common trend of a lot of interest but limited support. Developer communities exist, in libraries and elsewhere, due to funding. Altruism isn't cheap.   Although it may be unorthodox, I think organizations ought to start funding people, not projects. Too many resources seem dispersed for one-off digitization or new initiatives that quickly melt once the money disappears. Instead, invest in building a new library/archive/museum workforce with technology savvy and community dedication. The outcomes may be gradual, but will give organizations flexibility and growth to modernize."

Libraries,36nji5,akamarkman,7,Thu May 21 01:38:08 2015 UTC,"Start with this part:   Additionally, the Library does not have a complete process for tracking its IT spending or an accurate inventory of its assets.    Stop the money bleed. This is baseline stuff. Then fix this part:   Further, the other units were often not satisfied with these services, which has contributed to them independently pursuing their own IT activities.   By hiring more IT staff to support what's actually there and centralize resources, now that you know what you have from step 1. This frees up more funding for this part:    The Library does not have the leadership needed to address these IT management weaknesses.   It seems a bit chicken and egg, because you need step 3 to get step 1, but that's how I would approach it."

I suppose I'm repeating what others have said and that people are key in keeping IT under control, as counterintuitive as that sounds to bean counters.

I wish that we did it for all of the J and YA, too, but alas we don't (yet).

Libraries,36me3z,EZE783,1 point,Thu May 21 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"We've got 4 branches in our county, so having the assigned library branch on the spine label helps circulation know where to send the book when it comes back from a patron.   Having the date on the book helps when we're weeding through a section to be able to tell at a glance when any given book was added to the system.   Too, we're part of a consortium with 5 other counties (most with multiple branches). As a result, being able to quickly tell a home branch (and county) is a plus. Furthermore, for some reason we don't loan items ILL with the rest of the consortium until the book has been in house for a given amount of time (""something something, give our patrons a chance to read it first, something something"")."

I've seen libraries that will post a tiny list of all of the books in a series and past/hang it on the shelf next to where those books are shelved. Problem with my library is that we use a floating collection & I'm at a tiny branch so we'd never really have enough of a series in one place to really justify something like that unless it's a very popular series that we're sure to have all/most of on the shelf.
Libraries,36jzkf,PossumCrepes,14,Tue May 19 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  I'm a library director (although with a government organization) and I moved up the ranks very quickly, more quickly than I had any business doing.  Here are a few observations (but I am by no means an expert):   Respect the institutional knowledge of your staff. Chances are some of them have been around a very long time and know a lot more than you do about the particular library, town, clientele, etc. However, just because something has been done a certain way for a long time doesn't mean it needs to stay that way. Ask yourself ""if we weren't already doing it this way, is this the way we would do it?""  In the same vein, if you are significantly younger than the people you will manage, don't let them try to mother you and regardless of age, don't let them treat you as anything other than the director. Remember, you are not their friend, you are their boss Play nice with the stakeholders. Get to know them well, their needs and concerns. Always make them feel like they are being heard, regardless of whether you agree with them or plan to act on their recommendations.  Never, ever wait to be asked to show your library's value or continued relevance. If you're being asked, it's too late. Be proactive in reporting accomplishments to your board and council.  Vendors are just doing business; they are not the enemy (although some of them make it really difficult to feel otherwise).  No matter what decision you make, someone isn't going to like it. You can't please everyone, and that's a hard lesson to learn.   Good luck with everything!"

Libraries,36jzkf,justasmalltowngirl89,3,Wed May 20 13:39:29 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning this journey now. 3 drawers chock full of files, all of which must be gone through...thank goodness I only work at a small library!"
Libraries,36jzkf,meabh,2,Wed May 20 23:09:22 2015 UTC,I said the same. I had 3 filing cabinets and a back office with haphazardly stacked and filled boxes.
Libraries,36jzkf,justasmalltowngirl89,2,Wed May 20 23:47:27 2015 UTC,I'm...I'm ignoring those boxes for now. shudder
Libraries,36jzkf,justasmalltowngirl89,1 point,Thu May 21 07:59:14 2015 UTC,I don't blame you. It took me about 2 months to work up the courage to deal with it. And about 3 months to finish the project.

Libraries,36jzkf,Samanthamarcy,1 point,Thu May 21 07:59:28 2015 UTC,This. I opened a file yesterday. All it contained was an original newspaper clipping and 15 copies of the same newsletter clipping.
Libraries,36jzkf,_JackBlue,2,Wed May 20 21:56:45 2015 UTC,I suspect that we might have the same predecessor! I would find five copies of a letter in 5 different files.
Libraries,36jzkf,ergonaut,4,Wed May 20 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"Exciting! Congrats!  I would say, don't forget where you started. It made a huge difference in my first library (small town NE library) when the director got on board behind the circ desk and helped us out. She also made a point to develop leadership in others, praised highly when we did well, and scolded quietly when things did not.  Great luck, I'm sure you'll be fab!"
Libraries,36jzkf,_JackBlue,1 point,Wed May 20 18:11:54 2015 UTC,I hope so. :)
Libraries,36jzkf,_JackBlue,3,Sat May 23 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"As a director you need to remember three things:   You are never wrong, you are the director. The boards is against you. They are always plotting against you. Staff are** all incompetent scum** and deserve the verbal and emotional abuse you heap on them.   Remember those three things and do not believe a damn one of them and you'll be fine.  On a serious note, I hope you know how to manage people. Your staff are your greatest asset and will make or break your business and will be the difference between you loving your job or hating it."
Libraries,36jzkf,ergonaut,2,Thu May 21 02:38:34 2015 UTC,"If you don't know how to manage people, just remain calm, give yourself time to think, be open, and be kind. You'll figure it out in time."

I watched our director, who by resume and reference is great for the job, struggle with long hours because she can't tell her bum from her quickbooks.  Also, your project management chops need to be up to...chop.  I don't know you, but I'm kind of excited for you and little jealous.  I'm not a librarian, but the idea of tackling the personnel, project management, fund raising and building programs sounds exciting as heck to me."

We will send anywhere as long as the postage isn't insane and we are the only ones in the lender string. We keep a list of where we have sent things and currently the winner is Hong Kong. We will send long distance, but we won't request for our patrons from foreign countries UNLESS they are willing to pay the postage. We do not charge our patrons and we do not charge other libraries. Because of that, we do have to consider postage costs on occasion. LONG LIVE LVIS!"
Libraries,36hxkr,fitz999,7,Tue May 19 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"We only do ILL within the U.S.  Not quite what you're asking, but I once got a request for an audiobook I had a really hard time finding.  I eventually look it up in Worldcat and the only library that owns it is a library for the blind in Tasmania."
Libraries,36hxkr,notreallyasuperhero,3,Tue May 19 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a terribly long distance, but I once got an ILL from the Library of Congress (my home library was in Green Bay, Wisconsin). That was pretty neat."
Libraries,36hxkr,_CommanderKeen_,3,Tue May 19 18:32:23 2015 UTC,"I work in ILS in an academic library. We loan and borrow things throughout the world. China, Korea, India, South Africa, Spain, UK, Norway, Germany, Canada, and Australia are all places I commonly see. The restrictions are informally based on stability in the country. In some countries parcels can be held in customs for a long time or simply disappear. If we have had negative experiences we may not be willing to lend."
Libraries,36hxkr,_CommanderKeen_,2,Tue May 19 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"Huh. That's interesting. It sounds like your policy has a clause where the library may decline to fill an ILL request (reasonable) and that, in practice, you sometimes make decisions based on a country's stability. Am I interpreting accurately?"
Libraries,36hxkr,cimbalom,5,Tue May 19 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"We're never under any obligation to fill any request so there is no 'opt-out' clause. It's simply up to our discretion. There are numerous reasons we may not, even for those libraries we have specific agreements with. These could range from fragile or oversized material, material bibliographers have decided are non-circulating, to simply having too many requests at a given time.   When it comes to international lending, we are definitely pro-lending (and pro-international library community) and will do so unless there is some reason like I've stated before. We won't say 'oh, this place is economically unstable so we won't lend'. We decide to quit lending after we experience problems. Realistically though, most countries that don't have strong infrastructure don't really approach us anyway."

Libraries,36hxkr,bigbysemotivefinger,3,Tue May 19 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"The longest distance I've personally ordered a book from is from the east coast of Canada to the west coast, Halifax to Vancouver, so 7600km or 4800mi. That's roughly the distance from New York to Moscow! It's kind of funny to think of the absurd distances involved in normal ILL transactions in Canada since our population centres are so far apart."
Libraries,36hxkr,letmegetmycardigan,3,Tue May 19 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"I work at an academic library in Montana.  We only do in-country (+ Canada and maybe Mexico) ILLs.  I've done them to all 4 corners of the US, Alaska (which really isn't that far from us actually), and Hawaii.    I actually got a request from the UK, which we normally won't fill, for an article to be mailed.  I copied it and sent it off, but we wouldn't have sent materials that we wanted back.    I guess technically we do send articles via ILLiad all over the world."

Libraries,36hxkr,knives_out,3,Tue May 19 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"We're an academic law library on the east coast, so we tend to be a little more strict on who we lend to (no public libraries, for example). But a law library or university on the west coast? Sure. Hawaii? Mmmm, probably not. We do consider copy/scan requests, from other countries, provided we are licensed to do so. Sometimes, we have to request obscure material from said libraries, so we try to return the favor."

Libraries,36hxkr,knives_out,1 point,Tue May 19 16:50:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  Why wouldn't you lend to public libraries?
Libraries,36hxkr,jemlibrarian,2,Tue May 19 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what /u/depaulbluedemon said and I think there were some negative experiences in the past. We only lend to attorneys for a short period of time, but they found a loophole in using public library ILL systems in order to keep the books longer (and sometimes not return...ironically, they were the worst offenders).  I don't make the rules, otherwise, I would totally lend."
Libraries,36hxkr,ranve119,2,Tue May 19 16:55:47 2015 UTC,I just remembered how absolutely off-limits the law library was in my undergraduate and graduate universities. I think you needed key-card access and there were always security guards posted at the entrances.   I was also told on several occasions that law school can be so competitive that students will purposely destroy/steal/hide materials from their classmates in order to gain an advantage. Eeek.
Libraries,36hxkr,library_sheep,1 point,Tue May 19 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"Ours isn't quite that restrictive, though it might be when we get our new law school building. We finally started lending general collection items to undergrads last year. Our study aids section is extremely popular: 24 hour check-out for law students only and boy-oh-boy do they abuse that. We also don't charge fines, making it difficult to really enforce any rules. When I explain all of that, I basically have to say ""Just don't be a douche. Respect your classmates.""  But yeah, competitive little buggers! I usually put a pop-up note in the accounts of those who abuse the study aids and give them a warning when they try to check out anything from that section again. Usually embarrasses them just enough when they realize someone's actually noticing."

Libraries,36idp9,MsPurkle,3,Tue May 19 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a library, but I had an interview for a position at my local science museum recently. They told me that there will be a lot of interaction with kids, which had me nervous just because I literally have zero experience working with kids. I was very honest with them and said that though I had little to no experience I was not worried at all about having the right personality for the position. I actually ended up getting the job over several other applicants. One of the things that stood out to me in the interview was them mentioning that if kids have questions to get them to actively think about the question instead of giving them an answer outright. Ask them what they think, etc. I guess keeping their sense of curiosity going. I'm not sure if that'll help you out at all, but maybe it'll be a slight confidence booster. Best of luck!"
Libraries,36idp9,semanticantics,1 point,Tue May 19 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"This is definitely helpful to me. I am so worried that my lack of experience with kids will prevent me from getting this position. Like you suggested, having the right personality and outlook will be my selling point. I hope they're willing to give me a chance, like the science museum did for you!"
Libraries,36idp9,Kellyscomments,3,Tue May 19 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"I've recently started interviewing in my new position. My top tips for presenting yourself well:   Avoid jargon and buzzwords. You might think they make you sound like you know what you're doing, but the interviewer hears the same words and phrases from pretty much everyone so it won't win you any points. Dress smart. I've seen so many candidates turn up in trainers and t-shirts. If you're a solid candidate it won't stop you getting the job, but you're likely to get scored lower if you're giving the wrong impressions. Examples. Try to give an example for each question and be as specific as possible. So: ""I sometimes read to my niece"" will score less than ""When reading to my niece, I made sure to give her chance to look at the pictures and join in on any repeated phrases"" would score far better. Don't waffle. This can be hard when nervous, but your interviewer will be listening to answers from the same questions all day and the longer you ramble, the harder it is to pick out important information. Read through the questions asked in your job application, the interview questions are likely to be variations on the theme. Also go through any person specifications or job criteria posted and try to provide an example of a time you've dealt with something similar, so you don't have to think things up on the fly.   Good luck!"
Libraries,36idp9,NetLibrarian,2,Tue May 19 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your thoughts. I especially appreciate your advice about not waffling--this can be hard to do when you're nervous! /u/NetLibrarian suggested taking a moment to think: better to have a good response as opposed to a quick one.   And I will dress well! Going shopping for nice shoes tonight! Gotta paint my nails, too! :)"
Libraries,36idp9,popraaqs,2,Tue May 19 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Working in a library means interacting with the public (duh), so it's very much a customer service job as it is an archives job (I would argue more so). It's likely you will be asked a situational question or two (""What would you do if a parent came up to you and requested you 'deal with' their irate child?"") so it's not only important to spin the answer into a positive and to emphasize what you CAN do, never what you CANNOT do, but also to provide EXAMPLES. Think of similar incidents in the past where you've defused a situation and tell them. A real world example will tell the interviewers you know how to handle tense situations."

If you look at it from the perspective of internet password security, it seems laughable. I know they use the card number/pin combo for self-check out stations and it helps to have a simple pin number for that, but can't they separate the login for the website from the self-check out login so the website can at least offer a more secure login if you want it?"

I have run wireshark on my own computer and signed on to the catalog and it doesn't even encrypt the username and password - it was right there in plaintext!

It has been beneficial -- I started two years ago with a budget of $800 for programs. After demonstrating that my program attendance has been steadily increasing, I now have a budget of $3,000 for programs.  Reporting program numbers has also help offset our declining circulation. So in April of 2015 I had 28 programs with 671 patrons attending it but youth circulation was 5,941 items. In April 2014, I had 16 programs with 354 patrons attending it and our youth circulation was 6,246. So while circulation went down, we have people coming to the library.

For the rest of it, it seems like he used a lot of words to say: ""Libraries need to be designed around the needs of their users, not the needs of their collections."" That's not really a new idea.  The ""constant innovation"" is only necessary if our users' needs are constantly changing. We've talked a lot about the need to change our model from ""buying things from publishers and lending them to citizens"" to something else, but this piece doesn't seem to say anything at all about what that something else should be.

So admins (outside the library) could not care less about the teaching/services we perform. They're still just cute little anecdotes to fill pages in our documents which feebly try to assert value.

While it's common for some of our patrons to regularly use multiple branches throughout the county, the county is still large enough (driving-wise) to attract users mainly to their local city branch on most occasions. So the patrons at smaller branches know how to put books on hold & still pick them up at the smaller branch. And we still regularly ship books to other libraries for holds. It works out well for us."

Why not pick them up at ""their"" branch? Is it a smaller city system where it's relatively easy to get to any branch they want? I work for a county system and some branches are definitely smaller than others, with smaller browsing collections. At the smaller branches, people definitely know how to place holds, but they still pick them up there because they aren't going to drive to another city to pick up their book..so the collection does make its way around the county. Is your ""popular"" branch the main branch - like it's the largest, nicest building to hang out in? I wonder what can be done to attract users to the other locations.."

Floating, in principle, is an idea that I really like, because it lets items go where the greatest demand for them is, and this is particularly important with things like foreign language collections.   If the libraries don't have great browsing collections, I think that's more a problem of having really limited funds for new books, rather than necessarily a problem with floating collections."

So you can request anything at one library and get it from a library half way across the county and return it to your home branch and it'll get sent back up the county. Only two cities i know here in westchester have more then one library and both of them operate like the WLS Network where the home library always gets their item back.

If they don't have anything with their current address, we'll offer to mail the card as proof. If we do that the patron can check out two things until their card shows up in the mail. If they do have a proof of address on the spot, they have no limits and can use it right away. A few times we've made exceptions to this rule, specifically the Ohio resident rule if they're caring for their sick parent for a few months and they have kids that want to read books.

Here is some information from the American Library Association that you might find useful:  Video Copyright  Information about screening PBS programs You'll want to look at the answer for ""I want to screen a PBS program at a public event. Can I do that?"""
Libraries,35m1c9,Truant_Muse,5,Mon May 11 17:35:00 2015 UTC,"This is true. But there may also be an agreement in place at your library which allows that facility to show movies publicly (we have one at my library). Typically those go by studio, so if you found out, say MGM was covered, you could safely show MGM movies.  That comes with caveats, though. Make sure any library license also applies to your group, and follow any rules that comes with it (eg, you would almost certainly have to show it at the library in that case, and the license we have specifically bars us from announcing titles to be shown on social media, which has always struck me as an odd clause)."

Libraries,35m1c9,Truant_Muse,1 point,Mon May 11 18:28:27 2015 UTC,they won't let you announce it on social media because it would take away from potential profits of the movie in the theatre since most of the licenses we have available too us for public performance also say you can't charge for admission.

I had to be there at 8:45 AM. Mrs. Tobey, the chief clerk, showed me what I have to do every morning at that hour.  First, I must take the books we’ve received that need to go to other branch libraries, as well as to Grand Army Plaza, and put them in boxes, take them on the “trucks” (carts), put them in the lift (a dumb waiter) and then go to the conveyer belt where the man from the Interchange truck (a real truck) is and send him the books.  He then sends me our branch’s books, and I take them upstairs and screen them for reserved or lost books, take out transaction cards from the back pockets, and then put the books back on the shelves.  Mrs. Higgins, in charge of the part-timers and my immediate supervisor, has me in charge of 000-799 in Non-Fiction; that’s a kind of mezzanine above the first floor. So I sort out books and shelve them in their proper places.  The first day went fast, and in learning the routines, I did not feel like too much of an idiot, so this job may be okay for a while.

Libraries,35ihfb,poeticlogic,3,Sun May 10 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I work in a library that deals entirely in e-text books or audio textbooks (CAPER-BC). It's a bit different because they are only for students who can't use print textbooks due to their disability.  Their advantage is that they are incredibly versatile and portable (if not hobbled by too much DRM). You can search for a term, you can have all your textbooks stored on a tablet, you can get software to read it aloud, you can magnify text if you have vision problems, etc.  Yes, the institution will do a fair amount of technical troubleshooting. I spend a lot of time helping people figure out how to download or unzip their files. Our case might be different from a library that pays a company to deliver the materials; since we create and distribute them ourselves for the most part, we have to do the tech support.  I believe there is still a case to be made for print textbooks. As far as I'm concerned there are differences in the way we remember things depending on whether we read them on a physical object and can make notes with our own hands vs. reading on a screen or listening to text read aloud by software. Also, they are far easier to use for most people and a library copy can be consulted for 10 minutes with far less hassle than trying to negotiate the rights to download something onto a device."

Vitalsource is the only distribution platform that I recommended as balancing the security needs of publishers while respecting student ownership rights. It's the closest thing to a standard.  McGraw Hill and Pearson are actively spreading confusion and mixing the idea of an LMS with etextbooks.  Take a look at Algonquin College's etextbook program. It's the best setup I've seen.

If your boss wants good digitization, the materials need to be staged in a way that makes some kind of sense and isn't a total clusterfuck when you send it to the state. In your situation, bottom line you want to be able to hand over your materials to someone who doesn't know them. The following questions spring to mind:   Is any of the material already catalogued? In the very least, an inventory?  Are the materials your boss wants to archive and digitize one collection or several? Can you provide a basic assessment of the condition of the materials which could affect preservation and digitization? I.e., a big rusty staple holding a bunch of letters together or a yearbook bound so tightly that text is obscured in the gutter.  You will want to find out what the state's digital preservation strategy is. Having someone else host may be fine in the short term, but not long term.    Sorry to hear this is being dumped on you. I hope your boss understands that preservation, both traditional and digital comes with ongoing costs and maintenance. And that you have other staff to help you organize all this prep!"

I don't know what kind of organization you're working for, but you might want to just look over this from Missouri - it's geared for smaller historical institutions, who are often running on a shoestring budget with very little clue what they're getting into. Just to get you in the right mindset.  My number one piece of advice is, don't try doing it all at once. Identify a small chunk of the whole according to set criteria - maybe it will be most immediately useful to get certain stuff done, so do that stuff first. There will be many bumps, and at least one FUBAR. But use that pilot program as a ""things not to do"" lesson as you tackle bigger chunks.

I have known people who do freelance research, freelance writing, turking/mturking, participate in market research panels (I've done this as well), and who are life coaches.  There is money to be made in the life coaching circles right now - the idea (or can we say scheme?) is that you pay money to partake in a coaching training program, and then you sell yourself as a coach for self-empowerment, careers, businesses, relationships, etc.  Basically doling out advice, development ideas, career counseling, without necessarily having a degree in psychotherapy, business, health, etc.  I'm not suited for something like this - it seems like you would burn through a ton of hours building and marketing a practice, while risking a lot."

Yeah that is interesting about the life coaching..I have noticed a big trend in that regard. I listen to podcasts and a lot of the podcasters also seem to offer ""coaching sessions"" and things like that.  I think there are a lot of people looking for someone to give them answers and solve problems for them...or take their business to ""the next level"". I'm sure some of them can make quite a bit of money.  I can see why people would want to go into this business too as startup costs would be low or practically nothing.  Sometimes I wonder if these people are so successful , why they would be coaches rather than continue with their businesses. Of course most will say because they enjoy helping people...but hard to know how often that is true."

The Obama plan to use cell phone apps is a good one, but more need to be done, and the endowment ideas in the current LibraryCity essay and elsewhere could help. Also helpful, as noted, is the LibraryCity's call for more money for librarians, at least in poorer districts. I've offered specifics on raising it.   Meanwhile--a little detail. The linked essay is about MUCH more than the Obama plan. Please reread the headline: ""Toward a real 'public' library system from the DPLA.""

Not surprisingly, I tend to get a fair number of visits when I post here; I'm fitting in with the Reddit ecosystem. Reddit is a community built around friendly sharing of relevant and factual information, and that is what I am doing from a pro-library, public-interest perspective and without any commercial motivations.   OK, I think we've exhausted all the angles here.   Bottom line: I can spend my donated time just looking for interesting library links, or I can use it instead to add value as someone who has been writing on library issues since the early 1990s.

The old argument goes that as technology increases, new jobs replace the ones that were taken over. But, as a software developer myself whose work has definitely reduced the number of jobs in the insurance industry, I highly doubt that's true. We're hitting a tipping point, and I personally feel that it is generally a good thing. Maybe not at first while the government and economy absorb the blow of legions of unemployed made so by our very efforts as humans to make technology work for us, but in the long run I foresee more freedom and creativity for humans as technology frees us from the drudgery and/or necessity of all kinds of work."

Unless the government (and society in general) starts to accept that with this kind of automation/AI we're talking about here we'll begin seeing massive shifts economically which can and will lead to instability, the future for capitalism is pretty bleak. People such as Bill Gates have been pointing this out and no one seems to be listening. Long story short: If your own technology automates huge percentages of human jobs, now you have loads of unemployed people with little to no purchasing power. So then who is buying all the stuff your automation is producing? Probably not very many people. Cue economic collapse (which may well have happened prior to this point). The ideal scenario would be to harness this technology for mass good and shift away from trying to sell things and employing people in meaningless jobs (like my insurance IT job - I'd much rather help people in libraries). There is no such thing as a utopia, but at least we could get water, food, clothes and shelter to all instead of only to some based on an artificially driven supply-demand society. Think Jacue Fresco's Venus Project, but minus all the rhetoric and conspiracies."
Libraries,34u5ud,Iswitt,6,Tue May 5 11:40:35 2015 UTC,"Right, plus our jobs have already been automated to varying degrees for so long. Librarians adapted to these changes in their job roles, rather than completely disappear."

Libraries,34u5ud,jollygoodwotwot,1 point,Tue May 5 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it weathered the changes ""just fine"" but I wonder how the decline in numbers compares to other professions that were impacted by increased automation in the last 50 years."
Libraries,34u5ud,muppetzinspace,2,Tue May 5 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, other than fields which emerged just to automate others, libraries are certainly not alone."
Libraries,34u5ud,jollygoodwotwot,10,Tue May 5 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the copypasta, but this was my response to a person in /news who tended to think the same way (they were making the assumption that all librarians are public librarians):   Not all librarians are public librarians. I've worked in several kinds of libraries, though no public, and here are some things I've done for patrons which couldn't (or shouldn't) be done by a robot:  1) Taught. Teach people information literacy (at least 4 different types of classes), how to search databases, how to operate a computer.  2) Research. The differed by the job, but something I do now involves a query along the lines of ""This is the statute for this law in 2015. I need to go back through the last 100 years, find how the wording of the law had changed, and what it means"". Yes, a computer can do the first part (assuming it's all digitized, it's not), but telling you the meaning? Notsomuch.  3) One of my projects now is a big preservation/conservation project. I'm cleaning 100yr old+ books with a mold problem. I'm repairing bindings. I'm sealing red-rot, making boxes, etc. It's cheaper for me to learn how to do it than to send it out. This is stuff so fragile that touching it makes it fall apart. Robots don't have the tactile sensitivity to know what is too rough, or what isn't rough enough.  4) Reference. When people ask a reference question they think they are asking Question A and will get Answer B. In reality, most people have no idea what they are actually seeking. I'll get asked ""I need to know about civil law"", but it's only after showing them materials and asking questions that they realize their DUI charge is not a civil matter. I can't imagine trying to have that kind of back-and-forth with Siri. (And the example I gave is a much more simple example than the stuff I typically deal with). Computers also currently do a pretty poor job of deciphering incorrect citations. (Well, this isn't a real title, but this title has the corresponding chapter/section which matches your query...and there are ZERO page numbers..not sure where you got those)  5) Serve populations who don't have access to technology. Easiest example: prisoners. Prison libraries don't have much. They aren't allowed to request whole books from libraries a lot of the time (security). They don't have access to the internet (if they're lucky, they have a closed-network access to a legal database which DOES NOT have everything). You get the request, you find materials that might be helpful (again, going back to the ""reference"" part), photocopy them, and send them to the prisoner. Prisoners also request a lot of weird stuff.  6) Soft skills. Can a robot defuse a situation with a patron better without having it escalate and the police called? Can a robot recognize the signs of domestic violence? Can a robot recognize that patron is living in their car in a wal-mart parking lot? (In those situations you only provide resources unless it's a mandated reporter situation). Can a robot tactfully explain why it is not appropriate to wear a neon bra and body stocking to a job interview?  TL;DR: There may be a lot of functions that could be automated, but not all of them. And the tech isn't there yet for some that could be."
Libraries,34u5ud,myeyestoserve,5,Mon May 4 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why public librarians are always the one who get shit on when it comes to ""librarians will be replaced by robots and/or are already obsolete,"" but I too do 1, 4, 5, and 6, and as a children's librarian, I spend most of my time planning programs for kids, parents, and caregivers that I'm pretty sure are beyond the skills of most robots."
Libraries,34u5ud,Iswitt,3,Mon May 4 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"Because most people think that all librarians are public librarians?  My point with that sentence was that I do things that either most public librarians do not do, or do not do to the same extent that I currently do (I'm a dedicated law librarian right now, but have been in special collections and health. Just like how many public librarians can't do a legislative history, I couldn't do a reader's advisory to save my life).   Like I said above, I've never been a public librarian (no plans on it either), so I don't know everything you do."
Libraries,34u5ud,Iswitt,3,Tue May 5 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"Indeed, what you've listed here details the current limitations of various technologies. And I agree, humans are most definitely needed for many functions today and for years to come. However, I tend to align my thinking with the likes of those doing artificial intelligence research (and projections of super intelligence and the like) and think that in the years to come, most if not all of what you've listed will easily be handled by automation of sorts. Your arguments are common for discussions like these but tend to focus too much on what technology is doing now and less on the rapid progress it has made and what that might mean for the future. . - Teaching has already been done by computers. Sure, a human might have created the software and detailed the material for the topic, but after that, the machine takes over permanently. That's how I learned to code. No human stood in front of me or posted lectures online. - Automated research is seeing advances as well. While we're not to the point of full digitization yet (quite likely a temporary problem), there are already full software suites specifically designed to help in research endeavors that have replaced many people who used to do it themselves. This is currently affecting the law world. - Preservation is currently handled best by humans, but with advances in AI, it's not difficult to imagine a ""robot"" of sorts discerning how to salvage an item of some sort. And we have technology that is tactile enough to operate vast areas of cooking, so I see no reason why it wouldn't eventually be used here. Not to mention that preservation is, again, probably just a temporary issue (in terms of what's left to digitize). - I agree that it's hard to imagine dealing with Siri to get complicated questions answered, but I again point to advances in AI. It would have been unheard of just 10 years ago to speak to some device and get a halfway intelligent response that was useful in any way. Now it happens daily. I see no reason why this progress would slow. Eventually, I have a feeling AI would eclipse the need for human-human reference. - As our world becomes increasingly filled with technology, I have a feeling even people who have less or no access now will be fine. Once we get to the point where it becomes less economically sensible or less simple to do basic things like provide texts to prisoners without technology, the technology will be made available. It happens all the time. To use prisons as an example as you do, if we're going to provide these services to them in the first place and it's less expensive to do so with the aid of AI/technology/robots/whatever, we'll do it. - For that last point, this is something machines currently suck at and humans are generally pretty good at. But I emphasize the word currently for a reason. AI is constantly improving.  . If you want to spend some time getting a serious crash course in the current state of AI research (that scared the hell out of me at first but makes sense), check out the following which is an in-depth summary by someone who spent way more time than I would be willing to read through the current body of research: - http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html . Also, here are some other things that might be good to read or watch that discuss at length what the future may very well be in regards to what we've discussed: - The Lights in the Tunnel by Martin Ford - Humans Need Not Apply by CPG Grey - Will Work For Free by Sam Vallely I highly recommend Will Work For Free."
Libraries,34u5ud,kodemage,5,Mon May 4 19:02:29 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that preservation is, again, probably just a temporary issue (in terms of what's left to digitize).   Not when you are dealing with items that are of historical significance. You can take pictures, but you can't replace the item. Some of the stuff I am working with is digitized. The content, while important, is not what makes those items valuable."
Libraries,34u5ud,FrypanJack,0,Tue May 5 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"I understand that. What I mean is that getting the physical things digitized, whatever they may be, is a temporary issue. (There are only so many things to digitize out there.) Keeping the things themselves preserved could very well be handled by some automated process in the future. We might not know what that process is yet, but I would bet money on it happening."
Libraries,34u5ud,Iswitt,1 point,Tue May 5 11:33:01 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, there won't be any need to digitize things going forward because they're already digital!"
Libraries,34u5ud,FrypanJack,1 point,Tue May 5 14:02:32 2015 UTC,"That is assuming that once something is digitized it is preserved forever, which is not the case at all. Changing formats, changing standards, and data corruption due to any number of factors including degradation of the physical media the files are stored on means that digital preservation is a constant job -- and librarians are doing it."
Libraries,34u5ud,Iswitt,1 point,Tue May 5 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"Your argument is assuming that it is not possible to have backups of digitized data or the ability for some automated process to account for new changes with standards, formats or other factors. To use my job as an example, we have processes that automatically backup our databases in multiple locations each night. Sure, all backups could fail at once, but multiple locations minimizes this risk (the same could said of physical objects backed up digitally - the digital file could fail at the same moment the physical object is destroyed, but it is unlikely). The data we work with primarily comes in via some XML schema. However, that's not always true, and our code accounts for that. If for some reason there is an entirely new schema devised that our system does not account for, it would take exactly one person to go in and make it compatible, and then that person can go on ignoring things until this happens again. Plus, with AI advancing as it is, it is not difficult to imagine that a program that writes new programs comes into existence to do the changes for that human. (These kinds of programs already exist - I write them.) It's not a mistake that you don't hear of ebook-only books not having to worry about physical counterparts ""just in case."" They're backed up over and over (Amazon does this, Overdrive does this, etc.)."
Libraries,34u5ud,FrypanJack,1 point,Tue May 5 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"Sure, a lot of that can be automated. You still need librarians to write the software and intervene in cases like the one you mentioned.   Look, I'm not disputing the fact that AI will eventually be able to do just about everything a person can do, regardless of their expertise (though I wouldn't bet on that happening for decades). What I am saying is that there will always be a role for at least one skilled human somewhere in there."
Libraries,34u5ud,kodemage,1 point,Tue May 5 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, we'll always need people for various things.

Libraries,34u5ud,kodemage,1 point,Tue May 5 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're doing it completely wrong then this might be true, but in the real world when we digitize something it is effectively preserved forever.   We make copies and distribute them so the ""degradation of the physical media"" is simply non-existant. If one hard drive fails we substitute another.   There is no way that a physical object can last longer than a digital facsimile because we can infinitely and without any cost duplicate it. Whatever document you might be digitizing it won't last longer than electrons, to suggest otherwise is ridiculous."
Libraries,34u5ud,kodemage,1 point,Tue May 5 21:55:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why everyone thinks I've never heard of copies. Making copies is part of the preservation process I am talking about. LOCKSS and all that.

Just because a computer can process soundwaves, and use that to search for answers to trivia   Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage    doesn't make it smart. It's a great piece of software, but isn't necessarily intelligent either.  Intelligence requires cognition and abstract thought. Can Watson truly abstract an answer from a vague or rhetorical question? That's just a very large search engine with voice recognition. If anything robots could at most replace search engines or catalog searches, but a replacement of librarians, proper, that's a bit premature. AI is a fad.  Have you seen a library budget?

That's about all it is.   AI is not a fad, that's insane. Robots will be smarter than us eventually, it's inevitable. We are not special, there is no reason we can't make something smarter than we are. No reason we must be the pinnacle of intelligence. There is plenty of room above us.   We've made tools that are faster than us, stronger than us, more precise than us, what possible reason could there be that we can't make a tool that's smarter than us?   Also, each library doesn't need it's own AI, that's a profoundly incorrect thing to think. Have you not heard of the internet?

Now, Watson, may be a great performer of acquiring information (not to be mistaken for knowledge), but for what Watson makes up in machine querying and information gathering, it deeply lacks   ""understanding through thought"" intrinsic ""experience"" sense   These 3 things all separate the human brain from a computer processor. It tells a human how to react to certain information (but for the sake of my argument let's ignore the emotion part). These are the ingredients of reasoning, which no robot or computer can do ever. Machines must be instructed to reason. They cannot reason of their own will. If you don't think this is valid, then I suggest you explain to me how a computer would describe a relationship between the letter A and B (e.g. A precedes B -- BA?), compared to any possible human explanation.   Also, each library doesn't need it's own AI, that's a profoundly incorrect thing to think.   LOL. Yeah I use a paper form of reddit, and mail it to the internet. The internet is not AI. It takes human interaction, aka an interface, to provide useful information to the user. You still need the interface. That's the role of robot. You're logic in this instance is flawed.   There will come a point where despite your preference for a human being you will be completely unable to tell the difference unless you ask.   You're right, but like I said, not in our lifetimes.

It doesn't have that capacity at all, no matter how much instruction you give it, or it provides itself. There is no ghost in that machine, so to speak. You can not tell us that a machine can create an abstract thought based on previous patterns. Whatever thought it produces is always based on a previous pattern (statistics). If it's based on some pre-existing information then it is NOT abstract. If anything the machine has been programmed to be a really good analysis or modeling tool, for predictions or forecasting. That is not at all to be equated with cognition."

Anyhow I think you have a limited purview of cognition especially when it comes to contrasting the human mind with machines. A computer receives nothing but instruction. A human can defy instruction well beyond the capacity of any machine. I'm sure a bulk of our thoughts are based on pre-existing patterns (like what to make for dinner, and making a shopping list), but we don't carry out each and every task in that matter, and certainly innovations and inventiveness cannot be lumped into your generalization of thought. That is instinct. Abstract thought is undefined stuff. As in nothing else like it exists. In order for an intelligent machine to have abstract thoughts it can't be based on any predefined experience. There is no way a computer can produce anything out of mere nothingness. Machines are invented as a tool for men, to evolve their thought abstraction to higher levels. The machine, regardless of its intelligence is always one step behind the human brain. If the brain, and its thought creation were so simple, we've discovered how to make ""intelligent"" machines ages ago. The intelligence of even the smartest machine in the world (Watson or the next one) is primitive, fundamental, and even mandates guidance from the minds of men."

The human mind is a machine, you're the one inventing definitions.    A human can defy instruction well beyond the capacity of any machine.    You've never had a computer misbehave on you? It's quite common.    Abstract thought is undefined as nothing else exists in the same realm.   This is tautological nonsense. You're tripping on your own words.    In order for an intelligent machine to have abstract thoughts it can't be based on any predefined experience.   What technological limitation exists that makes this true?   None, your statement doesn't even make sense. Do you hold humans to this same standard? If so, none of us ever has an abstract thought. In any case you seem to completely misusing and misunderstanding the concept of abstraction.    There is no way a computer can produce anything out of mere nothingness.   Aside from quantum fluctuations (which average out to nothing anyways) nothing can be produced from nothing as far as we know. It's called the law of conservation of energy.

Libraries,34ubz0,loweye,4,Mon May 4 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"To meet demand. People use our computers most heavily, our printers in a close second, and books and videos in a distant third. We have a solid amount of computers - almost enough to meet demand during peak usage hours, and most users have laptops these days anyway. But we do not have enough printers - there are long lines waiting to print, and even with a minimal charge per page, there are complaints and issues with paying for printing."

Comfy chairs and plenty of tables for collaboration.   Right now we have very cramped quarters because of previous admin's limited vision of the future. Our library could be something to write home about if the current staff had a blank slate to work with."

I spend a fair bit of time covering the circ desk during breaks or when someone is sick, so whenever I mention, ""I wish we could do more adult (my area) programs"" my coworker gives me a look like I'm insane.   Better marketing? We offer computer classes and when people learn this they always seem surprised and appreciative.   More display-type shelving! It's fun showcasing books and helps get them interest : D  For fun: Video games! I've seen ""Hey I got these games from the library!"" hit the front page more than once, so there's obviously appreciation for the medium.

Our programs are very popular, and lot of us feel more comfortable when there are 2 of us working together to deliver to big groups.

Libraries,34vfpm,Jayviar,9,Mon May 4 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"A suit is always the right answer imo.  Internally you obviously know what the general dress code is but this is an interview.  You dress to impress and look as professional as you possibly can.  I would never go to an in person interview, internally or otherwise, in anything but a suit.  If you don't have/can't get a suit in time nice slacks, button down collared shirt, with a tie and a blazer if it matches.  I don't think you would ever be knocked for dressing up but definitely for dressing down so I always play it safe."

Libraries,34vfpm,das_lawncat,5,Tue May 5 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a dude and I've only ever worn a dress shirt, pants that are not jeans, and dress shoes to interviews. A suit would be bit too much in my opinion. But I can wear jeans and tennis shoes at my job, which might not be the standard."
Libraries,34vfpm,librariant,3,Tue May 5 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"Your work culture sounds like what it is at my library. Day to day, people in admin (except the highest echelon) wear jeans and something comfy. On the public desk, of course, it varies dramatically whether or not the branch is rural, and person to person.  I've decided to go with a dress shirt, tie, and slacks."
Libraries,34vfpm,darkkn1te,2,Tue May 5 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I've always worn for public librarian positions.  I'm in my 20s and I feel like a suit is just too formal and an outdated pretense nowadays.  People get jobs with gauges, visible tattoos, long hair, and facial hair now.  Plus you have the advantage for knowing the culture there.  I've internally interviewed at one place and I came to it dressed in my work clothes (so your outfit sans tie) because they had it in the middle of my usual workday.  I wasn't going to ask for 5 minutes to dress up, that would have seemed ridiculous to them.  But maybe your place is different?  You'd know better than us.  If I was rejected for a position out of hand for not wearing a suit, I would not want to work at that place."
Libraries,34vfpm,darkkn1te,2,Tue May 5 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"Good point on the timing of the interview.   They (knowingly) scheduled my interview two hours before when I have to work. With a one hour interview (her words), travel time from admin to my branch (about 30 minutes), and their assumption that I'm going to want to eat lunch, they're probably not expecting me to dress to the nines. Maybe just the sevens."
Libraries,34vfpm,RascalMultitude,2,Tue May 5 19:08:32 2015 UTC,Always wear a suit for an interview. Anything less and you won't be taken seriously. I would not even consider a candidate who came to an interview without a suit

Once a week, I took my turn as the mobile librarian in a crew of three (with a driver & a clerk) and it was an invaluable education in dealing with a specific type of patron.  As the youngest/newest professional staffer, I also got the ""outreach"" job, delivering books and doing talks at retirement homes and homes for unwed mothers in our area. I mentioned all that while chatting recently with the younger staff at my local not-large library. The kids stared at me as if I had been a librarian in Mordor.  EDIT: speeling"

Libraries,34lavq,robtehall,3,Sat May 2 04:00:22 2015 UTC,"Part of our training at my current library was dealt with 'how to handle animals in the library'  Apparently, I was told, from a legal perspective the only thing you can ask of a person if they bring an animal is 'is that a service animal.' if the answer is yes, you have to take them at their word, even if it is a cat or a snake or a donkey (legally, only dogs and minature ponies can qualify as service animals) It has led to some interesting interactions - obeying this policy.  But I actually don't mind that so much, it can be kind of fun watch people lie and try and get away with their crazy as long it doesn't harm anyone."

Libraries,34lavq,librariant,4,Fri May 8 02:44:55 2015 UTC,"There is no legal protection for companion animals (pets).

Libraries,34lavq,TheRavenAZ,4,Wed May 13 10:25:36 2015 UTC,"but sometimes I get the feeling that some people claim they have companion animals so that they can bring them into the library, or any public building.   Ya think? ;)   Does anyone's library make the distinction between service and companion animals? If you do, how do you deal with the outrage that might sometimes be generated by owners of companion animals that aren't allowed in the library?   We don't let pets in because we don't have to, and these problem people are almost definitely bullshitting you about their ""companion"" animals.  There are plenty of reasons to not let pets in: sanitation, liability (animal attack, allergies), noise.  But to make a change, your director and trustees are going to have to be onboard and pass the necessary rules to ban non-service animals.  If those rules already exist, then the staff needs to stop being such pushovers and enforce them or bring in the supervisor/director to do it.  You're going to deal with wacky pet people, that's unavoidable.  You deal with it by being firm, no exceptions.  They will either go away or they'll get with the program."

Libraries,34gsxd,Bibliolicious,7,Fri May 1 00:53:54 2015 UTC,"I generally don't ask for an ID except when the patron has forgotten their PIN or wants to reset it. But if they tell me ""This is my wife's card"" or ""This is my teenage daughter's card,"" I'll say, ""Officially, their circulation records are private, so they would have to come in in person for that."" If I suspect that it's not their card, then I'll ask for ID. I'll do check-outs for patrons with cards that aren't theirs just because we have automated self-checkout, and the machine only cares that you have the right card, so it's silly for me to be picky if they have to come to the desk to finish a transaction that didn't go through at the machine.  (In our system, parents can access the records of their children up to age 12, but at 13 and up, you get privacy.)   I tend to think of it less as a problem with lost/stolen cards and more as a problem with people invading each other's privacy -- if it's a teenager who has checked out ""Dealing with eating disorders"" or ""Dealing with unplanned pregnancies"" or ""Dealing with coming out as LGBT,"" or if it's a spouse (or ex) who has checked out ""Getting out of your abusive relationship."""
Libraries,34gsxd,Fillanzea,5,Fri May 1 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"If they have a card number and know the PIN, they can use the card no questions asked, because we assume they either own the card or have permission to use the card if they are in possession of both numbers.  If you're not going to rely on card possession, then I question why we would issue cards at all. Why not just rely on ID's at all times if you're going to ask for an ID every time a person comes to you with a card. Furthermore, asking people for ID's when they approach you with a card only serves to unfairly target those who utilize traditional check out methods, and not those self-sufficient patrons that use self-check.  So when do I ask for an ID? When people don't have their card number, but need their card number. When people are updating expired cards. When people make cards. When people do not have cards, and want a guest pass for the computer (I use their ID to type their name into the system. Often people have cards they've forgotten about!). Also, if they need their PIN and the name on the card does not match the name they've given me."
Libraries,34gsxd,glass_hedgehog,2,Fri May 1 03:52:08 2015 UTC,I worked at a large public library system that had pretty much the same policy.
Libraries,34gsxd,myeyestoserve,2,Fri May 1 04:13:14 2015 UTC,"This is essentially our policy. When someone is asking for a card number to use the computers, we ask them just to verify either a phone number or address.   We do require ID for a guest pass- not just because people frequently forget they had old cards, but because we sometimes have a problem with banned patrons branch-hopping to places where no one knows them by sight."
Libraries,34gsxd,noisylibrarian,4,Fri May 1 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"Ours is the same as yours.  We have many patrons who like to have their spouse, etc. pick up books for them and we say as long as you have their card you can.   We have more issues with the reverse - people coming in without any card rather than coming in with a card that's not theirs.  As far as I know it hasn't been a problem but of the the largest library in our system only serves a population of 20,000 so they're mainly pretty small towns.  At the library I worked at previously there was a space for notes in the patron's record that said ""Authorized [spouse/whomever] for pickup"" and patrons could give names of who they wanted to pick up for them.  I can't remember if they filled out a form or how they authorized them."
Libraries,34gsxd,FullMetalSeamstress,2,Fri May 1 03:58:05 2015 UTC,"On their application forms we have a place for an information and hold release and unless someone else's name is noted in the account only the cardholder should be using the card. Often times age or sex makes it easy to tell if the person with the cars isn't the patron, when in doubt we will often note the card or ask for an ID, taking the PIN out if they are using the computer or self checkout with the cardholder present."
Libraries,34gsxd,advocatadiaboli,2,Fri May 1 03:40:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think we keep long-term circ records, or at least accessing them isn't common knowledge among staff. It might be an option you can turn on in the OPAC (on the patron end). Unless you mean books that are currently checked out?   Generally we treat the person holding the card as, well, the cardholder. That's mainly for picking up books, but I suppose it would be a good policy to ask for ID when someone wants to check their records. Even then, patrons could just call in to ask..."
Libraries,34gsxd,librariant,2,Fri May 1 05:46:07 2015 UTC,"What is your policy in regards to patrons with a card that is not theirs?   Basically we don't question it.  If someone wants to pick up, say, their partner's or child's items on hold, though, we require them to have the actual card in hand.  We feel like that's proof that the person present has permission from the card holder.  Lately we've been putting notes on records of who is allowed to pick up items for them, too, so if Mr. Cardholder sent Ms. Cardholder in with just her card, it will say on her record that she's allowed to pick up Mr. Cardholder's items.   Basically... do you require ID if a patron comes up with a card and wants to check their record?   If they want to make changes to their record (address, contact info, etc.) then we require an ID to verify they are who they are."
Libraries,34gsxd,robtehall,2,Fri May 1 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"We allow people to check out books, and pick up holds, with someone else's card.  We do not, however, give out information about the card holder or what they have checked out on the card."
Libraries,34gsxd,disneyfacts,2,Sat May 2 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"Anything the patrons can do by themselves we have no control over (self checkout and computers). If its family member cards, they're fine for checking out books for them. But if we find that someone is using a stolen card, we mark the card lost if we can and require ID if that card is presented. I've never been in that situation where we actually have someone present a stolen card, so I dont know what we do. But there are patrons who have some to try and get around  our computer rules."
Libraries,34gsxd,NetLibrarian,1 point,Sun May 3 09:34:38 2015 UTC,"In our library, the card, or more specifically, the barcode number from the card is all the ID we ask for. We're very clear with patrons that anyone presenting the card number is the only way to access the account, and that anyone they give that card to is considered to be authorized to view the account.  A lot of this stems not just for simplicity for the patron, but from phone requests. We often get calls from people checking how many or what materials they still have out, or asking to renew. They can do all of these things both online and over the phone with only a library card # for access, why should we make it more difficult for them when they come in in person?  All this being said, I really think we should have a PIN system as well, but as part of a large consortium we don't have the personal control to institute that on our own.  Hopefully the larger group will move in that direction."

My school has no e-readers. It has one computer lab. The average age of books in its library in 19 years. The library has had $0 budget for 12 years (parents pay a portion of the part-time librarian's salary). There's no money for e-readers. What ownership rights (if any) exist for the donated e-books?  Do the e-books expire? Can they be transferred to new devices when the old e-readers die?  I have a strong belief printed books outlast e-readers. Why are only inner-city schools receiving e-books?

Libraries,34d3r7,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:56:05 2015 UTC,"Integrated library system:       An integrated library system (ILS), also known as a library management system (LMS),   is an enterprise resource planning system for a library, used to track items owned, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who have borrowed.  An ILS usually comprises a relational database, software to interact with that database, and two graphical user interfaces (one for patrons, one for staff). Most ILSes separate software functions into discrete programs called modules, each of them integrated with a unified interface. Examples of modules might include:   acquisitions (ordering, receiving, and invoicing materials) cataloging (classifying and indexing materials) circulation (lending materials to patrons and receiving them back) serials (tracking magazine and newspaper holdings) the OPAC (public interface for users)   Each patron and item has a unique ID in the database that allows the ILS to track its activity.  Larger libraries use an ILS to order and acquire, receive and invoice, catalog, circulate, track and shelve materials. Smaller libraries, such as those in private homes or non-profit organizations (like churches or synagogues, for instance), often forgo the expense and maintenance required to run an ILS, and instead use a library computer system.

I worked in a public library and I was more inclined to want to read everything I touched. I now work in a special library and have little to no interest in the subject matter. In my current job I would say I handle books, but at no point am I sitting there looking at the book jacket or skimming the first chapter, or anything fun."

Libraries,34a6hv,MechAngel,9,Wed Apr 29 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"I work in youth services in a public library, and quite honestly, liking the act of reading (not necessarily ""books,"" which is a format we use for reading) is pretty crucial to being successful in that role at this point in time.  I don't know how anyone would take on the huge number of reader's advisory questions that YS librarians get if they did not spend much of their free time reading for pleasure.  That being said, I think that in order to work in a public library, you have to love people and love being a central part of the community first.  Your love of reading is maybe second-most important, in my opinion.  u/seamonkeydoo2 mentioned that they dislike hearing ""I like books"" in interviews because it seems like a ""stock answer,"" and I'd completely agree with that.  It feels like something you're likely to hear when people can't think of a better, more detailed answer."

It's good to understand people who love books, because they're going to be your patrons.    However!   ""Loves books"" is not the most important thing.  ""Loves people"" is the most important thing.  If you want to work in libraries (and I mean the public side, not cataloging etc.), you need to love people.  That's the most important thing.

But it's also because they exist no where else that I want to digitize them and make them open, let their ideas find a way to someone new.  But I have patrons that ask me all the time if I've read the book they're holding and 99.99% of the time, I can say no. Because in general, I don't read that many books.

Libraries are about making knowledge, entertainment and useful resources available to the public. That's why I'm there, really.   Oh, and I love books, but it never hurt me to throw them away. They're just paper and cardboard, and they have no real worth if no one's reading them. Besides, if I throw out a book, it doesn't erase its contents from existence. It's just one copy. If it's busted or outdated or just plain unpopular, kick it to the curb, I say."
Libraries,34a6hv,librariant,17,Wed Apr 29 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"So let's talk about this. If a person likes books, would it be reasonable for them to work in libraries?   ""I want to be a librarian [read: public librarian] because I like books"" has to be the most self-centered, egotistical reason for doing it.  Certainly no one goes into the profession for the money.  Why?  Because when you're at a library, you need to cater to everyone's literary interests except your own.  Sure, there will be overlap between your tastes and others, but you have to equally serve the people who read Harry Potter and who read Twilight.  That's tough.  I don't do it, but I also don't like books all that much.  English majors who go straight to library school either have a ridiculous misconception of what a public library is or they think they're going to elevate the literary discourse by being so clever and well-read.  No, you're going to read picture books to children and grit your teeth when some crusty old dude checks out the latest Bill O'Reilly conspiracy-fest.  Working with books isn't the same as liking books.  I like money, but I don't like investing it so I have a brokerage do that for me."

I don't worry about the building when I'm off because the library is closed - but if I have to take a day off, depending on the schedule - me calling out could be the difference between the branch opening or being closed due to short staffing.

Libraries,34a6hv,wmcduff,3,Wed Apr 29 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Kinda sorta not really.  Working in the library will put you in a place full of things you like and love, but won't, in any real way, give you the chance to really enjoy them, at least not on the clock.  There is a lot of activity at the library that can be both tedious, time consuming, or simply require your attention that makes actually working with the books less core to the job itself.  Also understand that there is a professional (MSIS or MLS) degree involved with librarianship.  You can still work in a library as hourly part-time, hourly full-time, full-time salaried positions within a library.  These jobs can vary substantially.  Some jobs are 'front of the house', dealing with patrons (customers isn't quite the right term with libraries) in one form or another.  Others are 'back of the house' where one is processing materials, requests, shelving, sorting, shifting, shelf-reading, network/IT support, and more.  I'd say there are two ways to look at libraries... one is if you want to help people with knowledge, another is if you want to organize and categorize knowledge.  The loving books thing is close, but ultimately may lose out to what libraries and librarians end up actually doing on a regular work day."
Libraries,34a6hv,zedshouse,3,Wed Apr 29 19:18:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think liking books is all that important compared with liking organizing books. Be it circulation, cataloguing, inter-library loans, or receiving, all play a part in fighting the natural entropy. I think only purchasing really focuses on knowledge of book content (though there is some of that in circulation as well). You have to be OK with things not being perfect (because they never, ever will be), but always willing to try to improve things."
Libraries,34a6hv,macjoven,2,Wed Apr 29 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"I was an English Lit. major and volunteered for a long time in my local library. I also toyed with the idea of going to grad school for library sciences. My experience working at my public library cured me of this notion.  They had a crisis at the library because so many people left at one time and they had no one to man the circulation desk and approached me to work. I started a week later and was thrilled thinking it was the job of a lifetime. I quickly rethought my ideas of what the library was.  There were reasons that the library could not hold onto workers: they paid horribly, expected too much and I learned that many people who enter this field may love books, but from what I saw did not feel the same about people.   The librarian in charge of circulation was notorious for treating the staff horrendously. I did not see this side of her until I began working under her. She had an extremely sour disposition, berated us and imposed ridiculous rules. The first week I started the other staff filled me in about her, but I had already observed her berate one of the staff so badly that this middle aged woman burst into tears, which she did a few more times over the course of the month until she tendered her resignation and filed a grievance against the offender who had a thick file of these, I later learned. Here is a milder example of her ridiculousness. The library was having a benefit and a catering company began to set up an hour or two before the library was set to close. This librarian, I'll call her ""Lane"", came over to me and asked me to help the caterers which I promptly did. I was helping them for a good twenty minutes when Lane came over to the lady I was helping and asked: ""Is he bothering you? I'm just asking because he tends to bother people"". I was stunned. I had only been doing what this woman had asked me to do. I was furious and immediately went to the director and told her what happened as well as how the woman had behaved over the past two months with me as well as other co-workers. The director sighed knowingly and asked me to write down my experiences saying she would put it in her file with the rest. I was angry and told her I was giving notice and would not waste my time writing something down only to have it pad a file.  The other librarians who had worked here were no better. The woman who was in charge of the children's dept. is notoriously difficult. She is very uncomfortable speaking with people and yet insists she heads the events which she plans for months in advance and on the day of the event changes everything around so that all the preparations were disorganized and only in her head. I personally observed this as I was there for several of these events and spoke with the rest of the kid's librarians who were thoroughly disgusted because of the chaos, but informed me it was completely normal.  The inter-loan librarian spent most of her time searching and requesting material only for herself. I requested something once and had looked it up to see if it was available and it was. She sent me a rejection letter and I told her it was available and from what library. She told me she didn't see it was for me and would request the material. She then told me: ""You know I never kill myself looking for this stuff"". I did know.   The board was very bad. They had little concern for the day to day operations and were all the same people on all the boards in the area.   These are just a few of the people I worked with. I spoke with a friend (librarian) about this and she told me that many of the people who enter the field have a love of books, but are generally not outgoing, sociable people. I am a guy and all but one of the employees was female. The younger staff was frustrated because these women notoriously didn't like to deal with the public and at every opportunity pushed the patrons off onto the younger staff. One woman who manned the reference dept. would often get up and walk away from patrons mid sentence. I laughed a few times watching this.  The other side of the equation are the patrons. Like many libraries we had an issue with the homeless population. They are generally well behaved, but there are a few exceptions that gave one pause. One of the younger librarians was attacked and sexually assaulted in the stacks. There were frequent belligerent patrons who were such an issue that the library hired security. Before this it was up to the librarians to deal with these people and it could be kind of scary, with no back up from the administration who made the rules we enforced, and for a few dollars more than minimum wage. What most of it boiled down to was the demographics of our area had changed and the library had really not kept up. They were the last library in the state to go to computers. Most of the staff were privileged people drawn from the ranks of the prominent families who also were the biggest donors. I'm sure some of these issues can be found in the bigger cities and may even be worse. I just wanted to let others who think this is a dream job understand that the love of books and the reality of library work can be at odds. My experience was not positive, but one of the young women I was friendly with and who worked with the teen population absolutely loved it, telling me: ""in spite of dealing with brats all day, I really love it!""."

The issues I think is where you work in a library solely because  you like books.  I think this indicates a disconnect between where libraries were in the past and what they are now.  To me the current (and future) library model is an information and community hub.  This includes books, databases, computer services and access (including specialized software and hardware like 3D printing), language learning, community programs, learning programs, and all manner of things that don't necessarily have anything to do with books.  In most libraries, the people are really the most important part.  In tax payer funded libraries, patrons are the reason the libraries even exist.  I love having someone of the older generation come in and helping them work on a computer and giving them the knowledge of how to do even the most basic of things (like print an email).  They get so happy when they are able to do it and build upon that skill with more.  Helping people access information and new skills is awesome.  Also weeding the collection and getting rid of books is a highly necessary part of being a professional librarian.  I've found in the past that some people have trouble with this and that can be problematic.  Every once in awhile a thread in /r/books will pop up about a library throwing away books and everyone is all outraged without listening to the very real issues of space and outdated (sometimes dangerous) information."

Libraries,34bibq,benfranklinsmustache,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"Last year my branch gave all our librarians a budget of $150 for programs (anything over $50 goes to admin so that wasn't included) with the expectation that we would do at least 1 program a month.  I do teen programming and easily stayed within that. The anime club is my main one which only costs about $6 or 7 for snacks. The anime Halloween party was more expensive because I got pizza. The teen writing group (which unfortunately was a flop) was about $15 for notebooks, pens, and snacks.  My most expensive one is coming up which is the post-it notes superheroes we saw a lot of on Reddit a few weeks ago. That's going to be between $40-50."

Between our Friends, a local business sponsor, and grants, about $2500. $1500-2000 on performers/presenters, and $500-$1000 on summer reading supplies - prizes, etc.  About 2/3 goes toward children's programming. We also have a network of presenters who do not charge us fees - local authors and business owners mostly.  We are a stand-alone library, in a suburb of about 11,000 people."
Libraries,34bibq,princess-smartypants,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"Technically my programming budget is $0.00 but I get money through the Friends and need to request it for anything that I want to do.  Our newsletter comes out three times a year and I would say on average I spend $1000.00 each period so that would be $3000.00 for the year.  I'm the teen librarian and serve grades 6-12.  The $3000.00 would include everything like presenter fees, materials/supplies and prizes.  I have a program every Tuesday evening and usually two special programs per month either after-hours on Friday or Saturday afternoon so this is for approximately six programs per month and 72 programs per year.  My attendance is pretty good (I think).  Here are some examples which were all between January and April.   After-hours movie and pizza party - 42 teens and about $50.00 for pizza/pop Stop-Motion workshop - 26 teens Minecraft LAN Party - 46 teens and about $50.00 for pizza/pop RPG Geek Night - 31 teens and about $40.00 for pizza/pop Doctor Who Trivia Night - 21 teens and I just served popcorn and lemonade which we get in bulk and always have."

The branch I manage has a new FOL group so they don't have enough money to fund anything yet.  So I fund all the programs."

Libraries,34692u,librariant,3,Tue Apr 28 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"In my consortium, it's mandatory that all barcodes go on the front cover so our ILL sorting facility could use automated sorting machines.

At my library, they write down ISBNs and ask where they are.  And then I have to retype the numbers back into the catalog to figure out what they want (because they don't remember the titles anymore).  It's really our OPAC's fault because for some reason it prominently put ISBNs at the top of a record and you have to scroll down before you see call numbers.  But I still want to say to them ""How on earth would this 13-digit number be used to tell you where something is?""

Libraries,3461zf,betweenthecovers,2,Tue Apr 28 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"No registration.  You read a book, fill out a slip, it's entered into that week's drawing.    Theme is a suggestion, not a requirement.  It's tied into whatever the YA and children's theme is that year.  I make a booklet with suggested titles, because sometimes people really need direction.  I include both fiction and nonfiction titles.  A person can read more than one book a week and submit a raffle entry for each book they read.  Multiple entries increase your chance of winning.  Prizes are gift cards we get through donations and items we put together after trips to cheap stores.  A $5 CVS card, a brand new donated DVD and a box of microwave popcorn makes a great prize.    The event runs for six weeks and the grand prize (I think last year it was a Nook that was purchased with Friends money) is won by a drawing of ALL the entries.  You don't have to read a book for each of the six weeks to qualify for the grand prize.  Someone can read 1 book and win the prize for a particular week and the grand prize.  Winners from the previous five weeks are re-entered into the grand prize drawing.  We tried to have  a program for each week that loosely tied into the theme.  It was always a stretch.  I hosted a program for making your own salt scrubs and foot soaks.  We had the local gardening club come in and do a program on container gardening.  The local police came in to do a program on crime scene analysis.  Everyone at the program is given an entry to that week's drawing.  You could read ZERO books and win the grand prize.    I think it was successful because we didn't have any sort of commitment.  It was easy to follow and fun for everyone, whatever their level of involvement.  The biggest thing is the planning on the library's end.  Planning your theme, programming, prizes, and booklet takes a lot of time.  It was worth it."

I like to think I'm a pretty relaxed and hands-off manager, until you screw up (like majorly, everyone makes mistakes). My approach is a little different because I've never supervised front-line workers, so I never had to worry about covering a desk. All I cared about was that the work got done.   I look for people who:  -are going to show up  -who know when to ask questions (if you don't know, ask! I promise I don't get mad. The only stupid question is the one you have but don't ask)  -show some consideration of others/maturity (need to talk to your adviser or make up an exam? That's fine, academics come first, but you need to TELL ME and make up the missed time)  -have a willingness to work. ""Refilling the copier"" may not be spelled out exactly in your job description, but you know how to do it...so why are you calling me from my office all the way across the building?   -critical thinking skills and the ability to work independently once trained. If I give a set of directions (""shelve these books""), you should be able to understand that if a patron asks you a question, you should stop shelving and assist the patron. Or what if the book falls apart while you're shelving it?   You should know to give it to a supervisor, and not shelve it. 6 months into the job, you should not require that I babysit you while you do something you were trained on during day 1.

I'm most familiar with public libraries that serve populations of less than 10,000, so I'll talk about those. These libraries make up the majority of the public libraries in the United States, about 58%. It is true that many of these libraries have budgets of several hundred thousand dollars, but this doesn't mean that they have that money to spend.  Between 60 and 75% of the typical library's budget is spent on personnel. The remaining 25-40% covers library materials, technology, and programming. Sometimes, libraries pay their facilities costs directly - other times the town pays it directly.  Additionally, some states have rules that tell libraries what percentage of their budgets they must spend on materials (books, movies, music, etc.). If a library didn't follow their state's rules, they could lose their accreditation. This means that their patrons wouldn't have access to other libraries' materials, to the state ILL system, or to the state-funded databases. So, even if a library had a $100,000 materials budget, it would be a very bad idea to spend that money on anything else."

It definitely would have been helpful. That being said, I don't agree with a lot on that list either.   I think a library website needs to be very user friendly and completely accessible. Most library websites do not do that well. During our planning phase of the website redesign, I joked that we should be revolutionary and create a homepage that has our hours, locations, how to contact us, a massive search box for the catalog/digital collections and nothing else. I think a lot of libraries try to cram way too much into their sites when we know the average library user wants to know what new feature DVDs we have.  I'm a huge fan of Salt Lake City's website.

Checking the catalog is the first thing anyone ordinarily goes to a library website for. My local small library system's website has a search box -- but it's to stuff on the website itself. You have to click on the menu at the left to get to the catalog. An extra step, and often a slow-loading one.  Since their budget is rather limited, I'm sure this is an off-the-shelf package (though I don't know from whom), which means there's probably a bunch of others out there that are similarly crippled."

I'm a solo library, and more than a library position, it's more records management. It's not quite what I intended to do, but I like it. My work is a lot of cataloging of digital materials, working in SharePoint, consulting and researching for different departments. It's a unique environment so I had to learn a lot before I really understood the industry.  I do find it a little repetitive and eventually seek to go back to traditional libraries as I enjoy the education aspect of those."

Libraries,33pvnp,z_formation,7,Fri Apr 24 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I love this question.  I'm a solo librarian/archivist working for a large fashion/retail company. I have a MLS and an MA in History from Simmons College, and I hoped to work as a processing archivist in an academic institution or historical society. Guess what, younger me? Those jobs are hard to find. I honestly knew that, but proceeded anyway.   After graduation, I almost immediately got a job as a public librarian. It wasn't a good fit for me. This place in particular was very conservative and I never once felt any freedom to innovate or even apply the skills I used in my studies.  Then I saw this weird job come up at a fashion company. I thought, what the hell, I love design and fashion. So I applied, and here I am, four years later, still there.  What does your day-to-day look like?  Easier to say week-to-week. I do competitive intelligence work (gathering examples of our competitor's work and monitoring the industry), which takes up my mornings. I do a lot of copy and original cataloging various resources, from our historical products, to vintage bags, to hardware. I spend time on Ebay building our archives, marketing our resources internally, answering reference questions, and interfacing with collectors of the brand's products. I also deal a lot with various vendors. Because I lost my intern, I spend a lot of time putting things away that get returned, which bums me out and is frustrating.   What counts as experience in the field for someone who wants to be a special librarian?  Any library experience is fine, but anything to do with cataloging or reference is especially helpful.   What is your favorite part of being a special librarian, and what is your least favorite part?  I love having creative freedom and getting to work on lots and lots of different projects. Since I'm in a corporate library, the ""patrons"" are very respectful, since they will see me again and again.   I'm a solo and I just hate it. I'm lonely and have no one to bounce ideas off of, no one who speaks my language. I'm not well integrated into my ""team"" and don't feel any real connection to them, even though they are nice people. (It was an arbitrary move to put me on this team, because I really don't fit well anywhere.)  What courses do you wish you had taken to prepare you for your daily job needs?  Databases!   But man, you learn so much on the job. I strongly, strongly suggest focusing on getting as much experience in libraries as possible, regardless of the type.  Hope this helps, and I'm happy to answer any other questions."

Honestly, I think the subject degree gave me an edge in that hiring managers were like, that's cool. It looks good on paper, I guess, and I'm glad I have it for a number of reasons. I also studied American art and culture, which helped me land my current job. (If I had focused on Asian military history, that would have been less helpful.)  You could use an MA in International Relations to support an application for a job in international librarianship, government libraries or even law info centers. An international corporation might look kindly on that kind of education, too."
Libraries,33pvnp,emkay99,3,Sat Apr 25 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"The term refers to a librarian dealing with a special -- i.e., limited -- collection or library or technical subject. Public and academic librarians are most often generalists by training and experience.  I was a bit of both (now retired), having gone back for an M.A. in history and becoming a ""local history"" specialist as well as a certified archivist, and also a genealogist. I always worked for a very large public library system, though, where there was enough space to do it both ways.  My friends include an architectural historian (heavy on local house-history), a law librarian (for a very large private law firm), and a ""historical records"" librarian (who works for a state library and interfaces with county courthouses around the state). Which gives you an idea of the breadth of the possibilities.  It's likely that whatever you're especially interested in has a library/records aspect somewhere, but you should probably reckon on an advanced subject degree after you finish your MLS.  And a few years of general experience between the two would not go amiss. Do that second degree on the side, spread on three over four years, while you work full-time, as a lot of us have. Cheaper, too.  EDIT: speeling"

They all had libraries (sometimes they mostly were library), specialized to the subject they dealt with. I might note that my stepson is a roboticist and the research institute he works at has a sizable research library, including an entire room on robotics and associated subjects.  Large research centers are usually affiliated with government agencies or universities, plus a few large foundations. I suspect that those would be the cream of the crop, though, in terms of employment.  I have another friend who used to work at the U.S. Navy's Hooker Research Library in DC, which is pretty damn big.

My older bro is self taught on computer programming, does it for a living, and he learned it all online and by tinkering.   The catch is is that a lot of people don't know how to search for these things, and when they find it, how to trust it as a verified source. My mom will quote things she read online without checking sources or analyzing it further, so I've had a few face-palms at some of the stuff she comes up with.

Libraries have always been adapting to changing information needs and technology, but lately it seems that we've allowed ourselves to get left behind. Somethings, like funding, are out of our control, but others like professional development and skill training, are in our control. It all comes back to understanding what our community needs and how libraries can creatively apply their current skills to met that demand. It also helps to communicate to our users how we can help them and not just expect them to come running to us for help."

Like 3 times more than the next most popular and 10 times more than the next. I worked extremely hard on it, and I am very proud of how much it's used even after I handed it over to someone else.  I think they can be useful if you use them for the right things. In my current situation at an academic library, our guides don't get nearly as much use, but they are tailored for very small groups. They're helpful for what they are, but sometimes I think that we put way too much information in them.   Personally, I prefer the 2.0 design wise since it's easier to make them pretty that way. The original is so clunky and hard to customize, and if you don't have any html knowledge, you're stuck with the basics.

Likewise, LibCal and LibAnswers are similar paradigms.  For context, I'm a sole systems librarian supporting 2500 fte's and 600 staff with only 3 librarians in total.

We tried a book club that went over all right (we held it at the local coffee shop), and we've had a LOT of success with rated M game tournaments. We've done two Call of Duty tournaments and are planning an MKX tourney for summer reading. I held a DIY program for reupholstering/refinishing furniture that was well attended and ended up being a mix of all age groups, from young teens to retirees. The hypertufa program we hold every year is well attended by younger adults, and anything art/craft related is really popular too. I also help run a library con, and it was a big hit specifically with this age group. (The next one is in two weeks!)  One thing I've encountered is that with most programs--even the financial ones like buying your first home, or preparing for a job interview--are going to be attended by older folks too. So keep that in mind. I have to say that the financial classes we've offered haven't been very well attended, but a different department was in change of those, which may have had an effect on their popularity. (I'm not sure how well the programs were publicized.)  If you can get off library property, especially to hold a program (like trivia in a bar, hosted by the library, or a baking class), it will benefit you. A lot of younger adults just don't come into the library--they're lost to the library after college, when they make enough money to buy their own entertainment, and don't return until they have kids and need to get books for them.

Libraries,33lcgv,ahniwa,5,Fri Apr 24 16:36:18 2015 UTC,"Most vendors try and inflate 5% or more per year. Most will lower that if you have any sort of conversation with them. 2% is good; 1% is great; lower than that, or flat, is nearly impossible to achieve. If you demonstrate extreme budget hits, some vendors will not increase your prices for a limited time - this was more common when the ""bubble popped"" but is likely less common now.  If you want access for more people, have an idea of how you will create those accounts and provide that access. Monitoring accounts and access for staff is easy enough - you know who those people are. Monitoring it for your members is more difficult. How will you get in touch with them and tell them they can create accounts and access your data? How will you track which users are staff and which are members? Why do members needs access in the first place?  I would, additionally, check to see what resources are available through the public library system that serves your members. If they have access to the same or similar products there, perhaps you can reconsider spending your organization's money for redundant access.  Just a few thoughts. Feel free to PM me. I don't negotiate contracts anymore but I've done my share in the past and worked with plenty of vendors."
Libraries,33lcgv,greenlibrarian,2,Thu Apr 23 17:28:15 2015 UTC,I should add that you can get lower inflation most of the time in longer contracts. If you agree to a 5-year contract it would likely be easier to negotiate a 1% increase per year or similar.

We just wouldn't be able to afford it.  Besides, if thirty-five cents is nothing, why is it so hard for the patron to pay it to support their library when they don't remember the due date even with e-mail notifs, text notifs, and paper due date slips?"

We're rural and we have a number of grants and other funding for which I'm thankful, but we have nowhere near what we need for five branches. Plus, this fiscal year, the county actually cut our funding back again.  Perhaps libraries (including us) should look into promoting fees as funding then instead, so there is no shame? I try to tell everyone as they pay late fees that it goes straight back to us, allowing the library to run for their benefit. It's only ten cents a day and they even have one grace day extra. Late fees never exceed five dollars maximum unless the book is marked lost. In that case, if the book is returned, they are forgiven everything but a max of five dollars for overdue fees except for dire circumstances.  Honestly, I can't understand why anyone would think that's a terrible injustice. You're right, though. Every system is different, so what works for us may not work for some."

It's set up as a three-week class in our computer lab (one hour a week because we operate on a semester class type schedule - so 3 hours total). I use a powerpoint, and have printouts and a manilla folder they can use to put together the handouts (things like action verb list, the PP slides, etc). I ask that they either bring in a resume they already have, or fill out a ""resume worksheet"" so it's ready to go with work history 'n stuff by the second class. I'm no resume-professional so sometimes I worry on how to improve, but I figure it's better than no instruction at all.   I find that the most time-consuming part is them typing out each field as patrons have varying levels of comfort with the keyboard, so breaking it up into more than one session gives them time to finish ""homework"" that they can't finish in class. Downside is that if they need it right away, breaking up the class like that doesn't help. We have the luxury of providing flash drives though, so I give a copy of everything and extra examples I didn't print out, so if they need it right away they at least have more resources.

But I do take your point that someone's mistakes early in life shouldn't prevent them from ever accessing library services.  My issue is with recidivist patrons that are banned for a few months to a year (for threatening staff, or theft, or something equally serious), then are able to come back in and resume causing problems.  I think if you are banned for a certain bad behavior, wait until the ban expires, and then come back into the library and continue that behavior, you should be banned for a longer period, if not permanently.  I'm all for second chances, but a line has to be drawn somewhere.  If not a lifetime ban, then at the very least a ban that lasts multiple years."
Libraries,3310m6,librariant,9,Thu Apr 23 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience, problem people are typically dealt with when other patrons complain about them.  So ideally patrons will complain, or can be encouraged to complain with a few suggestive hints. ;)   So I guess I am looking for suggestions at my level ( library aide) on how to deal with problems such as this. I am second guessing myself after yesterday, and while I have been told by my supervisor not worry, that I'm not in trouble and the situation was a learning tool, I still feel bad about the whole thing.    It's hard not to take it personally in the short term, believe me, but you'll let it go after a day or so.  Hyper-angry people are like that because it's the tactic they learned will get what they want.  Maybe they're mentally ill and don't know any better or maybe they're just assholes.  Going from 0 to screaming is a near-surefire way to get anyone off balance in a given situation because, like you said, it's impossible to have a rational conversation.  That's the point, they want to short circuit the process and immediately get what they want.    Learn to say no.  This is the most important advice.  If you won't do what they ask, then their tactic has no power and they're completely helpless because they never learned to behave above the level of little baby child.  No exceptions to a policy, don't go above and beyond to please them.  Being an assistant is actually a great excuse for saying no because ostensibly you have no authority or experience!  He wants you to forgive all his fines?  Sorry, I can't, you have to talk to the head of circulation.  He wants to stand at the circ desk and harass you with pointless, detailed questions?  Sorry, you have to go ask the reference desk, I don't know the answer to that.  If he starts screaming over the phone, hang up on his ass.  If he's a known problem child, who will care if you do?  He has no allies.    When saying no is met with resistance, repeat yourself.  Repeat repeat repeat.  Don't explain, it's not your job to explain.  You're just an assistant!  People like that (who still maintain a tenuous link to reality) tend to learn who gives in and who doesn't.  Maybe they won't leave you completely alone, but they will probably give up once they know you say no to everything and waste their time."

""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" is a good non-apology.  Don't offer to get someone until he asks (unless you feel unsafe and want help), don't attempt to explain the intricacies of the library hierarchy.  The only think you want to feed him is the rope to hang himself from.  People like that don't have the patience to figure out how to behave, they either self-destruct or give up and bother someone else.  Patron sounds unbalanced, though.  Emphasize how unsafe you feel around him, preferably in an email.  No one wants that in writing should something major happen down the road.  And if you voice/document your concerns, maybe it will encourage others to do the same.   Hopefully from now on their presence will be less and less. Up until yesterday I had no issues with them because I always said ""yes"". The first ""No, I am sorry I can't do that"" and BAM.

In a public library setting (you don't say where you are, but I will assume public) the manager/director may have leeway to ban people for a period of time, or they may have to go through legal processes first.  Either way, get the director involved, document everything, and make sure to include that ""this patron is disturbing everyone"" - it is a public issue and not just your issue."

Libraries are supposed to be quiet places. You could kick someone out for being loud. Or if they are gesticulating wildly and you are afraid of a harmful or offensive contact. Or if they are running.

And you are welcome to your opinion that librarians telling people that verbal abuse is not allowed in the library is somehow equivalent to racism. But in every library I've seen, the code of Just Fucking Be Nice to People Already is equally enforced, no matter what color, creed, sexual orientation, or state of intoxication.  And you are absolutely welcome to research what you believe your legal rights to be in the library w/r/t to verbally abusing librarians and patrons, and then attempt to enforce what you believe your rights to be in your local library.

I believe that a patron's right to Free Speech exists. There is no right to not be offended. Offensive speech is protected speech. Even if it is aimed at a public official. This isn't an opinion...this is the law of the land.  3) Patron Codes of Conduct are nice. But they should be aimed at behavior...not the content of speech, especially in a Public Library setting.

Even though it could be reasonable to have a nonharassment policy, in this case, the unwritten policy was broadly stated and lacked reasonable limitations as to the conduct it sought to prevent. The policy failed to place geographical limitations on where such harassment or intimidation could have occurred, and did not place reasonable guidelines on the proscribed behavior."

After a couple of reports, the patron gets a verbal warning from safety staff that, should their behavior continue, they may face suspension. If after a number of suspensions do not work, they are potentially banned. The library board has to review the case, but if each incident is well documented, then it strengthens our voice.   Absolutely any staff member can make an incident report. It took a few meetings and support from safety staff for those of us who work on the front lines to feel empowered enough to write these reports.

De-escalation training can help in situations where it hasn't gotten to the level of calling security or police because it gives you some tools to work with, and ideally, it gives you a measurement for knowing when it's appropriate to call for back-up.

Libraries,32ovzy,det_bunsenmunch,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"We've been using bibliotecha RFID for about a year now and we've tried a number of things with ILLO.   Firstly, we use SirsiDynex Workflows here, so I'll base my reply off of that.   We use self-check kiosks with a staff member at a hub to deal with issues when they arise.   When we first received Illo's after making the switch to RFID, we simply created a temporary ILLO record in workflows and added the item to our catalogue using the barcode. This record was greyed out to prevent patrons from finding it the public catalogue or placing holds on it. The downside was patrons had to wait in line to check out ILLO items, so on to solution number 2.   We used RFID bookmarks. Same procedure as above, only with a reprogrammable tag (apparently this can be done 100 times). The tags are inserted into the book and the book can be checked out with the self-check kiosk. If the bookmarks didn't come back, the borrower was billed for it, and I think it was $1-$2/bookmark.  However, what we found was certain libraries out there in library land have the same set-up we do, and when we were scanning items to be added to our collections, the RFID pads were picking up the lending library tags and reprogramming them or causing other undue problems. Obviously, the lending libraries had issues with this, so we tried thing #3.   Coloured bookmarks and notes. If you had a red bookmark, you had to take it out of the item, put the bookmark in the machine, but not the book. If it was a yellow bookmark, this was the same procedure as #2. Not surprisingly, this caused a great deal of confusion with our customers, so we've now gone back to simply checking ILLO's out with their barcodes like we did in the first place.   Beep.

The graphic designer likely chose a black dress and dark hair because it allows the colors on the book to stand out more. The red circle with the cut out for the eyes is more clearly reminiscent of street signs – specifically the ‘no entry’ sign which is a red circle bisected with a white line.  The writing across the chest, however, is rather poorly placed. Too, there's a lot of writing there in an attempt to 'explain' the image.

I understand that it is common for people to vent on social media, but they would specifically mention the library in the post and sometimes the posts were bordering on breaking patron's confidentiality.  It was a very small town so mentioning on facebook that some lady with red hair and a funny dress came in could very easily end up with someone identifying the person they were talking about.  One girl did end up getting fired because she was dumb enough to make these negative posts while at work.  There wasn't an official policy, but the director did send out a memo regarding being careful about what we choose to post about the library.  It worked and the people who were posting these things quit (or changed their settings to be more private)."

If they are truly saying such things in a public setting (non-private tweets, public Facebook posts) then should that not also apply?  If however, they are saying this privately on Facebook (visible only to select friends), how is it any different than trying to govern their speech at home? You have no idea what their privacy settings are on Facebook. Just because you can see those posts, it doesn't mean that the patrons they have friended can. Without a complaint filed by someone, I wouldn't jump to conclusions.  Speaking from personal experience, we have been trying to get a social media policy passed for years at my library. In our case, it's not that we wish to restrict what people say on their personal accounts (there is only the vaguest line about our library not wishing to restrict free speech outside the library) but to in fact just govern how we will handle the creation and management of accounts for all our locations. It's been a nightmare trying to pass just that.

Much of what is covered in it is already covered by our general policies, including IT acceptable use, but we wrote it a few years ago when we felt that it provided an educational tool for staff members in the growing importance and impact of social media.

Libraries,328h0a,librariant,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"This is funny to me because the curriculum at Simmons demanded we perform at least one presentation per class, regardless of the class subject.  So we had lots of mandatory presentation practice.  I'm by no means a captivating presenter, but I'm OK at it so it got old after the first few classes.  If it's only 10 minutes, that's easier than it sounds and you'll probably have trouble keeping it under time.  Have complete bullet point notes to help you when you get off track.  Practice with your friends/family/roommates repeatedly for pace and timing.  If you have a Powerpoint, don't make it just slides full of text.  Keep it short and add some token illustrations.  And bring backup printouts of the slides just in case something happens.  Make eye contact with your interviewers!"

Honestly, nobody checks out the kindles or iPods--nobody.   Laptops are really popular. We circ them for 3 hours and they have to stay in the library.  The overdue fine is 3$/hour and a replacement fee will be charged after a week.   The chromebooks are ridiculously popular. They circ for 3 days and can leave the library (obviously). The overdue fine is $5/day with a replacement fee after a week.  Kindles circ for a week with the same overdue policy as the chromebooks.  Technically no renewals, but we will renew them if we have other machines available at the time of the request.  We're a mid-sized university, so everything is tied to the student's ID and billing goes straight to the Bursar's Office. Students won't be able to register for classes or graduate if they have fines on their accounts. Community patrons who have courtesy cards with us can only check out laptops."

Libraries,324bg9,librariant,2,Sat Apr 11 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Late back to the party! So I'm not entirely sure what IT has set up on the chromebooks. They are ""virtual"" machines, so there's no hard drive. Venturing a somewhat educated guess, they've probably got a hidden admin account where they can lock down some settings for the ""guest"" account that students would access.   I do know that everything is governed through a gmail login (our uni uses gmail for all student accounts so that's already set up for them, but students could also login using a personal gmail account). Then students can log out of the machine or turn it off (which will log them out). Since files can't be saved to an internal hard drive, logging out would ensure the student's stuff couldn't be accessed. We check every chromebook that gets returned to make sure 1) all the cords, etc. are accounted for and 2) the student has logged out."

I don't know if they still do it and can't find a copy of the policy on the website.  To check them out, you had to have a card with us (resident or non-resident didn't matter) and sign a form that basically said you would be careful with it, not add your own books to it (with all the stupid Adobe Digital Editions and drm nonsense that was happening at the time), and ""break it, you buy it"". Checkout period was two or three weeks with no renewals.  It was age-restricted, so a young kid couldn't check it out themselves, but a parent/guardian/grandma could check it out on their card and let the kid use it. I feel like the age requirement was 18 because of how expensive those eReaders were when they were purchased.   The per-day late fee was also much higher than the other items - I feel like it was $5/day and rolled to being a lost item much more quickly as well.   The ereaders were stored in the locked server room, obviously to prevent theft. If someone was interested in checking out one of the readers, there was a list at the circulation desk that had which books were on which ereader.  This was a multi-branch city, so the ereaders would not circulate to the other branches. You had to come in person and return it in person to the same  branch. At checkout, the patron was warned explicitly to return it to the circulation desk and to not return it in either of the bookdrops."

We also lend Raspberry Pi kits, which circulate through the system like a normal item (3-week borrowing period, check out with a valid library card).

Libraries,324bg9,akamarkman,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:51:44 2015 UTC,"Just search for ""technology"" or ""Internet"" policies for public libraries. The wording in most assumes that the user understands the risk and the Library is not responsible for such things. Most policies I have seen state that there is an inherent risk in using public computers and the user assumes that risk. Of course, many libraries go to great lengths to ensure patron privacy (up to current laws, of course). However, no system is infallible and the libraries have to protect themselves from legal action. I have been a librarian/library sysadmin for 10 years.  But to answer your question more directly, yes, tablets with Internet connectivity should be wiped between users. User sessions are also purged on public computers."
Libraries,324bg9,akamarkman,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I really think we're doing an disservice to patrons by simply saying ""you're on your own!"" when it comes to public wifi. I don't think most people fully understand the inherent risks, or bother to read legal fine print when they're moments away from cat videos on YouTube :-P  Wiping systems between use makes sense but then I wonder about hardware hacks that make software protection irrelevant or simply circumventing the ""wiper"" software entirely. How often do librarians really check for things like that? Seems like it would be almost impossible to keep up with demand (which of course opens up a conversation about how probable an attack like that really is—maybe checking every X number of uses is enough)."

Your former supervisor will likely remember you in two years, but she might not recall how you went above and beyond on a particular project, found savings in the budget, acted in a more senior role for two months, etc. What you want to do is send that letter back to your former supervisor when you ask for that reference, to jog his/her memory."

In nearly every state school librarians must be certified teachers, so they fall under the same contract as the rest.

FWIW, once you're in the system as someone who has worked with them before, it's exponentially easier to get hired on for future positions there & other museums/etc in the area that strongly value the reputation of a place you might have done a short stint at.  As far as for-profit stuff, I have absolutely heard what you've heard about them being bad work environments & treat students poorly.

Especially since more people are winding up in the E.R's these days with weirder, sex-related injuries than they did before 50 Shades became popular. I'm not a public librarian, but I work in a law firm and I know the difference between researching law and practicing law. The BDSM thing is in a similar vein. In my humble opinion, I think librarians need to stick to our job (helping people find and evaluate information) and let the sex experts stick to theirs."

Showing movies in the library is a thing you have to buy a license for, for example, no matter how educational the movie may be.  Fair use is very complicated. You can use fair use as a defense after you've been sued, but you can't use it to prevent yourself from being sued. Extremely powerful media conglomerates (and Marvel is owned by Disney) are rapacious about copyright and even in a situation where you were unambiguously protected by fair use, it might be a thing where they sue you and then you don't have the resources to defend yourself. Disney has a known history of going after character murals in day cares, so I would err on the side of caution here. Why not contact independent comic artists who post their work online and see if you could get their permission for using their artwork? You don't HAVE to do boring generic stuff."

Libraries,31ryy6,ulotrichous,6,Tue Apr 7 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but no comics rightsholder is going to sue a library for infringement for using their images to promote the library.  It's not worth their time nor money, and the optics are terrible for them. Your admin are blowing smoke because your project makes them nervous.  This issue isn't about fair use, it's about your admin's anxiety.  If you were sued, you could absolutely make a fair use defense,  but it's up to the court to determine if the use was fair or not.  BUT, the issue is that what they are scared of has never happened.  There are no cases that I can find, or that ALA lists on their Copyright pages, where a rightsholder has sued a public library for using their imagery promotionally.   So yes, this could possibly happen.  But it could happen right now before you put up a single poster, for any reason, from any nutjob.  Litigation is a built-in risk any organization takes.  Your proposed actions here could only be said to definitively increase that risk if this has happened before.  Has anyone got any evidence of a public or school library being sued, or even shaken down, because of copyright infringment on promotional displays or materials?  From a risk mitigation perspective, even if what they are laying awake at night worrying about happens and a rightsholder notices your displays and is not happy about them, step 1 would be them telling you to take it down.  If you don't comply, that could encourage them to lawyer up, but if they don't send you a C&D first, no judge is going to be happy with them for not trying to resolve it out of court first.  TL;DR your admin is scared of a spectral copyright monster. Tons of libraries do this and none have been sued."

Can your ILS run reports of books that don't circ/were published before a certain date/etc? Will you personally evaluate each book before weeding it or not?   You might just need to experience. Run through the whole process, but only for a fraction of the collection. Follow every step, from compiling any lists to stamping withdrawn books.

You need to get documented buy-in from your superiors and be ready to openly and cordially explain the situation to parents, students, teachers, and other stakeholders. Find the cheapest solutions, talk to teachers about what they need from the collection, and ensure you can get it for them. Don't spend all your time or money just throwing the items out - you need to have a plan and the funds for building the collection back up.  tl;dr: weeding projects are vital, but if you don't handle the politics, you could get in trouble for throwing away books."

There are still many practical issues:  1) Leaving the desk is like leaving your toolbox behind.  If I have to help a patron with a rambling question, I usually start scribbling down all their clues on scrap paper before I do any searching.  I guess I could do that with a note-taking app, but then I'll have to be switching between apps.  2) Touchscreen keyboards and mobile browsers are not as versatile as fully-featured desktop versions.  If someone's looking for a book on X subject, I rapidly do a catalog search, middle-click on a bunch of entries to pull up their records, and start scrolling through the tabs.  Can't do that on a tablet, or not with much precision.  3) Wifi isn't reliable, especially if your building is old and was retrofitted for it in the last 20 years.  I work in a century-old building with lots of steel stacks.  It's just not practical to blast enough wifi so that every spine label can stream 1040p video.  4) When I'm at the desk waiting for patrons, I'm also getting a lot of other work done.  I'm reading blogs, working on projects, updating statistics or whatever.  If I absolutely had to be ""mobile"" I would probably get a decent, moderately priced tablet and use a remote desktop app to talk to my desktop PC.

But God forbid anyone admit that by requiring something as antiquated as synchronistic meetings.   As for the field itself, I love my job. But I am not convinced that a masters degree is necessary for an L1 position. Certificates, internships, apprenticeships, and hands on training would be way more beneficial for people just starting out in the field.   Edit to add: I agree 100% that there is value in theory. However, aside from about two or three classes, most classes I've taken are filler, and deal with what to expect in a specific type of library. Rather than require a 2-year master's degree, I think a semester's worth of theory and fundamentals classes, along with an additional period of job shadowing, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training would make for better librarians right out of the gate. It is one thing to take a class called ""public libraries"" and another to actually experience day-to-day life in a public library. The same goes for academic libraries, archives, etc.   In a perfect world, the 2-year master's degree would only have a hand full of actual academic classes (theories and fundamentals, management, cataloging, maybe preservation), and then a shit ton of short shadowing and training modules in different types of libraries. Of course, if someone chose to specialize, then perhaps you'd apprentice in one type of library rather than shadow a bunch of different ones. If you wanted to go a tech route, some of your classes/training would change. Either way, in a perfect world I believe that the road to an MLS would look a lot different than 48 credit hours and a graduate paper/test/portfolio/project."

My reference class, reader's advisory class, and my internship were really the only classes where I learned anything I could use on the job. While it's cool to say, ""Hey, I have a Master's degree!"" I totally support the degree being an undergrad degree with internship requirements."

I relocated across the country for library school, and I was nervous and anxious before classes started (would they be too hard for me? would I be the only one without extensive library experience? etc.). But after nearly two semesters, I am bored and unmotivated. I read some of my papers with professor's comments and can't believe that the work I've submitted is being awarded top marks in a graduate program.    Right now, I feel like the MLIS (or at least the program I am in) is uncomfortably trying to straddle the line between professional and academic degree.  Theoretical lectures/discussions are half-baked, and students rarely engage in critical or involved discussion.  At the same time, there isn't as strong an emphasis on practical experience or application of concepts as there could (should) be for a professional degree.  I also can't believe that SAA accreditation still isn't a thing."

My program is 100% online. I was able to take two classes in person my first semester...they are the same fucking two classes offered in person when classes are offered in person. Which means 42 of my 48 required credit hours have come from online classes."

Libraries,3178yw,snakesarecool,9,Fri Apr 24 15:43:34 2015 UTC,"Anyone going into the program just because they like books will have problems no matter what the job market is like.  For example, you don't go through a teaching program because ""Oh I just love kids!"".  Sure, loving kids helps you not want to ragequit every day, but loving children isn' the job.  Loving books isn't the job of a public librarian.  Providing information services and very often a social justice work is the job of a librarian.  Loving books can help this.  I do agree that LIS education should be either an undergraduate program or a graduate certificate.  Two year programs could be available for those who wanted to do more advanced training or technical work, but the length is often unnecessary for entry level library positions.  Applicants need to approach going to these programs as a business decision.  This is a professional program.  You are here to get a job.  View the program like that.  Go to a program that fits into the costs that you can afford, and the investment in tuition for a private school often isn't worth it.  Students need to enter into the programs with a plan and schools shouldn't admit them without one.  I've dealt with the usual ""WTF?"" looks when I say that I'm in a library program, but that's pretty normal for a lot of master's programs.  I haven't had anyone actively talk me out of attending.  That might be because I came in with specific jobs I wanted in mind and designed my program around that.  In the end I'll be coming out making 20% more than what I was making before I started the program.  I would not have entered into the program if the average pay and cost did not support that opportunity.    My career path choices within LIS were informed by looking at the salary information for the specializations and steering my interests to those positions capable of paying in a range that I was comfortable with.  Not everyone is interested in doing that, but everyone student should maintain realistic expectations.  Just because you land a job with the job title that you dreamed about while writing your application essay doesn't mean that it'll pay enough to support your household."
Libraries,3178yw,INTPLibrarian,7,Thu Apr 2 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"I am also one of the lucky ones who took a couple big risks and stumbled into a career that I love.  I guess my philosophy is that anyone can pretty much do anything they want career-wise, as long as they are willing to 1) work their butt off without recognition; 2) invest in education, internships, and other preparation; 3) move anywhere; 4) not make much money. If you're actually passionate about something, then you probably love it enough to make a feasible life plan. In that case, I'd say got for it! But if you're just halfheartedly interested in the library field because you like to read, then you might not be passionate enough to make the sacrifices that I listed above. And I would definitely discourage someone like that.  It's sort of like people who want to become fine artists, or medieval historians, or actors. It's not that it absolutely can't be done. It's just that you might not have as easy a time finding a job/getting paid as someone who became an actuary or something."

Then, if you still decide you want to get your library degree, do it part-time in an affordable online program. DO NOT waste your money at a private school  like the University of Chicago.

There are people who've come to me to ask my advice who want this job for the right reasons (as in, they know what the job is and want to do that kind of work, not because they love books or have and English BA and don't know what else to do). To them, I suggest online or in-state programs. If they have fulltime job prospects, I encourage them to work for a while, work their loans down if they have them, and then go into library science.  To those who are in the parenthetical situations of not knowing what else to do or mistakenly believing they'll get to read a lot and not deal with the public, I don't encourage them to pursue this.  I love my job. I get to do so many things I live and make a meaningful difference in my community, which is what I've always wanted to do. I am incredibly passionate about this work and have known this was what I needed in my life since high school. I don't want to prevent anyone from having that kind of fulfillment in their lives so no, I'm never going to outright tell everyone to not do this.

I just lay down truth.  About the job market, locally and across the board. About promotional prospects and expected roles. People seem to have this misconception - even people with other degrees - that library work is something you just get handed the moment you get a degree, not something that you basically have to win a lottery to even find part-time work in.  I tell them about the joys and experiences and value. About how much I love my job. And then I let the, know how unlikely it is they will even be where I am - barely employed and sometimes overworked in a job that pays pretty well in both money and fulfillment and that I will endure all sorts of shit to keep.  And let them know at the same time that LS isn't just learning how to shelve in Dewey and reading shittonnes of books. There is academic management. Statistics. Information Technology. Cataloguing and Circ software and competing cataloguing styles - that you may never need - that you have to understand anyway.  It often has the effect of disuading people, but that's not my intention.  The ones who are still interested after all that: They're the keepers and I encourage the hell out of them and give them my email address to ask me questions while they study."

I have been working as a paraprofessional since 1998 in various positions, which might work in my favor. I am now working as a metadata intern.   Whether I would recommend going to library school or not depends on the person and why they are interested in the field. I would definitely recommend they research the job market. I would also let them know that many of the librarians I have talked to say that some areas are saturated with candidates, and students have had to move out of those areas or states to find jobs."

It turns out my local schools hire people to be librarians if they just have demonstrated interest and know someone at the school. Of course, that also speaks to just how little school librarians are valued. Seemingly half the schools don't have libraries to begin with (mostly charter schools)."

Sometimes a library has a few Internet terminals. I'm in California where we've had 10 years of budget cuts and most schools are Title I (low income).  The other thing is that there's a variety of titles for librarians, which I expect have to do with their qualifications. Any of these titles could be a person who is managing a library alone.    Librarian  Library Aide   Library Tech  Library Clerk  Library Media Specialist  Library-Media and Reading Specialist Coordinator   Those are titles I grabbed from a county staff directory, just the ones found under 'L.'

However, he has been working as a library assistant for years and knows some people in the system.  He has a leg up in getting a job and as other people have mentioned, he is a man and a minority (big pluses).    Honestly, I wish someone had been real about the job prospects for librarians before I applied to library school.  I would've rethought my decision and probably tried to get a job in another field.

Local organizations like the YWCA might also be looking for volunteers to give story times, etc.   I second the portfolio of any programs, displays, fliers, etc. she has worked on. Also, when I went to a resume workshop, the librarian who advised said to list relevant workshops, conferences, memberships, and projects on my resume.

This may be because people stopped signing up multiple times to get the sign up prize, it maybe because online registration is more difficult than picking up a log and the people who do it are more dedicated to finishing the program, or for some other reason entirely. After having done an online only program for the last 6 years, this summer I am moving to a hybrid and offering paper logs and online registration. The online system is inflexible and expensive.

People can still do things the old way, but if they try out the online component and give us feedback they have a chance to win a basic kindle. You could try it this way so that you aren't committing the library to something patrons really dislike.   What is your budget like? there is RCApp from counting opinions and Evanced also offers a solution.   RCApp  Evanced  Disclaimer: RCapp isn't HORRIBLE and I suspect success is all in the execution. I have never used Evanced for summer reading.  Some things to consider: If people record their reading activity online, how will they get prizes (if you give them out)? How will you keep promoting it and circulation? How will you get them in the library when they just have to do something online? Probably other things to consider also.  Hope this is mildly helpful."

Libraries,311z5c,samurailibrarian,2,Thu Apr 2 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"Section 1. History of the Librarians of Congress of article  Librarian of Congress:       In 1802, two years after the creation of the Library of Congress, Thomas Jefferson appointed the very first Librarian of Congress. The law created in regards to this position gave the power of appointment to the President of the United States. It was not until 1897 that Congress was given the power to confirm the President’s nominee. This same law gave the Librarian the sole power for making the institution’s rules and appointing the Library’s staff.   There is no official term limit for the Librarian of Congress. Laws have been created regarding the appointment process, but no law indicates the term of office. However, in the twentieth century the precedent was established that Librarians of Congress are appointed for life. Therefore, most librarians have served until death or retirement.   Since there is no official term limit, most librarians have acted as the leader of the Library of Congress for extensive amounts of time, such as Herbert Putnam who served as the librarian for forty years. Therefore, Library of Congress has only experienced twelve Librarians and has “enjoyed a continuity of atmosphere and of policy that is rare in national institutions.”      Interesting: Library of Congress | Register of Copyrights | Archibald MacLeish | List of librarians   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

That said, the #1 thing I would recommend doing before library school is working (or at least volunteering a substantial amount) in libraries.  I would also recommend keeping a single substantial library job throughout library school. Build your course load around your job - the experience will be worth much more than any single class."
Libraries,311xz3,ergonaut,2,Wed Apr 1 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"thanks! i asked this on the library science thread a while ago, but I am hoping to work in a field that combines library science and international relations (I already have an MA in that) and am thinking this might mean less working in public/academic libraries and more for private libraries in research institutes and such things. I've had some trouble finding more information on this type of thing, but if that is my aim, are public/academic libraries a good way to still get experience in the field, and if not, how can I go about finding appropriate opportunities?"
Libraries,311xz3,ergonaut,2,Wed Apr 1 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"I can think of three possibilities for combining library science and international relations. Listed in order of accessibility: 1. Working in an academic library, as a liaison to the international relations department. 2. Working as a librarian for the government, possibly at an embassy. 3. Working as a librarian for a non-government organization or company that works in international relations.   If I were you, I would try to get a part-time job at an academic library. It doesn't matter so much what department, though reference would be ideal. I would apply to serve as a book reviewer or article referee for international relations journals. I would focus as projects in library school that I could on international relations.   While in library school, I would take on for-credit internships at an embassy, or some other organization that would let me work in international relations.  If you are unable to find an academic library job in library school, I would try to get a position at a public library. I don't think it's realistic to get a job in a special library or in an embassy as a librarian this early in your library school career.  I'd also look reach out to your local representative about doing an internship for him or her.  But seriously, having a library job through library school is vital."

Edit: I took this class many years ago and used it every time I gave a presentation, in class and at conferences, and even more I use it now when I present data to other departments or to upper admin.

Journals aren't prestigious because they contain the best fresh research presented in the most accessible way. Journals are prestigious because publishing in them gets you tenure and promotions.

Libraries,30ga8t,rndrson2,2,Fri Mar 27 03:01:06 2015 UTC,I catalog and tbh I mostly use the LoC MARC resource for pretty much everything as it's usually more convenient than a book and it's integrated into the program we use.  The other thing is the AACR2 and a small booklet thing that's basically MARC fields simplified.  Not sure what it's called and it's at work so I can't check.  :/  But it's definitely not on DACS level and would only be useful for the most basic cataloging.  My cataloging classes also used this book but it's not a MARC guide as much as a cataloging guide.

Libraries,30dvfk,jemlibrarian,3,Thu Mar 26 18:36:22 2015 UTC,I'm confused why they feel the need to have a state law for this when federal law already says that any library who receives federal funding must implement a web content filter for these things. It's part of CIPA.
Libraries,30dvfk,jemlibrarian,4,Thu Mar 26 18:39:05 2015 UTC,Because there are libraries which have rejected federal funding in order to avoid applying filters. This would extend the law to state funding/grants.
Libraries,30dvfk,jemlibrarian,2,Thu Mar 26 18:43:53 2015 UTC,At least in Pennsylvania we have to do it even if we don't get federal funding by means of the obscenity laws.

Libraries,306fwp,BookReadingRedneck,7,Tue Mar 24 22:43:53 2015 UTC,Talk with your library director and chief of police. At my library we are told not to confront situations like you have described.  Side note in the past we didn't have this policy and a staffer (who was obviously pregnant at the time) chased after a patron who bolted after setting off the alarm. He was caught eventually and I hope learned his lesson about stealing toilet paper.

Libraries,306fwp,emkay99,3,Wed Mar 25 03:14:31 2015 UTC,"In Pennsylvania theft from a library is a felony not sure about your state, video monitoring along with the fact that someone will know who they are most likely someone the police have dealt with before will prove to be a much more effective remedy than your employee winding up in jail because they didn't follow proper protocol for detaining someone or making a citizens arrest if they're legal in your state. Keep in mind that even with an alarm you need certain things to be true to make a stop 1. you must see the person select the item 2. you must see the person conceal said item 3. they must pass the last possible point to check out or purchase said item, if you lose sight of them even for a second don't stop them and if they are off your property you may not stop them. this gets very complicated if you're not a loss prevention professional let the police do their job."

Libraries,304xqq,muppetzinspace,3,Tue Mar 24 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with what the author is saying, but I'm having trouble getting over her use of the word ""algorithm"".   An algorithm is not ""a piece of computer code that makes a decision or recommendation"". It is ""a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer"" or ""a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed"".   It means we're following a set of steps. Long division, for example, is an algorithm.  I feel like she's making the word unnecessarily mystical."
Libraries,304xqq,QuietUser,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Algorithm:       In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (i/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ AL-gə-ri-dhəm) is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms exist that perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.  An algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time  and in a well-defined formal language  for calculating a function.  Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),  the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite  number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing ""output""  and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.   The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries, however a partial formalization of what would become the modern algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the ""decision problem"") posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define ""effective calculability""  or ""effective method"";  those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's ""Formulation 1"" of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939. Giving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion, remains a challenging problem.     Image i - Flow chart of an algorithm (Euclid's algorithm) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers a and b in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields ""yes"" (or true) (more accurately the number b in location B is greater than or equal to the number a in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number b − a replaces the old b). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).

Plus it blocks content I'd rather not see. For insistence, reddit would be horrible for me if there was not an algorithm modifying what i saw.   But I agree that the black boxing of how everything works is getting ridiculous. With many sites I am actively aware of the things I choose to block or make visible. But with things like Facebook and Google and YouTube and other sites these decisions are made without my awareness and if I do notice the changes it is either impossible or unnecessarily difficult to view an unfiltered list.   Just having the option to turn off that seeing would be all we need to fix this problem.

She's not a resident of Orland Park, so she would not have been allowed access to their computers without paying for access.  She actually lives in Mokena, south of Orland Park.    Also, the other significant red flag was the alleged rampant porn viewing.  I think most of us that work in libraries know see more people on facebook or playing games online than viewing porn.  I would think that viewing porn is something that most people would not want to be doing when their are other observers around because it is a very private activity by its nature.  Libraries are very public places with no expectation of privacy or intimacy.  I work in an academic library when there's a real and legitimate research need to view items on public terminals that could be deemed obscene by busybodies like Megan Fox.  My coworker said that he's only seen less than a handful of patrons viewing materials that could be called porn for non-academic research in the five years he's been employed.    I'm pretty sure that Ms. Fox could go through multiple magic markers drawing underwear and fig leaves on items with nude images in the open stacks.  I just hope that Orland Park giving in to her bullying doesn't encourage her to go after other libraries in the Chicago area, both public and academic.

This is a ""market segment"" that Rakuten is investing in. What exactly is the library's value proposition for digital content besides the fact that it's free? As Amazon and Rakuten/OverDrive/Kobo vie for the opportunity to push patrons into commercial stacks to discover, consume, rate, review and otherwise engage around their digital content, libraries will be increasingly left out in the cold for everything but saving patrons a few bucks to acquire the content in the first place ... voracious digital consumers don't ever even have to set foot in a public library but they get all the content for nothing and they read it in someone else's app or on someone else's device. Kindle delivered via Overdrive is great for library patrons because it's seamless. Kobo will no doubt strive to make reading Overdrive ePub titles more seamless by enabling cloud integration (a sticking point for many ePub consumers).   When the public funders of libraries look at the fact that increasing digital use essentially means directing patrons to use commercial ecosystems for reading, what then?  Full disclosure, I work for Bibliocommons, which provides a catalog discovery layer for Public libraries, but we as an organization have worked very hard to keep things library-centric, and encourage our library customers to challenge vendors who want to move the patron to a closed environment."

Our volunteers do things like straightening shelves, prepping crafts, washing toys and board books, shredding things, etc. Volunteers in good standing (I don't know how they determine this, but I think it's code for ""people we know and trust"") can help shelve and shelf-read.

Volunteers should be used in a way to help staff become more productive, not to serve as a substitute for actual staff.  Of course, you have to keep in mind the skill of the volunteer when giving them tasks.  I never truly realized just how terrible some people are at cutting until I started working with volunteers."

I agree 100% with this. Sometimes it's just hard to know where to draw the line. Like for us, there are xyz easy tasks that new staff are assigned to do. It's not until later in the game when they're totally comfortable with the easy stuff that we start giving staff the harder things to do. But our volunteers essentially do the same ""easy stuff"" that we give to new staff members (in my department) - so a new staff person & a new volunteer are doing essentially the same work. I'm sure if the volunteer committed to a solid 20+ hours a week and knew they wanted to volunteer for 1+ years to start, my boss would be totally fine moving them over to the harder stuff as well. At that point, they'd essential be doing ALL of the same work as the staff and supplanting rather than supplementing. The issue here is that I work for a small org & small nonprofits are always using volunteers this way. In many cases, they simply wouldn't be able to function without... but again, it still seems wrong or fishy or the lines or blurred.  My boss's philosophy is to treat them exactly like staff (and..cringe..""why pay them when they'll work for free?"") but clearly when something goes wrong or there are mandatory grant-funded projects that need to get done with deadlines and priorities, you can't hold an unpaid person to the same standards and expectations as someone who is getting paid to complete the work."

Volunteers mostly do either the leadership for special events (they read out loud for Spanish-language kids' storytime, or bring their trained therapy animal for events that promote literacy, etc etc) or they do very basic tasks with the collection (cleaning kids' books that got sticky, dusting shelves, etc.)   The only big crossover I can think of is that some higher-ups in the library system sometimes take volunteer positions for special events. For example, one of our program librarians plays ukelele and reads to toddlers at a weekly kids' storytime. But that's something she does for fun and it doesn't present any weird ethical issues like your situation.  Two years ago, they tried to get rid of the entry-level ""library aide"" position and just have volunteers do shelving, but the volume of shelving was so massive compared to the number of volunteers that it became impossible and they had to revert so that shelving and check-ins are done only by paid library aides (which are mostly college students.)  I can see where your work situation would make you feel undervalued, that really sucks. Do you think they are over-relying on volunteers because they lack the money to hire more official staff?"

Yes absolutely. There are some basic things that I think would be OK (teens doing a certain level of tech help supervised be a staff member, interns wanting to learn how cataloging works, etc).  But it is definitely the philosophy of my boss to say ""why pay them when they'll work for free?"" or to put out a call for volunteers when we have a large grant project that requires a lot more work to be done. And to treat volunteers as if they were staff (level of work they are doing) when clearly it's my responsibility when something goes wrong and my but on the line ensuring certain things get done.   We've had some great committeed volunteers. But there is a difference in someone doing this job to support themselves as their career and someone who just waltzers in when they have some free time and it would not really impact them if they were let go and has no professional interest in the work."

We have high school kids, some of whom have the skills and attention span to shelf-read and shelve, and some do not.   With most volunteers, I find it takes longer to plan, organize, train and supervise them than it takes me to do the job myself.

When a volunteer, especially a young volunteer walks in and requests to help out at the library it almost always means more work for me. It doesn't stop me from taking them on, but I do so knowing that most of the kids want a small amount of hours for the school's community service requirements, so by the time they're trained to be able to do a task on their own, they're done with the hours they need.  Typically we have them shelve, shelf-read, neaten the shelves, clean the DVDs, occasionally help prepare craft materials.  We have a lot of requests from random people to come in and lead our storytimes, or occasionally our baby sing alongs, and we turn them down. Too much planned structure and emphasis on early literacy that an untrained volunteer isn't likely to know or follow. Sadly we've had a few people take offense at being turned down, because they don't realize the amount of work we put into developing those programs.   There are a few exceptions to this, as we have some longterm volunteers who have excelled in more advanced roles. We have teens from the high school Tech Club come down and help patrons troubleshoot computer issues, which is wonderful. We also have a shelver I would hire full time if I had the power, but my library doesn't pay shelvers, sadly."

We've tried to make the qualifications more formal over the years because we spend a lot of time training volunteers just to have them either leave right away or realize we need to re-do all of their work anyway.  When you say you have volunteers that shelve books -- is this also a task that a paid employee does at your library?  For your volunteers who shelve books - do you generally give them all the same title? Or do you give the retired librarian the title of ""Volunteer Librarian"" (even though they're just shelving) and the high school student (who is also just shelving) just the title of ""Volunteer""? The job title issue has always been important to me simply because 1) I'm trying to make our organization function as professionally as possible and 2) yes, I too am trying to build my resume and always have my career in the back of my mind.   I had a volunteer once complain about the title we were giving them (It wasn't ""professional"" enough. They wanted a staff member's job title basically). I had to give in because my boss wanted this person to keep volunteering & doesn't care what titles people have."

For example, we have put up a brown paper tree on the wall, asked people to write something on the leaf, and tape it on/around the tree - spring is coming so a tree getting leaves again might be fun. People could write their favorite book or what they think of when they hear the word 'library'.  You could also have a trivia contest that would require people use the library resources to find the answers, ie. things that are not easily google-able. The prize could just be a $25 gift card to amazon.   What hidden gems do you have in the library, service wise, that you want people to know about?"

I get fines and shushing, but why is the organizational system something people traditionally don't like about libraries? Isn't that what defines libraries as a place for organized information?"
Libraries,2ze5u4,librarianzrock,3,Tue Mar 17 23:46:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to look at the organisation system you're using and ask if it's achieving what your patrons need. I like systems that hybridise Dewey with themes/categories. For example, Biography (or People if you prefer something broader). Those things wind up all over the place and in the public library I last worked in I found that customers hated that. We had a partial solution with a modified Dewey that pulled more of them into 920 than strictly correct but it was only half a solution."

This one also amuses me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeKtVD6ycPo  I've worked in an academic library too, though very, very early in my career. Different systems make sense with different purposes and user communities. I wouldn't suggest doing this to an academic library, it wouldn't be at all appropriate but in my experience, collection usage patterns and behaviours are very different so I have to look at the system of classification and ask if it's conducive to a positive user experience.  Hence why I like a hybrid system that uses broad themes but maintains Dewey within them. It keeps it easy to pinpoint specifics but suits the browsing style we see so much of. I've seen it be successful elsewhere but haven't had an opportunity to trial it."

They expect a library to be like a book store, and it's not."

Libraries,2zdrn9,samurailibrarian,14,Tue Mar 17 19:12:42 2015 UTC,"Our issue with porn on the public computers is that the people who do view it either don't do it discretely and/or they never clear their browser history and/or they save stuff to the computers. While our computers do dump things (thanks deepfreeze), they don't do it in-between patrons, but instead at the end of day (at best). So, that means that anyone else coming along behind a porn viewer runs the risk of stumbling into some highly questionable stuff.        So. No porn on the public computers. Period.   Now, on the other hand, if you bring in a computer you could look at whatever you want. As long as you're discreet. But our creative IT guy figured out a way to have the wifi system check for things and carry a filter. It's a filter that's a bit more relaxed than the one on the public computers, so it's also a bit easier to bypass, but it's something."

Libraries,2zdrn9,kakozlow,21,Tue Mar 17 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"We don't have a no porn policy where I work but we have a harassment policy.  If an adult is looking at porn in our adult computer lab and not doing anything else inappropriate or disturbing other patrons he/she can look at it.  However, if an adult is looking at porn in our adult computer lab and another patron sees it an complains, we will say something.  If we have to say something a second time they will be asked to leave for the day.  I think this is a good way to handle the situation.  I know for a fact that some of the patrons that come into where I work look at porn but they have never been overt about it and there has never been a complaint about it.  You may not agree with what they are watching but that is their preference and their right to access that information.  Libraries can get into a sticky situation when they decide to follow half of the Library Bill of Rights and not follow the other half."
Libraries,2zdrn9,PotatoDigger,-6,Tue Mar 17 21:52:51 2015 UTC,well I have a problem with the Library Bill of Rights here.   I don't think that we should let it slide and wait for other people to have to complain about it. Why should we put our patrons in that position?
Libraries,2zdrn9,_JackBlue,17,Tue Mar 17 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it is not necessarily fair to ""put patrons in that position,"" when you limit someone's access to information (even if it is porn) in favor of someone else's delicate sensibilities you are making a judgment of one person's needs being higher than someone else's. I think it is fair to allow access to anything until it is a disturbance to other patrons, but at that point that is when the library needs to step in. When I first started working for this library this particular policy was kind of surprising to me, but I was also grossly unaware of how many people don't have computer access at home and/or in a personal environment.   At my particular library adults are able to view porn so long as a.) children are not present in the vicinity around the computer it is being viewed on, b.) it is not in a children's area (aka not on the children's computers or visible in the Teen section), and/or c.) it doesn't bother other patrons using the library. Additionally, we treat violent videos/movies the same way. Whether someone is getting the shit kicked out of them, or fisted out of them, we take the same stance either way."

Libraries,2zdrn9,_JackBlue,10,Wed Mar 18 07:44:27 2015 UTC,"Hi Samurai,  I think that you should carefully rethink some of your assumptions about ""porn in the library"".  Assumption 1: Porn is illegal under state/federal law  False. Court decisions and statutes don't talk about pornography, they talk about obscenity. Materials are obscene if they appeal to a prurient interest, show patently offensive sexual conduct and lack serious artistic, literary, political, or scientific value based on local standards.  The ALA's position is that a librarian is not competent to make this legal determination. This is the province of lawyers and judges.   So, there definitely is a spectrum, its just that you, as a librarian, are completely unqualified to make it.  Assumption 2: Obscenity laws don't apply to books, only to images.  False. The Obscenity Prosecution Task Force recently shut down a text only website called Red Rose Stories. Not to mention that the Feds have banned books like Fanny Hill and numerous others based on obscenity statutes in the past.  Assumption 3: The right to a harassment free workplace trumps the rights of patrons to view materials.  False. Librarians have a professional obligation to allow the viewing of all materials since professional standards dictate that it is within their range of duties. Current professional standards, stated above say that we aren't competent to judge what obscenity is.  Further, as a public librarian, YOU ARE ACTING AS AN AGENT OF THE GOVERNMENT. Your actions are the governments actions. So if you misjudge what obscene materials are, you have opened your institution up to a lawsuit by the ACLU and others, that you are very likely to lose.  That said, if someone is acting in a harassing manner, lets say by telling offensive, dirty, or sexist jokes to staff members, you have every right to ask them to stop.  Hypothetical:  A patron is reading a copy of Playboy in the magazine section of the library. Do you tell him to stop?"

Libraries,2zdrn9,LibraryDiva,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"It goes a bit further than Elle, but not by that much. I was surprised when I first looked through an issue after always being told about its pornographic nature. No sexual organs - unless we're going to count breasts. No super close ups. Everything is also photographed very well, and actually seems pretty respectful as far as I can tell. Nothing overly explicit or demeaning in the magazine from a glance."

Libraries,2zdrn9,atinyradish,-4,Thu Mar 19 01:46:05 2015 UTC,would you read Playboy in front of your kid or your grandmother? Would you read it on a plane or at work on your lunch break?
Libraries,2zdrn9,Samanthamarcy,5,Thu Mar 19 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"Every single person out there who wants a book banned has a good reason. A perfectly sound reason in their mind as to why the world would be better off without that book.  What you see as porn could very well be just porn. But to someone else who jumps on your purity wagon, it could also mean sexual education materials, LGBT memoirs, our beloved 50 shades of grey, or any myriad of other things the delicate of the world find offensive. I'm not one for the ""slippery slope"" argument, but in this case, I'll use it.  Where will you, or those who feel as you do stop?  Your spectrum is when it becomes harassment. Who cares if someone is watching an erotic video on their computer? Is it bothering anyone? Are they being a buffoon about it? If not, then it's none of your business.   I also think, that if you're this passionate about censorship, that you may very well be in the wrong business. I'll wear the a-hole suit for saying it, but bleeding hell, I can not be the only one thinking it."
Libraries,2zdrn9,SafeLibraries,-1,Thu Mar 19 01:44:40 2015 UTC,It amazes me that every time you disagree with librarians someone has the fucking audacity to tell you that you shouldn't be in the profession.

The young woman who is trying to talk to her friends on facebook on the computer on the other side. The guy who is just out of the halfway house who is on the computer on the other side of the room who now thinks that if that is ok then it should be ok for him to watch insertion porn.

It's a common means of ad hominem argument designed to avoid discussing real issues at hand, whatever they may be.  If you are saying state and local laws require Internet porn be blocked from public libraries, then you are basically correct.  If you are saying the US Supreme Court ruled there's no First Amendment right to view Internet porn in public libraries, then you are basically correct.  If you think blocking porn from public libraries is censorship, then you are wrong.  It's called ""censorship"" to mislead people, but it's not censorship.

It is just one of these ""well someone MIGHT"" arguments."
Libraries,2zdrn9,Samanthamarcy,0,Wed Mar 18 05:48:56 2015 UTC,"How are you judging the research of others and what has given you the right to do so? I'm at an academic library as well as the above poster, and we also have a lot of pornographic materials in our files. Sometimes, people do research things. Other people are often interested in a certain topic that has been explored in pornography, or perhaps they are interested in a certain part of the pornographic industry, or who knows? I'm not here to judge their research. I can help them do it, or I can provide the information in some manner.  You might not have encountered someone using it for research purposes, but that does not mean it does not happen. And many scholars do not have sufficient funds to always make provisions - many scholars are poor students. Dealing with pornography usage in an academic library is, admittedly, much easier than in a public one. We have more private rooms typically or viewing spaces.   But you are very defensive about this. It almost feels as if you came here to seek validation and agreement on this topic and when the discussion did not go in your favor you began lashing out at everyone. You do not have to agree with us. That's completely fine. But lashing out at everyone and becoming defensive is not the best route. You can disagree without becoming so angered."

Fortunately, in New York, a public display of offensive sexual material is illegal and anyone allowing it's display runs afoul of the law.   See New York State Penal Code Section 245.10 and Section 245.11 Public display of offensive sexual material.   The law does ""not apply to the breastfeeding of infants or to any person entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment"" and applies to any public place ""accessible to members of the public without fee or other limit,"" such as schools and public libraries.  You might also be interested in this article in the NY Times from 2012 that focuses just on this issue.  As far as enforcing your rule, as long as it's well written, vetted by an attorney and board approved, and you've been given the explicit authority to enforce it, you're on solid ground."
Libraries,2zdrn9,Samanthamarcy,5,Tue Mar 17 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"huh, what is defined as offensive sexual material exactly? seems pretty vague to me.  what about comics and graphic novels with illustrates depictions? are patrons forced to read these materials only in their homes?  wouldn't something like a privacy screen make pornography viewed on screens not technically publicly displayed, and therefore okay to be viewed on library terminals?"

You cannot use government computers to view pornography in the presence of minors in this state, and I had to enforce that with a repeat offender patron. Since the incident, the library has adopted a visible no porn policy for library computers. Not sure about personal computers, but I would assume since it could be in the presence of minors, it would also be included in the no porn policy."

No we should not limit censor graphic novels because the person reading the book has chosen to read that book and there is much less chance for exposure to someone walking by.  Furthermore I don't know any libraries that stock hardcore porn in comic form either. Black Hole, Watchmen, League of Extrodinary Gentlemen, Dykes to Watch Out For, sure all of those, while they have adult content, are not pornographic materials. I don't know any library that stocks and circulates Omaha Cat Dancer, or even The Lost Girls for that matter."
Libraries,2zdrn9,littletamale,4,Wed Mar 18 08:05:51 2015 UTC,"I think the problem people are having with your argument is that it reeks of your own personal biases.  You draw the line at hardcover pornography in digital media format as being the limit of public offensiveness,  so you ban it,  but not things that you don't find offensive. There's a whole spectrum of people that public libraries are expected to service and support,  you need to be very careful that you aren't favourably biasing those who are ""like you"".

I don't have issue with Fifty Shades of Grey. It's not been given an R rating (certainly not here at least).

Libraries,2zdrn9,darthbiblia,9,Wed Mar 18 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"Freedom of speech. A lot of public libraries receive free or very discounted broadband connections, but they have to follow certain stipulations, one being providing unfiltered Internet access.   I agree with the need to provide safe spaces for Internet use. I'm not sure I want to go as far as the libraries who install privacy rooms for Internet access, but I do wonder what it says about our society that a bloody and gruesome first person shooter game is acceptable, while a topless female warrants suspension for the day. Like I said, I do not feel like we need to provide masturbation stations, but it's not up for us as librarians to judge the need to access pornographic material, because it IS a kind of information."
Libraries,2zdrn9,riverfaerie,13,Wed Mar 18 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, the discounted broadband, aka E-rate, REQUIRES filters under CIPA. Libraries who are offering unfiltered internet access, are paying MORE so that their patrons have full access to information.  My library doesn't ban porn outright, but we say that you cannot display on the screen anything that could reasonably be considered offensive or something like that. Basically, if someone tells us you are watching porn, we give you a warning. If you do it again, you have to leave for the day."
Libraries,2zdrn9,riverfaerie,6,Wed Mar 18 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"I should clarify--filters are required, as you cite, on children's computers. Adults are the opposite."

If you have a main computer lab that anyone can use, all of the computers have to be set to filter content. And as many others have said, the filters are pretty terrible. They will block sites that are not porn, and then adults wanting to do research or get information about sexual health will not be able to access that information. OR, they have to come up to the desk and ask for the filter to be removed so that they can find the information they need about a subject that is potentially embarrassing."
Libraries,2zdrn9,riverfaerie,0,Wed Mar 18 06:16:02 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand me. I am not at all in favor of filtering internet - it is censorship. You don't have to advocate for porn to advocate against filtering internet access. I am proud that my library system is committed to reducing barriers to service, and has budgeted for broadband access in order to avoid filtering. And our patrons appreciate that we treat them as adults and let them make their own decisions about what material is and is not appropriate to display in the library."

Libraries,2zdrn9,mybffndmyothrrddt,5,Thu Mar 19 15:36:11 2015 UTC,"I am not suggesting it does. I'm saying libraries need not stop the conversation at pornography because it is an information need and we're not the gatekeepers of what is and isn't acceptable. Keeping order and following social norms is in our purview, which is why alternate ways to access info that contains nudity/pornography/violence/ should be discussed."

I don't see porn as being an information need. I know people lump it in there and i just don't see the logic.   We can do whatever our institutions resources and our public deem best. What I have been arguing here is strictly patrons accessing graphic pornography in a manner that other library users and staff are forced to view it and engage in it.  There are tons of arguments in here about queer teens, and women's health, and research and that kind of thing. In my 14 years of working in public libraries this situation has always ALWAYS been men who are just sitting in the library watching porn."

Who are you to judge what an information need is? In public libraries, we do not censor. We provide information to the public even if certain things we provide to the public make other patrons uncomfortable. THAT is our job.  I personally, really don't like the uber religious man who comes in and asks me for help photocopying his hate speech towards the LGBTQ community. Should I just not help and kick him out because I don't agree with him?   I think Alan Moore's book Lost Girls doesn't really celebrate women as much as I would like. Should I ban it?  I also think 50 Shades really poorly depicts the BSDM community and is probably causing more harm than good. Should I delete from our collection? Should I get rid of the Twilight series because it's the worst writing I have seen in ages?  No.  My issue with your posts in this thread are because YOU have inserted your own opinion into this issue. ""I"" don't think porn is an information need. ""I"" don't think people should be exposed to possible porn.   WE have a duty, in a public library, to provide information to our patrons even if WE have an issue with said information."

Or what information is. If you are kicking out patrons left and right, it's time to ask the people who control your budget for privacy screens."
Libraries,2zdrn9,bookchaser,-6,Wed Mar 18 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"Because you are not ""subjected"" to anyone reading 50 Shakes of Grey. Nobody is reading it aloud and forcing you to listen, you are not being held down and forced to read the words on the page.  I never said that I was kicking people out left and right.  I don't think that privacy screens, and the additional cost involved in them, are the answer to a pretty simple issue of behavior in the library.  How do YOU get to decide that people should be forced to put up with a sexually hostile environment at the library?"
Libraries,2zdrn9,bookchaser,2,Wed Mar 18 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, actually we DO have patrons that read books aloud-- 50 shades included.

If you are working in public service as a woman you should not have to deal with guys who are looking at this stuff.

My biggest issue with your entire premise is that you are decided what is and what is not information and what is and what is not sexually hostile. This entire thread you have basically stated that YOU are correct in stating what is and what is not hardcore. I have caught patrons watching bestiality. That's hardcore. A woman f##king a horse is hard core. Two people f##king is sex. And even that, I wouldn't stand 100% behind because it's my OPINION. Sexually hostile environment is defined differently from state to state and in my state, what you describe is NOT a sexually hostile environment.   I agree that a public library is for everyone in the public. Everyone. Libraries have rules to ensure that everyone is able to use its services. That includes people accessing information I may personally disagree with. Yes, porn can be information whether you agree or not.

The library in question often has young immigrant moms with their young children. These aren't people who are all about sex positivity and already experience a world in which women are constantly on the defensive against male sexuality (street harassment, etc). So it seems that even a library can't be a safe space. I think it is more about male privilege under an easy banner of intellectual freedom. I find it interesting that your comments were so thoroughly downvoted. Even if one doesn't agree with them, you make valid points, and yet there is a such an injunction to not be puritanical that the other social issues aren't being addressed."

I have thrown A LOT of people out of the library for looking at porn in public and nobody has ever come back and sued me.

Second job (for-profit): Might have been filtered. Not sure--never became an issue.  Current job (gov't): filters. There were no filters but apparently there was a problem with the local homeless population coming in and using the library strictly for porn.

It's highly unlikely someone without a bachelor's would be hired for anything more than a page or volunteer position unless they already had years of proven experience."
Libraries,2z6m5u,bluebledthesea,7,Mon Mar 16 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"Depending on your library system, there's a slim chance they might have some positions above Page or Library Assistant that don't require a degree, but almost universally being a Librarian requires a Masters degree.  My system has a position they invented a few years ago called Library Technical Assistant that only requires an AA degree.  It's basically a cheap reference worker, where we man reference desks, provide technology assistance and teach computer-related classes.  But my system is also one of the most well funded in Florida with 25+ branches, so your mileage may vary."

It's just a Page position, but all I was really looking for was something that pays the bills for now. I'm actually loving my work in the stacks department though. For me, just being able to work in a library setting is awesome.  We have a good number of pages of all ages (hah), and most of the younger ones work on the weekends. I would say fill out an application at your nearest branch location and hope for the best. If you do happen to get a call it'll likely be for a page position, but it can be a great job if you're a patient person."

Libraries,2z6m5u,librarianzrock,3,Mon Mar 16 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"I live in NJ and in most libraries here, you can get a circulation desk position without a degree. I got my first library position when I was 21. It definitely pays more than being a page. Many libraries only hire high school students to be pages anyway, at least around here.  To work at the circ desk you have to demonstrate good customer service skills and in a lot of ways its like a very low stress retail position. You just check out books to people. Sometimes you file books, manage people's fines, unpack deliveries if you library participates in inter-library loans. In small libraries you can sometimes get tech services positions without a degree. That's like processing books with labels and stuff at a desk usually located in the back. But again this is usually only common in small libraries or else you need experience or a degree.   Good luck finding a library position!"
Libraries,2z6m5u,faburizu,2,Mon Mar 16 14:09:16 2015 UTC,"I guess our library system is unusual, but most of our employees don't have a degree in library science (though most of them have a bachelor's in one field or another.) we have a reference desk at our main branch downtown, they handle all the complex research questions. In our smaller branches (there are 10 total,) even the ""person in charge"" (or PIC- highest ranking person at the branch) usually does not have a degree in library science- though they can fulfill many of the duties a genuine librarian could. And they generally get to those positions by staying with the system for a long time.   For example, at the branch I most frequently work at, during most shifts the people working are: the PIC, one to two ""Library Assistant II""s (middling rank,) and two aides (usually college aged.) none of them have degrees certifying them as an actual librarian. And it's pretty rare we have to refer someone downtown, that's only for research projects that are super complicated.  So it really all depends on how your system is set up. In my experience it was pretty easy to get a job as a library aide when I was only in my third year of college."

It definitely depends on how big your library is and how many people use it, though. My library is in a major city, so there is always tons of work to do. Most of my time is spent shelving recently returned items, and occasionally I'm assigned to check in AV items (DVDs, CDs, audiobooks, video games), pull a list reserved items off the shelves, and assist at the help desk. On especially busy days, I come home with sore feet!  At my library, the volunteer positions are way more chill. They usually either check in books, make the shelves look tidy, or help out with special simple projects."

It's not impressive and it's presumptuous to submit a portfolio to a prospective employer unless they have specifically asked for a portfolio (and no one will). I don't have time to sift through your portfolio, looking for skills that might apply to the job I have posted. That's what your cover letter is for, to save me time. You tell me why your skills are exactly what I need for the job I'm hiring for.   I care about experience, judgment and curiosity. If you can't figure out how to get some experience doing actual information work for a real organization while doing your degree, I probably don't want to hire you. I prefer people who have drive and are resourceful. That being said, entry level jobs are such for a reason. I don't expect someone coming out of library school to have a ton of experience, but I expect them to have some experience (internships, volunteer work, assistant jobs are all fine). I've definitely seen my fair share of people who go for their MLIS right after undergrad and lack basic things like office etiquette.   I will google you. If things showing a lack of judgment come up, I probably don't want to hire you. I work for a politically-sensitive department. You need good judgment here.   I am impressed by skills listed on a resume that demonstrate curiosity, like learning coding skills or a programming language that are unlikely to have been taught as part of an MLIS program, or volunteering. I am also impressed when people make good use of personal websites or social media and can demonstrate they can actually write. Like making YouTube videos? Hey, chances are you'll be good at making tutorials and running webinars."

If you want to work as a children's librarian for example, you still need good judgment, you need some experience working with children and children's literature, and you probably won't get this experience directly through your program.

In terms of displaying skills that make you unique and showing off established work in libraries, I think that developing a portfolio that's readily accessible via web would be a great idea. However, if you look like the other candidates, it won't matter that much.   I'm halfway through my MLIS and I know that the portfolio will be required for my graduation.

I've never seen a candidate present a portfolio and we don't ask for examples of previous work (although we do ask candidates to give a presentation on a relevant topic of our choosing), but we'd be very glad if a candidate gave us one.   I also used to teach, and maintained a teaching portfolio that I'd first developed as one of the requirements for my undergraduate degree. It was always well received, and I think it's largely responsible for landing my first job."
Libraries,2z272c,OneEyeStrengthens,5,Sun Mar 15 11:39:55 2015 UTC,"For my school years ago, we did a research project + poster presentation as our culminating masters project.  It was a joke. What is your masters project besides making this portfolio?   I've been applying to tons of jobs for the past two years and have had many interviews at all sorts of libraries. Only once have I been asked to submit a portfolio of my work -- and that was supposed to be of my work in the field as a professional -- student work wouldn't have cut it.    If I did this, I wouldn't want it hosted on the university's website because I'd want full control over if after I left school & know that it would stay online. I had a website that I built for a class back in the day and we were told it would remain online after we graduated..to use to show potential employers. A year or so later I go to the URL because I wanted to show it to someone and it was down. Turns out the server had crashed and they had no backup of our work, and the one email notification about it they sent went to my spam folder.  You don't need this to be part of your masters program in order for you do to it, if you really want to do it. Anyone can make a website that shows off their resume and a list of their classes. Heck, that's already what linkedin IS.   I'd say most libraries want to know what you've actually done in a library though. That's why they stress so much that you need to find a part time job while you're in school, even if it means sacrificing your precious A for a B. No one cares that you got an A on your paper about desiging a library program. Have you actually implemented a real library program?"
Libraries,2z272c,TossAwayLibrarian,2,Sun Mar 15 05:12:14 2015 UTC,"This is my primary complaint with my program: rather than a self-directed research or service project, we're assigned to projects in groups as part of a ""capstone"" to the program. I'm not a fan, and would much rather use this as a chance to explore areas that I'm interested in, without being dependent on the classmates that happen to be in my group. I'm in the middle of my ""touchstone"" (halfway) course, and my group members care way less about our topic than I do, and it sucks for them and for me.  I get the feeling that the portfolio is mostly a tool that the faculty use to evaluate your time at the school, rather than help you get hired. Although, having project examples at the ready is useful, as a few others here have pointed out. And it's forcing me to rewrite my resume again, so it's not a complete exercise in futility."

I had to do a ""portfolio"" for my undergrad - everyone at the university did. It wasn't really part of our department or a huge deal or anything. But yes, everyone considered it an annoyance. Basically you had maybe 15 categories that you had to prove you did some work in and had to submit a paper you wrote for each category & write maybe 2 sentences why it fit. If you could logically claim that 1 paper fit all 15 categories, then you could upload the same paper 15 times. I can't image anyone actually looked through this and reread 15 papers to make sure we weren't bullshitting, which of course everyone was, for every student at the school ever year."
Libraries,2z272c,darkkn1te,3,Sun Mar 15 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"I would think if you have less experience, the portfolio will be more helpful for potential employers to determine if you're a good fit. The portfolio will show that you've done projects similar to the tasks you'll be doing as an employee if you haven't had the chance to do them at an actual paying job/internship.   I can't speak as an employer because even though I am a supervisor, I haven't had to hire anyone in my department yet. If someone included it on their resume, I'd definitely look at it though."

Kind of like a ""what I did for my summer vacation"" exercise. I didn't expect that employers would use them because they'd have to sift through a ton of content. Imagine getting 50 applicants for a job, each with a massive portfolio to look through. It would be ignored. Even if a candidate were being considered, there's probably not a lot that you could eek out of a portfolio that you wouldn't just get out of an interview. There's a disconnect between theory and practice too. Your example of leading a class being roughly analogous to teaching being an interesting point of this. I've done a lot of library programming (teaching) and no amount of seminars or presentations could have ever prepared me for it.   All that being said, I sympathize with your desire for some tangible proof that you're a competent person. I'm already getting overlooked for librarian positions because there are more over-qualified grads job-seeking than there are positions. It would be great if I could wield an online portfolio as the panacea to my job woes."

I'm not going to hit your site just because it's your site, except for possibly/probably when you're a finalist with a campus interview.   But if you've, say, built tutorials and things while you're in school, and that's one of the required or preferred qualifications for the posting? Yes, put a line in that says something like ""I have built tutorials for XYZ in my instructional design, and you can see examples of my project process and completed work in this area at blahblahblahdotcom"". Once you get me there, I'm likely to look around at the various other things in your portfolio.  I don't see a lot of value to portfolios as they have been implemented to date. I'm not opposed to the concept, but I think making them relevant to the job search process will also mean making other aspects of LIS programs more focused on that end, and with that beginning at the initial application process.

Scanning is free so we always check with people that they absolutely have to fax (which some places still require unfortunately). We didn't always have this service and people asked for it all the time, which is how we ended up getting these 2 or 3 years ago. It's pretty user-friendly, only drawback is that it's not set up to take a credit card (not sure if that's us or them) and our change machine will only take up to $10.

I've actually commented on something you posted awhile back (the one about getting a feel for how your previous job in education about you). I was looking through my comments section and thought to see how you were doing. I'm sure that sounds weird but I won't apologize. I am a teacher, and it is in my nature to help. I cannot easily forget about someone who reached out and is still struggling.   Most places won't reimburse if you don't ask. It allows them to save money. But then again, they might just suck.   With that said, I do not think you are worthless. It's super important that you realize your self worth and project that to potential employers. Workplace recruitment and retention psychology is a thriving industry. There are questions that employers can ask to sniff out a variety of issues.   It's possible that there is something small about your interview practices that you may need to tweak. It's hard to say.   The first thing I would do is address your self esteem and depression. I believe they are holding you back. Your resume is getting pulled and flagged for interviews. This is huge and you should absolutely be proud of this! Yes, this is super great!!!!  things that I would suggest: - Revisiting therapy/previously successful forms of treatment (even if the success was small, its still progress).  - I know you're unemployed there are MANY resources for low income mental health. Let me know if you need help. There are may places that have income based treatment plans (just like planned parenthood). Think of your mental health issues as diabetes. They both take maintenance and monitoring. They both are equally as important.  - Seek out a recruiter or head hunter. The concept sounds hokey and it takes awhile to find something, but they can be useful (if you get a good one)  - Find a temporary placement/staffing agency. They are also amazingly useful at finding you something that interests you and fits your background. Many places contract with staffing agencies and don't even bother putting through more traditional job searching means.  - the boomers who currently hold the positions you want can't work there forever. They're already starting to retire and libraries are a constant. I truly believe that you will find something. - Consider finding a Lean In Circle (Based off of the book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandburg). To some the book is cliche, and it is just a little bit. However, the women lead groups (called circles) based off of the books are dead useful tools. Networking and professional development at your own pace all at once. You might even be able to find a library science focused circle in your area. Or you can start one (Leadership skills, professional experience, resume power all in one). Networking is invaluable. Please also consider this option. Circles are welcoming - don't let your current situation keep you from amazing resources. Don't talk  yourself out of it.  - Find a support group for your depression/unemployed. They exist.   I can keep going, but I don't want to overwhelm you. I have more ideas but I don't know how receptive you are to hearing them.   I don't claim to know everything. What I do know is that I'm really good at asking the right questions and finding answers.  Feel free to PM me. Ask questions if you'd like. Keep me updated as much as you feel comfortable.   I truly think this is doable!   Let me know what I can do to help!"

There are well over 8 million books in my library. A list with that many entries is pointless. Librarians didn't invent catalogues for the fun of it. They did so because a list of more than a few dozen items is almost useless.   Make a list of what you want to read based on reviews and similar.

If any view results in action that infringes on another person's agency or rights, this is a problem, can fit that criteria (unless libelous). There will always be unpopular and morally questionable positions but I don't think that means we can construct truth by filtering information based on what popular opinion is. Certainly the evils of Hitler and the Third Reich were heinous, but people still study this as part of history. If someone Google's Hitler, I think Adolf Hilter should be a top result because of his place in history and not because his views were horrible.

But most libraries allow various forms of ID or proof of address.  A drivers license shouldn't be a requirement, not everyone can or does drive.  I'm sure you can find an alternate way to get a valid card.  Often a current utility bill can be used to show proof of address.

The only time a kid reads a series out of order is when he can't get the right book, or he guessed incorrectly which book to read because someone didn't help the kid by, oh, I dunno, numbering the books or posting a key next to where the books are displayed. Kids are super-focused on reading the next book in a series. They want to get the right book and will often wait, if needed, so they don't skip ahead in a series.  If the library wants to do the minimum amount of work, then post a small notice next to each book series listing the book titles in order."

Nowadays you have stuff like the Rick Riordan books - multiple series set in the same universe, and I'm sure he's not the only one doing it - and sometimes, like you said, the actual book number appears nowhere on it.

I've used one in my home for about 10 years, first for trains, then crafts, then Lego. I've seen preschools use them, and a local toy store has a permanent train table setup. I worried the melamine top would bow with time, but it hasn't so far. It has 18"" legs, and there are 24"" replacements sold if you need a taller table.  Edit: To add more info... the table is light, easy to move, easy to vacuum under. Pieces can fall off any table, so you're bending down no matter what. I wouldn't buy a table with drawers due to the pinching hazard for kids, and is there anything you're really going to store in a drawer (because patrons will just remove it)? More than likely, you'll glue the track down onto the table so it can't be moved, which only leaves trains as the components to worry about. Also consider whether you're buying solid wood, or particle board with a glued on finish that peels off over time (kids will help you with that). I'd avoid a table with wheels... very easy to move... for kids too."
Libraries,2yi4mc,bookchaser,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"personally i would recommend something like this for a few reasons.   one, you don't really want a conventional ""table"" on four legs with a bunch of space under it, because your aides (or whoever is tasked with cleaning the kids' room at closing) is going to have to crawl up under there to gather the many bits and pieces that fall underneath.   secondly, having the drawers underneath is perfect because you can store other toys and puzzles inside without wasting your valuable shelf space to store toys where you could store books.   and lastly, this one is on wheels, so whenever you have a storytime or craft event in the kids' room and you need to get your toys out of the way, it's easy to roll it out of the center of the room.  we don't have the EXACT table i linked, so i can't vouch for how long it would last, but we have one of a really similar build and it's been there for a few years and seems to be holding up okay.  hope this helps!"

Here's what I've done:   Weed the heck out of your reference collection and then integrate what you want to keep with your circulating non-fiction collection. Allowing everything to circulate makes it easier for patrons to use materials the way they want to use them, and it makes it easier for staff to track usage.  Stop buying encyclopedias and dictionaries and other similar materials. They're expensive, instantly out of date, difficult to house (they don't always fit on standard shelving), and don't get used enough. When purchasing popular non-fiction, I recommend buying items that are less than 350 pages long. People are more likely to pick up a non fiction book if it is short. Create themed displays. Make them attractive. Change them frequently. I did a display of ""For Dummies"" books once and it was very successful. Have fun. Visit schools to show students how to use your databases and other online tools. Offer and promote instruction sessions at the library. Link your physical collection with your digital collection. In each section put up signs that tells patrons what electronic resources you have on that topic. Expand your digital collection with excellent free resources. There are a lot.  For the blog, I would switch to Facebook. You'll be able to tell how many people are seeing your posts and you can easily post photos and videos. Video demonstrations are useful. Integrate your department with the technology department (if you have one) and give technology tutorials.   Good luck!"

The simple version is this: You can use the library space like any other patron. You cannot be loud, disruptive, or monopolize resources. (other have said this) However, our policy also states that you cannot receive money or sell product while on the premises - as I'm told it's a matter of image. We don't want to be seen as endorsing a particular business (or religious faith, or political party).   So, if you come in and need to use a computer or our wifi, fine. If you need to meet with someone to discuss business, fine (within the above limits). If you want to reserve the meeting room or our study room, fine (again, above limits).     We've had business seminars use our meeting room - everything from Avon to a local mortuary to a local back/spine doctor to a tax preparer to, yes, local Girl Scouts. As long as no one is selling a product or taking payments here, it's kosher.  The one problem patron I mentioned above, however, sees the library as his office (he pays taxes!) and constantly refers to the library staff as his secretaries (to people he's doing business with while standing right in front of us). He talks loudly on the phone. He expects an unlimited and unending supply of office supplies (staples, paperclips, free printing, free paper, free faxing). He's grown to accept that he's got to pay for printing and faxing, but damn it's been a struggle. He's also been a repeat offender when it comes to abusing his public computer privileges. He's a mess. But, he comes in about 4 days a week, so at least he's using what we do have. He just has to be constantly coached about not abusing it."

Write down the policy. You may need to run it by the library board before it can be enforced. If so, be prepared both to justify it and to give some preliminary documentation of why it's a problem; this could mean distinguishing between someone researching small business opportunities or filing their taxes from a library computer and your problem patron. Be prepared for a challenge from the Ron Swanson-esque member of the library board who believes that any interference from a government body in any type of business is bad. Enforce consistently. If you kick your patron out, he may hang around and eventually protest or even sue over the Girl Scouts selling cookies in the lobby, unless there's an exception for them (and maybe even then).  Document, if it comes to a lawsuit or protest to the board or even someone bellyaching to the local media during a slow news day."

I'm located in the midwestern US.   It's worth noting that most of the universities here DO arrange for practicums (sometimes called internships depending on the system) with local institutions, but the sort of internships I'm talking about above are usually posted on job boards alongside actual paying positions."

If you're able, taking on non-library positions, like research internships at think tanks that deal primarily with development, governance, reconstruction, stabilization, etc. might be helpful.

When it comes to working with international librarianship (if that is your end goal), your MLIS will be helpful depending on the position/organization, but your best opportunities are going to come from your own experience gained working in the library field. Your Peace Corps work should definitely count for something.   I also second to /u/me_gusta_perrito's advice to get lots of different types of experiences while you are in library school. This nets you experience on your resume, but also helps you figure out what you might like to do. If you're interested in international librarianship in any form, I would encourage you to get involved on library association committees. ALA's International Relations Round Table (http://www.ala.org/irrt/) is a very active group of LIS professionals from all areas of the field who have worked or are from all over the globe. If you get involved, network the heck out of those committees. You'll learn about opportunities and as things become available it does help for people to know who you are in this field.   To also tag onto the comment about the Gates Foundation: they have done a lot of amazing work for libraries around the globe, but announced last fall that they will be winding down their Global Libraries program in the next few years. As with other major NGOs, priorities change and this is common from what I understand. If there is anything open there, expect it to be extremely competitive.   Other organizations that might be of interest:  Room to Read: http://www.roomtoread.org/  READGlobal: http://readglobal.org/  International librarianship is a great place to be, and the colleagues and projects are second to none. Good luck working on your MLIS, and I hope you are able to find some fulfilling experiences!"

The first point we brought up was ""Who Are Customers?"".  The lesson was that a customer is anyone who depends on you for a service, and that everyone in the organization has customers, either internal or external.  In a library setting, the external customers would be the patrons, and the internal customers would be co-workers in your department, in other departments, in other libraries, etc.  This same mentality runs in the library where I work at now.  ""Customer Service"" is the first requirement for all positions, whether customer-facing (library assistants, community librarians, etc) or not (pages, management, etc).  In your position, your direct customers are internal customers, but they depend on you so that they can provide excellent service to their customers."

(And really, I can't think of a single job that doesn't involve providing a service!)  There is definitely a difference in the nature and mentality surrounding the customer service aspect in different types of libraries, but it's a vital component in all aspects of library work, especially in this time of decreasing budgets, when libraries are fighting for relevance in many situations."

In the same, I percieve that pretty much every job on the planet, unless you are a lottery winner, involves some degree of customer service. I do my best for library patrons because this is what keeps patrons coming back, and, respectively, keeps me in a job. Even if you cannot provide something for a patron, showing them that you have expended the effort is relationship building.  This civil servant term heavily features the word ""civil"" -- and many people who can legitimately use that term can do so because they are literally risking their lives as police officers, fire personnel, EMT's, military, etc. In that respect, I have to disagree with us as librarians being civil servants. Except for the fact that I work in a place where shootings could potentially happen, I've never thought that being a librarian included risking my life.   One last thing, as a civil servant, one is usually controlled by government/politics/powers that be. My responsibility as a librarian is to not respond to a particular political party or groups demands that I ban this book, purchase more of another type of material, particularly if it is not a regular user need, or make rules and restrictions to meet that party or group's demands.

To be honest, even though they get cleaned, the idea of public, shared headphones makes me squirm.  I know of other libraries that sell earbuds for $1, which eliminates the issue of germs, but of course, also means that patrons are out of luck if they don't happen to have cash on them.  Honestly, most people who care about headphone hygiene seem to just bring their own to the library with them."

It's possible that the library takes a financial loss on them but ensures that they're accounted for in the annual building supply budget as a public service.

I believe that the $1 earbuds are usually purchased through the library's Friends of the Library (FOL) budget.  So, the earbuds aren't necessarily purchased for the cost of a dollar, but there is room in the budget for them.  My assumption is that the $1 price tag is to encourage patrons to hang onto the set of headphones they bought rather than discarding them, so that they won't have to buy headphones the next time they visit the library."

It has always been a safe place for me with plenty to do during the day when the shelter kicks you out for a few hours. (It's even more important to be able to go to the library when you live in a rough neighborhood.)  It is a tremendous resource though, you can learn something if you want or surf the internet for a few hours.   I was a clean homeless person: not smelly, combed hair, clean clothes. (Still a clean person)  I think that me going to the library a lot (homeless or with a home) was just how I was raised though, books and learning were emphasized and encouraged by my parents (even if school stressed me out). I spent a lot of free time just hanging out reading books at the library as a kid."

It's 100% never been about the way someone looks, unless they're exposing themselves (which is a completely different, and criminal, situation). We do not care what you look like in our branch. Hell, half the time, we don't even care what you smell like, provided you follow the rules.  Unfortunately, people don't seem to ""get"" that sleeping, eating, and getting drunk in the library isn't an acceptable action, and usually get upset at the obvious outcome.  I'm here to help literally anyone who needs it, but if I can't stand within five feet of you without my eyes watering, it's time to go have a bath (or just go, sorry).  Edit to Add: It's clear that the homeless folks need someplace to go, and nobody at my location is begrudging them that, but really? Complaining you can't sleep in a branch? That's ridiculous - the library is there for EVERYONE. People who sleep in the branch are taking up space that others (who are awake) might use, and drive some patrons right back out the doors. Libraries cannot take the place of shelters, nor should they (IMO)."

Up to now I'm proud to say I think we at large have always been welcoming and helpful. This group just happens to be a bunch brought in by the weather who were pushing the line on dangerous behavior and had to be removed.
Libraries,2xpiwd,HistoricityLLC,0,Tue Mar 3 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"The libraries in California seem pretty good, not too much problems with the homeless.  I recently visited a library in Nevada and it was horrible.  It's been taken over by homeless, both bathrooms are totally destroyed, the stench is all over the place.  I know shelters exist that allow the homeless to keep basic hygiene.  They should not be allowed to enter if they smell.  I don't think using the library is a basic human right.  It is a privilege and if you are not contributing then you ought to utilize it primarily for improving yourself so that you can contribute in the future.  But my real problem is the sleeping.  Studies show naps can help with learning, and I find my best studying is done in 25 minute periods, with 5-10 minute breaks where I close my eyes and sometimes nap.  Sleep is the most important part of learning.  If someone is a teenager or clearly a student and not bothering anyone, they should be allowed to nap at the library.  That would go for young homeless people who are studying, too.  The library is a place to do particular things and short naps can be a part of that but using it as a home/bed is not.  I think we can trust librarians to make this distinction, but instead political correctness has broken down a system once again to arbitrary rules."
Libraries,2xpiwd,majormajorx2,-4,Thu Mar 12 20:26:10 2015 UTC,So what would happen if libraries made more effort with the homeless inside the building instead of ignoring them or trying to save them? Use the Ben Franklin effect and ask for a favor and empower them inside of the building. Too often efforts with the homeless try to engage them to in ways that don't appeal to the demographic and then expects them to empowered elsewhere...

Libraries,2xoi9w,muppetzinspace,2,Mon Mar 2 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"They had me until they said they especially need to serve charter schools. We're talking about a tool of the school privatization movement that typically involves reducing costs by eliminating unions and services -- like school libraries.  So we're starting a charity to serve schools that are crippled by design? Sigh. The system the government is working hard and fast to replace was a working system with functioning school libraries.  IMHO, parents who intentionally send their kids to charter schools instead of traditional public schools have made their bed and should now sleep in it. I'm sorry for the kids that their parents and politicians have screwed them over, but the much larger issue of the future of public education is at stake.  And worse, charter schools are statistically likely to not improve student achievement any better than the traditional public schools they're helping close. The leading indicators of student achievement remain the income and education level of the parents -- what happens in the home. Schools cannot fix the broken home lives of children. (Half of all Americans are now low income or living in poverty, and the cause isn't public education. It's economic policy that has decimated the middle class for the sake of an 87 cent spatula made overseas for slave wages and shipped over here on a massive barge for a 1 cent shipping cost.)

Perhaps the branch managers were all waiting on the new eligible list to be completed and these are a few positions that they've all been waiting to fill. You know how all that can take a lot of time with big systems. They're all part time - no chance of 1 person covering two part time shifts at 2 locations to equal full time. They're also on the same side of the county, so maybe they do group interviews section by section. Who knows.

Not sure about the city taxes, but the state of Colorado may have to refund the money due to a weird rule in the state constitution.   When they propose a new tax, they have to estimate how much it will raise, and how much the state needs to function.   Pot sales raised less money than expected, so they were off on that number. The state also made more money than it needed due primarily to oil and gas. Since it was wrong on both (but only needed to be wrong on one), they have to refund the tax they raised.   It's a weird situation and I believe the state is going to ask voters to let them keep it. I doubt that'll pass, for the obvious reason of people liking money,  so the only money that could go to libraries above previous funding would be city taxes.
