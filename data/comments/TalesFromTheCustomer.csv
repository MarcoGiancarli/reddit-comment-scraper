Yeah. No. I would want to see the aftermath."

I was with a table. Oh sorry I'll get the rest of you order as soon as i refill the drink station with cups. Had another manager lecture me on how i needed to upkeep my station because some kid had stomped on chips and there were crumbs. I was about to do it, but was refilling empty drinks so i could have possibly 5 uninterrupted minutes to sweep rather than sweep get a table refill. sweep get called by another table needing a refill.

We even ordered our food based on who was working the grill. We started going there when we were dating, didn't tell anyone there we were getting married, but they comp'd our meal and brought us desert the next time we went in.   This town has a huge auction once a month that brings in people from all over. This restaurant is a favorite for people from out of town. Occasionally we would forget that it was auction weekend and people would be waiting for tables. Every time that happened, the waitresses would recognize us and tell us they were clearing a table for our ""reservation""."

As soon as she sees caller ID and I verify the address for her, she says ""Oh Carrie, how are you? I give you chicken dumplings, ok? Say hi to your husband for me!""   Now I make my husband do the ordering, because I become ""socially awkward penguin"" making small talk with her.   I still have to do something about the delivery guys. Apparently I overtip, because one of the guys told me that when we order, all the guys argue about who gets to be the one delivering.  So they always feel the need to stay and chat when they drop off the food.  Not only am I bad at small talk, and I just want to take the food and eat, they all have heavy accents, and I can barely understand what they're saying."

She was really a nice person and always patient and friendly.

Cashier simply would not stop trying to get me to join their paid customer loyalty program.  I finally told him to take the large stack of books I had been trying to purchase (probably close to $1,000 worth of computer and engineering books - stuff I was trying to replace after losing the first set in a house fire) and put them where the sun don't shine.  Never shopped in one of their stores again after that."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,eldergeekprime,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:07:56 2015 UTC,"If you had that much in books, then it's likely you WOULD have saved.  Even a paid loyalty program doesn't have a large cost to enroll, and the savings adds up quickly.  I know that even a small percent on such a large purchase would have likely paid for the program, and left you with a smaller balance.  You probably would have ended up paying far more than you needed to, if you had purchased the books without that program."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,bluja000,15,Wed Jul 15 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"The point is though, I was not interested and said so, four times, before I walked out. The cashier should have respected my choice and dropped it."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,sensualaustralians,3,Sat Jul 18 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"I understand this. I really truly do, and I know it's not the employees fault that their chain or whatever doesn't want to institute a policy to get rewards members without resorting to harassment. Unfortunately, in those environments, if you don't make an unreasonable quota, you can be disciplined."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,slowaschalk,2,Sat Jul 18 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"People can even be terminated. I'm grateful that I don't have to deal with anything like that, although I did have to push credit cards. Thankfully the credit card apps have slowed down and it's clear that everyone who wanted one has gotten one, so I've stopped asking. But between April and the middle of July, we had to ask. Three and a half months. Ugh."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,slowaschalk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who worked at a popular game store. She was required, by policy, to ask if you wanted to enroll in their loyalty program at least three times during your transaction, regardless of whether or not you said no the first time. Often, she had a manager standing behind her making sure she adhered to this ridiculous policy. She had several people do what OP did and get frustrated and leave. The best option in this situation is to call corporate and complain about the policy, I think. It's likely that employee HAD to annoy the crap out of you as part of their job, unfortunately. Corporate is often a better place to start with these complaints."

I don't care how much management wants you to sell the damned loyalty club memberships, management did not instruct you to badger and annoy the customers relentlessly, and if they did, perhaps you should look for a job with a company that actually knows how to earn customer loyalty.  Chances are, they'll be around longer and you'll have a job longer."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,eldergeekprime,4,Sat Jul 18 14:45:25 2015 UTC,"management did not instruct you to badger and annoy the customers relentlessly,   This isn't exactly true.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,missdespair,-3,Sun Jul 19 05:09:33 2015 UTC,"Okay. Regardless, people are sometimes instructed to badger the customers. It's not right, but it's the way it is, and keeping your job is more important than a stranger you'll probably never see again. They don't like doing it any more than you like hearing it, and trust me, customers getting irate at you sucks just as much if not more than being asked something multiple times.  I don't understand why it's so hard to just be nice. People are struggling to keep their jobs, people are losing their jobs, the economy is in the toilet, people are fighting just to survive. I don't get why it's so hard to be nice and understanding about it. You act like they're killing your firstborn or something. Get a grip."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,sensualaustralians,3,Sat Jul 18 15:04:48 2015 UTC,"""Being nice"" works two ways. Badgering me relentlessly and not taking ""no"" for an answer do not qualify."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,joepie91,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"Second point: someone has to work those jobs. Someone will be trying to push things on customers. It makes no sense to blame the person who doesn't make the rules but only follows them. Want to be mad at someone? Blame their management who told them to push store cards and upsell.  In summary: don't get pissed at and blame store associates just doing their jobs. It's stupid. Someone will always have to take crap jobs that have pushing store cards and promotions as part of the job. Why not treat them with respect? They're human beings and probably not rolling in the dough. Just graciously decline, as many times as necessary, and move the fuck on with your life."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,sensualaustralians,3,Sat Jul 18 22:16:19 2015 UTC,"You act like they're killing your firstborn or something.   Exaggerate much?  I don't see any dead bodies on the floor with multiple gunshot wounds, so obviously I did not act that way.  Telling the cashier to stop, and then walking out when they refuse to, does not constitute acting ""like they're killing your firstborn"".  As for being nice to them, I was.  I did not yell, did not punch them in the mouth to make them shut up, did not do any of those extreme anti-social things that society so frowns upon.  Instead, I took my business elsewhere."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,eldergeekprime,3,Sat Jul 18 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"Enrolling in the program typically means giving them personal information, which they then correlate with your purchases and then sell.  Many people don't like to have their privacy invaded this way.  Of course, if it's just for a one-time purchase, you might consider signing up with false information...  I vaguely recall one grocery store that absolutely insisted on membership, and I put down my street address as ""26 Via Merde de Caballo""."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ddccy,o0shad0o,13,Thu Jul 16 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"I see situations like that as often caused by bullcrap management. Too often managers will put pressure on sales associates to get x loyalty members per day or face discipline. Granted, there is usually a higher level of management somewhere shouting at the low level management, but it's still an issue of management not caring about the customers but about credit card apps and loyalty members. Its amazing how aggressive those sales plans can be."

I told him if he signed up for the card (which is just first name, last name, postal code - completely FREE) he could save $60. I did ask him more than once if he was sure and he kept brushing it off. I was definitely more pushy than normal but I was truly amazed someone wouldn't take that offer, I've had people sign up to save $0.60 let alone $60!"

Apparently the ""supervisor"" lied to me and actually scheduled an in-home call that I needed to be there for.   Turns out last night's calls were both to the Philipines.   Today, I got San Diego (I am in LA) based support, and they were the ones who handled and fixed it. Call went far better today."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,heilspawn,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:48 2015 UTC,"Good to hear you got it sorted.  Most overseas tech calls I've never had a problem with, generally very polite ppl. Most of the times know their stuff quite well.  However, once had a lady inform me that an exchange from my ISP was out in xxxx suburb. Which was cool to know... but it was move than 50km away from my suburb and the local exchange...  Some you win, some you lose."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,jimmahdean,2,Wed Jul 15 02:12:50 2015 UTC,"This is what bugs me the most about them. There seems to be no form of internal communication. I'll talk to one person, they'll say one thing. I talk to another, they say another. When a tech visits my house, they're annoyed that the problem could've been fixed in a minute instead of 15 if they were just told the information from previous calls.  Got a technician visiting today to somehow ""fix"" my internet connection (when the issue is ""the modem just shuts off and resets randomly, losing connection to their server""). Not sure what he's going to do other than tell me exactly that.  Best part is right after a call is scheduled, I get an obviously-outside-of-the-country call from someone saying ""we've worked on your issue externally we'll cancel your tech appointment now unless you stop me from hanging up saying you don't want to okay bye."""
TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,DeadlyVoltages,5,Wed Jul 15 11:55:48 2015 UTC,I had the opposite problem. After a storm there was an outage and the cable to my house was broken (it was laying on the ground) after my neighbors got their service back I called Comcast who insisted it was an outage and they had no reason to send anyone out.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,Matraxia,3,Wed Jul 15 02:05:26 2015 UTC,"I had this problem too. I had my network restricted for a DMCA violation and the three times I called them, I got people who just said it was an outage, even though my modem said I was restricted. It took me like a week to get someone on the phone who knew what they were talking about and fixed it in two minutes."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,DeadlyVoltages,13,Wed Jul 15 15:13:41 2015 UTC,Some people deserve to be yelled at. There's no way she should be refusing to let you talk to a supervisor. Glad things are being worked out now.

Hahaha did you even think about what you were saying?  Anyway, I don't agree with you and that doesn't make me a ""terrible excuse for a human being."" What kind of weak fool are you to consider the opinion that ""some people deserve to be yelled at"" to be a sign that someone is completely awful? There are many more worse things than that, it's not even on the top 100 list of terrible opinions people can have, lol."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,mrrp,4,Wed Jul 15 02:42:22 2015 UTC,Never say never.  Sometimes it literally is the only way to get through to some people.   People that have that smug attitude that will keep defying you out of spite until threatened with violence.   You gotta do what you gotta do.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,palfas,3,Wed Jul 15 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"I've been known to(admittedly rarely) shout at people who are being absurd as a method of startling them out of their current train of thought.  The first word or two being sharply emphasized with volume usually is enough to get people to stop and pay attention for at least a moment. From my experience, that moment is usually enough for people to realize that they're being stupid and start listening to sense.  It's a method I very rarely use, but it does seem to work when I do use it."

She told me that there are TWO different screens showing outages. The one the drone can access from their seat only shows some outages. There is another screen that they have to get their asses up out of their chair and walk over to look at that shows ALL outages.. She said most other reps would simply say there was no outage if they didnt see it on the ""local"" one rather than getting up and checking the other screen. My home isp is this same company and we had one outage where BOTH tv AND internet were out, and the drone kept insisting there was no outage, so I specifcally ASKED them to check the other screen and sure enough, it showed up there.. Drone wanted to know how I knew about the other screen, as I called it by its internal name (don't recall what that was any more...)... Just laughed and I have friends at your office..."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3dal89,aeonofeveau,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"Lol  Guy in the San Diego office told me he could see our house had issues, as did several adjacent homes.

Not this one. Sad part is it sounded like when the manager said ""The guy obviously knows about his car"", that he was punishing the guy for trying to fuck over a knowledgeable customer rather than an easy-to-fool one."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d9ldl,Polygonic,6,Tue Jul 14 16:55:38 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't know many people who would drop 3k on repairs without a second thought.   Maybe I just know too many poor people
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d9ldl,DVeagle74,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"a lot of these shops look for people who 'don't know jack' about cars, single females, elderly, etc, and upsell, upsell, upsell anything they can get away with.   An older lady friend of mine noted that if a woman alone wears a wedding ring while taking a car to the shop, she gets treated a lot differently than if she isn't wearing a ring. She actually tested this theory with her van and getting quotes from a couple different shops for some work. She's not married, and is 50+, and if she wasn't wearing a ring the price was easily 20% higher than if she wore a ring, pretending to be married. She laughed, and said from now on when she has to take her car to the shop she's going to wear a ring, calling it her ""invisible pe***"" aka ""token male"".  I myself can talk car terminology as well as or better than most guys, and can do things up to moderate level repairs myself... so if it's something I have to take it to a shop for... you bet I know my apples from my onions!   Shops hate me because they can't b.s. me...and I'll decline all the upsell crap.   As someone else said, finding a local, non-chain, honest mechanic, who will just fix what's broke and nothing else, isn't that easy anymore."

Today, at my work, someone came in off the street (didn't call in the order) and ordered 50 hamburgers, 50 cheeseburgers, 3 large burgers and 100 fries.   I love that phrase though, I'm going to start using it when people at my job panic over small things."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d168k,kittypaloosa,17,Sun Jul 12 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"I think all the trends that worked there went to high school together, so they probably have a lot of banter back and forth.  Plus, this chain restaurant is in a little town, so large orders are a little rare.  Add in that is getting close to closing, I don't blame the guy one bit, but it was a great end to a fun day."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d168k,ImaginarySpider,6,Sun Jul 12 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"We once had someone try to feed a whole hospital staff from our store. They had their entire system or server go down or something that morning so everyone in the hospital was working their asses off to fix things and keep the hospital running. So to keep moral up they bought everyone lunch. We got out as much as we could but only were able to get about 75% of what they wanted on such short notice, but they were super grateful for even that."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d168k,jimmahdean,3,Mon Jul 13 07:38:23 2015 UTC,"Did they do it 45 minutes before close, though?  That's what I assume he's freaking out about. The deli where I worked had to be out at 9, when the deli closed. There were often days where you'd get customers coming up at 8:45 and order a few pounds of meat, causing them to be late due to having to re-clean a bunch of things and getting yelled at the next day."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d168k,shadowkillerx7,13,Mon Jul 13 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"Ah I still remember when I was young and had a LAN party with my friends.  We went to the local Fastfood Shop and ordered 20 Burger of the same kind. The cashier: "" You will have to wait a moment, we don't have that many ready at a time, is it ok with you if we serve the next customer in line?""  And of course it was fine, we stepped aside to make room and she asked them about their order. Dead serious look in the customers eyes he steps forward and says: ""I'll have 10 of [same burger than us], please!""  Her face went from trained smile to shocked to desperation in around 5 seconds, then the customer bursted out in laughter and we all couldn't resist but to join in.  I will never forget that, such an amazingly funny reaction from her haha"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d168k,DBuckFactory,5,Mon Jul 13 05:31:38 2015 UTC,"He probably freaked a bit because they didn't have all of that stuff ready that close to closing and they probably were short staffed that late as well.  They also may have already started closing duties to get out earlier.  Not a huge deal, obviously."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3d168k,SiberianH,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:38:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can be a pain working the night shift. Cleaned everything and you are just waiting for that last five minutes so you can close up and go home? Too bad, dirty your station in order to prepare this order for this person, or even a group of people, that came in at the very last minute because you can't turn down the customer.  Obviously, there's no excuse to be openly rude to customers by voicing your annoyance, especially when this person still had 45 minutes until they closed. He should definitely get out of the horrible, soul destroying fast food business ASAP if he hates his job so much."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3cwk7p,Sm00chie,2,Sat Jul 11 12:24:13 2015 UTC,Perhaps it is company policy to never discuss packages and such over email.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cwk7p,sandiercy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:33:35 2015 UTC,Potentially because emails can go back and forth and is more time consuming for the agent dealing with it rather than on the phone where the can deal with further questions/objections in real time.  I don't work in sales but have at times called someone rather than discuss over email as it's quicker (a 5 minute phone call can achieve more than 10 back and forth emails) and there is far less room for misunderstanding.  However if someone specifically requested that they would rather handle something via email I wouldn't start suggesting phone calls.

He had to get it rekeyed (he lost his), and the only dealership was like 75 miles away, so he had to have it towed. I drove him him down to the dealership a couple of hours later, and they tried to charge him an extra $250 because the only place the flatbed could put the car was in the middle of their little repair lot, and they had to roll it literally ten feet into the garage. $250.  So he called Audi and told them what happened. Audi called the dealership right then and said that was absolutely ridiculous, and if they hear about more things like that, they would pull that location's license (it was an Audi/BMW/Mercedes, iirc).  But I would definitely email corporate. That's dangerous to turn away someone with a freaking bolt in their tire! Screw those guys."

That never happened to you? You know in a minute or two in a fitting room?  I don't really think any company would deny that return--if a customer is unhappy with a new purchase, most companies would jump at the opportunity to provide an amazing customer service experience. But that may be more an American consumer experience than anything.  This is a high end gear company. Customer service is included in the high price. You pay a lot at Nordstrom. You also get a whole host of ancillary services. It's billed into the price.  Just saying. But thanks for the input. I did learn something in this whole ordeal."

Bought the new pair because I loved the old pair that much. Wore them for half a day and realized that while the waist fit, the overall fit of the shorts are weird and no good. Had I tried them on in store, I would not have realized this anyway. Most stores in the US would take them back (e.g. Macy's, REI, Nike, Gap, etc.). I couldn't make it up to Canada again and appealed to the manufacturer for some great customer service. It was a good opportunity for them to look great, but instead they'd rather take the point of view of...the rest of the world."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3cvmgx,redditforcash,-9,Sat Jul 11 10:59:31 2015 UTC,"Formal? No. Casual, totes! Look, my take on this thing is it's a $90 pair of shorts. I have a previous pair and I love them. I wear them very, very often. I saw the opportunity to own another pair and to me, knowing the amount of use I'm getting out of the first pair, it was well worth it to me. So I jumped on it. Problem is, the waist fits fine. I would have bought them even if I'd tried them on. You don't throw stuff into your pockets in a fitting room. You don't really know how a garment will fit trying it for a couple minutes in a fitting room. You'll know if the waist is too small of too big.  Apparently, they were down to help until they found out I tossed the sales tag. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a premium brand balking over a sales tag? That certainly wouldn't happen with an American company--I don't think (no jingoism). I've had my issues with a couple of Canadian companies (and I certainly don't think this is a Canadian thing, I think it's an American thing: I'm guessing the takeaway is that American companies have a more lenient and open policy on customer service). It must be way easier in the US to return/exchange things? This would never be issue with Patagonia, Keen, LL Bean, New Balance, Nike and countless other companies I've done business with. Someone mentioned entitled. Maybe. I will rethink my consumerism. Maybe it really is time to not buy anything anymore (only when I absolutely must). I will certainly consider my purchases and who I'm purchasing from very deliberately from now on."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cvmgx,redditforcash,7,Sat Jul 11 16:27:18 2015 UTC,Perhaps if you favour such American brands that are more leniant on return policies then perhaps you should stick with American companies?

I helped her sort through to see what did and did not have cheese, and even her ticket said 'no cheese'  So no, you are not in the wrong.

They won't hit 100%, no one can, but they need to try. Maybe the manager is just not very good in the kitchen but had to fill in. Just let them know and be nice about it. If they screw up again another day then go harder. You mess my order up 3 or more times then I'm pissed."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3chd4b,gothiclgal,11,Tue Jul 7 22:35:36 2015 UTC,The cashier was out of line. Just earlier today I was grocery shopping and the customer in front of us forgot a bag. The cashier asked the bagger to run the bag out to the lady. He couldn't spot her because there were 4 ladies in the parking lot and the cashier forgot what the lady was wearing.  She came back in for her bag after that.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,Patoonyah91,12,Mon Jul 6 23:32:32 2015 UTC,Most pharmacies only ask for ID for controlled substances. I take klonopin and I have to show ID when dropping off the RX and 10 minutes later I have to show ID again to pick it up.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,SpaceEdge,7,Tue Jul 7 02:42:30 2015 UTC,"I'm also on Klonopin an have only ever had to show ID when picking it up.  I can have friends pick it up but they have to show ID and state their relationship to me.  One friend came by with my meds and said, ""OK, so I'm your girlfriend now.""  Another friend said, ""Well, I'm officially your caretaker, as far as [pharmacy] is concerned.""    Technically neither were neighbors but neighbor is an option. And my friends are goofballs.    Oh, and by the way, everywhere asks for ID for pseudoephedrine now.  Not the ""PE"" stuff, but the other.  People use it to make meth, I guess.  Used to irritate me a little but now I can't even take pseudoephedrine so not a big deal."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,SpastixFantastix,2,Tue Jul 7 03:15:02 2015 UTC,Hmmm that's interesting I live in NY and they are very strict with Rx's. Usually I just swing by the pharmacy on my way home from the doctors and they fill my meds within 15 mins. I go to a small mom and pop pharmacy maybe the show your ID twice is their rule.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,SpaceEdge,3,Tue Jul 7 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"Most of my meds are submitted by computer now, from my doctor's office.  I don't have a car so unless I can borrow a car or bum a ride, I ask others to pick them up for me."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,SpaceEdge,2,Tue Jul 7 03:35:26 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting. I live in Chicago and not once have I had to show anything to pick up my Klonopin or my Ativan.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,catroaring,-8,Tue Jul 7 19:32:12 2015 UTC,Or he was trying to buy medicine that he needed and did not have an I.D.  In the U.S. some pharmacies require I.D. for certain purchases (pseudoephedrine comes to mind).  No offense but you might be the asshole in this situation laughing about a man not getting medicine he needs.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,catroaring,-14,Tue Jul 7 03:36:23 2015 UTC,In my opinion laughing at someone that can not get medicine because of a lack of i.d. is a asshole.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,catroaring,6,Tue Jul 7 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"yeh, I have no idea what you're saying I did wrong. Never did I brag about my ""worry-free"" life, nor did I belittle the homeless. My post is about someone trying to make me do something illegal, not something that will help the homeless in the long run. I mean would you give him your ID with the pharmacist watching? That's pretty stupid and you would definitely end up in jail. Also, I don't see where the rude sarcasm is coming from. I haven't said anything hostile or insulting towards you. :/ I'm sorry if describing the subject of my story as homeless offends you, but I'm not going to censor myself just so I don't hurt your baby boo boo feelings."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,catroaring,2,Tue Jul 7 05:34:11 2015 UTC,"Oh stop it.  For one thing, OP may have just laughed because of the social settings and because she was only focused on the idea of a man posing as a woman and asking for an ID right in front of the pharmacist.   Secondly, I don't always consider circumstances when I'm put in an awkward position, like being asked for my ID from a stranger. If I were in that same situation I'd likely laugh awkwardly with the pharmacist and only later realize that the homeless man might have been in a tough spot.   Don't act as if you always see the right option in every situation. No one is perfect."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3cd1ss,Meterus,5,Tue Jul 7 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you! You described exactly what I experienced. Also, the person on here saying they would give the man their ID is ridiculous. Anyone in my situation would have reacted the same way I did."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,RoseStillHasThorns,17,Thu Jul 2 11:44:23 2015 UTC,I once went to a pet store. I was a young teen and wanted a special lamp for my pet turtle. They didnt have all the material i needed so cashier called boss who said to give it to me for half off. The cashier didnt know how to find out the price. So i showed her on the calculator. Damn if that didnt show me the value of math irl.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,preciousjewel128,31,Thu Jul 2 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of my old assistant manager. She was like ""Look how much alcohol is in this drink!"" (I think it was a Four Loko). ""It says there's 8% alcohol and the serving size is 4oz. So its a 24oz can so theres 40 percent alcohol in the whole thing!"".  I tried to correct her but she just wasn't getting it.  She's awesome but has her moments like that where I just have to wonder."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,flappity,24,Thu Jul 2 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"Similar thinking which applies to gambling: if I flip a penny nine times and get nine tales, the odds of flip 10 being tails must be quite good.  Wrong. The odds of flip 10 being tails are 50 - 50, just like every other flip. Nine tales in a row is statistically rare but not impossible; yet has no bearing on the outcome of flip 10."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,IAMA_dragon-AMA,2,Thu Jul 2 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"Ha! Like one of my co-workers after I worked at a convenience store for a couple of months, the boss told everyone they had to balance the books at the end of their shifts. So, lady before me says ""I would have balanced the books, but I couldn't figure out how to do 36 nickels on the adding machine"". Without pausing, I looked at her, and said ""the answer's 180 ($1.80, I know)""."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,Meterus,2,Fri Jul 3 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"4oz servings in a 24oz bottle means there are 6 servings. 6 times 8 is 48. It was 48% alcohol, not 40.  Duh."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,sappy16,7,Thu Jul 2 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of a time I went to a stationery shop and bought stuff totalling something like £15.20. I gave the guy £20 and he punched it into the till before I realised that I also had a 20p coin, so I gave him that as well.  He looked at the money for a few seconds and then just went ""I don't know how much change to give you now""."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,pfafulous,8,Thu Jul 2 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, even simple transactions can really freeze you up if you (a) interrupt your lizard brain muscle memory, and (b) have to do it in front of somebody else. I'm good at math, but when I've had to do transactions I can normally do instantly in my head, I've gone completely blank in such situations."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,layzpcofcrap,2,Fri Jul 3 05:47:07 2015 UTC,Yeah but this kind of transaction is super common in retail.  People usually want back paper instead of a bunch of coins.   The one that really gets people here is something like $9.78 and you hand them a $10 bill and 3 cents so you can get a quarter back.  Quarters being good for laundry and such.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,pfafulous,2,Tue Jul 7 08:47:31 2015 UTC,"For sure, but that doesn't mean it can't trip someone up.  It has nothing to do with intelligence. Rather, it has to do with the lizard brain. When you do something all the time, it becomes automatic. You stop consciously thinking about it, and muscle memory takes over. It's the whole routine, from pressing the buttons to taking the money to giving the change to grabbing the receipt,,. the whole thing is done without thinking.  When you interrupt that to require actual though, then the brain is startled and has to play catchup. It's like you've been riding down the road on cruise control and someone suddenly downshifted you into first gear.   Also remember that tricking cashiers with adding money and changing the transaction is how quick-change artists operate. So now you have to reevaluate everything to triple-check that it's right.  And all the while you're doing this, you have an impatient cashier treating you like an idiot for not realizing that 22c plus 3c equals 25c.  Just saying, cut the cashier some slack."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3buu1y,layzpcofcrap,3,Tue Jul 7 16:51:45 2015 UTC,"Oh I get it.  I dont' think cashiers who get stuck on these things are dumb, and I am perfectly patient and kind.  These days I'll even give them everything and clearly say 'can I get a quarter back please' just so I'm not dumping it on them to figure out why the extra coins.  Recently, though, I even had a situation where the total was like $30.42 and I handed over two 20s and 42 cents, and the guy was utterly baffled.  I don't mean a few seconds, I mean he asked a coworker for help and then started counting out singles.  I told him politely I just needed a 10 back and he looked unsure.  Come on.  Even then, I didn't roll my eyes or act like he was dumb, I'm not mean.  And yeah I know about the quick change scams.  I give everything up front and know better than to try some ""oh wait let me give you a hurr so I can get a durr back"" thing.  That's not cool and we all know why.  It is a bit disappointing, no?  I mean, we routinely override our lizard brains on demand or we couldn't even function in society.  There are clearly people in every job who challenge themselves and there are others (including managers) that don't give a crap and can't be bothered if it isn't utterly trivial.  The rise of the auto change machines and a huge % of people just swiping for every purchase has only made this worse."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3bt42e,Throwaway_of_pain,0,Thu Jul 2 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"I remember that story. Obviously super-embellished, but an entertaining read nevertheless."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3bt42e,V2Blast,12,Mon Jul 6 09:51:09 2015 UTC,"Sometimes parent supervision doesn't even help.  Today we came across a 3-4 year old girl playing with our patio firepits. They were inside,  on display and not turned on - parents must have thought it was all fine. They stood about 5-10 metres away and it was kind of hard to identify who parents even were.  These firepits are filled with glass beads,  some are perfectly smooth,  other styles are quite rough and jagged with some sharp edges. Despite the managers efforts at explaining how dangerous small pieces of glass are for a child,  parents didn't care,  ""we're watching her"". Well,  they weren't watching when she threw pieces of glass up in the air to rain down on her,  or when she picked pieces up off the ground and put them in her mouth."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3bt42e,PinkAvocados,9,Thu Jul 2 06:47:26 2015 UTC,That employee has probably been screamed at by parents many times for trying to tell their precious little angels to behave. Sometimes I don't bother dealing with the problems either because inevitably a mother will scream at me because she's complete trash and shouldn't be allowed to have kids.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3bt42e,DeadlyVoltages,3,Thu Jul 2 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"I have worked in the toy department at a retail chain and management gave us no authority to actually deal with anything. We could request someone stop and then watch them laugh at us and go back to what they were doing. Generally I ended up cleaning up their mess. Only management could actually intervene, and they were often busy and unresponsive. I fully understand an employee not donning a cape and springing into action."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3bt42e,danatblair,0,Mon Jul 13 02:20:16 2015 UTC,So the employees would rather let kids trash the store than endure some idiot woman's yelling? This seems backwards

TalesFromTheCustomer,3br19j,exoxe,21,Wed Jul 1 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"I arrived at a conference that had power strips with a breaker under lock and key. If you exceeded 500 watts the breaker would trip and you would have to pay $100 to reset it. Tripped the breaker, quickly ran across the aisle and swapped it for another person's power strip.  According to the contract we were supposed to pay union electricians $200 an hour to plug in things to the power strip, but they weren't too strict on enforcing that."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3br19j,mail323,37,Wed Jul 1 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"My husband was drafted to be on-site 24-hr tech support for a bunch of visiting VIPS, so he stayed at the hotel with them.  A MAJOR international chain, which did a lot of business stuff - I saw at least 2 massive groups of suits gathering in the lobby when I visited.  His company had rented out rooms for them to stay in (at a minimum of $300 each per night) and reserved a conference room on their business event floor.  First was a flat fee of something like $5,000 for the ""deluxe"" business package.  It included use of a conference room, which was advertised as having a projector screen for presentations. But no projector. He had to load up a cart at work and bring it to the hotel with lots of equipment, including a projector. It also included breakfast for the 10 VIPs every day.  The breakfast was basic continental style - coffee and donuts. For that, they charged something like $700 a day.  Then they get there and find out there's no wifi - free or otherwise.  You have to plug into their LAN ports - at $100 per person per day.  He also had to run out to a nearby store and buy a printer.  They didn't even include the use of a printer!"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3br19j,carriegood,8,Wed Jul 1 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"I would make an epic stink about that. Write it up and send it to various executives at the hotel chain, then on Yelp, TripAdvisor etc. You would be surprised how concerned some hotels are about their reputations.  Yelp is jsut a warning shot though. Businesses pay Yelp to control their reviews. I have seen many disreputable businesses with all the negative reviews retired to ""other"" and not counting on their score."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3br19j,win32ce,5,Fri Jul 3 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"The person who arranged it was not IT, so he didn't know what was missing.  If he did, he probably would have been able to negotiate better.  It's more like ""shame on him"" for signing a contract that didn't do what they needed. And it ended up with my husband getting raves from the VIPs and his superiors for overcoming the shortfalls.  Still doesn't excuse ridiculous prices for a woefully inadequate service. They'll know better next time."

Is this changing the terms of the contract? Can you book another conference room in a nearby hotel and use that conference room instead? Can you move the whole group to the hotel?   This shit pisses me off.  Fuck them. If I could, I would move my entire business away from their hotel and made sure the manager knew why. I would still email the hotel manager and ask them for help in this matter, if you can not make the changes.

To be fair on the plugging in charges by union members, having worked in union houses while doing stage work for theater, we had a lot of houses we weren't allowed to plug our own gear into.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3br19j,win32ce,2,Thu Jul 2 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"I was the ""training unit leader"" for a little event that we hold every year. We happened to hold it in conjunction with another conference at a hotel in downtown (State Capital). We needed to split one of the rooms, as it was far larger than we needed, and we actually needed 2 separate rooms in order to hold all of the seminars that were scheduled.   I asked for a second ""set-up"" consisting of a 4'x6' screen, a power cable and a monitor cable so that I could just add a laptop and projector in the second room (the first was already set).   The AV guy said $800. I looked at him as if he was from a different planet, and told him no."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3br19j,Sir_Nameless,2,Fri Jul 3 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"(1) Everything in any contract is negotiable.  You just don't close the deal until you're done negotiating, and you often have to kick it up past the ""this is standard"" guy you deal with at first.  (2) B2B is its own universe that has no comparison to retail.  People arent generally spending their own money, and agency costs (switching brands) can be high.  For example if the conference hotel has a great view and staff and food, and you've been burned by another one before with terrible service like they weren't even ready for your meeting when you arrived.  So places that are good tend to gouge like this.  I've organized meetings and it is the #1 headache, finding quality without the crazy prices.  (3) Often places have been burned by previous customers being idiots or greedy themselves.  ""We're going to demo our 5kW furnaces all day"".  I've seen crazier.  Running your own cords is out for many cities as you quickly get into fire code problems.  And yeah union issues.  Sometimes you just go 'we're not having meetings in this town ever again'."

In most cases servers are not allowed to leave unless all their tables are gone.  Say the server has been there since 10:30am is going to get off for a quick lunch and has to be back on the clock for dinner.   So, if you wish to continue setting up camp at least tip higher then 20%, because you never know whats going on inside the restaurant."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3bwwm4,hoIIie,12,Fri Jul 3 12:51:15 2015 UTC,If you left when the lunch rush was subsiding that means you were eating and then camping out during the lunch rush.

If they are slammed and other customers waiting for a seat, then yeah it can be rude to everyone involved to just sit there.  If the place is slow then whatever.  Having a meal in a restaurant shouldn't be ""wolf down your food then GTFO, we need that table!"".  Its a balance.  I will definitely spend more (and tip well) at places where I don't feel like I am being rushed.  Your waitress should have at least pulled the ""do you need anything else?"" and aggressive plate clearing rather than stare at you hoping you are psychic though, that was rude on her part."

I guess that wasn't cool, but the restaurant wasn't busy at all and the establishment is open 24/7.  On the flip side, I was getting Chinese take-out a few years ago when a major storm (including several tornadoes) hit the city. I saw the clouds go black and went back into the restaurant. I didn't explain what was going on and the hostess (looking rather pissed) said I could stay, until the storm was over.

With mine I can set deal criteria, however if the item comes from a different vendor or belongs to a different class it won't allow me to split the deal without ringing in a second qualifying item and then doing an inventory adjustment on the item which actually left.   Because we have to manually change database numbers, we actually really don't like splitting deals,  it leave a lot of room for error."

Yeah, it would have been nice to have given the customer the deal he didn't qualify for, but you just can't be nice to everyone without causing problems - with future customers, with inventory, with head office. I'd rather say no to a customer than have them come back again and again saying, ""but last time..."" or having head office question why I keep creating deals that don't actually exist."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3bn52v,amariesha,0,Tue Jun 30 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"That's the exact attitude that creates the entitled customer who makes a fuss about everything.  If anything, you should be rewarding the customer who's not making a stink."

Most of the time, the cashier saw it coming in and would scan it first or the bag boy (there was always at least one skulking around, looking for something to bag or take out to the car) would notice it and quietly point it out to the cashier.  That and most of the time, the cart goes behind the cashier, not in the customer's lane. This is to prevent it from being clogged with carts. You either let the kid go around the cashier or took the kid out. (Not like the cashier can run off with the kid.)  Even if the cart went into the customer's lane, any time there was a neighboring cashier, they could always catch those items.  So yeah, we had it pretty much covered where I worked."

After about forty minutes of trying to get the attention of our waiter without being rude, he came back, took the basket with salt, pepper and different sauces, said he was ""just going to give this to another table, then come back"". He delivered the basket to the next table and disappeared.   Why didn't he have enough baskets prepared for each table?   He let another couple pay for their meal, walked towards us, took a 180 to chat with another table after which he finally made it to us, only to disappear to the next table over (they waived at him) before we got our bill. While we were paying he went back to the second table, sat down and talked to them, went over to the computer to fiddle with the music play list before he came back with a pen so we could sign the receipt and finally get out of there.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3b5hkg,ERIFNOMI,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The not looking at him while reading the menu and yelling about it could have made OP speak to a manager but there was no need to do what he did. Poor guy could have had anything happen that morning, sick family member or anything. He's a human not a god damn robot  Sorry OP, going against the grain here but I think you're the asshole"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b5hkg,signpostlake,4,Fri Jun 26 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but since he was in the drive through, the cashier is used to just talking into a headset to talk to people. I'm sure he just didn't realize it was hard to hear him. Then OP calls him an asshole. I'm sure OP was less than great to deal with up to this point as well. He says he confronts them about the endlessly broken pussy-drink machine like he was making a joke out of it or something, but even without hearing how he said it, I'd take it as someone bitching about something that's out of my control while I'm trying to do right by them. I'd have been pissed off by that point. But that's why I don't work these kinds of jobs."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3b5hkg,signpostlake,-2,Fri Jun 26 21:52:22 2015 UTC,Really. And who orders a frappe in the morning?
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b5hkg,ChiliFlake,6,Fri Jun 26 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"Him, for sure. Yes, you were clearly agitated, but you kept your cool up until he yelled at you. And then swearing? No no no.  I used to work at (what I assume is) the same fast food joint. It was almost impossible to get fired, but screaming obsenities at a customer would definitely do it.  I do feel a bit bad for him; that job was hell for me, and I'm sure the manager had just been yelling at him for letting you order the frappe to begin with. So his nerves were probably frayed, but you pretty much need to be already dead inside to handle fast food (that, or extremely thick-skinned).  I think getting fired will actually be a positive thing for him, he clearly can't handle the stress of fast food (I sure couldn't. I still work in retail, but at a store where my managers are nice and don't blame me for everything.)"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b5hkg,KirbyFurbyLirbyDerby,12,Fri Jun 26 04:23:11 2015 UTC,"The thing that tips it over the edge for me is when the cashier tries to start a physical fight. That right there is beyond the write them up stage, and is actually bordering ""call the cops because you were assaulted"" territory.  So while neither side comes up looking like an angel, the Cashier was definitely more in the wrong."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b5hkg,Dracomax,4,Fri Jun 26 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"Well he shouted at you because you asked him to repeat himself, which means, ""speak louder,"" and not, ""I forgot already, read it off again at the exact same volume while facing away from me."" For all he knew you were hard of hearing, and getting frustrated is no reason to shout at someone. Yeah calling him an asshole didn't help, but he was being an asshole by shouting at you.  The guy obviously has a short temper and bad judgment, seeing as he tried to physically intimidate a customer in the middle of his workplace.  Don't feel bad about it, he did this to himself."

I had time to rent a car and then hit and ATM for some American money. I stopped at Ronald's little burger joint and paid with one of the twenties that I had just taken out of the machine. The girl insisted I paid with a ten. The manger got involved and I explained that not only did I only have twenties fresh from the machine, they were so new and stuck together that I spent the five minutes that I waited to pay crumpling up the bills to make sure that I didn't give her two of them. The manager made me wait while they did a quick count on the drawer and then gave me the extra ten that they found.   If she had said that I tried to pay with Yen I would have believed her, but not a ten I knew that I couldn't possibly have."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,leveraction1970,10,Thu Jun 25 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what I do when a customer makes that complaint.

That to say, I'd give her the benefit of the doubt and she was hoping the manager would take responsibility for the cash discrepancy at the end of the day if there was one.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,caitylinny,8,Thu Jun 25 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a smart idea! When she argued with me my first thought was to tell her to get someone to check the cameras, because I really didn't want anyone thinking I was trying to steal from them, but then remembered that the $20 bill I gave her was folded and likely wouldn't have been discernible on film. Oh well. Hope her shift got better!"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,littlewoolie,8,Thu Jun 25 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"The usual procedure is for the manager to close down the register and count the till.  It's slow going, but it's a good way to discern who is really at fault where the camera can't show what happened."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,ijon_cbo,3,Fri Jun 26 05:18:02 2015 UTC,German cashier standard procedure is to put the money from the customer in his sight but out of reach or to keep it in hand until the customer accepted the change. Only then should the money from the customer be put away.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,scubahana,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:39:38 2015 UTC,What I picked up in my years at a register was to say out loud what money I was given. '$20.' And when returning back I would the. Indicate the change. 'And $3.22 is your change.' If it were larger bills I would also keep one hand out and holding the money in view of the customer and ring up single-handedly (why do you need two hands to punch in the amount and 'Tender' anyway?) or keep it on the counter if that's how it was presented to me.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,Bjorn2bMild,3,Fri Jun 26 05:06:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't feel too bad, there is a good chance she was trying to scam you out of the $15 so she could pocket it. If that was the case and if she was smart then she put the money back so her drawer came out even. Never feel sorry for making sure the bill or the change is correct, it's a lot harder to try and figure it out after the fact than it is to take a minute and review it while it's happening."

Highly doubtful.  It's a pretty common scam trick when customers hand you a ten and say they handed you a twenty, it makes the cashier flustered and question what really happened and possibly give them back ten dollars extra in order to make the customer happy."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3b43bu,Bjorn2bMild,3,Fri Jun 26 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"There are two was the cashier can scam money, by not ringing things in and keeping the money ( not possible in most food situations or with modern registers ) and shorting change. This lady must have entered $5 as payment received into her register otherwise the receipt would have shown the correct change. I once had an employee that I had to stop giving register shifts to because she was dyslexic and three different times she took a $20 and gave change for a $50 so switching 2s and 5s is certainly possible. But the fact that she didn't try to look at the bills or do anything but insist on her version of things makes me suspicious.  The only time I've ever encountered a change scam from the customer was one time when my bartender was tricked into giving to much change by a fast talker who made a lot of changes on him ( oh I just found this bill give that one back so the change will be so and so, wait I want smaller bills so give x, x, and x...etc ) and that was when the carnival was in town so it was an actual professional grifter."

The whole place had a kind of off smell to it. We were the only customers.  We took some seats next to the wall, which looked like it was a breeding ground for insects. Tons of ants, flies, and other winged bugs were crawling all over this wall.  The food wasn't so great either. The burrito was really sloppy, and turned a deep purple halfway through.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,Aperson3334,67,Mon Jun 22 06:23:02 2015 UTC,Did you report the second incident to the police?  Best wishes regarding your grandfather.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,Ding_batman,23,Mon Jun 22 08:07:42 2015 UTC,Call the police and cancel your card. This person could be doing the same to others who weren't lucky enough to notice.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,Lunchables,17,Mon Jun 22 13:37:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would have called the police and then called my bank to cancel the card and give them the name of the place that allowed this."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,awhq,27,Mon Jun 22 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"Your dad needs to cancel that card and report what he observed. In the US all you need is the front for the # and expiration date, on the back the confirmation # (3 digits) That wouldn't even take 10 seconds to grab a shot of both for some idiot to go to town. So glad you folks saw her do that. Sheesh.  Gosh sorry you both had to deal with that. Pretty sure your grandfather was happy for the visit, though :)"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,Jintess,5,Mon Jun 22 12:30:23 2015 UTC,Looks like OP said the card was cancelled as soon as they got home.    But 100% agree that the police need to be involved.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,VanTil,11,Mon Jun 22 19:17:28 2015 UTC,I do hope you cancelled the card and filed a police complaint before heading over to Reddit...
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,Hank_Kapenkie,5,Mon Jun 22 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"You...should seriously report that incident to the police. If that person does it once, she will do it again to some other poor soul. Also, see if you can call the higher ups of that place. This is seriously not okay."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,BeautifulPhantom,3,Mon Jun 22 22:41:09 2015 UTC,Who the heck would take a pic of a debit card. That is beyond innaproprite into likely fraud. I really can't think of any good legit reason to do it. if hte machine is down I could see using those ancient carbon paper slips if one was nearby but taking a pic is just not even close to acceptable.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,danatblair,3,Thu Jun 25 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"Debit card or credit card? In Canada, it is a separate thing where debit cards have chip and pin technology so almost impossible to use if you just have the number off the front. With credit cards (like visa or mastercard) it is definitely possible to use the number."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,sandiercy,16,Mon Jun 22 07:21:45 2015 UTC,Unless it's something like a visa debit where you can use it online just like a credit card.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,NotWiddershins,6,Mon Jun 22 07:27:17 2015 UTC,"Debit card, but I'm from the US, so it's used the same way as a credit card."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,DeadMachineStds,2,Mon Jun 22 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian I find that weird. Seems insecure to use a debit card that way for all your transactions, since your chances of getting ripped off are much higher."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,LadyA052,2,Sat Jun 27 06:14:35 2015 UTC,"At least online, that's how it works. In stores, you swipe it and enter a PIN.  We also have hybrid swipe-and-chip cards so that you can have the extra security of the chip cards but still be able to use it in stores without the new readers."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,LadyA052,-3,Sat Jun 27 06:16:35 2015 UTC,"No, it's not the same as a credit card. You can cancel the CC and have the charges removed. If someone can use your debit card, they can wipe out your entire balance and you have no recourse."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,SchindHaughton,4,Tue Jun 23 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"Right. But the way it's actually used is the same - card number, expiration date, CCV."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,Princessluna44,-3,Tue Jun 23 05:39:08 2015 UTC,"Not mine. I have had one for over 30 years and there is nothing printed on it except the card number, and I swipe and enter a pin number. It is nothing like a credit card...it is STRICTLY a debit card with no link to any credit card, so it comes out of my checking account within an hour (I've looked). There is no protection like with a credit card. Account could be emptied...poof."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3aonvc,brazendynamic,0,Tue Jun 23 17:23:13 2015 UTC,Not exactly. Most banks offer either zero fraud liability or some small amount (like $50)

TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,Superior91,11,Sat Jun 20 07:29:32 2015 UTC,No proof that he took it and he would deny it. Very low though.
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,sandiercy,6,Sat Jun 20 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know, most of those convenience stores have a ton of security cameras.  So there probably was proof he took it.  But OP said he passed the guy on his way back in while the guy was leaving."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,SpastixFantastix,7,Sun Jun 21 00:26:44 2015 UTC,I really think they weren't paying attention. The cashiers seemed like they were feeling sort of blah and it was a slow day (Bald Guy and I were the only people in at that moment).
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,techiejames,8,Sun Jun 21 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"This is why there should be cameras. If for nothing else than to see this bald guy do it, then put the video on Reddit, so he can shamed by everyone else he runs into. Scumbag."

TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,krudler5,2,Fri Jun 26 09:32:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome that you had such a killer cashier! But, ummm... you really shouldn't leave money hanging about in public. Unfortunately, our society is no longer anything near like it was 50+ years ago. The honor system very rarely exists.   If you want to preserve and use your $1.50, take it with you while you run and get the extra dollar you forgot.  It's far more easy for cashiers to set your things aside than to watch your cash while they're busy checking someone else out."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,heilspawn,2,Sun Jun 21 05:21:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah. I'm just super trusting, I guess. Trusting and naive, haha."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,heilspawn,0,Sun Jun 21 16:05:27 2015 UTC,Maybe one of the cashiers took it
TalesFromTheCustomer,3ahfxn,heilspawn,9,Sat Jun 20 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"They might as well have. Cashier #1 agreed OP could leave his stuff there while he ran out to grab $1. I consider that to be implied agreement to keep an eye on the money/newspaper until OP returned. If cashier #1 didn't want to be responsible for the money, it was on the cashier to say he couldn't be responsible for the money and to take it with him. Because he agreed to watch the money and it was stolen, the cashier owed it to OP to replace the $1.50. It wasn't OP's fault that the cashier agreed to do something and failed to follow-through."
TalesFromTheCustomer,3agbuy,homsikpanda,24,Fri Jun 19 22:32:43 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there are so many people who would scream at the cashier if something like this happened to them.

TalesFromTheCustomer,3af3ku,DoctorWaluigiTime,7,Sat Jun 20 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"There is a Makeup store near my house (initials MN) that kind of seems to be an off shoot of one you would normally see at a mall. A few months ago I noticed a sign on the door (I never go in there, it's just next to a sub place I like). It said ""Our store hours are xx am- xxpm Monday through Friday. If you ever arrive during these hours and the doors are locked or you do not find anyone to assist you, please call (non local #) and ask for (owner's name).""  It's still up and I can only guess that since the owner lives about 3 hours away (judging by the area code) and most likely has other stores, she was probably sick of being ripped off by dishonest people who claimed to open the store on time and not duck out early. Now when I go by there is someone always standing behind the register or stocking. It's a shame you have to treat people like 5 year olds to keep them honest/polite. Glad your gym did that, though!"
TalesFromTheCustomer,3acvdj,tmpCrssy,46,Fri Jun 19 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"The pharmacy I work at has a drive thru.  I work overnights all by myself, and 90% of the time an alarm sounds when a car pulls up to the drivethru, alerting me to go help them.  But sometimes the sensor doesn't  pick up on the vehicle.  Unsurprisingly, I don't spend my shift staring through the drive thru window.  I have scripts to fill and other tasks that have to be performed nightly.  Which is why there is a sign saying to ring bell for sevice.  Nevertheless, about once a month I get an irate phone call from some idiot sitting in the drive thru, outraged that he/she has had to wait.  ""Did you push the call button?""  The call button rings through the phone. It's  impossible to miss.  I know they haven't  rung it but this is my polite way of informing  them of the rational way to get service in the drive thru.  ""No, but I was honking my horn!""  Dude, it's  a brick building and the window is jeweler's glass.  Unless I am standing where you can see me and I can see you, I can't  hear your damn horn.  Hence the button.  You dim asshat.  These people  drive me crazy.  Luckily they are relatively rare."

I guess it's a bug. The easiest way for me to fix this was reformat one of the machines (my HTPC), start from scratch, then copy the game's folder to the hard drive of any other machine I wanted it on and tell the client to search for game installs."

They know who I am because I'm Deaf, and that kind of thing stands out a bit. My order never changes, either.  I get a little kick out of stepping up to the counter and starting to order - and seeing the new guy peer at me thoughtfully, then brighten and interrupt to say ""... and a large drink, right?"" The first time it happened to me with a new person, I saw a manager that I was more familiar with. She handed me the order and I commented on the fact that the guy knew my order - and she said that they tell all the front cashiers about me and my order, to make it easier on everyone.  I asked if they do that for all of their more unique customers, and she grinned, said: ""No, just the nice ones.""  This has been going on for several years and nearly a full staff turnover... yeah, I like these people."

If he was curious he could of asked and I would of been glad to show him the hat.  I am not sure how I overacted since at the time I froze, and then my boyfriend and I left the sex shop after it happened without saying anything about the situation. The time that the employee saw us at the mall my boyfriend basically excused us from the conversation and we walked away. Both times I remained quiet because that's how I dealt with things at that time.   And no, I did not know the guy well enough. When I entered the shop for the last time that was the first time that I ever saw the guy working there. I was not friendly with him. I was not friendly with anyone working there."

We ordered a 'Canadian' and the guy at cash said he didn't know how to do special orders and ran off to get his manager. I think 'special order' just meant anything that wasn't how and ready.

Specifically, it is the reversal of a prior outbound transfer of funds from a consumer's bank account, line of credit, or credit card.  Chargebacks also occur in the distribution industry. This type of chargeback occurs when the supplier sells a product at a higher price to the distributor than the price they have set with the end user. The distributor then submits a chargeback to the supplier so they can recover the money lost in the transaction.

TalesFromTheCustomer,39z465,Jintess,4,Tue Jun 16 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"This. So much this. I worked for a guy who ran a business (local, small).   My first week he told me to come up with a title so he could get me business cards. Did I want to be Vice President? Supervisor? Office Manager? He didn't care and it obviously wasn't an issue with him that I was flying blind at least 90% of the time. I settled for ""assistant"". He was confused as to why? I told him that the other titles implied knowledge that I wasn't willing to risk his reputation on. He appreciated that and I'm pretty sure our customers did as well. An assistant to the boss can promise (and deliver) that the message of importance is passed along to the correct person. A Vice President who doesn't even know who the right person is, is an embarrassment and (as seen here) can really drag a name through the mud."

Make sure you do it politely without visible anger, otherwise the manager may well not take you seriously. If she(god forbid) is the manager, call or stop in when she isn't working and ask for the manager then.  You'll want to speak to the manager alone, so that you can fully and calmly explain the situation, and ask them if there is a general or store manager that would be able to talk to her about her behavior. Make sure that you first ask that she be talked to, as requests of firing and more extreme measures are usually met with a sort of ""Yeah, fuck no."" reaction.  You have to make sure that you are as calm as you can possibly manage when you are speaking with someone about her behavior. Being particularly angry and/or aggressive lessens how willing retail employees are to listen to and help you."

Then we went through the bag and my receipt to make sure I had paid for every item in the bag.  The next time I shopped there and ended up with the same cashier, I watched carefully.

And I would generally give the most mild and fence sitting statement I could think of. I would not reccomend yelling at a clerk, but if you state politely that you do not see how it is their business then th cashier should back off."
TalesFromTheCustomer,39rzhf,sensualaustralians,-2,Wed Jun 17 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"I did not yell. I was stern, firm, and extremely direct. Had I reported her to her manager, she might have been fired.

TalesFromTheCustomer,39hynk,FullColorPenguin,8,Thu Jun 11 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"It's really odd for valves to go bad. Every shop I've gone to for cars or motorcycles always changes them out. If they changed it out twice and it still went bad, that's incredibly unlikely or indicative of a larger issue at the shop. I'd personally avoid this place in the future.  For getting tires off I carry a breaker bar and mallet in my car in place of the lug wrench supplied by Jeep. Makes it a piece f cake to get them off. Lug nuts should really be torqued on there to a set ft/lb. too little and they come off, too much and it breaks the stem.   You really shouldn't use a torque wrench for removing lugnuts. You'll mess up the calibration."
TalesFromTheCustomer,39hynk,storysunfolding,3,Thu Jun 11 23:16:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, I plan on avoiding this place like the plague from now on. I talked to my dad about all this and he thinks that instead of completely replacing the tire back in January, they tried to patch the valve.  Thanks for the tip about the breaker bar. I'm definitely going to invest in one as soon as possible. And I understand that lug nuts need to be secure, but I've never had an issue with breaking their holds until this particular car and store.  Looks like I've been using the wrong terms for things: I have a basic lug nut wrench, not a torque wrench. My bad."
TalesFromTheCustomer,39hynk,storysunfolding,2,Thu Jun 11 23:39:09 2015 UTC,If you have one nearby go to a harbor freight. A mallet and breaker bar for occasional use should be <$10. Heck- throw the right socket in and it'll probably still be that cheap.  If there's any proof they patched the valve then report them to your states AG. That's beyond unsafe. The valves are normally billed out to me as a customer at $5. Guarantee they get them for less than $2. That's how little they valued your life.
TalesFromTheCustomer,39hynk,Mewshimyo,2,Fri Jun 12 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"A few things -- if you have any evidence of them just patching it, you absolutely need to be contacting someone, because that is unsafe, and if they were telling you they were replacing the tire, is borderline illegal.  Even beyond that, there is such a thing as the implied warranty.  Regardless of their policies, if they sell something that is woefully unfit for purpose (in this instance, safely getting you around), they are required to fix the issue.  This is entirely unsafe, and entirely unfit for purpose.  Tell them you expect a full refund for the tire, then avoid them like the plague."
TalesFromTheCustomer,39hynk,bitshoptyler,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:41:58 2015 UTC,"Breaker bars can definitely help you out on the side of the road. I'm glad you're not trying to use a torque wrench to remove them, they're only supposed to go in one direction. There's also a good chance they could have used a torque wrench to put them on, but just dialed it up a bit high (most people don't re-tighten their lug nuts, so better safe than sorry.)"
TalesFromTheCustomer,39hynk,Cellifal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"A bit of advice - picking up the breaker bar is fine, but do not get a mallet to use with it. Hammering the bar is a great way to break something. The breaker should be plenty long anyway, so you should be able to get enough leverage with it.   All this being said, I wouldn't be too quick to blame the shop for overtightening the lug nuts. I'm a 19 year old guy with some muscle on me from sports, and when I put lug nuts on my car, I'll do it to the exact specifications in the manual and still have trouble ""breaking"" the lug nuts sometimes, even with a huge socket wrench."

Given that this has happened several times, and they are now expecting OP to pay them to fix their own mistake, this is absolutely chargeback material.

She fought through all her illnesses to volunteer at out schools and work a regular job until walking became a problem for her.    I am so lucky to have had her for a mom.  Sadly, when she was bedridden, I did not always feel lucky.  Sometimes it felt like such a burden for the whole family and I would get frustrated with her.  I'd give anything to hug her one more time and apologize for being such an ass."

There is a certain company that is still sending mail to my late husband after his death over 6 years ago, despite my phone calls. I just look at it as his way of saying 'Hello'. I have to look at it that way because obviously they aren't going to stop."
TalesFromTheCustomer,39e3kf,BarkingLeopard,3,Thu Jun 11 11:14:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Given the number of times we were told she would likely die (including one about 10 years before she actually did die) and she came through it somehow, we were lucky to have her as long as we did.  But on the flip side, it got to the point where I expected it to be like every other time she went to the hospital.  She'd be there a while and then come home.    That last time, it wasn't until my dad came home one night from visiting her and said they had called police on him and he was almost arrested that I realized this time was probably more serious.  (Long story short, they wanted to do a procedure my dad did not agree with and wouldn't listen to him...the procedure was what ultimately killed her led to her death.  But we spoke to a lawyer afterwards and they said given all her illnesses it would be very hard if not impossible to prove.  It sucked.)"

TalesFromTheCustomer,39b6ak,auto98,4,Wed Jun 10 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I actually did an experiment on this with an Australian kettle and a US one (each in their native land). Whilst the voltage supplied from most plugs in the US is 120 V (although you typically have either 208 or 240 available in this kitchen with a bit of work thanks to having an oven there) vs. most of the rest of the world having 220-240 (depending on location, one major exception being Japan), it won't necessarily take twice as long. The kettle in Australia took just over 2 minutes to boil 1 litre, whilst the US kettle took about 3:30. What's probably going on here is that the US kettle is drawing very close to the 15 A limit, whilst the Australian one is drawing closer to 10 A.  Meanwhile, you can still get 240 V kettles in the US (they're not readily available, but you can find them on Amazon). Combined with a bit of electrical knowledge, you can (provided you have enough current capacity to spare on the circuit) install another plug from the oven circuit to run one."

In the south only one place gave me hot tea.

TalesFromTheCustomer,398d4n,jimmahdean,3,Wed Jun 10 06:48:17 2015 UTC,The 217 was what the car cost in the travel package. The one they wouldn't give us cause my father played for the whole package. The 685 was what had to pay to get a different car so we could go to our hotel.
TalesFromTheCustomer,398d4n,themeatbridge,4,Wed Jun 10 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"The way I see it and correct me if I'm wrong, OP, is that OP's father paid for it, so the renting company had it in his name. OP confirmed that they needed an ID and CC, but the company assumed that OP would be the name on the order and didn't bother to confirm it, and therefore didn't mention the policy of needing the payer and the renter to be the same person.  Could be wrong, but maybe. What would the desk agent gain from committing fraud?"
TalesFromTheCustomer,398d4n,jimmahdean,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"That wasn't what I understood the situation to be, but you could be right.  I thought OP had called after the fact to find that the agent was incorrect about policy, and they only needed the driver's ID and credit card.  But I could be completely wrong.  As for what the agent gains, it's possible they work on commission, or have incentives for reaching monthly goals.  The agent might be a manager, or in some other way benefit from an additional rental and three times the original rate."
TalesFromTheCustomer,398d4n,jimmahdean,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"They also told us there was no policy change   OP was told that there wasn't a policy change, so the desk agent is certainly lying, but maybe not intentionally, or maybe OP heard them wrong. ""Well... maybe the policy changed between when you called and now"" translated into ""the policy changed."" I run into this a lot when we tell customers that maybe if we do this, we can make the installation work, they get it in their heads that that will definitely work, when we're not quite sure. People twist words around in their heads all the time.  Again, not saying this is what happened, but I could see it happening."

Both companies told me that whoever the driver was, we put me as the driver on the site, needed and ID and CC. When we attempted to pick the car up my dads name was on it with my name. The lady told me that the policy changed so no matter what who payed had to pick it up. I have no idea what the policy was before given that we bought it through the travel company. The thing I found weird is the flights and hotel were in my name like we listed on the website. I dunno why the car was under my fathers name when I listed only mine and my wife's. The only time my fathers name came up on the entire order was the name on the CC. So thats why im not sure if that was a messup by the website or something different.

So I moved in with my Girlfriend earlier this year and we decided to hire a van to move. She's just graduated Uni and doesn't have a Credit Card, one of the requirements. Due to my vision, I have no license but since I work, I have a Credit Card.   Knowing how specific the agreements can be for rental cars I read the terms in great depth and no where found any indication there was an issue for payment cardholders etc.  So I book, put down my Girlfriends License details, my card details and get a confirmation email.  Day comes we rock up and apparently, sicne the 'Credit Card could of been stolen' they can't accept my presence and authority to charge it. Girlfriend get upset and starts to cry because first time moving out of home is stressful enough for her and she is embarrassed she has to call her parents to transfer cash to her account including enough for the deposit usually held on the credit cards.  I followed up the 'new' policy and in the end wqs offered 30% off any future rentals seeing as they had nothing in the agreement stipulating their 'policy'.   Scumbags"

I'll list the reasons why so people can know.  1) This is a common way for people to find out if someone has an active account at a bank. They pick up your wallet, scan your card, whatever way they find your name.   2) This is a common way that people will try to get around the mandatory reporting for large sums of cash.  This one has happened when I was there 3) Someone knows your account, deposits money in to it during some legal battle, then brings up the deposit in court to help their case. I've seen it in divorces and small claims issues. They'll put in less money then they owed, and claim it was a bank error.  4) People do this to family often. One guy thought his wife had a secret account, so he went to the bank, did this, and used the info to confront her.

I'm confident a judge would take into account that I was not informed the money was being deposited by the person who owed me money, and that I could reasonably assume it was from another source.   In terms of bank liability, that's why you have cameras. Also, I'm sure you audit the cash flow at the teller stalls regularly anyway. So that shouldn't be an issue (or at least, no more of an issue than someone depositing cash into their own account).  Also, while it makes sense for large sums to be questioned or not allowed because of the likelihood of money laundering, large sums are ~$10k+ (where I am) and that's not a common transaction anyway."

Those cameras are not nearly as good, or reliable as you would hope. Many of them were stills every 30 seconds.

They accept every other form of deposit, just not cash. They stated that it's due to non-account holders depositing their own money into other accounts, to prevent their money from being seized by companies who are past due.

She would always throw out the line ""So that's your thing?"" and keep adding, always with a calm and pleasant voice, with stuff like ""Trying to belittle people so you can feel better about yourself? That's just sad. Trying to act all bitchy right to people's faces hoping they'll be too stunned to call you out on your cunty little attitude?""    She could usually keep it up until our transaction was done (if we were at the register) or until the person just walked away. Pretty sure some of them went in the back and cried after dealing with her. She never started it but she'd always finish it. It was like watching someone retaliate to a slap with a nuclear weapon."

TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,FlyingGuineaPig,107,Sun Jun 7 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"There's no law against telling their ingredients, but their is a law against not telling you the ingredients. The FDA is pretty strict about this, mostly because of food allergies just like yours. If you ever look at the list of recalls on the FDA website, one of the biggest categories is for ""undeclared allergens"" on packaged foods.  Restaurants have always had more leeway than packaged foods, but I'm 95% sure they still have to disclose allergens and other nutrition information when requested. Do you know how many stores this chain has? There are stricter regulations for chains with 20 or more stores.  The person you talked to was clearly wrong, especially since you got good service at other stores in the chain. It's possible that she just didn't know and didn't care enough to look. Or if you want to give her the benefit if the doubt, maybe her training included some things about protecting proprietary information and she completely misunderstood the intent."
TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,wizardcats,20,Sun Jun 7 19:55:15 2015 UTC,Yeah... the law actually states food establishments need to convey this information to customers. Either in written form or orally.
TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,freckles88,23,Sun Jun 7 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"I also have a few food allergies and have to check before I eat something. At the mall I was in the mood for a pretzel so I went to one of the large chain pretzel makers in the food court and asked a worker. She told me it was ""proprietary"" information and none of the employees are allowed to know what goes into their pretzels and that I could call their corporate number to ask. Seeing as they hand make the pretzels, I doubt they have absolutely no idea what gets put into them and I just skip the franchise entriely."
TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,PoofMoof1,15,Sun Jun 7 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"That depends on exactly how they hand make them. If they just take a bunch of prefrozen dough and roll it out, they might not know exactly what goes into it."
TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,sevendaysky,2,Mon Jun 8 00:56:09 2015 UTC,I could understand that if it wasn't a place where they actually mix the dough at this big island for customers to watch and twirl them into the shapes and such.

TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,PoofMoof1,7,Mon Jun 8 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"I worked at a pretzel shop when I was younger, the dough and the dipping solution are ""proprietary,"" but there's a list of ingredients on the packaging of everything. She was an idiot."

TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,slayerchick,3,Mon Jun 8 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"My sister has a reaction to dairy products, and to simplify she says it's an allergy when ordering food. I don't necessarily agree with that but it shouldn't matter to the restaurant, so whatever...   One time, she went out for lunch and the restaurant wasnted her to sign a release of liability before they would serve her food.   None of our family has ever gone to that restaurant since, even though a lot of us don't have any food allergies or issues.   She even told them cross-contamination is fine and her problem isn't that severe. -_-"

TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,Princessluna44,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's lactose intolerance, although her and my mom have the same issue and my mom refers to it as a ""milk allergy"" or ""dairy allergy."" But it's not life-threatening by any means, just very uncomfortable for them (I think I might actually have the same thing, but I don't care enough about the side effects to stop eating dairy :P)  My sister's approach is to ask if something has dairy in it. Personally I'd ask about milk, but I guess that could be an issue if someone thought cream was okay or cheese, just not milk.   There's a bit of an issue where I live with using phrases like ""lactose intolerance"" because there's often a language barrier involved. About 60% of our population here is from overseas, and many don't speak English very well. It makes for fantastic food, but sometimes issues arise.   As for the release of liability... I can see how it's kind of understandable, and I get where they're coming from, sure... but it's not something I've seen anywhere else, and it basically negates their need to try to keep food from being contaminated. If they can't guarantee cross-contamination they should just say so, or even refuse service if it comes down to it. Or perhaps they could ask if the allergy is life threatening or causes breathing problems. It shouldn't their standard practice to bring out paperwork as soon as someone says the word ""allergy."""
TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,faiora,2,Thu Jun 18 15:29:34 2015 UTC,Sounds like the server was poorly trained.   Some establishments that don't want to take the time or liability that comes with being informed about a customers allergies can simply state they cannot with 100% certainty say an ingredient has not come in contact with a dish at some time during it's preparation.   That being said I have a few non life threatening allergies myself and the restaurants I return to are the ones willing to accommodate them...within reason.
TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,DariusRahl,2,Wed Jun 10 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"It's against the law for them to not tell you. Also, you should have asked for a manager.

TalesFromTheCustomer,38xpzb,ademnus,-2,Mon Jun 8 13:20:10 2015 UTC,"They don't want to serve you because of liability issues. They are covering their asses. Nuts are a tricky subject. Sorry, but it is their way of saying ""We can't guarantee that you won't be harmed, so we're refusing service."""

If that were the case, they could have given a disclaimer and warned people with allergies that the establishment could not guarantee a safe product. They'd still have to disclose which allergens are or may be present. They can't just say it's a secret.  Also, OP went to other chains of the same shop and had no problems, which means it's not a corporate policy, just one particular employee at one particular store."

TalesFromTheCustomer,38m4mo,fribby,8,Fri Jun 5 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"Can't advise you on the tracking, but the $100 owed might be their brokerage charge (the fee they charge to bring an item across the border). I never ship from the US with couriers because the brokerage is ridiculously high compared to the USPS, which charges under $10 for the same thing.   If you ever have the option of choosing, even if it takes a little longer to get to you, choose USPS, your wallet will thank you."

UPS also tried to charge me about 100 dollars at delivery, unfortunately the only way I could fix it was to refuse delivery on the grounds I did not want to pay the fee and then contact the seller, who then promptly re-shipped it to me using regular mail.   In my experience you can't do much except pay it or refuse service and hope the sender will re-send it to you with a cheaper option."

TalesFromTheCustomer,38m4mo,wishforagiraffe,10,Mon Jun 8 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. I have the same issues with BOTH major shipping companies in the US . I live in a condo with a small mailbox which only the mail mail has a key to. So because there is no access to the inside of my building, and my personal door, the drivers CANNOT leave my package.   So to fix this I leave a handwritten note on every door of the building with my phone number asking for the driver to call so I can give them a door code. Well, none of them ever call. Just final notices left on the door at the far end of the building, which I never use.   When I call said shipping company I get cute responses like ""we don't issue our drivers phones, it's not their job to call you"" but it is their job to deliver my package. And that's what I'm trying to help them do.   One time after calling to complain, the next day a driver called and told us he ""didn't have time for this shit."" And was generally hostile to my husband. So we called to complain. Shipping company then sent us a fruit basket to apologize. Shipped by their company, So it couldn't be delivered to our home. By the time we got it most of the fruit was rotten."

TalesFromTheCustomer,38oqir,Conchobair,-14,Fri Jun 5 16:39:33 2015 UTC,I guess it doesn't matter.  I thought someone in this profession would make eye contact with their customers when personally receiving their tip.

Not making eye contact is pretty much universally seen as distant, uninterested, and rude, so as a customer -- hell, as a human being -- it's no surprise that you'd wonder what that was all about.  If you see this person on a regular basis and they can't even be bothered to make eye contact with you, yeah, I'd be a little taken aback by that, too. I don't ask for much, but a small amount of human decency like acknowledging that I exist is expected.  And if anyone suggests that maybe this person has social anxiety or something, well, I feel bad for them if they do, but if that's the case the manager should have them doing something other than a highly social part of the job."

No one is asking for a staring contest, they're simply asking not to be treated in a way that is considered rude.   You're also making mountains out of molehills.

I'm okay most of the time, but sometimes it's easier just to give you your change and wish you a wonderful day.   Don't take it to heart. Such a tiny gesture shouldn't mean so much to people.

I've gotten over it now, but it took me a while.  I would go hang out with my friends, look them in the eye, then look down.  Made me seem super awkward."
TalesFromTheCustomer,38oqir,Elceepo,5,Sun Jun 14 01:38:44 2015 UTC,I'm a cashier at a major grocery store and this is something I struggle with (and have actually gotten a complaint over) but its something I'm trying to work on.   I've never liked small talk and so the customer service aspect of cashiering is a struggle for me. For me the main priorities of my job are bagging and scanning the customers items in a timely manner so social interaction becomes a bit of an afterthought but sometimes I slip to the point where I don't even thank the customer for shopping at the store.  It also depends on the level of energy I'm feeling at that point in time and a bunch of other things (including medications) but the result is that I have to constantly watch myself with things like that.

I've always felt that anything more than a quick sort of acknowledgement eye contact before returning my eyes to collarbone level or so is a sort of challenging behavior.  It may come from me being more of an animal person than a people person, but eye contact past that acknowledgement feels rude to me. I still smile(no teeth, that feels rude too), chit chat, so on and so forth, but I do not do eye contact."
TalesFromTheCustomer,38oqir,Cyndaquil,3,Thu Jun 11 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"I do the same, it's kind of like a shyness when it comes to eye contact.   I don't know you, I don't want to offend you, and for some reason to me looking people in the eyes shouldn't be a huge deal... but it is I guess.   Small talk itself is difficult whenever I've done cashiering. I just want people to leave, especially when they're going on and on about something I don't care about but which is huge to them. I once wasted 20 minutes looking at a person's knitting and macrame pictures, which while I can admit are interesting to some folk, do not mean I don't have other things to do than stand there telling you how wonderful your projects are, what colors will go best with what, for more than a few minutes. I figure since people usually see us as NPCs when cashiering it doesn't matter, I shouldn't worry too much about it."

After 2 hours you get tired of waiting, go up to the woman that told you to wait and see her computer with multiple facebook tabs open.

TalesFromTheCustomer,38avmn,sillygirlsarah,5,Wed Jun 3 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"I think I know which warranty you have, as only one main one makes homeowners pay for refrigerant.  Your system, having R-22 gives the contractor more room for variance on their price.  The wholesale price of R-22 is still around $15 per pound but companies often charge much, much, much more for it.  R410-A is cheaper and the 'newer' refrigerant. As for your situation.  A contractor can 'gas and go' up to a certain percentage of your AC's total refrigerant capacity.  I can't recall the amount it can be recharged in a year, but know that can be found on the EPA website. You do need to consider that there may be a second leak, or a new leak, and that the contractor did the work the reported to your warranty company.  The warranty company will normally want them to find the quickest potential solution to an issue and move forward from there.  With your system running another 60 days from the previous repair the leak would have necessarily been a slower one as pressurized refrigerant will leak out quickly from a large leak, and reduce cooling very quickly. Situation can be frustrating, and you'll never have a fully retail experience while with a warranty company, but there are better ones out there."
TalesFromTheCustomer,38avmn,-The-Matador-,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:58:36 2015 UTC,I would check to see which kind of refrigerant your unit takes.   I work for a place that sells HVAC supplies and there are only two kinds.  One that is over $300 - because the chemicals are harmful and the government want's them discontinued.  One that is only about $50 because it doesn't contain those harsh chemicals.  If you are now at a health risk due to a leak you probably have a much better shot at a law suit against them.
TalesFromTheCustomer,38avmn,miby,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:22:17 2015 UTC,I have R-22 in my unit. I don't think I'm physically suffering from the leak? What symptoms should I be looking for?

TalesFromTheCustomer,38avmn,imprl59,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:52:36 2015 UTC,"If the leak is big enough that you can feel it then the system would have been empty within hours, a day at most.  Since you felt the leak it's safe to say it's a new leak.    With the price of R22 it's getting to the point that it doesn't make sense to fix old leaky equipment, especially when it's in such bad shape as yours appears to be.  I would get a couple of companies out and get quotes on replacing the system."

TalesFromTheCustomer,38avmn,DragonDeadite,3,Wed Jun 3 03:27:31 2015 UTC,The leak was never fixed. The unit was just pumped back up only to leak it back out slowly over time. This is exactly what happened when I bought the house about a year ago. It cooled at first only to release all of it's refrigerant over time. It gradually started working less and less efficiently until it couldn't cool the house at all. I am thinking that the previous owner either knowingly or unknowingly did the same thing before selling it to me.
TalesFromTheCustomer,38avmn,crymson7,2,Wed Jun 3 03:54:26 2015 UTC,"Most people who refill a unit do it with a sealant of one type or another so that the leak stops.  If it is the same leak, and it is bad enough for you to FEEL it, then it would have been empty within days, not months.  I bet it's a new leak.  It happens with older units."

A lot of these tales seem to be well I should've done this, but want to come here instead to say and get sympathy votes.   It's not rude to question or ask for it at the time. If it's so unacceptable to you, or any other person in same position, do something about it there and then.  We can all complain about bad service but if it's not said to the right people at the time it happens, then it means nothing after. It's how we learn on both sides of the table."

I've also seen that simply because they didn't have the change (some places each server has to keep their own ""register"" in their apron instead of a shared drawer at the registers)  or maybe the boyfriend tipped her extra at the register, and lied about her ""keeping the change for herself""  Edit: Not saying this is what happened, but I have had dinners where the people I was with were being super rude and refused to tip, so I tipped extra behind their back to make up for it."

TalesFromTheCustomer,386qu6,duetmasaki,0,Tue Jun 2 15:51:35 2015 UTC,Thats cute. All she wanted was a two dollar tip.
TalesFromTheCustomer,386qu6,AllisonTheBeast,-9,Thu Jun 11 03:40:39 2015 UTC,"What was the amount? If it was 50 cents or less, that's more or less common, as servers rarely keep coins on them."
TalesFromTheCustomer,386qu6,BrandtCantWatch_,8,Tue Jun 2 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Servers are required to make exact change just like any other person handling a business transaction. Commonly failing to do so is commonly referred to as theft."
TalesFromTheCustomer,386qu6,Princessluna44,5,Wed Jun 3 00:40:52 2015 UTC,"This. There is change somewhere in that establishment. If the server has to go out of their way to get it (ie. to the bar), that does suck, but they should never short-change a customer."

Likewise, if it's $4.95, they're getting back $5. Some people have access to coin change, many don't. A nickel or dime here and there is generally considered unnecessary, however you are welcome to request your pennies if you really need it. It is not, however, a server ""helping themselves"" to a generous 5-cent tip. It's a matter of convenience and generally accepted practices."
TalesFromTheCustomer,386qu6,BrandtCantWatch_,9,Wed Jun 3 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"Spent many years in restaurants, doing everything from dishwasher to GM and damn near everything in between including serving/bartending. Shorting my bank in the interest of speed was common, but never in my favor.   If I didn't have exact change I either got it from the bar or gave them extra back. Keeping a customer's money was never considered ok, because it isn't."

TalesFromTheCustomer,385wqu,Mewshimyo,4,Tue Jun 2 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"In a standard headphone jack (which is basically what most guitar inputs are based around), there is commonly a metal piece that is springy so that it makes contact with the plug itself. If that goes bad, wiggling it can be a temporary fix, but the better solution is to either replace the input entirely or repair the metal piece.  It does happen, in other words, but troubleshooting is all about variables."

TalesFromTheCustomer,385wqu,Mewshimyo,4,Tue Jun 2 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"I was just commenting on how a faulty input could mimic a bad cable.

I once walked out of a store because they had no concept of politeness. They were utterly slow, then tried to serve another customer before me (customer was also annoyed by the slowness and complained about it). I walked out immediately.

Usually something will be available for maybe 3 months max and after that, they stop carrying it. Well when I went to check out, I sat my items on the counter and the cashier grabbed my bag to ring it up when they no longer sold it.

TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,SuperSonic4,32,Fri May 29 05:58:09 2015 UTC,"She still had to tip out everyone else. Two other servers, bartender, and the kitchen staff (unless they actually PAY some of those people). It's a shitty system and they shouldn't have to depend upon tips to ""get by""."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,SchindHaughton,2,Fri May 29 06:08:19 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. My impression is that most of the places that pool tips are restaurants where you order at the counter. Most sit-down restaurants have servers leave a certain portion for other employees (bartender, host, etc.)"
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,bibbi123,3,Sun May 31 06:55:32 2015 UTC,"That's not the way most tip pools work.  The usual practice is that a percentage of your sales is put into tip pool.  Where I worked it was 3%.  So if I sold $100, I'd have to put in $3 to the pool, no matter how much I made in tips.  The pool is then split amongst the non-tipped front-of-house staff (hostess, bussers), and sometimes the bartender as well.  This allows the restaurant to pay those non-tipped positions tipped wages (currently $2.13/hr in the US, I think).  Effectively, the waiters are paying part of the front-of-house staff's wages out of their tips."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,bibbi123,2,Mon Jun 1 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"Okey dokey.    Where I worked (corporate restaurant) it was actually called tip share.  The tip share wasn't all of your tips, it's a percentage of your sales.  It has nothing to do with your actual tips.  I'd pay out my 3% tip share (based upon sales), and the rest was mine to take home.  So if I made $500 in sales, I'd have to cough up $15 to the tip share, even if every single table stiffed me all night.  Even if every table tipped me 100%.  It wasn't negotiable, and it didn't change.  When I worked as a hostess, I'd get a little envelope at the end of my shift with my cut of the previous day's tip share.  Every waiter I've known who worked for a corporate restaurant described a similar system.  I have no idea how it works in other tipped occupations.  Hair stylists, caddies, valets, movers, baristas, they might do it differently.  Privately owned or Michelin star restaurants might do it differently. But corporate TGIChilibee's types?  That's how it was done.  I haven't worked in a restaurant in quite a while, so I can't affirm that it is still done that way."

I suppose, if I cared enough, I could hunt down corporate policy manuals showing tip share, tip pool, tip fuckitall, but I really don't. Care, that is.  You seem to be looking for a fight, or something.  I'm just bringing up my experience, which contradicts your message.  Oh, well.  You're not interested in doing your own research, and I'm not interested in doing it for you, since whether or not you believe me is completely immaterial.  Have a nice weekend!"
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,bibbi123,2,Fri Jun 5 19:52:40 2015 UTC,"If you're going to call me on it, then I suppose I need to call you on it, as well.  Show me your evidence.  I can only speak to what I know, and what the people I've met know.  All of them have worked for corporate restaurant chains.  All of them use a system very close to or identical to the one I described.  I've never encountered your version except in cases where the employee was not considered a tipped employee under USDOL guidelines, and eligible to be paid less than minimum wage.  I don't get your particular dog reference.  I was just pointing out that calling something by a different name didn't mean it wasn't the same thing.  A rose by any other name, and all that jazz.  At any rate, I'm home on a Friday night, well on the way to a nice buzz, and I couldn't care less about this particular conversation, so I'll let you declare yourself the winner, and I'll go do something fun instead.

TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,faiora,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"They still make minimum if their tips don't add up to that.   If someone isn't doing their job properly, though, then why should they get paid for it? Ideally they should be fired to stop wasting everybody's time.  I had a server once who walked away in the middle of taking our order, started a big argument with my sister about whether eggs are dairy (my sister has lactose intolerance but can have eggs/mayonnaise), and brought out a dish to my sister with cream in it after telling her it only had eggs. Also didn't fill our drinks or come back to check on us except when we got up to find her to finish putting our initial food order in (and the argument etc. happened in part 2 of the food order so it's not like that was her reason for disappearing). Of course I didn't tip her. What did she expect? Well, apparently she did expect a tip, since she stopped me at the door to explain to me that tipping is customary. I told her that doing her job is customary, but in retrospect I should have asked for her manager.   There's an enourmous sense of entitlement in some people that I just don't understand. In this case ""I showed up to work, so people should give me their money!"" ...really?"
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,sandiercy,10,Fri Jun 5 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Not everyone gave bad service, it was Jenni. Taking it out on the rest of the staff for her mistakes is the wrong thing to do. Better to talk to her manager and tip enough so that she can tip out."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,Mockingbear,12,Sat Jun 6 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"Servers don't usually get paid minimum wage here. So the tips are how they survive. Even if you got shitty service, not leaving a tip can be really harsh. A shitty tip the waiter might realize they did something wrong. No tip, they usually just assume you're the jerk.  Its a messed up system but I bet if we had to pay waiters a least minimum wage they would care a little more, especially at small places where getting a 20% tip on a 25 buck meal is still not a lot."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,DoctorDank,14,Sat Jun 6 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Oh fuck this logic. The rest of us have to do our jobs to a certain standard, or we get fired and don't make any money. Jenni did not perform to the standard. So why should she make any money? I have no social obligation to pay someone's wages when they're not doing their job. And I don't care if they think I'm a jerk. Let them think that."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,carriegood,13,Fri May 29 15:31:15 2015 UTC,"Not a great analogy. If we don't do our jobs to a certain standard, we may get fired, but we still get paid for the work we did, no matter how shitty.  Only servers depend on tips to merely bring them up to minimum wage."

It's really odd. Me insisting upon proper service or no tip makes me a shitlord or something, I guess."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,shunkwugga,2,Fri May 29 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"No, just not American. America is the only place where tips are part of your wage rather than something extra.

Not tipping well is basically cutting someones pay, which typically doesnt happen."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37opqs,Mockingbear,2,Fri May 29 18:21:40 2015 UTC,"The rest of us get paid minimum wage or more. I think the tip OP left was very appropriate, because it was less than standard and she did a shitty job."

TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,freudian_nipslip,92,Tue May 26 22:37:27 2015 UTC,I don't want to be an asshole but I think that maybe you should talk to his manager about it. He used your information for other purposes aside from billing you and I believe that it was not the time or place to do something like that. It's cool that he's attracted to you and stuff but... That was quite the stretch there with his actions.
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,kokomocat,35,Tue May 26 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm kind of considering it. Like, part of me is going, ""Okay, it's awkward, but he didn't mean anything by it""...but another part of me is feeling like I shouldn't have to deal with random 50-year-old guys trying to get in contact with me when all I want to do is buy some pasta salad.  Thing is - and I doubt it'd ever escalate like this, but just lemme put my tinfoil hat on for a second - I'm kind of hesitant due to some past bad experiences. I've had a legit stalker before, who sexually assaulted me, and I'm afraid that it'll provoke this guy if I talk to his manager (he'll obviously know who it was). We live in a small town, and obviously he already knows who I am.   In reality, the worst that would probably happen is that Clerk would have his feelings kind of hurt, he'd feel the need to make an awkward apology if we ever ran into each other again, and that'd be that. But I'm still unreasonably nervous."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,TwilightTraveler,21,Wed May 27 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"I'd probably mention his behavior to the store manager, not the MOD, but the one in charge of the store, and tell them that you would prefer that you not be mentioned if any reprimand is made. If they ask for a reason for the anonymity request, which they shouldn't, just saying that you had someone stalk you once, and the cashier's behavior made you incredibly uncomfortable should be enough.  I'm a cashier, and there are some regulars I am fond of, but I would never even dream of purposely remembering their full name to find them on any social networking site. I don't even know their names. The few I can think of off the top of my head are: ""Brisk, but nice asian guy, no bag, always coupons"", ""Stone deaf scrapbooker, always coupons, thank god she can read lips and I can rest my voice a little"" and ""Sweet little old hunched knitter lady, likes sales"". They're nice, and it always makes my day a little better when they're in, but I'm not going to try to contact them outside of checking their items out. I'll certainly perk up a bit when I see them in my line, and enjoy the customers that I know exactly what they want, but it's not appropriate to go and invade their privacy like he did to you.  TL:DR - Please tell the Store Manager. They should be able to reprimand him without mentioning your involvement."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,sayaandtenshi,6,Wed May 27 07:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I worked in fast food, there were a few regulars I really enjoyed seeing and it made me happy to serve them since they were so nice but I don't remember their names. I remember their orders and faces but no names."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,danatblair,3,Wed May 27 13:14:36 2015 UTC,I worked in a part of retail that involved names. I would usually have the order ready for a regular while they were approaching so they could get it. I never really engaged in any chit chat unless the customer initiated it.
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,danatblair,6,Wed May 27 17:48:54 2015 UTC,I don't consider it unreasonably nervous. Looking up a customer is not really normal. and anyone who actually tried to have some sort of contact outside of the retail environment is odd at the least. I can say that you have a reason to at least be wary.
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,thebooknerdkid,18,Wed May 27 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, OP, I second this. That's so not okay. Additionally, he might be doing this to other people as well. No matter how nice his intentions could be, it's creepy."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,SpastixFantastix,15,Tue May 26 23:41:30 2015 UTC,"100% agree with you.  It crossed the line when he used your CC info.

TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,BrandtCantWatch_,-1,Wed May 27 03:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, let's try to get a guy prosecuted for looking someone up on FB.

TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,BrandtCantWatch_,13,Wed May 27 11:27:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that it'd be way overkill to try to get him in any sort of legal trouble for this. It'd be different if he'd used my actual credit card number for something, or if he was continually attempting to contact me...the name thing is still probably illegal, but that doesn't mean I want him punished for it.  That being said...   I'm personally in favor of being an adult and saying ""that was not OK and I am no longer comfortable talking to you.""   is a nice thought, but really not something I'm comfortable doing. I've had enough negative experiences with men losing their shit on me for similar things (expressing disinterest, asking them to leave me alone), I don't really want to take the chance.

It's 100% your decision and I respect that, up to and including the legal route should you see it as appropriate.  My response is to the people who aren't involved that take everything to 11 because the world is some big scary place and all people are predators that want to harm them.  Those people obviously exist, and that you've had to deal with those things isn't to be minimized. I apologize if that's what I've done.

TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,coffeeismysoul,3,Wed May 27 15:02:34 2015 UTC,It's 100% inappropriate.  However like you said he probably did not mean anything by it.  I'd ask the store manager (not manager on duty) to see about instituting a policy about this without naming names.  The clerk will get the message without getting fired for a mistake.  That said if you want to name names that is totally a legitimate approach.

I know a few people on the spectrum (including my father), and this guy's behavior wasn't really similar. He just seemed like a ""normal"" guy who was way too friendly and kinda pushy, I guess. But who knows?"
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,Number_06,8,Wed May 27 01:24:30 2015 UTC,Maybe he is a really socially awkward guy who doesn't really understand when friendliness goes too far. Not to say he shouldn't be reprimanded for it (how else is he going to learn) but it could have very well been innocent on his part but in real life is a really creepy thing to do.
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,thetruthfl,7,Wed May 27 04:03:37 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I've assumed. Like, I don't think he's an axe murderer or anything...I think he just didn't really think through how goddamn creepy his actions would come off."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,AggressiveBurrito,4,Wed May 27 13:16:09 2015 UTC,"Meh, he thinks you're friends. He talks to you every day. Not a big deal. The only problem is that he mentioned your credit card. I've added people that I've know for a shorter amount of time and I've found people with WAYYY less personal information. I've found people with just their job before. It's just facebook. Everyone uses it differently. Just decline if you dont want to be friends with him. Some people have hundreds of friends they've never met and others keep it very personal."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,kokomocat,6,Wed May 27 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dunno. I think it'd freak me out a lot less if we were peers in any sense of the word. Like if we were the same age (or even in the same generation), had some shared interest we'd talked about, etc, it'd make more sense for him to want to contact me outside of our usual brief workplace exchange. And if he'd attempted to add/contact me in some sane way, instead of looking me up using information on my credit card.   Like, I worked customer service for almost a decade, and I never would have dreamed of doing something similar to a customer, even ones I interacted with very regularly."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,thetruthfl,-29,Wed May 27 11:33:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why would someone who you admittedly talk with ON A DAILY BASIS want to be your FB friend? I'm flabbergasted here! <Sarcasm>  MILLIONS of people have FB friends who they haven't talked to IN DECADES."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,kokomocat,16,Wed May 27 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"First, because he got her full name from her credit card, instead of asking like a normal person. Second, because they're not really friends; she was a regular at his place of employment, not someone he knew socially. Third, because looking up someone on Facebook using information you gathered fraudulently and then threatening to add them even though you're not really their friend is fucking creepy."
TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,thetruthfl,-14,Wed May 27 01:47:48 2015 UTC,"LOL. Whatever. One person's ""creepy"" is another  person's show of friendliness.   How about when famous athletes/entertainers use their agents to contact someone else's agent to ask for a date EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO, NOR MET SAID PERSON? That's A DATE, not a simple FB friend request. I'm told THAT happens a lot."

TalesFromTheCustomer,37dx76,thetruthfl,30,Wed May 27 19:40:50 2015 UTC,Possibly because he took her info from her credit card when they're clearly not friends but just client/clerk?

The tills actually kept track of how many people we got to go for the store card. If our percentages were down we would get reamed out by the manager. We were forced to push it on customers even though most weren't interested. It sucks the big one.
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,MouseMistro,20,Tue May 26 02:01:01 2015 UTC,That kind of situation just sucks.  This is why I try to be as respectful as possible.  This is another aspect of such programs - how much do you damage the morale of your employees by pushing this?
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,MouseMistro,31,Tue May 26 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"Not only that but it's the employees who get the flack from the angry customers when they become annoyed from having a card shoved down their throats.

First of all, I really don't like the idea of this card and second, I didn't want another card; but would get asked every time I would shop there which was fine, I would say no thank you and move on. But one day, this cashier actually started getting agitated that I said no and was asking ""Can I ask you why you don't want this card? I mean it's just like your debit card, I don't understand why you wouldn't want this card."" and the final straw was ""is it because you don't have a bank account"". I kind of went off on her a little giving my reason why I didn't want their card and that I didn't appreciate being harassed when I am just trying to check out."

TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,CrystalKU,4,Tue May 26 05:20:04 2015 UTC,"just to clarify, this wasn't just a credit card, the store also has one of those (it's a big name store, it has it's own mastercard CC and a store credit card that gives rewards) this was a card that was actually linked to your bank account and debited directly. I just checked, you can still apply for the card online, so it still exists actually."

Despite loving the hell out of their tank tops (it's truly a sickness really, I think I have more of them than Imelda Marcos had shoes), I haven't set foot inside a Target in forever and just order stuff online from 'em. The one closest to me is always a mess with traffic because of where it and the Interstate are situated."
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,CrystalKU,3,Tue May 26 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Since we are supposed to reveal business names, lets just say it was a big store that had a recent credit card breech (the debit card offer was sometime recently but may have been right before that breech) and they explained that it worked just like a debit card or a check. That was why she was so flabbergasted that I didn't want it, she was even arguing with me, ""why wouldn't you want this, it's just like your debit card, you don't have to do anything special it just comes out of your bank account"". Yea, and I don't like giving out my debit card number to anyone because fraudulent charges could drain my bank account instead of just maxing out a CC. I'm guessing this had to be before the breech because I probably would have said ""and you see how well you guys protect our information"".  edit: I just checked, it's still available."
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,predpilot85,3,Tue May 26 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"I overheard one of the team leaders berating a girl because she hadn't met her red quota for the day. I think they called it red quota, or something like that. Some unbreakable code that no customer would ever understand. /s  Either way, they are pressured to get a certain number every day it sounds like.   I had a similar experience. The girl was like ""I love mine, I use it all the time, WHY don't you wan't one? It's SO easy."" I kindly informed her that the company she works for just had the biggest retail breach of customers' personal info and the last thing I want is one of their cards linking directly to my bank account. Her response was something like, well the chances of it happening again are slim to none. At that point I said no again and if she couldn't accept that, I'd walk away right then.   It's infuriating."

And also glad I've only ever used a CC with them.   Far as I know, I haven't been breached there - I actually did just apply to a high end CC offer as a lark thinking I wouldn't get approved, but I actually was, so if I have been, they improved my credit haha- but am still so very glad it wasn't my actual bank info."

TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,Princessluna44,5,Tue May 26 15:12:51 2015 UTC,CC = outstanding fraud protection and rewards.  I usually get $500 a year for just using the card like normal and not carrying a balance. Debit card = its your money so if someone else spends it it's GONE.  Lot of horror stories out there.
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,Princessluna44,2,Wed May 27 08:08:37 2015 UTC,"Not true. I had my debit #s stolen a few years ago. Bank shut down the account, issued me a new card, and refunded the amount that was stolen (about $120)."

TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,jonrock,6,Thu May 28 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"Well, at this point this is pure semantics.  If it is taken from your account, it is gone.  It isn't there.  That is the definition of gone.  I didn't say ""gone forever"".  My point was that is never the case with cc fraud.  There is no cash to be gone."

TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,Famous_felix,22,Fri Jun 5 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"In my case they got neither.  I suspect that's part of the problem - people like me won't show up as 'failed sales', we just won't show up at all, so all of their data is biased toward the results they expect.  Does no one in sales and marketing at these places think about this, though?"
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,pesh527,16,Mon May 25 23:30:39 2015 UTC,"I think the real answer is that people like you are the outlier, and the majority will just succumb to giving their info because it's more convenient to them then to have to go and re-buy their stuff elsehwere."

Do they really gain enough marginal information on the rest of the customers by forcing signups that it's worth shutting out part of the market entirely?  Maybe so, just seems odd to me to give up brand goodwill by being so info greedy."
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,danatblair,6,Tue May 26 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"Well, you did mention in another comment how easy and willing most are in giving up their info. So my guess is that they've analyzed the potential drawbacks of being so forceful and found that the data showed they come out ahead in the end.  At the end of the day no matter how out of touch corporations seem, you can bet that the reason they do anything is because they see money in it."
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,kokomocat,4,Tue May 26 00:48:44 2015 UTC,"Well, respectfully I disagree; I don't think they have analyzed it properly, that's why I brought it up.  After all, they have competitors who don't do it.  Sure, no doubt they think it's making them more money, but there are reams of case studies showing how often businesses make awful decisions."
TalesFromTheCustomer,379b2h,sewsnap,4,Tue May 26 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"Right, but ""businesses make bad decisions"" isn't a valid thing to cite in this case. I could use that logic to debunk any valid work a person has done, citing ""people make mistakes all the time.""  Of course neither of us are in corporate, but I do believe that us who do thwart data collection of this type are not many in number. At least not a significant amount."

For all of those, they've always just handed me a paper to fill out with a wallet card and two key chain cards and I've never filled out any of those papers and turned them in, but am still able to use the cards just fine.   Walgreen's was the only one where I was asked at the time for a phone number, and I just gave them a really old one. It was the landline number we'd had when I was growing up that hasn't been my or anyone else in my family's number since 1994. And that's because they never gave me a physical card of any sort, they just always ask for my phone number to be able to use the rewards program. Since that number was so easily remembered for me even 20 years later, it's easy. Or hell, just 867-5309 it!

TalesFromTheCustomer,377jdb,perrin77,45,Mon May 25 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"I did rounds in pharmacy school with an infectious disease doctor.  The average American gets 10 cases of food poisoning a year.  Which seems high, but human immune systems are usually good at dealing with food poisoning.   But sometimes not, as you found out.  The two most common culprits are cooked then cooled (and improperly stored or improperly reheated) rice and potatoes.  Raw meat is far less likely to get you sick.  This is why I rarely eat grocery store sushi.   If the rice is cooked, then cooled, then warms to room temp, then is cooled again (this can especially be true if the sushi is made off site) then you have a breeding ground ripe for nasty make you wish you'd never been born bacteria.  Yum!  And without going to an er, if you suspect food poisoning your best bet is Pepto Bismol.  The bismuth in it is antibacterial."

TalesFromTheCustomer,377jdb,Famous_felix,6,Mon May 25 15:34:52 2015 UTC,How is it that only OP was sick though? Would it be due to their individual immune system or is it just that the one piece of sushi that they ate was bad?  I work in fast food and when we get customer feedback about getting sick we always keep an eye out for any other complaints but almost every time its just one person. Which doesn't make sense as all of our product comes packaged so that if there was a problem then more than 1 person should be getting sick (unless we aren't cooking 1/10 or 1/20 meat patties properly).
TalesFromTheCustomer,377jdb,MsAlign,12,Tue May 26 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"First all you are never going to get 100% people reporting back that they got sick.  People just do not, in general, think to report it, or they aren't sure what caused it, don't want to make a fuss, or don't even realize they have food poisoning.   Then you have people with tougher immune systems and gut flora.  And you variables in the food itself -- most could have been stored at correct temps but a few were not for whatever reason (example: a patron grabbed some refrigerated food and put it back on a regular shelf.  Instead of it getting salvaged, it accidentally gets put back in with the refrigerated stock).    There are many reasons why you don't hear more reports of food poisoning."
