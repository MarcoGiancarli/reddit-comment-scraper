At the top of Zoe's chapters past chapter 5, it says ""The Phenomena"".  So alternate universes?  Oooh, maybe that's how Kellog and Watkins made it back? Because they're from the other universe?"
ThePhenomenon,3dplwz,kickwitkowskiass,3,Mon Jul 20 11:05:16 2015 UTC,People have noticed the Phenomenon/phenomena differences in reference to others chapters but no one has pointed out if a pattern exists between how different characters have it.  IIRC the 'phenomena' title began use after the introduction of 'the tall ones' and since Viktor's story begins chronologically before the tall ones were introduced it may have made more sense to keep the title at phenomenon then was for whatever reason continued through now.  Or it means something I don't know but I eagerly await the next installment.

ThePhenomenon,3d7trz,nmitchell076,11,Tue Jul 14 04:43:45 2015 UTC,"Hey there!   Thanks as always for providing such an engaging story. It's always nice when I'm winding down for a day or waking up and I see a new story up. Hope this continues for a long time!   Thank you.  It probably will, but I intend to then make a more generalized subreddit and start other stories.   I was wondering if I could ask you about your writing process. How ""stream of consciousness"" is it and how ahead of yourself do you tend to think? Let's take a chapter like the last Lucinda chapter. How far before writing that chapter did you know A)  that she would get caught, and B) that it would play out in the way it did?   I knew a chapter or two out. I thought about continuing her arc imprisoned, detailing her interrogation, trial, etc.. But I realized those would be some very dry chapters, so I cut her short. Some characters are very much stream of consciousness, others are intricately planned and researched.   Also, any chance you might reveal why you spent so much of a focused time on the Ben story? It's really the only time we've had an extended period where we consistently focused on a single area. Did you just feel like that story line had some catching up to do?   I realized that where the other stories were going, were going to (relatively) quickly reach a certain turning point. For that to happen though, I needed to close out the New York chapters, so I focused on Ben & Co. In order to bring the pacing to a more even level.   Also, do you work all on the reddit submissions page? Or do you have like word docs with half completed chapters, or jotting down new ideas that come to you.   I use Inkpad/Notepad for Android on my phone, and copy-paste into the Reddit Is Fun Submission Tab.  I do have Jessie's next chapter about 3/4 finished at the moment, as well as notes on many other things.   Just some lingering questions! Keep up the great work!   Thank you, my pleasure."

The introduction of the tall ones is perhaps the central turning point of the series thus far (though the Watkins and Kellogg thing could potentially top that, depending on how it plays out). At what point in your writing did the idea of the tall ones and their role in the story start to materialize for you?"
ThePhenomenon,3d7trz,safarispiff,5,Tue Jul 14 05:54:00 2015 UTC,"Actually the Tall Ones were very much a part of the stream. If you reread the chapters leading up to them, you see that there was a change coming, but not even I knew what until it was time."

Would be a cool plot mechanic if seeing characters maybe go blind or the sun gets blocked out or something along those lines.  Just my two cents

Worst part was the girl bleeding out after the accidental gunshots from the navy guy.  Not finding a worst character thus far, but we still have time to find someone to dislike.  Favorite part so far is the girl from the project finding the tall ones digging, then actually going down into that cavern.  I can't wait to find out what they transform her into (one of themselves?).  I don't think she is going to die, and if she retains her memory she might be able to convey some intel back to the project.  Love the story line, love the pace of the story as well.

The only issue I have, is how I visualize all of this taking place.  I think the timeline is a little hard to follow between characters, but I really do enjoy the diversity of getting a change of scenery from time to time.  My favorite character is by far Emil.  I can tell he's got something waiting up his sleeve.  Worst part so far? That one is tough, probably when Sharon's fate was sealed by the guy who got scared and accidentally shot her.  I like how you portrayed her initially as a hero figure, but I think taking her out of the picture gives a nice plot twist, but I would really like to see Emil go through some sort of hard ship, connect it back to Sharon helping them, and realize that he has to step up.  Worst character? Not a fan of Longmire.  His attitude tells me something about him isn't all that long.  Out of curiosity, if you could break all of these chapters up into say, a smaller set of larger chapters, where each chapter tells a little bit about each character and maybe has a key even happen to each character, how would you do it?"

I don't know if this is some kind of instinctual response to stimuli, or if there's a kind of collective intelligence to them. Very strange and I'm eager to learn more.   At the same time, there's something about the mystery of it, especially near the beginning, when nothing, not even nuclear bombs or conventional weaponry had an effect on the shards, that was just downright freaky and scary. I want to know what they really are and stuff, but at the same time, the unknown properties of it is just freaky shit that I love.

ThePhenomenon,34415z,Rionoko,7,Tue Apr 28 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"Theory I have so far:  The tall ones are not just scavengers, not actually in control of the shards.  The tall ones were near to humanoid, from another world, and the shards are a type of superhuge space virus,which flows throughout the universe, following their noses to whatever it is in living species that sustains them. Once they devour all of the easily accessible resources, they wait and pick the scraps until they find the next world, and then move on.  Once the tall ones' world was infected by the virus, nearly everything that lived was killed within half a year. But the tall ones that managed to survive got strong, withstood the millions of years underground, until they adapted enough to not be effected by the virus. They see in a spectrum that the shards cannot see, they suck the cold from an area so the shards don't notice the heat, they are essentially invisible to the shards because of this. They develop some form of space travel, and abandon their homeworld. they learn to track the shards, and travel along with them, trying to explore new worlds, hopping from galaxy to galaxy in hopes of finding a way to kill the shards, and save the universe."

ThePhenomenon,30nzf8,SovreignTripod,4,Sun Mar 29 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Actually that whole repetition of ""bleed out"" was awkward, so I went ahead and altered that a bit. And thank you."
ThePhenomenon,30nzf8,dinkleberg24,2,Sun Mar 29 05:46:46 2015 UTC,You used Emil's name in dialogue without ever introducing him by name.
ThePhenomenon,30nzf8,wranglingmonkies,2,Tue Mar 31 10:12:30 2015 UTC,"Notice the break between the last chapter and this one where Emil & Sarya went from dark eyes at the back of the store to front and center with Longmire & Cox, standing over Sharon?  There were introductions and explanations off screen I didn't feel necessary to script."
ThePhenomenon,30nzf8,mermaliens,2,Tue Mar 31 10:18:47 2015 UTC,"I was pretty sure that's what you intended but what it made me feel was clunkiness. If I picture your chapters as a book is a pretty uneducable lapse to skip intros. If i picture it as a tv show then I could understand why... But I would still do it. There isn't a huge implied gap of time in between them meeting and the action of moving Sharon into the other room. You even describe Emil as taking orders from ""the man who was suddenly in charge"". Sarya becomes familiar with names to and while I liked that you kept her childishness by her dialogue sounding younger she wouldn't just adopt that type of attitude for someone who she just met.  I'll still keep reading but for the sake of it is either wait till a slower moment of your story before having them use each others names, or slide a rough introduction in there. Something to ease the clunkiness of them having somehow met in a short span of time while keeping friendly attitudes that didn't scare Sarya all while trying to help Sharon live."

ThePhenomenon,30gjza,Cavalier009,5,Fri Mar 27 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, that's not correct. Having no apostrophe makes the word ""captain"" plural.

ThePhenomenon,30gjza,DOESNT_FAP_EVER,3,Fri Mar 27 19:54:06 2015 UTC,I thought that rule was only for its/it's. For everything else I believe the apostrophe is used for possession.

ThePhenomenon,303ycl,Harvin,22,Tue Mar 24 08:30:57 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine the light is filled with an overwhelming awareness of every Arnold Schwarzenegger pun, all at once.  As the light began to fill their minds, an acute awareness of the fundamental nature of the Tall Ones took hold. Everything made so much sense, as if they could hear its thoughts and desires. The last few seconds of their lives replayed over with new-found understanding as the giant approached...  Watkins stared in horror as the door was ripped apart.   Hello, Sorry about the door, Is the party over?   The giant crouched down as it passed through the chilled remnants of the doorway.   Ice to meet you. Cool party!   The giant stood upright and narrowed its gaze upon the helpless men.   Tonight's forecast... a freeze is coming!   It was really as if Kellogg saw where this was going, and had tried to stop the endless barrage of puns before they began. He swung his rifle off his shoulder, his eyes screaming ""Have mercy!"" at the eldritch horror now approaching.    Mercy? I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.    The pun was too much, and it overwhelmed his years of military training as he forgot to switch off the safety.   Tonight, hell freezes over!   Kellogg took aim. ""You're not sending ME to the COOLER!"" He realized far too late he should have been calm and cool. The empty tap of a locked gun had become the chilling sound of his doom. Watkins unconsciously recoiled and took a few steps back, as the puns began to consume his partner.   Ooh. Talk about your cold shoulder. Well, I suppose the season has come - I'm putting you on ice!   The giant's spider-like tendrils gripped around Kellogg as his bones turned to ice. The monster effortlessly raised his now lifeless corpse into the air and tossed it aside. As it shattered into a thousand pieces, the giant turned its attention to the last survivor.   Let off some steam, Bennett!   ""But that's not even the right mo-"" Watkins' protests were cut short as the giant impaled him in the chest, finally bringing an end to the hailstorm of puns."

Now, he's likely looking at Cumulus clouds, which form at ~2000 ft above sea level, but as low as 1000 ft if it's really cloudy. The tallest building in the US is the Willis Tower in Chicago, at 1451 ft, so you should be safe looking out and down (The Empire State is 1250 ft).

ThePhenomenon,2yvoii,FeatherMerchant,13,Fri Mar 13 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"I think OP is referring to tropes. Like, GoT is so loved because anyone can die. Over time storytellers have kept to a script where certain characters have a high rate of survival/ success and it has sort of become a rule of thumb. So far in your tellings, many characters who showed signs of being the ones who will survive have actually died spontaneously and without preamble (George comes to mind).  It's refreshing, because novelty is important to engaging stories, and by bucking the ""rules"" you have that novelty that humans crave."

ThePhenomenon,2vnsl6,SinisterSpoon,17,Thu Feb 12 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"First, my odds of NOT looking into the sky at the first message, like Eric did? Probably one in four. Curiosity killed the cat, and it'd likely take me out, too. I'm not on the eastern seaboard, but I am in the continental US, so I'll give myself a 30% chance of having the presence of mind to do something about it.  After that? Well, in the wee hours of the morning, I can be pretty sure I'll be in my apartment. That's bad, because it's a garage loft with windows on all sides. If I have the presence of mind to heed the warning message immediately, then I might be able to do something about it. What are the odds that I can get garbage bags covering all the windows before the Phenomenon reaches my location? We don't know the speed of their initial spread, nor have I timed myself covering all external views. The initial figures for casualties are 65%, so it logically follows that 35% of people took adequate measures to protect themselves. Lacking other information, I'm going to use that figure here and give myself a 35% chance that I'll get things done in time.  My current figure is sitting at 10.5%. Not great. Let's cut it in half again, because there's even odds that I wouldn't cover up every external viewing point properly. 5.25%.  After that, it's a matter of supplies. My household consists of me, my girlfriend, and our dog, so that's who I'm worried about sustaining. Even if I haven't gone grocery shopping recently, I've got supplies enough of dry goods to last four days. If I've gone shopping recently and water and power don't get interrupted too badly, we can bump that up as much as two weeks' supplies. (Managing waste also depends largely on water and power working.)  Right now I'm looking at a chance of barely more than one in twenty that I'll last two weeks.  Three months later, the Phenomenon is still going on.  It's at least four days before the first opening is announced in the NYC area, and after that the frequency of openings is unstated, but they don't seem to go long. I live in a residential area, so nearly everywhere I can get to and back and get things from inside 40 minutes is another home. That means dealing with other survivors and/or scavenging other homes for supplies.  If I can assume similar rates of survival and supplies in other households in the area, then every nine days (median of four to fourteen days) one household's supplies will be consumed. With one out of twenty households surviving, the neighborhood's supplies will be consumed in roughly 180 days (the time it would take one household to consume the supplies of twenty households). I don't know when it would end, but with the Phenomenon lasting at least 89 days, I'm going to my odds in half again that I could find a sufficiency of supplies, even without accounting for getting caught in the open during a supply run, or getting shot by another survivor, or developing a fatal illness, or a fire destroying the neighborhood.  I'm looking at survival odds of less than three percent.  Good luck, protagonists."

No cell service out in the country where I live, and I always look out of the window first thing in the morning to help wake up.  Assuming I somehow get a message my odds go up-I have quite a few supplies (month at least of food, and a well for water), a generator, and a fairly powerful ham radio.

The explanation that makes the most sense to me (so far) is that the shards require a 'psychic connection' to their targets to kill and draw out the blood, and this connection can only be made if the target harbors knowledge of the shard's shape (or possibly shapes formed from their intersecting edges, one character does mention that that's the last thing they saw before they stopped breathing).  So, assuming that explanation is correct the answer to ""if told enough details about a shard, would a human be able to imagine it in enough detail to cause death?"" is a resounding maybe.  I can tell you that I have an apple and you can imagine an apple well enough, you can imagine triangles and hexagons and all that, but no matter how many words I used do you think that I would have the descriptive power to make you imagine this in any great detail? I would say it depends on the nature and complexity of the dangerous information.  There is a short story that you may enjoy called BLIT, it deals with similar concepts."

ThePhenomenon,2u6dsn,on_my_lunch_break,2,Fri Jan 30 19:58:00 2015 UTC,They are transparent in IR and UV light.  To trigger the trap they'd have to go by sound or have it be tripped by sensor or something similar.
ThePhenomenon,2u6dsn,SovreignTripod,2,Fri Jan 30 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"You cannot. The point of that sentence is that although you would not be able to visually record the crystal itself, you could get footage of how substances change when they interact with the crystal. So you can still have a degree of visual ""monitoring"" going on in the experiments.   Also, does radar work in such small spaces? Because one could use  radar to monitor position of the shard and infrared to visually observe the environment. Thus effectively being able to monitor most aspects of the testing environment without having direct visual access."

ThePhenomenon,2twcq7,SuperCreativeGT,11,Tue Jan 27 23:21:58 2015 UTC,"Woohoo, three chapters for the price of one! I'm predicting that the temperature drop at the cdc is because of a solar eclipse. It explains the sudden darkness and is much more likely than a spooky alien mothership."
ThePhenomenon,2twcq7,Chewierulz,6,Tue Jan 27 23:44:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't think of that, but it's definitely a possibility. It would however, be the most infuriating elaborate ruse, making us think something super serious was happening with the Phenomenon. :P  I'm still leaning towards the Phenomenon being the cause, and I think the title of the chapter also helps with that idea."
ThePhenomenon,2twcq7,TheRedKIller,5,Wed Jan 28 00:01:48 2015 UTC,"If it was a solar eclipse they would have known about it in advance. Also, the temperature doesn't drop that much during an eclipse."
ThePhenomenon,2twcq7,KianKP,3,Wed Jan 28 10:05:04 2015 UTC,Solar Eclipse doesn't lead to an 8 degree temperature drop in 30 seconds. It's the shards for sure.
ThePhenomenon,2twcq7,Chewierulz,5,Wed Jan 28 21:47:37 2015 UTC,"Well shit. They've blocked out the sun haven't they?  The temperature has suddenly dropped, the wind is still normal, it's completely black outside, and it seems that the Shards are showing more gaps in coverage, if the rather unsuited clothing of the black suit guy and several past chapters is anything to go by.   In the event they have done so, this raises A LOT of questions for me:   What is the true size of the Phenomenon? How are they doing it? Are they completely enclosing the planet like a Dyson Sphere or is something even nutter and crazy the reason? Does this mean that the Phenomenon is truly sentient/controlled?   IMO, I think this shows that the Phenomenon must be sentient or a controlled weapon. Unless this is some kind of hunting instinct to draw prey out or something."
ThePhenomenon,2twcq7,Sithsaber,2,Tue Jan 27 23:57:24 2015 UTC,I think the dreams prove that the phenomenon is sentient enough to send out a type of immeasurable frequency that instills dread in its victims. Even a plant is sentient in some capacity.  http://www.politicsforum.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=92&t=151360&start=20 A long banned internet buddy of mine might have played with a similar concept. My guess is that the phenomenon is being caused by technodemons of the air.  Ps. Read the first post in the link. You don't have to digest all that crazy.

I'm more concerned with the voices appearing in those dreams. I think the Shards trying to communicate with humanity, but can only do so on certain levels, like mimicking the beat of Sharon's punches (basic, primitive level) or invading the exposed subconscious while people are asleep, as seen with Sharon and Timor."

What if Emil wasn't looking for her, but her supplies? It seems a little convienent he knew she was in the trunk, although he didn't seem startled she was there, so perhaps he has good intentions.  Also, on the line:   blinding light flooded in blinding her.   It seems redundant to mention blinding twice."
ThePhenomenon,2thgtb,DOESNT_FAP_EVER,7,Sat Jan 24 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"Also, on the line: blinding light flooded in blinding her.  It seems redundant to mention blinding twice.   This is what I get for making do without an editor. It will be corrected."

ThePhenomenon,2t8zc0,SuperCreativeGT,9,Thu Jan 22 03:25:36 2015 UTC,Blinding yourself to survive? That's a double-edged sword if I ever heard one. Maybe the blindness is only temporary?
ThePhenomenon,2t8zc0,TheRedKIller,3,Thu Jan 22 03:30:11 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't he just put on a blindfold?
ThePhenomenon,2t8zc0,SuperCreativeGT,3,Fri Jan 23 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Heh, I was thinking the same thing. I guess self-mutilation is out of the question, so how did he get blinded? I think the next most likely thing would be a lab accident."
ThePhenomenon,2t8zc0,Jam_Onscreen,3,Fri Jan 23 05:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well on physical contact, the phenomenon has a burn like effect. maybe he was attacked by the phenomenon and survived"
ThePhenomenon,2t8zc0,jackg22,7,Sat Jan 24 08:36:41 2015 UTC,"Just binge-read all up to date today. It seems to me that he was blinded between day 37 and day 55, may have been an injury from a mutiny? People were already not happy about the whole holding-out situation and there's mention of them ditching their posts, which makes sense if they just decided to bail when they found out what Project-related things were on their way, hence why Rafei is alone when Jesse shows up.  My question is, are the people from the car the Project personnel that Rafei called back? If so, why did it take 88 days?"

Although, I guess it could be something similar to Solaris, the Phenomenon simply exist and communicate in such a way that we are too incompatible.  It might explain why they actively avoid damaging air vehicles, but not the whole 'draining your body of blood and water' thing.

ThePhenomenon,2sdoi2,jezalenko,12,Wed Mar 4 07:53:37 2015 UTC,"So, we know that aircraft are safe from the Phenomenon, and that Air Force One didn't crash immediately. The Project is still mysterious.  They actively avoid engines and high speed parts? This development is disturbing, but I may have a response. We've been operating under the assumption that the shards are indestructible. What if they're not, and any damage caused has either been negligible (kinetics, chemical, energy etc.) or unable to cause a visible result (explosives, nukes)?  Visible wavelength light doesn't allow for inspection, and it could simply be that explosives and nukes didn't 'dent' the swarming Phenomenon enough to show up on satellite. Maybe an damage is repaired through cannibalization of broken Shards? We'd never see it if broken Shards still retain their lethality. Maybe they CAN be damaged and this avoidance is self-preservation.  Either that or they're sparing air vehicles. Strange. These are the only two things I can think could be the cause."
ThePhenomenon,2sdoi2,LookitsDante,6,Wed Jan 14 08:21:22 2015 UTC,Maybe they're sparing air vehicles because their prey is inside?...

PFT is the Physical Fitness Test, Sit Ups, Pull ups, and the run.  My enlistment was rather odd. I signed up for tanks, went to Parris Island for Recruit Training, then Knox to be trained for tanks, and was shipped to a tank unit.. That had just had their tanks taken away and told they were converting to Infantry. So I got sent to ITB (Infantry Training Battalion). Only to find out when I got back that the unit needed more Combat Radiomen, the guys with the radios on their backs and the telephone handsets you see in movies.  So I volunteered for that, and then got sent to 29 Palms for MCCES (Marine Corps Communication Electronics School).. And then some other stuff happened and then it was time for me to get out, contract up, decided not to re-enlist.  So I spent four years being trained, evaluated, granted clearance, and figuring out who I was and what responsibility and maturity meant, and then got out, 9/10, 10/10 with rice, would do again (if I was reliving my life)."

Did /u/Emperor_Cartagia ever confirm one way or the other?   If he did and someone knows in what discussion thread, could you let me know?  EDIT: In the Chapter 16 discussion he points out that the blind still move and make noise, implying the Shards were attracted to them and killed them through direct contact, not by the blind ""looking"" at them."
ThePhenomenon,2rxphr,DOESNT_FAP_EVER,5,Sat Jan 10 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it depend on the type of blindness?

But now we know for certain that they interact with normal matter, whether the shards are made out it or not, and that even thin metal will stop them (and most likely is a sufficient barrier to their kill on contact ability).

She'll take Sarya, if not Emil too.  As for the Phenomenon, that's gotta be the most terrifying thing that could have possibly happened. Like shit, it fucking landed RIGHT NEXT to her...  This raises a question about the individual shards though. Did it miss her or was it toying with her? With what I've already said about the observed intelligence of the Phenomenon, I'd lean towards the first. More questions though. How accurate are they in flight?  But this is what I think might be one of the most important questions. If it was going fast enough to miss, then it may be that these Shards are very light as it only made a 'thump'. It seems they cannot break the windows of a car, but possibly 'normal' glass? (See Chapter 24, Jesse mentions broken windows) Either way, they seem to be very light."

Now you and your surviving friends have seen two people drop dead without any outside interference. The window glass never broke, nothing so much as touched them... the only logical conclusion is that something killed them just from them looking at it. Not hard to put together, really.  And then you call your buddy at another lab somewhere else, and you tell him your weird suspicion, and he says that the same thing happened at his lab.

ThePhenomenon,2rgo8e,ixfd64,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I always thought they were large because the people who looked somewhat identified their shapes before they died.

ThePhenomenon,2rfnii,AndySocks,8,Sun Jan 11 07:42:29 2015 UTC,"Realistically, servers would be down. Too many people would be dying at such a high rate in such a short period of time. There would be no time for maintenance.  If the internet were still up, people wouldn't be online and would be trying to connect with family and loved ones.    But for the sake of this post, if there were new posts on the Reddit frontpage, most of them would probably be SOS or even 'cry for help' posts. People would go straight into survivor mode if this event were to occur. You won't see something like:   ""Hey guys, I made an infographic on the top 10 ways to stay alive during the phenomenon. Hope you guys like it.""   on /r/pics.    Rather, you'd see:   ""DESPERATELY NEED HELP. FATHER WITH 1 WIFE, 1 MOTHER, AND 2 DAUGHTERS. NO FOOD. HAVE MEDICATION. ADDRESS: 123 FAKE STREET, CA USA. MY NAME IS JOHN DOE. BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS, OUR ELECTRICITY WILL BE OFF""   on /r/AskReddit.  Many people wouldn't be using Reddit as a form of communication, especially if they wanted to form survivor groups. The internet alone is a place where people are most untrustworthy. Mix that together with the apocalypse - you're just asking to get screwed."
ThePhenomenon,2rfnii,on_my_lunch_break,3,Tue Jan 6 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"Many people wouldn't be using Reddit as a form of communication, especially if they wanted to form survivor groups. The internet alone is a place where people are most untrustworthy.   I don't think this is accurate at all.  Firstly, Reddit already has the infrastructure in place for connecting with local folks who you don't already know personally. Most states and large cities have a subreddit, and as someone who lives in a town where I don't know many people, that would probably be my first choice for reaching out to find other local survivors.  Secondly, I don't think that most people would be more wary of an internet stranger (especially a redditor with a browsable post history) than they would be of any other stranger.  And lastly... how exactly would you go about finding a survivor group WITHOUT using the internet? You can't exactly put a sign outside your house (people won't see it). If you have a working phone and know a lot of local folks, that would probably be a good first bet, but if that fails, what then? It's not like most people have a HAM radio or anything.  The way I see it... if I were in this situation, I'd have two choices: hunker down and survive on my own or go to my local subreddits and try to contact other local people to survive with. And in either case, I'd be going online in order to figure out what the fuck is going on from local reports rather than a creepy-as-fuck emergency broadcast."
ThePhenomenon,2rfnii,KTSK7,6,Tue Jan 6 19:18:13 2015 UTC,I'd guess a lot of info about the phenomenon and tons of help and questions in the different subreddits (if the servers are still running) It could also work as a way to set up survival groups and communicate with the rest of the world. Although I think most posts would come from US and EU before the internet falls apart that is...
ThePhenomenon,2rfnii,Dr_professional,3,Mon Jan 5 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think there would be a lot of people wanting to post stuff since so many people died in the first day (hell, in the first few hours probably) and the ones who didn't probably avoided death because they saw someone else meet their fate and are freaking out to some extent.  At most I think there might be some speculation and arguing about the meaning of the messages. A picture of a dessicated body might be posted on 4chan or reddit and more speculation and arguing would happen. Maybe people would try to comfort each other.  If any of the admins are still alive and care enough they might use the site to try to reach out to people, if only to figure out what the hell is going on. Maybe a similar thing happens at google or amazon, they have data centers all over the world which are mostly windowless and probably staffed 24/7."
ThePhenomenon,2rfnii,on_my_lunch_break,1 point,Tue Jan 6 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think there would be a lot of people wanting to post stuff   Every time there's a tragedy or major world event, especially something tragic and double-especially something that's got an element of mystery, people go NUTS about it on Reddit. For example, think about the Boston Bombing, MH370, or Ebola.  My guess is that there would be less overall traffic on Reddit, but a HUGE spike in Phenomenon-related posts. I doubt anyone would be posting to /r/AdviceAnimals or /r/funny, but you can bet they'd be posting to /r/worldnews, and there would probably be an /r/thephenomenon created within hours, if not minutes, to discuss what was happening. There would probably also be a spike in traffic on grief/death related subreddits, /r/anxiety, and similar subreddits as a coping mechanism."

I would make a link to the sub-reddit but I rarely post so I don't know how make links. It has a great community and great and interesting creatures to share. You should check them out.  Edit: /r/SCP
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,TheMadridBaleOut,11,Mon Jan 5 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"Vector A is pretty much my current theory, and is kinda similar to the SCP Foundation's ideas of memetic kill devices. I agree with this.As for Vector B, I was under the assumption that it was physical contact killing the blind, but now that I think about it, that might be wrong. TBH, I don't think any blind people without other human assistance would last long anyway.  Your proposition is interesting, but I personally don't think so. It's not shown any signs of intelligence yet, although I guess it could always be faking it. And as for the test, it's an interesting idea and it may help us identify the kill device. Problem is, we need the survivors to test it. cough /u/Emperor_Cartagia cough  EDIT Hey, I was wondering if you might want to add this to the Google Doc we have going? We've got a lot of speculation there already and it'd be a great addition."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Chewierulz,2,Mon Jan 5 04:10:54 2015 UTC,"You can move it over to the doc if you want. That's fine.    It's not shown any signs of intelligence yet.    Almost by it's very existence it must have some sort of swarm intelligence (ant colony style) or, more likely, be the creation of a more advanced species.   There is simply no good reason why evolution would ever produce something like this. They almost certainly capable of targeted interstellar travel. The odds of something like this simply finding earth is extremely low."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,TheRedKIller,2,Mon Jan 5 04:16:40 2015 UTC,"But if they were built by aliens they would have to be intelligent enough to program them to travel to our planet. If they could do that why wouldn't they take the time to  make them more advanced. For example they could have been programmed to hide until everyone comes out, or force themselves into buildings. Based on what they do now they seem to have no intelligence to do any of that."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Chewierulz,5,Mon Jan 5 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"It's a somewhat useless exercise to try and determine the logic behind the actions of potential alien species, simply because we are so unfamiliar with their culture and objectives that we can't determine how they might approach a problem.   Furthermore, we aren't sure what their objectives even are. This could be a targeted extinction level event, or simply a child in an ultra-advanced society that has nothing to do between lunch breaks."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Alietum,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"What I meant by that is that they are not showing intelligence besides the swarming/hunting. It's been proven they will give up on prey if it stays quiet/cold (even though a more intelligent creature might know it was still there, and with the sheer numbers of the Shards, they could theoretically break through a barricade (if they even have a mass). It seems to me that their level of intelliegnce is no more than a swarm of ants or similar insects."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Cerebral_Harlot,3,Mon Jan 5 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well, we at least know they interact with matter. Or at least, by what has been written, it is safe to assume.   They made sounds when hitting the building and door at the reptile house.   They brought down a plane. It could be said the they killed the pilot, but generally at altitude the planes fly themselves. Unless Air Force One was landing at Denver, the pilot's death should not have brought the plane down. But shares in the engines would.   And I think we can infer because walls act as a barrier. If they did not interact with matter (or at least interact very little), like, say, neutrinos, they would just phase through our walls and barriers in search of us.   So just by nature that a shard, by interacting with the world around it, puts force on an object, enough of them would surely be able to break through the windshield of a running car, or a window on a building. Hell, nukes don't stop these things and they fly exceptionally fast. I'm sure if they really wanted to they could puncture through concrete and brick.   Even ants will try to burrow through objects in search of food."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,I_have_no_throwaway,2,Mon Jan 5 05:10:05 2015 UTC,"I do like the theory that these are tools specifically meant to target the human race, especially since it is tailored to the human visible light spectrum. You are assuming that the aliens want to do this quickly or all in one go. Perhaps they have centuries to accomplish this task. Perhaps this is only phase one, its called the phenomenon not the shards, perhaps another tool will take care of those living underground and stuff."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,ThePrettyOne,3,Mon Jan 5 06:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it can be something about the shape of the shards that is lethal. Any kind of video couldn't capture the shape exactly because of the pixellation of the image. There are also other problems, such as how humans can die from looking at a cloud of them miles away, without seeing any kind of definite shape."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,JamesTiberiusChirp,3,Mon Jan 5 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"This was my initial thought as well, but I keep running into the problem of ""what other information could on this image?""   There simply ins't anything else that would make sense.   In theory, if images of the objects are lethal, that you should be able to copy it pixel by pixel, with someone staring at it, and after a particular pixel is filled, they simply... die. There is no other data that a human eye could gather. Something about the object's visual appearance is lethal.   I fear this may be the result of a slightly underdeveloped storyline, as I doubt he intended to extend it this far, but I hope there is a reasonable explanation."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,KaneinEncanto,3,Mon Jan 5 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"It's precisely this line of thinking that has me questioning our basic assumptions. I share your fear, that the story just doesn't hold up to scrutiny, but it's so well written so far and there's so much we don't know, I'm going to cling to the hope that we'll all be satisfied in the end.  With that hope in mind, here are a few basic assumptions we're all taking for granted:  1) The shards are alien in origin, and not supernatural in origin. The story shows researchers going at this thing scientifically, so we as readers are primed for a science-fictiony resolution, but there's no guarantee that we're not dealing with the hand of God, or gods, or whatever.  2) The world as perceived by the characters is real. It may be cliche in a post-The Matrix world, but there are a lot of real people who worry that our universe is a simulation. If the universe of The Phenomenon is, it would be completely reasonable for indirect observation of the shards to be just as lethal as direct observation.  Other things to think about (but do not explain Vector A or Vector B [at least not directly]):  3) The information we get from the Emergency Alert System is correct. While I trust what we're told from Eric and Millie (they are black shards that swarm and kind of interlock sometimes), we're basically trusting the US government that they descended from space on the eastern seaboard, rather than originating from the eastern seaboard.  4) The shards exist as 3-dimensional objects. Given that they seem to have no mass and are unaffected by most things, they could either be 2-d or projections from higher-dimensional objects.  5) Whoever recovers the hard drive from Air Force One after the Phenomenon is over is a surviving human."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Dr_professional,1 point,Mon Jan 5 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"4) The shards exist as 3-dimensional objects. Given that they seem to have no mass and are unaffected by most things, they could either be 2-d or projections from higher-dimensional objects.   The shards make scratching sounds against objects they surround. Therefore they must be 3D objects, or whoever is projecting them is also projecting realistic sound effects."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Emperor_Cartagia,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"An object on a higher dimension would have a 3d component. Take the example from flatworld...a sphere passing through their plane of existence would appear to them as a circle,  growing in size at first, then shrinking until it had completely passed through.   Though if you apply the same reasoning to 3d, and a higher dimension being, you'd assume that any structural barriers to us would mean nothing to them either.   It's for that last reason I've kinda ruled out the idea of then bring higher dimensional beings...at least personally."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,metalgearRAY477,3,Tue Jan 6 06:07:27 2015 UTC,"Given that, after brain death, blood is presumably teleported out of the body I don't think the effect is mind poison. Though I suppose the initial kill mechanism might be mind poison, that doesn't explain the other weirdness.  From my comment here:   The way I see it there are two (not necessarily exclusive) possibilities:   Something about the phenomenon (the shape of the shards, the way they move) is infohazardous, having some piece of information in your head causes the exceptional effects to occur. [...] The information is, for lack of a better word, cursed, knowing the information causes the effect. There are a specific series of actions and/or conditions that cause the effect. Again, for lack of a better example, think of bloody marry. If the right conditions are met and the right actions are performed bloody marry kills you. The idea is that there is some action, or interaction, with the phenomenon or information related to the phenomenon that brings its effects upon you.    Basically I think It's either an infohazard or a cognitohazard, if its the latter then the effects of viewing pictures might be explained by images inheriting properties of the phenomenon in an ""an image of an angel becomes an angel"" sort of way.    This is the only mention of the effects of the phenomenon on the blind:   blind subjects who'd encountered the phenomenon died similarly, though the point of physical contact also showed signs of severe burns, though nothing showed up on IR sensors.   Reading it again it seems like they died from touching it. I feel like both I and /u/TheMadridBaleOut have made a lot of assumptions based on the idea that the blind are affected by looking at it, if this were not the case I know it would swing me back in the direction of infohazard.  Can /u/Emperor_Cartagia confirm / deny that the blind subjects died from physical contact, not ""looking"" at the phenomenon and/or were discovered with burns on their bodies?"

ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,GrepekEbi,3,Mon Jan 5 06:42:06 2015 UTC,"I wonder, if seeing the shadow of one of the shards would be enough to kill. As one passed by an open window,  say,  if the shadow was cast onto a wall opposite the window, and of course presuming you were, say laying below the window out of line of sight, would you survive seeing the shadow on the wall...  If the shadow is enough to kill, I'd assume some sort of telepathic detection of its own shape and position are at play. If not, there is something else to their appearance that causes detection/death to occur."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,iarespiff,3,Tue Jan 6 06:12:30 2015 UTC,"Vector A is missing a third possibility, in my opinion: That forming eye contact with the shard(s) gives them some kind of access to your brain/body. And by that, I mean: how do we know that it's a one-way street, and that information coming from the shard into your eye is what causes the death?   If anyone has seen the most recent Doctor Who Christmas special, this theory might sound familiar: What if having the visual image of shard(s) in your mind gives them some kind of psychic access that allows them to kill you?  I'm on my way out the door, so I don't have time to elaborate further, but if anyone wants to prod me with questions, I'm happy to answer on_my_lunch_break ;)"
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Cerebral_Harlot,5,Tue Jan 6 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"My current head-canon is that it's nothing particular about the shape or the colour of the shards, but more that an accurate image/idea of them within a victim's brain gives the shard a ""way in"" telepathically.  I think the shards have some telepathic ability, but they lack some other senses (such as sight). They only know you're there if you're thinking about them, and you can only think about them in any meaningful way if you know what they look like (as we're such a visual species)  The blind seem to die from touch, which I would suggest is a secondary means for the shards to ""find you"", as in they know you're there so they can launch their telepathic attack.   I think swarming around heat/light sources is like us tracking prey, but they need that image within a victims mind to be able to properly determine our position, ""take the shot"" and paralyse us.   From that, i would guess they drink the blood/fluids in some way, although this seems to involve teleporting the fluids out rather than directly feeding..."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Cerebral_Harlot,2,Mon Jan 5 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"Thays good speculation. I hadn't thought of that before. Honestly, it's the only thing that makes sense with the whole ""dying from a recording"" thing."
ThePhenomenon,2rd6w4,Arsonade,2,Mon Jan 5 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I am a fan of the ""Deadly Shape"" theory. Mainly since the phenomenon has an effect that responds to our two senses most used to ascertain shape; those senses being sight and touch. Though there may be a simpler way to capture its shape other than digital imaging. I am thinking that it might be more practical to capture the shadow or silhouette of one of the shards. It would be a shape completely devoid of color."
