vfx,3e4xy9,brooklynOG,4,Wed Jul 22 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"In my experience the work in LA is mostly commercial or pre-vis and also post-vis (like pre-vis but done after the shoot.)  The feature film vfx work has left LA for Vancouver.  I would assume its only a matter of time before the pre-vis work leaves LA for Vancouver as well.  There's commercial work in LA, but it will really help if you already know artists working at commercial studios in LA.  My opinion as a compositor looking for work in LA without many connections is that it's pretty tough right now and I wouldn't advise you to come to LA if you have steady work in NY.  I guess if you really want to work in pre-vis LA might be worth it, but who knows how long that work will be here."

vfx,3dsvf4,Medmehrez,8,Sun Jul 19 03:19:42 2015 UTC,One third of your video is an intro. People aren't interested in an exceptionally long channel intro– try taking it down to one second instead of ten.
vfx,3dsvf4,E6H,6,Sun Jul 19 21:55:54 2015 UTC,"Good stuff...  I made something similar as a test  https://vimeo.com/96520618   Direction of light: I feel like the number one thing that makes VFX shots feel ""real"" is matching the direction of light to your background plate. You lit the plane top down, but the clouds are very side/edged with light. I think shot would look better if the plane was very dark but only rimmed with light. Matching focal length: Your cloud BG plate looks like it would be a very long lens camera, but the camera on the model looks very wide. Up your mm from 35, 50, 75, 100 etc to something that feels real. Over color grading: don't over color grade your shots to hide bad compositing. I'm not saying your composite is bad, but I see this a lot with demo reels. Your shot is at night right? Make the most realistic night shot possible, and then do whatever color grading you want. I feel like a lot of people color grade the shit out of their composite to try to make the shot look ""better"". Again, realistic shots come back to direction of light. Use reference photos and match it up as close a possible, then you can augment the reality you are creating.   Just my 2 cents"

vfx,3dsvf4,Sloore,5,Mon Jul 20 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"It's a good start, but your lighting is where things need to be worked on.  The aircraft should be shinier.  As was said, the lighting should be primarily around the edges, and the highlights on the fuselage should be sharper.  Even if there are some soft highlights on the plane, there should still be some reflections and even some brighter highlights that are sharp.  Look at some reference footage or photos of airliners at night, especially ones during magic hour.  The windows should be a different material than the fuselage(something glossy, this is glass remember), this would be most noticeable on the windscreen.  The lights on the aircraft should also be more exposed and noticeable.  If this were a real plane being shot by a real camera, the exposure would be set in such a way that the lights on the plane would appear far brighter.  Also, the sun isn't competing with them as much, so the wings should be getting more illumination from those red and green lights than they currently are.  Same goes for the fire.  In your shot, it looks like the parts of the plane lit by the fire actually get darker, when the opposite should be true.  If you are going for documentary style with the camera work, then you should have a brief ""auto-focus lag"" when you zoom in.  Pretty much when you zoom in, everything should be thrown out of focus for like a half a second and then the plane comes into focus again.  Really, use reference materials to see how this kind of thing would look in real life.  Photos or footage of airplanes and fire at night, home video footage so you can get an idea of how the camera should look, etc."

vfx,3drlay,bumbaz,11,Sat Jul 18 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"Roto! Enjoy.   It's rarely necessary to actually model everything in the scene for proper occlusion. Only model stuff that needs to be shadowed or affected in some way by your animation. If you have multiple cg elements going in front and behind different real elements, you can re-project your roto and cg onto cards and set them at the appropriate z-depth in the scene (say trees in a forest for example). For further precision and complexity when combining things in depth, you can look into ""deep"" compositing in nuke..... But sounds like all you need is roto :-)  Edit: info  Deep compositing is useful when combining hundreds of elements and automatically handling what goes in front or behind what. It's completely overkill for what you're doing now...all you need is a bit of roto and maybe some reprojection."
vfx,3drlay,rotoshake,5,Sat Jul 18 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"It depends, usually on what's easier and most cost effective. If it's a quick roto, do that. But the cleanest way would be to model everything that your stuff interacts with so you can get proper holdouts. You might even project the plate on that geo to get proper reflections and bounce lighting from them.  However, a VFX supervisor would be thinking about how to tackle these issues before shooting even begins. If there's lots of interaction with a prop for some scenes, it might be simpler to remove the prop and replace it with a CG one. Or use a locked off camera and shoot a clean plate. Or use a motion controlled camera to do it. Depends on the desired outcome and the budget."

But the line across the bottom of the chart and the interior is all colors that can only exist as mixtures."

vfx,3dkols,originalusername99,2,Fri Jul 17 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"Good job man! Looks nice but one thing I'd suggest is that since you have a lot of fire in your video, maybe instead of using after effects particles to simulate fire, try FumeFX. Or stock footage fire. It'd be nice to use FumeFX or stock footage for the smoke as well but you did a good job on the smoke so you can get away with that. I really like the heat distortions though! Really helps sell the fire.  Also in some parts, especially at 01:35, the particles stand out way too much. Try bringing the opacity or the thickness down a touch. You want them to be visible but something that adds tone/atmosphere to the scene, not something that catches your eye too much and distracts you from the rest of the scene.   For the Earth sequence in the beginning, try using high quality textures. Especially for the cloud atmosphere. Will make you Earth look better!   When the asteroid hits the Earth's surface both in space and near the ocean, think of adding a spherical ""shock wave"" too. It will help give your scene a little more dimension and will also look cooler. Love the HUD display!  I hope these help."
vfx,3dkols,Plkt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:29:02 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the really good feedback. I was considering getting into FumeFX somewhere along the line. I know this is a super clique question, but where do you suggest getting some good fire stock footage? I have my sources, but it never hurts to ask for new ideas. I agree with you on everything, also for the asteroid impact I actually had a slight displacement map on the shock-wave, but it wasn't spherical, and it got toned down a bit in post. Thanks for the suggestion. The clouds too, I actually used Gaussian blur on them, hence, zero sharpness! And the HUD idea is new to me, but I did my best. Thanks again for the input!"
vfx,3dkols,Plkt,2,Fri Jul 17 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help, man. And to get some good fire stock footage I would highly recommend investing in Action Essentials 2. It's a stock footage pack by Video Copilot that has really good keyed out fire footage along with a bunch of other elements like water splashes, muzzle flashes, explosions, particles, dust etc. It's really great!  If not that, you can also just Youtube fire stock footage. There are a lot of videos that give you pre-keyed, royalty free fire stock footage to use. You can just download the video, sort through the different fire clips they have in it and use whatever you want. You can also just google free fire stock footage and it will show you some websites that provide free stock footages. Some of them might not be that great looking, both aesthetically and quality wise, but it's something.  Hope this helps."
vfx,3dkols,munasef,2,Sat Jul 18 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"If stock footage is the way you want to go, you could try Video Copilot. But I would not rely to heavly on it, as it has a certain, well known aestetic and feel to it that a lot of people instantly recognize. It is nothing wrong with using stock footage, but if you want to take it to the next level, stock footage will only bring you so far..."

vfx,3dj32x,lolzarius,3,Thu Jul 16 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, some people here are kind of brutal when it comes to approval but don't let that get you down.  Minus the wave speed being too fast and lacking foam, the biggest problem is that what you've used to displace the plane for the wave effect has a very cubic pattern to it and because of that doesn't look very realistic.   If you'd like to take that next step into creating realistic waves, look into getting a demo for RealFlow and trying out Hybrido. In RF instead of trying to emulate waves using animated displacement powered by textures like in C4D, you dial in your fluid settings and RF will simulate that fluid which looks far better. If you've never used a node based workflow it can be kind of confusing at first, but if you try it out you'll find that it offers a lot of flexibility and is super easy to use. Hope this helps. :)"

vfx,3dbb33,dangerousbrew,28,Tue Jul 14 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"The best artists that I've worked with had four things.   Artistic skill, not just software skill. They were photographers, painters, sculptors, animators. The computer was a tool to them. I see too many kids focusing on learning Maya and Nuke, but not enough time learning how to be an artist.  Forward thinking. Yes, you could sit there and be a render monkey, but great artists will try to solve problems rather than wait for someone to solve it for them. I had a compositor try a 3d warping technique in Flame when all we needed was a little parallax on a stationary shot looking top-down from a building. It's shit like this that will make you stand out. Work ethic. This doesn't mean that you have to work yourself to death, but if I put 20 shots on your plate, I don't want to see you waiting 30min for your pre-renders. Send that to the farm and get started on the next shot. Follow the submission procedure, name your files correctly, do all the boring stuff because it's part of your job as well. Learn how to take notes. It was rare when I had an artist who didn't take notes, and that's because they would never last long in a facility."

You tell a Nuke guy I don't think that works can you do x they grumble and just do it. Say the same to a 3d guy and he hears 'i hate you and your art is shit'.   To be fair the change usually ruins an hour of a Nuke guys day and a weekend of the 3d guys life so that's probably part of it.

Great artists present solutions to the VFX supe.  They'll hit the shot notes then if there's time in the schedule they'll plus out the shot with their own ideas.  More importantly, great artists make the whole team work better.  On the artistic side that involves doing lookdev and creating generic setups.

vfx,3dd803,petersid7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"If you use the RGB output of the IBK, you are using the IBK for despill. If this is the case, the output of the IBK is premultiplied. You can combine multiple premultiplied extractions together using Keymix nodes.  If you use the output of the IBK for it's alpha only, you are doing your despill using other methods, in which case you are likely despilling your plate (unpremultiplied), and then premultiplying your despilled plate by your IBK (or combined) alpha.  Both methods are valid and useful to know. Which is preferable depends on the circumstance. Using the IBK for despill and extraction is simpler and less flexible. For simple plates it can work great. For other plates with lots of green spill on your FG or other issues, the IBK won't output useable pixels in the RGB for the despill and you will have to use other techniques."

If you zoom in you can see the links are actually sliding over the skin, and the body itself is moving slightly.  The gif is obviously a loop that runs approx. 1 second, at which point it is blended back to frame 1.  So the artist may have recorded the model taking off the chainmail, and used that as a source to chop into pieces and reassemble into what you see here. If you look at the top of the head you can see that there are ""segments"" of the motion, which leads me to think it was all stitched together in parts.  I haven't delved too much into the creation of cinemagraphs, but I know that it can be done with basic After Effects tools (warps, corner pins, and lots and lots of careful roto / masking)"

It has the look of being some kind of painted on filter, where the user can maybe ""paint"" over a figure, or create some kind of vector path, that the computer then reinterprets as p-frames (the directional pixel frames in between keyframes for compressed video).

I noticed that a couple of his other gifs were just him warping between pictures, like those face morphs you see people do between celebrities and stuff. And I thought it looked kind of similar, so I checked out some basic tools online, and I think maybe he's manipulating those to do it. Those effects don't just blend and move areas, they also warp and smooth the transition in ways that a simple mask or warp alone wouldn't. I wonder if instead of using the face points as intended he's just selecting areas and moving them."

Trailer VFX, especially on a movie that far out, are almost never anything close to final.   Usually it's some bullshit rush job because the client didn't bother letting you know that shot bs.2100 was going to be in the trailer and BTW due in 2 days. What?

And every single trailer, some nerd crawls onto reddit and starts moaning about the quality of the VFX.  They even bitched about the color grading on Jurassic World's trailers. They're still bitching about it actually.  When it's confined to subreddits where no one knows jack shit (like /r/movies) it's one thing.

But he's not going to get an affordable camera without rolling shutter artifacts of a degree that will effect tracking, to some appreciable degree, at least not until the new Micro from BMD comes out (whenever that is).  I think the next cheapest option might be the D16.  Personally, I'd rather deal with wobble in a pristine image that can stand up to more manipulation than one with wobble, macro-blocking and the accompanying temporal-spatial geometric distortion.    One of the projects I'm on right now was shot on a consumer camera and features that look, to a human, mildly coherent from frame-to-frame give every tracker I've thrown at it the finger.

Insane video quality with a 50 Mbps codec built in. I'd recommend a Sony RX10 Mark II which is coming out very soon. In built 4K which will help with motion tracking because there will be so much more detail. Also has a log video mode which helps capture more dynamic range in video mode.

If someone is learning and doesn't want to be spending most of their time tracking they're better off shooting as high a quality 1080P video as they can versus consumer 4K that's compressed as hell.  I shoot 155-175Mbit 1080P on my GH2 and high quality 422, for 1080P, is on the order of 200-220Mbit.  The 4K, for instance, from the GH4, has all kinds of macroblocking."

It's even got a first and third act that pay off pretty nicely. I get that this was a harder video to make, with resources and more people doing vfx. Whereas this was probably done by one guy, and good job, guy.

My current impression in terms of professional industry standards here are:  Film/TV Compositing : Nuke.   Motion Graphics : After Effects, Cinema4D, sometimes also Maya.  FX/Crowd : Massive, Houdini, Maya  Camera Tracking : 3D Equalizer   Nothing's wrong with Using After Effects and Cinema4D as an indie artist (that's how I started). But I think, even despite C4D's ease of use - Looking back, if I had learnt some Maya back then it would be more useful to me now. Maya's everyone, so I'd recommend learning that if you decide you want to move your 3D knowledge towards something that will get you a job in film/tv.  And again, AE will be fine for indie projects though if you decide to move your comping towards an industry-level in order to look to start a career, learn Nuke. Ultimately, your knowledge of basic operations and ability to create good compositions are the key skills - but it helps to know how to use the software, and to develop an understanding of how certain bits of software operate (Nuke is a very different process to After Effects).  So in short : AE and C4D are decent entry points into both fields. If you discover 3D/2D are things you want to get more serious about, then Maya and Nuke are worth a look."
vfx,3d9e19,aretoon,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:34 2015 UTC,Maya is probably the best bet for an all-around 3D program.  It has access to all of the most used renderers and plugins used in vfx.  Then you'll also want to learn nuke.  That's the compositing package of choice for most studios.

Even if you shoot with a 1/1000 second shutter speed, there is no guarantee that the top and bottom of the image will be exposed in the same 1/1000th second, just that they will be expose within the same frame time.  So shooting at a higher frame rate can potentially reduce the effect when exposure won't."

Since I assume you used after effects for everything I'd make a point to realize your limitations. The fireballs and their trail look nice at a distance, but without some software like fumefx and a lot of render time you don't have enough detail in your smoke to have it pass so close to camera and make it believable.  The ash/snow looks like it is a flat plane, just passing by in front of the camera. You need to add more depth, smaller particles as distance grows. This would also add atmosphere, the further an object is away, the softer it's colors are going to be because of all the partials in front of it - this you would want to do manually. Plus, I'd imagine the particals passing that close to camera are going to be out of focus, have a camera dictate your depth of field will help a lot with that.  Last, the meteor that hits in the ocean would look a lot better with a large splash, it just hits with smoke, needs an impact. The one that hits the Statue of Liberty really sells it, that's a good example.  Your sky replacement and color grade look really nice, that's good work. The video as a whole is good, these are just the large and small details I've seen that you need to make it all 'work'.  Keep doing what you're doing, it looks good"

Thanks again."
vfx,3d0fn0,IWillBeFamousSomeDay,2,Mon Jul 13 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"No problem. VFX really comes down to the smallest details. Humans are so good at detecting something doesn't feel right, that's why the uncanny valley has always been such an issue. Someone that doesn't know VFX would see this video and know it's not real, but most likely wouldn't be able to explain why...they'd say something just...isn't right.  Now photo realism is an absurd thing to hit - even the biggest best Hollywood films have trouble pulling it off. You just want to get as close as you can.  It all comes down to looking at what your doing and analyzing what you're seeing to find out what is wrong - which are the suggestions I've made. If a comet passed that close to the camera, would it be in focus? Would the camera shake from the force? Would there be a flash of light? Would the smoke stop after the flame like it does in the video or would the airflow the comet is creating carry the smoke with it? Can't make that happen? Find a better place within your software/abilities for that effect.   Like I said it is the small details that sell. One small detail you made was after the sky replacement adding the brightness of the atmosphere above the buildings. THAT is small, but makes a HUGE difference in sky replacement. It's the things that aren't noticed that sell your effect."

If you do a lot of RT rendering on a gpu based render, consider investing in a quadro(if you need that double precision)/ recent gtx card. If not, get sth, like a 780 and you're set. CPU wise, many people (me included) use Xeons on a server Board that supports EEC ram, though that is something you really do not need if you're not a heavy user. A recent i7, maybe overlocked (if proper cooled) and however the amount of ddr3  ram you feel is suited for your needs. Eg. Nuke can get extremely ram intensive if working at 2k and above.  Maybe write a line or two about what you are actually doing vfx wise, and then people can help you better."
vfx,3cumjl,munasef,2,Fri Jul 10 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"Munasef has given you perfect advice. It's unfortunate that you can't salvage anything from your previous computer. The pcpartpicker list is very good, but I've just finished an upgrade of my own and will suggest the x99 board and cpu over the other.  I too do a LOT of compositing and a little 3D with a lot of standard cutting, so what you'll need is a fast CPU. (What're you using to composite? I stick with Mocha/AE). Xeon is better than x99 but much pricier. I'm using the bottom of the barrel 5820k, OCed to 4.5ghz (cooled with H100i -- the cooler becomes more important if you're OCing (though, if you get a water cooler, make sure your case can fit it (I'm using the Arc Midi R2))) and it rips through everything I throw at it. Those extra cores are crucial for efficiently rendering previews and dealing with HD footage. If you're unfamiliar with OCing, get the Asus mobo because it has a user friendly suite that will OC to something stable and fast. I'd say stick with Asus anyway. I'm not doing SLI and I have my own network card, so I went for the x99-a which satisfies all my needs, yet is inexpensive. Another important aspect for fast performance is to have an SSD for your cache/video previews. The read/write times of effects won't be hindered by a slow hdd. My setup is: 250gb SSD for OS/programs; 500gb SSD for cache / misc docs (my music &c); and a few big hdds for original video files/project files/backups.  The EVGA G2 750W PSU is essentially the best out there for your needs, so stick with that. Even if you plan to SLI some day, those G2s are terrific.  GTX780 has more CUDA cores than anything else, though the 980, with just a few less, is supposed to be the next best thing for us or better. For your needs, the 780 will be more than enough. Using AE never taxes my GPU. AE has a list of the effects that are GPU intensive. Otherwise, it's essentially all CPU. Any RT 3D CGI rendering will begin to tax the GPU.   And finally, DDR4 RAM is what you'll need for x99 build. It's new, so a bit pricy. But I guess it's supposed to be better than DDR3 though from what I've read they're comparable. Get as much of it as you can.  Best of luck! Please update us with your decisions."

vfx,3cumjl,nekura_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Xeon is the CPU family. X99 is the chipset. Xeons are the same die you'll find in some of the consumer chips, but they are binned. The 5820 is not bottom of the barrel, and you will often find many people recommending it for games.   Xeon will often be worse bc a good portion of our soft still does not scale with more procs, so you are sacrificing core speed for more procs.    On DDR4 your choices are going to be limited until August when Skylake comes out. You will see many more options, faster speed and hopefully reduced prices.  Also, most of the tools in maya are single precision fp32, so again a gaming card will be better. I think Octane uses some fp64."

I haven't read anyone recommend the Haswell-E cpus for gaming as, as you mentioned, games and programs won't take advantage of the extra procs. If anything, most advice I've read tells gamers to stay away from x99 in favor of something like the 4790k. For the work OP and I do, more procs are a godsend. For Maya, you're right, at least one really great gpu is required.  But I don't know. I could totally be off base about all of this. Like I said, I don't do heavy animating."

vfx,3cw3np,NeedsMoreTests,5,Sun Jul 12 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Is there much in the way of demand for Houdini artists? And is it a viable career choice?   Generally speaking, yes to both.  But, it never hurts to branch out so even if there's not demand learning something like Houdini can help augment the way you think about effects in other applications too.   Anyone with experience know what the learning curve is like?   You sound like you're already familiar with node based workflows so the hard part is probably over with.  The next hardest thing will be understanding how data moves though the various parts of Houdini and what you can, and can't, manipulate at different times.  Personally speaking I wouldn't call learning Houdini hard but it will probably be more time consuming than you're used to and will require a deeper technical knowledge of the application than say Maya or Nuke might.   Will I have to learn scripting to be employable?   To be employable no maybe not but it will probably depend on the studio.  To be more competitive with others using Houdini, probably yes.  Why?  Because if you're not using expressions you don't get as much control or non-deterministic behavior in your sims which make it harder to get the effect you want.  Plus if you're at a studio that does a lot of scripting or uses custom digital assets you'll get a better understanding of how things work if you can understand the code behind it.  Learning scripting is not such much about syntax as it is about learning to think a little differently.  Plus learning scripting in general, especially Python, can really benefit you in other applications too.   ... And if so, which would be the best to learn?   Python is the main language for most things beyond channel references.  If it were me, I'd learn things in this order:   hscript - Mainly to learn how to write simple expressions.  Things like channel referencing and simple math expressions are going to be the biggest benefit.  I think learning this first will also help with understanding some of the internals in Houdini. Python - Can do pretty much everything hscript does plus a lot more.  It can also be used in places that you really can't effectively use hscript. VEX - A language similar to C often used to write custom shaders.  I'd focus more on getting a grasp on what VEX can do and some simpler use cases though at least until you're more familiar with coding and Houdini in general.    Bonus question, is there something I should learn before/instead of Houdini?   I would have said Nuke to get the hang of node based workflows.  So aside from that, maybe learn how to move data in and out of Houdini?  Then take that data and try reading and writing to it in Nuke and Maya?  It may seem like extra work but it could help to point out the basics of data flow and teach you some of the differences between the applications. I'd also take a look at SideFx's getting started documentation, it's pretty detailed and will probably give you a good overview of the various kinds of 'networks' Houdini has and how the fit together."
vfx,3cw3np,kyoseki,2,Sat Jul 11 14:38:38 2015 UTC,"VEX isn't just for shaders, most geometry operators I build (which is the whole point of using Houdini as far as I'm concerned) are implemented in VEX and DOPs is moving in that direction, Houdini is moving more and more towards a pure VEX based workflow - all the wrangle nodes that are getting heavily used these days are essentially just inline VEX operators.  hscript & python are for automation (I barely know hscript, I almost never have any reason to use it), if you want to actually use Houdini to it's greatest, you NEED to know VEX."

vfx,3cw3np,BurnetRhoades,3,Sat Jul 11 23:40:10 2015 UTC,Houdini is a completely different way of thinking to Maya. It has a pretty steep learning curve too. There seems to be lots work around if you can pick it up though.  I think it's better to learn Houdini without any preconception about how 3D software should work.

vfx,3cw3np,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's better to learn Houdini without any preconception about how 3D software should work.   I don't think this is accurate really.  Perhaps if you learned one package and your whole perception of how the software should work was based on that one tool, this might be the case.  The biggest hangup will be thinking about problem solving as a series of methodical steps.  Proceduralism isn't just about being node based it's about breaking down the problem into a series of smaller steps and being fully aware of each step beyond this-button-does-something and working plink-plink-drag towards some final goal.  Prior to using Houdini since about v2 I'd been using Prisms for nearly six year, the precursor to Houdini.  It used a process stack workflow versus nodes but otherwise was still procedural.  Prior to hitching my wagon to Prisms I'd used Softimage, Alias PowerAnimator + Alias Studio, Wavefront TAV, Real3D, Lightwave, Playmation, Animation:Master, Animation:Journeyman, Imagine, Videoscape and a host of proprietary tools.    Prisms was the first piece of commercial software since TAV that was actually designed by people with an inkling of what a production environment was actually like.  I saw a demo and was like, ""they get it.""  When they evolved their toolset into Houdini it was a fairly painless transition, even though the interface was completely different (in the beginning when you booted into Houdini you were greeted by a completely bare window and you had to define your layout, which I didn't mind because I'd used Real3D for about a year which was the same way), because I was already comfortable with a procedural workflow.  A bigger problem for me is trying to use anything else now that I'm used to Houdini.  Kinda like trying to type using only my tongue, is what it feels like."

vfx,3cw3np,kyoseki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:16 2015 UTC,So do you also agree that math is incredibly important for a Houdini workflow? And if so how would you go about learning it? Did you study it at university or something or have you always had a passion for it?
vfx,3cw3np,kyoseki,2,Tue Jul 14 11:40:26 2015 UTC,"I was horrible at math in school.  I went to CalArts to study character animation, after having taught myself enough CG to get into the school.  I more or less fell into visual effects when few animation jobs were available.  Since then I've seen and used first generation industry software all the way to today.  Houdini works the way large scale production works but it's also the one tool I know I can do anything with as a one-man-army."
vfx,3cw3np,__Cyber_Dildonics__,3,Tue Jul 14 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"There is a huge demand for Houdini artists who can build setups & rigs to hand off to junior guys, but demand for the button pushers who just run the setups changes constantly - if you want a consistent job as a Houdini guy you need to be able to build stuff from scratch.  Python scripting is a very useful skill to have, but in Houdini it takes a back seat to understanding VEX.  VEX is Houdini's vector expression language, but it's more akin to C in that it's a compiled language and focuses primarily on the math side of things rather than automation which is where Python is generally used in Houdini.  90% of my time in Houdini is spent building custom tools & setups that Houdini doesn't actually have. That means writing operators in VEX that manipulate point & primitive geometry directly (you can do this with Python but it's a LOT slower), this is ultimately what gives Houdini it's power, you have access to very low level data structures and can manipulate them exactly the way you want to.  For example, fluid simulations in Houdini give you access to very low level parts of the sim. If you consider a fluid simulation essentially a list of steps that modify scalar & vector fields (like velocity, density, temperature etc), you can override or rewrite any of those steps to work exactly the way you want it to, you don't have to rely on the authors of the software to have implemented the operator you need.  The downside of this is that you need to know quite a lot of math to be able to do that, but this is really what Houdini is. It's less a piece of 3D software like Maya or Max and more a kind of GUI for manipulating 3D data at a fundamental level. They expose huge chunks of the software to you, so you can create your own tools that work the way you want them to, even though they might be based on the ones that Houdini ships with, but it's fundamentally the customization stuff that will keep you employed, rather than just knowing what Houdini does out of the box.  So, uh, yeah, you do need to know how to ""script"" in order to remain gainfully employed as a Houdini guy. Python is used heavily in building custom interface stuff, event callbacks (like ""run this script when this parameter is changed"" or ""run this script when a new instance of this node is created"") is all done in Python these days. VEX & math is where the real meat of Houdini lies, you need to be comfortable with the idea of writing/building tools to manipulate things like point position & color directly, because you use the same language to manipulate vector fields, particle velocities, shaded point colors and just about everything else in Houdini."
vfx,3cw3np,pilmeny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:24:47 2015 UTC,Oof that sounds intense. Thanks for the reply though this has been really helpful. I'll look into it some more because I really enjoy doing fx stuff so thanks for letting me know what I'm in for. So do you predominately use Houdini for particle stuff or do you use it as a full 3D program like for modelling/rigging etc?
vfx,3cw3np,apoc519,3,Mon Jul 13 22:05:06 2015 UTC,"Houdini's primary role in visual effects is doing particles, volumetrics, fluids & destruction work. It's also used heavily for more artistic procedural geometry & animation. There's also new crowd tools that look pretty promising, so it's possible that it may supplant massive as the go to for crowds work, we'll see how that pans out.  It generally isn't used for regular modeling, rigging or animation because that's invariably handled by Max & Maya guys (typically Maya in feature films), which Houdini isn't all that great at - a few places have tried it, most notably Core in Toronto, but it's extremely unusual to use it in that way.  99% of anything you do in Houdini will be FX work, which means getting very familiar with linear algebra (vector math, transform matrices, that kind of thing), calculus (rates of change, integration, differentiation) and vector calculus (fluid simulations, vector/scalar fields, field analysis).  Most of this sounds a lot more intimidating than it really is, but you will need a solid grounding in math to be able to handle it. Once you get a few core concepts down though, you'll find that you end up doing variations on the same techniques over and over."
vfx,3cw3np,apoc519,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:39 2015 UTC,Haha Yeah that does sound scary. Would it be better for me to do a crash course in calculus and stuff before tackling Houdini?
vfx,3cw3np,pilmeny,3,Tue Jul 14 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely need to know basic linear algebra, vector math - things like dot products, cross products, transform matrices & quaternions.  This is the book I usually recommend; https://books.google.com/books/about/Essential_Mathematics_for_Computer_Graph.html?id=Ng5Qa15MZ84C&source=kp_cover&hl=en  See if you can find that specific edition, looks like it's on Amazon 2nd hand for $23, not sure I'd spend $80 on the Kindle edition (but since there is a Kindle edition, I'm sure you can probably track down a PDF).  Calculus & vector calculus you can probably worry about later, vector calculus is probably the more useful of the two when it comes to fx work and most of the concepts are pretty straightforward, the hardest part is typically getting over the use of the word ""calculus""."

When it's time to export they kick out TIFs for the UDIMs and then we batch those into TX files for us to light with.

The archive once in a day thing is probably the way we're going to do it. A bit like github, with a pull/push workflow. The only problem is if someone forget to push from his SSD to the network and then isn't there the next day when someone needs to continue the texture work. What's more archiving in mari takes quite a long time for huge projects so you can't just push your work often."

Archiving does take a long time too, that's why they do it at end-of-day. Anytime there is a possibility to get bitten in the ass by a workflow you're pretty much guaranteed for it to happen during crunch."
vfx,3cu30w,abecor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:04:28 2015 UTC,Good question. Sharing paint layers or channels within the software would be nice for huge projects.  However you can always export the individual UDIMS or layers to give them to a different artist if they share the same UDIM layout and model.

Plug that reformat into the bg input of the roto then drop your corner pin after the roto.  You'll need to add another transform after the corner pin to move it back into place and then reformat again back to your 4K.  you lose a bit of quality in your roto because of the filtering but stacking the transforms and reformats will concatenate and you should only take two filter hits, one on the initial reformat before the roto and one at the end.  Trying the other method cyphersk8 suggested works as well and it looks like you get about the same result.  Not sure if you still need to transform the roto back into place with that solution but this is another option.   Glad you found a solution.  :)"

vfx,3cq909,cyphersk8,4,Fri Jul 10 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"I took a look at your script, and the first thing I noticed is that the Roto shape is enormous. I'm guessing what you did is connect the Roto node to the CornerPin before drawing your shape. That's fine, but in this case I think the problem is that the CornerPin is set for 4K footage, which is being compressed down to a tiny little area. Consequently, the CornerPin transform is being propagated backwards to the Roto node, making it ridiculously huge.  Try this: In the CornerPin node, click on the “From” tab and hit “Copy to”. Then go to frame 1 and right click on each of the eight boxes in the “From” tab and click “No animation”. You might be able to preserve the Roto shapes by going to the “Transform” tab, selecting each shape, removing animation on all of the transform parameters, then resizing them into place with the transform handle. Otherwise, I think you'll have to redo the roto, unfortunately."
vfx,3cq909,cyphersk8,2,Fri Jul 10 01:22:19 2015 UTC,"This is a good tip and you can use corner pins as distortion tracks using this technique. Copy to, then delete animations on the from knobs to create a frame reference."

If you're a 6-7 year professional with real feature and commercial experience you should be looking at $600/day or $65/hr freelance.

You are the go to comper for difficult shots or hero shots.  You get a lookdev shot from time to time (or all the time).  Senior doesn't always mean a lead position but it does mean you can handle anything that is presented to you in a timely and efficient manner and always delivering.  Also, it means going beyond what is expected and adding to the shot in artistic ways.  Senior compers are also leads and do find themselves on set from time to time depending on the studio.  Being on set usually means you are being groomed for higher level positions within the company but getting to that position requires dedication and know how.  Plus it helps to have a good attitude. Senior can also mean that you have been doing this for a long time and can pretty much handle anything without being a ""go to"" person.

vfx,3co3id,LA_viking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:41:23 2015 UTC,"This is a little off topic, but I thought I'd put in my 2 cents regarding the LA market at the moment.  LA is brutal at the moment for compositors.  Almost all of the feature work is in Vancouver right now, as you probably know.  But there's presumably still a lot of unemployed senior compositors hanging around LA that couldn't or wouldn't relocate.  So presumably you've got a lot of out of work compositors with big feature credits on their resumes looking for work in LA.  The Nuke work that is available will probably be for commercials, but some commercial shops will get by just comping in AE (even for big projects) and only bring on Nuke compers when they absolutely have to.  So the Nuke work in LA will probably be freelance, not staff.  I think you could definitely get $500 per day as a senior Nuke compositor on a commercial job in LA.  However, getting a senior Nuke comping job in LA will be really tough unless you know people or really have huge credits on your resume.  I don't know what the NY market is like for Nuke compositors, but I'm guessing it's got to be better than LA since there won't be as many out of work feature film compositors hanging in that city."
vfx,3co3id,coinmania,2,Thu Jul 9 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"Do you live or work in LA?  Work here has become competitive, but there is still work available.  Most features have chased the tax subsidies so the bulk of the feature work is being offloaded to wherever those subsidies are at the moment.  I wouldn't say LA is brutal at all, there is plenty to do here for someone who has experience.  All I need to do is contact one of the many people I know who work here and I usually get a gig. It's a small industry, so if you have experience at all, you'll know somebody in every major VFX city around the world.  I rarely have more than 4 weeks off in a year and I consider that time off very valuable since I'm always doing OT on projects.  Is there a surplus of unemployed senior artists here?  No.  Are commercial shops using mostly after effects?  No.  Getting staff here in LA is still very possible if you are good (or cheap).  You don't need big credits, just a positive attitude and good work ethic.  Oh, and it helps to work your ass off."
vfx,3co3id,i4n,3,Fri Jul 10 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Hey LA_viking, I know that LA is working out for some compositors and I'm happy for them and you, truly.  My experience in LA looking for comp work hasn't been so good, which is why if there's someone like OP who might be deciding between LA and somewhere else, I suggest going somewhere else, but as I said in my comment, that's my 2 cents.  I hit the scene in LA looking for comp work right after CafeFX and Asylum went down.  I started out as an AE comper and tried to make the transition to Nuke.  But LA is not like Vancouver at the moment where there is a large volume of work and thus a lot of junior or mid-level Nuke positions.  Basically every Nuke position in LA that I see posted is for a senior level person, which makes perfect sense when you consider that a lot of jobs have left LA due to subsidies.  Like I said in my comment, if you've got a solid network of artist friends that you know in LA or you truly have senior level experience, maybe you can get work.  But if you're a junior level Nuke artist trying to get in the game and you don't have some friends working at studios in LA who can recommend you, then it's not a city I would recommend at the moment, at least in my experience.  But this is just my opinion based on my experience.  My credits aren't the best and my reel could be better, but it does get harder to build up your reel and credits when there are so few junior or mid-level Nuke positions available."
vfx,3co3id,Hitchcocknballs,2,Sat Jul 11 00:18:41 2015 UTC,"You both make very good points.  It does seem like it could be hard for someone junior.  I do think (and have found) that there is work for mid-level and senior compers, but you are going to have to know people, have a great reel or project list, or be on the cheaper side.  Also, yes, it's all about commercials right now which means higher rates are possible with the unfortunate side-effect of shorter gigs.

vfx,3cmg5n,funnyshorts,4,Thu Jul 9 01:24:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a VFX Editor in the cutting room of a major feature at one of the big studios. Union, of course. My deal is 3200 for a 50 hr week which works out to $58.18/hr. This is way, WAY over scale. I also get CURVAC which amounts to another $128/wk. So my weekly minimum is $3328. Any hours beyond 50 and I get additional OT. Also I can get night premiums for hours after 8 or 9 PM. Minimum call for a Saturday is $873. Sunday is $1164. VFX Editors are not classified as Editors in the union. We are Assistant Editors. So scale is something like $37/hr. My rate is high but not at the absolute ceiling. Working for a vendor will pay less. Working in TV will pay much, MUCH less. I have colleagues who are VFX Editors on award winning (for VFX, duh) shows who are making scale and getting 45 hr guarantees (vs. the 50 or 55 deals more typical in features).

Nuke really isn't built for rendering video files, I come across problems all the time (especially when rendering the whole script). Workflow for me now is to always render to an image sequence then convert to video in a fresh nuke script or after effects. It's sooooo annoying to have it throw up an error after 4 hours of rendering!"
vfx,3cjg6x,munasef,2,Wed Jul 8 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"Nuke and Quicktime have ""issues"". This is partly due to the method of how the quicktime files are structured and how nuke reads and writes images (scanline based).   The standard workflow would be to convert your qt's with Hiero, Nuke Studio or whatever (I highly recommend Hiero/NS) to .dpx, exr, png or whichever image based format suits your needs. This also really speeds things up (images can be read scanline based).  Even though it should be possible to write out quicktimes, it often flatout does not work. I've had other artists render out my exact same script to .movs without problems, just to fail again on another machine. If you simply cannot get it to work, consider again writing out to an image based format and using an external program to create a mov.  This QT thing caused our pipline TDs  some hedaches... on the last show I worked on, we rendered multi channel exr files on our farm, but the QT preview for the directors review was generated via a nuke render node also on the farm. Pure madness ensued when frames went missing or whole previews would just not render.  TL:DR Nuke works best with image based formats and often has problems dealing with quicktimes."

vfx,3ch8b1,shkaa887,4,Tue Jul 7 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"Alembic (and probably FBX) will let you copy at least the positions and projections/angles of the Maya lights into Houdini, but the chances are you'll have to do a fair bit of relighting anyway, there's no way the stock lighting set up will match with completely different shaders and what have you - the lights that work well for hard surfaces rarely work with volumes as well, there's usually a lot of faffing about to get nice results.  For matte objects/holdouts, your best bet will be to render depth maps out of maya and plug those into houdini.  In what I believe is documented exactly fucking NOWHERE, if you plug a depth map into the mantra camera's background image channel, it'll use it as a holdout. That way you don't have to worry about your edges matching up, just make sure the camera shutter timing is set correctly and you should be good.  If you want to use the houdini particle/volume geometry as interactive light sources in maya, things get rather more complicated, you're probably better off generating those passes in mantra and combining in comp, but that could get really fiddly depending on how complex your texture/shader setup is, especially if you're using a lot of displacements.  Oh, one other thing, convert all your textures/maps to .rat files (houdini ships with a command line tool called icp for doing this), otherwise Mantra will convert all the textures at render time and hold them in memory.  Mantra's supposed to be able to use .exr natively as well, but as is common with new features in Houdini, it takes a couple of versions before it actually does what it's supposed to.  So convert your maya depth maps to .rat files and check them with mplay to make sure they're valid."

Question regarding the depth maps - if I'm understanding correctly and you're referring to using zdepth maps, does that mean then that it takes the pixel value and assigns it a certain position in z-space thus giving you the sense of a 3D holdout?  If that's the case, why is this method better than 2.5D comping and then just positioning projections and cards in 3D space and using mattes rendered from Maya as holdouts? I'd assume it would be better to do 2.5D for more flexibility in that you're unlikely to need to re-render the FX if the CG changes, but with the method you've mentioned if the CG changes an FX re-render would be essential? Is that correct? Thanks again and sorry for the rookie questions!"
vfx,3ch8b1,kyoseki,2,Wed Jul 8 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about just using mattes rendered out from maya projected on cards, it's not going to give you accurate intersections with volumes or particles.   It's kind of ok if you have objects that are very flat on the Z axis, but if you have a long object oriented to/from camera, just getting a silhouette averaged about it's midpoint won't give you depth based occlusion from front to back.  The down side is that yes, you'll need to rerun the FX if the maya renders change, the only real way around that is to use deep compositing - if your effects are driven by the animation, changing the anim will probably need to rerender everything anyway."

The fact that this specific plate does not have cars driving by in it, for example, and could therefore be done with a fake pan on stitched stills, does not make it any less of a tracking exercise.

vfx,3cb9x2,KafkaT,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:09:55 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that Max clipped values at 1.  Good to know.  Thank you.
vfx,3cb9x2,i4n,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"Well it doesn't clip values at 1, it takes the maximum value of the inputs in your merge and keeps that highest value.  So if you have a pixel with a value of .5 in the A input and .7 in the B input, the result will be .7. If you added these in the merge the result would be 1.2."

In either case, I think assembly should be renamed to Layout and there should be the expectation that there's locked camera work finished at that phase before animation starts. You could also have the tracked camera there to move on to animation.  I don't know how many people are working on it, but fx is a pretty broad term, will there be cloth simulation and stuff? Character based sim effects like cloth and hair are often a different department than particle effects work and are done by a different person, so they are split out into a category outside of effects - creature fx or something like that.   What is the different between your shot and shot number? I often have a short sequence name and then a shot number incremented in 10s, so shots would read something like myseq_0010, myseq_0020, so you have a little bit of room for additional shots in the sequence if there are changes later on, you could start splitting them out with myseq_0015"

This technique is superseded by the panorama head and good stitching software, however, in most cases because it's a lot faster.  The biggest problem with the gazing balls is the highest concentration of important information gets all compressed into just the edge, so you have to really shoot two or even three HDRIs per ball, work with two tripods, go through two or three leveling calibrations, etc."

vfx,3by109,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"Reflection mapping:       In computer graphics, environment mapping,    or reflection mapping, is an efficient image-based lighting technique for approximating the appearance of a reflective surface by means of a precomputed texture image. The texture is used to store the image of the distant environment surrounding the rendered object.  Several ways of storing the surrounding environment are employed. The first technique was sphere mapping, in which a single texture contains the image of the surroundings as reflected on a mirror ball. It has been almost entirely surpassed by cube mapping, in which the environment is projected onto the six faces of a cube and stored as six square textures or unfolded into six square regions of a single texture. Other projections that have some superior mathematical or computational properties include the paraboloid mapping, the pyramid mapping, the octahedron mapping, and the HEALPix mapping.  The reflection mapping approach is more efficient than the classical ray tracing approach of computing the exact reflection by tracing a ray and following its optical path. The reflection color used in the shading computation at a pixel is determined by calculating the reflection vector at the point on the object and mapping it to the texel in the environment map. This technique often produces results that are superficially similar to those generated by raytracing, but is less computationally expensive since the radiance value of the reflection comes from calculating the angles of incidence and reflection, followed by a texture lookup, rather than followed by tracing a ray against the scene geometry and computing the radiance of the ray, simplifying the GPU workload.

I recorded it and played the crap out of that tape for years.  A few years after that I had a teacher that let me borrow a tape he brought into class while he graded papers.  It was the Siggraph '84 electronic theater and like Beyond Tron I watched the crap out of that, pretty much wearing out the tape.  I started doing animation on my Amiga professionally, though small scale.  Terminator 2 knocked my socks off and got me to change focus from mostly motion graphics to more animation and effects and this got me into art school and eventually hired by one of the animators I'd studied the work of since I was a kid.

I'd maybe tone down the lens flares. Overdone lens flares are a bad idea in general but it makes it seem like there's something blindingly bright in the first shot, and then in the second shot we see the portal and it's kind of dim.  Also, the falling animation (and the way you've shot it) could use some work, but I'm sure you're aware.  And I could be wrong about this, but it looks like the portal animation is at a lower frame rate than the plate? There's something jarring about it."

vfx,3bhdih,skootles,11,Mon Jun 29 11:34:15 2015 UTC,"This brings back horrible memories to my first real roto job.   The footage was mostly green screen with tracking markers (for matchmoving), but also with a lot of roto work to do. There were 80 shots total and we had a team of about 4 people to do them.  The first problem was that whoever prepared the clips for us to roto added 4 second handles on the top and tail without telling us. I essentially wasted the first day or two rotoing part of a shot that didn't even get used in the final.  On top of that, some of these were shots from hell because whoever actually shot the damned footage didn't take a good look at their shutter angle on the camera. The result was some of the worst motion blur I've ever had to deal with.  And on top of that the studio was extremely bad at budgeting their time and money. This project was the first real big one involving matchmoving and such a large amount of roto so we were kind of learning as we went. We ended up hiring more people to my roto team, only to cut it down to two people a week or two later. Also I'm pretty sure once our main compositor submitted his final invoices, they were in the red for that project.  The last day of work, I was there for 27 hours to get our shots done on time. By the end we were just sitting in the lobby struggling to stay awake. The accountant pitied us and cut our cheques right there and then.  On the positive side, both my team and I learned a lot of great tricks for rotoing and pulling some decent mattes from shitty footage. Also the client came in after our 27 hour work day and brought us a big pile of breakfast food."

vfx,3bhdih,skootles,2,Mon Jun 29 16:49:28 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm sure everything we learned could be found from tutorials online. We were relatively new to rotoscoping and we had to do most of it in After Effects. Basically we'd do what we could using Mocha (planar trackers ftw) and anything we couldn't we'd bring into After Effects and do it somewhat manually. We got some pretty decent mattes from applying colour effects and playing with the channel effects as well. My recommendation would be to play around with the colour and channel effects in AE to learn more about what they do and how they affect your footage.
vfx,3bhdih,skootles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately most of our stuff was over green screen so I don't have any concrete advice for you here, but try things like heavier feathering, spot colour correction, and possibly the clone tool if you can get away with it."

vfx,3biwhb,pilmeny,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"I did some breakdown work for MPC on one of their major shows, in my case I was asked to render out a grey-shaded version of an asset, then a version with a special edge shader applied to show off the model detail, then a hi-res rendered version of the final asset, and finally a ""playblast"" (a hi-resolution render that looks like a playblast but without the aliasing kinks that are ubiquitous with playblasting).   Breakdowns are hella annoying and in my case I had to be specifically billed out to the company to do it. This means the company paid for my time to do their breakdowns instead of the show. I was Lighter on the show who happened to finish all her work and was idle so they threw the breakdown stuff at me in order to fill my time. Even then breakdown work was in final form, like what you're seeing is just the different final layers of a comp and lighting and anim. Usually when you see wireframe renders they're actually specialized shaders that are rendered out by the Lighting department specifically for these companies' sizzle reels. In other words, none of these companies ever want to show unpolished work.   I will say that for me, breakdowns are not possible as a Lighter on a big show. They won't allow us to show un-polished work on our demo reels, so usually I have to wait and rip my shots from the Blu-Ray and then ask folks to just take my word for it."

This creates weird stretching on prominent parts of a video.  You can apply a very saturated color correct before and after the moshing.  Using a cross color process will help bring out more separation between the color values and you just push them to the extreme and hue shift them to be crazy colors.

Connect that to the displacement node in your material. Be sure to set the global displacement parameters such as edge length (keep it low) to better control the amount

vfx,3b9ms0,ScreamingPenguin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"To me this looks like a good student submission reel for a couple reasons. Firstly you have a wide range of different effects and skills on display.  Second the volume of different shots shows that you have been working hard at this, it's not just one or two things, that shows that you have a passion for it and are motivated.  Finally you have kept the pace up and it's not too long.  Anyone with VFX experience knows exactly how you did every single shot in your reel so breakdowns aren't necessary, save breakdowns for invisible effects.  In the future you really need to watch out for the generic stuff in a reel.  Anything that has a video copilot or youtube breakdown is something that anyone looking at a bunch of reels has seen a million times.  For example the portal stuff looks fine, but your recruiter or whatever has undoubtedly seen too many already for the ones in your reel to make much impact. You need new unique effects that are polished to really impress a recruiter.  You are trying to impress the person that has already watched 30 reels that day and yours is 31, they want to see something unique that shows creativity and skill not something that followed a tutorial."

I see a lot of work that, sure, it's easy enough to tell there wasn't really a designer behind it and there's that work out there.    My comments are based on a particular standard of work and level of firm that I'm interested in working in.  Fact is, in the '90s you could be a mid level effects person and transfer to a high level at a AAA game developer, you could be a high level and transfer over as something closer to a creative director...to Square...to EA, no prior experience working in gaming, they just wanted great artists.  That doesn't really happen now.    Modeling and some character animation, that's going to be more portable now, I was speaking more in the ""visual effects"" context where they're skills and people employed at visual effects firms while not being visual effects jobs per se.

I work 40hrs now unless I'm on a roll or on a deadline, and in that case I work the hours I can, that are required and I expect the same of anyone else working under me.  12hrs as a baseline expectation though, that is what I'd call abusive if it's not an every now and again thing, and only when it's absolutely necessary.

Crunch time generally is about 4-5 months out of the year, most of the rest of the time it's 40-45 hrs a week.

vfx,3b1pzj,o0flatCircle0o,2,Thu Jun 25 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  The business model is broken, especially for small companies. You're selling an undervalued product, that takes a huge amount of time and skill to produce, and you can only sell it once.  Essentially, every year the VFX houses are starting fresh.  Even if companies get big contracts, the profit margins don't increase greatly due to software, hardware and HR costs. Big contracts mean more shots, pushier clients/directors, and expanding scope.  This is a problem faced by digital media agencies and production companies too to a certain extent.  Interestingly, here in Japan big agencies are able to license their product on a fixed term or sometimes per use basis. This allows them to have a cushion of capital for dry months. The game doesn't change for small agencies, however."

The only options that aren't some sort of Manager/Director/President/Owner/Lead are Animator, Wrangler, Intern, and Unemployed.  So the majority of choices are focused at the tiny minority of people who realistically have the least day-to-day involvement in actually rendering things.  I have no idea of people like compositors, lighters and modelers are supposed to be lumped in as ""Animators"" for the sake of this survey.  The fact that roles like Producer don't show up on the list makes me wonder if the creators of the survey have a solid handle on the industry they are investigating.  The scheduling software question about deadline/shotgun also seems to suggest that shotgun is a render queue manager.

Weird schedules, weird lab times, and very strict guidelines. Sorry for that, just what I heard.   You learned some pretty nice stuff.

We split off into ""disciplines"" in finals where we do our own thing for 3 months and make a demo reel, but I wish that would have happened sooner on in the program with more time to practice our own stuff rather than juggling 2 classes a month and doing your own discipline outside of class to get good.

There's far fouler habits out there that show up time and time again, from shops big and small, that neither look good or serve any purpose other than convention, bad taste and/or economy.

A phone probably won't cut it, since it'll just drown in the daylight, and disappear when you underexpose.  Consider small LED panels like Rosco LitePads if you want to emulate a phone. Apply WD right on top to even them out a bit; they come with a dimmer and can work well as ""smartphones"" for certain shots if you need the punch. Just run the wire down the sleeve and don't go up close.  Regular torches don't pack enough punch for DfN either. Consider something like a 125W PocketPar gelled to tungsten. Strip it of the barndoors and don't show it up close either. Cover it in black papertape or so if needed. Same trick for the cable as with the LitePads.  Streetlights, cars etc. need to be enhanced similarly if you want it to look good. It depends on how far you're willing to go. But even for actual nighttime shoots, we often mount additional 2K fixtures to practical streetlights, and I have occasionally rigged cars with two or more 1K fresnels to make for stronger headlights (generator in the trunk).  Basically, if your practical sources are barely visible in broad daylight, they'll be worthless in DfN, unless you plan on simulating them altogether.  You need to do the math: Would you rather shell out a few hundred bucks more for lighting equipment and crew, or spend whatever number of additional hours/days it takes in post?"

In most cases the reflection is slightly out of focus or warped because of the glass/curve so you can get away with a bit. Also remember the camera would be focused on the actor, not the glass window between them and the camera. Depending on the angle/warp of the glass (if it's really extreme) you can cheat that in 2D."

It's also something that bothers me to no end whenever I dabble in CGI (it's just a hobby for me) - how do I apply ""proper"" lens blur in post to reflections, when my depth map can only give me the z depth of the reflecting surface?  Like, I know I could blur the reflection separately, but that's kind of not the point, if you know what I mean. Does anyone happen to know a workflow for post lens blur that takes the reflected distance into account? I couldn't think of anything so far."

vfx,3akx1k,N1ckFG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:04:30 2015 UTC,"Shake and Combustion were the major competitors to Nuke and AE, but both died in 2008. Shake was acquired by Apple as part of their ""Pro Apps"" initiative, then dropped when they got bored supporting it. (Intriguingly, for a while Apple sold a Linux version with source access, so there are probably some proprietary forks running out there still.) Combustion was bought by Autodesk along with the rest of the Flame compositing line and discontinued, I'd guess because they found it was stealing sales from the higher-end offerings.  Apple Motion is more of a friendly front-end for Apple's Quartz Composer node-based graphics environment than a full compositing or animation app. People have been predicting QC's demise for years but as of OS X Yosemite it's still supported.  There's one serious newcomer in the field, Blackmagic's Fusion. Took a brief look at it a few months ago and it seems promising, but I suspect a product so far outside the company's core business (video capture hardware) is always at risk of getting cut."
vfx,3akx1k,BurnetRhoades,3,Sun Jun 21 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"This isn't a newcomer though.  Fusion, like the Foundry's version of Nuke, is a licensed fork of an application that started its life as a real production tool (unlike pretty much all other competing apps, past and present, besides Cineon).  It was first licensed for 3rd party resale, I believe, right around the time of Shake's intro and a bit before the first instance of commercial Nuke, before it was licensed to The Foundry (DD themselves tried to sell it for a while, before figuring out they didn't want to be in 3rd Party software support and sales).  It's just that nobody really noticed.  It was generally considered a joke back then and the only groups that I ever noticed who used it were the artists and shops with a background in Lightwave, coming up from the low end versus top level artists spreading out from the bigger houses, starting boutiques and new studios.  Shake was seen as an ""if I can't have Nuke, this is an awesome alternative,"" and it got most of the attention.  It seems powerful enough now, I just don't like how un-intuitive it is in basic function compared to Nuke or how I remember Shake.  I'm more interested in seeing how Natron shapes up, though it's really early and hard to trust, currently, and it's missing a lot of functions."
vfx,3akx1k,berkut,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, Eyeon software really dropped the ball with the EOL of Shake - if they'd have provided native Linux support (instead of Wine compatibility), added Python scripting earlier (they concentrated on Lua first) and multi-layer reading in one input/read node, and better colour management, they'd have made much more progress. At the time, Nuke was still pretty flaky, and Fusion was probably the superior tool overall.  DD tried to sell Nuke from 2004 to 2007 (when The Foundry ""bought"" it), but unsurprisingly, not many VFX studios were willing to pay competitors money, even for a useful tool."
vfx,3akx1k,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Nuke pretty flakey?  Sorry, but it was already the best compositor in the industry before anyone else could buy it.  The proof is in the work we did with it at DD and the work that was not done at any major studio ever in Fusion at the same time despite being available.  Foundry licensed a fork of it which was a move by DD 2.0 management, which was a smart move because a VFX house is not a commercial software developer and doesn't need to deal with those sorts of issues.  They're not set up to deal with that, regardless of any perceived conflicts of interest.   Let someone else deal with the headaches, get a check.  Pretty much all of the other big VFX studios had written their own compositing tools.  The compers at Cinesite wished they had Nuke instead of Cineon.  The compers at Sony wished they had Nuke instead of Bonsai.  The compers at R+H wished they had Nuke instead of Icy.  The compers from DD that went up to become sups at ILM wished they had Nuke for a while too (now they do).  Eyeon EOL of Shake?  Apple did the EOL on Shake.  At the time it was still out Shake had a nice interface but it was much slower than Nuke.  It was seen as the next best thing though.  I don't know of a single non-Lightwave shop in LA at the time that used or was interested in Fusion.  I don't know what the market was like outside of Hollywood but Shake, Nuke and Discrete products were all there was if you weren't working at SPI and R+H."

vfx,3akx1k,BurnetRhoades,2,Sun Jun 21 09:38:35 2015 UTC,"C4D isn't really integrated with AE.  None of the support programs are.  Being able to launch into a completely unrelated program with no shared context in interface or workflow and then read a file you must save out back into AE in some way is not integration.  Element 3D, if you buy it from Video Copilot, is more integrated than any of the licensed, bundled apps or AE's connection to other Adobe apps.  If you take Element out of the equation, Nuke is far more fluid and useful from a 3D context and workflow than After Effects.  Industry standards are pretty much ignored by Adobe, or well implemented,  so ""integration"" is very much a chore."

But pretty much any sort of hierarchical hard surface animation you can already do, even if it's a bit cumbersome in the AE timeline, all those nulls.  What Andrew Kramer needs to add to Element is Alembic support.  C4D is an ""also ran"" tool and he needs to look beyond it even if Adobe can't seem to.  Being able to read and write Alembic files is one of the major edges that Nuke has over AE.  Nuke can share data, cameras, models and motion, with relevant 3D applications because it supports Alembic.    I think even those open source Blender hippies might one of these days figure out they're holding their application back by not taking industry standards seriously enough, before Adobe will."
vfx,3akx1k,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Alembic support in Element would be fantastic. Oddly, Alembic files read directly into AE's Cineware seem to perform a lot better than FBX bone animation (which isn't a high bar as that's so slow it's totally unusable)."

vfx,3akx1k,kohrtoons,5,Sun Jun 21 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"Being able to interpret vector layers would be something that could easily be written into Nuke.  What you can't really get around is, for motion graphics, the need to deal with timing and sequencing and, quite often, audio.    The curve editor in AE, for actually doing animation controls, is a joke.  Nuke has a real curve editor.  But dealing with sometimes long sequences of something that's more than just lots of layers for  a single composition just doesn't fit into a nodal paradigm easily.  Just like non-linear referencing and efficient layer access or concatenation of transformations of dozens and dozens of layers does not fit into a timeline paradigm."
vfx,3akx1k,OverTheHorizonRadar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, this 100x. The lack of a fluid and advanced text system outside of the text node and the very limited options for manipulation thereof make it completely unrealistic for any heavy or complicated motion graphics work.   That said, it's not impossible, just unnecessarily difficult.

Try looking at stock footage of squibs, or shoot your own elements. Secondly, anytime you have an element interacting with footage like this, you're going to need to fake the anim to match that footage.  The sword has to look like it's stuck in the body.  If the point is wavering all over the place, the exit wound is going to move around.  Matchmove a wound locator, then constrain the sword point to that.  It won't line up with the matchmove completely, but it's necessary to make it look integrated."

vfx,3abvbf,AlvinBlah,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's not actually, the same underlying color engine is in all Adobe programs.  And, again, you're doing it wrong. Coloring the composite you're building in AE is not about making a final grade, it's about matching the color between two aspects of your plate. Don't color lock at this stage. Don't even try to; it's wasted time.  Let me try to explain the workflow for editing with the Adobe Suite:   String out and rough cut in Premiere. If you absolutely must color at this point...and you shouldn't. Use the basic adjustment effects built in, but apply to adjustment layers not the clips. Save your work. Send only the specific clip sections that need Compositing to AE. Whatever AE project is currently open, that's where the clips go. If AE is off, the Dynamic Link send will launch a new AE project. Save your work. Composite your shots in AE, apply curves and other correctors as needed to develop your enhanced shot. Save your work. Return to Premiere Pro. Incorporate GFX and Music. Save your work. Send all clips requiring color grade (note: Titles and other full screen GFX should not need color grade outside of very specific use cases. It is normal to apply a small curve (in premiere) to strong reds and strong whites though) to Speed Grade or Resolve. Save your work. Primary and Secondary color corrections in your program of choice. Save your work. Return to Premiere. Save your work. Export. Save your work. Bake down any return-replace specific clip sections that fuck with your export. Save your work.   I'm not kidding about saving your work. Every iteration of the Creative Suite gets better and better with Dynamic Linking in my view...but it's still not reliably stable when you reach scale. Adjust your automatic backup times to be very frequent, and save often because this shit still crashes like a motherfucker."

Probably the most important nodes to familiarize yourself with are Merge, Transform, and RotoPaint. Blur, and to a lesser extent Dilate (or Erode as it's called in the menu), are good ones to know as well.

You might want to post at least a rough example of the kind of effect you're trying to achieve, and what your filming environment will be like.  Likewise, when you say the quality merely has to be good, that's also mighty difficult to interpret. One man's ""good"" is another man's ""awful"".  Suffice it to say, if it's practical for you to acquire extra data on principal photography (mo-cap data, for instance) that can only aid you in getting your camera and character tracking done more quickly."

They pay me to do these things, I do not ask why they want something only how to do it. So... what I am actually doing is having 1 actress swallow another actress whole, like a snake.  Her jaw, chest and stomach will be replaced for this effect.   It is done slowly because that is the focus.  they really want the one long shot of it. Then they want to have the enlarged gut containing the second actress.  and for her to eventually try to walk with it.  Everything else nowadays is done with beach balls and bad morphing, so I did not need movie quality, TV quality will still be better than has been seen before. Yeah it is weird... but might be fun to do."
vfx,3a5sjz,teeejer,3,Wed Jun 17 16:08:22 2015 UTC,Ha best response possible!  Mocap could work but honestly I think you'd probably spend more time trying to fit your mocap to you footage than if you just matchimated it by hand. Especially if it isn't stereo and the camera move isn't too crazy. I'd just add some markers to her body and try to get a simple object track for her head then go from there.  Good luck!
vfx,3a5sjz,blackthorngang,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:57:23 2015 UTC,"So I'd think what you'd want to do here is start with a locked off camera (if you can) then film both actresses with whatever markers you require.  Then after your camera track (which should be simple for a lock-off) do a soft-track of each actress, presumably with some kind of fan geometry for hair (perhaps wardrobe isn't an issue here, huh.)  From there you can apply whatever deformers you need, and the 3D tracks on your actors should provide some extra flexibility when it comes time to warp; likewise when you get around to doing contact shadows and etc. In the mocap versus hand-tracking realm, I've never seen a tracker turn down helper data, but you know your own strengths in this situation.  If you think you've nothing to gain from a mocap setup, ditch it.  If you think you can get a strong starting point from mocap (which is what I'd presume) then go for that.  One wonders what your budget is for kink, but whatevs.  Hope everyone's having a good time.  Here I'll hold back on making comparisons between the exploitive nature of the VFX biz and the exploitive nature of ahem other businesses.

vfx,3a4ytb,vayne001,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"In our company the animation producer is really just an animation co-ordinator: Keeping the artists organized and on task - balancing dept resources with the needs of the studio. They do not do client budgets/bids and only deal internally. This is for a studio of 200-250 people, for an animation team of about 15-22"
vfx,3a4ytb,losangelesvideoguy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:54:52 2015 UTC,"Similar at the place where I work, except there is less artist management (this is handled by associate producers or coordinators) and much more client facing work. Handling expectations, emails, and working with executive producer to do bids and schedule upcoming jobs.   They mostly deal with lead artists to get a scope for how the job is going while coordinators and AP will go desk to desk with the department leads to check in on people.   We are a vendor doing work for film, commercials, and sometimes game assets."

Closest studio to Bondi Beach, where you might consider living if you're coming from overseas. Employee parking is a huge bonus.  Overtime is banked as time in lieu which is paid time off they can force you to take if work is slow or you can add to your holidays.  In my opinion the pipeline is horrific. You'll spend more time submitting reviews and checking things in than doing actual shots. Everything is proprietary, buggy and perpetually in beta. That was my experience in the FX department.  You will quickly become sick of the lunch options as well"

I worked there from late 2009-2010 and their Fx pipeline was terrible at first, but it got quite good at the end of my time there.  It was still all Maya + Renderman though, and I know they're transitioning to their in house renderer, not sure if they use any Houdini there."
vfx,3a4g6o,Abominati0n,2,Thu Jun 18 23:17:16 2015 UTC,I was there from 2008-2012. Houdini was ramping up when I left. FX is about 50/50 Maya/Houdini now I think. I found doing very basic things like rendering instanced particles or volumes to be a awful with no visual feedback at all. I usually worked on short form stuff without much RnD support so that's likely why. I always felt they could hire anyone off the street to work there because everything is proprietary anyways

vfx,3a2963,resurrected_again,2,Tue Jun 16 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think its a bit too long for an intro, it definitely has potential though. Biggest thing that stuck out to me was the lack of overlapping action. Something happens... Then something else happens.. Then something else etc. Animations should overlap and transition fluidly into each other. Some animations weren't eased in and out. The timing could be exaggerated and sped up.   The ending could do with something less generic and more interesting. The face logo dude could animate, and the background too.  Don't settle for ""close enough"", cut the length of it in half or more and spend another 5 hours polishing every movement."
vfx,3a2963,petesterama,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:17:12 2015 UTC,"Ya I was gonna also say all that, but the thing that stuck was that, again, there was very little easing. USE THEM EASE IN AND OUTS! THEYRE SO NIFTY! And they make your animation flow a little better and make it less ""jolty""."

I skimmed it and the effect seemed the same throughout.  Merge multiple time-offset video layers over themselves using a minimum-value operation. Each layer should be scaled down about 10%. After that you can flop half the video horizontally and apply an animating hue shift... How to do this depends on the software package you're using. What program are you going to do this in?"

vfx,39x13q,xilstudio,3,Mon Jun 15 14:24:17 2015 UTC,"Because it is super low budget, you can't afford to pay someone experienced to do it correctly. So factor in corrections, notes etc for double the time you are already paying them. Or pay a flat rate. It depends on how many cooks you have in the kitchen working on this shot. Is it one person doing the whole thing, multiple artists?  Please don't pay your VFX artist less than the cost of your Wrap party/showing booze. I'm only adding this sentence because I've personally seen it happen. lol."
vfx,39x13q,GreenTeaZing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"Wrap party... yeah right. No, I realize I cannot pay someone the true rate of a experienced VFX artist (wheelbarrow of money and 2 virgin sheep per hour). I can do most of the other things, I just lack 3D modeling skill and near zero experience with Match moving. I can composite and grade and so forth.  Limiting the number of cooks only because of the limited budget.  Had I the money I would farm the whole thing out! I would flat rate it, for certain... that helps with the budgeting, but knowing what is fair is the issue.  I am big on being fair when paying people.  The budget is what it is though."

vfx,39x13q,FartsForKids,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:45:07 2015 UTC,A better example:   I need two models tracked on to the actress.  The camera can be static to make this easier.  One shot is know to be about 90 seconds long and includes movement.  The rest of the shots total about 3 minutes long and have much less movement of the actor.  Final shot is 30 seconds long and the actor is trying to walk with the models attached. What is a good way to budget this?
vfx,39x13q,FartsForKids,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"What are the models you are attaching - Are they static and locked solid to the actor like a helmet? Or are they organic like ears/hair? 90 seconds is a loooooong-ass shot. How much is the actor moving? Are they clearly, fully visible in frame the entire shot? Is there lots of motion?"
vfx,39x13q,VizzFX,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:20:26 2015 UTC,"Organic, minimal movement as much as possible, though one shot is of walking.  Clearly, fully visible in the shots. Yeah it is, most of these things are long shots, that long one is a key shot though."

vfx,39w0sp,BurnetRhoades,2,Mon Jun 15 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"780 ti is second only to the 980, regardless of Nvidia's progression of numbers.    The 780ti has better floating point performance, both single and double-precision, by as much as 31%, moreso double-precision.  It has more than twice the texture mapping units as the 970.  It has more shading units.  It has a wider memory bus.     The 970 has a better pixel fill rate and that's pretty much it, as far as performance goes.  It doesn't matter that the clockspeed is significantly higher or that the new Maxwell architecture makes good use of fewer CUDA cores, it doesn't actually perform like the 780ti in areas that would matter for professional apps and it at best breaks even in only some game benchmarks."

vfx,39w0sp,LeadingSomewhere,2,Mon Jun 15 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of gamer sites that show fairly consistent comparisons between the two.  But a pretty darned good indicator of the relative speed between the two for professional apps versus games, one of the best comparisons I saw was on the Blender boards.    Their physically-based renderer Cycles uses CUDA to do hardware acceleration for photorealistic rendering.  It's pure math, pure computation, the likes of which will matter for other GPU physics or rendering acceleration, accelerated rendering in Adobe, Element, etc.  In one case the benchmark scene was rendered on an overclocked (~1500Mhz) 970 in about 8min and change and a single super-clocked 780ti, like you can get from eVga and others, did the same scene in 5min and change, and dual 780ti in SLI did it in 3min and change."

I'd say about 80% of artists pick their career.  I didn't... and make no mistake it has hurt my career.  I know artist who were Jr's when I was a comp lead who routinely land better gigs then I do... mostly because they ran all over the world when I was settling down.  And as result their reels are insanely good now... for me, I don't care.  To make it work, I have a few rules.    I don't travel for work. I used to but not anymore. I take the jobs that pay the most and require the least... often this means less sexy projects. I will not under any circumstance cut my rate.  My rate does fluctuate, but it never goes below my floor.  FWIW, This has cost me some big gigs, although more likely then not saved me a few headaches.  I try to make life the most important thing.  There is a sup who I used to work with who constantly told me about the ""time he came back to work (the same day) his son was born"" - HELL NO!  Don't work for people like that.     Have an exit plan.  Most artists do... that should tell you something.  There is nothing more sad then the guys in their late 40's who are single and having trouble getting work because all their bosses are 10 years younger.... even though its total BS, its real and it happens.   TLDR; work to live, don't live to work."

Had I decided to do things differently I could have worked on both of those- the franchises that made me get into VFX in the first place.   One of my best friends stuck with our first company, with a less than ideal work environment. He's worked almost every day for the last 7 years. He's now their VFX supervisor on all their Marvel films.  When I was job hunting a year ago, there were multiple decently prestigious head of comp gigs available that I could have probably landed...

Good question, let's check to see who's going to be in office and if they like film subsidies.  Every year these VFX houses move their operations to some place with a sweet tax deal because the head honchos at the big studios tell them that's where they have to be if they want to secure a contract, and every year somebody wins or loses an election and the subsidies change, maybe they get reduced, or some other state/country decides to offer something better and then the whole process happens all over again.  These same ""geniuses"" undercut themselves and the competition in financially idiotic contracts under the stupid assumption that ""next time we'll  be able to charge full price"" even though that never happens, no matter how many times they try it.  They bet the farm on excessively expensive productions like Ender's game because apparently there's no risk in making expensive blockbuster films.    They didn't unionize or establish a trade organization when they had leverage in the nineties and early 2000s, and they haven't even made a half-assed attempt to do it now even though every indicator shows that they are getting raked over the coals all the time because they have no leverage or protection.  They might have built this industry, but their arrogance and stupidity is tearing it down.   Choose what makes you happy. Don't feel like others have to choose what you chose so that you can feel like you made the right choice.   People can do whatever they want.  I was just offering advice as to what I think is the better choice."

vfx,39tfk1,BurnetRhoades,6,Mon Jun 15 08:17:33 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty good answer below, but this job effects even simple dating and pre-marital relationships, if you're trying to have a relationship outside the industry, or one with someone who doesn't have a similar irregular, professional schedule and accompanying pressures.  It is very difficult, in my experience, for people with 9-to-5 jobs to ""get it.""   I lived with a girl for a number of years and we almost got married.  Because of pressure at home, because of the phone calls every half hour to hour asking, ""when are you coming home?"" I started to try and make the relationship more of a priority, but it was hard.  I was a supervisor and I can't exactly expect artists under me to work more or harder than I was willing to do.  It caused a lot of friction.  Friction at work and friction at home.  I turned down at least three amazing opportunities, two of which would have involved a move, two offers to run departments, one to Japan to work with one of the foremost animation directors and get their VFX department up and running.  I turned them all down because I knew the relationship would be over.  We eventually split up anyway.  A few years later she'd worked her way up to DPM and then producer and one day we were having lunch and she apologized to me for all the grief years prior when we were together.  She just didn't understand what the job entailed and what it took to do what I did at the level I did it.    Some years later I was dating a girl who worked and went to night school.  Things were going well for a few weeks but then a deadline approached and I was having to work late.  There was no wiggle room, I had to work late or the deadline was going to be blown and while I might have been inclined to just let it slide because, ""shit happens,"" I was sub-contracted by a friend and if the deadline was blown it would reflect poorly on them, not me.  I wasn't going to let that happen.  So she calls and says she's out of class early and wants to hang out.  I say I can't, no way out, we'll have to get together later in the week.  And then the texts start to show up.  The guilt trips.  All of this, putting my headspace out of where it needed to be, I'd seen this before, several times.  I ended it that night so that I could get some peace and back to work.  That may sound terrible, but it's something to keep in mind.  I've been in the industry a long time.  I know quite a few married couples in the industry.  I know a lot of married folks working at the highest levels of the industry as supervisors and leads who have been happily married for years.  The catch is, almost all of them are married to people who also work or have worked doing what we do.   You need to be careful of the decisions you might have to make that lead to resentment in years to come."

I didn't like hurting her feelings but her behavior was a red flag and I'd been down this road.  I wasn't going to place a likely temporary relationship ahead of career and reputation.  Anyone who would, in those circumstances, isn't someone I'd want to be or that I'd have respected."

And look into increasing the shutter speed to remove heavy motion blur. You can always add some motion blur back at the expense of render time. But it beats a sliding motion track.
vfx,39t6gd,SaltedBiscuit,2,Sun Jun 14 17:09:35 2015 UTC,"Nice start!  Have you tried using matchmoving software to do a 3D track?  When you're shooting, try and measure a scale reference so that you can make the 3D object the right size. The location you choose plays a big part in the final shot.  In terms of compositing, try making some contact shadows at the base of the tardis. It'll help it blend in better. Also, the tardis shines as it dematerializes. Try casting light on the adjacent walls and floor to sell this effect.  The lighting on the top of the tardis is a little dark. Think about the location of lights in your CG scene in relation to the light in the plate.  Keep at it!"
vfx,39qfz5,Incognizance,5,Sat Jun 13 19:22:29 2015 UTC,from one image probably not you'll need more information to triangulate where each pixel is .from video with a moving camera  you can use tools like pfDepth  .
vfx,39qfz5,514SaM,4,Sat Jun 13 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there are no algorithms that exist that can do it but obviously you can create one by hand. Depending on the complexity of the image and accuracy you are trying to achieve it could take minutes or hours to manually produce one.  When you think about the problem of calculating depth from a single image it feels like it might require some level of AI. When a human does it manually they make lots of assumptions based on what we know about the environment in the photograph. We can make a pretty good guess of how large any given object in the scene is and use that information combined with the lens length/focal distance to make pretty accurate guess at how far the object is from the lens.   There might not be any shortcuts so the process so a computer might also have to be able to identify key objects of known size and compare them with other objects of known sizes and make an educated guess as well. Being able to do all that seems like a pretty hard problem in itself to solve.  Although some sort of photosync like process might be able to find similar images and reconstruct a 3D model of the scene with some degree of accuracy. However, I still feel like a skilled artist can manually create one much faster and much more accurately."
vfx,39qfz5,wescotte,3,Sun Jun 14 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"When you think about the problem of calculating depth from a single image it feels like it might require some level of AI.   For some simple scenes, it may be possible to get a reasonable estimate with simple algorithms,  For many scenes, a good estimate of 3D from a single view would require very good AI indeed.  The world is full of optical illusions and forced perspective shots that fool human observers all the time, so reliable scene reconstruction would require significantly better than human level visual comprehension.  A classic example would be a ""city"" backdrop behind a window on the set of a TV show.  It looks more or less exactly like there is a city outside the window, and from a single still frame view you would just have to know how the set was built to say ""everything behind the window is on a flat backdrop a meter away."""

I figured at that point I might as well go full CG with the shoes, film myself running and then animate it based on that reference. That made me be able to do things you would have a harder time doing with green socks too, so it was a great choice, and the result was pretty good.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrqoLhgTZMI Keep in mind that was my student reel, so it isn't perfect!  In your case though, I wouldn't go CG because pure socks are much harder to rig and animate realistically than a shoe, so my advice would be to avoid any camera angles or movement where you see the inside of the sock, and if you ever do see the inside, make it fast so you can just paint a couple frames and motion blur will help.

vfx,39nnnp,RedPandaMediaGroup,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:24:39 2015 UTC,The technique is the same as with a green screen. Just figure out the keyer in your software of choice and apply it to the clip. This will leave holes in your video that you can fill in by just placing a still frame of the beginning of the clip (before you step into frame) behind the clip.
vfx,39nnnp,WDIIP,3,Sat Jun 13 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, this should work, but the clean plate might need a bit more work than just selecting a clean frame since there are shadows, reflections and glare on the dresser and the floor. It will probably create some hard edges or lighting discrepancies in the keyed out areas.  Be prepared for some roto work and some massaging of the clean plate.  Also, don't forget to key (will probably actually have to roto) out the tights in the reflection on the floor.  Edit: oh, and one more thing, every time the heel comes up off the floor you should be able to see the inside of the sock wrapped around the calf of the invisible leg. So you'll want to create a fake back/inside of the sock to make it look realistic."
vfx,39nnnp,adesimo1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"This will be done the same way all other green screens are done.   Take a plate of the first part of the shot with the talent not in it.  Key the tights. Adjust the thresholds accordingly to try and make up for the wrinkles. Watch the ground for spill also.  You're ""background"" will be the plate.  If this doesn't work how you want it, look into track mattes and how to refine them and use a track matte to reveal the background. In theory this is the same thing, however sometimes eliminates the problem of the plugin attempting to make edge adjustments for you.  Your quickest shot is to use key light in after effects so I would look up a tutorial for that. You can also change the view setting to combined matte and precomp the layer to create the track matte.  Hope this helps!"

We are currently constructing the set for the commercial and have tried to incorporate everything we could possibly need into it (removable walls, tracking markers, green screen with the proper markers).   While we DO do most most of the post in house like: editorial, DI, light VFX like screen replacement, roto, and tracking to place 3D elements into scenes, we feel this may be a bit above our current capacity. We are looking to do a set extension of a spaceship corridor, as well as composite smoke, sparks, digital UI's on the walls, and digital UIs on the characters and props. My questions are more geared towards what advice can we get to make sure we shoot this as future proof as possible to make sure any VFX artists will not have a tough time doing their specific job on it (roto, matchmoving, 3D, & comp). Also, getting things like chrome ball shots or shots for HDR. Anything we can do to help the VFX artists and make the process just that less painful since we are working with little to no budget on this. I'd like to get  as much ""don't do it this, way you idiots"" responses as I can. I can provide current pictures of the build as well as a link to the concept on a test site: http://nicpadula.com/indiewhip/4/ We plan to shoot it on an Alexa XT or a Dragon (maybe a bit too noisy for this).  The goal is to find junior artists (or seniors if they found this would be fun for them) who may not be able to work on something like this at their current position but want the chance/experience.

If there is little or no detail then add a few bits of gaffer tape around.  Set extension. Clean plate to clone up. Some tracking markers at the edge of set. Hope for a camera track but possible in 2d.  Not much you can do for smoke. If it is a moving camera and comes from a source you might need to simulate it in 3d.  sparks shoot an element against black and comp them on with 2d tracks  graphics on the walls have a few bits of gaffer tape to track there. think about removing them so they aren't in bad places  graphics on characters and props is harder. on a budget i think it's best to just to manually lien something up in post and see if you can fudge it. otherwise small tracking dots on these elements, 2d/planar track.  Don't think anyone uses chrome balls anymore. 5d, 8mm lense, 10 photos at different exposures x3 at every 120 degrees.  Don't think noise will be an issue with either camera.

vfx,39iioq,TheLordSnod,3,Fri Jun 12 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"This isn't new, it's been happening for at least twenty years. London's VFX industry (of which I am a part) for example, was created due to companies moving work here from America due to a more attractive subsidy. Most of my career (8 years) I've been working almost exclusively on films funded by American studios.  I agree that it's a race to the bottom, but it's not new. We'll just have to see how it'll play out."
vfx,39iioq,BlinkingZeroes,3,Fri Jun 12 10:10:32 2015 UTC,"I started out in London some 15 years ago now, there weren't significant subsidies then, the London FX industry was just starting to get rolling, Mill Film had just won the Oscar for Gladiator and everyone was busy trying to prove that London was just as good as Hollywood for effects work.  .. that meant long hours and no overtime while they tried to build the industry, but even now it's demonstrable that London is just as good as anyone else, the working conditions haven't changed.  The US has far better working conditions in my experience (turns out that when people get paid 1.5x for working extra hours, companies try not to have them do it), but, of course, the three big LA studios have all collapsed as a result of that.  When I left in 2004, everyone was complaining that nobody could match the US bids because of the exchange rate (strong GBP, weak USD), because the work was (and still is) doled out by the US studios, they had to ratchet up the subsidies to offset the exchange rate.   Strangely, even now that the exchange rate has gone back to earlier levels, the subsidies are still there."
vfx,39iioq,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"15 years ago UK was still basically a joke, one statue notwithstanding (The Mill got on pretty shaky ground there for a while not long after).  The UK industry didn't just get up to scratch with an infusion of cash, artificially pumping up the attractiveness of doing work there, they had to get a significant infusion of talent and experience from ""Hollywood"".  You can see the growing pains in those first several post-subsidy projects beginning with the first Harry Potter.  I had a few buddies that went to work at The Mill.  MPC had been around a while but they were pretty much a non-issue, no reel to speak of and weren't at all impressive when I checked them out at Pinewood (I was on loan to Gaumont from Digital Domain for a few months during filming of The Fifth Element).    The Mill was older but they were likewise a non-issue for the most part until association with the Scott Bros.  with Blackhawk Down and Gladiator.   When they came back I talked to them about their experience and going over to work a project or two because I wanted to visit London again they said don't bother, just go on vacation, because the pay was bad, the hours were bad and nobody knows what they're doing (this was 2001).  I guess now they know what they're doing but nothing else has changed.  Of course, if the winds of subsidies change there, as they could in Canada, I wonder how long and how much they'll be able to maintain now that they've moved out of the country into one of the most expensive parts of one of the most expensive cities to be on the planet.  Dude up there talking 20 years, nope.  Twenty years ago there wasn't anything significant coming out of the UK (edit: in 2005-2006 the work still wasn't fully competitive but it had improved, but they weren't really seen as an imminent threat yet because the work itself simply wasn't as good as what you could get from the big four studios in the US, or Weta, which relied almost completely on borrowed ""Hollywood"" talent).  20 years ago you could count on seeing better work from French companies like Buf."

Commercials heavy places? Sure, you need a front office with your supes in Soho because that's where all the ad agencies are, but feature films? They're all shot out in Shepperton, way the fuck out in the country, I mean shit, if you have clients flying in, why are you forcing them to go into central London when the airport is right by the fucking movie set?

vfx,39edop,LW791347910,10,Thu Jun 11 04:26:19 2015 UTC,"I would still recommend work in the vfx industry, with some significant caveats. It has been my experience that you can be successful in the industry if you meet certain criteria:  A) Have Talent         Try and keep a realistic perspective on how the quality of your work compares to your peers. Can you do anything they can? Can you do it faster? If you continually strive to improve your skills, it will help you significantly in your career. All the hard work won't mean dick if you can't finish the shot. If you want to be successful, you have to be able to do whatever is assigned to you.  B) Manage Your Time Correctly  A key aspect of being able to finish your shots is making realistic estimations on how much time you need to complete the task. A general rule of thumb would be to add 50% to account for screw ups and client bullshit. Nothing is worse than underestimating the time you need. Make sure that you stay on-top of all of the tasks that are assigned to you as you progress. Sometimes there is no avoiding a 10 or 12 hour day, but the better you get at managing your time (and your producers) the less you're going have to put up with those extra long days.  C) Don't be a Dick  A huge part of working with someone is actually interacting with them. If you are unpleasant to interact with, then you're probably not very fun to work with. We get to make some really cool stuff, and it's a lot more fun to work with someone who still gets excited about making movies. Sometimes we do have to work some shit hours, but if you stand up for yourself when negotiating your contracts, you will be fairly compensated for that time. If work is long, or the project is boring try not to sit around and gripe about it.   All of that, and being lucky doesn't hurt. I'm not gonna lie and say that getting a good job is easy in the VFX industry. It isn't. Things are volatile, and a lot of people have had their lives upended because their house went tits up. But if you get to know people, you see that people move around. After you've been working for a few years, you've probably worked with someone who is now at one of the major studios. If you have the skills, there is work.  As far as what you get paid for that work, I have had a good experience with compensation. I've been low-balled before, but I knew what my time was worth, and I had the abilities to back it up. I'm making more than enough to live, save for retirement, and still have fun. If you're willing to move around to different studios, then you can make even more. It's hard to make it into the industry, but there is room to advance."
vfx,39edop,userKname,4,Thu Jun 11 06:53:07 2015 UTC,"In other words your name can't be Dick.   But seriously C is one of the most important ones, I find someone who doesn't have A but isn't a dick or is very open most supervisors and teams are willing to teach them."
vfx,39edop,paxsonsa,7,Thu Jun 11 07:14:06 2015 UTC,Heh. Today is my last day in animation/vfx for the foreseeable future.
vfx,39edop,carolinax,3,Thu Jun 11 13:13:25 2015 UTC,As a first year student in VFX.  Please elaborate.  =/
vfx,39edop,iCo975,4,Thu Jun 11 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"This is not a job you do to make money or have a stable living arrangement. It's not a great choice if you want to have children. If you are ok with doing it because you love it and moving where the jobs take you, then do it.   Do you make enough to keep you happy? Well, we really don't have time outside work to spend any money to be honest. Industry standard is 10 hour days minimum."
vfx,39edop,GreenTeaZing,12,Thu Jun 11 06:15:50 2015 UTC,Why does everyone always say this? It's deterring potential new talent and isn't true from my perspective. I know plenty of friends and colleagues who make very stable livings and are quite happy.
vfx,39edop,cyphersk8,7,Thu Jun 11 09:07:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I know a lot of people who work in the large vfx houses that have very stable careers, Kids, mortgages, houses and happily get paid significantly above the national wage average.  VFX is by no means a happy utopia but every jobs could be the same. I've been employed for 15+ years over many jobs. If you know what you're doing and you continually innovate yourself, getting a job is straight forward"
vfx,39edop,sabreToothBucket,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:49:26 2015 UTC,Do you find that's true for more junior artists just entering?
vfx,39edop,carolinax,2,Thu Jun 11 13:17:40 2015 UTC,It's all dependant on supply and demand. There is a major oversupply of mediocre junior to mid artists. The vast majority apply to the larger vfx houses. This means you have to exceptionally good in order to get noticed and to stay.  There are junior artists that continue on quite happily but they need to be as good as the artists applying.  Does that make sense?  I would recommend applying to a smaller generalist place where you'll learn a lot more. Others would argue differently but i am yet to see a very good supervisor that hasn't had a rounded generalist background.
vfx,39edop,sabreToothBucket,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"I think this is the point here. If you are just entering, its going to be extremely difficult to pay off student loans/start a family etc. We've been in the industry 5 years. If we had a 15 year work history already stability might be a different story."
vfx,39edop,GreenTeaZing,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"I find that entering artists are in the same boat as seasoned veterans. It really depends on how you evaluate yourself when you get in. Stay relevant, do good work, and you will be happily employed.  To get in, find people that work where you want to work and make friends. People refer people they know and trust. Most of the time it's about knowing someone than your reel."
vfx,39edop,cyphersk8,-1,Thu Jun 11 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"This. Very much this. Glad to hear you're doing well, too."
vfx,39edop,cyphersk8,4,Thu Jun 11 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"Because for the most part it's true. The top percentile will have stable happy lives doing Vfx, but most will not."
vfx,39edop,o0flatCircle0o,5,Thu Jun 11 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by stable.  I'm completely confident in my ability to land a job at pretty much any studio, but the fact remains that the jobs themselves keep migrating to wherever is offering the most free money.  Time was, the work used to migrate to the places that did the best work for the best price, which wasn't something that changed rapidly.  Now it goes to whichever studios have the biggest subsidy this year, which is entirely at the whim of local politicians rather than the abilities of the shops in question, the entire Vancouver VFX bubble is one election away from bursting, whereupon everyone will be expected to uproot their lives and move somewhere else."
vfx,39edop,kyoseki,2,Thu Jun 11 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Like Montreal.  There's so many people that don't see, or deny, this change coming.  And then what happens when they all decide they've been getting back pennies on the dollar and most of the money has been going into the pockets of non-Canadian citizens and the gravy train stops?  They aren't that stupid that they don't recognize the shell game going on and how all of the facilities are gaming the residency requirements for the free money, so that they can offer the prices that they do."
vfx,39edop,BurnetRhoades,5,Thu Jun 11 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"Given the general exodus to Vancouver, I think it's only a matter of time before the program becomes too expensive to ignore - the BC budget forecasts the program cost to grow $10m a year over the next couple years, but in past years it's grown $70-100m annually.  With the number of people opening studios there now (Sony, DNeg & Animal Logic are all planning on expanding rapidly), I can see that accelerating.  The question is whether or not the BC politicians are effectively being paid to keep supporting the industry, like Cuomo was shown to be in the Sony hack emails, but again, this comes down to one election from changing. BC is having significant trouble funding education, so it'll be interesting if the teacher's union realizes that there's close to half a billion a year being thrown at Hollywood.  Then, of course, there's the fact that these subsidies are technically against WTO rules, that could be a very interesting development that the ADAPT guys were exploring before they disbanded.  It's entirely possible that some lawsuit entirely unrelated to films will end up getting countervailing duties applied to imported digital products which will destroy most of the foreign satellite studios overnight and given that there's very little film effects work done in the US at this point, I can see that crippling Hollywood's superhero movie addiction."
vfx,39edop,kyoseki,0,Thu Jun 11 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"The question is whether or not the BC politicians are effectively being paid to keep supporting the industry, like Cuomo was shown to be in the Sony hack emails   Or the other way around.  I couldn't provide a second party's confirmation but Prime Focus reportedly paid a big kickback to the production of Sin City 2, supposedly without Robert Rodriguez' knowledge, in order for the work to come to them.    They were really sketchy about what was up with them getting the work when I asked and when I was told that by a source I trust it more or less made sense.  But that's just a rumor and this is just the internet so, whatevs."
vfx,39edop,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:06:47 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't surprise me, I think that was when they were chasing a US IPO so being able to say they produced the FX for an entire Hollywood movie was a big deal for them.  R&H was awarded a large chunk of the work on the show at one point, that mysteriously ended up being unawarded a week later, apparently at Prime Focus' insistence - threatening to pull their funding would certainly have explained the amount of influence they seemed to have, because there's no way a regular VFX vendor would have that kind of clout.  I'm still curious how the DNeg buyout will go, DNeg were bleeding money ($15m+ annually) before the buyout, but now Prime Focus are. My guess is that as soon as the Vancouver office is shown to be operational, we'll start seeing the ""let's all move to Canada!"" cheerleading that all the US studios have been doing for the past few years."

I would say ""for obvious reasons"" but apparently it had to do with their 911 work on Machete Kills of all things.  I saw the movie and I'd have asked for the VFX equivalent to an Alan Smithee on that one (acknowledging sometimes there's only so much that can be done) but he was, I guess, really happy.  I know first hand that even if he doesn't always seem too particular on look and ultimate quality he is really particular on how well he feels treated as a client.  He'd already blown through two or three different studios on The Faculty when he settled on working with CFX and Hybride.  Word on the street was he wasn't happy with the way Sin City 2 went down.   I just felt kinda bad for the guys over at Troublemaker."

vfx,39edop,kyoseki,2,Thu Jun 11 06:16:47 2015 UTC,"Ten years ago, I'd have said unequivocally yes, these days, I'd advise against it.  The industry has gotten fucked over by the movie studios to the degree that I can't see any long term future in it, the wages will continue to be depressed and artists will still be expected to chase their jobs from subsidy to subsidy as starry eyed legislators get conned (or bribed) into throwing ever increasing wads of cash at movie studios.  If you're still interested in the field, I would aim for one of the more technical disciplines like fx td and make sure you have the math & programming skills to switch industries later."
vfx,39edop,iCo975,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how vfx has been ""fucked over by the movie studios""?  Also how subsidies come into play here?  I'm planning on minoring in technical direction and learning python and everything.  Am I fucked as a VFX student?  You guys are scaring me.  I'll graduate with zero debt though so there's that.."
vfx,39edop,kyoseki,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:17:08 2015 UTC,"VFX houses all basically work for the same six customers, the ""big six"" movie studios, which means they have to maintain that relationship or they just don't get any work in the future.  In the past, that effectively just meant agreeing to an awful lot of unpaid extra work as vfx supervisors and directors kept changing their minds and expanding the scope of shots far beyond what they were budgeted for, which is why most vfx houses operate at a loss.  These days, however, doing the studio's bidding means chasing international subsidies. In Vancouver & Montreal, the government has decided they want to buy the visual effects industry (for reasons best known to themselves, I don't know how stupid you have to be to see an industry as broken as visual effects and think ""yep, I want a piece of that action""), so work done there is subsidized by local taxpayers to the tune of 35-45% of the total cost (VFX is all labor, and BC subsidizes VFX labor at 58.4% when combined with the Canadian Federal subsidy). That's a HUGE savings for the movie studio, so they basically tell the VFX houses that they have to do the work in Vancouver or they don't get the job.  This means the VFX houses have to shoulder the cost of founding and staffing a second (or third, or fourth) facility for no reason other than free money from local taxpayers, all of which goes to the movie studio rather than the VFX house.  It's creating a VFX bubble in Vancouver, there's too many studios, not enough artists and the whole situation is only present because of free money that could stop tomorrow if local politicians decide they don't want to keep trying to buy their way into the film industry, whereupon everything will collapse and they'll have just created a new generation of VFX nomads who have to chase their jobs to whichever location is offering the most generous subsidy then.  It also means that junior artists are going to have a hell of a time landing an entry level gig anywhere that isn't Vancouver or Montreal, which means you need to be a Canadian citizen or have Canadian residency already - nobody is going to file a visa for a fresh graduate, there are enough Canadian colleges pumping out juniors to fill those seats.  It also means that senior artists are getting asked to move to Canada all the damned time. They want us to do the same job for the same company on the same movie, they just want us to do it in another country so that local taxpayers will cover half our salary.  It took me 10 years to get US citizenship, now I'm expected to move to Canada just so that the movie studios can keep cranking out their CGI craptaculars for a few less bucks?  I've had it, I'm not going to uproot my life again to move to an artificially supported market. The costs are escalating rapidly as everyone chases the free money, sooner or later it's going to get too expensive to ignore, a crash is inevitable at this point and I don't envy the people living/working in Vancouver when it does."

That whole gov't subsidized VFX bubble thing is so weird.  That definitely sounds like a bubble that will pop whenever the politicians stop the funding like you said.  Should I worry as a first year VFX student?  You said focusing on the more technical and programming/math oriented stuff is the way to go?  So learning python and stuff like that?  I'm minoring in technical direction as well so there's that."

I'll be honest, I would certainly be concerned, but if you're 2-3 years away from graduating, who the hell knows what will change between now and then?   BC's VFX subsidies (as with all VFX subsidies) are part of a larger program to try to woo film shoots to a particular locale (at the MPAA's urging), so if the regular film subsidies become politically inconvenient, the VFX subsidies will go away as well.  This is starting to happen. Louisiana was the first state to offer film subsidies in the 90s, they started this whole mess. They've spent twenty years and a couple billion dollars and now they're having to cut back on their subsidies people are announcing the death knell of the industry their (seriously, apparently $180m a year just isn't enough for Hollywood and they're probably right).  If Louisiana's industry collapses after the amount of money and effort they've pumped into it, it pretty much kills the idea that you can build a self sustaining film industry through subsidies. Once that happens (and it will) I think you'll start seeing other states and territories realize what a boondoggle these things are.  That could happen in 6 months when Louisiana's new cap kicks in, or it could happen in a couple years when the next state runs dry and has to cut Hollywood off, but given how wasteful these things are, sooner or later they're going to become political poison and at that point, the whole thing will fly apart at the seams.  Either way, in order to maximize survivability, you need to excel in areas that are largely underserved. In the current climate, that's primarily the technical areas that are math & code/script heavy. Math, in general, is incredibly useful in visual effects, it allows you to understand what the software is doing at a fundamental level and if you understand that, then transitioning from package to package is much easier (including proprietary software), plus, in terms of commercial software, Houdini has probably the most job openings right now and you can't get the most out of it unless you're pretty comfortable with a few key mathematical concepts."
vfx,39edop,iCo975,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:58:08 2015 UTC,I think the VFX program where I'm at really focuses on Houdini.  What kinda mathematical concepts are most important in VFX would you say?  Also python is the main programming language in vfx correct?  Thanks again for the detailed replies.
vfx,39edop,kyoseki,2,Tue Jun 16 11:57:01 2015 UTC,"Python is the primary scripting language these days, yeah, it's pretty well integrated into Houdini and obviously there are a lot of command line tools written in it (which is why the big studios all run linux).  Houdini's operators are written primarily in VEX (vector expression language), which is a very math heavy scripting language. You can write operators in python, but they're very slow in comparison to VEX. VEX is fairly akin to Renderman Shading Language in syntax, so it's pretty easy to work in, there are no pointers or memory issues to worry about.  You really need to be comfortable with vector & matrix math, you need to understand things like transform matrices (which really aren't that hard) and space transforms.   If you're planning on doing fluids work, then an understanding of vector calculus is very important (which sounds a lot scarier than it is)   An understanding of basic calculus in terms of using integrals & derivatives to drive animation is also necessary (if you basically get that distance is the integral of speed over time and speed is the integral of acceleration, you're 90% of the way there) because a lot of the time you want to use first and second derivatives to trigger certain events for example.  Learning how shading math works is also incredibly useful as we do a lot of our lighting & rendering in Houdini, and knowing how to build your own shaders will help you immensely.  Handily, whether it's a shader, or a geometry operator, an image operator or a point replication procedural, they all share a common language, VEX, there are just certain functions that show up in one context that may not be available in another.   VEX is essentially a small (or large) compiled program that operates in a loop, whether that loop is over points, polygons, pixels, shading samples or any number of other things, VEX usually doesn't care about, as long as it gets the inputs it wants, it'll let you modify the outputs.  There's two books I'd recommend, the first is Advanced Renderman, which is quite old and out of date, but gives you a solid understanding of shading mechanics & the math involved there and also ""Essential Mathematics for Computer Graphics Fast"" by John Vince, which is a great introductory text for the vector math side of things.  You may be able to find both of them as PDFs online, if not, just buy them second hand on Amazon."

If by VFX you mean specifically doing movies, I would just suggest you keep yourself open to the many other aspects of digital art. Doing 3d work on high end commercials is a lot of fun. There is also a lot of work in the tech industry as well.   I freelance between the different industries. Sometimes I have to swing up to San Jose for a few weeks but most of the time I have plenty of work here in Los Angeles. You can usually find a good company doing good quality advertising work in any major city. The gaming industry is also large and all over the world.

It's not just a matter of paying a fee and filling out a form, the firm has to make a case with immigration that the imported labor somehow fills a need that they can't satisfy with the local talent or labor pool.  They have to at least imply that they've looked and exhausted their options in that regard.    It's going to be a lot harder to make that case for someone with little experience.

As I am sure a bunch of other artists will be commenting here shortly I will just add this.  VFX, as it is right now, is not your 9-5 job/career. We do this because we love it. To do what we love, as with anything, we sacrifice some things in our lives. Those sacrifices vary but one of the major ones is time. If you don't mind I would like to give you one piece of advice, do it because you love it and do it your way."

I have friends who became film makers, directors, DOP's, moved into management positions, or started their own production companies(not my recommendation). While I feel as though I've neglected my options and now I'm rushing to catch up while losing passion for the work. I make plenty of money to live quite a comfortable life at the moment, but artist daily rates have been forced down as far as I can tell. VFX did allow me to travel the world and I moved from Canada to Australia which is pretty sweet, so I wouldn't call it a waste."

We baked the animation into fbx files, and exported point cache for the deformations from 3dsmax and imported it to Blender. Blender is our main 3d software, because of its speed, quick workflow and still have the ability to produce high-end quality images. The scene is blocked out, and lit with a HDRI from set with extra lights where it was needed.    We rendered it out as a multi-layered EXR with the necessary passes. I did the compositing in Nuke, bringing the passes together with some CG smoke, candle lights, lightrays, air particles all made in Nuke."

vfx,38xagq,NOFREENAME,3,Sun Jun 7 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"you should be able to get the distance to the camera with the gl_FragDepth variable. This variable should store a value between 0 and 1 where 0 is the near plane and 1 is the far plane.  you can then plug this value into the smoothstep function to create a mask for your attenuation. Invert the resulting value and multiply the ouput color (gl_FragColor) by this value and you should get, what you want.  Have a look here for how the smoothstep function is defined. It basically remaps a [0..1] range to the range you specify which in your case would be [start_of_attenuation .. black].  if you want more help, look over into /r/OpenGL."

Perhaps Tim has still kept in touch with him.  Tim hired me out of CalArts in '92 and I worked at Metrolight a year and a half (until joining DD when it was first starting up).  I got to work with George on a project or two and we'd go to lunch and stuff.  I'd pick his brain about the early days of the company (all of those guys, really), and what he did for Total Recall in particular.  What I recall, he was one of the freelance super-stars they'd pull in from time to time for the hard stuff, like Doc Bailey and Minh.  They still had the device, back in the 3-Space digitizing room which doubled as storage for some older equipment.  We dubbed it ""the roto torture device"" and he looked at that thing with real hatred, what I remember.  It left such an impression on me, whenever I was digitizing a model I consciously tried to never get too close to it, even though it wasn't plugged in.  I never once questioned whether the sense of PTSD associated with that project was real because other folks who were around at the time seemed to go out of their way to be, I dunno, ""gentle"" with George.  It only added to the mythos of that place for me.  I was only 20 when Tim hired me but I'd been following the company from the beginning and Robert Abel & Associates before that (and PDI and R+H).

vfx,38j5ar,Keyframe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no problem.  So once I've tracked all of the 'best' points to get a good camera solve (areas of high contrast, good spread of points throughout the frame... etc). In 3DEqualizer you can continue adding 2d points setting them to 'passive' so that they don't affect the camera solve, but their position in 3d space will be calculated. You can place these on harder to track areas (like the corner of a stair) but place them manually every 10 frames or so. Then do this for everything that would make a good verticey for a polygon, and in Maya you can connect the verts together to make your geometry. Hope that helps!?"

My problem is that although the tracks are good and the solve's accuracy is also good the resulting point cloud is skewed a bit. Yesterday I tried to match my geometry to the footage in nuke's modelbuilder, but it was somewhat skewed. I know skewing is a result of bad focal length setup, and I tried to constrain the points, give them survey data where I have that and I ran a parameter adjustment in 3DE but somehow if I try to fit a cube around the scene, the walls and corners are not lining up.

Even at big studios, shots are rarely perfect."
vfx,38gmmn,krets,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"1) Block out your shot first. Get your camera moves sorted and locked off. this will be your guide as to which facades you see, and which ones can get away with cutting corners.  2) Are you talking about building a 37k+ texture? that's overkill. It 'll probably take longer to load the image than it will to render a frame of your animation.  3) If the buildings aren't the focus of the shot, try to get away with mapping photos onto surfaces instead of building complex geometry. After motion blur, camera focus and lens effects, you can get away with a lot. Not that i'm recommending that. but if time is a factor you need to work smart.  4) My opinion would be to first block out your action in a very simple animatic.  Build simple geometry to represent your buildings so you know what you need to build. Then go to site at the time of day your shot is set at. And take buttloads of reference photos. Ideally, take front-on photos of buildings which you can use to camera map onto the surface of buildings as a quick way of getting them textured. If you have access to a chrome sphere, take bracketed exposure photos of that from different angles and locations to get light probe reading of the area which you can use to replicate the lighting and reflections fairly accurately.  Note, if you're starting your shot up in the air, showing the city block. Then you're going to have to consider building that entire city block in 3d.   Ambitious undertaking for sure. Good luck."

vfx,38f5u6,kyoseki,2,Wed Jun 3 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"Thirded, competitions don't mean squat in this industry when it comes to hiring."
vfx,38f5u6,ornamental_conifer,8,Thu Jun 4 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"Without question, the real world experience matters FAR more.   Understanding how production environments work, working with teams, following direction, working within an established system etc. are all things an employer needs.   A guy who can make a short film all by himself? Doesn't prove much of anything to a hiring manager."
vfx,38f5u6,beenyweenies,2,Wed Jun 3 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"If you plan on getting hired anywhere, I'd say go with the work experience. That'll be much more valuable when you're job hunting. If you plan on going freelance, and you need to beef up your show reel and IMDB to impress clients, I'd say go with the short film. Of course I have no idea how long you've already been placed at the production house. Maybe you already have plenty of experience of the CV. It all depends, and it's hard to say without more information about what you've already done and what you want to do."
vfx,38f5u6,zeldn,2,Wed Jun 3 20:54:57 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you want really. If you want to get a normal job the work experience in the post-production place would be the better option. But doing this 7 week short film could lead to interesting opportunities you mightn't have considered yet, if you're going to be exposed to all aspects of the short film production (pre-production/shoot/sound etc) it could be a better learning experience then doing roto and paint on a couple of films for 7 weeks.  If you can see real potential in the short film I'd say go for it...once you're in the working world these opportunities don't come up too often.  Whichever you chose, make sure you give it 110% and it will pay off. From my experience people who have these opportunities while they're studying quickly end up employed by the end anyway...I wouldn't worry too much about getting a job at the end, it'll happen, just experience as much as you can!  Good luck!"

vfx,38curz,dotfilmphoto,10,Wed Jun 3 11:54:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, looks great for a first time!  First thing I would say is cut back on the vhs and lens effects.  They don't really help with your composition and if anything show off any integration issues.  Your black and white levels are quite off on your robot.  The whites are way too over exposed compared to your plate, and the darks are a bit crushed and overly red (although it is hard to tell with the amount of chromatic abberation applied)  The lighting direction also doesn't tie in with the plate, the shadows are the wrong direction and the key light doesn't seem to be coming from the correct position either.    All that said, good first attempt and keep practising!"
vfx,38curz,brass___monkey,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that despite applying the VHS artifacting to the CG, the CG element still looked a bit too good for the original plate.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm thinking that in some angles the video is underexposed compared to the CG.  I think it also could be softened up just a smidge more.  You are definitely pretty close to being spot on though.  The amount you are trying to sell the ""crappy VHS"" look is more of a creative choice and is up to the director."
vfx,38curz,Sloore,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:35:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys. I'll take your suggestions in. I had thought the VHS was a bit intense but only after sober reflection the morning after release. I'll keep that in mind next time I have to do any kind of drastic ""look""."

vfx,38eo8n,Lyle_Landly,6,Wed Jun 3 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"Paint, root and complex compositing in general is more suited to a node based workflow, because the ability to quickly assess how lots of different layers, passes and masks are interconnected is critical, and the node based workflow makes building those connections easier and simpler to comprehend.  For keyframe animation and motion graphics, a layer based timeline is usually more desirable, because it lets you quickly assess the timing and layer order of your work, and you often won't be building interconnected webs like you will in compositing.  Of course there's much more to this, and I don't know if that's what was meant by the comment in the video. That's just my own experience. I'd suggest looking up some more comprehensive comparisons. I think School of Motion did one that explains this more in depth. It doesn't mention paint and roto I think, but lots of the same points apply."
vfx,38eo8n,zeldn,2,Wed Jun 3 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"Paint in AE used to be pretty bad ass with Vector Paint but they went and screwed it up.  Paint is awful, buggy and slow, in CC and damned inconvenient the way it's implemented now.  edit: also, AE isn't and has never been especially good at roto.  Thirteen to fifteen years ago, when it was even worse, there was the option of doing all your tracking and roto in Commotion.  But Puffin sold out to Pinnacle to be EOL'd and then Avid bought Pinnacle and it remained EOL.  I've used AE for roto, grudgingly, once I could no longer run Commotion on what would be a contemporary OS and hardware, but lately I've switched to using Mocha for mattes and then importing the shapes.   Adobe has realistically done very little to improve baseline functionality from fifteen years ago or more, while removing one of the most useful tools in the whole application (Vector Paint).  It's shameful.  It's cheap and not entirely useless if you've got the patience and few alternatives.  Message to Adobe: feel free to use that in future marketing all you want, ""cheap and not entirely useless."""
vfx,38eo8n,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:52:20 2015 UTC,Nuke can paint and roto pretty well against AE but I think that most post-houses do the roto in silhouette now days and then comp it into the rest of the work in nuke. silhouette is specific to roto and has much more accurate and faster working tools for more complex roto shapes than nuke. It depends on the shot. if its a simple object nuke will do the job. but high detail matte pulling like hair's for example is just easier to perform in silhouette. As for your question I think it's talking about layer based vs node based compositing. basically layers can only go one on top another. where as with a node tree you can have multiple roto shapes for example that track different objects on the original plate and merge them together in lot's of different ways that recreate a 3dimensional perspective once your greenscreen has been replaced or once you insert a 3d object.

What I've come to learn is that nuke is the best tool on a shot by shot basis. But if you are doing a lot of repetitive tasks like making bumpers or lower thirds after effects is the guy for the job. If you need a robust motion tracker and the best green screen tools around then nuke is your boy. Basic masks and tracking can be achieved quit easily in AE but tougher tracks are more easily done in nuke. Use the tool you like though. You can achieve most things in AE, except some 3D projection although that might be achievable with the new raytrace features in AE. Learn Nuke anyways. It's a great skill to have. Digital Tutors is like 30 bucks a month and has some great courses on it. Good Luck!"

vfx,3891ut,BurnetRhoades,3,Tue Jun 2 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"If you're an editor you're likely going to get what you need with AE.  You're not doing work that needs to scale.  AE isn't as efficient and offers a pretty horrible paradigm for anything beyond a few layers, but it's workable and for the kind of work you're doing it'll be cheaper and totally effective.  Also, node-based isn't a hurdle.  It's an easier workflow because it's logical.  The workarounds in After Effects that must be employed for what would be dead simple in a node-based approach are actually more cumbersome, not intuitive and become effectively hidden from view, making it more of a pain to inherit work started by someone else.  The convolution aspect you have backwards.  After Effects is completely convoluted once you get beyond elementary A-over-B level stuff."
vfx,3891ut,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to say node-based is difficult or convoluted.  I'm sure there's just a psychological barrier as exists between any different UX philosophies.  Like watching people from FCP7 try and understand Avid.  Once you're in, it's more effective (i think so anyway... I'm sure that could be battled over forever).  Your second paragraph seems to invalidated the first.  If its less convoluted, more powerful, I have it, and am willing to learn it, why would I stick with After Effects?  And thank you for the reply!  Much appreciated."
vfx,3891ut,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"The second doesn't invalidate the first, it's based on the assumption that the work you described isn't terribly complex.  AE's paradigm is very similar to that of a nonlinear editor (and this is also why it isn't very good at complicated, multi-layered work).  You're going to have an easier time, I would expect, integrating AE into your workflow.  Nuke doesn't work well with stream-based media (ie. QT, AVI, etc.) it works better with frames.  AE can bring in XML-based EDLs from FinalCut and has at least some compatibility with Avid and can import Premiere files directly with decent compatibility.  And Nuke isn't a motion graphics tool by any stretch of the imagination.    Nuke is designed to do high end compositing and do that well, and that's pretty much it.  Compositing is a secondary concern for After Effects, where motion graphics are its strongest features."
vfx,3891ut,Greystoke1337,2,Tue Jun 2 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"Ahh interesting.  Stream based vs. frames is a really good point.  If it's a slog to work with compressed media, that's a good reason to stick with AEX.  Transcoding for offline comps doesn't seem worth it.    Thanks, that's helpful.   EDIT:  I might add that offline comps are surprisingly complex these days.  Agencies expect a lot more from them than in the past.  Often times, my After Effects comps are 20-40 layers, frame-roto'd, and filled with expressions.  I don't agree with creating complex comps that are just getting dumped to be redone by a Flame artist, but it's the times we live in, I guess."
vfx,3891ut,514SaM,0,Tue Jun 2 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's an unexpected hang-up that's bit us a few times working with Alexa ProRes footage.  We did a music video where we were having to generate client QTs as a post-process in After Effects.  Not the end of the world but it was annoying.    And we do end up transcoding almost everything for our main Nuke driver when it comes in as ProRes, which is almost everything but the clients shooting on Red.  Hopefully this is something that the new Foundry makes a priority in the future, now that they can concentrate on their additions to Nuke (QT being one of them I'm sure) rather than generating revenue by any means.  edit: and for the complicated stuff, it's still doable in AE it's just a little more painful (I have to, because the shop I'm at can't afford multiple Nuke licenses...I'm even using my own CC account when I'm on the box at the office).  The roto tools in AE aren't very good, but you get Mocha.  I've started doing my roto in Mocha even if I'm not tracking, because the splines are better and you can leverage the tracking to give you a hand in any case with sticking shapes.  Then just import the shapes.  Meanwhile the planar tracker in Nuke isn't as good as Mocha (though the point tracker in Nuke is better than AE).  There's no equivalent, at least yet, in Nuke, for having access to something like Element 3D in AE."
vfx,3891ut,beenyweenies,2,Tue Jun 2 20:45:50 2015 UTC,Most definitely. Nuke is more powerful but much pricier as well. Really depends on the size of the shots you are going to work on.

I no longer live in NY, but when I was last working in the city over a year ago I earned more than that freelancing with the same experience that you have, and I also previously held a position earning $115,000 with even less experience at a small commercial VFX shop (although I don't think what I earned was typical for my experience at the time, and it wasn't without its drawbacks). Freelancing has its drawbacks as well, so it really depends on what you're looking for with your employment.

I've almost always found the best way to increase your pay is to switch companies.

By its nature 2d tracking is always object tracking (can't be camera tracking).  2d is that you would think of as 1, 2 , or 4 point tracking.  2d tracking is used to get simple motion, like, if you wanted to track a logo onto a car.   That would be 4point (also called corner pin).  3d object tracking is often called matchmoving.  Its a combination of 2d tracking and animation. So this would be used if say, you wanted to put a cg bird on someones shoulder who is turning around in a shot.  A simple 2d track wouldn't work here.  Make sense?  Typically when you talk about Artists who are ""trackers"" they only deal with 3d tracks, and most all 2d tracks are handled by compositors."

vfx,386cfj,di3l0n,3,Tue Jun 2 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"Thats an interesting example... is actually both camera and (3d) object tracking.  Think of it like this... if this was real.  Would the portals be moving?  No right?  In the sense that they are stuck to a place. So that would be done with a camera track, because only the camera is moving.  Once you get a good camera track, and find in 3d space where the portal should be placed, you put it there and leave it.  Now with the arm... thats a 3d object track.  because the arm is moving independently of the camera.    I'm not a tracker, so listen to them first, but I'm pretty sure the process would be to track the camera, and build simple geo for the space (walls, floor).  Then once the camera is solved, track the arm for movement."

vfx,386cfj,di3l0n,0,Wed Jun 17 20:57:35 2015 UTC,Is 3d object tracking the same as geometry tracking?
vfx,386cfj,di3l0n,2,Tue Jun 2 22:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, 3d camera and object tracking. You track static points for a good camera solve (like corners of walls, stairs, whatever as long as it doesn't move). Then you would track the points on the object (like the spheres they had on their real world portal gun stand in, and solve thats 3D position/movement relative to the camera. Its important to note that the trackers for the object and the camera aren't interchangeable, using trackers from the object to solve the camera will wreck the solve. There's a lot to understand and learn, you need to feed the software your camera lens and film back info, and have good ""survey"" data and measurements, among other things like lens distortion, plate preparation bla bla bla.   I have only used Syntheyes (which is pretty fantastic), and the camera tracker built into Nuke (no 3d object tracking). I've heard great things about pftrack boujou and 3d equaliser. Up to you to find which one you can get your hands on. Blender also has a camera tracker, dunno if it does object tracking or not. I would suggest doing a few tests/projects with just camera tracking and adding 3d elements into the scene before running ahead and doing object+camera tracking.

Silhouette FX is a great stand-alone bit of software that you should practice with - it's only focus is roto, and may be better to work with that so as not to get distracted by the rest of the complexity of Nuke.

If you are a compositor, being well acquainted with Maya is practically useless, same can be said of being a modeler and knowing Nuke.    Knowing how different departments work can be helpful for getting the job done and communicating with other artists, but when it comes to getting a job in the first place, it isn't as helpful.  However, the more often someone asks ""can you use X?"" and you can answer ""yes"" the more you will be working.  The caveat to that is that when the followup of ""are you good at it?"" is asked, your had better be able to truthfully say ""yes"" as well."

I feel like you could explore with some of the bounce settings for certain table scenes, the particles sometimes come to stillness rather quickly and unfortunately it's easier to decipher the camera track that way.  I feel like the particles never change size from shot to shot. They seem the same size up close, or further away like on the shed shot.  On some of the macro shots, I wonder if you could make a secondary particular layer for more controlled boca closer to the camera. It would be cool if some of the particles got so close that they were large compared to the other particles, and the DoF would be really exaggerated, which is cool!  Overall I love the motion of the particles, and the air/turbulence settings you chose. The color is nice too. Good luck!"
vfx,37y2oc,shaneisshort,1 point,Sun May 31 10:45:59 2015 UTC,"You are not layering your effect properly. First of all, you should apply effects depending of their depth, in this case, your black grime (burnt texture ?) should be comped on top of the plate BEFORE you layer in the fire. For an easy fix of your black / white issue, apply a white constant in the background input of your scan line renderer (the one of the burnt texture). Then you can layer in the result as you see fit. Second thing: do not screen your fire. Fire is not an additive process, it has opacity and should be layered in Over.   You may have to edit your luma key on your fire to give it proper edges."
vfx,37y2oc,TurtleOnCinderblock,2,Sun May 31 12:10:05 2015 UTC,"Is fire really never an additive process? Depending on the exposure of A: the fire plate B: the bg plate, I often get great results with adding (or hypot).  Sometimes it's necessary to do a separate layer of keyed fire for the core of the flame, but lower opacity/exposure areas (dimmer red fire) at the edges  seems to do better being added. I notice a lot of poorly comped fire plates that look like they've been luma keyed harshly. Maybe it's just about being careful with the key falloff.   Also if the fire isn't necessarily way brighter than the bg plate, eg daylight scene, then the plate shouldn't have  so many blown out patches. Otherwise when you lower its opacity, they just look grey. In my experience, finding/using a fire plate that is exposed properly relative to the scene exposure is one of the most important parts.   Without adding, what's the best way to introduce +1 values to the comped fire when it's meant to be delivered in log for later color sessions etc. ?   Sorry for rambling but very interested in your opinion. For some reason I end up doing a lot of fire comps."
vfx,37y2oc,rotoshake,1 point,Sun May 31 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the layering, I also disagree that you ""over fire"".  I've never done anything but a screen or add, and I've done tons of fire."

I'm open to hear your reasons."
vfx,37y2oc,TurtleOnCinderblock,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think the participating media in fire could be used with a merge over since part of the flame will be composed of fine particles etc. and will act like a translucent material.   However, the light in most fire comes from many very hot carbon atoms (obviously not all types of fire have carbon present, but most, especially regarding effects composites) giving off thermal radiation within the visible spectrum. If the radiation wasn't in the visible spectrum then we would probably not see a whole lot apart from the smoke, it would certainly be a lot less visible than normal fire.   So most of the colour of the flame comes from light, which is very much an additive process. Otherwise using didymium glasses to filter out the light given off from flame for glassblowers so they can see what they are working on, wouldn't work at all (see how the glasses work here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZT5kCc0CQ ).   Fire is really strange, physically, so some of what I've said may be incorrect because I don't understand it very well. But I think the basic idea is correct to the best of mine and Google's knowledge :P.  So I think in general you're looking for a balance between an over and an additive merge mode for fire."
vfx,37y2oc,BWAAMP,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:19:15 2015 UTC,"I guess if it was a rendered element with a perfect alpha, you would do an over.  That said any time you use a fire element, the process of pulling a key, and premulting it rarely gives a better result then just adding it.   It may be that when someone says fire element, I think of a shot element, and if someone was speaking about a fire render, I would expect them to call it a fire render, fx pass, etc.  May be a bit of semantics here."
vfx,37y2oc,petersid7,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:07:14 2015 UTC,An over is simply a Plus that deals with a present alpha channel.

There would be no reason to do an over as black pixels (value: 0) when added to any value leave you with the original value.  Hence, no need for an Over as an alpha is not needed.

Plate is the background - First layer in nuke b channel or bottom layer in AE.  Take your black and white element and put it over a white constant so that you have white outside the box.    Multiply that element over the background, dial to taste.  Put the fire layer next, with and add, screen or over, depending on the source of the element.  Then go back to the original plate and roto the guy... Pre mult him and put him over all the other layers.    If you want to sent me your script I can re arrange it quickly for you... shoot me a PM"

vfx,37whn8,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun May 31 03:21:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to watch and give feedback, I appreciate it! I wasn't necessarily intending to have a lot of lens flare to obscure the ship.  I'd love to show the ship more, but I'm trying to balance that desire with the fact that there is only one external light source strong enough to illuminate the ship, and that light is always behind the ship as it voyages away from the sun.  The ship is actually pretty cool, so I put on the little lights mounted on the hull to try and illuminate it a bit. Thanks for your feedback!"
vfx,37whn8,BurnetRhoades,2,Mon Jun 1 20:44:10 2015 UTC,"There are two things this needs to overcome the feeling of it being a model that can be meaningfully measured in inches.  It needs to be slower, because large objects, even when they're moving at a high rate of speed, appear to be moving slowly when viewed by someone at our scale.  Second, something that I'm guessing is supposed to represent a ship the size of a McMansion or larger would be entirely in focus.  In order to frame something large like this you would be so backed off that even with the Barry Lyndon f/0.7 planar 50mm the thing would be beyond the hyperfocal distance and all in focus even if you were wide open.  Focus falloff means close to camera."
vfx,37whn8,BurnetRhoades,2,Sun May 31 04:24:02 2015 UTC,Good feedback.  Thank you for taking the time! I need deep focus and slower motion. Thanks!
vfx,37whn8,82364,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"One of the other suggestions for shooting high speed and then slowing down is a good one.  The only problem I foresee is perhaps not having enough light to get a good exposure when stopped down, at an ISO that doesn't introduce a lot of noise.  Classic miniatures, shot frame-by-frame with a motion-control rig, would often have a ""long"" exposure per frame and wouldn't, unless the team was being really cheap, be shot anywhere close to real time.  The speed that a miniature shot would be done at would be limited not only by how much torque was in the motor of the rig moving the camera but how much exposure was needed for the stop that was necessary.  Really slow-speed stocks would be necessary to help control grain."
vfx,37whn8,BurnetRhoades,2,Mon Jun 1 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think one of the only reasons the DOF is so shallow is because I had to open way up to get any decent light with the setup I was using. When I get back at it I'm going to try using a 3 chip camcorder instead of a DSLR, (hmc-150 vs gh2) should help with getting deeper DOF, but I may end up having to add more light anyway.  I wish I had a motion-control setup."

It also has camera control so that you get time lapse and whatever exposure you need before the motor nudges to the next frame (used for getting starfield timelapse with a moving camera).  Last I read they were working on a pan/tilt solution as well.  This is an area where a little electronics knowledge would go a long way.  I'm betting someone could hack together something workable starting with the brain module of one of those LEGO Mind Storms kits as an alternative to something like MS BASIC talking to stepper motors through an RS232 or USB interface.  I applaud your interest here though.  This is something I'd like to do on a future project and justify a shop investment in a simple solution.  That and something along the lines of an Oxberry to do optical printer style moves but with a DSLR feeding capture software."

Do not scale anything, only move in XYZ.  •remove roto card the frame after footage matches up to card  •render out with shallow depth of field so resolution degradation of being too close to the roto cards won't be as apparent when the camera passes close by them.    •Additional roto for people passing in front of 2d cards just comped as top layer  •As an added improvement I would have tried to shoot at a faster shutterspeed (not framerate) in order to capture the roto cards without motion blur, and then done post motion blur on the whole thing."

Once all that is done you create a Null, then paste the Mocha information onto the Null. Remember to have the playhead at the first frame before you hit Command (Or Control) V.

If that's not an option then using a photo modeling approach would be viable.  There are a variety of tools for photo modeling, even free ones.    Autodesk has an app and online service called 123D that's surprisingly pretty good and I know of at least one big budget film that made use of the service for creating digital versions of practical props and parts of locations.  You basically need to take as many photos as possible, from all around an object, the more pictures and angles the higher the resolution of the recovered point cloud and then the higher the resolution of the resulting mesh.  This will likely get you to a workable model, with textures, much faster than the old Cyberscans, which were never useful directly and only served as a ""snap-to"" cloud/surface for modeling on top of the model, and had poor textures as well.

The job description will be different from studio to studio, but usually TDs write tools, but aren't entirely developers. Most postings for TDs asked for knowledge of Python and less commonly C++, so I'd start with Python. It's very flexible and widely used.  As for training, I've been a fan of fxphd for VFX specific classes and udacity for general programming concept classes.  fxphd has Python Scripting for Compositors, Python for Pipeline, and Python for Cinema 4D  You could also head down to a library and pick up some programming text books if you want some free coursework."

Non-technical artists that actually sat on the box didn't start showing up until there were 3rd party alternatives to Wavefront TAV.    edit: Scott Ross for a number of years fought having ""Technical Director"" as an official job title at Digital Domain because it was very hard to get the credit approved because of, supposedly, blow-back from the DGA.  It already had historic value before we had those conversations but eventually he got worn down, I guess, maybe thanks to Darin Grant."

vfx,37huvo,algrensan,2,Wed May 27 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"-90 degree shutter phase at 180 degree shutter angle means that the shutter opens at -90 degrees before the frame is sampled, and closes at 90 degrees after the frame is sampled. That means that the motion blur will be equally long in front of and behind of the frame, which is physically correct. I've never seen anybody use it differently, but I guess it could be useful if you're very picky about how the motion blur reacts to your keyframes.  I figure if your shutter angle is 90 and you phase angle is -90, the motion blur will precede the frame (thus you'll only get motion blur between the previous frame and the next frame), and if the shutter phase is 0, the blur will trail the frame (and you'll only get motion blur between the current frame and the next frame).  I haven't tested it so I'm not sure if that's correct. And I don't know what it's useful for. But I guess the more knobs to tweak, the better. Maybe if you're tracking and manually to the beginning or end of each motion blur smear in each frame, instead of directly in the middle?"

The one exception is the Red One. For that camera I have to set the phase on the camera to be -45 from its default for the cg motion blur and keying to match. If I don't Change the phase to -45 the mismatch causes an odd stuttering effect. I wonder is the same thing true for post tracking keying compositing mocap?"

You have a base-level of blur outside of your plane of focus as well as chromatic aberration and noise. All of those things will help blend it all together.  There are plenty of color grading things you can do AFTER all of the before-mentioned elements which will tie it all together. As well as /u/cyphersk8 's suggestions.

vfx,37e5hj,BurnetRhoades,2,Tue May 26 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"There's various kinds of effects happening in those two gifs and they'd be handled by different folks on a traditional animation staff, guessing what you're looking at.  Perhaps you could be more specific what you're looking at in each.  The first you have the bipak glowing of the amulet and the sparkles on the chain.  Someone in the camera department would be most responsible for these, likely with an animated mask that defines the core/base of what will be possibly tinted or photographed differently,  because they involve multiple exposures with filtration to get the effect.  It's basically optical printer graphics like you'd see in old Robert Abel & Associates work from the '70s and early '80s, except they're done on the animation camera stand instead of as a separate process (most likely).  The second, are you talking about the rain itself?  There's a variety of effects from the layers of droplets flying through the air to more camera/lens effects that are layered on top, and then the sheeting action on some surfaces and the the lens flare.    The rain itself though, that's just drawings.  Traditional animation has animators that specialize in natural phenomenon and effects such as these, just like with digital effects studios."
vfx,37e5hj,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed May 27 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could be more specific what you're looking at in each.   I'm not looking for anything specific, I just want to learn how to do these kinds of effects.  You pretty much pointed out most of the effects I was looking at when I chose the gifs as examples.  I should probably mention that I would be working digitally rather than traditionally, but I figure knowing the traditional method wouldn't go amiss if I can't find any digitally oriented resources.   Okay here's an example of something specific I'd like to know how to do; there's one effect I see a lot lately in anime. It's usually really subtle and I kind of get how it might be done, but I'm not sure.   It's a subtle blanket blending of colors over the whole scene, but not enough to look like everything is bleeding together. It's just used to tie the elements of the scene together and it makes it more realistic looking. Here's a pretty good example, though maybe somewhat less subtle than I usually see it.   bipak glowing   What is bipak?   There's a variety of effects from the layers of droplets flying through the air to more camera/lens effects that are layered on top, and then the sheeting action on some surfaces and the the lens flare.   I think I'm mostly looking for lighting/compositing effects tutorials.  (I'm a newb, I haven't got the vocabulary to tell you what I'm looking at. I'll try though.), I mostly understand the concepts associated with the 'drawing/animating' aspect of the visual effects.  I've been able to find things about them on my own. (How to animate water, fire, smoke etc... that kind of thing. ) I think what I'm looking for is how they're composited.  I'm mostly a digital artist, so I have a general idea of compositing methods from Painter/Photoshop, so I'm not completely in the dark here, but it would be nice to find tutorials specifically catering to 2D animation."
vfx,37e5hj,BurnetRhoades,2,Wed May 27 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I wish there were more resources online that went into detail about the older effects techniques.  I have a few books that I've found second hand but the online info seems few and far between.  It's a shame too because now that compositing in linear space is common the old techniques are finally applicable to the digital medium.  Bipac simply means double-exposure.  Exposing the animation frame, rolling the film back, and then exposing for the bright, glowing, effects elements.    One of the other, more subtle techniques that IIRC Don Bluth helped to pioneer was doing shadows through multiple exposures with masks, under-exposing in shadowed areas.  It's a lot more common to see shadows painted into cells and done through translucent, dark overlays as additional cels.  His films made use of the technique beginning with The Secret of Nimh, I believe, and Nelvanah produced Rock & Rule in a style very close to Bluth's in terms of cinematography, layout and effects."

vfx,37aobz,Boootylicious,2,Wed May 27 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I think what you're missing is the effect that occurs when the surfaces of the car are perpendicular vs parallel to the camera.

vfx,37aobz,luxdesigns,2,Tue May 26 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to try something interesting, take all the colors you want to use and print them out on a paper board in little squares. Then go to each setting And take a quick record with the camera you shot the scene with. Or in the case of the racing footage just go out into the sun. Then use those colors as the correct selection. At this point there is too much saturation in the colors on the cars. Your first scene is better but the track shots are too technicolor bright. Once you do that, take everything into DaVinci and color grade the flat plate to unify the blacks and other colors in the completed edit."

In maya, if you wanna prj something to match a space in real life, you would have ot measure out alot of things. LIke the actual space, then how far is the camera from it, how far above the ground, what angle you are projecting at, then all the camera data. After that being set up in RL, u would built that in CG. So if you have a 4by4 feet cube, build a 4by4 in maya then prj a image onto that geo, from there render out the camera and see if the prjections match up in RL.   not sure if this helps but that is my educated guess"
vfx,37cwb7,frankshi123,1 point,Tue May 26 18:51:04 2015 UTC,"What exactly is Kerns distortion?  I don't think I've run across the term before, and a quick Google turned up mostly seemingly unrelated stuff.  Is the box tall enough that a person's head is roughly in the center?  If so, you can render like you are making a skybox/cube map in a video game.  But a camera in the center for each face, render a square with FOV = 90 degrees for each camera.  You may need to tinker with the images a bit to compensate for weirdness with the specific projection setup being used, but I can't give very specific advice about your projectors.  As long as the viewing position is near the center, you really shouldn't have to distort the imagery in the corners.  If the viewing position is near the top, it gets harder to make it work.  You'll put the cameras near where the person's head will be, but each camera will need a different setup.  Basically, you need to set up the projection such that each camera captures the full face it is pointed at.  So the one pointing to the top will need a very wide angle.  The ones pointing to the sides will need to be pointed at the center of the face, and have a projection set up to compensate for keystoning.  (Or a post process on a frame that overscans the whole face, and essentially does a corner pin to pull it out to the whole image.)"

If you want your camera to wiggle and stay focused on a POI: Create a two-node camera, wiggle your camera's Position.   As /u/cyphersk8 stated ""wiggle creates an array of data,"" basically it's just variables. The first variable f is frequency and the second variable a is amplitude.  wiggle(f,a)   This means increasing the f variable you increase the speed it wiggles and when you increase the a you increase the distance.   Wiggle applies to all properties randomly, but equal in its randomness. For instance if you apply it to a 3D position you will get different distances for X, Y, and Z position each frame but the calculation that determines it's randomness will have the same parameters.  If you want different wiggle parameters on your X, Y and Z you need null your camera's position to a 3D null, apply the Separate XYZ Position effect to your 3D null and then create separate wiggles for X, Y and Z positions.  If you want to control wiggles over time you need to create slider controls for the wiggle and null each variable in your wiggle expression to its own slider control in the effect controls window."
vfx,377q4g,andhelostthem,1 point,Mon May 25 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"Hi RollerDerby88,  It should work the exact same way as the position wiggle. Wiggle creates an array of data based on the layer property that it's applied to. So applying it to a camera POI it creates X, Y, and Z data. You need to tell AE what data to use for each property of the POI afterwards. You can't use 3 pieces of data to control only X, you will get an error ""array piece can't expand to more than one value"".   In order for AE to know what to use, you tell it what index of the result to use. Indices always start at 0 (in our case 0 represents X). So we have 0, 1, 2 as our output indices from wiggle. This is because POI property has 3 values (X, Y, Z).  I've uploaded an example code that should work here: http://imgur.com/a/Q9eZl.  Set up a null layer called Controls. Create some sliders and copy the code. It should all work. You can get even crazier if you want to have individual wiggle sliders for each value! You can have 3 wiggles, one for each, and create their own sliders if you want. There is no limit!"
vfx,374dq4,LeagueOfLeaks,1 point,Sun May 24 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"Quick glance, off the top of my head:   It looks like the rays are a particle effect in Z space originating off camera that trace the letters.  A separate text layer that is roto-ed to reveal as the rays trace the letters. There seem to be some displacement/noise/glow modifiers on the text layer.  Another particle effect layer (or two or three or four) for the rising embers and ambient smoke.  A final x plane (horizontal) particle effect that wipes between words.  All of this should be doable in After Effects, you may be able to do it natively, but the Trapcode Particular plug-in would really help."
vfx,372mo6,KeyFrameSamurai,2,Sun May 24 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"I was responsible for Prevising the Dance sequence in Laika's Boxtrolls. To preemptively apologize for the terrible animation, I based everything in this sequence off of the current story cut from editorial. Everytime the story board changed in the cut, I made a new pose. I let the software fill in the rest. Then moved on to the next shot. Speed and accuracy was the key here. Not beauty. I took the 3D scan data of the character maquettes and broke them apart and filled in the holes.  Then I set up and rigged every character. All of the sets and props were also modeled and textured by me as well.   To explain the crazy colors.... The hero characters were all color coded. The ""main"" hero characters are obvious. But the other color coded hero charcters were all intended to show hero pueppets vs CG characters.  I'd love to hear any critiques you may have on my work, and I'd be more than happy to answer any questions anyone might have."

This is really interesting to see, I didn't realize how extensively scenes were previs'd even before animation occurred.  Your reel is pretty good already. It might be a little monotonous at times because of the nature of the material. I watched some other previs reels, and some of them picture-in-picture against the final film, so that you can compare. I'm not sure if that would be informative or useful here.   Hope that helps! Thanks for sharing it."
vfx,372kdv,vgsgpz,2,Sun May 24 07:09:11 2015 UTC,"For me it was difficult to get into expressions and scripting until I learned what they could do for me.  I think the best place to start with expressions in Nuke, AE, and even Maya is to start thinking about how you can use expressions to link two attributes together.    For example say you have 5 layers/nodes that have a blur and that blur needs to be the same on all of them, you could use an expression to link all of them together so now you only need to change one value and all the others get automatically updated.  Once you know how to link attributes you can start using math to make expressions even more powerful.  For example you have attribute A and B, B should always have a blur that is about half of what A is so you get something like B.blur = A.blur*.5 (depending on the software the syntax will be completely different).  These relationships between attributes can be applied to motion, effects, whatever you need them to be.  Then you can start making Null objects to control variables in your expressions, like tying an attribute to a slider controller and linking related attributes together in a single place for faster versioning and changes.  Expressions will make you faster at many tasks, or more flexible to changes and it may be all you need for a very long time.  With expressions you are limited between linking attributes together.  If you want your software to start doing more complicated repetitive tasks like setting up a series of nodes you are going to have to learn some scripting.  Scripting is very powerful but it can also be more time intensive, I have found that any time that I spend learning about scripting is a valuable investment to make me faster and more flexible later."
vfx,372kdv,ScreamingPenguin,2,Sun May 24 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"Ok... so here's the deal. I can barely write expressions..  Like, just the most simple.  There are some times where I need it but in nuke the ones  you can't live without, which is really just linking, you can do without writing code.  Also, quite a bit of expressions are just simple math.  If you are asking if they are important, I can say with a fair amount of certainty that you have way more to learn Before you need to worry about expressions.    Also, there are a ton of tech-y people in the field who would freak out if they heard me giving this advice.  Be careful of listening to the super tech-y people. When all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail.  That goes both ways, from the super code heavy compers to the arty fartsy ones who don't know how to open a shell."
vfx,372kdv,petersid7,1 point,Mon May 25 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"Tech-y Person Here, can confirm, petersid7 looks like a nail.  But he is right, expressions are awesome and useful some people live by them (me) other do the same job without them. Two things about expressions:   very good for procedural workflow can be a nightmare to troubleshoot and art direct."
vfx,372kdv,paxsonsa,2,Tue May 26 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"Hi. I wrote an expressions eBook for After Effects that's free on Ideas to Creations, as well as a bunch of tutorials on using them. They're pretty easy to get into, but you'll need to find a use for them and use every now and then, otherwise you'll just forget anything you learn. If you're gonna learn coding for vfx, Id suggest Python. Its used in Nuke and Cinema4D and pretty sure Maya does as well. AE scripts and expressions use a modified JavaScript, which can use standard commands along with AE specific uses. You can learn the useful basics like wiggle, time calculations and looping keyframes. Anything beyond that is for the learnings  Edit: misclick"
vfx,372kdv,davdalx,2,Tue May 26 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, most newer software is relying on Python for their scripting interface.  Besides VFX it's a useful skill to have in general as it's so versatile.    Several other scripting languages have jockeyed for dominance in the industry over the years, including TCL and Perl, but Python has emerged as the winner.  In addition to the packages you listed, Python is also integrated into Houdini (along with their native HScript and Vex), Blender and, IIRC, Natron (open source Nuke-like compositor).  If/when Adobe decides to finally re-write After Effects they should think long and hard about, if not replacing their current scripting support with Python, at least adding Python as an alternative."
vfx,372kdv,BurnetRhoades,2,Wed May 27 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"They are quite important to learn for nuke and even more for 3d. You can probably not know about them and still work but sooner than later you will need to know how they work. In nuke the expressions / TCL language is relatively simple and has little range of use compared to Python. Cannot say for 3D as it depends on the package, but coding languages in general are sprinkled over almost every vfx software out here for a reason."
vfx,372kdv,TurtleOnCinderblock,1 point,Sun May 24 07:34:18 2015 UTC,but does every application have its own language? wouldnt it be better to have one language to learn for all?
vfx,372kdv,losangelesvideoguy,3,Sun May 24 08:52:15 2015 UTC,"Well, Python has become fairly standardized (much to my chagrin, as I don't care for Python). But really, you don't have to learn that much of any given language. Just some basic expression syntax. Usually the problem you want to save is fairly well defined and narrow in scope, so knowing how to solve it generally is 90% of the battle. The rest is just reading the documentation or Googling until you find the right incantation to do what it is you want.  If you're already a programmer, you'll be fine. If you're not, learn to program! It's a tremendously useful skill, especially in the VFX world, and it will equip you to solve problems in ways you never would have otherwise thought of. If you have a solid grounding in pretty much any modern programming language, using expressions in VFX software will be a relatively simple matter."
vfx,372kdv,ZombieAcademy,1 point,Sun May 24 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"TCL is a little strange, but every other expression language I've used has been pretty similar. Sort of a javascripty, C-like thing. It's not hard to pick one up if you've written expressions before.  It's about learning the mind set. Then learning, ""ok I need 'time', how do I access a variable for that? Now I want 'noise', what do they call that?"" or whatever, is just a matter of reading some doc."

vfx,36vwxk,usfgeek,8,Fri May 22 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"You're trying to do it all. Modeling, texturing, dynamics, animation, compositing.   I'm a compositor and VFX supervisor as well as owner of a VFX house.   What I see is that you got a little further than I did back in the late 90's with Electric Image. I think, in part, its because the tools are better. You are certainly at a point where you NEED outside help. Whether it's tutorials or working at a facility. You also need to specialize and get good at one thing. You don't seem to have the eye for compositing, or lack the experience to get where you need to go with the 3D. The 3D would be somewhat serviceable to a very experience comper, but it kind of falls flat on the reel because you just don't have that skillset on top of all the others.   My advice. Find the thing you like doing most out of the reel that you've done. Not what you think looks good... but what was the part you ENJOYED doing. THIS is the thing you need to pursue.   If you like Modeling. Model the shit out of things, then make turntables. Boom. A reel.   If you love surfacing. Grab models and surface the crap out of them until they are real. Layers of grunge and detail. displacement, bump, spec. Get really good at that. Make turntables of simple lighting setups to explore the detail. Boom. Reel.   If you love dynamics. Let the dynamics people handle this. There's quite a few of them out there. Stick to other stuff.   The same goes for animation, compositing, dynamics (if you must). Stop trying to be a generalist. Your reel is evenly flat, you come across as if you have advanced to the same level across multiple disciplines... you need to pick one and excel at it to get picked up by one of the UK companies.   I don't even have the yarbels to link to a super old reel of mine. Suffice to say, when I tried to do it all, I couldn't get ahead. When I focused on compositing, I found a niche and got really good at it. I chose to be fast and good, and it served me well for the better part of 2 decades. I believe you've done a great job getting where you are. Now you need to spend the next year focusing. Getting really good in a specific thing. Blow them away, and then you will get the job you are looking for.   TL;DR Pick the thing you liked doing the most out of this reel and focus on doing JUST that. Stop trying to do it ALL. Companies can see talent and dedication with stills and turntables. You don't need to do all the other stuff.   Good luck."
vfx,36vwxk,splinechaser,2,Fri May 22 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, I agree completely with you on everything you said. I think I'm at a point now where I have a grasp of all the basics and now I need to focus. I think modelling is the way I'm going to go, hard surface specifically. I have a few models I can go into a re-work to a much higher standard, so that's going to be my aim from now on.  Thanks again!"
vfx,36vwxk,beenyweenies,2,Fri May 22 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is great advice, but is perhaps more applicable if you want to be involved in VFX, where specialization is prized. It would seem that just about all other work being done below the level of feature film VFX is moving more towards generalists.  I think where the reel goes wrong is that most of the subject matter is feature film, but using a generalist mindset and approach. If your entire reel was more like the first item, with a broadcast commercial focus, your skill set and generalist approach would work great.  You have to ask yourself what your goals are and why."
vfx,36vwxk,Wtkeith,3,Fri May 22 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"I hate to add an opposing point of view to splinechaser because I do think it is somewhat descent advice.  However I am a generalist and have been working on the commercial side of things for the past 10 years.  The only thing I don't do is complex character modeling and rigging.  I think if you want to work for a small studio like I do or an ad agency it helps to be a generalist.  But if you want to work for a larger studio like framestore as you mentioned, specialization is where you want to be.  I like doing everything, I do a lot of solo freelance jobs as well, which I don't think I would be able to do if I wasn't a generalist.  You can watch my reel at tkriot.com/work/  if you want to see the reel of a generalist who has been at it for a while.  You should just know, that there is a market for both generalists and specialists."
vfx,36vwxk,VFXLegion,3,Fri May 22 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"Commercials is the one place where being a talented generalist really helps. I would imagine though that you are still heavier in one area over another. What Spline is saying is that usf needs to focus to get into his/her specific choice of industries. I know several 3D generalists, and I really appreciate their skills, but modeling, surfacing, animating, rigging, rendering, and comp are a lot for any one person.   Again, most generalists are weak in certain areas. usfgeek is putting too many weaknesses on display because they are trying to do it all. I agree with his reply to spline. He's at a better point across the board, but now perhaps it's time to double down on something and then circle back and pick up the other things once they are established."
vfx,36vwxk,89bottles,3,Fri May 22 21:12:01 2015 UTC,Skilled generalists are hot property at many of the large studios. Previs departments and companies especially. Some places even have generalist departments now.

But it is my opinion that this is absolutely the WORST reason to head in the direction you are going, because 5 years in you won't give a flying shit about the credit on screen. To be blunt, you are trading job security, countless nights and weekends and, in most cases, substantial salary over your lifetime, so that you can see your name on a screen. There are so many other industries and needs for the kind of work you do (and your reel is GREAT for most of those things) that don't require these trade-offs.  I'm not trying to be negative or scare you, it's just the reality. A lot of people are attracted to getting the film credit, but the sacrifice is pretty steep."

vfx,36vwxk,the-real-klockworks,1 point,Mon May 25 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"I think both Splinechaser and Wtkeith has great points. I went to school for this kinda of work and I noticed the change in the industry, mainly in LA and motion studios, is that people are starting to want more of a generalist type of artist. I started as mainly a look dev artist, then i started to work more for composting and 2d animation, but my main source of employment is what I went to school for, lighting, shading and rendering. So I came out with a specialty skill then went and diversified my self as i knew more and more people.   I don't wanna discourage your dreams of becoming a artist at one of those studios, but I personally think you are aiming for the KING OF THE CROP right out of the gate. In a way, you need to pay your dues. I paid mine by going to internships after internship and I wasn't picky about it. My goal was to learn and network. I took two internships at Motion Graphic and Design house, no 3d or VFX house at all because they won't accept me. So instead of trying to tunnel vision myself. I went and looked for alternatives. Now, I love being in the motion industry cuz everything is fast pace, changing all the time, and very challenging and creative.  So that being said, I suggest you maybe not tunnel vision yourself on the best of the industry yet. have you considered moving to LA or Canada or even China. I've thinking about moving to china because the industry there is going to start booming and I am chinese. Maybe apply for a internship here in LA with the Mill, framestore LA, psyop, Method Studios, Prologue. THere are so many GREAT studios that would look at your reel and see the potential you u have to be greater.  So In short, don't tunnel vision those studios, I remember getting rejected by DNEG at Siggraph 2 years ago. We went for a interview and before we even got to talk, they told us to leave and come back 4 years later. We were too young.. like what da fuck. I never wanna go to a company that simply rejects talent on AGE."
vfx,36vwxk,frankshi123,5,Fri May 22 17:49:45 2015 UTC,The advice of moving to LA is bad. There aren't really jobs in large studios any more here(they are all going to Vancouver).  As to the age comment it is because of Visas they outright deny you. Getting a UK work permit as an American takes a substantial amount of proof on their part that not only are you worth it but that they can't find anyone else local with the same talents.
vfx,36vwxk,FinalOmit,0,Fri May 22 21:09:55 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing what I am saying or I might of not been clear. I was just telling him to tunnel vision only into VFX. La has great motion graphics and design indsutry, VFX has been out of LA for years now. I work in the motion graphics field and artist like him is must needed for compositing work.   As for the DNEG thing, I wish they would told me that instead of just telling me to leave. How do you feel if your a new up and coming artist going to a interviwe with the best in the indsutry and they tell you to fuck off cuz your too young. Why would a british company come to america and put a booth in the most well know convention in our industry if they can hire from london? Either they dont have artist or they are just doing it to save face."
vfx,36vwxk,frankshi123,2,Fri May 22 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"I am speaking to his wish to get INTO VFX for movies. LA doesn't have those jobs. About the only thing LA has and will continue to have is commercial/motion jobs because they are not part of the subsidy drain.   As for the DNEG thing, I wish they would told me that instead of just telling me to leave. How do you feel if your a new up and coming artist going to a interviwe with the best in the indsutry and they tell you to fuck off cuz your too young. Why would a british company come to america and put a booth in the most well know convention in our industry if they can hire from london? Either they dont have artist or they are just doing it to save face.   I got the same spiel from them you did. Multiple times. I finally asked one of the recruiters and they told me. London companies don't come to the states for juniors. They come for mid-level people. They want people with a fair amount of experience to get new ideas into a department and not get set in their ways of thinking. DNeg is a great company with awesome people and some nice recruiters, don't bad mouth people because you don't know the legality of the situation they have to deal with every day.   Any Siggraph event all the recruiters(including small companies) are there for around 8 hours talking to thousands of people. For the entire length of the event. Cut them some slack for being short with you."
vfx,36vwxk,FinalOmit,0,Fri May 22 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Right. But he is saying that for four years. He has no luck. I am merely suggesting him to try another path just get into the industry work. Hands on experience is always better than non i think. So why try forcing yourself down a path there is many other options. He can stil lcome back and to VFX. I wanted to do VFX for film after college, but now i am in the motion industry. I dont want to anymore. I mere suggesting that there is more than one field that he can benefit front.   And I am in no way bad mouthing. I am telling him what i experience. The recruiter did not even give me a chance to present my work. If you come to siggraph, you have to know students go there to try to apply for jobs.  You have to know that. So why do you not pay attention to those students and just pick the artist you like. Students are the future to this industry and I would like to be just treated as a person. I get that they spent hours talking to thousands of people, just to toss their names into bowl of names. I went to interview at every company that went to siggraph. Only 2 gave me the time to explain my self and tell me that they are not looking for JR artist. Everyone just told me to go away. That is not the way you treat a person period, espcially to artist who are up and coming."
vfx,36vwxk,frankshi123,1 point,Fri May 22 22:57:16 2015 UTC,why would they pay to relocate a junior.mid level artist? (sorry thats an assumption)
vfx,36vwxk,FinalOmit,0,Mon May 25 20:32:03 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. If the company has the space for growth and all the stars line up, it is usually to help train someone into a more permanent spot for the company. There are alot of houses in here in LA that does VFX for TV's, Movies, UI, and MV that requires ALOT OF compers. I have friends that apply to these houses after school, due to their visa problem, they need to find a sponsorship. Alot of these smaller houses provide that because it might be economically better for them as a company than compared to do free lancer JR/MID that would charge alot more for the time there. The investment for the company is worth it because they get a stable worker, who is good at a lower cost for X amount of years due to visa sponsor. That is just what I seen my friends who have visa problems do. They also simply hire people from other country just purely out of talent along. I think LA is more open to the idea of bringing new artist from other countries."
vfx,36vwxk,frankshi123,1 point,Mon May 25 23:07:38 2015 UTC,I was talking about a uk company hiring junior/mids from the US. No point as there are plenty of people in the UK or europe who would be as good and cheaper to set up.

I haven't looked into working overseas, no. My reasoning for this if I'm not good enough for the studios here, I don't see myself being good enough over there either, because i'm sure it would be at a cost to bring me over for that.  Really? That doesn't sound too fair, how did you find siggraph in general?

vfx,36xuk3,FeelsforOsamu,2,Sun May 24 07:21:28 2015 UTC,"It's extremely unusual, but certainly not completely unheard of.  I have seen Flame Ops who come with their own Flame available to rent, but it's never assumed, and the rental is always handled as a separate fee.  (Payroll and rentals usually have different tax rules!)  I have also seen Houdini freelancers who get hired along with a license for the app.  And obviously if you hire someone remote to bang something out from home you would assume they'll have their own equipment.  But at that point, you are essentially hiring a vendor rather than an artist.  Any film site that deals with MPAA security would typically be very shy about the idea of putting a ""foreign"" workstation on their network, even if that workstation is assigned to a job with less security requirements.  Losing a multimillion dollar film job from a security breach is generally not worth saving the cost of a few thousand dollar workstation."
vfx,36xuk3,wrosecrans,8,Sun May 24 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"There are all kinds of red flags in this ad. They want an expert AE artist, but you have to know ""VFX"" software like nuke or mocha... This shows a giant lack of understanding of the program stack and the versatility and role of a lot of different programs.  Proficiency in Adobe creative cloud, the whole program stack? Am I going to be using audition to do your sound editing, am I editing your project in premiere, or maybe making your website in dreamweaver?   Also you have to have your own workstation, that's a big one. That is the most telling of all. It has all sorts of issues that it carries with it, what do they mean by workstation? are they referring to just the hardware, or are they talking about the entire program stack as well? this just screams to me that they don't want to take on the rolled in cost of the program licensing.   Must be able to work well on you own and prioritize tasks.  Able to work independently and as part of a team on multiple overlapping projects  Detail oriented, a self-starter and a strong team player   These three bother me the most though.

Initially, it was a hard transition; had to do a lot of unlearning first but it was worth the effort. I do a lot of product modelling in modo and only switch back to SW to add manufacturing details like rivets or bosses. I also started doing explanatory product animations. Love dynamics for making my soft goods look flashy. Most of the updates in the live session were over my head but a lot of the modelling improvements are great.

I've talked to a few ex-employees and from a development / integration point-of-view, they're happy to be back in Maya given how badly documented/designed the modo SDK is...  Several companies' DMP departments (DNeg, MPC) use modo a bit, but seeing as most DMP departments are out-of-pipeline and ""do what you want"", that doesn't really mean much, and it's certainly not a core/common tool there. Similarly there are a few people at ILM/Pixar who use it for modelling, but again, they tend to work in isolation from the pipeline, with an import/export process to Maya."

vfx,36nwhq,george_kaplan1959,2,Wed May 20 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"God me too. Photoshop & Illustrator have parts which haven't been touched in many many many years. Look at Filters-Distort-Wave. Weird custom controls (look at those radio buttons!) with a preview size of about 60x30 pixels. It's so bizzare.  Some filters preview in a tiny box. Some preview in a larger box that you can zoom in and out of. Some preview both the document and in the little window. Some have scroll bars, some don't. Some have native UI elements, others have custom ones.  Even things like a the polygon lasso, if you double click by mistake (happens all the time when using a pen) you close the path. CTRL-Z deletes the selection. Thanks Adobe.  See also http://adobegripes.tumblr.com"
vfx,36nwhq,burgernz,3,Thu May 21 10:21:19 2015 UTC,"Just as a counter point look what they did to Speedgrade after they acquired that.  It went from having some good tech, a clunky interface, and bad performance on the mac.  Now Speedgrade is a pretty great color correcting environment with a really nice dynamic link to Premiere and Media Encoder.  Photoshop and Illustrator have so many legacy issues holding them back from really excelling.  So many of the filters are 8-bit only, and rewriting them or changing the interface or plugins will either brake existing PSD and AI compatibility or anger a rather large user base that doesn't necessarily want a lot of change at one time.  I am glad that Adobe did not acquire The Foundry, I just don't think it's a good fit for what Adobe is trying to do.  I would love it if Adobe apps worked more like Foundry apps geared toward high-end specialized artists working in teams with really good scripting integration.  I would also really like it if Nuke wasn't so expensive.  But I am afraid that the acquisition would be more likely to water down Nuke to fit into (what I consider to be) Adobe's far inferior compositor."
vfx,36nwhq,ScreamingPenguin,2,Thu May 21 23:48:38 2015 UTC,"I would describe Adobe's approach to their software as inconsistent. They need to really overhaul a lot of their software. They have lost a lot of focus, just look at their list of products... Other companies are starting to come along and eat their lunch already. There is a long way to go but the software industry is finnicky, you could have users migrate very quickly to a competing product."
vfx,36nwhq,burgernz,2,Fri May 22 08:24:53 2015 UTC,"I believe in the last few years Adobe has gained focus on their products and what their priorities should be.  They are no longer focusing on big features to try and sell the next version of Photoshop or Illustrator, they are focusing on making the software more optimized and refining tools that are already there.  Dynamic Link is the CC's biggest strength in my opinion and they are really making it better.    Speedgrade is a perfect example of the new way of thinking that Adobe is going, the Premiere/Speedgrade link is pretty good now and in the next version of CC they are taking many of the Speedgrade tools and putting them right there in Premiere for faster but limited color grading. I really enjoy editing in Avid, but it has maybe a 10th of the power and flexibility that Premiere has once you pair it up with all the other CC apps.  I think Blackmagic have their sights set on Adobe in the video realm and I think that is great.  They are trying to turn Resolve into a powerful editing and finishing station with a dynamic link to Fusion for all your compositing and motion graphics.  I don't really see the big Photoshop or Illustrator killer yet, but I can't wait for it to come up so that I can switch to it, or it forces Adobe to fix what they have and make it better to compete."
vfx,36nwhq,ScreamingPenguin,-5,Fri May 22 14:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not, Adobe is really lacking a true 3d compositor. As a single user the Adobe subscription price model fits my budget."
vfx,36nwhq,ilikefarting,2,Thu May 21 00:12:32 2015 UTC,But Adobe would probably change the structure of Nuke entirely.
vfx,36nwhq,TributetoVera,-2,Thu May 21 04:10:14 2015 UTC,Except Adobe makes total shit software and The Foundry does the opposite.  They wouldn't be thriving if it wasn't for companies like aobe fucking up version after version  of software that worked just fine.
vfx,36nwhq,__Cyber_Dildonics__,4,Thu May 21 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"I get that Adobe buying Nuke would be bad for the Linux platform, but what's the reasoning behind the Adobe hate? Which software do they make that is crap? (Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, Premiere, InDesign, Illustrator don't seem they deserve much hate)"
vfx,36nwhq,openg123,-4,Thu May 21 04:18:35 2015 UTC,"Photoshop is bloated and hasn't added much new in a long time.  Premier is the worst.  Its been super buggy for two decades now!  It used to crash constantly and now years and years later, it still crashes constantly. After Effects I personally think is awful, but a lot of people like it so there is an argument to be made that isn't as bad.  The rest I haven't used, but my experience is that adobe software tends to keep getting worse for everything useful they ad.  Kind of like using all the terrible version s of windows."
vfx,36nwhq,__Cyber_Dildonics__,2,Thu May 21 04:26:02 2015 UTC,You're totally off-base on Premiere.    We're not happy at all with The Foundry's version of Nuke for the Mac platform.  Hopefully now that the sale is out of the way they'll put some of the effort they've been concentrating on pumping up revenue back into development and bug fixes.
vfx,36nwhq,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Thu May 21 06:36:32 2015 UTC,What kind of issues have you had with the mac platform? We've been using it in house on macs for 4 years now and not had any major mac only issues.
vfx,36nwhq,emucheese,1 point,Thu May 21 08:23:55 2015 UTC,"The Mac version has a problem where it will sometimes write corrupt, short project files when writing to Samba shares.  This has been an issue for at least three major versions now.  We've confirmed it writing from Nuke-X on one Mac and Nuke Assist on another.  Certain resolution + codec combinations our Nuke driver has to defer to someone else or do as an additional step from After Effects because the Quicktime interface doesn't offer full functionality.  In fact, Quicktime IO is not trusted to be as reliable as frame-based IO.  As this has been a problem for quite a while we're likely swapping our main Nuke driver over to a Windows box so that he doesn't have to deal with the corruption issues anymore, though we'll still have to be mindful of it for other folks running Nuke Assist on occasion.  And then he'll likely defer most QT tasks to other artists or the editor from that point on."
vfx,36nwhq,BurnetRhoades,3,Thu May 21 13:46:58 2015 UTC,"So, I'm doing post FX on a feature film right now. I'm using CC 2014 and it's incredible.  The editor gave me a Mac drive and I threw it on a Windows 8 machine and was sending compositions to After Effects immediately. I expected a headache on a project of this scale, but there's none.  It seems to me like Adobe has trouble for awhile with software they acquire. Speedgrade is a great example. It's basically unusable. I mean, I've figured it out, but the menus are obtuse and like no other software Adobe or otherwise and it's buggy as hell. I expect that to continually get better.  Premiere used to be a piece of shit, but they picked up the slack after Apple decided to destroy Final Cut.   I'm neutral on Nuke, but I think it would gave been nice if some Foundry got bundled into Adobe stuff. Competition is good though."
vfx,36nwhq,formerfatboys,0,Thu May 21 08:46:18 2015 UTC,"Again, I know many people like after effects so even though I dont like it, I know that it works well for lots of people.   Also if something is easy enough to send back to an editor then it could be done in nuke just as quickly but at the same time nuke probably isn't necessary.  Nuke scales to the really complicated stuff it doesn't really overlap with after effects.    Adobe can add features just like any other software company but 'getting it right' like nuke is not their forte.  Nuke has a very intelligent architecture underneath as well as a very responsive UI.  Then the foundry took it and made many really solid new nodes on top of that."
vfx,36nwhq,__Cyber_Dildonics__,-3,Thu May 21 11:15:41 2015 UTC,"It's highly unlikely that Adobe would've done that though. That's not how the free market works.  Also. Adobe is a shit company who makes shit products for people who doesn't know better.  You might think that they make good software, but then you try Nuke, and you quickly realise that Adobes way of doing UI and workflow is TERRIBLE"
vfx,36nwhq,ponnyconny,0,Thu May 21 08:54:26 2015 UTC,"I was hoping Adobe would buy them and roll their products into Creative Cloud to make The Foundry's products more affordable. Nuke is amazing, but $7,920 for a NukeX license is way outside what a small vfx shop can afford.  I'm really hoping that Fusion's new low price will put pressure on The Foundry to drop their prices or come up with a more affordable rental / subscription model.  Currently, renting a NukeX license costs $781 per month with a 3 month minimum.  Compare that to Creative Cloud which is $49 per month."
vfx,36nwhq,DoctorOctagone,5,Wed May 20 22:54:08 2015 UTC,A small VFX shop should charging more than $500 a DAY for Nuke work. It's affordable.
vfx,36nwhq,burgernz,1 point,Thu May 21 10:13:07 2015 UTC,"In addition to that I believe that a new NukeX license is $7,920 but a maintenance contract is $1,500 a year making your nth year of a Nuke license $125 a month. I don't handle purchasing but I believe that is how it was explained to me.  It is a large up front investment but a pretty reasonable yearly cost after that, even for part-time freelancers."
vfx,36nwhq,ScreamingPenguin,1 point,Fri May 22 00:09:50 2015 UTC,"This sounds like good news. When the Foundry went up for sale I was worried they'd lose their personality and customer focus, which is some of the best in the industry. I'm glad to hear that should stay intact."

I don't know what the market is like right now exactly, but keep in mind that is my estimation of maximum, not where to set your expectations.  I don't know if different departments pay juniors differently, but tracking and roto should differ from effects.  For VFX, the departments that work on shots are much easier to get jobs in because there are more people.  The departments that are less straight forward and have a higher skill cap are even more likely to need people. Animation, lighting, effects, compositing.  This is where the jobs are. I don't know how it breaks down for games and animated features.  There are more assets but simple asset creation can be done in India or China the easiest."

vfx,36n15k,eighty6in_kittins,2,Tue May 26 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, seniors in those positions should be able to live a comfortable lifestyle.  You can look at H1-B visa information for the US and see how much those titles in certain companies have attached to their visa filings.  With that and a little more googling you might be able to find more salary information.  The spread gets wider as experience increases, you have to negotiate for more money, it won't be handed to you. Negotiation is a matter of leverage and information.

So this isn't really hard to do if it shot right, but since you aren't a sup or artist you'll most likely shoot it wrong.... no offense.    Additionally, Whats not hard for a good compositor is probably pretty hard for someone who's new or very Jr.  Expect to pay someone quite a bit of money to pull this off.  Lastly... handheld is not your friend on this one.  Here's why.  When combining 2 plates that are moving separately, the process is to stabalize one plate, and track it to the other.  This works fine except for 2 things...    Motion blur cannot be removed in post.  So, even though your shots are moving together, the motion blur will be going in different directions..  Also, where ever your shots don't perfectly line up, you'll loose the actors body at the bottom of the frame (and anywhere else the break frame).  This is an issue because you have black lines all over your shots that need to be fixed.  Its possible to do in Comp... but a huge pain in the ass.    The best way to avoid this is to shoot overscan.  If you want to post at 2k, shoot 4k with a box guide on your monitor so that you can push in.  It will save you a ton of headache.  Hope this helps."

If its an actor in a room, then you can cheat it, but your thinking is in the right place there.    Not sure what would be best for shooting...  I just put 4k as a guideline.  Really your best bet is to shoot a couple tests, even with a 5d and basic lighting.  See how hard it will be and what you get getting out of it... As with most VFX, creative editing is usually a better choice the trying to force it.    FWIW, I did this about 10 years ago.  It was a combo of split screen and head replacements on body doubles.  All of it is lockoff, but the movement is created with the edits.  The body double stuff works great for any times that you don't see both faces and they are touching.. like the closeup of Keanan's Female version."

Besides the usual difference in noise that you see between color records the lens gives the impression that one channel is effectively larger than the other two, while also being softer.   Regardless of this, as a technique it's one of the most effective means of giving a cg render the visual cue of something physical that's been photographed through a lens.  It's got a long way to go before it's ""over used"" compared to fake anamorphic streaks.  What's ironic is modern glass like you get from Leica is so devoid of chromab, flare and distortion, it renders reality so flat, in depth and color, that it makes photographic reality look synthetic and without any trace of a medium between the viewer's eye and this digital facsimile, this semi-reality we now see at the theater and on television."

vfx,36codv,BlinkingZeroes,3,Mon May 18 10:11:22 2015 UTC,Boujou/PFTrack/3D Equalizer/Syntheyes will all be superior to the Nuke/AE 3D trackers. Nuke/AE's trackers are predominantly camera trackers whereas the others will have features such as object tracking - which is how the heads/faces are being tracked in the reel you posted.

You could try using lots of reference photos and using 123d to generate from photos (http://www.123dapp.com/catch) . Other ways would be tracking markers on face, points tracked and turned into a mesh. Using a kinect to capture a depth scan.   In the past, I had used a generic face model and sculpted it into shape using photos to match it to. It's one of those things where there isn't really a super simple solution."
vfx,36codv,BlinkingZeroes,1 point,Mon May 18 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"fter effects doesn't do any form of 3D object tracking. Just camera solving and 2D point tracking. ie. you can't track something in AE and take that tracking data into a 3D program and use position (including z position) and rotation values in conjunction with a solved camera and apply that data to a 3D object thus replacing the tracked object. You need syntheyes, pftrack or boujou to do that. I'm not sure if nuke can do native 3D object tracking, if it    Getting a simple scan from a Kinect sensor plugged into a pc is very easy. however, it would then need to be rebuilt with efficient topology to be useful. Might be worth just using reference photos of front, side and 3/4 and build a basic face with the right proportions with poly modelling."

But when it comes to tracking i think its really important to be precise, look through the shot multiple times over and over again.   Roto is the worst, but its where you have to start to get in to the VFX industry. Its the same story as tracking, be really precise and study the shot over and over again. Another tip is to use as few keyframes as possible and try to use tracker data if its possible. It also helps alot to split the roto up in smaller pieces.

vfx,368j7w,Yehbe,1 point,Sun May 17 08:16:07 2015 UTC,"The method described in this gizmo is pretty cool. Using it you are able to sample the impulse response of the lens used to shoot your live action cg and apply the same convolution behavior to the cg. http://www.nukepedia.com/gizmos/filter/lenskernelfft_v01 (alt version here http://www.davidvfx.com/gizmos.html)  Another more hacky trick that I use sometimes is to use the soften node, in order to take the sharp cg edge off of the renders, without blurring the cg.  Of course one would always need to very precisely dial the defocus amount of the cg to match with the plate, along with grain matching and all of the other fundamental compositing skills."
vfx,368j7w,jedypod,1 point,Sun May 17 09:00:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on the quality of the CG you're getting as well as the quality of the footage. In production it could vary wildly...sometimes you get half-res CG for the plate you're working on, sometimes the samples aren't high enough and the moblur in the CG is grainy, there's no fixed rule really.   If you're in a film pipeline they probably have a setup you can base your comp off, in commercials it's usually more of a 'do whatever it takes to make it look good' vibe.  A project I worked on recently we got some very last minute CG smoke that was very low res and didn't really work. I ended up blending in smoke stock elements and painting on top of the smoke frame by frame (it was moving erratically so frame by frame painting worked). Turned out looking ok in the end. All really depends on time/budget. Generally if the CG is good you don't really want to affect the moblur too much if it's baked in, or you need to protect the moblur detail as much as possible if it looks good."

Timing is tight, space is used well. I don't really like the circles becoming oblong, especially with them pointing at what seems to be a random angle. And you have three of them pile up on top of each other with what appears to be no effect - maybe they should pool and the circle they end up in could get bigger or something before they move to the next motion.   There are small shifts in those circles' position, which don't seem all that justified - if they're going to move, it should be a bigger move, I feel.   The logo itself, maybe you didn't do that, but I feel like it could use some work. I get that it's supposed to be a 9 and that it's supposed to be a stethoscope, but the earbuds part of the stethoscope looks too much like a ""c"" (albeit backwards), and when I see the logo I am reading it as ""9c""."

Some good examples are shots with flowing hair or dancers. Heck, if you get a shot with a lot of people, try and separate out multiple characters. Show the shot, then wipe to the alphas that are colored to show everything split up or isolated over a 50% gray. If you can get shots with moving cameras, that's also good too. It doesn't even have to be people, it can be windows, trees, cars... it also shows that you have good tracking skills.  While you're at it, find things to paint, since roto and paint go hand in hand. Wire removal can be electrical wires. Paint a character out of the bg with a tracked clean plate. Track in a new sign into a shot.  Good luck!"

vfx,35xzdw,porkbellybourbon,1 point,Thu May 14 13:44:44 2015 UTC,"As mentioned... storage is one.  Also, speed can take a hit.  Particularly if the nuke artist isn't paying attention to their layers.  The artist would need to manually remove exr layers to not have nuke processing them all."

There are so many things that can be fixed in post with render passes and the render then will be a fraction compared to having to re-render the whole thing in 3d. I always do passes just because of that, then many times because it will needed for some weird effect on post."
vfx,35xzdw,kikesaltos,1 point,Thu May 14 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"It should only add a few seconds per frame of render time for your renderer to generate a proper multilayer EXR, versus a flat RGBA EXR. Aside from disk storage considerations, it WILL take your compositing application more time to process each frame of an animation that is a composite of 5-10 layers of 16/32 bit EXR data. There's no getting around that. Final output of those composites will also take longer.  If you're not sure of the benefits of this workflow, chances are you WON'T benefit enough to warrant switching just yet. I would do some tests and make sure it's manageable given your personal workflow, deadlines etc."
vfx,35xzdw,beenyweenies,1 point,Thu May 14 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"Depending on how many AOV's you have, it can add 10-15% to your render time, of course that's scene dependant, but definitely more than a few seconds. Disk storage can be mitigated somewhat by only using bit depth required for your passes, but it's still going to hurt."
vfx,35xzdw,DerekVonSnitzel,2,Fri May 15 09:57:34 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the AOV's are calculated.  Spitting out spec and diffuse from a shader that already has to compute those values is cheaper than a full render pass that re-renders the whole scene with a shader override.  It also depends on what storage you are rendering to.  A local SSD will take a pretty minimal time hit to store the extra data.  A studio that uses a global farm with remote nodes in another facility rendering to NFS storage many miles away will take a little longer to deal with the extra data.  But even in the worst case, if you can save having to re-render once with a tweak, it comes out as a large net win on speed."
vfx,35xzdw,wrosecrans,1 point,Fri May 15 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"It's about managing consistency. For live action, Multi pass rendering is usually indicative of workflows that don't have the time or resources to fully calibrate scene lighting and geometry from image capture all the way through camera tracking, scene survey, light probe, terrain modeling, shading, texturing, lighting, rendering, etc all the way to comp. If you can calibrate all of that accurately, you can consistently get single pass renders that match plate photography very well out of the box. If you don't have the time or resources to do all that, multi pass is a good way to be able to dial things in at the comp stage where it is relatively quick to make adjustments. The down side is you then need to manually manage look consistency at the comp stage, which depending on the size of the comp team may or may not be an issue. On a big show, having 50 compositors all dialing in spec differently on a creature in every shot is not something you want. On a small project where it's more about speed and flexibility, maybe multi pass is the way to go."
vfx,35wjte,matthewmccleskey,2,Thu May 14 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'd put several tracking markers on the ground and then go and place in an image of a canyon. You should be able to find plenty of canyon ledge shot on the internet since that's the view that the majority of people see. Place that image in your scene after 3d tracking your markers. Rotoscope out the person so that he stands in front of the canyon.  Try to have the photo's shadow directions match your own actor's. Also, I'd give him some sort of rock or something to jump off of in real life so that it's more interactive...  I'd get a second and third opinion if I were you. This is gonna be a tricky shot.

vfx,35wjte,voxeldata,0,Thu May 14 03:09:54 2015 UTC,Simplest to make it a still shot and consult a compositor and build out the camera shot as he suggests below.  If you want the shot to move the best way to make it look good is track the shot and use a 3D modeled canyon.
vfx,35ubys,ciapiki,6,Wed May 13 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"Hey! great start but there are a few more things that might help bed it a bit more in reality.  What's motivating the lens flare? Does the flash carry a 1200 watt tungsten light? Unless the shot is dark (which is isn't) the lens flare simply wouldn't happen unless the flash is self illuminating.   If that's your desired effect (which is overdone these days and looks fake) the light source should cast traveling shadows across the frame of the last shot.  Also, I would suggest putting in a few motion blurred frames of The Flash. If you stop the video mid frame running past the camera, there simply isn't anything there."

The flash starts from frame 1, runs offscreen then the camera turns waits a little bit and then the flash goes by.  The pacing is off and makes the flash seem slow.  I think it would be much better if the flash on the ground disappeares behind the building ledge and then appears very quickly after the camera turns around.  You also need to add some motion blur to your fake camera shake at the end."

It's usually not a big deal, as everyone else stated, I haven't heard of anyone getting bounced coming to Canada from the US.  I have heard TN visas getting denied for Canadians coming to the US the opposite direction, but that's usually due for students with not enough work experience in the officers mind, or a paperwork foul up.  The larger vfx studios should have decent immigration folks who will have the paperwork done to specifications.  The only time you really need to worry about it is if the studio is very small and they expect you to do the immigration paperwork on your own.  Personally I'd try to get over to Vancouver from Quebec once your show ends. Quebec has a bunch of separate laws/regulations than the rest of Canada, including immigration [I believe there is a french test for PR residency in Quebec vs the rest of Canada which is English only]."

As a US citizen, I moved from the states to Montreal last year to work for one of the major studios as well. I was also stressed, but mainly due to the fact that I never completed my college degree which was one of the on-paper work permit requirements. I could have been turned away right at the border with a uhaul full of my belongings that I drove for 8 hours, but they didn't give me any trouble at all. Supposedly a Canadian border agent is allowed to deny anyone for any reason at their discretion and lock them out from re-applying for 5 years, but I've personally never heard of this happening to anyone. I know exactly how you're feeling right now though, but I really wouldn't worry about it. Applying for backup options 'just in case' wouldn't be a terrible idea, but I think you'll be relieved with how painless the whole process will end up being.

vfx,35uilb,BurnetRhoades,3,Thu May 14 01:02:43 2015 UTC,"Number one reason for people to get bounced at the Canadian or US border if they are moving via car is having a car with a lien on it [lease/loan] and trying to ""move"" to the other country. They won't let you take the car in unless you are maintaining your residence in the other country.  Which usually isn't the case if you are hauling a u-haul trailer.  Straight up tip for my American brosefs going to Canada to work in VFX, don't bother moving all your stuff up. Put it into a nice storage unit and leave it there until you've been in Canada for a bit and then decide if you want to move everything up.  I've had a lot of friends who got totaly burned by moving everything up and watch their 1-2 year contracts get cut short and turned into a 6 month project hire and then you are left scrambling on moving across Canada or back to the US with all your stuff.  That and many regions of Canada has subsidies on fairly shakey ground your job is going to be tied to whatever or not the province you work in is going to have a budget surplus or not.

But you do bring up a good point about how all of this is tied to policies that are only as firm as a given region's whim with the free money.  That's a big deal if you're not single and you're moving a whole family out of country.  My brother nearly did it and the company was going to cover moving his whole family and household to Vancouver but he ultimately turned them down, just like I did MPC in Montreal with a similar deal, though I don't have a family.    We would both have been management or upper level staff but it's hard to trust in something based on a policy that could evaporate or knowing how flakey a lot of productions are with starting, stopping or delaying (to say nothing for turbulent histories in management at most of the major players)."

When it came to actually moving up here it was a complete breeze at the border (where you get the actual permit issued). I know other people who have run into problems, but I think most of that stemmed from not having the appropriate paperwork with them. I'm sure the company will give you a rundown of everything that you need. Be sure to double and triple check that you have it all.

vfx,35tneu,High0nLife,6,Wed May 13 12:30:11 2015 UTC,"Basically using another piece of video with noise, bars and other disturbance, possibly digitized from an old analog source.  This is used to drive a displacement distortion effect.  On top of that, RGB channels are individually scaled or offset either with some kind of random expression, like wiggle() or driven by the same footage that's used by the displacement effect.  The animated shapes would be a variety of things from simple masks to simple 3D object in 3D space.  In most cases it looks like the camera has been 3D tracked, and since there's almost nothing but parallax in this footage it should track nicely.  Within these shapes, in some cases perhaps a simple color overlay with partial opacity is used but I think in a lot of cases they're using the actual plate in a holdout but with the RGB channels swapped around, creating the rainbow colors, or that with an additional color correction."
vfx,35tneu,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed May 13 12:58:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply - could you elaborate on the 'random expressions'? How is that done?
vfx,35tneu,BurnetRhoades,4,Wed May 13 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"Any parameter in After Effects can be animated by an expression instead of keyframes.  You hold Alt while clicking on the stopwatch and it drops you into expression mode.  ""wiggle()"" is one of the most used expressions, I'd guess, because it adds random, though smooth, motion into that channel.   It takes a magnitude and frequency parameter, or how big to wiggle and how fast to wiggle.  Look for the little arrow near the expression window which will pop up a menu of pre-built expressions to drop in there.  I believe ""wiggle()"" is under a ""random"" or ""noise"" sub-menu.  For even more random animation there's the ""noise()"" expression, and a variety of different types.  I'll usually use the noise() that lets me define a minimum and maximum value to jitter between.    Even though it was a mistake for Adobe to design the expression language around Java, the fact that it's there is one of After Effects' single most powerful features and what keeps it from being just the toy that it's often accused of being.  There are just loads of online examples and tutorials involving wiggle() so I suggest you start there, so you can see how it works before applying it to your own file."

vfx,35srdt,eidetic,8,Wed May 13 10:28:51 2015 UTC,I mentioned that almost every movie out there was done at a final resolution of 2k in a thread in /r/hardware. That is the last time I try to inform the general public of something they don't want to hear. Someone who claimed to be a 'Hollywood editor' that had edited Whiplash told me that movies I had worked on were done in 4k yet didn't know what I was talking about when I said that movies have set delivery resolutions.    He also claimed that cg could be easily 'remastered'.  Don't even get me started on how 35mm film is soft at 2k let alone 4k.  From now on I'll just bow out of discussions like that and agree with everyone .
vfx,35srdt,__Cyber_Dildonics__,6,Wed May 13 11:23:25 2015 UTC,But film has unlimited resolution because you can come back in the future and keep scanning! Never mind the quality of older lenses and the grain structure of film.
vfx,35srdt,RiseDarthVader,4,Wed May 13 13:03:08 2015 UTC,"Also, film's resolution isn't contained in the spatial domain thanks to said grain structure so impressions based on even a scanned piece of film or naive measures of how many silver crystals per mm there are end up being misleading as far as true perception of detail is concerned.   Digital acquisition, on the contrary,  with its fixed row + column sampling is more desiring of greater and greater spatial resolution because our pattern recognition wetware, particularly driven off detecting edges, gets tickled constantly."
vfx,35srdt,BurnetRhoades,3,Wed May 13 13:17:58 2015 UTC,Very apt observation.    I've seen people claim 35mm is as good as 4k and I've seen people link to film companies making the same claims off of the same details you've listed.   No one has shown an actual image of a 35mm scan that isn't soft at or above 2k though.    Plates that were shot on the best prime lenses were always soft when I zoomed in to edges.
vfx,35srdt,__Cyber_Dildonics__,3,Wed May 13 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, they have.  This resolution concern is primarily why several discerning filmmakers prefer photochemical finish to digital, especially for anamorphic 35mm.  Side-by-side, round-trip through the process mean that 4K finish digitally was adequate but not as good as photochemical for retaining detail in projection, looking at rolling footage.  That last bit is an important distinction.  Digital scanning is also subject to sampling limitations, don't forget.  edit: but regardless, more to the point of the thread, whether a plate is film or digital, rendering digital elements to plate resolution is almost invariably a waste of time."
vfx,35srdt,BurnetRhoades,3,Wed May 13 14:26:16 2015 UTC,"No one has shown me I should say.  Every plate I've seen has thick edges that falloff over many pixels and renders have to be softened, even at lower resolutions.  There are intricacies that I'm not aware of I'm sure, but I haven't seen anything come close.    I could see wanting to finish onto 35mm film since that takes digital projection out of the equation where possible.  Anamorphic would squeeze more horizontal resolution for a wide format movie, although I've never thought about whether theaters have projected digitally with an anamorphic lens instead of cropping.  I would guess that these advantages are diminishing as projectors get better."
vfx,35srdt,__Cyber_Dildonics__,1 point,Wed May 13 14:43:01 2015 UTC,"Every plate I've seen has thick edges that falloff over many pixels and renders have to be softened   That'll pretty much always be true.  Digital cameras generally have anti aliasing (""low pass filters"" in camera speak) so that you don't get a jittery/jaggy look that would be worse than being slightly blurry.  But there is variation.  Something like an Alexa will come closer to looking sharp than a Red because an HD Alexa has a lot more photosites than 1920x1080 on the sensor.  A Red, OTOH is advertised based on the total number of photosites rather than some scaled down number where it ""looks sharp.""  Which isn't to say one camera is better than another - sharp transitions just need to cover fewer pixels in the final image in a design like an Alexa."
vfx,35srdt,wrosecrans,1 point,Wed May 13 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm talking about softness beyond a reasonable reconstruction filter width."
vfx,35srdt,__Cyber_Dildonics__,1 point,Wed May 13 18:25:04 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""rendering digital elements to plate resolution is almost invariably a waste of time?"""
vfx,35srdt,89bottles,1 point,Sun May 17 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Because of oversampling.  A 2K render has more detail and is sharper than a 2K plate.  Any 2K plate.  The render always has to be blurred to get it to feel like part of the photography.  If you have to blur something then you can save time by rendering to a smaller resolution and scaling up (a Bayer pattern sensor + OLPF means actual resolution of the plate is between 50-70% of the pixel resolution anyway).  There will be certain kinds of elements where this may not work.  That's where the ""almost"" comes into play."
vfx,35srdt,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun May 17 00:52:34 2015 UTC,You might want to look at low pass filtering so you aren't just aggressively blurring the entire image.

vfx,35srdt,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed May 13 13:02:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but theres a distinction between working at 4/6/8K in vfx and the final delivery which is normally 2K right? Are you saying literally no film works at anything above 2k resolution in post? I dont mean just the final delivery format.
vfx,35srdt,bink_uk,1 point,Sun May 24 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"Up until a few years ago, working at 4k resolution was very rare.  As films started to be shot on things like RED cameras, the raw plates might be 4k.  This would open up the opportunity for certain things like denoising, plate prep, keying, and maybe tracking (I have no idea really) to be done at the raw resolution.    Past these stages everything is done at the show resolution or smaller.  CG will not be rendered at 4k and delivered at 2k.  It would be atypical and extremely silly for a vfx studio to standardize working at higher resolutions than they deliver since it slows down everyone's iterations and consumes way more resources."
vfx,35srdt,__Cyber_Dildonics__,3,Sun May 24 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"I worked on a feature that was originally mastered at 2K then I helped get it remastered to 4K.  We went back to the original Red files, re-rendered some timelapses and went through a few small roto/paint fixes then ran it through the same color correction as the original (maybe we tweaked a few shots).  It was a pretty easy job and the 4K looked great.  I guess it was redone because they got an international distribution deal and delivering a 4K master was part of that.  So what we did was basically accelerated 4K post if someone edited and colored a 2K offline."
vfx,35srdt,ScreamingPenguin,2,Wed May 13 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"Probably two or three. I don't remember which. Didn't affect me much on the FX side. We stuck with 1k until delivery. The farm sucked on the weekends, but we got through it."

vfx,35srdt,porkbellybourbon,2,Wed May 13 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"Depending on what it is, CG  tends to be so oversampled compared to whatever you're using as a background plate, it scales well.  I've used scaled up elements where even after the resample from the scale I had to apply a blur filter to get it to set in.  Bayer + OLPF means actual measurable resolution of a given plate from a digital cinema camera is actually quite a bit lower than the resolution of the plates you're given anyway."

vfx,35srdt,Wtkeith,1 point,Wed May 13 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why they would cut in 6k. I think the director was concerned about quality loss.

I have two side 1080 screens, so I don't use windows scaling, which makes the Windows UI reallllyyy small, and it takes some time to get used to.

But yes, if the software doesn't support UI scaling, windows will just ""magnify"" it when you use windows scaling (so your windows UI will look crisp and sharp at UHD, but your Maya/other software will be magnified ~1080p at 200% windows scaling), and all that resolution is wasted.  Not sure what software natively/automatically plays nice with windows scaling settings, still kinda unclear to me, but for now it seems we can't have everything working flawlessly just yet. Its either really small UI (no scaling), blurry normal sized UI (windows scaling), or crisp normal sized scaling (Maya 2016, Photoshop).

I'd say its well worth the investment for what you get in terms of a QoL improvement, but brass___monkey is right, you don't /need/ one. So much space for nuke! SO MUCH SPACE!"

Just make sure you have too many frames, rather than too few.  Ultimately, you're relying on imperfect humans to exactly repeat an action; that's tough."

I'm not sure that this will work, but good luck.  I'd shoot the scene static as well so that you can do the move in post as an option.

If your movement isn't huge you could fake parallax by masking off foreground and background objects and move them independently of the middle.
vfx,35q8n6,codyrowanvfx,1 point,Tue May 12 23:15:10 2015 UTC,That's true.  I could do that if needed.  They're only going to use little bits of the shot (it's a master for the scene) but they want the camera to creep continuously the whole time.

vfx,35rs8a,ElectricBlueVelvet,7,Tue May 12 23:44:02 2015 UTC,Don't composite directly in the scanlinerender. Output only the blood through the scanlinerender and then use a merge node set to multiply together with the background. Or use a Card3D instead of Card and scanlinerender which is much faster and suitable for your setup. Also you don't need an X license for this.

vfx,35rs8a,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed May 13 02:58:25 2015 UTC,Merge Node-Multiply literally multiplies the pixels from one layer by the pixels in another.  In this case the result would be the mid/light tone of the concrete being essentially tinted red.  There is no need to calculate any mask because Nuke is float and always has been (1 x n = n).  In addition to being more precise this makes the math behind almost everything faster and easier to calculate on top of being more intuitive.  I forget when they implemented it but anyone doing real compositing in After Effects should be in float space too.
vfx,35rs8a,E6H,0,Wed May 13 03:44:38 2015 UTC,That's what is happening on a mathematical level but I think my explanation might be easier to visualize for someone not sure about what the mode looks like in practice.

It's be good for you to get some experience as a generalist before moving on. I completely understand that you like money, but that's not always the best way to choose your career.

That being said there's hundreds of missile trail effects tutorials out there, it's pretty much the bread and butter of a lot of FX guys. Start with the basics, get something working adjust it to match as best as you can then tweak it in comp a bit more.  The effects in Iron Man wasn't a push button, you're talking man weeks/months of total time to get the rend result. Sure you can get something looking decent in a day or two but by the time you go through technical issues and art direction changes and client notes, it'll take a while."

They used to only have single point tracking and have only added the camera tracker in more recent versions  Ae still doesn't have a quality camera tracker  Bojou always had the best data. The best accuracy the easiest way to manipulate data sets and get a rock solid point cloud. When it came down to it the results that came out of bojou after the same amount of time as sintheyes were always equal to or better.

Not VFX, mind — I mean contracted satellite/UAV reconnaissance zoom-enhance shit. Tons and tons of programming and fiddling and RnD.  That being the case, not only does it make sense that boujou came out priced up the way it did, it's also outstandingly clever. Their expertise was ultimately leading to weird data-mining with telemetry and whatnot, but that was still years off, and in the meantime — what a windfall. Their work in progress could be spun a around and sold, pre-packaged, to the VFX industry as a tracking tool. They won a technical Emmy for it and  everything... and all the while, what were they selling it for? Ten grand a pop? That's some savvy shit.  Anyway.

I think cost wise it's 3d equalizer and boujou up top at ~6/7k. PFTrack at ~2k and then the low cost contenders at <1k, followed by the pretenders @ package deal costs (like the AE camera tracker).  PF has two different products: PFTrack and PFMatchit. PFTrack is a more robust tracking solution, somewhat comparable to boujou. PFMatchit is a lower cost alternative with fewer features that is similar both in cost and ability to syntheyes.  The Foundry's camera tracker (which is the engine for the AE camera tracker afaik) is many, many steps below all of the above. the foundry does great stuff, but they are not tracking specialists."
vfx,35fzld,ScreamingPenguin,2,Sun May 10 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"AE has a fairly limited camera tracker that's more or less a black box with few options (fewer now than when it was first introduced).  Adobe likely licensed whatever is going on under the hood because I'd expect they could have successfully written a point tracker by now that was worth a damn before making a halfway useful automatic camera tracker.   It could have been from the Foundry, but the Foundry also sells a camera tracker plugin that's more full-featured that's based on the camera tracker in Nuke.  The Foundry also licenses more than develops, though they might have added this tracker to Nuke after licensing Nuke, while also offering it as an AE plug-in.  I can't remember if the pre-Foundry Nuke had tracking built in or not.  Most of the time tracking was done in a standalone tool and curves were exported for use in other packages."

vfx,35fzld,ScreamingPenguin,2,Sun May 10 08:49:10 2015 UTC,"Boujou is priced at $5k because that is where Vicon sees their product in the marketplace.  They put their product on the same level as 3D Equalizer as a tool for people that do matchmoving 8+ hours a day.  Boujou was a front runner in the field of matchmoving and set itself apart early on as being a great tool.  It seems to me though that they are coasting on this reputation and it hasn't aged well compared to what 3D Equalizer is doing for the high end matchmovers out there.  Other matchmoving software is priced at a point where they are meant to be for more generalists.  PFtrack is on the high-end and has some features that other matchmoing software doesn't have, but it isn't priced at $5k anymore it's meant to be competitive but still high-end.  Syntheyes is priced at a point where it's tough to even consider purchasing anything else but is provides certain workflow benefits compared to the Foundry camera tracker.  This level of software is meant to be installed on machines alongside your compositing and 3D animation software.  Maybe you are (or the studio has) a compositor (or whatever) that splits their time and handles the matchmoving and then moves onto comping when that is done.  The bottom line is that software is priced at what they think they can get out of it.  Vicon has an established brand name and some amount of pedigree for Boujou and I guess they think they still make a high-end product.  However I don't think the market has the same opinion high-end shops are using 3D Equalizer for some pretty obvious reasons but you don't see many job postings looking for Boujou specific experience."
vfx,35fzld,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun May 10 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think one also has to consider that it's a hard sell that a specialized, narrow focused application, regardless of how important it is and regardless of how necessary it is, and regardless of how well it might do its job might be a higher per-seat cost than an entire 3D suite, representing far more man hours of development by more people and designed to do an almost limitless variety of work.     This makes The Foundry's price point on Nuke a dubious proposition as well given a leather-bucket-seats license with a render token is more expensive than any of the top 3D suites that include an order of magnitude more development and complexity.  One also has to consider that match-moving and tracking, like roto, is generally considered an entry level or junior position, if you're not leading the team/department.  A higher per seat cost for junior artists might not ultimately matter in the long run but I know it has to cross the minds of frugal DPMs and facility technology officers.  They might feel that it's inappropriate to expect their price to scale relative to the likes of Houdini and Maya but they have to know that the question will be raised."
vfx,35fzld,ScreamingPenguin,2,Mon May 11 00:48:33 2015 UTC,"All good points.  I know the Nuke and 3DE argument of high per seat cost vs the benefits of artist efficiency, high end features, support, extensibility, and really tight pipeline integration has worked out in their favor.  Nuke is so damn efficient and the more compositors you have working with it sharing workflows and gizmos or whatever the better it gets for your facility.  Nuke scales really well from your entry level person to your senior compositor.  Your Nuke license is expensive, but your artists are in front of it every day making the ROI pretty high.  Your point about matchmoving and roto being the entry to junior position is also very important.  An entry level artist could probably solve for most cameras using Syntheyes once they got up to speed.  It may take them 10x as long as a junior artist that knows what they are doing. Using 3DE or PFtrack may give an experienced matchmover a boost, but experience is probably the biggest factor considering how mature the tools are in this sector of VFX.  I did nothing but matchmoving for about 6 months at one point using the old PFtrack (pre node based and all that) and it was a pretty great tool.  Recently I tried the PLE of 3DE and I was surprised just how quickly I was able to get up and going with it and then how much everything sort of fit and made sense, and how quickly I could solve some of my test shots.  3DE would definitely be my tool of choice, but I am cheap so I would probably buy a copy of Syntheyes or PFtrack way before I ever stepped up to 3DE."
vfx,35fzld,CoolDudesJunk,1 point,Mon May 11 01:51:50 2015 UTC,"All these years I've ended up only ever having to track in the compositing context outside of personal projects, and a couple shots I did for Steve Zissou in Boujou, until recently.  I was already a senior TD/CG Sup by the time Doug rolled out the first usable version of TRACK at DD but a suite-mate of mine ended up becoming the tracking and integration lead and I got to watch over his shoulder during the really rough,  early years of several of these packages.  I was happy it was him and not me back then ;)  They got Jeff copies of just about all the competing trackers (at the time I think it would have been 3DE and Ras-Track and I forget what else), because TRACK was still early and to provide Doug Roble with feedback on what was lacking in TRACK (and then TRACK went on to win an Academy tech award).  I ended up never having to use it myself.  A lot has changed since then.  Every place I've worked until now has had a dedicated department that I was very thankful for.  I do recall retention in the department being pretty low.  Folks wanted to stepping-stone into some other discipline as quickly as possible which I can understand but, like roto, it's something that can be as much art as science and so everyone benefits from experience in the role.  I don't really enjoy the process myself but I'm going to have to get more used to it, being in a smaller boutique situation (it's either that or move, and I don't wanna move right now)."
vfx,35fzld,Keyframe,3,Mon May 11 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"I went from compositor to full time matchmover and then back again.  I like matchmoving in a strange sort of way it's like solving a puzzle.  Playing the shot through a few times, looking for things to track, placing the manual trackers then getting an initial solution, then optimizing, getting the error below 1 pixel.  It's kind of fun when there is a start and end point and you can nail it.  Then there are the shots that get so complex that I had to focus and really think about a solution to them in weird ways like splitting up a shot into smaller shots, solving them independently and then hand stitching them together in maya for the final camera.  I found it to be really satisfying because the compositors and 3D guys were always so appreciative of a good matchmove and I could just sit there and solve puzzles all day.  Eventually I did move onto other things like being an on-set matchmove guy and that was kind of fun because I could make sure that I had all my camera and lens data, get reference photos and measurements then go hang out at craft services.  It was fun for a little while, then I moved on from that, I guess it's just the nature of the business."

While ""they"" say a lot of job postings aren't actually the ones you see listed on creativeheads and other websites, many companies that I've applied to want already established compers. Heck, when I was fresh out of college, some people wouldn't even take my resume at Siggraph. It's not impossible, definitely, and I think it's great that you're doing a lot of side work; especially since it seems like you're learning all the comp stuff on your own. My colleagues who are self-motivated to do extra work are the ones who have been very successful.   There are some places you could look into.

When the lensflares are moving around you can tell that the bit depth is set to 8 and that the lens flare were below the grid layers.   You could also work on unifying your blacks a bit more. Try to put a color wash over the entire look to make it seem like its not all from different sources. Remember that its supposed to look like it was all caputered by one camera. No layering.

vfx,35ckbz,i4n,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"Rotoscoping/masking, compositing, keying, and tracking are the fundamental building blocks of a vfx artist. knowing how to make a lightsaber, or an energy ball, or a 3d building being demolished by a bomb  is nothing unless you can create a composite that sells the effect. I've seen compositors who can take really shi**y vfx plates and make them look real and vfx artists who can make incredible vfx plates but because they lack the essential skills of compositing end up with an amateur youtube look...  The rest of the comments are right in talking about the business aspect of things but I think your questions was what skills you need to be a VFX artist.  Here is your guide to get into the industry in as much of an abridged format that I can offer.  Learn the fundamentals of VFX. These are not making incredible works of art like are seen in Marvel movies and Sci-Fi shows/movies.  These are the talents of cleaning up a mess.  Rotoscoping and matte making are absolutely key.  You need to master the art of essentially cutting images into layers. This is 90% of the time the first job you're going to get in the VFX industry.  Once you've mastered the art of using the pen tool next you need to learn to composite.  A good training for this is shooting video of yourself and after roto'ing place yourself in a scene from a movie of your choice.  Matching lighting, color grade, grain, and such to make something ""fit"" within the scene is your second greatest asset and will be used 100% of the time with every single plate you work on.  Keying goes hand in hand with roto/composite, majority of VFX shots utilize a key. MASTER this talent to your best ability and never settle for an O.K. key. the slightest discrepancy in keying ability can lose you a job.  Once again compositing will come into play with light wrap, grading, etc.  Tracking is used in almost every shot in some way, there are so many ways to track it's ridiculous and you don't need to use every one on a shot but every shot will call for a different method, familiarize yourself with planar tracking in mocha, single point tracking in AE, and 3d matchmoving in AE/C4d/Boujou/Synthyes/PFtrack or whatever you can get your hands on.  Those are the ""skills"" the talent is another thing, this will take longer and has a lot more room for blind naivety.  The talent is being able to, as beenyweenies put it ""troubleshoot"".  9/10 shots that you get are not shot with a vfx supervisor on set making sure that there are tracking markers, an evenly lit greenscreen, proper lighting, notes of camera details like exposure/focal length/etc. and you will almost always find yourself trying to polish a turd.  Once you have at least a functional knowledge of these skills make a demo reel. Do NOT put every little vfx test you've done in it and hope that quantity will outweigh quality.  Your best bet is to have a small handful of SOLID shots that emphasize specific skills.  The VFX industry is so large that they generally aren't seeking ""Jacks of all trades"" If they are hiring a roto-artist they want the guy who has a 2 minute reel of nothing but solid roto work, not the guy with a 2 minute reel that has 20 seconds of roto, 20 seconds of keying, 20 seconds of modelling etc..  Lastly and this has little to do with the subject at hand, however it is sound advice. ""Divide and Conquer""  Let this be the first word you say with every single trouble you come up against in the VFX world. If you're rotoscoping a human body, don't make one mask for the whole thing, make one for each appendage, the body, and the head. When you're creating a demo reel, don't make some huge masterpiece with everything you can do, make one focusing on only one skill.  When you're faced with a project that is enormously daunting, localize your work and look at the small picture first.  O.k. I've gone on too long. I hope it helps"

Keylight and Primatte don't work. I want to try Nuke's Difference Key but I can't find a reference plate.  However I'll try my best with the luma key, choke the matte instead of using Key Correct, but I'm not sure if it'll work. I'm not sure why he wants such stupid thing anyway. He asked me for color correction with Resolve and I gave him that. Then he asked me for lens flares which I honestly do for free, it's not like they don't appear everywhere these days. And now this. I just hope I can get my cinematography degree soon before post-production sucks me in cause I know what to do, I just don't want to do it and no one wants to pay me to do it, you know what I'm saying?"

vfx,35ecxw,BurnetRhoades,-2,Sat May 9 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"Well, when the motion flows in a shot like this, it causes random adjustments in 60D which on 90mm on full auto, plus the sky is too bright, come on you spy on me, you probably have a mic hidden in my room, you heard what the guy said ""there's too much flow for keying, can't you cut the branches out?"" to which I replied ""I'll see"".  Now I've been a cinematographer for two months maybe, I'm not sure why 90mm causes flow, what brand of lens he used, I just REPEATED what the cinematographer told me. Okay? Now go find out my first love's name."
vfx,35ecxw,BurnetRhoades,3,Sat May 9 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe he has a speech impediment?  ""Glow"" I could see.  ""Flow"" is, I'm pretty sure, made up nonsense.  The keying is made harder because the lens is all flared out and flashed pointing into what's essentially a giant soft light.  The light contamination is so high that your furthest branches are basically transparent.  But that should inform you as well how visible your birds should be.  The one you put in at the head of the shot was way too contrasty and ""present"" and this will exacerbate edge issues by not actually feeling like it's ""in"" the scene and photographed along with everything else.  They should have no more contrast than any of the branches with thickness similar to the scale of the bird.  The birds would be all flashed and pretty much fully edge wrapped and practically transparent.  All of that makes for some forgiveness in the holdout (or containment) matte you'd derive from luminance."
vfx,35ecxw,adiossatipo,-2,Sat May 9 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"Flow is not nonsense. It means partly out of focus. As in, you move the camera on a dolly on a high speed and it gets out of focus. I read it in books mang. But the books weren't in English so it could be a French loanword. They pronounce it as fulu. It's another one of those words that gets lost in translation... For the first few days he wanted lens flares (and I obviously didn't want that) but I thought he wants glimmer or glow. The main reason /u/instantpancake is harassing me is the language barrier between me and him, and that he's a ruthless racist."

Regardless, it still doesn't seem to apply here because you're neither on a dolly or moving fast.  Any out of focus from this movement would be motion blur, which doesn't need any made up word or term, or the lens being on ""auto"" and simply doing what would be expected and poking around focusing on this and that like a tourist shooting vacation footage.  Now, in the context of your explanation and some terrible DP with a lens on auto-focus I could imagine the term ""follow"" being used, as in the auto focus is having a shit time trying to ""follow focus"".  I could buy that.  It wouldn't really be a correct usage of the term since it would be an assistant camera who tries to ""follow focus"" while an AFS just tries to ""find focus""."

Because I'm in my pre-college rotation right now (now this is not a language barrier, I can't understand what it is either) and they throw the term ""fulu"" around like mothballs. I actually had to write its definition down in my phone, whilst everyone was quickly jotting every single bullshit down.  ""Fulu: partly out of focus. ex: a camera on ground level at normal length, ground in front of the lens is fulu"".  Maybe it's not a loanword. Maybe it's a term they made up because ""out of focus"" doesn't work the tongue. Who knows. That's what he said."

But holy fuck. The fact that they force you to upgrade OS once a year, and thus having to buy a new fucking computer every other year because the one you bought can't run their new system, which you need to run their programs... It's just absolutely retarded. I have a MacBookPro from 2011, can't run Apples OS because it slows it down too much, and it crashes. Installed windows = the computer works splendidly.   It's the same with their cellphones. iPhones are really nice and easy to use. For the first year. Then you have to upgrade the software (they force you to do this by making apps unavailable etc etc), and then your phone is uselessly slow and crashes. And then you have to get a new phone. And hey guess what, unless you want to waste money on a new iPhone, you're gonna lose all your shit because Apple wont alow you to transfer your contacts..  All of these things has made me realize how shitty Apple is as a company. I know 99% of all companies do stuff similar to this, but Apple is just so much worse at it. I'll never get another product from Apple, and i always tell people to stop wasting money on their products. Because that's really what it is at this point, a waste of money. 10 years back apple made some awesome stuff, and i liked it a lot for everything but gaming, obviously. But I don't see any reason to use Apple's stuff anymore - it's just an inferior brand in terms of durability and consistency.   Edit: That turned out to be a random rant about how i dislike Apple.

vfx,35b67e,DoctorOctagone,-3,Fri May 8 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"I think Fifty Shades of Gray is an analogy for AE vs. Nuke. AE has all the tools to satisfy you, plus a shitton of plug-ins, but you have to win Nuke's heart without any aides."
vfx,35b67e,Wtkeith,2,Mon May 11 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"Look, just use the tool that works best for you. Experience is the best teacher, so if you actually want to try to start using Nuke (rather than just coming to r/vfx and comparing it to AE) just download Nuke and learn as much as you can. Don't be emotional about it, these are just tools."
vfx,35b67e,burgernz,-2,Fri May 8 18:31:23 2015 UTC,"Now that Nuke Studio is free I illegally acquire Nuke X. To hell with a US company that doesn't sell their software in my country. I've been doing this for quite some time now, and again, the problem is, maybe I don't have any use for Nuke because I haven't needed to composite a six-layered image... I only needed glitters and glimmers and LENS FLARES. I'm not a serious VFX artist yet, so I have no need for a 7000$ piece of software that James Cameron can't properly use even (I hope)."
vfx,35b67e,GreenScreen20,2,Fri May 8 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"The Foundry is a british company, not american. Ok so... If you are not a serious VFX artist, working in a proper VFX pipeline, you don't need Nuke. That's it. AE will be perfect for you. AE allows you to work in simpler ways, permits a robust animation workflow, and is perfect for motion design, indie filmmakers and minimal commercial work. Secondly... these are TOOLS. While some tools are better than others for some tasks, ultimately it's the artist that decides, for a variety of reasons, what tools to use. If you prefer After Effects, stick with it. Nuke is not inherently better (it actually is on some specific conditions but the same can be said of After in other conditions)      Now with that in mind NukeX is in a non commercial version too so practicing with it has never been simpler. You can just practice with it an try to adapt your knowledge of AE to Nuke. See where that leads."
vfx,35b67e,burgernz,2,Fri May 8 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you need to do.  If you just need to do some roto and keying and maybe import a tracked camera from a program like Syntheyes for an indie project, then AE is just fine.  If you are looking to work at a studio as a compositor, then you would want to learn Nuke.  Or if you need to do more complicated compositing, like doing camera projections where you project a matte painting onto some 3D geometry inside of your compositing application, then Nuke would be a good choice.  It just depends on where your career is headed.  I love AE, but I also took a course on Nuke.  The workflow in Nuke for photorealistic compositing is more robust than AE, but Nuke may not be necessary if you are just trying to complete some vfx shots for an indie film."
vfx,35b67e,i4n,-1,Sat May 9 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"Most studios here want both a compositor and a motion FX artist. AE can do both, Nuke chokes in motion FX. Well I can import from PFTrack to AE, and I can project a matte painting to a portion of my image using masks... maybe I should stick with AE for now, and rely on my basic knowledge of Nuke to spice up my resume.  The reason I'm not going very far is that VFX is not my main venue. I'm a cinematography student and I plan to get my BSC's in it. Or Master's, even."

With smaller crews you get to be more of a generalist and they rarely have room for roto or prep people, you'd be doing a bit of everything.   The pace of working on television can be quite daunting which forces you to learn faster. It might not be the most glamorous work out there but at least you would get a chance to actually do some real compositing. If you take the feature film route, you will be starting at just doing roto or prep."

Often times, ""working up"" means being promoted into a different department, though it may also just mean being reliable and having more responsibility at a smaller studio. The keys are reliability, eagerness to learn, actually learning and to some degree - luck/networking.  I'm UK too. Started out in Roto worked through to Comp, did a bit of stereo conversion (big mistake at that stage in my career imo) and am currently lead compositor on a tv show.

A quick and dirty technique to get rid of dark edges is to use an edge extend gizmo (there are a lot out there, some work better than others) and premult the result with your fg matte. Can destroy a lot of detail though so best used sparingly...  Another trick I usually do would be to defocus the comp, take an edge detect of my fg matte, premult the comp by the edge matte then merge it over the comp again...it's like a slightly nicer edge blur."

Just move the lights in real life, it will take 1/1000 of the time it would take to accurately rebuild a single setup in C4D (let alone accurately simulating one without seeing it in reality first). It's not rocket science, and the lights are meant to be used.  Just make sure to switch them off before you move them a lot, since the tungsten bulbs are very sensitive when they're on.  Also, wide stance on the base. The inner bars are supposed to be roughly horizontal. Leave the bottom screw alone.  Edit: I may have said this before, but you may want to stop making up ""problems"" that keep you from actually shooting anything. Trying to simulate your lighting setup in 3D is just as futile as it's unnecessary, since it literally takes under a minute to do in reality with your gear."

I just spent four hours moving lights around by being alone on the set today (playing around) before even shooting anything. And I had to call in for help to mount the four blondies on the roof grid, which took more time. I also had to call in for help to move the 12'x12' scrim up and down on a pair of windup stands... It would help A LOT if I could simulate accurate light items in 3D.   WYSIWYG is somewhat for that, http://cast-soft.com/wysiwyg/overview I know some people use it."

It literally does take seconds to set those up.

vfx,353rby,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Fri May 8 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The closest I've read to a setup allowing anything approaching this sort of thing would be the lighting kit ILM built for Roger Deakins on Rango.  Barn doors, cookies, gels and maybe flags are as far as most take it.  Still, in a physically based rendering situation it will generally be more efficient to simulate the effects of both bounce board and diffusion through tracing paper or muslin by simply using a larger, dimmer area light to represent the diffusion material only.   Theoretically you could model the effects of the direct, bounce and diffusion components of, say, a ""book light"", but I don't know that anyone is really doing this kind of thing and a casual poke around turned up nothing in this context.    I wonder if the amount of research it would take would translate into something commercially viable, since it's rare that an actual cinematographer is ever involved in post production or visual effects and without true gaffer + DP knowledge your average VFX lighter would be needlessly complicating their workflow in most cases."

vfx,353rby,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun May 10 08:18:39 2015 UTC,It's math not magic.  It's also all measurable.  The only real question is whether the effort would be worth it (it wouldn't in this case).
vfx,353rby,instantpancake,1 point,Sun May 10 08:58:58 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely not worth it, considering that you would also need physically accurate shaders for everything."
vfx,353rby,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun May 10 09:45:45 2015 UTC,"Physically accurate shaders are what goes into physically correct systems.  That's been becoming the norm the last couple years.  They literally force you to observe conservation of energy, generally.  You could create surfaces that don't exist, of course, but PBR is now what you're seeing in virtually every major film.    I use Houdini and though they include their classic REYES style renderer and old-style raytracer they flat out tell you don't use them, go PBR, it's fast and looks better and, oddly, physically based simplifies shading.  Mantra and Arnold are the two most used renderers in visual effects for film now and they're both physically based.  The Weta renderer is also physically based.  But, yeah, that doesn't change the fact that using it to try and previs a small greenscreen setup would be way overkill.  The punchline here is that in high end work, the highest of the high end,  they barely even bother lighting the greenscreen at all.  The screens you'll see on a $100-200M movie will almost invariably be trash compared to some student or regional commercial work that got agonized over.  High end clients don't care if you can pull a key.  If you can't, send in the roto monkeys."

It's mostly accurate, and all you need to do is plug the IES profile into your light in the 3D application.  As for the diffusion and photorealism, you're not going to arrive at anything that matches a real world setup without a lot more 3D chops than it sounds like you might have. There are many complex steps required for this."

The previous three or four shows before these will have made tweaks, eurekas and developments that become useful on the next batch, and each new film has the (potential) to benefit from all of the advancements made by all previous films.    It's not quite exponential but the amount of development done at a studio like ILM dwarfs what can be expected from the likes of Autodesk, Avid, or Adobe who take years to incrementally improve, with development on a more arbitrary timeline, under far less pressure, motivated by whim more than necessity.   Big development VFX houses more often take massive leaps from show to show with future projects as the beneficiary."

vfx,34tjky,Is_it_really_art,11,Mon May 4 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"You've just described this industry.  Most of the work done for blockbusters is done in spite of how bad the films are.  And most of them are bad.  You do the work and you hope for the best.    You can't scale back your effort based on whether you suspect the movie is good or not.  It doesn't work like that.  Find another job if you can't deal with it.  Yes, it is often a shame (though not really in this case, because it's a much better film with a much better script than any Transformer's film) but it employed a lot of people.  The irony here is the Transformers films featured effects often far more photographic than anything in this film, but those were tedious bores to get through.  This one, it's the script that makes it  watchable even if it's technically rough around the edges at times."

vfx,34ww41,TurtleOnCinderblock,2,Tue May 5 09:12:27 2015 UTC,"Ok... I really disapprove most informations this guy gives. You don't Over a render pass like he does in the video. Specular, Diffuse, Reflections... all these components are additive processes. That means anything which is not a straight plus/from will break the shading/lighting of your original image. In his case he Overs the passes in a stack on the side. The math behind and Over is this: A+B*(1-A.alpha) This simply means that the A input is added to the background, and the background is multiplied by the inverted alpha of the A stream. (In english, it means that the alpha from the A input cuts an hole in the BG before the A colors are added to the result) Notice how this is one more step than a simple plus ? The kicker here is that the way this guy Shuffles his passes in the RGBA layer, he shuffles the BLUE channel in the alpha. Which is non sense. The resulting issue is that every times he overs one of his passes, the blue channels comes in as an alpha to mult the BG before addition. That means that on each step he is breaking up the reconstruction of his original image, steering away from the intended shader/light interaction. That's a good way to make the script overcomplicated to take over, and make the CG supervisor angry.  And I won't mention his color operations which are also bad practices for a variety of reasons."

vfx,34ww41,BurnetRhoades,0,Fri May 8 10:03:56 2015 UTC,"Specular and reflection, separately?  Isn't Vray physically based?"
vfx,34ww41,D4wn0ff473,1 point,Tue May 5 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"This is common with most renderers specularity and reflection can be broken into separate passes for ease of control in comp. Physically based or not notes come in physically accurate and non physically accurate. If they want a spec highlight lowered while preserving the entire reflection, or vice versa. This gives more control without having to rerender and tweak shaders."
vfx,34ww41,BurnetRhoades,0,Tue May 5 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"If it's physically based you can't separate.  All non-diffuse reflection is specular reflection.  ""Specular"" is a hack made for giving the appearance of surface area to the reflection of a light source in a non-physical system.  It's mutually exclusive of physically based approaches."
vfx,34ww41,D4wn0ff473,2,Tue May 5 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but typically in production things do not operate the same as a research renderer like pbrt. Arnold is a case in point, a lot of times the specular setting is used to generate a pass and the reflection setting is used for a separate pass so you will not have to re-render based on notes, unless there needs to be a drastic change to the shader design."
vfx,34ww41,BurnetRhoades,0,Tue May 5 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"This is more an unfortunate retention of the phrase.  Arnold does a separate pass for the sampling of direct lighting, of reflections of the light sources themselves, for its ""specular"" pass.  This is not the equivalent to specular() or phong() and their shenanigans.  It implies we're still in the bad old days.  It's still physically based, it's just a light reflection pass with a bad name.  I know full well in production people monkey with things simply because they can.  Making rendering physically correct and moving towards an analog for how on-set lighting is done is supposed to make this sort of wanking a thing of the past.  That's the goal at least.  edit: actually, no, I'd read the difference between the two in Arnold and then went and looked at examples.  Now I'm scratching my head why Marcos did it this way.  ""Specular"" is reflection of everything, including light sources, physically based, allowing soft reflections.  In other words, the real deal.  ""Reflection"" is non-physical, impossibly sharp (unless you're rendering a mirror) and no sampling of light sources, so invisible lights, like old style '80s and '90s raytracing.  There would be very few instances, that I'm thinking of, where I'd ever use this or allow my team to use it."
vfx,34ww41,D4wn0ff473,1 point,Tue May 5 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"It has it's uses. It helps if the client asks for a near diffuse specular value with a sharp reflection. Even if it is not physically correct having these passes available allows for certain massaging of things into place in comp for client requests.   Using normals and position to relight your shot is not physically correct either, but it is done consistently all the time to save render cycles. The real end game anyway is to output a product that pleases the client not physics."

AE sucks, I had to drop in some mograph elements into a shot the other day and tried to use a simple track to get them into the shot.

I've still got a license in storage, installed on a Quicksilver Dual-G4 Cinewave-HD PowerMac.   AE sucks...the lousy track was jittering way too much.   It's crazy that they've done nothing in all this time to improve the point tracker.  It's no better now than it was nearly 15 years ago.  It's like once Commotion was off the market they didn't feel like they had to rise to that level.  Sure, there's Mocha, but not everything planar tracks well.  Having to spawn an external program...shit, Adobe, read some papers or buy better code if your guys aren't up to it.    I just wonder, what the hell is the AE team writing, if they acquire or borrow upgrades to functionality while deprecating intensely functional abilities (ie. Vector Paint), adding abysmally low performance tools (roto brush) and ignore bits that should be gutted they're so freakin' useless (point tracking)?  We need to send The Bobs to Adobe, find out what the AE team actually does there.    I'm defending AE in another thread, but that's because it's not an entirely useless tool, despite it having parts that Adobe should be almost fatally embarrassed by.  If I don't need a 3D camera, I'm going to be making every attempt to focus on Natron if I can't get a Nuke seat."
vfx,34qypd,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Tue May 5 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"I think that adobe has made some great moves in the right direction since CC.  They aren't stuck trying to develop the big new feature that is going to get people to upgrade and now they can concentrate on making everything work better and more efficiently with new tools that are more thought out and integrated into the suite instead of bolted on gimmicks.  After Effects is a very useful tool for motion graphics, and the integration between it and Premiere is pretty solid.  As great as AE is for mograph it's still limited by legacy color space issues and a really weak 3D environment.  How is it that Photoshop gets the ability to bring in 3D objects before AE?  Then for any VFX shot more complicated than a layer or two AE quickly looses it's charm in my eyes.  I am very curious to see what Blackmagic does with their Resolve/Fusion post production lineup.  They seem to be pushing Resolve into a competent editing platform and Fusion could be a decent alternative to After Effects if they can get a shape/vector/text animation system that rivals what AE has."

Some FX passes were rendered in Mantra straight out of Houdini... I believe in both cases we took the spherical lens projections (in Houdini and MtoA) and modified them to get around the inherent stereo issues you get with spherica renders (see here http://www.tokeru.com/mayawiki/index.php?title=HoudiniOculusWip). Basically just a lot of man and render hours - lots of noise removal because even with high samples the environment had some big noise issues and at the low samples we were using the environment pass took no less than 3 days to render. (In reality it was more like 3 weeks to get all our ducks in a row)."

vfx,34hm51,sampsomonium,6,Fri May 1 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"That's quite normal (unfortunately - Texture IO overhead is quite significant at render time, even when fast SSD texture cache storage is used) at high-end VFX level, especially since Mari came along and made painting 4/8k tiles on models with 40+ UDIMS for hero assets easy from the artists' point-of-view, so they don't give it a second thought (do we really need this resolution?).  If you've got layered materials (metal, with paint on top, with rust and dirt), you can end up with many different textures to control diffuse, spec colour, spec reflection, spec roughness, clearcoat, anisotropic direction, bump/normal, displacement, etc. for each layer.  Depending on the pipeline, it's possible to reduce some of these by baking these down to just the above types for all layers instead of for each layer, but it still adds up."
vfx,34hm51,berkut,1 point,Fri May 1 08:06:29 2015 UTC,I can follow you on all that but would they count each individual picture to make a texture? EX: I would use 8 various rusted metal pictures and composite them together for 1 image.   If that was the case I could definitely see how that many or more would be required.
vfx,34hm51,berkut,2,Fri May 1 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, you'd paint (project) each individual source image of the rust / dirt, pattern, etc within Mari onto the model, which would bake it into UV-space onto one of (or possible multiple) the above layers.  So if you were painting diffuse/colour/albedo (depending on what the facility calls that layer), you'd only have one texture for that layer. However, it would be split into the number of UDIM tiles for that asset depending on how it was UV'd, each one of which is a separate texture file on disk."
vfx,34hm51,D4wn0ff473,2,Fri May 1 22:34:59 2015 UTC,"I personally find this quite misleading. An artist is not responsible for painting each one of those maps individually, they are breakouts from the udim assignment of a painted model in mari. It even says there are 538 udim assignments. Which if they are using about 10 map types per version would come out to 10 separate artist painted versions, my assumption is the map types per version are much higher. They are also dynamically used based on camera angle and what is and is not visible. This is about as informative as saying it took 1000 years to render, which is probably also technically true."

I think to make them seem a little more in the environment you should add shadows so they don't look so flat. As for colour correction, the vignetting was pretty harsh. I felt like i had to look harder than i should to see what's going on. Another problem that goes along with the vignetting is the placement of the band. @ 0:46 and 1:40 my eye is trying to follow them but i can't see them. I know what you were trying to do with the vignette changing to the music but it became too much when you put it over the entire video.   I think to make this better, the video needs to be clearer. Play with the effect and make the exposure on the video change levels. Include more closeups from the game. If they're in this environment you should give the viewer a better idea of their surroundings. Maybe put the band in the middle of a firefight or something. Also for the beginning you should add some game ambiance. I was checking to make sure my audio wasn't off because of the dead silence. Overall it was decent, you have a structure for your cutting but i would work on the pace and the variation of shots. Also play with more effects there's so much you could do with the game footage instead of all the pictures!

vfx,34hu93,rworsl,2,Fri May 1 09:41:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't had to deal with this (yet), so I'm quite a noob with this stuff. But as long as you have permission to use the footage, I like your approach to it. A buddy of mine did something very similar, and it seemed to work out for her."
vfx,34hu93,theamplifiedorganic,2,Fri May 1 07:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your idea works. If you did any wire removal, you can also just fake it and show where they would have been too.   regarding /u/theamplifiedorganic's comment: there's a pretty grey area when it comes to snagging final footage of your work from blu-rays for your reel. tbh I don't know anyone who's gotten in trouble over it."
vfx,34hu93,artsyfartsy-fosho,1 point,Fri May 1 08:38:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when we left we kind of got a vague ""now this isn't what I'm telling you to do, but this is what artists sometimes do... nudge nudge wink wink..."" sort of thing from our supervisor regarding ripping from Blu-Rays so I'm not overly worried about that. Kind of odd situation at the moment though in that Unbroken is out on Blu-Ray in the USA but not in Australia where I am. Might just hold off the job search for a couple of weeks until it releases here. Thanks for the reply."

vfx,34hu93,sabreToothBucket,2,Fri May 1 08:47:33 2015 UTC,"Movie studios tightly control what gets seen by the general public due to the millions of investment they make in those movies. As such they generally don't like showing unfinished work, unless they want to make money on it in the blu-ray extra scenes. Often the contractual obligation doesn't allow for the release of before and after footage to the artists.  Vfx companies that you apply to know this. So don't worry if you don't have a breakdown on your reel. Show the shots as they were and provide a detailed explanation of exactly what you did.  As a side note.... Do not try to misrepresent what you did as the viewer will often know the supervisor and can easily ask them. I have seen this often and it has usually meant the person didn't get hired and was also in a lot of trouble with the previous supe."
vfx,34hu93,CodeRedFox,2,Fri May 1 13:12:23 2015 UTC,Tough spot to be in. Rip the shots from media source and provide on screen explanations of what you did in your reel (opposed to a secondary info chart). Holding/looping on a frame is a great idea.
vfx,34hu93,shidarin,2,Fri May 1 16:20:19 2015 UTC,Getting breakdowns is not common. You play the shot. Don't play it multiple times. Play the shot. Attach a breakdown sheet (which you should always be doing) which describes what you did.  Don't waste the reel reviewers time by playing the shot multiple times.
vfx,34hu93,Oblagon,2,Fri May 1 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"No one really gives out footage anymore either. Vendors usually can't get permission or doesn't want to dedicate manpower to dump footage for reels, or if they do its not until AFTER the home video release.   Everyone I know basically rips footage after the movie is in wide release or on home video. Studios won't generally allow breakdowns to go out since they want control over the final image. Unless they want it part of a extras for blu-ray.  Want a break down? Try to get the shot into a VES or Siggraph submission.  Otherwise you're stuck with final shots these days.  It's still amusing to see companies request breakdowns, especially when they themselves don't allow it out of house."
vfx,34hu93,LazyCon,2,Fri May 1 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"This is too common nowadays.  it's hard enough to get footage with a lot of companies.  I wouldn't loop it. Just show it, tell them what you did in text,  then move on to the next shot. No one wants to be blasted with the same shot over and over with no change.  Repetition like that just makes it look like your filling space because you don't have enough stuff."
vfx,34hu93,mm_vfx,2,Fri May 1 22:16:41 2015 UTC,"Compositor here - Just play the shot, and attach a breakdown sheet with the reel.  The only breakdowns we get these days are the ones they include on the dvd, so if your shot isn't among them, tough luck.  You can do the fake highlighting for places where roto / cleanup was needed, but don't play the shot multiple times, they'll just go to the next persons' reel."

It's very fast and pretty easy to pick up the steps you need to do this even if you get long, raw takes and have to set your own ins and outs.  Then, generally, everyone want DPX back even though it's old and bloated but it wouldn't hurt to ask if they'd take EXR in return.  edit: I would add, don't get already color-corrected plates from the client.  You don't want to be having to match your work to footage that's been molested by a colorist or even a DIT + DP on set.  With these modern cameras anything they do on set will follow the footage as metadata rather than baked pixels.  If you get the raw R3D you'll be able to do your work straight and then have the ""look"" applied on top through a LUT."

You usually don't need too many markers and depending on the angle of the camera it might make your work harder for you (paint out) if there's too many. Take 360 Reference Everywhere you can.

I'd change your fade to black transitions, if you don't want to use direct cuts then use those as opportunities to express style (just not wipes).  Also, always start your work with your best. Your explosions should be earlier.  I'm not sure about the choice of music, it might be fine and I don't have a better suggestion. But I'd suggest you think about the timid Recruiter who is looking through tons of reels each day, anything that puts a smile on their face will garner much more attention than something that is edgy & dark.

There's a lot of empty space in the warehouse scene, personally I'd model a rugged old jeep, right down to the last nut and bolt and have that the focal point of the scene and maybe throw in a turntable too.  The sci-fi one too, feels very planar. Look here and here for some good examples of the level of detail I'm talking about.

I would just make one large matte painting combining the the first and last frames then project from frame 1. You will then most likely need to scale out to fit the projection in frame so make sure to change the focal length with the scale. Not sure if that makes sense. It would take me a minute to show but rather hard to type out.

There's other departments and artists who worked on it, and I'm sure other FX artists made elements for those shots.  It would be very unusual for a feature animation to have one person do all of the elements for an FX heavy shot. Typically you'll have one person who does all of the snow, someone else who does all of the ice shards, someone who does the magical dust, etc.  That's why I really like to see some kind of annotation in the reel about what specifically they made in each shot.

I saw one reel lately that put a credit title card right at the end of the reel saying the shots are a collaborative effort and listed the other FX td's on each show that shared on the shots.

VFX is still a below the line industry, and while the needs for tools change as do the requirements to meet our ever changing challenges from day to day, acquisitions like this force us to continue to think outside the box, and come up with newer, better, and more focused toolsets to help us achieve the end goal.  Everyone groaned when Apple bought shake and tanked it, now look how awesome Nuke has been for almost a decade.  I don't see Adobe buying this to continue to support it for VFX artists specifically, but rather to just license the tech and spread that out to their larger market base of graphic designers and somehow maybe Acrobat needs a solid keyer, haha.  In all seriousness, it hopefully means a new challenger to Nuke at some point here.  Can't be a bad thing."

No one is ever going to do serious VFX compositing in After Effects, it just doesn't happen. There's no real crossover in their audiences so I think Nuke would likely be fine. Were Adobe to kill it, I don't think many users will be happy to cross over to BlackMagic's Fusion.  Nuke is high-end film and tv vfx compositing. AE is predominantly motion graphic and C4D integration. Mari, Modo and Katana could be Adobe's first real foray into 3D. And I'm not sure what it'd mean for that software, but I think Adobe's interest in the foundry might be tied to those, given recent investor interest in applications used for 3D printing."
vfx,340mcc,BlinkingZeroes,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:53:21 2015 UTC,There's no real crossover in their audiences   This is incorrect.  You have seen major motion pictures with After Effects composites as well as countless television shows.   That's simply a fact.

I don't say this to dismiss AE, as Nuke users are like to do - I like AE, and I use it a lot on personal projects (I started out in mograph). But it's just not suited to large shows with heavy cg integration at big studios with large pipelines. This is where Nuke's audience is.  I could go on and explain why (terrible paint and roto tools, no python api so it doesn't integrate well, slow load and render times, multi-shot based environment where vfx is a single shot environment world, crappy grading tools) - but I'd run the risk of sounding like I was hating on software I like.   But it's simply not used to do high end vfx in the way Nuke is, and if you believe that's untrue - then you don't work in high end vfx. That said, I've heard it gets used for some pure 3d animated shows - so it does get used here and there. I wouldn't say that amounts to real audience crossover though.  For example, you couldn't swap Nuke and AE."

Even relative newcomers will know about the demise of Shake.   I feel like we're just misunderstanding each other at this point and going nowhere - it's true that there are no absolutes, and whilst I don't see AE and Nuke occupying the same spaces, I don't think that counts for much given Nuke Studio's direction is definitely something AE could do."

The only thing AE lacks are some of the faster tools that nuke has in it's node based environment, and full 32bit support. It's pretty sad that AE makes you use 16bit to do shit."
vfx,340mcc,Erawick,1 point,Mon May 4 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if they're still using it in a big way.  It's been a few years since I spoke to anyone about what tools they were kicking around over there.  I'm good friends with several of the sups from their days working on my teams at DD.  Up until its demise AE was still very much a part of The Orphanage too.  But when it comes down to it, there's not really any magic here.  There's a lot of things that AE does that are not as good as in Nuke, not as efficient, etc.  Built-in tracking isn't as good.  Roto isn't as good.  The camera model is goofy with its inverted Y.  There are all kinds of quirks that are easily picked apart.  But in the hands of a competent compositor there is no difference in the quality of the output.  Add-on Primatte to AE and you're not going to get inferior keys compared with Primatte in Nuke, you just have to deal with a more (to some) tedious workflow.  edit: and most of the time when I run into something that doesn't work in 32bit it's either a gimmicky thing and I'm being lazy or it's something that I can re-build or do with a few more layers and gawdawful precomping.   Being a pain in the ass is a little different than useless in this case."
vfx,340mcc,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Mon May 4 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"There are no 32bit grain tools. That's the ONLY fucked up and sad thing about after effects that I have come across in 6 years of using it professionally. Everything else you can fix with plugins and some late nights.   The Adobe grain tool, whether 8, 16 or 32 bit, is junk, for the most part.  It's slow as hell and looks nothing like real grain, no matter the settings.  But getting around its lack of 32bit support is pretty easy, if not a little tedious.  Add the grain effect to a 50% grey solid.  Basic settings are fine.  Pre-compose this with a second 50% grey solid above it and transfer mode set to Subtract.  Now what you have is signed noise that will add +/- some value, in a layer that you can scale, blur the channels independently and with values in each channel that you can alter with standard color-correction tools.  Then you just add this layer over the top of your comp or through a Track Matte.  Better yet, render off five or ten seconds of the grey solid with the grain effect on it and replace that layer in the grain pre-comp.    It's way more steps, it's way pain in the ass, but, if you're not gonna use something like a scanned element of real grain I find this approach is both faster and lets me dial in the various channel amounts, plus overall size, much better than simply applying Adobe's shitty grain effect to a layer, while maintaining the integrity of my 32bit layers.  None of these digital cinema cameras have ""grain"" anyhow so matching to their fixed pattern, DSLR-looking noise is easier these days than what we had to deal with back when it was all scanned film."
vfx,340mcc,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Mon May 4 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"The contribution of values in the grain are so slight, ultimately, the difference between 16bit and 32bit is negligible.  The point is your footage maintains integrity.  You're not getting floating point precision in the noise (or color) coming off any of these cameras anyhow, or a scan of film.  However, when you apply a color correct that scales the values, or you spatially scale it to match size, you're re-sampling these values into the 32bit domain.  The important thing is your footage, what's being grained, isn't being adversely effected by the limited colorspace of the plug-in.  The actual values generated by the plugin for the noise itself is inconsequential."
vfx,340mcc,BurnetRhoades,0,Mon May 4 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"Adobe is all mass market and no high-end though. I can't remember any substantial technological or creative innovations from Adobe after they released the Mercury Playback engine in Premiere CS5 which was the most substantial performance boost I'd ever experienced in any software from one release to the next. That was five years ago though.  Since then it seems mostly nonsense and gimmicks that maybe work for a feature demo video but aren't really that meaningful in real-world production. MODO seems to have a more generic approach that focuses on extremely solid fundamentals which makes it much more flexible and powerful in my view. C4D does flashy simple gimmicks very well, too, and would be a much better match for Adobe.  I don't see how MARI or NUKE fit into Adobe's portfolio at all and I'm worried they might be dumbed down substantially."
vfx,340mcc,c-r-u-x,1 point,Tue May 5 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"I don't see how MARI or NUKE fit into Adobe's portfolio at all...   Dunno about Mari but the attractiveness of Nuke should be obvious.  Were you not paying attention to the Adobe coverage in the wake of Gone Girl?  The focus of this was Fincher and his editorial crew cutting a 6K, Oscar and BAFTA nominated movie in Premiere and doing (more like prototyping I'd guess) effects through the live link between Premiere and After Effects.  I had to laugh at these stories because this ""technology"" is seriously over-billed and offers terrible performance and reliability when used in this way.  It kills Premiere performance specifically.  But they were making a big deal about these guys doing their own effects and composites without having to immediately hire out the work.    It doesn't get much higher end than David Fincher using your tools.  Having Nuke on the other end of that ""live link"" would make a difference.  It would be a tool Fincher would likely have more respect for, since he was a long time client at Digital Domain.  It would make for better press too.  Two time Academy Award winning editor Bruce Baxtor:   “I found Premiere very, very easy to work with and very user friendly,” says Baxter, “but the attraction to it is all of the After Effects shots and how we can be doing visual effects in-house and reducing a lot of that cost and increasing a lot of the speed of these things and the promise of what’s to come.”   ...wouldn't someone like this maybe rather be using Oscar quality software to do this sort of thing if it were available from the same vendor?"
vfx,340mcc,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Tue May 5 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"My entire point was that they don't fit in, and that Adobe may look at buying them in order to expand their portfolio.

Maya and other software packages go for around $200 for the entire package. Not to mention the $469 per render license for nuke. So as a freelance artist if you have a small ten machine render farm that you want to take advantage of and 1 working computer it's going to cost you $7035 for 10 annual render licenses and a standalone for 3 months.

They get as much done in-house as they can in AE, and then if they need more they rent out a nearby CG house as that's so much cheaper than getting their own Nuke licenses.

There were quite a few souls trying to convince  John Hughs that R+H needed to invest in Nuke rather than continue developing Icy.  You could likely argue both sides very convincingly on the issue of rendering.  He just really hated writing checks made out to 3rd parties with no control over development.  Plus, the founding culture is from a time when you couldn't compete on a global level with anything that could be bought.  Where in house development really shines is when it's for tools that don't exist in the market, or that lap the capabilities of what someone with a checkbook or credit card can just go buy."
vfx,342nfg,BurnetRhoades,5,Tue Apr 28 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"Every major/large studio use programmers to develop in-house tools. Sometimes they're full applications (instead of using off-the-shelf ones) sometimes they're just plugins for off-the-shelf applications. Most often, it's a combination of the two. I'm pretty sure Nuke, Katana, and Arnold (among others I can't remember at the moment) were all originally tools built by programmers at large studios that were later sold to third-parties to expand their use to the entire industry."
vfx,342nfg,veystass,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"Nuke was developed at Digital Domain, beginning in 1993, first used on True Lies.  I would have finaled one of the first shots done in Nuke ever put to film.  DD marketed the package for a time sometime after Nuke3, though I don't recall how successfully.  A VFX studio is not an ideal environment to sell and support software.  I think it was sometime after Michael Bay and his investment group bought DD that they worked the deal to license it to The Foundry.  Katana was, I've read, co-developed by Sony and ILM.  The last time I was at Sony it still wasn't ready for even trial use on any production so folks were still using BIRPS.  Arnold was originally developed by a single fellow as an alternative MAX renderer and made a big splash with the ""Pepe"" short animations at Siggraph 1999.  As I remember this coincided with Station-X announcing they'd licensed Arnold for their project:Messiah package.  And then in the 2004 timeframe Sony selected Arnold as the renderer for Monster House and brought Marcos to the US to continue developing the renderer in-house because it lacked a lot of necessary features for use in production. The rest is history."

The creepy feeling I always got when they were on ""the lot"" came back.  Some good folks there though, or were.  There were some really clever TDs doing specialized solutions for various effects (Strand I liked in particular) but I was never really that enthusiastic about their application level work.  The idea, the foundation of BIRPS was really solid, but man that interface.  Same for Bonsai.  So many of the Sony solutions were about brute, blunt force with an army of bodies pushing from the other side.  The embedded nature of Zemekis and their (at least temporarily) hitching their wagon to his creepy lack of taste was unfortunate.  On top of Ghost Rider misery, my second tour there my cube was in constant ear shot of the executive assistants and sometimes even with headphones on I had to listen to their ridiculous conversations about how Zemekis was going to make them the next Pixar.

vfx,342nfg,kyoseki,3,Tue Apr 28 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"As far as VFX studios are concerned, I'd say that the days of developing full applications from scratch are probably gone for now, even most of the software jobs advertised at VFX companies are for plugin/tool developers rather than guys who will develop entire applications - Nuke, Katana et al were all developed in a different business climate and got sold to the Foundry because it's cheaper to have a third party do the development than it is to run your own software teams.  That said, the big feature animation studios (Disney FA, Pixar & Dreamworks) are still very R&D/software heavy, because, as the content creators, they can afford to support a team of developers.  Most of the VFX studios work as vendors and so don't generally have the overhead to run their own heavy software development teams, certainly I've noticed the number of software guys slowly dwindle everywhere I've worked at recently.  I've also noticed that TDs are expecting to do more of the heavy lifting when it comes to tool development as well these days, particularly when it comes to things like shader development & pipeline tools.  Most of the programmers I know have given up on VFX and gone to work for Google, Facebook, Apple etc... eg. SPI lost most of their coders when they relocated to Vancouver and most of R&H's senior coders all left during or shortly after the bankruptcy and got jobs in the real world."

Even Pixar have started moving to tools like Katana for lighting instead of their own proprietary tools which they used in the past.  There's a lot more Python integration between tools these days, integrating stuff into pipelines.  There are exceptions: Weta (wrote Mari) have their own renderer now (still using PRMan a bit), and there are rumours they're writing their own compositor as they're getting a bit fed up of Nuke and the direction The Foundry are taking. Feature animation is also a bit different and companies like Disney, Dreamworks SKG and BlueSky do a lot of custom stuff, but they also use commercial stuff like Nuke and Katana as well, so...  On the rendering side of things, generally the bigger studios write their own shader libraries completely instead of relying on the shaders which ship with the commercial renderers."

I was able to use the method in the video to make a solid of the flames, but all the smoke was excluded from the object.   http://imgur.com/ecNiaOr  I took a few screenshots to show what I mean. These are three different frames - as far as I can make out the fire is being converted to solid, but the smoke is being ignored (as best exemplified in the past shot, where all the fire has burnt out and the smoke remains, leaving no solid in the perspective window at all)  I'm a bit stuck now, and am not sure if it is even possible at all.  I'd love to see if someone has actually done it, as a first step.  I THINK it might be possible to do it in Maya, that is, to render flames and smoke and then convert to solid. But I'm not sure if it would just create the same problem I have found here. And I don't use maya very much at all, so it would be a lot of trouble even if possible.   Anyone have any ideas?"

The particles form the 'flames', but the smoke is something else, and it seems to be unselectable in the viewport. Are you sure I won't just run into the above problem even if I get it into Houdini: that I will be able to make a solid out of the flames but not the smoke? (i.e. can make an editable poly out of the particles but not whatever the smoke is)"
vfx,33yyzk,Oblagon,3,Tue Apr 28 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, the smoke is a ""fog volume"", a scalar voxel grid, just a rectangular data structure containing densities in each voxel.  Converting a scalar field to a signed distance field gives it a hard surface, then you convert from the SDF to polygons/triangles and that should give you something you can print - this really is 3 nodes in Houdini, not sure about Maya or Max.  It looks like Maya has an .f3d (field3d) importer and Fume can export the smoke to .f3d, hopefully Maya has something that can convert a fog volume to an sdf and then polygons, if not, you can export to vdb from Maya and do it in houdini (unfortunately, it looks like if you want to import field3d to houdini, you have to compile the plugin yourself)."

But failing that, you seem to be saying that as long as I can get my FumeFX stuff into Houdini somehow, I will definitely be able to convert it to polygons, smoke and all?  In that case I had better get myself a copy of Houdini and try it out.

The only issue you'll have left is changing point count frame to frame which depending on your needs may not be an issue.  If you need to shrink/expand the boundrys of the volume during the conversion you can use a vdb_reshape dropped in before the convert to polygons step and use dilate/erode to grow/shrink the conversion result.

After Effects becomes a big question mark.  A lot of what didn't work well in 2001 still doesn't work well.  Its whole paradigm is problematic once you get beyond fairly basic compositing.  It's an unrepentant memory hog.  And Adobe has had to acquire other technology or applications to make up for what they can't seem to write themselves, with ad hoc levels of integration after the fact.  It might be time for it to go.  It would likely be easier and more beneficial to add more motion graphics tools to both Nuke and Premiere.  They have been adding more and more AE-like functionality to Premiere in any case, it mainly needs a better interface for anything you're animating.  The motion graph in AE isn't good but it's still much better than what Premiere has.    The live link that they've been really going to town on in the press, particularly with the Gone Girl coverage, is mostly an illusion.  I can't imagine doing a whole feature that way because for projects of just a few minutes it breaks constantly, very basic changes to the footage in Premiere don't always translate in a meaningful way to After Effects and it's a toss of the dice if any speed change makes it through intact.  Not only that, it completely kills your performance in Premiere because as soon as you get to an embedded AE comp you drop to single-threaded performance.  You have to pre-render from AE and replace any embedded comp with a clip if you want to maintain any level of performance.  The two of them working together doesn't work as well as either of them on their own.  Whether it's too much legacy code or not enough interest, they haven't been able to fundamentally improve AE in over a decade where the basics are concerned.  It's still filled with effects that don't work in float (Nuke never had this problem because even the alpha version in 1993 was float).  Simple point tracking is still bad.  The roto tools are still bad.  Nuke buys them into very rarified territory."
vfx,33xw90,Bizlitistical,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, they couldn't build mari in completely, i'm more worried about them stripping mari for parts and adding those into ps. what makes mari amazing is it's cache voodoo that let's you work on enormous files without slowing down your computer. that's something I could see them trying to put in photoshop.  i still use hiero with nukex and it works great. if they try and force premiere in instead, i could see this going bad pretty quickly. although i wouldn't mind a speedgrade node in nuke.   not sure how they'll balance the needs of the different markets though. my graphic design friend using photoshop and ae on her imac works way differently than I do in nuke and houdini on my 10 core quad titan workstation. I know she would be as pissed if she got forced into nuke as i would be if i got forced into ae."
vfx,33xw90,Bizlitistical,2,Sun Apr 26 23:42:34 2015 UTC,"Well Black Magic just bought Fusion and Autodesk is still struggling to find an audience for Smoke so I doubt they're in the market. Avid doesn't have a heavy VFX item in its lineup but they aren't the most liquid company. Adobe is the defacto choice although Nuke would fill a weird spot in Adobe's lineup, as would Mari and their other IP.  Of course, say goodbye to Nuke free, but the full version would be rolled into the student price so bravo for that possibility.  An interesting dark horse would be someone like Technicolor/Deluxe to snatch them up."
vfx,33xw90,Bizlitistical,-2,Sun Apr 26 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"I was kinda hoping for someone like Google.  All of these other Usual Suspects suitors could disappear overnight and I don't think any of them haven't flirted with financial ruin.  Visual Effects, after all, is a bad investment.  Someone like a Google or Apple wouldn't have the same pressures to keep these bad investments operational for the prestige of it, though Apple seems uninterested in professional apps at all these days and they haven't the best history or reputation in this area either, just more money than God.  Heh, I wonder if Blackmagic is lamenting their choice now or if the whole kit with The Foundry was just too much money."
vfx,33xw90,Bizlitistical,3,Sun Apr 26 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Who knows. I would be a great time for Adobe to buy a flagship product and they already have smaller ties to the Foundry through various things licensed for After Effects. They're quite cash rich and their DVA division is ripe for winning marketshare. Adobe isn't going anywhere for a while because their main money maker is Acrobat & PDF and that currently has no substantial competition.  What weirds me out is that Adobe is very strategic with their purchases and how it rounds out their lineup. Of course, bringing in the Foundry would give them great DAM in Hiero, something that could potentially push them over the edge with Adobe Anywhere and their fight to rival Avid by becoming more ""team"" centric. Adobe also currently doesn't have any good code around network rendering which the Foundry can bring.  The issue becomes what if they get sold to another venture capital firm or to, again, someone like the Technicolor/Deluxe partnership or Google is that the toolset is great but would they have the sense to improve the product and expand the market for it? Otherwise it can keep on keeping on but there won't be great returns on the risk.  Another option is the idea maybe a video game company will snatch it up like Epic Games. The synergy between the Foundry's portfolio and something like the Unreal Engine wouldn't totally be out of the ballpark because of Modo and Katana."
vfx,33xw90,Bizlitistical,3,Sun Apr 26 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"Apple is perhaps the one company in the whole world that I would be more afraid of buying Foundry than Adobe.  Apple killed off the last two compositing apps it bought, so I'd expect The Foundry would have the same fate as Nothing Real and Silicon Grail, and a few ideas from Nuke's tracker would wind up in a new automagic stabiliser for FCP-X or something.  Adobe probably won't necessarily just murder it outright, which puts them ahead of Apple.  They'll just kill off Linux support, and make it essentially impossible to run a studio by moving to the awful CC licensing across the board.  And of course maybe they'd just be buying Nuke to kill it in favor of After Effects anyway.  If they don't kill off Nuke, they may eventually add support for shitty 8 bit After Effects plugins, and deprecate python scripting in favor of F&#(ing Javascript to ""unify"" their tools.  Autodesk would at least let it putter along for a while in stasis like XSI for a few years after they dump all the developers.  That might be the best of the likely outcomes since it would give realists enough time to rework their pipeline so they can jump ship to something else.  I dunno what Google would do with it.  They don't have an obvious play to make.  It'd either have something to do with modo + ocula for doing VR content for Google Cardboard, or Nuke + Hiero for doing content for YouTube.  If it was a VR play, you'd probably get Modo turned into some sort of app that runs best when using a VR headset instead of a 2D monitor, and Ocula would somehow be integrated into Android for shooting 3D videos on your phone.  If it was for YouTube, they'd probably want to turn Nuke into a web app for doing some effects on your YouTube videos in your browser or on your phone or Chromebook.  But either of those are pretty far outside of their core competencies.  But yeah if Adobe does buy The Foundry, there are going to be a lot of very concerned discussions about Plan B's at every major VFX studio."
vfx,33xw90,Bizlitistical,3,Sun Apr 26 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"loss if linux support makes nuke a non starter for many studios. they don't have time for this windows and mac bullshit on production machines. They just want the work finished by the deadline. I could see nuke being replaced by something open source like natreon. (obviously this is like, millions of fingers crossed) it just needs a few man years of serious development. studios have been collaborating a lot more openly recently because they it helps everyone make more money and I think its time for a bigger project along that route. Just software that works how they want and doesn't break the bank. at some point you gotta get tired of paying big bucks for the same shit over and over."

The thing you have to remember about this picture is it was back when everyone was using NURBS.  Being a parametric surface affords a lot of interesting possibilities for remapping a piece of geometry based on another piece of geometry.  As effects go it is one of the most interesting and most clever in the whole film.

vfx,33tqsm,gameronclegg,2,Sat Apr 25 17:13:09 2015 UTC,"as the previous poster mentioned, what you try to do requires the expertise of multiple VFX artists and would take you very long to achieve in a decent standard. if I understand correctly you have a photo you want people to bring it to life. Is it just one picture? sounds like that could get boring real quick. or are there multiple different shots? always still photography? at least on stills you have no tracking worries. to add people realistically their lighting should match as good as possible. if it is an outdoor environment shoot the people outdoors in front if a large enough green screen. if they are supposed to interact with walls, it may help to analyse (photo fit) the picture and recreate the scene in 3D to get some measurements, the lens and camera info would be really handy to help you later to shoot elements for it. the angle if the original cam can be different to what you have to use for shooting the people. you can get the required angle by checking in your picture the horizon line and the angle to it from the position your elements have to be. you then can shoot ""vignettes"" of people, reacting with some greenscreen cube or wall. again, the lens used for the original is vital, so us the correct height of the cameras. always use a tripod for these elements! with regards to rainwater...it's fairly easy to create layers of rain with particles, but the ground interaction will be more difficult. that's at best handled by a FX TD. if the interaction doesn't need to be shown too closely, you could consider filming a rain machine in front of black cloth, then use the material to comp it in. good luck."

vfx,33tqsm,randoomly,2,Sun Apr 26 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"ok, watched it.  although I couldn't see any rain particles in the video. my previous reply is still valid. then angle  and lens of the phot is important to figure out so the perspective in your people will match. the only additional note is to pay attention to the floor. not only will you need to add occlusion shadows under the feet of your characters, you also need to add their reflections and use their alpha to occlude the sky reflection. sorry, can't help you with the rain bouncing off. that's one for an FX Td. I would recommend Nuke to comp and Houdini for the FX. the lens used looks pretty wide, so lens distortion may need to be matched up ( de-Lens the additional elements, position them in the scene, re-lens with correct lens distortion of the background plate) . also, since the plate is mostly in shadow, you could shoot in a studio with soft lighting."

Make sure your mv pass is being processed at the half interval and not full frame. You want it to calculate in between frames, hence the -.5 offset.

Larger companies can afford to pay more You say it's a lead? Are you a lead with 3-4 years experience or someone with 3-4 years experience applying to be a lead? If it's the latter, the job isn't for you.   45 is high but depends on your experience and the company. What can you bring to the company? that's what they will be asking themselves and will determine what they want to pay for you based on that. If you don't know what your hourly rate is for that position is likely your experience isn't too high.... so be careful about pricing yourself out."
vfx,33ke1s,eighty6in_kittins,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a senior artist at a large company that converts movies to stereo. I've worked on many feature films, like the avengers, godzilla, wolverine, and many many more. Recently I've been taking more lead responsibilities, but I haven't had the official title. I've been helping people on my team, going to dailies and meetings, assigning shots, all while still working on my shots. What we do is a lot of responsibility creating, clean plates, hair, etc. We do some keying, and work with outside elements from other studios. Those element comps tend to be more complicated than out normal comps. I know people look down on stereo conversion, but we really are compositors. I understand, though, that 2d comps are different, but I feel like I can pick it up pretty easily. So do you think I would be qualified? I'm not sure if the company I want to apply at is big or small, im guessing it's a small company because I've never heard of it and it was hard to find when I looked it up. I'm going to look more into it."
vfx,33ke1s,sabreToothBucket,2,Thu Apr 23 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"i've worked with stereo conversion specialists. I don't look down on you guys at all. As a matter of fact, I value the experience that a stereo conversion artist has, if they were to apply for a comping position. AND, I would choose them over someone straight from school or strictly comping. Why? Because:  A) They've had to deal with the shit of compositing scripts B) They've looked at those scripts, and know how and when and why a composite is the way it is C) They've had to fix that shit  As a stereo lead artist, I would bank on another 10% on top of what you make, hourly. I won't put that into dollar figures, because who knows what you make (unless you tell us, and it might be on vfxwages as well). There are not that many houses in LA, but if you DON'T want to stereo convert, you could get a comp job in the ~40 to ~45 range, but you won't get a lead job elsewhere immediately, until at least after one show at a new facility."

vfx,33ke1s,shkaa887,2,Fri Apr 24 09:27:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply here.  Your management skills are transferrable but not your comp skills to the large vfx houses. It's not a matter of looking down on anyone, it's directly related to the work that goes on in conversion and the work that goes on in producing the shots to be converted. While there is some cross over, at a higher level the skills are vastly different. If you have only ever done stereo conversion you would not be a senior artist at the bigger houses. If you were to apply at a larger company, lead comp would not be something to aim for.  If, however, the company is much smaller. Say 3-5 comp team, that a different story as the type of work is more generalist based. If that suits you better, go for it! Not trying to discourage you at all, just giving a view on what to expect.  Good Luck!"

There are plenty of for profit colleges that you'll pay out the ass for, and online is pretty cheap, but you can't get feedback or direct help with your work. I'd go for the spot in the middle where people pay a few hundred bucks to get educated on the software in question.  I also wouldn't have salaried employees at this point.

But I can guarantee them fine work samples, because my class is project oriented.  2- The money. I don't own the place. I have to pay 45,000 IRR to the owner for the class each session. I have to charge a lot, either that or get a lot of students but the maximum capacity of the class is only 25. Granted I get 25 applicants, I have to charge them each 1,800 IRR just to make the rent.

Depending on the company, whether or not they consider ""runner"" and PA an equivalent, the next step being coordinator.  Maybe they do things differently in the UK."
vfx,33kug3,BurnetRhoades,2,Thu Apr 23 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"My experience having worked in both places is that runners in the states tend to want to go into production. In London most runners want to be artists and depending on their speciality, they get funnelled through either roto/prep or tracking before moving up to the roles they want. There is much more of a tier structure with many glass ceilings along the way.  My advice to OP: You need a reel to be a runner but it doesn't have to be amazing. If you've got a reel with a fair amount of 3de work on it I'd do your best to get your foot in the door as a tracker. You'll save a year or more of your life."

The runners provide a valuable position and the runners that I have met are great people. They are paid based on their skill, which is usually not that much. They have access to attend all training courses that are presented, have direct access to oscar winning supervisors in their fields and can use all the software, and footage (which is really hard to get) they want in their own time. It's also good gauge to also see their dedication and personality. In that position, you get out what you put in. Considering some of the VFX supes were former runners, something must be working.  If, however they have the skill to be a paint and roto person or a 3d artist, they can just right past the runner position straight in to those roles.  I'm referring to larger companies here.

Hard to describe in text format tbh.  Another technique which I've been trying to figure out is a divide/multiply type key that rhythm and hues used with their comp program ice (?).

vfx,33d609,mafibasheth,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Most modern cameras are built with CMOS censors. I severely miss global shutters, but they both have their strengths/weaknesses. Never over crank your shutter if you can avoid it. The shutter speed should always equal double the framerate (23.97=1/60, ect.) Post jelly reduction is also a bad idea.  The noticeable rolling shutter comes from the camera rapidly shaking back and fourth, due to lack of stability. It is not as noticeable on a camcorder (as you mentioned), because the longer body design eliminates most of the jitter. If you hold a DSLR without a shoulder mount, or something to stabilize the camera, the aforementioned jitter is almost completely unavoidable.  The solution:   Shoot with a wider lens (16-35mm). The tighter your shot is, the more noticeable the rolling shutter will become.   Buy/Build a shoulder mount, or only use a tripod. If you don't have the budget for a quality shoulder mount, you can build one for about $75 with parts from Home Depot. There are plenty of tutorials online.  TL;DR - Read it."

The actual read-out time (which is when the artifacting happens) is generally way shorter than your average exposure, unless you're shooting at unreasonably high shutter speeds, therefore your shutter speed should normally not affect the amount of rolling shutter artifacts in your footage."
vfx,33d609,instantpancake,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:36:35 2015 UTC,"Rolling shutter has to do with how each line of the image is drawn in succession. Raising the shutter speed has no impact on rolling shutter, because it doesn't cause the sensor to record the image faster.  OP, moving the camera more slowly during horizontal moves is probably the best solution. Film DPs the world over have already adopted this technique to account for 24p horizontal shudder."
vfx,33c5rr,sometypeofnerd,2,Tue Apr 21 09:31:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to do ultimately, but if your goal at this stage is to get your feet wet with everything, find out what they use at Ravensborne and start doing some tutorials online. Digital Tutors, FxPhd and the software manufacturer's website are good places to start. Give yourself projects.  In London, most of the big houses use Maya for a majority of the 3d work with Houdini gaining popularity, particularly for fx. Other software is used, but I'd worry about that when you're ready to specialise. Nuke is the only software I'd worry about for compositing.  Editing, I don't really know.

After effects isn't a bad idea either. Neither is Flame or Fusion. I'm not particularly clued up on editing, but I'd take a look at Adobe Premier Pro and/or Apple Final Cut Pro since they seem to be the most frequently used.   Knowing your way around the software in terms of interface and what each feature does with regard to technicality puts you at a massive advantage, leaving you only with the theory to learn.

vfx,33880f,supafitz,3,Mon Apr 20 12:50:01 2015 UTC,"Not really my area of expertise, but...  Usually, yeah. But there are also sometimes way of making the job easier - for example, by being clever with point placement/tracking markers on stairs. Having points in correct places, will make generating geometry of those points easier. (You can build meshes out of tracking points to help give you a guide).  With Nuke, for example, there's a modeler tool designed to aid building 3D geo from a camera track (It's touch and go). Usually, I've just had to get the best track I can and just model from there, working with measurements I've made on set."
vfx,33880f,BlinkingZeroes,3,Mon Apr 20 12:57:18 2015 UTC,It's a mixture of yes and no. Quite a few of the professional reels will have been created using LIDAR or accurately modelled sets (Normally requires the vfx on-set supe to be on the ball with taking measurements)  You can feed this data into the tracking software and it will give scale and depth to the points you've tracked (Especially if there's not a great deal of movement in the shot)  You can then either lineup to that geo in your 3d package or model your own and it helps see if the tracking is sticking or sliding everywhere.
vfx,33880f,rworsl,2,Mon Apr 20 13:22:02 2015 UTC,"My preferred method is to use ModelBuilder in Nuke. I can rough out a basic model quickly, and even projection map, to see how well things are tracking. I'm sure there are faster methods, but that's the one I like."
vfx,33880f,The_Timeraptor,2,Mon Apr 20 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"Coming from a pure amateur, its a ton of fun to do.    I did exactly what youre saying.  Took the matchmoved data and piped it into Maya.  I would try different scenes, different ways to do it, then slap a cube in.  From there, Ide shoot a light probe, then make some tiny object perfectly mix in.    One of my best results was a little short (that I cant find anymore), of a building in lego world getting transported into ours and blowing up.  I modelled the legos (suprisingly tricky to get perfect), rendered the scene.  Then, matched the 4:1:1 compression of the source video on the rendered scene taking special care on each edge of the X axis, subtracted out the noise profile of the source video, composited, then added the noise back in.    I had a foreground object that would 'accidentally' pass in front of the scene once or twice, and I made sure it was an easy situation to key out.  You could even just fake a foreground object and render it.    There was all sorts of other tricks, many of which probably can and cant be done on a real set.  I started each scene with a parallax move by the camera, usually handheld, but sometimes on a tripod.  If it was a tripod shot, I would still do the parallax to establish the scene, then just place it where it would shoot it.    Having something thats obvious and easy to measure in the shot is great to match scale continuity between different shots.  A book or other cubic object can look natural and works pretty well.  Since Im just doing this for fun, I prefer things I dont have to comp out.  If I was doing a reel, I might do it more like on a real set, just to show I can handle all the pieces.    Nowadays games have some cool assets that can be mixed into scenes.  I remember a HS kid took Half Life 2 assets and had them walk around his back yard.  Thats pretty sweet.  You get good models and animations for them right out of the box.  .:. Edit .:. The one Im thinking of was around 2004.  The only reference to something similar I can find was in 2015.  Still shows the general idea."
vfx,33880f,ISvengali,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"Hi supafitz:  It can be as simple as that, but you'll be doing yourself a giant solid to spend some time in setting up the 3d world accurately.  Meaning, rotate, translate, and scale your scene so that the points that resemble positions on a ground plane are on the x & z plane (Maya).  Align walls so that they fall along an x & y plane or a z & y plane.  If this is sounding strange I would look up some basic Maya tutorials to familiarize yourself with the 3d environment.  If you spend time to align your scene to the groundplane, walls on Y, etc., etc., then you can quickly and accurately create groundplanes and buildings - all of the cool geo that will have your checkerboards or whatever you choose to showcase how accurate your tracks are.  Best of luck!  Let me know if you have any questions."

vfx,337un6,usfgeek,2,Mon Apr 20 09:48:45 2015 UTC,"Erft. That's a tricky shot to be looking for a cheap solution to if you want it to look nice.  I'm not really very well versed in Bifrost so I could be wrong, but if you try to do it properly, my feeling is that it would be slow and cumbersome to work with compared to something like realflow or houdini. That isn't to say you cant fake it to make it.  I think your best bet and (definitely the cheapest) is to use billboard particles (an almost universal setting that for particle systems that creates planes facing the camera direction). Set up a system that has them falling off the rigs as they rise that looks comparable at least to water. And use alpha mapped foamy/sea spray looking textures. You could even blend to a more ocean like material by speed / proximity to the ocean if you wanted to get a bit more detailed. You could even add more systems for larger mist/spray and go for a quality by obfuscation kinda thing.  I didn't really want to go into anything more specific as I'm not entirely sure what you want from the end result. But hopefully that's a start?    Good luck, if you have questions, I'll try and help."
vfx,337un6,BWAAMP,2,Mon Apr 20 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand where you're coming from, like I say though quality is going to have to be secondary for this shot since I've got about 2 days to complete this. So there's no real time to be sim anything of decent quality.  What you've suggested though sounds like it just might work.

vfx,330mbx,andrek97127,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:59:22 2015 UTC,This is good information. There's also the option to use a cloud based computing system (like Amazon EC2) to run your own; in my experience this is the cheapest option.  But I can't imagine anyone would run a render farm using Macs unless they really had no choice. Even the software that runs on OSX also runs on other operating systems in most cases. The only thing I can assume he was referring to was using Mac workstations on a farm overnight/when not in use.
vfx,330mbx,CyclopsRock,2,Sat Apr 18 10:41:59 2015 UTC,"The specific use of the word ""cluster"" however means the farm wasn't simply used as individual, disparate render nodes.  It means the ""farm"" was used as a single render node, with shared resources.  They had, for all intents and purposes, created a supercomputer.    I haven't kept up with this in a long time but OSX has had, at least at one time, an advantage in this kind of high performance computing over Linux and Windows didn't even need apply.  Back when they made the 1U rack mount server class Macs.  Being able to cluster with Linux was very complicated and the individual machines had to have very specific, homogenous attributes and it took a high level of IT/CS person to set up.  Clustering in OSX was demonstrated to be easily accomplished with non-homogenous systems by high school students.  At one point one of the most powerful supercomputers in the US was an OSX cluster.  edit: for operations that are highly scalable, cluster computing offers the potential for more performance versus frame-based operations on a farm.  For all intents and purposes it's a local ""cloud"".  The specific definition of ""cloud"" and ""cluster"" represent essentially the same thing to the end user with most of the differences being under the hood.  A cluster would be a tight configuration of machines local to each other whereas a cloud is made up of machines spread across geography.  Historically a cluster required very specific hardware and software configurations for each node but OSX was significant in that it didn't rely on this architecture.  There are all sorts of situations where cluster computing, even if it represented a much smaller overall compute potential, could out perform whatever cloud you cared to throw at the situation.  The pre and post render data footprint doesn't have to be that big before uploading and downloading from the cloud becomes untenable."

vfx,330mbx,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"The downside to building a Mac render farm is cost.  It appears that Apple stopped making the Xserve, rack mount design, in 2011 and stopped making the Mac Mini server in 2014 and the Mac Pro server in 2013, though you can still get the server version of OSX.  So building a farm with current desktop models would be very expensive and take up a lot of space.  You could go Mac Mini, but it's only a dual-core i7 at best at a grand or more per node.  Not good.  OSX running on cheap, non-Apple hardware would be very cool but a Hackintosh cluster or render farm would likely be a tough implementation, I'd expect.  You can totally be using a Mac desktop and offload jobs to a Windows or Linux based render farm, provided you had software that ran on all OS."

I've been unemployed for so long, i often forgot how to do some technique, even the basic one, re-read the manual, tutorial and so on.  I literally forgot how to operate Cinema4D, etc. But i've been planning to make a YouTube series, vfx related, casual thing, not like FreddieW channel (Rocket Jump). Saving money to buy camera, but last week i decided to make with camera phone instead, since it's already 3 years, and i just can't saving money to buy camera, being unemployed in 3rd world country.    My goal was not make money from it, just to keep my spirit up, make a self challenge and keep my skill. If somehow the channel make money, then it's good, if it's not, it's okay, since that wasn't the main goal.    Keep fighting ! Wish you a good luck !    Note : I do have a exit plan (open business in cleaning service, pest control), and well..maybe vfx is not meant to be for me... But i'm gonna do it as a hobby i guess, because i ♥ love vfx soo much ♥"

vfx,32vuwy,kentm,-3,Fri Apr 17 07:56:30 2015 UTC,Looks great but I see at least three awful cliches in this short trailer...
vfx,32vuwy,PixelMagic,3,Fri Apr 17 16:18:54 2015 UTC,It's Star Wars. It's never been original. Just fun.
vfx,32vuwy,kentm,-3,Fri Apr 17 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure, but no.   You apparently have no memory of when the first three came out...  if you base your experience on the last three films (chronologically in Real Time, not in Episode Time) I might agree with you. But the original films were a revelation at the time. Awesome designs and a lot of new ideas.   The trouble with much of the action in these types of films is we've accepted a kind of ""Harlequin Romance"" style of of fun instead of real thrills. They've become kind of like a simple ride film instead of anything more, and we seem happy with that. ""Will batman make that jump out of the underground prison?""...  ""Was Bilbo crushed by the rock giant on the cliff!!?"" ""Will the Millennium Falcon make it out of the narrow passage flythough!!?"" Of fucking course they will. Thats not thrill, thats just glitzy filler, and we accept it as action knowing the whole time that we're really only just impressed with the visuals and nothing more.    The Millennium Falcon flying through the tunnels of a massive space ship trying to escape, to me thats just not really interesting. It was when we first saw it in the first film, but at this point its dull and drab and I'm disappointed it merits inclusion in the effort let alone a key spot in the first release trailer. It doesn't bode well for the level of creativity in the rest of the film. Hope I'm wrong.  EDIT: three people are apparently fine with ""Harlequin Romance"" style fun instead of real thrills"
vfx,32vuwy,jax9999,5,Fri Apr 17 21:55:16 2015 UTC,new ideas?   you know that pretty much everything from the original trilogy was lifted from old pulp hard science fiction space opera right?
vfx,32vuwy,kentm,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"Sure sure sure, and Sergio Leone took cues from samurai films etc etc... but in the original films these inspirations were reworked and re-combined and re-presented in very fresh ways. Everything is inspired by something or somethings else, it's HOW they're combined that's important or interesting. Like Lucas managed to pull off interesting things with the original films in a way that avoided cliches.  This shot that I'm at least discussing here is exactly the opposite of that sort of thing. It's not a reworking, it's not a reinterpretation, it's not ""inspired by"", its at the very MOST a ""homage"" in this context, but really its just another rehashed, slapped in shot/situation we've all seen before in, oh, EVERY other recent sci fi action film.   It's indicating to me that this film was, more than I expected, written by the marketing team."

Every fucking sci fi film has this and frankly I find it dull as shit.  ...Do you think they'll be able to fly though that space? Will they get shot? Will they need to twist sideways to get through? Do you think the millennium Falcon will make it out of that one?...  Of course they'll fucking make it, its the hero of the fucking movie... So for me there's just no tension at all in a sequence like that and I'm surprised that a) any filmmakers still think so and that b) any audience viewers still think so. I HAD hoped we might have left some of the cliches behind with Lucas and moved the series into interesting and new exciting territory, but apparently not. Based on this trailer it looks like more of the same with a cooler delivery and (knowing the director) a bit more coherence than the previous three.  But down vote me.  EDIT: Apparently four audience viewers don't know if the millennium falcon will make it out of the cavern or not. And please use your words like big people, its a discussion."

vfx,32vuwy,o0flatCircle0o,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:38:28 2015 UTC,But seriously if you are having a spaceship fight what can you do to increase tension but fly them into tight spaces. I'd really like to hear your ideas for alternate non cliches.
vfx,32vuwy,kentm,2,Sat Apr 18 03:10:31 2015 UTC,"Look, I didn't complain about the cliche because I wanted to school anyone with my great ideas on how it should have otherwise been done. I wanted to flag the dull cliche for what it was, which it is. And really, at this point the millennium falcon flying into a big industrial space cavern, squeezing (woah, barely) through tight spaces while some faceless villain follows, shooting, is about as cliche as it gets. I can appreciate that maybe the marketing team just wanted to drop something like it in because there was a bit of that in the original, and probably it tested well with some fanboys through a marketing survey. But admit for christs sake that its a tired, tired, cliche at this point. Downvote me to hell if you want but at least admit that...  If you are having a sci fi space battle what else can you do?... Really? Nothing seems possible until someone does it... Lucas did something fantastic originally, which was to source directly from WWII dogfight footage, who had done that before in a sci if film? And it was lovely. But the space ships flying fast through the caverns; dull dull dull. It's not tension, it's simply a video game where you KNOW everybody is going to be just fine. At least admit that...  And that it doesn't bode well for the film in my eyes, that they've chosen to include that particular shot in this first small trailer. That's really all I'm here to say, nothing else. I'm not here to crit the whole idea of the film, I'm not here to attack anybody's dream, other shots seem fine, the tie fighters off the water looked interesting, the opening shot was great, even the way they had the small object in the foreground to draw your attention before the big reveal in the pan: great!

And digital is the way to go on this effect today, because the digital artist can work in negative space where the practical effect can only add mass (the exact opposite of what they're attempting to portray).  That's why Arnold's face looks bloated in the T2 grab.  It's just that nothing is sitting right in the grab from the trailer, looks lit, looks graded, etc.  Hopefully that's really far from final."

Maybe the FX team here just suck, maybe the director said lets do that in post. But if it were me I would want as much in camera look as I could, so i wouldnt have my whole effect left to a crappy fx team when the budget gets cut, bc the studio is afraid it might bomb.  like dirt and blood, cooler tones with shading, and some tracking pixels at least at the spot the skin is torn. the irony here is you point out that its done all digitally to get the inverted area proper, but this looks like an effect copy pasted on arnold face with no consideration for the skeletal contours"

As a vendor you do what you're told or the client goes elsewhere next time (worst case they yank the unfinished work).  Vendors are cogs.  The studios don't want to hear it.  You're labor.

Folks doing exactly the same thing today with exactly the same technique and exactly the same materials don't have film and comparatively soft lenses to rely on.  There's no more magic gauze.  Things simply are what they are when you shoot them digitally using glass engineered for MTF charts.

vfx,32rq9c,kentm,2,Thu Apr 16 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"i actually feel the happy spot will be using all the old practical miniatures/prosthetic mixed with ""new"" (aka.. the past 20 years) CGI techniques. I think it'll take talent returning to the old disciplines to create a balanced force where a combination of techniques ends up making the final shot. You kind of hear rumblings of this happening with Star Wars and Christopher Nolands movies.  We've def gotten to the point where at this point you can do everything in CGI if you want. I remember watching this poor guy replace an entire hand in THOR 2 with a CGI hand for almost no reason. It didn't make that effects shot any cooler to have lighting on his wrist from the spell at the cost of having an obviously cg hand. I think to increase image quality and ""wow"" factor going forward we will have to move back towards integrating ""old school"" techniques with modern CGI.. not because its cheaper or faster, but with audiences desensitized to CGI now, it might be required to give them the suspension of disbelief again."
vfx,32rq9c,kyoseki,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"For this to work, however, ""old school"" techniques have to evolve and improve.  They can't get by anymore leaning on film and glass.  Everything is very clinical now.  If you've never been on a miniature set or around real make up you might not have a frame of reference for how not real it all looks to the naked eye. Film and older lenses gave practical creations their final touch and that's gone.    Witness The Hobbit movies.  Everything looked fake and it's not like they were depending on contestants from Face Off to create their practical effects.  That was, for all intents and purposes, the best money could buy and that wasn't good enough to ground that picture or make you think you were looking at metal and skin instead of painted wood, plaster and rubber."

I instantly blame CGI, but maybe it has more to do with the cameras than I thought. In my head its like ""best image makes in the world should = pretty good images"". WETA didn't drop the ball... something else happened.. im just not sure what it was."
vfx,32rq9c,kentm,3,Thu Apr 16 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"While I don't particularly like the LOTR films, as far as aesthetic goes, they were shot on film.  The Hobbit was shot on Red.  Very digital.  Noise instead of grain, or grainless if processed.  Very modern looking unless you go out of your way to grunge it up.   Thankfully they didn't use something like the latest flat, flavorless Leica lenses, they were shot on Zeiss Master Primes, so they're film era lenses.  Still,  Jackson also shot at 48fps so it was likely shuttered at 1/96, which makes motion look like video.  The frame and shutter speed has all sorts of implications on lighting and perception of motion.     So frame speed + 4K resolution meant that instead of the more dreamlike, non-reality of watching a motion picture your brain was tricked into thinking it was watching something more immediate and real, the same as watching news video.   So in addition to not ""feeling"" like a movie everything looked like what it actually is and not what a designer/craftsman wants you to think it is.  Peter Jackson spent a great deal of money to learn what Doug Trumbull learned decades prior with his failed ShowScan experiment.  All the research on the psychology was done and, as it turns out, people still don't want it.  It doesn't look right, it doesn't feel right and worst of all, for actors, for make up, for set decorators, for scenic painters, for costume designers, for prop makers and for special effects people it is bad news.  There's no place to hide anymore."

There are shitty effects and there are great & invisible effects just like there are great practical effects and shitty cheap practical effects.   These types of threads are just circle jerks for an imagined fantasy of the great old time world of effects that are some how magically better even though they usually simply weren't. Some were pretty good and interesting but most fell really far short of the mark.   It's also ironic the terminator films were chosen as the example because it's a series of films that is famous for using CG effects really effectively.

And that's very valid.  But achieving all of the physical presence of a photographed practical effect has been achievable for some time now and it gets more straightforward all the time."

Maya/Houdini/Nuke/etc all have this problem in some form or another.  The problem is having to make sure you're not breaking anything for the thousands of pipelines out there that mostly rely on your application doing the same over the decades...
vfx,32oqol,NeedsMoreTests,0,Thu Apr 16 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"This is not really true.  Maya should never have gotten to the stage where they waited until muti-threading would given them a 10x speedup.   Getting identical results is also not really a fundamental challenge.    As for nuke, I have written plugins for it and seen it's architecture up close and it was created with multi-threading in mind from the beginning. Have you done a lot of programming for Houdini nuke and Maya, and have you done a lot of multi- threaded programming?"
vfx,32oqol,__Cyber_Dildonics__,3,Thu Apr 16 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"Getting identical results is also not really a fundamental challenge.   I worked for years in major production houses (DD, ILM, R&H, etc) and have yet to see changes like this be introduced without something breaking.  By 'identical results' I mean the results you get in everything from the viewport, playblasts, etc remains the same between versions of the software.  It's easy on a technical level to say it's not a fundamental challenge, and you're right, but 3rd party companies tend not to do very well with not breaking things with changes like this.   Have you done a lot of programming for Houdini nuke and Maya, and have you done a lot of multi- threaded programming?   Yes, on a near daily basis.  When I was still in the industry my focus was mostly on Houdini and Maya however so may info may have been wrong for Nuke.  Houdini, which was my main focus, up until recently had some of the same issues and only implemented multi-threading in some operations.  Maya....has been lagging in this respect for years.  Multi-threaded programming in my opinion is not that difficult by itself but it gets to be a pain when the APIs you use don't really support it internally (yet)."
vfx,32oqol,NeedsMoreTests,0,Thu Apr 16 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well that is interesting.  I still think it is strange for software companies to brag about optimizations that I feel they should have done a long time ago (and would have done given more competition) but maybe that is too harsh.  It seems to me that there would just be chains of transforms that don't depend on each other that could be split into different threads, and vertex transformation should be fairly easily multi-threaded after their transformation matrices are found.  Things like this are no doubt a huge help when working with programs like Maya, it just feels like things that should have been done a long time ago are advertised as breakthroughs when they finally get done (many times because another company shows them up).  I think Houdini's multi-threading is more difficult since there are many different scenarios. Compositing == easy, vops == easy, while simulation I would guess is much trickier, especially since the simulations are built out of atomic nodes exposed to users.  Nuke is heavily multi-threaded in the rendering of nodes, you can implement scanline base operations and it will call different line (and chunks of lines) from different threads, although it is much easier for a compositing system of course."

It was, but it also has a lot of issues thread-scalability-wise, and generally doesn't scale past 10 threads (ignoring the Nuke8+ planer image whole-frame option).  Doing multi-threading on images or renderers is easy (ish, ignoring lazy dependency loading) as each thread is completely self-contained with no dependencies.  Doing multithreading on something like rigging with dependencies between joints and constraints would be really difficult to schedule all the different threads and get full utilisation."

Here are the basic limitations of using the non-commercial versions:    Licenses are not valid for commercial work at home or in a company, or for use in a commercial environment when completing work or in an educational institution. Licenses cannot be used in the same pipeline as commercial versions of NUKE or in clusters of non-commercial licenses. Key feature differences:  Output resolution up to HD (1920 x 1080).

These are the same limits on the normal learning edition then, and for the record, here is what they say they are:   The Non-commercial licenses of the NUKE range restrict the amount of nodes that can be retrieved at a time by scripting. Functions such as ""nuke.allNodes()"" in Python will return only the first 10 nodes available rather than all of them at once, and scripts written to iterate through the node graph will not be able to retrieve any more nodes beyond a set point. The commercial NUKE range can retrieve any and all nodes at any time as the command names would suggest.   Just FYI, the python limitations actually end up pretty far beyond that. You can't create any more than 10 nodes via python either.  All in all, it still makes it useless for OOS developers who want to help the community from home."

vfx,32kenh,ScreamingPenguin,2,Thu Apr 16 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"The h264 limitation is about licensing.  The Foundry has to pay for tech like Ultimatte, Primatte, MPEG, etc.  This fee is passed along when you buy the software.  If you aren't buying the software they would have to pay out every time someone downloads their free version, that doesn't make much sense if you are the Foundry.  It's slower to comp with MP4 material anyway, transcode into EXR's or some other image sequence first."
vfx,32kenh,BurnetRhoades,2,Fri Apr 17 02:20:53 2015 UTC,"There are all sorts of free applications that use H.264 so I buy that for the keying tools, not for this.  1080P H.264 can be processed realtime in Adobe products.  I can do realtime physically based stock emulation with Film Convert on H.264 material, on a Core 2 Duo.  To be fair, Nuke wasn't designed to deal with stream media and The Foundry's implementation added on isn't very good is a big part of that problem.  But, generally, before I process H.264 I convert it to ProRes with 5DtoRGB (because its chroma filtering of 4:2:0 sources is better than Adobe's).  And that piece of software not only didn't cost me anything but it reads H.264 while writing ProRes on a Windows system even if you don't have Miraizon's codecs.   Getsomeofthat!  Transcoding H.264 to EXR or any full-bandwidth image sequence is horribly inefficient."
vfx,32kenh,ScreamingPenguin,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"There are many free apps that do H.264 great.  The thing here is that we don't know what The Foundry uses and they may have chosen to license a third party or whatever to do their decoder that they have agreed to pay with each license sold.  My response was a simple explanation to your WTF question posted earlier.  Regardless of why it isn't in there, there are plenty of easy workarounds for transcoding and getting your content into the free version of Nuke.  If you like a ProRes workflow that's nice, I like an image sequence based workflow and EXR's are pretty nice to work with for our pipeline.  To each their own!

I want to take my 8-bit H.264 video and transcode it to a 16-bit lossless image sequence, why is that so horribly inefficient?  Less efficient, maybe, but it works, it is reliable, and for the pipeline I work with it's great.  I like 1 scanline Zip compression EXR image sequences, they aren't too big, they are lossless, they work really well when using a Region of Interest, and my current setup has enough IO to handle it.  Transcoding H.264 footage to EXR's because I already have a competent EXR pipeline for post is a purpose based workflow.  My post pipeline was built to accommodate several streams of CG EXR passes.  Image sequences are also reliable and after a few bad .mov's in the past I would rather take the extra precaution of sticking with what I know will work and not worry about it."

All I know is you hate my video to EXR image sequence workflow enough to argue with me about it.  Your only real point is about I/O, which is valid and a potential bottleneck but it works for me and my setup.  Honestly your idea to transcode to prores (again) is a great way to go for most incoming video: It's fast, light, and gets around the bad stuff working in H.264.

vfx,32nphq,jdblaneg,3,Wed Apr 15 08:37:19 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the colors of the concrete, and reflect on how color and light works in the real world. Light bounces off the concrete and back onto objects, so you'll need to emulate this look with your favorite color correction tools. This color will be most apparent in the shadowed side of your objects, since the lit side will be overwhelmed by sunlight.  This will, of course, depend on the material of your objects. Are they soft? Hard? Do they have a textured surface? It looks like you've already made shadows for the ground; try to match these with other shadows in the scene to give them the same ambient lighting. Daytime shadows are rarely dark enough to be black. Next thing I'd look at is focus. Match the focal plane of your shot by using the in-camera focus distance or a compound blur effect. These three things should get you close.  There are third party plugins that will do these things somewhat automatically, but you should already have everything you need in After Effect."
vfx,32nphq,thx3000,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:57:33 2015 UTC,You can retexture the 3D geometry with black and white checker patterns and color correct based on that. Then replace with your original textures with your desired textures.

Look at the high contrast light and shadow on the plants and the person. Notice how you don't see anything like that on your objects?"
vfx,32ly5s,grumpyimp,2,Tue Apr 14 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"I would become very hard for an other artist to take over your shot when you renamed all the familiar names to other things. For example: you want to blur the eyes of the character in your shot and you use a 'Blur' node for that. You rename the blur node from the default 'Blur1' to something like 'eyes_softer'.  When I browse through your comp, I just see an orange colored node, however, I have no idea what kind of filter node it is; it could be a Blur, defocus, zdefocus, erode, soften etc.  If would be better to store any relevant information about your node in the label of the node (the line of text under that appears under the name), rather than renaming it.  Besides that, most changes to a shot are done using multiple nodes, rather than one node. Therefore it makes more sense to 'name' a group of nodes. You can create a backdrop (solid colored square) that covers a group of nodes and give it a description."

After applying the blur to my comp, I may never need to think about it again, so why bother naming it? Not to mention that sometimes I may decide the blur was unnecessary, in which case any time spent naming it would have been wasted.

Pretty much 99% of the large studios I've worked for over the years [disney/ilm/dreamworks/etc] used HP. I'm guessing it's because they support enterprise linux in a production environment which is important if you don't want to waste money and time troubleshooting stuff and you need something turn key.  I used to build my own workstations, but now I run a Z820 and a Zbook at home. I did upgrade ram on my own but everything else came from the factory.  The support is decent, you can get a contract where replacement hardware is delivered same day or next day.  If you roll your own, you're on your own for support and if you have different vendors they'll point fingers at each other when something goes wrong. Ever try to replace a motherboard with ASUS? It stinks.  I've heard good things about Boxx as well.  Since you were asking about brands I'm guessing you are avoiding Apple/OSX."

Prior to OpenGL you had multiple ""standards"" that application designers had to contend with for accelerated 3D displays.    ATI offers far more physics processing per $ and it's more specialized renderers right now that are coming up, unfortunately, Cuda-specific.  Da Vinci is accelerated on ATI.  Adobe on ATI.  The GPU accelerated solvers in Houdini are OpenCL, so, ATI.  What's crazy is those hippies developing Cycles for Blender hitched their wagon to the closed standard of Cuda yet they've still not produced a version that reads and writes Alembic files (/facepalm).  Also, Nvidia cards are hot as hell and consume a lot of power.  They couldn't make the Mac Pro with dual Nvidia GPUs with the current configuration.  They'd have to add loads more extra cooling and turn it into a larger, louder machine that consumed more power.  The choice of Nvidia would blow the elegance."

If you are using the machine to make money, buy a pre built machine for the task with a support contract. You need something 100% reliable and turn key right out of the box. And something where the machine is replaced immediately [same day] if there's money involved.  The machine is used to make money for you. Last time I checked in this business, the workstation is nowhere near the cost of putting someone behind it.  The money you save rolling your own machine is going to be blown out the window if you have to wait 1-2 weeks for ASUS to replace/RMA a motherboard that has a blown capacitor.

That's two machines that might potentially have to be tore down, to keep continuity of storage, software, etc.  Odds are the key is based on the ""fingerprint"" of your borked machine and not the replacement though so, I'm sorry, but paying up front or monthly for a service contract doesn't guarantee any less downtime than if you were to simply replace a component for cash.  Again, in a facility situation this isn't an issue because usually you're using software that's floating license.  Most single seats are node locked.

If you have a tracked camera from pftrack, syntheyes, ae, etc etc you can get it to fill the scree properly and parent it to the camera. if it's locked off then no need for it.  Honestly 3dsmax just really isn't built for that kind of shot. Cinema4d has made leaps and bounds with r16 but i'm not here to sell you something. Try using geometry as a background and/or reducing the size of the animation (it'll suck trying to match movement in with sd sized footage but at least you'll be able to see it in over 10fps)  My best guess as a workflow wouldn't be to try and go full force with a digital double but first define a ground plane. make an aproximate sized cylinder and first just get the basic x/z movement. From there you can parent new geometry to the cylinder and animate limbs and a head. since they're going to be hit by fire and smoke let that be your helper in obscuring lower poly geometry since it's really only going to be there as a collider for phxfd to interact with. I know it's not much but I hope it helps. One thing I've had some success with (on rare ocassion) is a reverse matchmove.  I mask out what I'm trying to recreate (your people in this case (individually)) and use AE's 3d camera tracker to track them. this gives me a camera which has tracked only their movement. The one thing to keep in mind if this works is that you'll need to use wind/turbulence to mimic movement since your geometry will technically be still while the camera is moving."

Firstly and most importantly ""Divide and conquer"" say it with me ""Divide and conquer"" Never try to roto something with one single mask. If it's a person make a mask for the left arm, right arm, left leg (etc. etc.) and your workflow will speed up and be much more accurate.  No matter what you do there is absolutely no easy or fast solution to proper roto. (well, there is... but there isn't... I'll explain that...) Once again divide and conquer, portions with motion blur need their own mask so that you can control feathering. Secondly,  color correction is your friend, namely Hue/Saturation. let's say you've got a building you've just roto'd and there is a small blue light wrap on it (everything has light wrap, remember this it's important) throw hue/sat on it and select the blue channel, you can then selectively and exclusively desaturate, change the hue and lighten/darken tones. More on light wrap, grab an animation preset on the web for those roto'd layers like this one | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugr4ASb8NFg  |  to utilize the layer behind it to give it a natural looking light wrap which will literally save your composite. I've gotten away with shitty roto jobs by simply using a light wrap to cover up my ugly mask. Now to tackle the image you posted. For a scene like this a holdout matte would be your best bet. http://i58.tinypic.com/2zrq7mb.jpg To make this image I simply toggled through the RGB channels to find which had the best contrast of arms to stage.  The red channel had a nice white stage and dark grey arms. I added levels to it to crush the blacks and blow out the whites and voila. Now the image I posted isn't great because it's super lo-res and the white outlines are from your mocha masks but this is the gist of it. In AE, duplicate your layer, create a garbage mask ( to get rid of everything but the part your trying to roto) then add the shift channels effect. play around with it but for this shot change all channels to red. throw on levels until you get a good looking black/white matte.  Now you can use that as a luma inverted matte and POOF! no more stage, leaving you with just the bits that stick out above the stage and cutting out quite a large portion of the roto.  Final thoughts: There are literally 200 ways to do any single thing in after effects and the only way to know them is Practice, Experimentation, and honestly... being given really shitty footage.

vfx,32fwmq,vfxer1099,0,Tue Apr 14 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"hello here the result: silhouette keying: the true is really bad, use keylight or primate key in AE much more better silhouette roto: dun have auto track for the geom, too much type hard to chose and control track point very slow overview: have to set sesson, color type, res....bla bla bla... before start the roto. Timeline and keyframe hard to look and control. that just a feeling after 15min use this software, and its make me feel i dont want to use this anymore"
vfx,32fwmq,Bizlitistical,4,Thu Apr 16 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"Please tell me that's a typo and that you're not only getting $12/day to do rotoscoping.   i tried so hard, spend 2 day like 25 hours nonstop to do that....and i just finished 1 of 6 shot OMG my bone....my eyes...so pain, im just 26 year old, but im feeling old   Yeah, a shitty shot can do that to you. Welcome to the terrible job of rotoscoping!  One tip that I learned when rotoscoping a lot of shitty shots was that we didn't always have to trace around everything if we could use other effects to create an effective matte. We'd use whatever effects we could to turn it into a simple black and white scene and then use that as the matte.  If you're trying to put something behind those hands there and in front of the light blue cylinder, then there's great contrast between the arms and the light blue and you might be able to exaggerate that using levels, curves, or other colour effects in something like After Effects. You might still have to do the hands or do some manual cleanup but it can be helpful sometimes.  Hope that helps."
vfx,32fwmq,had3l,0,Mon Apr 13 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"yeah, sometime using keying in AE helped me alot, less roto than, but for now, i tried to use some cc change but the result not really good but many thank ps: no there is no thing wrong with my typo: 12$/day, im leaving in S!@%HI&T(#!@# country...VietNam"

vfx,32b12a,PixelMagic,5,Sun Apr 12 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"The basic technique is blackpoint/whitepoint matching using a grade node (or levels effect in AE). Beyond that, it is matching colors, either by adjusting by eye or by matching black/grey/white in each channel of RGB. Or you can just use MatchGrade in Nuke ;-)  I think every tutorial series that has a section on color correction touches on this. The Foundry publishes a great series of tutorials for free online. Here's the one for color correction in Nuke: https://vimeo.com/76514569 . Anyone have suggestions for After Effects? I know Mark Christiansen has a new series on Lynda.com, but I'm not familiar with the CC section.   As for physical books, you still can't beat ""The Art and Science of Digital Compositing"" by Ron Brinkmann for the basic theory and implementation. The color correction chapter in ""Nuke 101"" by Ron Ganbar is also a great resource, with more specific steps in the software."

vfx,32b12a,petersid7,3,Sun Apr 12 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Just general theory. I've been doing it for years based on RGB channel matching, but I wondered if any other tutorials had tips. Sometimes even if you think you know alot about a subject you can always find little nuggets of new information in certain tuts.    For instance I've been enjoying your keying tutorial immensely even though I've been keying for years."

I think the big thing is to remember that all cg elements should match what would be happening though the practical lens.  So color, DOF, Distortion, atmosphere, etc all really help it sink in."

vfx,3285if,havesomedownvotes,3,Sat Apr 11 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Beautiful, what did you do/use to get the blood and the explosion? Original footage, stock, CG?"
vfx,3285if,Mr401blunts,2,Sat Apr 11 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"Of the exploding guy? A mix of elements & plate combination.  They filmed a dude on set reacting, and then they filmed s separate plate of a dummy exploding. Both were combined, but the blood asset looked awful, so I added a mix of detfilms & action essentials to enhance the blood. The explosion was mostly from plate B."
vfx,3285if,had3l,3,Sat Apr 11 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"Some cool stuff there! I like the 00:37 balcony shot a lot, that CG train on 0:49 looks very real (although it's missing ground reflections) and the shot with the paintings at 1:03 is really well done. Now some critiques and observations:  Shot 1: It feels like there a bit of a white halo around the head of the woman on the right, and there definitely is a white line around the suit of the FG man, and their edges are too hard for something motion blurred, feels like you just added lightwrap to them, when they pass in front of the light post you have a feeling of what their edge should actually be like. There is too much repetition in the BG, you can clearly see those crowds look exactly the same.  Airplane shot: The shadows of the airplane are too dark compared to everything else in the shot and the belly is too dark. The whites feel odd compared to the white of the helicopter on the right, feels like it should be slightly colder.  Stabbing shot: The blood bellow the knife isn't tracking to his jacket properly, it slides as he falls.  Tanker shot with yellow smoke: Feels like the edges are dancing and eroded. The smoke feels blurred and weird and too saturated.  Last shot: There is no parallax in the graves as the camera pulls up,   looks like a flat card."
vfx,3285if,Wesleye,3,Sat Apr 11 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"Agree whole heartedly. I appreciate the feedback. Rather than going into defence mode on comments like some people tend to do on Reddit, I will take some time to look at these with your feedback in mind. I always appreciate another set of eyes to look at this kind of stuff, and it's always hard to ask people who I work with since for the majority of the time, they're looking at it the same way I am.  Much appreciated!"
vfx,3285if,phunkaeg,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"You said almost everything I wanted to say haha. Really love the train and balkoney shots! I would like to add two things though;  In the first shot I would have loved to see some more parallax in the four pillars on the statue. I also have the feeling that the whole embankment it is floating a tiny bit.  Had3l has some good feedback on the airplane shot, I feel that the shadows need to have a bit of a gradient towards the north of the shot, just like the rest of them. A bit of reflection and a bit of a highlight on the plane would help it merge into the scene as well."
vfx,3285if,pixel_fcker,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:14:29 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  Nice reel!  Though the Plane shot does stand out to me as not matching the grade of that area of the screen. Looks like you've matched a black point from right right hand side. However on the left side, with the dirty window glass brightening everything up you could almost take you black level queue from the man's shirt as he walks down the stairs."
vfx,3285if,pixel_fcker,3,Thu Apr 16 10:48:38 2015 UTC,Nice reel! I really wouldn't open with that first shot though - you've got some seriously gnarly edges around a lot of the FG element.
vfx,3285if,petersid7,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"Lol yes gnarly edges. I know the problem you're talking about. Will be re-working it for the next iteration. Also, bushes in front of green screen...No idea who decided that one.   The main problem I have here is I work mostly in TV, so for 99% of the shots I get, I have less than 2 days to turn them around, so there are a lot of corners being cut to achieve that. Fortunately, I'm moving on to feature work in the coming month, so my 2016 reel will likely have more polished work on it."

vfx,3285if,dguerrero57,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:21:32 2015 UTC,"Hey man... Nice stuff.   Here are my thoughts...   Your reel could be a little shorter.  1:30 is about the max I like to see.  If you look at yours, you aren't showing much of your best work after that time point.  Are you a compositor or a roto artist?  If you are trying to book comp jobs, are there shots on your reel that you just roto'd on?  If so, take them off, or clearly mark them.  You might want to think about creating a comp reel and a roto reel, and sending the appropriate one out when applying for jobs.  Otherwise pretty nice stuff... Keep up the good work."
vfx,3285if,MyCommentIsNo,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:39:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yes looking to cut it down. Will be updating it in about 3 weeks with some much better shots. I just cant use them yet because they haven;t yet gone to air.   Thanks for the feedback!

vfx,3273cl,yoloswag12337,2,Sat Apr 11 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"Light Wrap, Light Wrap, Light Wrap... lol, most everyone said it already but that's you're absolute number one friend in selling a comp. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugr4ASb8NFg Here is an animation preset you can run to sample the layer behind to create a light wrap if you need it. http://i.imgur.com/NEexgGh.jpg Starting with the main source of light (3 lines top right) the flare you have says that the main light is coming from offscreen and to the right so the shadows shouldn't be dead on. They should follow the angle of the stick figure on the ground.  It's not perfect but the left side of her body has a slight light wrap on it (best I could do in photoshop without taking the time to mask it out) which helps blend it. The light is also being bounced from the clouds below so there should be light on the interior left wall, It's been exaggerated in the pic but that's basically what you'd need just with a softer edge. The tiles on  the floor need highlights, the shadow shows depth but they don't fit look like they belong in the scene because there is no highlight. Finally the FUI panel just needs to be lightened to see detail. Always think about where light is bouncing. Even though the light outside is about 3-5 stops brighter it's still gonna get reflected (even off matte surfaces) and will light up the scene. throw a 20% opaque black layer behind the screen so that the blown out BG doesn't blow out the text. That's all I got.... That said though.... This looks great, you're well on your way to having an incredible piece just always remember to think of where your light is, what it's hitting, and how it's bouncing off of that. also lose the yellow flare at the top left. The scene is heavy on the right and the contrast draws you towards the character but the flare evens it out too much and it's easy for someones eye to be drawn to the left instead of at what you're trying to draw attention to. Ok, now i'm done. actually wait I just saw pilmey's post he's right get the horizon on a third and the stern on one as well. I personally like the pink. I love the orange/blue contrast but honestly it's everywhere. seriously go to walmart and look at dvd colors and try to count how many have an warm cool cover like that. The color pallet looks great to me it just needs more depth with highlights, light wrap, and bounced light."

vfx,3273cl,phijie,2,Tue Apr 14 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"Friday night vfx critique, woo! Looks pretty cool as is, but the flares don't make much sense, and that ground would have to be incredibly diffuse and black to not be brightened considerably by that bright bit of sky, so try making it shinier (brighter spec/refl). That control panel thing on the right is super awkward, at the very least light wrap it, or darken the bg behind it so you can see it's image, or if you can, move it or reframe the shot. If that bg is blooming the environment that much, i'd expect it to light wrap inside the room in a big soft way."
vfx,3273cl,pilmeny,2,Sat Apr 11 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"Color palette seems a little bit messy. Warm grey, purplish grey, pink, orange, blue. I'd go simpler on it. Try to tie the FG and BG colorwise.  Light on character doesn't match the position of the light source, and neither do shadows. With all the symmetry, probably your best bet is to put the sun directly behind or above the character, instead of reworking all the rest.  Only when all of the above is working, I'd go for the little comping details:  Blacks on the rectangular thingies on the right are too deep.   Orange flare seems too sharp and unjustified.   The SING A letters are confusing.  Edges, lightwrap etc  What are the flying streaky things? Why are they converging on a different point than the rest of the lines?"

I have never seen a color in a screen where I  didn't see why black (with a few markers) would be better."

vfx,320z1j,startled_goat,3,Sat Apr 11 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"There is a bit of debate as to what the tracking marker should be, but very little debate about green/blue vs black.  The reason being that if the screen in black, then all practical reflections can be saved, where as if a color is in there, they are lost.  For me, its a white or orange small round sticker on top of the black (and turned off) screen.  Most of the time the smaller the better (think like the size of a pencil eraser) unless it is out of focus.  Tracking makers need to grow in size the further from camera or the more out of focus.    That being said... I meant what I said.. I think its awesome you took the time to do this!   If I had some footage of phones with black screen and another of the same thing with green, I'd gladly though together some tutorials on how do phones and screens the best way."

Not sure if you can do anything about that though.  The most useful one seems to be ""green subtle"", all the other ones are a bit too obtrusive IMO, you want to be able to keep reflections, key and track.  I would also have wanted ""original green plus"" but without the giant corner trackers. I'm thinking scenarios where you have a close-up on the phone and some fingers going in front of it. Subtle variations of green usually gets the job done. It would be cool to have a few different options for the contrast of the two greens."

vfx,321s7f,iCo975,3,Thu Apr 9 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a fellow student, the way I've always heard it is that game design is a constantly evolving field.  Studying it always seemed like more of a ""soft science"" field and wouldn't get you a job in the actually industry.  Studying vfx is a good AND MARKETABLE skill that will actually get you a job.  It might not actually be in the game design field, but currently the entire industry is rather volatile in the AAA sense and much more self starter.  So find a few more students that want to make games and just start. Make small games and work on your work.  Basically, it is much more prudent to have a degree that will get you a job and keep you paid and alive while you pursue your game design goals. If you major and get a degree in game design and can't find a job, who else would hire someone with a game design degree when there are plenty who have degrees in Computer Science, Graphic Design, or others.  Ultimately though, if you want to work on games you have to make a name for yourself and build a portfolio. Many people that rose to become a Creative Director or something else got there by probably being a great developer or artist. You could also crosspost to /r/gamedev to get a better idea on the degree, since I've only met one person that got a degree in game design.  Source: Graphic Design major with minor in Computer Science and a certificate in animation and motion graphics.  Started a small Game Design company with a friend and a backer, and now we are full time employed by ourselves doing little mobile games and contract work while we get better at our chosen skills.  TL:DR Listen to that professor and be prudent with your future. Ultimately if you have good work and can build a good portfolio, that will get you much farther than a degree."
vfx,321s7f,Speilman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think getting a game design degree probably wouldn't be the best idea.  Focusing on something more marketable like VFX would serve me better.  I also have the option of minoring in game design.  And yeah, the degree doesn't matter.  What really matters are your skills."
vfx,321s7f,the-real-klockworks,3,Fri Apr 10 00:43:58 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a grad of SCAD, in my graduating class I think the stats for % of students with a job in industry within a year was something like 92% for the vfx program... And something below 50% for game design.  The problem with the game design major, in my opinion, is you don't get a good foundation for any part of game development that there are actually jobs for. If you want to go into visdev for games, illustration is better, if you want to code for games you should be getting a compsci degree from a different college, if you want to do lighting/look for games you should be in vfx. Being an effects artist in games is not something you can learn from SCAD as most of the effects are painted textures on sprites. Animator for games? Animation degree. If you want to design encounters for games or interactive systems, good luck, SCAD churns out hundreds of grads for maybe 5-10 jobs per AAA game.  My point is no matter what the game dev teachers tell you keep in mind how many students you are competing against for a (very) broad subject major. I know more vfx graduates in games than I do game design students, especially ones actually making games and not being in a managerial position like say a producer."

vfx,321s7f,the-real-klockworks,2,Fri Apr 10 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"VFX is Visual Effects. Basically any Special Effect done on the computer.  Specific to the SCAD VFX degree you have subpaths you can go down: lighting, look, effects, compositing, vfx supervision, scripting/pipeline, matte painting and a few others. So lighting is just like what it sounds, look is the textures/how it reacts to the light, compositing is taking rendered images and getting it to sit on the plate correctly(color correction, roto, etc), effects are any natural or magical phenomena, vfx supervision is being the on-set liason to the vfx crew to make sure things are shot/recorded properly, pipeline is basically the backend of a companies workflow and ensuring data flows correctly/easily from dept to dept, and matte painting is set extension.  There are intro classes you take Sophomore year that give a better overview and take you through all the steps(besides matte painting and pipeline) of a ""vfx pipeline"". You can apply generally all of the knowledge you learn to any of the ""film and television"" industry as well as parts of the game industry.  At the end of the day you have to find the path you most enjoy and focus all your time into it. Then learn to love spending close to 100 hours a week on your projects."

It's actually something that wouldn't happen to a large extent with a modern car because turbulence adversely effects gas mileage.    It's more like something that would happen with a large truck or bus going by due to the broad, flat surfaces being brute-force shoved through the air, smacking it out of the way.

You ever been walking down the street and a car passes you and you get that big wind after the car passes you? I think at the speed those cars are moving it would amplify the effect to the point where a camera on a tripod would move a bit.   The direction that the cars are moving I think it would make the camera dip forward/ down a bit, and then come back slightly before settling to its original position each time a car passed. I just don't know how to simulate that with keyframes. I tried my theory out but it looked off."

Only above-the-line guilds have any weight with the studios.  Trade unions are useless in the face of a global market.  Vendors are just widget line items to these people.  edit: LOL at the upvotes and down votes here.  Tell me, smart guys, exactly what did the camera, carpenter and electrician unions, to name a few, do, what could they do, to prevent so much runaway television production  from leaving Los Angeles, California, and the US in the early 1990s?  Exactly what did the DGA, WGA and SAG do to protect the interests of the craft and trade unions during this period?  Were you working in VFX in the early '90s?     Exactly what was the camera, electrical, carpenter and other trade unions able to do about commercial production when it left the US in the late 1990s/early 2000s?  Exactly what did the DGA, WGA and SAG do to protect the interests of the craft and trade unions and other below-the-line folk whose livelihood was wrecked?  Were you even working in VFX in the late 1990s?  In case you were a toddler or still in school I'll tell you: nothing.  They did nothing because there's nothing they could do.  Just like there was nothing they could do to stop runaway feature production over this same period.  Not a goddamn thing and the above-the-line guilds did nothing that wasn't in their own interests.     Also during this period IATSE did exactly nothing to keep the US animation industry from being decimated and virtually everything you see on television and home video from going to Canada, Korea, etc.  There was nothing they could do, but I remember something else.  Back in the 1990s they didn't want us.  We weren't welcome.  So when they tried to organize SPImageworks I enthusiastically checked the ""no"" box, and watched their initiative take a resounding defeat of 50:1 or more against, because they brought exactly nothing to the table except a thirst for dues.  David Duchovny, one actor, had the power to move X-Files production back to the US from Canada in the original series and dictate a ridiculously short ""season"" for the upcoming continuation.  That's the difference between being above-the-line and below-the-line, one of many.  edit2: and I'm not anti-union per se, just the useless ones.  Unions facing off against municipalities have power.  Unions at the wheel of jobs effecting scores of people beyond their specific role (ie. trucking) can effect nearly every person in this country if they decide groceries and mail and goods aren't going to move.  Powerful above-the-line guilds can make the corporate movie machine goliath blink and shut down Hollywood to get their way.  But below-the-line trade unions are gnats with no leverage or power to do anything but yell into a typhoon expecting it to change course."

Until the strike [around Tron] where there was a walkout to protest sending work overseas and to Canada for animation work [mostly television].  The strike ended up going nowhere, the Disney workers broke ranks and returned to work and the producers won. Ever since then TAG has been sitting at the little kids table when it comes to IATSE."

The benefits at SPI weren't as good as R+H, which had the best in N.America, but they offered the best pay.

You are proud of your work, and you want to show it off, and we like watching it too, so you don't need to be (or pretend to be) modest about it.

It really depends, and a little gold guy can help you get up there.  Most CG sups will be right behind at around 130-150K. Artists are going to be all over the place.  Anywhere from 50k - 150K.  Seems like alot until you realize there are very few places in North America that you can earn like this and live cheaply.    For instance a 1 br in West LA is going to start at $1500 a month and go up.  Vancouver and NY are probably more. 2 br apartments to buy are going to be around 500K...  The most important thing to know is this The way to make money in this industry is to get a higher rate and do good work.  NOT to work more hours.  The hours come regardless of how good you are.  For some reason recuiters have convinced everyone to take lower rates because all the overtime will make up for it... BULLSHIT.     Lastly...

vfx,31r5tl,petersid7,4,Tue Apr 7 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"VFX Supervisors were generally in the range of $200K+ back in the 1990s, in Los Angeles.  Northern Cali has historically been lower paying across the board and Canada seems to be on par with Northern Cali when you do the conversion from Canadian Dollars to US.  Vancouver or Montreal offers are going to generally be about 70% of a comparable LA rate after all withholding.  LA isn't cheap, but price and value changes drastically depending on what part of the city you're living in.  Higher weekly rates means you can find a good place for no more than one week's take home if you're a senior artist.  Meanwhile, I know artists working in N.Cali who pay a comparable week's take home living with multiple roommates, because a $2K apartment in LA might be a $4500-6K apartment in San Francisco, if you live in the city.  edit: full disclosure, I'm not advocating Los Angeles living, I moved out in 2009, just illustrating the difference."
vfx,31r5tl,BurnetRhoades,5,Tue Apr 7 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"Work outside the US doesn't pay as well as work (used to) in the US.  This is part of the reason why it's moved to countries that do not protect workers from being exploited.    It's quite possible to have a six-figure income and live paycheck to paycheck, because it's not uncommon for these non-US hubs of production to be in the absolute most expensive part of that region to live, so you commute in or spend a large portion of your pay for the privilege of living in a rental in one of these cities and paying three times as much for a beer.

vfx,31r5tl,BurnetRhoades,4,Tue Apr 7 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"From a friend of mine:  IF you're making good money, you're eventually lonely and on the road a lot. You're rushing behind big studio projects in different cities mulitple times a year, only staying for the project, then going on. Finding a SO who follows and can, financially, do the same, is hard.  I'm in a full time motion and interface designer in an agency, having an above average income and can't complain, however I'll never be part of a superstar worldwide production, I'm afraid."
vfx,31r5tl,Tsupaero,3,Tue Apr 7 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in LA right now and it's a pretty difficult scene at the moment if you are trying to break into VFX here.  The majority of feature film vfx work has left the country.  The few job postings that do come up seem to be very hard to come by since there are a lot of out of work senior artists going after them.  There is still some vfx work in the commercial world here in Los Angeles.  A lot of the commercial shops will pay freelance vfx or motion graphics artist maybe around $350 to $500 per day (maybe more).  But you are getting paid as an independent contractor (which is illegal on the part of the commercial shops) and they generally pay you a flat day rate no matter how many hours you do.  Also, you might only get brought on for a couple days or a couple weeks and then when the project ends you're out of work for however long it takes for the next job to pick you up.  Since you're an independent contractor, you may not be able to file for unemployment benefits.  In LA you're looking at a minimum rent of $1,200 for a 1 bedroom apt. plus you'll need a car.  So, my opinion is it's pretty tough.  If you are a really great designer, motion graphics / Cinema 4D artist, then there might be some steady(ish) commercial work to be had in LA, but I think traditional vfx artist work is very hard to make a career of in LA at the moment."

At my first studio I came in at a rate that was 40% higher than their initial offer, and I negotiated a 10-12% raise every year. After you build up your reel and contacts, you can start talking to some of the larger studios looking for a lead or sup position.  I think FX has been more insulated from the wage depression from outsourcing because it's a very specialized field, but it is definitely still possible to make a good living in the VFX industry."

Did you work with the authors or is it a paper you just ran across and found interesting?  At one point they say, ""The bitmask size should be at least 8x8(64 bits) to adequately capture high-frequency details like fur and hair.""  Which makes sense.  But they don't mention how they came up with the 8x8 number.  I am assuming it was just a bit of trial and error until it looked nice on the scenes they were testing with?  Or that was just sort of a nice round number?  It seems like the subpixel mask would need to scale somewhat with how feature size compared to pixel size.  Anyhow, thanks for posting.

vfx,31o7um,vrayisbestray,10,Mon Apr 6 21:09:39 2015 UTC,You're lucky they are paying you hourly.  Keeping that and getting that and OT will help a lot.  Out of school I think $18-$25 an hour is reasonable but it depends on the software you are using.  After Effects is a little cheaper than Nuke.
vfx,31o7um,kohrtoons,8,Mon Apr 6 21:35:21 2015 UTC,"The reason VFX companies love to hire people out of school after being an intern is so they can pay you shit. This is what you need to do, take the job at whatever they offer, work there on a few projects then take a new job at a new company. This is a freelance industry. Use the work you did to make a good reel and then spend the next year jumping from company to company, each time raise your rate by a couple dollars an hour. A lot of intern hires will make the mistake of spending years at their first Vfx job working for terrible pay. Don't do it."
vfx,31o7um,o0flatCircle0o,3,Tue Apr 7 08:34:53 2015 UTC,it varies a lot. Check out glassdoor.com to give yourself a good idea.
vfx,31o7um,David-J,2,Mon Apr 6 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"$15-25/hr, depending on what software you're using, how your speed and quality compare to your more seasoned peers, and how good you are at asking questions only once.  I started at $15/hr doing nine hour days as a PA. This is probably comparable to your intern days. I had about $15K worth of college loans to pay down on that, which wasn't bad. I found a place in a decent part of town with low rent and good room mates. That project ended, and I was less expensive than the Keurig machine, so they kept me around but cut me to 8 hours. When we got another project and I began compositing, I negotiated a bump up to $18.  In the years since (though it actually hasn't been that long), I've moved up the ladder. Last time I was doing the hiring, I brought After Effects newbies onboard for $17-20. This came with the expectation that they'd need more attention and help than veterans, and would cost the company a certain amount in that regard.   6-12 months from now, when newer people than you appear and they're thanking you for helping them and answering their questions, that's a good time to ask for a performance review and negotiate a raise. If you weren't making $25 before then, this is the point at which you probably should be.   After that, it's all about experience and what skills you bring to the team and periodically changing companies so your rate can match your growing resume/reel."

vfx,31ov81,DoctorOctagone,4,Tue Apr 7 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"Syntheyes for camera matchmoving. Also, if you work on a 3D Stereo film, it is great for figuring out how far apart the stereo cameras are too. The only thing I don't recommend Syntheyes for is object tracking. The best object tracking software I have used is PFTrack. If you have a shot that requires both Camera and Object tracking, I parent the PFTrack Data to the moving Syntheyes camera in Maya to mix the 2 together. It will only work if you have the exact same lens data typed into both programs."

vfx,31ov81,sambosambo,2,Tue Apr 7 06:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think Syntheyes is probably your best option.  It has a very quick learning curve, it's fast, and very robust.    Mocha Pro is great for some things.    PFtrack is awesome and full of some very powerful tech but it's slower for most tracks in comparison to Syntheyes, it does have a few tricks that I have found are unique to PFtrack that make solving some very difficult shots easier.    Boujou seems kinda dead, maybe I am wrong but I haven't seen much noise from them lately.    You left 3Dequalizer off of your list, it is a serious no BS matchmove solution.  From my limited use of both Syntheyes and 3Dequalizer I would say that 3DE is faster for most things and I really like it's simple interface and the way it integrates into higher end pipelines, probably overkill for a small shop but it would be the tool to learn if you want to be a matchmover."

vfx,31l8nn,Theponcho,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"Which renderer? I think mental ray doesn't support uv tile tokens, so you need to load each image tile and in the image clip node offset the uv to the corresponding one subtracting the tile number to the default number.   If your tile is u1v0 you have to subtract 1 to the default value in the u range.  Edit: and in softimage you can't visualize tiles in the viewport BTW"
vfx,31kfm0,Nukes2all,6,Sun Apr 5 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing that's throwing me off is the lighting. I can't tell if ambient occlusion is being used or not, but if not it needs to be on, if yes then setting need to be tweaked.  Try to match the lighting to the scene, more specifically the color and intensity.  The tracking for the most part is almost perfect, while not totally on point, I know the skill it takes to get it that refined and I think you did a great job with the overall video! These are the only things I can point out, having not used a 3d software outside of 3d element in forever. Keep up the good work!"

I'm just using my student license to test stuff out. The track, while perfect in software, for some reason came out sort of lagged and twitchy. I mean, to be honest I don't even know how to apply materials.  Long story short, while I do know what Ambient Occlusion is, I have no idea how to apply it. I know how to place lights, but I always seem to mess it up to the point of the program crashing."
vfx,31kfm0,DrGrumples,2,Mon Apr 6 02:58:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's been my online alias for everything since I started high school ~9 years ago. My thought process was I wanted to sound classy, but lovable.  You'll get there. I started with Blender, then I got a student license for Maya. I haven't used 3ds Max much, but I think Maya was a little more friendly with materials and rendering imo. I still mess around with it occasionally but it's been forever and I really need to brush up my memory so I don't forget it all. Actually poly-modeling and materials were my favorite part of 3d. I couldn't get a hang of curves and Nurbs, but materials and rendering definitely took the cake. I would make the most basic shapes and make them look amazing with the tender process. With ambient occlusion, I think you had to turn that on in render settings, but I would definitely use it in your video, because the shadows are lighter it would match the scene better."
vfx,31kfm0,Notorious-G-R-eeK,3,Mon Apr 6 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"Tracking first. you should mount some more markers that extend a little off of you head. like the length of a toothpick or less and add a ball to the end. look up the colored rubber stuff sugru. it should give more parallax to track with in bouju. youll still need to smooth out the tracking data as mentioned. also mentioned was getting the correct camera data for bouju. not just the focal length but also the camera back.  I don't know max at all but im certain there is an environment light. use a high dynamic range image in there. and better yet if you can figure out how make an hdri of your environment (your office). that will get you 70% of the way to matching lighting.  the model itself needs to be cleaned up... it appears that there is some pinching of verts that is leading to normals issues (the brim of the visor, and under the visor worst offenders). it will give you uneven shading/lighting information.  also when testing lighting scenarios try using a shade of grey instead of the blue/teal youre using now. 18% grey is what is normally used in photography. you can try 50% too.   if youre new to visual effects. just be proud that you got this far. there is a ton of tutorials online. just keep producing effects and just try to learn one thing at a time."
vfx,31kfm0,puppymeat,2,Mon Apr 6 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Have you matched the focal length of the 3ds camera to one similar to the camera you're composting compositing to?

vfx,31kfm0,E6H,2,Mon Apr 6 04:34:22 2015 UTC,"Make sure the virtual camera is using the same lens as the real one! Also, very very slightly smooth out the track, just by an extra frame or two."
vfx,31kfm0,phunkaeg,2,Mon Apr 6 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"I agree about the framerate difference. Check that your frame rates in Boujou, 3dsmax and After Effects are the same.  if you want it to match your scene better you'll need to do a lighting setup within 3dsmax.  Looks like the lighting setup of your footage is fairly ambient, but with a soft front light.  I've only ever used Vray for lighting within 3dsmax, but you should search for Mental Ray or iRay lighting tutorials to get that softly lit effect.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFqmTns8FqU  Your mesh looks like it has some dodgey polygons in it which is messing up the smoothing. You may want to look into that.  Next I'd work on the shaders. Rule of thumb for photorealism is that every object picks up reflections on their glancing angles. In 3dsmax you can use a ""falloff"" map in the reflection slot and make the falloff type Fresnel. Then you'll need something to reflect. If I had your background footage, I'll grab a frame of that into photoshop and just fudge together a spherical reflection texture to add to the reflection map. Using a frame from your background footage, cutting, pasting and heal brushing will keep the palette matching your footage which will add realism. When rendering, you may notice that your blacks are too black and your highlights to blown out and saturated. You can work and render better if you adopt a Linear Workflow. http://www.3dtotal.com/index_tutorial_detailed.php?id=1552#.VSNJXVWqpBc This will help give you a more natural look to your renders. And gives you more control to tweak it in after effects. Oh,  yes. In after effects add a Pixel Motion Blur effect to your render layer to give some nice motion blur which always helps.  Hope that helps a bit.  Actually, just for fun, I had a go at using your scene to create a realistic helmet material. Obviously without the camera tracking though. [http://imgur.com/w7rMYJ6]"

vfx,31kfm0,kirrkirr,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"Couple of things here will make a world of difference,  Someone already said smooth out the track, but I think beyond that, it feels like you're rendering at a different framerate than what your footage is, as well as possibly a different resolution.  Also adding some motion blur will help, but if you want to match it properly, you're going to need to simulate your actual lens as close as possible.  This means you're going to need to figure out your focal length, aspect ratio, and shutter speed to begin with.  With those things dialed in I'd think you might have a more integrated feel to start from."

vfx,31i8ni,dtgeah,1 point,Sun Apr 5 09:19:47 2015 UTC,"Rolling shutter will be your biggest problem using any DSLR.  If you know how to deal with rolling shutter or you only have nice smooth slow shots you will be fine.  A Black Magic 4K camera is really great for matchmoving, it has a CCD and a global shutter so no rolling shutter skew.  You can shoot distortion plates and figure out a pretty close angle of view for your lenses as well.  You may not want to buy one but you can rent them, a speedbooster and some canon lenses (if you don't already have any) for a pretty good price if you only need it for a few days."
vfx,31i8ni,ScreamingPenguin,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:16:34 2015 UTC,A good track comes down to a few things:  1.)  No compression articacts  2.)  Good light/contrast  3.)  As little motion blur as possible.  4 and most important:) Good data about lens distortion  The Canon 700D will do a decent job on its own and a much better job if you record RAW with Magic Lantern.  Keep good notes about the lens you use and be sure to film a grid for building a lens distortion profile and you should be able to get excellent results with that camera.
vfx,31i8ni,i_start_fires,3,Sun Apr 5 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"""No rolling shutter"" should be on the top of that list, but it depends a lot on how it's shot of course. Handheld will shake more than you'd think, and create a lot of temporal errors in the image. Some sort of make-shift stabilization helps a bit, such as attaching the camera to a folded up tripod for weight and act as a ""keel.""  Motion blur and lens distortion isn't as problematic in itself, and can be counter-acted if you prepare a bit, that's the sort of thing that isn't up to you anyway, it's for the DOP to decide, whereas rolling shutter is an undesirable artifact for everyone."
vfx,31i8ni,glintsCollide,2,Sun Apr 5 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah and to be honest, the rolling shutter in a DSLR alone is so bad that there really isn't any point in going through the hassle of a raw workflow just to practice tracking.  Edit: As in: it will not really save you from the actual problems you'll be facing due to the rolling shutter alone - the image degradation due to crappy default codec is absolutely negligible in comparison to the massive wobble caused by the shutter, in terms of trackability."

Now we don't have to fake as much.  Pixar is basically playing catch up in this regard.  VFX companies that no longer wanted to fake what PRman didn't do switched to a different renderer years prior to this film and the update to PRman.

They also used the path-tracing mode of the ""raytrace"" hider in PRMan 18. And they used Physically-based (so energy conserving, with plausible albedos) shading for material response.  However, other companies (ILM, MPC, DNeg, Weta) have had fully-raytraced (ILM still use shadowmaps a bit) solutions in PRMan since at least 2011, by writing all the light integration in the shaders themselves, so in a sense, Pixar themselves were quite behind-the-times with the change.

I had an incredibly thick book that came with v5, it was the size of The Art & Science of Digital Compositing or the VES Handbook... but all Fusion. With v6 they went to a sparsely documented and infrequently updated online manual. I got by because I worked with a former product manager who was always very helpful :)"

The only thing that comes to mind is if any of the optical stablizations bring small motion blur into the footage which would make your track points less clear, but it really shouldn't be a problem.  I've tracked with optically stabilized lenses in PFTrack, AE and MochaAE (for planar tracking) and haven't had issues."
vfx,314o0u,bradfilm,0,Thu Apr 2 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"Well it has to affect the optical system somehow: The sensor is moving around in space with the camera shake, yet the image is stable. The solve does not have any parameter for that kind of shifting."
vfx,314o0u,Greystoke1337,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's an element in the lense that is moving, not the sensor. Unless you are shooting with a pentax DSLR which has a moving sensor. I tracked footage from my own pentax, and it was fine. Won't be pixel perfect, but fine for web diffusion.  I'd assume that tracking an optically stabilized footage would be fine, worst case as /u/bradfilm said, a bit of weird motion blur caused by the offset of the lens element. Maybe a bit a moving distortion if you are shooting with a very wide or very long lense."

vfx,314o0u,Greystoke1337,0,Thu Apr 2 06:52:33 2015 UTC,"No, I meant that the sensor is moving in space as the camera moves/shakes/vibrates. This has to affect the image: if the camera (and its sensor inside it, too) is at position XYZ in one frame, and a quarter of an inch further Y in the next frame, but the stabilizer in the lens somehow counteracts this shift in perspective, how does the solver deal with that?"
vfx,314o0u,spart1cle,1 point,Thu Apr 2 09:44:52 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. The solver should be fine with that. I think that you going to have trouble with rolling shutter before you hit issues with the stabilization anyway. I wouldn't worry too much about it.   I track with 3Dequalizer, so I can't speak for the other softwares out there, but I can't see why that would get you an untrackable footage. At the end of the line, everything is trackable, just takes more time."
vfx,314o0u,vfxlogic,0,Thu Apr 2 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're probably right, the advantage in reduced rolling shutter jitter from reduced vibration probably outweighs possible inaccuracies caused by the stabilizer."
vfx,314o0u,BurnetRhoades,2,Thu Apr 2 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"The principal point and center of distortion will be moving around because of the stabilization, and this could adversely affect tracking performance in software that assumes fixed or centered locations for those parameters."
vfx,314o0u,Helicobster,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Any ideas on whether one could possibly assess distortion per frame, on the fly, so to speak, and correct for this?

vfx,314o0u,Helicobster,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"It would only make it harder to track if it warped/distorted your image, but I don't think they do that. Or if they did, it wouldn't be so severe to throw off your tracking software."

Rate calculated for 2013 – 2014 graduates based upon ACICS formula, http://acics.org/accreditation/content.aspx?id=5712.   the big thing is they would consider a Janitor working at Disney World 'employed in the industry', just be careful when schools say that.    a lot of the work is moving to Vancouver and Montreal industry entry is becoming harder and harder if you have the will power and time to learn, self-teaching VFX supplemented with something like Digital Tutors and Attending Professional conferences will be cheaper then school.  Most 1-2 year intensive programs tend to make you pay more for networking with people and having an environment that makes working easier ( dim, quiet, tech supported rooms)   Bottomline, Dave's School is going to cost you, just for the course, 33k plus housing, plus utilities, and living expenses. You may even need a new computer. You will go to school and work hard and produce a reel for your work and then but industry ready. Now to find a job, if you are looking to work in feature films...well us Americans (and Immigrants in the US) are SOL. The industry has made a strong move away from the states because they can save  ALOT of money. If you can get a job somewhere I promise it is enjoyable work and you have fun at work, I figured I would give you that little piece of info ( that I am sure is not on Dave's Website )  As well....I am not saying you should go to Vancouver Film School or something like that I am just asking you to understand that going to school in Florida to move to Canada to make a 'eh' wage may cause problems, i would just hate to see someone get themselves into financial trouble before even getting to enjoy the job."

They will legitimately teach you how to work in the effects pipeline, and they have a lot of successful placement, but there are plenty of folks that just leave with a lot of debt. Industries like Film, TV, and VFX are tough. You pretty much have to love doing it, because there aren't a whole lot of other incentives. You work long hours for not great pay starting out, and you have to hustle for gigs until people really know who you are. Those who make it and make a good living are a small percentage of the folks that go in. As my film teacher once put it, if you want to make money go work in marketing. And as paxsonsa says, a lot of the work is going overseas and rates are dropping. Point is, they're a solid school, but there are no guarantees that they will get you a decent paying job once you graduate but you will definitely have a nice chunk of debt. Caveat emptor."

You'll get the education fast(one year) it's small classes, great resources and now they use up to date programs. I was taught Fusion and lightwave, both which were pretty useless. They'll offer AE and let you choose which you like better, but make sure you do everything in Nuke you can. At $30k it's a little pricey, but it's still less than vfx schools. There's plenty of work in the US. Especially in NYC right now and LA is coming back because Canada is starting to lower their tax breaks and the exchange rate is not in their favor anymore. Mike is great at placing people, but you'll probably end up at a roto house if you don't really try hard to get on LinkedIn and use the Dave school network yourself. I like the one year formula cause you're out in the work force quickly and that's what you want. It won't be as in depth as a four year school like SVA or Scad, but you'll learn enough in your first year working to off set all of that. And trust me, you want to get in fast in this industry. It's becoming more flooded every year and every level positions are harder to find. If you're willing to network like it's your job, you shouldn't have an issue finding a job.

You need to have a detailed shotlist, storyboards and script before you can talk to VFX. budgeting a show is based on a shot by shot bases, so it's impossible to give you anything before that.   You'll also need a on set VFX supervisor, day rates depend on who you go with, but on average I would say it's around $500 for the (very) low, and scales accordingly as you go up in experience. Again this is a day rate, so even if they are there for an hour, this is how much it costs. The better the Sup, the better the finished shot.   Many aspects of visual effects are considered pre-production, so that means before you make your final  production schedule, you need to consult with your VFX sup to make sure he has enough time for each effects shot to get the on set data necessary for his artists.   I believe your getting downvoted because you have none of these things."
vfx,30ysr9,nate_wane,5,Tue Mar 31 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"^ What he said.  I downvoted because, as a VFX artist/supervisor of 8 years, Ive heard this at least 30,000 times.. Everybody has their ""next big short that Im going to want to be a part of"". I can assure you if you are looking for money via kickstarter, etc. Then you most certainly dont have the funds to acquire ""very nicely done"" (yet?), meaning its not even worth my time to have a conversation about what youre looking for. I would suggest doing some networking (in real life. not reddit) before you waste all of your money shooting a film you cant afford quality VFX for to support it. Find people near you who can do what you cant, and hopefully your ""short"" is compelling enough to convince them to want to work with you. If you cant give a number of how much you are willing to put aside in your budget for VFX then go find some student with AE and a video copilot blood package. Just to give you a very rough ballpark estimate (since you obviously don't even know where to start), based off of the limited information you gave, I wouldn't touch this project for any less than $10,000."
vfx,30ysr9,ksquared5,4,Tue Mar 31 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"yes to 100% of what he said. But I might replace that ""1"" with a ""2"" before anyone would touch it."
vfx,30ysr9,nate_wane,2,Tue Mar 31 21:47:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for your suggestions. I really do appreciate them. This will help me alot. We have the script done and start story boarding tommorrow. Do you guys have any suggestions on the story boarding? How advanced should they be?
vfx,30ysr9,TurtleOnCinderblock,4,Tue Mar 31 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"As much as possible, especially for the VFX shots. After you are done with the board you may want to put together an animated storyboard / previz to get a sense of the length of your shots and pacing, which will help the VFX supervisor. But get a detailed storyboard first and as the posters before said: this will cost money."
vfx,30ysr9,proddy,2,Wed Apr 1 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yes! I'm still a student, but our teacher has volunteered our class to help a few film students out with their major project.   It was obvious they didn't have any VFX experience at all. Most of their ""short"" (almost 20 mins long) is very VFX and green screen heavy.   If they had a VFX Supervisor, or even a student, on site, it would've made all their shots 10000x easier.   Now we're all sitting here doing pretty much full body roto's on half of the green screen shots because of wrinkles, screen flapping in the wind, transparency, body parts sticking out of the green, props being a similar colour to the screen. Not only that, but tracking because the camera tripod wasn't completely locked off.  The wrinkles, transparency and wind rippling could've all been solved by using something hard and opaque to hold the screen against. A student would've pointed out body parts sticking out, uneven lighting, useful track points or considerations.   If this were a paid gig, we would have 20 vfx people working 6-10 hours a day for 4 weeks. Minimum wage ($18/h) that would be $57,600 (avg 8 hrs/day). That's just labor. No rent, no equipment, utilities, etc.   Most of that is roto, which could've been solved by having a VFX Supe/Student on site during filming. Probably cut the time (and cost) by 2/3rds.   Just getting the grid from the camera they shot on was an ordeal.   On the bright side every roto job after this will seem like a piece of cake."

""Body part dismemberment, blood, cuts, slashes, stabbings..."" are all fairly easy to do with practical effects, makeup and prosthetics. If you have a limited budget it could likely yield a more effective result. I was recently at a short film event, and the director of a VFX-heavy short mentioned he made it as a student and queried several VFX shops until he found one that was willing to take it on pro bono and allow their employees to work on it during their downtime. If you find the right shop that views this as a possible award-winning short, or an audition for further work (if your feature funding is successful) they may be willing to do it for a discount."

Several of the other commenters are correct that this kind of thing is asked of the industry all the time. If everyone took on ""the next great short"" for little or no charge the entire industry would be going bankrupt even faster than it already is.  The director that I mentioned was a student, which may be the reason he was able to score such a deal. And his short obviously had merit, because it was included in a relatively prestigious festival.  Still, if the right shop found merit in your idea...stranger things have happened."

The reason its using realtime raytracing is because the black hole is being represented by non-euclidean geometry (defined as a perfect mathematical entity rather than a mesh-based object) to retain visual quality while staying relatively simple and easy on the GPU.    A GLSL supported renderer is in the works for Blender, the free and open source all-in-one 3d studio.  However, for the moment you are probably better off attempting to convert it to OSL (Open Shading Language) to be run in the Raytracer of your choice (the Cycles renderer for blender has full support for this).

So start with your reds, then blues then greens etc.. Once you have matched value only, you can then start sampling color. The main rule to think about is think about, key light, fill light and ambient light.  Learn to look at your color graphs and read the curves so you know where your limits are on a per channel basis. Contrast is also almost always an issue.  Hope this helps !"

I have to through various stages return DNxHDs movies back with all the burn in and naming convention back for approvals. These slot in to the edit. Final deliverables are the 5k log Dpx back the DI house will down rez as they wish, unless specifically asked for. One of my final stages is to take final DPX and original DPX and do a difference on them and crank the gain up to make sure the frame is black except where I comped something in. Otherwise Houston we have a problem. That's my workflow, and if I need to place image planes in maya which will not handle DPX, i make tif sequence and if it needs to be in a reflection pass I will make the TifSequence a greater bit depth than the 10bit originals. I think you might use the difference trick on incoming approval movies to make sure they conform to the ref movies you sent. You will catch if any comp vendors are not conforming to your necessary receivables. My two cents."

Then the plates are converted to 2k 16-bit linear exr to begin shot work.  I have yet to work on a movie that isn't 2k.

Internal standardization is then either DPX or EXR (I've seen more of EXR than DPX though, since renderers go through that as well). Output heavily depends on the client though. Sometimes it's JPEG2000 DCP, sometimes 25Mbps mpeg, sometimes quicktime animation (uncompressed), Prores 422HQ, DNxHD185, EXRs.. I've seen it all. Client previews are usually h264 mp4s before color work and smaller res prores/dnxhd files after color (h264 mp4s have a nasty tendency to color everything into green-ish.)."

Maya is actually surprisingly picky about its image plane formats (DPXs are right out, and TIFFs may or may not work properly). Short of IFF (which a lot of applications, including Nuke, can't write), JPEG is actually the format Maya plays best with.

You can't judge or dial in...anything, before passing your element to a compositor.  And when you're not working with real plates you have no idea whether your element actually works or not.

vfx,30sfh6,hexdream,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"Like I said, blender has grown.in the last few years. I have not used after effects myself, but from what I have seen they do the same basic job. Blender is a 3D animation program, true. It also does video editing, compositing, motion tracking (for sfm / camera solving/ tracking),/colour grading/correction etc. Compositing is done via its node based editor. Most of these have improved significantly since 2010 when tears of steel was released. The power comes from its tight integration of components and script ability.  Having video editing, compositing, physics simulation, and 3D animation tightly connected has its advantages.   Sorry about my poor typing. Doing this on a cell phone."

For the better shots it could be a highly subdivided curve defining the edge of the effect sampling a camera-projected UV texture that gets streaked along whatever surface you build.  Or perhaps particles doing the same thing.  This surface or volume could then be shaded, self-occlude, etc."

Having said that you will find certain purpose built machines using mac or windows depending on what software they run and who uses it.   I've seen a lot of HP Z machines around, what you really need depends on whether you are 2D or 3D. If you mainly use nuke what you need is RAM, lots and lots of RAM and the faster the better, this will also help for general editing packages and after effects as you can cache more video without performance issues.  If you are a 3D artist what you really want is a nice graphics card and a CPU that gan multi thread, when it comes to rendering CG it's cores cores cores. There has been a trend recently for 3D packages to rely more on GPU power for viewport rendering, but exactly which card to get is a complex issue and depends on what software you will use most, I'd go on the autodesk website and see if they have any proper benchmarks done on various cards before I bought one.

In my experience, Windows is great in your own little world, but sucks for large deployments (10-1000 computers) - your IT department will use Linux for that. And OSX is for when you need to use Final Cut or any other specific program.  Win7pro64 IMO, is a sweet spot of usability and customisability - in the 3 years with my current laptop, it's failed me exactly zero times, and I've used and abused it plenty. I pin this down to great hardware and not being stupid by not installing stupid things on it.

vfx,30i7eq,schlimmschlimm,3,Sat Mar 28 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"a transistor for the dimming...? Isn't a transistor either on or off?   No, a transistor is a simple amplifier, really.  They have 3 legs.  I'll simplify terminology here, because there's a lot of types of transistors, with a lot of different terms, but you have a power input, a power output, and a control gate.  Think of the gate as a multiplying factor between 0 and 1.  Make it 0, the output is 0.  Input a 1, you get the full output.  This is how it's used in digital electronics, yes, but at it's core, it's still perfectly capable of being used anywhere inbetween the two, and getting a predictable output at a certain ratio.  Some are linear, some have more root-shaped curves, but they're (almost) all capable of analog control.     The way I understand that is that he uses the potentiometer to read an analog value and then PWM the LEDs - a simple transistor can't PWM without a microcontroller, or can it?   Well, no, you can't PWM, because that's very much digital control, and requires quite a bit of logic.  But you can use the pot to control the voltage (FET type transistors) or current (BJT type transistors) to the control gate pin, and the output will scale accordingly.  Edit, but even then you can PWM with a $.50 555 timer chip, instead of a $25 microcontroller."

The battery life depends a lot on whether you have the Quadro enabled or not. With it, about 2-3 hours of good work. The embedded intel gfx card works with all the apps, but it's sluggish sometimes, but the Quadro is nice and snappy. You can set apps to use one or the other by default, and also ""Run with Quadro"" or ""Run with Embedded"" right-click on shortcuts - this is great when you want to conserve your battery, are not doing anything big and quickly want to view/test something.

He didn't want to build it with fly-away walls to enhance the claustrophobia.  I just find curious is all.  The film so many will try to compare this to is 2001.  In fact the non-chroma way of shooting the miniatures is straight out of the technique used by Con Pederson and Doug Trumbull in 2001.  For films entirely originating in 35mm Trumbull would shoot all visual effects in 65mm and this is one of the reasons why his work is so much better than that of ILM, who shot VV.

vfx,30fijy,usfgeek,4,Thu Mar 26 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"Looks like a dead easy planar track.  Mocha Pro can output to Nuke, I believe, but if not you could copy-paste the AfterEffects camera channels from Mocha For AE to a text file and likely build a Nuke camera with this, if The Foundry hasn't removed the ability to read ASCII files for channels.  I've created a tracked camera in Houdini this way."
vfx,30fijy,BurnetRhoades,3,Fri Mar 27 01:09:35 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does it look like the shot is distorting as the camera moves around? That would make it really hard to get a useable track…
vfx,30fijy,losangelesvideoguy,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did notice this too, it's especially noticeable when I'm centered on a track. Would it be safe to say that smartphones record footage in a way that is just not convenient for tracking?  What i want to do is extend the big building upwards using 3D geo, and obviously that would need to match the distortion on the plate. I'm assuming the distortion from a smartphone is different from a normal lens distortion you find say on a 5D."
vfx,30fijy,proddy,2,Fri Mar 27 10:36:35 2015 UTC,Every model of camera has a different distortion.   Take a picture of a grid with your smart phone and undistort it before tracking.   Try a planar tracker since there is no parallax.

vfx,30fijy,BurnetRhoades,0,Fri Mar 27 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  AE fails to solve most shots i've recorded on a smartphone, my clips have the same distortion during movement."
vfx,30fijy,PixelMagic,2,Fri Mar 27 05:14:38 2015 UTC,"If you're using the AE solvers that may be part of the problem but a bigger issue with smartphone footage is noise.  Handheld devices don't have quality lenses, aren't sensitive to light and produce highly compressed files.  All of these together equals noise, which is as tough or tougher on a solver than distortion.  AE has never had good tracking though, until they started bundling Mocha."
vfx,30fijy,instantpancake,2,Sat Mar 28 18:46:22 2015 UTC,"Well you can't get a 3D solve on this because there is no parallax as you said. If you want to do a simple nodal track, that should be no problem.  I tracked this shot as nodal, even though it was hand held.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9xGmxqRZ0E  That was tracked in Syntheyes, but I imagine Nuke would have a similar nodal tracking tool."

As the others said, the rocket launcher needs some work, I'd try to rough up the edges along the bottom or something in order to make it look like some grass blades are obscuring it.  Also, I'd suggest you soften the edges along the bottoms of the ghost necks.  The current edges look kind of artificial.  The UFO was pretty sweet though.  EDIT:  On second look it appears that you did try to bring some of the blades of grass in front of it, but only on the foreground ""bracer""(or whatever you call that), but didn't do that on the tires or the one in the back.  Also, the rocket engines should be disturbing the grass behind them as they launch.  You probably could have benefited by having someone on set using an air compressor to achieve this look."
vfx,30cnlt,karma2048,12,Thu Mar 26 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"don't take this the wrong way but if you are looking for job stability, you are looking in the wrong industry. all film vfx work is contract based - mostly project based. a company can have work lined up for a few years at most ( in the case of the big players ), and as such, guarantee you a longer contract, and even a 'permanent' position, but end of the day, this is an unstable field by its very nature. we work in show biz, not in a bank. like you have noticed, people in technical fields have a longer shelf life at companies than most artist positions....but it doesn't make them invulnerable to business environment fluctuations. I'm not saying this to detract from you getting into the field, but you should be aware, that job stability in vfx is very, VERY, relative. having said this I have heard of FX artists getting 'permanent' positions in Vancouver studios or people getting 2+ year contracts in Singapore, but these are exceptions not the rule. Personally, I have never had longer than 1 year contracts in the whole of my working life, even if I have stayed at some companies for 2 years + ( consecutive 1 year contracts )."

vfx,30cnlt,de-sine,6,Sat Mar 28 00:52:42 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a rigger/animator who switched to an FX role over the past decade, it doesn't really matter the position you are in, you will be facing long hours in today's environment.  Client changes usually pushes animation approval to the last possible second which snowballs hours on all the other departments past animation.  Rigging doesn't get away Scott free either, since riggers typically have to wear the creature FX/Hair/Fur/Cloth cap as well, and that means you are building/maintaining assets and doing shot work which also means long hours. Why FX instead of rigging? I work the same hours and get paid 30% more, plus its easier to get FX/Lighting/Comp work. There is only so many rigging/creature slots on a production vs the other departments.   The only place I had a sensible work life balance was DWA. That place was legit 9-5 for years with about 2 weeks of OT in the years I was there. The worst as ILM which is balls to the wall OT. Great for making money but you'll never see daylight. The problem with DWA is that ship is partially sunk .. lets hope Home does well this weekend for our industrys sake.  As for a permanent position, it doesn't really matter, you can be let go just as easy vs a contract. At least as a contractor you have more protections [I have gotten laid off early on projects before and had to have my contract brought out as a lump sum. If I was ""staff"" I wouldn't have gotten anything].  I found pipeline at an established studio to have the most sane hours unless you are a wrangler.  Remember the margins in this industry are nothing. A successful VFX company typically has 0-5% margin*. That's pretty horrible. Most are a few months away from closing if they don't keep landing future work.  *- Unless said company has a profit participation deal with IP.  That being said 9am-6pm is doable but it really depends on when you join a production.  As the guy said above, it's show business, it is the one of the worst industries for stability. If you jump in, hope that your wife won't kill you. ;)"

The BC subsidies will stick around until BC hits a budget deficit. Then you'll see some interesting things happen.

vfx,30ajb6,LazyCon,3,Wed Mar 25 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know why everybody is talking about getting the reflections in-camera.  I would try to avoid getting reflections in any GS shots and add them in in post whenever possible.  A lot of the big league shows deliberately get rid of certain reflective items from greenscreen shots and add them in digitally.  IIRC in Avatar, they added all of the gas mask faceplates in post.  I mean, since you're already faking the reflection in post anyway, which requires mostly the same kind of work, why not just do the whole reflective item in post?  It would save you the trouble of having to match the in-camera item anyway."
vfx,30ajb6,Sloore,2,Thu Mar 26 23:45:02 2015 UTC,"To clarify: I understand THIS shot has a cgi Daredevil in the reflection - but how would you normally capture floor reflections? I am imagining a glossy green floor would tint the reflection too much, and a huge mirrored floor would be… too weird."
vfx,30ajb6,veystass,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"You can remove the green tint from reflections, people pull mattes for reflections all the time. And if the main character is CG, then the reflection is also faked alongside the character."
vfx,30ajb6,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there were quite a few shots like this in the ""Shatterdome"" (Pacific Rim).  Pretty much if your main greenscreen is good your reflections should be more or less like keying a ""bad"" or less than optimal screen.   The mistake a lot of new artists make when seeing a shot like this is assuming a single key is going to be sufficient.   Even for non-reflective shots it's often necessary to combine mattes from multiple keys tuned for specific areas and specific features you want to retain."
vfx,30ajb6,petersid7,2,Thu Mar 26 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"Its very rare that you would want to do a reflection, more often you need to fake a shadow.    However if you know ahead of time, you could plan accordingly. Like, glass or mirrors. Often time 2 cameras are used to get different angles."
vfx,30ajb6,Wtkeith,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"I've always just used large panes of glass.  I've never had to do a floor, but I've done a wall and a table.

All of the other buildings and roads were most likely cg. They had to animate the dare devil reflection to match the actor. Because most the buildings are cg, it would be relatively easy to get reflections from those."

My guess is that they might have used puppet warp (or something similar) to simulate the original actor's gait on the top half of the reflection. To me it looks like the reflection's arms don't match the movement of the original and don't feel quite natural. Notice how his walking stick doesn't have a reflection/shadow?"

If I were suping this shot, I'd have had them shoot a reflection plate sometime after the initial actor was shot.  Play the original plate back and get the guy in the costume to watch the playback and match the timing.  I'd have also used marks on the floor for both the original actor and the guy in the costume.  If they time their footsteps right, their gaits should match up quite closely.  Take the ""reflection plate"" flip it around and distort it to give it some texture.  Then any slippage can be accounted for by spline or grid warping the reflection, and that could be hidden with a combination of bluring, darkening, and the fact that the reflection is already supposed to be ""warpy.""  Bob's your uncle, and you've got yourself a proper reflection.  It'd be a hell of a lot easier than making a complete digital double.  Also, considering how the edges on some parts of these plates look a bit wonky, I wouldn't want to trust doing a digital double to whoever did the VFX on this."

And also the way the taxi door reflects light onto the wall when it's opened/closed (car and building on the left) looks pretty real, as in ""that's so random, they probably wouldn't have put it in there on purpose, hadn't it actually happened on the scene."""
vfx,30ajb6,dotJack,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"The reflection here may or may not be a CG Daredevil but usually you would have a shiny surface on the ground and just add in grime later to cover parts of it out - it's even done here, you can see that the bits that are reflective change over time and don't correctly pan along with the scene.

I'm not familiar with After Effects or Premier, but here's what I would do with what I know:  In Softimage:    use the render tree to do one of the video's composite drive the text with an animated attribute script the attribute to read a text file.  put all the titles/previous/whatever info in this text file run your script to make all the images   In Maya:   Similar to XSI, but no render tree, so do the compositing in the scene with actual planes. Note you must use an expression with setattr to change string attributes. Super filthy but it works. Or generate one file, save as .ma, generate your other .ma files by search/replacing the contents of that file with python, batch render them all.   In Python:   use pillow or some other image editing module to pull in the bg frames, comp the text, and write them out. Then batch run this script.   In Nuke:   same as Maya, either script the nodes directly in the flow with Python, or save out the .nk file and search/replace it using python, then render those files."

vfx,305sr2,PixelMagic,3,Wed Mar 25 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"One thing I know is that architects mostly indicate sizes in millimetres ( in Europe anyway ).  Either way, prepare to start using real world measurements and modelling from blueprints.  But besides that it might actually be an easy job comparing to motion graphics or other more complicated stuff in advertising since a lot of architecture uses flat surfaces and its mostly stills and no animation.  What I do is export different elements in different render passes with alpha channels, and combine everything in photoshop where I can do a lot of beautifying work afterwards ( Like adding glow, or 'hdr' type effects. Also you can fix some mistakes in this part, make sure to render to a raw format like openEXR or something similar. ) In this stage you can pretty often get away with placing in flat trees and people, if you apply some of the same techniques used to composite in people in motion graphics it should look very good relative to other architecture visualisations.   If you take a good look at pieces in this gallery- Cgsociety/architecture - you might see where other designers use 3D modelling/rendering and photoshop to create a complete image. Some designers also post some work in progress where you can see what their models look like without shading/post processing - http://aminph.cgsociety.org/art/rainy-street-architecture-3d-1234900  And maybe you can read yourself in on a lot of terms via wikipedia on architecture and architectural drawings.  After a weekend of reading and a week of practice ( take a random building from your town, or find some blueprints online and model/render the shit out that thing ) and you should be good to go.  Assuming you have prior knowledge and experience in vfx.  Edit: Oh and make sure to have patience and let your computer render for longer times on higher resolutions than your used to with hd, low noise and more pixels can make editing in photoshop a lot easier. ( Architects like to see their work in high resolution anyway, and you can assume they might use it on billboards near the building site or in brochures to sell the building to potential buyers/renters. )"
vfx,305sr2,iciPiracy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 08:41:32 2015 UTC,"Just to add a bit to what u/iciPiracy said. I did the opposite, I started with archviz.  I know some average vfx guys that had absolutely no problem getting into archviz, but I also know some incredibly talented vfx guys that just can't figure out the blueprints. Blueprints are the single most difficult thing you'll have to face. It´s really helpful if you have an architect friend or something like that.  Look into Evermotion Archmodels, these are model packs for architecture. You are not expected to model and texture everything from scratch nor having your own custom library. This model packs are widely used in archviz, your clients expect you have and use them.  And one last thing. If a client says they already have the model don´t take that literally. Include the modeling in the budget either way. Most architects build awful sketchup models that are almost useless, you'll end up doing the model from scratch anyway. The only purpose of those models is to understand the project. Ohhhh, and include a couple of revisions in your budget, architects love revisions."

vfx,305a0i,burgernz,2,Tue Mar 24 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"I forget exactly when but it happened a while back, early 2000s maybe.  I knew high end VFX software was kinda in trouble when Maya was being advertised in an infomercial, late at night, on now defunct TechTV and (maybe) the SyFy network.  This might have been around the time they were owned by that teacher's union, or perhaps just before SGI sold them.  SGI's workstation market was in the toilet and their acquisition of Alias|Wavefront had either lost its novelty or they were losing too much money.    And so Autodesk and Avid start acquiring more and more companies in trouble or looking for a quick cash-out, though you were generally looking at EOL on those tools unless you were lucky (Pinnacle was the place software went to die before them).  It's just so hard to be competitive and easy for these acquisitions-and-mergers publishers to compete with themselves.     Even though it was the standard for animation, Maya, I wouldn't have been surprised if they snuffed out with how many times it changed hands.  That finally happened with Soft (Autodesk is like the fourth owner, since I've been counting at least).  The Foundry is a little different story though.  My understanding is they were funded by venture capital that wants a return (maybe even out).  It wouldn't surprise me if they're just desperate for new sales if things have hit a plateau.  Their stuff is generally rather expensive and all but maybe one package is an acquisition and, at least as far as Nuke goes, they've been kinda over their head.    If their license enforcement is bringing in the cash it supposedly is I don't understand what more it would take to make the owners happy, all things considered."

The fact that you were buying the rendering technology they use and they didn't hoard an ""uber"" version of was a selling point for PRman, at least back when I used it.

Most 3rd party tools offer only varied levels of integration or access so that's not necessarily surprising.    I don't believe an actually shader TD from Pixar needed coaching.  That would imply the commercial version was more advanced where, if there was a differential, the commercial version would simply be something they previously used.   Having to be walked through some 3rd party tool's limited access and control of the renderer, maybe.    Bad analogy but, regarding 3rd party support, you're talking about the equivalent to moving from a French environment where the natural language of the tool was French and the user always interfaced with the tool in French and now they're in a world where everyone interfaces through braille."

vfx,301l51,Keyframe,2,Wed Mar 25 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"It's not that easy to use, contrary to the popular belief (mostly from people that haven't used it). However, you can't beat free. Vray and Arnold are expensive. Also, someone here mentioned basic theory behind everything is what matters - which is true about everything except switching renderers. It helps with lighting, materials/shading, whatever else you're doing, but each renderer has its own temperament and one has to know how it behaves in different situations to make most of it. Honestly, at this point in time and on smaller jobs (not in a big studio with lots of people) I'd rather marry V-ray. Arnold is another option, but limits you mostly to maya (as a smaller sop/one man band). On the other hand, both options are expensive, and free is easy to sell. What you're paying with is time you will need to invest to make good stuff come out vs time you would save with mentioned renderers which already are streamlined for good looks. V-ray especially so. There's a potential you can reach the limits of your renderer where you'd need customization capabilities of Renderman.. but if you're in that position, this is not the talk to have then.  tl;dr; if you can afford it - stick with V-ray (or Arnold), until they or someone else proves it's viable for small scale operations. Maybe couple of more versions if they listen to feedback from smalltime users."

vfx,30373k,jbaron23,4,Tue Mar 24 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"So just to be clear, you want to remove the center pagoda entirely but leave the circular walls around it?  I'd track the 3D camera.  Once you solve but before you export the camera, be sure to select some points on the ground and choose ""Ground Plane -> Set to selected"" so that things are properly aligned right side up.  Entering in the proper film back size (use built in presets or use vfxcamdb.com) and focal length will really help you get an accurate track.  Maybe it's the Youtube compression, but it looks like this was shot on a 5D perhaps?  The .MOV should have an associated .THM with it.  Rename the .THM to .JPG, open in your favorite photo app, and look at the EXIF data to see sensor size/focal length/shutter data.  Next, use the mask of the girl that you used in tracking the shot and the camera created in tracking to run a DensePointCloud so you have more data on the scene.  Then, using the point cloud as reference so you know where to place things in 3D, create a cylinder (be sure to check close top and bottom!).  The sides of the cylinder will be the innermost part of the walls behind the pagoda and the bottom will line up with the ""floor"" the pagoda is sitting on.  Project the last frame of your shot through the first frame of the camera and use that as a paint source to paint out as much of the columns as you can on your first frame.  Any remaining stuff that's covered up, you'll need to just paint by hand.  Luckily the floor looks like a pretty simple concrete texture; I'd just clone the shit out of it until it looks good.  Then, project this painted first frame on the geo and render using the full shot's camera.  This will give you your tracked painted plate to matte in there.  For both projections, you'll need to change your Project3D to be ""Project on: Back"" instead of ""Both"" so that it projects on the inside of the cylinder and not outside."

vfx,302mit,cky5019,2,Mon Mar 23 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"Making orange juice rain out of the sky is actually pretty easy in Nuke, but doing anything else with it (having it land on things, fill water bottles, splash off the ground) is incredibly hard.  I would expect even seasoned Houdini professionals to struggle with it a bit.  So do this practically.  Add the cloud in VFX to cover up the rain rig you have where the cloud should be.  For the cloud, consider using stock footage of clouds looking top-down (or maybe you could render some).  If you keep the supports of the rig off to the side of the scene rather than behind it, you can pretty easily paint these out.  If you're not getting enough orange juice you could potentially sample some from the plate and run it through Nuke particles to enhance the rain a bit, but this way you have all the hard interaction being done practically on set."
vfx,302mit,Generic_Name_Here,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:03:18 2015 UTC,"Doing the orange rain in post will be really difficult, especially getting it to fill up the water bottle. You're dealing with fluid simulation, tricky masking, and lots of lighting/texturing work. Best course of action is probably to create a practical rig. I'd do this by drilling some holes in a pvc pipe and get a hose to run orange-colored water into it. Take a look at how Film Riot did it and just put orange food coloring in the water, and make sure to light it to get the orange vibrant or look how you want it. You can probably paint out the rig and add a cloud in post."

At night in the wood, in broad daylight in the street, in a bedroom, on the ocean ? Is it moving a lot ? Jumping from a flying saucer and landing next to the actor, or standing still ominously ? Is it humanoid or animal shaped ? Could you fit actors/operators inside ? Are you framing the whole body or just the bust ? What kind of camera work are you using ? Still camera, shake handheld ? How many people can you have on set ? What budget do you have, how many days to prepare and to deliver the shot ?  It's very hard to make a decision on the basis of the informations you provided, but let's start from there: -You are saying you have experience with paper mache and feeling confident you'd get a good result with it. So do it.  I'd always suggest you stick to what you know and build up knowledge from this. So for example using paper mache and add other materials on top of it to enhance it. Maybe use a skeleton structure of wood/metal so you can articulate the creature, sculpt the shapes with paper mache, and cover the paper with layers of rubber and painted condoms (yes, it's thin, light, and bends /stretches easily. You can also get a few of them for free at health clinics..). I never worked with paper mache so I cannot tell how versatile it is (weight, lighting, look..), but I'm relatively sure you can use it in conjunction with pieces of rubber, latex and gooey stuff to make it more biological looking. Silicon is great but can be quite expensive if I recall correctly.   That being said, I am surprised about how many people are willing to completely drop the live action option.      Choosing CG over plate is not something that you should choose ""because live action might be too hard"", this is a form of stupid thinking that plagued the industry for a while now. Choose what is appropriate for your film, by checking if CG is really a better option than the real deal. CG is hard. No matter what people tell you, creating a CG alien is hard, especially for untrained individuals. Making it look real (modelling, animation, shading, lighting..) is hard. Compositing a CG creature on a defocused background and properly integrating it is hard (hell that's why I still have a job...). Camera tracking a defocused shot is hard. Why the hell would you add all of these compositing, tracking issues if you can have them solved in the first place with a decent live action creature ? There are so many creatures from movies of the 70s that were made for really cheap with pieces of rubber, plastic, silicon... that worked very well.  Maybe that kind of contraints will limit the range of movements of the creature, or the way you can film it, but that's also a process that can feed your creativity. That's how Alien got to be so dark and oppressive and the alien so terrifying."

I wouldn't be in such a hurry to jump into it unless you have practical limitations like loans and support costs to deal with that make it necessary.  Its the 'bullshit' that I actually think is pretty important. Its the bullshit that allows you to 'play' without having any limitations or restrictions, something that informs the way you think and approach problems, which inform how you will process and think in the future, i.e. in work situations. I went to an art college too, with a bit of history and lit on the side, and graduated with a degree in fine art & printmaking, and the things I learned in the art school are with me every day at work even when I'm researching or compositing or modeling. Maybe you're looking at it from the point of view of acquiring practical skills for use in vfx, in which case the art school will not give you a lot, but there are much broader and bigger lessons to be learned at college, skills that will assist everything you do along the way in vfx. Thats just my experience though, your mind may work differently.   Regarding your portfolio though, without actually seeing it of course, I will hazard to say that skills you learned in school have absolutely informed what you've built - composition, color theory, balance, tone... all these things aren't nuthin', these are the base skills I'm talking about of everything you'll do in vfx.   Regarding 'humps' - what I mean is that while the company can/will offer you a job, they may not be able to secure the visa for you unless you meet the requirements for education and experience that many governments impose/require for granting work permits. Do your research here, the company will probably not bother to look too deeply into whether you meet the actual requirements - beyond a cursory check - until you have accepted the position and they pass it on to their person/legal team who actually arrange the visas, and it may come back at that point that you're not eligible.

I don't know about the UK but the governments of Canada aren't really enthusiastic about all of these foreigners coming over and soaking up the subsidy that basically pays for upwards of half the salary of an individual artist.  And rightfully so, that money should be going to giving a Canadian a job.  I know of more than one artist prevented from crossing the border because the company that hired them did not, in fact, have everything all worked out.  You cannot just assume they are going to take care of you and you can't assume that their agenda is one their government is going to support indefinitely.    One way to throttle new immigration is to put degree requirements.  That would be so easy for them to do.  I'm pretty sure that it's that tough to get a job in the US doing the same thing.  The amount of red tape, letters of recommendation and affidavits that had to be acquired for the English, Japanese and South African (to name a few) fellows I've worked with at US studios was intense.  I'm pretty sure none of them were without a degree from their home countries, even if they were going to be working with and for mostly self-taught founders of the industry."
vfx,2zfg9e,BurnetRhoades,-2,Wed Mar 18 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"And rightfully so, that money should be going to giving a Canadian a job.   It's a bit of a stretch to consider them Canadian jobs. Hardly any of the major studios started in Canada, and none work on Canadian projects. I'd say most Americans working there would say they didn't steal a Canadian job, but that Canada stole their job and they took it back. At least the UK tax breaks also supported a wave of British original franchises (Harry potter, James Bond, Narnia, etc). When governments manipulate global markets, they don't really have the moral high ground to complain when it backfires."
vfx,2zfg9e,generic_human_1979,0,Wed Mar 18 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of where the studio is based or started, the subsidy comes from the Canadian government.  As far as they're concerned it's going towards subsidizing a Canadian.  You have to have residency to fill one of those spots.  You cannot, for instance, live in a neighboring Washington State border town and commute in to Vancouver.    And they're aware that so many of those seats are being filled by non-Canadian citizens and they are not thrilled by this.  This is a manipulation of their longstanding support of the arts and film and animation in a very real way.  The UK situation is worse, actually, because prior to Harry Potter that whole region was a non-factor.  The subsidies brought that film there, it wasn't a ""British original franchise"".  It was bought by the government and then the work brought artists and supervisors to the UK market from outside.  The UK industry didn't become relevant in the cycle of one film because the local talent base suddenly bootstrapped its way to being world class.    Main house on Narnia was R+H, btw. and SPI was the next biggest house, though Studio C in Guatemala had more shots than SPI so based on shot count the next house in line after R+H was the Guatemalans.  Also, the VFX have never been good in the Bond franchise.  They've received the pity nod occasionally because of their mix of practical with digital and the Academy likes to throw that bone sometimes, like they did this year.  Looking cheeseball has kinda always been part of Bond's production design and visual effects though, to be fair."
vfx,2zfg9e,BurnetRhoades,2,Wed Mar 18 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"The UK tax breaks are for film in general, not just vfx. Bond, Potter and Narnia were all shot in the UK, using predominately UK based talent. Vfx started outside the UK for the earlier movies, but the latest of each were mostly or entirely made in the UK as the industry grew. Your argument is a decade out of date.   It's clear the intention of the tax breaks are also to bring in work from LA, or there would be greater restrictions on the type of work it's available for. Even the UK tax breaks often require significant rewrites for movies to qualify (see Thor 2 being based in Greenwich). Basically, they wanted to take the jobs, studios saw a chance to make a quick buck, there wasn't enough home grown talent to fill the workload (arguably still not enough). They put people abroad out of work, so those people came here. They were manipulated because they tried to manipulate."
vfx,2zfg9e,generic_human_1979,-1,Wed Mar 18 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"the latest of each were mostly or entirely made in the UK as the industry grew. Your argument is a decade out of date.   I don't care about the shooting, personally, this is an effects topic and my assumption is we're talking about why FX got outsourced.  However, both Canadian and UK like to ""bundle"" and if filming is being done in either place there's this natural tendency for the finance people to just want everything done there.    On the flipside, this is something that also affects the independent film only in this case the finance people and bond company people, if they're Canadian, actually put pressure on the filmmaker to do their post there as well.  It's not just the $200M film that's effected, it's the sub $1M film.  Difference being, Canadian firms at every level actually care about where the work is done and, rightfully so, want to keep it all there even if someone in the US can beat their price or for the same price beat the work of who is available at indie prices.  They have the attitude that the studios don't have a shred of.  They (US studios) don't care about vendors at all or having a sustainable industry.  They're multinational corporations, some of them, or big enough that any sense of local or national responsibility are meaningless.  They're nationless and loyal to nothing but maximum profit.   The industry grew both places because the work was taken there.  The work grew the industry artificially.  The work didn't migrate to to either place to take advantage of underutilized capacity or a demonstration of underutilized expertise, the later especially in the UK.

Rather than treat them as what they are (film tax breaks) they were argued according to how affected vfx artists saw them (vfx subsidies). No one is going to take an argument seriously in that situation. You're not going to convince the uk to change its tax breaks over vfx when the rest of the uk film industry is booming because of them (and it is, the domestic market share has increased significantly, which was the end goal of the breaks, to create a home grown film industry that's large enough to compete and be self sustainable).  Yes, businesses are cold and uncaring, but so are governments when it comes to people outside their country. You you think the BC government cared about the American film workers being put out of work? It's all just governments, businesses and people acting in their own self interest."

When your workforce is not overwhelmingly native, it's not ""home grown"".  When the workforce that is there and the companies that are booming are doing so because a large chunk of the salary of the guy sitting at the workstation is on the government dime, that's not an industry built by the industry (not to mention, not a sustainable position).  Standing on the shoulders of giants the UK can see for miles right now.  But guess what.  Sooner or later the actual tax base may not be so enamored by all the money going to benefit foreign corporations and migrant workers and they'll see through the fallacy.  They might want to do the hard maths and see that in almost no case does the State offering film subsidies actually make anything but pennies on the dollar.  It's a house built out of cards that could change with politics.  And when those subsidies are withdrawn, or shrink, and these ""home grown"" companies have to man up and really pay folks (and I use that term loosely given the bad reputation that region has for compensation even on the government tit) and the work costs what it really costs I wonder just how much of that ""home grown"" industry will remain.   edit: the cherry on top of all of this is that the VFX capitol of Canada is the most expensive city in all of North America and likewise the UK.  When they have to start paying for it all for real, that's gonna be something.  I wonder if some deep pocket Indian or Chinese playboy will come in and save the day."

Sure they're Canadian jobs in that they're in Canada, but it's like when a call centre gets closed in Canada and the work sent to India. Would you argue that it's really an Indian job or it should be a Canadian job?

How is that not clear outside some elaborate series of justifications?  The trouble with the Canadian arrangement for vfx is that the country has created the appearance of an industry that cannot be self supporting and will disappear almost entirely when the giveaways stop. For one thing there isn't enough labor with only Canadian artists to support it so much of the labor (labour?) has to be imported, and as far as I know very few of those laborers are on a path to permanent citizenship or would look to contribute to the country if the vfx industry moved away, and probably none of them are buying homes. Bit of a complete supposition there as I don't know the numbers, but I think its probably accurate.  And in this case I actually don't think ""stealing"" is too strong a term for it. This is an industry that was developed over decades by people who built lives and careers around it, and then it was lifted up and out from under them because the studios found they could make a few more bucks by doing so. My sympathy is with the American artists who built the industry in the first place, the rest of us are just following. It is however their own fault they weren't smart enough to prepare for the eventuality by creating stronger union and guild links within their own location as many of the other aspects of the industry have done.  ""They have to spend the money to get some of it back."" I don't understand this statement.  There is no requirement that the money stay in Canada. there are no movies ""made"" in this scenario, its only labor to support the American studios. As you say, ""Canada is not the primary producer or market for these movies, nor was it any driving force in the industry prior to the tax breaks."" On this we agree. I think the ""tax breaks"" or ""giveaways"" would be better spent on funding a true local industry, Canadian films, written by Canadians, directed by Canadians... not given away to American private companies to create the appearance of an industry dedicated to the privilege of doing their labor more cheaply that it could be done by the people who built the business.  wow, this thread is such a digression from the original question..."

vfx,2zfg9e,Ckynus,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:34:11 2015 UTC,"Same.  I was pretty shocked the first time I heard of a visual effects oriented degree.  Most programs have various flavors of computer graphics or computer animation.  Techniques for visual effects are more esoteric and often facility specific.  Part of me wishes I had stayed in school but that would have been for non-CG classes in traditional animation and design (CalArts), plus the experience of the environment.  Given enough talent and self-taught skills you may not be missing anything from what a school might have to teach you but you do rob yourself of the experience (an expensive one) of living in that pure creative, hopefully highly competitive, collaborative environment.   I'd still make the same choice to leave but I loved my school and for those first several years I spent almost every moment I wasn't working back on campus."

And that was from HR/Recruitment insisting that you had a background in VFX or animation. They let 2 runners go because they didn't have this background, one of which was later rehired after doing an escape course.

vfx,2zfg9e,splinechaser,2,Wed Mar 18 06:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the general sentiment here and say: Finish your degree. Yes, experience matters more than a degree when it comes to getting a particular job. But you'll get a lot more out of getting a degree than just whether it will help your career or not. As hard as it may be to believe, you may find something else you like doing even more than VFX. I can tell you that what I thought I wanted to do career-wise when I started college was not exactly what I wanted to do even four or five years after graduating. But I probably never would have realized that if I hadn't had the variety of experiences I obtained in college.  The other reason to get your degree is… well, I'll lay it to you straight (and I'm aware that this will not make me popular among the self-taught crowd). People with college degrees look down on people who don't have them. Just a bit. I admit that I'm guilty of it. But having a college degree says that you're someone who can commit to something and is able to finish it on your own. It also says that you have a wide variety of experiences. I don't have to be worried about seeming like I'm talking down to you when I try to explain a complex concept. I can assume that you're at least familiar with higher level math, and that you're reasonably literate. In short, you're educated. We have that in common. Honestly, the gaps in knowledge (not to mention sophistication) I see when talking to someone who didn't go to college can be striking.  You're going to have plenty of opportunities to start and advance your career. If you're really talented at what you do, people will take notice. But what if you get burned out in ten or twenty years, and decide you want to do something completely different? Having a degree will enable you to do that. And trust me that, when you're in your thirties or forties, possibly married, maybe with a couple of kids, it's going to be a lot harder to go back and finish your degree at that point.  Don't fall into the trap of thinking that this is the last chance you'll have to get your “dream job”. Stay in school. You won't regret it."

Anyone who has an ounce of talent would be better off staying self-taught and developing their own killer ""student reel"" than being labeled an AI graduate (or the like) because these schools are not picky about who they select (everyone's money is green) and it's almost impossible for the instructors to flunk someone out.  A degree would only matter in VFX if you were applying for something software related.  Otherwise it might be necessary when you decide you've had enough of this shit industry and you want an exit strategy.  But it's still no guarantee.

I agree that a degree from a for-profit isn't worth nearly as much as one from a “real” school, but I don't know that it would really hurt your chances at getting a job. If anything, it's a good way for people who are having a tough time getting into the industry get some hands-on experience (granted, it comes at a substantial cost, the practical applications of your education will be fairly limited, and it's really a case of you're only going to get out of it exactly what you put into it). If that's the kind of school that OP is talking about, then yeah, it probably makes less sense to complete that degree given a solid job offer. Though I still think there's value in having a college degree. It doesn't really matter what your degree is in or (to a certain extent) where it's from. Even having an AA degree from a local community college will set you apart as someone to take a bit more seriously in a lot of people's minds.   At Digital Domain we had receptionists with aerospace degrees from MIT and engineers getting people coffee.   Everyone has to start at the bottom, and that's fine. Having a degree doesn't change that. But I still think having a college degree provides a tremendous benefit when developing your career, not just starting it."

Anyone from a known for-profit ""certificate mill"" is going to have a strike against them for a variety of reasons right off the bat, with the more desirable shops to work with.  They are uniformly resented among the experienced artists/leads/sups that I know.  Maybe games studios haven't developed the same bad taste in their mouth but there were a few years where several big studios didn't even want to deal with any more students coming from a legitimate program like SCAD, because suddenly we started getting ""bad eggs"".  I'm sorry, but no.  If you're in a highly technical position software related then schooling matters.  They have a more academia culture, but you'd need to keep that AA to yourself because then you're swimming with Masters and PhDs.  Artist position your degree never comes up and means nothing to anyone else you actually work with.  HR doesn't count.  Immigration might make it hard for you getting a visa but to the folks you work with and for, nope.  Not even a little.    At best it's fuel for small talk and nostalgia if you happen to be working with someone from the same school.  At best it might mean your reel gets seen before someone else if the reviewer also went to your school.  It has no further influence unless it's to lump you in with a bad batch of new hires from a particular school.  That is definitely a way that your school can matter after you get the job.  Nobody in Academia or professional life cares about an AA though.  You don't go advertising that to people if you want to be taken seriously.  You've got that backwards."

I don't know of any “trade schools” that offer a bachelor's degree (unless we're talking about a for-profit school as mentioned in another response, but that's a different story).  And I'm not necessarily talking about leaving to become an accountant. But VFX isn't the be-all, end-all of the industry either. I had already started (albeit just started) a career in production before I left to go to film school. It was in school that I realized that what I really wanted to do was post. And it wasn't until several years after I graduated that I decided I really liked working in visual effects, thanks largely due to experiences I had with VFX and CGI in college.  Has my degree ever helped me get a job? I can't say. Maybe my first job or two, but it probably wasn't a huge factor to be honest. Has it better equipped me to do whatever jobs I've had, and helped me to get more out of them, both personally and professionaly? Unquestionably so.

When he's manipulating the cops, we basically had the cops standing as still as they could. QS then came in and moved their hands into the new positions. We stabilised any wobbles and removed blinks etc to make it seem frozen. We sped up the parts where he needed to move quickly and added a blur effect. The CG rain and flying objects (frozen in the air) completed the illusion of frozen time. The camera was shooting 48fps (Extra frames in case we needed to re-time slightly).

That´s why you need a VFX Supervisor. Al shots are different and involve different procedures to achieve a specific effect or whatever it is you are looking for. Planning is key.  If you already have some knowledge of vfx and still can´t figure out how to shoot something maybe the only thing you are missing is a bit more knowledge and experience.
vfx,2zd5w9,sancampos,0,Tue Mar 17 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the channel.  Well until recently I only had a compact camera and all I did was experiments. I must consider things like focal length as well. For example, what's the proper focal length for shooting an all-greenscreen shot? Or how do I keep the camera's movement identical in two shots where part of the screen is supposed to be keyed out, as in The Invisible Man which was made back when this technology was a novelty? I just can't wrap my head around the fact that they shot the same scene twice with the same camera movements. And it's pretty slick."
vfx,2zd5w9,sancampos,2,Tue Mar 17 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"There´s no proper focal length for shooting anything, that´s more related to cinematography, storytelling and photography.  Shooting the same scene twice with the same camera movements is achieved with expensive motion controlled camera rigs. You won't probably get your hands on one of those in a little while.  From your other comment: you can make things to facilitate rotoing, but there´s no way around it. And no, behind the scenes are not targeted at the general audience, you can learn a lot by watching those if you know what to look for.  If you have to wait six months until your school opens your best bet is to buy a cheap DSLR and make a short. You'll learn a lot and you´ll have something cool to show."

Keep in mind you need Maya or Max to use fumefx and you have to use mental ray. phoenixfd works in maya or max with vray.   Houdini is a full 3D program on its own. Fume only simulates fire and smoke, while houdini sims just about everything (fire, smoke, liquids, mograph particles, crowds, fracturing, rigid and soft bodies).   If you already use max or maya and just want to add in some explosions and fire, fume is simpler to learn and gives some great results.

I've still not seen any Realflow results that don't have the telltale look of blobby or somewhat cottage cheesy results.  Fluid results and the surfaces created by them can be massaged in numerous ways to get far more physically and intuitively correct results.    Basically you have to buy multiple 3rd party programs to plug into other packages, use them within the parameters of how these multiple different programs speak to each other and then within the limits of how you can manipulate and render the result in possibly another program.

Just track it in AE and apply a colour correction or whatever works for you.   2) I would avoid slow motion unless you are shooting at a high frame rate or using something like Twixtor. You only slowed down one scene but it wasn't very smooth due to the frame rate.  3) Muzzle flashes are really just a Hollywood effect, so watch how they do it. Yours were a good start but needed some changes. Blurring the edges of what you already have, duplicating it and then scaling it up much bigger. Place the duplicated one behind the flash and blur it even more. FreddieW has stuff on this, I'd recommend watching him for reference. Also, make sure the flash affects the actor and any props. This is a big one, it really links the flash to the footage.  Overall it's really good. I like how you kept it short and didn't go over the top."

The stock footage blood that comes with Action Essentials has not only become completely cliche and recognizable, it never looked good to begin with and, ironically, has contributed to the perception that digital blood effects are always bad, even though they're practical elements.  It's a ""better than nothing"" tool for people without a lot of options, no time and no expertise or means to make the effects any other way.  I don't really think any of that applies to the parties involved."
vfx,2ywmye,BurnetRhoades,2,Fri Mar 13 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"Hey! I was the Sup and Lead Comp at Ingenuity. I agree about the actions essentials elements being over used. While it may not look like it, Power Rangers was shot on a tiny budget. Post was done on weekends and spare time over the course of months. We had a small blood and fx shoot piggy backed on, but it only yielded so many elements (which we used the hell out of) before we needed help. A lot of the blood in there are actually Houdini fluid sims as well. The AE elements are just so damn recognizable (mostly to VFX people/enthusiasts honestly) that you can't unsee them.

Planar tracking was the way to go and it did a good job considering the lack of features on his white suit. I agree there could have been another pass of grid warping on top of the suit, but there were bigger fish to fry at that juncture. ""Rough geo and a projection"" will work for matte painting paralex and things like that but is not an applicable technique when accuracy is your desired goal."

vfx,2yvty3,MorboisPleased,12,Fri Mar 13 05:54:18 2015 UTC,"This is a tricky one.  ""Why is it tricky, /u/teaguechrystie?""  I — mmph. I was clearly just about to tell you that. Stop interrupting people.  It's tricky because of cognitive dissonance. When I put on my Thinkin' Cap for Philosophers and consider internships as a standalone issue, I come to all sorts of hifalutin conclusions about modern day vocational slavery and stuff about the impending post-scarcity economy, and, like... cap and trade? (I don't know what cap and trade is, no.)  Then, I take off my Thinkin' Cap for Philosophers, revealing the Terrifyingly Symbolic Bald Spot of Realism, and it's like... hey, I had an internship, it was weird and it kind of sucked philosophically, but it lasted for two or three months and then I got hired and I've been steadily employed for the near-decade that has ensued since. This whole career started with an internship for a company that would not have hired me at the time they enlisted me as a soldier in the coffee wars. My alternative at the time was not, like, ""or I could magically get hired instead!"" It was internship or bust. Probably. Or — whatever, maybe not. But it felt like it.  No, you know what? I think it probably was. It's easy to think that if I hadn't managed to get hired for a couple of months, I could have just picked up a quick non-VFX job and honed my skills further, and gotten good enough to be hired later. That's easy to imagine, but this is a trick. This is a trick of the mind. It seems sensible to me because right now, nine years later, yes, if I blow off a VFX gig because I don't like the specific terms of the arrangement, I can probably pull another one out of my ass. But back then? I was just out of school, I had just moved to Los Angeles, I had just figured out the concept of, like, ""winter,"" which would suddenly no longer apply to me. I wasn't entitled to unlimited time. I had a fixed amount of financial padding before my whim caught fire.  The internship, in this context, represented the last crucial step of transition between amateur and professional. Brief Yoda period, Darth Vader in a swamp, that kind of shit. I did the thing, and then, hooray! Professional now! Throw to Williams.  But, at the time? Not benefiting from past-tense? I had absolutely no way of knowing if the internship was going to do a goddamned thing. I didn't have any way of knowing if they'd hire me or not, I couldn't ask, I couldn't do anything. If they were going to hire me, based purely on my merits, even that would have come down to simple fucking luck — luck that I ended up sitting in a chair at a studio where they actually hire their interns sometimes, instead of grinding them into tasteless protein bars for the next generation of hungry children, or ignoring them, or whatever.  I tried my best to kick ass at it, and I did, and they hired me, and now I'm Mitt Romney over here pretending like I've built my own destiny. The truth is, I got so lucky with that internship. I happened to catch a good one before my whim caught fire, and I thusly escaped the assured burning-down that would have immediately taken place.  ...and, you know. I worked there for like three months, and then got laid off, because VFX. Foomp.  But, whatever. I left that place having been told I was hireable, having actually been paid to work on real shit, and (at least on paper) with the recommendation of a respected company to back me up. Getting real-hired after that is an entirely different (and much easier) game than getting real-hired before it. My shit would not have happened that way without an internship. The alternative history, where I just hone my skills from the comfort of my hoot-owl shift at Denny's, does not include a step like ""and then I was suddenly on the path to success."" That's so much more of an uphill thing. There's crappy Craigslist jobs, for years. There's only guessing at what a real pipeline looks like. There's only guessing at what a professional would do. There's only guessing at what a professional would charge. (Well, actually, that one applies in both histories.) There's being told that I seem like a 'great generalist' at a job interview, and getting excited, and not realizing that it was meant as a consolation.  So, okay.   With my Thinkin' Cap for Philsophers, this issue boils down to ""we can debate the merits of this system all day long, but at the end of the day, a system wherein all of that shit happened and the new idiot also gets paid would probably be better."" On the other hand, with my Bald Spot That Is No Longer A Metaphor Oh God Time Is Passing, the issue boils down to ""your best realistic shot at kickstarting a solid career will probably be an internship somewhere, but finding (and being accepted into) the right internship is the crucial detail, and with a few exceptions you'll have no way of knowing what the right internship is.""  For instance — and, full disclosure, I have never worked at any of the example VFX shops to follow — you might think ILM is the way to go. I mean, in terms of finding an above-the-board internship program with a solid shot at an eventual staff position. ILM is legit as fuck, right? What about DNeg? Animal Logic? Pixar? Right? These places all seem like a dead-lock, it definitely seems like the right way to play it.  However. My internship? The one I've been writing about? The case-study of an internship that worked? That was at a company you probably haven't heard of. (They're not unimportant, they're just small.) My tour of duty in the coffee wars was at this little shop in Hollywood, street parking only. You would have blown off the successful internship because you were distracted by the Shiny Corporate Stability Illusion.  Beyond that, I have known my fair share of interns — well, okay, known of, not known — I don't actually talk to interns, insert joke about interns being disposable humans, system of institutionalized injustice remains stalwart — that did everything right, lined up their shit at a super legit and ostensibly rich company, and then... three months came and went, and they were out on their ass.  Controlling for all variables, the ""right"" move in this hypothetical turns out to be getting an internship at a company you've never heard of. Which, fair enough. The problem is, how do you distinguish between a company you've never heard of that happens to be legit, and a company you've never heard of that happens to be, like, the shadiest part of the hyena kingdom?  You can't. Because joy is an illusion, Morbo. End of lesson.  No, but, seriously — you can't. Not really. Not reliably. You're signing up for a bite-sized roto lotto no matter what you do.  (Heh — and, right about here, this is the part in the VFX artist's rant where you'd be nodding along and enjoying your cigarette and he's suddenly right up in your face going ""because the IRS is a government-mandated mafia, man, and I'm thinkin' it's time to clean up these fuckin' streets, you feel me?,"" and you're trying to Homer-Simpson yourself back into the bushes.) (I don't know why my mind just made that connection, but it seems like a plausible way this could have gone, based on the ranty VFX people I've known.) (It's okay, though — you and me, we're the sane ones. Don't panic.)  So, there's that, the internship crapshoot. You were askin' about whether it would just be smarter to go in for a junior position and sign yourself up for some roto work.   (Well, first, I don't like the common association of roto work being lowly work. I've seen too many high-expertise roto miracles to throw the roto-baby out with the roto-bathwater.) (In the spirit of honesty, I should tell you that I spent a minute trying to figure out a way to cram a roto-rooter joke into this paragraph.)  I don't know, to be honest. I've seen lots of people promoted out of both internships and out of junior roles... and I've seen lots of people dismissed from both internships and from junior roles. There should be some solace in that, I guess — that in my head, there's not a clear ""better"" avenue to take. I guess that's something.  The problem is, again, it really comes down to your individual situation. Your skills, your contribution, your attitude, your timing, your company. You might do the exact same thing two times at the same company and it goes two different ways. It's out of your control. Not to say that there's no ""wrong"" moves, just that there's only so much you can do in the category of ""right"" ones.  Believe it or not, this comment is continued below."
vfx,2yvty3,teaguechrystie,8,Fri Mar 13 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"So, what are they? What are some things you can do to maximize your lotto buy-in?   Hey, you just skimmed to this. Not fair. The numbered list is for people who read the whole thing. Have as excellent of a reel as you possibly can when you apply. I'm talking, like, if you had a spare hour of free time in the month before mailing off the demo reels, that means that you failed at this task. Don't just go, ""these are the things I've done, whatever, I hope they're good enough."" Come at it like, ""this is real life, motherfucker, this is my ride, a guy on the internet was encouraging and weird about it, I'm doing everything I can to make it work."" When you're working, whether it's as an intern or as a junior artist, while very carefully not being an asshole about it, make sure it's clear to the people above you that you're overqualified for what they have you doin.' Not that you're ungrateful or anything like that, just that you happen-to-not-be one of the people who just walked in here and also got a chair to sit at. At my internship, there were several folks who decided last week they wanted to be VFX people, and there was me, who had been doing (various, amateur) VFX for five years, and a year of schooling. We all had the same internship. We all performed the same tasks. The supervisor didn't hire me, so the supervisor had no idea I could do more than roto. It's likely that nobody will explicitly tell you this, so, here is me explicitly telling you it: there should be no v002s, ever, in any of the tasks assigned to an intern or a junior artist. Find out in advance what level of detail they need — like, for roto, maybe they just need a loose feathered thing, nothing extreme — and then deliver exactly that. It's easy to tell if you're done, and it sounds like I'm being a dick, but here's what you do: look for errors. Are there errors? Fix those errors. Repeat. No? Are you sure? Great, thanks. Just to be clear, you're really sure, right? Okay, sorry — go ahead and submit it. (Aside from this just generally being a good standard to have, you will probably be the only artist in your particular room who always nails it on the first try, and... guess what, this is about maximizing your lotto ticket. That's a strong play.) It should be said that I'm very hip to the fact that paint-out and roto is an artistic process, but... it'd be helpful to think, at this stage, that there is no art to your result. Not for this. You shouldn't have to defend why you think it's done. You were given a straightforward task, with a binary completion condition, and you won't win a subjective argument with your supervisor about whether or not your roto is ready. Artistic interpretation is definitely something that happens in VFX, but interpretation is for magic wand particles and spaceship design, and you'll get to that later — right now, your job is providing plainly correct work.) After points 3 and 4, it'll be important to double-emphasize point 5: you may not be a dick. You must be delightful. It will be hard. You will often feel a whole crapload of pressure, and... you need to calm down. Top Gun. Breathe. It's very likely that everyone you're trying to impress is working a job with more stress than yours, so if it seems like you can't handle what you're working on, that's bad for your chances. Note: unless someone is actively bugging you about it, how long it's taking you to do your shot is okay. You're okay. Strip yourself of the intensity, just do the work, and be cool and helpful and professional. Be like you know for a fact you're doing the right thing and have no insecurity about it whatsoever. Be the lie. On balance, I'd say the net effect of taking just a bit too long every time is less detrimental than the net effect of seeming like you're about to leave here and bomb a hospital. Be cool. The various higher-level people at your job that you like, the nice ones, the cool ones... without seeming needy or writing too much justification, every now and then, it probably wouldn't hurt to shoot one of those folks a link to a shot you're working on at home — something where you're doing all the FX on it, not just the stuff you get assigned at work — and asking their opinion. ""Hey sir, Morbo the Wonder Intern here. If you have a spare moment in the next couple of days, I was hoping you could take a look at a shot I'm working on for a freelance thing and tell me your thoughts. I'm trying to put my finger on what's missing."" For one thing, their opinion will almost certainly be right, just because they're judging it against conversations and experience they've been building up for a long-ass time, and know what they'd do in your situation to avoid revisions. For another and far-more-important thing, this is how you get to know people, and get known to people, and make friends and network and behave like a human. Get better at it, nobody's perfect. Finally, and this is where it gets just a wee bit icky... one of the side-effects is, when this is done right, suddenly someone that the company trusts is now aware that you're probably overqualified for what the company has you doing. Similarly, if you find yourself in a nonchalant kitchen conversation with any of those folks, you could — maybe, with the artful application of minimalism — say 'hey, by the way, if any of y'all ever need roto stuff for a side project or a freelance thing or sumthin,' lemme know."" As far as I'm aware, virtually no VFX artists don't have various bullshit on the side that they're stressed out about. Roto support at home is like a spa day. Kidnap their families. Fucking do it. Look, it's the same as it'd be in any profession. To make yourself as absolutely hireable as possible, the correct course of action is to be awesome. You don't have to be perfect — although that would help — you just have to be awesome. Be cool, be fun, be good, be professional, be helpful, be interested in improving, be sure of your assignments and your communication, be a person with other interests and a varied existence, and don't make anybody's life worse. Just be awesome.    The thing about all of this, though... if they don't need you, none of it will help you keep that job. That's the lotto, partner. You are in line for a question mark, after all.  But, memory is long. The artists who liked you, and the supervisors who liked you... them liking you is worth more than rent. They'll remember you. You'll be the name they say when they get asked if they know anybody. If you can go around and manage to keep making people like you, you're going to be stickin' around the industry for a long-ass time.   Which — y'know — for better or worse, right?  Heh, we have fun. Good luck with it.  Also, can you get me a Diet Coke?"

I imagine a lot of shops take on interns because it's basically a legal form of slavery.   That wasn't the case at Digital Domain though.  No telling what their policy is now but, historically, they only took on one intern every year or so and they were invariably someone a class above your average recent graduate.    They never had to get coffee or do menial labor.   You can teach practically anyone to roto and so if more roto artists were needed we raided security, reception and other non-creative, non-technical areas of the company, offering employees that had been there a while a chance to move from having a job to possibly having a career.  For interns, the candidate was always someone about to graduate from MIT, USC, UCLA, etc.  A top graduate from a top source.  And so they were never treated like slaves, even if they weren't paid like employees, they could invariably expect an open door upon graduation and they all got to do essential work on real projects, going on to have great careers whether they got their first job out of school with us or ILM."

Asking for free advice from someone when they know that giving it will lead to less work is kind of an insult.  If your goal is to really learn to do what they do, your better option would be to subscribe to something like Digital Tutors and just learn it on your own.  Given that your post house would stand to save quite a bit of money by keeping the work in-house, they might even be willing to pony up the $40/month it costs for a little while to let you get up to speed."

That might even be part of the bidding process. More detail than that would mean you'd be taking up artist's time, as the production manager wouldn't have any more details than that, and the studio probably doesn't want to pay their artists to chat.  Maybe tell the production manager that you're interested in the process and would like to buy one of the artists working on your project lunch. That should be cool."

If it's in the contract to supply the source files, they should send them over. I think they tend to charge more for this.  Practically they might not want to show you or send you files because sometimes a shot can rely on a huge custom tool chain, and getting that running outside the facility is a huge pain.  I'm just coming at this from a VFX guy who has been asked to send files. Often I send them, problem 1, don't have VRay, problem 2, custom plugin not available, problem 3, wrong Maya version, problem 4, now they only use Max... and so on. I think it becomes about time.  I think it's pretty reasonable to ask a few questions about the shot, if you're supervising it.   Basically... I have no idea.

If it´s a simple shot but you have no idea how they did you might sound unprofessional.  I´m not from the US so my experience might be a bit different but a had people asking how to do something and then doing it themselves. It felt terrible. I asked a couple of people and that seems to happen from time to time here and everybody hates it.  I think the best way to approach this if you want in depth knowledge is to pay for consultation.

vfx,2yshyz,vfxlogic,7,Thu Mar 12 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend sourcing your textures from select still frames through the sequence, rather than trying to roll moving footage on the top surfaces of the pieces.  This may require a quick animated-mask-driven crossfade on the discrete surfaces as they get ripped up, but in the end it will look much better.  It's hard to tell if this was done, but make sure the UV coordinates you sourced from the camera projection are ""frozen"" to the pieces, so the software is not recalculating those as the camera and the pieces move.  You may find that in order to do my first suggestion, you have to apply different camera projections to different sets of pieces to make sure you have high enough resolution imagery on the pieces later in the shot."

In fact there are instances where this is going to be necessary for the amount of distance and view angle change.  The key is your texture reference has to happen before any animation is applied to the surface, or you have to otherwise reference a stable version of the geometry.  Sometimes it's fine to just use a single image.  But it's the methodology of texture mapping that's the biggest issue here."

I understand how to fix a few of the errors if I went back and redid it now, but still trying to get past the texture problem. It has to do with the ""Render to Texture"" setting inside 3Ds Max. It actually functioned how it was suppose to, which is basically taking the original footage and using it as a texture for the ground, but the problem is that 3Ds max doesn't know what the hell's behind the camera, so it makes it default to white and weird patterns.  I'm not sure how to go about finding the solution for this problem yet, maybe there's a way to repeat the texture backwards incase that happens...""

Otherwise the texture degrades over the length of the shot because the camera is moving towards the pieces that would have the least amount of texture detail.  So, if stills are used, the chunks near the end would want a still projected from the end frames of the plate and the pieces at the beginning would want a texture projected from the beginning of the plate.  At the very least.  And still, if you can project a still and make that stick to the animated pieces then you should also be able to use the rolling footage too."

Your black levels on the background compared to your foreground are also off, which would have gone a good way to balancing the foreground and background images. You talk about tree's below but I can't even see them - if it was so dark and with not much camera motion a good technique is to paint up a single frame and then match-move it back into the shot, as this erases problems with edges and fuzzy keys."

vfx,2yopna,r2c,2,Wed Mar 11 15:32:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've built a few render farms for small studios and schools.  Here's what I'd recommend:  If you have a server room, get some 1U SuperMicro Twin servers to act as render nodes.  Each one of these 1U units has two computers in it and each computer has two processors.  You can get these used on ebay cheap.  They will make a lot of noise though!  Just get a server rack off craigslist and throw them in.  Or buy a server rack from rackmountsolutions.net.  Get a really cheap and simple one, maybe a half-height server rack if you don't have a lot of gear.  If you don't have a server room and can't have noisy render nodes like the SuperMicros, then I the best solution is buy some desktop machines and use those as render nodes.  Get a couple desktops with dual processors - like a Dell Precision 7810 and use those as dedicated render nodes.  You can keep them in the main office.  They will be very quiet.  Just keep in mind any computer used for rendering will generate a good bit of heat.  I'm assuming you've already got a dedicated server or NAS set up as your file server.  You'll also want to have a dedicated license server, but this can just be a Mac Mini.  Good Luck!  For render farm management software, I'd recommend Deadline from www.thinkboxsoftware.com"
vfx,2yopna,DoctorOctagone,2,Wed Mar 11 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks.   No server room.  We had to scale down a few months ago, so we actually have 9 desktops running renders during the day - they are mid level machines by now ( I don't have the specs in front of me though.) - yet with our latest project they are pushing frames times that  can sometimes reach over an hour.   I'm hoping to just get a little more umph - and gain a little space with the render farm.   Deadline does look awesome - we are only using Backburner right now."
vfx,2yopna,schmon,2,Wed Mar 11 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"Deadline is nice but a little pricey, CGRU is ok if you're a bit of a geek, but it runs as many apps as deadline  is your bottleneck CPU ? At work we have pretty beefy machines but IO is often a bigger bottleneck (and more complicated than upgrading machines imo) -- but that's mostly because of compositing."
vfx,2yopna,DoctorOctagone,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, i's going to take more than a few minutes to dig into CGRU! But I love tinkering. That's interesting.   Right now, personally, I think our problem is lack of proper time to optimize our renders. So currently,it's a bit of a ""throw money at it"" panic. But that being said, we don't have enough money to be rendering everything on the cloud.  Our file server definitely needs an upgrade - so there's probably IO issues there - I've been patching it together for years. I'll start some monitoring.

How many processors / cores do your current desktops have that you are using as render nodes?  (Don't count hyperthreading, it doesn't help with rendering).  If your current desktops are single processor quad cores, you'd get a lot out of switching them out of dual processor hexa-cores (or even dual quad cores).  Also, check to make sure your machines have enough RAM.  I guess also check to see that your network switches are all gigabit, same goes for the router, and check that the ethernet cables are all cat5e or cat6.  Good luck!"

vfx,2yopna,DoctorOctagone,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"With no RAID, all your clients are fighting for a single spindle over a single Gigabit connection.  You may not see much benefit from adding a bunch of new CPU's, because I would pretty much guarantee you are having IO issues already.  Something like a 10 Gb attached 5 spindle RAID would almost certainly still be an IO bottleneck for a lot of typical VFX workloads with ~ 20 clients (Artists + Render boxes + any other traffic like backup).  Without seeing exact traffic on your system and knowing what you are rendering, it's hard to give specific advice, but storage is usually the most important part of scaling.  Do you know what the typical amount of data used in a render is?  Typical number of files being hit?  Is the software installed locally on the machines, or is that running off the network as well?  Can you monitor total traffic on the renders and see how that compares to the amount of data?  (Often times some textures and stuff will be read once early in the render into a cache, but then needed again later in the render, so they get read multiple times.  This can result in network traffic being 2-3x the data size for some only-semi-pathological renders)  And of course, are you sure that the existing render nodes aren't swapping?  (That's the renderfarm equivalent of ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?)"

vfx,2yopna,DoctorOctagone,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:02:20 2015 UTC,"iotop is a really handy utility on Linux that you can run on the server to see if any processes are spending most of their time waiting for IO.  You can also see what your throughput is.  You may already be using it but if not, you may want to play with it.  It's like ""top"" but for I/O.  Hence the name.  It's real time, and doesn't require any setup, so it's one of my go-to tools for looking at a system ""live"" while users are complaining.  ""Aren't swapping"" in the sense of running out of RAM because the renders are so large that the renderer allocates more memory than is physically in the machine and using Virtual Memory/Paging/Swapping to disk and thrashing horribly.  Nothing you described specifically indicates that this is what's happening, it's literally just a question I ask about every farm where someone complains about slow renders.  Often times render boxes are a little older than workstations so they have less RAM, or they have quite a bit of RAM but are configured to try to run multiple render jobs at the same time.  Things that seem okay on the workstations wind up going slow on the farm as a result."

Right now we don't have a Render Farm, I am running everything through a network render - 9 workstations during the day - 11 at night. We only have 2 full timers right now. Everything except the server is the same age.   All the workstation RAM seems to peak at half during renders.   I'm starting to feel like for the short term, at least, I will have to stick with doing part of the render on the cloud - and start working from the Server out.

vfx,2yopna,alatteri,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like your server situation is not ideal.  For a small shop you could get something like a Dell T320 with a decent raid card like a Perc H710.  Then setup the raid as Raid 10.  Apparently Raid 5 has rebuild problems with large disks, which is why Raid 10 sounds like the way to go.  You could run linux on this box, but I'm not linux savvy, so I'd just go with a windows server.  Since you have under 25 machines, you could go with Windows Server Essentials and not have to buy CALs.  The other things to do would be to put a 10GbE card into your server and connect your server to a 10GbE switch (netgear makes cheap ones).

It is a standalone solution to lighting and rendering for pipeline implementation and has a similar workflow and design to Katana. To simply state it is functionally more than just a rendering solution, it is a pipeline solution.   I am not a fan of blender, all of my experiences with it have been torturous and I personally do not view full feature packages as good implementation points for specific jobs. This was designed with one purpose in mind to be a backend pipeline tool, which is an important high functioning tool that the open source community doesn't really have access to. This is more of a tool designed with high functioning high flow facilities in mind rather than a singular person who needs a swiss army knife tool set."

vfx,2ym0j4,breikogz,2,Tue Mar 10 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"If you are doing this with objects crossing over the top, using regular images you will never get a perfect result unless you use deep compositing.   If you have a typical RGBA render with depth either sperate in on the same exr, the basic workflow is easy. You can use a grade node to create a 'key' of the depth values you wish to isolate. Just set the black and whitepoint knobs to be the back and front values respectively. Then clamp the result. Instant depth matte.   You will quickly see two issues:   anti-aliasing. : you will have pixel values that are attpenting to represent the edge between objects at two depths  motion blur: as above but caused by the post process vector blur applied to the blurred pixels.   Deep will solve all this as it allows you to have mutliple depth samples per pixel and therefore can resolve colour value of each pixel from various depths."
vfx,2ym0j4,aneks,2,Tue Mar 10 23:11:28 2015 UTC,You can have a look at how Deep works here in Robin Hollander's video using example workflow from Rise of the Apes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19w3vkFp5X0
vfx,2ym0j4,aneks,2,Tue Mar 10 23:17:22 2015 UTC,"OP is asking about depth passes, not deep renders.  Zslice plus a regular crop gives you a truncated pyramid that can be good enough.   As others mentioned, be aware that you will likely run into aliasing issues, as depth passes are limited to one sample per pixel. Sometimes it's worth it to render your depth pass at 2x res."

Thank you very much for your answers guys ;)"
vfx,2ym0j4,wrosecrans,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"If it's the only think at a certain depth range, you can probably just do a luma key on the Z channel.  Like an object in the foreground clearly separated from something in the background.  That you can use the alpha resulting from the key to do whatever tweaks you need specific to that object.  It can get more complicated depending on the particular shot, and what exactly you want to do to it."
vfx,2ym0j4,aneks,-2,Wed Mar 11 00:36:25 2015 UTC,Sorry to diagree but I think you are missing the point of a lumakey versus the option I suggested. firstly there is no 'lumakey' function in Nuke. you can use the Keyer and set it to luminance but its not really the best way to do what the OP is trying to acheive.  the keyer node in Nuke really is just a wrapper that performs the exact operation I described with a secondary control for 'falloff'. however the limitation of primarily being focued on values between 0-1. Using a grade as I described will allow you to deal with BOTH negative numbers and values way in excess of 1. Also its a cleaner compositing operation.   Either way the range is irrelavent to the issues I brought up. You can try various pixel filtering solutions to try and get a better fit of the edge pixels but if you render uses ANY anti-aliasing you wont be able to solve the issue of shared pixel depth.

For a cooling fan component of the robot’s engine block, Weta Workshop drew on a surprising material. “In building models,” explains Leri Greer, “there’s always been this thing for putting macaroni in there somewhere. We didn’t have any in the building so they actually got ramen noodles, spray painted a brick of the noodles and put that inside the engine.”  “For that cooling fan,” adds Denton, “it was just an impossible thing to make out of a bent bit of wire. It was in the middle of all of these metal components which you would never see the inside of, but we thought how are we going to make this? So we got five blocks of ramen noodles, spray-painted them black and then painted them silver and stuck them in the middle.”   OP made it sounds like it had a more integral role, IMO."

I would say that it's almost definitely AE that is giving you an incorrect representation.  It almost looks as if your viewing the raw linear data in AE, with no LUT. This is wrong.  To confirm, open the exr in nuke and set the viewer to None. Does it look like AE then?"
vfx,2ycx13,hydrogenjoule,2,Sun Mar 8 23:01:34 2015 UTC,Well said. To add to this and hopefully fix your issue you can use a colorspace node. Set your in to linear and out to sRGB or in sRGB and out to linear. Also just moving the gamma up 2.2 or down .454 on a grade node.  You can also just set your write node to write your QuickTime either linear or sRGB in the little drop down menu. It defaults to sRGB.

vfx,2ycx13,hydrogenjoule,2,Thu Mar 12 08:22:43 2015 UTC,"Negative values are rarely great news, they're not physically meaningful except in very specific circumstances.

vfx,2ycx13,BurnetRhoades,4,Fri Mar 13 22:22:41 2015 UTC,looks like you're not working in the right colorspace. Nuke applies a LUT to its viewer to mimic what your final non linear output will be. That's why it matches QuickTime.    You must not have the same lut applied in after effects hence why it looks different.
vfx,2ycx13,BurnetRhoades,4,Sun Mar 8 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"Before rendering to Quicktime, or any non-float format, append a Levels to clamp off values over 1.0 and under 0.0 and your problem is (should be) solved.  Sub-zero and ""overbrite"" values are only useful for specific effects and uses and should be removed before final output (or after they're no longer needed), generally, unless final output is for high dynamic range viewing or what you're doing is ultimately an intermediate step."
vfx,2ycx13,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I applied a levels adjustment, clamping the values. It creates the bad effect shown in the 2nd image.

There are lots of ways to cause problems with the color management settings in After Effects.    I use overbright values a lot for glows and such and don't get the rolloff you're getting in your example, but I do see other odd things sometimes with linear space because not all of AE is able to work in float and then some effects don't seem like they work right in linear-float.  In the opening titles to one of my reels here: https://vimeo.com/69862672  ...the bright stuff is well over 1.0 but I just loaded up the file that made it and I'm applying a Levels with Clip to Output Black/White set to On and get no visual change at all between with and without, in a linear-float managed timeline, and sRGB profile Working Space.    If it makes any difference, I'm applying this effect to the output of my comp that actually creates the logo, because I also apply some jitter and weave to simulate the look of telecine'd ""opticals"".  So my main comp becomes a pre-comp (with Levels applied along with x/y transforms) in what I call the ""output comp""."

If that's the case you could render a mov with an alpha, or add a black solid as background and tweak the effects."
vfx,2ycx13,sancampos,2,Mon Mar 9 02:01:49 2015 UTC,There is definitely something amiss with their configuration.  They should not be seeing a shift in their viewport when they apply the clamp to values with something like Levels.  The consistency internally and equal but different consistency with external results points to a settings problem.    My money is on having no working space profile.  Maybe.  But that's just a guess based on the symptoms.  It's going to be more beneficial to them in the long run to get a real methodology solution and not fall into unnecessary workarounds.

For example: People said leave Houdini alone. Very good advice, but if you ever want to get into FX for commercials/films it is the best thing to learn once you get your basics down.

vfx,2y9pd3,BurnetRhoades,2,Sun Mar 8 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"Fusion won't take over because its free.  About 60% of the studios aren't on Windows.  Additionally, the investment in nuke has already been made.  Not to mention there are very very few artists trained on fusion.  Anyone who was using it, forgot it and moved on.    Last, Fusion is only free at HD, as will be nuke.  Basically nobody exclusively works at HD anymore.  Even the TV shops do oversized from time to time."
vfx,2y9pd3,sabreToothBucket,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"The only other node-based compositor out there that ever had a chance against Nuke is gone now, thanks to Apple."
vfx,2y9pd3,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to Shake? If so, the product was dead in the water before apple bought it. Yes, we all had high hopes of Apple improving it, but the development was stagnant for a few years before apple got it.  Nuke came out and gave us everything we requested from shake within the first two years. We were starving for software features."
vfx,2y9pd3,sabreToothBucket,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"Shake could have had those features as well if Apple had ever been serious about pro software development.   And it wasn't dead since the move by Apple seriously screwed up a lot of small shops who were based on it as an alternative to Discrete products.  Fusion was a joke to anyone that had ever been through Digital Domain and saw Shake as the only next-best-thing out there.  It was better than internal only node-based compositors developed by Sony and R+H.  The thing you need to understand about Nuke is it has the features that the artists at Digital Domain wanted and needed, not the rest of the world.  The Foundry, apparently, can and will do less with it than Apple could have done with Shake."
vfx,2y9pd3,anteris,0,Tue Mar 10 11:47:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe we have different views then. Clearly we do.   Shake was definitely stagnant. Compositing software was stagnant. For high end comping work, the support for the software died before apple bought it. Getting a list of new features or updates was just not happening. Fusion wasn't an option with windows only and Toxik was a joke (it's now free.)   Apple didn't screw anyone over as shake could be used for years after the buy out. This gave people ample time to move on (which they already should have been since shake was stagnant.) If they were still using shake after Nuke progressed they were screwing themselves over due to not being able to attract talent who wanted to use Nuke. This was a serious issue that made it easier to attract people I was hiring for (in a team comp of 70+) at the facility. We were getting people to our facility purely because the other was still using shake.  I guess we can agree to disagree on this one as we clearly come from two different view points. Good luck out there! :)"

vfx,2y9pd3,anteris,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is, I was speaking in the past tense mostly.   At the time that Shake and Nuke were both available there were no other viable alternatives.  You would hear about some little shop somewhere of guys using Fusion but it wasn't really on the radar of shops and artists doing work of much note.  After Effects was the next step down, if you couldn't have/use Nuke and didn't have Shake.  I've got to work up the courage to actually try to use Natron on a real shot where if necessary I'll be able to redo the shot in AfterEffects if things don't work out.  The place I'm at now is an Adobe house with one license of Nuke for our lead comper.  I would much rather use something that's a clone of Nuke than After Effects but I know, however much I dislike its workflow, I can do what I need to do in AE without question.  I'm not going to run one of the readily available Nuke cracks because all of the original, real authors of Nuke are friends of mine (I finaled some of the first ever Nuke composites) and nearly $10K for a personal piece of software just isn't gonna happen.  I'd have a hard time giving that kind of cash to The Foundry anyhow.   So I'm definitely interested in Natron and hope it's got legs."

It reminds me a little of Cineon but that could just be the horizontal nature of its nodal tree.  It seems somewhat unfriendly though, compared to Nuke or After Effects.  There's also Natron, which is an open source clone of Nuke.  It looks kinda interesting though it's not nearly as full featured."
vfx,2y9pd3,Iyellkhan,2,Sat Mar 7 22:14:29 2015 UTC,Fusion compositor here  Fusion is a fine compositing software. It does some things better than Nuke just as Nuke does some things better than Fusion. An Artist that knows either of these software's can pick up the other in a day or two due to there similar work flow.  where Nuke beat out Fusion was is marketing and updating there software with regular point releases.  with Black Magic recently acquiring Fusion hopefully we will start to see some cool new updates from them.

vfx,2y9pd3,Bizlitistical,3,Sun Mar 8 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"That's a great suggestion Fires. Thank you for the insight.  At the moment, I'm in a very lucky position I would say.  I've got full access to the softwares listed so I'm just trying to learn as much as possible and really get learning and practicing.  I currently have AE and I've used it quite a lot however like you said, it is less powerful. I'm working on moving on to a more advanced engine and going from 2.5 to true 3d has been a lot to take in so far in terms of all the technology possible but it's a fun challenge. Thank you again for clarifying these programs for me Fire."
vfx,2y9pd3,sancampos,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"getting experience with AE as well as node based compositors like Nuke its probably your best place to start if you're most interested in finishing/finaling shots for the time being. if you can get access to a Flame station, it has some of the top tools for handling the most common needs from 2d to 3d (though they're super expensive so its the sort of thing you need to know someone who has one).   Maya is one of those programs that you can go 10 years down the rabit hole and still be learning things. if you want to get into hard surface modeling / texturing and all that, hit up some fxphd classes on the basics. if you really are digging it and seem to have a nack for it, look to get a previs gig or entry level cg gig. it'll be the fastest way to learn what production pipelines typically need.  above all, always reference real things while you're working and developing your skills. learn how to light with real lights, as it will inform how you light CG models. its somewhat strait forward to make something look like really good CG, but when you cut with live action it bumps. context is everything. while playing with compositing tools, use real things in your comps as much as you can (even if you're just practicing with stills. star wars toys are almost studio scale and you can snap pictures in your garage for comping lol)"
vfx,2y9pd3,dogstardied,3,Sat Mar 7 21:23:09 2015 UTC,"C4D, Maya, 3Ds Max and Softimage are all 3D packages. They allow you to model, texture, light and render, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses. 3DS Max has a lot of great plugins like RayFire and FumeFX, allowing you to simulate physics, whereas C4D is geared more around motion graphic animation, out of these programs it ultimately depends on your personal preferences, but Maya appears to be the most popular for Visual Effects.  Houdini is a little different from these packages, as it's focused on procedural effects. Think liquid, smoke and rigidbody simulation, and generally wouldn't be used if you wanted to model a building for instance, but may be used to generate physics for destruction or smoke coming from it.  Modo, again is different from the core 3D packages like C4D and Maya, and it's heavily focused on modelling and content creation. I can't really expand on this one because I've never used it.  Again, VueXstream is another specialised program that excels at creating giant landscapes with millions of polygons in the scene, and offers specialised tools for generating oceans, clouds and terrain.  Nuke is towards the end of the pipeline, it's a compositing program, much like After Effects, but it uses nodes instead of layers, allowing much more flexibility. You'd use this program to put your final image together that was modelled in Modo, rendered in 3DS Max, with clouds from Vue and smoke simulations from Houdini (for example)."
vfx,2y9pd3,banecroft,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:54:12 2015 UTC,"Ahh, Thank you so much Cheese for the indepth reply. I really appreciate it. That makes a lot more sense to me now and I can organize it a little better in my head.   Would it be recommended for me to learn C4D/Maya/3Ds Max at the same time? Or should I specify in one? Your last paragraph was very very helpful!!! I'm beginning to see a clearer picture as to how this all fits together when it comes to a project. It's been difficult getting a simple and comprehensive idea of this over the web so I am very grateful Cheese.   Given this new information, should I learn:    modeling: modo  Render: C4D/Maya/3Ds/Softimage (choosing one?)   I've also heard V-ray is very good for rendering, do you have an opinion on this?   FX: Houdini, Vue, light wave   Compositing: Nuke  Would you have any other recommendations?   Would you be able to elaborate on motion graphics in general?   I remember seeing this and I just thought it was so cool:  Iron man vfx: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vurY4pwsIG8  For my purposes, I'm trying to learn how to go from the beginning to end and make an effect even if it is just basic at first, that's what I'm shooting for. I also understand that they had multiple studios working on this so I know I probably won't be able to make something so complex but even on a basic level, I think it'd be super cool!   Please let me know if you have any more suggestions, thank you so much again. :)"
vfx,2y9pd3,sancampos,5,Sat Mar 7 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"No no no!!! Don´t learn C4D/Maya/3Ds Max at the same time!!!  Start learning ONE of the 3d packages (C4D, Maya, 3d Max, or even Blender) and ONE compositing program (Nuke or After Effects). This way you'll get a feel for the entire process and you´ll notice what you like the most, what you feel more inclined to do, etc.  Leave Houdini and Vue alone for now. ZBrush and Mudbox are the most common specialized programs for modeling, but I would recommend staying away from them at first too.  You have a lot to learn with just one 3d package and one compositing program, and you can do lots of cool things with just that.  I would also recommend you learn to draw, it´s incredibly helpful! Nothing fancy, just being able to draw something another human being could understand. It also help a lot with thinking and planning.  And another recommendation, once you start animating, is learning the 12 principles of animation."

vfx,2y9pd3,sancampos,2,Sat Mar 7 21:29:54 2015 UTC,"just start with Blender. it does enough out of the box that you'll learn all the concepts. modeling, particles, simulations, compositing. mix them all together without jumping around several different programs. if you can model, light, render and composite a scene in blender you can do it with anything else."

vfx,2y7wm7,jayelaych,6,Sat Mar 7 06:21:11 2015 UTC,"Metal has very little diffuse and is mostly reflection. This means you need an environment or hdri to reflect, and make sure you are using fresnel in your reflection. You could do some research on basic studio lighting as well. It usually involves three point lighting on a white cyc. Lastly, motion blur is important with fast movement like that.   When artists are just starting CG I recommend they just keep making tons of projects. New projects bring new challenges and you end up learning more and progressing faster.

You may need to reduce the number of threads if adding another thread will use all the RAM in a machine and cause it to start swapping."

Haven't used RF in a while, but I believe a single core is better for sims in general. In Houdini, we can slice up the sim and distribute each section to either a machine or separate cores. In RF,I believe you can do the same - at least with the Hybrido system."

vfx,2xwor3,sancampos,10,Wed Mar 4 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"Legion here.   Hello u/sancampos. We did get your links today, and there's some good stuff on there. Thanks for sharing.   A little about us, since we came up in the conversation. We are primarily a remote VFX facility. Our workforce is all over the world. The one thing that they all have in common is that they are recommended to us. Part of making a model like this work is knowing who you are getting. Part of knowing who you are getting, is to get them from people you trust.   We have a folder full names of people who have cold contacted us, and we keep all of it on file. We add most to a database so that we can track them.   Our goal is to provide senior artists around the world, the ability to do VFX from wherever they are. This means we have artists in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US to name a few. Part of the reason we choose only senior artists is that they often will not take on more than they can handle. They are pragmatic and know their own limitations. They can also make good money in this model.   We've got a few different models for pay. Some shows we hire by the week and we pay a fair rate in USD for an artist and their kit. Other shows we bid out shots to the client and pay the artist what was bid. If it is bid for 8 hours and it's something you can do in 2... you still make the 8 hour price. On the flip side it could take you 16... Still the 8 hour price.   We've been getting metrics from all the data on the shows that we've done, so that we can make sure that we bid more accurately each time. Our goal is always to have the artists come in under. We do not let the artists bid the shots directly. There is no race to the bottom at the artist level. We wont pit a 20 year veteran with a family in LA, against a 2 year veteran in rural Wisconsin. We pay what we pay, and you, as an artist, have a choice as to whether you want to take the work.  If you have any questions about us or the industry as a whole, we would be happy to answer them. If you know someone who works with us, perhaps they can put in a recommendation for you. We are looking to grow and, at least, double our number of artists by the end of this year.   Have a great night. Thanks for mentioning us u/kyoseki."

vfx,2xwor3,ghoest,2,Fri Mar 6 09:57:32 2015 UTC,"A variety. We just wrapped on Eye Candy for MTV. That was a lot of compositing and design work. We've got a lot of compositing going on, but there are a number of shows where we are testing out our 3D pipeline.   We are planning on working with the creator of White Tiger Legend, to help finish out the lighting and comp on the animated feature.

If you've been in a lead spot for a while, then you should do well in your interview :) Have your demo reel breakdown handy just in case they have questions about specific shots.

vfx,2xv236,Greystoke1337,5,Wed Mar 4 15:18:56 2015 UTC,You mentioned you're currently a lead. It's important to manage your expectations of what role you will be offered. In the majority of cases being a lead in smaller companies and countries (smaller as in vfx work terms) means that you will likely be an upper junior to low end mid level artist in the larger vfx houses. Often you'll need retraining too.   It's worth keeping this in mind for your interview and the attitude that you project during your interview. Don't play down your skill set by any means.... but expect that you won't be placed as a lead.

Also talk about your expriences in your old job and what you've been doing in general.

You could ask the company how their lead structure is set up. Know your showreel breakdown. Think of any tools/methods you use and basic procedures.   Which country are you applying to?"

vfx,2xswbh,186394,2,Tue Mar 3 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you!  I've been searching for this for weeks."
vfx,2xswbh,BurnetRhoades,3,Tue Mar 3 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"It was answered below, ""Chromatic aberration"".  To do it you can either buy a plug-in or ""rolling your own"" isn't too difficult in something like After Effects.  You basically apply scale, offset and potentially blurriness independently to R,G,B.  The After Effects paradigm is pretty cumbersome for this thing but the cleanest way I've found is to make three copies of your footage, on each do a channel shuffle so that one is R,0,0 the next 0,G,0 and the third 0,0,B with the ""0"" representing black or blank channels.  Set the transfer mode of the top two to ADD and this re-combines the three layers.  Pre-compose this.  Jump into the precomp and on the copy with just the Red channel un-lock the scale parameter so that you can scale X and Y independently and increase scale slightly in X only.  In the layer with only the Blue information do the same thing but make it slightly smaller in X only.  You should start to see how the effect works.  You can play around with doing a slight blur to one of them, giving a slight X,Y offset to one.  You could even sharpen one of them while leaving the other two alone.  While this might seem strange, you can see this sort of phenomenon in all kinds of natural photography.  It's generally a component of how good (or not good) a lens is.  Lower quality lenses are going to exhibit this sort of behavior if you look at an image's separate R,G,B and the effect tends to be more pronounced out at the edges of frame, because most lenses are sharper in the center.    Some more subtle effects like this would also occur at the emulsion level of film, where records could end up slightly misaligned or one, generally the Red, seemingly at a slightly different size.    Grab a still from your favorite film, the higher resolution the better, and you can see for yourself by looking at the image's separate R,G,B and you could also download a copy of the Game of Thrones opening a still or the clip in After Effects and look at each channel independently to dial in your effect to their levels."
vfx,2xswbh,ElderHatesman,2,Wed Mar 4 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome answer - thank you.  I've tried something similar with a still image in photoshop and found it was pretty simple.   I'll have to pull up some footage to test this on in AE.  The effect is something I've seen through the edge of my glasses, and in some low-quality photos, but only recently have I seen this done intentionally with interesting results."

vfx,2xswbh,BurnetRhoades,0,Tue Mar 3 17:08:09 2015 UTC,"You see this effect applied a lot to CG and motion graphics done in Europe especially, the high end stuff.  MK12 does it a lot too and you see it in all of the overlay graphics and comic elements, titles, etc. all through the  Scott Pilgrim film.  It has the effect of ""taking the curse off"" a lot of digital work.  In the case of an all-CGI scene, like the opening to Game of Thrones it gives the feel of something that was actually photographed through a lens.  While technically an ""artifact"" from an academic or stills portrait photography standpoint, these are the sorts of things people talk about when they say ""character"" of a lens.    Vintage lenses tend to exhibit more of these effects and they've become more popular to shoot with on digital cameras because digital cameras tend to feel so synthetic, antiseptic and discrete, especially if you're using modern lenses designed by engineers for digital cameras.  Generally you get better imagery when you combine super sharp, perfect lenses with film and vintage, less-than-perfect lenses with digital.    Adding this effect to CGI makes it feel more analog."
vfx,2xswbh,sabreToothBucket,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:45:09 2015 UTC,"Digital cameras still use the same lenses that film cameras do..... So you get the same chromab.

What's happening a lot these days is less experienced compositors go overboard with it to make the comp look ""cool."" Too much and it instantly looks fake. I ask my team to reduce it a lot more often than you think.   Or, you can add it to create a style similar to mentioned above."
vfx,2xswbh,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:39:45 2015 UTC,"You don't get exactly the same chromab because digital cameras don't see the light focused onto their sensors in the same way that film emulsion does.  Generally speaking, lenses for digital cameras are technically supposed to be sharper.  Digital cameras will see more chromab, generally, than film cameras.  Because they're different.  ""Digiprime"" isn't just a catchphrase or bit of marketing, it actually denotes an engineering difference in the lens.  Digital cameras can still use the same lenses that film cameras do.  This is where personal choice comes into play and whether you decide to follow engineering and its pursuit of a perfect, artifact free and flavorless representation of reality, or, using something that gives your digital imagery some flavor.  ""Or, you can add it to create a style similar to mentioned above.""  Well, it certainly looks cool.  It doesn't look fake though, if that's what you're implying."

Over-complicating can also get you into a pickle, both routes are valid where appropriate."

Agisoft photoscan is used near the start to take multiple photos of the amputated arm and convert them into a 3d model.  The shot is then tracked in Pftrack to give the artists a 3d version of the camera move as well as capture the motion of Elijah Wood's arm to make it easy to match the movement with the 3d arm later. It looks like all the 3d animation was done in cinema 4d, ( i didn't notice any houdini but I might have missed it) and I couldn't tell what software the final shot was composited together in, but I would guess at nuke.

Instead of faking your way out of it with particles (which is going to be amazingly difficult to do with rain), why not use the real deal? Use masking and tracking to cut out some of the rain on the ground in the foreground, and subtly superimpose it on the ground in the background with a low opacity. Maybe use the drops in the puddle from after the car leaves the scene, and screen it onto the asphalt, so you still get the shine from the headlights on the ground. As for the headlights, I can't tell you exactly how to do it, but I would mess with volumetric lights or the radial blur filter to subtly hint that the headlights are brightening the rain in front of them."

vfx,2x642r,kyoseki,2,Thu Feb 26 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"While that's a plus at the front door a lot of places don't even give you the opportunity to do that.  Small shops might require more ""cross-training"" but lighting and shading tend to be more aligned with compositing as you get to higher levels of production.  Within modeling there are several ways to still stand out because few modelers tend to be equally proficient at both organic and hard surface modeling.  Even within organic modeling, modeling for efficient characters is an art within an art.  Modeling animated characters for animation versus creatures and people for photorealism requires considerable skill."

Math is not software dependent, neither is an aesthetic eye, if you can light & shade well in one package, transitioning to others isn't particularly hard. Good lighting & shading is based on the same principles regardless of the software used."
vfx,2x642r,kyoseki,0,Thu Feb 26 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"You're talking about the way it should be, the way it used to be.

It seems like games would be similar?  I come from an arnold based studio and we actively train people to get up to speed with it. If someone knows how to light with gi and any modern lighting techniques it usually doesn't take more than a day for the talented artists to get up to speed. Lighting consistently has very proprietary pipeline tools and it seems like most studios expect to train people a bit.

Fifteen years ago work for commercials was decimated but visual effects overall was still very strong.  There were still several big companies operating in the USA and all of the best work was done exclusively in the USA.  Not anymore.  There's one large house here, the shells of two others and a bunch of small and medium houses where you shouldn't ever bother bringing in the usual knick-knacks to make your desk feel your own because you won't be there long enough.  There's likely more work than ever in games but even here, it's not stable anymore.  Be prepared to move.  edit: but I would agree, if you're going to specialize, modelling is a good specialty.  It was considered an entry-level position when I got started and I did it for a while.  I have no real patience for it anymore but I deeply respect those that are good at it and wish some of the tools available today were available back then.    It's very portable.  It's maybe the most portable skill set to have moving between industries utilizing CG tools.  Animating in Maya is also a good ""generic"" skill to have though there are all sorts of specialties within this that nobody is really that good at doing multiples of, compared with modeling.  And for lighting/shading, there is no truly dominant renderer right now even within visual effects much less trying to pick something with value across multiple industries."

vfx,2x2sy8,Luminanc3,4,Wed Feb 25 04:52:17 2015 UTC,"While there are some areas of VFX where drawing is more useful (concept art, for example) it is by no means essential in every area.

You can also look into the technical fields (more comp-sci or programming) like TD or pipeline TD.  Unless you want to design (character design, vis-dev, production design) or be a story artist, then you don't have to draw well.  It always helps to know how to draw, and it's something you can learn.  I know cg character animators who can't draw well. And I know cg character animators who are also amazing at 2D animation."

I know a programmer who did this after being inspired by an online portfolio. The portfolio belonged to an artist who started out not-so-great and ended up very, very good after one year of practicing daily sketches.   This programmer couldn't draw a circle when he started (not exaggerating) and by the end of the year he was drawing very decent stuff with good color, shading and composition. He even did a couple of good portraits of people he knew.  You don't need these skills to do competent vfx work, but they do come in handy, especially color theory & composition."

Mainly because developers tend to work for the facility as opposed to having show based contracts, and it takes so damn long to train a new dev hire that by the time you have your team up and running, you can't really justify letting them go. And it's harder to find good candidates. Then again it's like any other job in the industry. If the studio goes down, everyone goes."

Like almost anything you can, of course, recreate what it does with a series of layers and this was, likely, how the effect was prototyped.  But I get angry now every time I have to create yet another pre-comp just to accomplish a simple effect because the paradigm is so bad for anything beyond A-over-B-over-C."

vfx,2x06a7,rjq,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:31:52 2015 UTC,I believe that it is just boosting the saturation on the less saturated areas of the image. To achieve that you can do a saturation key and pipe that into the mask input of a saturation node.

But the whole point of VFX is to deflect attention away from an effect and onto the characters and story. VFX are neat, but they're super duper lame without a story.  Spy dude wouldn't take his mask off that way. He'd take it off--half thinking of something else--while walking into the kitchen. Or he'd take it off while looking in a mirror, making sure it wasn't still glued to his lips or eyelids.  Good job with the computer stuff! Think about your direction and performances and story. Yes, even in a little test or reel like this. Think of what a potential employer or client or what someone's Nana would say about any video you put out there.  But I'm just a guy, you know?

vfx,2wwz5i,ProfessorBort,2,Tue Feb 24 14:36:49 2015 UTC,I think you have a good start but you let the first shot hang on the frame of his hand at his chin for about a nanosecond longer than it should.  It should be a fluid motion and currently it just kinda gives away your effect.
vfx,2wwz5i,ltjpunk387,2,Tue Feb 24 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"It could be argued that the hand moving up could be the action, but either way it is still a jarring edit. Apart from the action itself being strange, like /u/Is_it_really_art pointed out, the primary reason for that is that the angle of the before, during, and after shots are too similar. Sometimes it's acceptable to do this if you change the focal length enough, but it isn't different enough. You also switched to a locked-off shot when the rest of the scene is handheld, and it feels out of place. With an effect attached to a not-locked-off human face, what was gained by going on sticks?  The effect itself I thought was well done, but it needs some help fitting the shot into the rest of the scene."

Its a test.. proof of concept? fine.. but you could make it better. Also you could feather the first face into the mask he's wearing (if the mask isn't totally wrong) to get more of the wrinkling of his face on the mask.   As far as cutting on the action.. dont listen to em'. Cutting on the action can give away that you're doing an effect. Its like trying to cheat. The dopest shots are when you can clearly see what the fuck is happening and then people are like ""Oh shit."" Its like good fight scenes, see whats happening... dont just cut from arm to the face being punched...   but yeah, you can do better. Just finesse it more. If the real mask doesn't match the color you can CC it a bit ... you ae mask feather and such. good job."

vfx,2wund6,petersid7,12,Mon Feb 23 07:32:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed... I've said it before, I'll say it again - Apes was benchmark, Interstellar wasn't. All nominees were worthy - but Apes set a level that all other films will aspire to reach in realism, Interstellar, while beautiful, was 'just' a well executed, clever idea... that said, the Oscars is hardly a democracy, and hardly favours industry professionals - but the general consensus in this studio at least is that Apes was robbed (twice).   Side note: It would be great if Academy voting had weighting - Directors guild member votes count for 2 in Directing, Actors guild for 2 in acting, VES members for 2 in VFX and Anim, etc...  Classic example of the better movie winning over the better VFX in a VFX category - The Perfect Storm set the benchmark for water sims in features for years... it lost to Gladiator."
vfx,2wund6,barelypixelated,14,Mon Feb 23 10:56:57 2015 UTC,"Interstellar' visual effects was accomplished using a variety of techniques. Not just 100% CG. Miniatures were used, in camera effects as well. Not to mention DNeg had to work side by side with NASA scientists to develop the software that could actually simulate and  render the images of a black hole.   While Apes looked incredible, it was simply excellent execution of already proven and practiced techniques.   I think interstellar was a more technically challenging accomplishment, and pushed more boundaries than Apes. I think they deserve the award more."
vfx,2wund6,AdriansVFX,3,Mon Feb 23 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"Debatable... it would seem the importance of the scientific discoveries made for Interstellar is mainly PR, and was vastly overestimated. Food for thoughts, this paper is 20 years old: Research paper       and as is the animation that comes with it: Link to video  Double Negative did not even exist at the time (created in 1998) This is also described by Jean Pierre Luminet (pioneer of black hole visualisation) as ""more accurately showing the phenomenon as it also portrays effects such as the Doppler effect, which were left out in Interstellar for aesthetics reason""  The point being that yes Interstellar is pretty, but arguably not scientifically revolutionary (nor accurate for that matter)  Also given the amount of RnD and Siggraph papers Weta is able to produce each years, I am dubious of the validity of the statement ""Interstellar pushed more boundaries than Apes"".  That being said, every nominee deserved to win in their own rights, and Interstellar looked nice."
vfx,2wund6,TurtleOnCinderblock,9,Tue Feb 24 07:11:43 2015 UTC,"Really?  Having more than half the cast in a live action film be completely CG isn't as impressive as compositing miniatures and cg spaceships together? I think I could go with how scientifically ""accurate"" it was might be a decent excuse, but I would guarantee Apes was more technically difficult. You couldn't have made Apes 7 years ago, you could have made Interstellar."
vfx,2wund6,LazyCon,5,Mon Feb 23 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"You couldn't have made Apes 7 years ago   Let's not forget though, that Avatar (the James Cameron one) came out 6 years ago and had at least half the cast be CG along with a majority of the environments. By no means am I trying to denigrate Apes, but I think it could have possibly been done at least 6 years ago."

vfx,2wund6,LazyCon,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:29:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all discrediting the work on Apes. Absolutely very technically challenging. It's just nothing new. They did a great job on the first instalment, and this is simply an upgraded version of those effects. The path they needed to follow to achieve what was needed was more obvious than that of interstellar.   The technology that was used to create many of interstellar a effects simply did not exist in ANY form before the smart people at DNeg and NASA collaborated to make it so. Boundaries of technology and filmmaking were pushed further in my opinion.   Both were excellent, and enormous accomplishments though. Both teams should be hugely proud of their work."
vfx,2wund6,AdriansVFX,5,Mon Feb 23 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed that they were both amazing feats of artistry and technical skills.  It's a tough choice, but for me the actual vfx side of the scale leans towards Apes for me. I mean, the understanding of what they wanted to create was amazing in Interstellar, but I don't think that them creating it in the end was a huge technical achievement comparatively.  I did enjoy Interstellar more in the end though and they had to give it something after it got robbed of Best Score."
vfx,2wund6,LazyCon,-1,Mon Feb 23 20:59:00 2015 UTC,"You do know they wrote a render engine that takes accurately represents relativistic effects, at Imax resolutions, right? If we're talking technically difficult, I think this takes the biscuit."

vfx,2wund6,TurtleOnCinderblock,8,Mon Feb 23 11:59:01 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Interstellar was amazing because I couldn't tell what where the props stopped and the VFX began. That, and the black hole has had a significant impact on the scientific community, which is super cool."

My jobs submit to BB but then immediately fail, giving me this error code: Error message: Cmdjob adapter: Create Cmdjob process error:5 I've been looking around the web to try and find a solution but I haven't found anything yet. I believe it's a permissions thing again, but everything is shared and accessible to all users. I'm running Windows 7. Any ideas?"
vfx,2wtc31,phunkaeg,2,Thu Feb 26 04:39:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I haven't had that problem before.  Do you ever have problems when you're just creating new files, or deleting anything... Like a check for permissions?  I've noticed in the past with Windows 7 that my administrator user still needed to request permissions for everything it did. There was some stuff up in the user security settings which I couldn't understand how to fix. which went away after upgrading to 8.1.  An easy way to identify if this is the problem is to create a new user with administrator privileges and try submitting to backburner. If it works then it may be that you just need to work from the new administrator account."

Is this issue occurring even if you just run the manager locally, and start a server on the same machine? Or only if you're trying to render via the network.  Are your projects saved locally or on a mapped network location? I have noticed that if you run an autodesk product as administrator then you loose access to mapped network drives, (as in they don't show up within the application)  Make sure you're not running backburner with elevated privillages (as administrator) if your project files on on a mapped drive."

vfx,2woyq7,iofthebeholder,7,Sat Feb 21 23:30:47 2015 UTC,Didn't he specifically say that if he gets funded on kickstarter he'll make it a full-feature movie rather than a 30 min short? And if he doesnt get the crowdfunded he's just gonna release the 30 min worth of footage they managed to shoot and mesh together. That's how I understood it anyway

There are learning editions of Nuke if you want to do Compositing. Try and get a job as a Runner at a studio which requires no 3D experience but will get your foot in the door at a studio. Buy a monthly subscription to Digital Tutors and teach yourself the basics. There are colleges with degrees and such but it is very pricey so I really recommend Digital Tutors or some other online tutorial thing so you can make sure its what you want to do before spending a ton on a degree. One of the best digital media schools in NY is SVA (School of Visual Arts). Research the industry and realize what you are getting into. NYC has a bunch of commercial houses.

Certainly for skills, but you'll need to do the networking on your own.  I used to go to the NYC After effects (or motion graphics) users groups... it was a good place to start.

If you are really pressed for time get the camera low and point the fisheye straight up for an HDR dome for your CG scene.  With the 14mm you are going to need at least 6 shots for a full spherical pano.

You need to do them at an appropriate unit scale to their real world size.    The resolution of the mesh will also influence the apparent scale but this ends up feeling a lot like tabletop diorama size, largely because of that rock and water dynamic happening very close to camera that looks to represent an effect nearly as large as those buildings on the opposite side.

Foreground and midground elements will need to be separated to have at least three different levels of snow. (This depends on the shots you have to work on.)  You're going to have to figure out the budget (time/money/whatever) you have. Because there is only so much work you can do in the time you have.  People on /r/AfterEffects may have more suggestions for you (and it would certainly help if we could see some example shots), but I have some basic suggestions.   The Roto Brush tool might be very useful to you to get things done quickly. However, the effectiveness depends greatly on the shot you have. Info on how best to use it here. For shots when the Roto Brush just doesn't cut it, regular rotoscoping must step in!

vfx,2wbhke,mrbrick,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:26:45 2015 UTC,Track the shot and set up a bunch of nulls for your parallax and positioning.   For fog you can use some fractal noise tricks / displacement / and nice cloud or grey sky textures. You can get some ideas on how to make good looking atmospheres here: http://www.videocopilot.net/tutorials/animating_a_still/  Pre Comp your fog layers and experiment with the collapsed 3d transforms and you can work your way back & have control over your groups. Also work in 16 or 32 bit for those nice opacitiy
vfx,2wbhke,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"If you start making your own layers based on fractal noise, or turbulent noise, a great way to get better patterns and more natural, cloudy shapes with ragged edges, is the following:  1) work in 32bit, always, and if not linear space then at least 32bit with 1.0 blending  2) add a solid layer with a value of 50% gray, then duplicate this, temporarily turning off display of the top grey solid  3) add Fractal Noise to the lower of the two grey solids, tweaking the noise properties until you have a basic scale that you like  4) turn on the topmost grey solid and set its blending mode to Subtract.  This has the effect of centering the mid value of the fractal noise at '0' and now contains both positive and negative values  5) pre-compose the two solids  6) duplicate the pre-comp and set the topmost copy to have a blend mode of Add; scale this comp up and watch how you start to get some nice cloudy shapes  ...and then you can pre-compose these two layers into one clip that you can then duplicate, offset, scale, etc.  You'll most likely want to add  a Levels effect to the precomp and clamp off results below 0 and above 1.  But this is the method of mixing noise that keeps most sprite-based particle systems, like Particular, from looking better than bunches of cotton balls.  This is similar to the method of mixing noise that you see in Digital Domain's ""Storm"" software (aka Voxel Bitch).  EDIT: sorry, I left out some steps because AE only, by default, generates unsigned noise.  I've made appropriate changes."
vfx,2wbhke,fpskenny,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:12:50 2015 UTC,Could probably give it a shot with some fractal noise and some heavy blur. Set the layer to screen. Mask out the areas you want the fog to be in. Then give the fractal noise some very slight evolution over time. Make a couple duplicate layers and scale them up or position them in 3D space to give the fog some different layers of depth.

It's in the lawyer's interest to implicate as many people as possible, hence the inflammatory language, but the fact remains that R&H was no better or worse run than any other FX house, it folded due to the nature of the industry and having too much debt from PTO & benefits on account of not treating their workforce as disposable."
vfx,2w5jty,shidarin,-9,Tue Feb 17 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"No genius, I'm saying that the idea that John Hughes intentionally stole millions from R&H is about as likely as saying you were just mugged by a Golden Retriever.   You are clearly blind to the evidence presented, and if you consider John Hughes a ""Golden Retriever"" you have a very biased view of the topic. Fortunately the punishment of his wrongdoings is not in your hands.   The CCCD business (which ultimately only cost R&H about $2m, which is nothing compared to their total losses) was an attempt to branch out into medical imaging and expand their revenue stream, not a ""quick, let's prop up dad in laws biotech company"".   Citing the lawsuit:   despite conflicts of interest, Hughes funneled cash into CCCD without board approval, performance milestones or any adequate protections.   Clear as glass.   but allegations of malfeasance are laughable   You need more than that expression to discredit the evidence   John Hughes still drives an old piece of shit Honda Civic, if he managed to steal millions from the company, surely he could at least afford a new piece of shit Honda Civic?   Mark Zuckerberg drives a Volkswagen GTI, humble lifestyle doesn't relate to poverty.   R&H's primary costs were in not firing employees left, right and center as the revenue stream dried up, which is something that Hughes was desperate to avoid. Most of the corporate negligence laid out in the complaint stems from trying to not fuck over their artists.   Citing the lawsuit:   ""In fact, R&H had hundreds of idle staff members who continued to collect salaries and benefits during R&H’s financial crisis,"" says the complaint. ""In an interview regarding R&H, Hughes acknowledged that the D&Os were aware that they desperately needed to 'cut people’s salaries or to lay off a significant number of people or to work people overtime without paying them for overtime by restructuring their contracts' but explicitly chose not to make such changes in order to maintain the R&H 'culture.' ""   So, the criminal choose not to take any actions in order to maintain the ""culture"". But let me explain you what culture here means: the idle overpaid partners and friends that helped him with his Ponzi Scheme so that he could use the company funds for his own inversions while slaving the VFX artist that were doing the actual work, then declare bankruptcy, layoff everybody, collect the money in loans and take credit for the work done... and the Oscar of course; then shameless complaining about the industry.   but the fact remains that R&H was no better or worse run than any other FX house   Its not surprise to me the rampant corruption in the top VFX houses, what its most disgusting and sickening for me is people like you that cover up their missteps because they are ""good and humble people"", but when other ones come up with ideas to fix this industry like Daniel Lay and ADAPT, the top priority is to shame them without any constructive criticism. But there is nothing more rewarding for me as seeing how this Ponzi Scheme falls apart while the puppeters collect all the money and the credit for the work done.   I'm done with the VFX industry and its fellows (VFX artists included), its a clunky machine that will explode at any time, but far from me."
vfx,2w5jty,dagmx,8,Tue Feb 17 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"I was a member of ADAPT, save your condescension for the people who didn't donate money to it.  If the CCCD transfers were so clandestine & done without approval, why did John talk about it at company meetings? It wasn't this big fucking secret that's only now just coming to light.  The ""hundreds of idle staff members"" were the ARTISTS who had accrued a shit ton of PTO, they were idle because R&H was trying to get people to burn off their PTO as quickly as possible.   R&H's PTO policy was, admittedly, idiotically generous, but it wasn't done to make any one rich, so should R&H have laid them off and paid the PTO out (something they couldn't afford to do) or just fired them outright and let everyone sue to reclaim their PTO?  Which is it?  Do you agree with the complaint that R&H should have just fired all the artists with excessive PTO accruals? Because that's what it sounds like.  R&H's culture was to try to not fuck over it's artists, the problem was that this extended so far it stopped R&H being as competitive as it needed to be, R&H's major debts came from PTO accruals and the cost of their healthcare program which they didn't want to dial back.  If this was a Ponzi scheme, it was probably the least effective one in history unless you think that starting with a 64% share of a $100m company and selling that for about $750k is some kind of master stroke.  What do you think the bridge loans from the studios were spent on? They all went to paying artist salaries during the completion phase of Percy Jackson 2 & Seventh Son.  NOBODY (except the lawyers) got rich off the R&H bankruptcy, we're not talking shady deals like John Textor & the DDMG guys who cashed in after the IPO and then left the company to burn.  This whole thing just looks like an excuse for the bankruptcy lawyers to rack up the billable hours."

Ironically, while proselytizing about R&H’s special corporate culture and their concern for its labor force, Hughes, Ts’o and Goldfarb pillaged R&H with little concern about the consequences.

Consider this, it takes years to learn, and loads of smart people get paid lots of money to do it full time. Gollum was rigged. Benjamin Button was rigged. Davy Jones' face was rigged. The bar is unflinching, full screen, ball-smashing realism.   It's good that you're learning 3D. Every professional was, at some point, where you are right now.

Spend more time studying what makes an image cinematic and look at emulating that in your comps.   Compositing vfx for films has a lot to do with making things look like they were captured in camera, not with 'making it look real'. Spend a little time studying how real lenses aberrate, what artefacts they produce (glows/ blooms/ glints / halation/ DOF) and how colour, contrast and saturation levels change when filmed.   the reasons the big films look good is they spend the time making these look right."

Because if I'm being honest, to me it looks like an untextured armoured personel carrier driving through an untextured wall where the objects fall through the floor and the whole thing is lit using a daylight system. Not only that, but it's basically what you'd expect someone to be capable of after about 30 minutes of messing about with Rayfire. To add insult to injury, the opening title and trail were about the same length as the actual animation.   You're presenting your work as a studio, yet this work couldn't scream any louder that you're a hobbyist doing a few basic tutorials and rendering the results.   HOWEVER (and here's the nice part), there's nothing wrong with being a hobbyist who does tutorials. I imagine that's how about 99.9% of the professionals in the industry started - it's not like Law or Accounting where you look at career paths and educational requirements and make a call. I imagine most here, even those that went to university or college to study it, probably started dicking about long before their first job. It's good!  But push it. No one cares that you can follow a tutorial and render some boxes. For you, it can be a useful step in a much longer process (that is, making sure everything you have done so far is working - which it isn't, since there's debris falling through the floor.) That doesn't look like a armoured personnel carrier driving through a wall because APC's don't look like that, walls don't look like that, debris doesn't look like that and the floor/environments don't look like that.   Try and make every single one of those things I mentioned above better. Texture and shade the APC, texture up the wall, add some detail to the environment - it doesn't have to be a full environment at all but it should be evocotive at the very least. And add far, far more detail to the wall destruction. Look at reference and you'll see that there should be far more small particles all blistering off with the larger ones, with all sizes in between. There should be dust clouds that interact with the moving objects (the tank and the falling debris), and the APC should react to driving over larger bits of debris, etc.   It's hard to give any feedback here, not because what you've done is bad per se, but because it's obviously not finished. It's one thing to post up work - even if it's awful - and say ""I've reached the end of my abilities - what do you guys think?"" But I doubt very much that there's a single part of this that even you think is remotely finished - so what are we meant to say? Well done for following a few tutorials?  Please don't take this the wrong way, it's meant to be encouraging - but if you want to garner respect and kudos (and I assume you do, thus presenting yourself as a studio) then you need to give quite a bit more."

So if I need to remove something with a lot of colour changes, you add a Laplacian, minus it from the original image, do your cloning, and then plus it back on. All the colour and in your case, shadow is untouched. It's only useful for removing fine things. Too big and you start to blur your colours in directions you didn't want.

vfx,2vm2nl,NotTheSheikOfAraby,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:27:26 2015 UTC,It is very interesting to see that they added so much film grain in post... I'm still relatively new to VFX/compositing. Is it a common practice to degrain the plates and then regrain the final composition?
vfx,2vm2nl,tipsystatistic,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:31:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, fairly common when compositing. If there is a noticeable difference in grain then you do it.  When you're mixing footage, the grain may not match, and CG and still elements won't have any grain.  If you only add grain, the different elements won't have the same amount of grain.  The CG will have some, but the original footage will have double. So degraining brings everything to zero first."

vfx,2vnoec,phunkaeg,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, Particular. Have a look at this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1q0wtdPwMw This is a way of creating a pretty nice water like effect lit with studio lighting. However, in your case, you would have to match the lighting in your room.  If you wanted your water to do anything more than hover, then you may be out of luck. Or you'll have to switch to a proper 3d application. Blender has a decent fluid simulation built in considering it's free. http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Manual/Physics/Fluid"
vfx,2vnoec,tipsystatistic,1 point,Sat Feb 14 10:01:47 2015 UTC,"^ this was my exact problem lol, I would of matched the lighting better like you suggested for sure, i actually completely forgot to add one of the lights on the top right which is why it looks so weird.  I tried so hard to make it move but like you said it seems i'm out of luck using 2d for that.  I'll have to try that fluid simulator, I've never heard of it, thank you for the response!"

This is what I do with my business; http://youtu.be/TEjscbA4keM - A combination of Motion graphics, full 3d animation, and 3D renders tracked into footage captured with drones.  Skip to 1:30,  2:00 and 3:00 to see the Live action footage compositing.  Other note, when commencing this project, all shots were supposed to be tracked into drone footage, however, on the day of filming, we were approached by CASA (Civil Aviation Safety Authority) and told we couldn't fly.    So with the same deadline, we had to create the rest of the animations in full 3d, or cheat it with 2d satellite photography."

vfx,2vl81r,quitefunny,3,Thu Feb 12 06:51:51 2015 UTC,"If you are new, try it with a few static shots first. You need to shoot matching plates, so shoot hall a, then bring those shots to hallway b and match the angles in camera. Then you only need to cut out the doorway to expose hall b. You will have a difficult time if you attempt this as a moving shot, even with the right software and knowledge. Getting good source is key to pulling this kind of thing off."
vfx,2vl81r,quitefunny,2,Thu Feb 12 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"It's going to be hard to get those shots to match up, if the camera is moving. The cameras in both takes would have to be stable and moving at a constant velocity.   In many cases, you might be better off making the second hallway CG and doing lots of roto for things that are in front of it."
vfx,2vl81r,Thefunkyfunker,1 point,Thu Feb 12 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"What if i use a track/dolly to guide the camera down the hall, as the door opens at the end, i want to see the next hallway through it, I could have a screen behind the door at the end of the hallway, just to remove what ever is there.   I see what your saying with CG but i'm quite low-tech. How long would it take to learn to CG roto up a hallway for a newbie?"
vfx,2vl81r,2012EOTW,2,Thu Feb 12 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"Making a 3d hallway is definitely one of the ""easier"" effects, but still requires knowledge in camera tracking software and 3d software, for modeling,texturing and lightning. Not something that can be learned in a day. Maybe a week if you don't have a day-job.  But if you don't do CG, a dolly would help. From my experience, many dollys still produce some slight camera shake, so you'd probably need some form of post-stabilization, such as After Effects' Warp Stabilizer. And you still definitely would need the camera to move at a constant speed. If it does not move at a constant speed, one hallway could appear to be coming in faster than another (or slower). You may be able to use time remapping to compensate for different speeds, but it's a huge pain in the butt and something you'll only want to do when you have no other options.  A green screen is a great idea if you have one! It should eliminate your need for roto, so long as it covers all the things that will eventually become Hallway B. Also it has to be lit well enough to key, or you'll be back to roto-ing again.  Edit: And make sure the camera in both takes are at the same height, angle and same focal length."

vfx,2vfz9u,ilikefarting,4,Tue Feb 10 18:40:52 2015 UTC,"My biggest personal downfall when doing this is being decisive.  There are usually a few to several different ways to pull off an effect, and deciding which way to do it can sometimes be a challenge.  Several shots you'll have figured out before hand but sometimes making on the spot decisions can be scary.  Though I've never not been able to make a shot work.  Another thing is don't be shy about telling the director that something isn't right and needs to be fixed.  Whether the lighting needs to change for something to work, or that you think a shot needs to be redone because that take was untrackable.  I work on commercials mostly and I've always worked with good directors that check with me after most takes to make sure we are good.  I usually go in and put a good amount of markers on the greenscreen while the crew is setting up, then add and remove them in between the first couple takes depending on the shot, since the first takes are rarely ever used."
vfx,2vfz9u,Wtkeith,2,Tue Feb 10 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"Another thing is don't be shy about telling the director that something isn't right and needs to be fixed.    Don't really be shy with the directors about anything! I dont have a huge amount of set expierence, but I have some. I've learned its always good to keep your concerns vocalized when it comes to shot set up & performances and so on.  Always try and get a good clear sense of what is involved in the shots well before hand. Also its good to see set photos ahead of time.  I use an app that measures distances and angles and things (android: http://android.appstorm.net/reviews/utilities/smart-tools-your-portable-toolbox/) that has come in very useful.   Also it can be good to have a laptop on set in case you want to to quickly test a key or test a 3d track or something quickly- though if you have a client around you might want to be careful of showing off rough work."

Like /u/Wtkeith says, be ready to make snap decisions.  Prep is everything.  Go through the boards and your plan until you see it in your sleep.  The director probably doesn't want to hear anything technical.  Always approach a discussion with creatives from a creative point of view.

I was at a presentation on the making of the hobbit 3, which had a lot of stunt doubles. Most of it was low detailed scans and then they were fixed by the modelers. A decent scan combined with motion blur is usually good enough to sell the effect. I doubt many people would fully model a person, scanning is just easier and more accurate that using reference and its a good base."
vfx,2v8gar,Cant-Find-Username,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"It seems like scanning is really efficient, especially now that it can include texture data. But how about the stunts themselves? Are the doubles hand animated, or are ragdoll type rigs created to drive the animation? I suppose it would depend."
vfx,2v8gar,rworsl,2,Mon Feb 9 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"I've done bodytracking at several major vfx studios, and quite a few have been for digi doubles. The tracking department is usually the ones that are required to either track or roto-anim to the backplate, and if it's something that can't be done o set, it'll usually start and end with roto-anim, then animation will take over in the middle and they will blend between the live action footage and the tracked footage."

vfx,2v0gx1,Helicobster,2,Fri Feb 6 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"3ds Max doesn't work with WINE. It depends too heavily on Windows-specific stuff for licensing & display, and either won't install, or won't start. It doesn't even work for network rendering, sadly. We'd save a lot of money if it did.  A number of other Windows-only apps are expected to work under WINE, but few work reliably enough to use all day.  Dual-booting Windows & Linux is pretty much guaranteed to work, though, so you could just install Linux alongside your existing Windows 7.  You also have the option of installing Windows on a virtual machine under Linux, or installing Linux on a VM under your existing Windows install. Then you wouldn't even have to reboot to go from one to the other. It's another layer of complexity, sure, but VMs can be very useful in VFX and that knowledge could prove very handy at work.  As for Linux-native games, try browsing Steam's Linux selection. You won't necessarily find everything you want, but you'll find enough to keep you entertained."
vfx,2v0gx1,singapeng,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"You might want to have a look at what are the requirements for the software you intend to run. For example, Autodesk officially supports RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS (a fork of Ubuntu) for Maya.  Most modern Linux distributions are fairly easy to install, provided your hardware isn't too exotic. Some distros do not require an install so you could test without committing (for example: Linux Mint, a popular Ubuntu-based distro that seems to have no problem running Maya, although not officially supported), although you will want to install to do any sort of serious usage.  I would definitely say using Linux as your daily system will help adapting to a VFX studio environment, at least if you're aiming for the major studios. Daily familiarity with the shell, code editors, etc, will be useful, more so if you're aiming for the more technical jobs.  About gaming, well... If you're serious about it, you'll probably want to keep a bootable Windows around (shouldn't be a problem as long as you dont' try to install Windows after Linux). While many games will run on Wine, you'll feel the difference in performance terms, and you may not want to deal with the setup headaches."
vfx,2v0gx1,horseflavour,7,Fri Feb 6 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"Minor correction, centos is not a fork of Ubuntu. Both fedora and centos are rhel based. Ubuntu is debian based.  @op: You're gonna have a harder time with Ubuntu than you will with any redhat based distro (especially for maya). With that said, even installing some dcc applications on red hat distros is still a much bigger task than it is on Windows.   I personally prefer fedora, but centos is also a good choice. For working with 3d apps, make sure you install the proprietary graphics drivers and don't use the open source one bundled with the os."

Getting software (and drivers) installed & set up on a Linux box is a bit of a faff and invariably involves dealing with lower level bullshit than you'd ever have to deal with at a studio - oh, how I love having to recompile the fucking video drivers every time there's a kernel update, woo.  For Nuke, there really isn't much of a need to install Linux since as petersid7 points out, it's pretty much the same across platform, but Houdini & Maya are generally better off run from a linux command prompt (I despise using Houdini on Windows) and Katana is Linux Only afaik.  If you're determined to do it, CentOS 6 or Ubuntu would likely work fine, just make sure you install the KDE desktop manager  rather than gnome or lightdm, since that's what most places use in my experience.  You'll want to use bash or tcsh as your primary shell (my experience is that tcsh is more popular than bash).

vfx,2uuirm,jbaron23,7,Thu Feb 5 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"I have only used deep a few times in my projects, however in my opinion the true benefits of deep are as follows:   You can re-render any scene object and it can be seamlessly dropped into the comp. Removes the massive pain in the ass that is comping fluid sims, ie. smoke, fire, clouds, atmosphere, water, foam, mist, etc. You can reconstruct your 3d scene in Nuke from the Deep, and easily add 2d element with correct PSR, and perform object specific  corrections without having to render millions of object buffers.   I mostly have used it for comping in Naiad fluid sims that I rendered in Houdini when the rest of my scene was rendered with Vray/Indigo/Maxwell in Cinema 4D or Arnold in Maya.  That is just my limited use case, I hope it helps."
vfx,2uuirm,Belly3D,3,Thu Feb 5 07:02:35 2015 UTC,"Well put.  So far for us it has been exclusively used it to integrate houdini fx elements into CG from Maya. It has saved us tons of time dealing with painful matte lines, and we just never have to really worry about things like displacement on objects being held out in the fx renders. We have also used it to combine multiple fx passes together (just today did sand blowing through smoke, worked like a charm)  It is a bit slow, hoping exr 2.0 will help speed it up. We usually have a separate precomp where an alpha is generated using deepCombine and deepHoldout nodes, and these can run 10+ min per frame on passes with lots of transparency, like motion blurred smoke. Would be interested to hear if others have similar issues."

vfx,2uuirm,OliveOil2013,3,Thu Feb 5 10:02:20 2015 UTC,"The depth pass has been with us for decades. The difference with deep image data is that instead of just one RGBA value and one Z value per pixel, we have RGBA and Z and any other values you like, for every layer of stuff, per pixel.  The main benefit is that it allows you to adjust or insert layers that are partially obscured by smoke, hair, trees, motion-blurred objects and other soft or nebulous stuff. A depth pass by itself would only let you adjust or insert layers that were either in full view or completely obscured, without partially obscured being much of an option at all.  The main drawback of deep data (for now and the immediately foreseeable future) is that the files are large, slow to manipulate and only supported by a handful of tools."

vfx,2uuirm,wrosecrans,1 point,Thu Feb 5 10:32:49 2015 UTC,Someday cameras will also capture depth and that extra data will be used for compositing out unwanted elements and controlling things like depth of field in post.  The benefits of deep are infinite in the future but perhaps only minor at the moment.   There are so many reasons why deep is going to help us in the post world that I'm glad we're ahead of the innovation on the capture end.  Imagine that if we had deep capture on cameras (along with good bokeh approximations in post) we might see a reverse in the trend of camera sensors getting bigger and bigger.    Deep data also allows you to perhaps in the future remove lens distortions in an accurate and much more intuitive way.  So much more that we haven't even thought of with depth.
vfx,2uuirm,demesisx,0,Thu Feb 5 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"FYI, the question isn't about that.  Deep data in CG is about having multiple samples for a given pixel at varying depths, so you can have data for what's behind what you can see.  What you are describing for physical cameras would be equivalent to a simple Z-pass which has been common in CG for many years.  While that would be insanely cool to have from a shoot, a depth buffer != deep data."
vfx,2uuirm,future_lard,0,Thu Feb 5 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"They will indeed be one and the same someday.  They will be intertwined.  Camera metadata will include Deep data and will be available in post-transcoded EXR's.   Also, who's to say that the Z sensor will be at the camera won't have multiple values which include what's around you?  All you need is a lidar of the set (or a live LiDAR) and a transcoding algorithm that aligns those values with what the camera captured then joins them into metadata.  You'd have a camera depth pass, a set depth pass, and every other element, and all other channels in one EXR file.      I think you probably shouldn't try and censor me from giving such an interesting answer.  Do you need to censor me?  I added a different perspective (that is related to my discipline) to the conversation and it's people like you who water things down significantly."

Its neat to me that SynthEyes is being recommended so much considering its competitive price. Does it do object tracking like PFTrack? Can you undistorted/redistort footage within the program or do you have to do it in AE?   The lighter version seems to be adequate for my need except that the frame size is limited to HD. We are shooting 4k a lot more. Do you think this frame size limitation would affect the scaling of undistorted footage? Doesn't removing distortion losslessly require you to increase frame size? I may be wrong here, like I said its been a couple years."
vfx,2urpzz,PhotoshopKid,2,Wed Feb 4 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"Shoot your own lens distortion plates because all Lenes are different. Yes, it does have Undistort/Redistort options. It does not do object tracking like PFTrack. I use a mix of Syntheyes for Camera Tracking and PFTrack for object tracking and just parent the PFTrack scene to the Syntheyes camera track. It will only work if you have the same lens info typed into both programs. Works great with 4K footage. If you can afford it, 3D Equalizer is the best Camera Tracking software, but everyone uses Syntheyes because it is cheaper, and it works just as well. If you are doing object tracking, use PFTrack and mix the 2 together."
vfx,2urpzz,RIP_Intel,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yes Syntheyes has popular distortion models and integrates nicely with Nuke / Fusion / AE etc.  Yes you can undistort plates / redistort plates / elements within syntheyes. Normally I just undistort plates and leave it at that, occasionally we do have to go through the workflow to distort our elements to match the plate. In a perfect world, you'll get distortion plates with a grid. I can count about 3 times this has actually happened in production and we actually received them. Production crews now don't even bother and we just have to deal with it.  Syntheyes absolutely does do object tracking along with manual mocap. (multiple camera angles synced up and then you track relative trackers)  If it's a lockoff, you can just do an object track, if it's a moving scene & you want an object track, just 3d track the scene first, then use that information and object track within that. What you get in your 3d package is a nice scene with nulls for your environment and then nulls for your object track that are parented to a master null.  I'd say if it's possible, try a couple different packages out. You may find you like the hardcore options of 3dequilizer, or maybe pftrack is more your style. Either way, whatever package you end up with, there's usually a way to wrangle them to do what you want.  Happy tracking! :D"

vfx,2uvndd,Ok_Lumberjack,9,Thu Feb 5 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"I share many of your frustrations using AE, but I feel it's important to address a couple of your assumptions:   I know guys like Andrew Kramer who make great VFX work with AE, but he himself admits that AE is insufficient. Insomuch as they've made Element 3D to add the ability of importing 3D mesh. And I'm sure he uses Nuke for his serious work.   The guys at Video Copilot created a Nuke version of their plugin Optical Flares and Andrew made a tutorial about how to use it.  In that tutorial he says he never uses Nuke and he obviously struggles a bit in navigating the interface in order to show off the plugin.   Adobe pulls promotion stunts for AE because it sucks.   I don't see why Adobe's marketing should get flak while the Foundry's marketing gets a pass.  I can barely stand to watch Nuke demonstration videos because it's so freaking slow.  Yeah, it's awesome to watch them pull deep-image data out of shots from Planet of the Apes and composite them onto the Golden Gate bridge.  But my god it takes like 3 minutes to render the frame just to see what you're working with!    After Effects isn't as capable sure, but really it's both marketed and used as a 2.5D compositor.  That's enough for 80% of the films that get made.  I would never use Nuke for green screen compositing and the like unless I absolutely had to.  Same goes for anything motion-graphics related, which is a key market for After Effects.  So tl;dr, AE definitely has areas that are in desperate need of improvement.  And AE and Nuke overlap but they are not trying to be the same product.  Use what works for you."
vfx,2uvndd,i_start_fires,2,Thu Feb 5 17:23:37 2015 UTC,"I would never use Nuke for green screen compositing and the like unless I absolutely had to   Just out of curiosity, why not?   It's been my experience that Nuke absolutely blows AE out of the water for anything comp related and keying is no exception."
vfx,2uvndd,nathan_white,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"Mostly because of Nuke's node-based system.  It's great for really complex comps, but something as simple as green screen takes too many steps for my taste.  And since the plugins for the actual chroma keying are identical between the two programs, I find that I can key footage much faster using AE."
vfx,2uvndd,i_start_fires,-2,Thu Feb 5 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"There's a plug-in for AE called Key Correct, that automatically creates several much-needed mattes for edges, highlights, etc. Doing so with Nuke takes hours, because you have to create the mattes manually and I don't even know how. So yeah AE sucks but to be fair, it has its strengths."
vfx,2uvndd,f_regrain,3,Thu Feb 5 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"I work as a comper at a major VFX house and in my opinion nuke is definitely much better for green screens simply because you have so much more control. On something high budget you're going to be using multiple keys and despills. It's not a terribly complicated process and once you've got it figured out you get a really beautiful soft key that preserves things like motion blur and defocused edges. Despill also does a nifty job of cleaning the ""green screen green"" out of  things. Star gate studios is one of the only respectable studios I know of that actively uses AE and they are mainly a TV studio so it's more understandable."
vfx,2uvndd,instantpancake,-3,Thu Feb 5 21:11:28 2015 UTC,I use AE for keying too. And alongside C4D it's probably the best solution for motion graphics.

Is it too much to ask for multipass and multilayer instead of just stacking up layers above each other?

vfx,2ukio4,poop_butler,10,Mon Feb 2 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"I've been in this industry for a long time now, and I've seen it change. When I started, my colleagues would openly joke about my nipples in front of me and slap my ass when I was walking up the stairs in front of them. There were mailing aliases where the guys would rate their female colleagues.   At the time, there were about twenty of us women in a company of several hundred. Our male colleagues were in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties, mostly unmarried. It was basically a frat house with really really well paid fraternity members.   Back then, I also had to prove myself. All. The. Freaking. Time. Whenever I started at a new company, I would spend the first three months proving to my colleagues that my poor little lady brain could understand VFX. That got old, really fast. Especially when the people challenging me were much less experienced than I was.   Those days are gone now. As an industry, we've gotten older, greyer, and a bit more mature. If anyone jokes about my nipples now, they at least have the courtesy to do it after I've left the room.   None of these changes have come about from company policy, or from assertive hiring practices. They've come about from the people in the industry growing up and getting more serious about the work they do.   Of course, it's not all there yet. I still have to sit in dailies and listen to my supervisor and colleagues rating the female star's body. I still have to put up with guys making stupid misogynistic jokes around me. And I still go to work some days to see the guy opposite me wearing a t-shirt that has a naked bound and gagged woman on the front. And those sorts of things can create a feeling of alienation, particularly for women just starting out.   TL; DR: You want more woman in the office with you? Create an environment where women want to be there."
vfx,2ukio4,startled_goat,6,Tue Feb 3 06:49:21 2015 UTC,Jesus that environment sounds horrible.  It's hard enough getting work done without people assaulting you. At the very least the environment seems less outright hostile to women now
vfx,2ukio4,OverTheHorizonRadar,-8,Tue Feb 3 07:04:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really sound like your experiences as a woman in the VFX industry are significantly different to the average guy's experiences.  I've been in this industry for a long time, too, and I doubt there's anyone who's been around for more than a few years without hearing jokes made about their bodies, and about everyone else's respective fancy bits.  It's not sexist or hostile to joke about butts & nipples when we all have those.  I don't think there's any combination of men, women and their respective body parts that I haven't heard from both men and women. Also some occasional ironic butt-slaps, because it's funny to cross those social boundaries when (as far as you know) nobody on your team is keeping pencils up there.  I'm not saying these are grade-A jokes, but this kind of low-intensity humour is the social lubricant that keeps teams running smoothly. So in this crowd, no opportunity to make a colleague laugh goes wasted, and no taboo is taken seriously, because these jokes are very easy to make and (as far as we know) we're all too clever & progressive to take any taboos or Victorian etiquettes seriously.  Is it not gentlemanly? It's not ladylike? That's the whole idea! We're either past notions of ladies do this and gentlemen do that, or we're not. You can't have it both ways.  And we all feel singled out sometimes, because at some point, everyone is the youngest, oldest, malest, femalest, blackest, whitest or otherwise most minority-ish person in the room. And we all have to prove ourselves, and we all feel that it's unfair at the time.  So I think it's a pre-requisite for success & happiness in this industry to leave your prejudices & taboos at home, and be prepared to immerse yourself in a culture of cheap laughs, disposable visuals, and actually having to work a bit harder than you thought you would.  And finally, for whatever it's worth, it's been my experience that the men and women alike who find the most success & happiness in VFX are the ones who are most willing to laugh, joke, drink, work late, ask for help, offer help, and go to lunch with the rest of the crew. The ones who sit there fuming about getting too much special treatment, too little special treatment, or the wrong kind of special treatment don't seem to be enjoying themselves at all."
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,5,Thu Feb 5 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"So, if a woman wants to work in vfx she should just shut up and put up with sexual harassment because you find it funny? It's a pre-requisite for success, in your opinion, that they should keep their mouth shut if they are uncomfortable when you slap their ass on the stairs?   Your comment really bothers me dude. If you were married, and heard some guy was slapping your wifes ass at work, would you feel that was 'all in good fun?'"
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,-4,Thu Feb 5 04:46:53 2015 UTC,"This all hinges on how you define ""sexual harassment"", or indeed what you consider to be unequal treatment.  I'm a dude. If another dude (especially a co-worker) slaps my ass, I'm going to assume it's done as a one-off joke. It's kind of funny because it's kind of inappropriate.  Similarly, if a woman (especially a co-worker) slaps my ass, I'm going to assume it's done as a one-off joke. It's kind of funny because it's kind of inappropriate.  If I see a woman slap another woman's ass... you get the idea. It's presumably intended as a joke, and until we decide otherwise for this hypothetical scenario, we shouldn't just assume it's systemic or a regular occurrence. So then it shouldn't matter who has which arrangement of X & Y chromosomes at the time, because we're past all that, right? All asses are equal, right?  So if my wife came home and said ""Robert slapped my ass today"", I might ask ""doesn't Heather slap your ass most days?"" and she'd say ""yup, unless it's Suzy"", and we'd get on with dinner, because I haven't married someone who judges people's behaviours based on their gender.  So yeah - personally, I prefer not to give a shit about trivial jokes, or being treated like a friend in the workplace. Sure, though - everyone has their own boundaries, and that's something to consider and respect. But if we're constantly shifting the officially allowable boundaries towards no jokes, no touching, no HR-unapproved T-shirts etc. then we're taking a pretty functional & friendly working environment - albeit an unusually informal one, by global standards - and making it artificially hostile.  If it were only women's asses being slapped, or if there were mandatory miniskirt mondays, or if there were demands of sexual favours, then we'd be talking about sexual harassment - but so far we're just talking about women already getting the same treatment in the workplace that men get. So far we don't even have a case for saying ""that's kinda sexist"", when all indications are that this is the equal treatment we all agreed would be a good idea.  All we can reliably say so far about gender politics in VFX is that there are more men in the industry than women. Without stats from both sexes (with regards to offensive jokes, being passed over for promotion, unauthorised eye-contact etc.) there's no way to make a compelling case that the VFX industry is affected by sexism or gender politics at all. By all appearances, the disparity in male & female employment numbers seems simply attributable to the fact that there are more geeky dudes who enjoy this kind of work than there are geeky gals who enjoy this kind of work. That doesn't mean it's a broken industry. It just means yet another area where men's & women's preferences seem to differ naturally."
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,5,Thu Feb 5 05:56:03 2015 UTC,"You don't know what will offend someone else though. If you make a sexist joke to someone, 99 times out of 100 they will force a laugh and pretend its fine because they don't want to rock the boat. If they turned you in to HR then everyone would treat them like a tattle tale. So they keep their mouth shut. But I assure it bothers some of them. Probably most of them. And it's not fair to make a few people uncomfortable just so the group can let off some steam.   How would you feel if a gay coworker kept telling you how much he liked your ass? It would make you uncomfortable. Gay guys I've been friends with for years don't even do that. Just like I've never made a comment like that to my female friends.  Equal rights don't mean that you treat everyone the same, it means you treat everyone with the same level of respect.  The other thing is not everyone making the jokes is kidding on the same level. For every person that really is just kidding around, someone else is only sort of kidding. You may be innocently playing around slapping a female coworkers ass, but I promise that someone else around you does it with a little malice. It's just like with racist jokes. Some people are kidding, others are using a 'joke' to be cruel and say what they really mean.   You don't sound like you mean to offend anyone with it, but you may be doing so without knowing it. Just because something doesn't offend you doesn't mean its not offensive.  Anyway, just my two cents."
vfx,2ukio4,kayleesstrawberry,-5,Thu Feb 5 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"You're half right.  Some people do get offended, yes. I've seen both men and women crash & burn in this industry specifically because they can't make jokes, won't take jokes, can't take constructive criticism, can't get the hang of socialising with their team-mates, or won't take their share of the workload. That's not a gender thing - some people are just too sensitive, too paranoid or too egotistical to fit in with a team of Average Joes (and/or Janes), and they tend not to last long, whether they make a fuss about being offended or not. I've seen more men crash & burn this way than women, though, simply because men outnumber women in this business.  I know plenty of women who've succeeded in VFX and had fun doing it, and without exception, they're the friendly & funny kind, and not the easily-offended kind.  So no, I don't see the need to accommodate men or women who are easily offended, because there are plenty of more easy-going candidates available to take their place.  By the way, I don't know why you think I'd be uncomfortable if a gay co-worker complimented my ass. I'm trying to explain that I'm not the easily-offended type, but you're saying ""oh, but you're still a homophobe, right?""  I'm not offended, of course - I just think that's kind of a weird thing to project on a stranger, given the topic at hand.  And, for the record, I've encountered some genuine sleazebags in this business - both male sleazebags and female sleazebags - but again, they're such a tiny minority that it's really not worth overhauling the industry to weed them out."
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,4,Thu Feb 5 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to realize that you're describing sexual harassment and justifying it because you think it's funny. What kind of messed up workplace environment do you work at where it's acceptable to go around slapping people's asses? At any studio I've worked at people doing this would be sitting through sexual harassment seminars for the rest of the week or most likely get fired. You're not planning Johnny's next kegger at the Frat house. This is a work environment where professionals are making a living. Just because this is a fun industry where you can go to work in flip flops and a Star Wars t-shirt doesn't allow people to be offensive. Just because I play Cards Against Humanity with my friends doesn't mean I should joke about bears butt fucking the elderly with any random coworker in the hall. Sure, some people are too sensitive but you just don't have the right to offend them just because you and your buddies think it's funny, sorry if you think it sucks, that's just how it is."
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,-4,Thu Feb 5 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"sorry if you think it sucks, that's just how it is   Ha! And they say women aren't funny.  Since we're making each other laugh, here is a nice little clip on your right to not be offended."
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,-4,Fri Feb 6 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"Victims of what, exactly? Victims of a handful of jokes, over how many years? Does a bruised ego or grabbed ass ever heal? Is there a joke-victims' ward somewhere I could call for more information?  I don't know how you've made the mental leap from the topics & anecdotes discussed here to ""blatant sexual harassment"", when no pattern of sexual harassment has actually been indicated. Men and women alike are the butts of the same jokes, and it's pretty rare (and not indicated here) that there's any malice, sexual intent or attempted manipulation behind it. Hell, even the article only mentions (and kinda belabours the point) that there are more men in VFX than women... but it only offers speculation as to why. If ""blatant sexual harassment"" was rife in VFX, why wasn't that the topic of the article?  It seems to me like you've chosen this topic to be your daily outrage, but now you're having to exaggerate the whole story to get your fix. It doesn't seem like you need VFX industry culture to offend you at all, if you're perfectly capable of manufacturing your own outrage."
vfx,2ukio4,startled_goat,-5,Thu Feb 5 07:46:47 2015 UTC,"If you're not on a personal quest to be outraged, why bring sexual harassment into the discussion at all?  You're right in that I don't care about the feelings of the especially sensitive - but pragmatically, I don't think it's a good idea at all to reinforce the idea that women are too sensitive for this industry, too delicate, or too quick to anger, and so the industry must change to accommodate them. That would be a backwards step. Most women in this business are just getting on with it as contentedly as the rest of us; I don't think we need to break out the Wet Blanket Brigade on their behalf.  We already make no special effort to accommodate the small subset of men who are unduly sensitive or bad-tempered, so I see no reason to make a special effort to accommodate the small subset of women who are unduly sensitive or bad-tempered."
vfx,2ukio4,Helicobster,2,Thu Feb 5 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"The comment was ""I bet your nipples taste great"", which I'm pretty sure most guys don't hear in the office."
vfx,2ukio4,kayleesstrawberry,-1,Thu Feb 5 15:49:02 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I thought you were probably talking about a persistent running gag that got out of hand, and not just a one-off comment.  I'm kinda glad it was a one-off, if that was indeed the case. But without knowing the actual context, I'd have to say that's about the same level of offensiveness that men and women at most of the places I've worked use, sparingly & knowingly, to make each other laugh. Not all the men, sure, and not all the women - just the ones who can turn crass humour on & off like a tap.  Maybe whoever said it was a genuine misogynist, or maybe it's just unfortunate that a joke was only meant to embarrass you caused you deeper offense instead. In any case, I think it's interesting that on the topic of sexism in VFX, these are the worst horror stories that spring to the mind of an industry veteran. Compared to all the other shit we go through in this business, and compared to the kind of sexism & cruelty people in other fields are subjected to, that seems pretty PG."
vfx,2ukio4,TurtleOnCinderblock,5,Thu Feb 5 23:40:33 2015 UTC,"If you want more women in tech positions, you need to look into ways of getting female students interested in more technical fields, as early as possible (the same argument goes for male students and fields with a majority of women). Look at the male/female ratio in CS and engineering courses, it's ridiculous.  I've talked with recruiters that have been actively trying to find more women to fill tech jobs but they just can't find the candidates. You always want to make sure talent and experience is the main deciding factor so you can't just hire female candidates for the hell of it. I'm not sure what studios can do about it besides showing up in schools and promoting all those sexy tech jobs :)"
vfx,2ukio4,devoidz,5,Thu Feb 5 08:40:34 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting discussion. In my experience there is an opposite bias production side, with higher proportion of women in all positions from entry level coordinators to production managers/ producers ( or even higher up with the possibly rare case of Victoria). Work hours are very tough in production and there are a lot of responsibilities, so I'd agree that the maternal effect is irrelevant: some women may be driven out by the work load, production proves that many are not. I've been lucky to work in teams with more women than average, and find the experience similar in most aspects (exception being I generally find less whisky amateurs in a more feminine team... So again, irrelevant to the job) I suspect metrics if collected would be more interesting if we compared them to the gender ratio of vfx schools... And Arts schools in the ratio of  people orienting themselves toward vfx. That would inform us on the actual proportion in which our industry drives women out of the artist side along the way. My own unsubstantiated feeling is that there is a level of immaturity that comes with our job (low skill entry jobs occupied by starry eyed early 20s people) that slowly plagues our ability to produce high responsibility leaders that would nurture an healthier work environment. (Artists become leaders become we need to fill the position, yet many people cannot, and should not lead). What we get instead is rampant teenage-level misogyny on the higher positions (famous executive in mind here) that feeds a women depreciating system."
vfx,2ukio4,Sloore,2,Thu Feb 5 11:42:26 2015 UTC,"When I went to school for vfx,  there was one girl in a class of 20. That would probably be the reason the ratio is more skewed towards men.  There are women doing vfx, just not as many as men.  If a place had 50 spots open,  200 people apply and 10 are female,  at best you can have 4:1. I am all for being fair,  but not all of those 10 would be good enough to be hired,  so it would only be maybe 5 of them.  It's not so much a gender issue from a hiring point,  but from an availability point.  There just aren't enough of them."
vfx,2ukio4,devoidz,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:12:43 2015 UTC,"So, because out of a single college class of 20, only one was female, then that clearly means that the entire industry has the same demographic breakdown?  This is your logic?  Really?"
vfx,2ukio4,89bottles,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"It isn't just one class. Where I went the same class goes through different blocks. So the class is like the year class. There is always a shortage of females in the class. They are always under 25% of the total class, most of the time under that. A lot of studios work the same way. They don't try to run off women, there just aren't as many trying to get in as guys."
vfx,2ukio4,MrSkruff,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:30:57 2015 UTC,totally agree.
vfx,2ukio4,89bottles,5,Wed Feb 4 06:30:04 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what to make of this article.   Companies must consider not only hiring practices, but also distribution of responsibilities, performance evaluation, and how the current dysfunction of these processes breeds an overall bias that colors the view of female competence. Recognizing biases and interrupting them when possible is critical.   What does this mean?   While it would be convenient to attribute the cause of VFX‘s woman problem to the same broken business model, the fact remains that this is an industry in which an artist can work for 10 years, hopping from one studio to another, and never once encounter a woman in a top level technical position.   I've encountered several women in top technical positions in VFX. Some disciplines seem to be more balanced than others (eg. comp vs fx). Production is dominated by women. I know for a fact that a mixed workplace is a goal for most vfx companies.  How can we prove the existence of a gender bias anyway? Surely not just based on a headcount, that seems very simplistic."
vfx,2ukio4,MrSkruff,2,Wed Feb 4 12:39:51 2015 UTC,Have you had a proper conversation with any of your female colleagues who work in comp of fx about gender bias in the vfx workplace? I'm genuinely interested to hear how that conversation went and what they had to say.
vfx,2ukio4,89bottles,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:26:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have. Certainly some of them will tell you that they feel as a woman they have to do more than a man to prove themselves.  I do accept that there are sexist individuals in the industry, and that women will likely have an (unquantifiably) tougher route to the top than men. I'm just not convinced that this is the primary underlying cause of the male/female ratios we see in different departments.  In my view, as the industry has become increasingly pressurised, the ability to consistently produce nice images has become such a valuable currency that sexism (or any other ism) gets pushed to the sidelines."
vfx,2ukio4,MrSkruff,3,Tue Feb 3 09:57:51 2015 UTC,"I've sat in many vfx interviews over the last 20 years, and heard many sexist comments including: ""She's a bit big, the asian clients might be intimidated by her"",  ""she's too ugly"", ""She seemed like a bitch"". etc.   Sometimes its more subtle than that, e.g it's contract renewal time; ""Well, she doesn't like coming out go-crating, playing paint ball and going to strip clubs with the rest of us, she's not a team player, I don't think we should renew her contract.""  I certainly think the industry is biased."

vfx,2ukio4,Sloore,-2,Tue Feb 3 01:06:17 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily sexism at all. Personality & appearance count for a lot in any client-facing or leadership position, for both men and women.  I've seen plenty of males passed over for jobs & promotions because they're too abrasive, too scruffy, too mumbly etc. - and in most cases the job goes to the better-looking or more personable candidate, be they male or female.  Being a team player is important, too - but paint-ball & strip clubs are not the norm for extra-curricular activities. I've worked in VFX for about 20 years, and I've only heard 'strip club' suggested as an after-work activity a couple of times. The usual team bonding exercises are just beer, movies, board games, beer, LAN parties, research field-trips pertinent to the job, beer and movies. Adventure excursions (paint-ball, rock-climbing etc.) happen too, but not as often. A female co-worker who consistently chooses not to participate in any of those things will be shunned, yeah - but so will a male."

vfx,2uis5b,hyperanim8or,9,Mon Feb 2 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"There were a huge slew of us who didn't get credited on Harry Potter 2, but the director's kids (who were on screen in non speaking roles for all of 10 seconds) both got credits.  The fact is that VFX is invariably the largest department on any movie these days, so they're constantly looking for ways to cut down our credit runtime, which is why you'll often see VFX credited as just a mass block of ""artists"" and frequently in a smaller font than anyone else.  If VFX were unionized, then we could negotiate for credits (just about everyone else IS unionized, which is why the caterers invariably come before VFX), but we're not, so I don't see that changing any time soon."
vfx,2uis5b,kyoseki,7,Mon Feb 2 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"After a few films you won't really care any more. Manually add your name to IMDB, that's all that matters. Nobody stays to watch the credits anyway. If you're in vfx for the glory, you're in the wrong business."
vfx,2uis5b,Kelmk,3,Tue Feb 3 02:02:55 2015 UTC,"Harsh truth is no. These are things only a larger group representing artist ""Unions"" can enforce. Sometime the VFX company will strike a deal or the production finds the credits important."
vfx,2uis5b,CodeRedFox,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"These are truth-things. Actors have a contract and a guild which dictates how and where they get screen credit.  VFX often times doesn't have much specific about credits in their contract and VFX doesn't have a union to back it up. Productions generally tell a vendor they are going to be allowed a certain amount of credit space at the end of a film.  Oftentimes, some vendors choose to just include their principals (producers, creative directors, and leads) because they don't have room for everyone and if they tried to decide who gets a credit, would likely leave somebody out.  We've all been there. Keep updating IMDB, keep working, and you'll get credit. The experience is likely more valuable."
vfx,2uis5b,breakfstmachine,2,Thu Feb 5 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"Don't ever put too much hope on screen credits. It's amazing to see your name on the big screen, especially for mom. But unfortunately credits are usually limited and get screwed up often. When clients ask me to submit a list for my team they usually set a max number of lines. If they don't, I'll submit everyone and let them come back with cuts or requests to reduce. Also we're sometimes asked to submit credits before the project's near complete... one time before the team was even established! So we put who we thought was going to be on the show, only to have it change later. Some people who never touched a shot got credit, and others who spent long hours for months didn't get their names in at all. It was sad, and hard to explain as for many of them it was their first big Hollywood film :(  Many times names will get misspelled, job titles incorrect, etc. On one of the biggest superhero films last year (won't say which) someone I know was given two high-level titles even though he only did one job... somehow a name was deleted and the two titles combined with a ""/"" between them. Shit happens.  Credits are cool for bragging points, but I'm more concerned with future job opportunities and put more worth in my credit list on IMDb and LinkedIn. That's where people really look to see what you did."

Often times we send it months before the delivery, so, if some new people come on at crunch time, they often wont get into the credits. Credits are often limited to the amount of space they feel like giving or contractual obligations to the primary vendor.   We work for low budget film makers, and as such, usually get all the credits on features. However, I can say on a movie like Stretch, there are a number of people who came on in the last week, that didn't get credit. Very sad.   I, for one, have been over credited once. On Spiderman (2001) I, and the rest of my team were credited with 2D supervisor credits for paint and clean up work. That was pretty great as a low mid/high junior artist. Those lockers behind Pete when he punches Flash, look great though... 2D supervisor worthy.   *edit: commas"

So there are certain drawbacks..."
vfx,2uis5b,Sloore,1 point,Wed Feb 4 07:45:50 2015 UTC,"Credits are usually negotiated pretty early, and VFX vendors usually have to negotiate well in advance for a set number of credits.  Every other job in production does the same thing - but most other segments of the film industry are unionised, and better able to negotiate for the appropriate number of credits.  As an industry, we're pretty poorly represented by unions, and because we're post production, there may be hundreds more of us involved at the end of a project than there were when the credits were negotiated. So yeah, we get snubbed en masse. Eventually you stop caring, because everything you want to show goes on your reel anyway.  Remember, though, that (until both parties have signed) every clause of every contract between you & your employers is up for negotiation. You're perfectly entitled, next time, to include a clause that guarantees you a bonus in lieu of a screen credit. This makes it in your employers' best interests to make sure you're one of the 'lucky' ones when the final list is submitted. Or they can strike out that clause. Or they can talk you down to a T-shirt. Whatever. It's up to you to decide how important it is to you and put a value on it."
vfx,2uis5b,Helicobster,1 point,Thu Feb 5 06:12:16 2015 UTC,"Disney has rules that only a specific number of people will be listed on credits as do most production companies, and typically the credits have to be given a certain amount of time in advance with late adds being omitted.   Typically the people who are listed on credits are principals and not subordinates unless there is room.   Since vfx is usually the last credit on the roll before the music it means that we typically have a lot of people cut from the process. With only the principle house getting major credits, and subcontractors getting supervisor credits if they are lucky, a company name mention, or nothing at all. For example on Iron man 3 the listed vfx credits on the roll was around 300 people when in reality the real amount of vfx workers was around 1900. You will more often than not be omitted."

vfx,2ufp6g,merekisgreat,1 point,Mon Feb 2 04:11:33 2015 UTC,Nice piece. I have a few questions for you. Can you describe ur workflow for most of the shots? Did you film it? Or did you composite it using a single frame of the footage. If so did you you rotoscope it? I'm just confused how you used live footage you shot and then you isolate certain aspects to go in front and behind of the cg objects. The only way I know how to do this would be to film the shots or use still pictures and then in Photoshop get all my masks together and import to AE where I can track it but those shots don't look like they where tracked. I saw the breakdown but alittle more info would be sick. Thanks!
vfx,2ufp6g,Thefunkyfunker,1 point,Sun Feb 8 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes I shot everything. The camera was handheld and was not translating in space so there's no parallax. A simple camera tracking in AE would do the trick.   Here's the process I took in After Effects:   Stabilize the footage using Warp Stabilizer Camera track in AE Create a camera based on the track Freeze the first frame Rotoscope out building/sky/etc Transform those layer into a 3D layer   Since the camera was created based on the tracking, changing the layer into a 3D layer would make it stick to the scene."
vfx,2ufp6g,Thefunkyfunker,1 point,Sun Feb 8 08:00:21 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the reply and in depth description. I was up all night trying to figure it out. Another question:  For some shots you had moving water. How did you deal with that since it was only a single frame? Did you mask out the water and then just add the frozen images on top?   Did you work at all in Photoshop? Or did you do all roto work inside after effects? If so ur roto work is killer!
vfx,2ufp6g,Thefunkyfunker,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"The single frames were only used as a mask for the buildings and were placed on top of the live footage.   All roto in AE, it was quite simple to do since the buildings have straight lines. A little bit of feather makes it look good."

vfx,2ufp6g,Thefunkyfunker,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:40:44 2015 UTC,Same concept; just used a frame when the bus wasn't in frame.

More than half this video is just video, I am almost thinking you are selling yourself as a good cameraman, not necessarily as someone who is working with software.  If you want to sell yourself as a vfx/mg artist than you need to focus on that and only show stuff that took a considerable amount of time and know-how to construct. I wouldn't add cleverly-shot video clips as filler.   Stick with showing the most advanced stuff you've worked on. I can see you have done some cool work, you just need to stress it a bit more and convince the viewer that you have a niche skill set.  Good luck, it's a tough industry."

vfx,2ud7vp,cranialgames,2,Sun Feb 1 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"I was worried the intro was going to be terrible, but it was actually pretty good in terms of execution and aesthetic. Not sure what it says about your brand but that's probably an entirely different conversation.  The footage you've shot is great but there are quite a few filler bits in there that lack context like the CG heads and the audio visualisation. Either add context to show how they were used or get rid.  Not a lot of text in there. the lower third/intro thing for whatshername is nice and clean, but I think you'd benefit from showing more varied examples of text used as a key part of a larger piece."
vfx,2ubgy1,PresidentUtopia,3,Sat Jan 31 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Having work in progress is absolutely valid as long as it shows something constructive. It doesn't have to be a completed shot, but it has to show something you want them to take notice of, not just ""here's something I spent 5 minutes on, it looks like crap, but it'll look better later"".  Maybe you have a particle system that has fantastically interesting and intricate motion, but you haven't figured out how to render it yet (or you lack the computing power to do so), then by all means include a flipbook of it, but don't show a basic particle effect that's a placeholder for something you'll figure out later unless there's something else in the shot you specifically want them to take notice of."
vfx,2ubgy1,kyoseki,2,Sat Jan 31 22:17:35 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a bad idea. It is a way to show prospective employers that you're taking up personal projects - which shows initiative and that you are keen to learn.

They wound up releasing two separate versions of the film, since we only had some of the shots done in time for the European release which came a few days before the US release."

Despite the work on guardians being impressive to some(it is impressive), it's not like complete cg characters haven't been in action scifi films in the last 15 years.   Planet of the apes is only dinged as it is a sequel. It's a far more weighty film and I can't think the academy would ever pick a comic book movie over movies that have deeper themes.   I understand the weights they show for GotG but I think the perceived ""important films"" will always trump the current trend in popcorn movies.  I may be showing  my personal bias here show, but I don't think GotG will be remembered in 10 years for any reason(it's a fun film but other than Chris Pratt and Bradley cooper it seemed liked every other comic book film to me) where as interstellars effects will probably be a landmark like 2001 in trying to attain accuracy through state of the art techniques."

Remember that the nominations are voted on by the VFX branch, while the overall Oscar is voted on by the Academy as a whole, who are, by and large, morons.  As David S Cohen puts it, the best actor Oscar doesn't go to the actor who turned in the best performance, it typically goes to the actor who did the most acting (consequently Eddie Redmayne is a lock for this one after his portrayal of Hawking, unless anyone sees him in Jupiter Ascending, but I suspect nobody will go see that movie).  Guardians will likely get it because it certainly has the most VFX, even though Apes & Interstellar probably have better, more believable VFX."

Better yet, try to do it sometime. That may mean doing 'artistic' things if you are a coder, and vice versa (a distinction that is exaggerated anyway).   Realize that a vfx artist's job is to deliver healthy assets. If your assets look really cool but they don't function then you are only doing half your job.

I've been seeing more and more of this kind of thing as a result of departmental structures, pipelines and the push for maximum ""efficiency"". Pipes and departments are a powerful and efficient approach when dealing with lots of the same stuff (character work especially) but it can choke to death anything that's more multi discipline. Assets are passed along for feedback only to sit in limbo until the schedule allows the next department to look at it. Schedules are made for most efficient use of the people in each department at any one time, which often leaves department priorities conflicting.  So, from your example, the fx guy probably built his rig and sent renders along, and in an ideal world the compositor would try it out soon after, and give feedback, which would be rolled into the next version and future shots.  What I find happens too often these days is that the compositor would be busy on a different shot, probably one of the hundred or so 2d-only shots that get prioritised at the start of the show, too busy to pick it up. The fx guy can't afford to wait so moves along. When the compositor finally picks it up it's considered ""finished"" for the fx guy and he has dozens of other shots to work on and no time for the compositors request.  I second Bluurgh's comment about communication. Especially when it comes to educating your production staff to make sure the schedule works in practise and not just on paper."

Looking at how things get dirty.  How light bounces off of things. Here's one that often messes with people,  why do things look different in a store like walmart ? Almost nothing has a shadow there.  If it does it is directly under it,  and if it gets off the ground the shadow is almost immediately filled in.  Watching how stuff like that works can make your stuff blend in and look normal.  The best things you do look like they belong in the scene."

Conquering those challenges will only help you to see the similarities and apply a new approach to vfx. What better way to fine tune how you approach the composition of a composite when you take an abstract look through more classical art? One of the matte painters I work with loves to work in ink or watercolor doodles into his works.

vfx,2tq51t,maxwood,3,Mon Jan 26 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"Ah yes of course, the ubiquitousness of vex. How foolish of me to forget.. the vex.  Can you recommend any other resources?"
vfx,2tq51t,MrSkruff,2,Mon Jan 26 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"The Peter Quint stuff mentioned above is good.  Really learning Houdini is learning a bunch of different areas. Fortunately, you can do a lot in Houdini without learning every bit of it because there's typically many ways of doing something.  So a learning path might be:  SOPs   Basic nodes & parameters Beginner Houdini Geometry (points/verts/prims/detail) Attributes Groups Expressions The important nodes (add, blast, attribcreate, attribute, timeshift, attribcopy, group, attribpromote, merge, etc...  ok there's a lot of important nodes) VEX/VOPs/Wrangles Advanced Houdini Geometry (volumes/vdbs/packed prims) Animating/keyframing   That's obviously a small part of Houdini, but once you understand SOPs the rest will come easier. You'll need to learn DOPs at some point, which is a bit confusing. Mantra and /out is important. CHOPs less so.  Basically learn SOPs really well, it's the workhorse of Houdini."

Not all nodes offer a VEX mode either, though there are a lot of nodes, like the Point SOP, that you could essentially re-build in a VOP that would outperform the ""old way"" by an order of magnitude.  I've been converting some of my old methods that relied heavily on Point SOPs, or multiple Point SOPs over to VOPs and what might have taken a few seconds to update per frame with several hundred thousand particles is scrubbable now.

vfx,2tpusd,eatmyflakes,9,Mon Jan 26 13:26:52 2015 UTC,"I just finished VFX supervising a movie. Make sure to write down the name of the shot, lens and camera info, and the time of the day for every shot. If you are in pre-production or have an animatic made, make sure the Director, DP and actors know about it. It is great to have a little version of the movie made before you make the movie so everyone knows what they are doing and not blankly staring at a blank green screen and not reacting or not knowing what they are supposed to be looking at. If you are doing set extensions or wanting to recreate a scene with set reconstruction very quickly and efficiently or you are doing a visual effect on an actor and you want to recreate them as a digital double on your computer and you don't have an expensive LIDAR scanner, take lots of photographs of sets and actors for photogrammetry. You will save so much time and money having an exact digital replica for your Set Data assests library. Also do a lot of practice taking photos for photogrammetry quickly, because you don't want an entire film crew waiting on you forever. No one will know what you are doing, but explain it to them after your done later. When you are done with taking photos for photogrammetry take a picture of your notes and your phone for the exact time you took the photos. It can help you sort out and have your photos organized already before you take them off your camera and not having to go on a scavenger hunt and look and guess for what photos were taken for what scene. Also take an HDRI right after the photogrammetry.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TfXXJxDsXw  Advice for working with the crew and people on set. When you are called in, do your job quickly and then get out of the way. Watch out for onset politics. Everyone on set thinks their job is more important than everyone else's job, including the PA's. Never ever, ever touch the camera, only the camera crew touches them. Just ask them what lens they have on it. If it is a multi camera shoot, write down what both the A and B camera lenses are. Craft services table is awesome! While eating at the craft services table for a while, you will have an epiphany and realize why they are credited over VFX artists in the end credit roll. Treat actors like strippers, you don't touch them, they only touch you. Only talk to them when they are on their breaks or are getting ready to shoot a complicated VFX scene. Same thing with the production set designer crew, never touch any of the sets or props they have spent time to put together and set up. Have an iPad, notebook, or phone to write down everything. If you miss writing down one note, it can mean the difference between a couple hours working on a shot, or several months. Same thing with having green screen, make sure the green screen is set up properly. Doing months of roto because you didn't take a couple minutes to pull the green screen sheet over long enough can be painful. For the VFX people that fight over the debate whether to have more or less tracking makers everywhere, if there are absolutely no visible features or you are shooting a blank wall, floor, ceiling, or greenscreen, use common sense and put some bright color tracking markers on it. Also, make sure the camera is actually pointed at them too. Putting up tracking markers is pointless if you don't have them where the scene or visual effect is happening. Also, don't let the producers lowball you on your contract by having them give you film points from them for a lower budget. The investors, studio, and everyone else makes their money first before they have time to award you profit participation points. Look at Digital Domain on Enders Game and Prime Focus on Sin City 2 for examples. Unless you are producing or directing the film yourself, take the money because they can dissolve those points. And last but not least, read the fine print in your contract.  Another helpful link: http://vfxcamdb.com/"

vfx,2tpusd,TurtleOnCinderblock,3,Mon Jan 26 16:07:37 2015 UTC,I can honestly say that's I've never come across too many markers. It seems to be the norm to put as few as possible (I've had to track many a shot where they have done a close up in front of a green screen with no markers in view at all. That just leads to very difficult tracks that usually end up being hand animated and take a lot longer to do.
vfx,2tpusd,rworsl,3,Mon Jan 26 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"I certainly have come across too many tracking markers, intelligent placement of tracking markers is essential.  Manually cutting tracking markers out of frizzy hair will drive you mental."

vfx,2tpusd,phunkaeg,5,Mon Jan 26 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"Have a look at the storyboards first, and come up with solutions for each shot depending on requirements. Definitely have a gameplan on the day, if you can, discuss your concerns with the director before the day of the shoot.  Green screen advice:  Shooting against greenscreen with a fast moving handheld camera will introduce issues of motion blur, and losing tracking markers out of frame. some solutions may be, increase the fps capture on the camera, (mention this early as lighting may need to make adjustments) - adding more tracking markers. or a different type of tracking marker. If you just need to track points, you may be able to use a green tape on greenscreen which is a different tone, this might make it easier to key if it crosses actors hair.  Lighting the greenscreen to the maximum incident level of your actors will help you get the best green key without fringing. To test this, hold up a white card in the actors position, hold up a wratten #99 green filter. The white card should look like its the same color as the greenscreen when looking through the filter.  Be aware of hair. It's a bastard to key, especially lighter colored hair, which is more easily contaminated with spill. If possible, ask if frizzy hair can be tamed. same goes with closeups of arms, legs etc which may have hair, the process of flattening hair so it's close to the skin makes it visually thicker and easier to key. But don't use wet look, as this will introduce reflections of your green screen and add more problems.  Check with costume/makeup departments to make sure the colors of hair and clothes aren't going to make it more difficult to key. (obviously, avoid green clothing for Green screen and avoid blue clothing for Bluescreen)  If you're going to do a 3d camera solve, make sure there are at least one marker visible for each axis. Even if this means adding markers to c-stands and placing them within your garbage matte. But, place them intelligently, in space that won't be crossed by your actors.  Lighting: Make sure you jot down the positions of lights on set including measurements between main light, get hdri sphere photography if you have the setup. (a telefocal lens on dslr on a tripod, and a chrome sphere mounted on a tripod)  Camera: In addition to getting focal length and camera height, you may find that camera angle is also important. If so, make a note of that too.  If you're shooting anything on a wide lens, lens distortion may be an issue. Shoot some plates of a checkerboard pattern or distortion grid, so you can profile the lens and correct any distortion on the footage, which can affect your tracks and composites.  I have found that a laser distance meter is very useful for your own notes. You can take your measurements to specific markers to help you scale the scene in post.  In fact, take several tape measures with you too. You may need to take a lot of measurements, especially if it's a live action to miniature shot.  If characters are going to be interacting with CG elements and characters, make sure you have something on set for them to focus on. It's an obvious tell watching the final composite when the actors eyes can't stay on the same place for an object they're supposed to be looking at.  Have your been on set before? do you know the terminology used by the different departments? If not, brush up on some of the more common phrases, so you understand what's going on around you. http://filmandvideolights.com/grip_glossary/index.html http://www.theactorscircle.com/OnSetTerminology.pdf  You'll find that the production will really appreciate having a well informed VFX supervisor on board, it's your business to know everything, from Photography theory, beyer patterns, camera nuances, lighting, color and software capabilities for whoever will be doing the post.  Good luck, have fun!"

Clean plates, lock offs, HDRI, measurements. etc.. As long as you are sticking to the agreed upon effect there won't be any surprises.  For any shots that will need 3D you should have lens info, distance to subject, angle of camera, and hopefully a mirror/grey ball for lighting.

vfx,2tomru,Cant-Find-Username,2,Mon Jan 26 03:17:19 2015 UTC,"I'm an Architectural Visualisation artist with 7 years experience working in the Sydney/Australia sector.  Personally, my aim was always to work in VFX, however, the industry wasn't very stable when i was first looking into it, and I needed something with more of a steady income stream. I did a 2 year course at a local college for 3d Animation. And Promptly got a job as a junior in a well established Arch Viz company. Over the next two years I jumped around to a few jobs until I landed as the Head of Architectural Visualisation in house at HASSELL, one of the big Australian Architecture firms. There I worked for several years, trying to introduce a more cinematic approach to what is generally a very stale requirement in terms of image quality.  I recommendation regarding skills are: Learn 3ds Max + Vray + Photoshop. This is the industry standard. Although some realtime engines like Twinmotion 2 are being used in some places. For 3dsmax, other plugins like Multiscatter will help if need closeups of landscaping or aerials of   You will generally be given 3d models theses days as a starting point. Revit will give you WAY too much detail, Sketchup generally has problems with importing normals correctly, Rhino comes through ok but all curve information needs to be baked to polygons, sometimes from AutoCAD models are generally created in geolocation, meaning when they're imported to 3dsmax, they're millions of kms from the origin point. 3dsmax can't handle this and corrupts the geometry. It'll need to be re-positioned to 0,0,0 in autocad before export.  Architects who model in 3d generally do it as part of the design process, so the 3d model will have been evolving over time. You'll often need to clean up models to make them usable in raytrace engines. For examples, for their drawing documentation, they generally don't need to give glass any thickness, or make sure there are no polygons occupying the same space. However, rendering that type of geometry in a ray trace engine will cause visual artifacts.  You still need to know how to model from the ground up. CAD DWG's are a minimum requirement, so being able to use autocad to clean up and re-origin drawings is essential.   In terms of personal skills, I've found that concentrating on overall look, and speed of delivery is paramount. Work smart, don't get caught up in the details if you can help it.  If it's a marketing image, then it's more important that the building looks beautiful than the bricks are perfectly scaled.  But if its for documentation, or visual assessment/sun study then it needs to be accurate over beauty.  At the end of the day, your image will have a stamp on it which says Artists Impression, and you'll need to be covered by public liability insurance to make sure you don't get sued if the building looks different after construction.  It's satisfying to see a building which has been built, that looks just like the visualisation you created all those years ago.  In general, I've found that there is a lot more money in Arch Viz than there is in VFX. Especially with government contracts. That may be isolated to the Australian market. I'm not sure."
vfx,2tomru,phunkaeg,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:40:37 2015 UTC,"this + this a thousand times. I work at a small arch viz / product viz company in Denmark and I've been working on both arch viz stills and films on/off for 6 years now. The model you receive from the client is in 90% of the cases filled with errors you need to fix.  Next up is the turn around. Most of our arch viz films has to be delivered in 6-7 days upon getting the model. So knowing your way around V-Ray and optimizing render settings is a must have. We have a decent render farm, and it's always the rendering that ends up being the main problem.  It's also key to have a good eye for architectural composition when placing the different shots, it's all about communicating the architects goal with the building(this usually comes in a form of buzz words like modernity, calmness, a green spot in the urban jungle etc)."
vfx,2tomru,Zpanzer,1 point,Tue Jan 27 09:15:49 2015 UTC,"I am from a architectural background in terms of study and have 5 years qualifications. I now am doing my portfolio because I want to go into architectural visualisation + vfx. The both go side by side in some companies and they have their separate departments for each, however the skills between them merge so everything you are doing now is very completely useful. I am getting into stuff like nuke now and everything I taught myself in terms of architectural visualisation is very transferable to vfx.  When its pure arch viz your going for, people have told me that it can help if you have an architectural background of some sort, because sometimes it means its easier to pass information onto you and they know you will have good spatial awareness, but tbh if your into vfx anyway and passionate about it you will have great spatial awareness and If your portfolio consists of beautifully done interiors and exteriors then I think the talent will shine through showing that your more than capable. You will also be able to offer different skills to the team, many arch graduates never learnt animation to level you guys do unless we take are own time to do so.  Many people from arch studies go into vfx so I can't see why it can't be the other way around. But hone your skills in both because each one will help each other. In games for example the layouts of towns and buildings are great, but I doubt they were all done by architects, as long as you have a good sense of space and a desire to make beautiful imagery you will be fine bud!

Same joke same horrible effect etc.   I'd be surprised if most of this isn't pre made templates at this point that are used being how similar every single portion of that reel was.   Doing two videos a day that are full variety would be impressive - give me 12 hrs a day and I could do these same shots four or five times and not even blink. The only thing that would hold me back is render times.  Half the shots aren't fully tracked properly and aren't in proper perspective either.

The main thing to remember is that Houdini gives you VERY low level access to everything, it helps to think of it more as a way of manipulating geometry data than as a program designed to give you an end result - for example, if you don't like the way the fluid solver behaves, you can dive inside it and manipulate it's vector & scalar fields directly."

Houdini is node based, similar to Nuke, which is a fundamentally different structure from Maya. Each node has a very specific purpose.  For example, you could put down a ""box"" node and get a cube of certain dimensions. You could then appended a ""transform"" node to output of the box node, and put an expression in the Y component. Then you'd have a box that's moving up and down.  That's an extremely simple example, but every function of Houdini is structured in this way, and you can create some very complicated networks."

I mean yeah, they have the hypergraph and bifrost, but the default method of displaying the stacked functions as tabs or nested folders is unintuitive in the context of other node-based packages.   I like Houdini because it's more like creating functions that you run on input variables and geometry. Maya feels more object oriented, with each object containing child objects like geometry and transforms. It's too rigid."

Having said that, there's some real advantages to a 'live' scene that lives in memory, versus one that has to be 'cooked' before it exists.   Sorta, I mean Houdini does cache the cooked nodes in memory. Its not like it bakes the entire tree every time. Anything downstream of a time dependent node will be recooked, and you can flag a node to explicitly not cache. You can also cache out complex sequences to disk if you don't want to cook the network.  Also with packed primitives you can stream geometry directly to the graphics card, which can handle millions of polys interactively. They also just implemented a graphics deformation of crowd agents which looks awesome, but I haven't used it yet.   for simpler stuff where you need interactivity above all - like rigging, animation, painting, etc. maya will always be more efficient.   Houdini's rigging and animation tools do suck in comparison to Maya, but I think that's more as a consequence of the open framework that makes Houdini so flexible. It can be used to make any type of system, and it has never been specifically geared towards animation or rigging.  I think the lack of preexisting tool sets for animation and rigging are what make it slow in Houdini.  All of that being said, animation and rigging are not my department, so I can't speak to the specific aspects of why Maya or voodoo are better packages to work in."
vfx,2thqdj,userknamework,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"There's two major differences between Houdini and other packages: The first is that rather than performing operations on static geometry, you're actually building a network of operators that get evaluated every time something changes, at any point you can go into an operator and change it's settings and those settings continue all the way down the chain, think of it like 3DS Max's modifier stack or Maya's hypershade, but taken to a ridiculous degree.  Second, Houdini gives you lower level access than any other 3D software package, most of it's operators are, in turn, built on smaller, more granular operators or written in Houdini's native operator language, VEX, which is like Renderman shading language but generalized to all 3D operations - its fluid solvers, for example, are really just containers for operations on scalar & vector fields. In any other program, those operations aren't exposed, whereas, in Houdini, they are. So you can unlock the network, dive inside and monkey with them, or pull parts of the network out and use them in ways they weren't intended to be, like building vector field based wavelet turbulence into particle based dynamics."

Back on the Wild I was the first rigger that was tasked with evaluating it for production [there was 3 companies involved with that project technically speaking]. A few of us old core guys were building stuff since Houdini 2 and that was before there was proper FK/IK.  They flew a few Pixar people up to go over it [including head of character whos running House of Cool now] and they liked the setup. It helped that we had a few ex ILM guys roll over to set the rigging/control standards so every rig was setup with the same channel groups and control structure.  That being said there was about 10-12 decent houdini creature guys but today there's probably 2 of them that are still into rigging in maya and the rest are doing FX. FX is one of the highest paid positions at a VFX studio compared to rigging so a bunch of guys used that houdini experience to switch positions.  Other than that it's the classic chicken and egg scenario, you can't hire houdini animators because there isn't any to hire, etc.  These days I don't rig much other than vehicles, and most of the setups is usually shit blowing up/metal deforming."

It's the subtle things that don't work intuitively that drive me nuts, and would drive any animator up the wall.  For example, when I click on a node, I expect all of the keyframed channels to automatically load into the channel editor... which is what happens, but only on the transforms for some reason and only on the object level.  Other attributes will not automatically load, you will have to manually load every god damn channel, which is fucking retarded in itself.  This behavior only seems to happen on the object level though, but on the SOP level, nothing will automatically load into the channel editor, even on a transform node.  Then you have the colors of the curves, translate and scale are RGB, which is nice because you can understand which axis you're editing... but then rotation is its own fucking weird ass color.  What the fuck is wrong with people at SideFx?  Make them all consistent so I can tell what the fuck I'm looking at.  XYZ -> RGB.  ALWAYS.  This one really drives me nuts though, if you're viewing more then one curve at a time (like translation for example) it's apparently impossible to create only one keyframe on one of those curves.  So if you want to create a keyframe from the channel editor, you have to change your view to only view that curve, create your keyframe and then go back and select all of the curves you had loaded to view them again.  Often times I will be zoomed into one channel and not realize I've set multiple keyframes on every other channel that loaded into the channel editor.  And because it seems to almost work randomly when it decides to auto-load the channels, this can get really confusing.  There is also no way to load all of the keyframes on an object that is loaded into the channel editor.  So in the above example, after I've created my single keyframe on rotate Y for example, I have to click all of the other channels I want individually to re-load them into the channel editor.  I can't simply click the name of the object ""/obj/sphere"" for example, which sits above all of the channels.  Clicking on that actually does nothing... Thanks SideFx!  In fact, if you have all of your channels loaded and you decide to try to click on the object name above those channels, guess what?  It will unload all of your channels for you.  You probably didn't want to do that if you clicked on the name object, but that's what happens anyways.  Wanna move all of the keyframes for a whole curve all at once?  Sorry, but you can't.  You're going to have to select all the keyframes for the curve manually, either by dragging a large selection box over them or by manually clicking on them one by one.  This matters because now you have to only display the curve you want to move...  But wait, what if you want to move your whole curve and then view another curve?  Well go ahead and try it, and you'll lose your selection... FUCK.  And that loss of selection is NOT undoable.  In fact, changing the curves you view always results in you losing your selection, which is annoying as shit because you often have to change the curves you're viewing.  Not a single thing I listed is a problem with Maya, and the list goes on and on and on.  There is just a massive gap between Houdini and Maya in multiple departments relating to workflow, intuitive design and all manipulators that we use all the time.  Maya is just so far ahead then Houdini in this department."

This program isn't exactly Blender, but it's not as good as Maya and that's a sad truth being that Maya's core has remained largely unchanged since its introduction almost 20 years ago.

vfx,2thqdj,MrSkruff,-6,Sun Jan 25 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know anyone else who does as much keyframe animation for fx in Houdini as you appear to. I mean - the whole point of Houdini is that you make everything as procedural as possible to avoid that.   That's because you've never met anyone anywhere near as productive as me.  I run circles around Houdini users all fucking day.  Ask someone who is the most productive Fx artist they've ever worked with and you might hear my name.  The reason I'm using keyframes so often is because I get shots finalled by addressing shot notes, which often require tailored animation of transforms, fields, goal objects, particle params, whatever the note is requesting.  To be perfectly precise with your values, you're going to need keyframe animation to address shot notes.  Linear functions do not offer enough control."
vfx,2thqdj,Abominati0n,4,Sun Jan 25 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"Fuck dude, you sound like such a sour cunt.  You need to have a look at the tone of your replies in this thread. Because they are pretty fucking offensive.   Houdini is only good for fx? But Maya is better?  We had Marcos and the other Autodesk engineers come and show us Maya. Some good stuff, but it's a poor poor version of VOPs.   Can you please calm down. It's not needed."
vfx,2thqdj,DerekVonSnitzel,2,Sun Jan 25 09:27:04 2015 UTC,"I spent a couple days this week building a snow system for a character running through it, never opened the curve editor once. Since I did not animate the character, perhaps you could tell me exactly what I was supposed to use the curve editor for?  Perhaps you think I should manually animate the emission from each foot up and down as he runs through?"
vfx,2thqdj,kyoseki,-3,Sun Jan 25 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"perhaps you could tell me exactly what I was supposed to use the curve editor for?   Addressing shot notes dude.  Are you planning to never touch the snow system and simply run it for all your shots?  Okay great, I've done that before actually, but that really doesn't require much work at all.  So are you saying all you do is setup procedural systems and run them?  Wtf?  I am way more productive then that.  The system I setup in Maya looked as good as real snow and it me about half a day to setup... and I used it for two movies.  I might've re-simmed the snow like 5 times with different settings for noise n stuff, but otherwise I used the same setup for approximately 30-40 shots on two separate films.  I know this because I had to get the cache back online (it had been archived) and I never re-simmed the cache for the 2nd movie...  I specifically remember running the first snow sim at lunch (they were very large caches at the time) and coming back and it was basically perfect from version 1...  But I don't consider half a day of work to be ""work"".  Rendering the 30-40 shots was a piece of cake, load camera -> props -> render.  And so I moved on to far more interesting, difficult tasks which actually required some skill.  These other tasks actually require intelligence and artistic finesse.  Ambient snow does not.  I'm doing some slightly procedural Fx right now.  Muzzle flashes to be exact.  Every fucking shot is different and they want every blast to go in a different direction than the direction that the gun is facing.  So it has to be customized... as you would expect because you get paid to do shit, not to set shit up.  And doing shit means animating something, and there is no way I'm going to do that with an expression.  They draw the direction they want the gun blast to shoot and I fucking make it happen."

Linear interpolation between two keys doesn't require the graph editor, but I digress. The editor has been redone in 14, you should check it out. I started as a character Animator before moving into fx, lighting, and pipeline, and yeah it's not as good as  Maya but hardly as bad as you're making out."

I've been doing Fx for 12 fucking years, you don't need to tell me how to use a fucking fit function.  I said Houdini is shit for basic keyframe animation.  The fit function is not keyframe animation is it?  Your stupidity is making me even more angry."
vfx,2thqdj,Abominati0n,2,Sun Jan 25 21:50:21 2015 UTC,"Lol, if you say so.   Most of the time if I have to animate something I only need a linear transformation between two values at two times:  fit($F,10,180,-20,160) or at most a three layer hscript of smooth(fit01(fit($F,90,360,0,1)^3,12,34) Not that I've ever actually used a monstrosity like that. Maybe if I needed to vary the emission of rubble sizes over time in an exponential way.   When I do need a curve it does tend to be brief. Maybe once every dozen shots or so in my last 7 years of Houdini use. So, maybe a hundred times or so, or fewer.   There's enough I hate about maya to put up with a little eccentricity in the key frame editor. Like a hot girlfriend with a chipped tooth or a scar on her philtrum. No biggie."

Perhaps pipelines with separate tools like Mudbox, Katana, Arnold, and Nuke be more the way things are headed, anyway, and the idea of doing almost everything in one product might fade away.

Maya has plugins available for most things, but the nice thing about using Houdini is that since everything ships with the program, everything works together - it is, for example, easy to build custom simulation attributes into a piece of geometry that you can then pass along to a custom shader to perform specific shading related tasks."

vfx,2thqdj,Abominati0n,2,Sat Jan 24 21:53:13 2015 UTC,"Maya is a far better 3D program overall.   Disagree.   Our studio is transitioning to Houdini for our lighting pipeline. We still have Maya for using VRay and animation, but Mantra is a solid rendering engine that we are using exclusively on several of our shows. Maya just can't handle the amount of data that we need to push through our pipeline. Maya is also really limited on the control over the low level data.  Any FX artist will tell you that Houdini blows Maya out of the water. We had a discussion with the bifrost creators and afterwards the Houdini guys said to each other, ""...so it's VOPs, but more limited?"""
vfx,2thqdj,userKname,-2,Sun Jan 25 00:21:45 2015 UTC,"Our studio is transitioning to Houdini for our lighting pipeline.   Because Mantra is cheaper (practically free).  It's a good renderer no doubt, and the alternatives (Vray, Arnold and Prman) are not nearly as cost effective.  But that does not make Houdini as a 3D program better then Maya.   We still have Maya for using VRay and animation   And the reason they stuck with Maya for animation is because it's a better program for animation.  No surprises there.  I assume your studio also does rigging, some modeling and probably UVing in Maya as well.  Feel free to go ahead and do those things in Houdini and then come back to me and let you know how it went.  Maya is a better program for almost all of Visual Fx.  Even for Fx there are quite a few things that Maya can do better then Houdini that no one cares to acknowledge because Houdini's only strength is in Fx, so everyone has switch to it almost entirely."

Feel free to go ahead and do those things in Houdini and then come back to me and let you know how it went.     I will! It went great! We did all of our lookdev in Houdini for the most recent show. Having the ability to layer attributes, groups and load the geometry as packed fragments made the workflow really efficient.  Rigging is done in Maya. I don't think anyone would argue that Houdini is better for animation or rigging.   Even for Fx there are quite a few things that Maya can do better then Houdini that no one cares to acknowledge because Houdini's only strength is in Fx, so everyone has switch to it almost entirely.   Quite a few? What do you consider to be better in Maya?"
vfx,2thqdj,userKname,-3,Sun Jan 25 02:39:21 2015 UTC,"Quite a few? What do you consider to be better in Maya?   Oh man, that would be a very long conversation.  This could literally become a 10 page write up on the differences between the two programs.  And no one in this thread or on this sub has shown me enough genuine understanding of the 3D process to justify my time to respond in such great detail.  However, I will be brief:   Particles.  This is honestly the biggest one, because about 60% of Fx require them.  Houdini has always had terrible particles since day 1 and H13's DOP particles aren't really any improvement unfortunately.  The creation and runtime expressions in Maya are really essential to good particle Fx and they really aren't possible at all in Houdini.  Yes you can do similar things technically (and that's always what I have to do) but it's not the same.  Just adding a pow expression to life at the birth of the particle is completely impossible in Houdini.  In Maya I can write 4 lines that will give random relationship based values to lifespan, mass, radius and initial velocity in 20 seconds and you could finish a large portion of particle Fx with those attributes.  So in defining a relationship at the birth of the particle, you could for example say that larger objects live longer, but don't move as fast and have more mass so they are less affected by turbulence and other forces and you're off to the races, almost finished with some nice sparks or debris chunks or smoke, etc.  In Houdini you cannot add these attributes until the particle is created and already assigned a lifespan.  So now you have an issue of connecting the dots of these attributes are re-adjusting everyhing for particles that were just born.  It can become a fucking mess, especially with particles with a very low lifespan like sparks.  Anyways, back to the topic...  Goals in Maya don't really exist in Houdini.  Again you can do similar things of course, but the features just don't exist in Houdini, you have to create something similar and it can take a full day to get something work correctly... and that something will break and it will be far more complicated to hand off to someone else then a scene in Maya that simply uses goals.  Emitting particles from a texture is a huge feature that Maya that Houdini does not have.  Yes you can do a workaround as always, but the problem with the workaround is what?  It can be so god damn slow and memory intensive in Houdini that it literally becomes impossible to do the same type of Fx.  I've been telling Houdini users this for 10 years, ""Speed is a feature"".  It's the reason Fume and Max are so popular for Fx.  Of course everything can be done in Houdini... technically.  But that does not mean that it will be practical, even for a film.  Whereas Maya is fucking lightning fast, all the time. Fields.  Holy fuck.  The fields in Maya are so much more feature rich and so much faster then Houdini's fields it's just sad honestly.  The volume axis field in Maya takes a massive dump on every field in Houdini and I've tried to get SideFx to realize that.  I could load Maya right now, emit 1 million particles and animate a volume axis field in 60 seconds and setting up something even half as good would take days for a senior Fx artist and it would be painfully slow... and it wouldn't have nearly as many features... and it wouldn't work with fluids and particles in exactly the same way like the volume axis field does in Maya.  Houdini just added a Pop Axis field, which is a nice try, but it only works with POPs and it's no where near as full featured as Maya's volume axis field. Cloth.  Everyone knows nCloth is 10x better then Houdini's cloth systems.  I'm hoping the new solver in H14 finally fixes their cloth issues for good, but H13's FEM solver totally fucked up cloth, so the jury is still out on H14's production readiness.  I won't be using H14 in production for atleast a few months because the show I""m on is locked on H13, but H12's cloth was okay and then they got rid of it in favor of the FEM solver for some reason. Hair and fur are also better in Maya, though again this may be changed with H14's new shaping tools.  I personally love the wire solver in Houdini, I think it's one of the most polished, reliable features of the entire package.  But it's let down by the fact that modeling and manipulating anything in the viewport in Houdini is so shitty.  But hopefully H14 changes that atleast in respect to hair sculpting."

Fluids are fields in Houdini, and fields can be applied to any Sim data, including particles.  These complaints make it seem like you're making a lot of assumptions based on your own bad experiences. Do you go on odforce when you experience a problem like some of the ones you've listed? I would imagine they'd give you the same recommendations."
vfx,2thqdj,userKname,2,Mon Jan 26 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"sigh, where to begin?   Particles. This is honestly the biggest one, because about 60% of Fx require them. Houdini has always had terrible particles since day 1   This statement right here tells me you don't know your arse from your elbow.   Just adding a pow expression to life at the birth of the particle is completely impossible in Houdini.    Add a POP Wrangle node: @life = fit01(pow(rand(@id),exponent),minlife,maxlife);   In Maya I can write 4 lines that will give random relationship based values to lifespan, mass, radius and initial velocity in 20 seconds and you could finish a large portion of particle Fx with those attributes   Evidently, you don't understand Wrangle nodes, because they will do the same thing (even before Wrangle nodes were introduced, VEX/VOPs would do this)   In Houdini you cannot add these attributes until the particle is created and already assigned a lifespan.   Who cares? Until it reaches the pop solver, nothing is integrated anyway so it doesn't matter what it's initialized to, it only matters what it's value is at the integration/reaping stage.  It's not uncommon for Houdini artists to leave life at 100 and manipulate it after the sim, computational performance notwithstanding, unless you have an operator that's lifespan dependent it makes no real difference anyway.   Goals in Maya don't really exist in Houdini.   Apparently you are unfamiliar with the Attract POP.   Emitting particles from a texture is a huge feature that Maya that Houdini does not have.    Apparently you are also unfamiliar with the colormap() VEX function. It's trivial to assign a texture color to a point and then use that as an emission attribute or as a scatter density attribute.   I could load Maya right now, emit 1 million particles and animate a volume axis field in 60 seconds and setting up something even half as good would take days for a senior Fx artist and it would be painfully slow...    I'm not completely familiar with the volume axis field/curve, but looking at the tutorials the math seems pretty trivial, I could build that in an afternoon, I've already built something similar a few times, wrapping it up into an OTL is no big deal.   Houdini just added a Pop Axis field, which is a nice try, but it only works with POPs and it's no where near as full featured as Maya's volume axis field.   Now I'm seeing the issue, you expect the program/programmers to build all the tools for you rather than supplying the toolkit and letting you build your own.  The tools that Houdini supplies, the built in operators, are, at best, building blocks that you can tear apart and rebuild, there aren't a lot of effects I've done that used stock Houdini operators. Nearly every single one of them involves breaking them and changing the way they work.  Houdini's advantage over Maya is that you can do this.   Cloth. Everyone knows nCloth is 10x better then Houdini's cloth systems.    Fair enough, I'll give you that. Most of us were extremely unhappy when they got rid of H12's cloth solver and stuck that awful FEM solver in there instead.  Thankfully the PBD/Grain solver in H14 looks to be a viable alternative.   I personally love the wire solver in Houdini, I think it's one of the most polished, reliable features of the entire package   I remember finding it too restrictive, which is why I built my own.  The entire point of Houdini is that you can dismantle all of it's operators and rebuild them to do what you want. Maya doesn't let you do this, if Maya's volume axis field doesn't have a control you need, your only option is to petition Autodesk to add it. In Houdini, I can right click->edit contents and rebuild the tool then and there without having to resort to writing a plugin.  If all you're ever using is shelf tools & presets, I can see why you'd prefer Maya, but we use Houdini because out of the box software just doesn't work the way we want it to and Houdini lets us change pretty much everything without resorting to coding."

vfx,2thqdj,DerekVonSnitzel,-1,Mon Jan 26 07:24:13 2015 UTC,"This statement right here tells me you don't know your arse from your elbow.... Add a POP Wrangle node:   Which would work if I could use the new pop net.  Unfortunately there are some absent features from the new pop net that I need.  I've been on H13 for about 5 months now and I keep running into things that aren't working or are missing with the new dop pops.  I use the new pops whenever I can, but so far I haven't been able to use them much.  I think my last two issues had to do with collisions and fields, but the latest one that I came across (which was literally a few weeks ago) was the absence of the ""ordered"" particle source options... which makes the new pop net unusable for me in this case unfortunately.  If you give the new pop net 4 points for example and you want to exactly 1 point from each 4 source points, it will not do it.  Feel free to try this yourself, you can verify this with a grid with 4 points (though I'm doing this on a deforming prop).   Evidently, you don't understand Wrangle nodes, because they will do the same thing (even before Wrangle nodes were introduced, VEX/VOPs would do this)   You are correct, I did not realize that the Wrangle node executes every time step and on creation, I thought it was only evaluating on creation.  So again, in the case that I can use the wrangle node, this will work very well.  I like the wrangle nodes a lot, but I literally can't use the particle ones very often unfortunately.  But your asshole attitude acts like this a no brainer, but these wrangle nodes are very new concepts in Houdini and they've only been out for about a year or two.  And I'm still mostly using the old pop nets.  But Maya has had this exact same functionality (for particles) for around for 15-20 years... so you can kiss my ass acting all high and mighty about this shit.   It's not uncommon for Houdini artists to leave life at 100 and manipulate it after the sim   Yes, I've noticed that.  And I think it's pretty comical.  It's not uncommon for Maya artists to like their effects to match what is real in nature.  Things that are organized, simple, less complicated and more accurate to the reference that they are working to achieve.  When my spark nears the end of its life, it's going to lose color, lose size, and as a result, lose some mass which will effect the simulation and realistically should not be altered after the sim has been cached.   Apparently you are unfamiliar with the Attract POP.   Again, I would be more familiar if I could use the damn thing.  The attractor POP is sideFx's pretty obvious rip off of Maya's goals, that we've had for over a decade.  And it's great, don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of SideFx ripping off everything that's in Maya... But I still don't understand how I'm supposed to feed goal positions on a per particle basis with this node.  And it really works more like a force, rather then a goal, because I can't get the particles to go straight to their goal position and stop once they arrive.  I'm sure I'm missing something here, but I thought atleast ""goalx = float(@id)"" would work, but it's erroring.  And playing with this node for 5 minutes I'm seeing quite a few bugs happening, seems like the dop pop sim isn't resetting when I'm checking / unchecking the ""Use Vex"" checkbox.  But this is really quite easy in Maya, as most things are.  For example, if I want each particle's goal to be the world space position of the UV coordinates on the surface that they were emitted from, it's as simple as clicking a checkbox and typing ""goalU = parentU; goalV = parentV"", which means that the surface position that emitted the particle will be where the particle is goaled to.  That's the most common use of goals in Maya.  It looks like SideFx possibly matched that feature with this node, kinda sorta, but it's not as clear as day as you seem to think it is.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if what I'm looking for is still not possible with this node or maybe even at all (barring a day's worth of RnD).   Apparently you are also unfamiliar with the colormap() VEX function. It's trivial to assign a texture color to a point and then use that as an emission attribute or as a scatter density attribute.   I have done this a lot over the years, but I still haven't found a perfect solution for this... Yes I am aware that you have a billion workarounds for features you don't have, but as I said before, you cannot emit from a texture (on a surface).  This is more of a problem then you seem to realize (because you've probably never used Maya).  If you have geo with 1+ million prims, you don't want to be scattering points on it because it's going to be too slow.  And even if you do, you may have to subdivide that geo more then once to get even a fraction of the resolution that you need for the texture detail that you want to emit from.  If you simply add point color to the base geo and then scatter based on Cd, you have the issue of being limited to the point resolution of the base geo (and not the resolution of the texture itself).  If you scatter points first and have them inherit UVs,  Maya does not have this problem.   Now I'm seeing the issue, you expect the program/programmers to build all the tools for you rather than supplying the toolkit and letting you build your own.  .... The tools that Houdini supplies, the built in operators, are, at best, building blocks that you can tear apart and rebuild, there aren't a lot of effects I've done that used stock Houdini operators. Nearly every single one of them involves breaking them and changing the way they work.   Ah yes, like I haven't heard that statement before.  I know all about the difference between Maya and Houdini, and what you think Houdini is, but in reality they are both artistic tools designed to perform the exact same tasks.  For the most part, we do not create programmer art with no real-world application.  I started on 5.5, right when they started the apprenticeship program.  The program has gotten a million times better... but what I find fascinating is that people like you still think you're using a program that's powerful because it's made up a billion ""legos"" that can be used to create 3D art, when in reality you're just buried in clutter to do the most basic shit in the 3D world.  If Houdini remained a program based on the ""lego"" approach to 3D creation, it would have died a miserable death.  I remember being told 10 years ago by people like you that you could model characters in Houdini just as well as you could model them in Maya.  I am not fucking joking.  And there are still some people who would argue that.  But it's painfully wrong to think so short sighted.  What you seem to lack is an understanding that speed, workflow and simplicity is a necessity in our industry.  Shortcuts are required.  Minimizing scene complexity is a good thing.  If you break our work down to the pixel, technically I can paint everything you can do in Houdini pixel by pixel in MS Paint.  Is that practical?  No, it's not.  Where do you draw the line?  If I can do something in 30 seconds in Maya and you say, ""hey, I can do almost the same thing in 5 minutes"", do you really think that's acceptable?  I do not.  I have very high standards of speed and efficiency and simplicity.  Your 5 minute version is also going to be much harder to navigate if you pass it on to someone else, while a Maya scene is never anywhere near as complicated as an equivelant Houdini scene.  If Houdini is to be a good 3D program, even for Fx artists, it needs preset tools that are fast, efficient and well designed for artists to use.  The pyro solver is a perfect example of that idea.  I think in H8 or H9 they came out with DOPs and technically it was possibly to make your own fluid solver in it.  In the next version of Houdini I believe they released some pre-made pyro Fx with a fluid solver as well, but it was still really garbage.  No one used that shit for anything because it was slow as fuck and had no features whatsoever.  Yes you could make your own features, but no one did because it was already too slow to begin with.  Every version after that they improved the pyro solver and added features until about H12 when it actually became a good, fast fluid solver.  You're wasting time putting these legos together.  For most of what we Fx artists do, Maya is a far more efficient, far more organized and far more effective artistic tool.  But Houdini does have a huge advantage in customization of course, which I believe is the main reason it is so popular amongst Fx supervisors that no longer actually have to create Fx themselves."
vfx,2thqdj,Abominati0n,2,Wed Jan 28 09:05:08 2015 UTC,"If you give the new pop net 4 points for example and you want to exactly 1 point from each 4 source points, it will not do it.   Emission type - ""All Points"" does EXACTLY this, one particle per point per timestep, setting impulse activation to $F==$FSTART will do it only on the first frame.   But your asshole attitude acts like this a no brainer, but these wrangle nodes are very new concepts in Houdini and they've only been out for about a year or two. And I'm still mostly using the old pop nets. But Maya has had this exact same functionality (for particles) for around for 15-20 years...   The wrangle nodes are just a new way to access VEX. Houdini IS VEX, always has been, none of this particle functionality is new, you can do the exact same shit in an old VOP POP.   so you can kiss my ass acting all high and mighty about this shit.   That's rich coming from the jackass who pompously declares that Houdini won't do shit it's done since it was Prisms.   Yes, I've noticed that. And I think it's pretty comical. It's not uncommon for Maya artists to like their effects to match what is real in nature.    ... and back to high and mighty again? yawn   Again, I would be more familiar if I could use the damn thing.   And that's Houdini's fault is it?   The attractor POP is sideFx's pretty obvious rip off of Maya's goals, that we've had for over a decade.   The attract POP has been in Houdini since POPs have been in Houdini. Just because you didn't know about it when you used Maya's doesn't mean that SESI stole it.   And it really works more like a force, rather then a goal, because I can't get the particles to go straight to their goal position and stop once they arrive. I'm sure I'm missing something here, but I thought atleast ""goalx = float(@id)"" would work, but it's erroring.   Choosing attraction type ""particle"" and setting ""match method"" to ""point per particle"" will do exactly this.   For example, if I want each particle's goal to be the world space position of the UV coordinates on the surface that they were emitted from, it's as simple as clicking a checkbox and typing ""goalU = parentU; goalV = parentV""... I wouldn't be surprised if what I'm looking for is still not possible with this node or maybe even at all (barring a day's worth of RnD).   Any time you emit particles from a surface, they inherit the underlying attributes from that surface, so each particle will pick up the UV from the point it was birthed from assuming there's a UV coordinate on the surface. Plugging that back in as a goal is equally trivial.   I have done this a lot over the years, but I still haven't found a perfect solution for this... Yes I am aware that you have a billion workarounds for features you don't have, but as I said before, you cannot emit from a texture (on a surface).   What do you think a texture on a surface is? It's simply a probability map and emitting based on attributes is something that's done fucking constantly in Houdini.   This is more of a problem then you seem to realize (because you've probably never used Maya).   Used Maya for years before switching to Houdini, I don't hate it (MEL can eat a bag of dicks though, I've never seen a more clumsily implemented language), but Houdini is still vastly superior for high end particle & fluid work.   If you have geo with 1+ million prims, you don't want to be scattering points on it because it's going to be too slow.   The maximum resolution necessary is governed by the texture map, not the geometry of the object. eg. if you have a 1k x 1k texture map, you only need a million points to represent the entire image, so you can do all your scattering in UV space and then wrap those onto the geometry later when you've culled the points you don't want to emit from.  This is all Maya's doing internally when you emit from a texture, it's going to importance sample it and scatter points based on that, then emit from those, you can do the EXACT same thing in Houdini, but you also have control over every single individual step along the way which is the whole fucking point of Houdini.   Where do you draw the line? If I can do something in 30 seconds in Maya and you say, ""hey, I can do almost the same thing in 5 minutes"", do you really think that's acceptable?    Where do I draw the line? The line has always been drawn at the point where preset, out of the box effects just aren't good enough. We DO build our own solvers, because we need to control the effects at that level, a level that Maya simply doesn't give you access to.   Disney's snow solver from Frozen? If you know what you're doing, you can build that from scratch in DOPs, can you do that in Maya? Or are you sitting around with your thumb up your ass waiting for Autodesk to build it?  ... and don't give me the ""programmer art with no real-world application"" attitude, jackass, all of this is done in service of the movie.   If Houdini is to be a good 3D program, even for Fx artists, it needs preset tools that are fast, efficient and well designed for artists to use.    At the high end, preset tools are never good enough, they ALWAYS require custom tools to be built and Houdini gives you the ability to do that at the TD level (assuming you have TDs who know their shit) instead of forcing software to constantly write custom plugins. That's why all of Houdini's tools are basically subnetworks, so that TDs can go in and make tweaks that you would normally have to wait for Autodesk to get around to.  For run of the mill effects, yeah, Maya's fine, but if Maya's effects tools were as comprehensive as you seem to think, you wouldn't need Bifrost, which is really just a half assed Houdini Engine bolted onto the side of Maya."
vfx,2thqdj,kyoseki,-2,Wed Jan 28 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"Maya is a far better 3D program overall. But its gone way downhill over the past 6-7 years, while Houdini has gotten WAY better in the same time. Maya is more at risk of being phased oht before Houdini is. So, yeah."

vfx,2tkpwb,ThePdubz,2,Sun Jan 25 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"Free: try Blender.  The ""industry standard"" depends on what the industry is. Feature films: either proprietary or generally Maya. Video games: usually 3DS Max. Commercials: Maya or C4D for mograph stuff.  If you have a student email (.edu), get on Autodesk and download a student license of Maya.  Focus more on the principles and concepts of CG rather than on the tools. If you learn the theory and such, switching programs shouldn't be more difficult than learning the interface and hotkeys.  Some bonus programs: look into Modo for modeling.  If you're interested in FX or anything procedural, look into Houdini. It's a much steeper learning curve, but quite fantastic.  PS: We need a FAQ for questions like these."

Use your student email and you should be able to use every piece of autodesk software you want for a good 3 years as a free student license. When you are a student take your time to dabble in lots of different software, I recommend to install both maya and max as a start and do a couple of tutorials on both and you will soon realise which one is good for you :). Even if you do learn one for a year then decide you wanna switch, it's not so much a problem because the skills are very transferable. I was a hardcore sketchup user for 4 years and switched to max fluently within a month."

This is in regards to in-game cut scenes and some gameplay stuff.  Granted this is just be my experience and it might not be the majority. For animation, I'd stick with Maya. Learning animation doesn't really differ much software-wise, software being just the tool. It's the concepts that matter and those transfer to other software programs pretty easily."
vfx,2tim0d,throwawaymgmnt,6,Sat Jan 24 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"Throwaway acct.  I have been a manager for around 2 years now. I do maybe 30% artist work. Mostly I provide feedback, manage projects, communicate with different departments, etc.  There's a simplicity about not being management that I miss sometimes. Less politics, more straight forward, less responsibility. I sometimes meet people that tell me they want to be into management. Sure, while you're an artist it looks like we have it easy but you have no idea...  The pressure that middle management gets can be pretty tough. The mistakes you can make have higher impact than the ones you could make as an artist.  In short: you delegate tasks, not responsibility. Somebody fucked up under you, and the project is impacted? Tough shit man, you can't blame your direct reports... it's YOUR fault for not delegating or keeping tabs correctly. You have an underperforming direct report? Why did you hire him to begin with? Or, if he used to perform well, what happened? It's your job to fix it. Otherwise, upper management's perception of your judgement might be impacted. You have to be very very careful about not pissing anyone off. It WILL come to bite you in the ass.  As management you have to strive to be as professional as possible. You can't be saying negative things. These things impact team morale and look bad on you. You can be frustrated but you cannot externalize it.  You have to be an example to your team. You need to arrive before they do and leave after (at least most of the time). Do you wanna be the asshole manager that leaves early every day?  You lose a bit of that super CG speed / edge you had as an artist. But you gain a lot of other things.  Yeah it can be pretty tough, but the rewards are pretty fantastic. You get to make high level decisions that impact the way you work. You can steer projects from a holistic view. You get to see the big picture. You can negotiate deadlines. You can help people realize their potential.   All in all it's very educational in a personal level, at least for me.  It's not for everyone though.  Btw, not replying to comments, throwaway account and I forgot the passoword :D"

Some of the shots are too similar, there's not really anything new (especially the Teddy Bear stuff).  It looks like you need to work on your CG integration a bit. The bear, while almost washed out in some shots, is way too dark when it steps through the bright door. Look at the plate and pay attention to how much lens haze and lightwrap is going on.  The wheeled robot's blacks are too dark as well, but the color matching is nicely done.  The animation in the clay/paperman shots seem a bit off. You can ""feel"" the keyframes and it could use a bit more anticipation and follow-through.  The goldfish is nice :)  I think your strongest parts are the motion design shots.

You want your message clear.  Motion graphics sections are great, but don't go back to stuff that you've already shown though.  Put all the bmx stuff in a row. If it feels like too much then it is and cut it.  Only show the robot tapping the light for that guy, the rest are again too stylized for out of context.

I don't mind the ""repetition"" because everything looks very good. And one can not complain about having some more eyecandy. If you are pursuing a specific job in the industry though, I would recommend making a reel that focuses on just one aspect of your skill set. For what we can see so far, you're a pretty good generalist. And in my opinion, you have a vfx supervisor profile. But most of the time, companies are in the lookout for a specific skill.

There are much more important values you look for in a reel than technical perfection. Creativity, use of tools, resourcefulness, taste and experience. And this guy has those qualities. That's why his reel is ""Fucking incredible"". Are there better reels out there? Sure. But that doesn't take any merit from this one.

From what I've heard from friends over there, the London scene isn't growing, they're under the same pressure that the LA studios were a couple years back (just prior to LA's full collapse). Almost every UK facility now has a Canadian satellite office (in MPC's case, two), DNeg were in dire straits financially (hence the Prime Focus buyout) specifically because they DIDN'T have a Vancouver office, so the studios were passing over them in favor of MPC or whomever did (which is why opening a Vancouver office was their first post buyout move).  ILM opened a UK studio because they wanted access to UK movies - the Bond franchise, for example, is only ever worked on by UK VFX facilities, but they haven't really grown the UK VFX scene, they pretty much just stole a bunch of people from DNeg & Framestore."

I know that jobs attracted by subsidies and tax rebates can go away as quickly as they came. But, no matter what country you're in, most of the feature effects work is done for the same 6 big studio clients. Don't worry about whether Star Wars or James Bond or Age of Ultron are ""UK movies"" -- they are made by the big studios, and are having VFX work done in London because they are (currently) paid the best incentives to have the work done in London. The live-action shoots are often a similar deal, and they could pick up and move filming to another place if the rebate environment got more favorable elsewhere."

This is relevant to the comment above so I'll just cut and paste from a previous comment I made earlier:  ""the first thing you have to understand about the comments coming in from the ex LA workers is that they are people who invested decades building lives and communities to an industry that they grew from nothing only to have it ripped out from under them because of these giveaways. Their technology and skills were stripped out and exported and used to build cheaper versions in distant places based not on merit but on fake ""incentives"". They didn't fail they were basically cheated so I can certainly understand their bitterness and frankly I'm surprised there isn't a lot more anger expressed a lot more often… So cut them some slack, when this has happened to you once or twice in the coming decade of this industry - and the way things are looking it will - I expect you'll have more sympathy for the 'background' of their comments. You have to begin thinking about this beyond your own current benefits, in terms of a global industry and how other people's lives are affected by whats happening.  And here's what I ultimately want: an industry in BC, in California, in the UK - wherever it may grow - where the industry & companies grow organically and survive based on actual merit and real competition - like a real industry. And since you were questioning I'll spell it out for you clearly: I want a stable life in an industry I enjoy working in and have struggled in for over 15 years to build credibility. I want to be able to promise my kid a stable and secure upbringing in a community that I choose to be where I know I can commit to without the fear of my life being pulled away because of a momentary whim from some distance place.

vfx,2tb817,kyoseki,-5,Fri Jan 23 00:43:03 2015 UTC,by not offering subsidies to be competitive? you cant blame a country for wanting to grow its industries. blaming canada is such a lame tired excuse.
vfx,2tb817,sharkweek247,4,Fri Jan 23 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"Ive said this before but I'll say it again:  This is not about competition based on merit, its not a case of ""lack of action"" on the part of one government or another… the subsidies ultimately do little more than enrich already wealthy international corporations at the expense of local communities and lives and further cement our place - yours and mine (assuming you are working in the industry) - in it as completely throwaway and disposable resources. When I say I find the tax incentives disgusting, this is why, not because of my 'background' or personal investment one way or another.    And:   In point form, one by one, here are the reasons I personally find the tax credits horrible: The funds that support the industry in BC and Quebec are coming out of public taxes and are being given away to private foreign companies. This is occurring at a loss for the provinces. It is creating only the appearance of a stable industry that will remain only so long as the provinces continue to finance it. The way it affects you, and me, and anybody working in this industry, is that it is creating a business model where the stability of our lives is currently based completely on the whim of election year politics that could change at a moments notice. It creates a vfx community that is in no way tied to or invested emotionally to its locality.    And be clear about the point of stability - there is no illusion whatsoever at this point that these incentives create an industry or benefit that will last beyond the elimination or lessening of their existence. Every study in every part of the world where this model is occurring finds that this ends up as a loss for the state in which it is implemented. Have you seen the numbers coming out of the UK, released by Parliament recently after long delay? The numbers indicate losses to the UK state over the life of the program that appear to amount to billions or pounds. Have you seen the press releases from the companies currently based in Quebec, Ubisoft etc, about their future plans after the PQ gov announced it was lessening the subsidies? They'll quit and gut the local community without a second thought."
vfx,2tb817,kentm,-1,Fri Jan 23 01:17:51 2015 UTC,"its not just a numbers thing. vancouver has been growing its film industry for the last 20+ years and is a vital player to the city's goals and growth in the future. you seem to skip over the fact that in order to gain the subsidies, studios must employ a large percent of canadians. this makes us canucks much more attractive, keeps us in canada, grows our talent and thus, the industry. (in canada)  lets also not pretend that if subsidies dissappeared tomorrow (which they sure as hell wont) that the jobs would disperse back into the cities they left (sup LA)  the problem isnt the government, isnt the studios, its the idustry. the constant underbidding between studios has driven profit margins so low that the bottom falls out and every studio has to run to the subsidies.   you can blame canada all you want but its not going to bring the jobs back south of the border."

It's an artificially supported industry, the only way Imageworks can turn a profit is to have BC taxpayers cover half it's payroll (thus propagating the underbidding process), you think they'll stick around for one second once that stops?"

vfx,2tb817,kyoseki,2,Fri Jan 23 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but you're wrong. I'm tempted to use the word 'delusional' but that's a bit strong. There is no local canadian industry for vfx. 20 plus years ago the subsidies brought film and tv work to vancouver and they have never subsided - despite strong words from local players there has never been a local industry, it's all bee based on subsidies and whenever there has been the possibility of the handouts lessening the industry has stepped up and demanded for them to continue. Everybody knows what the game is. Except you it seems.    I was there in the early days, I worked for stargate sg1 and I was happy to do so, but in those days the subsidies were placed as 'loss leaders' intended to attract US talent and to spur & jump start a real local industry. Now everybody knows the life of the thing is completely dependent on gov handouts.    Don't kid yourself, the second the subsidies stop the local vancouver vfx industry will collapse. It will head off to wherever the next place is that hasn't gotten the message that tax incentives are a loosing game and think that it's a sexy 'crown jewel' to have, the way vancouver does now.     And my random guess is 90 percent of the vfx workers in vancouver come from elsewhere in the world and would leave at the drop of a hat. SOME local industry you've got there.  By the way, the vfx studios don't benefit from the subsidies other than having the honor of getting the work - and having part of their wages paid. The subsidies go directly to the film production studios, fox, etc, the companies who commission the work to the vendors.    ""Sharkweek247"" educate thyself.

On the other hand... it's a slow day for me, and I feel like typing. So, let's go through it. I'm going to write this as a ground-up overview of rig removal, such that it might be useful for folks who have no experience with it at all.   Rig removal, wire removal, puppeteer removal — whenever we're seeing something that we shouldn't be seeing, us poor saps in VFX are responsible for painting it out. The process of doing so can be trivially easy or just absolutely goddamned impossible, and it's frequently both of those things and everything in between. Depending on the situation, you might find yourself employing one of a dozen various methods for getting your removal done, there's no shortage of options, but they all have one thing in common: they synthesize an answer to the question 'what should we be seeing?""  So, the process starts by asking yourself that question. Depending on the answer, you might deploy one (or multiple) of the following approaches to achieve it:    Split Screen  If you've been given a useful clean plate by editorial, congratulations — your life is simple. Make sure the grain and subtle camera jiggles match, but otherwise you're pretty much done immediately. Roto to taste.  Patch and Track  Build a clean plate, or portions of a clean plate, by using carefully curated frame grabs and matte paintings that sit ""above"" the rigs in the background and get tracked to match the camera movement. Depending on the complexity and depth of the background, you may need multiple ""planes"" of track data to parent your various patches to. Sometimes you'll even need to animate a change in a given patch over the course of the shot, such that it's handed-to and handed-off seamlessly.  Distort and Roto  Scale, stretch, or offset the ""clean"" part of your background and roto your foreground object back over it. This can be as simple as degraining the plate, scaling it up a bit, regraining it, and rotoing the original foreground over the top... or, if the background permits, you can create an adjustment that offsets the background by a-dozen-or-so pixels and use animated masks to ""reveal"" that offset-ed portion wherever a wire appears. (CC Wire Removal in After Effects is basically doing this, using a pinch-together effect instead of an offset effect.)  Paint  Use the Clone Stamp tool to manually replace rig pixels with other pixels, either from elsewhere in the plate or elsewhere in time. If the background is moving, this will be a frame-by-frame process.  Blur  In some situations, you can simply use blurs to obfuscate the rig. If the background is out of focus, for instance, or mostly a single color, you might just over-blur the rig parts and regrain. Similar-to-this-but-different: occasionally, you can use a small solid layer with a four-color gradient sampling the background colors near the corners, and then blurring that. In other words, you create a color blob and then blur it.   Reposition  In some situations (not very often), you can degrain the plate, scale the whole thing up, and scoot it a bit to simply crop out parts of the rig. Regrain and submit. If you get in trouble for doing this, you deserve it.  Obfuscate  In some situations, you can cover the rig with fabricated extreme-foreground objects. ...you psycho.    I have used all of these methods to achieve various rig removals over the years, and typically will use several at a time. Regardless of which tricks I use on a given shot, it starts with the question ""what should we be seeing?"" Once I have that in mind, I'll pick a strategy. Patch and Track is probably my most-common starting point, because it's fairly quick and retains a lot of detail from the existing shot. That said, if the rig is between us and a costumed actor, these days I'll usually just dive directly into Paint mode for that stuff. I'll use some other method for everything else in frame, bear in mind — maybe it's a Paint hack in front of the actor, and a Patch and Track hack behind the actor. Whatever works.  We'll leave it at that for now. There's about three chapters worth of detail and tips for using each method, whereas this post is basically just naming them and saying that they exist. It'd be great to do complete write-ups for all the various contingencies, because for each of the categories above there's about a dozen ways to go about implementing them. (Not to mention that I'm sure I'm forgetting at least one or two.) In the meantime, hopefully this is useful as a jumping-off point.   Good luck!"

vfx,2t7aua,GodPoopsToo,5,Wed Jan 21 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"Match move is an art in its own right. If you want to learn Match move your best bet is to practice and understand the process. There are a few main factors that are extremely important when doing match move.  set measurements and accuracy  camera reports (lens, camera height, distance to wall and foreground actors, etc.) without this you may as well be rolling the dice and hoping an auto solve gets it right, which it wont.  plate distortion, a lens distorts the plate and in order to accurately match move you have to remove this distortion, which means you need lens grids to undistort the plate properly. Having it automatically guess the distortion is a crap shoot you need the distortion grids.  With all this in mind a close track is not an exact track and if you are getting a little slipping then you have to try again. The best way to learn is to try to get it right over and over again. There is no fool proof way to do any of this.  Compositing is a different beast, you should read this book:  http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Compositing-Video-Steve-Wright/dp/024081309X  I cannot recommend this book enough, it teaches you the math and why things are happening.

I only had to do it this way because our small CG team didn't have time for animating the rest of the wing shots and do the particles.

Starting working could be great if the company will push you as an artist, but remember to do your own personal art as well. You can learn extremely fast on the job around the right people. If you feel you will be doing better work there in a year and will be able to grow it could be great.  Think about your 5 or 10 year goal as well, and if this internship will help you get there.   The downside to production is you do not get to explore your own creativity as much. You are told what to do, and have less of a say till you are higher up.  College is a time for experimentation all around, but the cost is of course high. That said the connections and friends I have from school are priceless, and have lead to work all over the world.

vfx,2t26s2,PresidentUtopia,5,Tue Jan 20 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, you want to aim for 1. I like to get at least .86 if the camera isn't crazy.  If you don't know the camera info, make sure you set lens to unknown and free move.  A lot of people don't roto objects moving in the scene and just home nuke cleans it up, but it definitely throws off the auto track and will sometimes cancel out tracking points that are good.  I highly suggest rotoing objects before the track.  And really nitpick those tracking markers,  if there's a tree, make sure the wind isn't blowing it around a little. That will throw off all the other marker's accuracy."

vfx,2t26s2,LazyCon,5,Tue Jan 20 17:28:18 2015 UTC,I go with at least 400. If you don't have a large moving foreground object blocking most of the screen bump it up to 500+.  The reason you get better success with less is its got less bad and better tracks. It's random chance in that really. More points equals more possible good tracks. Definitely go through and delete any tracks that don't work. I spend more time rotoing and the hand deleting wiggly tracking points than anything when tracking. Especially watch straight lines like windows and poles. Nuke will always slide on those.

They might be selling up this year, but it's not an IPO afaik, it's a private sale to a private investor (whoever that might be).  Autodesk would seem to be the most likely suitor and they're publicly traded, so that's an option, but their P/E is HUGE (over 100) so I wouldn't.  Disney, EA, Apple & NVidia are all safe (albeit boring) bets.  Blizzard are up and down but should do reasonably well in the long term assuming Overwatch doesn't suck.

If you're trying to keep your money and earn a profit, don't do anything until you learn more about the basics of investing.  Some of the most profitable investors (Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, etc) look for companies with steady earnings, a barrier against competition (a ""moat"") and a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 13 or less.  A P/E of 13 and under means that the company is undervalued by the market.  IOW, for every dollar of stock you buy, you're actually getting much more than a dollar in value.  In the longer term, the stock market tends to bring prices to their actual value.  Buffet has said for many years that he is in the business of buying dollar bills for fifty cents.  Apple is a great example.  Even five years ago, they had incredible earnings, they brand was a huge moat against competition, but their P/E was low because the press hated them.  People who bought when the P/E was low made a killing.  If all this stuff seems like Greek to you, you need to wait until you have a certified financial advisor to help you through this.

vfx,2t0j4c,anamorph239,2,Tue Jan 20 23:34:55 2015 UTC,"AE has worked in linear 32-bit float for years.  The channel combiner is an old plug they leave in for legacy work. Don't use it.    If you want to remap channels in 32-bit, take a look at Shift Channels or Channel Mixer.  Both work in 32-bit.  If you want to do a YUV blur, use Channel Blur, also 32-bit.   I suspect it's 8 bpc after all!   You can detemine the bit-depth by importing the footage into After Effects, selecting the footage in the Project window, and looking at the readout at the top of the window.    Finally, regarding your key, you should become familiar with the Correction, Refinement, and Alpha Control sections at the bottom of the Primatte control panel.. These contain all the tools you need to smooth out your matte."

You should never use effects that require dumping the bit depth. I'm not sure if you can just hide them or something, but if so, you should.  Professional comp software at this point in time should really be all-32bit, like Nuke. It's sad that there's still 8bit effects out there, but I guess AE is more interested in the consumer market (who mostly deal with 8bit anyway)."

I have a scene tracked moving down the street, then I have placed some cubes floating in the sky, and now want their shadow on the floor of the original backplate. I figured the best way to this would be to simply render a plane underneath my cubes to get the shadows, then I can extract just the shadows via the exr (removing the plane from the backplate).

vfx,2sqee2,Abominati0n,1 point,Sat Jan 17 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"See that little power button in the upper right hand corner of your manipulator?  Click it.  This will toggle the manipulator from local transformation mode to world space mode.  When you move faces in local space, each face is interpreted separately, so Maya is taking the normals of the face and assigning it's own XYZ direction (with Z aligned with the normal of the face).  So if you want to move all those faces together, you click the power button, which toggles the manipulator to world space, which is probably what you're expecting.  You can see these numbers change separately in the channel box as ""Local Translate X, Y, Z"" and ""Translate X, Y, Z""  If this makes no sense, here's a way to visualize it:  Create a poly sphere, select a bunch of random faces, maybe even all the faces in one half or something, and extrude them.  Pull on the Z handle (Blue) and you'll notice that all of the faces move outwards from the center of the sphere.  That's because all of the face normals are pointing inwards (because it's a sphere).  Now hit the power button and pull on any of the XYZ handles and you'll simply be moving all of your extruded faces as one large chunk, not in their own individual directions.  Another way to help visualize this is by turning off ""Keep Faces Together"", so you can see how each individual face is moving along its own path in local mode."

The actual distribution of linux doesn't really matter much to the end user, what you want to get familiar with is the specific desktop managers and shells that the studios use. Most of the studios I've worked at use KDE (desktop/window manager) and either bash or tcsh for the shell.  From a shell you should be able to navigate directories, get file listings by size, name or creation date, know how to check disk space usage and availability and move & rename file sequences. You should also know how to find and kill processes for when software becomes non responsive (which happens more than we'd all like).  There isn't really much to know about the desktop manager, but you should be familiar with how to change window behavior and manage multiple desktops - also being able to change run level in case the window manager stops responding (the window manager runs on top of a base level of linux, so you can get at that base without having to shut down the desktop manager, which is useful if maya or houdini grabs your mouse focus and won't give it back).

Especially if it renders well and is very high quality with good point layout. Its goddamn hard too so it'll be good practice."
vfx,2snj7o,Rowehavinchop,3,Fri Jan 16 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"Looks good! My points would be:  Castle shot. I'm sure I've seen this in other reels? But it looks nice.  Ocean shot. I think you need a bit more atmospheric haze. Also it appears that the sun is behind the camera, high up but there is a dark area on the island, it looks like a shadow in the wrong place. I would also slow down the ocean animation a fair bit!  Foggy river. It looks like the grade is quite dark, or it's my monitor. The fog looks like it's lit uniformly, but the majority of the shot is either dark or in shadow. It's also moving too fast for fog.  Projection shot. Some of the lighting doesn't match on the buildings. Also it looks like there is an error on the steam to the building on the right, it moves down quickly over a few frames. Possibly too opaque.  Lastly, remove ads off your showreel!"

vfx,2smki0,anamorph239,9,Fri Jan 16 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"To be more explicit, the background was probably digital green, and their clothes were probably a bright blue or red.  The background was keyed away to comp onto a colored background, and the clothes were keyed separately to create a punch-through matte that was used to make a hole though one scene where they could stack the next scene.  Repeat.  The zooming itself is just a transformation done in the composite.  It looks linear in scale.  This is compositing and keying at its most basic.  You could do this in Apple Motion or Hit Film.  You wouldn't even need After Effects, Fusion or Nuke."
vfx,2smki0,GodPoopsToo,3,Fri Jan 16 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"I think it might be roto on the clothes and other removed objects.  Sometimes when it zooms in closely a few edge pixels are visible on the matte.  I could be wrong, though."
vfx,2smki0,anamorph239,2,Fri Jan 16 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"Gotta be honest, I didn't scrutinize it.  Other projects I've seen like this were done with keying, could be roto, could be both.  You need to get that punch-thru matte from somewhere."

Please stop being a Serkis and trust that this shit isn't a one button trick.  If you can accomplish your ""makeup"" with simple comp tricks then you should, but once you start including 3D matchmove performance transfers it becomes just as complicated (motion-wise) as a swarm of creatures crawling on someone, two face, or a cg vine attack."

vfx,2sn70t,rworsl,2,Fri Jan 16 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, well then you can classify your goal as digital makeup.  Once it comes to getting it done you have to classify your shots in a more specific manner, as the most complicated ""digital makeup"" out there is essentially making a cg digidouble with the exact motion of the plate in 3D.  Just calling something like that ""digital makeup"" is disingenuous at best."
vfx,2sn70t,FireEnt,2,Fri Jan 16 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't ever class it as digital makeup, as it covers various disciplines.  If it's for a 3d prosthetic being added to an actors face, then you could have matchmove, modelling, texturing, lighting, rendering, comp to include in that. Sure it can be done by one person, but it seems harsh to label it under one title."

vfx,2sn70t,burgernz,3,Sat Jan 17 17:02:10 2015 UTC,"Well you would track things onto actors. Or if it's a 3D element then it would be a matchmove. The actual process of putting it on is a composite. The element may be modelled, textured. It's a variety of processes. I'm unaware of a catchall to describe what you are talking about though.

Do you want a button that opens up AE and autoimports the sequence when the render finishes?  Houdini doesn't require, and has never required any knowledge of Python or scripting/programming to use. It makes doing very specific things easier, sure, but there is no reason/need for you to learn how to script. HScript, Houdini's scripting language, is very similar to many other 3d package scripting languages in structure. Houdini likes to name things randomly sometimes, but it's at least consistent."

Houdini's primary strength lies in how customizable it is, but in order to take advantage of that you really need a solid understanding of math - it's native operator language, VEX, is very similar to Renderman Shading Language rather than Python.  Python is used, but it's primarily for UI & Render related stuff (event callbacks, tile callbacks, dumping geometry etc) and fiddly crap that VEX can't handle, but it's a low slower than VEX in a geometry context."

Since you have a very limited budget and limited experience in post I would recommend extensive pre production testing and planning on your part to make sure you can pull off what you want to do.  Try out the camera tracker in blender, I have seen some good results from that and it is free.  I think it lacks an auto tracker, but placing manual tracks is better most of the time anyway (once you have experience knowing what makes a good set of tracking points anyway)."
vfx,2sl17k,ScreamingPenguin,1 point,Fri Jan 16 03:15:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for your feedback. I have about 2 weeks to do some research before the footage is shot. I will definitely try out the camera tracker in blender as you suggest. Again thank you for your help.

(also make sure to use the latest release version, its like ridiculously faster for tracking)  I will echo some of the other points already made here, try and do your own test shoots before hand so that you know what to do / what not to do...   Try to steer away from any sort of zooms (do them in post, solving a zoom is hectic) or tripod shots, as parallax will allow for a rock solid 3d solve.  If you are after an intro to 3d tracking, i highly suggest watching this series -- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtuvwW4VAp5tu2RdbRHThM6FVFfvFur1g (if its worthwhile, i suggest you purchase it / subscribe to the blender cloud), super informative about how to do tracking in blender... they use older versions of blender but the principles are the same."

vfx,2sl17k,mattjawad,0,Fri Jan 16 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"For that, you will need to use 3D camera tracking. The camera tracker in After Effects will probably be your cheapest effective option.   For filming, you'll want stationary objects with high points of contrast. The more unique, identifiable points on an object, the easier it is to track. For example, it's easier to track an unsolved Rubik's Cube than a solved one. If all the squares on one side are the same color, the tracker might get them mixed up. But if they're all different colors, the tracker will have an easier time differing them.  You'll also want multiple objects with high points of contrast. Having them at different points in Z-space (forward/back from the camera's view) will allow the tracker to more accurately understand depth."

vfx,2sj0v2,animcoop,6,Thu Jan 15 16:39:31 2015 UTC,Will you be allowing the janitors to have a say in company operations?
vfx,2sj0v2,luxdesigns,0,Thu Jan 15 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"Seeing as these discussions are ultimately about empowering workers in the VFX community, I'll put that question back to you: If you were involved in starting a democratic VFX company, what would you and your founders write into your bylaws?  Do you think the janitors should have a say? Would you and your fellow worker-owners elect to bring in an external janitorial service? Or maybe you might seek out a cooperative maintenance company to partner with if you really believed in supporting democratic enterprises.   The Worker's Self Directed Enterprise (WSDE) model for worker cooperatives suggests: ""the workers who produce the surplus generated inside the enterprise function collectively to appropriate and distribute it. They alone comprise the board of directors."" That may imply there could be non-owner employees in some variations of worker-cooperatives.   You can find a more detailed discussion about the differences between ""surplus-producing workers"" and other workers here, if you're interested.  But assuming you weren't just being snarky, what would you do lux?"
vfx,2sj0v2,luxdesigns,5,Thu Jan 15 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"1) I wouldn't run a vfx company because I'd be TERRIBLE at it  and  2) I do not actually think it is possible to run any company ""democratically"" -- not unless all members of the company have more or less the same financial stake (ie., actual equity in the company), or are all shareholders with equal shares.  Giving workers fair pay is not something that is ""democratic"" simply by itself.  Honestly, I am not an expert in this subject so my responses will probably not be very enlightening to anyone or add to the conversation.  Since you are the expert here (or so it would seem), I was asking you a question. I return the question to you to answer.  EDIT: Yes, I was being snarky, but I also wanted an answer."
vfx,2sj0v2,luxdesigns,2,Thu Jan 15 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"1) I wouldn't run a vfx company because I'd be TERRIBLE at it   Fair enough. Let me ask you this, though. You wouldn't run a VFX company, but given the option would you prefer not to have a say in it? When you see areas of opportunity, bad decisions being made, unfair pay or abusive practices: would you prefer no inherent ability to influence those things?   2) I do not actually think it is possible to run any company ""democratically"" -- not unless all members of the company have more or less the same financial stake (ie., actual equity in the company).   I'd only retort here that the assumption in the first half is definitively, unquestionably disproven by the fact that hundreds of companies around the world are run democratically, comprised of worker-owners numbering from 8 to 80,000, and many have been quite successful. But you are onto something important in the second half: quite often all members of the company have the same stake. In-fact, that's essentially the definition of a worker-cooperative.   Since you are the expert here (or so it would seem), I was asking you a question. I return the question to you to answer.   Ha, first let me say I am FAR from an expert. I am merely facilitating a conversation that I hope may better the community. I'm learning new things every day from people way more informed than myself. And your questions and criticisms here are actually quite useful to the process and the discussion.  I think I hinted at an answer to your question a bit above, but to be perfectly honest: I don't know yet. Fortunately I'm not starting one at the moment so I don't have to have an answer right away. But that's something that would need to be determined by the participating members of the company and I'd certainly want to examine what has worked for successful worker-cooperatives before delivering a definitive conclusion.  Here's some food for though. I don't personally view janitors, or what many like to refer to as ""unskilled laborers"", as some kind of inferior class of worker that shouldn't have a say in their work conditions. But it may stand to reason that different groups of workers (for example surplus-producing vs enabling) may have the ability to influence the specific conditions of the company that affect them or that their labors directly produce. So maybe janitorial staff wouldn't have the ability to vote on whether or not to greenlight a new project, but should have some say in other operational aspects.  EDIT: Just to be clear, I intended no personal insult in response to your second point. I'm simply clarifying that doubts about the ability of a company to be run democratically are easily dismissed by the hundreds of companies that have been successfully operating that way for decades."
vfx,2sj0v2,sharkweek247,2,Thu Jan 15 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"would you prefer to no inherent ability to influence those thing?   Yes, I (and probably most people) would want to have some say in how things are run.  It would be great if VFX companies unionized, but that's for another thread."

vfx,2sj0v2,splinechaser,2,Fri Jan 16 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"Hello again,  I'm still generally in disagreement with you on specifics, but in agreement on the broader strokes. We've tried this with a bunch of dyed in the wool liberal socialist worker for the workers sort of people.   There is just so much that gets glossed over.  There are individuals at companies who kiss ass, and vfx supes that drive shots into the ground. I've worked with facility owner supes who would wipe between a bluescreen plate and the comp, and tell you that you missed a fly away hair, and I've had the pleasure of working with John Knoll, who patiently said ""you might be using an erode or something on this, take a look at the settings."" The image on screen was a person against a background that was missing ears, most of their hair and looked like their head was in a vice (way too much erode) but he handled it with aplomb and it was amazing.   Jeff Okun, who famously would watch a shot 3 times (when close to crunch) and if nothing stood out, he would approve it. (also the days of film dailies)  There are myriad of war stories that have come out of R&H, and other houses, where things got noodled to death. Perfection was the enemy of the company's own success. Now that Legion exists and we bring together talent from all over the world. We ask, and we learn, what works and what doesn't. We solicit the opinion of the artists we work with and are working on building a pipeline that can scale from a 3 shot commercial to a 1000 shot feature. People are very much key to this experience. Paying people fairly and letting them voice their ideas has given us the essence of a co-operative, but not the actual legal side of it. The company is still an LLC.   I suppose Legion could be a flat structure, but that requires everyone to be on the same page. To let the accountability out there. I, the manager, would have to cede that power to the group, but I could only do that if I knew that the results generated would be in line with what Legion is. There's sort of the run to it all, and maybe that is just a problem with Legion. It's one thing. It is a visual effects company that is entirely bootstrapped, built from the ground up to be a remote facility, using only the best talent to offer an affordable, high value product. We don't chase incentives and we don't underbid intentionally. (dynamics are expensive.) However, as mentioned and quoted in this week's post, artist generally suck at running a business. This flat structure would have to be granular. Super granular. Compers agree to work like this. Lighters agree to work like this. Programmers agree to work like this. There could be teams, like we have on our TV show where two artist's share most of the workload. As a business though the flat structure wouldn't work to the out facing world. At least in my opinion.   Unionizing would be great. We talked with Kaplan a little at iatse, but it's just a matter of having a world wide company. You can't unionize everyone. Each locale has to have their own representation, and in our case, most of our workers in the US are 1099 because they work at home on their own equipment and on their own schedule. Only security specific shows, would we bring people into the studio to work.   There's certainly more to talk about, I would like to see where you end up on this issue, because all of the last two years of experience has proven that a lot of these ideas don't really work. We know this because we set out, I set out, to create this exact thing. It's the people though. Even when they have a stake in the company on every level, they don't really want to do the running of it. It's just too hard and takes them away from what they love, which is making art. Making something awesome.   That's why you can't change this industry. You can't get past the point where people want to make some kind of a living making cool shit, and even if they hate the house they work for or their idiot bosses, at the end of the day, they rather bitch and moan rather than join together and make something better.   Hell, if Legion could get the work to support 100 artists... 100 of the best artists, and they all got to work together to make something so much better than anything done before? How cool would that be?"
vfx,2sj0v2,D4wn0ff473,1 point,Thu Jan 15 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"Hey again!  Thanks for reading and participating in the discussion. I've peripherally followed you guys since your inception and even if we may not see eye-to-eye on some things, I respect what you guys are trying to do and I truly think sharing your experience on the subject is valuable to this discussion.    I suppose Legion could be a flat structure, but that requires everyone to be on the same page.   Flat structure's, while I am attracted to them intellectually, are something that I have yet to be convinced could work well in our specific industry, though I am still keeping an open mind.   My point in explaining the difference between a flat organization and a worker-coop was largely because I think when most people (at least the ones I've talked to) hear ""worker-coop"" they tend to confuse it with a completely or mostly flat organization with no structure, where everyone has a say in everything down to day-to-day operational matters.   Because of the way things work in our industry, and the dangers of the committee effect, I personally feel a VFX based cooperative would work best without trying to eliminate the types of management rolls we know are pretty necessary for production.    As a business though the flat structure wouldn't work to the out facing world.   You've hit on something here that gets into my own personal ambitions. While, again, at this point I don't think I'd even try the flat structure: I don't think I'd chose to participate in a coperative VFX company that relied primarily on the current client/vendor business model. Personally I gravitate toward more... risky... endeavors and newer markets, less charted. But that's sort of an aside and maybe I'll talk about that at a later date.    There's certainly more to talk about, I would like to see where you end up on this issue, because all of the last two years of experience has proven that a lot of these ideas don't really work.   You know, if when we get to the more meaty, less foundational/philosophical posts (which are coming eventually), if you still strongly feel the ideas we're promoting on the blog can't really work with this industry, I may even ask if you would be interested in doing a counter-point guest post on why we shouldn't pursue it or why it doesn't work (or at least, like we said, some kind of interview about your experiences if you didn't want to write a post).   We know this because we set out, I set out, to create this exact thing.    I'd love to hear more about this at some point. Specifically, things like:   When you started the company what model of cooperative were you trying to build?  How were artists invited to participate?  How did you guys plan to deal with voting as you expanded?  Were you imagining something closer to a flat-organization like Valve with the addition of worker-owners, or were you imagining a cooperative that had similar roles to what we see now (in regular VFX facilities)?  Was member participation explicit in the interview process and expected from members but they just abstained from most participation?    I have lots of questions.   EDIT: Added bullet points for clarity."
vfx,2sj0v2,D4wn0ff473,4,Thu Jan 15 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"VFX is a contract business for both the company and the workers, do you give the new hires the same democratic control on day one of hiring them when there could be a vote on day two? Is everyone staff with no contract end date? Does this studio have perpetual work that is farmed from a parent source? Do the artists vote on internal structure and server backbones, and the IT people vote on the artist decisions such as rigging changes and lighting rigs? Are the artists going to decide if a janitor gets a new mop bucket?   Artists voting on whether or not Aspera is a good cost effective choice for client uploads is a waste of time, money, and resources. The same with IT voting for something similar like rigging tools or compositing tools. The structure of most vfx companies is not the problem, the problems are the production companies being inflexible and the subsidies offered by both countries and states. The bidding systems that are used and approved by the production companies offer nothing to the vfx companies. Most small companies operate on margin because they went over with fixed bidding by trying to out bid china. If they are a larger company they try to make their budget vanish because they have a cost plus model that still leaves them operating on margin; Because they have agreements to give back any possible profit.   This is not the fault of the company or leadership. They are just trying to land work to stay in business. Under bidding along with other things are used to land work because you can't really compete with the 50 hour guarantee and subsidies offered in Vancouver. Or the low wages of places like china. The driving force in this industry is make it cheaper, faster, and better. Which is a situation that nothing will solve except lowering costs and effectively doing what the clothing industry did by moving labor to developing countries.  People need to realize that the vfx companies are not their enemies; The environment that is perpetuated to the public of the hollywood ideal, and the production studios attempting to silence people who talk of the truth of this false ideal are the problem. No amount of democratic process in a vfx company will change this. The change needs to happen in the production studios and in the movie industry as a whole. Companies like valve are lucky in that they are both their own producer and distributor which gives them a game changing ability to work differently. A vfx company will not have this ability unless it is a production and distribution company where they control the whole process from conception to end."
