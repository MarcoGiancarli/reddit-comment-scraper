PanPorn,3dzprp,myfirstnamewas,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"Oooh, you have the same perk?  Perk buddies :D  I only use primer half the time really.  What I've done lately is apply skimp all over the lid, then a chocolate brown eye crayon in the outer v, then bust on top of the eye crayon, then guilt in the inner corner and oil slick applied wet as eyeliner on the outer 2/3.  I also apply skimp on my lower eyelid.  I really consider guilt as just light glitter since the pink/purple colour doesn't often show up, so just a generic inner corner highlight.  I think I applied guilt once over a deep blue eye crayon too and that showed up pretty nicely, but it's certainly not an everyday look!"

PanPorn,3de8qd,MrsTroy,9,Wed Jul 15 16:16:06 2015 UTC,Scrape all of the powder out and crush it up so it is all uniform and as fine of a powder as possible. Then mix the powder with rubbing alcohol until it forms a thick paste. Then press the paste into the pan and smooth it out. Leave it open for a day or two to dry out and it will be as good as new!

I've gone back to my tried and true IsaDora Velvet Touch powder.  E.L.F Eyebrow Kit: I adore this. I used to be sad about my eyebrows, because even though I'm otherwise pretty good at make-up I could never make my eyebrows how I wanted them. Then this came along, and no more bad eyebrows! I have very thick eyebrows naturally, but I use this for shaping and color. My eyebrows are very ashy, but my hair is pretty warm. This product (in the color Light) is also really warm, so it ends up being a perfect match for my hair. The brush that comes with it is way too small to use comfortably, so I use a cheap angled liner brush I had for the gel and just a small eyeshadow brush for the powder."

PanPorn,3cefa7,dreamstorming,3,Tue Jul 7 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"I really like it! I probably should have just bought a pot of Nyx's green concealer, since I really only use the one shade, but now I have the other ones in the palette too on the off chance that I need them.   The green is so wonderful though! I have acne scaring on my chin and just general redness in some areas on my face, and this helps both of those things. I put on primer, then I put on the green concealer, then I pat that out with a beauty blender, then foundation, then concealer that matches my skin over the scars. I use the second concealer because the green concealer takes the redness out of my scars, but it doesn't conceal them completely. The second concealer use is a Nyx concealer pot. I find that the colors in the palette and the pot of foundation blend out beautifully without having to use too much and last all day."
PanPorn,3cefa7,dreamstorming,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough explanation. I think I'll have to give this a chance then, I've been looking for color correcting concealers, so I'm hoping it gives me just as great results as it seems you've been having :)"

PanPorn,38gc4d,-cutestofborg-,2,Thu Jun 4 01:50:12 2015 UTC,Yesss! These are the only lip balms I manage not to lose.
PanPorn,38gc4d,SephiSama,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:26:05 2015 UTC,"love this stuff! i have the rosy lips one, but the smell isn't my favorite (i'll admit it was the pink that drew me in). i'm determined to finish it, but i'm gonna check this one out afterwards."
PanPorn,38d6uv,tleavesdogears,5,Wed Jun 3 13:31:20 2015 UTC,"From the top:   Stila's Kitten highlighter, with sadly far less pigmentation than the eye shadow.  Mary Lou-Manizer and one if the Sally Hansen Carmindy eye shadows that was discontinued.  And finally my Horoscope compact from Estee Lauder with their signature pressed powder."
PanPorn,38d6uv,TheDarklingThrush,2,Wed Jun 3 13:33:35 2015 UTC,How do you like the Stila highlighter?  I've had my eye on it for a while.
PanPorn,38d6uv,NY1227,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:08:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not super impressed, tbh. It has way less pigmentation than the Kitten eye shadow and I feel like the vanilla shade is too pink and the gold shade is a bit too dark for my skin. It might look lovely on someone else, but I definitely won't re-purchase. Mary Lou-Manizer is my HG anyway."
PanPorn,38blyr,FreeRangeGirl,9,Wed Jun 3 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"... when you hit pan on something after 6 months and quickly go buy a replacement.   Revlon Color-burst Balm Stain in Adore. MLBB shade for me, moisturizing, staining and long-lasting. Highly recommend."

PanPorn,383b13,LisaGeezy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot. It's very moisturizing, helps to keep away creasing, and easy to blend. I don't use it everyday but obviously I use it enough lol"

PanPorn,383b13,Kaziechan,2,Mon Jun 8 20:02:01 2015 UTC,I think it might be a touch too yellow for me too but I set it with my powder foundation more often than not and it comes out a really nice match.

PanPorn,36yhqr,Jessijames,1 point,Sat May 23 04:41:15 2015 UTC,What's the powder all the way to the right?
PanPorn,36yhqr,Whimsyprincess,2,Sat May 23 14:31:06 2015 UTC,It's the Too Faced Cocoa powder Foundation - It didn't really work for me as a powder foundation but it's just perfect to give a lower coverage liquid the little bit more! :)

PanPorn,33cvrp,abbeyrogue,3,Tue Apr 21 15:53:21 2015 UTC,Is it bad that doe foot concealers bother me? I just assume it gets all gunky near the end - how did this last for you?  Just super curious because I'm limited to pots and 2 brushes at a time when I'm covering acne so I don't dip acne brush into concealer pot.
PanPorn,33cvrp,l3x1uth0r,5,Tue Apr 21 16:35:57 2015 UTC,I didn't have a problem with it gunking up. I've that this concealer for... I wanna say like 9 months? Doe foot applicators certainly aren't the most hygienic. You can get disposable doe foot applicators. I kinda like it because I find it easier to apply. I'll probably pick up a NARS one once I burn through my current concealer stash.

I have combination skin and I find it's great in that it doesn't cling to dry patches, but it also doesn't melt off the oily parts of my skin."
PanPorn,336axv,dinosaursandunicorns,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:11:41 2015 UTC,Awesome! I always switch to powder during summer months and have been dying to try a new formula! Thanks!
PanPorn,336axv,dinosaursandunicorns,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:58:02 2015 UTC,So do you use a liquid foundation and set with this powder or do you apply this powder of those areas after your foundation has worn away? I'm asking because I'm looking for a setting powder that will help with some of my oiliness XD
PanPorn,336axv,Amplitude,3,Mon Apr 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"I use this for touch ups only! I actually find it too pigmented to use as a setting powder on top of foundation.

PanPorn,32ukwu,allie0423,3,Thu Apr 16 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"It looks like your blush might have developed a hard layer over the top due to the powder mixing with the oils from your brush. Try scraping the top layer off with a spoolie or brow brush, you might get better pigmentation that way."

The colors are not too highly pigmented so I can blend away mistakes pretty easily. The pigmentation of the blackest ones is a little pathetic TBH, but overall the colors are functional and there's a decent range. You can get a feel for which kinds of neutrals you use more often, and buy a higher quality palette based on that experience. Plus I like having cheap travel palettes so I'm not devastated by loss/damage/theft."

I'm now also trying to multi-task it by setting my undereye concealer with it (which lightens the corrector a bit, which is now a taaaad too dark for me.). (sorry the corrector looks so gross.

PanPorn,313dum,veraamber,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"I've had a lot of success doing it wet. You need to get very little up that way. Just use a little misting bottle (I use an empty Nyx setting spray bottle) and give the little sponge thing in the compact a couple sprays. The sponge has an apply-wet side and a dry side. The ""wet"" side is the one that's more like a foam wedge, although it doesn't really matter that much. You need to get a lot less on that way. I've found when I use a brush I tend to have a lot of wasted product that ends up in the air or on my shirt."

PanPorn,30n2eg,deathbyblackhole,2,Sat Mar 28 22:15:07 2015 UTC,It's one of my favorites and I use it all the time! I bought a single of fresco several months ago in anticipation of the inevitable. I also bought the nordstrom exclusive artist palette that came out the following year and haven't used it yet.

I Used to swear by that serum and have also used caudalie dark spots one but I was sick of spending that much much money on serums. I did a lot of research I'm talking days after days of reading up on skin care, contacting dermatologists through my dad ( he's a surgeon) and looking up ingredients in expensive serums. I started using rose hip oil as a serum around September and oh my god it's has changed my life! My dry flakes that even the advanced night repair could fix have disappeared! Even skintone, smooth as a baby's bum and it has even helped with dark circles!! It's also good for wrinkle reduction!

PanPorn,30dq1i,mesuhwah,3,Sun Mar 29 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"My skin is dry as well!!! I use Kosmea brand rose hip oil. Whole foods usually carries a huge selection and if you are in Canada try rexall or nutrition house. If you end up trying it out here's what I do to make sure my skin doesn't get clogged and the oil gets absorbed properly: wash your face and then use a toner, while your face is still damp from the toner, pat 2-3 drops of oil in and follow up with your regular moisturizer. Try to exfoliate twice a week or atleast once a week. I use nip + fabs glycolic acid scrub which is only $9 a tube at shoppers drug mart. It has 3% glycolic acid which is just as much as the Peter Thomas Roth facewash does. This was the first winter of my life when my face wasn't a flakey mess!"

PanPorn,30bixm,jamballdonut,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:39:36 2015 UTC,"Ooh I actually did a review on the etude house Magic any cushion before! But generally I found it to be more of a primer or colour correcting product than a foundation or bb cream type product? It was a sheer tinted colour base, so it has some colour correcting properties, but doesn't offer much in the way of coverage, so it won't cover the way most typical bb cushions might. The green one you see here is to cancel out redness in the skin, but there is a pink shade and a peach shade and most recently, a lavender shade too."

I've using this on and off for the past 3 years but really been using this daily for the last year. I reckon it has another year and half to two years left... Even with daily use!!! How does anyone finish the regular sizes?!  Wet n' Wild Coverall powder in light-  Just a powder to keep stuff together. I moisturize a lot so sometimes I need a good amount to keep the shine away.

PanPorn,2zam5s,curlywurlies,2,Tue Mar 17 22:31:15 2015 UTC,Tarte Blush palette from the 2013 holiday collection!  :)
PanPorn,2zam5s,PrincessAcala,2,Wed Mar 18 03:40:06 2015 UTC,I womder which one is your favourite... lol : )
PanPorn,2z4v1c,ShitlordSithlord,9,Sun Mar 15 16:29:29 2015 UTC,I love seeing well-used high end makeup! :D
PanPorn,2ypl58,emilynotsograceful,6,Wed Mar 11 19:25:09 2015 UTC,They still sell those?
PanPorn,2ypl58,Zookeepered,2,Wed Mar 11 20:27:22 2015 UTC,Yeah! I got mine at Wal-mart
PanPorn,2ypl58,ahmay,4,Wed Mar 11 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"This might sound obvious to others, but HOW did you use it?? I have this type of blush in Plum Wine and it's beautiful--I just don't know how to work with the texture. I've tried using my fingers but I somehow just get a heavier streak from where I first start on my face."
PanPorn,2ypl58,Producewarrior,4,Thu Mar 12 17:23:18 2015 UTC,I use the small stipple brush from elf and I just dab the brush into the blush(just a little cuz it's very pigmented!) And then swipe on the cheeks and blend it out. It blends incredibly easily when using a brush. Hope this helps!:)
PanPorn,2ypl58,PrincessMiaka,2,Thu Mar 12 18:04:13 2015 UTC,Not obvious.
PanPorn,2ypl58,curlywurlies,1 point,Sat Mar 14 07:10:58 2015 UTC,"I have something with a similar texture. I apply it to my cheeks with my fingers 'cause I'm lazy and then blend it out with a clean brush. Probably not the most correct way of using it, but it's never come out looking weird."
PanPorn,2ypl58,canadianchica,3,Wed Mar 18 03:38:37 2015 UTC,From the picture the two look like their different colors. Did you purchase a different shade? Is it just the lighting? Or is this blush one of those products that the very top layer is different from what lies below? Thanks!
PanPorn,2ynh45,inourstars,12,Wed Mar 11 06:05:20 2015 UTC,can you still call it panning if the item came in a glass jar?
PanPorn,2ynh45,freudiansleep,2,Wed Mar 11 07:18:59 2015 UTC,of course! ;-)
PanPorn,2ynh45,Producewarrior,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:46:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely! This is fabulous!
PanPorn,2ynh45,iopsyched,9,Sat Mar 14 07:11:32 2015 UTC,Beautiful! I get half way through mine before they dry up and become unusable. Any tips to keep it from drying out? I store it upside down but no luck :/
PanPorn,2ynh45,Producewarrior,8,Wed Mar 11 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure, maybe i just got lucky? i didn't do anything special with it, just closed the lid and that was that. i wanted to attribute it not drying to living in a humid climate, but my smashbox gel liner definitely got super dry and flaky toward the end, and i'm already having issues with my dipbrow drying up and flaking and i've only had it for 2 months and barely put a dent in it.   i've read on mua that you could try stirring up the liner or adding a tiny bit of coconut oil to it to make it less dry. i've never had to do either so i'm not sure if it would work."
PanPorn,2ynh45,kareem_brulee,5,Wed Mar 11 17:49:29 2015 UTC,Yes! My dipbrow started drying out after about a month. :(  I put a small amount of coconut oil on my brush and smeared it around the top. Good as new.
PanPorn,2ynh45,dinosaursandunicorns,3,Sat Mar 14 07:13:38 2015 UTC,This is so satisfying
PanPorn,2ynh45,madups,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:56:32 2015 UTC,That thing is beautiful. I have one gel liner pot and this is now my goal for it!
PanPorn,2ykevs,Kat_Stu,21,Tue Mar 10 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"Since I hit pan on these powders so frequently I save them up until I have about 4, then repress them! I can't tell you how many times I've repressed this powder, all of the product in the edges allows me to get much more use!  *L'oreal true match super blendable  powder in soft ivory"
PanPorn,2ykevs,rawbery79,8,Tue Mar 10 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"Ha, I was going to ask about the three pans and the one full!"
PanPorn,2ykevs,secretcrazy,2,Wed Mar 11 19:46:55 2015 UTC,I do the same thing with the Sephora foundation powder I use.
PanPorn,2ykevs,optogirl,2,Tue Mar 17 21:31:39 2015 UTC,how long does one last?
PanPorn,2ykevs,optogirl,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:46:01 2015 UTC,"I get through them rather quickly, anywhere from 3-4 months I'm guessing. Using it all over my face and neck every day makes it disappear fast, even though there's a lot of product."
PanPorn,2ykevs,Zookeepered,2,Wed Mar 18 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"I use my revlon nearly naked 2x a day, for about 1 month, and it barely has a dip in it!!"
PanPorn,2ykevs,QuietLiving,4,Thu Mar 19 03:54:30 2015 UTC,"This is super impressive! Do you use it like a powder foundation, or setting powder?"

PanPorn,2yhtz2,pharmacokittens,3,Mon Mar 9 22:53:13 2015 UTC,I'm working on one of those now... The stupid thing won't die. It is showing a fair amount of pan but its like it regenerates!
PanPorn,2yhtz2,miranym,2,Tue Mar 10 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know! I repressed mine around November and I have a little progress pic of February to now on my insta, but it took a very long time to go trough it."
PanPorn,2yhtz2,XSTall,2,Tue Mar 10 18:31:39 2015 UTC,Good job! How long did it take? I'm working on hitting pan on this now and it's taking forever...
PanPorn,2yhtz2,Coolbeanery,6,Tue Mar 10 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"Oof, a while. I think I first bought this around.... Maybe july-aug-sept range of 2014. I was just starting to get into makeup and figured it was cheap and the pigmentation might be kind of on the sheer side, so i could be heavy handed with it and it won't make me look like a clown. I ended up repressing it in the center so my brush can reach it around oct-nov maybe. I guess it's important to note its the only blush I was using."
