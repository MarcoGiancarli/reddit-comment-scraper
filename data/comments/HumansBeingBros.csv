After being trained and made to follow rules all their life it's nice to know that they're spoiled when their time is coming to an end. Hopefully they were spoiled throughout their lives, this would just be the icing on the cake.  What made you unable to continue volunteering, if I may ask?"
HumansBeingBros,3dmjjo,On-a-tims-run,4,Sat Jul 18 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you! What a genuinely sweet thing to say, that means a lot to me ;)  I had to stop providing hospice care for health reasons. I have degenerative disease in my back and hip, for which I take daily doses of morphine. I also have ""brittle"" diabetes, which has recently stopped responding to a medication that's worked fine up until now (this has happened twice, yeesh).  It didn't surprise me to hear Sher in the video say she'd only left the house four times in the past year. Sometimes end of life care requires extreme measures on the part of the caretaker. Days and weeks of interrupted sleep, you learn to sleep for minutes at a time. Dog not sleeping well? Maybe I'll just curl up on the floor with him. Cat wants to sleep in the closet? I'll just stretch out in there so she can cuddle up against me. Medication every three hours... You get the picture.  Sometimes it's impossible to maintain your own food and medication schedule. If a pet has a medical crisis you tend to drop everything to deal with it. Multiply that by a house full of animals and it can continue for weeks. As I got older that started to take a tremendous toll on my body, and my own overall health.  Several years ago we had a period where we lost one animal after another, in quick succession. It was hard to recover from one loss, since fate required moving on to the next decline/euthanasia. We finally lost our last little guy (a cat named Alex who was only two) unexpectedly and it was rough.  My vet sat me down and gave me some tough love. She asked how I was doing, I said I was fine, just tired. She called me out on my lie. You don't look fine, she said. You look sick and depressed. You need to take a break. You need to have some time with a healthy animal. You deserve the experience of having a healthy animal. And you need to take care of yourself for a while.  It was good advice and I took it. I started antidepressants and proper pain meds. And six months later I adopted my first ""healthy"" cat in over twenty years. (As it turns out, she wasn't healthy. But that's another story). My husband and I adopted a healthy griffon puppy. I got to have the experience of training her as an assistance animal (my husband - we're divorced now - is disabled).  As luck would have it, I had my own medical scare at about that time. Spent a month in the hospital for an ovarian tumor. Ended up spending a month in a hotel (room service, A/C) while my mother and husband took turns caring for me. We moved the cat into the hotel for moral support but I wasn't well enough to have the dog. That took an extra eight weeks of healing.  This is turning into a wall of text, I'm sorry. I just have to mention that our new-ish vet at the time (we had moved out to the country by this time) was a lifesaver. She boarded my animals with no money exchanged while I was in the hospital. I tried to give them a deposit, they wouldn't take it.   They continued working with my dog so she wouldn't forget her training. They kept my long-haired cat perfectly groomed. And when I was finally well enough to go get my dog and ask for a bill there were pages and pages of charges cancelled out. God works in mysterious and amazing ways lol.  So that's probably more about me than you wanted to know. I'm currently living in a happy little apartment with my mother and a tortoiseshell cat named Vivi. My ex-husband got custody of our dog (he really did need her more) but we're good friends and I still see her as often as I can. I'm older, probably no wiser, and I walk with a cane now ;)  Vivi the cat:  http://imgur.com/CCjNbqG  Hunter the dog (with the ex):  http://imgur.com/9ShbKXh  🐾❤️🐾❤️🐾❤️🐾❤️🐾"

He had a rotating pack of about 4-5 dogs he spoiled outrageously. They had their own little room in the garage with an AC and a heater. They had a massive 38 acre yard to run around in. He took them out almost every day during the summertime when he got home from work for a walk in the woods (couldn't do it during the winter cause it was dark when he got home).  He always talked about when he retired he wanted to set up a dog rescue thing on his property, keep a dozen or so old dogs who just needed a happy home to spend their last days in. After he retired he started preparing to be able to do that - taking in one dog while he was getting the fencing repaired and another larger area for an AC/heater.  Unfortunately he passed away before he could realize that dream. His last wish was that we take care of his dogs. I quit my job to do that (had to move).

HumansBeingBros,3d3goi,marrymary,6,Mon Jul 13 08:15:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe they thought there are already people helping. I'm not an expert, but i think dolphins breathe air like we do. So they are not in a real danger as long as they don't dry out. And maybe some people are afraid of getting bitten by a dolphin. Animals in panic can do unexpected things. I for example would have helped in this case. But if there would be a stingray or a barracuda... I wouldn't. I'm sure there would be a safe way to help, but i don't know it and don't want to risk my own health, but try to find someone who can."
HumansBeingBros,3d3goi,swizzero,2,Mon Jul 13 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realize that dolphins breathe air and that there were already some people helping.

HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,JustVern,156,Sat Jul 11 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the full video link, which is what should have been posted in the first place.  The full video comes with full info, like where this happened, what organization (not random individuals) did the rescue, what happened to the puppies, and how to get in touch if you want to give the mama a home or donate money to this good work. All that got lost when the OP chose to snag this clip rather than go look for the whole thing.  The OP, of course, is /u/GallowBoob, who does this all the time. I called him on it last week and he immediately deleted the post in question rather than let the criticism stand.  I used to just ignore the complaints about his karma-whoring, but this consequence of keeping info about rescue orgs from people who could support them has put me on the warpath about sourcing. It's just not that hard, and it really matters."
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,AngelaMotorman,18,Sat Jul 11 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hijack, but this rescue was performed by the Los Angeles based organization Hope For Paws. Their YouTube channel has around 200 rescue videos like this  one, and they are incredibly deserving of your donations.   The organization's founder, Eldad, has done so much work to get strays off the streets and into homes. His organization also sponsors groups like Fix Long Beach who provide access to free spay/neutering to LA's low-income families, in addiction to free shots and microchips.   edit: spelling"

HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,Strixxi,14,Sat Jul 11 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yah but he could always post the video too. Lots of OPs do that, post the easy access thing as a main post but comment with the source.

HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,AngelaMotorman,20,Sat Jul 11 20:34:02 2015 UTC,weird vendetta    That's not fair. I explained clearly that it's about cutting people off from info about the group that did the rescue work and are actively seeking donations at the YouTube sitefor the full video.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,bohrmupfel,7,Sat Jul 11 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"Well I haven't seen every post of Gallow but I have seen some of them and he sometimes does provide sources if he has them so it's not like he is never posting it.

HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,Karma_collection_bin,21,Sun Jul 12 07:15:02 2015 UTC,Can people who are rescuing dogs please stop with overhead petting when you are meeting the dog? Especially when they act somewhat fearful/cower. You can scratch them under the jaw and front chest and its less scary for them and you are much less likely to get bit from the dog. All the rescue videos I have seen to date have included initial overhead petting. Also try holding out your hand for the dog to smell first.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,thehighplainsdrifter,68,Sun Jul 12 07:25:54 2015 UTC,"this guy rescues a ton of dogs, he probably knows how to do it better than you do."
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,coke21,8,Sat Jul 11 23:19:30 2015 UTC,Yep. He's rescued the scariest most aggressive dogs to the sweetest. And this dog was very sweet and hardly scared at all.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,PROmotionlkittenbskt,-4,Sun Jul 12 03:08:58 2015 UTC,The dog was flicking her tongue and looking away. That is a clear sign of fear in dogs.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,coke21,2,Sun Jul 12 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Of course the bloody dog is nervous and scared, it's homeless and got puppies.  But I get where you're coming from. Truly scared-aggressive dogs are growling / running away / not walking up to you / very very still.   So I suppose it's a big risk patting it, but it has a big reward. It's a dog who probably once had an owner and with that pat it's remembering how nice love and human comfort can be.  But yeah, that dog didn't seem OVERLY scared / aggressive. Watch some of the other videos where the dog is so scared and biting him they have use to a stick with a cloth on it to pat it."
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,PROmotionlkittenbskt,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:45:54 2015 UTC,Dogs often actually offer us more subtle signs than the obvious growling and avoidance. Most people just don't know what to look for.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,PROmotionlkittenbskt,-4,Sat Jul 11 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"I've been working with dogs for 3 years and Karma_collection_bin is 100% right. The dog was showing signs of fear by licking her lips, holding her head down, and looking away."
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,KaBar42,16,Sun Jul 12 04:15:40 2015 UTC,Eldad knows what he's doing. He's been doing this for years. I think he and the dog will be fine.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,hungryhungryME,22,Sun Jul 12 04:49:05 2015 UTC,"It seemed to work out OK, but I'll be sure to pass along the armchair-dog-rescue tip gleaned from a gif on reddit.

HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,protest87,10,Sun Jul 12 06:17:23 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same exact thing. Also it's best to not stand directly over them but off to the side or an angle.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,Karma_collection_bin,6,Sun Jul 12 13:19:02 2015 UTC,You've got it. Crouching and to the side and just letting them approach and sniff you is good.
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,filthymcbastard,2,Sun Jul 12 04:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying. But I'm pretty sure none of those ""first encounter"" videos are really the first time he interacted with them. If he's truly an expert, anyone with him is there for backup, and would probably get yelled at if they pulled out their cell phone."

HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,Hepcat10,2,Sat Jul 11 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"Also, if you're holding out your hand for a dog to sniff, it's a good idea to hold out your fist to a strange dog rather than your palm. If the dog is violent, you are less likely to lose a finger this way."
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,hiloljkbye,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:55:38 2015 UTC,I always do this when I first meet a dog? Should I not do this? I was thinking scratching under the chin/chest was more scary for them

Aside from proximity to the spine, the lower-back of the head is where certain autonomic functions like breathing are processed. Lots of predators kill by biting there."
HumansBeingBros,3cxekg,Karma_collection_bin,10,Sun Jul 12 06:40:37 2015 UTC,You've got it backwards. Above them or overhead is a dominance display sort of thing. It's intimidating for them if you are new to them or they don't trust you.   For people they know and trust it's totally fine. It's also fine for well socialized dogs as they know to expect It and don't suspect you of anything.

Also, even though it looks like there's a large space between the ground and where you'd hit your head, that isn't the case.   If you've not crawled around under a house, you really should. It's freaking horrible! Spiders and slugs and snails everywhere. The pointy end of nails sticking down, like someone WANTED you to have a puncture wound to your skull. And if you're really lucky and animals have been able to get under there, shit and piss and dead animals everywhere.

I gave him some food and some time and he appreciated it. He even gave me some food that he fished out of the dumpster and I accepted it with gratitude.  When I was younger I would judge people like this because it was everywhere in the east coast city that I lived. Now I try to look at them as human beings with their own story. Who's to say that anyone couldn't end up like this...you never know. Neale Donald Walsh was homeless before he became a best selling author. You just never know, life is funny that way.

So that's what I'd like to know.  How did he end up like this in the United States of America?  Was it drugs?  Was he THAT kid in class who was too anti-authority to sit down and be taught?

Most mental illness is episodic, so in the video he may be fine, though may have an episode later.  Alternatively, it could be drugs like you said, because I can't think of anything else that would cause a person to completely let their life slip. Maybe he ended up homeless for a week due to circumstance and then the mental illness part came in, exacerbating it."

HumansBeingBros,3co2cg,deweymm,8,Fri Jul 10 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"You're describing something very deep in American belief and few people will accept as an aspect of American exceptionalism. When the French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville visited America in 1835 he remarked “In America, I never met a citizen too poor to cast a glance of hope and envy toward the pleasures of the rich.” He made this remark in contrast to old Europe where social mobility was unknown. Aspiration was pointless in a society where if you were born a peasant, you stayed a peasant. This is the belief that made America great and powerful but how true this is still is really the interesting systemic question you are trying to get at, especially considering that social mobility in old Europe passed that of the US a decade ago."

Is upward mobility still possible in today's America.      If you don't think so, then by all means respect this man's humanity but then the handout in the cup becomes a social program and we just give him enough to survive the day each day. If you do, then how can I help HIM get the desired skills that allow one to move up?  I guess that's why conservatives are considered stone hearted.  They tend to believe and look toward the big picture.   sigh...but in the real world these things get complicated by race, whose taxes will pay for it etc.  But it was fun to go back to sociology class with a Reddit stranger for five minutes.

HumansBeingBros,3co2cg,tonystark31,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:42:49 2015 UTC,"Social mobility is still definitely possible in America for the individual.  It's often easy to point to examples of rags to riches through grit, brains and luck, but these stories are becoming less statistically relevant to the discussion.   And really we have to recognize that not everyone is a Elon Musk. That's the cruel twist to a seemingly meritocratic American survival of the fittest system. If we lived in aristocratic Europe as a peasant is mentally easy to accept why we are not like our betters, but in America, lack of wealth and attainment is seen as a personal failure. If XYZ can make it to be a success despite being born at the bottom of the heap why can't you? And often the answers are that factors to success are out of the individual's control.   Example. What if Bill Gates wasn't born to an IBM executive as a mom? What if he didn't live down the street from one of the first supercomputers in the world? Or even what if Bill Gates was born 20 years earlier? He'd have gotten a day job and might have never done the things he did.  Just saying we sometimes have very little say in what makes us Bill Gates or this man in the video. I feel It's one of those ""there but for the grace of God go I"" situations and that compassion for that man, is compassion for ourselves."

Homeless (and low income) people have access to free phones due to an act I believe Reagan passed but people don't know what services are available to them.   Internet might be difficult because I know libraries that kick homeless out due to their smell and such (being unable to shower) so unless he can find a decent library to visit everyday and use the computer to search for jobs and such, he's limited in another crucial way.   Clothing can be obtained from other areas but it can be difficult to find nice clothing such as slacks, a tie, and a nice shirt and jacket (or a nice sweater), and then where would he put them to keep them clean? Where would he wash them if he can't even afford food or home every night? Shelters often don't allow men in, or they limited to a certain amount and keep people who aren't with their wives or children out, and even then they still kick out fathers because of the issues of rape and sexual assault in homeless women and children.  Stopping homelessness is an incredibly difficult thing currently. We don't have enough shelters, don't have enough opportunities for them (such as work programs to get them experience or schooling programs if they never finished high school), college is out of the question as way too many entry level jobs now require years of experience and at least a bachelors degree which rules out many opportunities for them, and minimum wage is fucking ridiculously low and unlivable on often. In addition, shelters, as far as I'm aware, will often not take those who actually work, if they even have room or take men, which could screw them out of housing and potentially other opportunities that are just for the unemployed and thus could throw him back to square one."
HumansBeingBros,3co2cg,Averiella,9,Mon Jul 20 06:44:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem and probably his biggest challenge is that there are people out there that make good money pan handling so the fake it. For every video like this there is the lady who was begging on 5th ave when some reporter followed her to her car, she changed and drove home. For every homeless person I've seen that seemed like they legitimately needed food and clothing there are the ones I have seen deny hot food offered to them cuz they just wanted money."

Then I watched him accept some food from a lady from the Arby's, a few minutes later he walked over and put it in the trash can. Poor humans like this ruin it for the real down on their luck human beings like the guy in the video."

It's a fine line and if you get burned once, you don't do it again.  If you want to give food to someone, just make sure it's pre-packaged.

We are all the same here and to deny someone help is to say that you yourself will never need help.  I went around NYC for a while giving out protein bars(CLIF) because I hate the idea of someone being hungry. I wish I could do more and I plan to in the future."
HumansBeingBros,3co2cg,ParadoxParade,2,Thu Jul 9 22:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, no one is saying he's not human or shouldn't be treated as such.  Merely pointing out that it will cost money/training in a job skill/social workers to fix this.  You handing out a CLIF bar on day one is good.  By day 30 you'd have to start thinking, ""how can I get this guy to feed himself?""  Because it costs YOU money to keep feeding him.  That's why documentaries like this should always show the origin story of this individual so that we know how to avoid generating more of him-without disregarding his own humanity, of course.  Because eventually his CLIF bar supply will start hampering your ability to feed yourself.  When we watch commercials with abandoned pets, they say at the end: ""Please spay and neuter your pets"".  That's why I feel it's a bit intellectually lazy for any film-maker to highlight an issue and not offer at least an IDEA for a sustainable solution.  Using emotion as the main point or crux of any video like this is just artistic laziness."

He finished one particularly long, exhausting day with tons of physical work and, from what I understand, a pretty uncomfortable makeup process. As his car left the location, he saw that a couple hundred girls and their mothers had gathered around the entrance hoping to spot him.   Rather than go catch a few hours sleep before his VERY early call time the next morning, he had his driver turn back around. He set up a warm trailer, and spent an extra two hours signing EVERY autograph, kissing EVERY cheek, apologizing sincerely for the wait and the cold. He did not leave until every one of those fans were delighted.  He was a simply lovely man to be in the presence of. Some of my favorite memories in life are working on that film and being around him. He's smart, generous, funny, quick witted, and a fantastic musician.  Your man crush is VERY well placed."

I was weeping because Chirpy Chirp left me so unceremoniously. It broke my heart. You know my father was right: Chirpy Chirp never saw me as his friend. After all we had been through he didn't even look back. But I have to believe there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know it, I felt it. Even if I can't prove it. You know, I left so much behind: my family, the car. I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him. To tell him, without his lessons I would never have survived. I know Chirpy Chirp's a bird but I wish I had said, ""It's over. We survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Chirpy Chirp. You'll always be with me. May God be with you."

He was amazed to find that the bird survived the collision and was wedged under the ski box. Because the weather outside was frigid and the critter appeared to be hurt, Ron decided to bring it into his car for a little while to warm up.

HumansBeingBros,3ci4di,treefitty350,3,Wed Jul 8 10:30:56 2015 UTC,Especially Goldens. They are very loyal to their family/owners but not often aggressive. This can be a blessing or a curse. If they ar ein a family with little kids they will never let those kids out of sight. But if they're stuck with an abusive owner they won't fight back and when they eventually get abandoned they get depressed and lonely like this little guy. Obviously not all dogs are the same but goldens tend to be very loyal but get depressed when away from a friend or loyal companion. Either way they are still cute (like my little Besty babe! :) ) and this gif made me very happy!

There is no right/wrong move besides to call the police and hope they show up before you get robbed. However, chances are: if they mean to hurt you in any way, they would probably have already done it.  Imagine a mugging: the gun is there to distract you from the fact that you're being robbed. They probably don't want to use it, because   a: If they wanted to shoot you, they already would have, and looted your corpse.   b: Guns are loud, draw more attention than is necessary, and makes a clean getaway that much less likely  I'm not saying ""Be Clint Eastwood"" and fight them, I'm just saying that you can probably bet on ""just smile and give them the money"" and you will likely walk away, albeit a few dollars poorer.

At hand-hand distances it can be argued that it's even easier than with a gun.  Not easy to keep yourself from being killed with a knife... unless of course you are armed yourself; with something with more range than a knife.  And you think it's fine and dandy that your govt. has stripped you of your freedom to protect yourself.  Justice would have been that clerk having a pistol behind the counter and splitting that piece of shit's head in two.  You'd never have to worry about him robbing somebody again.  Millions upon millions of firearms and owners of said firearms in the US, kill nobody."
HumansBeingBros,3ce8c6,token5gtd,13,Tue Jul 7 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"So, as an American, I'd like to point out what you said that hinders your argument instead of helping it  ""Justice would have been that clerk having a pistol behind the counter and splitting that piece of shit's head in two. You'd never have to worry about him robbing somebody again.""  Oh really?  Lets just kill a guy for robbing a store?  Regardless of your stance on death penalty, we don't perform it for a robbery, so how is that justice?  Karma maybe but I wouldn't say justice.  What about the robber?  There have been several unfounded accusations of his mental state/drug situation that may or may not be true, but it could be he's simply starving.  I'm all for freedom and allowing guns, but frankly based on your comment, I wouldn't want you anywhere near one.  You are correct that guns don't kill people, people wielding them do, which is why the people wielding them should be able to make sound decisions and not be irrational."

Or body shot, as then a doctor might be able to save him.  You taking the situation to the extreme of killing a guy is what makes me not want you to have access to a firearm, and it appears by the karma score of your original comment that many agree with me.  Just because you have a gun, and are in a situation where the law might look the other way, doesn't mean you should kill someone that has wronged you, especially when there are other options open.  Your declaration of what action you would take during this situation is, in my book, the same as premeditated murder.  Think about what an officer would do in the situation.  Any officer worth their salt would of course draw their weapon, but then attempt to talk down and subdue the offender, not go for a headshot.  They would only use the gun if it was apparent that the offender was going to hurt someone."

That being said, we all should be aware of the bystander effect. In situations where you can help, you really should, and should not allow the feelings of fear and apathy to play a part. As with everything in life, we should use common sense and protect life first.  When I was a teenager, I saved a girl's life by calling the police after reading her suicide note.

The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help.

HumansBeingBros,3c24un,drbatookhanxx,90,Sat Jul 4 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened here in Colorado.  Man took his German Shepard hiking up a 14,000 foot mountain,  dog got exhausted and paws got chapped up and couldn't come back down, then the weather turned.  Apparently he made the decision that it would be too dangerous to go back down with his dog in that shape so he just left his dog up there.   A week later some hikers found her toward the top with her paws all messed up,  they couldn't bring her back down because she was too heavy but they left some water and bandaged her paws,  and climbed back down to find help. Forest service said they couldn't help since they don't devote resources to save animals, so they turned to a forum for mountain climbers and a couple of experienced ones volunteered to bring her down. . they went up the next day but couldn't find her. Went back up again the day after that,  managed to find her and put her in a rucksack and brought her down the mountain.  She got seen by a vet and nursed back to health after over a week at the top of a mountain.   The guy who owned her came forward and admitted what happened and begged forgiveness, nobody did.  He was charged with animal cruelty,  plead guilty,  and agreed to give up the dog to a rescue.   Long story short - don't be an idiot and bring up anyone or anything if you can't bring them back down."

HumansBeingBros,3c24un,AlCapooter,52,Sat Jul 4 08:56:36 2015 UTC,That's the reason people should use hiking shoes for dogs.
HumansBeingBros,3c24un,FluxSurface,9,Sat Jul 4 11:30:00 2015 UTC,"I've considered using those on my dog. I've never had problems with her, even on long hikes, except when she is running in the snow then she gets cold pretty quick.   Have you used these on your dog before? All the others I've tried are clunky or uncomfortable for her."
HumansBeingBros,3c24un,AlCapooter,4,Sat Jul 4 16:54:32 2015 UTC,They don't stay on my dog. Shes a Shiba for reference. She loves them but they just fly right off when she gets going.

HumansBeingBros,3c24un,double-dog-doctor,3,Sat Jul 4 23:06:56 2015 UTC,It all depends on calluses. If your dog is used to walking she will have developed decent calluses which beat any shoes :)
HumansBeingBros,3c24un,phaederus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"It's always good to carry around some bag balm or chapstick just in case. My golden who loves hikes (but somehow always knows when we're heading back) also loves it when I message her feet after long hikes. I don't think anyone knows I do this because they might think its weird but her feet do get chapped and sort of sore after longer stretches so if its cold or her pads get chapped for some reason I will give them a message and soften them up with some chapstick, wait a bit so her feet aren't soft for the way back and off we go. It makes a big difference because it gives her time to rest, feels good, and makes her feet like new."

Take your dog for regular, short walks on pavement and it should build up tougher paws. The idea that the solution to you not letting your dog walk around outside enough should not be to jam shoes on it. It's just humiliating and damaging to the dog long term"
HumansBeingBros,3c24un,FunkyEd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:07:55 2015 UTC,My dog loves them. Sure its good to walk them without them on normal daily walks but if you're going on hikes that will take a couple hours to a day these are great. My dog loves them. I often go cross country skiing and they keep her paws warmer and less chapped from the cold and snow. If its raining they prevent her from slipping in mud and also save me the pain of cleaning up muddy paw prints all over the house (that was an added bonus after I got them). I got them after she stepped on a sharp rock and hurt her paw pretty badly so although strong pads are great theres no harm in adding an 1/4 in. of rubber as well if you think you're gunna need it.

HumansBeingBros,3c24un,mclendenin,15,Sat Jul 4 20:10:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you just don't realize your dogs paws are going to suffer on certain terrain.  I went to the mountains to rock climb one day, but would be gone too long to leave my dog at home so I brought her with us. The weather was mild and the ground was soft, so it never occurred to me that it would be a problem, plus she would spend most of the time laying down while we climbed. She seemed to be having a good time, relaxing and sniffing and getting all kinds of attention.   Walking back to the car at the end of the day, she just stopped in the trail. At that point I noticed her paws were burned and cut up. My heart fucking sank. I carried her the rest of the way to the car, and felt like the shittiest person alive for days.   My dog is my world, and making a mistake does not make you a shitty owner, it makes you human. What matters is you learn from it, which I definitely did and I'm sure this guy did too."
HumansBeingBros,3c24un,hadtoomuchtodream,10,Sat Jul 4 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've definitely made this mistake before too.  Dog spent a long day playing fetch, having a great time.

And these guys did something almost no one ever had to do. They raced against an acutal timer. If I sit behind the wheel of my firetruck I know that I have to get to the scene ASAP, but I never have a timer in front of me. I don't know if I could handle racing through rush hour with so little time. The regular time this journey would have taken should average about 90 minutes to two hours I guess.

In the 90s Dashcam footage was pretty rare, and even on Police Camera Action or World's Wildest Police Videos, it was still always cut so tightly to just show the crucial moments.   This episode showed a sustained high speed bit of driving through one of the most congested cities in Europe at mind boggling speed, it was totally thrilling, and even though I knew they made it, I was still on the edge of my seat.

HumansBeingBros,3brtjc,MortisMortavius,77,Thu Jul 2 01:10:10 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the awesome skiers who hold a pole out for snowboarders in runouts; thank you to everyone that does that.
HumansBeingBros,3brtjc,downhillcarver,25,Wed Jul 1 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"I've never seen this, why are they holding a pole out and what is it accomplishing?"
HumansBeingBros,3brtjc,MortisMortavius,70,Wed Jul 1 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"They'll usually yell, ""pole"" when they're coming up behind you to let you know they're holding it out for you. Particularly if you're on a mountain new to you, you may not know the length of the runout section, and as a snowboarder, that means taking a boot out and skating along till you get to a grade. Skiers will brace themselves and give you a pull along to help get some forward momentum going and get you passed the runout :)"
HumansBeingBros,3brtjc,downhillcarver,39,Wed Jul 1 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, runout meaning a flat portion of the mountain before it descends again? I was picturing the final runout at the bottom of the slope.  That's pretty cool! How often does it end up with one of the two just eating powder?"
HumansBeingBros,3brtjc,MortisMortavius,14,Wed Jul 1 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"Haha haven't had that happen to me yet, so I've no idea! I can tell you from my own personal experience though; a higher rate of skiers on the  ice east coast seem to offer, compared to the west coast."
HumansBeingBros,3brtjc,neogod,16,Wed Jul 1 20:53:21 2015 UTC,I've only ever boarded on the west coast and didn't even know this was a thing. Honestly though if it's not 100 feet or more I'm going to just hop instead of taking a strap off.

He was, technically, changing lanes every time he did that, after all."

HumansBeingBros,3br6lw,Manospeed,21,Wed Jul 1 14:17:48 2015 UTC,Judging people by how they look is just stupid. When I've been stuck on the side of the road the soccer moms and business dudes never stop. It's always the awesome bearded biker or the pierced guy that stops to help. Always.
HumansBeingBros,3br6lw,Fatgreyclouds,9,Wed Jul 1 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"Judging people by their appearance is a difficult habit to rid oneself of. You even did it yourself, by saying that the soccer moms and business dudes never stop; you're judging them based on attire and vehicle type. It's in our nature to prejudge as a defense mechanism. On top of that, profiling is a very useful way of quickly narrowing down a selection of people based on traits that are more common to a certain type of person, eg. a man in a fine suit is more likely to be a white collar worker than a blue collar one.  Not to say that profiling is acceptable in all situations, but it definitely has its uses."
HumansBeingBros,3br6lw,DoctorPringles,3,Wed Jul 1 17:44:22 2015 UTC,I don't feel that discerning between societal norms and those that don't fit those preconceived notions counts as judging at all. It's quite removed from judging people based on those things.
HumansBeingBros,3br6lw,Fatgreyclouds,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"The Doctor is right. Sorry about that.  Discerning between societal norms and those who do not fit them could entail making the observation that a biker or pierced dude has adopted an appearance outside of the norm, but it is a different thing than making the statement that soccer Moms never stop to help.  That is a judgement based on your experience.  You extrapolated a pattern from a relatively small sample.  Unfortunately, anything less than a total sampling of all soccer moms is profiling.  There's nothing wrong with that, it's inescapable.  Our minds a designed to find patterns.  The trick, which the Doctor was pointing out, is to be aware of your biases and to recognize when you are about to tar all soccer moms with the same brush."

HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,TehFuriousOne,30,Tue Jun 30 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Gift cards are actually an accounting hassle for businesses. The balance on the card is considered unearned income and is what's called a ""contra-asset"" (essentially a liability). For big businesses, like Best Buy, the small unearned balances add up. Imagine a million gift cards with a few bucks each sitting in drawers somewhere. The have to retire them at some point or it will totally fuck your balance sheet up"
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,bluecamel17,3,Wed Jul 1 01:01:59 2015 UTC,"Why don't they just account for it, seeing as they were paid for it?"
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,ItzMatt415,10,Wed Jul 1 05:05:30 2015 UTC,they would still have that contra-asset pulling their revenue down. since they would technically be in debt to the customer and have not earned the money yet.
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,bluecamel17,4,Wed Jul 1 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's just a convoluted way of saying that they were paid for a service or goods that they haven't provided yet.  Seems like they should plan for that if they're selling gift cards.  It's not like they didn't get the money."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,ItzMatt415,3,Wed Jul 1 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"they can record the cash, but it would be taken right out of the revenue until it expires or is exchanged for services or items. so it really hurts their books as it continues to bring their net income down for a long time. and they did plan for unused gift cards, its the expiration.   also please take note that every sale must be accounted for, they cannot just say ""hey lets put this account somewhere else until they finally buy something with their credit, then we can transfer it back"" that would be missleading for the revenue they actually earned."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,bluecamel17,3,Wed Jul 1 06:37:23 2015 UTC,"I understand, but the pro-business/anti-consumer explanation is very strange.  They don't ""have"" to do any of it.  They choose to sell gift cards.  Yes, the customer also agrees to the expiration terms.  All the explanations here are essentially the opposite of saying that a debtor has to not repay debt because it hurts their books.  It's a clever business strategy, especially when they've managed to get so many people talking about ""contra-assets"" and ignoring the fact that businesses make a ton of money from unused gift cards."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,ItzMatt415,3,Wed Jul 1 06:50:36 2015 UTC,"as long as regulations allow it companies will take advantage of it. im sorry if i came off a little aggressive, im studying to be an accountant and was excited i got to talk about it."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,bluecamel17,2,Wed Jul 1 06:59:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't think you were aggressive.  Maybe defensive, but a good convo ;)"
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,TehFuriousOne,2,Wed Jul 1 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"It's not really a strategy. They're just following GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). There's really not much, if any, leeway in how they account for them."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,kmrst,4,Wed Jul 1 10:40:07 2015 UTC,"No. Gift cards are the store saying that they give credit up to that amount 'free'. They usually charge an equal price for the card, but sometimes give them away for contests and whatnot. It is completely up to the store to manage expiration because it is not actually legal tender."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,GeneralBS,11,Tue Jun 30 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which set consumer protections for gift cards based on many state laws. The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fee on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. The federal law creates a floor for regulation and leaves room for state regulation on redeeming gift cards for cash and unclaimed property provisions.   http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/gift-cards-and-certificates-statutes-and-legis.aspx  ah 5 year limit, just noticed OP's was issued in 2013."
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,kmrst,2,Tue Jun 30 22:06:19 2015 UTC,Huh. Didn't know that. Thank you for telling me.
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,GeneralBS,8,Tue Jun 30 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"In CA is illegal for them to expire unless they were given out for a promotion or to employees.   Most gift certificates and gift cards sold by retail sellers for use with the seller and its affiliates cannot contain an expiration date or a service fee, including a fee for dormancy.   and is pretty much considered legal tender, since it basically is a pre-paid credit card.   Any gift certificate sold after January 1, 1997, is redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.4 Effective January 1, 2008, any gift certificate with a cash value of less than $10 is redeemable in cash, which includes currency or check, for its cash value.   http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/s-11.shtml"
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,quittrollingyourself,0,Tue Jun 30 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"Less than 10 dollars it's redeemable in cash. Over $10 ""or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder"" is probably what you're getting from the business."

HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,mybaby51,-5,Wed Jul 1 13:29:57 2015 UTC,"see, they already had the mom as a customer, and the money was already spent on the card...basically they just returned it because there was nothing else they could do and were nice about it"
HumansBeingBros,3bo8ua,mybaby51,2,Wed Jul 1 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"I'm confused what you mean by ""money was already spent on the card""?

Life often puts us in a position where we can do something nice for someone, and I say, why not just do it? especially if it costs you fuck all (or nothing.)  I know its a motivational speaker story but i remember it quite well  While walking along a beach, an elderly gentleman saw someone in the distance leaning down, picking something up and throwing it into the ocean.  As he got closer, he noticed that the figure was that of a young man, picking up starfish one by one and tossing each one gently back into the water.  He came closer still and called out, “Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?” The young man paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean.” The old man smiled, and said, “I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?” To this, the young man replied, “The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw them in, they’ll die.”  Upon hearing this, the elderly observer commented, “But, young man, do you not realise that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can’t possibly make a difference!”  The young man listened politely. Then he bent down, picked up another starfish, threw it into the back into the ocean past the breaking waves and said, “It made a difference for that one.”  EDITED CAUSE I SUCK AT DAT TYPING THANG YO"

Most sports do not allow fighting but fights frequently break out. In stark contrast, after any fighting match there is a genuine concern for the opponent, as is the bumping of the gloves before and the hug after the match. I kickboxed pretty seriously for 15 years and did random taekwondo, karate, boxing and muay Thai competitions and experienced first-hand that the amount of respect that both fighters gain for each other during a fight is unseen in most other sports."

HumansBeingBros,3ayrwv,EXTREMELYLAME,38,Fri Jun 26 00:47:01 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain this sport? It looks like a combination of wrestling and .... sumo?  EDIT: for the lazy:  Sambo (Russian: са́мбо; IPA: [ˈsambə]; САМозащита Без Оружия) is a Russian martial art and combat sport.[1][2] The word ""SAMBO"" is an acronym for SAMozashchita Bez Oruzhiya, which literally translates as ""self-defense without weapons"". Sambo is relatively modern since its development began in the early 1920s by the Soviet Red Army to improve their hand-to-hand combat abilities.[1] Intended to be a merger of the most effective techniques of other martial arts, Sambo has roots in Japanese judo, international styles of wrestling, plus traditional folk styles of wrestling such as: Armenian Kokh, Azerbaijani Gulesh, Georgian Chidaoba, Kazakh Kures, Mongolian Khapsagay, Romanian Trîntǎ, Tatar Köräş, and Uzbek Kurash,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art)  EDIT 2: This helps explain what they are doing:   There are three recognized competitive sport variations of Sambo (though Sambo techniques and principles can be applied to many other combat sports).[5]  Sport Sambo (Russian: Борьбa Самбо, Bor'ba Sambo, Sambo Wrestling (eng)) is stylistically similar to Olympic Freestyle Wrestling or Judo, but with some differences in rules, protocol, and uniform. For example, in contrast with judo, Sambo allows some types of leg locks, while not allowing chokeholds. It focuses on throwing, ground work and submissions, with (compared to Judo) very few restrictions on gripping and holds.[6]  Combat Sambo (Russian: Боевое Самбо, Boyevoye Sambo). Utilized and developed for the military, Combat Sambo resembles modern mixed martial arts, including extensive forms of striking and grappling. Combat Sambo allows punches, kicks, elbows, knees, headbutts and groin strikes.[7] Competitors wear jackets as in sport sambo, but also hand protection and sometimes shin and head protection. The first FIAS World Combat Sambo Championships were held in 2001. The World Combat Sambo Federation, based in Russia, also sanctions international combat sambo events.  Freestyle Sambo – Created and debuted by the American Sambo Association (ASA) in 2004. These rules differ from traditional Sport Sambo in that they allow choke holds and other submissions that are not permitted in Sport Sambo such as certain neck cranks and twisting foot locks. Freestyle Sambo, like all Sambo, focuses on throwing skills and fast ground work. No strikes are permitted in Freestyle Sambo. The ASA created this rule set in order to encourage non-Sambo practitioners from judo and jujutsu to participate in Sambo events.[8]"
HumansBeingBros,3ayrwv,Roflkopt3r,8,Wed Jun 24 16:22:58 2015 UTC,Fedor Emalienenko was a combat sambo champion and for a long time regarded the best MMA heavyweight in the world. These sports go really close together.

Blame is on the BLR team though, there was no particular need to write the name like they did - the more conventional ""Styapan"" would have probably been better understood.

HumansBeingBros,3ayrwv,Brian175,3,Thu Jun 25 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"I think its because you said you don't like it when you even admitted you don't understand it. Indeed your opponent gets points for infractions. It prevents people from doing things like stalling. A point is not a huge deal. As you could see from that match, it didn't matter. As for the ground work only joint locks are allowed and you have to apply them quickly like Judo, so all that grabbing at lapels that didn't quickly result in some action will just get stood up. Sambo is a takedown sport with some ground work."
HumansBeingBros,3ayrwv,shyraven,4,Fri Jun 26 01:23:22 2015 UTC,It's not. You have to remember this is at the highest level. Things are tight in any sport. You can score up to 4 points in one action. Right before the ankle lock he scored 2 points and then finished the match via submission.
HumansBeingBros,3ayrwv,BetaZetaSig,3,Wed Jun 24 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"He commented ""you have to remember"" because like any sport, if you and your opponent are in the ""top tier"" things will be tight (points, what have you).

HumansBeingBros,3b0iy5,babybbeers,4,Thu Jun 25 00:07:04 2015 UTC,It's a really great feel when you have awesome hotel staff. They really can make the place feel like home.
HumansBeingBros,3b0iy5,Threepwood94,3,Thu Jun 25 20:57:40 2015 UTC,It was a little combo effort between the local liquor store and the manager of the hotel. It was very heartening that they were both so willing to help out.

HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,GallowBoob,263,Tue Jun 23 15:20:18 2015 UTC,My best friends dad caught a guy who tried jumping off a building. It destroyed his lower back and he has had to be on medication everyday for the past 30 years for it. To this day he says that he should have just let the guy die. That's all I can think of when I see someone catch a falling person.
HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,dockersshoes,76,Tue Jun 23 16:58:51 2015 UTC,I'm curious what happened to the guy he caught.

HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,K_Furbs,105,Tue Jun 23 18:21:35 2015 UTC,You say that now but living with constant back pain for the rest of your life might change your mind eventually
HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,sxewolfey,-38,Tue Jun 23 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Nah,  I already have back problems. If they would have stemmed from a rescued life then I would be perfectly fine with that."

HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,sxewolfey,16,Tue Jun 23 21:35:55 2015 UTC,"Or maybe he didn't. Maybe he took that as a wake up call that life isn't so bad, and good people still exist. He could have turned his life around and could be happy right now, all because your friend's dad did the right thing and saved him.   Even if thats not the case, that was a great thing his dad did. All life is important, he should be proud of that decision, not regret it."
HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,4handzmp,13,Tue Jun 23 18:36:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and guess that you've never had chronic back pain...  Just saw your other post. Don't believe you, but whatever..."
HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,sxewolfey,12,Tue Jun 23 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"Actually I have. I work in construction and it runs in my family. I know what back pain is like. It would still totally be worth it. You can believe whatever the hell you want though, I couldn't care less."

HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,AsteroidShark,3,Tue Jun 23 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"""All life is important"", eh? So why not the quality of it? What the fuck is life if you spend it in pain and unfulfilled because you can't live the way you want to live? Sometimes I think people who say ""all life is important"" really mean ""I'm uncomfortable with death""."

HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,Kazumara,8,Tue Jun 23 18:31:15 2015 UTC,I like that the gymnast gave the guy a pat on the back and a quick thank you. He must have been incredibly upset with himself but was clearly grateful that the spotter stepped in.
HumansBeingBros,3au6sg,5ka5,8,Tue Jun 23 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"I was just gonna say he didn't seem to thank him enough. That short pat was all? How about a real thank you, that was a great reaction."
