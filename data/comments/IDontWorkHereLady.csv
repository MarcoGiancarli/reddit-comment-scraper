IDontWorkHereLady,3e46lv,ColScimitar,2,Tue Jul 21 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"That's how I got my part time job at Blockbuster (may they rest in peace) - I was always in there, and I love movies.  Whenever I was in there, I would help around me, and the manager there asked me if I was interested in pitching in with a couple of nights a week.  When our store closed, I was one of the shift managers.  Loved that place."

If she was politely asking, it's kind of a dick move not to help if possible.  That said, starting out with ""HEY!"" isn't usually the prelude to a polite request."
IDontWorkHereLady,3e4iks,MT_Straycat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  But a polite request would at least be in the form of a question and would hopefully include the word ""please""."

IDontWorkHereLady,3e4iks,thats_satan_talk,4,Wed Jul 22 01:20:11 2015 UTC,maybe she was just asking you genuinely for help and you probably looked like a dick by not helping her.
IDontWorkHereLady,3e4iks,inthrees,2,Tue Jul 21 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"if she was asking nicely I would have helped no doubt in my mind. It was hot and she was probably frustrated when she asked me to help. from the tone in her voice there was no way she was getting help from me. well unless she said ""HEY, I'll give you $10 to load my car!"""
IDontWorkHereLady,3e4iks,thats_satan_talk,4,Wed Jul 22 01:17:58 2015 UTC,I'm siding with her on this one. Don't need to be working to do something nice.

And with the messed up company wide raise we had, my 3 years of raises and great reviews are out the window because I make the same amount as the new hires. Time to write a new resume I guess"
IDontWorkHereLady,3dl4bz,TheArtofPolitik,12,Sat Jul 18 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Nah. As a retail manager, I'd love to give my best employees raises, but it's completely out of my hands. Even suggesting a raise to my boss for one of my employees outside of yearly evaluations will get a laugh. Half the time, you'll get the big ""raises are being frozen because our company can't manage its finances"" announcement a couple of months before evals to make sure you don't expect that big shiny extra nickel on your paycheck when they do come.  Believe me, it's just as frustrating for you as it is for me. My job would be so much easier if I could just pay people  their worth, or at least a decent chunk above the $7.25 minimum wage."

IDontWorkHereLady,3dl4bz,deegan87,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"I tried that at the retail job I held through high school and college. They didn't want to pay me more or promote me into a position related to my degree, so I kept working there for three months while I hunted for a job that was related to my field. I took said degree-related job for a year making the same pay as retail, and now I'm at my third job where I make full use of my degree where I make much more than what I made in retail.  My point is that if you bust your ass trying to show your worth, you might develop some self-worth and the confidence to leave a company that doesn't think you're extraordinary.  EDIT: Multiple jobs CAN look good on your CV if you are in a creative field because it shows a diverse background and the ability to work with multiple teams. Also because freelance."

IDontWorkHereLady,3dg1ma,BefuddledBison,20,Thu Jul 16 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"That is a terrifying situation.  I had just moved into a new rent house with a couple roommates. We only had one key at the time so we would leave the back door unlocked. Well one morning as i was just laying in bed, and both roommates were at work, somebody entered my house. I thought it was one of my roomies. Then as they came closer i realize i did not recognize the voices. I fly outta bed, grab my gun, and go have a look. Two people I've never seen before are just walking around checking stuff out. About this time, my adrenaline kicks in. Im shaking like a leaf in a tree. Can barely speak. So they look up and see me wearing nothing more than underwear and crazy eyes pointing a giant Dirty Harry magnum at them. All I can say(more likely i was screaming at them) is ""I live here. Get out."" So they decide i was making a good point and they leave. Turns out, it was just a nice young couple looking at the house listed for rent in the paper that Idiot landlord was still running a week later. I shook for an hour afterwards. Adrenaline is no joke."

IDontWorkHereLady,3dg1ma,Sasparillafizz,84,Thu Jul 16 00:16:43 2015 UTC,I don't think it was a blackout so much as autopilot. Fight or Flight can have some strange effects on memory
IDontWorkHereLady,3dg1ma,DeadlyVoltages,50,Thu Jul 16 00:43:52 2015 UTC,Truth.  Adrenaline really messes with your head
IDontWorkHereLady,3dg1ma,tnb641,9,Thu Jul 16 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"What others are saying is true.   I've never been in some crazy shit, but I've had a couple tense moments (no firearms involved).   You just get into fight or flight mode (I've found out that I'm unfortunately a fighter most of the time...) and everything you do is sort of a programmed reflex, you don't have much say in what in it, because your brain is falling back on millennia of survival instinct.  The thing from personal experience that I can tell you, is you never want to get into a fight again just someone with a knife, much less if you're unarmed.   But from my unarmed-vs-knife training (it was CQB-Unarmed/Baton course from my employer, we used a taser knife at mid-range settings, still hurts like hell) I can say that it's much harder to stop someone with a knife than you'd think. And scarier still, is you have so much adrenaline pumping (this is only from the fear of a shock, not life or death) that you often don't even feel the shock, let alone the impact of it hitting you. You could be dead and not even realize it.  TL:DR: Fight or flight overrules what you think, life or death is a finer line than you'd think, and can occasionally become one and the same (if only for a brief time).   All you can do is hope the little influence you have in that moment, is to make the right decision."
IDontWorkHereLady,3dg1ma,epiwssa,2,Thu Jul 16 16:35:01 2015 UTC,"I can say that it's much harder to stop someone with a knife than you'd think.   I never got how people think stopping someone with a knife is easy. Yes, it can inflict injury that is fatal. But commonly its not injury thats INSTANTLY or QUICKLY fatal.   Stab a guy with a knife, he can still punch, kick and do everything he can to fuck you up. If anything the pain and adrenaline can make him more aggressive. Yeah, 1-2 minutes later he'll be in bad damn shape, but he'll still have plenty of time, mobility and motivation to be on the offensive.   The 'stab a guy once and they fall over dead' thing that happens in the movies tends to only happen in real life if you are VERY damn lucky, particularly in a scuffle while holding off a guy who's trying to fuck you up. Knives are slow way of taking someone down compared to, say, blunt trauma damage or a tazer. Still damn fatal mind, just don't expect it to be easy because you have a stiletto and they don't."
IDontWorkHereLady,3dg1ma,DeadlyVoltages,-7,Sat Jul 18 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"If OP gets so overwhelmed by this situation they cannot be trusted with a gun. I've been in similar situations but I'm mentally and emotionally sound enough to deal with them. OP is not.  edit: I don't care what anyone says. OP is a danger to everyone around them. If they're not mentally capable they should NOT own such a weapon! I don't give a damn what a bunch of gunloving idiots say: NO, not everyone should be allowed to own a gun! Not everyone should be allowed to carry one in public! Not everyone should be allowed to carry a CONCEALED gun! OP definitely shouldn't. Most people shouldn't. THEY DO NOT MAKE THINGS BETTER, ONLY WORSE.  OP, the guy who confronted you was a prick. YOU, however, are even worse. You shouldn't own that weapon and you definitely shouldn't carry it. I hope you give it up but you won't have the intelligence to do so.  Keep downvoting me, everyone. Won't change the fact that you are wrong. You are all dangerous people.  The world will be a better place when less people own guns. Anything can be a deadly weapon which is a common argument that you do not need to repeat (which will leave you with few arguments since none of you can come up with real ones) but a gun allows someone to be even deadlier in the heat of the moment. YOU DO NOT NEED GUNS TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILIES. Enough of that. That's not an argument. That's lunacy.  I'm done ranting. I'm sick of everyone who is all for carrying guns for anything other than recreational use at a RANGE or hunting.

IDontWorkHereLady,3csd4z,Beagle2007,3,Sat Jul 11 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"So listen to this: A few years ago I used to work for Target overnight on their planogram team. I was in the store shopping one day wearing black jeans and a black t-shirt for a metal band that I like. I'm walking down an aisle pushing a cart and a lady walks up to me and asks me if I work in this department. I looked down at my clothing and then up at her and said ""I don't work here."" This struck me as odd because not only was I wearing nothing that even resembled a target uniform, but I didn't even work during the day so its not like she could have recognized me. even today I will be at the retailer that I work at on my day off and people still ask me questions even though I work in the back room and have no customer interaction. My theory is that people will notice if you look comfortable in a place and assume you work there. for example at target i knew the place well and knew where everything was so i looked comfortable shopping there. if i wasn't familiar with the place i would have been looking around curiously and wondering aimlessly around. I think if you walked around like you had never been there before, then people wouldn't ask you questions. That's just my theory."

IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,DragonDeadite,2,Thu Jul 9 16:28:41 2015 UTC,Is one color more professional than another?
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,savesthedaystakn,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if there is a hierarchy of color professionalism. Black can definitely be a professional color, however, if it were the only color a person ever wore, day in, day out, I would probably think it were less professional and more that the person was trying to make a personal statement."
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,DragonDeadite,3,Tue Jul 14 19:39:02 2015 UTC,"trying to make a personal statement.     Personal statement: ""I LIKE BLACK!"""
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,savesthedaystakn,2,Tue Jul 14 19:43:01 2015 UTC,That much would be apparent. I think people might naturally wonder why you like black so much to the point that it is the only color you wear.
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,DragonDeadite,2,Tue Jul 14 19:47:55 2015 UTC,I think I wouldn't care what people think.  :)
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,savesthedaystakn,3,Tue Jul 14 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"Lots and lots of people say that and we would all like to think that we're cool enough to not have to conform to societal norms but I think the reality is, unless you're an actual sociopath, you absolutely care what other people think due to instinctual urges to be accepted into the tribe. Otherwise I don't think you would go out of your way to only wear black as it would be easier and more care-free to just buy and wear whatever color circumstance presented, no matter how mismatched."
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,DragonDeadite,4,Tue Jul 14 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying this argument because I'm bored and am still a goth at heart, but I was gonna let it drop so as to not come off as too much of a dick... however... your comment... it makes me grin like an idiot.  I am wearing a neon green polo and blue jeans.  My collection of WORK shirts includes the aforementioned neon green shirt, a neon pink shirt, two bright yellow shirts, about SIX green shirts of different shades, a nice pink one that I quite enjoy, and a few black and blue ones.    Am I a sociopath?  No idea... but I sure as hell don't care what you or anyone else thinks about it.  :)"
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,savesthedaystakn,2,Tue Jul 14 20:06:20 2015 UTC,"It didn't think it was an argument, but I'm sorry you took it that way. I was merely trying to suss out the fact that you dress in all black to make a statement, which ""am still a goth at heart"" sort of proves. Also, you kind of withheld the fact that you do actually wear other colors besides black. If you had mentioned that in the first place, instead of just stating that you only wear black, there probably would have been a whole lot less sussing.  Furthermore, since you mentioned yourself that you follow the goth trend...isn't following a trend more or less the definition of caring about what other people think?"
IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,DragonDeadite,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"-quick scan of comments- Nope, never said I only wear black... just defending those that do because it is fun.  :)    Argument, discussion, either way, I'm having fun.  I like your argument!  I find myself wanting to respond with ""No man, I'm not that kind of goth! I'm the cool kind!"" which is, in itself, a faulty statement, yes?  Trends exist because multiple people see something and decide they like it, so they start doing it!!  SOME people follow trends because it is (heh) trendy!  Others look at a trend and go ""Hey, that speaks to me... let me try it out."" and that's the end of it.  Me?  I like how the goth style looks.  I think I look good in black (as does my wife) so when I get dressed up for a night out I will tend to grab my black shirt and black slacks, put on my silver jewelry, and enjoy myself.  I don't do it to hang out with other goths (besides my wife),   So does that mean I'm doing it because I care what other people think?  Or because I enjoy it myself?  Also... would age make a difference in your opinion on this matter?  I'm just curious... being 32 years old most people would assume I'd be out of my goth phase and more civilized.  I am neither out of my phase nor would I consider myself ""civilized"" in the broadest sense of the term.    And this started off with me saying I wasn't going to get back into this conversation!!  Damn you for keeping a civil tongue and dragging me back in!"

IDontWorkHereLady,3che37,HolaBingo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"I have a Apple Store story. This happened probably early last year some time. I wasn't wearing all black but rather pretty much all blue. I had on a navy blue baseball cap, a Unifirst Corporation jacket I got from my dad years ago that looks like this but blue without the name tags, just plain, a white t-shirt and jeans. He never worked there, I think my dad got it at a Goodwill or somewhere and then gave it to me before I left home years ago.   Anyways, I was playing on my android phone (in an Apple store :p ) waiting to get a new battery for my late model 2011 MacBook Pro since my old battery at the time was not keeping charge for more than a hour and it needed to be replaced. It was well over the charge cycle count.   This young lady about early to mid 20's comes up to me, with my back turned to her while I was leaning against a table, and just started asking me her question. I looked at her then she says: ""Um I need some help and why are you just playing games on your phone?"" I'm a pretty straight forward type of guy but she completely caught me off guard. I didn't take any offense cause mistakes happen which I've done just as she had, mistaken someone for an employee but without the snarkiness, just asking did they work there. Although, I did get the pleasure of telling her I didn't work there and she looked me up and down for a few moments then turned heel without another word.   At first it was pretty much a blank stare with a realization of unapologetic and oh oops. I just gave her a smile and nod. I thought it was funny cause I was wearing nothing that would make someone even remotely think I was an Apple Store employee."

IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,Frankly_George,36,Fri Jul 3 00:13:38 2015 UTC,It's probably a nervous thing. They probably don't think through the more polite option and they just cave under the pressure of a screaming person.
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,deathbutton1,10,Fri Jul 3 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Always made me take more care with my current customer, and announce over their shoulder that I would be with angry bitchface once I was done serving the current customer.  Obviously I didn't call them angry bitchface, but as I have been commended on my customer service skills by customers and managers alike I was never concerned about the potential complaints from one batty nutjob, especially if I could honestly say I was just trying to provide good service to my first customer by completing their transaction and that when possible I did my best to call for help from any free associates."
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,comradebunnie,3,Fri Jul 3 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, it's a reflex. I'm a server and if I have an upset table they will take up most of my time.

IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,SpecificallyGeneral,21,Fri Jul 3 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"I just quit the company he is talking about and that mindset is one of the biggest reasons I hated that place in the end. I've never cared for retail, but at this point they have trained customers to be rude. The customers were never a big deal for me, but lately it was everything I could to get through conversations with a lot of them. With me, you get more by being nice than by being rude and I always lived up to that rule, even when it got me in trouble. I have literally been in trouble for giving someone a huge discount when they ""weren't even angry."" Yeah, it was just a single mother who had been without a water heater for a month and was on the phone with her father begging him to pay for it because her card was declining. She was in tears, but was never anything but nice to us. She thought we were all cashiers and didn't know I was a manager, so I quietly went over and marked the until down significantly. She cried even more because she was now able to pay for it on her own card. She thanked me over and over again. The next day I got in trouble, not for the amount I marked it down, but because she wasn't angry. What did I learn from that? Anytime I needed manager approval for something I would tell them the customer was freaking out and angry.   That's what they are training people to do. Make a fuss and get your way. I have so many examples of two similarly screwed over customers and one pitches a fit and gets tons of money while the other is polite and nice and gets little to nothing."
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,ashleyamdj,13,Fri Jul 3 15:23:00 2015 UTC,"I work for a cable company, and I asked them a question a simple question ""how much will unlimited data be""  they told me the price, but said but you can have it for this many months free!   I was happy, thanked them and moved on.   I got curious if they put it through, so I looked up my account.  (different department)    notes on the account said ""customer asked about unlimited data,  was upset at the cost and would be unable to pay it, gave customer it free for remaining months""   in my mind i was like....was I mad?  I only asked for the price, but I am assuming it's for the reason you just said."
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,thatnerdynerd,6,Fri Jul 3 15:56:59 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I hope that they just really liked that you weren't mad and decided to help! I've done that many times since then.

IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,qbsmd,5,Mon Jul 6 16:03:13 2015 UTC,It's probably just what naturally happens when someone has a fight-or-flight response but can't actually punch the person or run away without getting fired. I can't imagine it going over well if stores put their employees through military style boot camp to train them for those situations.
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,DarkDubzs,5,Fri Jul 3 03:17:12 2015 UTC,I think it's to silence the screaming person as soon as possible so they don't make a scene and disturb the store and customers or scare them away.
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,thatnerdynerd,3,Mon Jul 6 03:50:48 2015 UTC,And then forever let them know  screaming will get them what they want.  Stores escorting them out takes a few mins  if not seconds at times.  Where as I've see  people standing there screaming for the longest time  even when they are getting what they want.  But you guys are right  many reasons. Some of them what you said probably
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,DarkDubzs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"I guess the second best option would be to have them kicked out. But then the company might not allow that because they're afraid that person might file a complaint or make a ruckus or some shit. Ideally they would just be kicked out for starting shit and they would never be heard of again, but these days everyone is so sensitive and anyone who plays the victim is appeased and corporate or media could side with the complaining person."
IDontWorkHereLady,3bwqa2,DeadlyVoltages,3,Mon Jul 6 05:37:36 2015 UTC,"They want to get rid of them. It's rarely about wanting to keep them as a customer, they're upset about the yelling and want to get that customer out of there as quickly as possible."

Doesn't matter who you are, the first person to raise their voice, even if right, are look at as losing the argument and their point made invalid almost instantly. It was in my best interest to keep calm and just get out of there and not let it affect me or waste my time.

IDontWorkHereLady,3btoew,randomdrifter54,4,Thu Jul 2 15:04:06 2015 UTC,Mind directing me to the case law that states this?
IDontWorkHereLady,3btoew,cnelsonsic,0,Thu Jul 2 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"Not a lawyer, but I believe it's more good business sense.  Being secular will net you more clients than publicly espousing a particular religion (and thereby alienating others). Unless you're in a concentrated area of that religion (eg: western Pennsylvania catering to the Amish, or Hasidic Jews in New York), you gain little because the majority of people are lazy and want a good deal more than they want to make a stand for their ideals (eg: people shopping at Walmart because they can't be arsed to go elsewhere, despite stances on import/export disproportion or artificially low wages relying on public/social services to adjust their employees to a living wage.)  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Burwell come to mind, as well as the repercussions from those opinions.  As far as gay wedding cakes - it's actually an international issue now.  The ACLU has officially condemned the RFRA as well.  Oh, and this is public school, so it's subject to stricter regulation than the private sector, but one district decided to prohibit religious flyers all together, rather than let a satanist temple hand out coloring books.  Tl;dr - no specific case law for distribution of religious material by an innkeeper yet, but..."

Bible + book of Mormon + Doctrine and Covenants + Pearl of Great Price. All Scriptures.)  The guy's behavior is surprising tho. Sure, we assume other LDS are going to obey the Word of Wisdom and all that, but we seldom assume a stranger is Mormon / impose out beliefs on a stranger that harshly. I live in a *highly *dense LDS community. And never jump on another guy for being a Muslim, just wait for an opportunity to discuss.   I guess it kinda sorta makes sense he assumed you were Mormon, but still. Does not sound like typical Mormon from our own point of view."

I was completely inexperienced trying to envision how the scenario of a customer standing behind the counter holding a phone with an absent cashier was supposed to proceed. I'd like to imagine had I stayed there, I'd just yell across the store ""hey, the bank's on the phone, can you finish ringing me up?"" I was embarrassed to be standing there in the first place."
IDontWorkHereLady,3bj46u,gmsc,16,Mon Jun 29 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"So there is a protocol to be followed after the people from the baml answer, I thought it was just ""does this check has funds?"" ""yes it does"" ""thank you"", kind of thing. And then it seemed ridiculous, the cashier trusted you to tell her that the people from the bank told you that you had money, but not to trust you to tell her that you had the money.  I don't know if I'm making any sense, but it just seems that it takes precisely the same amount of trust to believe in ""the check is vald"" than it does to belive in ""The poeple from the bank told me that the check is valid"". Also it's weird that you had to wait for someone to tell you what you already knew."

IDontWorkHereLady,3bj46u,thelonebard,15,Mon Jun 29 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I guess it's the difference between being a new adult or an experienced adult.  If I were an experienced adult who found myself coming to in that situation I would personally be like ""Wait. They have my legal tender. I have their goods. What am I doing this for?"" and I'd leave. But there's no WAY i'd have done that fifteen years ago.  Same goes for my honeymoon - we got put in a room at the bottom of the hill and there were workmen using power tools right outside our window every morning at 8am. Being naive 20 yr old kids we didn't say anything about it until checking out. They were apologetic, and thinking back on it I now know that I would absolutely now be (politely) marching up to the counter on day one saying ""Yeah, so is that construction site going to be a regular occurrence? No worries. How soon will you have a different room ready for us?""  It's not just hindsight being 20/20, I think there's a big developmental leap between being a young adult and a wiser adult. (Ooooh! another example! Like in ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" when Roseanne Barr's character has her parking spot stolen by a pair of young women, and they're like ""Face it, we're younger and faster than you!"" and so she smashes her car into their's and says ""Face it, I'm older and I have more insurance than you!""....

IDontWorkHereLady,3bj46u,Mixcoatll,9,Sun Jul 12 10:01:40 2015 UTC,"I remember the day I noticed that a local supermarket had a habbit of keeping the (backup/emergency?) cards to enable a register literally on the shelf under the register, all you had to do was scan the card and hey, enabled register. Press the same 3 buttons on any register to open a drawer. I get why they keep the cards around, it's pretty common during busy hours of the day for an employee to appear out of thin air and open a random register to stop lines backing up to the point customers can't navigate to half the store without forcing their way through an ocean of people. But these registers are basically double sided, with one side for bags walling off the employee's ""exit"" side. I could have just walked up early int he morning when there's one register open on the opposite side of the store (6am opening time, there's more employees stocking shelves than customers until about 7:30 when school kids start showing up.) and made off with a load of shopping and any change they'd stocked the register with and nobody would stop me. They seem to have stopped doing that these days, I wonder if it was because someone just did that. Walked up, opened a register for themselves and made a ""purchase"" then walked out."

Maybe they worked on commission or something, but even still you were there first and they are supposed to cater to your needs prior to helping another customer. She should not have gone off with the other customer, and should have called over another associate or even told her to hold on a few minutes while she finished your transaction. I sincerely hope she was fired that day."
IDontWorkHereLady,3bj46u,Skitterleaper,2,Wed Jul 1 03:34:12 2015 UTC,You should have followed up and gotten her fired.
IDontWorkHereLady,3bj46u,elvendude,9,Tue Jun 30 12:29:43 2015 UTC,"I feel that what the lady did was wrong, and if I was her supervisor I'd probably take that action. Honestly, I had a lot of self esteem issues going on at the time and my day was ruined, gone from excitement over a ""big event"" and ""the dress"" to a crying mess over being judged unfairly. Now that I'm older I would have better communication skills to follow through and see that the store's actions were corrected, so I agree with you. Honestly, today I would have demanded that SOMEONE sell me what I wanted if it was that important to me. My biggest regret was leaving the store and not making someone complete the transaction.   EDIT: Too many words in my sentence."

She might have known he didn't work there and was just asking a fellow shopper where something was. I've asked other shoppers where something was before, knowing full well they don't work there. And I've had other shoppers ask me where something is too, or ask me if I know about something if we're both looking at the same product. Sometimes I'm mistaken as an employee, sometimes not.

He thought that I was too expensive and that I didn't do my job by making sure that his report were properly logged into the system. He was trying to blame me for his mistakes, because I helped his predecessor (whom I was supposed to keep with the company) do those things.  He didn't read my contract as he was supposed to, so his third strike technically wasn't that he was trying to fire me, but that he didn't do his job reading my contract that says that he cannot fire me and that my job was to show up and breathe.

This is more common than it should be, in large part because the two other full time employees at my store are women, and we often get customers who ""need to talk with a man"" about something. Our employees are super polite even to these belligerent buttholes, but if the manager hears someone say that, he will not only refuse to help the customer, but will flat out tell them how inappropriate it is to behave like they have been.

Apparently I was being disrespectful to him, because I didn't speak his language.   Dude, I speak three different languages and understand yours, you don't even speak local. Get off the high horse!  I shrugged and walked away.   Every other time he came into the shop he tried to engage me by snapping his fingers at me. I usually walked in the other direction at that. Or just stared at him. (I have big blue eyes. People get very uncomfortable when I turn ""the stare"" on)  The other was a 40ish woman who looked at me from the other end of the shop and raised her fingers and snapped them.   It was my third 14h shift in a row and my mental filters were not at their best, so my instincts took over. That meant that I visibly chuckled and just walked in another direction.   While my ""customer service"" part of the brain was berating me for being rude, my newlyfound ""security person"" braincells were saying: ""the boss doesn't want us to talk to customers anyway, so we're just following orders.""  The lady apparently got the hint, because she came up to me saying that she knows that I am not a shop employee, maybe I still know where to find her product.   I did. Showed her and she said thank you."

Did have one guy be angry but it wasn't directed at me or my fellow workers, rather he was just angry in general that the actual store employees were pretty damn absent, so were we in that instance. Very hard to get a sku-check or verify something when there's no one around to ask.  Did have someone ask me where something was in a grocery store once. I told them the normal spiel about ""not knowing where it was and not working for the store but it's usually in the aisle with this other type of product."" Then I turned back to my shelf as they walked away and it was right in front of me. That got a few laughs from the customer and my coworkers. XD"

A few years ago he got in trouble for arguing with someone at one of the stores. He's from Australia, so people who aren't used to it have a hard time understanding him. Some guy was being hella rude to him in the aisle, my step dad said something back, and the guy asked ""Do you even speak English?!""  We were all so proud of him for only being written up for a verbal altercation and not arrested. He's a rugby-playing Aussie with a very short fuse, he's not someone to fuck with.

My coworker started asking all the relevant information to be able to book the appointment, name, DOB, address, phone number, email, etc. She asked the woman to repeat her last name as she wasn't sure she got it right the first time. All the sudden the client BLOWS UP, screaming and carrying on, hangs up. About 10 minutes later the client calls back and I answered and she said she needs to cancel her appointment because the ""registration process was painful"" and that we shouldn't have someone so incompetent answer the phones. I was in shock. Told her there was nothing wrong with my employee requesting she repeat herself for verification and that I was all too happy to cancel her appointment, have a nice day.

And the amount of time I noticed this that were incorrect on accounts because no one cares to verify was astounding.    I had to make a call a while back for whatever, and after asking my name, I guess the rep lost her place in her script and asked again.  I didn't think much of it, having done the same thing many times before. She realized and apologized profusely.  I didn't care at all, of course.  The next question, ""what's your current job?""

The job I had was just booking appointments for heating and cooling systems. Most of the time we had angry people it was over a routine visit that was pre-paid. So they weren't losing money/spending money. Nothing was broken. A lot of times it was just that the primary phone number on the account and that we'd verify wouldn't be the one they wanted for this appointment. ""I WANT MY CELL PHONE CALLED."" Okay but you don't have to yell. Or, god forbid, the wife called but the husband was the primary name on the account. Which doesn't matter. All they have to say is ""yes that's the correct account.""

You get these people after they've gone through the Automated Phone System From Hell, and then waited for a half hour of shitty hold music punctuated every 15 seconds by a chirpy ""YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US"" recording to make sure that they can't just relax and surf the web while holding on speakerphone.  It's as if your company decided that you should only trim the bear's claws after they've poked him for a half hour with a stick."
IDontWorkHereLady,3b24nl,Beautiful_Girlie_Bob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with you.  Though during the day when shifts were overlapping, there would be no wait times.  If we were super busy, then maybe a minute or two.  They were pretty strict about that.  Most of the calls during the day we to schedule maintenance.  Nothing wrong.  Most of these calls would take about two minutes to complete.  I've done it in under one before. Sometimes I think that if they had nothing to complain about, they'll make something to complain about.    We got a lot of complaints about our hold music though.  We didn't even have music.  We had a narrative of what services we offer. The company was shit though.  We had stores all over the US and Canada.  The only decent one was in Tennessee.  That one was great.  NJ and Florida centers were our problem children, and Calgary was by far the worst of them all.    Their customers reflected that, of course.  I just took the calls.    And for your information, we didn't surf the net between calls.  We didn't even have access to Google.  My shift played cards against humanity when it was slow.  ;)"
IDontWorkHereLady,3b24nl,electroskank,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"Heh heh, I meant that the hold messages prevent the customer from relaxing on hold on speakerphone, because they are waiting for a human voice and the recorded ""YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US"" messages make it impossible for the customer to do anything but sit and listen to the phone blather recorded inanities at them.  I try to be easygoing as hell when dealing with folks at their jobs, because I know work is hard enough without extra asshole in it.  But even I find myself ready to freakout by the time I finally hear that real human voice.  It happened just Monday morning, i was on hold for 34 minutes waiting to talk with a rep from my local electric & gas company.  They would play one and a half bars of a sort of Tex-Mex country pop song, then a voice would come on in one of three recorded messages that cycled endlessly, every 15 seconds.  It was so irritating that by the time the rep came on I probably would have snapped at him if the transaction had not gone 100% smoothly.

Though I hate talking in the phone, even family and friends, so when I have to call a company in usually shy and awkward, mixed with training from the call center.  I'm annoyingly patient in the phone because of that job.  I still find myself saying parts of that scrip and USING MY EMPATHY so I don't get a 0% on my imaginary QA or something.    Once I had to call student loan people or something, and I gave them Mt name and stuff, and I guess the girl got jumbled where she was out something and asked again.  As soon as it left her mouth I heard the ""oh shit""  tone when she realized her mistake.  I just gave it again, kind of figuring maybe she forgot to type it in the screen or something.  Next question : what's your current occupation?  Told her I was a csr for a call center.  ""that's why you weren't mad at me for repeating my question.""  we laughed, she was sweet.  I just try not to make people's jobs harder, like most of us here.    I hate bringing issues to employees and causing problems, but if I have to, you bet I'll do it with a smile and I'll be patient as hell.  Even if inside I'm fuming.

IDontWorkHereLady,3b24nl,Bigmada,20,Wed Jul 1 19:41:44 2015 UTC,It was pretty obvious I didn't work there. I thought me kind of walking away pretty much took care of it.  I couldn't believe the lady took at as far as she did.
IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,raccoonwhisperer,143,Wed Jun 24 07:29:43 2015 UTC,I'm still unsure as to how I looked like an employee.   Anyone can look like an employee to someone who doesn't bother to pay attention.

IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,TheOneAndOnlyLump,40,Wed Jun 24 10:53:47 2015 UTC,"I was momentarily speechless I'm afraid. I mean, a 12 hour shift and I likely smell like raccoon pee, have formula stains - which might I add look suspiciously like other nefarious stains on certain colors, and generally look like crap.   So witty retort, just gave her a look like ""you're not serious, right?"" And walked away.   I did however, in passing tell an employee that there was some weird lady looking for help. I'm sure he got her life story, as well as her first cousin three times removed story about their appendectomy."

IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,epicflyman,24,Wed Jun 24 12:55:12 2015 UTC,"Ages ago, I read a Dear Ann/Dear Abby letter from a doctor who wanted to dissuade people from bugging him for a diagnosis when he's not at the office.

Just like when I did work retail (primarily in a photo lab at a now defunct camera store chain way back when) I'd get people calling up asking ""What kind of photos do you not print?""  Complete with the heavy breathing on the other end of the line."
IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,heilspawn,19,Thu Jun 25 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"Simple: You stood out. Though not wearing anything to qualify as retail uniform, your outfit didnt match up with ""the general public"".    Plus, as always, you don't question crazy. To ensure survival on the long term, you turn around, run and don't even dare to look back."
IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,Owyn_Merrilin,19,Wed Jun 24 12:17:47 2015 UTC,"You were probably giving off retail worker vibe. I'm not sure what it is, perhaps it has something to do with not tossing products we don't want behind us as we shop, but once you've worked retail the crazies know, and they will find you like a starving dog finds a lamb chop."
IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,Astramancer_,8,Wed Jun 24 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"So true. When I pull a shirt out of a stack to see how big/small it is when shopping I always refold it to the best of my ability (looks sloppy to a retail worker I'm sure, but I tried and the sentiment is there!). This makes people think I work at the store and I get questions constantly and shitty looks when I explain I don't work there. They always say ""oh, well I saw you folding that shirt..."" In a leading way, like they're accusing me of misleading them because I tried to leave the stack looking as close to how I found it as I can. Why do you assume I work somewhere just because I'm not an animal and pick up after myself? What do your homes look like?!?!"

IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,DPNovitzky,6,Wed Jun 24 23:06:33 2015 UTC,I've never worked retail and I still get mistaken for an employee on a weekly basis. I think it has more to do with looking like you know where you're going than anything else. Now if only I could figure out how to walk with a purpose without looking like I'm walking with purpose...
IDontWorkHereLady,3axfoo,Sierra_Oscar_Lima,10,Wed Jun 24 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"Don't look forward.

IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,mike413,29,Tue Jun 23 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"dedication and loyalty   carefully chosen words.  truth is, when you have a captive audience you don't *have* to develop any sort of management style at all.  It's unfortunate because from what I can tell, some true leaders are forged in the military whose men would follow them anywhere.  I am curious how the transition of style occurs."
IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,thatnerdynerd,7,Tue Jun 23 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as well..but I assume each person is different.  Some people desire approval from their superiors, and approval from a military superior is a high honor.   Maybe other people were broken down and rebuilt up during their training and conditioned.   I have no idea.  Would be interesting to find out though."

IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,chillinatredbox,27,Tue Jun 23 23:55:42 2015 UTC,You're absolutely correct.  I know several veterans and none of them act like that guy.  All of them were easily able to go into the civilian workforce without any issues.

IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,bradenbuss,21,Wed Jun 24 02:25:28 2015 UTC,Typical for former military managers from what I've seen. When I worked in a movie rental store our district manager specifically requested that I go to another store to help train employees and get the story ship shape while the  new former military manager got caught up to everything. Well the first day I met her I knew should was a huge bitch within 10 seconds. She starts trying to order around the new employees telling them to stop doing what I had told them to do because she didn't understand what they were doing. She had a huge attitude and seemed to think she was better than  everyone. Eventually we started butting heads and I told her the district manager asked me to come here and if you don't want my help I can leave now and let your store fail. She got posses and tried to give me a write up. I called the district manager's home number and told him she was on her own and she would need to be let go in 3 months. 5 months later she was fired because she kept losing employees. Huge surprise no one wants to work for minimum wage while being treated like they're in the fucking army.
IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,MerchantofHate,5,Wed Jun 24 06:42:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, hour for hour minimum wage can be a way better deal than the military. My first couple years I was paid chicken feed. But the fact I was on a tiny ass boat in the middle of the water half the time helped me save quite a bit."
IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,mikeskiuk,7,Wed Jun 24 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"Now, that actually does sound like a retired Sergeant Major in action.  Reality can be very hard on those of us who were in the military for too long."

IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,MaraSargon,3,Wed Jun 24 10:06:29 2015 UTC,"Pop comes off the truck on a skid. On that skid, they have flats, which are like plastic versions of what you get at the coffee shop when you're ordering lots of drinks. Each flat fits about eight 2L bottles."
IDontWorkHereLady,3avq5h,lawlcrackers,3,Wed Jun 24 11:41:01 2015 UTC,"The're plastic crate type things that the drinks are stored in when they're shipped.  Like this: http://i.imgur.com/54mgogl.jpg .  These hold 8 2-liter bottles (which is considered a ""case"" of drinks, like 24 cans makes a case of beer).  Once they're empty you can stack them on top of each other and get the stacks up pretty high."

IDontWorkHereLady,3asffs,ApokalypseCow,14,Tue Jun 23 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, while the act of pulling a firearm is an escalation, unarmed aggressors often de-escalate things suddenly and dramatically when faced with a gun.  ;-)  But yeah, again, only if I felt as though I was about to be attacked, and couldn't get away to my vehicle in time."

IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,joosboxx,14,Wed Jun 17 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"I am as pasty white as any brit, but the language is a dead giveaway that I am Maltese."
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,steggun_cinargo,27,Wed Jun 17 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"Funny you should say that, because I've actually had something similar happen to me in Malta! My dad is Maltese and I was born there, moved away when I was about 7 but I've been back to see family plenty of times over the years. Other than my dark hair, I don't really look Maltese.   So last year I was at a bar/restaurant with my dad, sisters and uncle and it was my round. I went up to the bar to get drinks and then my dad and I carried them back to our table. I put the drinks down, then went to ask one of the staff where the toilets were (I asked in Maltese, because I was trying to get more confident speaking the language).   Went off to the loo, and on my way back this woman stopped me and asked for a table for two. She soon realised her mistake when I opened my mouth and spoke with an English accent, and she apologised and went on her way.   I work as a waitress so I guess I just give off that kind of vibe, even on holiday :("
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,nod23,13,Wed Jun 17 17:24:17 2015 UTC,That sounds like an honest mistake that didn't go bad.
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,steggun_cinargo,9,Thu Jun 18 00:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. We don't know what she wore, but if she was a tourist I doubt it looked very staff-like? A woman isn't automatically a waitress."
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,nod23,2,Sat Jun 20 16:07:38 2015 UTC,Where did you get the idea that I was suggesting that a women can be assumed to be a waitress?
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,steggun_cinargo,5,Sat Jun 20 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you did. I just meant that's all we know from the story?"
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,nod23,2,Sat Jun 20 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"Gotcha no worries. The reason I assumed it happened was because the poster was possibly seen speaking the local language with the barstaff, then dropping off drinks at a table she didn't immediately sit with."
IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,devention,4,Sat Jun 20 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, except that doesn't really fit with her being approached coming back from the bathroom? In my mind the bathrooms are located near the entrance where perhaps a new visitor entered the restaurant? If so there's no reason her previous interaction with staff could have been registered :)"

The way I'm picturing it might not be the way it's set up. We could both be wrong and the facilities could be nowhere near either the front door or the kitchen. (Side bar: didn't notice how old the comment I replied to was when I did so. Apologies for that. But someone didn't have the same picture as me in their head. On the Internet!

I dunno, made out of maltese rock or something. So it would be the maltese falcon instead of the marble or limestone falcon."

IDontWorkHereLady,3a56sa,theboxmx3,2,Thu Jun 18 07:49:02 2015 UTC,They do? I thought Malta was big into shipping (as an intermediate between the large super tankers and transferring cargo to smaller ships to their final destination) and pharmaceuticals. That said I do know that tourism is a decently sized industry for you guys but I thought pharma was where the money was at.

IDontWorkHereLady,39vqf4,Minifig66,3,Fri Jun 19 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"I have that one. I even added to it, ""back in the day"".  I also have contributed to the official ""Things to Know Before Joining a Scientific Spec-Ops Team"" list.  Are you familiar with that one?"
IDontWorkHereLady,39vqf4,Minifig66,2,Fri Jun 19 04:57:34 2015 UTC,I am not. Yet...
IDontWorkHereLady,39vqf4,fappyday,6,Fri Jun 19 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"A small taste:  I refuse to go into the underground research facility, deep-space research facility, deep-sea research facility, radio-blacked out colony, derelict alien ship, or abandoned ghost ship.   If forced into attempting any of the above six missions, I will go AWOL. Prison showers are almost certainly preferable to what awaits.   I will carry more than one gun and carry as many as humanly possible.   In line with above, I will carry more than one mag per gun. I have a belt, and intend to fill it.   If the hallways of the operations area are big enough to allow it, I will bring along a small field artillery piece.   No matter what my CO says, if my job is to plant a nuclear device to destroy the facility/ship, it is not necessary for me to endanger my life by traveling to the center of the structure to plant the bomb, I'm sure the entrance will prove just as effective.   If my job is to disable the AI system that runs the facility/ship, and this requires me to go to the center of the structure, I will just plant a small nuclear device at the entrance. If the blast doesn't get it, the EMP will.   If my body armor proves ineffective against whatever killed everyone in the facility/ship, I will ditch it and use the saved weight to carry more guns.   If the body armor is ineffective and so are the guns, I will ditch both and set a new track record on my way out of the ops area.   I refuse to wear any helmet that restricts my peripheral vision and does not allow me to see something rising up/dropping down right beside me.   I will request a helmet that has a small HUD linked to a camera on the back of my helmet. An additional HUD linked to a upward-pointing top mounted camera would be nice as well.   If going into some top secret facility that has lost radio communication with the outside world, I will make damn sure that I am in possession of a high quality, up to date map that will not be rendered unreadable by contact with liquid.   If I could not obtain a map, and am lost/trapped in the facility, I will not rely on the unstable, homicidal central AI to provide me with escape routes.   If I am inside a facility/ship after the stuff has hit the fan, and find myself without a map, I will head to the nearest computer terminal and consult Yahoo! Maps. The facility was built by a corporation or the government, and they can certainly afford an Internet connection.   If there is a self-destruct mechanism or impenetrable blast doors set on a running timer within the building/ship I am ordered to enter, I will guard the entrances until the timer runs out, then leave. The problem will take care of itself eventually, so there is no need to risk myself.   If mine is not the first team to be sent into the area, I will take a little time off to wonder why.   If the music suddenly gets really creepy, start spinning around with your finger on the trigger. Whoever was guarding your back is probably gone by this point anyway.   Before I go on each mission, I will rent Aliens, Resident Evil, Event Horizon, and other similar movies for pointers. I will defer the costs as ""training expenses"".   If there is something dripping from the ceiling up ahead, I won't bother to check if it's just water. I will leave the area immediately by the quickest available route.   If I hear odd noises, I will not be foolish enough to investigate it alone. I will take a friend or two with big guns.   If ordered to investigate the noise by my CO, I will take everyone else in the squad with me. By the time we return to where the CO was waiting, the problem will probably have solved itself.   If forced to walk underneath a hole in the ceiling, I will be cautious and investigate it thoroughly with high explosives.   If I hear odd noises coming from the ceiling, I will not lift up a panel and stick my head up to have a look around. I will lift up the panel and shove a grenade up there.   Similarly, if forced to pass a hole/grate in the walls or floor, I will throw a grenade in to make sure its clear now, and set proximity mines to make sure it is clear later.   Unless it is my last chance for survival, I will never go into any type of ventilation shaft. I know that whatever chased me up there will almost certainly be able to move faster than me in an enclosed space."

Instead, we pretend to do so and let them have first crack at the booby-traps/monsters/aliens, then beat the crap out of them and take the prize when the survivors stagger back out. If there are no survivors, and we still have to go in, then at least the majority of the booby-traps will have already been tripped, and the monsters/aliens/creatures will have been recently well-fed."

IDontWorkHereLady,39jtfo,Bunnyhat,6,Sun Jun 14 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"But it is true. All chemical reactions, in some sense, give off light and heat. Therefore, all living things are technically bioluminescent."
IDontWorkHereLady,39jtfo,Sasparillafizz,-7,Sun Jun 14 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, one, not all chemical reactions give off either light or heat - many reactions are endothermic, and actually absorb rather than evolve heat. For instance, the reaction (actually a phase change) that cools an instant ice pack. Relatively few chemical reactions emit any light at all.  Secondly bioluminescence is a specific phenomenon involving specific biochemical pathways; it's not just a chemical reaction being exothermic. No, not all living things are ""technically bioluminescent."""

This is one study with a pretty tenuous design, no controls, a bogus proposed mechanism, and a definition of ""glow"" so broad as to be meaningless. The air warmed by your body is emitting more photons than the effect proposed by this crank.  I appreciate that you're looking for some new-age coolness to wow children with, but what's wrong with ""we're all made of starstuff""? Always worked on me.

IDontWorkHereLady,38vnjy,short_fat_and_single,-10,Sun Jun 7 07:53:13 2015 UTC,No. What you are describing is battery.
IDontWorkHereLady,38vnjy,tardisrider613,9,Sun Jun 7 08:07:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah in Australia (where OP has said she is from) assault is considered to be the threat of physical harm, or any physical contact without consent. So if he had said he was going to harm her, or touched her in any way, even a light poke, that would've been able to be deemed assault. So I guess by grabbing her arm he did assault her, making you somewhat correct that she could've flipped shit and gone nuts at him. However us Aussies don't need to resort straight to physical violence, usually a loud ""ahh get fucked ya shit cunt"" does the trick just fine.   Edit: words"

IDontWorkHereLady,38vnjy,AdmiralCheesecake,7,Mon Jun 29 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"Because where I live, ""Sir"" in a certain tone is the equivalent of ""You moronic cunt"" in other places."

I'm in the southern U.S. and 'sir'/'ma'am' are drilled into our heads from birth as polite public-conversational necessities.   o-o   It would be hard to try not to say it...  At any rate, getting all grabby for food like that is disgustingly rude. -_-"
IDontWorkHereLady,38vnjy,AdmiralCheesecake,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"Where I live it's far more common, and usually considered more polite to address people formally as Mr/Mrs/Miss/Dr/(desired pronoun) (Last Name). My teachers at school were *Mr Math, *Mrs English, *Dr Scientist, etc.   ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"" can actually be considered rude even in a formal setting if you're at all familiar with the person, like you didn't go to the effort of learning their name. It's very rare that you'll find anyone who you interact with regularly would rather be addressed as ""Sir"", and that person is generally either a total ponce, or has actually been knighted.   It can definitely have polite connotations here too, but maybe isn't as drilled into kids here as it is in other places. We use it politely only when we are completely unfamiliar with the person. ""Sir"" is more common than ""Ma'am"", which is usually replaced with ""Miss/Mrs/Ms"". Whether or not it's polite is entirely to do with the tone and context.   If I politely thank a bus driver as I exit the bus ""Thank you Sir"", have a nice day."". If I answer the phone in my nicest phone-tone ""Good afternoon ma'am, you have reached X company/residence, how may I help you?"". If I want to politely approach a stranger in public ""Excuse me Ms, I think you just dropped something."" It's just, not a super common thing.   However, when someone bumps into me and knocks me over without apology and I practically growl at them ""Sorry sir, didn't mean to get in your way."", it has the same meaning as ""Watch where you're walking, dumbass!"", maybe even ruder, but the guy can't instantly turn around and say I called him X name and get mad about that.   Conversely, it's quite common for us to address our close friends with insults. You know you're close with someone if they regularly call you ""cunt"", ""fat-arse"", or ""moron"". Even (though I don't personally approve of it) homophobic or racist slurs can be used affectionately between old friends. My extended family all refer to each other affectionately as ""jobbies"", a slang term for crusty shit stuck behind the tail of a sheep. Even with our pets and stuff ""Oh she's such a stupid, fat dog!"" (I love her with all my heart, precious angel puppy).   That's not to say you wouldn't swear at someone in anger, just that it's entirely about context and tone here. In this particular context, I was clearly angry, practically snarling my words, but was in a crowded restaurant surrounded by small children and witnesses, and if I started going off at that guy, yelling every insult in the book, I'd be in as much shit as he was. In this context, ""Sir"" was the perfect insult. Technically considered a polite term, in this context it was equivalent to me calling him a greedy, self-important prick with all the brains of a cane toad.   Think about it as sarcasm, because I suppose to a degree that's what it is. Australians are the masters of context, and of making whatever they want come across, regardless of the words actually spoken.   Think of it, as the short version of me saying ""Oh, I'm terribly sorry about that sir. Is there anything else I can do for you? Shine your shoes? Wipe your arse? Find a nice boot to stick in your face? I'm not your fucking slave, fuck off!""   *Not the names of actual teachers, at least not those who taught me."

Now throw in the fact that people can be manipulated into doing pretty much anything, put a gun to their head they'll pull the trigger against someone elses for one extreme example.

Now I'm in NC and I went with some friends and they were going on about how amazing it was (After being skeptical about going because it's 'lame'). And I was just, ""It's okay."" It was still pretty nice, but I think I was spoiled with the PA faire being my first.   I found a really cute one in SC that I want to hit up this year. Part of me wants to go to some local parks down there in my costume to hand out fliers/cards to promote it, but idk how weird that would be since I don't work for the faire itself. :P  -im weird im sorry-"
IDontWorkHereLady,36wwyt,aab720,2,Sat May 23 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, not weird!  Love Tartanic - they perform the night music (caeli) which helps draw the people away from the fireworks (""At 7:00 of the clock this very night, fairies will explode for your delight"").  If you ever get this way, my 'section' is in front the Globe theatre, we have 8 foot tall puppets that walk around - basically there for people to take pictures with us.  We get ALOT of abuse (but I have a Shepard's crook - I don't take much crap)."
IDontWorkHereLady,36wwyt,unkillable94,2,Sat May 23 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Oh man. If I do make it, it won't be for another few years, sadly.   I had found Tartanic while just derping around youtube one day. I wasn't looking for anything in particular, just clicking related links while finding cool music. I loved their sound right away. I didn't even know they were a renn faire band. I downloaded some of their stuff, threw it on my ipod, and went on my happy way. This was...two, three weeks before I went to the PA faire? I didn't care much for specific performers. I went more to interact with people than the music. I never was a concert kind of person. I love music, but watching it? Maybe it's that I grew up in theater. When I go to a show. I was to sit and watch. I don't get hyped, I don't dance. I'm really boring, so I just avoid shows.   But I heard a song they wer eplaying from down the way and just froze. ""I KNOW THIS BAND."" I grabbed my sister's hand. She was confused. ""This is Tartanic. I don't kno whow I know. I JUST KNOW."" It was only a few notes I recognized. Hoenstly, it could have been any band with bagpipes. But I just got this feeling. I was so excited when I was right.   When I talked to them after (omg they are so fucking nice), they were ONLY playing that weekend. The next year? Same thing. I just happened to go on the weekend they were playing. And then the next year. It was crazy. I can never find the listing for the music on the webpage, so it's always just bene lucky. Last year I went a few times, so it was no shock when I ended up seeing them. Oh gosh, they are such hams. I had videos of my sister and two friends dancing on stage with them, but I don't think it was every uploaded and my phone they were on took a giant shit on me late last summer.   I need to find out if they'll be at the NC renn fest or not. I'll plan to go around to see them again. Other than the Drabbit booth, they're the number one thing I go to see. (I'm 90% sure I was told they have a drabbit booth in TX so I reall yhope you know what I""m talking about lmao)"
IDontWorkHereLady,36wwyt,MouseMistro,1 point,Sat May 23 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked them (and yea, they are fun to hang with).  Since you like them, may I suggest The Scottish Rogues?  They have been around a bit longer, but most of the original members have switched out.  They play a lot of original music.  Also, there is an Austin band that plays Scottish rock - NeedFire.  They have a couple of electric guitars, a fiddle and a bagpipe - awesome music."
IDontWorkHereLady,36wwyt,devention,1 point,Sat May 23 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"I've heard of the Scottish Rogues before, but I can't recall their sound, jus the name. I'll look up both bands, though! I could always use some more 'Renn Faire-ey' music on my playlists. I was working on something for the faire the other day and put on some Tartanic. I got so pumped. So great.   I've started hoop dancing, and would love to incorperate it with my costume for the faire. I'm not sure how well that will work. I really need to throw the costume onand see if it's still possible to even move around in it, but I'd love to be comfortable enough to hoop to some renn faire music this year. I really want to come out of that shy shell that i mentioned in my last post who just doesn't get into music like other people. Even alone in my garage I'm shy as heck, and I'm probably the whitest dancer ever. I love coreography but freestyle? Fuck man. Fuck.   The more music to pump me up though, the better. And let me tell you, Tartanic was PERFECT to hoop to.   Thanks again for the music suggestions! I can't listen right now. No headphones and the boyfriend is asleep. But once I get my headphones I'm going to listen the heck out of these bands. :)"

IDontWorkHereLady,36kikj,evilbrent,25,Wed May 20 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"My advice: calm down. I know it's super easy to get nervous and flustered when going for a job, and ""trying"" to be confident and collected is going to leave you in the opposite mental state. Believe me, I know.  But all the jobs I've ever won it's all just..... worked. It falls into place. It's effortless, like the whole interview process isn't you trying to trick them into believing you're who they're after, but rather letting them know. Confirming. From the moment you walk in, to the moment they shake your hand and say ""See you on Monday"" it's all just... paperwork and ticking the boxes.  I promise this is helpful advice.  What I'm trying to say has got two parts to it. Firstly - if you're flustered and feel like you blew it, don't sweat it. That one wasn't meant to be. That one was practice. That one probably had you flustered or outside of yourself for good reason. Secondly, I find that thinking about it like that helps to calm me down: if it's meant to be it'll happen, so let it happen. That lets you be honest and open about yourself and it lets you talk maturely and happily to the people doing the hiring - these people are not scary job-withholding demons that you have to appease by runing the gauntlet of saying the right eighty five things in a row that let you unlock Achievement Job, they're your colleagues and supervisors that you'll be working with in a few days' time.  I have twice been made redundant from my engineering job, and twice been in the position of job-hunting in the last days of our life's savings, where my failure to land a job meant each time that we had to sell the family home. I'd finish a job interview and go back to my car to cry for a while, except I didn't have that luxury because I had another two interviews to get to that day. Trust me, I KNOW what it's like to be under pressure looking for work.  The day I went for the interview for the job I have now I had an interview in the morning on the other side of the city. I'd driven from home, 300km away in a country town, and had a couple of hours to kill in the middle of the hot day before the last of three interviews that day, so I went to a shopping centre and walked around to stay out of the heat. My car didn't have remote central locking, so you can imagine my unpleasant surprise when I decided that it was time to start heading off to the next interview and saw my keys on the driver's seat of my locked car.  My wife was at home with two small kids all by herself coping with packing up our possessions so we could take them to storage.  There was no money in our bank account - no more job opportunities on the horizon, just the interviews I had that day, and a locked car on a hot day.  I ended up magically finding the company number using my little Android 1.5 telephone, calling and explaining, then calling the RACV to come unlock my car for $70. The company was very understanding of my situation, the interview went great, and I was working for them almost immediately.  What I'm trying to say with all this is that I don't think I'd have been able to even form a coherent sentence in that interview if I hadn't had a ""whatever is happening is what is happening"" attitude about it. In my head, obviously, I did every last fucking thing I could to make sure that I gave myself the best chance possible, but in the end it was my calmness and ability to put myself outside of my life-situation and just be present for the interview while I was there that landed me the job.  Anyway. That's my unwarranted advice. Don't sweat it when you fluff a job application. It's a percentages game. Put enough of the right applications in and one of them will just work perfectly. When you get a job it'll just make sense."
IDontWorkHereLady,36kikj,SquiddyTheMouse,7,Wed May 20 07:53:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouraging words! I'm crossing my fingers and hoping for the best. However, I'm mostly just hoping that my printer doesn't run out of ink before I find a job haha."
IDontWorkHereLady,36kikj,evilbrent,3,Wed May 20 09:05:13 2015 UTC,"I know that we're in completely different situations, but I've been applying for jobs for 2 years now, and I've had 3 interviews. In one, it was set up by the job search agency that I was with at the time, so I had no contact details for the place I was interviewed for. I was literally told that I am perfect for the job, and that he'd speak to the other owners and call me in a few days to discuss my hours, so it was heavily implied that I had the job, but a few days came and went. Then a week. I called the job search agency. They said to wait a bit longer. Then a month. I called them again, they told me to wait. Two more months, and three more phone calls, and I was finally told that they had decided against employing anyone. They had my phone number, and they could have let me know, but they did not. The fucking left me hanging for three months after practically telling me that I had the job. The job search agency did not call me about it. I had to call them five times to finally be told that I did not get the job.  I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I've had people look at my resume, and they didn't tell me to change anything.  I've done an employment course, where they teach you how to write a resume and cover letter, and I still can't get a job.  It's been two years, and the best response I've received has been countless emails all saying that they've had a lot of very high quality applications, and mine did not make the shortlist. I suppose that's a kind way of saying that my application wasn't worth shit to anyone."
IDontWorkHereLady,36kikj,SquiddyTheMouse,6,Wed May 20 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know what to say, but ""don't count unhatched chickens."" There are so many stages of the hiring process where it can all fall apart. That sucks.  When I was job hunting I had literally five months of radio silence then seven interviews in one week. It was mind blowing - going from complete despair to almost having too many opportunities, but not wanting my desperation to be too obvious.   All I can say is that it's clear that your resume isn't valued by THOSE employers. You may very well tick all the boxes for skills experience attitudes aptitude potential etc etc etc, don't go thinking that you didn't get those jobs entirely because of some defect in you.   You can do those jobs. Of course you can. They're just jobs. Probably in reality just about anyone with the right background could give them a go. They just weren't right for you.  My advice is to use your networking. Physically go to the company you want to work for and ask to speak to the person who does the hiring. Whenever you send an application make sure that you call to check they got it, any excuse to put a voice to the resume.  Remember that you probably have a perfectly good resume in a pile of forty perfectly good resumes. Do what you can to separate yourself from those other thirty nine. Be yourself, not a number.... Bah, I dunno if I even have a point sorry. I'm rambling.  Sorry to hear about your problem. I hope you have luck with it."
IDontWorkHereLady,36kikj,Mitch_Mitcherson,3,Wed May 20 13:42:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for this reply. I'm sure I'll get a job eventually :)
IDontWorkHereLady,36kikj,SquiddyTheMouse,1 point,Fri May 22 08:40:31 2015 UTC,"Being persistent is the key. Call once or twice a day to whomever is doing the hiring and ask about the position. After an interview, always call and send an email thanking the interviewer for their time. Always ask for a business card, and bring extra copies of your resume with you. Ask at least three questions about the position, don't ask about benefits or money. And always go in with a great attitude and a firm handshake."

IDontWorkHereLady,36et4z,spearchuckin,3,Tue May 19 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"I guess all brick & mortar stores are in a decline recently. I'm glad I got out before it got really bad.  But stocks don't always tell the whole story. Stocks plummet because there is less profit in a year. That's not necessarily because sales dropped, but could be because of a takeover. But most shareholders don't see that, they see their payout take a dive and thus sell their stock...  not saying that's with a&f, couldnt care less about them to be honest ;)"
IDontWorkHereLady,36et4z,da_kink,2,Tue May 19 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"It's definitely the sales plummeting. Teens and young adults are going to cheaper priced fast fashion retailers these days.

IDontWorkHereLady,36ermw,SpastixFantastix,12,Mon May 18 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"My brother worked at a local grocery store for several years, starting in high school.  My good friend's mother used to shop there all the time, often bringing my friend's 6 year old son.  Now, when this kid was a baby, my family frequently babysat him.  But the last time he had been around, he was probably 3 or 4.  My brother thought it was funny that ""Johnny"" only knew him from the store.  So one day I decided to pop by and visit my friend's mom.  I brought my brother with me.  As we got out of the car in the driveway, Johnny came round to see who it was.  His face lit up and he ran to thee house, yelling excitedly, ""Grandma!  The man from [Grocery Store] is here!  The man from [Grocery store]!""  For a while after that, I would teasingly call my brother ""Man from [Grocery Store]."""

IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,BadgerTwo,54,Tue May 12 05:32:12 2015 UTC,"See, i've read this quite a lot here, where the, often rude, customer says that the OP does work there, and they'll have the manager fire them for 'not doing their job'. What i don't understand is, why don't people just say ""Go ahead"".  I suppose it is to spare the manager the trouble. But if the customer is very screamish, which they tend to be in these stories, the manager should most definitely show up anyways."
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,toast888,30,Tue May 12 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"I was a bit too stunned to say much, and also the grocer I work at prides itself on customer service, and nice employees in general"
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,NeonDisease,12,Tue May 12 02:13:13 2015 UTC,If anybody screams at me for any reason I'm going to tell them to fuck themselves at a competitive volume.
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,inthrees,35,Tue May 12 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"I work at that store and can confirm, people are crazy. This morning some wacko called right after we opened screaming- literally screaming into the phone about how dare we ignore him because he's being trying to call all morning. Are we a business or not?! Blah blah blah. The only way our phones work before open is to direct dial an extension. Otherwise it's just an announcement about how were closed."
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,ceilte,32,Tue May 12 06:20:58 2015 UTC,I think there comes a point where you just might as well say you went into Best Buy.

IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,metastasis_d,12,Tue May 12 14:31:13 2015 UTC,She left after a bit. Manager apologized and asked if I needed help. I didn't.
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,inthrees,33,Tue May 12 20:13:52 2015 UTC,"Look people. If someone mistakes you for an employee and they're not rude right off the bat (kind of like this lady was) then be nice.  If they persist, and especially if they are rude about it or to you, be firm and assertive.   And if they are batshit crazy, all bets are off and this is your magical lucky break - you just won the stress-release-go-off-on-someone-who-deserves it lottery. And should feel free to go off on them.  Like maybe loudly yelling ""I JUST !@#$ TOLD YOU I DON'T !@#$ WORK HERE, NOW STOP HARRASSING ME YOU !@#$. I'M TRYING TO SHOP.""  I believe in being incredibly polite to everyone. Bank tellers, cashiers in any store, waitstaff, family, bosses, coworkers, etc. But I don't believe in being a doormat, especially to strangers."
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,chocobunny85,20,Tue May 12 08:41:13 2015 UTC,"The problem with going off on them and you happen to be wearing a work uniform is that if they find out where you work and complain there, it's still possible you could be written up or terminated for poorly representing your company. (US perspective, at least)  If you work a non-retail job or are reasonably sure that your own management isn't going to care how you act off hours, though, go right ahead and do that."
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,inthrees,12,Tue May 12 12:10:43 2015 UTC,"They would also have to get your name, so if it's not on a nametag or lanyard or something, you're anonymous.  And that is a reasonable fear in the US, where 'right to work' means 'right to fire'. So be cautious. But don't be a doormat!"
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,heldonhammer,7,Tue May 12 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"""Right to work"" has to do with whether you can be forced to join a union as a hiring condition. You're thinking of ""at-will employment."""
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,adudeguyman,6,Tue May 12 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"I meant states that are considered 'right to work' usually have no or few worker protections which effectively renders them right to fire. (Or at-will, yes.)  It's never just ""oh, and you can't require union membership or force workers to pay dues."" It is invariably ""humans become interchangeable replaceable and discard-able cogs that we don't have to treat with basic dignity or fairness."""
IDontWorkHereLady,35my4z,adudeguyman,1 point,Tue May 12 18:32:37 2015 UTC,This is why I never wear my uniform anywhere but work. It's not worth it.

IDontWorkHereLady,35meb6,Ashleylulz,14,Tue May 12 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Man, the lunchbreak disturbers.  When I was a kid I got a summer job filing in a council office. There was no break room or anywhere to eat lunch, and nowhere nearby if the weather was bad, so I'd have to eat at my desk. People would constantly come ask me for things when I was very clearly half way through a sandwich, then have the audacity to get pissy when I told them I was on lunch and not available to help them right now. In the end I'd just put up a sign saying 'I am on my lunch break. Please return later'. People would literally stand in front of my desk and look awkwardly at me and the sign and decide whether to disturb me or not. After a while they learned that it was a bad idea, but I'd still get a few people who thought their inability to go find their own fucking file was important enough to disturb my meager half hour break."
IDontWorkHereLady,35meb6,pfafulous,10,Tue May 12 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a bad employee, but my break time is mine. Unless it's something that only I know or can do (which is never). Otherwise, I'll deal with it when I'm getting paid to deal with it."

Couldn't really consider them as breaks as we had to serve customers all the way through it. I've been mistaken for staff in other shops whilst I've been buying food for my break but until now never have I been harassed whilst I'm not even in a store and got a jacket on."
IDontWorkHereLady,35meb6,Chanteclairix,29,Tue May 12 17:47:02 2015 UTC,I'm pregnant (37 weeks 2 days) and I can't climb into the tall as hell chairs in the break room at my job so I eat in the lobby.

IDontWorkHereLady,35meb6,henrysmith78730,6,Mon May 11 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"I work in downtown. We had an outdoor festival this past weekend. For whatever reason our building and our retail space, we share a bathroom with a Starbucks. It's an employee only bathroom, because it's nice and clean, and it's going to stay that way. Plus Starbucks has like 7 people on staff and we have 2-3 at most. Anyway we, and Starbucks have huge signs on our door that express that we don't have a public bathroom. Normally it's not a big deal to let a customer use it. And because we're not monsters (and I have a medical condition that requires bathroom access at a moments notice, it sucks a lot trust me) we made sure there were porta-potties like 15 feet from our door. If someone asks we point them there.   It is immensely satisfying to see that there are plenty of open porta-potties, telling people who want to use our restroom to use them, and watching them get all bent outta shape because they're too good to use a porta-potty. There are also really nice public bathrooms about 30 yards away with fairly noticeable signage. In short there are plenty of bathrooms to use. They just don't want to use a public bathroom. It's quite nice. I will let our customers use the restroom even then because they're customers and despite breaking the one serious rule we have, I'm trying to be really nice."
IDontWorkHereLady,35meb6,OldGuy37,3,Tue May 12 16:02:20 2015 UTC,That's the thing that makes me most angry. When they aren't even customers. Sometimes they want me to give them a rundown of why the doors are locked. Well gees methhead who isn't buying anything I wonder.

We grew up in a time when the operating manual for something didn't weight more than item and was less than 200 pages.  It was written is a language the we mostly could understand and didn't have one switch that didn't do 15+ separate functions.

I thought it was weird because really, who wants to work while on vacation, but I put her to work! She bussed tables, ran the dishwasher and prepped food the entire time her family was eating and really helped us out.

IDontWorkHereLady,35ifdz,duck_of_d34th,3,Tue Jun 23 16:49:17 2015 UTC,I'd imagine if the owners watched that on CCTV out of context the reaction would be pretty funny.

IDontWorkHereLady,35imto,TheRealMeatloaf,39,Sun May 10 19:12:12 2015 UTC,Call Center? How many companies are involved with a single order?
IDontWorkHereLady,35imto,pfafulous,27,Mon May 11 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"Big national pizza chain, millions of orders per month."
IDontWorkHereLady,35imto,pfafulous,14,Mon May 11 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"Ah.  I didn't realize they used call centres. Probably for online orders, I guess?"
IDontWorkHereLady,35imto,pfafulous,20,Mon May 11 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"No, pretty much every big chain pizza store uses call centers for all their orders. It's rare that you speak to anyone in the local stores, they usually just send the orders by computer.  Same for big fried chicken, too. They have printers connected to a network (either the Internet or a dial up or similar) that spit out orders all night."
IDontWorkHereLady,35imto,chrisbcaldwell,8,Mon May 11 19:03:59 2015 UTC,Interesting. Been decades since I ordered from one of those places.
IDontWorkHereLady,35imto,phoenix0784,22,Mon May 11 19:04:36 2015 UTC,Typical Big Pizza.

IDontWorkHereLady,35io34,semibacony,16,Sun May 10 21:13:49 2015 UTC,It means a shit ton in retail.
IDontWorkHereLady,35io34,DasBarenJager,30,Mon May 11 21:53:29 2015 UTC,I really don't like strangers handing me things so if someone caught me off guard like that while trying to push a bunch of items into my arms I imagine it would all end up on the ground while I loudly told them to get away from me.   I think you handled it better than I would have.
IDontWorkHereLady,35io34,DasBarenJager,15,Mon May 11 06:26:59 2015 UTC,I think I've gotten to point where when out of store I tend to freeze up and get really jittery and don't know what to say to people.
IDontWorkHereLady,35io34,semibacony,10,Mon May 11 06:41:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have any problems with social interactions but someone trying to force me take accept something they are handing me has just always seemed like such an invasion of my personal space. Probably just me being weird but I hate it, I end up not knowing what to say either and tend to make things worse."
IDontWorkHereLady,35io34,curiouswizard,7,Mon May 11 06:43:44 2015 UTC,Incredible invasion of personal space!
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,SilentInsulin,130,Sun May 10 16:54:57 2015 UTC,You should have waited for her to come back with the manager. Just so you could laugh in her face when the manager confirmed you didn't work there.
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,Basser151,32,Sun May 10 16:59:24 2015 UTC,"If the store is big enough, while she leaves go get another manager  and complain that she is being a rude employee and confront her too.  ""Umm... neither of you work here.""  ""What's wrong with you people?"""

IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,Basser151,46,Sun May 10 17:06:45 2015 UTC,That's cool. If and when that happens to me again. I will do it for the both of us.

IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,OcotilloWells,19,Sun May 10 17:20:10 2015 UTC,Oh man imagine her coming back with the manager to shit talk about an employee that never existed.
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,lookuppage7,20,Sun May 10 22:05:12 2015 UTC,If it weren't for the fact I was completely mortified about the whole situation I would have loved to see her reaction when she was informed I did not in fact work in that establishment.
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,YukiHyou,3,Sun May 10 23:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing your shirt or nametag had your store's name and/or logo on it. While I'm with the rest as far as giving back a little of her rudeness, was probably for the best. Besides even if she had got the manager she would have somehow twisted it her way anyhow, barring being so rude to the manager that she still gets barred from returning to the store."
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,lookuppage7,6,Mon May 11 04:25:53 2015 UTC,Don't forget to point and #cackle at her face when the manager says it.
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,Astramancer_,5,Sun May 10 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"Read that as ""hashcackle"" and wondered what kind of brownies that would be."

IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,whatnobodyknew,9,Sun May 10 19:14:50 2015 UTC,"My response would probably be ""great, let's go look. I've always wanted to see a manager""."
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,cheesesnax,2,Mon May 11 17:09:20 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking as I read it. I may be a little more blunt than most people though.
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,Kitnene,2,Tue Jun 30 20:00:01 2015 UTC,Yeah.  I hate rude people.
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,newretiree,22,Tue Jun 30 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"Something that amazes me about the I Don't Work Here, Lady stories: the customers' reactions lead me to believe that they have been in other situations where real employees have lied about their employment status. That in turn makes me think that these customers are horrible on enough occasions  that they are being lied to on a regular basis. Perhaps that all goes without saying but it just struck me."
IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,BNLboy,5,Mon May 11 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, I did this to a customer because despite being decorated with the company logo and could plainly could see my name tag; she still asked if I worked there."

IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,curiouswizard,16,Mon May 11 00:59:59 2015 UTC,I hope the manager doesn't just get angry at someone who fits your description since you left.

IDontWorkHereLady,35i6zi,IamIrene,13,Sun May 10 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that a great way to get under the skin of these types of people (the ones that accuse you of lying) without being rude yourself is to just continue on with your shopping and completely ignore them while they try to berate you. Headphones would probably work best for this, and would best get across the idea of ""I'm ignoring you on purpose now."" It really seems to completely throw their center-of-the-world-because-I'm-a-customer attitude in their face.  I've done this once, and they just about went apoplectic trying to shout over the headphones and refused service from anyone but me."

IDontWorkHereLady,35fbll,NeonDisease,28,Sun May 10 02:47:51 2015 UTC,"In fairness, I was in a store today and one of the workers was floating around on rollerskates and only had a company shirt on (I think it was anyway) - rest of the clothes were clearly her own.  I literally only knew she worked there when my mum went to try something on and she happened to be manning the changing rooms.  There's no excuse for the behaviour of course.  Just kind of making the point that it's not always visible who works places."
IDontWorkHereLady,35fbll,delrio_gw,19,Sat May 9 22:50:56 2015 UTC,I know the store chain (and exact location) being talked about here. The uniform they have means that anyone wearing something other than pure black is likely not working in the store. Plus headphones are a huge giveaway.

You just need two people, one attacks the ""innocent"" victim, who is visibly freaked out, the ""attacker"" faces no consequences beyond being escorted out because no one actually got hurt and the managers don't want any trouble, and the pair then makes off with however much the shop gives the victim as compensation for the trauma experienced on their premises.  Not saying at all that this is what hapened here, but I bet people have already tried this."

In summary, for anyone else lost (took me 3 rereads and going over a few bits twice)  HG and Tom are one in the same. OP took it upon himself to change the character's name once it becomes known to him, midstream.  HG/Tom is apparently another worker at the shop, not a customer.  HG/Tom mistook OP for a newhire since he was in a bay 'working'  nice story. But, that's not how to tell it."

I've finally broken the"" make eye contact and smile"" habit, but old ladies can still sense it. I've been asked by friends and my wife why people are always asking me to help them find things at the grocery stores, which I don't mind doing, but the customer service vibe is something you don't get rid of easily."
IDontWorkHereLady,35eu3o,cold08,3,Sun May 10 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Weird I guess I wasn't working retail for long enough. Never get asked for assistance, not complaining"
IDontWorkHereLady,35eu3o,Atomic_Communist,3,Mon May 11 03:42:46 2015 UTC,"I went from retail to working jobs that have me dressing casual.  Casual = dressing like retail (Khakis and polo shirts).  I've been asked so many times at grocery stores for help.  ""Sorry.. I don't work here"" is usually the end of it most of the time.  One time a little old lady was looking for something.  Because I go to that grocery store for lunch all the time and shop it often, I know the store (too well).  I dunno what it was but I was feeling nice and walked with her - she said ""Thank you!  What's your name so I can speak to your manager"".  I replied with the usual.. ""I.. don't .. work here.  Was just offering help"".  She actually tried to give me money and I told her it's not needed - to pass it on.  I'm a firm believer that it's more embarrassing for the person asking than the person being asked.  I think about all the times I was asked ""Do you work here?"" when I worked retail - have the ""uniform"" and name badge.  Most of the time walking around with a clipboard.  ""Nay bro - just hanging out planning my list for Santa"""

IDontWorkHereLady,35aizt,wishforagiraffe,13,Fri May 8 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"I think the ""I don't work here, Lady!"" premise works just as well backwards, and is in theme with the sub as a whole.   After all, not often you get ""I do effing work here, Lady! Christ, let me do my damn job!"" stories and they wouldn't need its own sub, so this place is perfect for it, really."

IDontWorkHereLady,35aizt,TotesMessenger,4,Fri May 8 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"Don't be shaken up.  I know it's almost a natural response but don't let a customer do that to you.  I will put on my retail smile and attitude for every customer that walks into my store but I have a zero tolerance policy for bullshit.  The second a customer starts disrespecting me, I put an end to it immediately.  We are all human beings and we don't deserve to be treated like that for no reason.  I have straight up told a customer that if they don't start talking to me in a respectful manner, then I'm walking away.  Needless to say, I ended up walking away.  No manager, if they're a good manager, would be mad at you for sticking up for yourself."

She was first worshiped in Ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis.

As a personal medical accommodation, I am allowed to wear my black polo all of the time. I have been accused of working EVERYWHERE.   Just today, I was at a grocery store called Gigantor with green polos and got asked about bakery items. I politely told them I actually worked for Nerd Patrol, and pointed to the logo on my polo. And the weirdest thing happened... the guy didn't argue with me or call me a liar. He legit said, ""WOW, A GIRL NERD! REALLY?!""   I was so surprised. I honestly never expected to hear that outside of my place of work. And even then it's usually from older gentlemen who mean it as a compliment, if a tad misguided. Where I'm from it's not so strange,  but it is a bit of a sausage fest to work in tech around here. (Not worth complaining about if their heart's in the right place.) But more than the words, the volume at which he said it was so impressive!   But when I'm off the clock my sarcasm levels are over 9000, and without thinking, I grabbed my boobs and with great shock looked down at myself and yelled back, ""OH MY GOD! I'M A WOMAN?! BUT HOW?!""   People are weird. I'm probably worse. ."

Deer in headlights look and all. He did not give me the opportunity to ask if he meant nothing wrong with being a ""girl nerd,"" or if he meant nothing wrong with randomly turning into a girl nerd. Then he looked at his phone, and in clear view just swiped his thumb back and forth over nothing, and scuttled away.   I took a moment to recover and then bought an apple turnover, because hell yes, and went home.   As an aside, when I hung out in the tech department of my college, there were about as many women as men. I guess I just kinda thought it was that way everywhere back then.

I told him I'm a dominatrix and from here on out, he will call me ""Mistress"" and do exactly as I say, when I say it, and respond ONLY with ""Yes, Mistress"" or ""No, Mistress"".   I ran across a submissive apparently, because he complied.   In the monitoring office, I saw the manager in tears laughing.

IDontWorkHereLady,33k8hb,silvernarnia,75,Thu Apr 23 05:40:58 2015 UTC,"At my old job, Masonry Retail, we dealt with customers who got deliveries to county X, where the tax was different.  If they had a job account setup with us (very easy to do) then we could sell all product for that job to that county.  However, if you had no specific job account setup, or had no account with us a tall, we were required, by law, to give you the tax rate at the county we sold you the product (the county of the store, for pickups.)  But because we were in the county with the highest tax rate people didn't like this.  On a $5,000 truckload a few percentage difference is a significant amount of money, so I totally understand them wanting the proper tax rate.  However, you are taxed for goods and services in the county you receive the goods.  Should you use consumable products in another county you can file for a tax refund (or a tax increase, if it's higher) for the difference when you do your taxes.  (Unless you had a verified job account setup.)  Customers asking me to give them a different tax rate is asking me to break the law.  No amount of ""You are asking me to break the law,"" and ""I'm sorry, I will not break the law for you,"" made these people understand.  It got so bad I eventually found the specific tax code, downloaded the PDF, and always kept one hard-copy printed out and highlighted the relevant sections under the counter.  This way I could literally hand the customer the tax code and say ""Sorry, I cannot do this, here's proof.""  tl;dr- It took me literally shoving the tax code in front of people for them to realize they were asking me to break the law."

The theory should stand though.)  Let's say the IRS audits you about every five to seven years as a large company.  You find that not filing for an increase would save you $1 million per year. If the penalty is $1 million per year, then you at worst break even, laugh it off, hold a ""we're sorry"" press conference, and fire the poor sucker accountant who was just following what his boss's boss's boss told him to do.  If your risk outweighs the benefit, you don't do it, otherwise, you get to play with that extra million-a-year in your operating budget."

The IRS takes Corporate Tax accounting very seriously.  Especially if you handle consumer data, the IRS and the FTC will press you hard if they thing something is out of whack.  From a pure risk standpoint, its better to file correctly and report correctly than hoping no one in the IRS notices.

The reason being that should we, say, lift something and hurt ourselves, our company's liability wouldn't cover it and the store would be responsible, and they'd probably cut our contract over it.   I imagine he had some sort of super on-site. But even if there wasn't, I know I wouldn't risk my job for some crotchety old housewife.

I've got to do SOMETHING. Because this sucks.""  Around that time, I picked up a book I'd read sort of casually once before, 'Dharma Punx' by Noah Levine. I liked his ideas so much, I picked up his second book, 'Heart of the Revolution' and started meditating.

My only other real choice is WalMart and I avoid that place like the freaking plague.  I actually really like the Big Box Craft Store because I can always find what I need and the prices are half decent. I mean, yes, I would LOVE for my smallish town to open up a yarn store but given that all they seem to want to attract is 84,000 places to eat and very little other forms of retail business (I wish I were kidding) I don't think it's ever going to happen."

It's about two people of different species(Marko and Alana), their hybrid child, Hazel, and all the drama that comes with it all. Including a ghost babysitter, a wood ship, Monarchist robots with their own civil war flaring up, male -and- female nudity(Full frontal in some cases), blood, gore, and giving birth being described as ""It feels like I'm shitting"".

Lines like that, while being hilarious, feel so natural for the characters to say.  Really, REALLY good book. If you like Vaughn's writing there, you might also like Y: The Last Man. It's about Yorick, who is the last man on Earth due to a.. Disease, I think? It's never exactly completely spelled out, as he tries for find his girlfriend/fiance, while escorted by a government agent, and a scientist.  Another one really big on the drama factor, has some great lines, some good action, some real tension, and kind of a happy/heartbreak of an ending."
IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,tw04,6,Sat Apr 11 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"Oh hey my friend recommended that to me as well! I didn't know it was by the same writer! I'll definitely have to check that out then.  Since it's a completed series, do you know of any place where I could get all the trade paperbacks in a bundle for a discount or something?"
IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,Helenarth,6,Sat Apr 11 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no. I haven't seen any places doing big bundles recently. I'm really sorry about that, too! It's a great series.  If you don't mind Digital, Comixology has all the trades for fairly cheap. They're $12-13 USD, while the physical copies will normally run you $15-20, depending. The Comixology edition is the same thing as the physical Deluxe Edition hardback trades, collecting all the issues into 10 big books.  The series doesn't get an amazing amount of reprints, which is sad, but on occasion you can find a good collection on places like E-Bay."
IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,crezentials,4,Sat Apr 11 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! I've only recently begun getting into comics so I'm still figuring out where to get older stuff. I'll check Amazon/ebay/Comixology."
IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,made_this_at_5am,7,Sat Apr 11 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"Comixology has a -really- good selection of old and new comics, and a lot of them at very fair pricing against the physical copy. They also recently added a Subscription(You subscribe to a series, it auto-buys the next issue day-of-release) service, which is nice for books like Sandman: Overture, which we never know -when- that book will come out.  We'll get listings! Doesn't mean the book will be ready by then. Gaiman does it whenever he feels like it, it seems, so having it just auto-buy day of is nice for me. I can look at my tablet, and see ""New comics!""  It probably seems odd for someone who works for a physical store to promote digital, but.. I'm more about readers getting what they WANT to read, without having to break the bank, or go on insane hunts to find old books or single issues."
IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,LadyGrizabella,5,Sat Apr 11 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I have a little shelf I'm working on so I'm subscribed to a few series at a comic shop right now, but I'll definitely pick up Y The Last Man digitally if I can't find it physically for a good price.

IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,wishforagiraffe,9,Sat Apr 11 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"As I said in the main post, I do basic weekly fill-orders and specialty orders for a Comic and Tabletop Gaming store.  Most of my job involves getting e-mails about what we need to stock, and contacting a distro for the order. Frequently, we'll get asked about specialty books, rarities, more expensive Tabletop mini sets, and I do my best to accommodate a customer within their price range.  My job exists just so my boss could spend more time at home with his daughter, while knowing someone he trusts with sensitive information(Like the business accounts) is handling it. He's one of my best friends, and knows I won't go off and try buying things on the company card.  It's a fairly relaxing job, though not a common one, probably. It's a dying business, and we both know it, but owning a comic shop was his dream, and I have a passion for comics and tabletop gaming, so I'm quite happy to be involved in helping others find what they need."
IDontWorkHereLady,327ts8,LadyGrizabella,5,Sat Apr 11 18:11:14 2015 UTC,That sounds like such an awesome job. I would totally work for a comic store but I don't think I'd get paid enough to afford all the comics I want to own hahaha.

Despite having the smallest crew and the highest sales we've had in all the years I've worked at the place, management is panicking over our being over hours (somehow). They're pretty aggro about following schedule unless it's not an option. Though my management isn't that concerned because we wouldn't get the work done without the people who stay late every day."

IDontWorkHereLady,326e1k,amphetamine709,15,Sat Apr 11 05:51:01 2015 UTC,"I started thinking about it recently and it occurred to me that when I was first hired, the truck unload team had 13-15 everyday, 9-11 people out on the floor working push and pulls, 6 people in the backroom, and then the supervisor and manager would help when they weren't covering the door, etc.  28-32 people when I was hired and the average truck was about 800 units smaller. We now have 18-19 on an average day with trucks that are, again, significantly larger on average. 60-65% as many people as we used to have, roughly 30-35% more product on average per truck.  Oh, and the food truck (refrigerated/frozen/fresh) was on Monday and Friday.  It is now every other day, including Sunday plus Friday. Friday is now two food trucks, with the frozen sent on its own vehicle separate from the rest.    It's also not like it's different for the day side operations. The store has nowhere near enough people on the floor and the registers are constantly understaffed. I personally don't go to the place after 4pm because the register time is like 30 fucking minutes.  AND YET WE ARE OVER HOURS HUEHUEHUEHUE."

When I first started we almost always got everything done with the aisles 'faced up' as they say.  Not so much anymore.  Making aisles look neat is something of a rarity these days.  They've started pushing for it more now, but that'll come at the expense of getting product on the shelf.  They can't have their cake and eat it too FFS.  Indeed they cut down on the hours during some of the busiest times of the year (mid/late fall, thru to right about now, actually).  District manager (or something like that) came a few weeks back and when asked if they'll increase hours in order to get more work done?  ""No, we'll work on increasing efficiency."".  He seemed nice enough I guess, but had the usual load of crap about getting more done with less.  I've never liked my job much, but I'm liking it less these days because there is more micromanagement than ever now (and we all love that, don't we?)."

It was a call center, so he couldn't exactly pull the ""I don't work here"" card, but he did put people on hold for 5+ minutes for no reason.  Our operator IDs (everything we do on the computer is logged under those) was 4 characters, letters and numbers.  He would say his was ""R2D2"" when they wanted it to complain about him...  Honestly, I don't know how he lasted 2 years there.  We got QA'd 4-6 times a week, randomly, and doing even one of the things he did on most calls was grounds for immediate termination, or at least being written up and the next time being termination.  I know it sounds like a lot of QAs, but on a busy shift, you could easily take over 100 calls, so that's ~about a 1% QA rate."

IDontWorkHereLady,326e1k,Sohcahtoa82,11,Sat Apr 11 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was D-K. I said something similar because I believe the person in question doesn't accept that anyone else has a greater understanding of reality.

Sometimes you couldn't go two steps without being grabbed for assholes demanding help, and that made going on your meal break a royal pain in the ass. Since our 'uniforms' were whatever we wanted to wear as long as it's not too short and in all black, we could easily get away with the whole ""I don't actually work here, sorry!"" excuse. If not, we wouldn't be able to go on our lunch breaks in time, and that would throw off the meal schedule for pretty much the whole sales floor.

Mostly tequilas, since that's my liquor of choice, and lots of questions about different margaritas and tequila sunrises, and what the best mixers were, stuff like that.

Edit to add: If the entire interaction had been in English, I would imagine OP would have said, ""Blah blah blah"" and waved her off dismissively.

Making a disrespectful origin-based mockery, not good.   You could say ""Hey, don't be a dick in the first place, it will avoid further rudeness towards you.""

IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,N546RV,40,Tue Apr 7 22:30:34 2015 UTC,The fuck is a pain clinic?
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,Megnaman,81,Wed Apr 8 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"Technically? A clinic that specializes on treating patients with chronic pain.  Practically? Lots of them are basically legal drug dealers. You come in, get a perfunctory exam/consultation, and you leave with a boatload of oxy or something along those lines.  It was pretty evident that our neighbors fit into the latter category. The patients were uniformly spacey and frantic to see the doctor, as evidenced by how batshit they went if the doc wasn't there. And the doctor himself had at least three expensive cars, including a fucking Hummer on 22s. Oh, and they had an actual security guy, an enormous dude who would stand around, keep an eye on shit, walk around sort of patrolling the parking lot...you know, the kind of stuff you don't normally associate with normal doctors."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,tellyeggs,21,Wed Apr 8 01:29:14 2015 UTC,"I can't help saying ""most"" are pill peddlers. I've been treated for chronic back pain, and used to see a ""pain specialist"" on a regular basis. I could have gotten all the oxy I wantd. I've had multiple orthopedic surgeries, and on post op visits, it seems like the doc couldn't wait to prescribe pain meds to me. Luckily, I don't respond to that crap. I'd surely be an addict now. I just grunt through the pain.  Edit: spelling"
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,TheDoktorIsIn,8,Wed Apr 8 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"That's relatively good to hear, I did work in something like that and we had a woman who, through no fault of her own, ended up with severe back issues and addicted.  It was heartwrenching."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,tellyeggs,4,Fri Apr 10 08:02:36 2015 UTC,"Oxy addiction is an epidemic now. When people, many of them teens, run out of oxy, they move on to heroin. I had a root canal last year, and the doc gave me oxy ""just in case."" I just thought, REALLY??"
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,PrimeLegionnaire,7,Fri Apr 10 11:38:22 2015 UTC,Opiates for a root canal seems pretty reasonable if you ask me.  That can be some serious pain.
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,LordRuby,2,Fri Apr 10 17:41:23 2015 UTC,The two I've had stopped the pain. They take the nerves out so there is nothing there to feel the pain afterwards.
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,PrimeLegionnaire,2,Sat Apr 11 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"Mostly the pain is the tissue surrounding the tooth becoming irritated iirc, I'm not a doctor."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,tellyeggs,0,Sat Apr 11 03:27:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But I was just underscoring how docs dole the stuff out like candy. It's a well known problem in the states. I just hate reading how teens are getting hooked on em after an injury, then move on to heroin."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,Gary_Wayne,0,Fri Apr 10 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a well known problem in the states. It is DEA propaganda to control the flow of narcotics. Doctors are afraid of losing their licenses prescribing pain medication, and they are leaving legitimate people to suffer for it."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,ezerb9,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:57:43 2015 UTC,"It's nice that the pain clinic I used to go to would take precautions to try to prevent patients from selling their pills. They would do random drug tests to make sure the drug you were prescribed was in your system, as well as randomly checking to see how many pills you had left. I'm not sure how it actually worked for them, since I wasn't prescribed narcotics, but it seemed good in theory."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,trainspotting2,19,Sat Apr 11 06:50:39 2015 UTC,"Pain management clinic. They do a lot of good for people who have chronic pain, but a lot of people also get addicted to the meds. They're not the opium dens or legal drug dealers that this thread is making them out to be."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,badgermole_,-4,Wed Apr 8 14:46:05 2015 UTC,I'm sure not all of them are but most are.
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,trainspotting2,5,Wed Apr 8 16:27:09 2015 UTC,what are you basing that on?
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,badgermole_,0,Wed Apr 8 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"What are you basing this on?:   They're not the opium dens or legal drug dealers that this thread is making them out to be.   You don't like what people in the thread are saying, which for all you know is valid, so you're saying it's not true based on... what? Maybe the one near you isn't bad? Personally I've seen a LOT of addicts in my area who either steal, lie to doctors to get pain meds from pharmacies or go to clinics."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,trainspotting2,6,Wed Apr 8 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"Firsthand experience working with pain management doctors (not as a patient). There are plenty of addicts and pill hounds out there, but that doesn't mean the clinics aren't on the level."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,badgermole_,2,Wed Apr 8 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"Nobody's saying the clinics themselves operate like dens, they're saying that the people who go there treat it like that. I assume it also varies by area. Some areas are treated with more respect and others treated with less.  Your experience differs, I get it. Again, it differs by area so people are going to have different experiences. I've seen what things are like in my area, but then my city's kind of a shithole in general. Lots of stagnation, not enough jobs, addicts for many different things, homelessness, mental illness, etc. It's not a great place in general so I'm not surprised things are the way they are here."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,trainspotting2,5,Wed Apr 8 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Nobody's saying the clinics themselves operate like dens   That's pretty much exactly what people here are saying.    In my state pain clinics prescribe class 2 narcotics to anybody with enough funds.  less than ethical physicians use it to peddle Oxycontin and other prescription analgesics   People are acting like getting Oxycontin or Dilaudid is as easy as getting medical marijuana, and it simply isn't. Laws are stricter, penalties are severe, and the doctors recognize and avoid problem patients."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,badgermole_,-3,Wed Apr 8 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"I wonder why people are saying that's how it is where they live then? Maybe it's because... it varies by area? What a concept. /s  And find, sure, some people are saying that. Not everyone. You're taking what a few people (or even just one) have said and turning it into, ""Everyone I disagree with are saying this,"" which isn't true.  And to be honest, at this point you have no argument. You're saying your ""firsthand experience"" trumps everyone else's, even when people are saying, ""I'm sure not all places are like this, but it's like that here."" You keep saying we're wrong, because your experience differs."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,trainspotting2,4,Wed Apr 8 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"You still haven't actually supported your claim that ""most"" clinics are like that."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,domestic_omnom,-2,Wed Apr 8 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"Ill base it on my brother who ended up over dosing on meds after he got addicted to oxy from a shoulder injury he got while in the army.while some people do benefit. Ive seen more obvious pill heads in and out than I did patients. Pain management is a good idea, in practice a shit job is done of weeding out the addicts or even preventing addiction in the first place."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,TheTiminator2010,-4,Fri Apr 10 01:09:41 2015 UTC,I believe he is talking about a methadone clinic. Basically they give out drugs and what not to get people over their addictions. More so alcoholics. I could be wrong here though
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,Calvinette4,37,Wed Apr 8 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Rather than downvoting, I'll just explain what they are. Methadone is to treat opiate withdrawal (heroin, oxy, roxi, etc.) and is administered by specially licensed practitioners (in my state, it's an 8 hour class for docs). You can do a taper down regimen, where you're weaned off. Others do maintenance where they stay on the same level. There's disagreement on which is better in professional circles, particularly a lot of people object to maintenance. Personally, I'm ok with it in a harm reduction model, but that's a conversation for another thread.  Alcohol withdrawal is typically treated inpatient to ensure you don't have a seizure and, although more lethal, is not treated in a taper down or maintenance method over time like opiates. Pretty much the only ongoing drug for people with alcohol issues is antabuse, which just makes you feel sick if you drink while taking it, and doesn't need a specialized clinic like methadone.  OP gives a good answer about pain clinics. Their theoretical intent is to treat chronic pain, but some less than ethical physicians use it to peddle Oxycontin and other prescription analgesics."
IDontWorkHereLady,31sxgc,TheTiminator2010,4,Wed Apr 8 03:56:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for explaining. Like I said I kind of new but wasn't sure

IDontWorkHereLady,31rt32,Meandmynuts,18,Wed Apr 8 01:54:53 2015 UTC,"""Minority Report.""  That's actually one of the things that made the story so memorable for me, albeit in a pretty bizarre way.   About a year prior to the above story, I'd seen the aforementioned movie in theaters. It quickly became one of my favorites, and I was not shy about telling people as much. Then, when Christmas rolled around, no fewer than three people got DVDs of it for me... and I had purchased it for two people, myself.  With five copies of the film hanging out in the house that Christmas morning, my mother starting saying that the gifts ""were not the minority,"" which she thought was intensely funny. (Not the pun itself, mind you: She was amused by how many times she said it during the day.)  It is a decent movie, though. I'm sure the old man's grandson loved it."

IDontWorkHereLady,31rhbp,Xanza,12,Tue Apr 7 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"But you can't really blame them when you have a nametag on with a blue shirt.   I don't really agree with this. Usually for me (and in the rest of the stories) the irritating part is not the initial mistake, it's how they react to you saying you don't work there.  So let's look at their reaction:   ""Geez, well how was I supposed to know that you didn't work here if you have a nametag on?""   If you say in a relatively polite tone that you don't work there, then this reaction is completely unwarranted and dickish. They're an insecure jackass being overly defensive.  But if you're rolling your your eyes or sounding exasperated, then what do you expect? That's a perfectly reasonable response to you being a dick.  I assume OP was relatively polite, otherwise what he calls ""overly defensive"" would be perfectly understandable. But who knows."

I mean, I'm not defending idiotic and rude people, but I'm simply saying it's not a HUGE mistake to believe that someone wearing a nametag in a facility that has employees with nametags actually works there."

However, most of my comments have to do with my hair, which looks like Macaulay Culkin's when he was in Home Alone. I also have blonde eyebrows and eyelashes, which everyone points out, amazed.   But the one instance that takes the cake was when I went to a major clothing/accessory store. I was wandering around, looking for nothing in particular, and a woman came up to me. She was fairly big, maybe in her mid-forties, and had obviously dyed platinum-blonde hair. At first, she seemed nice enough. She will be PBH and I will be Me.   PBH: ""Excuse me, but what colour dye do you use?""  Me: ""What?"" I had no clue what she was talking about at this point.   PBH: ""I said what colour hair dye do you use?"" Starting to sound annoyed.   Me: ""Oh, I don't dye my hair."" Which is true, and I turn around and start walking away. This isn't the first time I've been asked this.   PBH: ""Don't lie to me. Yes you do. There is no way that is natural."" She says this in a combination of snottiness and annoyance that I can't ignore.   Me: ""Look, ma'am. I don't dye my hair. You're barking up the wrong tree.""  PBH: ""Young child! Don't talk to your elders like that!""  I just start walking away at that point, knowing this conversation is going nowhere fast. PBH sees this and does a 180° in her tone.   PBH: ""You don't have to lie to me. I won't tell anyone that your hair is dyed."" She says this in the way you'd talk to a three-year-old to make her admit she ate the last cookie. She then winks at me.   Me: At this point I had had enough. ""Look at my eyelashes. Have you ever heard of someone dying their eyelashes? I don't think so. So for the last time, I. Do. Not. Dye. My. Hair."" I turn on my heals and walk away, ignoring her further pleas.   TL;DR: Some snotty woman insisted that I dye my hair. I imagined dumping a bucket of bleach on her head, but it seemed like someone had already bleached her brain.   Edit: some small typos"

It's probably depressing if you had decent parents, because you're glimpsing in on a group that had violence and abuse normalized. Unpacking that shit gets messy.   On the bright side, you see people there learning coping mechanisms, discussing ways to unlearn their own negative behaviors, and coaching on how to (essentially) divorce some or all of their family which is sometimes called for.   It's overall a positive place, because the underlying theme isn't ""woe is me"".... and it will never be, because that's some narcissistic shit right there.

When I tried to tell them, ""I don't work here, and I plan to buy all these things"", about half were very embarrassed and apologized, and the other half thought I was lying for some reason.

The atitude of ""The customer is always right"" has conditioned these people that if they ask loudly and long enough, there's a good chance they'll get what they want.

IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,SpecificallyGeneral,204,Mon Apr 6 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"No charges were pressed.  In my city, police come out automatically with every paramedic call (especially in a case like this where an off-duty officer was involved.)  And in this case, it may even have been a store policy to include the police for any potential medical issue, to give evidence that the woman's fainting was not actually the store's fault (so that charges won't be pressed against the store in the end.)  The offending customer was carried out on a stretcher, and I saw her shielding her face with her hand as if she was humiliated by how her escapade had ended up so poorly for her."

I installed cable for a contractor company and I had to wear a lanyard ID badge with my picture on it and whatnot. Would constanly get people coming up to me and asking me where stuff is, what I didn't get was I was wearing a weird green checkered button down shirt, jeans and steal toe boots. What part about that would make people think I work at walmart, just because someone is wearing a id badge doesn't mean they work there.

I mostly wear graphic shirts with weird shit on them (Tv, Anime, Video Games) I have long hair, a full beard, I wear black baggy cargo pants, and all those graphic shirts? Also black... and baggy...  I look so fucking far from professional, or uniformed, and they still ask me ""Excuse me, can you help me find the _________""  The funny thing is, I usually know where it is, so I say ""Yeah it should be in the corner over there."" and they say ""Thank you.""  And 90% of the time it's followed by a second question that I almost never know the answer to, so that's when I say ""Well, sorry to break it to you, but I don't even work here. I was just being nice.""  People turn beet red with embarrassment. Sometimes a string of ""Oh, so sorry, so so sorry.""  I mean, I don't mind answering because if I know, I can answer it just as well as an employee. That and sometimes I know more about some of the products than some of the employees."

She asked me where the notebook paper was. I found it for her and she thanked me and said she would tell the cashier how helpful I was. I was going to let her go because I knew if she realized I was in the Navy I would get the overly gracious thank you instead. But I told her anyway to avoid any stupid confusion.

IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,phoenixink,85,Tue Apr 7 06:18:01 2015 UTC,"harassment, disturbing the peace -- take your pick."
IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,lurking_tiger,26,Mon Apr 6 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you, but I wonder why you were downvoted so much? That would be my presumption as well - causing a loud, disruptive scene in public with a police officer seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to find a few things to charge her with based on the circumstances; harassment and disturbing of the peace seem like two of the most likely.  Does somebody want to chime in and let us know why this would be incorrect?"
IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,HalkiHaxx,12,Mon Apr 6 22:54:09 2015 UTC,Disturbing the peace would probably be the charge since the woman in this case was being irrational and aggressive with a random stranger in a public place. A few dozen hours of community service or a small fine would be the probable result if anything ever came of it. I think she managed to punish herself so sufficiently that nothing would come of it.

The state probably wouldn't take something that minor to court but the arrest would hold up to scrutiny."
IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,grabbag21,-11,Mon Apr 6 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"Not when the person didn't know it was a police officer.  The whole threatening arrest thing seems dumb to me.  The situation shouldn't be any different given that the person was an off duty police officer or not.  An off duty police officer should act like any normal person unless the situation truly calls for it.  I mean had you been customer one would you have said, ""I AM CALLING THE POLICE TO GET YOU ARRESTED""?  I mean the off duty officer could have just walked away, or gotten the actual management. Instead they are threatening to arrest some one."
IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,amrak_em_evig,28,Tue Apr 7 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"Why should the officer have to walk away or get the management? She was minding her own business shopping how she wanted to shop, she gave this woman a perfectly reasonable answer, and then was harassed. Stop victim blaming."
IDontWorkHereLady,31o4p2,grabbag21,-19,Tue Apr 7 18:35:41 2015 UTC,Ah yes arresting someone will be a far more efficient use of their time and the correct way to deal with the situation.

Not all infringements on your comfort have to be dealt with using our tax dollars. There are plenty of ways of dealing with insufferable cunts than arresting them.

But some people can't stand to be wrong, and some people are too stupid to realize that being wrong is even possible for them.  There's a stupidity overlap between not realizing another customer is not in the store's uniform, and being too stupid to comprehend that you're wrong, so I imagine the unpleasantness of people making the ""You work here"" mistake is slightly higher than that of the general population, but not by that much."

I keep an eye on the little guy while I keep searching.   She comes close and asks for something next to me at the top shelf, so instinctively I grab it and hand it to her, then go back to searching. She then goes on a short tirade about parents letting their kids run around and not keep an eye on them, and how I should tell my manager about ""that little boy"" whom she thinks is up to no good. I looked to her with a 'wut?' expression after I had just found what I needed. She reiterates that I should get my manager to take care of it.  With my item in one hand, and my one-finger-salute in the other, I walk away, motion for my nephew to let's go, and we leave the aisle to continue looking around. She had the most strained look on her face, not knowing what just happened. I'm sure she then put two and two together after it sunk in."

IDontWorkHereLady,3157q8,Astramancer_,69,Thu Apr 2 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"The last time I refused to answer that I got downvoted into oblivion, so I'll just explain my reasoning.  When I got the dog I wasn't old enough to make my own medical decisions. My parents felt that he was the best course of action, and I disagreed. I highly valued my ability to pass for ""normal"" and I didn't want to lose that, and while I loved the dog to pieces, taking him everywhere was kind of my own personal hell. Every person I met immediately knew that I was not normal, and they all wanted to know why.  And he overshadowed me, in a way. For five years, all the compliments I got were directed toward my dog. My dog was so pretty, my dog was so talented, my dog was so smart. At one point I was competing in a statewide competition, and one of my judges addressed and began talking to my dog when we walked into the room. I came in, she said good morning and asked how I was, and when I started to answer she clarified ""sorry; I was speaking to your dog."" I was hurt, and I told her as much; she was there to judge me, I was supposed to be her priority.  So she gave me the lowest score possible and wrote on my comment card that my coach should have a stern talk with me about my manners.  People would fight me over whether or not I could come into a shoe store, a restaurant, the attraction that my family was on vacation to see, and I would have to tell them ""He's a service dog; I'm disabled,"" when I honestly didn't see myself that way. I'm inconvenienced, but what's wrong with me- in my eyes- doesn't qualify as a disability.  When I stopped using the dog, it blew my mind how much better I felt. My self-esteem doubled, and without even realizing that I'd been depressed, I was suddenly no longer depressed.   I ended up putting myself in therapy because of how screwed up I was over the whole thing. The goth still hasn't entirely worn off. And there was a whole year where I couldn't see a service dog out in public without reacting negatively. Hiding my face in my boyfriend's sleeve. Bursting into tears. Turning and running the other way. It was a little like that scene in Harry Potter after they've used the Time Turner, with Hermoine wondering ""Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?!"" Good god; is that how I looked?!?  This got heavier than I meant it to. Sorry."

IDontWorkHereLady,312gny,devention,5,Thu Apr 2 05:51:46 2015 UTC,Think of it this way: alcohol is legal in every state. But that doesn't make it okay to go to work drunk.

IDontWorkHereLady,312gny,RemySandrine,4,Thu Apr 2 06:35:07 2015 UTC,I agree. The day some one shows up high is the day they get fired imo. As for the smell I use a filter so my apt does not smell like it as my girlfriend  doesn't smoke and I have 2 cats. I don't want them accdently getting high.

I'm just of the mindset that it does nothing for me, I don't need it, I have my store's triple caffeinated coffee 4 days a week, and I'm well off. It's just not cool to work impaired under alcohol or drugs, but some people just don't have that many brain cells to figure that out."

I was kinda surprised that they passed a couple of other people and directly went to the person wearing big headphones and a hoody and jeans, while carrying a schoolbag and an umbrella.   I think it was because I was rushing to get a connecting bus to uni and to them, whatever way I walked it looked like I meant business and knew where I was."
IDontWorkHereLady,3095z3,songoku9001,21,Wed Mar 25 17:24:38 2015 UTC,I've found that if I'm wearing headphones or ear plugs people make more of an effort to come up and talk to you. I can go grocery shopping and not have a single person even look in my direction. Put head phones on and I might as well be standing under a sign begging people to come talk to me.
IDontWorkHereLady,3095z3,ashleyamdj,31,Wed Mar 25 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"Reminds me...  There was a thread a few weeks ago on /r/AskWomen from a guy asking if it is rude to try to strike up conversations with women that have headphones on.  Obviously, everyone said YES and pointed out that a lot of people wear headphones specifically to indicate they don't want to be talked to, and that asking them to take them off just so you can chat with them is extremely rude.  The guy never explicitly said it, but it felt like he thought that women should always be available to be approached."

I don't hang out in the area around my work, which is about due east from my apartment. I tend to hang out more south and southwest, just because that's where my friends and my boyfriend lives. So work is pretty much the only thing I come this way for. People will come into the store and ask me where something is and genuinely get mad at me when I can't tell them where it is. For one, I probably don't know where any plumbing supply stores in the whole city are and two I don't drive in this area except to come straight to work and straight home. We also get calls from truck drivers asking directions from the interstate, which we are directly on. I tell them we are located between [one big store and one big car dealership] but they will get mad at me because I don't know the exit number. I NEVER exit there when I'm on the highway, nor do I know exit numbers by heart. I can tell them the road to look for, but that's it. You'd think that's good enough, but it isn't.

I had to know the exit, which roads would get you there, and how to get there from the local movie theater and stores. I also had to know a few similar details when I worked at a gas station, how to get to different stores, banks, doctors offices, etc. However, I have no idea what your job is or whether or not that information is important to your job."

The last delivery driver who called and got mad wouldn't let me transfer him to our anyone else, including the Receiving department he could have asked for. I can understand asking me, but don't get mad if I don't know. I might get asked for directions somewhere 3 times a year. I always get them to someone who does know if they need more specific stuff than what I can provide.  Funny related story. At my last store I did know the area pretty well. A lady came in and asked me where another store was and I gave her turn by turn directions. She got mad and said, ""Well, what good is that? Don't you have the address?"" Ummm... Not in my head, no. To be fair she did also ask which block it was on, as in the 200 block or 300 block, but again, I don't know right off hand.

I said okay thanks and went to leave, omg they went after me for like 10 more minutes with ""What about this one,"" ""This is nicer than cushion cut"", ""Give me your phone number and I'll invite you to this event"", ""You want this ring"" I know what I want and you don't carry it so please just let me leave."

IDontWorkHereLady,305vun,gwynfshae,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:34:34 2015 UTC,"WARNING: 1am mobile rant.   As an employee at the department store with the big red star, we are drilled to ""Make MAGIC!"" Half the time, managers aren't that far away, and they're constantly watching what we are and aren't doing (because their bonuses depend on it). If they see we haven't offered to open a credit card for you, we get a 20 minute ""coaching session"" (read: chewing out) on opening credits. ""What are you doing to get applications?"" ""Let's role play! How are you going to convince me to apply for a card?"" ""I need you to make a promise that you're going to open more cards."" For fuck's sake.   And though people complain about us bugging them, believe me when I tell you that 80% of the customers coming in my counter (precisely the one OP mentioned) expect you to show them every fragrance whilst holding their hand. And if they actually do buy something (because I probably spend about ~2 of every shift dealing with customers who want you to be their impromptu therapist, to treat them like gods amongst men, and/or just make a huge mess spraying down my counters to simply say, ""Oh, I'll think about it!""), you must then give them everything. Every sample, every bag, and nonexistent discounts. If we don't, we get chewed out by customers and occasionally management for not giving them a MAGIC shopping experience. For fuck's sake.   TL;DR: Damned if we do, damned if we don't. Also, we're all supposed to be wizards or something."

All his shirts had holes in them and he would pin his radio to one of the holes. No shit. I got dress-coded 3 times (for wearing a beenie, a red undershirt, and something else dumb.) I approached a manager about it (since other employees were getting away with similar and worse infringements.) I told her ""I think I'm being discriminated against."" She answered ""no you're not."" Didn't ask why I thought that or anything.   I do want to say that's obviously a store management problem, if Walmart corporate saw a guy with a holey shirt they'd flip out."

Customers of that store overhear this and assume I work there despite me wearing blue jeans and a tshirt of a woman lying on a gun with her legs spread (Velvet Revolver tshirt, I'm a fan) rather than the black shirt and pants the employees wear. However, this lovely old lady asks me one day about laptops for her grandson and I stood for an hour showing her the different models and explaining reliability of different brands etc. At the end of the conversation I call over one of the employees and ask him to kindly check out the lady.   She looks at me in surprise ""you don't work here?"" Me: No, I just know a bit about computers. Employee: You shouldn't help people if you don't know what you're talking about. The woman apologized to me and promptly left the store. Guy looked at me real angry. I'm still trying to process that to this day.

I wanted a PC that would be able to run AutoCAD software for many of my engineering projects, which primarily ran on Windows.

I found the pies I wanted and got out of the way, but she didn't move forward to get her own pies, so I asked ""Do you want some help?"" She was so grateful and looked relieved that I offered! I got back down there and dug out her preferred pie flavours - we agreed that the raspberry and custard ones were the best. Then she advised me to return to the confectionary isle because toblerones were also on sale. Her trolley was mostly dessert (including a really big toblerone).

IDontWorkHereLady,2z2h1n,rhymes_with_chicken,3,Sun Mar 15 20:42:18 2015 UTC,At least he didn't ask to speak to your manager.
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,AlysrianXian,299,Mon Mar 9 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"The second somebody else started to bug you, you should have gone to get a manager. The second she followed you out to your car, you should have called 911.   There is NO reason you should have put up with that for as long as you did."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,notwhereyouare,96,Mon Mar 9 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"My response was basically tears.  My usual non-pregnancy response is to start cursing, flipping out, etc.  My husband even pointed out I should have called 911, but for some reason I was too busy crying in the car to do even think of doing it.  I just was a mess of tears and couldn't think straight after she started chasing me through the store."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,Kailu,59,Mon Mar 9 17:35:20 2015 UTC,Even if I was a bystander witnessing this that lady would probably be on the floor if I was there. I'm sorry this happened to you I'd be furious if this happened to my SO.
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,primarydole,42,Mon Mar 9 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"Totally not how this town works. When stuff like this happens,  people are more interested in the gossip of the situation rather than actually helping.  After 6 years of living here, this was the straw that pushed us over the limit. My husband even gave me free reign to take my filter off permanently and screw the gossips due to this.  He's usually concerned about a scene being made but not anymore."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,primarydole,-14,Mon Mar 9 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"You talk about your husband giving you permission to express yourself and revoking your permission to go out in public without him? That's pretty fucked up, and I hope you see that."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,Mitch_Mitcherson,10,Fri Apr 10 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"??  I never said I needed his permission to go out in public without him.  He gave me free reign to finally start making scenes in public.  As in, he doesn't care what I say to people like this instead of lecturing me on ""what the neighbors might think"" etc later on.  We no longer worry about the gossips and act accordingly now.  If you've ever lived in a small town,  you'd know gossip travels fast and are always trying to avoid BEING the source of gossip.  Since it effects my family, he has equal say in wanting to be or not be the source of said gossip.  At the very least, he has a right to have an opinion on situations like this.  He never ""revoked"" my ability to go out without him. It was much safer and less drama to just have him come with me instead.  If anyone is to be attacked over this situation it should be the people who basically required us to go out together (IE these two people).  They are the issue, not my concerned husband.   I think your reading between the lines and creating a scenario that doesn't exist in my marriage."

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,Vikingrage,86,Mon Mar 9 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"That manager sounds like a grade A asshole. WTF. They didn't even intervene, let alone think about calling the police. How do you let this kind of disturbance go unchecked in your store? I am sorry this happened to you and that no one lifted a goddamn finger to do anything about it."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,raknor88,51,Mon Mar 9 17:34:49 2015 UTC,Eh...the locals are all like this.  My friends and I have stories everyday about something one of the locals has done that was completely inappropriate/rude.  It's a never-ending shitstorm of entitlement.  The manager actually wound up moving about 3 months ago.  Much better manager on staff there now.  He's banned a few locals for their attitudes already.
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,littlewoolie,18,Mon Mar 9 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"Well, that's good to hear at least. About the manager, not the asshole townspeople.  I hope you're better able to handle these jerks now, hormones are no joke."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,muigleb,29,Mon Mar 9 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"I'm much better at dealing with all of them (plus I'm moving soon so don't care who sees my posts now). That pregnancy was really no joke. Lots of issues, hormones being the least of my worries.  Add on people like this and I think it was the perfect storm of ""OMG too much!"" And I just snapped.  My husband nicknamed me ice bitch for a reason.  I usually don't take this type of attitude from anyone. My usual reaction is a lot of attitude and maybe some justified anger.  The new manager is completely awesome compared to the old one. It probably helps that he's not a local, thus won't put up with them. I know for a fact he's banned three moms who have been on a nonstop powertrip around town for the last 3 ish years. It's nice to see some karma in action. They have to shop over an hour away now."

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,coffeeismysoul,0,Tue Mar 10 09:24:21 2015 UTC,Could you ballpark how many people are in the town?
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,coffeeismysoul,1 point,Tue Mar 10 06:58:54 2015 UTC,This. A proper manager would have asked what was going on just to calm everyone down.
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,kimchiphilii,28,Wed Mar 11 01:53:54 2015 UTC,"Situation 1 (entitled dickwad): sugar bag to face. Situation 2 (old entitled bitch): sugar bag to face... repeatedly. Situation 3 (car park - OEB): just reverse, I guarantee she'll move, if not... meh, less pollution in the gene pool/ or being the OEB that she is, one less scar on humanity.  As a person I'm enraged and I'm sorry you had to go through that, people these days... my faith in humanity is rather shaky at best, and the few good times do not make up for all the bullshit.  As a husband and a recent father... hell no, sad to admit I have a short fuse when it comes to my family, highly protective I suppose. My reaction would not have been vocal after a first attempt to kindly tell them to fuck off.  My wife had the same problem you do with her hip, poor thing, She never went anywhere without me though. Congrats on the new kidlet!"
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,smoike,31,Mon Mar 9 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"Sigh. This is why you call the police and give them a factual account of what you can see; let them make the call as to how busy they are.  The trick is to get them there before it escalates into violence, not after.  The manager of that store was in the wrong, and I'm so sorry this happened to you... but congratulations on the new baby!"
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,knightricer210,29,Mon Mar 9 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry you had to go through that.  I just had my son 4 months ago but I had a very low bullshit tolerance when I was pregnant and would get mean if people were mean to me first. I had some medical issues. I would pass out and get dizzy all the time so my work provided me with a stool to sit on. I can't tell you how many times I got ""oh you look like you're working hard"" or ""must be nice to sit all day"" my comback for those was ""yeah I'm working hard 24/7. I'm growing a human from scratch"" it would shut them up immediately. Believe it or not I actually had people get mad at me when I'd ask them to lift the heavy stuff out of their cart. I have no clue how you didn't blow up at them!"
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,TheMechanicalBeast,16,Mon Mar 9 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure why I didn't blow up on them. That entire pregnancy was just a lot of hormonal weirdness for me.  I've heard the lazy comments too many times to count during this pregnancy too. My spd is so severe I've been in a wheelchair for about 5 months now. I always get the comments when I use the motorized scooter at the store. (Hip is dislocated by about 3 inches and last time around the time of this story it was completely out of socket. I had to actually force it back into place just to go out)  I think part of the reason I can brush a lot of it off now is because I rationalize that this woman put me through much worse.  I mean really, stuff like this only happens once."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,TheMechanicalBeast,8,Mon Mar 9 21:38:31 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I totally get it. I just hate how people are so judgmental. I could just imagine how bad I'd react if it were me. I imagine we're a lot alike. I don't really put up with much when I'm not pregnant and it gets 10x worse when I am lol
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,_Opario,24,Mon Mar 9 23:38:09 2015 UTC,This makes me want to somehow track both of these people down and punch them square in the jaw. I am so angry right now. Who talks to people this way? And the woman that followed you to your car has to be absolutely mental.
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,spirklet,23,Mon Mar 9 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Unsurprisingly she has zero mental issues. I've seen her around town since then but she didn't recognize me (haven't seen the man again). Last time I saw her she was at my kids' school concert (a month ago and I was in my wheelchair) and was trying to steal my seat (because she's a grandma waaahhhh). I was sitting in between my husband and brother. She walked up to me and demanded that I slide over for her so she could see her grandchild perform. She wanted me to somehow physically slide everyone sitting in chairs while in my wheelchair so she could sit by my husband.  I told her to fuck off and next time she should show up an hour early like we did. Pretty sure I even threw in an entitled bitch comment.  She tried to even turn to my brother and rant about how mean i am (she didn't know that he was with me and was looking for a sympathetic ear). He shut her down right quick.  All through this, she had no idea who I was. (Ohhhhh but I remembered her!)  She wound up complaining to the principal about me. But I volunteer and do a lot for the school so he basically brushed her off.  Some people are just like this all on their own and they see no issues with how they treat other people.  If they see you as below them, they usually act like this."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,littlewoolie,15,Mon Mar 9 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"No point.  This woman is really  in her own entitled world. I'm sure if I even see her again after the incident at the school, she'd still have no idea who I am.  I probably won't come across her again. We're moving June 6th. I am happy I got to tell her off later, even if it didn't phase her at all."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,AskMeAboutMyGooch,2,Mon Mar 9 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, someone like that will only allow their perception to show them what they want to see."

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,varukasalt,13,Tue Mar 10 05:27:29 2015 UTC,"Small town in northern Utah. People here are mostly locals, who have never left the town (let alone state). They all act the same. Religious, cliquey, gossipy,  entitled jerks.  I've heard near SLC isn't so bad....  After 6-7 years here though, it's pretty obvious to normal people (from outside Utah) that the locals are insane. We're military and kind of bought a house here, THEN realized our mistake. It only got worse when our kids hit school age.  The things we have seen are just mind boggling.   So, no matter how much the Utards want to talk about how amazing it is here...it gets to be terrible living the further north you go.  It's a very cult like town."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,ziekktx,5,Mon Mar 9 23:21:13 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you get a chance to move. Those people sound horrible! Keep your head up & wish you all the best in the future!
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,littlewoolie,7,Mon Mar 9 23:27:02 2015 UTC,"We move June 6th. After this incident,  my husband stopped caring about my making scenes in public when the locals are acting like nutjobs. He finds it funny when I publicly shame them."

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,eastkent,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"My sister is similar in personality to you, but I noticed that she was less confrontational when pregnant also. I'm guessing it's the extra vulnerability and the fear of it escalating to harm to the babies."

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,Henkersjunge,5,Fri Mar 13 17:40:26 2015 UTC,I'm currently pregnant with #4 right now and the whole walking thing just isn't happening.   I'll be fine after the new baby is born. Luckily this is our last kidlet. My little man is actually a pretty good 1 yr old. It probably helps that his sisters are much older than him and help out a lot.  What is ultimate mom day?  I've never heard of that before.  I did get to rage at the woman later but I don't think she learned anything from it.  Some people man.   Some people.
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,Joyjmb,3,Mon Mar 9 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"Mother's Day! In the UK at least, I think it's on a different date in the US? I genuinely can't even imagine how this happened to you like, even if you did work there, why would anyone ask a tiny, heavily pregnant woman to get something off a high shelf? Never mind that other bitch. I'm one of four too. Perfect number."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,CreatrixAnima,3,Mon Mar 9 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"I was also limping and leaning against shelves too. Lol I think for the guy it was a ""I'm handicapped and entitled.  Help me now and feel sorry for me"" (I'm assuming he realized after a while that i really didn't work there).  Most of his anger was based off my not helping him and his bad neck.  For the woman it was a soap box moment where she could rant/rave to her heart's content about the many injustices she perceived just by my existing AFTER she realized I was walking away and leaving the store (thus proving I really didn't work there).  After I left the store it was a lot of you're going to hell and how lazy my generation is.  I'm pretty sure mother's day is in may? I never really remember though. I'm such the guy in my marriage."
IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,CreatrixAnima,5,Mon Mar 9 22:24:10 2015 UTC,You could not have stopped me from pressing charges on that asshole.

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,rnambu,3,Wed Apr 15 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, she followed me to my car to continue screaming her little soap box comments (majority of which were just completely untrue).  I think she realized her mistake once I left the store and just wanted to continue screaming anyways.  Most of what she was screaming are actually not uncommon opinions around here (IE: Going to hell for being so young to have a kid, kids' these days being lazy, etc).  The onlookers (about 5 people total outside) were mostly locals that were more interested in the drama/gossip of the situation than actually caring about stepping in to help.  It was the talk of the town for about 2-3 months.  The manager eventually moved (about 3 months ago, and was probably the best thing to happen to this store) and was replaced with a MUCH better one.  He's already banned a few locals, including 3 intensely hated local soccer moms (these are the type of women that you always see posted about in stories of retail).  I feel very lucky that the employee at least validated how I was feeling at the time.  She's a really nice woman, and I've gotten to know her quite well since this encounter."

IDontWorkHereLady,2yglav,MissWiggly2,2,Tue Mar 10 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that it comes from the entitled raising the entitled.  These people haven't left this town, so the behavior is considered normal and perfectly acceptable. Thus, the cycle continues.  ""Outsiders"" are usually run out of town or treated like garbage until they leave. It's not uncommon for a non local to have issues with the locals. I know a few non locals here and they've had similar issues (not as extreme as this story though).  It's gotten so bad that even my awesome 50 ish year old neighbors are moving this summer and they've been here about 12 years."

Stores like Wal-Mart don't actually ""keep things in the back"" (despite everyone ""knowing that's how it is""), so if it's not on the shelf, they don't have any.  Ergo, there weren't any on the shelf, so the lady knew that was the only one they had."

When she found out we wouldn't sell them for he same price as a box store in New Brunswick or something she freaked out and started throwing the boxes back at the stack I made and at me and other employees.  I still see her from time to time.

IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,joosboxx,15,Tue Mar 3 19:38:24 2015 UTC,I work in a pub; once I've clocked out ain't nobody getting served. Apart from s small group of regulars who I feel a weird sorta affection towards.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,LauraBellz,6,Wed Mar 4 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically, if OP was an employee,  how else are they supposed to buy something?"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,hovercraft_of_eels,6,Wed Mar 4 04:11:27 2015 UTC,"Most stores I know of don't allow their employees to shop there directly following their shift, probably precisely to prevent situations where an off-duty employee is harassed by (other) customers or is roped in to work overtime."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,LauraBellz,10,Wed Mar 4 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I've never heard of that. All the stores I know of that my friends/family work at, you can purchase anything on your break, or when you're off-duty. You have to go through the line like a customer. The only rule is that you're not allowed to check yourself out (ha ha) - and some stores even prohibit you from ringing up a family member."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,hovercraft_of_eels,4,Wed Mar 4 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"My sister worked in retail until her pregnancy and that was the policy at the locations she worked at (three different chains over the course of a few years). Correct on the not checking yourself out rule there as well, I think that is common sense :)"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,LauraBellz,4,Wed Mar 4 14:53:23 2015 UTC,It just seems so mean to force employees to come back later! Especially if they live more than a couple minutes away; just seems like a waste of gas.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,trianna-uk,2,Wed Mar 4 15:29:25 2015 UTC,Our rule at a previous job was you had to obscure your name badge so that you could do your shopping and tell customers you are on break/finished and can't help without getting in trouble.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,5k1895,6,Thu Mar 5 09:11:12 2015 UTC,"I wish we could cover our name tag on break. Our managers think we should have our names displayed on breaks because they are paid breaks and we therefore are still representing the company. That's nice and all, but what's the point of a ""break"" if you won't let me take a true break from dealing with the customers?"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xsa8b,Petrollika,2,Thu Mar 5 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"At the store I work at, so long as you don't wear your name badge whilst off the clock you're good."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,budgiebum,40,Tue Mar 3 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the floor staff from Big W tend to stick to their own sections. I can kind of understand, knowing someone higher-up in the Woolworths management family who has explained their sectionality, but by the same token you would expect someone from another dept to be willing to help. Good on you for helping this poor woman!"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,ozboy82,18,Tue Mar 3 14:12:07 2015 UTC,Where I worked you were supposed to cover a section next to you if nobody was there- though nobody ever did. Sheer laziness/incompetance 99% of the time.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,ScreamingThenSilence,9,Tue Mar 3 19:32:28 2015 UTC,Some areas of the store have to have an employee in them during store hours due to the sheer value of goods in them. However those employees should have paged the employee covering the other department.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,Th3Ph0ny0n3,7,Tue Mar 3 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"Actually the big blue raves at their staff to help any customer until they are satisfied, which translates through management telephone-style to help the customer until you can pawn them off on another employee from that section. Electronics legitimately can't leave because they have keys or security or whatever. But electronics staff are specifically told to not leave. At least one during a shift. If its the evening time, housewares is on break and grocery is stocking in back, and maybe lawn and garden is helping unload the truck or hiding somewhere, there's legitimately noone left to help little old ladies."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,daft_inquisitor,27,Tue Mar 3 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"She should have tried the red and khaki store. Where they train team members to enthusiastically jump out of their sections and offer to help guests while pretending to be interested in whatever they're buying. Seriously, the training vids are hilarious."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,spearchuckin,19,Tue Mar 3 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"That's where I used to work. Those training videos were hilarious, but also that's pretty much exactly what we had to do. I had the pleasure of opening a brand new store and we would have Waits/sprints with the help call buttons before our grand opening. ""Sit and see just how long 60 seconds is for the guest."" ""who can make it from 1 corner to the other fastest in case no one is near the guest assistance button."" The people who hadn't been transferred in would literally run from the front lanes to seasonal.   It was kinda crazy..."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,spearchuckin,7,Tue Mar 3 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"I worked overnight so I didn't have to deal too much with guests (thank goodness). But before I got hired, I was subjected to sitting through hours of looped and repetitive training videos. My favorite one is when this TM goes up to a woman who is visibly pregnant and practically screams ""CONGRATS!"" while helping her find things for the baby."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,epiphanot,11,Tue Mar 3 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"The entire day of orientation is videos. It's so awful. Now a days there's not even a team lead in there talking to you or anything. It's just SIT  AND WATCH THE VIDEOS NO SHUT UP DONT ASK QUESTIONS IM GOING BACK TO MY OFFICE.  My favorite was always either the guy who lost his finger because his ring tore it off while he was sliding down a ladder, or the ""how to gingerly help the disabled"" ones..."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,spearchuckin,8,Tue Mar 3 17:38:05 2015 UTC,"worked briefly for a large national gas station/convenience store chain.  16+ hours of training vids!!!  Your first 2 days are supposed to be corporate movie night, i guess.    there's a booklet with a quiz you're supposed to answer at the end of each vid.  Conveniently, the video background flashes different colors when a quiz answer is happening on screen so if you're just fast-forwarding...  Still took 2 hours to go through the vids.  When i was done, the store manager looked at his watch then smiled and, quite seriously, asked if i might be interested in management."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,PopeSleepy,7,Tue Mar 3 18:38:18 2015 UTC,True! And omg I almost forgot about the safety ones. I hate to be a snitch but my store did not follow a lot of those safety rules. If we took our time like the video said we would be in for a coaching. We stood up on pallets to reach high shelving. Anything to get stuff done really fast.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,spearchuckin,7,Tue Mar 3 17:43:53 2015 UTC,I'm nearly certain that the only time anything is done by the books at any store is when it's being audited.

IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,ianufyrebird,18,Tue Mar 3 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"Your husband isn't irrational for hating that big blue store. (Well, unless his reasoning is irrational...)  Ethically it's a pretty horrible business, both in how it treats suppliers and how it treats employees. California is actually considering/looking at fining them something like $5000 per employee that is on public assistance, because so many of their employees (nationwide!) qualify for public assistance.  Meaning they don't pay living wages. Period. They just don't. But they rake in the money.  Going back to the supplier thing, they use their purchasing power to strongarm deals on stuff they want to buy. It's not ""Hey, we'd like to carry widget in our stores, how much for thirty million of them?""  It's ""Hey, we're prepared to spend n dollars for thirty million widgets."" Where n dollars could very well be lower than the break-even cost of widgets.  They also lie to county and city councils to get sweetheart tax deals. They'll stay in that location until the tax deal/subsidy expires, then they'll close that store and move into one they just happened to build across the relevant boundary line. (county, city, whatever.)  They also put local businesses out of business, and ship their profits out of the area. All in all, they are very bad for local economies. Low wages, ethically lacking tax deals they not-quite-renege on, and they drive down wages and productivity.   In short, that business is a cancer on the citizenry."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xs9ft,inthrees,8,Tue Mar 3 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"The sad part is that it would cost them more than $5000/employee to pay their employees living wages, so they will happily pay that fine instead."

If by ""up front"" you mean courtesy, well, they're not really supposed to except to go on a register. Yes it sucks but at least the electronics one makes sense because it's an extremely high theft area.  Not trying to start anything, just saying that the people in those areas aren't allowed to leave and it's not their fault. At least where I live all these stores are extremely understaffed. For the past while I've pretty much been alone on one side of the big stores. I regularly cover the home area, crafts, sports and hardware. Sometimes pets, seasonal and toys as well. It sucks. I can't help everyone (though I try my best)."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,i_prefer_tea,97,Tue Mar 3 16:53:33 2015 UTC,Wow. I have never actually be so angry at a stupid customer before. This genuinely makes me so infuriated I don't even know what to do. The audacity of some entitled people just baffles me. I am genuinely mad at that stupid woman. Hope your days get a little easier!
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,Kazumara,23,Tue Mar 3 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  I don't know if I would have possibly been able to restrain myself if someone grabbed anything on my body in that situation, on or off the clock.  SL may have received a reflexive pimp slap."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,budgiebum,50,Tue Mar 3 00:10:28 2015 UTC,Thanks. It was a while ago and it's easier now to go into that store. It took a lot of work to get there though. I've been doing good lately. :)
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,tdogg8,43,Tue Mar 3 03:07:16 2015 UTC,"Trigger three. Grab my lanyard and pull on it, in effect strangling me. We have a winner folks! She Hulk is now engaged! Warning! Warning!   Uh, even without that being a trigger for you, this woman-thing put her hands on you and got 110% of what she deserved.   they took pictures of my neck and SL got a nice new pair of stainless steel bracelets.   that was just so creamy delicious. I'm glad you weren't badly hurt and didn't actually kill her. I am so sorry that happened to you, but I'm so glad you have your super BH to support you. He sounds ABSOLUTELY amazing.   But honestly what made this woman think she could put her hands on anyone? If someone puts their hands on me and i am an employee at wherever, we're both probably going to jail because I will fuck them up. I don't have PTSD, but I do have BPD and the yelling/touching also set me off. I totally feel for you, and I'm truly sorry :("
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,MaraSargon,23,Tue Mar 3 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I wish that I hadn't reacted like I did. When I get triggered it's a horrible thing as I don't have any control over how I react. I wish I could have been the one to tell her off and not acted physically towards her. You have BPD like me, you know how that little voice in our heads doesn't say ""Oh, that might be a bad idea! Walk away!"" rather it usually says ""DO EEEET! You know you wanna! Gogogogogogogo!"" :P"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,tremblane,9,Tue Mar 3 09:22:05 2015 UTC,"I understand it's a total impulse that's pretty much out of your control. The fact that you regret it really shows your humanity.   And yeah, my little voice usually tells me to flee the situation in a heartbeat. Absolutely hahaha. I imagine if I were being choked by someone grabbing something I'm wearing and can't get away, I'd have the same impulse reaction you did.  You and I know that it is NOT okay to put your hands on other without their consent. It's really that woman's own fault she ended up in jail and on probation. I'm super glad the authorities could see that."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,Insanedeblade,10,Tue Mar 3 13:13:30 2015 UTC,Amen to that. I was sexually assaulted when I was 20 in a walmart parking lot. I broke the guys face (I assume) slamming his face into the car next to mine. I scrambled into my car and peeled out of that parking lot and didn't look back. I do NOT like being touched by people I don't know.

I just don't like hugs. On occasion, I'll sit one out and pour all my love into that hug, but I'd really much rather be by myself."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,WhackTheSquirbos,9,Tue Mar 3 11:50:07 2015 UTC,this woman-thing put her hands on you and got 110% of what she deserved   Actually I'd say she only got about 70% of what she deserved I would have loved if she had gotten smacked around a little for her assault.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,coffeeismysoul,6,Thu Mar 5 16:45:40 2015 UTC,I'd love to know how long her probation was for though. Don't people have to pay some sort of fee to their P.O. for being on parole as well? I sure hope so.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,SaYwHAt7,3,Tue Mar 3 11:34:37 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'd be able to restrain myself if someone did that to me. I'm usually pretty patient and can take shit from a customer but I draw the line at choking

IDontWorkHereLady,2xpw9p,made_this_at_5am,18,Mon Mar 2 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"I give you many many hugs. I have not been able to get diagnosed with anything...money or insurance for doctors and stuff...but I'm pretty sure my anxiety with social confrontations comes from a form of PTSD. I grew up in a home with a lot of abuse, so yelling or threatening me is something I just cannot handle at all. But my reaction is directly to cry uncontrollably...like almost pass out 'cause I can't breathe type crying. I'm  so so so sorry for what you went through, but inside I'm a little happy that lady got lunged at. And I say that because people get some kind of satisfaction with making others cry. It was totally deserving of what she got and that ONTOP of getting slapped with the law will make her think twice about treating another human being that way. Also...I love her 'oh shit' moment of realizing she's not entitled to anything. Yes!!! Even if you HAD worked there, she had no right to touch you or scream at you and everything that happened to her still should have happened.  I hope this never ever happens to you again<3 Kudos for having such an amazing, understanding guy!"

I do hope that you get there sometime soon in the future!  I have two reactions depending on the triggers. If she hadn't grabbed my lanyard I probably would have turned into a blubbering mess and hyperventilated myself into unconsciousness too!

IDontWorkHereLady,2xnq40,IAmAWizard_AMA,12,Thu Mar 5 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"I work for a bus company and part of my job is to fuel the gasoline powered vehicles we have, we have about 17 (4 minivans, 3 mini coaches, 10 small ""special ed"" school busses).   So for about 2 1/2 hours a day I drive to and from a local gas station to fuel up the vehicles. Part of my routine as the gas is pumping I check the washer fluid by visually looking at the tank, we have a large tank of it back at the yard. I have been doing this for about 3 1/2 years and every 4-6 months the following situation happens:   I am at a gas station filling up a vehicle and have the hood open to check the windshield washer level. As I close the hood I hear someone (always a woman) from the next pump over ask me what I was doing with the hood open.   ""Checking the washer fluid"" I plainly say.   ""Well when you pump my gas can you check mine? Thanks.""   Puzzled I ask ""What do you mean pump your gas?""   She instantly gets that angry look that I know all too well, driving a bus and interacting with parents of 45 kids, working a year in fast food and a year in retail taught me that face, ""You are an employee here, I need help pumping my gas, now please tell me why you don't know how to do your job!""   This is a moment I have been waiting for the whole time I've been in the service industry but couldn't do because I need a job. I prepare my most neutral tone of voice possible, think Ben Stien. ""Lady, I don't work here. Pump your own gas.""   Turned around and finished the vehicle I was fueling, slowly hung the nozzle, got the receipt and wrote the vehicle number on it and got in the vehicle and drove off. I could see the lady in my side mirrors as I was leaving angrily getting out of her car to get her own gas."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,calladus,154,Mon Mar 2 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"Haha! That was great. People can be such assholes when they're convinced they're right about something.  This reminds me of this time I was working at a toy store in the mall. We had just gotten in a new shipment, so we were carrying boxes down through the mall's hallways. We had to use a service elevator to go up and down since we were on the lower level and the truck was on the upper level. (The mall was situated on a hill, so in some places, the second floor is on ground level and in others, the first floor is on ground level.)  Anyway, we were going in teams and one point, but somehow I ended up by myself for one trip. In the middle of the night with the mall practically closed and most of the people already gone, the phone in the freight elevator started to ring. Normally, I would ignore it, but I was worried it was mall security wanting to chew us out for using the elevator or someone in maintenance warning us not to use it. Something. My mind was throwing out all kinds of crazy scenarios in the few seconds that the phone was ringing.  Finally, I gave in and answered the phone.  Me: Uh...hello?  Them: Hello, sir. Would you be interested in taking a survey.  Me: pausing to comprehend what I had heard. Excuse me, this line is for emergencies. You actually just called a freight elevator.  There was silence for a second and then a click. I had never heard someone hang up that fast.  Edit: A couple of missing words."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,ThatIckyGuy,34,Mon Mar 2 05:44:10 2015 UTC,Why on earth would the emergency phone in the freight elevator have a direct outside line?
IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,VeteranKamikaze,37,Mon Mar 2 08:28:46 2015 UTC,"Every elevator our company owns has a direct outside line so that they can call straight back to their emergency support centre.  It doesn't go through voip or a pabx because of the ""emergency"" factor. This gives the phone the best chance of working.   What if it goes via a voip bridge or pabx and there's a power outage and the bridging equipment fails? Your screwed and sitting in a big steel box that may or may not get sign enough signal for you to make a call with your mobile."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,smoike,7,Mon Mar 2 08:35:36 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's a fair point, normally you'd do a direct line to security rather than the outside but if you don't have a security booth that's manned 24/7 I suppose a direct outside line is the best solution."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,VeteranKamikaze,13,Mon Mar 2 09:25:32 2015 UTC,Because its important for them to work when a power failure that kills the elevator. It's quite likely that the same power failure will kill your office's internal PABX.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,bofh,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:42:27 2015 UTC,This.  Even if the pbx is up how the fuck can you call emergency services if you can only call internal lines?  Don't try and say call a coworker because there are plenty of elevators that the public uses.  What a maroon.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,fahque,-1,Thu Mar 12 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"Well a dedicated direct line sure, but to a security phone, not to the outside. As I said in another post though not all buildings have 24/7 security so in those cases it makes good sense."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xmw8y,RooblesOnReddit,69,Mon Mar 2 06:36:51 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly a debt collector. They won't take 'no' for an answer, because they just assume that the person they called is hiding from them. A few years back, I had one call on my son's cell phone.  ""Let me talk to Tim"".  ""There is no Tim here. You have the wrong number.""  ""Yeah, right. Put Tim on the line right now.""  ""There is no Tim at this house. There never was. Somebody gave you the wrong number.""  ""Stop covering for him. Put him on the line or else.""  This went on for a while until I hung up. Sure, enough, he called again. I hung up again. After a few days, I had enough.  ""Let me speak to Tim.""  ""What is you name and company address?""  ""Why do you need to know that? Just put Tim on the line.""  ""Because this phone belongs to a twelve-year-old boy, and I want to know where to send the cops.""  That was the last I heard from them."

And then what?  Hack the modem?  We had a contract with USR,  I would have seen it back to them for failure analysis, and got a replacement.

IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,volatile_bit,51,Mon Mar 2 12:33:32 2015 UTC,"Its Lent. The space between Ash Wednesday and Easter. Catholics practice Lent. All the fast food places in America have stupid ""sales"" on fish sandwiches, no meat on Friday during Lent, but according to Catholics, fish isn't meat and therefore they can eat it on Lent Fridays. OP was stating s/he bought the fish bc they like it, not bc they're required to."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,LadyLouCup,27,Mon Mar 2 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"Louisiana resident here.  I find it funny that we have Mardi Gras, which was originally intended as a day of excess to ""get it out of your system"" before all the fasting and sacrifice of Lent.  Except the only ""sacrifice"" is eating fish on Fridays for a few weeks. Which is what many of us here eat EVERY day of the week.  So the facade of why we celebrate Mardi Gras is a sham. The real reason is because we'll take any excuse to get drunk and ogle titties."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,Maclimes,17,Mon Mar 2 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"Roman Catholics, as well as some other Christian denominations, also perform some kind of penance for Lent. Most people give something up for Lent, but if you can't think of something to give up, you can take something on. So people might give up sugar, or fast by eating only one large meal a day, or quit smoking for the 40 days, etc. Or they might go to church daily instead of weekly, or buy a couple extra cans every time they go grocery shopping and donate the extras to a food bank, or it could be as simple as washing the dishes every night immediately after dinner. So if you're someone who celebrates Easter and acknowledges Lent, it's not only about eating fish once a week."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,Furthea,3,Mon Mar 2 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"Catholics do this thing called Lent where they cant eat meat in Fridays, which is why all fast food restaurants have deals on fish this time of year."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,Furthea,-9,Mon Mar 2 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"In all curiosity and not intending to come across as angry or confrontational about it, I'm deeply confused as to why you decided to include such an irrelevant/silly bit of trivia. It never would have occurred to me that religion had anything to do what what food you ordered, especially in the confines of an online forum where you could be working any town/city in the world that happens to have fast-food places."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,Furthea,4,Mon Mar 2 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"Ordering fish on a Friday after Mardi Gras is a very, very Catholic thing. Fast food restaurants push these sandwiches with the intent of getting business from those practicing lent, and this restaurant only carries them during lent. I'm not practicing lent. If you think someone's religion is trivial that's on you, but I didnt want to accidentally portray myself as someone I'm not."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,Furthea,-6,Mon Mar 2 22:08:19 2015 UTC,didnt want to accidentally portray myself as someone I'm not.   But that's the problem I'm having. Why in the world do you think that anyone here would assume that you're religion had anything to do with it? If you hadn't brought it up it never would have been a matter of point.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,Naomi_DerRabe,3,Tue Mar 3 00:39:05 2015 UTC,Buying fish on a Friday during lent is a super super Catholic thing. I don't know what part of that you're not getting.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,MisterFiend,-3,Tue Mar 3 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'm entirely aware that Catholics have this Lent thing and that fish is a part of it. My problem isn't the fucking lent/fish. The issue isn't the LENT/FISH connection!  My problem is why the hell you bothered to mention it. No one here gives a damn whether you're ordering fish because your catholic or because you simply like the dish.  SO what part of ""Why do you feel it's the least bit important to mention"" is going over your head?"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,SilentDis,6,Tue Mar 3 01:33:34 2015 UTC,Because I'm not a Catholic. Wtf are you so upset about?
IDontWorkHereLady,2xnhx9,mike413,-4,Tue Mar 3 01:44:44 2015 UTC,Because no one here cares what your religion is or isn't. It is entirely *irrelevant * to the rest of your story and I was very curious as to why you felt the unnecessary need to bring it up.

Our manager comes up to me and says, ""You know I have to fire him, right?"" It wasn't so much the smoking or making out because it was funny and we were dead.

There's a logic, but it's totally wrong. That's a higher form of madness, right there. ""Purple Hair = Employee""? I can't even fathom it."

According to the report ""Aging, Inhibition, and Social Inappropriateness"" (PDF) published by the American Psychological Association:  ""This study explores the hypothesis that age-related declines in inhibitory ability are associated with increases in socially inappropriate behavior.""  ""Consistent with this hypothesis, older participants were less likely than younger participants to differentiate between public and private settings when inquiring about potentially embarrassing issues, according to their peers.""  ""Finally, this age-related increase in social inappropriateness was mediated by inhibitory deficits associated with aging. These results suggest that age-related deficits in inhibitory ability may cause people to become socially inappropriate against their will."""

I'm not the type of person who would just snap on a stranger, but experience has taught me some people go about their days so tense and upset that the tiniest stress like waiting for coffee is the last straw.

My husband has been mistaken for a worker at my store and has never worn anything close to our uniform. He also looks a little bit like a hobo most of the time.  I think my downfall outside of work is that I now smile at strangers and look them in the eye out of reflex, but I've also been minding my own business and browsing myself and been approached.

I don't see why you'd assume a homeless guy was insane for possibly not knowing how to read or being mistaken by what's available.

I guess this time he wanted something new and didn't know how much it cost. It may just be someone else or a matter of coincidence (it may not even be the right Carl's location), but pretty cool that it may be him."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,xiaz_ragirei,9,Sun Mar 1 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those company shirts tend to be the cheapest, most uncomfortable crap they could get - so undershirts are a must. Get used to stripping down after your shift."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,roselover58,2,Sun Mar 1 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"My shirts aren't that uncomfortable. They just tailor them short for my taste.  As far as stripping goes, my shifts are outside.

IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,roselover58,37,Sun Mar 1 15:03:28 2015 UTC,Nature of security. And I could shop the just not wearing my uniform shirt. I normally had an undershirt on unless I was wearing my bicycle/parking lot patrol shirt.
IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,nod23,26,Sun Mar 1 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"They had a problem with him going around wearing his security uniform while off duty, not that he was shopping off duty. Lose the security shirt/uniform and you can do what you want. But when you advertise you are working for company X, you are still representing them even while off the clock, which can lead to confusion. Same reason they REALLY don't like police officers wearing their uniform off duty. Your advertising your a cop, but you don't officially have the capacity to serve as a law enforcement agent because your not on duty."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,Sasparillafizz,4,Sun Mar 1 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  I do shopping on the way home and I have my polo shirt on, with the name of the company.  I also am aware of that, and make sure that I behave (not that I don't behave, but..)"
IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,Janusdarke,2,Sun Mar 1 22:52:03 2015 UTC,you don't officially have the capacity to serve as a law enforcement agent because your not on duty.   Are you sure about that?
IDontWorkHereLady,2xkabj,da_kink,2,Tue Mar 3 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Apologies, your right, they CAN do so. But its usually discouraged because doing so while off duty opens them up to a swatch of civil liabilities including search and seizure, use of force (including deadly force) and vehicular accidents, among others. if the officer is for example doing side job as security, which uniform overrides the other? As a security officer can he conduct search and seizures because he is also a cop? Can he make an arrest and process himself, or can he only detain and hand them over to another officer on arrival? What about use of force? My state is basically the opposite of castle law, its a civilians duty to escape danger, if you have a reasonable avenue of escape your supposed to run rather than get permission to fight back. So no lethal force self defense until you are cornered. Does the officer get that right while off duty? It gets murky in civil courts when you wear two hats, which is why most officers are told not to do it except when there is serious danger."

They probably had some sort of system where you had to use an employee number or name in order to provide the discount. Perhaps a manager had to approve it, as well. Even when I worked in an ice cream shop, we still had to write down the employee's name or management would not be happy, so I assume management at a pet shop would be more upset."

Well, I met Amy (we did look ridiculously similar) at an Allies and Queers meeting. We were all sitting on the floor kind of haphazardly, with me sitting slightly behind her with another girl between us. A girl who went in to kiss me because she forgot which side her girlfriend was sitting on, and I must have been on the edge of her vision. Amy, I think was trying to murder me with her eyes. Over the next two years Amy gained a lot of weight (important to story) so I showed up in the lunchroom my senior year only to have the lunch lady tell me ""Wow! You lost a lot of weight over the summer!""  Then I went to the local Blue Wall and saw ANOTHER girl who looked exactly like Amy and I.

I wish some customer would grab me in a place where I don't work. ""Yes ma'am, I'd be glad to find you a manager."" And when you talk to the manager, tell them you'd like to press charges.   It might sound extreme, but if the situation were reversed, and you walked up to some mombie in a Target and grabbed her arm, she'd definitely sic the law on you."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xc4f9,crymson7,16,Fri Feb 27 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"You also have a right to defend yourself.  Considering OP said that this lady was actually causing her/him harm, s/he had the full and inalienable right to remove that threat to her/his well being.  A simple smack on the arm would have done just fine, especially due to there being a witness."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xc4f9,jeff_in_a_box,6,Sat Feb 28 12:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yelling ""Don't touch me"" is also a good idea, so that witnesses are aware that you were defending yourself and not randomly hitting someone."
IDontWorkHereLady,2xc4f9,I_am_jacks_reddit,25,Sun Mar 15 22:27:44 2015 UTC,Agreed 100%.I actually had this exact conversation with my girlfriend today who is an actual feminist and not a femnazi.  I asked her if it was sexist to not press charges just because she was a woman. She laughed and just went to work. It was good times messing with her.

Calling his ""cosplay"" 'Poorly thought out, cheapass materials, fakeass looking gun' etc.  The cop was awesome, and turned to the neckbeard and said ""Well, the funny thing is my department only pays for the cheap shit. Enjoy your convention."" Cue perfectly timed burst of chatter over the radio, and the dude finally figured it out and scurried away."

IDontWorkHereLady,2xbuq8,kinyutaka,76,Fri Feb 27 13:18:04 2015 UTC,"I thought of it, it was a long time ago, and was a little different then. She actually kind of laughed after she realized her mistake. It was like a verbal slap. There was no google on your phone for one thing. So even if she had got my company, all she would be able to find was some office numbers, we are never at, and maybe corporate number. Then she would have to explain a guy, with some other people was rude to her, in a city we don't have an office. The managers were also pretty lax as long as you didn't do something at the actual job site. I am older, and more mature now, and really it was like a one in a lifetime chance to do something like that.    Example we staying at a hotel, and one of our guys asked the hotel security guy if he could borrow his gun, so he could go buy crack with it. Security guy couldn't id him, so we couldn't fire him. Unfortunately."

IDontWorkHereLady,2vyx9f,flunkhaus,53,Sun Feb 15 13:46:35 2015 UTC,I didn't recognize her because as a theater cashier you go through people so quickly that often you don't really pay any attention to the specific person.   For any retail employee ever.
IDontWorkHereLady,2vyx9f,techiejames,13,Mon Feb 16 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"I got to know a lot of the regulars that came into the restaurant I worked at. There were a few that would always request my section. There were also regulars that all the servers would fight over or bribe the hostess to seat them in our section because we knew they tipped well. There were also customers that we would try and pass around like hot potatoes because they didn't tip well or were diners from hell.   It really was beneficial to take note of regulars. If someone is notorious for leaving bad tips then it just wasn't worth putting in extra effort to try and make them happy. This effect is multiplied if the customer is extremely rude or difficult.   That being said, the vast majority of customers are just blurs. I have definitely had to bullshit my way through awkward conversations where the customer clearly knew me and had sat in my section before. It made me feel horrible when someone went through the trouble of requesting my section, even waiting longer than they would have had to otherwise just to have me as a server, and then I wasn't able to remember them."

When I was waiting in line to buy some workout gear at the store that begins with a ""K"" and rhymes with ""bowls"", there was a young boy of about 10 years of age waiting in line in front of me. It was a Sunday, so I believed he was dressed in a suit for morning Mass and probably headed to the store with his mom afterwards.  An elderly woman behind me began to tell me how she thought he worked at the store the whole time until she heard the boy call out to his mother in his pre-pubescent voice. It was hilarious because he looked like a small boy in a suit a size too big. Perhaps a hand-me-down from an older sibling. The woman said he was too well-behaved. Maybe you were very well behaved for what that woman expected 10 year olds to act like? Makes you wonder about people's expectations for children."

IDontWorkHereLady,2up5is,kitty_kat_,14,Thu Mar 5 17:43:49 2015 UTC,This is off topic but your vernacular sounds/reads like you definitely don't live around the west coast. Maybe somewhere in the southern states?

IDontWorkHereLady,2up8ij,GoHomeToby,6,Wed Feb 4 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"Forget about green tea. I say this as someone from Yorkshire, in England. What we don't know about tea hasn't been invented yet. It doesn't taste great on its own, and its purported health benefits are questionable at best.  Get yourself some proper, solid, black teas. For an ""ohgod, I want to be back in bed, but I have to work"" tea, I like an Assam tea. For a more relaxed drink later in the afternoon, Ceylon is good. I've never been much of a fan of Earl Grey on its own, but you can get a nice one with citrus infusions that's quite tasty. English Breakfast is appropriate at all times of the day.  This is all based on teas available in the UK (Twinings, specifically, is my preferred brand), so your mileage may vary in other countries. Hopefully it gives you an idea of where you might start on a good cup of tea, though.  (Brewing notes: brew with the teabag in a cup of boiling (not warm - boiling) water for between 30s and 2 minutes, depending on how strong you want the tea to taste. Most of the caffeine is transferred to the water in the first 20s, so it doesn't get substantially stronger caffeine-wise the longer you brew. You can add milk and sugar to taste, but I personally don't. If you do, add it after you've brewed the tea and removed the teabag. Don't leave the teabag in the cup while you drink it; that's for barbarians.)"
IDontWorkHereLady,2up8ij,GoHomeToby,3,Wed Feb 4 21:59:23 2015 UTC,Update: bought earl grey (someone at store said its slightly bitter taste was better if you were just starting out?) And tried it. 5 sugars and a bit of cooling off makes this my new snack drink! Thanks!

The regulars knew where everything was, and a few (like me) were even allowed to work the register.  Before anyone asks, no, AJ wasn't allowed to work the register.

Maybe if he actually did some damage rather than scamper off when he realized a half dozen bystanders and a car had stopped around us I'd be more inclined. At that point I just wanted to go home, and if he came back to the store I'd ban his ass. THEN police if he didn't leave. He can go to a different store in our chain."

So, technically, you can work 2 hours a day and get for the 40, but it never works that way - it's almost always we work more and get paid for the 40.  My staff gets overtime, which I hate, because I have to be there too.  They get the time and a half, and I don't.  It's legal."

The pickups were Seymour Duncan Antiquity II Jazz pickups. They are not hard to find in online stores but very hard to find good clips of people playing bass with them installed. They are not anywhere near as popular as other Seymour Duncan pickups or others like Fralins, Bartolinis or EMGs.  It had the perfect amount of controlled low end, growly mid, perfect treble twang for slap/pop (just enough). It was great and the whole bass was like $250. The pickups new are $180 alone! I was far poorer back then; if I saw that bass now I'd buy it in a heartbeat. My current bass is a Schecter Stilletto Elite-4 that I've had forever. I couldn't sell it for anything but it does not accept jazz pickups. :("

Store clerk who helped me find my item was able to explain how vendors send people to stock.    Tldr: Keeping my mouth shut kept me from making me look like a fool... at least that time."

I also made it a point to always have ear buds in with music while I was working to make sure that people didn't try to talk to me.   Love that manager's response, greatness."
IDontWorkHereLady,2tm2ch,Face_Plont,16,Sun Jan 25 19:23:15 2015 UTC,Being a vendor myself ive come in with a zipped up coat and earbuds clearly in while working away at a planogram. I know the golden rule of never making eye contact so while looking down at my project i saw a pair of legs stop about 5 feet from me. Kept my head down but after a couple minutes i finally look up and see the customer has been talking to me the whole time... its as if my ear buds went right over their head and she didnt understand i couldnt hear her that entire time. She went and complained to one of their workers that i was ignoring her and it was poor customer service

On ship A, they had all the great leaders, scientists, and achievers.   On Ship C, they had all the people who do things and make things happen. Farmers, engineers, etc.   And on Ship B, they stuck all the other people, such as hairdressers and telephone sanitizers.

The most effective thing to do I learned when in retail is a gentle touch of the shoulder to indicate I had to get past. That or saying excuse me and waiting for the person responding which isn't nearly as effective and saves saying you have to get past and where you're going. A light tap says you're in the way and you're going around from that side. Where I live it's common to block iles and shoppers aren't the most attentive creatures.

But getting pissy and grabbing someone for no reason? At that point my only warning to someone is to get REALLY LOUD real fast. Draws attention to me and the other person, and nine times out of then the person who grabbed you will let go.

There's poo somewhere around you and you're in peril of stepping on it at any moment, so walk gingerly and be ever ready for poo shoe.  It's like that. But constantly. The poo never goes away.

IDontWorkHereLady,2sancq,JohnoTheFoolish,15,Wed Jan 14 00:09:13 2015 UTC,Tea is serious business What kind of grocery store doesn't have those little signs above the aisles saying what is in them?
IDontWorkHereLady,2sancq,esterhause47,20,Tue Jan 13 20:51:40 2015 UTC,I completely agree. The signs were likely there but of course customers can't read.
IDontWorkHereLady,2sancq,adriardi,4,Wed Jan 14 02:32:12 2015 UTC,Sometimes things are placed weirdly or differently in different stores. It's not like the signs list each individual item. I had trouble finding peanut butter in this one store.

I hate coming to this store, because every time I do, everything's been moved all around!    Ugh. As a retail employee, I really hate this. For one thing, I didn't personally move the items! Secondly, if you can read and realise that cold things go in the fridge, frozen items go in the freezer and hot food go into warmers, and everything else is on a shelf, then you re pretty much set on finding what you need.  I can usually walk into any grocery store and find everything I need within 10 minutes. The only issue after that is the queue at the checkout."

I had a 7 and 12 year old with me, we were all in full winter gear as it was 17 degrees (F) outside and we were getting ready to leave.

IDontWorkHereLady,2rycp8,Pelagine,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:45:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the U.S. Marshals Service is tasked with security for Federal Courthouses. They've been tightening security features since the early 1990's, at least.   Metal detectors, separate entrances for judges and defendants, armed marshals, plus architecture designed to minimize violence are all pretty standard.   Anyone with business inside the complex will have to go through security. It's a pain, but so are the number of attacks on and in federal courts.   These are the judges that hear racketeering and terrorism cases, so the stakes are high and the possibility of violence that interferes with the case is a real concern.   Earlier, in the '90's, there was more concern about anti-government organizations and individuals orchestrating violent attacks like the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995."
IDontWorkHereLady,2rycp8,songoku9001,70,Fri Jan 16 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"So sometime last year I was paying a visit to my local Social Security place so I could get a new SSN card. I work for a private security company, and after my stop at the SS office I would be heading to work, so naturally I just wore my suit, tie and my ID badge.   I took a number and patiently waited (there were very few seats available, and the ones that were, available were right next to someone, I like my space so I just decided to stand). I decided to stand next to the door with my hands behind my back, which has basically become second nature to me.  Next to the door there are 2 security guards at/near a desk and they go on as usual. Both of these guards are wearing all black, as well as a plate carrier (Kevlar vest) with a big ole white ""DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY"" patch on the front, along with cuffs, a rase and a sidearm. Eventually one of them leaves (dunno why), leaving just the other officer there. As time goes on the place gets extremely crowded so I kind of manoeuvre myself to make more room for people.   There was an older gentleman who was being talked to by the officer about how he has to put his knife back in his vehicle, guy gets pissy with her (the officer) and starts throwing a fit. I catch the kind of looking at me out of the corner of my eye and we exchange glances for a quick second and he then complies, I'm a larger guy, so I can kind of understand(I'm a gentle giant, really) and didn't make much of it, but little did I know, this is where it all began. After the guy came in he quietly walked to the other side of the room and didn't look at me, or the officer, I'm assuming out of embarrassment for looking like a jackass in front of a bunch of people.   About 20 minutes later the last remaining officer leaves for some reason, and it's just innocent me conveniently standing right next to the security desk. My total wait time was about an hour and a half or so. While the officer was gone I was faced with new people coming in and asking me a sorts of questions, ranging from ""Where's the bathroom?"" to, and I quote, ""How in the donkey fuckin world does this gat dang murrchine work?!""(referring to the machine where you setup an appointment and and get your ticket). At this point I pretty much assumed my new position as their security, and no one really thought twice about it, which I thought was kinda cool.   After donkey - fucker (DF)  gets his ticket and starts waiting this girl comes, gets her ticket and asks me if I can hold on to it while she waits outside due to her anxiety issues and get her when they call her. No problem I've been here a while anyway, if I'm late for work I'll just explain that the SS office was really busy, management is pretty cool and doesn't get mad as long as you're not late regularly, so what the hell?   Few minutes pass and the actual security lady comes back out and she's kind of giggling to herself and asked how many people thought I worked here. We had a small laugh and she thanked me for ""keeping a presence while she was gone"" we began to bs for a while and what seemed to be kind of flirting.   All of as suddenly  guy comes out of the hall way and calls for a woman's name about 5+ times, since the lady who gave me her ticket didn't have an appointment setup prior I didn't think much of it, and they were all calling people by numbers. My number is finally called, before going up to the help desk I give the lady's ticket to the security woman and explain, she says she'll do it, and asks to talk to me after I take care of my stuff.   I go up to the help desk, and my SSN card is getting mailed out, finally. I walk back to go talk to the officer and she just wants to talk to me more (because I'm apparently pretty cool to talk to) and the lady with the anxiety problem walks in and wants to know if she was called yet, security chick looks at her ticket and tells her not yet, but immediately follows up with ""Wait! Are you Miss blahblahblah?"" And to my dismay she answered yes.   At that very moment my heart sank and I began to apologize like there's no tomorrow. Security lady keeps telling me it's not my fault and she didn't tell me they'd call her name and not a number. I swiftly made my exit through the door and had a cigarette. To my surprise DF comes out for one too and starts ranting about the wait time and asks me why ""I ain't in thurr doin muh gat fuggin dern jawb"". I tell him ""Umm I don't work here, I just needed my social security card.."" to which he replies ""Well sheeeiiit, ya fuggin look like it that's fo sho"". Yes he really said ""fo sho"". It was a pretty interesting day to say the least.  Tl;dr unintentionally impersonated a federal agent, flirted with a real federal agent, and possibly royally fucked up by not telling someone they were called up."

It's easier for many people to be told what to think rather than to figure it out for their own selves.  You also don't have to vote if you don't want to. You can turn up and have your name checked off, then pretend to fill in the form, or file a donkey vote, or just not turn up on the day at all. If you pick that last option, you'll cop a fine."

I hear do many fights between him and his sister where she says something that upsets him and he flies of the handle even though she repeats time and time again that she didn't mean it in the way he heard it. ""Yes you did!""  No.  If you take offense at something after you've verified that it was a simple misunderstanding or communication error then you're an idiot.  In this particular case it's just a simple misunderstanding. It's perfectly believable to make a misunderstanding based on race, it's only racism if, after having the error pointed out, you reply ""whatever slant eyes. Get your yellow ass back there and get my order. Do I look like someone who gives a fuck what kind of nip you are?"" instead of ""oh, God, I'm sorry.""  Racism is where they look you in the eye and say it straight to your face and let you know they mean it."

I was in a foul mood, and wearing a hoody and jeans in a conscious effort to not look like I worked there (not my first trip there.) Four separate people come up and ask me if I work there, and half of them won't take no for an answer. I storm over to where my wife is, and am in mid rant about the idiocy of customers. Another person has the gall to interrupt my rant to ask if I can help them find something. I whip off my hoody, leaving only a wife beater on. Jeans, combat boots, wife beater. I look trailer trash as opposed to retail, and I have a glare on my face that would curdle milk. And still, as we walk to the registers, another person opens their mouth with a cud-chewingly stupid inquisitive look on their face.

Even the most miserable customers seem to lack the balls to give me the same bullshit they'll pull on the girls working there.  Also, I've worked in much more stressful places, like rides at Disney World and Universal. Craft store customers aren't shit compared to a guy who takes a swing at you because a ride is broken down.

I'll just leave it here as a comment.  I was in my first month as a photographer at MGM, standing near the front of the park. Now, about 20 to 30 feet to my left are the restrooms, with a sign that, surprisingly, says ""Restrooms."" A guy walks up to me, points at the door of the men's room, and asks ""Where's the bathroom?!"" I slowly turned, looked at the bathroom and back at him, and said ""You're gonna want to go out the main gate and hop on bus 12. That'll take you over to EPCOT. Go in, past the ball, make a left, and you'll see the restroom next to the wall where the new attraction will be opening in a few weeks."" He proceeded to go to EPCOT to take a dump rather than go to the restroom he just pointed at.  Also, while working rides and standing directly under the wait time sign people would constantly ask me the wait time. I'd always turn and slowly point at the sign like I was trying hard to read and understand it. Then, after an uncomfortable stretch of time, like 30 seconds to a minute, I'd turn back to them and say ""I don't know."" Keeping a straight face was key during that one."

When a customer mistakes you as an employee you are caught off guard and you kind of pause and internally debate whether you can help them (i.e. Do I know where the bird houses are?) and if you do know, whether you should help them (i.e. Should I just pretend to be an employee for a second?). This pausing usually translates to an awkward silence in my experience, and then I usually just mutter ""I don't work here"" awkwardly. Then things are just too awkward."

IDontWorkHereLady,2q93ld,jeff_in_a_box,13,Fri Mar 6 06:04:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing.  On what planet is it ok to grab random people (employees or not) in order to ask for a condiment?
IDontWorkHereLady,2q93ld,WIlf_Brim,6,Wed Dec 24 17:01:29 2014 UTC,Some people don't care about bubbles naturally. It happens a lot with older people so I assume it was a more common and accepted action when they were younger.

Sophomore year of High School, Im with Dad at ""BigBlueStore"" in Hammond,IN, trying to pick out art supplies. I was wearing the Bishop Noll Institute summer uniform. I could not help it that I was still wearing the yellow polo, navy blue shorts, and the high school ID tag. A customer asked me if I work there.

It's like everyone is oblivious to the fact that trucks can make overnight deliveries to a store and a team of people still have to unload and stock everything.)  Anyways, I was shopping at ""Red and Khaki"" in broad daylight on my day off that was not the same location I worked at. I was clearly not in uniform whatsoever, definitely not even the required nametag. Seriously, a purple T-shirt, jeans, and frizzy hair is not the dayside uniform. I had taken off my coat and pushed my cart to the side of the Cspotsave aisle. A sarcasticly political Mark Twain quote was clearly on my purple T-shirt. I was putting a product back because it looked broke. It caused me to re-arrange something in order to look for an unbroken product. And then I heard, ""Excuse me. EXCUSE ME! Do you work here?

No, they simply feel more entitled, but they're not aware. I was putting back a jar of glaze or clay softener, whatever it was.....And I heard it again. ""Do you work here?""

IDontWorkHereLady,2pn5xr,itsableeder,4,Sun Dec 28 15:47:29 2014 UTC,Zip is used alternatively to pin. Zip is usually used only if you run it as credit. Pin is if you run it as debit.

Zip code is the postal code for the neighborhood, and is used to verify credit cards. It is matched to the billing address for the card which is a small measure of verification.

IDontWorkHereLady,2ovlni,downhillcarver,6,Wed Dec 10 19:00:27 2014 UTC,"I've had two slightly similar, and flattering, experiences.   First one: I was working as a Barista, I made a customer's drink then chatted with them for a bit. At the end they asked, ""are you the store manager?""  ""Haha, I wish, I'm just a barista. Why do you ask?""   ""oh, you just strike me as management material. Is your manager in?""  ""thank you! Of course, one moment.""  Second story: I'm the branch operator for a Christmas light company. I handle everything from marketing and sales to the actual installation of lights.  I was dressed in torn jeans, dirty hoodie and ratty boots one day as I was to be crawling on roofs, installing lights, and cleaning gutters all day. One of the company founders dropped by. We stood by the street talking business for a bit when someone drove up, rolled down their window, and addressed me. After telling him about the company, he asked, ""are you the owner?""    ""no, he is"" *thumb towards boss*  ""oh, you come across as a business man.""  Why thank you!"

IDontWorkHereLady,2oa6yr,mike413,7,Fri Dec 5 16:21:28 2014 UTC,"Sorted by top of the past month, so its old and will probably not noticed by anyone.   When HH Gregg opens up in an area, they fly out their best sale's people from various parts of the country to really give that store a good kick start.  That means the day it opens, 50% or more of the staff are the best 10% salesmen in the country.  They're being paid commission, plus travel and living expenses.  The idea is after 1 or 3 months, they've made a great impression on the area and have trained the locals on what to do.  Often though, its pure fail once they leave."

I'm originally from red neck country, but years of phone work have trained me to speak ""newscaster,"" which is to say, fairly unaccented speech.

Solipsism itself is just the philosophical belief that because you can only ever experienced the world as yourself, and because you can never know (except by reference or analogy) that other people do, you are therefore the only person in existence. Everything else you encounter can be explained away in various ways, usually as constructs of your own consciousness.

IDontWorkHereLady,2nootj,2nd-Reddit-Account,7,Fri Nov 28 21:19:13 2014 UTC,I suppose it could be hard to understand if you don't have experience in retail. I frequently get asked if I work at my store when I am heading to the break room without a uniform on. I used to help them untill I got the rude ones. I don't understand how someone can not understand that me not getting paid equals them not getting help. And me going out of my way to help them off the clock is an act of kindness. Working in retail has really made me lose faith in the general population.

I hate it when I don't get bothered the whole day, but as soon as I come back from my break room to time in from my lunch break so I don't get in trouble for going over there's a customer in the food section going, ""Hi, can you help me find the (specific L'oreal shampoo type)?"" that's located in the exact opposite side of the store and I look like I don't know a thing about that stuff."

I'm not really complaining as I like most of the regulars and they don't mean any harm, but I find it amusing for sure.  I've been stopped once or twice when not in uniform at a store I don't work at and if I shop there regularly enough, I'll still direct someone where to find what they're looking for (after informing them I don't work there).

As a general rule, courts have  determined that private employers may prohibit employees from  moonlighting and may terminate employees for doing so, unless there is  an agreement otherwise.   However, a few states, such as Colorado and New York, have enacted  statutes that restrict organizations from making employment decisions  based on an employee's lawful off-duty conduct, including outside  employment. These statutes generally allow employers to prohibit  second jobs only when that employment creates a conflict of interest with  the worker's duties to the employer. Accordingly, you should consult  with legal counsel to determine if state restrictions apply.   The ability of public employers to restrict outside employment is more  limited than that of the private sector. For the most part, public  employers must show the need to prevent actual or apparent conflicts of  interest. Even so, these public employers generally may require prior  approval of any outside employment."

Here's a screencap of what I typed in for the samples below.    No extra spaces at the end of the line, hit enter once:  Line 1 Line 1 Line 1  Line 2 Line 2 Line 2  Line 3 Line 3 Line 3    Two spaces at the end of each line, hit enter once:  Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 3 Line 3 Line 3      Hit enter twice:  Line 1 Line 1 Line 1   Line 2 Line 2 Line 2   Line 3 Line 3 Line 3"

Miserable wretch of a manager who snapped at them meant miserable employees. Joking or kind manager meant happy employees.  We called one of their managers Shrek, because he was huge and stank to high heaven and was mean to everyone. His employees cowered in his presence.  One time, when a better manager of theirs was in charge, I was walking toward the back room before we closed, before I was on the clock. This woman in her mid 20s, an inventory employee, marched up to me and said, ""Open up your gosh darn freaking bathroom."" Ok, not quite that, but close, now new and improved with real swear words!  She couldn't have known I worked there! Or, at least, I could have been a customer.  I dismissed it in my mind as a bathroom emergency.  When we all actually started, I didn't see her. I later found out one of her co-workers had witnessed the incident and told the manager. He immediately sent her home."

When a sister store in my area had their inventory coming up myself and two other dudes were sent for a few days to hep get it up to snuff.  Day 1: We get there and are set to zone automotive, it is a complete and total clusterfuck and we spend our first hour getting the batterioes and radios alone fixed when the automotive/hardware/sporting goods/ toys Dept manager comes up to use and explains that there isn't a mod set in the entire department so we can fix it as we see fit, what the fuck you are three days from inventory and don't have a single mod?!?!?!  Day 2: I'm separated from the other two, they are assigned zone housewares/domestics and I am tased with zoning the entirety of toys for the day. There is a huge layer of dust over all the toys, all the shelf labels are ancient and the newest one I found was for over a year beforehand.

IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,NeatG,21,Fri Nov 14 06:45:53 2014 UTC,"Nobody alive today was a slave but racism still has pretty massive repercussions. My favorite argument for this is looking at mortgage disbursements under the GI bill and general red lining after WWII. Black vets had a much tougher time getting a house than white vets did. And when black families bought houses in the 50's (veterans or not) their property values would generally go down due to white flight.  The effect of this is that those whites who were able to buy property and maintain its value were then able to use that equity to put their kids through school, which allowed their kids better opportunities, which led to them buying houses and repeating the cycle. When you compare the families of someone who was able to get a house two generations ago at good value and someone who was not able to get a house at all the difference is pretty staggering."
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,pirate_doug,8,Fri Nov 14 20:43:50 2014 UTC,"That's immaterial.  Even in the post-slavery US, white men calling black men ""boy"" happened.

And when I say ""old enough"", I mean old enough to know not to make a mess or be a bother. She didn't expect employees to look after me, but for me to be mature enough to look after myself.  Things have changed a lot over the last twenty, thirty years. Cases like the Adam Walsh incident (that spawned America's Most Wanted, and Code Adam's in department stores amongst other things) changed our perception."

IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,Dracomax,14,Fri Nov 14 06:44:50 2014 UTC,I hate these idiots. What kind of stupid do you have to be to think that stores are childcare?
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,Namisar,8,Thu Nov 13 14:23:37 2014 UTC,"Former video game store employee here, this is very common. The store I worked at was right next to a Target so many parents would leave their kids at our store and would go shop at Target. It got so bad at one point that we had to put a sign on the front door saying that minors couldn't be left in the store unattended. We had to call the cops a lot because of unattended children who couldn't tell us how to contact their parents. It sucks because you want to be mad but you don't want to direct your anger at the kid, it's not their fault they have shitty parents.  Many times when confronted, parents acted as if they knew what they were doing was shitty, but we occasionally got asshole parents who one way or another implied that we were free babysitters. The best example of this was when this 7 year old boy was left in our store for 2 hours. He said he didn't know where his mom was, she said she was going to go shop but he didn't know where and he didn't have any means of contacting her but he knew he was supposed to stay at the store. This is in December, in the summer we would just tell the kid to sit outside because, again, our company doesn't want minors in the store unattended, it's a liability blah blah blah.  But we couldn't do that to this kid, it was freezing outside and all he was wearing was a long sleeved shirt. He was a pretty decent kid, wasn't annoying or rude and I helped him find a game that was actually good and explained to him that video game cover art is one of the most deceitful art forms there is and that he shouldn't judge any game by what the box looks like.  When the mom finally arrived she asked her son to put back whatever he had and to leave. My manager, who is a father who was in a custody battle at the time, was livid. He quickly said ""Ma'am, you need to pay for your son's charges?""   Mom: What charges?! Did he break something?  Manager: No, but he's been here unsupervised for two hours, it's store policy to kick kids out that don't have adult with them but I couldn't do that to your son in this weather, so we babysat for you! I think $20 an hour is a fair price, so that will be $40.   The woman gave out a short laugh and grabbed her son by the hand and escorted him to the door, obviously not phased by what my manager had said.   Manager: The alternative is that I call the cops and tell them that you are endangering your child by leaving him unsupervised.   That got her attention, she came up to the till and gave my manager a $50 and asked for $10 change, Manager explained he didn't have change for a $10. Mom got mad and asked him to open up our till to make change. Manger lied and said he could only open the till if he made a sale. She gave up and left."
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,Snowfizzle,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:14:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah, now I feel bad for the particular store I go to as they are right on the edge of the lot and the lot was created by raising the grading such that the lot ends with a steep incline down to a main street so asking the children to leave is like telling them to go play in traffic.  In this age of plentiful cellphones it blows my mind that there are children who don't have a way to contact their parents. I seem to remember having learned my home phone number, a pager number for my father and probably a friendly neighbour's phone number for the event I ever found myself stranded somewhere.  Also two hours is really lame, I think if I ever had to keep myself busy for two hours I was given money for an arcade or a movie theater ticket or sent to the library to read."
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,gwynfshae,20,Fri Dec 12 01:20:36 2014 UTC,"That's a felony in my state actually. We just had a girl arrested for leaving her child at the post office. The charge is Abandoning/Endangering a Child. People should call the cops more often when parents do this and it would stop. Most parents can't afford to post bail, pay for a lawyer and get time off work to go to court. Then there's the jail time and/or probation. And having CPS in your life is a huge bitch."
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,iTSurabuS,5,Tue Nov 18 19:02:14 2014 UTC,"I couldn't find any clear law for my area that directly links unattended and abandoned/endangered in terms of leaving a child in a store/department that has children's merchandise. In terms of the gamestore calling the cops, doing it on everyone would run afoul of the honor system as for every child left there for a longer time with no sale there are a large handful who are there for only five-fifteen minutes, actually browsing and then their parent returns and purchases them a game.  I don't know if I would leave my own children in a seperate store but when I was young I would often end up browsing the electronics department of big box store while my mother browsed the clothing departments, simply because neither of us wanted to be taging along while the other did their browsing."
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,hicctl,3,Tue Nov 18 19:32:04 2014 UTC,It's not funning afoul of the honour system. Most parents allow their children the independence to browse at their leisure. He directly put you in charge. That's where the endangerment comes in. He told a stranger to watch his kids.
IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,halcyoncmdr,8,Wed Jan 21 05:11:41 2015 UTC,No no no. You let him leave and simply call the police. He will be arrested for child endangerment.

IDontWorkHereLady,2m5kio,whatnobodyknew,5,Fri Nov 21 10:22:25 2014 UTC,"Unattended children results in me calling security.

I enjoy sticking around to watch the drama, especially when it ends up with a ticket for child endangerment or some such."

In high school we both worked at the movie theater, and he (let's call him Larry) was kind of known for being a smart ass/class clown type. My mom also knew Larry and of his smart ass reputation, and she went to see a movie on a date. She and her date were waiting outside their theater in a line, as customers weren't being allowed in yet. Larry walked by her, so trying to impress her date she called out to him ""Hey, why can't we go in yet?"" and his response was ""Because Jesus doesn't love you"" and he just kept on walking, and everyone else around started laughing. My mom has a pretty good sense of humor and yelled back ""Thanks, you degenerate!"" And then everyone laughed some more. My friend actually claimed he didn't even realize it was my mom asking the question, he thought it was just a customer being annoying, and so he gave a smart ass response. So he was actually quite surprised to hear a smart ass remark in return, and he turned around and saw my mom and they had a good laugh and he told her they were just cleaning the theater.  So anyway, we all thought the whole thing was pretty funny and to this day (this was, holy shit, probably 14 years ago) we will say ""because Jesus doesn't love you"" whenever applicable, and the other person will respond with ""thanks, you degenerate."""

IDontWorkHereLady,2l2z6h,alycenwonder,11,Mon Nov 3 03:13:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it is one of the reasons I now ""dress down"" to go to the store.  It might be because I did retail for so long that I assume the ""retail slave"" posture and mannerisms when I go shopping, or because I am unfailingly polite to any people I encounter calling them Sir or Mam, using a nice tone of voice, saying ""sorry, excuse me"" when walking in front of somebody browsing... the things that stand out from typical customer behavior.  Well, until they give me a reason not to treat them with respect anyway.  So yeah, especially after the incident at the pawn shop, I try to avoid going to the store while still in my dress clothes for work.  I still do if I need something and the store is on my way home from work though.  I was at the music store the other day picking up some sax reeds and guitar strings, and I had an older lady comment that my skull tie was inappropriate for somebody who is selling to the public.  I just told her that I didn't work there, but I could get somebody that did if she needed something.... Turns out she just didn't like my tie and wanted to make a point of that...  I told her I was glad I didn't wear my aborted fetus tie that day, as I doubt she would have liked it.  So now, when shopping with the wife or alone, I just wear my ""house clothes.""  Let's see if anybody is going to ask me where a product is when I'm in a profane t-shirt, martini themed sleeping pants, and my ""disaster crocs.""  Turns out they still will, if not only to try and find out who they need to complain to about the profanity on my shirt (from a local punk band, has the name DUI's, a black and white drawing of a skeleton in a cop hat, and the words GET FUCKED along the bottom...)

IDontWorkHereLady,2l0v4z,pinkpurpleblues,4,Sun Nov 2 19:36:16 2014 UTC,"Prosopagnosia:       Prosopagnosia /ˌprɒsəpæɡˈnoʊʒə/ (Greek: ""prosopon"" = ""face"", ""agnosia"" = ""not knowing""), also called face blindness, is a cognitive disorder of face perception where the ability to recognize faces is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., decision making) remain intact. The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, which may affect up to 2.5% of the population.  The specific brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus,  which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the new method for recognizing faces depends on the less-sensitive object recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is only specific for the recognition of human faces or if it is also involved in highly trained visual stimuli.

I had just walked into the shopping center and there is this woman disheveled, bleeding and openly crying with most early morning shoppers ignoring her. She comes up to me to ask for 20cents for the payphone to call the police. Now pay phones are free call for all emergency servces and I tell her this. She bursts into tears thanking me and telling me she needed to report her fiance for beating her and locking her out of their home that night.  She had blood and bruises on her face and was unable to speak without tears so I offered to sit with her and make the phone call for her. It took about 20mins total but that was enough to calm her down and make me quite late for opening the shop I worked. i lucky I had such a great boss that he didn't even dock my pay for not opening the store on time.  In the end some cops turned up and I went to work. I hope she managed to help herself. No one deserves that treatment.   It's sad though that it wasn't even my first time dealing with ladies or men in this situation.

When I worked at McDonald's as a kid, I'd sometimes shop at the Walmart next door before heading home. For some reason, many people thought I worked there even though McDonald's uniforms and Walmart uniforms look absolutely nothing alike, no matter how dyslexic you are.  I'd always help them out anyway, since they were usually just looking for an item and I shopped there often enough to know where pretty much everything is.  But one particular middle-aged broad asked me for something only an employee could help her out with, and when I told her I didn't work there, and motioned to my McDonald's uniform, she popped out with that ""Are you sure?""  I was dumbfounded to be asked such an idiotic question. I asked her, with curiosity in my voice, ""Where do you work?"" When she replied, proud and beaming, with the name of her company, I mockingly responded ""Are you sure??""  She rolled her eyes and walked away as I derisively laughed after her."

They just can't fathom that one of you young folks might actually be at the store to SHOP when you obviously should be there providing personal service, especially explaining things to them that they are too lazy to figure out by reading prominently-posted signs.  They love to try you on as some sort of ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" ""Downton Abbey"" maids and butlers that they get to shit-talk at for free.    And if you fail to properly cup their balls with a cheerful smile for their entire visit, they try to get you fired from your underpaid hard-ass job, and most of the time Management kisses their asses and shafts you because it's so easy to replace you in this economy that has been deliberately shitted-up by, you guessed it, those same entitled old farts who are abusing you."

IDontWorkHereLady,2jhixa,halcyoncmdr,8,Fri Oct 31 22:10:43 2014 UTC,"As a ride along, you should dress somewhat sharp. It's respectful and obviously looks good especially if you're applying with the department. I had on khaki pants, a long sleeved green button down collared shirt, and a ""dressier"" jacket. Very business casual...   Funny, I have a friend that's a Sergeant and he always tells his ride-alongs to wear the most casual thing they own. He loves watching civilian's reactions to another person hanging out with the officer that definitely don't seem to belong, especially on graveyard shifts at 3am. I have to admit as well, the most fun ride-alongs I've been on have been those where I've been dressed as unassuming as possible; t-shirt, jeans and old comfortable sneakers."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhixa,link5057,2,Fri Oct 31 22:17:20 2014 UTC,"Haha that's awesome! Yah the only time I could dress comfortably was when I was with the tactical drug unit during my internship. They said, ""jeans and boots are the norm. Don't wear anything durogatory. Also, if you can, grow some facial hair.""  Best part of the internship by far."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhixa,gmpilot,4,Wed Nov 5 07:32:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, casual and unkempt is what he said to try. Unshaven scraggly beard, plain t-shirt and jeans with dirty sneakers, etc. Watching people's reactions is awesome, they're obviously thinking ""who the F is this guy""?  I have to admit, my first ride-along I was spoiled, we had fresh blood and 5 DV calls. Got called out to a DV at midnight, the guy had punched a mobile home window out and was definitely bleeding profusely from the amount of blood leading from the trailer at the back of the mobile home park to the front gate, might die based on blood and since it was like 20°F, yet the ""girlfriend"" didn't want to say who it was, press charges, etc. That was my first call. Kinda got me hooked and every ride-along since then hasn't quite met that, still fun though. We also had to clear an abandoned restaurant after the alarm was somehow going off (not sure how exactly).  Christmas Eve was fun as well, and New Years Eve required wearing kevlar helmets from 11:45-12:15 due to random AK-47 fire into the sky, after a falling round came sideways through the top of the Circle K gas station pump ""ceiling"" and embedded itself a couple inches in the pavement. Fun times.  No desire to go into law enforcement, but it's still fun to ride-along every so often. The fact that the jurisdiction is only 1 square mile is also very interesting."

I also love it when people stare and are like, ""who the hell is this guy!?"" Happened while responding to a domestic battery. Walked in the house and the lady was just like, ""da hell?"" Lol.  One lady just kept staring at us and my riding officer was like, ""you okay?"" She said, ""yah just tryin' to figure out why da police and some random dude are standing in my front yard.""

IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,littlewoolie,37,Sat Oct 18 11:32:51 2014 UTC,Oh man.  I would've told her off and it would've been SO sweet.
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,whatnobodyknew,6,Sun Oct 19 04:32:19 2014 UTC,Suuure you would've..
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,RDR911,15,Thu Oct 30 17:02:07 2014 UTC,"Oh my God, yes!  It would've been great!  After the ""WELL are you going to fix this??""  I would have stared at her for an extra two seconds or so with an ""I'm looking at someone profoundly stupid"" expression, then said ""You done?""  If she started up again I'd have put my hand up and interrupted her with a ""WUH wuh wuh wuh whoa!  I DON'T WORK HERE, YOU IDIOT!"" loud enough for the whole lobby to hear.  Then I would have shamed her for using her kids as an excuse to act like a jerk, asking if her mother raised her to act that way in public, and finished by pointing out that she's a grown woman and suggesting a level of shame that she should feel for that kind of behavior.  I'd probably point a finger in her face, too, like I was chastising a child.  That's about how it went down last time I put down an entitled, suburban, middle-age woman, and she was speechless.  I didn't curse, I just publicly shamed her.  It was quite satisfying.  You have to understand, I really hate people like that.  I had better manners when I was 9, and rude people bother me."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,whatnobodyknew,-13,Thu Oct 30 18:45:50 2014 UTC,"If you had real manners you wouldn't publicly shame anybody. Make sure they know what they did wrong by talking to them, but don't embarrass them in front of strangers."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,RDR911,10,Sat Nov 1 07:38:17 2014 UTC,"My manners end when someone pisses me off.  This woman was a menace to local businesses.  She has a habit of rudely talking about people right in front of them in an extremely mean way.  If you have a flaw (or not) she will loudly shine a spotlight on it.  She got in my co-worker's face when he was on break, out of uniform, eating with his fiance.  He's one of the nicest guy's I've ever met.  I felt the need to put a stop to the situation.  So I told her if she needed something she could talk to me, in very clear terms.  I almost never go off on people like that.  It was very satisfying."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,whatnobodyknew,8,Sat Nov 1 21:00:08 2014 UTC,"I honestly think it depends on how egregious the offense is. Yes, talk to them in a calm manner and let them know what they did wrong, so they won't do it again, but if that doesn't work and they are still rude, uncooperative, and causing havoc, by all means proceed in any way likely to resolve the situation.   Even public shaming."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jhvgx,Bunny_ofDeath,6,Sat Nov 1 13:03:12 2014 UTC,Indeed.  She wouldn't have changed her behavior if I had been calm and gentle.

I would just wander around BB, in my CC uniform, with a tape recorder rolled into an ad.... I was supposed to check to make sure they weren't beating our prices, but most of that is set at corp, so I mostly just wandered around looking sketchy and randomly following people while mumbling stuff into the tape recorder.    ""specimen looks to be in poor shape...seems to be on fringes of society...possible match for experiment, probability of subject being reported missing low...""  I would also help customers out if they were nice, otherwise I would just tuck my head down, start urgently whispering ""abort...abort"" into the tape recorder and slowly walk away... I wonder if my manager ever actually listened to those tapes...

I excuse myself from the lecture (there was only 5 of us in, and I was the only conscious one) to answer the call. Caller (C) asks me if I am name Me: Yes, where did you get my number? C: A friend recommended you to help me with my computer. Me: Okay, what's the issue C: It won't turn on Me: Right, I'll come around as soon as I am out of the lecture that I am in. Where abouts are you? C: Outskirts of Edinburgh. How long do you think you'll be? I live about two hours away from Edinburgh, and didn't own a car. I pointed this out to her and she flipped out. I explained to her that I would need to get a train, then walk to the outskirts of town to get to her house, fix the computer (probably a five minute job) then walk back to the city centre to get the two hour train north. She wasn't having any of it. C: WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT THEN? Me: Because that would cost me about £40- return. Unless you are willing to pay at least £60, then it would be more hassle than it's worth C: YOU IT PEOPLE REALLY ARE JUST LAZY hangs up Turns out that the friend had given her, and at least five others, my PERSONAL number.One of the many reasons why I don't help people out for free anymore."

Two weekend's ago, I visited my parent's winter home in Arizona, I do my typical cleaning, malware, antivirus, etc. Keep it smooth, and clean running.  Then my mother comes screaming into my small bedroom in their house, and says I deleted all her games.  I said I didn't, just click start button -> programs -> games and she's there with all her favorite games.  But no she get's this murderous look like she's about to kill me, and says that she wants all her games on her desktop.  I said no, because it's something she or my dad should reasonably be able to figure out on their own, I am even willing to show them.  No she gets even angrier, and is looking my life will be ended very shortly.  So I go to the computer, show her where all her games are, and she pressures me to re-create all those desktop shortcuts to her favorite games.  I don't even want to clean their pc, but she usually downloads some bridge crap, get's the pc infected, then asks me for help.  I hate being the family pc tech.

At that point they've lost any possible right to any consideration. Fuck 'em.

IDontWorkHereLady,2jf7o2,anal-bum-cover,-22,Sat Feb 28 07:01:19 2015 UTC,Calling her a cunt. It seems you escalated the situation a bit too much. You could have just explained that you weren't tech support and you where with your kids. I understand it was your day off with your kids and that your mom giving your number away saying you would help everyone is more than annoying. But it seemed a bit much.
IDontWorkHereLady,2jf7o2,h3rp3r,13,Sat Feb 28 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"It was not a bit much. I was polite at first and she pushed it.

IDontWorkHereLady,2jgo8b,mrblahblahblacksheep,14,Fri Oct 17 14:43:59 2014 UTC,Hand them a resume and ask them to call you when you turn 16.
IDontWorkHereLady,2jgo8b,RDR911,7,Sat Oct 18 02:32:05 2014 UTC,You live in a delusional world if you honestly think they'd wait until he's 16 and then call him. They'd just throw out the résumé.
IDontWorkHereLady,2jgo8b,StormySan,3,Thu Oct 30 17:11:00 2014 UTC,"Actually you never know, it sounds like he's a regular there and may have a rapport with the staff already. They may actively want to hire him for all we know.  If he doesn't hand it in now, he guarantees he won't get anything. Why not hand it in, what is there to lose?"
IDontWorkHereLady,2jgo8b,Dracomax,1 point,Tue Nov 11 08:52:29 2014 UTC,"No, he doesn't guarantee anything by waiting. In fact, it could hurt to do so, as often Companies are required to keep Resumes for 90 Days or more, and thus have a policy of not accepting them more often. If he hands it in sooner, it ends up at the bottom of the stack when they need another hire, and gets forgotten."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jgo8b,Charlieap96,0,Wed Nov 19 11:38:39 2014 UTC,"Actually... If he handed it in, all he would have to do when he turned 16 is go in and apply and remind them they had his resume, and ask them to look for it, meaning it would end up in their hands directly and have a back up, just in case it got misplaced/ thrown out, and since it seems like he is a regular, they probably know him at least to a minimal extent already, and have witnessed that he has the knowledge base to work there after this incident. If you already have prior history with an employer, even if it's as a customer, and they have your information in their hands, you're already most of the way there, and there isn't much left to go other than hoping they have an opening for you and take into consideration the past history. All you truly have to worry about is acing the interview."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jgo8b,bofh,2,Wed Dec 10 04:18:45 2014 UTC,"Knowing the company concerned doing that is likely to result in anything but them waiting until Robabster was 16, up to and including calling them the next day and getting snotty when they can't start work at once, to waiting until Robabster is 56 and setting their car on fire."

My area code isn't even close to there.  I've also been getting phone calls from random dudes asking get for her. Normally weekend mornings or Mondays. I've finally figured out that she gives my number out to guys in bars. It really sucks because the guys never believe that I'm not her so I have to deal with her bullshit because they think I'm her and am just being a bitch. It's beginning to really piss me off because I don't know how to make it stop. I know her full name, but unfortunately she has a common first and last name. I know her city because I've gotten invited to parties from her friends by accident. Too bad there are literally about 25 people with her name in that area on Facebook otherwise I'd message her and tell her to knock it off."

They don't like being held personally responsible, plus it wastes their time, losing them money. Never got calls from them again."

I kind of did that accidentally the other day while driving to work.  25mph speed limit on a residential artery leading between a freeway and a county hwy/main surburban artery.  He decided that going 30 wasn't enough, and flew up beside me in the right turn lane at a stop light.  I had just been going as fast as the bus in front of me (which made it through the light, I stopped), and there was a line of cars behind me (at least 4 that he passed on the grass before the right turn lane began).  Dude is sitting in his jeep next to me, just fucking staring at me... I wasn't sure what his issue was, but I was in a good mood that morning and kind of thought he was being friendly, so I gave him a big smile and waved.... he just kept staring at me, so I gave him the thumbs up with a big smile again...  Light turns green, and he (from the right turn lane) floors it to get in front of me and slam on the brakes right in front of me.  Probably would have been worse if I hadn't really started accelerating yet, you know, since this crazy dude in a jeep just pulled some shit.  He kept in front of me, crawling along, until the next light (.25 miles perhaps?).  I didn't mind, I had to stay late at work for a meeting that night anyway, and I don't really have a ""set schedule"" so I wasn't in danger of being late.  He tried to force me to turn at the next light, but I got by and went to work.  I don't need to be fucking with some unhinged dude at 6:45 in the fucking morning.  Yesterday I left a bit earlier (after talking to a co-worker, this guy is always driving like a dick in the area if traffic is too slow for him, so I figured I would leave a bit earlier and avoid the bullshit.)

But on the other hand,  if you look at the woman's behavior,  you can make the argument that it was fair for her to lose the money because she rudely yelled at a stranger and shoved money in his hand.   Besides,  it was a coffee,  usually a luxury item and not a necessity,  so loosing the five francs didn't hurt her in the long run and may have even taught her a valuable lesson.

IDontWorkHereLady,2jfey4,Xanza,5,Wed Nov 26 15:16:53 2014 UTC,This generation seriously confuses me. I had my first job when I was 14 and haven't skipped a year since. Just get a fucking job. Damn.
IDontWorkHereLady,2jfey4,AndrewJamesDrake,23,Fri Oct 17 01:17:22 2014 UTC,"My generation, which is likely the generation that confuses you, has spent most of its existence being told how hard it is to live in the Real World. Just so you know, I'm either a Millennial or the generation after the Millennials. There's some debate as to which I classify in due to a little quirk in my brain chemistry that left me a few years behind, which I had to make up. I existed during the tail end of the Millenials, but I was more comparable to a dog than a human at the time. So I wasn't as shaped by the cultural environment of the time.  Anyway, the Millenials have grown up in an environment that would probably sound a bit alien to you. It has elements similar to your own childhood, but there are a lot of elements that couldn't have existed when you were young.  The biggest difference is that we've grown up in a climate of fear. You probably lived during the Cold War. You were also probably old enough to understand what was going on at the time. Can you recall the fear you had regarding the Soviet Union? Do you remember how you felt when you considered that there was an enemy halfway across the world that could reduce your home to a pile of ash without warning? Do you remember how it felt to know that there was nothing you could do to protect yourself or your family if the Soviets decided that Mutually Assured Destruction sounded pretty good?  I apologize if you aren't American, but my point still stands. You likely grew up in an environment where death could be brought down from beyond your borders without warning. My generation grew up in fear of an succession of different enemies just like that.  First, there's the Paedo-Hunt. You're probably familiar with the fear of Pedophiles that overran the United States. That fear is the biggest reason that my generation is as sheltered as it is. Our parents heard all the fear-mongering, and they decided to keep us close where they could protect us. They didn't let us go out into the ""Real World"" where we might get kidnapped and used as an deviant's sex-toy. They structured our lives, and taught us to fear strangers, to fear the world outside of our homes and schools.  That was the beginning of this shift. The next big one was probably the Satanic Panic, but I'm still studying that particular societal event so I'm not able to go into details. Anyway, I do know the reaction to the Satanic Panic was to sanitize media aimed at children. Anything judged to be too ""Mature"" for children was gated off, and made out to be a horrible, horrible thing.  The next major push came from the events of September 11th, 2001. You know how you felt about the Soviets? My generation felt the same way about everyone we didn't know. Our parents were scared that we'd get caught up in an attack, so they sheltered us even more. They arranged our lives for us, planned out the paths we'd take, and worked really hard to keep us going along the way they wanted us to go.    They wanted to protect us... and we picked up on their fear. From a child's perspective... it looked like the world was something to be afraid of. As far as a lot of us, myself included, were concerned: Everyone we didn't know was out to kill us. Stranger Danger, and all the other things they taught us, made it sound like everyone on the planet was out for our blood. When we finally started to get old enough to understand things a bit... we didn't see much that denied our fears.  Our adolescences were spent during the War on Terror, listening to the news talking about these people in our country that looked like everyone else... until they start killing. We heard about how our country was under attack, and how it might go away if we didn't fight back... and we were powerless then.  Once that stopped being the thing the News talked about all the time... we began to hear about how our country was going to collapse. How there was too much debt, and how the US was going to fold and we'd lose our government. We've heard how our planet is going to grow hotter and hotter, and harder to survive on... much less live. I grew up hearing how there was going to be riots on the streets, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria... and to a young mind the economic collapse looked a lot like that.  For those that are young right now, they're hearing about how god himself is going to wipe our country off the planet because we're letting the LGBT guys have the same rights that we have.    We're sheltered when we're young, and taught to fear the world by watching our parents. Then, once we're old enough for them to stop sheltering us quite as much, we get to look at a world that's made out to be falling apart around us. We're taught by the news, and in many cases our parents, that the world's going to change in a bad way to make it hard to survive in... much less Live.  As a result... a lot of us are an odd form of Nihilistic Ethical Hedonist. Working a job isn't going to do anything but give you some money to wipe your butt with once the US Government folds in on itself. You'll probably starve once Yellowstone goes off, or Global Warming (or the Aquifer running dry) causes a major famine. We're made very aware that our time is limited, and for a short eighteen years we can do practically anything with it.  Speaking from experience... I spent the first eighteen years of my life convinced that I was probably not going to live to see twenty-five. I was convinced that something was going to kill me off before then... so preparing for my future didn't make any sense. I knew I had very limited time, and I wanted to squeeze a century's worth of joy and life out of the few years I had.   Getting a job didn't make any sense to me in that state of mind. Doing anything I didn't enjoy didn't make sense in that state of mind either. I knew that I was going to die, and I was probably going to do that sooner rather than later. So any time spent pursuing anything but a bit more happiness was... well it looked fairly pointless. I wanted to live as much as I could before some terrorist's bullet went through my heart, Yellowstone blew its cap and took me with it, the aquifer dried up and a mass famine occurred, or the US collapsed in on itself entirely.    Your generation had it hard. You weathered incredible physical and emotional trials, and came out strong as a result of it. But that's because you had a strong foundation to build off of. Your parents' generation gave you the support you needed when you were young to grow strong. They encouraged you to go out into the world and do things on your own when you were children.   You could leave your home and visit your neighbors on your own. You could go out and play without being afraid of everyone you saw that you didn't know. Your parents told you that you could handle things.  My generation hasn't gotten that. We've been told that we need to be protected... and that we can't handle things on our own."
IDontWorkHereLady,2jfey4,SanityInAnarchy,1 point,Fri Oct 17 07:10:34 2014 UTC,"I have to say... my experience was a bit different. Not all parents are hysterically afraid of everything.   First, there's the Paedo-Hunt. You're probably familiar with the fear of Pedophiles that overran the United States. That fear is the biggest reason that my generation is as sheltered as it is. Our parents heard all the fear-mongering, and they decided to keep us close where they could protect us. They didn't let us go out into the ""Real World"" where we might get kidnapped and used as an deviant's sex-toy. They structured our lives, and taught us to fear strangers, to fear the world outside of our homes and schools.   This is about far more than pedophilia -- everything from playsets being ""too dangerous"" and therefore being neutered, to, well, not generally just going outside and playing with the other kids...  Then again, a fair chunk of this is our fault. As a teenager, and still as an adult, I spend most of my free time at home, playing with a computer. That's not an entirely terrible decision, as my career now revolves around the same thing, but there were many years when my parents would've trusted me to go wander off and explore nearby woods and backyards with my friends, and I mostly stayed inside and played video games with them instead.   The next big one was probably the Satanic Panic, but I'm still studying that particular societal event so I'm not able to go into details.   It was also likely too long ago to really be relevant.   The next major push came from the events of September 11th, 2001. You know how you felt about the Soviets? My generation felt the same way about everyone we didn't know.   And this is the biggest difference of all: For the first few weeks after 9/11, I thought what the rest of us thought, that this Changed Everything Forever. But it didn't take too long for people I respected (including my parents) to make the point that, statistically, this was unlikely to ever affect me or anyone I knew. On top of which, I lived in a small town in the Midwest, the last place that was likely to be hit even if terrorism was a common thing.  Very quickly, it became obvious that all 9/11 really did was give people in power the excuse they needed to grab more power:   The TSA is a figurative pain in the ass at airports, and unfortunately far-too-often a literal pain in the ass. We went to war... which means there's a drain on the economy, and I guess things are dangerous if you actually went and enlisted. I'd guess the NSA went as far as it did largely because of 9/11.   So... really, for most of us, nothing changed. But, I'd guess far more people have been negatively affected by our post-9/11 policies than by 9/11 itself.  In other words: There really never was a time when I was afraid that random stranger would blow me up.   Once that stopped being the thing the News talked about all the time... we began to hear about how our country was going to collapse. How there was too much debt, and how the US was going to fold and we'd lose our government.   Never heard that one. In fact, when I brought it up, my parents patiently explained to me why debt is so important to how the economy functions.   We've heard how our planet is going to grow hotter and hotter, and harder to survive on... much less live.   This one... is actually true, but it's still going to be awhile. Also, it's going to be really bad, but nothing like a nuclear winter -- entirely too many people live near oceans, but there are other places that should be reasonably okay.  In the mean time, there's a point at which money won't buy you happiness, but you're probably happier having money than not.   You'll probably starve once Yellowstone goes off...   Which I suppose might happen tomorrow, or maybe not for another thousand years.   (or the Aquifer running dry)   Well, which aquifer? California isn't doing too great right now, but there's not just one worldwide aquifer. Moving will be unpleasant, but not necessarily a doomsday-level catastrophe. And I don't remember hearing about this until relatively recently, anyhow.  To put it another way, when Katrina blew through New Orleans, a lot of people had to move, had to rebuild, a number of people died. But most people survived, and rebuilt, and life marched on.  Growing up surrounded by all this hysteria, I was also surrounded by counterpoints. I started out naively optimistic, but by the time I really became cynical about our ability to actually fix the problems with the world, I also became skeptical of the claims that the world really was so bad. And I'm not sure I'm unique in that respect, though I see plenty of grown adults on the still-scared-but-naively-optimistic end of that scale.  What I almost never see, outside of apocalyptic cults, is a person who will actually turn down a job because they'd rather play Call of Duty.  Oh, one more thing:   For those that are young right now, they're hearing about how god himself is going to wipe our country off the planet because we're letting the LGBT guys have the same rights that we have.   Less than 50% of them, I suspect. Keep in mind that over half the country, and rising, is okay with gay marriage and gay rights in general."
