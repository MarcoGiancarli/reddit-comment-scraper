I feel like somehow, towards the end of the series, this mentality will contradict ichigo's ""save everyone"" mentality, and lead to a conflict between the two of them. I don't expect a physical fight, but definitely ichigo will become aware of his plans, and have to choose between letting either his friends or the world die. Ichigo will of course come up with some third option that saves everyone and make urahara look like an idiot, because shonen."

Think of how Byakuya and Isshin broke Ichigo and Grand Fisher's oversized zanpakutos with one swing- yes, there were ginormous differences in power levels in each example, but they were both much easier to break than a standard-sized zanpakuto. Shinso retains its structure while extended, meaning it can extend to a great length and be able to withstand counter-attacks from high-level opponents. Hope that cleared up everything!"

A lot of them have sounds that are basically combined versions of our sounds/letters. L/R is the biggest example, that's usually just the same combined sound which is why it seems like they can't pronounce an actual L or R in English. Same goes for things like b/p/v.   So, yeah, they have a hard time pronouncing English words, but we have just as hard a time pronouncing their words properly. It's not exclusive to Japanese speaking English."

People might say they prefer the sub because they like reading what they say over listening to poor voice acting but if you're watching the anime just to read it and are just trying to marathon it, might as well just read the manga as fast as possible. I think Ichigo sounds a lot more annoying in the sub than the sub by far."
bleach,3dytd7,Skapes1230,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:24 2015 UTC,Bleach in English is fine if you have never heard the classic. Shunsui has the worst voice in an anime period. Rukia..slighly better the  awful.  I know its opinion and I love bleach but the english is just not strong enough especially if your watching filler.
bleach,3dytd7,Rocksbury,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the dub, but Bleach is one of those animes where I really can not argue if you prefer the sub. Personally, the main thing that made me choose the dub is that I just like Ichigo's English voice more than I like his Japanese voice (in English, he actually sounds like a teenager for one thing), even though I must agree that Hollow Ichigo and some other smaller characters have better voices in the original Japanese version."
bleach,3dytd7,water_warrior,2,Tue Jul 21 03:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say dub. It may not be the biggest deal, but glancing away from action to see words? No such desire.  I'm normally a sub guy, but the voices are actually mostly quite good, with a few standout excellents."
bleach,3dytd7,HiHoJufro,3,Tue Jul 21 05:16:25 2015 UTC,"I prefer sub because the voice acting in the dub for many of the characters is kinda painful. There are animes with good dubbing (Hellsing and FMA:Brotherhood come to mind), but Bleach... is not one of them."
bleach,3dytd7,Narissis,3,Mon Jul 20 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"The early episodes have a lacking dub. It's still from the era when we didn't really know what we're doing, and editing was limited. You couldn't change the lip-flaps if your translation doesn't much the amount of syllabes said. You just need your character to say a different thing. Also, the quality of the recording is iffy for today's standard.  Around the Arrancar Arc it gets better. By the time we're dealing with the likes of Shinji, the quality is top notch, the translation becomes more accurate and the overall thing feels better.  Note that watching a sub means that you will notice less of what's happening in the shots, as you will always need to have your biggest focus on whenever the text appears, so if your monitor is big, that can become an issue.   Other than that, make the choice yourself. You can watch the first ones with sub and then switch, or maybe swallow the whole thing in english, both goods and bads. Or you can watch the sub which is usually well-made. For some anime I wouldn't recommend the dub, but in bleach it's not bad at all, if you prefer it, stick to it."
bleach,3dytd7,Zil_v_a,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Good points. Just wanted to mention that the vast majority of dubs today still don't reanimate lip flaps, that's pretty much reserved for the big worldwide licenses like Pokemon, yugioh, digimon, those kinds of shows. The difference now is that script adaptation has evolved so much that most lines sound perfectly natural, even if they're a little different than the direct translations."
bleach,3dytd7,BloodRedOath,0,Mon Jul 20 19:27:06 2015 UTC,"My problem with the dub (apart from disliking some of the actors) is not exactly easy to fix. Some things just work in Japanese that don't in other languages (I know it happens in a lot of other languages too), or change from a one or two syllable word to an entire sentence which would interrupt the flow of the conversation.   This causes the translators to have to force the script to fit the speed and often causes either a large simplification or really badass statements about attacks to change into basic descriptions of what they just did."
bleach,3dytd7,ABashfulTurnip,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, the changes of dialogue are a problem. But with ""things that just work in Japanese"" it's the opposite. English dubs most often ""localize"" the anime, changing some jokes and culture references to match things that the target demographic knows/understands. It's good for an average viewer, since the joke/trope would only be received by a Japanese person or an engaged fan of Japanese culture.  Personally I don't view that as either good nor bad. Subjectively, I really prefer seeing the version intended by the author, so I would go for a sub most of the times."
bleach,3dytd7,Zil_v_a,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:31 2015 UTC,It really depends on whether reading text on the screen detracts from the experience for you. I personally always watch dubbed versions of stuff because I absorb more of the atmosphere and the story without subtitles.

She's like Princess Toadstool ^(stool... frog shit?) with the Lazy Shell in Super Mario RPG.  She can revive anyone with the flicka dat wrist, and restore anything. Shes probably gonna do some Aerith shit and use her divine time warping healing shit to fix everything and sacrifice herself. She was never meant to end up with Ichigo, he's too fucked up and grew up never thinking about that kind of love, and she can't bear to love any other man, so she's gonna die.  Just like in The Night Angel trilogy. She'a Doll Girl, she's gonna end the ultimate evil, or do something that will give Ichigo the only window of opportunity to defeat that Nazi once and for all.  Tl;dr Chad and Orihime are more advanced FBs than the other dudes."
bleach,3dy4b9,ShiaLaBuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:34 2015 UTC,"Right. They're more advanced because they've been ""training"" by personally invading the SS, and having to fight Arrancar. The rest of the FBers just trained with each other and with Ginjou. Kubo never said that there's ""pure"" and ""impure"" FBers. We also need to take into account that Sado was buff AF before any of this started. A 15 year old snapping a telephone pole off? That's a wee bit stronk. That amplifies spiritual powers as well, being physically strong."
bleach,3dy4b9,HazelnutPi,2,Tue Jul 21 00:54:23 2015 UTC,They did get the boost from the hogyoku making Chad's desire to be able to protect his friends a reality. He might have a little something extra from that that made his Fullbring into something a bit more advanced.

Like when he first got the power he was kind of on par with ichigo and ishida and they all could have developed at similar rates but in different power types (shimigami, Quincy and fullbringer) and they could all stay relevant to the battles and such.   Instead he didn't get a power up until hueco mundo and even then he wasn't anywhere near the power level of the enemies around him outside of fodder arrancar. And now unless he suddenly pulls the legs out of nowhere he won't even be useful to the final arc.   I like what you pointed out about the Diablo connection. Maybe he has 5 levels of release arms/legs/ full and at full power he is the ""devil"" opposite of the soul kings 5 limbs and whatnot. And then ichigo would end up fighting between Chad the devil and Ishida the new successor to the guy who killed the soul king."

At one point it was Yhwach that was supplying Ichigo with his power the next was the Hollow. We have never seen Zengetsu what people assume is we have seen White/Zengetsu. For Ichigo to have a Vollstandig he would simply have to be a strong enough Quincy to go ""Bankai""  Why would he have one considering he has surpassed Soul Reaper/Quincy/Hollow and has become a mutation of all the energy types minus being dead.  He may have what appears to be one but even his Bankai is onyl his interpretation of one. Byakuya never acknowledges it as a complete Bankai."

It was closed because the fillers weren't worth it, and the Fullbring Arc pretty much happened just like this. They finished the anime, waited for the content, then stapled one more season.  However, given how long is the current arc I cannot guarantee that we will get a whole season of anime. It might be an OVA series (like Hellsing had it) or maybe a shorter movie series (up to three entries). But that's the worst scenario I can imagine.

The introduction to it was bad and the moment the Bounts invaded Soul Society was super boring where it's just people running around with lame fights and enemies with no actual motivation for even being there since Kariya was clearly about to outclass Ichigo at every fight prior.   As for the Zanpakuto Arc, it was good up until we learn Muramasa's intention was to release his master, Koga. The whole charade of rebelling against their master was dumb if he was doing it for his master. Koga did not stand out as a character and his backstory with relationship to the Kuchiki's did not help him. Even the writers knew it was dumb and had Ichigo's final fight be with Muramasa and not Koga. I think the reminder about the relationship between Shinigami and their Zanpakuto would be better shown in the confrontation between Ichigo and Muramasa rather than Byakuya and Koga."

I don't like the word cancel - its so final and absolute... Of course I can understand WHY it was a good decision to stop making material to broadcast, but it still makes me a little sad. I like to binge watch things see, so even IF it did come back, I can not have the full marathon experience for years."
bleach,3dz8i1,reigun91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:04 2015 UTC,"Now im no expert in how that buissness works , but i think they canceled it because there was nothing to animate in the meanwhile and they wanted to see how bleach is gonna end by the financial point of view . If it ends well , they could ""create"" a new season of animation for bleach . They didnt put it in hiatus because they dont know how this is gonna end , so maybe they would later have to cancel it anyway. It would be like a bet they dont want to make . Again , i dont know shit about how it works or what are the causes , i just think it this way with what i can guess"

To be honest, I feel like Bleach will have it's final arc. It's just a question of when and how long before it happens. But I don't see it starting before the end of the mangas run."

Bleach had a pretty big budget, and to do nothing but canon material means that they will have to find ways to cut cost.

bleach,3e0c6k,Rocksbury,7,Mon Jul 20 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"Isshin didnt know what Mugestsu was, he knew what the final getsuga tenshou was. For me, it was Ichigos equivalent of the Letz Stil. We have no clue if he can use it again, but, logic would dictate that he should be able to do so. But logic really has no place in Bleach."
bleach,3e0c6k,reigun91,3,Tue Jul 21 00:29:37 2015 UTC,"Mugetsu was the attack associated with Ichigo's FGT, but IMHO it wasn't FGT itself.  FGT itself, so far as I can tell, is total acquiescence of the Zanpakuto spirit.  Shikai is knowing its name and hearing its voice.  Bankai is being able to manifest it to express its power.  FGT is being able to merge with it - ""become"" it - where there's no distinction between Shinigami and Zanpakuto.    That Isshin knew about it, and knew the ""process"" for learning it (""These guys won't want to teach it to us""), we can infer that it's not a Quincy or Hollow-related technique.  It could be something Shiba-clan specific (only Isshin mentions it) - but we really don't have the information to say that for sure.  Only that it's something very rare, and ""purely"" Shinigami in origin.  That Ichigo's zanpakuto was part Hollow wasn't important to the process - just to Ichigo's power level and abilities, along with getting the Zanpakuto spirit to acquiesce.  Though, OMZ had something to do with that as well, having apparently re-taken at least partial ascendency in the Dangai (in order to merge with Hichigo/Zangetsu - presumably to allow compliance rather than resulting in another encroachment) - hence the merged entity.  We haven't seen anything from OMZ or NewHichigo/NewZangetsu since the forging, so we don't know what effect, if any that OMZ's relaxed suppression and Ichigo's fresh imprinto upon a ""proper"" Asauchi have had on his relationship with his zanpakuto spirit(s)."
bleach,3e0c6k,yukeake,0,Tue Jul 21 16:34:37 2015 UTC,But Kaien didn't know getsuga tenshou nor was his zanpakuto a reference to the moon. His shikai was a trident. That's why I throw the whole shiba clan exclusivity out.
bleach,3e0c6k,reigun91,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we never really got to know Kaien either, and he died both fairly young, and well before the series started."
bleach,3e0c6k,yukeake,0,Tue Jul 21 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the 9th espada absorbed the hollow that killed him, and knew all of his techniques. And like I said, his zanpakuto didnt have anything to do with the moon, unlike Isshin and Ichigo."
bleach,3e0c6k,reigun91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:06 2015 UTC,He was at Vice-Captain level so wouldn't of been ready to learn something of that magnitude and became a hollow. Forfeiting his ability to merge with a Zanpakuto. We know Isshin was a Captain and apart of a noble family like Byakuya. He would of had a relative who taught this to him or the other possibility is that Isshin developed it on his own. The Shiba clan consists of Kukaku  and Ganju who people have speculated as being much stronger then he shows. Plus theories on Ikumi being another Shiba. Anyways all the members would have to be near the power level of Kaien who was a prodigy and Isshin who was a Captain. Seems to me in the past whatever made that family famous could be directly related to FGT.
bleach,3e0c6k,reigun91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"Isshin is a member of the branch family, not the head family. And again, his shikai has nothing to do with the moon. Thats what Ichigo and Isshin have in common. Which would explain why Isshin would know about it. But we do not even know if its the same technique."
bleach,3e0c6k,Ceegee93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:15:36 2015 UTC,The only thing with it being based on Quincy power is that Isshin knew details of the power. Either it was only his father who shared this power or it was a Shiba technique passed on. Still it would mean that the Shiba clan had a level beyond Bankai.
bleach,3e0c6k,reigun91,5,Tue Jul 21 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"It's part of Final Getsuga Tensho, Isshin knew about it because he can use some of the same abilities as Ichigo, namely Getsuga Tensho. Isshin's zanpakutou is similar to Ichigo's too, being Engetsu."
bleach,3e0c6k,reigun91,0,Tue Jul 21 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"But it wasnt a level beyond bankai, because that would mean that at the very least, the other Noble families would be able to do the same thing as well. And if you take a good look, Ichigo shares a similar appearance to Yhwach. Mainly its the hair, but you get my point. I didnt say it was quincy based, I said it was his equivalent of the Letz Stil."
bleach,3e0c6k,Keranu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:17 2015 UTC,Even if the Shiba clan had this one shot power that would be significant in that no other family has shown any indication of this. Like the Zero Squad the Shiba clan could be very unique in that they have been granted that power rather than simply achieving it.  I have thought of the connection between Ichigo and Yhwach but with Masaki being connected to the Quincy bloodline I can't see it going any further. I thought that it was strange he had the all black look but its more likely that the all black look is a reflection of his father and the other Shibas.

bleach,3e0c6k,Keranu,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:39 2015 UTC,It's Ichigo's shinigami version of a Letzt stil. both do the same thing only mugetsu does not collect more reishi when its released
bleach,3e0c6k,Fearless-Fairness,3,Tue Jul 21 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"Mugetsu is the highest form, and true form, of Ichigo's Getsuga Tensho.   Zangetsu is a Zanpakuto whose true power is to pull out the user's spiritual energy and applyit to the body as usable power. It's signature attack is Getsuga Tensho where the user's spiritual energy is condensed on the blade of the Zanpakuto and flung at the enemy by slashing the sword at them.  A Bankai's basic form and a Shikai are both lower forms of a Zanpakuto's true form and true power. Final Getsugaa Tensho is the true/final form of Ichigo's Zanpakuto and Shinigami powers. Just like Senkei is the true form of Byakuya's Zanpakuto (as opposed to the blade petals of his Shikai which is just a weaker version of Senkei) Hakka No Togame is the true form of Rukia's Zanpakuto (Sode No Shirayuki also lowers the temperature of whatever it touches, but to a lesser extent than Hakka No Togame) or how Kamishini No Yari is the true form of Gin's Zanpakuto (Shinso also extends, but not as far and cannot poison the enemy like the Bankai can)  Some Bankai have basic forms and higher forms, but others do not. Byakuya's Bankai initially appears as a large mass of blade petals when summoned. So, just a larger version of his Shikai. However, it's true form is only when those blade petals are grouped into full sized blades while in Senkei formation."
bleach,3e0c6k,chaosattractor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:07 2015 UTC,"I thought Hakuteiken was its true form, senkei is just for defense, but its not the sword's true form in bankai"

bleach,3e0c6k,chaosattractor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"But can two zanpakutou share signature attacks? Ichigo's not the only one to use Getsuga Tenshou.  I agree that Mugetsu is most likely Ichigo's ""true"" zanpakutou, obtained/released when Bachgetsu completely let go of his influence on Zangetsu/fused with him. Or at least as real as a zanpakutou that has Quincy bits mixed in can be.  But then again there's the whole using-this-technique-and-losing-your-power-afterwards which pushes me more to the Letzt Stil side of the argument. Once properly evolved it could be a fusion between Vollstandig and Bankai I guess."
bleach,3e0c6k,yukeake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:09 2015 UTC,"He loses his power because of what the technique does. It pulls out all of his energy and uses it to attack. So, if he exhausts all of the energy Mugetsu pulled out, then he has absolutely no spiritual power left.  Plot-wise, Kubo may have given him this attack to create a parallel with Uryu,but there's not actually anything in the story that can be used to link these together.   Letzt Stil is a mechanical manipulation of a Quincy's power. It's like the Bankai training doll Urahara made. That doll is kind of the only example of a device that manipulates Shinigami powers to make them stronger. On the other hand, Final Getsuga Tensho is a special ability made from Ichigo's own heart. Isshin's FGT wouldn't even be exactly the same as Ichigo's. It's a unique ability while Letzt Stil is a generic thing that anyone can attempt."

So, if he exhausts all of the energy Mugetsu pulled out, then he has absolutely no spiritual power left.   Which, as I said, is counterproductive. What other zanpakutou spirit has an attack that does anything even vaguely of the sort? What's the difference between pulling out all your energy to attack, and exhausting your energy to the point that your bankai disappears against your will? Or even basically dying/being brought back to, well they're already dead but let's just call it life? Yet in his case even his spiritual awareness was gone.  Also, what do you mean by ""spiritual power""? Reiatsu? Because that can be and is regularly refilled. Reiryoku? If he used all of it in the FGT then how come he could still (to an extent) sense spirits, see Rukia, etc. a month after the fact? How come he still had spiritual power after exhausting his energy?   Plot-wise, Kubo may have given him this attack to create a parallel with Uryu,but there's not actually anything in the story that can be used to link these together.   Eh, bear in mind that before most of his major reveals we'd also have said there wasn't anything in the story linking certain things together. Yes, it parallels Uryuu's own loss quite well: the crazy-ass surge of reiatsu, the loss of power once leaving the form, the slow degradation of spiritual abilities afterwards (can still see spirits, etc), and even the way they get their own power back from an infusion of energy (arrow for Uryuu, stabbing for Ichigo).   You can hand-wave it away to plot, but recall that we found out after the FGT that there is more to their connection than ""just plot"": they are both Quincies by birth, Ichigo has used Quincy abilities in the past (like Blut Vene), and in fact the one he thought of as his zanpakutou spirit was the manifestation of his Quincy powers. In fact, even now that he has properly forged his zanpakutou, it still has a blade representing his Quincy side. Is it that much of a stretch to say that Mugetsu, or at least the Mugetsu form he used, isn't completely a Shinigami thing (and to be even more literal, Bachgetsu actually fused with Zangetsu)?   On the other hand, Final Getsuga Tensho is a special ability made from Ichigo's own heart. Isshin's FGT wouldn't even be exactly the same as Ichigo's. It's a unique ability while Letzt Stil is a generic thing that anyone can attempt.    I don't know, I wouldn't put so much stock in anything Bachgetsu said about Ichigo's abilities. Remember, even though he had (has?) good intentions he's been deliberately misleading Ichigo since he first became a Shinigami. And we're just beginning to explore the Quincy side of things in general and Ichigo in particular, of course there are potentially things that were misexplained on purpose (remember when the Hougyoku was just a device that erased the boundary between Shinigami and Hollow?).  Even then, I don't see how ""special ability made from Ichigo's own heart"" is anything, well, special, other than a shounen hero trope. Aren't all zanpakutou spirits reflections of their owners' souls/hearts? Back to the Quincy side of the argument, aren't Schrifts special abilities drawn from the Sternritters' own deepest desires? As for genericness, isn't each Vollstandig (and by extension Letzt Stil too, though that's speculation because we've only seen one of it) unique to each user? If you mean ""unique"" as in ""only one of its kind ever"" then that doesn't apply to Ichigo either because as you just said Isshin could have gotten it too, and it would be different from Ichigo's."

That doll is kind of the only example of a device that manipulates Shinigami powers to make them stronger.    Technically, the dummy is probably closer to a cross between the bankai-stealing medallions, and a ""special"" gigai.  It operates directly on the zanpakuto spirit, like the medallions do, and embeds the spirit in a body, similar to the way a gigai works.  It doesn't exactly make Shinigami powers stronger - not directly, anyway.  It just ""forcibly"" manifests the spirit - which is one of the prerequisites for Bankai.  By getting that part out of the way, it removes one ""speedbump"" from the process."

bleach,3e0c6k,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:22 2015 UTC,"It's not a ""level"" as it can't be attained by multiple people. Also, he didn't have to do a release to get it, just simply unlock his full power (at the time).   The reason Isshin can even do the getsuga is a mystery since one would think every person should have different shikai/bankai, but I assume it's a direct bloodline thing.  But Isshin said the final getsuga is what makes you lose your power, and to me mugetsu is simply the slash of his entire reiatsu (a perfect form of his getsuga ability). Otherwise, Ichigo looked to be stronger than Aizen without Mugetsu. Which then might mean the merging of sword to hand is the results of that level if power, which would argue for your point as Aizen did accomplish it (through the hogyokou though). Which actually might've been the reason he lost his power too? Man, I'm getting off topic here haha.  Well, I ultimately believe the slash itself is just an amplified complete consumption of his reiatsu which made him lose power and Ichigo we saw before mugetsu was the final getsuga itself."
bleach,3e0c6k,ChaosKeeshond,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:55 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, Mugetsu is a the form Ichigo needed his body to take so that he could withstand the power of the FGT.

bleach,3dzuir,a310gintoki,5,Mon Jul 20 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"It's very possible Aizen knew that the most capable Captains would be sent to Hueco Mundo since it was uncharted territory.   Unohana is the most diabolical villain in Soul Society's history and has complete mastery of Zanjutsu. She's also the strongest Captain other than Yamaoto and Aizen.  Mayuri is a genius and, as Shunsui says, produce results no matter how little information he's given.  Zaraki's attacking power is greater than most Captain's and his stamina is ridiculous. He could potentially have unshackled his power to a level that he could match Aizen if they fought head on.  Byakuya's a pretty strong Captain and has an AoE Bankai. So, even if Aizen was hidden, Byakuya could just cover the area in blade petals to try and sniff him out.  Separately, they may not seem like they could win, but they all have powers and abilities that give them a small advantage against Aizen. If they fought together, they could give him a lot of trouble or even beat him.  So, Aizen probably planned for some or all of them to be sent to HM to back up Ichigo, meaning he could trap them and would not have to risk a fight with them."

Hacshwald's character has flip-flopped between seeming like he is loyal to Yhwach and hinting that he's only doing as Yhwach says because he doesn't see any other option.  He's been very ambiguous because the real motivation for his actions hasn't been explained. Like when he said it was too soon for Uryu to be let out on his own and unsupervised. Did he mean it was too soon because Uryu couldn't be trusted yet and would try to attack Yhwach or did he mean it was too soon because Uryu didn't understand enough yet to successfully attack Yhwach and would just reveal himself with a pointless attack?

It proved to me that hashwalt will never ever betray yhwach and will be by his side until the very end. In regards to some other comments, he didn't seem sad last chapter, we focused in on his eyes to be able to see that he now has two irises and can see the future like yhwach.

I don't honestly see him being the final villain though, he's just not menacing enough. Also, I think even if he tried to kill Yhwach in his sleep, I think it would fail because I have to believe that Yhwach has some sort of defense mechanism that protects him while he sleeps. So if he did betray him, I think it would play out like Gin's attempt on Aizen's life and ultimately fail."

Or we've been shown his bankai all along.   Has Aizen really said ""Shatter, Kyouka Suigetsu"" when he's used it? I know he has said it several times when he removes the illusion so it might be a command to (actually) shatter the illusion it casts.  Or maybe I'm remembering everything backwards."
bleach,3dwxug,Plattbagarn,3,Mon Jul 20 11:40:37 2015 UTC,He may not have said it against Hollow Barragan; I'll have to double check.
bleach,3dwxug,Korrasch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:11 2015 UTC,I believe he did when he showed him that his minions were all killed.

Here and here he only holds up the sword and after some talking Aizen shatters Kyouka Suigetsu and all the Hollows are already dead.  Sadly, there's nothing more after this so it's impossible to know if all his minions actually die or that was the illusion."
bleach,3dwxug,Plattbagarn,2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't have a bankai though, he would technically have to say the release command (if its his shikai) every time he uses it."
bleach,3dwxug,rickEbobby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Which is why I'm arguing that he does indeed have a bankai and ""Shatter"" isn't his release command."
bleach,3dwxug,Plattbagarn,7,Mon Jul 20 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Shunsui's will be that directly connected.  I think it'll still involve chance, and that will be how Haschwalth will eventually kill him (much as I hate it).    I love this idea about Aizen.  We haven't been viewing his Shikai at all, or if we have, its at a level where the Bankai/shikai barrier has ceased to exist.  It is plausible, given all we know, and might be Kubo's best way out of having to try and figure out the OP version of a sword whose power is so OP to begin with that the the only ability it's wielder feared was the ability to set the entire absolute fucking world on fire.    I actually think Kisuke has a Bankai of limited applicability.  He didn't use it against Aizen, and it he isn't the ""fail to see the danger"" type (like Yama).  To me, that means that he either (1) was absolutely certain Ichigo would accomplish what he did (I mean, I guess) or (2) his Bankai would have been ineffective against Aizen and there would have been zero advantage in revealing it."

I have had the feeling lately that Shunsui is not going to live to see the end of this war. I think that him dying would be kind of symbolic in the sense that all of the older captains (Yama, Unohana, Shunsui, Ukitake) would pass on, thus helping to usher in the next generation of leadership. (Maybe Byakuya would be Captain Commander?)"
bleach,3dwxug,rickEbobby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:17 2015 UTC,there would have been zero advantage in revealing it.   Then you remember every character explains exactly how their abilities work to their enemies...
bleach,3dwxug,Kashim77,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"Shunsui: Well his swords are about making child's play real for anyone in his nearby vicinity so it would probably be that (his shikai) but on another level. I'm guessing juryooni (i'm trying to say gravity demon, sorry i wish i knew japanese :D), where he he can say ""up"" or ""down"" and shunsui and the person he's fighting (hashwalt, get ready :p) cant go down to or would be stuck on ground (cant jump or float). If used well, this could be a big advantage because if arrows are coming at him and he cant dodge on time he can say ""up, juryooni"" and both he and the person would go higher but the arrows would miss.  Blind demon (mouoni?) where maybe shunsui's eyes turns white, his opponent and he cant see, bad move but if he comes with nanao, maybe a kido would help. And also any blow given by shunsui in his bankai would cause more damage than if delivered to him as usual.  Blood demon (Ketsuoni) is possible, and maybe the reason ukitake said shunsui shouldnt use his bankai where people are. He looses small blood his opponent looses far more but what i cant predict is the range: how would he win if they both loose blood? or both stuck to the ground?   Cant think of any other thing for shunsui, but i bet he physically changes. Btw why i put demon at the end of these moves is because his shikai has those names in its moves kageone (shadow demon) irooni takaoni.  Aizen is way too OP to have a bankai. I believe by merging with the hogyukou he lost the bankai in some way.  Kisuke's all about the energy moves in his sword, its called the red princess (Benihime), sword would probably change into a royal looking japanese weapon, something red on it, and his cloth might change shape into a red prince attire (which would be amusing), then a lot of cero looking ittokazo blasts in the moves: Which would explain why he told sado its not meant for training.  Hisagi: His sword turns to grim-reaper's scythe maybe, more blood he spills (or the more closer to death he is) the stronger he becomes, somehow. I hope his hair color changes at least, let him get a badass appearance in his bankai like renji.  Edit: Ukitake: Well if he survives all i can think of with his bankai is that he doesnt need to be attacked to amplify it and fire back, he'll have moves of electricity and water too or more dangerous, he can absorb reiatsu and use it or maybe since his swords have five charms between them that amplify the attack,his bankai might store the lasts energy blasts used against it and use it at will? (5 charms? they wont just become items for fashion in bankai, there must be a reason they are exactly 5)"
bleach,3dwxug,Thief_Extraordinaire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:04:12 2015 UTC,Maybe Ukitake's is similar to Yumichika's
bleach,3dwxug,COMPLIMENT-4-U,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"Well maybe it would have the same function, but it wont be in the same way (stationary, and involving seeds that is)  I just checked videos of his zampaktou (sogyo no kotowari) in human form because i remember they were kids and was wondering how two tiny children held off ukitake in that sword arc where the swords torn to human form.  Turns out they bring out a scroll, which summons 2 fans that float in the air. The fans can bring out lightning and spikes and they, like shunsui's sword, like to play games.  Now i'm very sure his appearance would change if he ever gets to show his bankai."
bleach,3dwxug,Thief_Extraordinaire,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Aizen's Bankai is probably something like, whatever happens in the illusion becomes real.  Kubo probably avoided having him use Bankai because characters were throwing around Tsukuyomi and Izanami in Naruto at the same time. People already were saying Kishi and Kubo were copying each other, but they would have lost it if Aizen revealed his Bankai was just a genjutsu from Naruto.  Urahara's Bankai should be something with a special ability, unlike his Shikai which is just melee. He told Renji it couldn't be used to train with someone. Which means it incapacitates the target rather than just hitting them to deal damage. It will be something related to blood because we've seen Benihime's Shikai uses his blood."

bleach,3dwxug,oetsuthebest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:11 2015 UTC,"Shunsui's will probably be something relating to a game of some sort. I don't want to say chess or checkers but with humans, etc. (But that would be super rad.) But maybe some kind of extension of what his shikai does?  Kisuke's has to do with blood. It either...   Drains the blood out of a target so he may harness it and control it at will. Controls blood in different states of matter, making it an incredible weapon. Destroys the cells of the people it cuts. Decays their bodies over time.   Some others, like Shinji or some vizards are mentioned in one of my posts here  Ukitake probably harnesses the absolute powers of another person/people. His power IS to steal the powers of others, so to speak. And all zanpakuto shikai/bankai are related.   The thing though is that all of you are freaking out over seeing some bankai, when there are some characters who haven't even shown us a shikai. Nemu, Yoroichi, Tetsuzaemon (his released command/ability), Isane (Ability?) , the two boys that served under Ukitake as Lts. before rukia is promoted, Hachigen, Mashiro, and Nanao to name a few."
bleach,3dwxug,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:31:51 2015 UTC,"Don't know about kisuke's bankai since he once said to renji that his bankai is not suited for training. Considering the sound his shikai makes and it's traits, i think it should have something to do with fireworks/explosion. It's probably safe not to assume people that did not show their bankai when fighting against Aizen don't have one/useless. Yamamoto's bankai for example have serious side effects (extreme heat to a certain radius,would have killed him if he used it for a long amount of time and would have destroyed Soul Society), Shunsui's one the other hand was warned by Ukitake not to use it where everyone can see them so it's safe to assume that it has something to do with sight. As for Aizen, he never had the need to use his bankai, thats how OP his shikai is. Once you are under his hypnosis, there is no escaping it. Say Aizen does use his bankai, it probably will be reality shattering (altering reality) or it could be as simple just extending the radius of it's effect( for example,anyone who have seen his shikai will be under it's hypnosis when he releases his bankai, regardless where they are). You could take hyourinmaru for example, even toshiro said that the difference between his shikai and bankai is just the amount of ice it makes(and his bankai IS the STRONGEST ice zanpaktou)."

Everything he does is ultimately motivated by his quest for knowledge or to protect the knowledge he's already attained.  As long as you don't tamper with his pursuit of information in any meaningful capacity, or come across like a rube, he's relatively harmless like rickE above me said."

Mayuri is pretty harmless if you leave him at his machinations (although that's what landed him on Maggot's Nest in the first place) or if you ended as one of his guinea pigs. He is notoriously cruel in his ways, typical mad scientist like, and no subject is too taboo for his work ethic.

bleach,3dvyst,Tumor159,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:39 2015 UTC,You can skip them if you really want. Luckily the Bount arc is the only one they tried to shoehorn into the main series (you'll see the mod souls and certain Bount characters through the first few episodes of the Arrancar arc). You can always go back and watch them if you really need a Bleach fix.

He didn't foresee Mimihagi's interference, not even the slightest hint. Perhaps godlike beings exist outside of the perceptible future? Or are you asking about Yhwach's power? As far as we know, Haschwalth becomes a vessel for Yhwach's powers whilst Yhwach rests, in return transferring his power of balance or beauty or something to Yhwach. If Yhwach were to be suddenly and forcefully awoken I could see his power being stuck with Haschwalth, or perhaps the sudden recall of power would kill Haschwalth.

He was under the impression that defeating his Inner Hollow once meant he wouldn't have any more problems. That fear prevented him from using his Hollow mask as well as he did before. So, his mask didn't give him as much of a power boost and broke easier than when he would use it against Ulquiorra or Grimmjow.  Aizen said that the reemergence of his Inner Hollow meant he had unlocked more of its power. Its unclear if he meant a stronger mask or maybe that Ichigo was capable of learning Resurreccion.

Chapter 411, Bachgetsu tells Ichigo his own suppressed fear is the reason for his inability to perform a hollowfication. Ichigo asks what he should do, as in, does Bach intend for Ichigo to remaster Zangetsu. Bach replies with no, and kicks the shit out of him with zangetsu at his side. Ichigo had no control over his zanpakuto or his hollow at that point."
bleach,3dveww,Captain_Guava,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"zanpakuto or his hollow at that point   Just to be pedantic, technically his hollow and his zanpakutou at that point were the same thing. OMZ wasn't either of those, he just pretended to be his zanpakutou."
bleach,3dveww,Ceegee93,3,Sun Jul 19 23:02:56 2015 UTC,"Zangetsu was never Ichigo's true zanpakuto until his spirit was properly forged into an asauchi. Bach suppressed Zangetsu and funnelled small portions of his power through a spirit weapon, which he called Ichigo's zanpakuto, in order to prevent Ichigo from becoming fully realized. However over time, Bach began helping Ichigo and giving him more power, encouraging his growth. Ichigo eventually reached the conclusion that both were Zangetsu, and that's why he's got two zanpakuto now. Nobody knew Bach was a fake until it was explained by Nimaiya. So, Zangetsu was still a hollow Ichigo couldn't control, and Bach was still the Zangetsu who wouldn't lend Ichigo any power. It's not that being pedantic is bad, it's just I wasn't being careless."
bleach,3dveww,Captain_Guava,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how it happened or why Ichigo didn't know about it or anything like that. The fact remains, Hichigo/Zangetsu was the real Zangetsu and the source of his hollow/shinigami powers, OMZ was a fake and was trying to stop Ichigo from being a shinigami in the first place. Ichigo doesn't make the conclusion that they are literally both Zangetsu, he comes to the conclusion that they're both his zanpakutou specifically, not Zangetsu. They both contribute their power and are both his zanpakutou at that point. Before the reforging, OMZ even outright states that hollow Ichigo is the true Zangetsu/his true Zanpakutou."
bleach,3dveww,Ceegee93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:14 2015 UTC,"You're overcomplicating it now. It does matter because I was speaking of that specific moment in time, not overall. At that time, Zangetsu was just a hollow to Ichigo, one he rejected after he was hollowfied. Bach was his zanpakuto, at least according to Ichigo. So, my statement still stands. At that point, he had both a hollow and a zanpakuto that he could not control."
bleach,3dveww,Captain_Guava,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:53 2015 UTC,Which is why it's called being pedantic and pointing out that technically Ichigo was wrong and OMZ wasn't his zanpakutou... That's the point of being pedantic...
bleach,3dveww,Ceegee93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"You pointed out a completely unrelated technicality, because either way Zangetsu was a hollow Ichigo couldnt control and Bach was a 'zanpakuto' Ichigo couldn't control. Then again, you're right. That's the point of being pedantic. Being overly concerned with minute detail.   Also, Ichigo specifically says: 'I'm sure you're both Zangetsu.' This was a waste of my time and your own time."

bleach,3dubud,anubhavrana567,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:25 2015 UTC,I recommend watching Fate/Zero and Fate/Ultimate Blade Works TV series.
bleach,3dubud,Zil_v_a,2,Sun Jul 19 16:55:52 2015 UTC,I haven't seen fate yet but I know they have unlimited money so the comparison isn't really fair.
bleach,3dubud,EspadaPrimera,4,Sun Jul 19 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"Bleach started long ago and was always a lengthy series, so they had to cut corners, true. My intention wasn't really to compare. Just wanted to give a good recommendation to someone who didn't see anything more beautiful than Bleach.  That also makes me remember. If you like good background art, Mushishi is also worth checking out. It has absolutely no action though.   And Mononoke too. That one has some action, and really inspired trippy visuals. They show supernatural stuff with truly supernatural imagery."

bleach,3dubud,COMPLIMENT-4-U,3,Sun Jul 19 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Still not as good as the VN. Lacks the internal monologues. But it's pretty good. I wouldn't call it exactly groundbreaking like I would fate/zero, but it's an above-average anime.  The story is...just bigger. Not longer, just bigger than in the original series. Characters like Caster and Lancer get far more personality with their own plotlines and the reasoning that everyone has makes sense. This time around it's definitely more than just a gloryfied deathmatch.   I'd give it an A+. Not an S, but a solid A+. Especially with all the tat that's coming out nowadays. It's honestly refreshing to get a good series every now and then."

If you haven't seen Fate/Zero before, than I suggest starting from that.  About the two other animes I mentioned: Mushishi is a slice of life, talking about problems of people and society. A very different kind of anime for when you want to see something more intellectual, to develop yourself.   Mononoke is similar in that manner, it does however have a good chunk of action scenes and the overly-artistic approach voids it of much meaning. It's not to be taken too seriously, even if it may appear that. It's worth a watch when you want something very original."

bleach,3dubud,Alkura,2,Sun Jul 19 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I hate doing this but I must say that One Piece had better animation.  What they did in OP was to cut the episode super short, so that the production would cost less, giving them an ability to be on par with shorter series and avoid fillers (OP has almost none).   Every episode starts with an up to 4 minutes long opening and a minute  and a half long introduction bit about Gol D. Roger, after what we often get a re-cap of the previous episode. Then the episode itself, about 12 to 15 minutes of content. Completed by an ending and a ""what's coming next panel"".

What Oda is always doing is using shapes to envoke emotions and responses for visual description of characters. Given that One Piece was supposedly aimed at Kids, it's not a bad choice and makes it all original.   Bleach takes a realistic approach, because it has a more grounded story with heavier topics. It simply benefits more from looking how it does.   In theory both are as proper and an opinion is subjective. I do like the realistic stuff more myself as well. It makes characters easier to like and the world more consistent. Ever now and then one piece has a character that's just over, or sometimes under designed."

bleach,3dt15e,blazevichs,3,Sun Jul 19 05:34:11 2015 UTC,I don't know if Zaraki would be able to kill him 12 times... Hercules' Noble Phantasm is pretty ridiculous.

bleach,3dt15e,Deefian,5,Sun Jul 19 16:25:10 2015 UTC,Which Berserker?
bleach,3dt15e,skillex67,2,Sun Jul 19 04:36:57 2015 UTC,Any iterations of Berserker.
bleach,3dt15e,darthnick426,4,Sun Jul 19 04:48:35 2015 UTC,It depends if Kenapchi can kill Berserker quickly enough to realize that he's just going to keep coming back until you kill him twelve times and it will depend on if Kenpachi doesn't just take his time to enjoy the fight. (I assume we're talking about Hercules)  If he's fighting Fate/Zero Berserker....I'm not sure. Berserker's sword skills are far superior to Kenapchi's. It really depends how much Berserker adapts to Kenpachi and what he's using as his Noble Phantasm in the fight.  I'd like to say Kenpachi could beat them if he was serious from the get go but both Berserkers seem to be much faster and have better reaction times than Kenpachi. Plus they'll be wounding Kenpachi the entire fight while Kenpachi will probably just be laughing and enjoying himself. By the time Kenpachi actually starts fighting for real it might be too late.  This brings up other questions I have for you OP.  Who do you think would win in these match ups:   Byakuya Kuchiki vs Archer (F/SN) (100 million Blades vs Unlimited Blade Works) Ichigo vs Saber (Getsuga Tensho vs Excalibur) Lancer vs Nnoitra (Lulz they have the same voice actor)
bleach,3dt15e,Zeta42,3,Sun Jul 19 06:07:40 2015 UTC,"Byakuya Kuchiki vs Archer (F/SN)   Byakuya should be able to take this. F/Z Archer, on the other hand...   Ichigo vs Saber   Hard choice. Ichigo can win if he's faster.   Lancer vs Nnoitra   ""Gay Bulge!"" gg"
bleach,3dt15e,Kerrigor2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:04 2015 UTC,"As long as Archer can fully activate Unlimited Blade Works (if he doesn't have to fight with just projection), he would crush Byakuya.  Ichigo v. Saber I might give to Ichigo, unless Saber has Avalon.  Lancer v. Nnoitra isn't even a question. Both Fate/Stay Night Lancer and Fate/Zero Lancer could annihilate him."
bleach,3dt15e,darthnick426,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:26:44 2015 UTC,"Ichigo vs Saber and Lancer vs Nnoitra I can certainly agree with your assessment of. That being said.... not sure I agree with the Archer vs Byakuya assessment. I don't think Archer would crush him. Byakuya has plenty that can counter the majority of what Archer has. I honestly don't see Archer winning unless he projects Excalibur to be honest. Rho Aias isn't going to help him from the blades coming at him from several directions. Plus it's not like Archer is manipulating all of his swords at once in Unlimited Blade Works. Plus factoring in his speed and kido, Byakuya could easily pin him down long enough to finish him.  Archer is really strong but you're really underselling Byakuya here."
bleach,3dt15e,Kerrigor2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:44:16 2015 UTC,"Being able to project an unlimited number of near-perfect replicas of almost every Noble Phantasm he's ever seen makes Unlimited Blade Works one of the most ridiculously overpowered abilities ever.   Remember how big an explosion he caused when he used Caladbolg as an arrow? He could just throw replicas of that at Byakuya until an explosion hits him. He could use Lancer's Gae Bolg on him if he really wanted to.  It might be a closer fight than I initially thought, but Unlimited Blade Works is only—maybe—surpassed in overpoweredness by the Gate of Babylon. And the fact that it can work as a Reality Marble is just another point in its favour.  As much of a badass as Byakuya is, I still think Archer would win. If Ichigo can outrun Byakuya's bankai with his Tensa Zangetsu, and the enhanced speed it gives him, then Archer can probably outpace it too, at least for a while. And Rho Aias isn't the only shield that Archer can project. It's just the strongest one."
bleach,3dt15e,upads,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:13 2015 UTC,"Hi I got redirected here from /r/Fatestaynight hope you don't mind me budging in about Archer's abilities.  I'm a huge fan of both Archers but I think people are misunderstanding him a lot.  Able to project but not able to fully utilize them due to weapon mastery is a big hurdle for Archer. That's why you often see him fighting with his twin blades, not only they cost little to project, they also have accompanied him on his quest for the longest in his life time.  When training with a weapon, you body gradually changes and develops shape to wield said weapon more and more efficiently.  However, due to EMIYA being a modern hero, he lacks the legendary skills and body build necessary to wield the weapons to the ultimate limits.  CaladbolgII is used as a broken phantasm, takes time to charge up and uses up a lot of mana.  Using a sword initially in UBW costs no mana, but re-tracing a destroyed weapon will cost mana.  Archer also cannot use Gae Bolg's ability because it is a runic spear, Archer doesn't have the compatibility to use it let alone unleashing it.  Unlimited Blade Works is only broken at the first sound of it, but after a deeper look it is actually not as game breaking at all. Any servants who are close combat orientated will be able to take on Unlimited Blades Work with caution.  Rho Aias will only work against projectile weapon, not quite sure if Byakuya's bankai"
bleach,3dt15e,StriderT,0,Mon Jul 20 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say as long as Archer can activate Unlimited Blade Works, he would win.  As long as Saber doesn't have Avalon, Ichigo definitely.   Lancer all the way. Nnoitra doesn't stand a chance against Gae Bolg."

He says his release command every single time he uses it. If it's his shikai, wouldn't it behoove him more to just say ""Hey look at my sword!"" and then activate it without the release command? Also how the hell can Kubo write his way out of this one if he does have a bankai? He has absolute hypnosis already. I really can't see anything better than that unless he is given the power to manipulate the fabric of multi dimensional spacetime, which would just be the epitome of DBZ syndrome."

Given that he's only recently been able to hear Nozarashi's voice, and that Bankai is heavily base don the relationship between the zanpakuto spirit and the user, I think it's highly unlikely that he should have a Bankai at this point.  The only way that I'd think it acceptable for him to have bankai would be if Yachiru was an aspect of Nozarashi all along - but that's something Kubo's playing very coy about."

Or his bankai is just the best thing ever. Or he has every single bankai. Ichibei, start bringing back your pals, already."

Is Aizen aiming to once again force his hand inside the submissive brunette?  Crack ship time:  I think a good match for Ichigo would be the final boss from Naruto. It'd be like him and White, but straight.  Someone should get with Byakuya to ensure that the Kuchiki clan lives on... like maybe Rukia. Renji can just keep barking at the moon till he drowns in the lake.  Chad and Yuzu both go crazy over cute things. They could open a store for stuffed animals and use Kon as their mascot.  Harribel and Yhwach. She's a Hollow and he has the power to fill out the emptiness in people's souls.  Ishida and Nemu would make a nice couple. Her father would never approve and Nemu has access to every drug imaginable. It'd be just like Romeo and Juliet.  Soifon acts so cute around Yuushirou, but someone like her deserves Omaeda. They make a nice contrast with their bodies.  Liltotto sorta looks like young Jugo and acts like old Jugo. Bazz gets a tomboy that's practically an old friend.  Chair x Couch is really comfy.  Momo's body was made to have Kyoka Suigetsu inserted into it. Aizen is now one with his zanpakuto.  Tsukishima making Orihime question, ""Why me hurt?"" was one of the best parts of that arc.

And didn't even fuel themselves on their own reiatsu, but on Muramasa's.  Now, if we just go back to actual canon logic after that, her being a zanpakuto would be impossible. Even if Kenpachi has a lot of reiatsu, I doubt that'd be able to fuel her far away, as they have been separated sometimes, but she is still in life. I highly doubt her being his zanpakuto, but if that is possible, then to be honest, I won't lie, that would be really awesome. C: Even though I doubt it, I'll hold my thumbs for it with you."

She can't actually be Pernida considering Gerard uses Pernida's first name and Askin's surname, implying Pernida was a member of the Schutzstaffel before the second invasion, but I think that Pernida is a parasitic Quincicar, maybe a previous experiment of Aizen's, and it has to attach to a body in order to use its ability since it requires speech, and it prefers younger vessels so it went for Yachiru.  Or it would be kinda funny if it were a tick who bit Yhwach and gained a Schrift by drinking his blood. Either way, I think it's gotta be some sort of parasite if Yachiru is going to be related."
bleach,3drgxv,Andygoesrawr,2,Sun Jul 19 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a relating theory to it.  I didn't really understand what Ywach did back with Auschwällen (did I spell that right?), so one my theories isn't that it's Aizen's experiments, but, the Quincy powers he absorbed back when he killed Masaki and other 'impure' Quincies. That it's all of them pressed together, which could also explain it's power.  This theory is a longshot and maybe not even it, as yours sounds more believable, but it reminded me of this."

Yhwach was recruiting Arrancars, and I'm suggesting Pernida was an especially powerful one, possibly one of Aizen's experiments, and so Yhwach made it a Schutzstaffel because of its abilities and the way they complement The Compulsory.  I'm thinking Pernida will be a fully ""purified"" Arrancar, though. So we might see what happens to a Hollow when their mask is fully removed, since Pesche and Dondochakka wear costumes."
bleach,3drgxv,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:26:53 2015 UTC,"The elite seemed like they were guarding yhwach from quite a long time and had full confidence while talking to each other . Lille barro seems pretty confident with pernida , even understanding his unique way of talking . They dont seem to like new entries , like showed when uryu joined them and clearly all of them suspected him . Now , why wouldnt they suspect some parasit made from aizen who recently got in the elite and could possibly be a threat to yhwach too ?"
bleach,3drgxv,oetsuthebest,2,Sun Jul 19 03:33:25 2015 UTC,"We have absolutely no way of knowing for how long the Schutzstaffel have existed, nor for how long Pernida has been one. Yhwach could've started recruiting Arrancars as soon as Aizen was defeated, or even 9 years ago before Aizen fully took over Hueco Mundo.  Anyway, the Aizen part is entirely secondary. Pernida might've been a Quincicar from 1,000 years ago. It really doesn't matter."
bleach,3drgxv,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:12 2015 UTC,Only a question : why do you think it is a parasite ?
bleach,3drgxv,oetsuthebest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:49:59 2015 UTC,I just thought.. does this mean Oetsu killed Yachiru and Yhwach revived her? lol
bleach,3drgxv,shiba_keikaku,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"No, I think it's some sort of headcrab, which means Ouetsu only stabbed and killed the parasite. Though if it's some sort of blood parasite, I imagine Yachiru's life would depend on the parasite remaining alive."
bleach,3drgxv,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The eyes that can be seen under the hood are probably those of the parasite, so I guess he would have aimed there. The blood thing was pretty much what I was thinking, though. There's a reason Mayuri is there, I suppose. They'll have to do something other than just Kenpachi it off her."
bleach,3drgxv,shiba_keikaku,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:09 2015 UTC,Wow if she is Pernida that would be a huge plot twist imo! I actually wouldn't doubt that it could be her.
bleach,3drgxv,vixylia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"I know, right? I'm pretty hyped over Pernida. It can be anyone too. S/he is as big of a mystery as Yachiru right now. And Kira's actual status. Kenpachi shouldn't just have cut it, he should have dragged off that cloak. We need answers."
bleach,3drgxv,oetsuthebest,3,Sat Jul 18 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"like the others said , it is a mystery that has been going on for a little man . we dont know for sure , the popular theory seems to be that she is the zanpakuto of kenpachi . i didnt want to believe this because there are many contrary reasons (like her having her shikai for example , or the fact that his zanpakuto speaks to zaraki once ) , but re-reading the chapters i found strange the part of the release . when zaraki calls the name of nozarashi , we get to see yachiru and her flashback with kenpachi where he asks her name , saying that they both dont have any . that was the last time we saw her , wich coincides with the release of the shikai"
bleach,3drgxv,Zil_v_a,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"Well, this is the biggest ""for"" argument. Back in Turn Back the Pendulum, Shinji explains that ""If someone dies their clothes become reishi. If they disappear leaving their clothes behind, it means that they didn't die. They lost their ability to retain human form. That's the only explanation"".  The last line of the explanation is what makes you think that it should apply here. Meaning that whatever happened had to affect her soul itself. Being dragged back to a sword you've once been a part of is a good idea to what might disintegrate her."
bleach,3drgxv,oetsuthebest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:45:18 2015 UTC,"Well it is kinda possible this might be the case , though some things dont coincide : how could yachiru come into creation without kenpachi knowing ? Why did she have a non related with kenpachi shikai ?kenpachi's zan talked to him already . Hope we get some explanations soon man , i hate mysteries being drained out for too long , like that time when kisuke was ""on the verge of death"" in hueco mundo"
bleach,3drgxv,Zil_v_a,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"We can say that Yachiru is the sword just stepping out of the blade because Ken doesn't want to talk with it. An act of desperation you may say.   The problematic part is the shikai. That's the main reason why the theory is hard to believe. Especially since they showed it just before the fight with Gremmy, so they could've just not have shown it at all.  After all if she's the blade, then we won't see that shikai ever again."
bleach,3drgxv,oetsuthebest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:34:39 2015 UTC,"Yes , that and the fact that kenpachi seems to already have talked to his zanpakuto . However man , i liked yachiru as a character appart . I dont think there was a motive or a plot hole for which yachiru should be his sword at all . I mean , kubo should have let her be like it was till now"

bleach,3drgxv,kilfuksoulshitter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:33:41 2015 UTC,She depleted her blood sugar when using her powers.  So she has to go to a bunch of candy shops before she's good again.. If she isn't in a diabetic coma.  Or maybe unohana sliced her to bits as a back up way to make zaraki go full kenpachi if fighting him didn't work.  Dbz level anger would be the plan b.
bleach,3dqfes,newtype06,16,Sat Jul 18 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"This isn't all that crazy. Speech Ichigo makes after defeating Aizen describes him as ""someone born without an equal"", as if Aizen always lived in a different world. We have absolutely no clues that would indicate that whatever Aizen wanted was evil. All we know is that he wanted to get it by evil means. Was good enough for Tousen."
bleach,3dqfes,Zil_v_a,4,Sat Jul 18 15:24:06 2015 UTC,Aizen trains Ichigo to kill Watch and the new soul king Aizen always seemed like a valid theory to me.
bleach,3dqfes,BishSticks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"Are we forgetting both times he tortured Momo?  And the other people he killed, and used? And he used Tousen, that dude was a complete moron, sorry."
bleach,3dqfes,ShiaLaBuff,4,Sun Jul 19 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"I think that they are saying that he's a ""the ends always justify the means"" sorta guy."
bleach,3dqfes,kyle2143,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"And what I'm saying is, he had no good intentions. He didn't care about being good to people, it was always about himself, that is why he tried to slowly kill Momo, twice, and was so cruel to everyone else. There was NO reason to do that to her other than to relish in being totally evil, he did NOT have to do that to her to make himself stronger to save everyone from some actual evil being. He IS the evil being.  That's what I'm saying, he had Tousen completely fooled. He made him think they had to kill people that got in their way, Aizen did so much more than that. He toyed with people, used them, did all kinds of shit that was unnecessary purely because he WANTED to, not because he needed to.  So, he was most definitely without a doubt evil and had evil and selfish intentions, that seriously cannot be argued. He MIGHT have changed now, given all the time he had to think without any distractions, but he was evil before that."
bleach,3dqfes,ShiaLaBuff,2,Sun Jul 19 05:08:54 2015 UTC,"Have you maybe watched ""Code Geass""? I think it might be a similar idea to what that story told. ""Take all the evil, embody it and disappear with it"".  Just a crackpot theory though."
bleach,3dqfes,Zil_v_a,8,Sun Jul 19 10:30:02 2015 UTC,"This could very well be true. When Aizen fights Ichigo and Renji, he stops Ichigo's bankai with a finger and slashes him saying he meant to cut him in half from the waist, but it was too shallow. He then proceeds to not finish him off and turn his attention to slashing Renji instead. I'm just saying, a captain level Shinigami who's supposed to be evil would have gone the distance IMO. What we thought was plot armor could very well have been intentional. I'm  not sure I'm  willing to believe Kubo had that much foresight though when the manga reads so procedurally generated.   Here's the video in question. Bonus Center of Attraction."
bleach,3dqfes,jumykn,7,Sat Jul 18 15:51:25 2015 UTC,We've had a LOT of big time long term payoffs as of the last Arc. Some of it relating back to the beginning of the manga. None of it would surprise me if any of it was foreshadowing.
bleach,3dqfes,chaosattractor,7,Sat Jul 18 16:01:50 2015 UTC,"I know right, I really don't know why people think Kubo seemingly making up some plot elements on the fly means the whole thing is random and unplanned. It's a weekly serial - none of us has the full story. Time and time again those ""random"" events turn out to be part of a much bigger picture, so why not give him the benefit of the doubt?  It's particularly funny because you know who else makes up plot points as he writes? George freaking Martin. Yet I'm 99.9% sure that no-one here would say that A Song of Ice and Fire is ""unplanned"" or that all the connections and foreshadowing in the series are just ""retcons""."
bleach,3dqfes,jumykn,8,Sat Jul 18 16:35:39 2015 UTC,I just looked up some Bleach foreshadowing. Let me just say I'm completely wrong about the procedural generation.

bleach,3dqfes,oetsuthebest,5,Sat Jul 18 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Sort of unrelated, but why does Aizen's shunpo here sound like it did when he had merged with the hogyoku and evolved? It has that metallic grinding ring to it instead of the typical rush of air thing. I know it's just an anime effect, but that's still odd. Shunpo, Hirenkyaku, Sonido, and Aizen's thing all sound different; obviously intentional. But at this point isn't he still just a shinigami, and should therefore have the shunpo effect?    I don't know. I probably need to go to sleep or something."
bleach,3dqfes,oetsuthebest,11,Sat Jul 18 21:05:00 2015 UTC,Good guy aizen ? Do you really think it may be possible ?
bleach,3dqfes,_Jias_,7,Sat Jul 18 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"As crazy as it sounds....quite possibly. For some reason I never got a bad guy vibe from him, even when he was going all Hogyoku-mad. It was like falling to pieces was a part of his plan and he was covering it up by acting like a fool. He's far too smart to let his arrogance blind him from what is obviously happening to him. Even with denial factored in. He's feeling himself lose control, there's no way he couldn't be feeling things happening to his own body."
bleach,3dqfes,oetsuthebest,10,Sat Jul 18 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"I gotta say i never got the stereotypical bad guy vibe from him too , it is like he is trying to get things at the right place even if he gotta dirty his hands . While there are some bad things he did , he also showed to be merciful letting the gotei alive , including isshin kisuke and yuroichi . The talk at the end , how the world should be let me suspect he is not entirely evil . But , i think he is the type of guy that thinks only him has the power to put the thing in the right place , while standing on top . I dont really see him sacrifice himself . Then you can clearly see that he holds resentement against ichigo after being freed ."
bleach,3dqfes,jumykn,8,Sat Jul 18 13:59:49 2015 UTC,"He could have easily erased Ichigo's friends in Karakura, too. I never really got an elitist vibe from him, just someone who acts like he's come to peace with what's actually a shitty fate. Like, he acts like he's content, but he's probably dead inside because he knows what he has to do, because he's the only one that can see it. I think he has to keep up this act as long as he can, until they bring him close enough to Ywach. That way it's a future that Ywach can't see with his special eyes."

bleach,3dqfes,BaronRafiki,7,Sat Jul 18 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"I also have an odd feeling that once he did see his future, at his ""completed form"" with the Hogyoku, that it had a lot to do with why they fell apart. Like, he saw what is to come and realized how fucked he was, which made the Hogyoku reject him because he lost his resolve. Maybe Mugen had a lot to do with that, in aiding showing him. Maybe that darkness from FGT showed him the future that he couldn't handle.    Take what you want from any of this, they're all relatively isolated thoughts. Still, it's to think about."
bleach,3dqfes,Tezzeret,5,Sat Jul 18 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"I guess, the entire point of this thread is there is something going on with Aizen that we're just not seeing yet. Kubo is hiding something about him, and it's a whopper. But what is it?"
bleach,3dqfes,KristophGavin,6,Sat Jul 18 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"Man i gotta say i relate to almost everything you're saying about him . Aizen is my second favourite character , and that because he's the deeper villain i've ever seen . He smiles , but clearly he isnt happy . In one of the best parts in the manga , gin's betrayal , ""death"" of aizen and death of gin you can realize his pain and saddness . He knows he's taken a lone path . He predicted gin was about to betray him , but he didnt know for sure i think . He was pretty angry and sad about it and there he realized he was truly alone . You can see the remorse and pain in his face when he is falling on the ground . Then he geta up and kills gin . At first you can see he is sad about this shit , but then he smiles again because he knew it would come to this and he accepted his fate . Man i hope we learn something more about him"

bleach,3dqfes,xNexx_,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, from what we've seen of Aizen, his end game doesn't appear to be evil. Has he used evil means to attain his goal? Yeah. He worked with hollows (and then promptly cut them down once they served their purpose). He also turned against all of Soul Society. He's definitely done some fucked up shit (ahem, Momo).   However, his end game doesn't appear to be evil. His conversation with Ukitake in the SS arc kinda points this out. His conversation with Urahara while being sealed doesn't seem to be the talk of an evil man, but it seems to be the talk of a man disgusted by the current system.  It seems like Aizen never really wanted to destroy Soul Society. He just hated the king. He could have easily killed the captains in FKT when he chose to just cut them down. He also didn't want to join Yhwach because Yhwach made a mess of Soul Society. Aizen seems to just want the king dead - not soul society."
bleach,3dqfes,KaiserNova123,7,Sat Jul 18 20:04:32 2015 UTC,crazy?.. i was with the understanding that aizen secretly being a good guy was one of the more popular theories...
bleach,3dqfes,MrSterlock,9,Sat Jul 18 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's certainly reasonable to think that given Bleach's development of the ""Bad"" guys OFTEN turns out with them becoming good guys. Byakuya and Renji were initially introduced as villains. This is largely forgotten, someone who did not know the franchise would have watched a large amount of episode/chapters with them considered villians. Even Ishida was originally portrayed as a counter to Ichigo in KK-Town Bad Shinigami? Gin and even Mayuri have been portrayed as villianous characters only to turn out to be heroes. What about the Hollows? We've got a cast of good Hollows from the always nice Nell, to Grimmjow whom has taken sides with the entire gang. The Fullbringers, again, developed into a villianous plot that have now become allies. Even Sternritter have turned out not to be entirely a bad group. Ranging from Bazz-B who always wanted to stop the ""True Bad Guy"" Ywach, to a handful of others like Giselle and Lollinette. I have my reservations about Hashwalth too, I still think he has some epoch old plan that involves him becoming ""evil"" for the sake of somehow tricking Ywach. Ywach can SEE the future, but he can't know the thoughts of others or the actions of the past. Bazz-B and Hashwalth made a pact to defeat Ywach. Anyway, my point is, many characters have turned out not to be straight up ""Evil, Bad or Villians"" (All three words do have different meaning). I think it's reasonable to think that Aizen has knowledge of something that we have yet to fully understand or that he will be ironically FORCED into becoming the inanimate Soul King if we the readers are provoked into believing that the requirement of a Soul King is both necessary and NOT an ""Evil"" doing of Soul Society."
bleach,3dqfes,Korrasch,4,Sat Jul 18 17:01:21 2015 UTC,That expands upon this wonderfully!
bleach,3dqfes,mindseye84,3,Sat Jul 18 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"i admit, i've always been a fan of Aizen having decent intentions. even if his means weren't the best. insert Rangiku, Gin, Tosen, and Karakura Town here"
bleach,3dqfes,MrSterlock,5,Sun Jul 19 01:48:35 2015 UTC,what if Urahara is the bad guy all along?
bleach,3dqfes,Alkura,7,Sat Jul 18 17:06:02 2015 UTC,"The more time goes on, the more doubtful I am that Urahara is a straight-up ""bad guy"".  He's shady as hell, but everything he does is for the ""greater good"".  He didn't need to save the Vizard, or Masaki - yet he did.  His plan to make the hogyoku inert did involve making Rukia lose her powers (without her consent) - but it didn't involve killing her, or causing her any pain.    My take is that he's a benevolent character - but one who doesn't necessarily care about anyone's individual wellbeing, in the face of a threat to the greater whole.  And he could certainly become an antagonist, simply because that philosophy will eventually clash with Ichigo's ""Save everyone - no exceptions, no compromise"" mentality."
bleach,3dqfes,MrSterlock,6,Sat Jul 18 18:14:08 2015 UTC,He gives me a guardian angel vibe.

He still has the ability to manipulate people's senses.  His zanpaktou has merged with him.  He may actually be planning on putting everyone in a sort of illusion, much like what happened in Naruto, with whatever his bankai is.  That may be a bit of a stretch though.

bleach,3ds1kt,AizenRaj,3,Sun Jul 19 02:55:08 2015 UTC,"One fact people are very keen to ignore is that Momo is a lieutenant, and in Bleach lieutenants are almost like transitional Captains just waiting for a vacancy. For instance, they're subject to Gentei Kaijou in the World of the Living just like their captains are.  She's the victim of Aizen's emotional abuse for most of the time we've known her, so I guess the reason her strength completely slips past us is because we find it difficult to reconcile her strength with the total emotional submission she has to Aizen.  So how could she tank those hits? Well, she's the lieutenant of the strongest captain out of the entire Gotei 13 and she wasn't even actually tanking them for that long.  It looked like it, sure, but Bleach is a massive victim of Anime Time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO2Vw1Y4b4Y"
bleach,3ds1kt,ChaosKeeshond,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:25:09 2015 UTC,Momo is strong but she isn't that strong. I do think that she is fast enough to switch with him at just the right moment. He probably switched with her at some point after tanking captains.

The entire ordeal before Hitsugaya ""froze"" aizen was Aizen fighting evident by him cutting the shinigami and vaizards which can only be done by him physically doing it   Lastly who knows when the EXACT time Aizen switched with Hinnamori all we know is that it was after Shunsuis ""attack"" or after Shinjis shikai but before Hitsugayas attack"

Or weed or something.  Joke around for like half an hour.  Then segue into, ""Dude I have to show you this.  Its sick.""  If he responds with, ""Is this going to be that gay Detergent anime or whatever the fuck?"", you respond with, ""Dude get over that shit.  This is just an awesome fight I came across.""  2.Show him the fight between Byakuya and Ichigo when the latter finally got his bankai.  The whole fight.  The hollow transformation is what's going to drive this fight home.  All that happens before is foreplay.  Keep the beer/weed going.  3.Watch his mind get fucked when Hichigo says, ""I'll show you how to use this Bankai!!""  4.Profit.

My friend was a big Harry potter fan and likes tv shows similar to supernatural, but not so big on anime. So I appealed to the supernatural side of her.   Then I showed her a fan made trailer for bleach. If you youtube search ""bleach final battle trailer"", it should be the first result. That sparked some interest in her, but she still didn't want to watch it because it was an anime.  So then I showed her hichigo's first appearance during the fight against byakuya. Her exact reaction.  ""So is this on Netflix or do you know a website I can binge watch this on....""  Appeal to the person's interest and go from there."

bleach,3dq4k2,shlundravacittoukaso,9,Sat Jul 18 10:27:07 2015 UTC,"Explanation: Kubo made a mistake.  Fansplanation which will appease your inner Bleach fan: he took it from a new Shinigami while it was still in its basic asauchi form.  edit: alternatively, we could just assume he had a sword and not a Zanpakuto. Shinigami can control the shape and form of their unreleased Zanpakuto, so why not?"
bleach,3dq4k2,ChaosKeeshond,7,Sat Jul 18 10:51:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, thats probably true.. In theory you can take any asauchi and put your spirit in it so it becomes your zanpakuto.."
bleach,3dq4k2,a310gintoki,3,Sat Jul 18 11:41:39 2015 UTC,"I checked. While it could be just a normal sword he was using at the time, the hilt coloring and guard shape match his zanpakuto's sealed form. He probably just took it from a dead guy.  Or it could be the fault of the animators. Kubo didn't color the scene himself, so perhaps it was meant to be a generic sword, but the animators accidentally made it his zanpakuto."
bleach,3dq4k2,Zil_v_a,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"This is what makes you think the two of them is not just a bromance.  Back to the topic, it has no form. So it's either a stolen asauchi or a random blade. Until a zanpakutou reaches a shikai it's pretty meaningless.  Also, I love how ghost-like is the behavior of Yachiru in this. She just pops up in places for no reason."
bleach,3dq4k2,Dotifo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:41 2015 UTC,The real question is why does the sheath transform into his shikai as well
bleach,3dq4k2,Deserak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:45:21 2015 UTC,"'Cause he sees his sheath is part of his weapon.  Zan grow from the users soul imprinting on them. The powers they develop reflect the weilder. Most consider the sheath just something to carry their sword so the sheath stays as just that. Ikkaku sees the sheath as another part of his weapon to fight with so it becomes part of his blade.  Ditto why ichigo lost his sheath going shikai - backing down and retreating isn't his style, and he released zangetsu with a ""charge forward"" mindset, so his sheath was replaced by bandages that can quickly fall out of the way when he quickdraws."

The sketch lines look awful though; I'm sure there's some sort of workaround for this. Either way, good job! This is a HUGE step up from your previous coloring. Oops, got my users mixed up.

Extinguirs purpose is to seal flames, since there are no flames in Zanka no Tachi ( atleast in first 3 stance), Wonderweiss would be useless."

bleach,3dmcvw,thomasemac,8,Fri Jul 17 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yama's Shikai isn't OP. Yama is OP, his Shikai seems like a standard Shikai that is stupidly strong because the user is stupidly strong.

If it was hisagi using it it'd probably be like 400 degrees sword and heat shield, and no one would care because it wouldn't do much to them and without Yama's speed most people would easily kite him."

If we're talking arrancars Barragan's ability is also really strong, and if we're talking quincy then Gremmy Thormeaux's visionary is just about unmatched in Hax. Yhwach's almighty is also extremely good, as are some of the Elite's abilities.  Just think about if every one of those characters was Yamamoto level, how strong they'd be. I guarantee you every single character, if they had as much reiatsu as Yamamoto (Ichibei and Yhwach may already fit this criteria), how much better than him they'd be."
bleach,3dmcvw,Teamkilleryo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"yeah , but the way you put it , it works only with reaitsu : by that logic , aizen's shikai is strong only because aizen is strong , and if a weak character used it , it wouldnt do shit ."
bleach,3dmcvw,oetsuthebest,2,Sat Jul 18 17:26:20 2015 UTC,No cause Aizen's power is dependent on utility. It doesn't scale linearly with reiatsu the same way Yamamoto's does.

bleach,3dmcvw,Jedy_hacker,4,Fri Jul 17 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Sigh  Let me put it this way. What if you gave Hisagi Yamamoto's bankai?  He would lose almost every fight. Not only is his ability to sustain bankai gonna be WAY shorter (I doubt he could even start it up, but let's assume he can) any Captain or their mother could simply avoid the Bankai till he ran out of juice since it's almost strictly melee. His kill count is  also probably lower than Yamamoto so south would be useless. And his reiatsu is barely, if even Captain level, so the effects of East or West would be really silly.  Yamamoto's bankai, if you think about, is actually quite a mediocre skill set. The reason it's so amazing is because Yamamoto is so strong it makes it amazing. Who would care about a 400 degree cloak of flames and a 400 degree sword? People care if it's 15 million degrees, but that's Yamamoto's reiatsu powering it."

bleach,3dmcvw,Teamkilleryo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Yama's shikai and bankai are incredibly powerful and difficult to handle which is why only Yhwach could steal his bankai while someone stronger than Kenpachi couldn't. That implies that you can't take his bankai and use a weaker 400 degree version.  If Hisagi was at the point where he could barely use it, he'd probably do something like Rukia and activate East for an instant, burning everything within a certain radius. If not that, he'd have a fake bankai like Renji, maybe the fake bankai used to beat Yhwach.  There's probably a base level of power required for and outputted by Yama's bankai."

Are you suggesting that Royd could take Yama's bankai and still be defeated by Yama when Roydwach could withstand Yama's shikai with just blut? It's far more likely that he couldn't control Yama's bankai due to its power.  Suggesting that Yama's bankai would only give Hisagi 400 degrees, when both Zanka no Tachi East and Zanka no Tachi West outright have ""sun"" in their names, is just wrong."

bleach,3dmcvw,oetsuthebest,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"According to Yamamoto's explanation of his own bankai, and Aizen's explanation of how Wonderweiss's ability, I don't think it would have worked. Yamamoto said ""all the flames that I posses are concentrated on the blades edge"". Wonderwiess's ability ironically works similarly: “Estinguir was created to … seal all the new flames within the blade so they can not be born again”. So if Yamamoto is already sealed his flames within his Zanpakutou by using bankai, then Wonderweiss's ability wouldn't have had any effect."
bleach,3dmcvw,whatacrappyusername,2,Sat Jul 18 06:39:14 2015 UTC,"yes i think he could in theory as his resurrecion's sole purpose is to contain ryujin jakka, but that is assuming it could contain the heat of his bankai as he did the flames of the shikai.

bleach,3dmcvw,jinchuuriki101,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"out of thin air   When giving Ichigo bankai training, Yoruichi stated that a bankai is usually 5-10 times stronger than the Shikai. And if Wonerbread had been made to seal Zanka no Tachi, that would make sense, but he was made to seal the Shikai. As Aizen said:   He was created for the sole purpose of suppressing your Ryujiin Jakka.   (Chapter 393, page 18 {possibly 19, MangaPanda is weird with wide pics}, panel 2)"
bleach,3dmcvw,HazelnutPi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"his zanpakuto is called ryujin jakka, the things he says for shikai and bankai are just commands, so if he is made to suppress ryujin jakka that means the whole zanpakuto not just the shikai. Also his ability for suppressing it isnt necessarily related to his fighting strength"

Aizen wouldn't even have access to records of the exact strength of Yamamoto's bankai, as the R&D department wasn't founded until a long time after his bankai was used. He DID however, have access to the levels of his Shikai, as said recording equipment existed at such a time that Yamamoto used his Shikai. So Aizen wouldn't know how strong to make Wonderwiess, and if he screwed up, and forced Yama to bankai, and ww wasn't enough, then that's make Aizen stupid. And he's anything but."
bleach,3dmcvw,HazelnutPi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:44:25 2015 UTC,"I reckon Yamamoto thought Wonderweiss would be able to. If there's a time you're going to use bankai it's against Aizen. And yet Yamamoto didn't pop it open after Wonderweiss stole his shikai flames. I think Yamamoto probably thought busting the bankai out would be pointless, because Wonderweiss' sole purpose was to be able to absorb his heat."
bleach,3dmcvw,tchales7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:58 2015 UTC,The answer is probably no but I don't think it's because Aizen didn't know his bankai would be powerful but because he knew Yama wouldn't dare to do recklessly use it in the world of the living and with KT being the battlefield. He didn't plan for it because it wasn't necessary to.
bleach,3dmcvw,richiegraine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:02 2015 UTC,the answer is no.  azien had to turn wonderwiess into a retard just to suppress the flames of his shikai  bankai is at least 5 to 10 times stronger.  but old man genocide didn't use his bankai for other reason   ie it would have affected an area far larger than fake karakura town  hurting real people.   either way since wonderwiess was absorbing not suppressing it would have just made him a bigger bomb thus accomplishing the purpose aizen made for him
bleach,3dmcvw,shonryukku,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:28 2015 UTC,Wonderweiss seals Yama's flames and Yama's Bankai  focuses all his flames into his sword so Yama couldn't use Bankai even if he wanted to he would have had to use Bankai before Wonderweiss sealed his flames. The reason Yama didn't use bankai is because its so powerful that it would had destroyed the pillars also since Yama's bankai is to focus the flames into his blade and the fact that Aizen could simply avoid Yama's sword with his shikai or trick him into killing Ichigo with his bankai made Yama go the other route of making an explosion big enough to engulf only the Fake Karakura town.

Like for someone who's black, you'd have to say brown for it to work. Since black people (in my experiences at least) aren't actually the color black, more of a dark brown.  But since the strength of his zanpakuto's effect is also dependent on how much of that color the user is showing, it wouldn't be useful against someone who doesn't have the same skin tone as you."

bleach,3dlchb,S0ulMadness,8,Fri Jul 17 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"Most likely the uncle had abused (if not done worse :/) to Haschwalth when he was a boy. If you look at his arms... they are all bruised and battered and he's always holding them. Also when Bazz called him ""Jugo"", Haschwalth hates that nickname because that's what him uncle calls him. Meaning that the name ""Jugo"" perhaps brings up bad memories of his uncle possibly abusing him.   Also, it's hinted at that Haschwalth doesn't really have any friends, hence why he didn't know that Bazz-B was a prodigy compared to other kids. This is probably a result of his uncle either abusing him or keeping him away from other kids, hence his timid personality. And that's why Bazz-B suddenly decided to become friends with him... so Haschwalth could atleast have one friend in the world.  In conclusion Haschwalth had a sad... sad childhood :/"

bleach,3ditro,queenie504,4,Thu Jul 16 18:28:02 2015 UTC,I'm most likely going to be contrary. I LOVE the Hitsugaya film for the sheer amount of Bankai that goes down during the final fight. Is the rest of the movie great? No. But that final fight to get to the tower/platform/thing and then the climb up it gets me each and every time.  I'm not a huge fan of the first one - but the Hellverse one is pretty great.   I don't remember the last one so I'm going to assume it left a grand total of NO impression on me.

bleach,3djhue,Rocksbury,3,Thu Jul 16 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"I have been wondering on this topic. When Ichigo traced his red spirit ribbon to find his shingami powers it led him to the quincy manifestation of his powers, OMZ. Any insights on this?"
bleach,3djhue,bobabb762,9,Fri Jul 17 00:11:17 2015 UTC,I think it's a sign that Kubo did not have the quincy thing planned at the beginning
bleach,3djhue,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Fri Jul 17 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Is that all people have to say? You don't get something, so Kubo "" didn't plan that far ahead "" or "" just a plot hole."" You realize the answer to your question is within the question? You think Ichigo's Zanpakuto spirit is going to show him when his Shinigami powers are locked away in the first place? The only thing there was Ichigo's Quincy powers. OMZ is the Quincy portion of Ichigo's soul. It was the strongest power within him, and therefore controlled everything. OMZ didn't want Ichigo to become a Shinigami, but didn't want Ichigo to die either. Therefore, he controlled Ichigo's power output, lending him only enough power and teaching him only what was necessary."
bleach,3djhue,dynrte,4,Fri Jul 17 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"What's being pointed out is that OMZ led him to his powers with a red spirit ribbon, which was stated by a quincy that only soul reapers have. That is enough to make a reasonable hypothesis that Kubo initially intended OMZ to actually be the zanpaktou spirit and not quincy powers"
bleach,3djhue,chaosattractor,5,Fri Jul 17 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's clear that Kubo planned the quincy powers pretty far in advance, but not as far back as the spirit ribbons. In other words, I agree with you."
bleach,3djhue,bobabb762,2,Fri Jul 17 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure I follow the logic here.  Basically you're saying that since Ichigo found the sword among the boxes with a red spirit ribbon, that means OMZ was supposed to be his zanpakutou spirit?  But yes, the sword he pulled out of the box was [a mangled suppressed form of] Zangetsu. It's not like he's been using Quincy powers. He's been using Shinigami powers, only suppressed and shown to him from the wrong source. For instance, he uses Getsuga Tenshou right after, and we know that's a Shinigami thing (Isshin has used it).  Besides, didn't Ichigo come up with the red ribbon idea on his own? All OMZ did really was tell him to pull out the sword after he'd already found it. How does that make him the zanpakutou spirit?  Especially since there were hints about the Quincy thing in the first half of the Soul Society arc, most notably his fight with Zaraki where OMZ says he can stop the flow of blood from his wounds (Blut Vene, which is most definitely not a Shinigami thing, plus since when did zanpakutou spirits just show up in the middle of a fight and stop their owner's wounds from bleeding?). Also OMZ says he's going to give him the power to win (paraphrased) and his reiatsu flare has his Hollow mask in it, which was really Zangetsu's power.   I find it weird that he'd have started planning for the Quincy thing then but not a few dozen chapters before when Ichigo first got the sword, like why would he pull a switcheroo like that?"
bleach,3djhue,HazelnutPi,2,Fri Jul 17 06:58:45 2015 UTC,I see your point I may be mistaken but I was under the impression that  until he got the dual blades what he was using was a quincy perversion of a zanpakuto. I get that getsuga is a shinigami technique but maybe he was channeling it through a unique quincy weapon? It would be kinda nifty if the quincy spirit used his shinigami reishi and amplified it by drawing in other environmental reishi.
bleach,3djhue,chaosattractor,2,Fri Jul 17 07:24:40 2015 UTC,"No, Uryuu Ishida introduced Ichigo to the idea of spirit ribbons, and told him that a Shibigami's spirit ribbons is red."
bleach,3djhue,HazelnutPi,2,Fri Jul 17 18:24:36 2015 UTC,"Well duh, the point is that it's not like OMZ told Ichigo ""Follow the red spirit thread and you'll find me"". Ichigo came up with that plan himself."

Byakuya shredded Renji's Bankai when they fought, but Renji doesn't just get a pile of scraps when he summons Bankai after that.   If damage like that isn't permanent, then I'm pretty sure Gin's Bankai can repair the missing portions of itself."
bleach,3dj5c2,Fearless-Fairness,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"The definition of broken, within the context of a Zanpakutou, isn't clear.   Agreed.  Maybe, perhaps, ""broken"" has to do with how close to death the shinigami is. In Renji, Ikkaku's and Mayuri's cases, they had all gotten #rekt and were close to death. I remember how Byakuya said that if a bankai disappears without the owner's consent, than the owner is close to death. Perhaps that comes into play."
bleach,3dj5c2,Aaroniero,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"I just thought whatever pieces of the bankai are destroyed stay broken, not the whole bankai itself. Renji's lost its spikes which lessened it's attack power but renji still had a bankai, ikkakus was fully destroyed and akon put it back together. Also I don't think the broken bankai theory works of the owner is the one to dismantle the bankai, the poison is gins own bankai power, not forced through opponents in battle so his sword being chipped wouldn't make sense since it's the swords actual ability. That's like saying byakuya could never use bankai because the sword fragments into tiny blades and it'll stay like that"
bleach,3dj5c2,Keranu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:55:47 2015 UTC,"I believe they said ""fully repaired"" and I thought they actually pointed out that Renji would never be able to reach his potential because Byakuya broke his Bankai.  My understanding is that Bankai's are basically just like people - once damaged they never really ""fully"" recover unless that damage is very minimal.  Like breaking a leg, you might run again, but you'll probably never be what you could have been without breaking it.    Of course, with people in real life, I'm painting with overbroad strokes.  but I think it more or less holds true (at least for people older than like 30)"

bleach,3dg22f,TIHNK,2,Sat Jul 18 07:32:32 2015 UTC,"Just some tips: I feel like the range of colors in this image is a bit low, and the backgrounds are a bit lacking. Maybe add some blue to complement all the yellow."
bleach,3dg22f,MetaAmbience,3,Thu Jul 16 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"This is pretty good if you've done this the first time. I've few tips for you which will make colored page more awesome.     Use different tones for base coloring and for shading. Lighter tones color often look whitish especially for color blind person. You can read this coloring choice tutorial which helped me in the past. Cleaning, removing blacks helps alot, remove them before you even try to color. Use pen tool + wand tool with contract 1 pixel. Using the wand tool with contract 1 pixel will allow it to leave 1 pixel outlines from outer selection. If you're removing the background, then coloring over I'd recommend locking the transparency then do a brush over the page with black color which will color the little pixels left with the outline. If you're using ""Multiply"" or any similar mode to color the page, you should try going with transparency mode (removing white, making it transparent) because in this way, you can accomplish alot of things including coloring over outlines. If you still like it, just keep using it. Since Wahrwelt is an ice castle, I'd recommend coloring it blue with white shade just to make it look like an icey castle. Sky needs to be sky blue with a different variation of mid tone blue, use it with gradient, it'll help alot. Then simply get a cloud brush to add clouds to your background which makes the job easier.   If you have any other questions, you can contact me through PMing me with your Skype, we can talk there."

We know that destroying too many Hollows puts ""the balance"" in jeopardy.  When that happens, the boundaries between worlds strat to become unstable.  Pretty much the same effect as killing the SK.  The worlds destabilize.  We're told by Yhwach (whose reliability as a source is suspect, but it's all we have) that SS (or those whose allegiance we now associate with SS) ""created"" the SK, ""to bring order to the chaos"".  If we assume this ""order"" is separation of the worlds, and this is somehow maintained by keeping the (average) number of souls in each world static/equal - and that the SK's purpose is to enable this ""balance"" in some way...then ""purifying"" a Hollow would necessarily put just as much strain on the system as destroying it.

bleach,3dcr9t,kasim42784,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:58:20 2015 UTC,"We don't know that Yhwach is the soul king.  People are assuming this because he's taken the powers of the soul king, but that doesn't necessarily mean he is entitled to the throne.  It very well could be, but it could also not be, and Yhwach's official position in the soul society plays  a large part in how things are going to play out, I think,"
bleach,3dcr9t,unitedpath,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"One thing about Ichigo is that based on how Orihime, Chad got the powers while being around him and it seems ichigo too have ""giver"" powers. like ywach and jugo. along with his own shinigami powers.  Considering previous Soul king seems to be rebel that ywach wants to take down. It seems to me that ichigo won't be able to take down ywach that easily. It seems his quincy power will protect him against ywach but also stop from going full on him."
bleach,3dcr9t,skyfire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yhwach's bluster about Ichigo's Quincy blood being the reason he was controlled is just another attempt to demoralize Ichigo, I think.  The effect on Ichigo appears to be the same Blut Vene Anhaben attack Yhwach used earlier (unsuccessfully) against Ichibei.  Ichigo, however, was caught off-guard by the attack coming from the sword, rather than from Yhwach directly.  It's possible he also didn't have a counter for it, as Ichibei did.  If this is the case, then Yhwach's essentially lying to Ichigo to attempt to break his will. It's a good tactic, since Ichigo's power is based almost completely on his will to fight/protect.  Fighting him head-on just makes him more determined.  Breaking him psychologically, on the other hand, leaves him vulnerable."

bleach,3dakci,seratheanos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"Someone who has no concept of Bleach?  With such a long-running series, you basically need to stick with early stuff, since otherwise you risk spoiling some of the twists.  I think my overall pick would be to show them the anime version of the fight between Ichigo and Renji in the SS arc.  It's early enough that there's no big plot points to give away, but badass enough to impress.  The fight with Zaraki would be better for a more technically-minded person, because it deals more with the mechanics of the combat than anything else. It introduces the concept of reiatsu (and reiatsu control) being important to baseline combat, along with the relationship between Shinigami and Zanpakuto.  There's a lot to this fight that doesn't really become clear until much later, but the fight itself is a pretty good intro to some of the more important mechanics, IMHO."

Movies 2 (DiamondDust Rebellion) and 3 (Fade to Black) can be watched during or after the Hueco Mundo arc. Movie 2 was decent and worth a watch, there's some good action scenes toward the end. I'd skip movie 3, it's probably the worst of the four.  Movie 4 (Hell Verse) can be watched during or after the Fake Karakura arc. It had a pretty well-done soundtrack and we find out a lot about hell. Definitely worth the watch."

I can't remember what that scene is for the first movie (though, really, you can just watch that one whenever).  For Diamonddust Rebellion, it's a scene where some of Hitsugaya's backstory is revealed (you find out how he met Matsumoto and decided to become a shinigami).  For Memories of Nobody... actually, I can't remember that one, either. >_>  For Hell Verse, it's a scene where Szayelapporo and...

The 3rd movie watch at the end of hueco mundo arc and the 4th movie watch after episode 299 because it is prelude to hell verse.
bleach,3d8rh9,petrichorE6,14,Tue Jul 14 11:40:26 2015 UTC,"This is my honest feelings for this arc. The first invasion was amazing! The second was just good, not bad or not amazing. Just good, I didn't have any trouble with Ichigo going up & down. And then setting up the gate started, this plot point really was annoying. The gate is up, next chapter, it's destroyed and up again, and destroyed. But during the time, it had pretty good chapters but setting the gate chapters was bad. Now ever since we entered Wahrwelt, it's picking up again. I'm really enjoying the chapters"
bleach,3d8rh9,Shunsui_for_CC,15,Tue Jul 14 12:08:35 2015 UTC,"As an overall arc... the final arc is my favourite out of all of them due to its slightly darker aspect with the quincy's being revealed as an enemy... which makes sense. Personally, part 1 of this arc is the best stuff I've seen in Bleach. Epic fights, revelations, and you would really know that the Quincy's weren't enemies that you could mess about with. Then comes part 2... I'm not going to deny that the quality has dipped a lot since part 1, but still I really don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be. There have been lots of dragged out, wasted moments (As well as OFF-PANELING SQUAD ZERO which was the worst mistake of this arc imo). However, it has had its good moments and is beginning to get a bit more interesting with the final battle. In conclusion the second part of this arc, whilst not being as good as the first, is not terrible, but not great... and still an enjoyable read. Also this arc becomes a lot more enjoyable to read if you marathon it or read it in large chunks... rather than read it weekly."
bleach,3d8rh9,S0ulMadness,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"I really do hope that they are saved for later... I'm sure I'm not the only that's been disappointed with them though (Except Oetsu and Ichibei). Ever since TBTP when it was first revealed there was a squad ABOVE the Gotei and captains I was so excited. But when chapter 611 came, my respect for (most of) them died down... :/"
bleach,3d8rh9,S0ulMadness,2,Tue Jul 14 14:06:41 2015 UTC,The royal guard being off paneled is meant to be one of those things authors do to build suspense. I think a lot more highly of the Stern now then before Zero went down. They are beyond Yama strength at this point. We heard all the captains could not beat a Royal Guard member and now we have the guys who beat them fighting our favorite characters. Kubo might not have anticipated the love of the Zero but even if he did allow them more time they still have to lose and revealing powers before fighting our Ichigo boosted captains wouldn't do any good.
bleach,3d8rh9,Rocksbury,4,Tue Jul 14 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"I think the overall plot is good, with the Quincy now being the bad guys. There've been a lot of interesting surprises. I think the story suffered from having too many bad guys, and us not knowing anything about Yhwach for a long time.  I personally liked the stuff with Ichigo going back and forth, being played around with like a puppet. In hindsight, Ukitake's sacrifice felt out of nowhere, but at the same time I appreciate that it was worthless, because usually the villian is supposed to lose at some point, right? I like that Kubo has effectively gotten rid of like....half the Captains. Remember how OP they were during the Arrancar arc?   I'm still mad about Unohana, though."
bleach,3d8rh9,Aaroniero,6,Wed Jul 15 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"Great so far. Some plotlines felt rushed, like Ukitake's sacrifice, but we are getting some great backstory like Bazz and Haschwalth's."
bleach,3d8rh9,Sirocco_,4,Tue Jul 14 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"As a whole I've really enjoyed it. It's given us some of the series' most epic moments (Yamamoto's last stand, Komamura's true bankai, Yhwach vs Ichibei, etc.) and revealed answers to questions have been poised for years, such as Isshin's past.  There have occasionally been some pacing issues, like the Gotei 13 taking six months to get to the Soul Palace, but that's nothing new when it comes to Bleach. I want to reserve a final judgment on the arc until it's actually over, but it has the potential to be the best one we've seen since the Soul Society arc."
bleach,3d8rh9,renlytargaryen,5,Tue Jul 14 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"Binge reading or reading by the volume is better than the weekly release of bleach IMO. But I agree, this arc has had huge ups and downs."
bleach,3d8rh9,StarkTheWolf,4,Tue Jul 14 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"Enjoying it a lot myself. Also further cements the fact that Bleach is 10x better when binge read. Kubo's pacing is a direct result of the magnitude of the universe and characters, it pisses me off when people complain about Character X being forgotten by Kubo if they miss a chapter or two.  That's just my two cents."
bleach,3d8rh9,Hellicus,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"I know I'm speaking against the crowd here but...  I stopped reading partway into the 'Fullbring' arc because that one was god awful, then was bored today and decided I had nothing better to do than see if he managed to bring it back up to par.  Nope, it's so god awful I had to check this sub to see if anyone actually liked this stuff. Literally the only decent part was Bazz's backstory. Everything else was a jumbled mess of plot points (in king palace, back down, back up, back down, back up; pointless sacrifice, etc), lazy writing (multiple quincies all have the same mind/body control powers? Come on.), and fan service (Grimmjaw and Nel's senseless return).  I honestly don't know what people see in this manga any more. It should have ended with the arrancar arc. It's just managed to raise stupid questions by continuing instead of answering things people actually wondered about after the end of that arc."
bleach,3d8rh9,Rawrmander,7,Tue Jul 14 13:15:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm ready for it to be over. I don't really care about any of the new characters in the new arc.

bleach,3d8rh9,oetsuthebest,4,Tue Jul 14 11:48:06 2015 UTC,I think it started of really great. But went downhill.  Especially after all the completely bullshit power ups were shoved in our faces.

bleach,3d8rh9,FredWeedMax,4,Tue Jul 14 16:44:11 2015 UTC,I think it's the best arc so far and the only thing pulling Bleach down is lack of an anime. Even then it's not really being pulled down but instead it's having a constant rate of sales as any series without an anime. Bleach is actually doing very well for not having an anime for 3 years to boost sales.  You can't really say things are in vain (such as Ukitake's death) considering the story isn't even over yet. Give it time.
bleach,3d8rh9,Alluka-,2,Tue Jul 14 11:48:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of important things feel rushed, but then boring shit like invader back story gets dragged out. Or zombies. Gonna need some wrap up on that at some point. I just... the whole second invasion feels like Kubo's dropping acid and just rolling with it. I still really enjoy it, but damn it's crazy.   This may have something to do with me reading from start to present in 2 days though. I haven't had to wait a week+ at a time for this current arc to be where it is now."

bleach,3d8rh9,HazelnutPi,2,Tue Jul 14 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"Last week, for the first time since I started reading Bleach 4 or 5 years ago, I considered skipping a chapter... It felt really weird. I don't remember the names of these new characters, I don't remember their powers, I don't care if they live or die.   I'm super ready for this manga to be over because I'm finding it not only tedious to follow the story and dialogue, but I feel like the artwork has become crowded and strange as well. I used to love looking at simple two page spreads of a huge explosion during the final battle with Aizen. I loved the cool powerups of Ichigo and the character design, but I feel like that's all gone.   Maybe it's my fault for not re-reading chapters or something but I really have no interest in the manga anymore except wanting to see how it ends. Such a bummer."

It's ok, but I would rather watch the ones before the Fullbring."
bleach,3d8rh9,blaziken24,0,Tue Jul 14 13:15:49 2015 UTC,"right went ichigo gets back from the palace is when the arc goes downhill for me, you can tell almost instantly that after that happened the plot became rushed, jumbled, and just flat out confusing. Ichibe was great, but the rest till this point seems horribly rushed. How do you go from Ritter fights that take up 6-7 chaps, when yhwach killed and ate the soul king in less than 4."
bleach,3d8rh9,Keranu,0,Tue Jul 14 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"The is by far the best arc of bleach. Anyone stating otherwise is basing it off ignorance. Sure Stan Lee likes the Spider-man origin story but the climax, the test before the end where everything the hero had learnt is put to the test. That is every Authors and Readers favorite part.  Arcs in Manga might have their own set of build ups but the entire series is in its climax right now. Read this arc from the start and it makes sense, we lack the motivations for the villains attacks but we have established lore giving us clues to the Shinigami involvement in Yhwachs reasons to eliminate the Soul King and thats from very early in the series.  I don't know what people want. If you like bleach this is what bleach is all about. This is the pinnacle of what it can be and thinking about the Berserk style kill off thats coming is getting me super excited.This arc is so much more Mature then the previous ones, the follow up from Fullbring is fantastic but hey I don't know apparently a large number of Bleach fans think that we need no deaths, long drawn out fights involving descriptions of every move, an enemy with no motivations other than I want to be stronger because im already stronger than most of you.    Yama Kenpachi Grimmjow TBTP Royal Guard Aizen Bankai galore Komamura  anti beast mode Zombies Soul King   I mean I stopped when I couldnt think of more off the top of my head. The Invasion arc was great but really I dont think seeing a captain fight another Captain or Vice Captain (With no actual motivation to kill) is more interesting then a fight for survival."

His power level was captain level during SS arc, Utikutake even mentions it he says ""what is this spiritual pressure its that of a captain but I dont recognize  it"""
bleach,3d7891,Deserak,8,Tue Jul 14 07:02:09 2015 UTC,"Please forgive the epic post below, this is one of my favorite things about Bleach and it bugs me sometimes that people treat it like Dragonball Z with power levels...    Aside from a few key moments (And natural growth during time-skip), Ichigo has pretty much been overpowered from day one, he just hasn't known how to USE any of that power.  Ichigo had enough raw power to outclass most Shinigami from Day 1, as hinted by him breaking Rukia's kido when they first met while still in human form and before gaining her soul reaper power; his abilities hadn't taken shape at that point but the raw strength was there. That got hintest again with the Menos Grande' that he blocked and deflected (remember that at that point, he didn't know how to consciously use his power at all, but he still SCARED OFF a hollow so powerful it takes captain class shinigami to fight). Ichigo spends the first arc just overpowering everything he fights without even really trying, and the few times he does make real effort the enemies get scared and run. When he faces Renji is the first time I think he actually taps his full power, and using it in an extremely ineffective way he still dominates until Byuakia's speed & surprise attack shocks him out of his trance.  So going into Soul Society, he has the same spirit power as always. Only Urahara has taught him some basic swordplay (so he now knows how to actually fight, rather than just knowing some hand to hand and going by instinct). He's learned how to concentrate his power to use it more effectively (think of Urahara's comment about how before he learned Zangetsu's name, the sword was big but had no density), and he also gets taught how important resolve is (""When you block, you don't let them cut you. When you protect someone, you don't let them die. When you attack, you kill"").  When Ichigo first gets into SS and goes up against Ikkaku, it's the first time he's ever really faced someone on equal footing. Ichigo is stronger in raw power terms, but still inexperienced, and Ikkaku is extremely skilled. Against Renji, Ichigo tried several approaches with little success, until he remembered what Urahara had taught him about how to use his special move, which caught Renji completely off guard and overpowered him. Against Zaraki, Ichigo was initially terrified of the raw power Zaraki could throw around, because he'd never faced someone that strong before. His fear blunted his sword, literally. It was only after he got it together that he was even able to touch Zaraki, and even then it only took his focus slipping for an instant for Zaraki to pierce Zangetsu and stab Ichigo in the heart. OMZ helps Ichigo back to his feet and back into the fight, gives him a pep talk, and Ichigo is able to continue the fight long enough to draw with Zaraki.  Then Ichigo goes through Bankai training. Most people seem to think that gaining Bankai = instant power boost. It's actually implied though that Ichigo just becomes a better fighter during the training (Yourichi comments that he's learned to switch from defense to offence fluidly without losing momentum), which then allows him to defeat OMZ and gain the Bankai technique.  Then the fight with Byakuya. Byakuya isn't ""stronger"" than Zaraki, but he's a MUCH better fighter. Byakuya is, in my opinion, the most pragmatic and skilled captain in the gotei. Where Zaraki wants a good, enjoyable fight, Byakuya just wants to defeat his opponent as quickly and effectively as possible. (Kubo actually makes a point later in the series that if the two fought head to head, it'd be roughly a draw even though Zaraki's power completely dwarfs Byakuya). Even so, when Ichigo first uses his Bankai, he's so fast that he completely dominates Byakuya (deflecting all bazillian petal blades, literally running circles around Byakuya etc.). It's Ichigo's own inexperience that gets him again - because he doesn't understand his Bankai very well, he winds up shattering his own bones and injuring himself by using it wrong. That weakens him to the point where his Bankai is essentially meaningless because he's back to the speed and strength he has in Shikai. Hichigo, being relentlessly offensive and not having ANY of the restraints that Ichigo has, takes over and goes all out. That gives him enough edge to turn the tide again - again, not because of any difference in strength but because of a difference in fighting style and knowledge of technique (Highigo blasts Byakuya with constant black getsuga's, which Ichigo hadn't tried). After Ichigo regains control the pair decide they both have enough in them for one last attack each, and all out final attacks happen to be Ichigo's specialty. So he wins."
bleach,3d7891,ABashfulTurnip,3,Tue Jul 14 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like to think that this explains a lot about why Ichigo is able to get all these power ups but still seem barely weaker than enemies he has already beaten. He has the talent to be better than them but in a similar way to Zaraki he ends up limiting himself (though for different reasons and in different ways) OMZ has been limiting his power constantly but after SS Ichigo himself is restraining his own power, he doesn't like Hichigo and so limits himself in all his fights from then on (even after gaining his mask hence he doesn't become a god almost instantly and still gets his ass kicked by pretty much everyone in Heuco Mundo).  Not to mention the fact that he learns from his fight with byakuya he can't / shouldn't go all out against any one enemy, this is why Aizen was able to block his sword since Ichigo had no Reiatsu left to keep his sword sharp enough to cut him.  Thats really the one thing that he gets from unlocking the Final Getsuga Tensho the ability to actually control both his hollow and shinigami side, which with his naturally ridiculously large power base allows him to seem so much stronger than Aizen was."
bleach,3d7891,Deserak,2,Tue Jul 14 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"Also explains why his first couple of Getsuga Tenshous (before he knows what the move is) are utterly devastating and leave massive canyons cut into the earth - yet after SS when he learns to fire them at will, they're basically just an average long range attack. Because early on he only manages to release them when he's not holding back at all (so we see his true power) while later in the series it's just another move he's pulling off.  It's made fairly clear that this is what's happening if you're paying attention to character (Which I do, because writer). His fear and self-doubts cripple his resolve, and resolve is the key to tapping his full power. Even the recent revelations about his power fit in terms of Ichigo proving himself to himself (I won't go into it here though, because spoilers and I can't remember how to do spoiler tags in posts). Unfortunately, people seem to think that Shonen = DBZ, and treat all these strokes of subtly brilliant story-craft as bad writing, because 'power levels don't line up'.   P.S. I was going to add that the limits Zaraki has are different to Ichigos, but realised during typing that it's fear in both cases: Ichigo for various reasons, Zaraki because he's utterly terrified of never being able to find his equal in battle - but because it's the ONLY thing he fears, Zaraki himself doesn't understand it so it's subtle."
bleach,3d7891,chilaxgamer15,4,Tue Jul 14 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, Ichigo literally gets stronger and weaker between episodes due to his Hollow powers. But to answer your question I believe that Ichigo in the Soul Society Arc had barely any Hollow power being released to cripple him, therefore he had more access to his shinigami powers. I personally think that Ichigo when he initially released his bankai he was at least as strong as when he beat Grimmjow. However when he used his bankai his hollow was able finally come out (as evidence by Hichigo) then afterwards throughout the entirety of the Vizard Arc (before he trains with the Vizard) he is constantly getting weaker by his Hollow power. Then when he masters summoning his mask he is slowly getting stronger and stronger (due to his Quincy flash memory) every time he fought an arrancar, his hollow powers would get released more and he would get access to more of Zangetsu's power. This is why Ichigo  (in a very short amount of time) went from getting stomped by unreleased Grimmjow to being able to beat a released Grimmjow. Also on a bit of a side note, I think when Ichigo got killed by Ulqiourra BEFORE his final fight with Grimmjow, was when he got the biggest boost in hollow powers."
bleach,3d7891,Purona,2,Tue Jul 14 03:02:13 2015 UTC,Except his shinigami powers are his hollow powers they are the same thing
bleach,3d7891,chilaxgamer15,0,Tue Jul 14 08:50:26 2015 UTC,They aren't the same thing they are just connected by his quincy powers. due to Urahara.

bleach,3d7891,Purona,4,Tue Jul 14 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way.  When Ichigo first gained his Shinigami powers he instantly broke out of a completel 99s bakudo, we are talking 4  levels of the bakudo (kin, 1st song 2nd song and great bankin).  Do you know who couldn't do that? Hollowed Kensei in turn back the pendelum and that was a messed up version of Kin. Take this as a hint of Ichigo's total strength when he first gained his power he was WELL beyond a standard captain  Secondly He didnt beat Kenpachi at the strength he was when he fought Ikkaku and Renji. Ie. When he was at the strength of Ikkaku and renji, Kenpachi stood still and gently, slowly and calmly pushed his sword through Ichigos sword and through ichigos chest with NO EFFORT. Thats the difference between Renji and patched Kenpachi  Also Ichigo needed both his power unleashed and a hollow mask to dampen the blow in order to NOT die against Kenpachi both were temporary measures and mean nothing in the Byakuya fight"
bleach,3d7891,MrGommyBoy,3,Tue Jul 14 09:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say Ichigo, at that time was about 2.5 strongs"
bleach,3d7891,yukeake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:27 2015 UTC,"In typical shounen fashion, Ichigo's power levels fluctuate wildly in the SS arc based primarily on his willpower.  When he's just fighting, he's relatively strong.  When he has self-doubt, or he's caught off-guard, he's relatively weak.  When he's determined, he's nigh-unstoppable.  Remember too, that in the SS arc, Ichigo believes that OMZ is ""Zangetsu"", and that Zangetsu/Hichigo is simply his inner Hollow.  Until he gains Bankai, OMZ is controlling his access to Zangetsu's power, and Zangetsu/Hichigo is relatively complicit.  After Bankai, Zangetsu/Hichigo gains ascendency, and starts being antagonistic towards Ichigo's use of his power.  OMZ complicates the situation by continuing to suppress the ""Shinigami"" side of Zangetsu (which in turn allows its Hollow side to run rampant), in an attempt to scare Ichigo away from his powers.  The fight against Zaraki is probably the most important fight in the arc, for a few reasons.  First, it's the first time that Ichigo willingly fights alongside his spirit(s), rather than just blindly pushing forward.  Second, it appears to be the time when he began to ""impress"" OMZ - planting the seeds that would eventually bloom much later, during the forging, where OMZ ""accepts"" Ichigo's will, and agrees to stop suppressing his powers.  The third point is a little less clear.  Ichigo associates Zaraki with his desire to fight, and his desire to win.  During the Vizard training, Ichigo's confronted by something that isn't Hichigo.  It takes Zaraki's form and voice, and talks about the will to fight, and ot enjoy the act of the fight.  I think this is intended to represent Zangetsu's suppressed side calling out to Ichigo - but it's entirely possible, being within Ichigo's soulscape, that it's just meant to be him confronting his own desire to fight.  Either way, it calls back to Ichigo's fight against Zaraki, and its importance to him."
bleach,3d7891,ChaosKeeshond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:59:39 2015 UTC,"There are no such thing as power levels. The size of your Reiatsu might dictate your capacity for brute force, but Bleach has, imho, always been very balanced and logical in the way fights are executed.  For example, some Shinigami rely on their immense Reiatsu alone to win fights. However, Yumichika's Zan completely drains spiritual energy, and he'd probably win that matchup."
bleach,3d7891,a310gintoki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that ichigo (more or less) gets stronger in every fight he struggles in. You can't say how strong he was during the ss arc, because his power was on a constant rise the entire arc. By the end he was able to stand toe to toe with byakuya, being (in a way) noted as one of the strongest people byakuya had yet to fight; however, in the beginning of the arc he was stated (by urahara) to be on level with a third seat.  Also, kenpachi also got stronger through his fight with ichigo, so gauging his respective power to the other captains DURING their fight is difficult. He could've been one of the weakest for all we know."

Gin knew frontal attack on Aizen wouldn't work and it was in his personality that he backstabs. He resembles snake, snake does sneaky stuff, so does Gin. He didn't had any emotion against Aizen except hate. He did all that stuff because of Rangiku. You sound as if he wanted join Aizen because he likes Aizen.   then there is gin , who was there for no reason . you can see he doesnt have admiration or fear or any kind of emotion for aizen , so why he was there ?"

bleach,3d8o0l,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Tue Jul 14 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"The reason for the Espada being with Aizen was because he was way stronger than them. They couldn't have any sort of revolt against him. Aizen really showed he could be the one to change the way the world works. You are talking about what the Espada individually represent. Gin was there because he wanted revenge for Rangiku about Aizen taking a piece of her soul. He doesn't show any emotion because of his nature, he's very good at hiding it to have been with Aizen that long and managing to get information about his Zanpakuto from him. He was sad about leaving Rangiku because he knew the actions he would have to do in order to get what he wanted would be bad, but they were necessary. Being with Aizen for so long, he understood what he had to do with Aizen to take him down, tying in with the fact of his personality that is a snake. His best chance of stopping Aizen was to be in his group, and then when he least expected it, to strike only when he was positive Aizen couldn't do anything to stop it. Just unlucky for Gin all of that had to happen after the Hogyoku. I mean, you saw what everyone tried to do, and Gin was the only one who actually managed to succeed. The difference was the Hogyoku. In answering your question, we didn't know really anything about Gin's motives. We just thought he was one of the henchmen. The moment from him being sad about leaving Rangiku, you could have predicted that will lead to something, maybe expecting it leads to Gin wanting to kill Aizen. I didn't really see it coming."
bleach,3d8o0l,Sirocco_,3,Wed Jul 15 02:27:56 2015 UTC,"Right, so, since you have clarified your question I will answer that.  I for one, didn't. His betrayal of SS was quite sensible because he really made himself out to be unlikeable, what with the sadistic attitude towards Rukia. However, his betrayal of Aizen came as quite a surprise. When he reported back to Aizen saying he killed Matsumoto, I didn't believe it because everyone knows he has a soft spot for her. It was then that I had doubts on his ulterior motives. But the flash backs didn't occur until the moment when he betrayed Aizen, so it was then that his motives were made known."
bleach,3d8o0l,whatacrappyusername,2,Tue Jul 14 15:45:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry if it wasnt clear man , many times i think i write it clear but dont :(  As for gin , the point that made me suspect are the lack of motivations he had to be with aizen and the sadness he proved leaving rangiku . I wouldnt leave a person dear to me if there isnt something more important to do (revenge in this case) . Then at one point ichigo even tells him after the fight that he cant see any emotion in him , not a motivation at all ."
bleach,3d8o0l,tchales7,3,Tue Jul 14 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"At first I thought he was just a twisted henchman back in the Soul-Society arc. He seemed more evil than Aizen, somehow. When FKT came around I was baffled. He fought Shinji a little bit (not seriously), and he bifurcated Hyori, but other than that he just kinda stood around. Usually the subordinates fight and then the bosses fight, but here was Aizen kicking everyone's butt while Gin just watched.   So that kinda got me thinking. After he finished his fight with Ichigo I had the suspicion that he was going to turn on Aizen. He delayed Aizen's plans in KT, which kinda solidified it. I wasn't 100% certain what he was doing, but I wasn't shocked he ultimately turned on Aizen."

The little pieces came together in fkt , where he didnt do nothing useful to his ""boss"" and was just playing around . Then , if u put the pieces of the puzzle together , you can more or less predict what is going to happen"
bleach,3d8o0l,Jedy_hacker,2,Tue Jul 14 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"I always thought Gin was hanging around with Aizen simply because Gin was a nasty dude. Pretty much since his introduction he was one thing to me - evil. So no, I didn't see the betrayal coming. I believed Gin just wanted to wreck some shit and kill people, maybe with the opportunity for a bit of sass. His arrangement with Aizen seemed to satisfy that pretty well."

bleach,3d5qq1,rickEbobby,13,Mon Jul 13 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Ichibei is stronger. It's hard to really quantify the Captain's power levels. You can really only do it in broad terms: you have the ""strong"" captains, the ""weaker"" captains, the ""mid-tier"" Captains.   I believe the Royal Guard is in a tier above all of the Captains, with the exception of, perhaps, Yamamoto. He's probably in the same tier as the Royal Guard.   But Ichibei is the strongest, hands down."
bleach,3d5qq1,Aaroniero,3,Mon Jul 13 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"It's strange because Ichibe'e's fight with Yhwach kinda made him look weak. I mean, he did a lot of amazing attacks that would otherwise instantly obliterate someone, but Yhwach shrugged all of his attacks off which I would think would make people think he's weak.  The only reason that I agree that Ichibe'e is something else entirely compared to Yamamoto (rather than being around the same level) is the fact that Yhwach couldn't feel his Reiatsu. As we know, even if he were suppressing his Reiatsu, Yhwach would've been able to feel it a little bit, but if he couldn't feel it at all, that means he's transcendent.  I'm sure he could start feeling his Reiatsu when he used The Almighty though, otherwise it's a bit strange that he was able to instantly overpower Ichibe'e when previously he had to rely on unseen Quincy abilities."
bleach,3d5qq1,Andygoesrawr,2,Tue Jul 14 00:32:24 2015 UTC,"http://mangafox.me/manga/bleach/v67/c608/5.html  It says that he couldn't sense any reiatsu from the brush, not from Ichibei."

There's nothing saying if he's talking about the Zanpakutou or Ichibe'e himself, but we know that when a Zanpakutou is released or being utilised it releases some of its own Reiatsu, so it doesn't really matter which one he's talking about because it's an extraordinary case either way."
bleach,3d5qq1,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"I think this is a classic case of just how Bleach works, a lot of times i see a fight posted here or on /r/whowouldwin its not always about power.  i do think Yamas Reiatsu > Ichibe, but Ichibe has much better abilities. it comes down to HAX vs Power. and outside of Aizen/Yhwach Ichibe has probably has the most OP abilities in Bleach. so if Yama and Ichibe fought i think Ichibe would win a majority.  Also a question. on a lot of fight threads Yamas statement of his Bankai burning as hot as the sun or burning things from existence is brought up. are these literal translations or are they supposed to be taken metaphorically ?"
bleach,3d5qq1,Jiscold,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:51:32 2015 UTC,"Your comment made me realize that Yamamoto wouldn't stand a chance against Yhwach. He would steal his bankai and rip him to pieces. To answer to op, in an all out fight Ichibei is clearly the winner. If Yhwach fought against Ichibei the day he killed yamamoto it would be the end of the ark probably."
bleach,3d5qq1,Gressil_Abaddon,5,Wed Jul 15 13:51:10 2015 UTC,Do people actually debate this? Ichibei is the head of the Shinigami and the Royal Guard. Yamamoto was only the head of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads. Plus Ichibei could just erase Zanka no Tachi's name and render it useless.  Besides I feel like Yhwach's words saying Yama got weak or rusty due to peace might actually hold some weight.

bleach,3d5qq1,oetsuthebest,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"The sayabuse is certanly a great sword , but even deadly as it is , it remains a sword . The good points of shikai and bankai is that they give other magic powers wich are better than only a deadly sword .

bleach,3d5qq1,oetsuthebest,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:14 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. I just figured he was already pretty deadly regardless if he had a zan or not....I think it'd be cool if he didn't have a zan simply because it could hypothetically show that a shinigami's strength shouldn't necessarily be judged by a shikai/bankai, but also by their raw swordsmanship and hand to hand combat skills (something he is obviously very skilled in)"

He had his honorable moments, like when he spared Harribel's Fraccion due to their bravery, and the rest of the Gotei 13 clearly looked up to him, but I don't think he was ever meant to be some kind, grandfatherly figure."

At some point Yama was fighting with nothing more than Kido (If that was even around) and a sword. Throw in the fact that we know the King dislikes Shinigami by the Chi attack so you had guys with regular swords fighting gods. Once overthrown the souls of the Shinigami warriors unworthy of Captain status had been forged into Zanpakutos along with the remaining Quincy in the spirit world.

bleach,3d2pco,renlytargaryen,2,Mon Jul 13 16:05:23 2015 UTC,You have to remember that he may still not have been at full strength after being in a gigai for as long as he was. He also cut down Grand Fisher without releasing his zan.   I personally think he is one of the top captains of the SS. Also remember that his goofiness really is just an act. He is a master swordsman and his ability to conjure a spell without an incantation means he must have mastered kido as well and his spiritual pressure had an affect on Ichigo.   He studies his opponents when fighting and can counter attack easily.

I figured the Y and H at the beginning corresponded with the ""Juha"" (or Yuuha) part of the Japanese pronunciation, and that the ""-wach"" part was pronounced with the ""w"" as a ""v"" and the ""ch"" as a ""k"".   I knew that the popular ""Ya-watch"" was just a horrible corruption...but now I feel smarter than 95% of this subreddit lol.  I have my win for the week."
bleach,3d264s,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you pronounce that last part, but I googled it to see what everyone else was saying.   With the latest chapter, it came to my mind that Kubo most likely derived his name from the hebrew name of the Jewish (and Christian) god YHWH, which is commonly pronouned as Jehowah/Jehovah in German. Japanese uses ""B"" for ""V"" as in vitamin. therefore, can surmise that Yhwach's katakana JuHaBaHa is suppose to pronounce as Jehovah.    Found here. http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:72890  There were other posts, but according to how the Quincy were treating this guy, I prefer that one. I guess we'll have to wait to see how the Japanese guys say it, vs the English VAs saying it. I like how my Hispanic friends say it though, Yahweh. Even in German, the ""ch"" at the end of words is usually  like honking a loogie, a really hard ""hhh"" sound, like when people make fun of how Jewish people speak, like in that Rugrats Jewish episode. I'm gonna assume it's the case for pronouncing their version of the Christian god's name name. So Yhwach to me would be ""Yhaa wihh"""
bleach,3d264s,jajajonjon,3,Mon Jul 13 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"That's wrong. The English spelling might come from YHWH, but the Japanese name is yuuhabahha. There's no conceivable way that Jehovah could be spelled yuuhabahha in Japanese. The yuuha is straight forward, it's the same sound as the Finnish version of the name Johan, Juha. Bahha is either Bach or Wach, since the ba- sound is used for both ba and va sounds in English, and -ahha denotes a German word ending in ""ach"" (-ihhi is used for words ending in ""ich"", etc). Hence why it was spelled Juhabach for a long time, because that's the direct Pseudo-German version of the Japanese spelling. The only difference between that and the true name (other than spelling), is the fact that the sound we though was ""b"" is actually ""v"". Jehovah would be spelled ehoba.  It's yuu-ha-vahk."
bleach,3d264s,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see how a Japanese VA pronounces it according to Kubo's guidelines, but really I'm gonna guess they're gonna say it how it's supposed to be pronounced in real life. The spelling might be Juhabaha in katakana but we've all seen words with extra consonants and vowels that we basically skip or take as cues to make different shapes with our tongues, so I really think they're gonna pronounce it like Jehova with a Japanese accent. Unless someone has audio from an interview of Kubo saying it himself ....  Care to make a wager?"
bleach,3d264s,geobarn,3,Mon Jul 13 06:12:36 2015 UTC,"Um... sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. A Japanese VA is going to pronounce it Yuuhabahha because that's his name. To the Japanese, the name ""Yhwach"" doesn't exist. It's Yuuhabahha, and nothing more.  They pronounce every name correctly (read: according to Kubo) because they're not mislead by the English spelling. E.g. BG9 -- probably 99% of English readers pronounce it ""bee djee nine"". It's actually beh geh noyn, and the Japanese will pronounce it properly because they write it as ベー・ゲー・ノイン (beh geh noin), not BG9.  Japanese is a phonetic language. If something is spelled a certain way, it's pronounced that way (with about 3 exceptions which only pertain to particles due to historical shifts in pronunciation). There's literally no reason whatsoever for a Japanese person to think his name would be Jehovah, and the only possible situation where they would pronounce it that way is if they're copying some English-speaking moron without having seen the name before."

If they were in the Gotei at the same time there would be almost no chance of her not recognizing not only a former captain, but also one that was a relative of Kaien.

When Isshin heard the there had been two more casualties from an existing case, he got a determined look in his eye  My guess is that Isshin was trying to go after a Hollow that specifically targets Shinigami because it may be linked to the events that contributed to Kaien's death. It was confirmed that White wasn't just attacking ""high sources of reiatsu"" on one of the follow-up pages.   This really makes me think that Isshin's gut instinct was the former belief from Page 16, and that he felt there to be a link between Metastacia and whatever unknown entity (at the time) was attacking people in Karakura town during EBTR."

bleach,3d2hd9,lowmodality,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"Togabito are clearly known to have unique powers, he's not been an ordinary human since his descent to Hell, any more than hollows that become Arrancar are reflective of the power level of the human souls they once were.   As for their powers, Togabito obviously develop their new abilities based on whatever powers they had before they went to Hell (Shrieker as a Togabito had augmented versions of his Hollow powers). So Kokuto was likely a powerful swordsman before he was sent to Hell.  The chains forged by the Kushanada are also indestructible, in order to keep them confined to Hell, which many Togabito also utilise to their advantage for protection."
bleach,3d2hd9,reigun91,2,Tue Jul 14 04:16:13 2015 UTC,He probably would have had ichigo get caught in hells chains or something.
bleach,3d2hd9,MrSterlock,2,Mon Jul 13 00:22:50 2015 UTC,Maybe he was confident that he could avoid Ichigo after he broke out (he probably could have).

Which means he would have been willing to fight the captains around the Gates of Hell to get to Ichigo.  But obviously due to the fact that it's a 90 minute movie, they had to condense the subplots and make it a streamlined narrative. I wish Hell Chapter was made into a proper filler arc, so the story and environment would actually be fleshed out and questions like yours above would not need to be asked, 5 years after the film was released."

bleach,3d11i9,Korrasch,4,Sun Jul 12 17:17:40 2015 UTC,"Also if you were looking for a serious reply, Yhwach is stronger. Zero squad would have killed Aizen if he hadn't become immortal, and Yhwach utterly destroyed them without a scratch. As much of an Aizen fanboy I am - he is my favorite character, after all - I can admit that Yhwach is stronger. But Aizen is more intelligent and has more tricks up his sleeve, so a fight between the two could go either way and I would love to watch it. But as far as just raw power, Yhwach has the edge."
bleach,3d11i9,Korrasch,2,Sun Jul 12 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"well actually.... Yhwach only defeated Ichibei, his subordinates defeated the others.  just to nitpick"
bleach,3d11i9,angelicable,4,Sun Jul 12 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"Knew someone was going to nitpick that lol. If he dispatched the strongest with such ease though, I'm sure he wouldn't have had a problem with the rest. Regardless, Aizen couldn't 1v1 Ichibei and Yhwach did, so that's enough of an indicator right there I suppose."
bleach,3d11i9,Korrasch,4,Sun Jul 12 19:07:44 2015 UTC,to nitpick again  we have no idea how strong the others are compared to Ichibei  Aizen is no slouch. He was said to be able to shoot down the soul king's palace in his chair with 40+ seals on him.  And it takes a week just by shunpo to travel between seireitei and royal palace. That's like hundreds of thousands of miles dude. He also destroyed the giant barrier
bleach,3d11i9,angelicable,5,Sun Jul 12 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not taking away from Aizen at all; he's absolutely monstrously powerful and my favorite character. But Ichibei is the pinnacle of Shinigami power, most likely created Kido, and knows the name and function of every zanpakuto. Kyouka Suigestu wouldn't work on him. He could rename the hogyoku and make it worthless, or even detrimental. No kido Aizen knows would work. It would basically become a shunpo + kenjutsu brawl, but Ichibei would still have kido to use and his renaming/power nullification abilities. There's really no scenario where Aizen comes out on top."
bleach,3d11i9,Korrasch,3,Sun Jul 12 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"Let me point out that we haven't even seen Aizen's bankai yet.  (Well atleast I don't think we have).  Also, Ichibei may be the pinnacle of shinigami power, but Aizen evolved further than that (with the help of the Hogyoku, according to him)."
bleach,3d11i9,MrSterlock,3,Sun Jul 12 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"Aizen may not even have a bankai, or Kyouka Suigetsu IS his bankai. He says his release command every single time. When a shinigami attains bankai, they no longer have to say the release command to activate their shikai. So it's quite possible that either he is using bankai every time or he hasn't attained it."
bleach,3d11i9,Korrasch,3,Sun Jul 12 22:11:48 2015 UTC,He almost definitely has a bankai IMO.  Just from context and what it would mean if he didn't have one.  I'm sure we will find out soon anyways.
bleach,3d11i9,MrSterlock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:16:51 2015 UTC,We also have no idea how much stronger he became while in Muken. I wouldn't guess he's stronger than Ywach but he apparently IS stronger than when he fought Ichigo.
bleach,3d11i9,jk1988,2,Mon Jul 13 02:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, so even though his ability isn't specifically ""Almighty"" he still has shit tons of power to cancel out the renaming shit. It's not like Ichibei IS god, he just has a powerful spell that has to seep through the person and overpower the enemy's defenses before it can take effect."
bleach,3d11i9,jajajonjon,2,Mon Jul 13 02:13:21 2015 UTC,You're making wildly inaccurate assertions Bro.   For one we don't know if Ichibei could have dispatched Aizen (we never saw any fight between them).   We have seen Ichibei's ink be infective against non shinigami based powers like Ywatch.   Well I'm pretty sure Aizen isn't just a shinigami anymore so we don't know how the ink would or would t affect him.   Sheer strength like when Ichigo grabbed Aizen might be a factor as well.   Aizen may have evolved to counter that and may just snap a neck or two or cut people like Ichibei in half.   All things we don't know so don't go around saying with any certainty how Ichibei or the royal. Gaurd would have done against Aizen. We don't know.   Especially this new Aizen.
bleach,3d11i9,rickdousey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's rather obvious that the strongest shinigami would be able to dispatch someone weaker. Ichibei is stronger than Yamamoto and Aizen didn't think he could solo Yamamoto. You really don't need much more than that, but I gave it anyway."
bleach,3d11i9,Korrasch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:38:57 2015 UTC,"well tbh, do we know that Ichibei can negate all zanpakutou ability? It never seemed like he could do such a thing tbh. I think just because he named all zanpakutou, doesn't mean he can negate them at will. So if Aizen could still get KS off before Ichibei is on guard, he could still win.  Furthermore, IIRC Ichibei requires either ink or natural blackness on his target to activate his ability, so idk. Don't mind me, im just trying to get to know Ichibei for /r/whowouldwin"

bleach,3d11i9,Tynarus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:06:59 2015 UTC,"Well electricity can travel faster than shunpo. Yes, people can dodge lightning attacks because they see where the dude is aiming and can sense when they're about to trigger it, like how Urahara was fighting Yammy and shit like that. So it makes sense Aizen would be able to hit the palace within seconds.  But yea I'm sure it would still take a lonnnnng fucking time for that thing to fall. Acceleration due to gravity has a maximum velocity, called terminal velocity.  So I can just imagine him shooting it down, and then it shows a timelapse sequence of the Shunsui playing chess or majong or something with Aizen, Renji and Ikkaku and whoever else survived that drinks are all drinking, Komamura is watching Beauty and the Beast and relating with The Beast, obviously. Everyone's basically chilling, meanwhile everyone above is screaming bloody murder as they're all falling tens of thousands of miles to the ground, achieving maximum possibly velocity within the first hour or so.

bleach,3d2vsl,shiba_keikaku,4,Mon Jul 13 02:19:37 2015 UTC,I think it will have something to do with Aizen's continued involvement and how they'll eventually beat Yhwach. A popular theory is that he'll lose control of The Almighty because he activated it too soon thanks to Aizen's trick.
bleach,3d2vsl,Xallog,3,Mon Jul 13 03:31:12 2015 UTC,I think the reason he was able to do that was because he fused with kyoka suigetsu. Aizen states that he and ichigo had become one with their Zanpakuto and that this is possibly the Zanpakuto's final stage.

The problem isn't with how they're made or written, they're usually as good as they can be. The issue is with the structure constraints. A 1,5h movie cannot tell half the story a season of an anime (~8h) can. So it always feels short and kinda lacking."

Noting that Ishida is not stupid, I'd assume that unless Mayuri took it out after the hecuo mundo arc, the two of them might actually be  working together at the moment, trying to find out a way to win the battle.  The bacteria would not be used against Ishida in any manner with how the plot is set up. In the worst case, Ishida could always just tell the sternritter he has it.

bleach,3cz7qi,EspadaPrimera,5,Sun Jul 12 03:04:25 2015 UTC,"Well, they go back to Ywach. I mean this is mentioned when he purged all the quincy so many years ago (Including Ichigo's mom) and he also demonstrated this when he killed Robert (Sternritter N) just to ressurect his imperial guards. I'm going to assume that to Ywach, The Quincies (which HE created) are like parts of his soul with different powers. It's like each Quincy is a different type of energy from his body. After they die, they return to his body."
bleach,3cz7qi,HatoriHanzoSteel,5,Sun Jul 12 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain this can't apply to all Quincy though..  I don't think all Quincy are basically just manifestations of his soul.   My theory is that part of his ability to distribute power comes from the people he distributes power to being willing to ""give"" their soul to him for him to do it.  I also think an unintended consequence of giving away the power was that the power could be passed down through birth.   So, while Ywach can still have control of them for periods, like he does with Ichigo through his blood, he cannot take away their powers, and the ability for him to control their person may be able to be resisted.  This could be why Ichigo was a war potential other than his general strength. It could also mean Uryu was a war potential as well, and this is the reason why Ywach was quick to recruit him.  There is so much unexplained, and so much that probably won't be explained that it is all up in the air but I do think that the circumstances of their birth as Quincies will play a key role for Uryu and Ichigo as this thing progresses."
bleach,3cz7qi,Burgerburgerfred,5,Sun Jul 12 03:35:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know, if it's about willingness I'm very sure Masaki and Katagiri weren't very willing to give him their souls."

bleach,3cz7qi,Vlaid,2,Sun Jul 12 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"Yhwach created all Quincy. However, not all of them instantly return to his body upon death.   To begin with, not all deceased persons pass on into Soul Society. Spirits, in Bleach, can be reincarnated in various forms. A smaller portion of souls find their way to Soul Society or are sent to Soul Society by Shinigami.   Yhwach only takes back the fragment of a Quincy's soul that came from his own fragment. It appears that his soul fragments are reproduced and distributed into a new soul when a Quincy has a child. So, those go back to him and just leave a less-talented and less-powerful individual behind.   However, that individual still has their own soul. That's what Mayuri was conducting his experiments on. As for all of the other Quincy whose deceased souls we haven't seen, we don't have a way to guess where they went after they died. They may not have had the ability to manifest Quincy power on their own. So, they possibly could have just gone to Soul Society and lived in Rukongai or become Shingiami later down the line."
bleach,3cz7qi,Fearless-Fairness,2,Sun Jul 12 13:23:57 2015 UTC,"Did everyone in this thread forgot (including Kubo I suppose) that Mayuri experimented on dead Quincies souls that ended up in Soul Society before?

Also, Ginjo and the Fullbringers died and went back to Soul Society with their powers, so it could be possible. If you are pure-blooded Quincy, then I don't see why not.

Using his mask with that much of an advantage would achieve nothing. But when she used her vollstandig she instantly overwhelmed Shinji with bombs before he could even react meaning no time to put on a mask  It was the same thing with Kensei he pretty much one shot Mask de Masculine when he put on his bankai, Mask de masculine came back and he was still able to easily overwhelm him with his bankai theres literally no point in using your mask when your attacks are already causing massive damage on the enemy. It wasnt until Mask de masculine got his second cheet that Kensei was beat before he could react  Roses mask wouldn't have helped him since his illusions were already unblockable   I dont understand why people can't seem to figure out just how short the masks duration are for the vaizards as well as how inconsistent the timings are in combat. Ie Mashiro claims she could hold it for 15 hours, but it only lasted a few minutes in her fight against wonderweiss. If even Mashiro cant hold her mask for more than a few minutes at a time in actual combat what makes you think the rest of the vaizards can hold it for more than a few moments?   Take another situation Rose vs Starrk if they had used all there masks and tried to fight starrk from start to finish they would have lost a few moments into the fight from all the time being wasted doing nothing  TLDR; Masks dont last long and using it when you have an overwhelming advantage is pointless with the amount of side effects it gives"

I can look the same on the outside too after all the drugs and alcohol and shit ive gone through, but I'm not all ""alive and well."" I'm totally dead and shit inside.

bleach,3cx7ja,TransposableElements,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:18:28 2015 UTC,where exactly does it says that aizen stole a piece of rangiku soul?  edit: read 415... not exactly sure what happened... seems more like she was raped...
bleach,3cx7ja,ShiaLaBuff,-1,Sun Jul 12 05:02:55 2015 UTC,"If you read all of 415 and 416 it gives you a pretty clear idea, it just doesn't say exactly what was taken from Rangiku, but its pretty obvious. Aizen said he used the very souls of hundreds of shinigami and stuff. Rangiku survived, so only part of her soul was taken. Gin felt bad he could never get back what was taken from her.  And yea who knows maybe they also raped her.... or not."
bleach,3cx7ja,HazelnutPi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:58:19 2015 UTC,"Just read it...it says approximately Jack shit about anything being taken from Rangiku. There's just her looking a bit beat up, and some of Aizen's lackeys walking away. Other than that, there's a flashback with Gin and the people putting soul goo into the Hogyouku, while Gin is telling Rangiku that she won't have to cry...idk wtf anyone is talking about, honestly...reading too much into a simple thing."
bleach,3cx7ja,ShiaLaBuff,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"Haha try reading it again. You can read, right? Give you a hint, read more of 416, and take the dirt out of your eyes."

bleach,3cx7ja,ShiaLaBuff,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm being a dick? Haha look who's talking. Read 415 and 416 again, it says it in plain english what the hogyoku takes, and that that same shit was taken from her.   And are you that same guy that keeps trying to use new words?"
bleach,3cx7ja,HazelnutPi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"New words? Colloquialism isn't new...its a long standing English word. And which provider do you use? MangaPanda differs from MangaStream and others in terms of translation, so there could be differences there. Also, it only says that he carved out hundreds of souls of shinigami, as well as some from the rukon district with shinigami potential. Gin said ""I couldn't take back the thing that'd been taken from you."" It could be a soul bit, but she wouldn't have had corporeal form after that if it had happened, so we have no solid conclusive. I would think that he couldn't give her back her happiness, as his reason for joining the Gotei was for her...opinions are opinions, though."
bleach,3cx7ja,ShiaLaBuff,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"No.. its not an opinion, its right in your face. He took a piece of her soul, and erased her memory of it so she wouldnt snitch, and no one would look for her, thats why he only took a piece instead of killing her. Its pretty god damb obvious they didnt just rape her, the whole story was about aizen trying to perfect his Hogyoku. It was pretty solidly concluded what he took from her, and what the missing thing was that he wanted to get back for her, he wanted to kill them and destroy the hogyoku and free everyone's souls, especially the part of hers they took.  There is literally no other way to interpret that part of the plot when it's laid out so perfectly clear.    But if you want to pretend to be a moron and ignore entire panels of images and dialogue and act like its all a mystery or just metaphors, be my guest.  And by new word, I mean it's new to you, the way you use it, and by that I mean you're using it wrong, trying to sound smart, like the other guy. None of what I said was the use of inadequate colloquialism..., please go ahead and try to tell me how it was though, and I'll give you props for at least humoring me. God there are more of you guys poppin up every other day now."

Aizen sacrificed thousands of souls to try and complete the Hougyoku, who knows how he made it in the first place."
bleach,3cxslu,LazerDuck510,12,Sat Jul 11 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"He was saying that as a reflection to himself. He put on a façade for many years, fooling everybody. Gin was essentially a snake who cared for Rangiku who in turn had feelings for him.  He's referring to himself as the snake and wondering if she wcould still love him after all the things he had done. If you switch the roles and put Rangiku in Gin's position, would he be able to love her if she did those same things?  That's my take on it at least."

Shinji claims that countering the damage from the inverted directions simply by processing it all within the mind is not possible.

He has a funky hat sure, bit this is the dude who shot down the Royal Guard Palaces(even if only for a chapter) and took out Ouetsu with a single shot. His power is incredible and Lille himself is kinda brooding and mysterious. He seems to know more than he's letting on too, we've got plenty of frames of him observing Haschwalth and Uryuu with an almost distrusting expression.

He gave the example that, whenever Ichigo was in trouble or tried to call out more of his Zanpakuto's power, White was the one that answered him.

When the Quincy were defeated 1,000 years ago, they fled into the Schatten Bereich inside of Seireitei itself. There, the Quincy existed as spiritual beings made of reishi (like the Soul Reapers themselves). Existing as spiritual beings rather than physical beings, their aging process slow down significantly, or stopped all together.  Or maybe it's some kind of Yhwach magic, I dunno."

bleach,3csryd,Perpetualjoke,3,Fri Jul 10 18:51:04 2015 UTC,"Simplest explanation that comes to mind is that they've been living in a spirit world for the past thousand years, and more ambient spiritual energy = more powerful Quincy.  How does that effect their lifespan? Biology. The human body is constantly shedding dead cells and replacing them with new fresh cells. Eventually we can't produce those new cells as effectively, and we become 'old' - essentially people only die of old age because our ability to heal decays over time, making us less resilient until the natural wear and tear of daily life is too much to withstand (That's why even a minor injury like a small cut is bad for an elderly person, their body just can't recover as easily).  Now, if you take a quincy, with a natural ability to absorb spiritual power, and then put them in an entirely spiritual realm, alongside at least two people who's mere presence can increase their powers even more... The quincy's healing abilities would be far beyond normal, so while they grow to maturity at normal human rate they wouldn't have any issues with old age.  To put it into numbers to help visualize. Say in you're 20's you recover 100% of the energy you expend in a day during your sleep. Then every year that drops by 1%. 30's it's 90%. 40's it's 80%. 50's it's 70%. By the time you're 100, you're only recovering 20% of the energy you expend in a 24 period, so you're pretty frail and tired, if you haven't gone into permanent sleep already. By 120, you're not recovering anything at all. I think the oldest human on record was like 130ish? Then with Quincy power, the healing is boosted by the spirit energy they absorb/channel; they only lose say 0.5% per year. So at age 40, they have the same resilience as a thirty year old, and at age sixty they've the body of a forty year old. Crank that up to Sternritter level - super powered quincies with extra power inscribed to their souls, living in a spirit realm. So they lose say 0.01% per year. A Sternritter would take 1,000 years to 'decay' by the same amount as a vanilla human would in ten.  All just fancy ways of saying that prolonged absorption of spirit energy in a highly spiritual realm probably makes for amazing anti-aging cream. As long as they can keep healing themselves otherwise indefinitely, age is meaningless."

Ichigo in his shinigami form does not age, atleast fast. It's not so far fetched to say that ichigo could let his human body age and stay in his youthful spiritual form if he wanted"
bleach,3csryd,Keranu,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"Quincies are human so they age like normal if they are in the human realm. The reason Bazz, Haschwalth and any other Quincy has been able to live for 1000 years is because they were hiding in the Schatten Bereich.   The Schatten Bereich is hidden in the shadow of Soul Society. Aging works entirely different in Soul Society because everyone's bodies are made of reishi and not physical matter.  The same can be said for Ichigo, Orihime and Chad. They could remain in Soul Society for hundreds of years and live normally because they wouldn't age like regular humans anymore."
bleach,3csryd,Alluka-,2,Fri Jul 10 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there also a thing about time itself going a lot slower? When Ichigo was out saving Rukia for days and days, didn't he come back to Earth and realize only a day passed or something?"

bleach,3cut0p,Seri55,10,Fri Jul 10 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"Ginrei couldn't have been from the original 13. In Turn Back the Pendulum only Yama, Ukitake, Kyoraku and Unohana have been serving since 100 years prior. (Source).   From the bleach wiki: Gotei 13 is around 2100 years old, and Byakuya is the 28th head of the Kuchiki clan. Assuming that each head of the clan also served as captain that means each was a captain for 2100/28 = 75 years. Assuming from my first point that most captains don't make it to 100 years then this seems like a reasonable result."
bleach,3cut0p,H4rtland,3,Fri Jul 10 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting that I missed it, but Shunsui seems to indicate that he and Ukitake were part of the original guard.  He is corrected to include Unohana, who I believe we know to be part of the original thirteen.  Yama also states that Shunsui and Ukitake where his first two successful students, and his best students, from the academy, which may be where the concept of an organized Gotei comes from.    Possible that Ukitake and Shunsui were part of the original war as well?"
bleach,3cut0p,unitedpath,2,Sat Jul 11 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ukitake or Shunsui were original captains, but rather the first students. Yamma says they were the ""first graduates of this academy I created."" Also, we know that Sasakibe attained bankai before they even graduated. I think they were just kids during the first war, not real members of the gotei. I could even see them getting involved almost accidentally with the warring gotei and quincy  Edit: After re-reading the flashback of Yama and Sasakibe that gives some of their backstory, it seems like both options are actually true. It suggests that Shunsiu and Ukitake were students when Sasakibe started asking Yamamoto if he could be his assistant. From the look of it, none of the three were in the original 13, but all joined later. Sasakibe never studied under Yamamoto because he said that it was pointless to learn from the one you wanted to help, because you'd just be a weaker copy of them. He learned his own style instead"

He could be referring to the guard as it was composed when he became a Captain (seems likely) or the actual original guard (slightly less likely, although in the picture of the original 13 posted in here the figure to the right of Yama seems to be Unohana and the figure to her right...might be Ukitake?)"

It's possible they were original members but I'd say it's extremely unlikely.  Isshin became Captain after the events of TBTP so no he is not an original member.  1. Yamamoto 2. (Shihoin clan member) 3.  4. Kirinji - moved to RG, Unohana took over 5. 6. (Kuchiki clan member) 7. 8. Shunsui 9. 10. (Shiba clan member) 11. Unohana - moved to 4th Division, 2nd Kenpachi took over 12. Mayuri 13. Ukitake   That's all I have for theories. I don't have any idea who the other originals could be.

bleach,3cut0p,Alluka-,0,Sat Jul 11 02:16:05 2015 UTC,"Mayuri, Ukitake and Shunsui can all potentially be original Captains.   Mayuri was locked up in the Maggot's Nest for unknown reasons and put into a cell of his own rather than being allowed to walk freely. I'm inclined to believe he was an original Gotei member and he did some terrible things back in the day to warrant such a thing. They were a band of murderous thugs don't forget.  Shunsui and Ukitake were born a very long time ago. As mentioned in discussions before, Shunsui questioned Yama about the picture on his wall. The picture was of Yama using Zanka no Tachi West: Zanjitsu Gokui. He didn't use this ability against Yhwach so it must have been used in battle prior to the war 1000 years ago. This makes Shunsui and Ukitake potentailly 1000-2000 years old. They were also the first graduates of the academy to become Captains."
bleach,3cut0p,Zil_v_a,2,Sat Jul 11 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"This means that they hadn't been skilled enough to fight before the academy was created. As the original Gotei was a bunch of murderers, you'd assume it was pretty unorganized. I'd like to assume that the academy was probably created right after the first war, to rebuild the shiningami forces. That means they've probably replaced some captains that died in the war."

And we know the Gotei 13 was created just before the war 1000 years ago and Yama sought the help from strong people that probably didn't attend his Academy like Unohana.... basically criminals. These people probably remained captains after the war while Shunsui and Ukitake were probably still in the academy after the war but showed talent and became the first captains from the Academy after the war finished. That's my take on this whole situation anyway.

The clans and then Unohana and Royal Guard members? personally The Zero Squad have abilities that cater to the King itself so they could of been created (The bones imply creation) after the original group fought and lost members the new Guard replaced them and became the second generation Captains.  The Vizards could have relatives/connections of Captain level as mentors or simply as people they heard of.

We don't know either of that for certain yet - so cast this as idle speculation based on mechanics.   During Yhwach vs. Ichibei, Haschwald says that if Yhwach activates ""Almighty"" too early, he'll eventually lose control of it. We know that Aizen did something to Yhwach's perception of time.

For the purpose of this, however, it's absolutely necessary that some Hollow is left over.  It also makes the ""Quincy have a soul-level vulnerability to Hollowification"" explanation important to the ongoing plot.) Ichigo either loses, or voluntarily ""gives"" his power to Yhwach.  This may need to assume that ""Almighty"" is either uncontrollable or Yhwach is not being able to prevent absorption. OMZ, now a part of NewZangetsu, leaves Ichigo and enters Yhwach's soul.  Yhwach gloats over his win. OMZ, now loyal to Ichigo (see the forging) suppresses NewZangetsu's ""Shinigami"" side - allowing NewHichigo to come out, and disturbing the ""balance"" within Yhwach's soul. (Since Shingami + Quincy + Hollow = stability) NewHichigo encroaches Yhwach, who has no natural defense against Hollowification. Soul Suicide occurs.   That gets Yhwach out of the way, but given that he's absorbed the SK (and thus has become the new SK), that leaves things in a state where they're going to need a new Pillar SK.  Aizen still has the hogyoku in him, and with Ichigo ""empty"", seems like the only logical choice, unless Urahara moves it to Ichigo somehow (since now that the truth would be out there, Aizen might not want the position), or having been in Aizen it's now ""complete"" and can take on the role itself, without a host."

The fact he has his Zanpakuto now, means he is fighting as one with his powers. It's not like where Ichigo is just fighting, then when he is about to die, White tags in and they are fighting as separate entities. If Ichigo dies, he is actually going to die."

This particular trojan doesn't require admin access (it'll only encrypt your files if its run without admin permission), which caused a bunch of problem as people go about with the mentality as limited user = safe.

This is exactly what I wanted to say on the issue but it does raise the bigger point of both sites being a nightmare every chapter release day. I'd be interested to know if there are better alternatives available that host the manga on the same day? I think the only reason they are in use is because they launch so quickly and everyone is eager to read the latest chapter"

Sign up needs an IRC client though, so its a bit of a pain. I think Andy's imgur host idea is probably the best way to go"

bleach,3cr1mo,MetalPein,10,Fri Jul 10 05:09:21 2015 UTC,The issue is promoting a website that hosts malware. Some people are upset about that.  I'd like to avoid giving them any traffic at all.
bleach,3cr1mo,MetalPein,2,Fri Jul 10 05:27:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that's true but there are many websites that have malware and everyone visit them. Some people just feel safe because they have anti-virus or some software and don't find any problem at all. Still I understand your point of view and for those who don't want to risk.  In my opinion, you should post the MP and MS links with some note and then imgur links in case someone doesn't want to go read at MP or MS. Also, doesn't manga reader (site link) publish the same scans and the same translations as MP?  Note: I don't know if the same happens to Bleach but are MP translations correct or accurate? In the chapter of One Piece (this week) the translations were misleading and nonsense. More than usually. They even have this. Click on your own risk. It isn't spoiler if you watch the anime (Punk Hazard or Dressrosa arcs)"
bleach,3cr1mo,dynrte,6,Fri Jul 10 17:48:48 2015 UTC,"People are free to visit the sites, I just don't want to advertise them to avoid people whining to me when their computers get infected due to their lack of care.  Honestly, it's really just not an option. Both could be linked in the chapter discussion threads, but I'm really talking about the announcement bar underneath the banner, which has no room for four links + warnings.  Mangareader is just as bad as MP, and isn't available in a lot of countries.  The translation quality changes every week as translators change. Chapter 601 of Bleach seems like it was ""translated"" by someone who couldn't even read Japanese and just put in whatever they thought the pictures looked like."

bleach,3cojlp,MetaAmbience,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"Well that's what happens when people pirate and use adblock plus in the first place. They have to get more and more aggressive with ads and cheap content and having multiple web pages for each line of text (blog sites like buzz feed) just to make the few dollars they're not getting if people actually purchased shit or simply let the simple banner ads exist. Adblock was made to block invasive pop-ups, now some assholes customized it where it turns off ALL the ads... So basically unless you own Amazon, Ebay, or some other store that sells tons of physical products on a daily basis, your website isn't making jackshit and you're losing money keeping it up.  90% of all apps priced at even 99 cents to 2.99 are all pirated. All of the harmless ads websites used to have are impossible to use with adblock and shit now, so they gotta resort to using more and more invasive ads. Being an indie developer myself, I've done my research. If I release my game for more than a freaking penny, it will be pirated up the ass on 3rd party android sites and jailbroken Apple sites, and I'll be screwed. So it has to be free, it has to have all the ads I can fit, and I have to produce SHIT TONS of extra content for people to purchase (extra skins and optional stages, nothing gamebreaking like pay-to-win stuff). It takes lots and lots of time to create content. My programmer is making the game faster than I can make the art, that is how long the art takes to make. I mean I could just download and trace things, and basically steal, but I'm a little above that, but I will if I have to, you know, so I can make a living like everyone else.

I'd like to rehost the scans on Imgur each week so that people don't have to visit any risky manga sites, but it's also not always feasible for me to do that. So far nobody else has stepped forward to do it, so we're stuck with linking to Mangapanda.  I've made several posts and comments in the past warning people of the risks with using Mangapanda, and advising on how to avoid them."
bleach,3cojlp,Andygoesrawr,3,Fri Jul 10 01:39:09 2015 UTC,Is it a matter of getting permission from mangapanda or mangastream to rehost their content? Or is it simply no one wants to take the time to make an Imgur gallery each week? If it's the latter I don't mind taking a few minutes each week taking all the pages and uploading them to Imgur.
bleach,3cojlp,mavgeek,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Are you able to be in the IRC around the time of the chapter release each week? The issue is usually that most people are asleep by that point or are otherwise too busy.  I can always upload them to Imgur, but doing it fast enough that nobody is missing out by reading it there instead of on Mangapanda is the issue."
bleach,3cojlp,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:17:48 2015 UTC,"I'm typically awake around that time, it's Thursday mornings for me when they are released, IRC isn't an issue I can always load it up. It's just a matter of getting the pages and reupload them in time for the weekly discussion thread."
bleach,3cojlp,mavgeek,2,Fri Jul 10 02:20:22 2015 UTC,The discussion threads are put up within 30 seconds of the chapter's release on Mangapanda. Realistically the Mangapanda link will still be in the thread for a few minutes until the pages are rehosted (otherwise people will post their own links to the chapter which becomes a pain to remove) so it's mostly a matter of rehosting ASAP.  I'd really appreciate the help. We can try it out next week and see how it goes.

At this point I don't care that mangapanda makes the translations, I'd rather read someone's re-paste at any other site than have to scan my computer again to get rid of some annoyance. Those are just not trusted sites, way too many times have they threw dirt at the readers.  For people that wan't other sites: I currently read at mangareader, no idea how it works on a phone, the website gets new chapters the same day the rest but later (they have to steal them first, lol) for exchange never got a virus there and it loads pretty fast.

bleach,3criul,meanpuffiethingy,9,Fri Jul 10 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"It's a popular theory, and since we now know that zanpakuto were an invention, so it's seeming likely. Ichibei, as the oldest shinigami, is likely to be the contributor.  Unless of course it's none of them. Kido could be an old form of martial art, formed by the first souls in soul society to help facilitate the control of one's spiritual pressure. That would make it older than any shinigami and, therefore, all of the zero division. This would make sense given that people who aren't shinigami can use kido as well. Ganju for example uses that kido based sand move, and hes the one who taught ichigo the basis for all kido moves. This implies he was taught kido at some point, and since he's not a shinigami, we can infer that means kido exists outside of shinigami, unlike zanpakuto which are specifically given to shinigami only (anyone else who has one stole it).   Which reminds me. Wouldn't it be awesome if we got to know just a little more about soul society as a culture? I mean, actually expecting it from kubo is a little much at this point, but we know almost nothing about soul society other than its supposed to be like samurai era japan. It'd be cool to see what kind of special customs they've developed over the years.  Anyway, I can't wait to see what kubo puts out as the true answer (if he ever gives one)."
bleach,3criul,a310gintoki,2,Fri Jul 10 05:33:14 2015 UTC,"I think learning more about soul society is an AWESOMEE idea. All we see is the stuff about shinigamis fighting off hollows and quincies and stuff, but learning more about the everyday life of the average person in soul society would be fascinating. I think the politics in soul society would be interesting. Are the 4 Noble families good or are they bad (to the avg, non-shinigami citizen)? What happens when evil-hearted souls get sent to soul society and maybe how do these villianous souls fight off the seemingly more powerful shinigamis?"
bleach,3criul,Andygoesrawr,8,Fri Jul 10 09:48:08 2015 UTC,"It's guaranteed to be. Ichibe'e created the name of everything in Soul Society, so he also would've made the names of all the Kidou. Considering the names and incantations have such importance, I'd say his naming of them was essentially creating them.  The question is who invented Hohou and/or Hakuda. Senjumaru's a possibility for Hohou, but I think Hakuda is a bit less likely. Maybe nobody invented it."
bleach,3criul,Andygoesrawr,3,Fri Jul 10 05:50:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, that might also explain how when kido are used without their incantations they are far weaker. it's probably cuz the incantantion is in a sense part of their full name.  I would assume that hohou and hakuda are maybe just skills that ppl naturally developed, since they're more physical abilities. but all the stuff that the zero squad has contributed are way beyond anything that can be naturally developed or humanly possible, like zanpakutous and artifical souls, so im not sure if zero squad has anything to do with hohou and hakuda"
bleach,3criul,CRAEREASDW,2,Fri Jul 10 09:42:14 2015 UTC,"Hohou's pretty complex. I'm sure Shunpo alone was created naturally, but techniques that make use of it and improve general high-speed combat would have had to have been invented. Stuff like Senka."

bleach,3cnm5f,kingofdabz,15,Thu Jul 9 11:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'd hazard a guess its because everyone loves Bazz. We haven't really been given a reason to like Haschwalth. All he's done is bad- killing off fan favourites at every turn. I really liked Cang Du- slash, he's gone. There's quite a few devoted BG-9 fans here- he was taken out. Even Ichigo's awesome Fullbring Bankai wasn't safe from Haschwalth's blade.   Bazz however had a full arc- Shinigami loyalist beating up Captains left right and centre with a devil may care attitude. He sees his supposed allies turn on him, had his own philosophy of the strong survive turn on him. And to top it all off, he was not only good all along, but his tough guy schtick was all a play. He was painfully aware of how relatively weak he was in comparison to Haschwalth. He even seemed to never expect to win. He was a complex character and we were robbed of him.   So yeah, tl;dr Fuck Jugo"

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.    Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Yhwach may have accepted Haschwalth but to the other Sternritter, he is another authority figure to obey. Haschwalth made his choice to follow Yhwach and did not accept anyone else to confide in.

bleach,3cnm5f,CRAEREASDW,11,Thu Jul 9 09:05:21 2015 UTC,That seems like a a bit of a stretch. Especially when you realize we haven't seen Ywach treat anyone like much of a friend. Hashbrowns is heavily implied to be necessary to Ywach in some way. If that's the case then I highly doubt Ywach is treating him well for some altruistic reason.

At that time, Jugo actually really valued their friendship. However, when Yhwach chose Jugo, you could see Bazz giving his ""friend"" a pretty jealous, resentful glare; because of that, Jugo tried telling Yhwach that Bazz would be better suited for the right-hand man role, and only then did Bazz appear to soften up. But in the end, Yhwach still insisted on Jugo, and Bazz couldn't take that. Thus, in Jugo's eyes, Yhwach, not Bazz, was the one who seemed to truly consider Jugo as a friend and comrade. That's why Jugo decided to follow Yhwach instead. Bazz only seemed to care about being strong, and didn't truly value the friendship. So don't blame everything on Jugo, people."

bleach,3cp4x8,rickEbobby,9,Thu Jul 9 17:22:31 2015 UTC,Maybe something demented like taking the ability of the opponent to feel pain so they succumb to injuries without noticing how grievous they are.
bleach,3cp4x8,SilviteRamirez,6,Thu Jul 9 18:43:37 2015 UTC,why would that be his bankai?
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,5,Thu Jul 9 19:11:24 2015 UTC,Because he screws with the senses already.
bleach,3cp4x8,Makoto_Narukami,0,Thu Jul 9 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"yeah , true that , but the key word is something like ""invertion"" , be that of the watching or the hearing . but taking away the pain , i cant see a point in common with the shikai . then even if it was , it wouldnt be that cool anyway for 2 reasons ... for first , you actually have to cut the enemy , and that would be the same even without bankai . if the cut is deadly or the enemy loses too much blood , he will go down anyway , feeling the pain or not . the second (i was thinking of berserk armor) , when you take away the pain , you actually do a favor , permitting the enemy to fight to the fullest without feeling any limitation"
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,3,Thu Jul 9 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"I guess you can build on the idea with the notion that pain becomes pleasurable and pleasure becomes painful. Then, an already injured opponent would start ripping themselves to shreds upon bankai release. I say already injured since it's likely the opponent has a few cuts or bruises already and their bodies pick up on the mechanic at the onset, but I guess they could just be injured afterward, or simply strain themselves to the point of discomfort."
bleach,3cp4x8,Gristleborn,0,Thu Jul 9 21:52:34 2015 UTC,"sorry man , can't really follow you"
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,3,Thu Jul 9 22:07:02 2015 UTC,Sorry I was unclear. I meant that the opponent would inflict massive injury upon himself/herself because it feels incredibly pleasurable. It goes with the sensory inversion theme.
bleach,3cp4x8,Gristleborn,0,Thu Jul 9 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"Ah ok now i get it :) well , it makes sense too . But even if that was the case , the enemy , such as the elites , wouldnt be tricked to injure themselfes so easily . I wouldnt do something that gives pleasure but kills me in the process ."
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:50:53 2015 UTC,"Heh yeah, it was just a little thought experiment based on Silvite's idea. So, yeah it might not be effective against stronger opponents, but then again... Shinji doesn't have a great track record with his zanpakutou's abilities."
bleach,3cp4x8,Gristleborn,2,Fri Jul 10 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Poor shinji man , never even won a fight :-\ at least he tried . Lets hope better times will come ."
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"His Shikai makes his opponent disoriented, and his Bankai forces his opponent to split their attention yet ANOTHER time. Shikai forces them to learn the new ""controls"", then his Bankai would take their ability to react to damage. Meaning they could lose an arm and not necessarily notice, I don't assume or think every opponent would use his Bankai to go all Zaraki Kenpachi on everybody.   That being said, another idea for his Bankai could be some sort of nervous system infection. You have to breathe in his Shikai to be affected, so his Bankai might be a much more potent dose which let's him do all sorts of things like racking somebody's entire body with pain, or making them unable to focus and summon their Reiatsu."
bleach,3cp4x8,SilviteRamirez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"It is really complicated for me to get the concept man ... But anyway , i think his bankai is gonna be the sickest of them all , literally . I think his shikai is already sick (just look at how bambietta was in panic) ,so i cant immagine wha could the bankai do"
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,5,Fri Jul 10 00:05:33 2015 UTC,"It will probably still involve smell and scents because that's how his Shikai works.  Following the general formula for Bankai, it will have a scent that does something much more severe than flipping the opponent's sense of direction. We've already seen a hint of this in his Shikai where he can now make the opponent hear his words backwards.  It will also probably have a more effective way of making the enemy smell it than just spinning the sword to fan the smell at them."
bleach,3cp4x8,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:58:19 2015 UTC,Possibly making their limbs move differently. Like tsunade  did to kabuto their fight in part one of naruto.
bleach,3cp4x8,whatdc,5,Fri Jul 10 01:05:00 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a few things about his Zanpakuto. For one, it spins like the hand on a clock. For two, (the obvious one) it reverses literally everything. Maybe his Bankai can reverse the timing of attacks, or perhaps it does something similar to Orihime's ""time reversal."" I also thought that it could give Shinji complete control over his opponents body parts/senses AND their locations. For example, switching the eyes and the ears to function as the other. Also switching the location of these things, so yes the organs would be moved. This could also allow him to change the placement of his organs, so him getting cut could almost do nothing. But to go further, maybe it has a sort of mind control that reverses how the opponent see's him/her/itself and the world/Good vs Bad sides. Like it could make the enemy join their side or remain neutral while it is in effect. SO many ideas for him."
bleach,3cp4x8,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:45:08 2015 UTC,"i am okay with any of these apart the mind control : that would make him the most OP of the manga if u think about it . he makes haschwalt change sides , he makes the elite quincies change sides and think yhwach is the bad guy .... i dont see it happening , not in this manga : we have yet to see an actual mind control like that"
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"Remember, everything can be ""seen through"" with spiritual pressure. Aizen was able to nullify Sakanade's abilities with just his power, so when it comes down to it everything is about power levels. Chances are he will use his bankai to fight one of Ywach's Imperial guards. Plus, it was just speculation, and out of all of what I put, I don't think the ""mind control"" is at all on target."
bleach,3cp4x8,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"yeah man i know , we are all making speculation after all . but again , i really have to perfectly get that reaitsu vs reaitsu theme . it is not like all can be nullified using reaitsu : barragan , with superior reaitsu couldnt nullify soifon's bankai , tier harribel with superior reaitsu couldnt nullify toshiro's attack , kenpachi's superior reaitsu couldnt nullify tousen's bankai ... and a lot of other examples ."
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"It's not about nullifying, it's about resisting. Just saying, it's a subtle but important difference."
bleach,3cp4x8,SilviteRamirez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:27:30 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by resisting ? The ability works or doesnt . What kind of resistance did kenpach for example have against tousen ? Harribel vs toshiro ? I really didnt like that concept , it takes away the fun and the hope ."
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:13:00 2015 UTC,"It's not like a technique 100% works or 100% fails. That's only applicable to something like Soi Fon's shikai, where there's no middle ground between success (you turn into a butterfly and die) and failure (you, well, don't turn into a butterfly)  Look at something like Hierro instead. If you're not sharpening your blade with reiatsu enough you can't cut through it. You can still use your sword as a club and toss your opponent around (like Zaraki did to Nnoitra) but you're not going to draw blood. Hierro isn't nullifying your sword swings, it's just tanking/resisting them."
bleach,3cp4x8,chaosattractor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"Well sure , but i was talking about shinigamis . The only time the reaitsu thing aizen was talking about worked , it was against soifon , and not against any other ability , not any time . That is why it feels strange"
bleach,3cp4x8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:11:04 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't matter if every single quincy attacked Yhwach. He could just take their powers back, but his eyes alone would be enough to render them useless. Same thing with sensory effects from a zanpakuto. He probably sees right through them."
bleach,3cp4x8,shiba_keikaku,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, but I like the idea of reversing the sense of touch. So the person it's used on is in constant pain except when they are actually hurt."

bleach,3conq1,Fearless-Fairness,3,Thu Jul 9 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"Seems like he IS the upper end, or at least mid/low-tier captain. I'm thinking he's probably a bit below Shinji or so, given what we've seen so far."
bleach,3conq1,CameronHH,19,Thu Jul 9 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"Erh, I'm going to say that Renji is probably better than him by a large margin. Rukia is probably on his level also, and I believe that if Kira was still alive, he would also be around his level."
bleach,3conq1,DIMOHA25,7,Thu Jul 9 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, without confirmed bankai Hisagi is far weaker than Renji or Rukia."
bleach,3conq1,CameronHH,10,Thu Jul 9 16:36:42 2015 UTC,"Without Bankai, for sure. But he does have a Bankai, as Kubo confirmed he would. And Hisagi is already a super skilled swordsman, just in Shikai. With a good Bankai behind him, I'm sure he'll be on or around Renji and Rukia's level."
bleach,3conq1,CRAEREASDW,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:50:35 2015 UTC,"Rukia=Renji>Mask>Kenshi>Hisagi  Rukia>powergap>Hisagi  He's probably between Kenshi and Ikkaku in terms of power and about level in Bankai with Masked Mashiro.

bleach,3conq1,DIMOHA25,-5,Sat Jul 11 10:07:12 2015 UTC,"Nah, just as I said in my other comment here bankai hax is real, Rukia dominates every single loser who doesn't escape her AoE bankai, or posess OP heat powers."
bleach,3conq1,CameronHH,9,Thu Jul 9 16:57:44 2015 UTC,"Well, given we have no idea what Kazeshini's Bankai is, I'd say that's going out on an awwwweefully large limb.  Rukia wouldn't go straight for a Bankai, either. She would play around in Shikai beforehand, as almost all the fighters in the Bleachverse do. I personally think that in terms of just fighting prowess, Shuhei outclasses Rukia by a good bit. Rukia has incredibly powerful Zanpakuto abilities, but what does any of that matter when your opponent is faster, more perceptive, and has a better plan than you?   We can't compare Hakka no Togame with Kazeshini's Bankai, because we have no idea what Kazeshini-Bankai does."
bleach,3conq1,rickEbobby,7,Thu Jul 9 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Not to butt in, but I just have a feeling that whatever his bankai is will be hella fast and deadly. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Hisagi a really proficient shunpo user? He always seemed really fast to me."
bleach,3conq1,DIMOHA25,8,Thu Jul 9 17:12:24 2015 UTC,Tell that to Soi Fon's bankai.

bleach,3conq1,CameronHH,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. Kazeshini's whole theme is being used for killing, and a very efficient and quick tool for doing such. It's name means either Wind Demon or Death Wind, iirc (/u/AndyGoesRawr pls), and what's more swift than the wind?  Whatever Kazeshini-Bankai is going to be, it's going to be a weapon that is good for one thing, and one thing only. Killing things, and doing it very well. I think for sure that once Shuhei gets his Bankai training done, he will be at or above Rukia in terms of deadliness."
bleach,3conq1,DIMOHA25,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yea, but if it can't teleport Hisagi or heat his surroundings he's an icicle as soon as Rukia goes bankai."
bleach,3conq1,CameronHH,4,Thu Jul 9 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"Dude, this is Bleach we're talking about. Where how fast and efficiently deadly you are count for over half of your winning ability. Rukia, while powerful and in possession of a broken Bankai, wouldn't be able to awaken Bankai before Shuhei could kill her. He's been shown to be a much better Kendo/Shunpo user than her, while she relies more on Kido and her Zanpakuto abilities. I'm not even a Shuhei fanboy, but I think that if we're doing a Shikai vs Shikai deal here, then Shuhei beats her at least 7/10. Since we can't do Bankai vs Bankai, since we have literally no idea what Shuhei's Bankai is, we can only go off what we know. And what we know points to Shuhei being the better combatant."
bleach,3conq1,DIMOHA25,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"But I was talking about Bankai vs Shikai! Full known strength vs full known strength. And activating is instant, transformation can take some time, like with Byakuya, but Rukia has near instant transformation."
bleach,3conq1,DIMOHA25,0,Thu Jul 9 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, Rukia has THE most OP Bankai in the series. Absolute Zero. Motion stops on the QUANTUM LEVEL. ATOMS CEASE MOTION. The amount of thermal energy required to bring something back from absolute zero is ridiculous as well. It would cancel Yamamoto's Bankai if she used it correctly.    ""Yo Gin you wanna stab me at 7km/s(20x the speed of sound)? LOL JK All motion stops in this circle. Good try though man."" ""Yo Barragan, you want to rot my very existence?

bleach,3conq1,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:27:50 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen anything from Hisagi since his fight with the prettyboy Arrancar that had Captain-level Reiatsu. Which he stomped.  Again, seeing as we have no idea what Hisagi's Bankai is, we can only speculate, but if we compair Rukia and Hisagi during the FKT Arc, and then assign similiar growth to Hisagi that Rukia has had in the time between FKT and now, I think it's safe to assume that Shuhei is incredibly powerful and on the level of, or close to, Renjia and Rukia in terms of Lieutenant power ranking."
bleach,3conq1,Fearless-Fairness,2,Fri Jul 10 12:18:26 2015 UTC,"He got beaten by driscoll berci without even a fight and the same against superstar , along with other 4 people . Then renji in shikai arrived and slapped him around before finishing him . Rukia's growth cant be compared to that of the normal shinigamis since she got trained by the royal guard and turned almost 10 times more powerful ."
bleach,3conq1,rickEbobby,7,Fri Jul 10 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"The gap in power between Vice Captains and actual Captains should be larger than that.  Byakuya's Bankai obliterated Hihio Zabimaru. So, Hisagi's Bankai should not really be that strong.   It'll put him ahead of other Vice Captains, but still won't put him on par with an actual Captain. The difference in reiatsu should be too large."
bleach,3conq1,Narissis,7,Thu Jul 9 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"Also Byakuya is a top tier captain and that wasn't even Renji's real Bankai, as we found out later.   Plus at the time of that fight, Renji had just achieved it maybe a day or two prior and had barely any time to hone it. It was an ""infant"" bankai so to speak."
bleach,3conq1,rickEbobby,3,Thu Jul 9 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Look at Sasakibe. He was a vice captain and incredibly powerful, probably moreso than Hitsugaya, Komamura, Mayuri, Rose, etc. Also the way captaincy works, one could be a very powerful lieutenant but they won't be promoted until there's a vacancy. So I don't think the reiatsu gap is as much of a barrier as you're making it out to be. Also Byakuya is a top tier captain and that wasn't even Renji's real Bankai, as we found out later."
bleach,3conq1,Narissis,5,Thu Jul 9 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"The gap in power between Vice Captains and actual Captains should be larger than that.   By that logic, no vice-captain would ever be eligible for promotion because that would require an immense and instant powerup from one level to another.  I think it's pretty well-established that power levels exist on a spectrum, and that a shinigami's power grows steadily until it crosses certain thresholds that allow him or her to advance in rank.   There is the one notable exception that achieving bankai does grant a pretty massive and abrupt powerup, but we have several examples of characters who have achieved it and still not become ""captain material"". All captains must have bankai, but not all bankai wielders must be captains."
bleach,3conq1,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"All captains must have bankai   Is this an actual requirement? I don't remember. Obviously Kenpachi doesn't have one, but he's an exception."
bleach,3conq1,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:02 2015 UTC,"All captains must have a bankai and pass a test observed by 3 captains including the head captain, but there are ""special circumstances"" where a shinigami may challenge the current captain to a duel to the death, and whoever wins is the new captain, bankai or not. The latter is how Kenpachis always do it, apparently."
bleach,3conq1,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to be selected: one is by a panel of other captains, which requires that the bankai be demonstrated to that panel.  The other way, which is normally used for the 11th Squad, is to defeat the existing captain in single combat. This is what Kenpachi did, and does not carry an obligation of bankai."
bleach,3conq1,Narissis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:49 2015 UTC,Promotions aren't based on power level. Ikkaku was considered for a promotion over Renji even though Renji is stronger.
bleach,3conq1,Fearless-Fairness,2,Thu Jul 9 17:29:27 2015 UTC,The gap in power between Vice Captains and actual Captains should be larger than that.  Promotions aren't based on power level.    You're disagreeing with yourself based on these statements. :P
bleach,3conq1,Narissis,0,Thu Jul 9 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"No.  There's a power gap, but the power gap does not cause the promotions. Rather, the promotions cause the power gap.  Being in charge of a division requires more capability than being a Vice Captain. A newly promoted Captain will grow into their new role. On the other and, Vice Captains dont always grow out of their current role."
bleach,3conq1,rigaj,2,Thu Jul 9 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"There's a power gap, but the power gap does not cause the promotions. Rather, the promotions cause the power gap.   That makes no sense. You're saying that a shinigami becomes a captain, and then becomes more powerful as a result?  Of course power level isn't the sole factor in captain selection, but the Gotei 13 are obviously going to limit their candidates to sufficiently powerful members when selecting a new captain. Ergo, yes, the ""power gap"" is a significant factor in promotions, regardless of whether or not it is the sole factor.  Plus, there is the requirement that a prospective captain have attained bankai before being eligible for promotion, unless they manage to win a duel against an existing captain without it, as in Kenpachi's case."
bleach,3conq1,rigaj,0,Thu Jul 9 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"Being placed in dangerous or strenuous situations will increase a spiritual being's power.  So, being the Captain and being responsible for leading and protecting your squad members will, in turn, make you better at doing just that.  Don't forget that, to obtain Bankai is to have a certain level of mastery over your self and your heart. So, possessing Bankai reflects on the character of the person that has achieved it. So, you can't really say that people possessing Bankai are considered for Captaincy because it hints at their power level.  Really, there's no hint at what power level you need to possess Bankai.   So, given the interaction between power level and personality, as well as Ikkaku being considered for promotion before Renji (even though Ikkaku's Bankai is not common knowledge) indicates that the focus of Captaincy promotion is the character of the applicant and not their power level."
bleach,3conq1,DylanTheZaku,3,Thu Jul 9 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"Where's this evidence for Ikkaku being considered for promotion to captain? It's been established that he declines any opportunity to be promoted to vice-captain in order to remain with his present squad, but I can't recall any time it's been said that he's a candidate for captaincy.  Rather to the contrary, he deliberately conceals his bankai to avoid becoming a candidate in the first place.  Regarding the lack of information about the requisite power level to achieve Bankai... well, first off, I should mention that I'm not a big fan of arbitrary ""power level"" measurements to begin with. I think combat is a much more complex thing than can be measured by a single quantity expressing a character as ""power level x"". Things like strategy and environment also play a role.  But I think it's safe to say that Bankai, in and of itself, is indicative of a certain amount of strength. Because it's such a dramatic, exponential increase in raw power, achieving Bankai establishes a shinigami as having a great deal of strength regardless of other factors. There's also the relevant point that Bankai takes enough time and effort to obtain (in most cases) that a shinigami's power would naturally grow fairly strong by natural progression over the course of that time.  The examples we've had of characters achieving Bankai in unusually short time spans (Ichigo, Renji, Urahara, and probably Hitsugaya and Gin based on their overall rapid growth) are all unusually powerful characters anyway, so this actually seems to support the idea that a certain baseline strength is necessary for Bankai, and that it can be considered a sort of reciprocal indicator of a shinigami's power.  At any rate, I never said that Bankai possessors are considered because it indicates their power level. They're considered because they possess Bankai. But, as I've just proposed and as can be evidenced by simply studying all the existing characters and noting that there are no occurrences of ""weak"" shinigami possessing Bankai, it seems evident that there is a baseline level of power or strength before a shinigami can even obtain it.  These things don't necessarily have to be written in black and white, after all; much of it is implicit.  I think you may be a bit too eager to attribute captain candidacy solely to personality and intellectual aptitude in lieu of power level. As a popular meme has said, ""why not both?"" It seems to me that captains are selected (with the exception of captaincy won by combat, like Kenpachi) on the basis of capability and power, rather than one or the other."

bleach,3conq1,unitedpath,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"That's probably just my bias coming in. Shinji fought on par with 1 armed Grimmjow and Tousen. Hisagi was a bit worse for wear, but still fought Tousen and didn't do completely terribly - indicative of being below Shinji's level, but unknown by how much."
bleach,3conq1,rickEbobby,6,Thu Jul 9 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"It seems that way, especially since all the other vice captains either seem weaker than him, or we don't know enough about to gauge properly."
bleach,3conq1,Narissis,5,Thu Jul 9 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"If anything, Findor had not average but acceptable minimum Captain level, the weakest one we've seen was Hitsugaya(or Komamura without becoming human), and Hisagi shouldn't  be able to kick his ass without bankai, with it however he could be god-level considering bankai hax."
bleach,3conq1,rickEbobby,4,Thu Jul 9 15:48:20 2015 UTC,So I managed to get so off track with this thread that I started discussing the physical ramifications of absolute zero and general relativity. Apparently Hisagi is powerful enough to get me incredibly off topic.

bleach,3conq1,rickEbobby,2,Thu Jul 9 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"Just above useless.  Renji, Rukia, Ikkaku and feather hair guy are probably more powerful.  I've always been a big fan of Hisagi and hoped early on that he would take the kind of role that Ikkaku has (who always bothered me).  However, I think the pecking order is pretty well set."
bleach,3conq1,shiba_keikaku,3,Fri Jul 10 02:34:13 2015 UTC,"Shuhei is also one of my favorite characters (so I may be biased too lol). However, if he indeed has a bankai, I honestly feel he is near-captain level, or like you said, is the upper end (possibly the strongest) of the vice captains. I would love to see him go up against someone like Gerard Valkyrie or a ""reprogrammed"" Nimaiya (read more here) and be able to pull off a close but epic win.  Maybe I'm overestimating him, but I feel like he is possibly above, or at least on par, with updated-Bankai Renji.   Kazeshini is one of my favorite zanpakuto too. Dual-boomerang-chain-linked-double-bladed-scythes? Oh, I said hell yes."
bleach,3conq1,Accerbus,4,Thu Jul 9 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly! The main things that get me is that Findorr clearly calculated captain strength, and still got destroyed. And then the fact that when Hisagi released, he caught the attention of two different captains. No one cared when anyone else released. With Hisagi they were like, ""Oh shit, he's finally serious."""
bleach,3conq1,CptAustus,8,Thu Jul 9 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"The question does remain as to whether they noticed because his shikai was strong, or simply because he uses it so rarely that it was an occurrence worth noting.  And, of course, Findorr seems to have seriously miscalculated the strength of a captain, as Hisagi himself pointed out after the fight.  Having said all that, I'm in agreement that Hisagi is a highly capable shinigami and it would please me greatly if Kubo were to have him reveal a bankai.  ...but not before Kyouraku's, damnit. I've been waiting too long to see that. D:"

When he fought Ichigo, he could have killed him at any point of their fight His bankai is absolutely overpowered. Just think about it. All he has to do it scratch you, leave a piece of his sword in the enemies body and then activate the poison. So in a serious fight you can't get hit once by him, else you lose and die. And he kept this a secret from everyone He is pretty fast, but his sword alone has a pretty absurd range and speed"

He does not tell anyone what his bankai actually is and leads everyone to believe it just makes his sword even faster/longer then his Shikai. Also when he fought ichigo he would distract him with pointless facts like how far his bankai(really shikai) could go when really the dangerous part was the speed it extended. Compare that to the rest of the Shinigami which basically tell you their powers etc.

And he can do this from fucking anywhere, through a wall, through a city, whatever.  And when it's extended, it doesn't get any heavier to Gin than when in tanto form, but has a seemingly infinite mass, and since it's so long, if he just flicks his wrist making the sword do a sweep, the far end of that blade's going to have to travel at INSANE speeds to keep up with the hilt.  And he can fire and retract it so fast and repeatedly that the blade disappears and whoever he's done it to has more holes than swiss cheese, and also the poison thing.  And then there's the whole deceit side to him.  He's still alive, you thought Aizen killed him? Just as keikaku'd."

Other then Hiyori, I don't really think he ever fought or attacked with the intent to kill anyone. Especially in his encounters with Ichigo, it was clear his intention was clearly and deliberately to let Ichigo live without any sort of damage.  Showing some of his abilities in his second encounter with Ichigo, as well as some of his other abilities against Aizen just proved how purely dangerous he can be.  As well, his long term plan showed how cunning he can be. He was truly a personality that could not be read, he had as cool of a head and was as intelligent as anyone in Soul Society, being able to trick Aizen for as long as Aizen had his plan, learn the secret of his Zanpakuto, and pull off such a great plan only to be beaten by a Kubo Special Plotkai."

Sui-Feng has a deadly power too, but it's Kidou based, meaning it's strongly reliant on the strength of her own Reiatsu, and is mitigated by the strength of the opponent's. If she were more well-rounded she would be a bit more dangerous, but in the process she'd have to sacrifice speed and Hakuda which makes the chances of her landing the two hits on the same spot less likely."
bleach,3cmjrh,Andygoesrawr,7,Thu Jul 9 02:39:38 2015 UTC,also dont forget Gin also has great range on his ability too.
bleach,3cmjrh,Jiscold,4,Thu Jul 9 02:50:14 2015 UTC,"I hate the lolreiatsu argument against her. How likely is it she'll be fighting another person with as much spiritual power as Aizen, but also while she herself is in an exhausted state and heavily injured?   We don't even know if Nigeki Kessatsu would work on Aizen while she's at full power because she was exhausted when she tried to use it on him."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,12,Thu Jul 9 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind I never said she's low tier... I think she's a strong upper-mid tier captain. She's certainly much stronger than Mayuri, but people don't see it that way because of everything Mayuri can get away with using his inventions.  Everything in Bleach comes down to Reiatsu, but especially when it comes to Kidou. Technically if Sui-Feng were to fight Gin I have no doubt she would actually be able to defeat him with ease, but that's just because she's really fast and Gin doesn't have very high Reiatsu. That's the downside to being a jack of all trades.  I doubt any of the current captains have Reiatsu capable of nullifying or even weakening her ability, other than Kenpachi. A few of them have the skill in high-speed combat that would allow them to avoid her being able to hit them twice in the same spot, though."
bleach,3cmjrh,Andygoesrawr,3,Thu Jul 9 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say one thing if we're ranking captains - I'd say potentially Gin and certainly Soifon are low-mid tier.  I had a similar discussion regarding Byakuya, but since all captains can't be equally strong, some have to be stronger than others.  Looking at current and past captains, we have the likes of Shunsui, Ukitake, Yama, Unohana, Kenpachi and Aizen. Shinji is certainly not worth discounting either as a Visored with a ridiculous Shikai. Looking at past captains we also have the likes of Urahara and Isshin who are ridiculously powerful.  Gin and moreso Soifon are average-tier captains, not due to a lack of strength on their part, but just because there are so many absolute monsters in the Gotei 13"

The range and speed and ease and one hit kill nature of his sword, plus how we never saw him go all out, literally all we saw was him playing with his toys.  For example Gin could dissolve Unohana easily, Zaraki would try to tank it, he probably could have killed Aizen before he fused with the hogyoku."
bleach,3cmjrh,Ziazan,2,Thu Jul 9 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"I do agree, but I still feel the likes of Shunsui and Urahara could survive it due to a mix of experience, speed and reitsu.  My biggest gripe was how willing are to dub people high-tier captains when the sheer badassness of most of them mean the likes of Soifon and Byakuya are average, at best..."
bleach,3cmjrh,Freddichio,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"Oh Urahara no doubt, ""lol it was a gigai"" as he appears behind gin, who saw it coming and had his sword aimed back through his sleeve, which shoots through uraharas heart, to which urahara replies ""lol, gigai."" from where he was originally standing. it wouldn't surprise me if he was the fastest character in the show by a wide margin, the feats are insane. definitely got best sleight of hand.  I fucking love Kyoraku, but his sword needs to be in the mood to let him slip into the shadows straight away, or I reckon he's fucked.  Unless his bankai turns out to be absolutely overwhelming, I'm pretty excited to see his and uraharas.   Ukitake warned Shunsui not to release his Bankai ""where others can see.""   while Uraharas is ""not suitable for training""  Also really want to see Ukitake's bankai, hopefully he gets up soon."

Then again, he used it against lemmings so..."
bleach,3cmjrh,SilviteRamirez,0,Thu Jul 9 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"It also bothers me that people think Mayuri is weak. He's definitely not one for displays of power or might, but the hints are that he's average. So, he could keep up in a fight against another Captain level opponent. Even without lolscience.  Though, he'd probably just gas them and be done with it."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,10,Thu Jul 9 04:00:33 2015 UTC,"So who do you consider weak? The captains can't all be on the same level. Some captains are weaker than others, and some of the weak captains compensate for it with other things. I'm sure Mayuri is stronger than a captain-level lieutenant, but I'd still rank him as one of the weakest captains. His official stats are pretty dismal.  Anyway, this isn't a power level discussion thread. The topic is Gin, Mayuri and Sui-Feng are both pretty irrelevant. I've been trying to sway the subject back to Gin, but it doesn't seem to be working."
bleach,3cmjrh,Andygoesrawr,11,Thu Jul 9 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"/u/Andygoesrawr, what does the scouter say about his power-level?"
bleach,3cmjrh,Fibonacci_Of_Spirals,0,Thu Jul 9 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"For argument's sake, the Captains mostly are all at the same level. Yamamoto, Shunsui, Ukitake, and Unohana were called out for being on a higher level than the other Captains, but the rest are all impossible to rank.   No one's exact power level is clear in Bleach. Then, when it comes to fighting, they all have their own individual skills that can make up for differences in power.   So, you can try to rank the Captains in individual stats, but their reiatsu levels aren't clear and, as far as combat ability goes, they're all pretty much at the same level. Except for Sui-Feng, Mayuri, and Zaraki. Those three have exceptional skill in a certain area that should raise their combat ability above many of the other Captains."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"Wait wait wait, you think Soy-Sauce's above Mayuri? Mayuri's invincible, his inventions are a huge reason why he's so insanely strong for sure, but that's his character. The only time I can think of that he was ""beaten"" was when he was gathering data on Uryū. You saw what happened with Szayel, ""oh no my organs. oh no. im dying. lol."" I'm pretty sure the same sorta thing would happen with Soy. She'd try to dissolve him and god knows what would happen but it wouldn't work, maybe he'd turn into a swarm of nano-Mayuris, who knows, or maybe he'd just say he'd locked the reishi he was made of or whatever. He can pull any shenanigan he wants because science.  As a side note, I don't think Soy would be fast enough to dodge a Gin that's really trying to kill her either, he can extend and retract that sword so ridiculously fast and repetitively that it's just a blur of blades and his opponent becomes ribbons before dissolving into mist, we also never see him going full on DIE mode, he's always toying with his opponent, and keeping things hidden, wouldn't surprise me one bit if his reiatsu is actually massive and he's just incredible at suppressing it.

bleach,3cmjrh,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:23:55 2015 UTC,This one comment sums up post Soul Society Rescue arc Bleach combat pretty well.
bleach,3cmjrh,Korrasch,2,Thu Jul 9 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"Gin's got star power and his Bankai's got hype. Soifon's a jobber; her speed is just a benchmark to show how everyone else she fights is so much faster. Even with Shunko she was unable to dodge BG9's attacks and he didn't even bother using Vollstandig. Overall, her win-rate's abyssal and maybe even worse than Hitsugaya's. Unless she gets a good fight, Hisagi will end up being seen as more powerful than her when he whips out his Bankai."
bleach,3cmjrh,CRAEREASDW,0,Thu Jul 9 12:19:51 2015 UTC,"She's not a jobber. When she loses, it doesn't show how much stronger her opponent is. This is because her opponents do not go on to fight others. Jobbers hype their opponents, but you can't really say the opponent was hyped if they never go on to do anything else.  In any manga, any character that is extremely fast breaks the manga. You can't draw a good fight for them because you have to find a convincing reason that they don't just run up to their opponent and slash their throat before the enemy can react.  So, in every one of her fights, Kubo nullifies her speed and Hakuda. He only allows her to fight enemies that can, not just combat, but can completely nullify her world breaking powers.   -She fights Yoruichi who is just as fast and more skilled in Hakuda.   -She fights Barragan who has the ability to slow her down if she tries to hit him and she conveniently forget to use Shunko (even though it is later revealed that she had actually mastered Shunko at the time wah wah waaahhhh)   -She fights BG9 who is impervious to physical damage. So, it doesn't matter how much faster she is because when she hits him, it doesn't do any damage.  She'd be doing great if she ever fought anyone that wasn't tailor made to beat her.   Really, BG9 and Barragan couldn't fight against her Bankai, but it was made unavailable during the fights. With Barragan, she was so out of practice that she could hardly carry Jakuho Raikoben and lost consciousness after firing it. With BG9, Kubo just removed the option of Bankai by stealing it from her.  She's a constant victim of circumstance."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:29:55 2015 UTC,"She has to touch you twice in the same spot at melee range. Gin only has to touch you once from literally any range which is done by simply pointing his sword at you, then you disintegrate as the toxin eats you, if you hadn't already died from the cut.  Her bankai also hasn't done any damage to anyone if I remember right. It looks fucking awesome but it always gets no-selled."
bleach,3cmjrh,Ziazan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"However, Gin's sword is not extremely fast. So, it's quite possible that Gin's Bankai could be dodged. The farther away Gin is, the more likely the opponent will react to it. Also, it's not confirmed to b faster than its Shikai form. Hitsugaya was able to dodge his Shikai when surprised with it at point-blank range.   So, Kamishini No Yari is likely to be dodged unless some other strategy or distraction is layered on top of it.   Her bankai also hasn't done any damage to anyone if I remember right.   No, don't make me have this same argument again.  Barragan was able to use Respira to head JR off the first time she used it, but when he actually got hit by it the second time, it fucked him up.  Barragan's arm was blown off, his rib cage was blown open, and half of his skull was blown away. Barragan is the Segunda Espada, he was in his released form, and he had the Senescencia time barrier around his body to dampen attacks. So, Barragan had a lot of strong defenses in place for any attack that came at him and yet JR still fucked him up that much.  How many other Espada do you think would be able to keep fighting with half their skull blown off and their rib cage blown open? Barragan himself only survived because he had no organ. Barragan kept on moving up until his skull was destroyed.   That's just another way that Kubo fucked her over. He gave her to an enemy that couldn't die from physical injuries.   As for BG9, the damage JR did to him is shown later when he is tied up along with Cang Du. JR blew away his mask and all the armor on his torso from the neck down to the pelvis. That whole area was blown open. Even if he was allowed to go back and keep fighting, that whole side of his body just would have been a giant weak spot. He was fairly defeated by JR.  So, definitely don't say it didn't do any damage. If a flesh and blood person got hit with JR, that would just be the end of the fight. Who really has defensive power as high as BG9 (he was completely undamaged after Sui-Feng punched him so hard they could feel the ground shake over in the SDRI) or Barragan (his released forms Hierro combined with Senescencia)   Actually, the Blut Vene of the Elite Guard might be that strong now that they've been powered up to the point that they could beat the Royal Guard. We'll see how those fights go, though. Going in, it's looking like almost no one on the Shinigami side is strong enough to try and fight the Elite Stern Ritter."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you feel quite strongly about JR. I suppose it's true that it only gets used against ridiculously defensive types, but it seems weaker than her shikai, which just kills instead of dealing an amount of damage."
bleach,3cmjrh,Ziazan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"Her shikai kills by creating an explosion originating at the point where her two Homonka touch.   Her bankai creates a much larger explosion without having to touch the enemy twice.   So, get power goes from two-hit kill to instant death."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,6,Thu Jul 9 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"A fight between shinigamis is a battle between reatsu*. If you recall, soi fon's abilities didn't work on Aizen since her reatsu was completely inferior; whereas Gin's ability worked on an even further evolved Aizen (Showing that his reatsu isn't as inferior)."
bleach,3cmjrh,HamzaKhurram,9,Thu Jul 9 05:54:49 2015 UTC,I always just assumed Aizen was lying and was using the powers of Kyoka Suigetsu to fuck with everyone while he stood like 10 ft away.
bleach,3cmjrh,-MuffinTown-,4,Thu Jul 9 07:24:02 2015 UTC,Well Ichigo vs Kenpachi basically showed the same thing. Kenpachi couldn't be cut by Ichigo for some time due to their reiatsu difference unless I'm remembering it wrong.
bleach,3cmjrh,ThisIsMyFaise,3,Thu Jul 9 12:14:12 2015 UTC,Well..  Ichigo hollow-fied and was bankai against him but he stayed in Shikai and fought him just fine.  I would say that puts him well above the average captain.

bleach,3cmjrh,Jumpkov,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:58:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's just an average captain. Sometimes I feel like the Bleach fanbase sometimes over hypes him just for almost killing Aizen.   Why, because an average captain could have hurt Aizen at this point? I don't think so. Even before he evolved his reitsu was so high Soi-Fon's shikai couldn't harm him. While he was in cucoon form he took a massive getsuga tenshou to the face, and merely said it was ""palpable"". He then evolved beyond that. He let the janitor run into him, and he broke it. Weaker souls died just standing near him.  And yet Gin was able to pierce him and make a hole in his chest large enough to throw a basketball through. Gin should have won imo- it was BS that Urahara's kidou didn't activate then. But I guess it wouldn't have been as exciting without the Ichigo fight."
bleach,3cmjrh,whatacrappyusername,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"The hype comes from Unohana realizing Ichigo was only at half power when she could sense that his reiatsu was still on par with a Captain's. It was never confirmed if his reiatsu increased past that of a Captains after she restored his reiryoku.  However, people assume it was just for the purpose of arguing that Gin's own power is above that of an average Captain's.   Ichigo's power certainly wasn't twice that of an average Captain when fighting Ulquiorra. It also wasn't while he fought with Grimmjow. But, magically, after losing to Ulquiorra, his power is 2x average Captain."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,7,Thu Jul 9 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"It certainly could have been twice an average Captains when he fought Ulquiorra or Grimmjow.  Ichigo has always, in true Shonen fashion, had more power than skill.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Ichigo had more power than the 'average' Captain way back when he fought Byakuya in Bankai."
bleach,3cmjrh,unitedpath,6,Thu Jul 9 02:46:12 2015 UTC,"I think that he most certainly did have more power than the ""average"" captain when he fought Byakuya. When you think about it once he released his bankai he had so much power that it was literally hurting him. If he had been able to skillfully use that power how much more would he have dicked on Byakuya?"
bleach,3cmjrh,ShwimmingAway,2,Thu Jul 9 03:06:56 2015 UTC,"While I mostly disagree with what the guy above you is saying, it does bring up the question of, if Ichigo's power is really that vast, and all fights are just battles between reiatsu, how come Aizen can escape unscathed while Ichigo cannot when Ichigo has probably just as much if not more reiatsu than Aizen."
bleach,3cmjrh,rogrogrickroll,2,Thu Jul 9 14:16:49 2015 UTC,Ichigo was at one of his strongest points when he fought Byakuya. He was only slightly weaker than his Vasto Lorde form and that's because he was still somewhat in control whereas he had zero control against Ulquiorra.
bleach,3cmjrh,Alluka-,0,Thu Jul 9 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"If his power was twice that of an average Captain, he would have obliterated Grimmjow in Ulquiorra easily.   Really, the level of power White showed when he took over Ichigo's body and fought Ulquiorra was what 2x average Captain reiatsu looks like in a fight. White is not inhibited by fear or despair. So, White has access to all the power Ichigo's body can muster.  Ichigo himself was fighting at a level much lower than that.   As for the Soul Society arc: Aizen set it up so that Ichigo would fight with people that were close enough to his power that he could grow to overcome them. So, he fought Ikkaku, Renji, Zaraki, and Byakuya in that specific order because he would have just enough power to beat them. So, at the end of the Soul Society arc, his power had just surpassed Byakuya's. The power difference is exaggerated by the difference in speed."
bleach,3cmjrh,Fearless-Fairness,0,Thu Jul 9 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"The problem, i guess, is in figuring out what the average Captain looks like, and that might very well be Byakuya.  I think in terms of Reiatsu the general list looks like some minor variation of: (1) Yama (2/3) Shunsui/Ukitake, (4) Kenpachi, (5/6/7) Tosen/Gin/Kommamura (8) Byakuya, (9) Soi Feng, (10) Hitsugaya, (11) Unohana and then (12) Mayuri.    Mayuri suffers from being defeated by Uryu, I think.  And then we found out that Unohana is actually just right behind Yama.  Byakuya gets the RP upgrade and Soi Feng doesn't get respect despite the fact that she pushed Yoruichi to her limit when Byakuya couldn't even touch her.    In the end, its probably more accurate to say that most of the Captains are relatively close to one another with the largest differences existing primarily in skill and experience.  Yama, Unohana and Kenpachi have otherworld Reiatsu's, but not so unearthly that the others can't feel them."
bleach,3cmjrh,unitedpath,3,Thu Jul 9 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you put Tousen and Komamura so high, they don't really have any times when they blast out monster reiatsu. Tousen in particular seems quite weak. Also I think Unohana is almost definitely near the top. We only see her fight once, and it's vs full power kenpachi."
bleach,3cmjrh,fearsomeduckins,2,Thu Jul 9 06:29:11 2015 UTC,I remember Tousen was strong enough to keep the Espada in check - but I'm not sure if that was merely his tangential position to Aizen's power.
bleach,3cmjrh,Renarudo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:06:03 2015 UTC,"I always assumed so. Grimmjow was going to attack him when he had his arm cut off until Aizen stepped in. Also Tousen loses (with bankai) to Kenpachi, and I think that's the only captain vs captain fight with a decisive victory (outside of Aizen, of course). On top of that, he felt the need to get a Hollow form, whereas Gin just stuck with his regular abilities, and even with that new form he still was killed by his lieutenant. I would actually rank Tousen at the very bottom of the list as far as power, although I'm not entirely sure about reiatsu."
bleach,3cmjrh,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:35:36 2015 UTC,"Well he did cut off Grimmjow's arm, Hierro and all, while Ichigo's Getsuga only kinda scratched him."
bleach,3cmjrh,chaosattractor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:59 2015 UTC,"That's true. He is still a captain, after all, and even a weak captain is still quite strong. But also, I know Getsuga is supposed to be Ichigo's ""strongest attack,"" but it's an energy blast and in general swords seem to cut better than energy attacks, and also Grimmjow was blocking it a bit. And Ichigo's power levels are a little inconsistent, I don't think he was as strong as an average captain at that time."
bleach,3cmjrh,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I mean is average guys don't just slice off Espadas' body parts like that. His zanpakutou was even still sealed IIRC. In comparison, Ichigo went bankai to cut off Yammy's arm."
bleach,3cmjrh,chaosattractor,2,Thu Jul 9 15:30:00 2015 UTC,I agree with most of your post but the whole Unohana being the 11th in rank... She was the only true Kenpachi for how many centuries?
bleach,3cmjrh,Dustin_Smith,0,Thu Jul 9 06:09:22 2015 UTC,"I think that was kind of my point, though I may have communicated it poorly.  If you did the rankings prior to this arc it would probably look close to the above.  Now, however, you would definitely have to put Unohana closer to the top, maybe right behind Yama.  Also, although I, and a lot of others, have a tendency to put Soi Feng lower on the list, there is strong evidence that she was more powerful than Byakuya during the Sou Society arc, but after the RP upgrade who knows?  Again, based on SS arc you would have to put Kenpachi relatively low (I mean, he got beat by Ichigo who Gin basically defeated three times without trying very hard...) but knowing what we know now Kenpachi is almost certainly near the top.    I guess I just mean that ranking them is almost impossible and that its probably truer to say that they are all relatively close together in terms of Reiatsu, with the difference between them mostly being skill and experience.  Kenpachi is probably the only Captain left with next level Reiatsu, but it isn't so off the charts that others can't feel it."

Now i just think his mother used to wear it and it has nothing to do with any character we know of, but i believe she was squad 8 because she has shunsui's playful attitude and they both have a thing for haori, but not because his haori came from her."

bleach,3cl8wl,jk1988,3,Wed Jul 8 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say we have a good 2-3 years left at the minimum.  While Yhwach is maxed out right now, we've currently got to see the fights between the elites and the shinigami. It's also quite possible that Yhwach isn't the final baddie. We don't know yet. The Soul King could bust out from Yhwach and be the real boss. Hashbrowns could betray Yhwach. Mayuri could betray everyone. Urahara could be up to some sketch shit. Even if none of that happens, Yhwach probably has some crazy powers now. It wouldn't be crazy for him to conjure up a host of new enemies for the heroes to fight or some kind of crazy zombie Yamamoto.  I'm pretty sure we're gonna have some more Quincy flashbacks as well to see the Quincy side of the story.   We're probably about halfway currently if I was to guess."

bleach,3cl8wl,Caesar_XIIIVII,3,Thu Jul 9 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"All my predictions are based on what Kubo said, so I believe we still are not near the end, since he stated that this would be the longest arc, and we still have some chapters for it to be at least the same length as the arrancar arc.  But, if not for those assertions of him, I'd say we're near the end. The final battle will surely take place at the new palace, and Ichigo is already there. Even though Kubo can give us a hundred different fights before we reach Ichigo vs. Yhwach, if he does stretch the plot with no better reason than to just ""make it longer than the Arrancar arc"", that would be too lame."
bleach,3cl8wl,XVelonicaX,4,Wed Jul 8 20:31:01 2015 UTC,"I just hope Ichigo is done training for good. If during the final battle Kubo pulls another ""take a quick break and train for some super powerful be-all, end-all technique,"" it will definitely feel like a cop-out in order for Ichigo to beat Yhwach."

bleach,3cl8wl,elxx714,4,Thu Jul 9 00:11:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, but only the FGT felt weird to me, the others kinda fit in. Just for the fact that we have never (correct me if I am wrong) heard of any other Zanpakto having a last resort kinda thing.  I just got the feeling that Kubo made Aizen too strong which led to him having to give Ichigo something really powerful, combined with gimping Aizen(his enormous ego, causing him to underestimate and make mistakes). Just my opinion though.   All the other things can be explained, Urahara's secret method with a massive amount of power of will, the hollow inside of Ichigo, and the entire officer class shinigami's putting their reistu into Urahara's invention."
bleach,3cmjlu,Jiscold,14,Thu Jul 9 01:52:45 2015 UTC,"Hollows probably hunted them, considering they live on Earth. Being Humans with spirit pressure make them key targets..  I would assume it is easier to purge an area of Hollows as opposed to killing them only when they choose to attack as well.  That would just be the logical perspective though."
bleach,3cmjlu,Burgerburgerfred,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:27:34 2015 UTC,It's logical that they would kill them initially. But when threatened with War or maybe offered more assistance why would they continue to do it ?
bleach,3cmjlu,tigersharkwushen_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:09:15 2015 UTC,I am not sure they were threaten with war anymore.  We already learned in the last few chapters that may not be the case.
bleach,3cmjlu,Fearless-Fairness,6,Thu Jul 9 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"The main reasons are given back in the first arc of the manga. Shinigami are slow to respond to Hollows that appear in the World of The Living.   So, the Quincy must defend themselves from Hollows. The next step after that was militarizing themselves to hunt the Hollows rather than waiting for a Hollow to appear and attack.  However, the actual causes of war are not known. We don't know exactly what caused the uneasy situation between the Quincy and Shinigami to develop into actual war."
bleach,3cmjlu,elxx714,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"that could be how it started, but when threatend with war, im sure the Shinigami would have gotten more responsive and the Quincy should have backed down. just seems like there is more to it."

bleach,3cmjlu,mike1883,2,Thu Jul 9 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"Seeing how they can see and touch spiritual objects, I don't see why they couldn't have their own Soul Slaying marked weapons. Mayuri or Oetsu could've done something to help.  But oh wait that's right Kubo changed the story around and the massacre was because of Bach and his Nazi army, not because the original Quaker-based Quincies killed too many Hollows in the woods themselves."

bleach,3cmjlu,ChaosKeeshond,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:57:20 2015 UTC,"I like to put it like this. Shinigami are the soldiers that serve god. (soul king.) And Quincies are humans that learned to fight hollows and live in their kingdom. Well, In order for there to be balance in the world and multiple dimensions, there must be an equal number of Human souls and Hollows and Shinigami.  Now. The Soul king had a child (Ywach) and he was tired of humans being hunted to extinction, so he created Quincies to fight along side him to protect themselves from the hollows. This makes sense because some souls must die to hollows and some hollows must be purified by Shinigami. However, not all. There is some grey area. They can't over-hunt or let the hollows over-feed because this could disrupt the balance. So when the Shinigami asked them to BASICALLY stop protecting themselves, they said no.   TL;DR Basically, the Quincies were told not to defend themselves so they could be killed by hollows to restore balance."

bleach,3cmslx,oetsuthebest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:35:56 2015 UTC,The Quincies didn't age because they were living in the Schatten Bereich for hundreds of years. Everyone ages slower in Soul Society than in the human world because their bodies aren't physical.

Mayuri is insane, and of course shows no care for other individuals on the outside, but on the inside I think he cares. He is a man that will stop at nothing (And I mean NOTHING) to get the job done. He's very persistent and determined to protect the SS. That is why he interrogated Ikkaku. He went out of his way to make a device that could detect that one doll , Bawra, I think. He even make different drugs specifically for certain situations. The thought inhibitor he used on Kageroza so that he wouldn't use his Zanpakuto's abilities at that very moment so Mayuri could land an attack. His superhuman drug for Szayel (We still have NO idea when he administered it.) He also put Bacteria into Uryu and Renji to observe their progress in them BEFORE they went. He also replaced all his organs just an hour after learning of Szayel's powers. And his Looping drug he used on Toshiro after he was zombified. Let's not forget that before he even encountered Giselle, he had the captains blood already turned into a drug that allows him to gain control of them.  Mayuri may seem shady, but he is by far the most diverse character in the series. He is willing to die for the SS. That is evident. Plus, we've seen what he can do. He is more than capable of being a Captain. He has an Iron will. Soul Society NEEDS that."

bleach,3ckkd2,Shunsui_for_CC,7,Wed Jul 8 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"Well, Kaien died less than 100 years ago. He was still alive in the Turn Back the Pendulum arc (this is when Ukitake asked him to be a Vice-Captain). Furthermore, during this arc, the current 10th division Captain had died.   Now, during Isshin's flashback (about 20 years ago), we learn that he was 10th division Captain for some time. Hitsugaya and Matsumoto were his subordinates. What's important is that Urahara in the the Living World during this time, which means that he's already been exiled:    To add to that, when Isshin encounters Aizen during his fight with White, Aizen recalls a specific moment where Urahara attacked him during the TBTP arc. (http://www.mangapanda.com/bleach/532/4). Also, Aizen is already 5th Division Captain by this point.   So, Isshin can't be the same Captain who disappeared during that arc. He would've had to have become Captain later, while Kaien was still alive. Kubo didn't even show the 10th division at all during TBTP. I think he wanted to set it up so that it would be revealed Isshin was the Captain, but that doesn't really work because of what I just explained. So, it must be a different person.   Personally, I don't think it's a coincidence that Aizen was experimenting with Hollows and two members of the Shiba clan happened to run into them. Kaien's death and Isshin's disappearance likely happened around the same time or at least really close to each other, leading to the demise of the Shiba clan."
bleach,3ckkd2,Aaroniero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"Kaien's death definitely happened first though. Isshin's from the Shiba branch family but was head of the clan at the time of EBTR, which is only possible if Kaien is dead."
bleach,3ckkd2,SafferCrystal,2,Thu Jul 9 01:12:51 2015 UTC,Kaien died somewhere between 20-44 years ago. Isshin was Captain and disappeared during EBTR which was about 20 years ago.

bleach,3ci513,THE_LURKER__,2,Wed Jul 8 03:32:11 2015 UTC,So then we may be able to assume that since it looks like Bazz is currently using some sort of Burner Finger (attack Blut Artery) then he probably can't use Blut Vein at the same time to defend against Hash's strike.

I could however go for a Bebop Bleach, maybe with Hirako as the protagonist. When speaking artstyle then again, it doesn't really have anything there.  When speaking ""bleach looking differently"" I'd love to see it from the hand of Takehito Harada (Disgaea), Kagami Yoshimizu (Lucky Star) or in the style of Panty and Stocking, whoever was responsible for art in that series (can't find a proper credit). Just because how different they are from the source material.  When we speak writing, I'd be always up for something planned by Tsugumi Ohba (Death note), Ryōgo Narita (Durarara) or Gen Urobuchi (Saya no uta, Psycho pass, Fate/Zero, Black Lagoon).

bleach,3cg299,FishieSticks,3,Tue Jul 7 17:41:14 2015 UTC,I've got a few questions about Isshin too:    When do you guys think he learned his Final Getsuga Tenshou? Was it before he fought White or was it after he got his powers back?  Was Isshin ever put under hypnosis?
bleach,3cg299,whatacrappyusername,0,Tue Jul 7 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"Its extremely likely he was put under hypnosis because Aizen had already had the Captains (Visored included) under hypnosis in the TBTP arc. That was 100+ years ago and Isshin left Soul Society around 20 years ago so there is nothing to suggest he isn't under Aizen influence, along with everyone else in SS."
bleach,3cg299,JakabBigShow64,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"I have a few reasons I think he wasn't under hypnosis:  First Isshin wasn't a captain during TBTP arc. So Aizen most likely would not have put him under hypnosis at the same time as everyone else.    In Everything But the Rain Aizen used Urahara's invisibility cloak when we went to observe Isshin. Then he attacks Isshin himself, which reveals that there is another shiginami around. If Isshin was under hypnosis Aizen could have just showed up and then messed with Isshin's perception to make him think White attacked him.  Later Isshin seems to actually hit Aizen as he shows up infront of Ichigo with the mark from Isshin's Getsuga Tenshou on his face.  It is a minor detail, but Isshin did not hesitate to train Ichigo in the Precipice world. If Isshin knew he was under hypnosis, he should have doubted if the janitor was really gone. It could have been a trap."
bleach,3cg299,whatacrappyusername,3,Tue Jul 7 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"None of your points hold up:   All Aizen has to do is release his Zanpakuto to put someone under hypnosis. He would demonstrate his ""water based Zanpakuto"" to new recruits all the time, just like Momo. Its not like its hard for him to accomplish this or he can only do it once. What about anyone else that wasn't hypnotized..aka Masaki or any other Quincy that may show up? He would have to reveal himself to release his Zanpakuto. The cloak was just easier to stay hidden while he observed Shiro's actions. Aizen said he was at his limit as a soul reaper and was using the power of the Hogyoku. He didn't use Kyoka Suigetsu on Urahara or Yoruichi when he fought the three of them. Not to mention he could have released his Zanpakuto against Ichigo at anytime but chose not to test his new limits."
bleach,3cg299,JakabBigShow64,0,Tue Jul 7 23:44:18 2015 UTC,"What about anyone else that wasn't hypnotized..aka Masaki or any other Quincy that may show up?   Judging by Aizen's reaction to Masaki I'd say a Quincy was one the last things he was expecting. But there could be other reasons he decided to use the cloak other than maybe Isshin wasn't under hypnosis: Perhaps if Isshin won, he was plotting to pin White on Urahara (though he could have used KS for this too). Or maybe it was just as simple as it was raining (but he has an umbrella as well). Still kinda curious that he never used it at this point.   Aizen said he was at his limit as a soul reaper and was using the power of the Hogyoku. He didn't use Kyoka Suigetsu on Urahara or Yoruichi when he fought the three of them. Not to mention he could have released his Zanpakuto against Ichigo at anytime but chose not to test his new limits.   Well your last point seems to be contradicting the first one. But regardless of the reason why, you are right that Aizen never seemed to use KS on Urahara, Yoruichi or Ichigo. So that could mean one of two things, either Aizen hypnotized Isshin and just didn't make use of it because he wanted to test his new toy, or perhaps he was never hypnotized to begin with.    All Aizen has to do is release his Zanpakuto to put someone under hypnosis.   Yeah it is very easy to put someone under hypnosis- so the question would be why wouldn't he have put anyone under hypnosis if he had the opportunity? We know Ichigo at least was never hypnotized- what reasons could there be that Aizen never used KS on him? The only thing I can think is that he considered Ichigo to be under his control without KS, so he didn't see hypnotizing him as necessary. If that is the case, then I suppose it is possible he didn't hypnotize Isshin if he felt he was under his control too."
bleach,3cg299,whatacrappyusername,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:07 2015 UTC,Well your last point seems to be contradicting the first one.   No they don't. He was at his limit as a Soul Reaper so he used the hogyoku to become a transcendent being. After the transformation he was testing his limit of his new form without using Kyoka Suitgetsu.

After the transformation he was testing his limit of his new form without using Kyoka Suitgetsu.   I thought maybe you were saying Aizen couldn't use KS after he started evolving , but then you went on to say he could have used KS at anytime against Ichigo, so it seemed contradictory. But I guess that wasn't what you meant.   After the transformation he was testing his limit of his new form without using Kyoka Suitgetsu. Thats why he didn't put Ichigo under KS. That is the entire point of Aizen pushing Ichigo.   Well that could be it too. Seems like a better explanation actually. Aizen let Gin get close to him for the same reason too right? So he could have been planning on using others (besides Gin) to push his evolution before Ichigo. Seeing as Isshin was holding his own against Aizen prior to his evolution, perhaps he was planning on using Isshin like Ichigo?   Occam's Razor brother....Occam's Razor   The simplest explanation for why Aizen never appeared to use KS on Isshin, is that he never used KS on Isshin."
bleach,3cg299,whatacrappyusername,2,Wed Jul 8 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"Well Ichigo's last name was Kurosaki, which none of them recognized. The captain that left them was a Shiba. As for them not seeing Isshin, he was absent a lot for some reason. That could be important in the upcoming chapters? He could've just been with Ryuken, though. During Turn Back The Pendulum, I remember Shunsui saying that you can't just leave the Gotei. You either die or get outcast/put in Bird's nest if you are going to be a negative influence in their goals. Since he just vanished, I don't think they bothered to look for him and just looked to replace him. Just how Soul Society was I guess."
bleach,3cg299,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Tue Jul 7 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"The real reason is that Kubo didn't originally intend for this to be a twist, and thus didn't write the story with the appropriate foresight in some cases.   Any explanation we give you is a fan theory with the sole purpose of maintaining chronological integrity because as fans we seem hell bent on making sure the works of art we love are immune to criticism. And there's nothing wrong with trying to find an in-universe explanation for it, but let's refrain from kidding ourselves into believing it was intentional.  'Shit happens', there's a small plot hole in Bleach. No biggie. Fact is there are so many well played and foreshadowed twists that anybody who tried to use a few minor holes to impugn Kubo's storytelling prowess is really up themselves.  My theory? Ichigo's family is known to be spiritually aware, and so the Gotei 13 probably did their best not to bump into his family excessively or maintain conversation."

It's a possibility that he was concealing his presence from them too.  He'll be showing up eventually so we'll most likely get explanations when he does.
bleach,3cjjra,xXBad_UsernameXx,14,Wed Jul 8 12:14:29 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't see Ichigo ending up with anyone. He has really strong duality with both Rukia and Orihime, but I find it most likely that at the end of it all he's going to fill a role similar to the Soul King, wherein it's unlikely he'll have time for love. Plus, Kubo's painted him as a character who has no interest in romance, and I really think a strong part of his development as a character is to treat every single person equally, so for him to place another person above all others would mean his development meant nothing.  And to be fair, the majority of his duality with Rukia was developed in the Soul Society arc, which was essentially ""Rukia's arc"". Though for some reason Kubo had Orihime's character arc focus around her relationship with Ulquiorra for her story arc, rather than her feelings for Ichigo. But it was during that arc that we had Good Bye Halcyon Days, and the infamous Kurosaki-kun scene.  If the Fullbring arc weren't rushed, Kubo would've also drawn some parallels with Chad as he did in their earlier back story. That would show that it's really not about romance... it's about Ichigo's relationship with each character, and the parts of himself that are reflected in each of them. I fully believe we'll be seeing that with Uryuu in the coming chapters.  I think Rukia is the only character who really has to end up with someone, due to the fact that she's next in line to be the head of the Kuchiki clan and needs to marry to continue the line. Renji's the only character we know of who she could end up with (other than Byakuya, to keep actual Kuchiki blood in the line... but let's not go there), but I think it's equally possible she could end up with a character we've never met before. Or dead.  I also think Kubo's been forcing Orihime and Chad's friendship pretty heavily since the Arrancar arc, so I could see them together. They're both all about protecting others, and I think they complement each other really well.  Tatsuki's the wildcard that people usually bring up when IchiRuki and IchiHime is being debated. All I can say is that I think she will end up with Chizuru.  My OTP is Keigo and Ikkaku."

Not necessarily. He's already been shown as someone that cares for everyone, no matter the ""team"". Even right now, he's fighting against Yhwach, but not against the Quincies (he's trying to save Uryuu and actively repressed his powers in order to don't hurt the femritters seriously). He feels empathy for Aizen. And he's clearly past the point where a hollow was necessarily an enemy. I think this is enough to maintain his ""universal"" characteristics even if he chooses someone to love in the end.   I also think Kubo's been forcing Orihime and Chad's friendship pretty heavily since the Arrancar arc, so I could see them together. They're both all about protecting others, and I think they complement each other really well.   I beg to differ. Their interactions are clearly pointed to Orihime's feelings about Ichigo. If anything, Chad is being used by Kubo to reinforce the idea of an IchigoXOrihime ending, IMO."

He didn't say development as in it's just a prediction, he means that is how his character has already been developed, and continues to develop, and the word ""develop"" is used like ""Here is more story on the character""."
bleach,3cjjra,jajajonjon,2,Thu Jul 9 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"Agree Agree, from what I read definitely Ichigo is not really romancing more just protecting, also Rukia gives off the fated to die vibe. you think she would be forced to marry a specific person? what about the whole of soul society turning upside down wouldn't that shit on all sorts of ""this is what we have decided for the clan"". anyways thanks for the input! Also!"
bleach,3cjjra,Andygoesrawr,6,Wed Jul 8 12:58:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think she would be forced to marry anyone in particular. After all, Hisana was basically a street rat allowed to marry Byakuya.  I think the fact that Byakuya gave his scarf to Rukia is a good indicator that she's going to become head before this is all over. Byakuya might die, lose his powers, or just retire, which would also mean Renji would be up for promotion to captain of the 6th Division. Rukia will likely be up for promotion to captain of the 13th Division. They could make a strong couple, and build a strong relationship between the 6th and 13th Divisions, which is a fairly common thing.  And I think if the pairings I mentioned do happen, Kubo's been pretty transparent about it. Rukia and Renji trained together in the Royal Realm, and Orihime and Chad trained together in Hueco Mundo. Ichigo trained alone for the most part.  And as much as I don't see the point of Hollows making babies, Grimmjow and Nelliel would be nice to make a little theme of there being a relationship between two of Ichigo's main friends of each race. Kinda leaves Uryuu as the odd one out, though... Meninas? She's the only one apparently still alive who isn't a child or transgender.  Sorry, I know I've gotten pretty off topic. If I discuss pairings I can't help but make sure they make sense in the grand scheme of things. Except for Ikkaku x Keigo."

It's not really incest and it's entirely possible Renji's a failure who won't ever reach the moon/star.

bleach,3cjjra,Jiscold,4,Wed Jul 8 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make a lot of sense in Ichigo's case, though. His child will have high-level blood from every race regardless of who he sleeps with, and there's no guarantee for example that if he has a child with Rukia that that child will choose to be a Shinigami, or will even awaken their Shinigami powers first.  I would think instead that his closest friends would act in his place. A child of two captains, a child of two Espadas, a child of two Fullbringers (or powerful humans if Orihime isn't one), and a child of two Sternritter is really just as good as children of one of each and a mutt of all.  I think Yuzu and Karin will be the ones to carry on the Kurosaki/Shiba lines. Ichigo's role is too important."
bleach,3cjjra,Andygoesrawr,0,Wed Jul 8 14:37:05 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that his child will have high level blood. It's that each race has a child with his inherent power. So no race is less then the other. This is assuming he becomes Soul King. And i don't think anyone will allow his specific lineage to die. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't Ichigo the only one with Hollow powers in the family ? Which if correct makes him the only ""perfect"" being we know of.  Your right that it doesn't make sense for him to have a wife, but I really don't see that happening as part of the story unless Ichigo dies. It's almost mandatory in this genre that the hero gets a girl even if they are oblivious."
bleach,3cjjra,Aaroniero,5,Wed Jul 8 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"Would that not create issues? There being four people with the same powers and potential as Ichigo, that is. If one or more of them rebels for some reason, the entire universe is at risk. I don't see it as being fair to all the races so much as creating a universal oligarchy under Ichigo's children.  Masaki was still killed for being impure after Ichigo was born, so I think only a portion was transferred to him, along with a connection between it and Isshin. Yuzu and Karin definitely have Hollow in them, otherwise their souls would've exploded on conception for lacking a balancing agent for Quinciness. Even with only a small portion of Hollow power that comes with being a Fullbringer, the Quincy soul would eventually destroy that and then the rest of the soul. An entire Hollow soul of an equal size would be required for real balance."
bleach,3cjjra,S0ulMadness,0,Wed Jul 8 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"I'm basing the idea that the decision would be made because time and time again lineage is brought up in bleach. That along with balance seem to have been followed since the beginning of the series. And people can say what they want about Kubo but he really sticks to his guns with his underlying elements.   And while the risk of having 4 ""King"" quality children would be dangerous it might also be a necessity, incase Something happens to Ichigo there will be a Heir.   i need to re-read that arc with Isshin and Masaki. We're either of them being suppressed after Ichigos birth but not before ? They really make Ichigo seem unique even though he has siblings."
bleach,3cjjra,dirtymindrebel,3,Wed Jul 8 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think lineage is all that important in Bleach. Isshin is the second-born son of his generation, Rukia is a random soul with no Kuchiki blood adopted into the family, etc.  I'll agree that a family name and/or blood of any thickness is important in some contexts, but that also means Yuzu and Karin are just as likely to be able to carry on their families' names and blood. I imagine Karin might elect to change her name to Shiba once she meets her cousins, and even though Yuzu isn't very spiritually powerful, she has just as much potential and would do well to carry on the Kurosaki name."

bleach,3cjjra,redditrandomacc,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"I strongly suggest reading the manga of SS arc. Most of Renji's pages have been cut for the anime, even degrading his role in the arc to a secondary if not almost third-row character. They tried to make up for that with scenes of him hitting on Rukia in the shiningami picture book, but it was not nearly enough. He showed her way more affection than Ichigo did, even if just because it was direct topic of love, instead of Ichigo's rather indirect approach.  While Ichigo himself doesn't give Orihime much of a notice, it is her that shows him far more love than Rukia."

And Ichigo and Rukia's relationship is extremely close, shown by the many scenes between them where they communicate with only their eyes.

Ichigo instead fights against the society as a whole, in hopes of saving it more than just Rukia herself   Renji's whole goal was to save Rukia while Ichigo was trying to save Rukia and fight against the Soul Society's code.  If saving Rukia was the only thing on his mind he wouldn't have stayed when he crashed the execution.

I like the pair, it's a side ship for me, but truth is, there are major problems between the two. It's only because of Ichigo's presence that Renji works to repair his relationship with Rukia. If Ichigo had never shown up, Renji would've just kept putting it off forever, because Renji never felt like he was good enough. He pushed her away, and wasn't there for her afterwards when she really needed support.  You're also reducing Renji by saying he learned bankai solely for Rukia. It wasn't his only reason - Renji also wanted to surpass Byakuya. As Renji says during their big Soul Society fight, it's been Renji's dream since they met at the shinigami academy. Byakuya was the epitome of power to Renji. In the ""stray dog that barks at the moon/star"" metaphor that Renji uses, Byakuya is the moon Renji wishes to reach, not Rukia."
bleach,3cjjra,assertiveguy,2,Thu Jul 9 02:41:18 2015 UTC,"It's only because of Ichigo's presence that Renji works to repair his relationship with Rukia.    This is not true.  He had been working 40 years to fix their relationship.  He couldn't speak to Rukia because she was a noble, Renji was just a lowly shinigami.  Their culture basically didn't allow them to interact.  Izuru himself said that she ""is in a completely different place from us"" and Renji knew/understood that.  In the month Rukia was gone Renji obtained his Vice-Captain status but during that time period the whole Ichigo/Ryouka invasion/SS-arc plot happened so he never got his chance to do what he wanted.     He pushed her away, and wasn't there for her afterwards when she really needed support.   Renji and Rukia grew up the Rukongai (Hanging Dog) district, a terrible place for children to grow up.  They have lived in poverty their entire lives and then Rukia had the chance to get the life they had always dreamed about.  He regretted it after the fact, obviously, but he didn't want to be selfish.     In the ""stray dog that barks at the moon/star"" metaphor that Renji uses, Byakuya is the moon Renji wishes to reach, not Rukia.   You're correct, Rukia is not the moon.  She is the star and Renji is the Stray Dog, even Renji says it himself.  He wants to reach Rukia and to him, defeating/surpassing Byakuya was his path to get what he wanted.

That is a hell of a long time to fix something which should not have broken in the first place. To be accurate, Renji got his promotion before Rukia left; Ikkaku and Momo even tell him to speak to Rukia immediately, before she leaves. Again, Renji defers, thinking he has time, losing his chance yet again.   Look at this from Rukia's point of view - they joined the academy together, but it's Renji who advances further and makes new friends, while Rukia remains isolated. Then the day of separation comes - Rukia is hesitant about accepting the adoption, and is taken aback by Renji's enthusiastic support. She doesn't know why Renji wants her to take it, because he never tells her. To her, what she sees is Renji giving up on her, on their friendship. Renji, the one who is ahead, won’t even fight for her. They've already started to drift apart, and this is the final break.  Sure, Renji spends the next several decades frantically working to be her social equal, regretting letting her go, but how is Rukia to know any of this? Neither of them talk to each other, thus Rukia suffers through the trauma of Kaien's death alone. She sinks into a downward spiral, believing herself unworthy. Unworthy of living, because she killed Kaien, her friend and mentor. Unworthy of the Kuchiki name, because of her inability to rise in the ranks. And lastly, unworthy of friendship, because Renji is the one who let her go."

Renji wanted to surpass him from jealousy, to be that kind of man in Rukia's eyes was his dream.  That's also a big point here: Renji's low self esteem and unworthiness came from the fact that Rukia was integrated into a royal family, meaning that society as a whole did not and could not see him as a worthy man of her anymore.

Ichigo showing Renji that he can indeed stand up to what he believes in, instead of what he's told to attempt is one of Ichigo's major victories and stepping stones of the arc.   It shows itself again during the arc whilst Renji does his best to defeat Byakuya himself, thinking of saving Rukia Ichigo instead fights against the society as a whole, in hopes of saving it more than just Rukia herself In the end it's not just Ichigo's resolve, but also his altruistic stance that proves him victorius by mere acknowledgment, rather than his power, where Renji's egoistic attempt at saving one he loves is given no prize, more than a compliment of present but lacking strength."

She does notice Ichigo's strength multiple times and is inspired by him, less so Renji, as that guy pretty much fails everything and just gets beat up by Byakuya, and then has her stolen by Aizen.   At the very end of Aizen-arc and at the end of Fullbring arc we also have scenes of Rukia with Ichigo, where she very, very loudly declares him a friend.   Then for non-cannon stuff, Renji does try a few approaches to her in shiningami picture book, but she doesn't notice him in either one of them.  Kubo just isn't really interested in romance. To be honest, ""Goodbye Halcon days"" and ""I dressed like a perverted cosplayer for you"" are the only two scenes in the series where the topic is 100% love-driven, unless I forgot something. I guess that's the biggest reason why we can easily argue on who should end up with whom."

bleach,3cdxdc,Andygoesrawr,2,Tue Jul 7 04:01:15 2015 UTC,I thought it was just the soul fragment that Yhwach gave to them that went back after death
bleach,3cdxdc,Dotifo,4,Tue Jul 7 04:16:53 2015 UTC,"That fragment is all an Echt Quincy is. Only Gemischt Quincies could survive having the fragment torn out of them.  That's why in the Auswaehlen 9 years ago there were survivors that were left completely powerless and dying, whereas the Auswaehlen Yhwach recently performed on the Echt Quincies killed those who didn't escape before the soul fragment was ripped out."
bleach,3cdxdc,Andygoesrawr,2,Tue Jul 7 04:20:29 2015 UTC,"That's kind of confusing because it sounds like an Echt Quincy's fragment is their whole soul, did they not have ""regular"" souls prior to getting the fragment?"
bleach,3cdxdc,Dotifo,2,Tue Jul 7 04:45:33 2015 UTC,"Powerless souls act like sponges. Asauchi are made from dead Shinigami souls, because once a Shinigami touches it it becomes consumed by the Zanpakutou spirit's soul, making it a Zanpakutou. The same principle applies for powerless human souls, which become entirely Hollow once encroachment ends and their Hollow powers appear and consume their soul. Likewise, the same would be true for Quincy powers.  It'd be different if Quincy powers were given to, say, a Fullbringer (or any spiritually powerful human). Their Quincy powers probably wouldn't consume their soul, and I'd say they would remain latent until awakened. They would essentially become Gemischt.  Seemingly the only way to get around the sponginess of powerless souls is for them to gain their other powers in the womb. The offspring of a Quincy and a powerless human doesn't result in an Echt Quincy, it results in a being who isn't quite Quincy and isn't quite human, yet they're both at the same time. They can gain Quincy powers, but if their Quincy soul fragment is taken from them then they're left with half a soul."
bleach,3cdxdc,Andygoesrawr,2,Tue Jul 7 04:56:09 2015 UTC,"Of course!  I was unclear if this applied to all Quincy (as indicated in the weird Yhwach-baby chapter) or if it simply applied to those Quincy who were subject to Auswhalen.  Something indicated to me that Yhwach only got back what he gave out and, while it might return to him stronger and thereby empower him, he was still limited to only the return of those powers he specifically handed out.  I was unsure if this logic extended to all quincy, or only those who were specifically granted their power by him."
bleach,3cdxdc,Andygoesrawr,3,Tue Jul 7 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"It would only apply to Echt Quincies. Once they receive powers, their entire soul is taken over by Yhwach's fragment. That's what makes them pure.  So when they die, their ""soul core"" goes back to Yhwach, but their spiritual body would remain and decay as it does for Shinigami.  For a Gemischt Quincy, they would just lose a fragment of their soul and their human soul would remain, albeit frail and damaged. It's pretty unlikely that a Quincy soul would be able to survive to the point of being sent to Soul Society by a Shinigami, in fact I would imagine their soul would die the instant their body fails due to the link between life force and Reiryoku (remember Ginjou telling Ichigo he would die for real if he died inside his human body? I imagine the Chain of Fate plays an important role in preventing a soul from having damage to the outer body mirrored onto it, which Quincies likely don't have). However, if a Shinigami kills a Gemischt Quincy who is still alive (using a Zanpakutou), I'd imagine they could be sent to Soul Society and live like any other soul there.  So a character like Rukia could've been a Gemischt Quincy in her previous life."
bleach,3cdxdc,ShiaLaBuff,0,Tue Jul 7 04:17:46 2015 UTC,About that... isn't Ichigo's chain of fate destroyed?
bleach,3cdxdc,Andygoesrawr,3,Tue Jul 7 07:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, hence why I theorise that the Chain of Fate is what prevents physical damage being mirrored onto the soul, going by Ginjou's comment that if Ichigo is killed in his human body then he will die, despite us knowing for a fact that if a non-spiritually powerful human is ""killed"", their soul is just separated from their body without any damage being carried over. Ichigo is spiritually powerful and therefore has no Chain of Fate, so if he's killed as a human then he's dead for real. (Unless he's killed by a Shinigami using a Zanpakutou...)  Otherwise there's no real reason for the Chain of Fate to exist at all."
bleach,3cdxdc,Vergil25,4,Tue Jul 7 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"I HAVE A THEORY! We know from the first few chapters/episodes, that when a quincy DESTROYS a hollow, the souls are irreversibly eradicated, but what if their not? How about, when a quincy destroys a hollow that soul gets absorbed by Ywach, instead of getting sent to Soul Society? That would explain the imbalance...  What if that duel between Ishida and Ichigo, was a clever plan to use hollow souls to reawaken Bach?"

Uryu is doing his part and Ryuuken is doing his part somewhere though, at the very least those two are working on something together.  Obviously the Sternritter knows he exists, and they would not ignore his existence while he is alive and out and about, so they got involved off-screen at one point, tried to recruit him, and he's either feinting death or they totally know he's hiding somewhere, because he definitely isn't a double agent as well, otherwise he'd be in on the attacks and stuff as well, but it's just Uryu.   They wouldn't just let him live and go on about his business though, because they know even if he doesn't outwardly show off his reiatsu, they know he has the Quincy powers, so something happened between them off screen, he disappeared to secretly carry out his part of the plan, and Uryu is working on setting things up for Ryuuken to finally do his part."

bleach,3cby2x,ShiaLaBuff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"Taking this further, Uryuu will say that he had to acquire the ultimate Quincy power to take on the ultimate Shinigami potential (Ichigo) to settle the war and give supremacy to one side. Ichigo will say something like ""You idiot, it doesn't have to be like this"". This will then either lead to an epic fight where Ichigo wins and saves his friend through the power of friendship, or Yahwehch is angered by Uryuu stepping away from the fight and taking power back. This leads to an Ichigo & Uryuu v. Yahwehch fight in which they defeat him...using the power of friendship."

And yea, it's been stated that Hash and Bach already know he's planning to betray him. Hash kinda thinks he can convince him through fear, and acknowledgement of what he originally planned to do, to instead just be subordinate to them, but Bach knows what he's going to do, that's why he doesn't even bother saying anything to him, like ""I know you wanna kill me cuz I screwed you over in the past, but I'll murder you and the whole rest of the world if you try."" because he knows, or thinks he knows, that no matter what anyone tries at this point they won't be able to stop him.

And Uryu simply joined up with plans to take Bach down.    But now it seems Bach's ascended without needing to sacrifice Uryu in some manner, so I'm not so sure why Uryu was a valued acquisition for Bach anymore.  Yhwach tapped Uryu as the successor for some reason.  Unknown powers of Uryu's or some strategery to pull the wool over the Sternritter flock and/or Uryu himself, and that made me think that Uryu really was important to Yhwach's plan.  Perhaps Uryu is sort of being used in the same way Orihime was in the Heuco Mundo Rescue sub-arc.  A chess piece to ensnare Ichgo later.  Regardless, I think that Uryu is stuck playing his role, and no quincys trust him, and both Bach and Haschwalth tower over him in strength, making a chance for Uryu to strike down Bach slim.  However Uryu is very smart, brave, and strategically minded, he may be just playing the role of a prisoner playing the role of a soldier, setting a trap in a long con."

It's a bit different when someone dies and is sent to Soul Society since their entire soul goes, but when someone dies in Soul Society and goes to the human realm, their spiritual body is left behind and only the core of their soul is taken, and probably wiped.  I'd say realistically their powerful souls would be separated into several souls of a set power (probably those little chii babies) before being wiped and sent to the human realm to be imprinted on by the souls of their parents."
bleach,3c6dif,Andygoesrawr,3,Sun Jul 5 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Hell butterflies are sucking up that excess reiatsu before they let the soul pass dimensions. Then transporting it where is needed (New houses for SS , SK's dinner ... etc ...)"

So I'm assuming the manga confirms that part somewhere. Does it ever mention what happens when that same soul dies on earth and comes back to SS?"
bleach,3c6dif,Andygoesrawr,10,Sun Jul 5 09:34:12 2015 UTC,"No, why would that matter? If a soul is ""bleached"" (( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) after death in Soul Society, they would be a completely different person in the human realm. If they then die and end up in Soul Society, they would still be that new person with abilities and an appearance based on their blood. Komamura's grandfather said that the only reason the Komamura clan were able to return to their previous form using the Human Transformation Technique is because they never actually died, they were just moved around the realms.  We're not explicitly told that the souls are stripped of their power, but logic dictates that they do at least lose their physical qualities. Kaien's speech to Rukia about the heart confirms that only the core spirit passes on, and the spiritual body (which is a soul in its own right) turns to pure Reishi."
bleach,3c6dif,ChaosKeeshond,4,Sun Jul 5 09:44:13 2015 UTC,"IIRC this was also cemented by the Fullbringers. They draw out and manipulate the soul of objects around them, but they do not strictly speaking manipulate reishi. Given that their powers hinge on the innate souls of an object and their powers continue to work in SS, then it stands to reason that the soul itself might be made of reishi, but not everything made of reishi is a soul... and that applies to both chairs and the bodies surrounding souls."
bleach,3c6dif,Jiscold,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:32:04 2015 UTC,Then what happened with Ichibe? He died then came back. Is there a time limit or can any soul be brought back to previous state if you know what to say ?
bleach,3c6dif,Andygoesrawr,4,Sun Jul 5 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"There's probably a time limit. Mayuri was also able to collect the bodies of dead Arrancars who weren't killed by being cut with a Zanpakutou and managed to stop their souls from separating from their spiritual bodies, so there's gotta be either a time limit from their death to when they're actually sent back into the cycle, or it might happen at a set time every day/week.  For Quincies, their souls remain in their bodies or float around in space until Yhwach sleeps. The Soul King apparently also sleeps sometimes, and we saw when he was sleeping that there were glowing orbs around him, possibly representing souls returning to him."

bleach,3c6dif,SputterNutter,5,Mon Jul 6 08:14:04 2015 UTC,"Well, an important part of any answer is whether there's a ""law of conservation of reiatsu"" in Bleach.  If reiatsu can just disappear, then I don't see a reason why it shouldn't.  The world would be easy to manage for SS if powerful souls' powers were erased when they left.  However, if reiatsu can't be created or destroyed, then I like Andy's theory that powerful beings are split into many different babies, to dilute their power.    Yama has lots of kids now."

So when they do die he gets his soul piece back and there spiritual powers so he can maintain the balance since it must require massive power.  The consistent way of increasing powers had been to add on another soul to your own. Hollowfication: injecting a soul into another soul. Hollow evolution: eating other souls and hollows. Quincy get schrifts from Yhwach. It would explain why Shinigami have Zanpakuto spirits since artificial souls are created from injecting foreign reiatsu into a soul."

Your skin colors are still unnatural looking, go for colors more like this over the more yellowish colors you mostly used. Look at some other colored chapters as reference material- just use the same or very similar colors as those. The colorgami get these pretty wrong fairly often too so don't worry. Get rid of as much grey as possible. This is your biggest problem as nearly every page has grey that shouldn't be there. On page 10 there should be no grey, Bazz's hair should be colored, and the face etc. Even if things are greyed out, it does not mean they are colored grey . As an example this when colored should look like this.

Kubo drew that image using a style that used flat colours, so for the hair he used a solid midtone (which for black hair is either blue, brown, or purple) with little to no shadows or highlights. Bazz is not the same as the others because in the manga he isn't drawn with black hair. Rukia is drawn with blue hair in several official colour pages, because sometimes the art style just doesn't use black in hair.  Besides, the eyes are the correct colour for every single character.

The best way to accurately isolate and preserve the original information in manga is to:  1) Invert the colours of the manga page layer  2) Copy it to the clipboard  3) Create a new layer and fill it in black  4) Create a new layer mask for the plain black layer  5) Hold ALT and left-click on the layer mask to directly edit it  6) Paste the inverted manga page into the layer mask  TADA!  Clean and true-to-source template.  To illustrate the difference, what you can see in this example is the typically used method is on the left, while my method is used on the right. The outlines are much cleaner with no unwanted grey artefacts and shading is properly preserved. The advantage of my method is particularly obvious around his arms.  http://imgur.com/C1DsQRq"
bleach,3c45hi,anubhavrana567,2,Sun Jul 5 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"well, everyone prefers their own way, what I did before was setting the main layer to ""Multiply"" then simply color on different layers but currently I'm setting the main layer transparent then use different layers to colour, when it comes to black or the outlines, I simply lock the layer transparency and then simply color over it.

bleach,3c45be,zerothousand,12,Sat Jul 4 16:27:08 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of debates on Renji's first appearance and first of all the anime was not 100% faithful to the manga.  First off, there was a reason he was a ""complete dick to Rukia"".  In a scene that was omitted from the anime, Byakuya and Renji were discussing their mission.  If Renji failed to 'capture her' Byakuya said that they would have to kill her.  Renji was also telling Rukia in the anime/manga that if she tried to help Ichigo she would make things worse for herself.  If he didn't care for her at all he wouldn't have said that.  Also, the anime omitted scenes that showed Renji and Rukia actually interacting.  I myself back in the day (like when Bleach aired on TV) didn't see the fuss or reason why Renji wanted to save Rukia, but when I decided to rewatch the show in college I also read the manga along side it and it made a lot more sense.  I don't know why these scenes were scrapped because anime-only watchers would be kinda confused.  Some of the major ones were:   this scene was trimmed down  90% of this scene  him being healed + talking to Hanataro/Rikichi.   There are other minor scenes that were cut though are not important such as Rukia's imminent death at Sokyoku Hill when she was thanking her friends.  In the anime they left out Renji.   All in all, the manga makes more sense than the anime."
bleach,3c45be,redditrandomacc,4,Sat Jul 4 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"I've brought this up before, another thing that really bothered me about that scene was how Rukia recognize Renji. She said ""You're... Abarai Renji!"" I mean what the hell, you're childhood friends. You should be saying ""Abarai! wat r u doin here"""
bleach,3c45be,COMPLIMENT-4-U,3,Sat Jul 4 21:08:24 2015 UTC,I thought Kubo was just trying to introduce Renji.  But either way it's up to interpretation and no definite answer.
bleach,3c45be,FishieSticks,2,Sat Jul 4 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"It could be because Renji was higher rank than her, being a vice captain (and they were in the presence of a captain). Honorific stuffs and all that with Japan."
bleach,3c45be,Plattbagarn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"It's a questionable scene, since she should recognize him. I chalk it up to a combination of Kubo needing to introduce Renji, Rukia not expecting Renji to be the one sent to take her back, and shock at seeing Renji as a vice captain (he got the promotion the day before she left for the World of the Living, and didn't tell her about it.)"
bleach,3c45be,SafferCrystal,3,Tue Jul 7 02:18:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like before Ichigo became a crucial person to them, everyone was a stick in the mud.   Also Rukia was his captain's sister. He probably admired the captain a lot, and here comes Rukia always taking his attention away."
bleach,3c45be,Nathan561,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, but I guess that kubo did not plan on the whole renji and rukia best friends thing back then since this was very early on the series."
bleach,3c45be,jaguark101,5,Sat Jul 4 17:00:16 2015 UTC,Renji and Byakuya showed up in chapter 51 and in chapter 59 it already shows Renji and Rukia doing their usual banter (read through the next few pages).  That's just an 8 chapter gap.  Kubo might have not had the whole thing fleshed out but it was still there.  Renji was trying to keep Rukia alive and make sure her sentence didn't get worse.

bleach,3c304n,Burgerburgerfred,3,Sat Jul 4 16:02:36 2015 UTC,It's probably one of the main downsides to Bleach.

bleach,3c304n,ShiaLaBuff,3,Sat Jul 4 17:59:31 2015 UTC,Like describing it to an onlooker after the fight is over or having people off to the side who are close to the person fighting explaining it to people who don't know how it works.  That usually does the trick.

bleach,3c2tfo,MrSterlock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think so too, but a very passive attack from Urahara perfectly nullified Ichigo's Getsuga. The only difference I can be completely sure if is the fact that Ichigo can charge up his Getsuga to reenforce his zan with a tonne of reiatsu without firing it off, as so far that's been unique to Ichigo.  Now I've thought about it, I'd have to say you're right. Urahara's attack might resemble Ichigo's usual run-of-the-mill Getsuga Tenshou, perhaps even in power, but Ichigo has total control over the shape, speed and direction of the attack, both before it's been released (as a blade enhancement) and even after it's left his blade.  It's more of a remote controlled batarang than a normal batarang."
bleach,3c2tfo,ChaosKeeshond,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"Also, it doesn't seem surprising that Urahara pulled that off, considering he was so much stronger at the time."
bleach,3c2tfo,MrSterlock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:05:24 2015 UTC,Shinigami can use special abilities with their sealed swords. They do not have to enter Shikai.
bleach,3c2tfo,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"Well, remember... A shinigami can release their shikai without a release word if they have mastered bankai. Going off that, we can assume a shinigami can say anything to release their shikai once they have bankai. Ichigo has never really been aware of his power and for all we know his actual bankai was given to him but he never knew how to release it. Therefore, him saying ""bankai"" actually released his shikai state because he already had bankai, it was just mixed up due to his misinformation.  This is just a theory though."
bleach,3c2wj9,69username69,7,Sat Jul 4 06:34:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Shibas are Quincy at all. They are definitely shinigami because how would you explain Isshin and Kaien?

bleach,3by9kb,69username69,91,Fri Jul 3 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'll say that reddit isn't really burning down. Sure, some might argue that it's been going downhill for a while and will likely continue until some drastic changes are made, but nothing is happening to the website itself. Reddit's been through major drama before and has come out fine, continuing to grow.  Some default subreddits and other larger subreddits are going down to protest the firing of Victoria, but this is temporary and will hopefully result in a stronger communication between admins and the moderators of larger subreddits.  That said, /r/bleach isn't affected by this. We have little to no contact with the admins, and the subreddit isn't large enough for a protest to have any effect. Furthermore, we're a niche subreddit where we're first and foremost a Bleach fansite, with the fact that we're a subreddit coming secondary to that. We don't really have any business getting involved in site-wide drama, and I personally don't see the point in making this community suffer for the sake of something which doesn't affect us.  I also don't agree with mods being the ones to impose a protest upon a community. The entire upset is because the admins abused their power to mess with the way a subreddit works, so I personally don't see how the moderators going and themselves abusing their powers to mess with the way subreddit works is going to solve anything.  This is all just my opinion alone. I don't know the opinions of the other mods, but I can say at this point that it's extremely unlikely that we're going to join the protest."
bleach,3by9kb,Jiscold,22,Fri Jul 3 06:14:10 2015 UTC,I think this is a good stance on the matter. But I also think this hurts our chances of getting a Kubo AMA >.>

bleach,3by9kb,pehp,3,Fri Jul 3 07:40:56 2015 UTC,"the reason the discussion is going on there is that we've been asking for more tools to do our jobs for a long time now and the recent firing is the straw that broke the camel's back   Part of a comment from one of the mods at r/tifu  The firing is just part of a bigger problem, one that affects all mods."

She refused to listen to her employers, and well, you know what happens when you do that anywhere else.  She was a nice girl, allegedly, but doing your job and not doing your job is pretty black and white.  I think it's good the admins didn't say why, that should never be public information anyway, unless she has to register as a sex offender, or she murdered someone, then the public has a right to know. It makes sense it would've all of a sudden caused an upset, it's not like they always have people ready to take over when someone all of a sudden gets fired.  Using the skills I learned in predicting bleach chapters and never getting a single theory wrong, ever, cough, I'm going to assume she tried to use her popularity and ""importance"" as leverage to authoritatively reject their new policies/ideas, and they were like ""Look, we warned you what would happen if you continued to defy us and we're tired of it. We're going to have to let you go.""  The first and foremost thing employers want, besides showing up to work on time, is to be subordinate to them, and not back-talk them, and not refuse to do work, and she broke that #2 rule. Not even the prettiest, nicest people are immune to breaking such a golden rule."
bleach,3by9kb,BaronRafiki,0,Sun Jul 5 06:37:42 2015 UTC,I don't think we should know why she was fired. I believe their reasons should not be made public unless there is a specific public cause. She is a living breathing human too and has the right to privacy.

bleach,3by9kb,welcometomoonside,-8,Fri Jul 3 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"Huh.... so they lose Victoria at /r/iama and all the high schoolers here think reddit is burning to the ground, okay. They set it to private temporarily people. Iama is mostly about people with some sort of fame or importance, they lost the person that runs the sub, and they're temporarily shutting it down until they get a new person in place and sort some things out. Oh no, the mod at /r/science wants to feel important and shut down that sub to protest for Victoria, big deal. Just a few defaults want to send a message to get Victoria back, that's it. It's no different than people massively sharing a god damn image macro on facebook.  That's it. That's all that's happening. What the hell makes anyone think /r/bleach is going to be affected by any of this? Do we EVER do AMAs here?"
bleach,3by9kb,ShiaLaBuff,5,Fri Jul 3 04:48:47 2015 UTC,"You're missing a lot of the key points. Victoria was an employee at Reddit, not just a volunteer mod. It's not too easy to say, ""Hey, uh, we fucked up but you can have your job back"" because there is a chance that, hey, maybe she might not want it back."
bleach,3by9kb,welcometomoonside,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:54:59 2015 UTC,"Or maybe they didn't fuck up, and she's the one that fucked up, and that is why she got fired. Yes, I know she was an employee, that is why I acknowledged that her employers fired her. And yea, I know she was all pretty and nice on the outside, but there are a million other things you never know about people. I had the hottest, nicest men and women at my work. Really cool with the other employees, but not good to the companies they worked for, and they got fired, and they deserved it, and if they just clean up their acts they'll find other jobs, and hopefully not be so stupid to fuck over their next employers.  Big deal, a new one will come in. Who cares if we don't get to do an AMA with one of the former writers from season 2 of Seinfeld, or some guy that works at Zappos, or the bass player from Fallout Boy? There will be millions more, who are far more interesting people, even if a few interesting ones got canceled, they'll be back; it's free publicity for them."
bleach,3by9kb,ShiaLaBuff,2,Fri Jul 3 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"It is irrelevant the cause of Victoria's release. The issue at hand is the fact that all the communities that relied on her were not notified. This causes problems that moderators, not admins, will have to clean up. It's this, along with a long history of moderators remaining unacknowledged by Reddit Inc that is the issue. Whether or not Victoria deserved to be fired remains to be seen. However, the issue at hand is the fact that Reddit was extremely unprofessional about announcing her departure and basically shot themselves in the foot.   Listen, you should read the /r/outoftheloop thread, at least the parent post, because it seems that you aren't quite aware of what's going on. No, reddit might not be burning to the ground, but this is pretty important stuff for a lot of users on this website."
bleach,3by9kb,welcometomoonside,0,Fri Jul 3 06:34:39 2015 UTC,"I read the post, that is why I made my post after. When someone on the inside gets fired, what makes you think they're going to announce it to anyone? Who EVER does that except friends of the person that got fired speaking out to the media or something? It's what happens.  And I read an update, she outright refused to do her job that they were paying her to do. Pretty cut and dry."
bleach,3by9kb,ShiaLaBuff,2,Fri Jul 3 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"Link to the update?   Fact of the matter is /r/iama is one of reddit's most lucrative subreddits. Ridiculous amount of ad exposure there as well as probably more gold being bought there than anywhere else. It is extremely inconsiderate for Reddit to make a decision like this without somehow allowing /r/iama's mods to prepare for the consequences, which of course, affect them more than they will affect Reddit Inc. At the very least, Reddit should have seen the consequences of this coming."

bleach,3bzxqb,richiegraine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"Since we just learned about these rare Quincy I can't say much about Ichigo specifically.  When you look at her power it resembles Schrift power more than anything. She wants to protect others and doesn't want to see anyone get hurt. This could be representative of Ichigo's driving force to save his friends as well.  Schrifts are aspects of one's soul so if Ichigo is capable of such a thing it would make sense for Orihime's power to fall under that category. If he's a descendant of Yhwach, who is in turn a descendant of the Soul King, it's not that far out there to say he can bestow reality altering power to someone.  This is of course assuming Ichigo is capable of such a thing and is one of these rare Quincy. There isn't enough information yet."

bleach,3bzxqb,richiegraine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:47:33 2015 UTC,But what was being suggested instead the growing of power but of Inoue being given power. When I say that I mean like how Bazz was as I am assuming given his fire abilities by Juha which he didn't have before.

bleach,3bwbb4,KillerAdvice,20,Thu Jul 2 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"We could put the mechanic explained in the latest chapter like this: Haschwald wasn't creating new power in Bazz-B - he was drawing out the possibility that already existed within him.  It does sound awfully similar to the hogyoku when put that way.  This dovetails nicely with what I've been thinking about the original impetus for the hogyoku's creation.  That Urahara wanted to create an artificial Soul King - one that could serve the role, without requiring someone to be imprisoned in a crystal.  If the Soul King is simply a Quincy capable of this Giving/Sharing mechanic, and that mechanic is being taken advantage of to ""regulate"" the flow of souls through the various worlds, then to replicate that functionality artificially would require the creation of an artificial Quincy soul.  That Aizen needed to ""feed"" souls (or parts of souls) to his hogyoku starts making sense.  That was the ""taking"" part of the equation.  What we've been seeing as the ""probability manipulation"" mechanic the hogyoku provides could in fact be the ""giving"" part of the equation.  This is a fun theory.  I rather like it."
bleach,3bwbb4,yukeake,6,Thu Jul 2 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"And that's why Aizen wanted the Hogyoku. He had power, but he wanted the people around him to also have power. Fusing with the Hogyoku meant that he would never again be alone, because he'd always have powerful beings beside him."

bleach,3bwbb4,chaosattractor,3,Fri Jul 3 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an interesting idea, especially since niether urahara or Aisen actually states that it is the mix between a soul reaper and a hollow but that it has the power to ""was the answer to controlling the boundary between soul reapers and hollows"" as well as manifest the desires of those around it."
bleach,3bwbb4,ABashfulTurnip,5,Thu Jul 2 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Aizen states that Urahara's idea of what the Hogyoku did was wrong. Urahara wanted to make his friends (Hirako, others) Shinigami again and so it manifested what he truly wanted. In the same way that it did for Aizen with making the Arrancar.

bleach,3bwbb4,oetsuthebest,4,Thu Jul 2 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, I meant that his uniform and general body is blinding white, in contrast to the Shinigami's black uniforms that they all wear"

bleach,3bwbb4,seratheanos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:35:27 2015 UTC,The reason why aizen was white had more to do with white being the color of death in the Japanese culture. And he looked more like the hollow he created that attacked masaki.
bleach,3bwbb4,reigun91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:58:42 2015 UTC,"So, Urahara may be pretty wicked, eh?  In creating the Hogyoku.. he didn't just collect souls, but he may have ""experimented"" on a quincy in order to make this work.  Of course this is just conjecture, but that would be pretty awesome."

bleach,3bul6s,Andygoesrawr,78,Thu Jul 2 07:29:28 2015 UTC,Poor Bazz Bae. These feels are going to last all week.
bleach,3bul6s,madeofspiders,48,Thu Jul 2 07:34:40 2015 UTC,":(, just the look in their eyes man.  First Jugo was sad and Bazz was giving him the death stare when they were children.  But now in the present their roles are switched, Bazz looks solemn while Jugo is giving him the look. It's almost as if Bazz hesitated.."
bleach,3bul6s,redditrandomacc,24,Thu Jul 2 08:29:23 2015 UTC,Bazz did hesitate and I think the angle of the catch being the same implies he didn't want to kill his friend.
bleach,3bul6s,EnragedMoose,5,Thu Jul 2 11:16:06 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who feels this friendship is hollow?  I mean, Bazz gave Jugo the death stare because his friend was chosen, and then again when he realized his friend was special, not him.  Shitty friend if you ask me."
bleach,3bul6s,docmedic,10,Thu Jul 2 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"Eh. It seemed more like he was upset because his whole life turned upside down. He figured they'd go in all togther, that they'd kill Yhwach together, and if they couldn't and it had to be one of them alone, he'd be the one to go in. And then he finds out that he was never worth anything to begin with... and now Yhwach is taking away his friend."
bleach,3bul6s,HetzerHetzesHetzly,3,Fri Jul 3 05:04:03 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. He was so jealous of his friend that he couldn't even be happy for him, not even for a possibility to fulfill their revenge plan. Makes you think that he only wanted to be friends with someone weaker than him and couldn't ever accept a thought that Jugo could be better. Remember how he gave Haschwalth his button making Jugo his 'follower', I think that case demonstrated his way of thought very well. And he showed his jealousy and irritation to Haschwalth at the same very moment when Jugram actually needed his support the most, standing before the emperor he turned around to Bazz for a help and didn't know what to do. And what he got in return from his friend? An aggressive look, while Haschwalth hasn't even done anything bad to him. Whereas Haschwalth acted very generously and selflessly even in that situation, he understood Bazz B's anger and asked for him to be appointed instead. I bet Bazz has never even understood that Haschwalth didn't want to take a revenge for his dead uncle and probably was grateful for that fire. Or he didn't think of it at all, being such an egoist. And now he is calling Haschwath a traitor, funny because it was actually Bazz himself who ruined their friendship with his envy and inability to understand his friend and be happy for him if he is better than Bazz."
bleach,3bul6s,fairbrooks,22,Sat Jul 4 06:18:23 2015 UTC,Kubo's art style has evolved and gotten so much better since the beginning. It's downright masterful at this point.
bleach,3bul6s,ElModeloEnPace,19,Thu Jul 2 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Go read Bleach's pilot chapter. It's so shitty.  Now check it now. Better than all big shonen manga, and ridiculously good compared to many others taking pride in their art."
bleach,3bul6s,angryspacemahreen,10,Thu Jul 2 17:43:25 2015 UTC,This sub come up with the best nicknames
bleach,3bul6s,FatGuyOnline,191,Thu Jul 2 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"So I am going to assume that Ichigo in a sense is like Haschwalth, because back when Orihime awakened her powers, her shun shun rika stated that ichigo was the reason that they were born. I know that Aizen said it had to do with the hogyoku, I assume that the truth lies somewhere in between."
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,89,Thu Jul 2 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"A bunch of people around him also started being aware of the spirit world simply because of his presence.  He also took way more of Rukia's power than she initially intended to impart to him, probably because of the taking aspect of his quincy power.  He has also been shown to have issues with mastering abilities on his own, but others around him grow strong quickly around him."
bleach,3bul6s,TeTrodoToxin4,47,Thu Jul 2 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"That is one of the things that have always stuck in the back of my mind, because it was clearly stated very early on that Ichigo was the result of such things happening. And you are right, he still doesn't know how to control his reiatsu, and probably couldn't use any regular techniques. Again, explains why Yhwach didn't kill him, and seemed to still be trying recruit him, even after he made Ichigo cut down the soul king."
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,16,Thu Jul 2 09:44:01 2015 UTC,Would explain Renji gaining bankai after his clash with Ichigo
bleach,3bul6s,MrFahrenheit39,17,Thu Jul 2 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Not just after the clash. Renji trained with Ichigo, or at least in the same room as him, to get his bankai. He finished way before Ichigo too."
bleach,3bul6s,Coranis,7,Thu Jul 2 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Also it seems that Orihime's hairpins have changed as well, after Ichigo of course got a power up."
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,3,Thu Jul 2 09:51:01 2015 UTC,she did train before she went to hueco mundo and in this arc and her powers are based on her confidence or something like that so who knows maybe shes good now
bleach,3bul6s,jewuis,2,Sat Jul 4 02:03:17 2015 UTC,But as ichigo has grown stronger so have hers and chads powers.
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,65,Sun Jul 5 20:00:23 2015 UTC,This seems pretty plausible to me!
bleach,3bul6s,29thspirit,49,Thu Jul 2 07:46:18 2015 UTC,Urahara also stated to Chad and Orihime both had their powers awaken because of Ichigo.
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,21,Thu Jul 2 07:48:46 2015 UTC,"So basically they are like the quincy, only with even more types of power mixed in?"
bleach,3bul6s,osba,29,Thu Jul 2 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"Well, Chad's a Fullbringer according to the Xcution arc, not a quincy."
bleach,3bul6s,osba,8,Thu Jul 2 14:08:11 2015 UTC,Yes; that is indeed what Chad thought.
bleach,3bul6s,SCDarkSoul,11,Thu Jul 2 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"Well, his power became more powerful in Hueco Mundo(True form of Brazo Derecha de Gigante, and the power of Brazo Izquierda del Diablo), but Quincies and Hollows both completely hate each other."
bleach,3bul6s,Neknoh,4,Thu Jul 2 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"Hueco Mundo is filled with reishi, and in reishi rich environments Quincy become more powerful..."

bleach,3bul6s,FoxyZach,36,Thu Jul 2 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"Dear Mother of God...not only that, but Ichigo has always been about protecting others..... Both of Chad's and Orihime's powers developed more rapidly when the desire to protect those around them was extreme... Orihime with Tatsuki, and Chad with Karin... They could both be fullbringers, but Ichigo accelerated that growth; much like Haschwalth's did for Bazz-B. He didn't gift Bazz new powers, his presence just helped him hone it."
bleach,3bul6s,ludicrouscuriosity,8,Thu Jul 2 08:31:56 2015 UTC,Watch Ichigo become like Ywach and steal his almighty ability.
bleach,3bul6s,Cheesemacher,18,Thu Jul 2 16:20:36 2015 UTC,"Well, if that's true so that story of Haschwalt and Bazz-B happened at least 200 years ago, so Ichigo could be that special kind of quincy"
bleach,3bul6s,zetaxero,4,Thu Jul 2 10:03:09 2015 UTC,"To be precise, the story happened 1000 years ago."
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,2,Thu Jul 2 16:05:20 2015 UTC,1000 / 200 = 5.   5 War potentials?! coincidence? probably....

bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,34,Thu Jul 2 18:17:04 2015 UTC,Plot twist it was Ishida who awakened their powers since he has the same power as yhwach and haschwalth
bleach,3bul6s,wowy-lied,4,Thu Jul 2 12:31:54 2015 UTC,"Except that he isn't, Yhwach said his powers surpassed his. Also, Uryu can use simple Quincy techniques."

bleach,3bul6s,kuroisekai,7,Thu Jul 2 11:20:54 2015 UTC,"What is the next step, hell power ?   Have you seen the (admittedly non-canon) movies?"
bleach,3bul6s,tsubasaxiii,4,Thu Jul 2 17:35:18 2015 UTC,nah... we've been speculating that for years now.
bleach,3bul6s,TheKingofMusk,2,Thu Jul 2 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"We can actually get more specific than that even. He is a Quincy by blood and fullbringer by circumstance. His father was a powerful shingami and while that doesn't mean his is a shinigami because of that fact he does follow after his father and take up the same profession. The hollow that attacked his mom left traces of itself in her and thus traces in ichigo which was later refined when reforging his swords. His quincy powers, may or may not be like A's abilities, but also went into the forging and thus we now have two swords. If the current t theory is true than he is a rare form of quincy, and rare form of fullbringer, all together making him also a rare form of shinigami both in the sense that he duelwields and that nothing like him has ever existed before.   I think people to often confuse him for a shinigami Quincy hybrid when really he is a quincy fullbringer/hollow hybrid."
bleach,3bul6s,caramel-bear,8,Thu Jul 2 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"I like your idea.   Is there any possible relationship with Ginjo? Ginjo also had the power to steal powers for his own. Ichigo developed powers with him relatively quickly, although that could be discounted simply as Ichigo being special.  What if Fullbringers were just a bastardized group of Quincy who didn't understand their powers or origins?  The Fullbring powers being weak would then sorta tie in with the theme Kubo established, that understanding your powers and origins is important to utilizing them. For example, learning your Zanpukutos name, or Ichigo understanding his past, or stolen powers not being as useful to the thief as the original owner.  Although as a counterargument for myself, maybe Ginjo doesn't necessarily have the ability to steal powers, but knowingly exploited Ichigo's ability to give powers. Basically, Ichigo gave up his powers but didn't believe he was willfully doing so? Seems more farfetched."
bleach,3bul6s,TheKingofMusk,2,Thu Jul 2 12:31:18 2015 UTC,I don't know about the FB being a bastardized group of quincies because aren't Fullbringers regular people who had their mother's attacked by a Hollow and therefore the powers transferred to the children which Hollows are poisonous to Quincies/Quincys? That would be my only argument for that. Then again Ichigo is basically every race in the Bleach world maybe you have to be mixed like he is?
bleach,3bul6s,abittman,3,Thu Jul 2 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right in that was the original explanation, what I'm suggesting is the possibility that Kubo may retcon. I guess I should explain my choice of words, ""bastardized."" What I meant was, they were Quincies that were somehow separated from other Quincies and never educated on their abilities.  So they discovered their abilities on their own, and came up with their own theory as to how they originated."
bleach,3bul6s,Ziazan,8,Thu Jul 2 18:55:53 2015 UTC,I was coming into this thread to see if someone else had the same thing I'd thought of.

bleach,3bul6s,MrSterlock,54,Sat Jul 4 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"The burn was strong in this chapter. The moment Haschwalth had that safe look in his eyes, and accepted Yhwach instead of Bazz... oh boy, did Bazz explode.  So when Haschwalth's uncle was touching abusing his cute little Jugo, the uncle was stealing Haschwalth's powers, getting stronger, and abusing him still? D:  Bazz-B was always able to form his Quincy bow even before he met Haschwalth though, and he may boast but he really does have talent, I think he'd grow stronger even without taking power from Haschwalth.   Great chapter, a good stab-and-twist to the feels.  EDIT: Also, I realise Bazz's glare not only conveyed his exact thoughts to his friend - utter disbelief, but it was a look unsettling enough to remind Haschwalth of his powerlessness, belittling him much like his late uncle constantly did. The next page, Haschwalth is completely defensive, clutching his arm like it is wounded again, as if reverting to his vulnerable childhood state of mind, feeling as if he should be weak. Bazz, his only friend, managed to make him feel useless and alone once more.   And when Yhwach intervenes and slowly explains what the two of them are, Haschwalth slowly lowers his arm, his fear melting away. ""I need you with me."". Did Bazz even say that much to his friend?  Kubo is a master at body language and semantics, and he is just getting better.  If Haschwalth really did lend his powers to Bazz, does that mean he can take them back, now that Bazz has ""cultivated"" them quite nicely? (EDIT: Reread the chap, Haschwalth can only give and not take, so this probably won't happen.)"
bleach,3bul6s,MrSterlock,14,Thu Jul 2 07:50:48 2015 UTC,And with every stroke his Uncle became stronger  stroking intensifies

bleach,3bul6s,viatoretvenus,11,Thu Jul 2 14:11:39 2015 UTC,I... I don't know.
bleach,3bul6s,feezaks,4,Thu Jul 2 15:08:35 2015 UTC,"D:  That's the scary thing... the more his uncle had abused Haschwalth, the stronger the uncle would get, and the harsher the abuse would be, with Haschwalth having no idea how to escape it."
bleach,3bul6s,viatoretvenus,6,Thu Jul 2 15:24:06 2015 UTC,nice analysis!
bleach,3bul6s,richiegraine,3,Thu Jul 2 14:05:46 2015 UTC,Thank you :D
bleach,3bul6s,viatoretvenus,3,Thu Jul 2 15:21:56 2015 UTC,I love this analysis and I like how you emphasized the major mistake Bazz made with Jugo. I know it kinda looks like Jugo betrayed Bazz but I think it was the other way around. Bazz kept him around but definitely didn't see him as an equal and was more than willing to leave him behind if he saw the need. Bazz's pride was hurt but Jugo was hurt more by the fact Bazz was furious at him over something he couldn't control instead of just being happy one of them made it. And that panel of Jugo catching Bazz's bolt was awesome. And RIP to all of Bazz's pride.
bleach,3bul6s,richiegraine,4,Thu Jul 2 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yes Bazz did betray Haschwalth. Haschwalth truly treasured their friendship; he didn't want to upset his only friend, didn't want to be on bad terms and receive that glare from him, and so to pacify Bazz, Haschwalth quickly gave up the treasured position he was offered by the great Yhwach, to his friend who truly wants it. Only then, only when Hasch recognises Bazz as being the ""better choice"", do we see Bazz's look change, as if Bazz finally recognises his old friend again, the familiar friend who is weaker compared to him, and who recognises Bazz's ability.  Bazz's pride and thirst for revenge on Yhwach was stronger than his respect for Haschwalth. Bazz didn't reciprocate his friendship with Haschwalth very well. When Bazz loses Haschwalth to Yhwach, he has nothing that he can say to pull his friend back to his side. Haschwalth doesn't have a reason greater than Yhwach to continue being with Bazz, who didn't appreciate him equally. The relieved look in Haschwalth's eyes, reserved only for Bazz thus far, will from now onwards be directed to Yhwach instead. That guts me."
bleach,3bul6s,godhaspurpledreads,2,Thu Jul 2 20:14:15 2015 UTC,This just makes me like Jugo more. And explains why he is so important to Juha. And I still think it's hilarious how Bazz was the talented one and was so sure he would get picked as he is laying on the ground like all the other weaklings and Jugo gets picked and his whole world comes crashing down and to top it off his first attempt to kill the one who literally burned his life and family away is stopped by the one who was supposed to just stay in his shadow and be his support. And it almost seemed like Jugo knew he was the reason Bazz was getting stronger and kind of accepted his role as sidekick support.

Perhaps he realized, that Bazz wasn't strong enough to take on Yhwach? So he shielded Yhwach to further gain his trust and later make a (realistic) attempt himself?"
bleach,3bul6s,reigun91,34,Thu Jul 2 09:00:40 2015 UTC,That might be similar to why Ishida did the same in the SK palace.
bleach,3bul6s,out-for-delivery,9,Thu Jul 2 07:43:53 2015 UTC,Exactly my thought! But then why would Hashbrown be so suspicious towards Uryuu?
bleach,3bul6s,Vlaid,26,Thu Jul 2 07:47:55 2015 UTC,"Because he has a power that can surpass that of Yhwach, it makes sense to be suspicious of someone like that. Not to mention, that he knew the actual intentions of Uryu when he first arrived."
bleach,3bul6s,viatoretvenus,14,Thu Jul 2 07:50:55 2015 UTC,Because the way Uryuu got picked reminds him of the way he got picked and his intentions at the time.

bleach,3bul6s,29thspirit,8,Thu Jul 2 10:09:06 2015 UTC,Maybe that is the point where Yhwach transferred some of his powers to Haschwalth?
bleach,3bul6s,Iniura,10,Thu Jul 2 08:28:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think Yhwach can consciously control whether or not he gives off power by touching someone. I agree that's probably the point at which Haschwalth gained ""real"" Quincy powers, hence his ability to catch Bazz's bolt."

The real question would be , did he mind control Hashchwalth right there and then?

bleach,3bul6s,tyler7988569,4,Thu Jul 2 11:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is, but it's not something he consciously does. When someone touches him, they gain a piece of his soul. The only way he was able to control it was by creating a more powerful method, using his blood."

bleach,3bul6s,potcorn,11,Thu Jul 2 09:16:39 2015 UTC,He recruited Uryu who also has a reason to kill him. Maybe Yhwach is a bad judge of character.
bleach,3bul6s,redditrandomacc,18,Thu Jul 2 10:31:35 2015 UTC,"He does it for shits n' giggles. He knows all too well that no matter how hard they try, they can't kill him."
bleach,3bul6s,genesin,26,Thu Jul 2 10:46:12 2015 UTC,"I had a realization after reading your comment, he did say he can ""take back the power after it's cultivated"", so it would actually make sense to give power to people who want to kill him because they'd be extra motivated to increase their power, and he can just take them back the improved powers later. Forgive me Ywach for I doubted the logic of the moustache."

bleach,3bul6s,ElModeloEnPace,9,Thu Jul 2 17:53:34 2015 UTC,So I guess that makes Uryu a better version of Haschwalth? Yhwach did name him as his successor for a reason.  Is it possible that both Ichigo and Uryu have this special Quincy ability? We know Ichigo and Uryu have been mentioned as darkness and light respectively but I'm not sure if that has any correlation to this.
bleach,3bul6s,SuperBigMak,12,Thu Jul 2 07:57:01 2015 UTC,"It\s more likely to be a Ywach equals Uryu, Haschwalth equals Ichigo/thing."

bleach,3bul6s,H4xolotl,3,Thu Jul 2 08:52:01 2015 UTC,That incident happened during the night right? Bazz B sash Hashbrowns gets Ywachs powers during the night. Maybe he got his ability to take away abilities and that's what he did.

bleach,3bul6s,HomelessBoxBoy,5,Thu Jul 2 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"Well, Hashbrowns has the B Schrift, and hasn't it been shown that Uryu could do the things that Yhwach just said that people like them couldn't do? There has to be something different about Uryu, and it could have something to do with the Kurosakis, as Ichigo, despite also being a dirty-blooded Quincy, also didn't appear to succumb to the Auswahlen 9 years ago. Ichigo could've survived due to White, but wouldn't the Hollow's influence have protected Masaki from the Selection, since White made her also qualify as impure despite being a pure Quincy?  I'm confident there's something else about Yhwach and the Quincy that we don't know about. Slight Hollow influence freed the bankai from the Sternritter, so if Ichigo could survive the Auswahlen due to White, Masaki should have as well, and her Blut Vene shouldn't have disappeared. Thus, that means Ichigo could have survived for a similar, it not the same reason as Ishida.  I once thought the ""giving"" bit of Yhwach's ability was unique to him, but if Quincy that have trouble gathering the reishi could indicate being a Giver-type, then it's possible Ichigo could be one. Just look at the characters he's spent the most time around, they've grown and improved the most when compared to others that haven't."

bleach,3bul6s,kingofdabz,3,Thu Jul 2 11:31:30 2015 UTC,"Her powers were stolen, resulting in her death, but she was presumably much stronger than Katagiri, a true Gemischt, and presumably could have sustained herself w/ White or Isshin without collapsing like Katagiri"
bleach,3bul6s,welcometomoonside,4,Thu Jul 2 08:28:04 2015 UTC,The poster above you is correct. No powers led to GF killing her.  Her immunity to losing them with white was gone once Ichigo was born who also had some of Isshins power as well.
bleach,3bul6s,ydna_eissua,13,Thu Jul 2 08:53:09 2015 UTC,Did Ichigos power grow thanks to uryuu whenever he was around him?
bleach,3bul6s,Redm1st,9,Thu Jul 2 09:05:41 2015 UTC,"Good point. Not that we know of, but Ichigo didn't spend day and night training alongside him for 5 years either."
bleach,3bul6s,ydna_eissua,4,Thu Jul 2 07:41:14 2015 UTC,"It would only affect his Quincy powers anyway, which were dormant until this arc. So it's impossible to tell if his Quincy power level ever increased."
bleach,3bul6s,PakiIronman,2,Thu Jul 2 07:46:13 2015 UTC,"I mean he could have had pockets of growth whenever he did have chances of being around uryuu, could still all support the theory, really interesting stuff"
bleach,3bul6s,CRAEREASDW,3,Thu Jul 2 11:11:43 2015 UTC,"If i remember right, that was the first time getsuga tensho was used."
bleach,3bul6s,jns701,3,Thu Jul 2 07:51:29 2015 UTC,I was thinking this could explain the power within all of Ichigo's friends.  Only not because of Uryuu but because of OMZ inside Ichigo influencing the souls around him
bleach,3bul6s,prisN,2,Thu Jul 2 08:20:07 2015 UTC,Shouldn't OMZ be like inside every quincy?
bleach,3bul6s,Reddude37,2,Thu Jul 2 08:20:11 2015 UTC,Honestly that's a really good question.  My guess is while all Quincy have OMZ power within but only Shinigami have inner worlds.  Which may be a per-requisite for that power to coalesce and take a cognitive form
bleach,3bul6s,damngurl,9,Thu Jul 2 09:34:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see anything in OMZ but a combination of Isshin and Yhwach. He's gotta be the result of the Quincy powers and Shinigami powers combining to create a corporeal form. If he's only the Quincy powers, I wish Kubo would've shown Yhwach as having full stubble 1,000 years ago, not just the moustache. It's like Yhwach is physically incapable of growing a beard, whereas Isshin is incapable of growing a moustache.  Isshin's beard stubble + Yhwach's moustache stubble = OMZ's beard and moustache stubble. It all makes sense."
bleach,3bul6s,Alluka-,2,Thu Jul 2 09:51:26 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, no wonder why he was able to take out that menos. Aside from the first arcs they haven't really fought together though, if you think about it. Except when he fought ulqi"
bleach,3bul6s,staticccc,2,Thu Jul 2 11:08:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe Uryu received power from Ichigo since they were babies, leaving Ichigo with no Quincy powers.  Maybe Uryu drained power from his mother for months after the selection leading to her demise. This is why his relationship with his father is strained.  Maybe Karin and to a lesser extent Yuzu are Ichigo's Jugo, battery packs for his excess power.  Maybe Ichigo receives power and prayer from all his allies to defeat Bach. They will chant his name to give him strength or maybe even sing Number One. Queen of the Scene vs Quincy King  Maybe Yhwach will be finished off when he is double teamed by Uryu and Ichigo. Ichigo will stand at Uryu's rear and pour all of his power into his sword. Uryu will take said sword from behind and feel Ichigo's strength well up inside, causing his bow to expand many times its original length. Uryu will then rain his arrows of white onto Yhwach, shooting them into his hair and eyes until he is absolutely drenched with Uryu's reishi. All three combatants completely spent, Jugo will then enter the fray to capitalize on Ichigo and Uryu's exhaustion. However, Ichigo and Uryu are able to work together to dominate Jugo as they did Yhwach, leaving him in the same drained state as his master. Then Aizen comes, having freed himself from his bondage, to challenge our champions as well. Bazz-B takes advantage of the new battle to finger take out his feelings on Jugo's unconscious form.  Edit: I'm serious about that last one. http://www.mangapanda.com/94-503-9/bleach/chapter-49.html"

bleach,3bul6s,FishieSticks,7,Fri Jul 3 00:53:45 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Bazz was a normal Quincy who had his basic powers. When the two first met they were pretty young so it's probably more of an ego thing. Skip ahead 5 years having trained together and Bazz's power grew faster than a normal Quincy's would. That's where Haschwalth comes in.
bleach,3bul6s,kingofdabz,4,Thu Jul 2 08:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understood that, but still Bazz was talented for his age, so I don´t think calling him like that was called for."
bleach,3bul6s,Lewke,9,Thu Jul 2 09:08:08 2015 UTC,"I think a separation between power and skill is necessary there. Bazz was highly skilled, but was weak until he started hanging around Haschwalth and his power levels increased over time."
bleach,3bul6s,staticccc,2,Thu Jul 2 09:19:51 2015 UTC,"a kid who can make his own Heilig Bogen doesn't really makes him a genius, maybe a genius among his aged Quincies because he said no one can do that except for him."
bleach,3bul6s,JAUS314,2,Thu Jul 2 11:14:56 2015 UTC,Well that is like saying Gin and Toshiro weren't geniuses because they were simply doing the same stuff normal soul reapers do. Bazz was talented for his age but Jugo just sped up the process of adding power to the skill as I understand it.

bleach,3bx088,ProfCereal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:58:35 2015 UTC,im losing sleep so far its been 3 days and ive watched 60 episodes i finish school next week I would have probably watched atleast the next 150 by then !! also i am confused at why aizen killed momo
bleach,3bx088,ProfCereal,3,Thu Jul 2 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"When I started I would average 15 episodes a day while still being in school lol, however I would recommend to pace yourself because you are gonna be left wanting more when you finally finish it. I just recently caught up with the manga and I can tell you it sucks waiting a week for a reading that only takes like 3 minutes, as opposed to watching 3 hours of  animated glory every day.     Form my experiences, all your questions are usually answered in the next few following episodes. If you still have questions after you finish one of the arcs you can always come back here and ask. But be sure to specify what episode you left off on so no one spoils anything for you"

A couple of things though:   We know so little about Aizen's current abilities, he could have a frikkin rinnegan under that eyepatch for all we know Another thing we don't know (but have speculated about) is how much of Aizen's ""defeat"" was legit and how much of it was keikaku. Pretty sure there will be some sort of plot device to enable Yhwach's defeat. Aizen is a candidate. But you know.. shounen manga etc etc, unless Yhwach gets Black Zetsu'd or something, it'll be Ichigo who actually finishes the job."
bleach,3bwwsq,shiba_keikaku,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"Regarding Aizen's ""defeat""  Gin isn't dead either. It was keikaku. Shinsō will destroy chair-sama in a flash of white.  Also Gin did the same thing as Black Zetsu."

bleach,3bwwsq,Ziazan,4,Sat Jul 4 15:03:10 2015 UTC,"Well whenever someone asks what/who is the ""best"", that basically translates to ""favorite.""  Personally, I enjoy Yhwach, but we really need a full backstory on him, something that we are probably guaranteed not to get until the very end of the series (i.e. before Ichigo kills/defeats him, in classic Kubo/Shonen fashion). He is extremely powerful and intimidating, but at times seems a bit two dimensional.   I think his downfall, as with many villains before him, will be his arrogance and overconfidence in his abilities (ahem Aizen). That being said, I actually think it would be cool for him to ""come to the light"" and maybe even be forgiven and spared by Ichigo and the others. Maybe he could do something like what Nagato does in Naruto and sacrifice his life to bring back soul society and restore everything to how it once was.  Aizen on the other hand isn't necessarily better, just different. He is an unusual villain (some even think that he isn't really even a true ""villain""), and is more of the passive-aggressive, sit in the corner and wait for the right moment-type of guy who employs his ""plans"" and genius intellect more than his muscle to do the bulk of his work.   I personally still find Aizen more fascinating than Yhwach, but they both share that same emotionless grin that reeks of plodding and selfishness.  As for who is stronger? Who knows. I think that if they fought it would be pretty even. Only time and the almighty Plotkai will tell...."
bleach,3bwwsq,rickEbobby,0,Thu Jul 2 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"As for who is stronger? Who knows. I think that if they fought it would be pretty even.   This is true, but Aizen is far more intelligent and has had the experience of his own hubris bringing him down and he will not let that happen again. Ywach's hubris is what will get him killed in the end. I can guarantee it."
bleach,3bwwsq,ShiitakeTheMushroom,0,Fri Jul 3 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with you there. Intelligence aside, if it came down to pure strength I think Yhwach is innately stronger, but like you said, when it comes to Aizen, intellect and strategy is always a factor."
bleach,3bwwsq,rickEbobby,2,Fri Jul 3 02:44:57 2015 UTC,Aizen for the win
bleach,3bwwsq,jk1988,2,Thu Jul 2 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"Aizen is such a wild card at this point it's hard to tell. We have urahara saying Aizen's hado 90 without incantation was stronger than it was while he was in his final form with incantation. It's also been shown that he can mess with yhwach's perception of time slightly, but as for now we don't really know if that's because of him having fused with the hougyoku, become one with KS or a mix of the two. I would stand to reason he's not stronger than yhwach at the moment as we've seen yhwach take down ichibei with relative ease once his almighty was activated and after absorbing the arm of the soul king he seems to be at a whole different level. Also it seems like ichigo would be the one to beat yhwach (shounen logic) rather than aizen but they could still fight or he may help ichigo if it furthers his plan. In terms of ""best"" I think aizen was the better and cooler villain even if he's not the ultimate bad guy of the manga."

bleach,3bwrrr,rickEbobby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"If we assume the RG are really going to the bad guys' side (which kind of seems like a widely accepted theory around here) I'd like to see:  (oh, and I'm assuming they fight them before they reach the Sternritter's HQ)  Ichigo vs. Ichibei  They kind of formed a connection, and it'd be nice to see the Head of the Shinigami fighting against the protagonist. To be quite honest though, I think this would be the least likely of the match ups I'm writing about here.  Renji vs. Nimaiya  Since they trained together I think it'd be nice in terms of character development. Besides they both kind of share the ""would be a delinquent in RL"" trait. Oh and they both have a ""villainy"" side.  Senjuumaru vs. Kyouraku  In a 2012 interview Kubo said Kyouraku's pink haori's history would be revealed. Since Senjuumaru kind of has a close relation to sewing and that sort of things, I'd love to see that both of them have some kind of backstory together. Lots of potential corny jokes, tears and battle action. Maybe -full rambling mode activated- they were in love at some point and the haori is some kind of memento of their relationship. And now, they must face each other all because of the duties they have. One with the Soul King, the other with Soul Society and the Gotei 13. (I think I made myself shed a tear with just the thought of one dying in the arms of the other)  Kirinji vs. Byakuya  Some sort of raw vs classy stubornness. And a water vs Senbonzakura's blades battle would come with some amazing panels and some sort of equal footing in terms of their powers' characteristics.  Hikifune vs. Rukia  Rukia's bankai kind of represents death. Well.... in fact she kinda is the #1 shinigami (the one Kubo designed first). It'd be interesting to see this life vs death battle.  I know some are far fetched... maybe all of them. I wasn't really trying to elaborate a theory here, I just spit out the ones I think I'd find interesting. :D"

bleach,3btqwu,hangemhigh420,36,Thu Jul 2 02:04:08 2015 UTC,It's just speculation because he's a very popular character. Editors are known for making mangaka change things in their stories. It's sad but true.

bleach,3btqwu,maytagem,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:22:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that's because him surviving makes absolutely no sense based on his dialogue. Based on his dialogue he absolutely knew he was as good as dead. Why else would he ask Ichigo to handle everything... especially if he was going to immediately come back and get his own revenge. It makes no sense.   Besides I prefer to believe Kubo isn't such a shit writer that he would bring back a character to do absolutely nothing but save Rukia for no reason. Think about it. You remove Byakuya from the story and Rukia has to save herself (which makes for a slightly better fight and her Bankai doesn't piss me off as much) and literally nothing else changes. What impact has he had on the story? What's his general purpose at this point? It's terrible writing to bring him back

bleach,3btqwu,Cykon,7,Fri Jul 3 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"This is my view as well.  Reading through that scene - it's incredibly powerful, and brings Byakuya's character arc to a fitting end.  From scoffing at and disregarding Ichigo as someone who could never possibly amount to anything, to entrusting him with everything he stood for.  I can't imagine that scene being written in that way as anything other than a death scene.  Having him come back makes for some cool art, but decreases the power that scene holds, as well as Rukia's own character development, IMHO.  As for the ""real story"" I doubt we'll ever find out.  Regardless of how we may feel about it, he came back, and that's that."
bleach,3btqwu,assertiveguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:39:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel like when he came back to save Rukia during her fight with As Nodt, it was a bit of a slap in the face to her, because it came off as ""Hold on, lil sis, lemme give you a hand because you aren't strong enough yet to beat a main enemy by yourself.""

And, like some other, I'd prefer if he died, it was such a powerful scene... just like Yamamoto dying while standing was a confirmation of his own life, Byakuya dying while asking Ichigo for help would be the negation of his own life, but in name of a greater good. As Nodt and Mask fights would be more meaningful. And, frankly, Byakuya hasn't done much this arc, he only kills guys offscreen or complains about freeing Aizen. Most of the time, it's like he's not even there."
bleach,3btqwu,rickEbobby,4,Thu Jul 2 09:58:20 2015 UTC,"How do editors of popular series force hands though?  Just basing this on American issues, but generally the problem is, once the beast gets large enough the creative side has almost unlimited power.  I mean, Is Jump not going to print Bleach because Kubo wants Byakuya out?  Is there some cultural difference that makes this more meaningful?  I could see the pressure on a secondary series, but Bleach feels very much like a main driver for Jump at this point."
bleach,3btqwu,unitedpath,2,Thu Jul 2 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"Bleach has been dropping in popularity for a long time, constantly in the bottom tier of Jump rankings, so it probably doesn't have as much talking power as other popular mangas like One Piece or Hunter X Hunter. The reason it wasn't axed was mostly because the volumes sold well."
bleach,3btqwu,rickEbobby,3,Thu Jul 2 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jump would have ever considered axing Bleach, especially since when it was decreasing in popularity it was already around volume 50. If a series lasts that long, the author should just earn the right to finish it in the fashion they want, regardless of length or popularity."
bleach,3btqwu,sora677,3,Thu Jul 2 09:11:44 2015 UTC,"It's still one of the top selling Manga and the Jump popularity poll doesn't seem like a really methodical way of determining actual popularity...  Still, I was shocked to see that its sales had fallen that dramatically over the last few years.  While those numbers don't necessarily indicate a series capable of making bold demands, it still seems like Jump is better off with it than without it."
bleach,3btqwu,HomelessBoxBoy,3,Thu Jul 2 14:56:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think Bleach is a bit underappreciated, or underestimated, in that regard. Think of all the kids who may just be starting the series and buying the volumes from #1. Regardless of what people think, it still has to be making a decent chunk of change for Jump."
bleach,3btqwu,justintoronto,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"It isn't a main driver. Just look at the rankings. I like bleach but it isn't good to fool yourself, in the rankings it is usually quite low."
bleach,3btqwu,mavgeek,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"Byakuya surviving is just bad writing, editor influence or not. His begging Ichigo to protect SS, and his worrying about Rukia and Renji in his ""final moments"" are a perfect show of how his character development has ended. He is a complete character, there's nothing left for him to do besides slash people.  His death would have given Ichigo, Rukia and Renji the chance to develop even further, as Rukia and Renji seem to have been eclipsed by Byakuya, despite them both being more important to both Ichigo and the story."
bleach,3btqwu,kingofdabz,4,Thu Jul 2 09:07:43 2015 UTC,"I feel that it was a powerful scene, but at the time I was thinking ""Why would you kill him off like this?"" It was a shocker for me when I read it. It made a lot more sense when he came back afterward, I imagine Kubo wrote it as such because it was the death of his pride and sword.   So far when a character dies in Bleach, there is a huge sense of purpose that they have fulfilled. In this arc, all Byakuya did was get completely broken and lose his pride, which is extremely good character development but imo not worthy of a death. There was no turning point or cataclysmic result from it either, which we have some clear examples of that with other characters.  Basically I do feel the finality of his fight with As Nodt was a little heavy handed and left too much to ambiguity, but no I do not believe Byakuya should or would have died in this way."
bleach,3btqwu,PACIFICRIM_JOBS,5,Thu Jul 2 08:34:39 2015 UTC,"Even if he didn't die, it was his best scene in the entire manga / anime. Said it before but for years I always felt his character was..kind of a pompous ass, letting his position and royal background drive his personality. I can understand his position about letting Rukia die in the SS arc, I wouldn't have done that but I can understand it. But the way he's always treated Ichigo as some petty outsider despite his desire to save people, defend people, putting other people before himself, and being equally on par as a Captain level.. I hated how he never considered Ichigo an equal. So that one scene, that one panel where he is broken, not just physically but emotionally, broken as a man that he has to turn to the one person he dislikes the most and in tears, beg for his help... He earned some points from me on that day. I hope he see's it as a chance to evaluate his attitude towards Ichigo, and other people, learn from it and better himself."
bleach,3btqwu,SW9876,2,Thu Jul 2 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I mean, within the story, the soul king asked for these people to go up to the soul palace with them, he had a list of people including renji AND byakuya. http://mangafreak.me/read1/bleach/517/15  If byakuya was going to die, then so was Renji. And if people say byakuya should have died then I say renji should have too and I don't think the editors get to make that many big calls in kubos own Manga, honestly...people are assuming,  there is no interview anywhere that signifies what they say is true. That link up there is the in-canon explanation, and that's what I'll take. I mean look at the end game bosses they're supposed to be facing right now, even WITH byakuya people are saying it's unbalanced..lol so I find it very believable that byakuya was always meant to live because there's just way more evidence towards that than the other argument. It's like denying science, saying he was meant to die. But they cannot deny the will of the soul king."
bleach,3btqwu,Sandisk4gb4,-1,Thu Jul 2 11:45:33 2015 UTC,"That was written afterwards though so it doesn't prove if the original intention was for byakuya to die or not.  Also,   renji was in far better shape than byakuya. Byakuya literally looked like death and everything in that scene screamed death flag. So the fact that the soul king summoned then seemed like a cop out. But who knows."
bleach,3btqwu,SW9876,3,Thu Jul 2 05:37:24 2015 UTC,It would make sense. If Byakuya had died then I would have comepletely stopped caring about bleach.

Actually I'm pretty sure that it can be a canon story :P. I was dreaming about Coyote Starrk when he was a human. I know, crazy right? His life before he split his soul. He was living near sea, and he was a fisherman. He had his own crew and was a leader-type person, and always easy going. Its kinda logical he would act that way because Coyote was lazy and Lilynette was trying to be the boss. Anyway it was a good dream, I really want to see all Espadas, or even all Shinigamis (those who were human at start) in their human form, and what were they doing before they died.

Somehow Ichigo and co were all where they are now -in the Soul King's palace- and the Elite Sternritter were beating the shit out of them. Ichigo in particular was being beaten badly. For some reason I find myself opening a Senkaimon right above the battle. I jump, land on the ground and everyone is staring at me. It turns out I pulled an ""Amagai taichou"" and became the new captain of I don't remember which division. I'd be happy to continue the story but, sadly, I attacked someone and before I even got a chance to test my bankai I woke up.

bleach,3bv1p6,HatoriHanzoSteel,6,Thu Jul 2 11:30:09 2015 UTC,"The flashback is from 1000 years + ago , not 200 .  Rare quincy's are also giver's not only takers . If someone was to invent / discover the Schrifts that would be Yhwach since he's atleast 200 years more experienced with the Giving part of the quincy  abilities than the closest candidate (HashW) .  List of rare quincy's that may posses the same ability:  Ywach ; HashW; Uryu; Ichigo.  It may work in the same way as a Orochimaru-Sasuke relationship."
bleach,3bv1p6,Jedy_hacker,2,Thu Jul 2 11:37:35 2015 UTC,"At first, Haschwald could not take back powers. However, a soul fragment from Yhwach would quickly fix that.  So, it's likely that Haschwald has now learned to take away powers and soul fragments.   Which explains why he acts as emperor in Yhwach's stead. He can steal powers and exert control over the Stern Ritter the same way Yhwach does."
bleach,3bv1p6,Fearless-Fairness,2,Thu Jul 2 11:34:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think his shrift will be anything other than Balance.  There was some very clear imagery earlier on when he exerted his power, which manifested as a giant set of scales.  This ""giving/taking"" power he has is likely separate, but still ""special"" in that he's ""like"" Yhwach, and a rarity amongst Quincy."
bleach,3bvhr0,Haroooo,6,Thu Jul 2 14:14:31 2015 UTC,That's Haschwalth. They're just little flashback panels from last week's chapter.
bleach,3btkbw,ruminaui,17,Thu Jul 2 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"It's set just over 1,000 years ago in the human realm...  Kubo hasn't explicitly said it, but it's pretty easy to figure out. Yhwach was sealed for 1,000 years, and until now he's been entirely inside the Schatten Bereich, leaving for only 5 minutes at a time, and only in the past 9 years. So if we're seeing him in the human realm, it's obviously over 1,000 years ago. Bazz and Jugram aged like regular humans until they entered the Schatten Bereich, which means the flashbacks can be no more than 1,015 years ago.  So there you go. It's set in the Kingdom of Germany / the Holy Roman Empire, 1,005-1,010 years ago (at the current point in the flashbacks)."
bleach,3btkbw,Andygoesrawr,9,Thu Jul 2 01:16:35 2015 UTC,Soul Society has no reason to interfere with Yhwach while he's conquering countries in the human realm.
bleach,3btkbw,Alluka-,3,Thu Jul 2 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"I suppose they would if he (and his army) were using Quincy powers to fight their battles. That would destroy souls and cause an imbalance; if Soul Society was still set up in that manner 1000+ years ago.   Either way, based on Yhwach's comments about wanting to conquer Soul Society... It seems like he was paranoid, or knew they would eventually want to stop him."
bleach,3btkbw,Vlaid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:54:06 2015 UTC,You have a point but I'd like to believe SS would've intervened earlier if that were the case.  I think Yhwach was on a power trip and wanted to invade SS because he could. It's still unclear what his motives are so we can't say for sure.
bleach,3btkbw,Alluka-,4,Thu Jul 2 02:05:37 2015 UTC,Clearly he heard that Soul Society has some world class booty.
bleach,3btkbw,Vlaid,0,Thu Jul 2 06:30:46 2015 UTC,"Well according to prior plot stuff, he wants to control ALL the realms, not just the earth realm. He's like Shao Khan. He is exactly like Shao Khan, in every way  I always loved that scene, it was like the actor himself was trying not to laugh because of how he looks when he talks through that mask."
bleach,3btkbw,ShiaLaBuff,4,Thu Jul 2 03:20:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, a very interesting theory. Also Hueco Mundo may became a wasteland after Yama has used his bankai in that realm. We know that he has burnt down all the Quincy army in the past. I also think that this flashback may take place in the world of the living, but before shinigami created the SK and the balance of souls, meaning before the separation of SS from the living world. So there is no boundary between them now, that's why everybody knows about the Soul Society."

bleach,3btoyi,LupusetVulpus,10,Thu Jul 2 01:46:19 2015 UTC,"Aizen calling the cloaks 'gifts' was likely just him being a dick. He either stole the tech or found extras Urahara had to leave behind.  I think that look from Urahara had more to do with Masaki being a Quincy yet he sensed Hollow reiatsu in her and he was understandably confused/worried.  In the end, I think Urahara just wants to keep some sort of balance. He doesn't want the worlds to fall into chaos. But he also has some morals, and would try every other option before going with something reprehensible."

Putting the hogyoku into Rukia, and her into a gigai that would eventually leech her power away, in order to make the hogyoku inert, just as an example.  And this is how I believe he and Ichigo will eventually come into conflict.    Ichigo wants to protect everyone.  He wants a super-happy everyone-is-okay ending.  He's not going to accept ""We'll save the world(s), but at a cost"".  Unless that cost is him, of course, because he's the self-sacrificing sort."
bleach,3btoyi,yukeake,7,Thu Jul 2 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"You were on the right track until you said he wants the power for himself. I think it has a lot to do with him wanting to be able to replace the Soul King with another being. Aizen is honestly, probably trying to do the same thing since he helped also with Ichigo's evolution. Ichigo could have been killed multiple times by both of these people. Urahara is definitely hiding some sort of idea from everyone, but he is not evil."

bleach,3brzev,RyuzakiZaibatsu,5,Thu Jul 2 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"Probably. I think novels in general are a lot less popular in Japan (try reading a Japanese novel, they're nightmarish), especially when it could be read in manga form instead. Novelisations of anything are fairly unpopular all over the world too, as far as I know."
bleach,3brzev,Andygoesrawr,3,Thu Jul 2 00:38:29 2015 UTC,"Andy, could you please explain what makes reading a Japanese novel so nightmarish? My understanding of books in Japan is that literature is mostly restricted to ""classics"" (which are dense and difficult to comprehend) and that it's not a prevalent or modern industry, and books are huge in the US, so what's the deal?"
bleach,3brzev,TIHNK,2,Thu Jul 2 04:22:41 2015 UTC,"Huh, I was under the impression that light novel are fairly popular in Japan, popular enough to get anime adaptation to further advertise them. Amagi Brilliant Park, Strike the Blood, Nyaruko, SAO, etc.. all started from LN."
bleach,3brzev,AbareKiller,2,Thu Jul 2 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"They're fairly popular, but I don't think they're anywhere near as popular as English novels. Plus, they're a different type of novel. Light novels are targeted at teenagers, so they're a lot shorter, have simple dialogue and language in general, usually use first-person, and often include a lot of images. They're basically manga with a lot more text. Classic novels are usually convoluted and hard to read, especially when written in third person using neutral language."

I would call that a huge generalization that really doesn't fit even the majority of LNs I've read. The only difference between a regular novel and a Light Novel in definition is the fact that LNs tend to use simpler and easier to read kanji in comparison to regular novels which can require one to always have a dictionary in hand when reading (like you actually mentioned in your comment before)."

bleach,3brzev,Seraki,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:39 2015 UTC,"The main issue I see is the extremely varied novel length you suggest.  I mean, perhaps break up some of your 700+ page books into two parts.  Either that or redraw the boundaries to fit good cliffhangers that even out the lengths of the novels.  (I.e. The first book could end right before Ichigo fights Kenpachi as opposed to right after Rukia getting kidnapped).    I can't speak for Japanese audiences, but usually in an English book series we don't see such a large jump in length.    It would be a cool change of pace though, I really like the idea."
bleach,3brzev,potcorn,2,Wed Jul 1 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you're saying. Main reason I laid it out like that was to accommodate the arcs themselves so that each book had a cliffhanger in a way (leaving the reader wondering what is next) but also giving closure to the events at hand for the time being. I figured if this were to actually happen, we may only get one book per year."

No way, buddy. Something was wrong with Ichigo, the man I loved so much that I secretly hoped that black-haired midget in the kimono would've been executed so that we could be together. Really though: Fuck that tsundere bitch. All it takes is for her to get herself tied to some railroad tracks/kidnapped by gangsters/shit-rocked by that frigid bitch she hangs out with and he just forgets all about Orihime Orange-blossom Princess/Santen Keshuun Paladin Bubble Master Inoue, (the one that saves his ass on a daily basis when he gets himself beaten up by the local alley cat, or killed- like that one time in Mexico) and goes running away to some other dimension to save her, for which his only reward is her PMS'ing all over his face every single fucking time.

bleach,3brlln,redditrandomacc,5,Wed Jul 1 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"I've always been a big defender of the dub for Bleach. I dig it, but everyone's opinions are different. It's what I watched first, but I've also watched it in Japanese and I enjoyed both. I think there are some characters and scenes that are better in English, some are better in Japanese, some are about the same, some are terrible in both, etc. Oh the whole, I really don't think you're doing yourself a disservice by watching it in English. Both languages are pretty well done. I love JYB as Ichigo. I really feel like he fit Ichigo better than Masakazu Morita."

bleach,3brlln,arukaen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Bleach in fact has one of the most impressive and amazing seiyuu lineups of them all. If you make a list of the 20 best seiyuu I'd bet at least 15 had a role in Bleach at some point.   It's not just about names though.... their performances are  just amazing. Aizen, Kenpachi, Ichigo, Byakuya, the Espada.... it's just perfect. The guy who did the casting is a goddamn genius."
bleach,3brlln,gummychaos,2,Wed Jul 1 19:27:32 2015 UTC,Aizen is amazing in Japanese. One of the voices I think was better in Japanese. How gutteral and crazy he gets in the final fight with Ichigo is just out of this world... far superior to the English version.

It's the same principle with certain rappers... I can very well admit that, say, Rakim is a better rapper and lyricist than Busta Rhymes, but I'd rather listen to the latter any day because I like his voice and style more.  EDIT: Oh, I will say that the way Morita said ""BANKAI!"" in the fight with Ginjo straight up gave me chills. JYB certainly didn't do it justice. They're both pretty great at saying, ""GETSUGAAAAA...

bleach,3brlln,reigun91,2,Wed Jul 1 18:46:12 2015 UTC,"In the world of anime nothing is really cancelled. People have waited for different anime for years, decades in some cases. Bleach hasn't been doing great in the weekly rankings, but the sales per volume are quite solid. I think that, rather than profitability, what they're waiting for is to have enough material to end it in one go so they don't let the manga catch up with the anime.  About the dubs, I don't really like them either (sorry :(  ). I've lived abroad a few times and I'm lucky enough to be able to speak more than one language. Because of that, I've watched anime in several dubs and the general rule is that Japanese is always better than any other. I think romance languages are better suited for dubs since they have a more ""aggressive"" and sharp pronunciation, which makes them more similar to Japanese. I have seen quite good dubs in Italian and in Latin Spanish.  My thoughts are the English dub in anime has three major issues. (1) Not enough critical mass as of yet. The English Dubs are still in general quite amateurish, even with the better known voice actors. This is kind of a matter of time and experience so it's not really something to be really worried about. (2) Too many literary liberties. I've always hated that almost pathological obsession with changing the techniques' names or trying to -poorly- translate things. In my opinion the more faithful they remain to the original work the better. And (3) the last one is pronunciation. They should try to pronounce Japanese words as a Japanese would. At least to some reasonable extent. English and Japanese are so different in phonetic terms it just sounds really weird. It comes off like.... I don't know.... maybe ""forced""."
bleach,3brlln,gummychaos,3,Wed Jul 1 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"I get it, man. I dislike Clannad's dub too (general reception to it seems pretty positive) and something that I just couldn't get over was how they pronounced Nagisa's (main character) name. In the Japanese, it's NAH-gi-SAH (I think, if I'm conveying the syllable stresses correctly). In the English version, they said nuh-GEESE-uh, and it was just really bizarre."
bleach,3brlln,TIHNK,2,Thu Jul 2 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"The English dub is shweet. I agree some voice actors in some moments were really wacky, but it actually does an awesome job in portraying comedy or emotional content in a lot of scenes.

bleach,3bpc49,oetsuthebest,3,Thu Jul 2 05:48:48 2015 UTC,"I think the flashback will continue, with Yhwach building his original Sternritter and Jugram growing accustomed to his new role as Yhwach's ""other half.""   Now that my sensible, half-stolen-from-other-comments prediction is out of the way, I honestly think this is the beginning of a ""TBTP2"" arc. We're getting a peak at the origin of the Sternritter and already seeing the early machinations of their initial invasion of Soul Society... So I'm really hoping this will also give us a look at the original Gotei 13 as well as why/how Yamamoto failed to kill Yhwach the first time around."

When mayuri says he failed to kill that man , he was clearly talking about yhwach . Yama didnt even consider jugram when he battled the fake , as he didnt even know who he was . Plus i even doubt jugram was present in that battle as he didnt recognise the form of yama's bankai"
bleach,3bo2ws,Plattbagarn,2,Tue Jun 30 23:51:24 2015 UTC,Perhaps Haschwalt is the key for Yhwach to get his powers back?

bleach,3bo2ws,Fearless-Fairness,6,Wed Jul 1 11:05:45 2015 UTC,"Haschwald was probably a man by the time he joined the Stern Ritter and fought Soul Society.   For Yhwach, there would not be much reason to bring Haschwald to war with them if he was a child with incomplete powers."

I don't even get the whole point of the ""you reek of semen"" thing that Yumichika told her/him/it/whatever.   Giselle is a succubus. She accomplished blood magic and necromancy using her bodily fluids.  In ancient times, semen was simply believed to be a form of blood. All bodily fluids were believed to obtain the soul or psychic energy of their original owner.  So, Kubo isn't clearly trying to indicate whether Giselle is a boy or girl. He's simply providing a little easter egg hint about the mythological roots of her powers.   Yumichika and Charlotte made fun of her for the way she smelled, but that doesn't conclusively tell us that she's a trap. Really, she could have just been stealing semen from Hitsugaya's corpse so that she had a sample of his body fluids with which to zombify him. She also zombified Rose and Kensei.  So, whatever weird sex thing she's been doing with her zombies, she did it with Hitsugaya, Rose, and Kensei before coming to fight Yumichika and Ikkaku."

They're in the middle of a war, it's sad but the Shinigami don't have time for that.  After the threat is dealt it with would be a better time.   STILL PISSED that Byakuya was virtually brought back from the dead.   I like Byakuya and he's a cool character but his ""death"" was perfect.  It also could have been used to strengthen Rukia and Renji's character development by making them the ones to take out his killers (As Nodt and Mask).    What in the hell is Giselle?   Pretty sure it is a trap.   Oh, and thank you Kubo (and editors <3) for off-screening the entire royal guard (minus Ichibei)   It's most likely because we will see them again and Kubo didn't want to reveal their powers.  That's my guess, I think they are somehow going to have to serve the new Soul King (Ywach) and fight our protagonists."

bleach,3bojb6,redditrandomacc,5,Tue Jun 30 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"Well for instance, Renji 'surpassing' Byakuya.  I had always liked that little side plot but I couldn't see him becoming stronger than Byakuya in a timely manner and at this point it is not feasible for him because of the Soul Palace power ups.  If Byakuya died and if Mask was defeated by Renji, he could have 'surpassed' Byakuya.  As for Rukia she could be 'acknowledged' by him by defeating As Nodt.  He wouldn't have been there himself but that'd be the whole point, she can stand on her own now.  It was kind of annoying when he stepped in, yes Rukia should have had that much trouble with As Nodt, but that's a different topic and I digress.    Anyways that's how I would have written it, Renji and Rukia could have dealt with Byakuya's loss and had an inner monologue of like 'we will protect Soul Society for you, so don't worry' or something cliché like that."

One of those characters who you start off hating, and develop a massive appreciation for. But I kind of agree, after seeing him survive, I was pissed. The death was drawn so well, it had the emotion of other Shounen that sometimes escapes Bleach, and Kubo takes it away that quick? I still like Byakuya, because he's a badass, but his death would've been an incredible plot point for Rukia, Renji and Ichigo after returning from the Soul Palace."
bleach,3bojb6,potcorn,3,Wed Jul 1 10:11:07 2015 UTC,"I agree 100 percent. Byakuya is one of the few characters in this series who had come ""full circle"" so to speak. We start off loathing the guy, and then once he is humbled by Ichigo, we start to like him because we realize he is really a good guy who is just full of pain and sadness. And then to top it off, he ends up laying his life down for Soul Society and as his dying wish, asks the guy who he once was enemies with to save Soul Society. It was very poetic and well-written, especially for Kubo. Like you said, those moments that really hit hard emotionally are few and far between in this series, but when they happen, they sure are good"
bleach,3bojb6,oetsuthebest,7,Wed Jul 1 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but did we even see Izuru's body after he got one shot by Bazz? While it's not confirmed if he's actually dead or not I'd like to think he is. I'm sure we will get a mention of him eventually or see him again if he's somehow still alive.  Agreed on the Byakuya point. It would've been a huge loss for the Shinigami and his ""death"" was so poetic. It's a shame really.  I think Giselle is actually a girl but has her way with men after she turns them into zombies. She could be a trap though, who knows at this point.  I truly believe the RG are not dead.

The con of reading from the beginning is that it will take you a couple of days before you are caught up. The pro would be that you would the ""uncut"" version of the story.

bleach,3bpvx8,izn1337,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:05:22 2015 UTC,"Pros in reading from beginning: * Get to know everything in detail, unlike the anime. * There's no filler arc or characters included in the manga so enjoy 100% canon material. * You can see major and minor differences between the original manga and the anime because they've ""cut"" or ""censored"" lots of scenes in the anime. * Reading manga would be so much better if you've only watched the English dubbed version of the anime. (In dub, ""original"" translation is NOT used at all, they make up most of the things which makes it really stupid, heck even Ichigo doesn't even says Tensa Zangetsu after going Bankai in dub)    Cons in reading from beginning: There's no con with manga, maybe the only downside would be (if you haven't read any other manga before) it's without colours and it's sometime hard to figure out what's going on the fight.      Suggestions for Manga: The site I recommend for reading manga is KissManga.com because you can just select Reading type to ""All Pages"" so you won't have to bother clicking arrows to move to the next page plus from chapter 475 they've MangaStream scans. Currently, Once you complete all the chapters to the latest, MangaPanda is the first one to upload latest chapters and MangaStream takes a day or two.

bleach,3bmuln,Kaiyonx,10,Wed Jul 1 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"Considering The Almighty wasn't awakened until Yhwach's fight with Ichibei, my opinion would be 'no'.   That said, Yhwach also had time to analyze Yama-jii's bankai's abilities, while Yama-jii so graciously explained them all in his fight with Yhwach's fake. Due to that, and possible interference from Hashbrowns, it may have been a closer fight and Yhwach may have had other things up his sleeve in order to beat Yama-jii.   All-in-all, though, I think that the lack of The Almighty would ultimately cause Yhwach to lose, if he were unable to steal Yama-jii's bankai."
bleach,3bmuln,Tynarus,8,Tue Jun 30 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yhwach's fight with Ichibei is an interesting occurrence.  There isn't a rational explanation for Ichibei losing: He had performed his version of Bankai and renamed Yhwach, which should have stripped down his spiritual power to nothing.  It leaves two possibilities to me:  (1)  Kubo is a bad writer and OP'ed Ichibei only to then demonstrate how monsterously OP'd Yhwach himself is.  totally a possibility, although Kubo seems better about this than most.  (2) Yhwach's naming ability is a part of his nature.  Which is to say, Yhwach would be able to rename himself, and others, with zero effort.  His spiritual power has nothing to do with it.    If we accept the possibility, then Ichibei's best efforts were always going to be essentially useless to defeat Yhwach because Yhwach basically represents just a more perfect version of Ichibei.    Yhwach mentions that even with his incomplete power he was able to see that far and take appropriate action.  To me, this indicates that Yhwach did not see a world in which the Sternritter were able to defeat Yama's bankai once he had no reason to hold back on it.  Therefore, Yhwach developed a method to temporarily nullify it.    The interesting thing, is the entire plan must have been undertaken to capture Yama's bankai, which dispells the concept that it could have just been convenient.  As Yhwach noted, most of the sternritter were actually impaired by having to keep the Bankai abilities around.  Additionally, given that they were just crushing the Captains even before taking their Bankai's the whole exercise seems pointless - unless we accept that Yhwach accepted defeat as, at the minimum, a distinct possibility.  given how well Yhwach's ability worked against Ichibei, and how fearless it made him of ichibei, this chain of thought leads me, at least, to the inevitable conclusion that not only could Yama have beaten Yhwach, but Yhwach was certain that he would."

bleach,3bmuln,Driffed,17,Thu Jul 2 02:16:05 2015 UTC,"If Yhwach feared Yamamoto 1000 years back (and 1000 years back, Yama-jii's Bankai was weaker than it is now, according to Yama-jii himself), then I'm quite sure, with or without Yhwach having The Almighty, Yama-jii would have won.  We know that even Ichibei lost to The Almighty, but Ichibei's powers are more clever than brute force. Besides, Ichibei wasn't shown with a devastating reiatsu the way Yama-jii or Kenpachi have been shown. And Yama-jii's power is possibly the most destructive power in Bleachverse. Saying Yama-jii would lose even with Bankai just because Ichibei lost is like saying Kenpachi is weaker than Toushiro because he was injured against #5 while Shirou-chan scraped through #3.  There's a reason everyone who fights Yama-jii has to strip him of his Zanpakutou to fight - they wouldn't be able to defeat him otherwise."
bleach,3bmuln,aizen6,12,Tue Jun 30 17:04:06 2015 UTC,And Aizen had the bright idea that the only way to beat Yamamoto was with his own power.   Old guy got some raw deals.
bleach,3bmuln,LuridofArabia,3,Tue Jun 30 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is how Aizen should have ended, something like how this video makes it seem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tr6NfTfDLc. I mean it'd be cool if he evolved first and started kicking Ichigo's ass and shit. Meanwhile Yamamoto is dealing with the lobotomy patient, and then Ichigo's out cold, and then Aizen notices his pet get destroyed just as he's about end Ichigo's life. Yamamoto then has that little discussion with Aizen, he dives onto the nuclear explosion, absorbs all of it into his arms, pretends to faint, Aizen tries to kill him, then Yamamoto does that Hado #96 building sized sword move, Aizen nearly dies, then Ichigo finally finishes off another mother fuck with his Getsuga Tenshuou, which happens to be a weakened god-like Aizen. The story ends shortly after, everyone's happy that the ending was awesome, it starts gaining DBZ-like status with more spin-off movies and tons of videogames and toys, Kubo invites me to his mansion where we do blow and slap some ass. The end."

bleach,3bmuln,The_Other_Olsen,2,Tue Jun 30 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Post Aizen fight. Ukitake mentions soul society has never witnessed a being stronger than Yama. Given Ukitake and Shunsui had been his first pupils they very well could've been children when Yhwach fought Yama and lost. This would of cemented the fact that he was the strongest. You can trick him and that's been the only 2 times he has failed the later being deadly.  Yhwach would of lost but given Yama had one arm and was quite older than their last fight, plus Yhwach has consumed all the souls of the dead Quincy since. I think the second fight was to show the tipping of power even without the tricks he could of beaten him but at a price.   http://www.mangastream.to/bleach-chapter-436-page-7.html"
bleach,3bmuln,Rocksbury,-4,Tue Jun 30 15:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yea but you could also chalk it up to hero worship and his own boasting.   ""hey kids did I ever tell you how my zanpakuto is the strongest ever""  and my Bankai is ""all powerful"".   It's not that his Zan is OP that's annoying it's that he claims to be the strongest and he gets built up to be some monster but as soon as he can't use Bankai ""waaaaa,  I want my Bankai""  and he gets merked.   You'd think the captain commander could fight off an unveiled Aizen but nope.   Aizen not even scratched.   Instead it's Isshin who proves stronger than Aizen not Yamma.   So weak"

bleach,3bmuln,chaosattractor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:25:34 2015 UTC,Yama has to fight an enemy created for the sole purpose of sealing his power. Had already nearly one hit that giant monster and when it comes to Aizen he literally is becoming Immortal.   He beat Yhwach in the past something nobody anywhere ever has done besides him. Lives for thousands of years ruling the strongest organization that also balances the world's souls...get killed because another character designed to trick him succeeds after they invade his land and kill his close comrade. It takes the strongest God like beings backhanded tricks to harm Yama. In his youth he was simply a monster.
bleach,3bmuln,Rocksbury,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget that Yama was also under the effects of KS so there was little chance, once his ability to just obliterate everything was taken away, that he could have fought Aizen in any direct manner.    Additionally, it seem like Isshin should have been under KS effect, but we don't know that he was.  At the point Isshin fought him, though, Aizen was taking blows almost as a challenge."

bleach,3bmuln,rigaj,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think Isshin was ever said to be stronger than Yama. Sure aizen says he's reached his limit but he's also spent the last few hours using KS and fighting every captain there as well as the vizards. I always interpreted that more as he was worn out and evolved as a result of a captain class fighter showing up who was fresh and ready to fight. I think Isshin is strong but are you saying he's the strongest ""good guy"" character we've seen? My interpretation could very well be wrong, but I don't think Isshin is base aizen level or yama level."
bleach,3bmuln,Bruster10,2,Thu Jul 2 16:06:30 2015 UTC,"I think his Almighty would withstand Yama's bankai, but I wonder how he lost 1000 ago. Apparently he didn't use Almighty at that time even though he already had it. Ichibei also didn't know about his ability from his first battle with Yama, so it seems solid that Juha didn't use it 1000 ago. But why? I think their battle might have happened at night when his powers went to Haschwalth, that would explain it."
bleach,3bmuln,fairbrooks,2,Tue Jun 30 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yama would have beaten fake yhwach and real yhwach with his bankai if it was not stolen from him, because of one simple explanation:   ""A"" the almighty was not active during the entire two part invasion. Yhwach didn't even have two irises until he was finally in the royal realm, so if he was kept occupied by Yama without bankai theft, because yhwach could not nullify abilities and revert them back toward the user or even see the future, he would have lost. Just like fake ywach lost to Yama, it would have gone in an identical way. ""A"" the almighty basically gives yhwach every kind of armor imaginable and turns him fearsome .  But if yhwach would have been able to just stay alive long enough for ""A"" the almighty to activate, then he would also beat Yama regardless"
bleach,3bmuln,kingofdabz,3,Wed Jul 1 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"i think yhwach would have won anyway , just the way he won with ichibei . yhwach base form would lose to yama , then he would simply cancel off his techniques , just like he did with ichibei's ink . then it would come down to a sword fight , and since yhwach can see your next move , i guess yama would lose"
bleach,3bmuln,oetsuthebest,10,Tue Jun 30 15:28:24 2015 UTC,"Except Yhwach hadn't awakened his Almighty powers until his fight with Ichibei, so his foresight would be a non-issue in his fight with Yama."
bleach,3bmuln,ChipsHanden,3,Tue Jun 30 18:09:34 2015 UTC,Also he has his almighty activated in the flashback arc which means yama still took him out at full power
bleach,3bmuln,rigaj,3,Tue Jun 30 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"But I don't think full power back then is even close to what it is now. His beard is way bigger in the present.   But seriously, a ton of Quincies have died in the past 1,000 years, not to mention he absorbed the powers of all the gemischt Quincy as well. Also, has he unlocked The Almighty to the same extent? I think people are grasping at straws implying that he has it just because he looked at Jugram and said, ""Hey, come with me."""

The problem being, after having his Bankai taken, Yamamoto was cut down before he could even make a move. So, without The Almighty or his full power active, Yhwach OHKO'd Yamamoto."
bleach,3bmuln,Fearless-Fairness,2,Tue Jun 30 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"I think that's more because not even Yama could defeat a Yhwach with his bankai, how would he? In the end yama kinda just gave up, if he sealed instead of stole his bankai, I feel that yama would still try to kill yhwach."
bleach,3bmuln,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:52 2015 UTC,"He could just use Ennetsu Jikogu.  If it was good enough for Aizen and himself, then it should be good enough for Yhwach."

bleach,3bmuln,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"That's the problem though, what can a shikai ability do to a bankai? Surely Zanka no Tachi 'West' would have prevented damage."
bleach,3bmuln,Kaiyonx,3,Tue Jun 30 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"The main reason to steal the Bankai was to de-power the Captains. In general, Blut is strong enough to withstand Shikai level attacks. Besides that, the Bankai becomes weaker in the hands of the Quincy because they are new to it. Sasakibe's Bankai became so weak that it was only a nuisance to Yamamoto.  So, Yhwach would be using Zanka No Tachi against Yamamoto. Even if he did, there's no guarantee he'd even be able to access West to defend himself.  So, there's a good chance he could be injured by an Ennetsu Jikogu.  In Yamamoto's situation, injuring him and hoping that helped someone beat him later would be the only option, but Yamamoto was still cut down before he could make a move."
bleach,3bmuln,Fearless-Fairness,2,Tue Jun 30 15:01:27 2015 UTC,"these are good points. i feel like the whole yama vs ywach fight was complete tosh tbh. and just a way to remove yama from the story as he was simply too strong. just like how inoue's plotbreaking powers were done away with by saying that they simply ""wouldn't work"" on the soul king despite the fact they work on everything else in the bleachverse. his death really annoyed me not because i liked the character but because he literally stood in one spot for like 2 pages and let ywach cut him in half..."
bleach,3bmuln,rickdousey,2,Wed Jul 1 02:13:35 2015 UTC,"There was a narrative about his surrender to Yhwach. It was foreshadowed in the flashback when he told Shunsui (as a child) that if he ever had to use Bankai again, he wouldn't come back.   So he always knew that, if there was an enemy strong enough to make him use Bankai, that enemy would kill him. He may have even known the seal on Yhwach would be broken one day and that he would lose to Yhwach if it was (I think the reason Yhwach was sealed in the first place was because he could not be killed, sealing is always the plot tool used on characters that can't be killed)"
bleach,3bmuln,Fearless-Fairness,-1,Wed Jul 1 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"Except it wasn't good enough for Aizen was it?   As soon as Yamma can't go Bankai he gets wrecked every time.   ""yeah but he bare handed aeon""  yea so would Kenpachi and any other elite captain.   Aizen didn't even get scratched by Yama.   Hell Ichigo's dad is the one who pushed Aizen to his limit not Yama.   He was mostly just hype since he never did anything of consequence except rile up a bunch of Yama fans with talks of ""ultimate power of my zan""   yea maybe don't rely on your Bankai so much old man.   Maybe get stronger without it so you don't get curb stompped everyone you can't use it."
bleach,3bmuln,shiba_keikaku,2,Wed Jul 1 06:45:11 2015 UTC,"Since Aizen went through the trouble of making Wonderweiss, it would seem Ennetsu Jikogu probably would have been enough for Aizen.  Aizen even planned for WW being defeated. Which is why he modified his powers so that he would release all the energy he absorbed instead of just dying."
bleach,3bmuln,unscanable,2,Wed Jul 1 10:46:58 2015 UTC,"A few sternritters were hit with his shikai and popped back up later on, so I don't think there was any point even trying to use it against Yhwach after the bankai was stolen."

So...  Personally, I'm of the opinion that Almighty is much stronger than the bankai stealing medallions, so yes. I think he would in fact kick the shit out of Yamamoto with Almighty.  As for how he lost 1000 years ago? Well, he was a lot weaker then."
bleach,3bmuln,Cykon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:46:44 2015 UTC,I'd say the bankai medallions are more similar to 'sankt altar' than to his eye ability
bleach,3bmuln,Kaiyonx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to say yes. It took Yammas entire banka to just kill a clone of Yhwach, not to mention the real thing one shot him. I just don't see yamma winning this one... Aizen said that victory is determined by spiritual pressure, and for Yhwach to have done that much damage in a swing... I'd bet his base was higher at that point."
bleach,3bmuln,rickdousey,3,Tue Jun 30 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"i don't think it's fair to say it took his ""entire bankai"" to kill a clone because, let's be honest there was 0 (read: ZERO) struggle for yama in that fight. the only reason he revealed his bankai was (plotwise) because he thought he was the real ywach and potentially the biggest threat he's seen in 1000 years and also because kubo wanted to kill him off."
bleach,3bmuln,SilviteRamirez,-3,Wed Jul 1 02:16:57 2015 UTC,But it is fair to say without his bankai he is weak sauce.   A side character Isshin was stronger than Yamma.   He pushed Aizen to evolve not Yamma.   Isshin didn't have his bankai either but he didn't whine about it he simply fought.   Ywatch easily beats Yamma with or without all mighty.   I mean look at all the examples of why people think Yamma would win.   They all assert that Yamma beat Ywatch back in the day but none of us know how.   How do we know the spirit king didn't assist or some other crazy shit like that.   From what WE HAVE SEEN.  Yamma ain't shit.   Just alot of hype about a Bankai  and an old man who got wrecked twice

He didn't say ""I'd surely lose"" or display any fear.   He is pragmatic and why have a complication like yYamma's Bankai in the mix when sealing it makes him so weak."

You might say that Ulquiorra symbolizes 'lust', but judging from his character and his musings, I would say that he symbolizes the 'emptiness' or 'hollow-ness' of death.   With that said, lets try to classify them according to the Sins.  Starrk: Doesn't seem to specifically fit into any, you could say that he has some elements of 'envy', since he was envious of the weaker Hollows around him who had so many friends.  Barragan: Definitely 'pride'.  Halibel: Doesn't fit into any specifically.  Ulquiorra: Same as Halibel.  Nnoitra: Could be 'envy' and/or 'pride' since, he was envious of Nelliel, and he had his so called 'warrior's pride' of dying in battle.  Grimmjow: Similar to Nnoitra, but replace 'envy' with 'wrath'.  Zommari: Definitely 'pride', as he believed himself to be above Byakki.  Szayel: 'Lust'.  Aaroneirro: 'Gluttony'  Yami: 'Wrath'."
bleach,3bn7i0,Sirocco_,15,Tue Jun 30 16:24:33 2015 UTC,"Well, Starrk is pretty obviously Sloth...  I know that Kubo changed his mind about the 7 Sins, yet I'd be interested what he originally planned for Ulquiorra, since Ulquiorra was created before this 7 Sins idea even popped up in his head."

bleach,3bn7i0,Zil_v_a,3,Tue Jun 30 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"Nnoitra - Envy would fit well, not only because of his history with Nel, but also because Kubo considered making his release snake-themed. He only chose the praying mantis instead because he thought the Spanish word for it sounded better. In the volume illustrations the snake represented envy."
bleach,3bn7i0,roldan_,6,Tue Jun 30 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"It wasn't just with Nel. His whole storyline is the envy of others, of power, of a place to belong. He was envious and he wanted to die in envy - off the hands of someone he could only want to best. One of the better and more dramatic espada story-wise, even though his release looks like garbage from design standpoint. In the manga, it's probably the most confusing fight to track."

I'd suspect Lust, since the word appears pretty often in connection with Ulquiorra. There is (most obviously) the lust poem (""[...]because of the heart I lust for everything about you."") which I have mentioned above. Then there is his theme song 'Moonshield', too:   ""And how I lust for the dance and the fire  Deep of the nectarine sunset to drink  Spill me the wind and its fire  To steal of the colors - I'm the moonshield"""
bleach,3bn7i0,Keranu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Ulquiorra was never meant to be part of the original Espada Kubo created. Ulquiorra was originally based off the design for Orihime's father, which Kubo made before serialisation even began, so I'd say he was drawn as the first Vasto Lorde and it wasn't until later when Kubo was creating the Espada that he decided this Vasto Lorde would become an Arrancar.  I really wish Kubo had left Orihime's brother as a Hollow and eventually merged his character with Ulquiorra."

Grimmjow - Greed (He wants to be king. He wants to be the best. He always wants more.)   In all honesty, when he dropped the 7 sins thing the characters likely got a little scrambled."

bleach,3bnd53,yukeake,3,Tue Jun 30 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"1 - After learning of his past, and having the Asauchi ""submit"" to him, Ichigo made a fresh imprint upon one of them.  You see it change form, from the Asauchi ""blank"" form, to one that looks very similar to Hichigo/Zangetsu, with a full mask.  This imprinted Asauchi is then ""forged"" into Ichigo's new zanpakuto by Oetsu.  During the forging, Ichigo has his first encounter with OMZ since he lost his powers.  OMZ says he'll stop suppressing his Shinigami powers, and step aside.  Ichigo has none of that, and inserts OMZ directly into the in-process zanpakuto.  The result is a dual-zanpakuto - with each spirit (NewHichigo/Zangetsu and OMZ) each manifesting over one of the blades.  2 - Assuredly, this is his Shikai.  It's not explicitly stated, but Ichigo's never really had a standard ""call the release command"" sealed zanpakuto.  The large blade bears some superficial resemblance to his previous Shikai states as well.  3 - While we have no confirmation yet, this seems extremely likely.  He already has rapport with OMZ.  Barring any oddity with NewHichigo/Zangetsu, he should have Bankai.  4 - Most Bankai change in appearance/form, so I'd say this is likely, yes.  5 - This is...complicated.  There's no direct evidence, so we're free to speculate.  My personal speculation is that the post-Fullbring zanpakuto Ichigo wields are ""memories"".  I went into detail on this theory a few days ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/3b2ms5/can_someone_explain_ichigos_many_zanpaktous_to_me/csidm2j"
bleach,3bnd53,Alluka-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"Are his new swords his shikai release?   Yes.   Will he (or maybe he already does) have a bankai? If he already does, would it basically be a ""transfer"" of his old bankai to a new form? (In other words, he wouldn't have to train and re-achieve it, he already has it at his disposal)   Same situation Renji was in and Byakuya to an extent. Ichigo's Bankai is almost guaranteed to be different since he has full control over all aspects of his power.   If he does/will have a bankai , do you think the swords will change in appearance, or remain the same and just have a power-up with a flashy new technique?   Yes and I believe his appearance will change too. I'd like to think he'd look similar to his Vasto Lorde form in a sense."

He has a bankai. If he could have a bankai when he had no idea what is his zanpakutou spirit and all that, then now he just has to have one. It's probably the most powerful bankai in the series at this point. I already often theorized that he keeps himself from using it because he doesn't understand Yhwach and simply so far wasn't trying to defeat him, just stop him (as he was asked to). His zanpaktou type was always a clad-type, it changed his clothing as well as itself. It was like that with his every other power as well, so I'm pretty sure it will. It wasn't as much fake as it was ""forced-out"" by his quincy power. Kind of how Yhwach can control powers his inner quincy, the OMZ was capable of controling both his hollow and actual blade (""Hichigo"")  and pushing him out to aid Ichigo. He didn't actually want Ichigo to learn who is his blade and become a real shiningami as he was a quincy part of his nature.   TL;DR - Big yes. Ichigo was cheating and probably using like, half his powers tops when he fought Aizen. Pretty scary, ain't it?"
bleach,3bnd53,Zil_v_a,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:48:27 2015 UTC,I never thought about Ichigo being hesitant to use his Bankai against Yhwach....that's an interesting theory. Maybe he's afraid that if he releases it his inner Quincy will takeover or something?

bleach,3blt5x,shiba_keikaku,3,Tue Jun 30 11:07:23 2015 UTC,Wait what? so Aizen fulfilled his wishes through being defeated by Ichigo after all! All according to keikaku.
bleach,3blt5x,choywh,6,Tue Jun 30 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"Since Aizen knew about the SK's status as the linchpin, it's possible that Aizen felt that the SK wasn't ""doing enough"" and more-or-less desired the position so that he could freely shape and control reality, to be closer to a One True God status, instead of just being that which maintains the boundaries of the dimensions. The SK is already pretty much a symbol of being ""God"", but Aizen 'thinks about how the world should be, not how it is'."
bleach,3blt5x,Tiresieas,3,Tue Jun 30 08:31:27 2015 UTC,"Aizen is alone. His drive would be more of the SK not doing enough rather than wanting more power. That's part of the reason he lost to Ichigo, since deep down he didn't want to be alone and the Hogyoku listened to it."
bleach,3blt5x,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,5,Tue Jun 30 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"This is how I took it, especially in hindsight.  Aizen somehow ""saw"" the SK, in his crystal.  Aizen saw that the SK, for all his power, was doing (essentially) nothing.  Aizen felt that, given that power, he could do a ""better"" job - most likely by being a more ""active"" participant.  His discussion with Urahara whilst being sealed is another tip-off.  Urahara has seen the same thing as Aizen - but appears to understand the SK's situation - even sympathize with it, based on the look on his face.  But whereas Aizen is incensed by this, Urahara is...disappointed?  The look he gives is like he wants to do something about it, but can't.  From Yhwach's comments about the SK, it seems like it's implied that the SK being sealed in the crystal isn't something he chose, but rather something forced upon him.  It's less a throne, than a prison.  Yet, necessary in order to maintain the current world-state.  We don't know the full story surrounding the creation of the SK - only Yhwach's word that it was ""created by the Shinigami"".  From this, what I'm guessing is that Aizen misunderstood the situation.  What he was as the SK doing nothing, like an absentee landlord, was really the SK being imprisoned, and forced into a role.  The Royal Guard then become more like prison guards, and the Royal Realm itself like a heavily-fortified prison."

But anyways that is how he could know the Soul King, maybe he got to visit with Yoruichi, but that isn't how he discovered the Hogyoku.  If you rewatch the pendulum, he discovered it on accident (like how many scientific discoveries are made, classic) while researching how to make a Shinigami's soul stronger. He created a living substance that helped dissolve the barriers between Hollow and Shinigami. That's basically it, he's a genius scientist and engineer, and was just doing experiments and tinkering with shit while trying to develop shit to help make people stronger.  Kinda like how Viagra was discovered. Seriously look how Viagra was discovered. It wasn't originally meant to be Viagra, it was a failed experiment. That's what Urahara did. He tried to make steroids for Shinigami, but instead he made Viagra. Viagra that induced hysteria and shit.... like if you took Viagra and bath salts, same exact thing as Hollowfication."

If we view the SK's ""condition"" as something akin to imprisonment - but also as something ""necessary"", that look would make a lot of sense, given Urahara's personality.  It's that look that makes me think he may have originally intended the hogyoku to be an artificial replacement for the Soul King.

bleach,3bgufr,Korrasch,24,Mon Jun 29 02:41:36 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought a while ago, more about Bakudo than Hado, especially since Hado has never really shown to be THAT more effective than regular attacks outside of the high 80s or 90s which only a handle of people are capable of.  As for Bakudo, there's just the fact that really, if the character hasn't been shown using it like Byakuya, they probably aren't that good at it because outside of the incredibly turbulent events of the anime. 99.9% of the time, they're just fighting Hollows which are purified by zanpakuto kills and not Kido kills, so Hado is relatively useless.  Furthermore, we have no idea how effective Bakudo even are against Quincies. Their main ability is being able to absorb ambient reishi, so it seems quite probable that the SR would just absorb the Bakudo in seconds."

Kido seems to be harder, generally, to use. You can either utilize weaker kido, but that would be ineffective against a strong opponent. Or you can try to use stronger kido, but that would need the incantation to be effective. And that wouldn't really work in battle because no one's going to wait around to let someone say a long poem. Unless you're Barragan. Kubo came up with too many numbers for kido and is afraid he can't come up with any more than what he's shown   I will point out that Ichibe used kido against Yhwach. That was both surprising and refreshing."
bleach,3bgufr,Aaroniero,4,Mon Jun 29 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"Shinigami in the Gotei are not well versed in Kido. Even of the ones that are, their real specialty is always their Zanpakuto.  Shinigami of the Gotei specialize in using their Zanpakuto powers and Zanjutsu. The Kido Corps specialize in Kido and the Onmitsukido specialize in Hoho and Hakuda.   That set up guarantees that we won't be seeing too much Kido in the series since the Gotei is always in the spotlight. Kubo also took Hacchi and gave him Hollow powers. So, instead of thinking up Kido spells for Hacchi to use, Kubo can just let him do whatever the Hell he wants and say it's a special Hollow barrier."

Yeah most shinigami don't really use it in combat because they're just not that good at it, you need to be pretty proficient to use it effectively in combat, and only a select few are. Most people have to use the big long incantations to use kido, takes a proper master to be able to do it without incantation, and even then the opponent can often dodge it, or at the power levels we're at now, just break out with sheer force."

Nanoa against Hash.   It's still used but often times forgot or not the proper time to use it. Enemies may be too strong by now and can cancel some with heir reshei. Idk.

bleach,3bgufr,ecass305,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:43:15 2015 UTC,"I think the reason is because the Quincy are just to fast. The Sternritter don't have to call out the name of their powers. High tier Quincy basically use their spirit weapons like guns. Also Uryu once claimed that Heirenyaku is superior to all the forms of high speed movement. All counter productive to kido since you have to recite them for it to work. Kido can be used effectively (Urahara, Nanoa) only by Kido masters against the Quincy."

Kuroshisugi hit komamura and he was back up a few moments later and didn't even need medical treatment, Itto Kaso hit Aizen point blank and he just walked right out,  Tessais flying dragon kido who knows what it would do because its blocked by any shinigami who knows danku and lastly Aizen used Raikaho point blank on Isshin and achieved nothing  Everything below those hados have been used by vice captains and have done nothing to the opponents they used it against  Then you have bakudos and the only useful ones are 80 and above. Since level 60s and 70s kido are were EASILY broken by kensei and Ichigos hollow form respectively and the enemies currently on the field are far stronger than them  That leaves Danku and Bankin as the minimum you would have to use against these enemies for it to be even remotely useful"
bleach,3bgufr,PokeMaster420,-1,Mon Jun 29 10:23:16 2015 UTC,"It seems like kido was something kubo really wanted to make awesome and impactful but cus of all the pressure and shit he got from publishers and fans to foward the plot and stuff he had to put in retarded plot devices like one kido being able to completely nullify almost every other kido and on top of that a stronger reatsu can also just shut down any kido, you dont even need that kido that can block every other attack kido, which then makes the whole urahara's sealing kido a plot hole, but who cares, its awesome how he invented a new kido just to seal him.  So now in the last arc i think kubos just given up with kido and hope everyone forgets."

bleach,3bjbs5,Keranu,14,Tue Jun 30 00:32:27 2015 UTC,I think it works a little bit different. Yhwach doesnt give powers. He gives part of his soul and this part of souls let people have superpowers based on their characteristics. As Nodt was so frightened that fear became his power. Same thing with Loyd and Royd. Imitating each other was something they were doing their whole life. Gremmy was a visionary and thats why he gained this kind of power.

bleach,3bjbs5,HatoriHanzoSteel,3,Tue Jun 30 01:32:42 2015 UTC,Maybe Guenael was Gremmy's original appearance before becoming just the brain in a jar. Or the original Visionary. Maybe they're gonna show something in the flashbacks.   As for why he didn't imagine him healing back... It's just that Gremmy is kinda stupid. Why didn't he just convert Kenpachi's bones into cookies like he did with Yachiru? Why did he just throw things at him instead of doing modifications to Kenpachi himself? Why didn't he destroy Nozarashi? He didn't even try.  That power is just ridiculous. It's too exagerated. The only reason Gremmy appeared was to show off how insanely powerful Kenpachi became after killing Unohana.

bleach,3bfysp,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,29,Sun Jun 28 22:16:33 2015 UTC,Simple. Gross underestimation.
bleach,3bfysp,Humble_Shopkeeper,9,Sun Jun 28 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"To add to the others, Chojiro's power level was practically irrelevant at that point, especially since he scarred Yama with his bankai when he didn't even get the chance to use his Shikai before being defeated. Ichigo defeated those three lieutenants in 10 seconds using hakuda, shattering Gegetsuburi with a single punch. Ichigo's power level, as we know, was incredibly unstable until this arc, and when he fought Byakuya during the SS Arc was one of the highest points."
bleach,3bfysp,water_warrior,6,Mon Jun 29 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure Kubo had any idea how powerful he wanted Sasakibe to be at that time. I mean, if you go back and read the chapter following his death, Byakuya's Euology almost reads as a massive ""fuck you"" to all of the fans who claimed he was weak/useless as a result of this incident. And let's keep it real, 99% of Bleach readers were convinced he sucked ass because of that one scuffle. It's like: ""We all know Oomaeda sucks. We know Isane is a kidou user (although she seems really eager to throw hands...lol) so we don't expect dazzling melee skills from her. So by association, this rapier-wielding fop has to suck...amirite?""  If it's one thing I've learned from reading Bleach since the beginning is TK is a vengeful bastard when it comes to this sort of thing. Sasakibe suddenly becomes the only Shinigami capable of injuring Yamamoto...Mayuri becomes virtually unstoppable since being sacrificed to Ishida...everything will come full circle when Orihime finally wakes the fuck up, gets REALLY pissed and just rejects ""Just Because"" and his Quincy chambermaids out of existence without Ichigo lifting a finger."
bleach,3bfysp,Enigmatik_1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:18:23 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100 percent. It was probably a retcon issue where Kubo simply didn't have all of the side characters' abilities and strength levels fleshed out yet.
bleach,3bfysp,rickEbobby,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"No doubt.  Being totally honest, I don't even think Sasakibe had spoken a single word at that point (he may have, but I don't remember it...lol). He was just the surly looking VC of Squad 1, usually kneeling somewhere in the general vicinity of Yamamoto.  Incidentally, it was the rogue zanpakutou arc that really set the wheels in motion for future events...although that's all in retrospect. His zan even complains about not being recognized/acknowledged and is a lightning type, but there is no precedent in canon so it's dismissed as filler nonsense. I think it was probably about then that TK figured out what type of zanpakutou he wanted him to have and it isn't lost on me that his was the only lightning type that we've seen/know of.  Simply put, TK had no clue what to do with Chojiro in the beginning, fleshed him out around the rogue zanpakutou arc, only to erroneously decide to off panel him to some random Sternritter. I say erroneously because he didn't establish Chojiro as a badass until after he was already dead. I personally think the whole thing would've had infinitely more weight had we knew what we now know about him BEFORE he got killed rather than AFTER.  As I recall, people were also clamouring for ""good guy"" death around that time too, so Sasakibe was the sacrificial lamb to get the ball rolling...only no one cared because everyone thought he sucked...but wait...he's secretly a G and could solo half of the G13 easily.  Shame, TK...shame! rings bell SHAME! rings bell"
bleach,3bfysp,Enigmatik_1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that had we known about his past and power levels before he got killed, his death at the beginning of the arc would have been that much more impactful.  Thinking back about it now, it's a bit saddening because I wish Kubo could have given us a proper fight with him before he killed him off....even if it had just been a chapter or two. He seemed like a cool dude, and I think its neat that he had a rapier as a zan instead of the mainstream katana (since he was all about western culture and all)."
bleach,3bfysp,rickEbobby,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"You could make the same case for Isane (even though she isn't dead). Her Itegumo releases to become a parrying dagger, which ironically enough, is the typical companion weapon to the rapier...much like the wakazashi is for the katana.  I think we need Zombie Sasakibe!"
bleach,3bfysp,Enigmatik_1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"Kubo had the whole story planned out but it was the editors that made him have to chop and change things so they would control what they thought would be the most popular.

bleach,3bfysp,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:00:29 2015 UTC,I think it's more like his Bankai being extremely powerful. After all he got quite easily destroyed by some Quincy guy who was basically fodder
bleach,3bfysp,miorli,5,Tue Jun 30 08:57:05 2015 UTC,"That whole sequence is the equivalent of a sucker punch. In a bankai vs bankai battle, Sasakibe could probably defeat Ichigo at that point in time. Not much later we see Ichigo's bankai and the massive speed boost he got because his bankai replaced the giant slab of iron with a simple katana.  It was meant to showcase Ichigo's newfound power and speed, which combined together could defeat three lieutenants (one of which being a captain-class Shinigami) barehanded."

I do suppose, as other's have mentioned, that the transfer of Zanpaktou is still possible, which would still explain why Yoriuchi doesn't have one, but we certainly back to the no proof of that issue."

bleach,3bgfny,SputterNutter,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:07:44 2015 UTC,"Is it possible that the Zanpakutou reverts to a blank Asauchi when the 2nd squad captain changes?  Of course, there's no precedent for this, and we have no evidence it can happen, but you never know.  I'm thinking that the Zanpakutou would revert to a blank Asauchi, then become quickly re-imprinted on whoever the new captain is.    But... I just realized that doesn't work because the new captain would already have a zanpakutou.    Or would they?  As far as we know, lots of the spec ops people just have regular katanas or wakizashis.  Maybe they just get normal swords, and only the captain has a zanpakutou.    While I'm at it, what does the CSS mean in your username?"
bleach,3bgfny,Andygoesrawr,2,Mon Jun 29 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it necessarily has to be made into a blank Asauchi. It could be possible for a single Asauchi to contain imprints from multiple people, but only each person can use their respective Shikai. That would explain why Ichigo's original Zanpakutou retained Rukia's appearance but gained a few of Ichigo's traits. Or it could be that imprinting on an Asauchi just overrides any imprinting previously on it, without changing the appearance of the sword.  Yes, Sui-Feng had a Zanpakutou. The page OP linked says that Sui-Feng was working on Nigeki Kessatsu 100 years ago, which means she had a Zanpakutou. Furthermore, even members of the Onmitsukidou and the Kidou Corps have gone through the Reijutsu academy, where they would've been given Zanpakutou.  CSS is Cascading Style Sheets."
bleach,3bgfny,SputterNutter,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"So, if the single Asauchi has all these people's imprints, could it theoretically use every single shikai/bankai power that's ever run through it?  I think yes, but you'd have to have someone like Oetsu (probably only him, actually) who really UNDERSTANDS the Asauchi, to make that happen.  And what does Cascading Style Sheets mean?"

Unlikely. If this was a scenario (one which I don't see happening anyway) then the shikai/bankai abilities evolve while being wielded by another person. This is because the imprint changes. The imprints likely do not stack.   And what does Cascading Style Sheets mean?   It's a piece of code that tells a webpage what to look like. Andy wrote the code so that /r/bleach looks like what it looks like."
bleach,3bgfny,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:48:04 2015 UTC,"Well, if multiple people are able to imprint on a single Asauchi without the imprints being overridden, then yes, it could hold a number of Shikai, but not Bankai. Bankai requires both the imprinted Zanpakutou and the Shinigami who imprinted on it, since Bankai is the manifestation of the Zanpakutou spirit which resides within a Shinigami, not within their sword. We know this because when Cang Du stole Daiguren Hyourinmaru, the spirit of Hyourinmaru went with it, yet Hitsugaya was still able to use Shikai because it contained Hyourinmaru's imprint.  As for Shikai, it's a bit of a tough one. We know that only the Shinigami who owns the Zanpakutou can release the Shikai, but theoretically a Fullbringer might be able to. We know for a fact Ginjou can, since his powers allow him to absorb Zanpakutou and Fullbrings and use their powers. So if a Fullbringer can, a Shinigami who has the sufficient technology (i.e. Mayuri, Urahara, Ouetsu) would be able to as well. Especially Ouetsu, considering he knows the position of every single Asauchi and is able to manipulate them at will."

bleach,3bgfny,kuroisekai,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"Or maybe the translation just isn't great?   It isn't. It's unlikely that Yoruichi wasn't able to master a technique of her own shikai and so warranting an explanation from Soi Fon on what Yoruichi's shikai was. That makes zero sense. Also, other translations have pointed out that it was Soi Fon's ability all along, not Yoruichi's.   Could it be that the Zanpaktou resides with the head of that military force, regardless of who it is?    That might happen, though we haven't seen any corroborating evidence that could prove that. Nozarashi might be an example, but we know almost nothing about Nozarashi either.   It's possible that Yoruichi doesn't have a Zanpakuto."

I also found it surprising that so many humans knew of Soul Society, but all of the humans there are Quincy. This really just means that the Quincy have had dealing with the Shinigami in the past."
bleach,3bfeh7,Fearless-Fairness,9,Sun Jun 28 20:55:46 2015 UTC,It's earth but I have a feeling that the Quincy are like the Wizards from Harry Potter where they have their own separate society. The Quincy are way more advance than the time period.
bleach,3bfeh7,ecass305,2,Sun Jun 28 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"They may be more advanced because Bach has seen the future and introduced some aspects of it to his Quincies. Like modern uniform. He could've just seen it and liked it, so he made his army wear it."
bleach,3bfeh7,fairbrooks,6,Tue Jun 30 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"I saw a theory that kinda made sense, about it being Hueco Mundo. There are random ruins dotting the landscape here and there, and its barren now... What if the Quincy lived there, then got stomped by the SS, so they retreated into the shadows, leaving Hueco Mundo empty and war-torn. The passage of time, plus the Hollows having a vast empty land to call home would turn it into a desolate desert. This would also kinda explain why the Quincy took it back before revealing themselves to the SS and starting there. Re-conquering an ancient homeland seems like a good idea, and it kinda makes sense...kind of."
bleach,3bfeh7,HazelnutPi,2,Mon Jun 29 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, a very interesting theory. Also Hueco Mundo may became a wasteland after Yama has used his bankai in that realm. We know that he has burnt down all the Quincy army in the past. I also think that this flashback may take place in the world of the living, but before shinigami created the SK and the balance of souls, meaning before the separation of SS from the living world. So there is no boundary between them now, that's why everybody knows about the Soul Society."

bleach,3bfeh7,Narissis,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"I need to re-read the start of the current arc again, but didn't Yama kill a number of Yhwach's subordinates before showing off his Zanpakutou's more interesting abilities? And weren't a couple of the zombies that Yama summoned killed by other Shinigami in the attack?  Also, Yhwach was defeated 1000 years ago, and we learned that Old Man Zangetsu looks the same as Yhwach at the time he was defeated. The Yhwach from the recent flashback mini-arc appears to be a similar age to what he is now. Coupled with Bazz-B and Haschwalth aging at the rate they did in 5 years I'd put the current mini-arc as being within 10-15 years ago at most."
bleach,3bfeh7,Jam-Master-Jay,6,Sun Jun 28 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"The flashback is taking place over 1000 years ago.   In Yamamoto's fight with Royd, he used Zanka no Tachi South. This allows him to summon those he killed with his Bankai and have them fight on his side. We were shown 3 of Yhwach's close subordinates, Zeidritz, Hubert and Algora. In this current flashback we see that those 3 are alive and well.  The last time Yamamoto and Yhwach had an encounter was 1000 years ago. That means Yamamoto killed them back then. In the flashback Yhwach is just now creating the Sternritter and planning his first assault on Soul Society as well.  Hope this clears things up."

bleach,3bdepf,oetsuthebest,4,Sun Jun 28 11:22:00 2015 UTC,"Any part of Yhwach's power would help.  Besides, Yhwach has the ability to distribute power to his Sternritter. He could make Haschwalth as powerful as he needs him to be able to handle Zanka no Tachi.  I just don't see what Yhwach will do with it. His abilities have already reached a level where he wouldn't even need Zanka no Tachi to instantly disintegrate someone.  Also, it's possible that the amount of power required to handle Zanka no Tachi was only relevant while Yamamoto was alive. Now that he's dead, there's no connection between them to be constantly suppressed, so I imagine there would be no power required to keep it sealed."

He gave Ichigo his Reiatsu and made it resonate with the Quincy power inside him, forcing him to kill the Soul King.  If it's power required for wielding Zanka no Tachi, that just means Haschwalth would use a weaker version of it. Remember Koukou Gonryou Rikyuu? Yamamoto said the version Driscoll used was pathetic compared to when it was in the hands of Sasakibe. That means the power of the Bankai is dependent on the power of the Quincy wielding it. Yhwach could use its full strength, but Haschwalth would still be able to use an extremely powerful version of it considering he's powerful enough to cut Ichigo's Bankai in half."

In the end he would've lost everything to Yhwach; his village, his best friend and ultimately his life.  The only question is how would Haschwalth get the medallion?

Difference being that Ichibei was on-guard for it, and Ichigo wasn't (not that Ichigo would necessarily know how to counter it like Ichibei did).  He probably also didn't expect the attack to come from the sword, rather than Yhwach himself."

How strong could it really be.   It's supposed to get its power from its weilded yea.   So how powerful can it be when Yamma couldn't even beat Aizen.

Aizen was with Shunsui the whole time and Yhwach is preoccupied Jugo uses Yama Bankai and kills Shunsui. Being shonen the group manages to escape.

bleach,3bd26j,elxx714,30,Sun Jun 28 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Aizen is fuzzy, but my understanding is that he understood the potential of Ichigo and tried to drive him toward it so that Ichigo could eventually push along Aizen's evolution prior to heading off to face the Royal Guard.  This plan basically worked, if it wasn't that darn Urahara and those meddling kids!  I assume if Ichigo was crippled by KS then the Hogyoku wouldn't have felt the need to push Aizen along the evolutionary chart."
bleach,3bd26j,unitedpath,6,Sun Jun 28 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Aizen is an interesting villain because despite having a hax hypnosis power, he is also insanely powerful.

Yoruichi and Kisuke were likely under hypnosis as well, how else did Aizen manage his experiments and manipulations without alerting anyone? Remember Yoruichi was head of the Onmitsukido and Urahara was a high ranking member and current head of R&D.  Isshin? Why wouldn't he be? Aizen made it a point to make sure all officers were under his spell. If this is because of the reiatsu concealing cloaks, that's because this was in the world of the living, where any spiritually aware person could have sensed him otherwise."

bleach,3bd26j,alivinci,-1,Tue Jun 30 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"but it wasnt ichigo who started his evolution man , it was first his fight with isshin then his betrayal from gin . yeah ichigo made the third evolution , but i mean , there was no need for that . maybe he could have stopped the 0 division even with that , or if not , the hogyoku would have made him evolve again ... i really dont see any motivation to why he didnt show him the shikai or why didnt he kill him since the start . it happened only because of plot , nothing else ."
bleach,3bd26j,oetsuthebest,2,Sun Jun 28 10:53:01 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Aizen specifically stated that he manipulated Ichigo into becoming powerful so that he could push along his development.  As we saw in his fight with FGT Ichigo, if Aizen was pushed too fast or too hard, the Hogyoku could reject him.  While he seemed surprised at that occurrence, it does not mean the possibility surprised him.  He probably understood he needed to achieve a certain level before Ichibei Just renamed him and Oetsu just cut him into pieces"
bleach,3bd26j,unitedpath,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"His ""first"" evolution, after merging with the hogyoku was directly due to Ichigo.

He intentionally set up the circumstances for Ichigo to evolve, then used the hogyoku to ""copy"" Ichigo's evolution - essentially skipping all the awkward ""needing to deal with an inner Hollow"" phase.  After that, his evolutions sparked by Gin blowing his chest apart, and Ichigo running roughshod over him weren't targeted, as he didn't have a ""template"" - he just kept willing himself to be ""more powerful"", and the hogyoku was taking the steps it felt necessary to make what Aizen envisioned happen."

He intentionally set up the circumstances for it to happen, because he planed to copy it all along.  Notice that Aizen doesn't have to deal with an inner Hollow (as the Vizards and Ichigo do), yet is able to achieve a hybrid state?  He used the hogyoku to ""shortcut"" from his standard Shinigami form to a ""stable"" hybrid, by copying Ichigo's growth.  That Ichigo never gained control over that particular form is irrelevant - it's possible, so the hogyoku manipulates probability to make it so."
bleach,3bd26j,yukeake,10,Tue Jun 30 18:25:58 2015 UTC,Why would he have shown his shikai? Aizen stopped Ichigo's bankai with a single finger while still sealed.  For deliberate reasons? Probably just to see what would happen.
bleach,3bd26j,Humble_Shopkeeper,2,Sun Jun 28 02:49:21 2015 UTC,"I feel the need to elaborate a bit on one of the likely reasons Aizen didn't put Ichigo under hypnosis: so Soul Society wouldn't kill/imprison/etc him. Soul Society's track record with such things is terrible, and keeping Ichigo as the only captain level shinigami not under hypnosis likely stayed Soul Society's hand in regards to him and his friends. Don't wanna fuck up and lose a major player on your side. True, they still kept him under surveillance and planned to off him later, but it kept him alive to even get to the war. So Aizen could then continue his agenda/experiment with Ichigo."

Aizen has a loud mouth, but he's never gone too far into depth about the positives and negatives of his abilities with the exception of what he told Gin. For all we know, there are restrictions to what he can achieve with his Zanpakuto. Maybe there's a limit to how many new people he can affect at a time. Perhaps he spent months gradually adding people's signatures to his Shikai before carrying out his experiments because he can only add a new one every week. Or year. Who knows?  Kubo could give us one of a thousand plausible explanations. Maybe he will, maybe he won't, but the last few remaining layers of mystery surrounding Aizen means that it isn't contradictory."

As insane and misogynistic as Unohana's death was...we never had to watch her go 'BEHOLD MY POWER' and then the big bad go 'well yeah but, c'mon, you know I'm going to win because there's only one person who can beat me. Remember Yamamoto? Yeah. Just think about that one for a while.' and then Unohana gets wiped out by an [I apologize to the automoderator for using a verboten word.

I was actually glad that we got to see a bit of her past as Kenpachi, and the two of them having some kind of implied love story wasn't so bad.  It's just that... she could be so much more.

The young captains throw their bankai and wave their ultimate power around recklessly, and that's why they all got their powers stolen at the beginning of the arc.  The more experienced fighters sit back and gauge their opponents strength and the situation before putting themselves (their powers will greatly diminish if Bankai breaks) or comrades (Bankai can be extremely hard to control) or environment (the pure reitsu of the release in the human world distorts beings from miles away in FKT) at risk.  Their idea with Aizen was to ""wear him down"" so his reitsu would run out, i.e. they wouldn't have to deal with his extraordinarily OP power. All of them releasing bankai would be the equivalent of them taking out rocket launchers and firing blindly.   There was literally no viable strategic strategy other than trying to run Aizen out of energy and finish him off, or Yama's suicide-incinerate-everything-ensuring-we-get-him-approach.

He always fought against the ideology that one has. And he still has no idea what is Yhwach's. Why all this. I expect him to not resort to bankai until he learns that.

I don't have the chapters at hand, but Ichigo basically says that ""He only felt loneliness in his[Aizen's] sword, it must've been hard for him, living with no equal as a man both wiser and stronger than all others. He said that the power of Hogyoku is to materialize one's wish. Maybe deep down he actually wished to become just a normal shiningami."" It's the known story of a genius who becomes an idiot to find a friend.   What builds on that is his attitude through the series. One of the best known scenes is his ascend to Hecuo Mundo as well as numerous acts of arrogance during battles.   Aizen is a desperate character. His power distanced him away from the rest, but instead of feeling lost like Starrk, he found that there is something that belongs to him. The position above everyone.

Whenever Mayuri is involved, it always seems that he has the perfect plan to deal with an enemy, because he observed them beforehand somehow. Against Szayelaporro, he had the spy bacteria in Ishida reveal the arrancar's trick, and so he replaced his organs. Then, against Giselle and Zombie Bambie, he called upon his own zombies and anti-zombie measures, in addition to the reiatsu delay device he developed for Bambie's explosions.  With Ichigo and Co. worrying about Pernida's ability, considering it effortlessly tore apart Yoruichi's arm, I have a feeling Mayuri Ex Machina will come into play and effortlessly tear Pernida apart because Kon was there.  e: it wasn't Mayuri who put the camera there, but Urahara.

bleach,3b8rfc,Alluka-,2,Fri Jun 26 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's supposed to hide them from Hollow and Shinigami. That's how Urahara remained undetected. I mean they should make them look different, at least in the face, because you never know when some dude from your squad might show up and see you, Rukia, you dumb stupid bitch.  But it's for the show, you don't want to keep seeing these people take different forms in and out of their gigai, it makes you lose that constant connection to their character, who they really are, if you see them a lot in their different looking gigai.  It would be like if people saw how I looked outside of Scarlet Blade. I'm a dude, not some sexy, fit, strong, voluptuous asian amazon warrior with triple D's."

bleach,3b6lwv,Chrome166,12,Fri Jun 26 11:45:55 2015 UTC,"We don't know Orihime isn't a Fullbringer. She very likely is, considering her abilities match the description of a Fullbring exactly. Also, after the Fullbring arc Kubo started drawing her Rikka with Bringer Light.  Note that her hairpins have changed shape. For a Fullbringer, that's the sign of them mastering their Fullbring. So I think perhaps in the past her hairpins might've held her back, but now that they're mastered they would be as helpful as a Shikai. It's true that if a Fullbringer's entire Fullbring is destroyed then they lose their powers, but I think there's got to be an intrinsic connection to the Hollow power which manifested as their Fullbring, hence the fact that they have the power, not their parents who were the ones attacked by Hollows. So I think if they were to get a hold of some more Hollow Reiryoku, they could easily create a new Fullbring as a Shinigami does with an Asauchi.  My theory is that because of this intrinsic connection, a Fullbringer could have a Hollow soul put inside them, and they would be able to fight with it for control, rather than it instantly devouring their entire soul as it would for a regular human. And I think Urahara has done so, giving Orihime and Chad actual Hollow powers. Their Fullbrings would fuse with it, granting them a pretty high level of control over their inner Hollows. If that were the case, then Orihime would be able to use some technique on the same level as Bankai and Resurreccion to grant her Shun Shun Rikka their own bodies, or perhaps even fuse with them.  Regarding Riruka, her Fullbring is probably actually her heart, and its ability is the pass that she grants people to force them into objects. It'd be weird, but no more weird than Chad's being his skin."
bleach,3b6lwv,Andygoesrawr,4,Fri Jun 26 12:10:34 2015 UTC,"Also, after the Fullbring arc Kubo started drawing her Rikka with Bringer Light.   I've gotten into debates about this because I think she's a Fullbringer, but that light can't be called Bringer Light based on its appearance.  Kubo also drew the same kind of light on Isane's hand while she was healing Rose and Kensei in her barrier.  Which makes it a generic kind of light that Fullbring appears similar to. It can't be used as evidence of Fullbring since it can just as easily be some other kind of spell.   Note that her hairpins have changed shape. For a Fullbringer, that's the sign of them mastering their Fullbring.   We haven't had confirmation a Fullbring's basic form changed shape once mastered.  We haven't seen a Fullbring item or released form before and after mastery except for Ichigo's badge, but we couldn't get a clear view of the badge after he mastered it to tell if it really had changed."

It can't be used as evidence of Fullbring since it can just as easily be some other kind of spell.   I agree, it's not proof, but just an additional point. Kubo actually draws quite a lot of energy that way, but I just think the fact that he only started doing it for Orihime after introducing Bringer Light says something.   We haven't had confirmation a Fullbring's basic form changed shape once mastered.  We haven't seen a Fullbring item or released form before and after mastery except for Ichigo's badge, but we couldn't get a clear view of the badge after he mastered it to tell if it really had changed.   Ichigo's badge definitely changed shape. This is it before mastery, and this is it after mastery. Chad's Fullbring also changed shape once he learned the true purpose of his right arm.  The sealed form doesn't change shape, but for Orihime she doesn't really have a ""release"". Her Rikka can be released individually, which makes me think they're a sort of constant release. Riruka and Yukio would be the same.  Or it could be indicative of the Hollow powers I theorised she might now have."
bleach,3b6lwv,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:09:43 2015 UTC,"Her rikka's released form would just be the activated form. So, when they are summoned as fairies, it is released. In the same way Kyoka Suigetsu doesn't really have a released form, it just has an activated state and that activated state is the released form.  Yukio fits into that as well, but Riruka is the odd one out. Her powers are not based on any object or any one thing. She herself activates and casts the power.   That's unheard of. She's not entering a special form or anything, Riruka, by herself, has fully active spiritual powers.  They better not let Aizen see her. He'd Gonzui her so fast."
bleach,3b6lwv,Fearless-Fairness,2,Fri Jun 26 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"That's why I think Riruka's Fullbring is actually her heart. Imprinting on an object takes a lot of time, and based on how Fullbrings work it's basically impossible for her to have so many of them. It's gotta be her heart -- which sucks if she ever wants to get rid of her Fullbring. Though I don't see that happening."
bleach,3b6lwv,Andygoesrawr,2,Fri Jun 26 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"The recurring theme with all powers seems to be that each person already has a power inside them. The objects and powers (Fullbring, Quincy using reishi, Shinigami use Zanpakuto, Hollows use their heart+Zanpakuto) they use are just mediums to express the ability they already have.  Since the Karakurizers were in the omakes, that should mean they are canon. Which means all of Ichigo's friends, just like Hitsugaya as a child, can use their powers without having a medium to express them (I also think having a medium makes the power stronger)  So, it's fine that Riruka has no central object for her Fullbring. It may just be like how Ichigo gets stronger whenever he combines two of his powers together. Riruka's (and anyone else's) natural ability is just strengthened when they add another power into the mix."

bleach,3b6lwv,Purona,0,Sat Jun 27 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, apparently I had picked up some misinformation somewhere about Orihime not being a Fullbringer. Now that I know it's possible, I definitely agree that she's most likely a Fullbringer. If I had to guess, I would say her Fullbring is her imagination, and that's how her Shun Shun Rikka can be sentient (at least to her).  That theory about a Hollow soul being compatible with a Fullbringer is very interesting, and I would think that could be a great way for Fullbringer powers to exceed the natural limitation of a Fullbringer always operating at maximum potential once their Fullbring is fully developed. Although, if Orihime's Fullbring is her imagination, that could bypass the natural limitations in an entirely different way."
bleach,3b6lwv,materhern,2,Fri Jun 26 18:25:57 2015 UTC,I've thought this for a while now.  I think they do hold her back and that her power may not be like any others in the series.  Its too bad they never explored it further.  But maybe thats a good think since Kubo made it completely OP.  You can't have a world in which any event can just be rejected out right.
bleach,3b6lwv,yukeake,2,Fri Jun 26 11:52:41 2015 UTC,"Quincy apparently manifest all of their weapons out of Reishi, although it seems that Yhwach and Haschwalt carry physical swords as well. I would imagine this is because they need some sort of weapon to protect themselves when they don't have Yhwach's powers at a given time.    As of this week's chapter, we may have a reason why Haschwald carries a sword, and why we've never seen him manifest a spirit weapon.  What exactly that has to do with his role wrt Yhwach isn't really clear yet.  As for Yhwach, I think it's very interesting that Ichibei made a specific point of removing its name.  This implies that it's not a ""normal"" sword.  We were speculating a while back that it may have been a zanpakuto.  As more of Yhwach's past is revealed, we may get more info on that.   However, we know she isn't a Fullbringer   I'm not sure it's ever been stated either way.  It was certainly implied during the Fullbring arc that both she and Chad were Fullbringers - but while Chad was outright confirmed, Orihime never was.  The only inconsistency I can see with her powers being a Fullbring is that the faeries she manifests from the hairpins appear to be sentient - like zanpakuto spirits - which is something we didn't see with any of the other Fullbrings."
bleach,3b6lwv,yukeake,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:09:12 2015 UTC,"I thought Ichibei was removing Yhwach's name, not his sword's.

I have a feeling that he will have releases and power-ups just like shinigami and hollows (and quincy), which will manifest his powers on a higher level.  The degree to which his appearence becomes more hollow-like is up in the air.  Just by looking at the fact that he used a black getsuga in shikai... it seems obvious that he can probably access all of his powers without the mask."
bleach,3b7d22,MrSterlock,2,Fri Jun 26 15:58:51 2015 UTC,Well ichigo thinks of his hollow powers as a requirement in battle rather than taking pride in it which is why he hasn't ever even tried to train to control his vasto lorde form... and as of now he has his quincy powers as well as hollow powers so to give a direct answer I don't find any reason why he wouldn't be able to but at the same time he doesn't need to anymore ... hope it helps

Turns out that what we called Hollow Ichigo was the true Zangetsu, the other one being his Quincy powers. Once he accepted his dual nature both of these manifested in their true form, or at least his Quincy ones did, since he can now use Blut. So I would expect that the Mask is no longer in play, but he has access to the full arsenal of the Hollows (Ceros, Sonido and even the Vasto Lorde form, who knows). So we know he is now a Shinigami, and that the true Zangetsu is now his Twin Blades (also, side note, this make Ichigo the third person in the whole story with duals, the other ones being his godfather and the CC), we know he has Quincy powers (Blut and all that), so it wouldn't be out of place to think he can use his Hollow powers. But I reckon the mask regardless is out of play."

bleach,3b7d22,PeaceMainPirate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:03:57 2015 UTC,"the answer is yes, however if we consider that OMZ told Ichigo he was only using 1/10 of he's powers, then Ichigo is 9 times stronger, and we would have to add ""having a real zanpakto"" to the strength levels as well, in the end that should amount to very few enemies, that ichigo would even need to use the mask against, Ywach, hashwalth, bazz, ichibei, aizen, uryu? and most likely some of the prisoners in mugen aswell."
bleach,3b7d22,Wonderbotz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:48:48 2015 UTC,Haha actually mathematically it's 10 times more powerful. 10/10 is ten times as much as 1/10.  But yes maybe there's no need for the mask.

Mangastream says one hadn't been born for hundreds of years, Bazz also says that Ywach is at least 200 years old at this point.

bleach,3b1s6e,Hichigo,18,Thu Jun 25 12:57:31 2015 UTC,"I mean other half as in the capacity he fills now. When Yhwach sleeps, Haschwalth gains his power. It's not like Haschwalth was born with that power, otherwise he would be super powerful at night rather than sucking all the time. I'm suggesting Yhwach is looking into the future and seeing Haschwalth's great potential, which is why he selects him to be his ""other half""."
bleach,3b1s6e,Hichigo,13,Thu Jun 25 12:59:41 2015 UTC,Fairo. Could the fact that he's one of the 'incomplete Quincy' allow him to fill that role or is it just a bit of background information on Haschwalth?
bleach,3b1s6e,Hichigo,15,Thu Jun 25 13:11:51 2015 UTC,"I'm betting ""incomplete Quincies"" are actually Gemischt Quincies. They were rare back then because Yhwach converted every single person in his kingdom into an Echt Quincy, and killed anybody who dissented or slept with a human.  If so, Yhwach probably has a thing for Gemischt Quincies with extremely high potential, i.e. Jugram and Uryuu. Maybe being a Gemischt Quincy is important, but I'm not sure."

Ichigo was the same way with both his Shinigami and Quincy powers. Both of them required being jumpstarted by a pure Shinigami and a pure Quincy respectively."

Ywach and Haschwalth are each others 'half' and when Haschwalth said earlier his powers switches with Ywach makes me think Haschwalth is as much as Ichigos zanpaktou as Ywach is. Really enjoying how Kubo isn't forgetting past characters such as the dead quincy shown during the old mans bankai.

So it's not his half but more like biach to take care of his chores during off business hours.   I'm interested in future chapters where Ywach marks Letters on these sternreiters."

bleach,3b1s6e,jextacy,7,Thu Jun 25 07:54:32 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. It said that he is an incomplete Quincy. How can an incomplete Quincy resist Yhwach's power when loads of other ""full"" Quincy couldn't?"
bleach,3b1s6e,sageshadows7,25,Thu Jun 25 12:00:03 2015 UTC,Because he's special.
bleach,3b1s6e,Nnoitrum,11,Thu Jun 25 12:08:34 2015 UTC,Because he has a hole that can take Yhwachs power without overloading.  If he can't even gather his reishi maybe it nerfs JBs power to a point that he won't accidentally squish the planet.
bleach,3b1s6e,HomelessBoxBoy,10,Thu Jun 25 12:17:00 2015 UTC,"Shit. Maybe he's like some sort of anti-Quincy, a power nullifier. Might explain how he bypassed Cang Du's Iron."

bleach,3b1s6e,Cykon,8,Thu Jun 25 13:33:39 2015 UTC,"So he's like Ichigo, except Quincy as a main power instead of Shinigami.  Damn, now Haschwalth has to be the final boss."
bleach,3b1s6e,NigNogMasterrace,6,Thu Jun 25 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. With The Almighty, Yhwach could see his future with Hashbrowns and conclude he would be the most beneficial to him. It'd make no sense for him to allow something that threatens the existence of a Quincy's soul. Furthermore, it's incredibly likely that through Deus Ex Machina No Jutsu, Ichigo will slay Yhwach, so Hashbrowns being a Hollow would be an unnecessary plot twist.  Edit: I missed the sarcasm"
bleach,3b1s6e,KittyScratcher,4,Thu Jun 25 14:02:20 2015 UTC,I was being incredibly facetious. Haschwalth is pretty obviously not a Hollow.

He might be Gemischt, since Ichigo was in the same boat where he's always been incredibly powerful but had no Quincy abilities at all until after he absorbed some of Quilge's Reiatsu.

Maybe it's because I played the new one before the others, idk, but I liked it a lot actually. It stands at one of the higher reviewed games in the franchise (via IGN, who I use for just about everything before buying a game) and it was actually quite fun, it showed the interesting opposite-twins Vergil and Dante, and Vergil's downfall was one of the best DLC's I've ever played. I LOVED the artistic style used in it.  At the same time, I can completely understand why franchise fans hated it. It was a swift departure from what had defined the previous games and it lacked a lot of the stuff that made the previous games popular, and they sold out Dante to be a punk/emo guy (though I don't necessarily like either Dante more than the other. I did like the reboot version of Vergil, however). SO yeah, I can completely understand why people hated it.  Also, I suggest you look into the concept art for DMC. It almost looks like the game was going to have a completely different style, concept, and plot originally, and then drastically changed course last minute. It was still fun to look at though!"

Ichigo of course, is the ""hero"" and always tries to do the ""right"" thing - but I expect his resolve to be tested at some point by finding out those he's sided with aren't really the ""good guys"" he thought they were.  I don't expect Yhwach or Aizen to ever be portrayed as ""good"", mind you - but I could see the events of the past portraying the various factions in a much different light than we've seen thusfar."

You're making the mistake of taking all dialogue to be canon -- remember that Aizen, right before being sealed away, was losing it. He's a man with a plan, and always has been. He has plans A-Z covered, and then cycles through every other alphabet he can think of, that's how many fall-back plans he prepares.  Ichigo was a genuine shock to him, and had him clasping at straws. When Ichigo's reiatsu surpassed Aizen's so much he became impossible to detect spiritually, Aizen accused Ichigo of completely discarding his spiritual pressure in exchange for raw physical strength out of denial.  When the hogyoku pushed Aizen beyond what he could physically handle and burned him out as he was trying to keep up with Ichigo, his zanpakuto disintegrated. Remember, he merged with it when he was at the peak of his strength, just as Ichigo did -- but when he lost his blade, it was as he weakened.  The same Aizen who stated that he merged with his zanpakuto was the same Aizen who stated that Ichigo had discarded his own spiritual pressure, the same Aizen who emphasised that he could not be sealed with kidou... right before being sealed by kidou."

It means that he has to be a more interesting character than just a bad guy. If you just can't do something, then there's no topic. But if you choose not to, there must be some sort of motivation.  The downside is, it does pose greater challenge to Kubo and risks adding plotholes to the storyline if executed poorly. Hopefully, Kubo will show off and give us a well tough-out storyline."

bleach,3b2ms5,Gexican,26,Thu Jun 25 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"Ichigo's first sword is stylistically a cross between Rukia's zanpakutou and Isshin's (which we don't know until later on in the story). It's appearance is probably due to the power he gained from Rukia and Isshin's influence on Ichigo's soul. Zangetsu. Ichigo learns the name of his zanpaktou and meets the zanpakutou spirit. Unbeknownst to Ichigo at the time, neither the sword or the spirit are actually Zangetsu. The sword's appearance is unfinished, as Tessai or Jinta pointed out upon first seeing it (can't remember who exactly said what). It's unfinished appearance is probably evidence of Ichigo's Quincy powers not completely wanting to share the shinigami powers with Ichigo.  Tensa Zangetsu is completely black. Probably because of Zangetsu's completely unique origin. Remember that the Hollow that became Ichigo's shinigami powers was completely black, too. It's also unique for the various reason Byakuya pointed out. Again, probably because of it's unique origin. This is still my favorite one, too.  this form. I don't know what to make of this other than it's fused with his hand, which Aizen suggested might be the true form of a zanpakutou. Idk. New Shikai. It still appears unfinished, but, it has a better handle and somewhat of a guard. It also resembles Yhwach's sword (which we don't realize until later in the story). It also resembles his Fullbring appearance. This seems to be ""Zangetsu"" allowing more of Ichigo's real power to slip through. New Bankai. I think ""Zangetsu"" letting more power slip through is more evident in Ichigo's newer bankai. The blade itself resembles his current shikai. It's shape is very similar to the Hollow's arms. Current Ichigo. Ichigo's zanpakutou forged from an actual Asauchi. They seem to be a reflection of both his Quincy and Shinigami/Hollow powers. We haven't seen the bankai yet."
bleach,3b2ms5,Aaroniero,6,Thu Jun 25 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"Regarding 5 and 6 - I suspect these are forms created from ""memory"" of the two sides of Ichigo's powers.  The Shikai resembles Yhwach's blade (sans hilt/guard) and the Bankai resembles White's sword-arms.  We know from Quirge's jail that the soul ""remembers"" - after fully expending his reiatsu, Ichigo drew in reiatsu from his environment, and the interaction with the Quincy reiatsu from the cage with his own made his soul ""remember"" his Quincy heritage - thus explaining his instinctive use of blut vene.  Ichigo's state prior to Fullbring was that he'd ""burnt-out"" his spirits with FGT/Mugetsu.  From the time he does this, to the forging, there's no contact whatsoever with his internal spirits.  This seems highly unusual to me.  Unless, that is, he'd really burnt out his zanpakuto spirit - and thus no longer had access to it.    Rukia stabs him with the reiatsu blade, which re-activates his reaitsu ""engine"".  He then instinctively reaches for his Shinigami powers.  His soul remembers, but the spirit...isn't there.  Enter Fullbring.  Fullbring draws forth the ""souls"" of inanimate objects.  Ichigo's Fullbring had been mostly removed, but a small portion of it remained.  Subconciously, Ichigo uses his Fullbring to construct a ""zanpakuto"" from his soul's memory - both of what his zanpakuto was (general form) and what his spirits were (specific forms resembling Yhwach/White).  The result is Ichigo essentially acting like a Shinigami again - but with a husk of a zanpakuto.  Notice how easily Haschwald breaks Tensa Zangetsu?  Seemingly without using any sort of power - he just snaps it with his fingers.  While Haschwald's undoubtedly very strong, should he be that far above Ichigo?  I think it's more likely that ""Tensa Zangetsu"" was brittle, because it wasn't the ""real"" Tensa Zangetsu at that point.   IIRC there's also a bit with Ivan earlier where parts of Ichigo's outfit (the ones unique to his post-Fullbring form) seem brittle as well.  Of course, all of that is moot now, since after the forging Ichigo has a fresh imprint, on a proper Asauchi, and on top of that has merged OMZ directly into the in-process blade(s).  I doubt we'll get a real explanation for the post-Fullbring pre-forging oddities - but it's fun to speculate."

bleach,3b2ms5,Aaroniero,5,Thu Jun 25 16:50:25 2015 UTC,Ah. I would assume that's his shikai since that would follow the natural progression of things. No real reason to think otherwise.
bleach,3b2ms5,ElModeloEnPace,2,Thu Jun 25 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"That and we haven't seen him activate his Bankai, so it would only make sense he was using his shikai."
bleach,3b2ms5,LucciDVergo,7,Thu Jun 25 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"I think I can start this off by stating the big reason, Ichigo's Zanpakuto is the only one (literally) that was not created from an Asauchi, his manifested from his internal Hollow/Shingami/Quincy powers to create a Zanpakuto, so already it does not fit the main archetype for what a Shinigami Zan should be."
bleach,3b2ms5,LucciDVergo,2,Thu Jun 25 14:01:40 2015 UTC,Yea i know that he doesn't fit with the trend. I just find myself so lost trying to think of the order of his zan. Especially his bankai
bleach,3b2ms5,yukeake,2,Thu Jun 25 14:18:37 2015 UTC,well he only recently received a new Bankai his Shikai/Bankai were pretty static up until it was broken this arc.
bleach,3b2ms5,yukeake,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"Technically White's remnant served the role of the Asauchi.

bleach,3b2ms5,MetaAmbience,2,Thu Jun 25 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Technically White's remnant was a foreign (soul)body passed along through Masaki into Ichigo.  He was born with it, but in a very technical sense it's not ""of"" him.  It just seems that way since he's had it since birth."
bleach,3b2ms5,MetaAmbience,3,Thu Jun 25 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"So.   Normal form - Substitute shinigami arc. This is just the large zan that he uses during the first few episodes. This weapon is based almost entirely on Rukia's power.  First Shikai - Gained during training with kisuke. Lost after Aizen battle. This is the kitchen knife version we all know and love. This version was created based off of Ichigo's hollow half instead of a normal asouchi template.  First Bankai - Gained in training for Byakuya. Lost after Aizen battle. This is the black sword that looks like a normal zan except black. Again, based on his hollow half. The more he uses it the closer his hollow comes to the surface, as we can see in the Byakuya and Yami battles.  Fullbring Weapon - Gained during Fullbring training. Lost when stolen by Ginjo. This is his full bring weapon drawn out from his combat pass. It changes forms the more he masters it throughout the arc.  Second Shikai - Gained by the Fullbring-arc power transfer. Implied lost after battle with Yhwach. This is the same visually as his first shikai except it has a couple spikes along the blade. Was activated by all who put energy in the transfer blade, may be fullbring-enhanced.  Second Bankai - Gained by the Fullbring-arc power transfer. Lost after battle with Yhwach. Again, basically the same as the old bankai except with two spikes on the blade and different powers involved in the activation process. Dual Shikai - Gained during forging at Royal palace. This is the dual wield version, the right is a smaller, hollowed-out version of his first shikai, as it represents his hollow half. The left is the small blade with the handle in the blade, and represents his quincy half. These zan were properly foged from an asuchi, unlike the earlier once who were forged from his inner hollow, and as a result are much more powerful than previous versions.    And that's it as far as I know. Let me know if I missed any thing."

bleach,3b0qop,NinetyFish,5,Thu Jun 25 08:44:05 2015 UTC,"Star Platinum's punching was only ever used for the finisher. The hell did you read? Every fight in that manga was a puzzle until Jotaro figured out his opponent's powers and used his own creativity and intellect, with Star Platinum's speed and precision to accomplish tricks, to disable his opponents and finish them with the flurry of punches."

While many of the enemy stands might have been cooler, there are often way more antagonists than protagonists.  Ive found that the protagonists often just have more dynamic abilities, while less cool, can just do more based on their balance and dynamics."

bleach,3b0qop,Andygoesrawr,5,Thu Jun 25 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"Fair Enough, but Ichigo's aren't even good. Or interesting. I mean, it gets boring, but I would say most Shounen (that I've read) seem to have the 1A main character, who is the guy we're rooting for, whose power does seem to basically be GOD MODE PUNCH when the time comes, but there seems to often be a 1B/sidekick/mentor/rival/partner who has incredibly interesting powers. Even by the Model outlined above, Ichigo has stupid powers. If I were him I'd be looking to trade just about anyone, even Renji."
bleach,3b0qop,thenewperson1,16,Thu Jun 25 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"But... that's exactly what Ichigo has. He has a god mode sword swing. The only reason most of the time it does nothing is because the power levels keep elevating to force Ichigo to become stronger.  And what? Renji's powers are even worse. His swordwhip might be cool for the first few times, but eventually it'd get just as boring as Getsuga Tenshou. And his old Bankai is even worse... it's made of bones that basically anyone can destroy, it shoots energy balls that do nothing, and it leaves Renji pretty much defenseless.  At least Ichigo's powers scale well. At base he's got good attack, good defense, and good speed. The only thing that needs to change is his power level.  Anyway, I'd argue Bleach isn't really about Ichigo. Half of the time he isn't even in the story, and we focus on more interesting characters."

bleach,3b0qop,angryspacemahreen,3,Thu Jun 25 01:36:41 2015 UTC,"This shows how his powers were different. Technically, he didn't have a Shikai or Bankai. That's why his "" Bankai "" just makes him faster and stronger. His Getsuga Tenshou originates from his Shinigami powers, from Isshin. Then his "" Bankai "" is like the Hollow and Shinigami powers working at the same time. It creates black Getsuga. Ulquiorra said its similar to a hollow's cero. I imagine it was Getsuga Tenshou(Shinigami) + Cero(Hollow)."
bleach,3b0qop,NinetyFish,3,Thu Jun 25 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yea honestly some of the powers in bleach are amazing, but ichigo has got to be the worst main character in manga for me."
bleach,3b0qop,KamakaziJanabi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:32:31 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't work out with Shonen manga where the MC has to be upgraded all the time, I mean, if you gave Ichigo an interesting ability like Ukitake's, shit would get weird with upgrades."
bleach,3b0qop,Chanustheanus,2,Thu Jun 25 11:21:43 2015 UTC,"Shonen manga written by Kubo, maybe. He's never handled Ichigo's character well.  For example, the Nen abilities in Hunter x Hunter never change, by their very definition. They just get better at using them. The scariest villain in HxH (disregarding the King, since the Chimera Ants are literally written to be past humanity's level) is Hisoka, whose two abilities are essentially making strands of sticky rubber and copies of a piece of paper of which Hisoka can control the appearance.  The stand abilities in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure never change (except for in extremely rare, plot-relevant moments); the protagonists just use their abilities in different ways."
bleach,3b0qop,Tom38,2,Thu Jun 25 12:12:41 2015 UTC,"I get it, but seriously you are letting kubo off the hook too Easy, it doesn't need to be uber complex but maybe something for than just a Fucking flying sword slash that never even Fucking worked,    the only thing he did with it that was cool was when he slashed at grimmjow then ran behind him and did another slash sandwhiching him.in, that is literally the coolest thing he's done with his power, he's gotten stronger sure but hos powers hardly ever last ten chapters before he's outclassed again bleach is my least favourite manga just because ichigo is such a bad hero I absolutely love the bleach world.and powers though  he'll if he learned some kidou that would be entertain enough"

bleach,3b0qop,Tcamps_,2,Thu Jun 25 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"Most do not have the most interesting.  Most are not as terribly useless as ichigo.  Strawhat, Naruto, the Alchemist brothers, Kamui (not Shounen, I get it), Goku, etc. all had powers, some of them very interesting."
bleach,3b0qop,dnhyp3rx,12,Thu Jun 25 02:53:47 2015 UTC,"Luffy is an interesting case. His crapton of ""Gomu Gomu No Whatever"" techniques is basically the same thing performed with different speed/body parts. Imagine Ichigo having like 20 ways of using Getsuga.  Goku is out of place in this list. Z and onward it's all about powerlevels, any strategic and interesting techniques are usually trumped by yet another transformation. In the end it is all screaming and shooting same stuff."
bleach,3b0qop,redditrandomacc,7,Thu Jun 25 03:09:48 2015 UTC,"Will agree on final effect, but at least Z made a show of instant transmission and teamwork forming effective strategy before abandoning it to screaming and shooting energy ball.    And it feels like I'm attacking Bleach, which I'm not.  Despite the INCREDIBLY slow pace I think it might be my favorite.  The characters are rounder and more well developed (which probably hurts the pace) and the plot seems driven by actual ideological concerns, even if I can't always put my finger on them.  I like the series.  Just surprised how lame ichigo's powers are when I really thought about them and how they have been used.    As others have said, I'm interested to see if him relying on actual shinigami powers changes any of this, though."
bleach,3b0qop,dnhyp3rx,3,Thu Jun 25 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"How are the characters well developed? Ichigo is still the same punk from the beginning. He goes through the same cycle of thinking he's badass, getting his ass handed to him, mope around, someone comforts him, he regains his resolve and goes train, beats the bad guy and fall into the same cycle the next bad guy. What about Chad? His character hasn't changed either. He wants to help ichigo. There's no character development. He doesn't go through any emotional struggle. Orihime came close to some development when she realized her dependence on ichigo caused him to ""die"" but then the whole situation resolves itself and orihime hasn't shown to be any better since. Don't get me started on rukia or ishida. Point is, bleach characters aren't developed at all. The only thing that improves with time is kubo's artwork"
bleach,3b0qop,SafferCrystal,6,Thu Jun 25 05:16:03 2015 UTC,"Byakuya's had a good arc. And Chad and Orihimie haven't really done anything in years, which I think is probably a lot to do with their stagnation as characters."

bleach,3b0qop,SafferCrystal,2,Thu Jun 25 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"Byakuya has had an excellent arc, so has Renji.  Ikkaku has been surprisingly fantastic.  I think Chad has had decent development (through the Heuco Mundo stuff, at least) and I disagree about Ichigo.  If anything, Ichigo has grown more ""Samurai-esque.""   He understands that he isn't in control of the bigger picture at this point, but he fights for what he believes in.  Even Shunsui, who seems to have grown.  Through the death of Yama Shunsui seems to possess a large power that he constantly holds back on because he believes someone else will step up to the plate.  Finally, we see him forced to take charge and exert himself.  Frankly, I'm excited to see what his best efforts bring."
bleach,3b0qop,ludicrouscuriosity,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:26:13 2015 UTC,"As for the Ichigo part, do you feel that's before or after EBTR? Ichigo had always been fighting for what he believes in from the very start. It's especially evident in the fight between him and Byakuya when they argue about what Byakuya should be doing in the whole Rukia situation. The cycle still continues in this arc where Ichigo fails and feels like shit and someone consoles him; This time being his father with EBTR, as opposed to Rukia in the previous arcs. It doesn't feel like Ichigo has matured and the cycle just stops because the story is coming to a close instead of Ichigo actually changing for the better.  That thing you mentioned with Shunsui is pretty good though."
bleach,3b0qop,detectivekillua,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:28:14 2015 UTC,You can't cherry pick underdeveloped characters like Chad and Orihime and say that Bleach characters are underdeveloped.
bleach,3b0qop,izn1337,3,Thu Jun 25 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"If characters who have the most screen time are underdeveloped, what does that say about those who have barely any? Who would you say are actually developed? In my opinion, the only few I can think of is probably the Kuchiki duo and their character arcs ended with soul society arc and even then, the Rukia one seems debated for me."
bleach,3b0qop,izn1337,2,Thu Jun 25 07:41:37 2015 UTC,"No, Byakuya and Rukia still developed further. Byakuya, as he notes in the fight with Tsukishima, used to be someone who planned all his fights. He believed pure training was the way to win, which meant he had trouble countering attacks if he was surprised. Because of his interaction with Kenpachi, he's realized the value of improvisation in a fight.  Rukia has developed a lot of confidence since the end of the Soul Society arc - she never would have tried for lieutenant otherwise. She's also developed enough confidence that  she had no problem vocally protesting the order to spy on Ichigo to all the captains and the Captain Commander.   Yumichika is another character who's grown as well. At fake Karakura Town, he nearly lost to Charlotte Chuhlhourne because he doesn't want to reveal his true abilities, fearing he'd be kicked out of the 11th if it was known his sword is a kidō type. Now, he's gotten over the fear and has no problems openly using kidō and the true form of his zanpakutō against the Sternritter."
bleach,3b0qop,Alkura,2,Sat Jun 27 22:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted with the Rukia ""development"" because she wasn't properly developed as a character who lacked confidence at any point early in the series. If anything, saying she's gained confidence later on wouldn't be the correct way to define her development. It was only in the final night before her execution that we were shown a bit of her past with Kaien but it doesn't reflect as a weakness for her. The reason why she treats Ichigo the way she does in the Agent of the Shinigami Arc in the beginning is  that it was the way Kaien treated her before; There was nothing wrong with that and it definitely didn't show her as lacking confidence. With the resolution of the Soul Society Arc, she was able to come to terms with Kaien's death and at that point, she could have easily tried for Lieutenant.  What are the changes that happened between Soul Society Arc and the point where she decides to try to lieutenant in the actual story? The battle with Aaroniero where she once again comes to term with Kaien's death? After Soul Society Arc, she was more or less used as a morale booster for Ichigo and the battle with Aaroniero was more of a showcase of her shikai for those who were curious since she was disabled in the beginning."
bleach,3b0qop,Deserak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:53:06 2015 UTC,"The Rukia we see in the Substitute Shinigami arc is not Rukia's current personality, at the time. It's a facade, and I'd argue that it's not until Soul Society that we see Rukia as she really was - an unhappy, melancholy person with no friends, little self confidence, and a huge guilt complex. This is why her character seems to regress in the second arc, when that's not what happened.  One thing I noticed re-reading the early chapters is how secretive Rukia is. She doesn't tell Ichigo any information unless it's necessary, and certainly doesn't let him know the problems she's having. This is at odds with the assertive attitude she shows him, but it makes sense once her life in Soul Society is explained. She's been isolated for a long time without any real friends; Ichigo's the first person she's been close to in a long time. Because Ichigo has no expectations of her and desperately needs training, she can take charge and ignore her burdens, for a time.   What Ichigo does for Rukia during the Soul Society arc is show her that she is someone worth rescuing. Throughout her imprisonment, her constant refrain is that she is not worthy of being saved. In her mind, she deserves execution for what she's done - for causing the death of Kaien, for changing Ichigo's fate, and for being Ichigo's death as well. Remember, at the time Hanatarō meets her, she'd left behind a fatally wounded Ichigo in the rain. Nobody expected him to survive.  Rukia doesn't come to terms with Kaien's death at the end of the Soul Society arc, because that's not not the resolution she gets. Instead, she learns from Renji that Ichigo is glad he met Rukia, because his new shinigami powers give him the ability to protect others now. She hasn't changed his fate for the worse, but for the better. She finds out she actually does have friends that care for her, and a family in Byakuya. From all of this, she finally has the courage to face the Shiba family, and apologize."

He's only gone fullspeed a few times though. Curb stomped speedwise each time, but since he shattered dozens of his own bones from gforces which slowed him back down and nearly lost him the fight (he's only gone fullspeed again since regaining his power).

People look so much at the destructive power of yamas bankai but completely ignore that aizens shikai is the perfect weapon to uise against it. Why do you think yama would not use it in his fight against aizen before his powers were sealed. Because destructive power was not what yama was lacking. He had enough power in his shikai to destroy aizen If he could only find him. Using his bankai in that fight would have been a detriment to yamamoto, because his bankai can burn out and kill everyone in the surrounding area, including himself.  I think aizen did not want to fight yama on equal terms beacuse he knew victory was not guaranteed considering yamas destructive power. That does not mean that victory was not likely. Aizens smart, if he only has a 70% chance to win he is not going into that fight, he comes up with a plan to give himself 100% chance of victory.   And we have not even seen aizens bankai.   Tldr. kyoka suigetsu is the perfect weapon against yamas bankai. Aizen can have yama chasing his own shadows until he burns out and dies, thats why he did not use it, he needed a way to find aizen and his bankai offered only destructive power.  kyoka suigetsu op.   now call me a fanboy you herretics. aizen shikai>yama bankai."

He was arrogant, self-assured and to a degree narcissistic, and it bit him in the ass.

Especially when you've had them for millennia.  But considering how it went down, I don't think it would've made a real difference. Yhwach totally outmaneuvered him in that confrontation. The Royd/Lloyd distraction, the medallion, etc.  tl;dr Gramps was old and change comes slow. And Yhwach pulled an Aizen on him."

bleach,3b3plg,eightNote,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"he still wrecks with shikai though; he's just not quite good enough to fight against his own bankai.  aizen prevented him from using shikai, and ukitake/shunsui figured they'd probably lose against yama's shikai."
bleach,3b3plg,bobdylan777,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"Yamamoto was far from weak without his Bankai.  A swing of his Shikai was enough to turn a captain-class opponent (Driscoll) to ash, and a later swing nearly killed 3 captain-class opponents in one go (As Nodt, NaNaNa, Bazz-B).  It was only narrowly stopped by Bazz-B's flames pushing back Yamamoto's.  He was shown faster than Shunsui who kept up with Starrk, and he was physically strong enough to shatter released Wonderweiss with a punch.  He also demonstrated the highest known Hado to date, showing impressive Kido skill."
bleach,3b3plg,richiegraine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:25:48 2015 UTC,He was only no match because they just about killed himself containing his own power. I feel like people keep forgetting Aizen forced him to be handicapped in that fight because the whole purpose of Wonderwiess is to take the flames and explode once he's defeated so that Yama will throw himself in harms way and make him no longer a real threat due to his injuries. The plan was genius and I dare say fool proof considering who we're dealing with.
bleach,3b3plg,Rocksbury,2,Sun Jun 28 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yama was the strongest living Shinigami in existence. Minus tricks and subversion he one vs one would take down any and all characters in Bleach RG included. It was said and no one has contradicted the fact that he was the strongest and nothing that was nearly as strong had been born yet.  Aizen was not simply Shinigami, Ichigo same deal, Yhwach is nearing God status.  I will say Yama couldnt beat Final Aizen simply because what was requited. Ichigo had to surpass evolving Aizen to prove to the Hogyoku Aizen was not worthy. Yama would of just smash his face in until he got tired and Aizen healed and ended Yama.  http://i.imgur.com/EsoRbgM.png  ...Plottwist. Even though I think Yama is the strongest Kenpachi might actually be some kind of creature beyond normal Shinigami meaning he could be stronger."
bleach,3b3plg,yukeake,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"Transcendent-Post-Hogyoku-Aizen (Mullet-form onwards) was an order of magnitude more powerful than anyone in the series up to that point, other than Transcendent-Post-Dangai-Ichigo.  Chair-Aizen?  We don't really know.  We've seen him do some reiatsu manipulation, manipulate Yhwach's sense of time, and cast a couple kido - that's it.  We don't know exactly how powerful he'd be if unrestrained, or even what his current powerset is (KS' state post-FGT is still unclear).  I'd guess that Aizen's current raw reiatsu output is as high if not higher than Yama's was.  That other ""normal"" Shinigami can sense it means he's no longer at the ""transcendent"" level that he was during Deicide.  He's certainly at the high-end of ""normal"" Shinigami output, and he obviously has a lot more control of it than the usual Shinigami does - using reiatsu alone to crush Yhwach's little eyeball-dudes, for example.  Him vs. Yama would really come down to tactics and planning.  A fair fight would favor Yama's straightforward all-offense fighting style - but Aizen's not about ""fair"".  Given time to plan, Aizen would very likely have the upper hand."
bleach,3b3plg,Teamkilleryo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Current Aizen is still transcendant based on Urahara's comment that he might've gotten stronger in the Muken.  They can't really feel his reiatsu as much as they can feel the effects it has on the air and the environment. Just like no one can feel Dangai Ichigo's reiatsu, but you're gonna feel the hurt if he fucks you up with one of those wind slashes"

He would have just done the same to Yamamoto's fire since his reiatsu was transcendent beyond what Shinigami are capable of.  He even destroyed the Cleaner, a ""being of logic"" beyond Shinigami and spirit energy.  The only characters in a similar position were Dangai Ichigo and arguably current Yhwach.  His Bankai is really strong, but West only stops physical attacks, it wouldn't stop transfer of energy.  Aizen stomps Yamamoto with Fragor."

bleach,3b3plg,rigaj,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:54:52 2015 UTC,Still believe there is a historical reason yama lost this time. We'll find out soon enough how he defeated yhwach with the almighty activated.
bleach,3b3plg,Teamkilleryo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:21:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly the most likely reason I can think of is cause Yhwach didn't have enough time to utilize it with the instakill potential and all. It's possible that if he was significantly weaker back then (you know because there was 1000 years of Quincies dying and passing on their powers to him)  It still took a little bit of time for him to shake off Ichibei's ink after getting hit. So something that would instakill most things like Yamamoto's bankai could...kill him.  As for who is stronger between Yama and Aizen, it's probably Aizen. Who would win in a fight? Aizen no question. Even if he isn't stronger, he's immortal."
bleach,3b3plg,rigaj,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:54:06 2015 UTC,What always concerned me was this: is the hogyoku indestructible? How would it resist 15 million degrees?

It might be the sun's core temp but the sun is so ""strong"" cause it's massive. Thermonuclear reactions all reach upwards of a few million degrees, flashing to 100 mil for an instant actually. So anyone who is city level durability (or can tank a hydrogen bomb grade attack) or whatever should be able to get through it, maybe with damage, but still should be able to get through it.  Bleach: Higher reiatsu nullifies all."
bleach,3b3plg,MrSterlock,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:58:53 2015 UTC,"Aizen WAS already stronger than Yama during Decide.  The reason that Aizen was afraid of Yamamoto was that he hadn't evolved.

It is only capable of releasing potential that is already there... let's put it this way. The destructive force post-Hogyoku Aizen exhibited in his ravaging of the local environment was easily matched by Kenpachi's obliteration of that city-sized meteor... which he jumped at at one shotted.  With his reiatsu-limiting eyepatch still on.  I'm not saying that to imply Kenpachi is stronger. I truthfully don't know. I'm just saying, Bleach's power levels are far more balanced than the majority of shounen, which is the reason I posed the question of Yama's strength relative to Aizen's in the first place.  Aizen is more like Batman than Superman. He's damn strong and at the peak of his potential, but it's his planning which carries him the furthest."

If you recall back to the arrancar arc, he covertly placed spy bacteria in him, so he likely has enough on him to specifically counter whatever is thrown his way.

On Namek we were told Frieza had destroyed his planet, and forced him into captivity under the threat of murdering his family (which he did anyway).

As it stands Aizen was born tremendously strong, pushed himself to the top, and chased power/knowledge. He arrogantly wanted to become God. If there is no further backstory then he will be left as a power hungry egomaniac, which doesnt really leave any room for an interesting history.   Also the trend of the 3 defectors was revenge - Kaname wanted to avenge his love, as did Gin. Considering Aizen's emotional outburst it's likely he has SOME motivation for revenge."

bleach,3ay1yr,kingofdabz,9,Wed Jun 24 20:58:30 2015 UTC,He probably had a normal life but with the downside of being so much stronger and smarter than the people around him so he probably thought I might as be lonely and the best of the best than be lonely and mediocre. I mean he doesn't strike me as someone who has lost loved ones to a soul society related tragedy. I could see him accidentally killing childhood friends or his family though due to an insane power he didn't realize he had.
bleach,3ay1yr,richiegraine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"man , even yamamoto and others were insanely strong , but they didnt turn aizen in any way . if that is the only cause , then i will find it a little lame (and it would mean that ichigo has already told us his past) ... i mean , he could have had friends if he wanted (like the other captains and shinigami who admired him) but that doesnt seem to be the problem . and he was pretty enraged with the way the world functions and seems to hate a lot the soul king , so im guessing something tragic happened ."
bleach,3ay1yr,oetsuthebest,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:55:32 2015 UTC,Idk I was just guessing but you might be right. He probably had someone special taken from him.

I think his morality came from his loneliness, where he believed power to be the ultimate dictator of who is right, but the Soul King and his role comes into play with his goal."

I do hope we learn juuuust a bit more, something that is directly connected to the SK/the current story - (why become a shinigami? why despise the soul king like he did?)   Yhwach's hate = SK's son -> past stuff these flashbacks might shed light on -> Kill SK  Aizen's hate = ? -> Shinigami -> Keikaku -> Kill SK (but our favorite candy shop owner seemingly put an end to that idea)"
bleach,3ay1yr,whatacrappyusername,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:50:33 2015 UTC,I think he must have been isolated from the time he entered the soul-society. No one seems to really know anything about him. He has no family that we know of. He had some followers but not any real friends.  Despite his talents he seemed to have taken his time going through the academy as Gin and Toshiro were mentioned as the two that graduated from the academy the quickest. But he showed enough talent to get himself gradually promoted to captain.
bleach,3ay1yr,_megitsune_,2,Wed Jun 24 19:15:01 2015 UTC,Aizen probably planned that to prevent anyone from taking too much notice of him.

Ginjo is in the SS with his two buds and they come across Aien who has been stashed away somewhere for safe keeping.  Either the book dude uses his power to insert himself into the past, having made the lock and therefor has the keys, or the time dude uses his power to deterirate the seals, either way they free him....all according to plan."

bleach,3axyy5,jetman209,3,Thu Jun 25 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"easiest way to think of it is fullbringer comes from the soul (it's another form of spiritual powers), when you die you are just a soul, no reason why your powers should leave you"
bleach,3axyy5,LucciDVergo,2,Thu Jun 25 02:03:45 2015 UTC,Also it was implied they trained with Ganju and Kukaku who helped ichigo and the others learn about spiritual control so maybe that helped the re-focus their powers.
bleach,3axyy5,hatrickstar,3,Thu Jun 25 12:37:53 2015 UTC,"Cutting Yhwach would mean getting real close, which is nigh on impossible with Haschwalth so close.   As for their whereabouts, Ginjo, Tsukishima and ""Time tells no lies dude"" were last seen training with Ganju. Their appearance will probably be a huge twist.

bleach,3axyy5,oetsuthebest,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"As far as we know, they're still at Kuukaku's. I expected them to come along with Ganju, but since they haven't, I have no idea when they could show up. They said that the elite sternritters went in 5 different directions, so maybe they'll show up to intercept one of them?  And as for Tsukishima, I guess he technically could, but Bleach is all about reiatsu, so Ywach would just probably shrug off his ability the same way Suzumebachi didn't affect Aizen."
bleach,3axyy5,Direktorman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:33:30 2015 UTC,"I still think the best time to include them happened after ichigo went up and the sternritters and shinigami were fighting. Tsukishima's power could have been really hilarious to use on Pepe. Time guy could have been a good match for Gissele during the whole mayuri thing, and Ginjo + Renji vs bazz-b and nanana could have been fun.   I personally think their reappearance will have something to do with aizen.  Its implied that Hitsugaya and the rest of the zombies were left in SS and we arent sure of their zombie status anyway. Kubo could also use this as a prime opportunity to bring back Kira (i dunno maybe kukaku helped him and gave him a prosthetic arm since she has one) since aizen and possibly masumoto and Rose are around."

Giselle might raise the zombie shinigami.  -Nel and Grimmjow fight Askin  -A wounded BG9 and an even more wounded NaNaNa find each other, then try to attack a wandering Yachiru.

We might get panels on who the elites will fight but it isn't too likely but there's a good chance we'll see GG and Glutton use the distraction Bazz is giving them to go and assassinate a sleeping king that may or may not be actually sleep.

bleach,3atpd8,fellatious_argument,28,Tue Jun 23 21:03:41 2015 UTC,"His strength doesn't seem to be too high up there honestly, it's his unrivaled intelligence that makes him such a frightening opponent.   He's only ever gone into battles he knew he could win and/or had a plan that was multiple steps ahead of his opponent (even Aizen - as was already stated, Urahara really did end up being the one to capture Aizen).   He doesn't seem the type to be tied up by the pride that holds back many of the others - in that regard, he's much like Kyoraku. He's not above sneak attacks from behind as long as it gets the job done or furthers his overall plan, which makes sense seeing as he used to be in the Onmitsukidō.   I personally think his overall power and reiatsu are not on par with Kyoraku, and especially Ukitake (since his reiatsu was apparently quite large, as revealed during his Kamikake), but his intelligence is still far greater than both.   All of that being said... I think that given enough time and observation, Urahara could likely compete with almost anyone on the roster. Almost anyone."

So, his Hakuda and Hoho skills are very high. He switched places with his portable gigai and also slipped the kido cuffs onto Aizen, both without Aizen noticing.  It would seem his friendship with Tessai has given him advanced knowledge of kido. That, combined with his own intelligence, gives him the ability to use kido well above what the other Captains have shown. Performing a level 90 spell is a great feat.   Besides that, he's just a plain genius.  For geniuses, their combat potential isn't completely limited by their power. They can think of attacks that don't require a large amount of power to work."
bleach,3atpd8,Sirocco_,22,Tue Jun 23 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, his Kidou ability was so advanced to the extent that he was able to chain multiple high level Kidou and Bakudou without incantation."

bleach,3atpd8,thenewperson1,9,Tue Jun 23 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd expect most captains to actually know a lot of spells (even high level ones). Executing them + chaining them is quite a different story, and pretty laudable."
bleach,3atpd8,Fearless-Fairness,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:50:21 2015 UTC,The showing of kido displayed by the Captains has not been impressive.

bleach,3atpd8,salesman134,2,Tue Jun 23 15:09:55 2015 UTC,Some of them have really long chants that need to be said to power them up/ I would rather just say hado 4 and shoot a lightning beam.

bleach,3atpd8,salesman134,2,Tue Jun 23 16:36:23 2015 UTC,If they give you time to say the entire chant...or you could just use bankai. Honestly the swords seem to be better for 1v1 situations while kido gives non Aoe Bankai users a way to blast an army of hollows apart.
bleach,3atpd8,Fearless-Fairness,2,Tue Jun 23 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"If you actually practice kido, you don't need the chant. Really, it goes all the way up to the point that you can just use a spell without saying anything at all."
bleach,3atpd8,ABashfulTurnip,2,Tue Jun 23 17:08:09 2015 UTC,Plus in a situation where you outnumber the opponent as long as the opponent isn't like aizen you can just continually blast them with low to mid level kido and still take them down without risking your own life.

bleach,3atpd8,shiba_keikaku,6,Tue Jun 23 14:53:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty damn strong. He seems to have more than just his intellect and scientific knowledge - Mayuri mostly wins fights with his science, while Urahara's displayed a pretty wide range of techniques on top of his inventions and plans.  He also seems to have an aspect of each of the 4 RG:    he has a version of the blood spring  he has knowledge of the workings of zanpakuto (e.g his bankai method, has the only sword physically modified into a cane) he has experience with modsouls etc he's a scientist and also creates special clothing, as seen in the recent arc"
bleach,3atpd8,Zil_v_a,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"In TBTP he already made a cloth that hid reiatsu. It's make you wonder at what point was he in the palace. I would actually wonder if he isn't a member of a royal, semi-royal or ex-royal family, like the bigger chunk of the onmitsukidō."
bleach,3atpd8,shiba_keikaku,2,Wed Jun 24 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"That too! With the way he was talking to Aizen after sealing him, he's seen the SK too. He definitely has some connection to them."
bleach,3atpd8,bobdylan777,9,Wed Jun 24 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people peg Urahara as more smart than strong, but I disagree:  He was fast enough to put the reiatsu handcuffs on Chrysalis Aizen before he could even notice, showing much higher speed than anyone except for Yoruichi and Tenjiro.  He was powerful and durable enough to keep up with Chrysalis Aizen in combat (along with Isshin and Yoruichi) using only Shikai.  Even though Chrysalis Aizen was goofing around, a weaker version of Aizen had just taken a big fat dump on all the other Captains there, including Shikai Kyoraku, and that Aizen was goofing around too.  Aizen called him the only man who equaled him in power before he took control of the Hogyoku.  He's a Kido master, a hakuda master, very fast, very strong, and an excellent swordsman.  He's at least on Kyoraku's and Ukitake's level, but I'd say he's even stronger, around the Royal Guard's level (pre-godmode Aizen, Isshin, and Yoruichi also fit here)."
bleach,3atpd8,TheMaskedHamster,3,Thu Jun 25 00:47:53 2015 UTC,"Urahara didn't seem to put himself on par with Aizen.  Facing Aizen seemed to be the only time that Urahara really seemed guarded.  Guarded or not, he was able to actually face Aizen without being immediately outclassed.  That was likely in part due to Aizen wanting to see how it played out, but it suggests that Urahara is well above the average captain's capability.    But Urahara has never fought directly, even if it would be more convenient.  We could say that it would be because he's a comic character, but his moments of seriousness in battle seem to suggest that isn't exclusively the case.    When Sado asked Urahara to train him, Urahara wouldn't do it himself.  He said his bankai wasn't appropriate for training or lending power.  The blood theme that his zanpakuto has also hints at this.  It is likely that for Uraraha, fighting at full strength means being very dangerous in ways he is not comfortable with.    I would expect that we'll see his bankai in this final arc, and I would expect that him using it will mean a high price for those around him."
bleach,3atpd8,unitedpath,5,Tue Jun 23 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"We've never seen him fight, as everyone has said, but I would guess (pure speculation) that he is in the third group of regular Captains.  First:  Yamamato, who I still contend was more powerful than any individual royal guard - you're talking about the only shinigami in all of soul society that Yhwach bothered to plan for and the only one Aizen didn't 100% believe he could stomp on.    Second: Shunsui and Ukitake:  I do believe they're in a class of their own, though they haven't always shown it.  I don't know that either of them are at Royal Guard level, but they're probably the closest thing.    Third:  Byakuya, Yoriuchi, Urahara.  Maybe Shinji?  Byakuya seems to have the most destructive power, Yoriuchi is the best tactician/fastest, and Urahara is the smartest/most able strategist.  They each bring something to the table with Urahara probably being the most important to victory of the bunch.    then the rest.  I'm sure if it came down to life and death, any of the above could defeat any of the rest.  Maybe Mayuri is in that third category, maybe he's sort of in a fourth category by himself."
bleach,3atpd8,Zil_v_a,4,Tue Jun 23 21:31:25 2015 UTC,He is smarter than stronger. No idea how powerful is his bankai. I'd sing him off as a gimmick guy.

bleach,3atpd8,LuridofArabia,3,Tue Jun 23 13:22:48 2015 UTC,"He's by far the smartest guy in the room, and it seems like his zanpakuto is perfectly tailored to knowing just about everything there is to know about how souls work. I'd give him a fair shot against just about anyone who isn't Yamamoto levels of steamrolling power. Urahara defeated Aizen, he just did it in a roundabout way.  Then again, Bleach is stupid. If Urahara gets in a fight you'll know whether he's going to win based on its place in the plot. What we've learned previously about the fighters is not a valid predictor in any sense."

He is definitely a top fighter, very smart and resourceful but Bleach is weird when comparing ""power levels"" in special for people with ""special"" abilities.   For example, I would be inclined to say he would probably win against Mayuri but wouldn't win against Szayelaporro. He would beat the shit out of Wonderweiss but wouldn't stand against Yamamoto. He would probably put a fight against Byakuya but probably wouldn't win against Zommari. Etc, etc, etc.   There is also some ""plot"" armor since he is kinda of a main character and the fact He is being used consistently as the main ""deus ex machina"" source for Bleach.   To put it simple: He is so misterious and resourceful that he is just strong as the plot may require. From what we know he could use a trick and defeat Yhwach...

bleach,3atpd8,zGhostWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"You forget that kyoraku fought before that he wasn't 100%,nobody was back then.. I 1 thing you missed he didn't trick aizen with his speed, he must have done something else too, because as we saw, aizen could easily keep up with with everyone else.. Írására isn't faster that the others. Aizen touched Ichigo while he didn't even had a chance to react, are you suggesting that urahara is fast enough to do the same?? No way.. He did something else too.. Also aizen could dodge yama attack, so then urahara is faster then him too?"
bleach,3atpd8,zGhostWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:23:07 2015 UTC,Lol that autocorrect..  Urahara isn't faster *
bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,2,Wed Jun 24 05:21:44 2015 UTC,He is incredibly fast though. Here is just one example of him showcasing it.
bleach,3atpd8,oetsuthebest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"I dont think aizen dodged yama's attack , i think it was an illusion of ks ."
bleach,3atpd8,zGhostWolf,2,Tue Jun 23 13:41:24 2015 UTC,Thats the thing.   IMO he is stronger than Kyoraku und Ukitake. Especially because of his intelligence.  Even with the extra training they recieved I think that Byakuya might be the only one who could beat him (out of the captains)
bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"Well ukitake and kyoraku are smart too, not to his extend but they are above average.. I dont think that he could defeat Kenny w/o some sort of plan... With a preparation time he could probably beat most of characters in bleach, but if he is forced in a fight I don't see him beating ukitake/kyoraku"
bleach,3atpd8,angryspacemahreen,0,Tue Jun 23 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"If you wanna go by pure stats this is what I'd say:   Offense: 100 (Bankai, Benihime's abilities and everything else at his disposal) Defense: 100 (Onmitsukido training and Benihime's abilities) Mobility: 100 (We know he's insanely fast and agile) Kido/Reiatsu: 100 (able to use high level Kido with ease) Intelligence: 100 (self explanatory) Stamina: 100 (Onmitsukido training, can chain multiple high level Kido without tiring)   I truly believe he is the only character with 100s across the board. His offense might seem off but don't forget we've never actually seen him fight as if his life was on the line. I don't think he was trying that hard against Aizen.  edit: Apparently it's meant to be Stamina and not Physical Strength."
bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,6,Tue Jun 23 13:12:33 2015 UTC,You truly believe someone has 600 when Aizen himself was 560?  Yeah. Keep believing.
bleach,3atpd8,angryspacemahreen,5,Tue Jun 23 13:18:23 2015 UTC,We don't even know what the true extent of his abilities are. I'm just being optimistic and feel that he will surprise everyone soon.   Those were Aizen's stats based on his original Shinigami abilities. If we look at him now he's surely 600/600 if not ???/600 because of his transcendence.
bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:00:30 2015 UTC,"You're expecting him to be literally stronger than the Captain Commander. That's you being ""optimistic""?"
bleach,3atpd8,angryspacemahreen,2,Tue Jun 23 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"Yama had a 60 in Stamina, that's it. Doesn't mean he's necessarily weaker than someone with 100s in everything. Besides, as said before we don't know anything about Kisuke's history or what his plans are. Anything is possible at this point."
bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,0,Tue Jun 23 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"No. Urahara Kisuke cannot be stronger than the captain commander, nor can he have 600 in every fucking stat."

bleach,3atpd8,flaccidpoo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:05:48 2015 UTC,"I made a mistake in saying it was Physical Strength, that's supposed to be Stamina.  Kenpachi has unmatched raw power, that is undeniable. IF Kisuke does end up having 100 in offense, his intelligence and speed will put him above Kenpachi in terms of fighting ability. Also, it wouldn't mean that he has no weaknesses just because he is 600/600."
bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:06:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think his shown enough of his physical strength or defence to warrant it being 100, his strong but not 100's across the board"

bleach,3atpd8,Alluka-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:53:09 2015 UTC,"usually bankai have some relation to shikai and his is basically a big red slash beam so its hard to think what the bankai version of that would be, i'd like to think it would involve deception somehow being Urahara, but surely he would have used it againts aizen if it would have helped ichigo in their fight so Kubo will have to come up with something unconventional for him, something perhaps not entirely related to fighting"

Urahara hid his HG in Rukia in order to hide it from Aizen. He most likely hid it when she came to him for Gigai after she lost most of her powers to Ichigo in the Substitute arc.

Rukia had a gem hidden inside her by Urahara, so Aizen couldn't get it without burning away her soul with the execution spear or by using a special technique Urahara developed that was in the aforementioned records. He was setting up a backup plan in case the execution was stopped.  Urahara created a fake body to suppress Rukia's powers and turn her human so the gem would become undetectable. Urahara sent Ichigo to rescue Rukia, because he thought Ichigo would stop Aizen from getting the gem. Ichigo failed to stop Aizen but he did save Rukia."

It functions the same as Cero: the damage dealt to the target is based on the strength of the user's reiatsu vs the target's (abilities like Blut Vene and Hierro override this, though)  Weaker targets are cut and burned by the wave of energy up tot he point that it just completely vaporizes them.

bleach,3avrsl,raianrage,2,Tue Jun 23 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"That gives me two thoughts: ONE. Given the mystery of who's dead and who's not from this war so far, some popular characters might be gone forever. Given Kubo's tendencies, this probably won't be the case.   TWO. Does that mean every time Ishida helps kill a hollow, he's actually bringing more harm than good? Why are any of his friends okay with this? Why are the Shinigami okay with this?"
bleach,3avrsl,Sirocco_,4,Tue Jun 23 23:20:28 2015 UTC,They are not. That's why they massacred the Quincy 1000 years ago. Souken and Ryuuken were being closely watched by the Shinigami to ensure that they didn't try anything funny.
bleach,3avrsl,SafferCrystal,3,Wed Jun 24 02:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, over the long term, Uryū is doing more harm than good. Ichigo does worry Uryū is destroying too many hollows and will attract attention from Soul Society, but Uryū only goes by request from Kisuke. Kisuke obviously knows the importance of the soul balance, so he minimizes the requests as much as he can.  I doubt Yamamoto is okay with this, but as Uryū is only one person, he won't affect the balance that much."
bleach,3avrsl,raianrage,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"Mostly they're not. I think that was one of the reasons why the Shinigami saw fit to purge the Quincy to begin with. His friends are OK with it because, well, they're teenagers. Teenagers are dumb."

bleach,3avrsl,Alluka-,2,Wed Jun 24 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"Well I've seen this theory tossed around a few times before. I find it odd how Kubo made it a point to make Seinosuke noticeable here. He is never seen again after that. I think there might be a chance that we hear of him in the future. Sadly, his former Captain is no longer around.  edit: Lol I was just browsing some more theories and I came across something else. We were never told who the first person that Byakuya's Senkei was used on. What if it was Seinosuke? It would tie in really well considering Byakuya is the one who killed Tsukishima."
bleach,3avrsl,DjMcK14,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"The first person to see senkei was Renji during his fight with Byakuya, all senkei does is compress the 'petals' into swords to amplify their cutting power."

bleach,3avrsl,Alluka-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:01:03 2015 UTC,He didn't use Senkei against Renji. That was just him materialzing a sword from the blades.

bleach,3avrsl,Alluka-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:11:53 2015 UTC,When he uses his Bankai normally it can be used as offense or defense simultaneously. His normal Bankai ability has an unknown amount of swords that can be produced but they aren't as strong as the swords produced by Senkei. He can also use the blades as a means of defense and offense if he doesn't produce a sword.  Senkei however reduces the unknown amount of swords that can be produced to a set amount. This is because the swords produced are a lot more powerful than the ones produced in his regular Bankai state.
bleach,3avrsl,DjMcK14,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I thought the mass of petals was the base form and when it's turned into another shape it becomes a different form e.g. Hakuteiken makes the single sword and wings,  gokei makes the ball and senkei makes it into multiple swords."

bleach,3as7r8,Shunsui_for_CC,22,Tue Jun 23 10:15:29 2015 UTC,"It was a gambit. Shunsui realized that to have a chance at taking down the Sternritter & Yhwach, the Gotei 13 would need someone really OP. The one person among them with that potential was Zaraki. Probably realizing Zaraki powers up the quickest through the Saiyan method, Shunsui knew he had to power him up by pitting him against someone who could quickly and repeatedly kill and heal him. Who could do that best? Unohana. Even more fitting was the fact that it was a battle between the two Kenpachi to see who would inherit the true title. And, in the end, the gambit seems to have paid off, as Kenpachi now seems to be even more powerful than his previous self and Unohana combined. Shunsui sacrificed a large piece and got an even larger piece in return. Also, given how battles in Bleach work, having a 12 is much more useful than having a 7 & 5 when going up against a 15."
bleach,3as7r8,LuridofArabia,6,Tue Jun 23 04:25:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you! You explained very well! I got kinda pissed off when people ask why Unohana had to die. Yhwach himself labeled Zaraki as a Special war potential, not Unohana. Shunsui got the meaning and made him even more OP, that's kinda smart. Not to mention, Unohana wanted die, though, because her life purpose is already finished when she found Zaraki but she still lived on"
bleach,3as7r8,rickdousey,0,Tue Jun 23 07:24:05 2015 UTC,"Even though the Saiyan stuff isn't quite right (Unohana had repressed Kenpachi's power in the past and was now removing that repression), the last part is the actual reason.  As I've explained before, in a shonen manga like Bleach, if more than one character engages in a fight, all characters on that side are only as power as their weakest member. Powers don't aggregate. This is because there is a tension in shonen: it THRIVES on the one-on-one battle, and the final battle in any arc must be between the protagonist and the ultimate villain. On the other hand, shonen thrives on themes of friendship, teamwork, and they tend to have huge ensemble casts. If you were thinking about these things with a view towards how things work in the real world, you get way more bang for your buck with Unohana. She's the best healer in Soul Society (frighteningly capable given her repeated resurrections of Zaraki) and only marginally less powerful in the fighting arena than Zaraki. She's also a kido master and a damn sight smarter than he is.  But, in Bleach, none of that matters, because you can't aggregate Unohana's abilities. She cannot be a force multiplier, because that would undermine one-on-one dynamic. With Unohana you have a 10 fighter, with Zaraki and 11. Nothing else matters.  And that's why Bleach is stupid."
bleach,3as7r8,shodic,5,Tue Jun 23 13:08:13 2015 UTC,False... Unohana did not repress Kenpachi... Kenpachi repressed Kenpachi.   Unohana helped him release it but he was the one who did all the repressing jot her.

To be able to understand himself as 'the strongest' he had to kill 'the strongest Kenpachi' in his mind - Unohana."

Unohana knew she he was stronger than her even when he was a kid but if you look at his fights,  he's never had a real challenge. Sure ichigo beat him but it was because ichigo had a burst of his hollow power and im sure zaraki could have gotten up if he wanted to but he truly though he was defeated. He is also nihilistic in his fights. He cut down tesla and that fullbringer with a single strike and even beat that espada by basically using 2 hands on his sword. Unohana was the only opponent that could have beaten zaraki so he had to fight with all his power, which she knew would lead to her death."

bleach,3as7r8,redditrandomacc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:28:40 2015 UTC,"From what I understood, the training consisted of several fights with Unohana winning everytime, healing Zaraki after each battle to restart the combat. After each battle, Zaraki became stronger until he eventually won. Since he couldn't do the same favor to Unohana, she died.  It is easier to understand if you actually translate their ""power"" to numbers. Lets say that Unohana's potential was 10 and she was at her top, so she was a 10/10 and Zaraki was intentionally restraining himself but his potential was higher than Unohana's, so he was at lets say 5 out of Kubo knows how much, so he was a 5/??? at the time. After each defeat, Zaraki increased his desire to fight and didn't restrain himself as much until he eventually became a 11/???, surpassing Unohana and killing her in the process."

Like how As Nodt did with his thorns. There's also Skravelai.   There's also the possibility he can use his Schrift without his gun. I'm suspicious that he actually uses it by opening his other eye. In which case, even if you're close to him, he just has to look at you to activate The X-Axis."

bleach,3aung7,Fearless-Fairness,3,Tue Jun 23 19:28:06 2015 UTC,I very much disagree with Skravelai being unique to Opie. He described it as a basic Quincy ability taken to the highest degree.  The other Schrifts aren't really things that are based off of basic Quincy powers. They are abstract and individualized.   I think Kubo was simply making a point by having Opie be the one to introduce Skravelai. It was our first time seeing Vollstaendig and even the characters were asking what the deal was with Vollstaendig and Letzt Stil. Skravelai mimics (and may even be the same as) the complete dominance of spiritons Mayuri observed from Uryu after Uryu entered Letzt Stil.
bleach,3aung7,Fearless-Fairness,2,Tue Jun 23 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"Why didnt they used it than ? Thats a pretty op power man , so if they knew how to use it , they could have used it . Maybe only quirge know how to take a basic ability to their highest degree"

bleach,3aung7,Keranu,3,Tue Jun 23 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"Ulquiorra is not the only Espada that can used Cero Oscuras. That is not how the attack was explained and we even saw Yammy preparing to fire a black Cero at Ichigo.  Ulquiorra probably used it because his released form has no special abilities other than High Speed Regeneration. So, unlike many others, Ulquiorra must beat his enemy down with generic abilities and physical attacks."

bleach,3aung7,Fearless-Fairness,2,Tue Jun 23 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"Most of them are stupid. They didn't even use Vollstaendig before dying. So, they didn't even give it their all."

bleach,3aung7,redditrandomacc,2,Tue Jun 23 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"I think its because of how kubo intended its use, Sklaverei seems to be an ability that's meant to absorb whatever gets in its way, its much easier to absorb a hollow and have one's look project parts of it, than to absorb a shinigami and have pieces of them on you. The only other valid use for sklaverei is to absorb a bankai, but since kubo introduced the stealing medallion, it wasn't needed. Overall though it would of been better if the quincies used sklaverei to steal the bankai rather than the other way, cause at that point the bankai would be mixed with whatever power the ritter who held it with had"
bleach,3aung7,redditrandomacc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"Actually it was a regular cero just massive in size and power, it was shown as red in the anime, I think kubo just colored it black for whatever reason, never did it state that yammy could use it"

bleach,3as5mz,Fearless-Fairness,5,Tue Jun 23 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. There's too many unfulfilling fights and dangling plot points.  Like, none of the fights so far have been satisfying. They're one shotting each other with powers that aren't clearly explained to the reader. At the end of the fight you aren't sure what all went on or why one person one and the other didn't.   The plot is, as I said, also still shrouded in mystery. We don't understand what power Yhwach is using to do the thing he's doing that we also don't really understand."
bleach,3as5mz,Sleepytimer,11,Tue Jun 23 03:22:07 2015 UTC,I'm gonna have to disagree with yah mate. Juha's powers were explained and the fights were explained. I don't think people were really left confused. Bleach is at it's best moments right now.
bleach,3as5mz,TruthBeyondConcept,3,Tue Jun 23 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"There's still questions about Yhwach's powers because there are five anomalies: Yuzu, Karin, Ichigo, Ryuuken, and Uryu. The are people with Quincy powers that were unaffected by Yhwach's Auschwalen.  There's not a proper explanation for those anomalies.   The fights were just, ugh. All of the Captains disappointed or left us with questions. Almost all of the Stern Ritter have as well.   The best moments will only be if we actually see some satisfying fights after this."
bleach,3as5mz,ChaosKeeshond,7,Tue Jun 23 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Well Ryuuken is a full-blooded Quincy, so he wouldn't have been affected by Auschwalen. Your point still stands for the others though."
bleach,3as5mz,Ombs1993,9,Tue Jun 23 04:12:31 2015 UTC,Ryuuken is an anomaly because Yhwach and Opie act like they don't know he exists or his existence is a non-factor.  His role in all of this is a big mystery.

bleach,3aqyxw,epsilonbob,7,Tue Jun 23 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that there was no real retirement from the Gotei 13. There's death or the Maggot's Nest.  And considering how confusing aging is in Soul Society, people can serve for a very long time, to the point where they eventually winlose the lottery and die."
bleach,3aqyxw,Humble_Shopkeeper,2,Tue Jun 23 06:18:46 2015 UTC,There have been a few Shinigami who have retired that we know of.   Marenoshin Omaeda - 2nd Division Lieutenant Chikane Iba - 3rd Division Lieutenant Ginjiro Shirogane - 6th Division Lieutenant Jin'emon Kotsubaki - 7th Division Lieutenant   Someone else mentioned that only the Shinigami who may pose a threat get put in the Maggot's Nest and I think that hold's some truth. I want to say Mayuri was one of the original Gotei 13 Captains and that is why he was in there before Kisuke got him out.
bleach,3aqyxw,Alluka-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"I'll give you Marenoshin Omaeda and Ginjiro Shirogane. Though one's a noble (normal rules do not apply) and the other still works in the Seireitei (with a lot of business with members of the Gotei 13).  The other two are only known to have been shinigami in the past that had kids. I don't recall anything about them beyond being mentioned as lieutenants a hundred years ago.  Any shinigami that may pose a potential threat to the Soul Society is thrown into the Maggot's Nest. Regardless of whether there was a trial or even any crimes committed. Mayuri had the distinction of being the only inmate deemed dangerous enough to be chained in a cell, so who knows?"
bleach,3aqyxw,Humble_Shopkeeper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, there is no other information on the two who had kids. I mean it's possible that they were tossed in the Maggot's Nest but it just seems unlikely for some reason. I got nothing to back it up it's just a baseless assumption.  There is definitely more to Mayrui than we know though. Especially since he knew about Yhwach and the past confrontation between him and Yama. It's very likely that once upon a time he was an original but there is very little information to reinforce it. I guess we have to add it to the list of things that need answering."
bleach,3aqyxw,Alluka-,2,Wed Jun 24 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"It seems more likely that they died, like Kuchiki Sojun.  Mayuri is definitely an enigma, but him knowing about the past could just mean that he stuck his nose where it didn't belong (and perhaps partly why he got stuck in the Maggot's Nest). Almost everything we have is circumstantial and could be interpreted a million ways. Makes it both interesting and frustrating."
bleach,3aqyxw,Humble_Shopkeeper,4,Wed Jun 24 05:47:44 2015 UTC,"If I recall, Byakuya's grandfather retired as a captain."

bleach,3aqyxw,epsilonbob,5,Tue Jun 23 11:26:06 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure Urahara said there is no official way to resign and that's why the Maggot's Nest exists, I assume they let you leave if you get too old to perform duties such as Byakuya's grandfather (he looked older than Old Man Yama in TBTP)"
bleach,3aqyxw,LucciDVergo,2,Tue Jun 23 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"Well, This is Bleach... I'm still not certain Orihime isn't the next Soul King or Yachiru really isn't Kenpachi's Zanpakuto, or that anyone has actually been killed...  However Urahara made it quite clear to Hiyori when they sprung Mayuri  from the maggots nest, That resignation from the Court Guard Squads was not possible. There are of course ways to be expelled or discharged such as betrayal or loss of spirit energy. Basically Urahara said Shinigami were too dangerous to leave on their own.  As for Ginrei Kuchiki ""retirement"" well, he may have grown too old to be effective , or as head of a noble house, he may have been afforded a little leeway in the retirement aspect. Remember the rules don't always apply to the rich/powerful.  The only other Captain that left alive to my knowledge was Yoruichi Shihoin, princess of the Tenshiheisōban clan. yet again, her position in the clans may explain why they let her (or they know they don't have anyone who could catch her).   As for the other captains... I don't know, maybe if you grow too weak, they'll let you step down, but for most, it seems to be blood in, blood out..."
bleach,3aqyxw,epsilonbob,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:16:57 2015 UTC,As I understand it the intention of the maggot's nest is to house anyone who could pose a significant threat to soul society so I suppose it makes sense that any shinigami who want to 'leave the family' in their prime would immediately fall under that umbrella  Otherwise you could have a bunch of well trained high power people all retire together (or over time) and form a rogue faction to challenge the establishment  Maybe it is a privilege of nobility or maybe they implicitly trust that a member of those families wouldn't go rogue? ::shrug::

(that we know of)   Yes and No. Don't forget we are seeing only a small fragment of time.  But even if so, it simply highlights my point, which someone could be at a captain class level with full mastery of Bankai, and yet have to wait hundreds of years for there to be an opening.   But to more of the thought angle however:   Squad 11 5th seat Yumichika has stated he could be 4th seat, but hates the number 4, as well as he intends to stay in Squad 11. This means for him to advance within squad 11, his best friend 3rd seat Ikkaku, Lt. Yachiru, or Captain Kenpachi would have to leave their post. Since the Shinigami retirement package seems to really suck (a all expense paid eternal stay in the Maggots Nest), And for all intense purposed Yachiru and Kenpachi are one unit, Either Kenpachi or Ikkaku must die (or start a rebellion that'll end in their deaths...)as I don't see Ikkaku requesting a transfer. Seems like a pretty cruddy was to get promoted..."

Not counting the captains and Royal Guard, whose positions require bankai or something of the like, before Ichigo came around you could count the bankais of the shinigami on one hand. The only two I can remember right now is Ikkaku and the first squad Lieutenant"

bleach,3aqyxw,ShiaLaBuff,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but she's fan service and an excellent representation of why most people think the story has gone down hill. She struggled against an arrancar and not even a Vasto Lorde proper yet she continues to get promotions and is considered stronger. She hasn't won any fights and is handed power ups despite being a perfect candidate for someone that should never get Bankai.  Oh it takes 1,000 years to achieve? Here you can have one after a day. I'm not a fan and I think her character would be much better if she won fights on her own and based on cunning and skill as opposed to based on her going SSJ."
bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,10,Mon Jun 22 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the first one to be upset about the soul king palace power-up, specially when we talk about the shinigami chosen to go under it (why not have Zaraki there instead of letting he kill Unohana?), but in Rukia's case, I don't think it was that much of an unbalanced thing.   Her bankai is powerful, but has obvious flaws (you have only one chance, and even if you succeed, you still may die) making it even worse than Soi-Fon's. And I think it was somehow foreshadowed when she destroyed that arrancar and made everything turn into ice around her, so she probably wasn't that away of achieving bankai naturally.  And she actually uses her skills in combat. Her shikai is one of the most resourceful shikais in bleach, with lots of different techniques."
bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,2,Mon Jun 22 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think of it this way. The people chosen may not have been the strongest, but they held the strongest morals for the greater good, and justice, and all that shit. Kenpachi can't exactly be trusted with a power-up from SK, even Central 46 (AKA Kubo, everything anyone says is all his words) didn't like the idea of making him stronger at first.  So, they chose the weaker ones that needed the power-ups to help strengthen the team. That's why they didn't just choose Ukitake, Kyoraku, Urahara, and Yoruichi, they're already pretty damn strong, and making just a few people REALLY strong doesn't quite work. Imagine if only like 3 football players were super strong and fast and the whole rest of the team sucked. They'd never win a single game. Sure maybe at first they might score a touchdown, but there's no way just 3 people can do nothing but running plays all the way to a win.  Well, scratch that, all they really need is for Ichigo to keep getting stronger and stronger, because once again we have another anime that does a lot of TALKING about friendship and teamwork and family and all that bullshit, but shows time and time again with actions that it's every man for himself and every fight should be 1v1.  Looking at you too, Akira Toriyama."
bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,2,Mon Jun 22 23:52:12 2015 UTC,They were chosen because Kubo wanted them to remain relevant to the story. Nothing more.

bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,3,Tue Jun 23 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, the training was a means to give her power. But what do you expect? This is a shounen. Obviously, at some point the enemy will become ridiculously powerful and some of the good guys will receive a power up in order to keep things balanced.  Ichigo received the most ridiculous power-up to fight Aizen. Renji conveniently achieved bankai just before his fight with Byakuya. And even Yammy went from Espada 10 to Espada 0 just because Kenpachi and Byakuya needed something to distract them from boredom. Compared to these guys, Rukia's power-up doesn't look unfair."
bleach,3aqyxw,richiegraine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"The training is a bullshit way for Kubo to keep her relevant to the story. It makes 0 sense story-wise for the 0 division to train this idiot anyway. It's not only her, it's Renji as well. At least Renji remained useful after the training.  Imagined if they trained a proper Captain. I bet that Captain wouldn't kill himself fighting fucking As Nodt.  Instead of giving the audience a decent fight with other Captain's like Rose and Kensei, he decided to make them chumps while giving Renji and Rukia the spotlight. What a slap in the face of every Kensei and Rose fan."
bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,7,Tue Jun 23 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"Well notice she didn't get a captain position but a vice captain position which she was technically already qualified for. Not to mention out of everyone but Ichigo, she is the only non captain person on the Hueco Mundo squad to beat an Espada BY HERSELF WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE and it was clear she wasn't even at her best because of the whole Kaien thing and the fact she had to face her demons while fighting a pretty strong opponent. Her getting bankai was something I was against at first but when you look at her fight if Byakuya hadn't intervened she would've lost so she isn't perfect and she isn't exactly all powerful since her abilities come at a great cost to her if she makes even one mistake. I'm not a huge fan of Rukia but her promotion is well deserved and appropriate and her power up was fair."
bleach,3aqyxw,richiegraine,-2,Tue Jun 23 02:54:45 2015 UTC,Her power up wasn't fair. Her promotion and all that shit are redundant since anyone not a Captain is entirely worthless anyway.
bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:27:49 2015 UTC,It's fair because while powerful it comes at a great price and it shows off her real skill and that's her reishi control which is a vital skill that has to be completely accurate while using her true powers.
bleach,3aqyxw,richiegraine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:32:28 2015 UTC,It's not fair because 2 worthless warriors spent a few minutes training with the Zero Division and suddenly they're Captain tier. Well at least in Renji's case he's Captain tier.
bleach,3aqyxw,theleetfox,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:55:14 2015 UTC,They weren't the strongest but they weren't useless either. Rukia is average and Renji is slightly above average for vice captains. Getting an understanding of yourself and your sword training with the maker of zans and the guy who can know the name of everything makes the power up make sense. Why only those two? Well they were pretty jacked up and quickly headed to death if they hadn't been taken. Plus outside the story they're main characters and needed a boost since they're probably being groomed to be captains.

Plus outside the story they're main characters and needed a boost since they're probably being groomed to be captains.    You could've just said Kubo loves his shit characters and it would've made more sense.  He refuses to innovate that's why he doesn't show us what every other vice captain or captains can do.

bleach,3aqyxw,Hipplol,5,Wed Jun 24 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"1,000 years? Gonna need some source on that because I'm remembering it differently. I remember Yoruichi stating it takes 10 years to ""master"", meaning it could be gained in a much shorter time period but it'd be the same as firing a gun with no previous experience, you're gonna miss, probably hurt yourself and risk getting someone killed if misused.  This is exactly the case with her's, as a matter of fact, she clearly isn't used to it and needs reminding of the consequences of misusing her own bankai. While I'm not a huge fan of Rukia, I understand and support the idea of her getting a bankai, as it was not only hinted at previously, it makes sense.  Sidenote, would you argue against Ikkaku having a bankai? The guys pretty nuts but he almost died against an arrancar who wasn't even an espada. A bankai doesn't mean that you're automatically stronger than something else. It's an increase to your current abilities. If my strength is 5 and yours is 60, if I get a bankai I'll still have a lower strength than you as it'd top around 50."

bleach,3aq2ls,yukeake,9,Mon Jun 22 19:28:25 2015 UTC,Or Mask's real name is James and the James we know is actually a manifestation of his power in the form of a living spirit weapon.
bleach,3aq2ls,LucciDVergo,6,Tue Jun 23 01:50:16 2015 UTC,"Disagree with Mask - his whole masked-wrestler superhero schtick most likely wouldn't have been around during the Crusades (which is where, chronologically, this flashback seems to occur).  Also, I suspect James/Mask were one ""being"", though who was the ""original"" and who was the ""construct"" is rather murky.  I'd be inclined to believe Mask's ""real name"" was ""James"" prior to receiving his powers - after which he spawned ""James"" and took on the Mask persona.  But that's just speculation based on Yhwach ""welcoming back"" James, and not Mask.  Also, ""Mask de Masculine"" sounds like a stage name ;P  Pernida hasn't been referred to as a ""new addition"" to the Elites, like Askin - so I'd be tempted to throw him/her/it in the ""old guard"" category, though there's no real evidence either way."
bleach,3aq2ls,Keranu,5,Mon Jun 22 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"Mask was deff named James, that is confirmed by Yhwach after his death more or less.

bleach,3ap536,HatoriHanzoSteel,13,Mon Jun 22 10:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda disappointed with the dismissal regarding Oomaeda. He might be the character everyone loves to hate, but his Zanpakutou is pretty interesting to me. The name of his Zanpakutou and the kanji used for it are mismatched, which means the name ""Gegetsuburi"" is a mystery, similar to Minadzuki (although in that case we were tricked into thinking we knew the origin of Minadzuki since it's an old word for the month of June). My theory is, if he has a Bankai, it'll also be called Gegetsuburi but using different kanji (下月振 - ""Like the Falling Moon"") and it'll basically just be a bigger demolition ball, probably with some physical ability like being able to shrink and expand. I'm kinda down with the idea of him having a Bankai as long as an entire fight isn't wasted on it. He's been a lieutenant a lot longer than some of the others...  Regarding Haguro Tonbo, the Haguro (""iron drink"") refers to Ohaguro. Haguro Tonbo can also mean Black-toothed Dragonfly or Black-winged Dragonfly. Either way, I think it would be cool if her Bankai were large amounts of iron water that she can control. I think Lisa and Love together would be a good opponent for Kirinji, so a Bankai like that would let her take control of Kirinji's water.  As for Love, his two sides are the Oni and the Tengu. His Shikai represents the Oni part, so I'd like to see his Bankai show some more Tengu aspects. Considering the fire-based abilities we saw in Shikai, I'm picturing a large feather fan which creates fire when swung.  For Hachi, I'm guessing his Shikai will be a kris based on his Balinese demon Hollow mask. No idea regarding abilities. I don't think we can guess abilities so easily.  EDIT: I just remembered Oomaeda can't have Bankai. He touched a Shin'eiyaku and it didn't work. Oh well."
bleach,3ap536,Andygoesrawr,5,Mon Jun 22 11:36:08 2015 UTC,EDIT: I just remembered Oomaeda can't have Bankai. He touched a Shin'eiyaku and it didn't work. Oh well.   Wasn't that just for people who had their bankais stolen?
bleach,3ap536,thenewperson1,3,Mon Jun 22 17:35:46 2015 UTC,I assumed he was supposed to give it to Soifon. Did Kubo show her getting one before pulling out her bankai? That happened like a year ago so I don't remember.   I remember I had wishful thinking that Oomaeda getting one implied that he had at least unlocked his bankai but not mastered it.
bleach,3ap536,virmeretrix,2,Mon Jun 22 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"No, it was for everyone. I guess it was meant to prevent Bankai being stolen from those who still had theirs. Urahara said the pill only works for those with Bankai, so the fact that Oomaeda touching it did nothing means he doesn't have Bankai."
bleach,3ap536,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:19:24 2015 UTC,"Urahara meant it as it only works for those who have bankai and had them stolen, It hollowfied the bankai so that it became poison to quincies and thus the quincy loses said bankai and it goes back to the owner. I'm sure someone who still had their bankai wouldn't be affected by the pill."
bleach,3ap536,Keranu,2,Sun Jul 12 05:58:35 2015 UTC,"Wait, what?  Was Minazuki ever written in kana? Wasn't it always written with the kanji? It's not really trickery or a mystery if it was always clearly written - why would Japanese people (the original target audience) think it was mysterious when it's clearly written as not the month name?"
bleach,3ap536,chaosattractor,3,Mon Jun 22 11:55:31 2015 UTC,"The kanji and furigana are entirely separate. There's no way 肉雫唼 could possibly be read as ""Minadzuki"", only Shishisuzukususuri (which is clearly pretty ridiculous) or Nikudashou. So we knew what the kanji was, but not the furigana. It was assumed to come from the month name because it's a common word, a nice name, and it made sense. But eventually we found out it comes from 皆尽, ""Everyone Dies"". It was a nice little twist.  It's actually really similar to Resurreccion names. The kanji for those names is always basic and clearly not designed to look nice or have a nice reading, and most of the time the kanji had absolutely nothing to do with the reading. It just served as a nicer reading because the real reading was so horrendous.  The difference is that Zanpakutou have two names, the Shikai and Bankai. They always have to share something between them, and thanks to Minadzuki we know it's possible to share the name but have a completely different meaning."
bleach,3ap536,Andygoesrawr,3,Mon Jun 22 12:08:53 2015 UTC,"But...that's still not mysterious at all. We already knew it meant ""flesh drop [gorge?]"" and we already knew what it did (i.e. flies, swallows people and heals them), so...what would ""June"" even have to do with it? Even if the reading was based on ""June"", then...what? Minazuki would be a flying manta ray with healing stomach acid and a...nice name?  Also I thought 尽 was ""end, finish"" not ""dies"". I read her Bankai as ""everything ends""...and for what it's worth the 雫 in her Shikai's name is (can be) pronounced as ""na"" if you're going Chinese. I know quite a few mangaka (like Kishimoto) mix and match Chinese and Japanese pronunciations for the most aesthetic reading, and also abbreviate some parts and take liberties with others. Is it any so different from English authors making up words for their own fantastical settings?"
bleach,3ap536,chaosattractor,2,Mon Jun 22 12:26:02 2015 UTC,"That's just how Japanese works. One word can have two completely different meanings based on mismatched kanji and furigana -- it's called jukujikun, though more broadly and possibly more appropriately in this case ateji. We knew the kanji meant ""Slurper of Dripping Flesh"", but we didn't know what ""Minadzuki"" meant because it was just in kana. Minadzuki as interpreted as the name of the month of June was appropriate because it literally means ""Water Moon"" (like the Suigetsu in Kyouka Suigetsu). Knowing what the name means is important because it imparts more meaning. It's about poetry, something which is very important to Kubo. The fact that it means ""Everyone Dies"" means a lot, because it represents her darker side. The fact that the kanji and kana were mismatched also represents the fact that she puts on a facade. Not everything about a Zanpakutou name has to do with what the Zanpakutou looks like and does.  Tsukiru poetically means to die. Native Japanese doesn't have a word for death. The one used today originally meant ""to leave this place"", but was combined with the Chinese word for death because of their similar meanings. So yes, it literally means ""Everyone Ends"", but what happens at the end of life? Death.  The difference between this and English authors making up words is that it's a structure of Japanese, and Kubo used two Japanese words, not one Japanese word and one made up word, or one Japanese word and one foreign word. Because of the fact that it's how all Japanese words work, we can't know what a word means based only on its kana. The fact that it's a Japanese word means it has a meaning. The fact that the meaning isn't shown to us means we could only guess what it was. The fact that we could only guess what it was means it was mysterious.  This is getting too off-topic. The fact of the matter is that the meaning of ""Minadzuki"" was unknown to us in the same way that the meaning of ""Gegetsuburi"" is unknown to us. We can guess what it means, as I have, but we can't know for sure until Kubo reveals it."
bleach,3ap536,Andygoesrawr,2,Mon Jun 22 12:47:29 2015 UTC,"This is getting too off-topic. The fact of the matter is that the meaning of ""Minadzuki"" was unknown to us in the same way that the meaning of ""Gegetsuburi"" is unknown to us. We can guess what it means, as I have, but we can't know for sure until Kubo reveals it.   This is where my confusion lies, not necessarily in the finer points of their translations or pronunciations. I agree that Gegetsuburi is surrounded by mystery, but I find more logic in comparing it to say Houzukimaru than to Minazuki. Even though Houzukimaru is written and read straight, the choice of ""Demon Light"" becomes clearer in its Bankai state (the glowing red dragon meter) and also ties to its Shikai state (it has three sections, like the sansetsukon). ""Like the Falling Moon"" would become clearer in its Bankai, and would also tie in to its Shikai (still a demolition ball, just WAY larger). On the other hand, how would ""Water Moon"" tie in to a flying manta ray that dissolves into a fluid and heals people inside its stomach?  There's also the fact that ""Five-formed Heads"" doesn't make sense for Gegetsuburi's Shikai state either (like ""Demon Light doesn't make sense for Houzukimaru), while ""Slurper of Dripping Flesh"" (I really like that by the way) already makes sense for Minazuki's Shikai.  Translation notes: I really like ""Slurper of dripping flesh"", nice. Also, regarding Minazuki I don't read 皆 as necessarily meaning ""everyone"". So the end of everything would not necessarily be death, and ""everything ends"" also ties thematically to her being the last of the original Gotei; to her insistent belief that one tenure as Kenpachi must completely end for the next to properly begin; to the end of her ""Retsu"" façade; and also has room for the interpretation that ""everyone dies"". (Also this discussion is fun)"
bleach,3ap536,chaosattractor,2,Mon Jun 22 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"Hoozukimaru is also a case of jukujikun, but since it's an actual word and the kanji used is the standard I wouldn't really count it as having a specific meaning in this case. The kanji refers to the fact that Hoozuki (ground cherries) look like Chinese lanterns. Hoozukimaru is called such because of the tassel in Shikai, which resembles a Hoozuki. There's never been mystery regarding the name.  The reason ""June"" worked so well as an interpretation of Minadzuki is because Unohana's name means May. It's not necessarily a good descriptor of the appearance of the Shikai, but nor is ""Kyouka Suigetsu"" for Aizen. At the basis, Minadzuki's ability revolves around liquid, specifically a type of acid which heals wounds in Shikai and melts flesh away in Bankai. ""Water Moon"" works because it refers to the liquid aspect. To be fair, I have been saying that the Bankai meaning is the ""real meaning"", but it's clear that Kubo was aiming to use both meanings, probably representing her two sides.  The kanji for Gegetsuburi makes enough sense. The head of the weapon has five spikes coming out of it, so it's a Five-shaped Head. The only issue is that Kubo is inconsistent with the number of spikes... but he does the same with a few things where the number is important to get right. Kensei's Hollow form sometimes had 9 cylinders on his back (which makes sense matched with the 6 slits on his mask, a la his 69) and sometimes 10, and Tousen's Bankai sometimes had 9 rings (which made sense because of the ""Nine Aspects"" it's based off) and sometimes 10. Gegetsuburi usually has more than 5 spikes, but the point of them is to make it so it looks like a five-point star from most angles.  Kubo only ever uses mismatched kanji when it's important for the character. Suzumushi uses the kanji for ""pure"" instead of ""bell"", and Tousen referred to himself as pure and viewed everyone else as impure. Senbonzakura Kageyoshi uses the kanji for ""severe"" instead of whatever yoshi is meant to be (most likely ""pleasant"" being the opposite of severe here and representing the two sides to Byakuya's character -- but like the others, Kubo's true intention of what yoshi should mean isn't clear)."

These days づ is almost always rendered as ""zu"", but I find it really modern and annoying because it makes it difficult to search for words based off the romanised version. ""Minadzuki"" to me feels very archaic and just a lot nicer than Minazuki or Minaduki, and just fits Unohana a lot more.  Also, the current orthographic rules of Japanese state that ""dzu"" is always written as ""zu"" (in Japanese itself, not in romanisation), except for where it appears at the start of a word which has been modified by rendaku due to another word in front of it, in which case it's ""dzu"". In this case, ""tsuki"" has been modified by rendaku to become dzuki, so I like to express that in English because it instantly tells us that Minadzuki is two words -- mina and tsuki."

No, the Seireitei is the part of Soul Society meant specifically for shinigami.    If only the Gotei-13 lives there, then what are all those buildings for?   It's not just the Captains and vice-captains. There are entire divisions of shinigami.   What did the Gotei-13 even do with themselves before Ichigo showed up?   Presumably keeping Rukongai in check, along with the normal duties of being a shinigami. It seems Seireitei has it's own shops and things like that. I would think of Seireitei as it's own little city.   When people die, do they go to Soul Society as they age they were when they died?   I'd have to brush up on this, but I think so? I'm recalling the kid Chad saved way in the beginning and the Fullbringers that were training with Ganju.    If so, why are there so many dead children?   Kids die?    Can you die of old age in Soul Society?   Good question. I would imagine that if a shinigami can age, then even for them there must be some kind of limit."

I'd like to see some more switching between the past and present version of similar events as he has been.  That said, he can still easily take it away from Bazz and Jugram into a steady chunk of flashbacks regarding the original Sternritter, the original Gotei 13 (remember Ichibe'e is alive, he can be used for transitions), and eventually the war of 1,000 years ago."

bleach,3ao2sg,reigun91,5,Mon Jun 22 04:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Honestly, even if it continues this way, I'll be pleased either way. The comment 'We're starved for info at this point' is the epitome of how we all feel.   The only thing is that with so much information that is seemingly missing with Ywach's history, Shinigami War, Ginjou's past, etc., I feel that at this point, it could all be beautifully written at one time. Now, that of course solely depends on what Kubo's vision is, and if everything can be explained in one go. Not necessarily saying that it can be, but only Kubo knows.   The main thing I always have in the back of my mind is that TBTP started at -108 and stopped at -97. It would be incredible if he were able to swing the pendulum back, starting with -96, and finish it at 0.   But again, we'll just have to see. I'm sure he planned something similar to that when he created TBTP originally, noticing the numbering system he used for it. We'll just have to wait and see how it unfolds!"
bleach,3ao2sg,Kr4d105s2,0,Mon Jun 22 05:38:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the flashbacks of this arc all take place before the events of TBTP, so having them be -96 to 0 wouldn't make any sense."
bleach,3ao2sg,maytagem,2,Mon Jun 22 09:21:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll be getting the pendulum swing at all. It's entirely unnecessary, but yeah we'll probably get more flashbacks which are the best way for Kubo to tell his story at this point. We're all starved for info at this point"
bleach,3ao2sg,hatrickstar,2,Mon Jun 22 04:41:10 2015 UTC,"I'd be in. I mostly want to see the first gotei 13, you know most if not all of the royal guard was part of it, Probably a Shiba ancestor, as well as a Komamura ancestor, and for sure a Kuchiki and Shinhoin one, young Yamamoto and Yhwach, Robert in his full power and maybe some other quincy, maybe an explanation why Mayuri was in prison in the last TBTP, and hopefully an explanation as to why and how Aizen was able to understand the true purpose of the soul king. It'll be fun if it happens."
bleach,3ao2sg,Zil_v_a,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:01:51 2015 UTC,"The way it is paced now is so that he won't have to swing back the pendulum. He wants the story to be more fluid and action-filled. We have an offensive against the castle, divided groups and scary opponents. The manga was stale for quiet a few chapters, basically the moment they mentioned the doors everything turned to snail's peace. People got a promise of fights and action, he can't back out of it now. Starting a TBTP in the classic manner would ruin the pacing. The original TBTP happened in a calm moment, right before the final-ish battle. It had it's place. Mid action, not really.  TL;DR - it's totally the worst moment to start TBTP."

The same can be said about the other main arcs as well."

bleach,3ao2sg,ShiaLaBuff,-1,Mon Jun 22 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"Are.... are you serious? At least two battles are going on right now, Ichigo is currently on his third or 15th try to get back to Bach before someone knocks him all the way down or they all teleport to another dimension again, Kenpachi and Mayuri are about to encounter most likely Thor in the next or next next chapter. It's right in the middle of stuff. These things need to end before Kubo will even think of doing a pretty random TBTP. It's not like anyone even setup any segways leading into one, like someone going ""By the way Ichigo, I'm actually your uncle. And I'd like to a take a minute just sit right there and tell you how I became the God of a town called Bel Air."" or something. Literally no one said anything worth spending the next several dozen chapters going back in time yet."
bleach,3ao2sg,Narissis,2,Mon Jun 22 07:21:13 2015 UTC,"Do you remember how the first TBTP began?  It was literally out of nowhere. Ichigo raced towards Ulquiorra as Aizen arrived with the Espada to FKT. Everything was setup perfectly and the pacing at that point seemed crazy stable. Then out of nowhere, we got the pendulum swing.   My point is that the only reason for there to be a TBTP is to create depth for events, themes, and most importantly, characters. That's exactly what the original TBTP did, and that's what we as readers are in dire need of once more. We need the history of all these characters. We need to understand their motives, their emotions, as well as their struggles. We have little to no clue of how all of this began, and why all of this began in the first place. Doing another TBTP would relieve that. I think now is as good a time as any, so that when we do actually get back to Ichigo and co., we'll have a deeper understanding of why we should actually care about these characters."

bleach,3aongz,Andygoesrawr,4,Mon Jun 22 06:50:02 2015 UTC,"Robert and Quilge were for the purpose of introducing Vollstaendig to us, so it makes sense they had names. PePe and Aes were probably used because they had weird names. We were also kinda given Mask's, but only the Japanese (Supremacy of God).  I'm sure Haschwalth's will have a name. It's a shame Liltotto, Giselle, and Bazz won't be able to use theirs to give us the names. Maybe something will change there.

bleach,3akziz,shiba_keikaku,18,Sun Jun 21 05:48:14 2015 UTC,"Probablly excellent chances against the Zero Division, even without Kyoka Suigetsu. Aizen himself cockily stated that the Espada's combined strength was less than his own  and then easily dispatched several captains to prove it. His spiritual energy currently disintegrates plebs who get too close, and Aizen was definitely close to if not at the end of his evolution in the Deicide arc. He was also apparently strong enough to manipulate Ywach's sense of time while still completely sealed in Muken.  As for Oetsu, that maybe might give him the ability to counteract some of Kyoka Suigetsu's hypnosis but Aizen is too smart not to figure out a way to use control of the 5 senses in a tactically dominant fashion if he even needed too. He still has Hogyoku enhanced speed, strength, endurance, spiritual pressure and whatnot. His raw power alone might singlehandedly decide that battle.  Ichibe would definitely be tougher but my understanding of Ichibe's power over true names is that he needs to cover the wanted recipient of his power with black ink in order to do it.   If Aizen is as meticulous in his invasion of the Soul King's Palace as he was throughout the rest of the series (from the Central46 takeover to the Yamamoto check Wonderweiss) He'd have something up his sleeve just in case.  As for the rest of the zero division, the same principles apply. OP raw stats. OP zanpakuto. OP Genius level planning.  This is all assuming of course that Aizen got over the MC Hammer-Cant-Touch-This arrogance that handily lost him the fight in the Deicide Arc. He might of stood a chance against Ichigo if he hadn't deluded himself into believing he was untouchable and actually used Kyoka Suigetsu, the ultimate X-factor."
bleach,3akziz,Sirepicwin,6,Sun Jun 21 06:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think their ability to work as a team will mean he'll at least have a hell of a challenge. Ichibei's weird abilities surprised even Yhwach, who seemingly had met him at some point. He almost won too before The Almighty kicked in. I kinda jumped the gun with the kyoka suigetsu thing too - have the RG even seen the shikai release? Your last point is important, though. If he was at that level of arrogance, it would be quite possible they would be able to hit him with something significant."
bleach,3akziz,MrFahrenheit39,3,Sun Jun 21 10:28:09 2015 UTC,"IMO the most important factor would be if Ichibei can write the hogyoku out. If he can, I think the battle would slide into the Royal Guard's favor.  If Ichibei can't rewrite the hogyoku, I'm positive Aizen would inevitably end up winning."
bleach,3akziz,Zil_v_a,3,Sun Jun 21 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"Aizen had no chance against Ichigo. Mostly because of this it's just a definitive ""he's so op there's nothing you can do""."
bleach,3akziz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Sun Jun 21 13:28:46 2015 UTC,Well  And
bleach,3akziz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,4,Sun Jun 21 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"He lost to Ichigo because he wanted to lose. It's apart of his plan! His goal is to get into the Royal Palace. I mean, look at this opportunity he has now. He became arrogant because of this level of competition around him. He was transcendent vs regular shinigami. I don't think he's going to be arrogant towards people like Juha/Ichigo/Royal Guard."
bleach,3akziz,LucciDVergo,2,Sun Jun 21 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"I do think this was all part of the plan somehow BUT, it's hard to say he wanted to be sealed away by Kisuke of all people, in an angered rage, of all emotions for him to have"
bleach,3akziz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,3,Sun Jun 21 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"He didn't want to be sealed away by Kisuke. He said he didn't know the seal was in him. He just wanted to lose to Ichigo because deep down he just felt alone, so there was a doubt in him, which the hogyoku listened to. He helped develope Ichigo. If his plan is honestly to overthrow the Soul King then it could be possible he had been planning to create a being with all the species. Urahara was probably planning the same, since he had his own hogyoku to help him transcend a Shinigami and Hollow."
bleach,3akziz,ShiaLaBuff,0,Sun Jun 21 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"Isn't he still in SS with the drained Ukitake?  That makes me wonder now. What if Aizen saves Ukitake and gives him a shitload of power to recover, and then do a much more powerful version of his Bankai that we never saw? A very special bankai given to him by the SK or Oetsu or Ichibei, because they predicted he'd grow up to be totally morally good, and smart enough to know how to use it best for the best purpose, and it happens to do something to Bach that totally fucks him over....?"
bleach,3akziz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:21:31 2015 UTC,"Aizen wouldn't save him or give him a shitload of power. I mean, it's Aizen haha. He is going to do all of this himself."
bleach,3akziz,ShiaLaBuff,0,Mon Jun 22 00:47:44 2015 UTC,"He could at least pity him, and show some mad respect, for being the nicest shinigami, and showing that even he doesn't obey authority when it's being unjust (Referring to CC doing nothing against the obviously mysteriously corrupt orders of Central 46), like when he helped save Rukia."
bleach,3akziz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:17:20 2015 UTC,The only thing Aizen cares about it dethroning the Soul King and taking its place. If Ukitake somehow comes into that equation then he would do something with him but Aizen won't help him for any other reason.
bleach,3akziz,ShiaLaBuff,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:14:16 2015 UTC,"Ichibei changes the name of the Hogyoku to ""pineapple shaped butt plug"" or something and make Aizen fight in a weakened and pretty uncomfortable state. Aizen has tons of raw power, sure, but he doesn't have the same god abilities to control all kinds of shit like Bach can, so I'm sure Ichibei's ink and name changing shit would be able to affect him."
bleach,3akziz,Sirepicwin,3,Mon Jun 22 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"But Ichibe still has to get ink on the Hogyoku for that power to have any effect.  And anyways, the flip side of that coin is that Aizen immediately uses Kyoka Suigetsu, luring Ichibe into a false sense of security before easily slaying him. Both parties have OP abilities. For me, the game changer is Aizens's stats."

bleach,3akziz,Minktons,5,Mon Jun 22 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"Considering Aizen was planning to go to the Soul Palace before, he probably knows about the royal guard and how strong they will be in comparison to the rest of the Gotei 13. He's probably had a plan on how to deal with them for a while."

bleach,3akziz,oetsuthebest,3,Sun Jun 21 13:18:28 2015 UTC,"Well this is a really good question . I think oetsu might find a way against his sword , i mean it was him who created it . I think only him and ichibe are needed for this fight , but the others might distract him for a while . Oetsu can cut through everything as far as we know . Then ichibe could use his ink or the palm of 1000 ri to simply take him of the palace . The real question is what could have done gin up there ... He isnt nowhere strong to fight againsr them"
bleach,3akziz,Ziazan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Oetsu's too slow to fight Aizen.  Gin could have killed all of them.

bleach,3akziz,oetsuthebest,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:31:23 2015 UTC,"hahahahah look man , i like gin too , but it's the truth , he cant fight them in any possible way , they are past him ... tenjirou catched soifon before she even realized , oetsu killed 3 elites before they realized , ichibei could have killed yhwach if it wasn't for the plot ... you see what i mean ? gin in bankai couldn't kill ichigo , who was way weaker than 0 division ..."
bleach,3akziz,Ziazan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:48:28 2015 UTC,"Gin was on par with ichigo. He could have killed Ichigo easily if it weren't for plot. He just about killed Aizen, came even closer than Ichigo IMO."
bleach,3akziz,oetsuthebest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:48:13 2015 UTC,"As you say , he was par with ichigo. He only succeded because of betrayal surprise , not because he is that strong . He got slayed in actual combat the moment aizen stood up ."
bleach,3akziz,Ziazan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:07:11 2015 UTC,Because Aizen is ridiculous in power. Not the same as comparing Gin to Zero Div.

bleach,3akziz,Ziazan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Aizen could have killed any captain in his base form, Aizen is utterly hax. His stats are insane, but even if we throw his ridiculous stats aside, he's still got the ridiculous Kyoka Suigetsu."

bleach,3akziz,Ziazan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"Hitsu fought Gin while Gin was carefully acting out Aizen's orders, he couldn't just straight up kill the little boy, that would have ruined the proceedings. It's all part of the keikaku."
bleach,3akziz,Zil_v_a,3,Tue Jun 23 23:01:57 2015 UTC,"What people seem to not notice is that Mugetsu or rather the final getsuga tenshou was a technique that made Ichigo godlike. Possession of such a powerful skill might have something to do with the status of Shiba as a royal family. He was above Aizen who was already Above shiningami. Nobody could even feel their reiatsu, since it was so complicated.   I will go as far as to say that the royal guard could do nothing and that even Ichigo could easily beat them (so far he wasn't even trying to defeat anybody in the current arc). I also think that Ichibei could not rename Hogyoku, as it is a godly item, something at the level of the soul king himself."
bleach,3akziz,bobdylan777,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:25:13 2015 UTC,Butterfly could clear the first four and I think he'd evolve to monster form against Ichibe and nuke him from a mile off with Fragor.  At that point his speed and strength should be too high for Ichibe to do anything in close quarters.
bleach,3akziz,Sutanreyu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:27:32 2015 UTC,"He probably could have done something in his butterfly beast mode. He merged with his Zanpakutō's so its abilities are now his, since they were extensions of their soul's anyway. Plus, I don't think Hollow abilities rely on their names..."
bleach,3akziz,SHINee21,0,Mon Jun 22 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"He would rekt them. If Yawch's elites were able to beat the zero division, a transcended being like Aizen would have destroyed them. And Ichibei wouldn't be able to do shit since his abilities will be nullified by Aizen's overpowering reiatsu."

bleach,3al04d,johngriffisgod,10,Sun Jun 21 05:56:56 2015 UTC,"I love the fullbring arc, but most people don't. It's less action more development and mind games. It's definitely better to take it as a whole, so waiting for it to finish will pay off. I suggest watching it instead of reading, they fixed pacing a bit in the anime."

bleach,3al04d,Shunsui_for_CC,2,Mon Jun 22 11:43:27 2015 UTC,"The Fullbring arc is very important to the story. As for how you should go about it, I'd say watch it first then read it. That way you can catch stuff you might have missed and continue on into the current arc when you pick up the manga.  Anime will be back eventually but not in the near future. This sub will be sure to let you know when it does."

bleach,3al04d,Temperatia,2,Sun Jun 21 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"Well, since you're asking me, i'd say watch fullbring arc and just catch up to the manga. You won't feel disappointed."

(TBTP)  A : OOO isn't dead. OOO is perfectly fine in OOOOOO  Q : the so-called OOOOO, do you mean OO is OO?  A : yeap, OO is OO. At that time the candidate was the 10th division vice captain-OOO(nt: someone's name),who was originally to be promoted as captain, but...  Q : Woo, I felt there is an incredible spoilers coming up.

(laugh)  Q : Personally, I would have expect if OOOOO, OO will be the vice captain, but I was totally wrong (laugh)  A : That's interesting (laugh)...   I think perhaps there was a miscommunication here.

bleach,3ai2k6,Kritigri,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:42:02 2015 UTC,Right? I remember thinking that she was a kind of worthless character to be introduced so late. There was nothing stopping Ichigo from working for Urahara instead and helping out his little sister.  Now there's no doubt in my mind that Ikumi is old shinigami and that kind of annoys me. Not because it's a bad plot point but because the one thing Bleach does better than the rest is twists.
bleach,3ai2k6,maytagem,4,Sat Jun 20 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"This is really well done. I know it's not too popular, but I liked the Fullbring arc and am very interested in Ginjo's past. The Ikumi tie in is something I never put much thought into, I just figured she was like Bleachs ""Bulma"" type character, but it makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Hopefully we get a fleshed out background of the Shiba clan at some point."
bleach,3ai2k6,Ombs1993,2,Sat Jun 20 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for bringing up Ikumi especially, I totally forgot about her, and thanks to you I think you may be right, but not about the whole captain thing, but about her being the part of Gotei 13 atleast. Kubo did said in his interview he is going to explain about the clans in this arc which means we'll know about Shiba clan eventually."
bleach,3ai2k6,izn1337,2,Sat Jun 20 14:21:39 2015 UTC,I'd say she was at least the Lieutenant if not the Captain. That would still leave an unknown person as the Captain. No one we currently know fits into that position so it has to be someone we haven't seen yet.
bleach,3ai2k6,izn1337,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"I also thought about something. What if Gotei 13 thought Isshin died at that time? That's why Kyoraku said Captain of the 10th Division died. If we talk about that time, it could be possible Ikumi was 2nd seat (lieutenant) since the 2nd seat of that time is not revealed."
bleach,3ai2k6,izn1337,2,Sat Jun 20 18:45:13 2015 UTC,"Isshin was Captain 80 years after the end of TBTP so it doesn't fit. He most likely wasn't even a Shinigami at that time, possibly not even born."
bleach,3ai2k6,Shunsui_for_CC,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"oh right I forgot! thanks. ah, nevertheless, it's still interesting what Kubo might have saved for us :)"

bleach,3ai2k6,theleetfox,2,Sat Jun 20 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I wrote a whole theory on Ikumi and Shiba's on another forum. I believe that Ikum is Isshin's sister because she acts Shiba-like and her son looks like Karin. I do believe that Ginjou knows about Urahara because he was probably the one to train him. Reread what Jinta said to Ichigo in the Shattered Shaft (there were others who turned to Hollows before the 72 hours were up-who were these others?). I believe that Ginjou and Ikumi know one another than just in the storyline...again meaning more in the way of being a Shiba. Ginjou looks very like the 7th Kenpachi (I believe); then that would make him less Shiba like. But there's a connection between Ginjou, Ikumi; and the Shibas."
bleach,3ai2k6,theleetfox,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"Well she had a child so she'd have to be at the very least in a body from Urahara. Her departure would be a 100 years ago though, so Ginjo's not aging like a human or her gigai's messed up (isshin IMO looks older now then in the flashback, be that he's given a gigai that looks older or the gigai itself aged we'll never know). I personally don't think she is but I like you're outlook on the whole thing, it's an interesting theory."
bleach,3ai2k6,TodenEngel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:12:56 2015 UTC,That's probably one of the only holes that could counter it. Is it possible for her to maybe have used a Gigai similar to the ones used by the Visored? I'm not really too familiar with the specifics and how aging works when it comes to Gigai. Except that the Visored have been able to live in the Human world seemingly without aging at all.
bleach,3ai2k6,TodenEngel,2,Sat Jun 20 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"I always assumed the reason they didn't age but isshin did was due to the fact they still had shinigami souls, Isshins soul reverted to an average soul. Just like in soul society where rukongai souls seem to age fine but shinigami's live much longer times."
bleach,3ai2k6,TodenEngel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well we already know Ginjo hasn't aged. He looks the same now as he did when Tsukishima was a kid, minus the haircut. Also Isshin who lost his powers was basically a human. If Ikumi gave her powers to Ginjo maybe she was the same way."
bleach,3ai2k6,Captain_Garcia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:46:52 2015 UTC,Ginjo later said all the stuff about Isshin he said to get Ichigo's attention.
bleach,3ai2k6,Captain_Garcia,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:38:23 2015 UTC,Yes that is true. But... why would Ikumi abruptly interrupt Ginjo when he mentions Isshin to Ichigo though? Why should she care what a random guy tells him? Unless of course he does actually know something and is in fact not some random guy off the street after all. (to her at least)
bleach,3ai2k6,CRAEREASDW,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"Well she knew it was upsetting Ichigo so maybe she was being all mamabear and wanted him to shut the fuck up. Not saying i dont like your theory which i do, just playin devils advocate."

bleach,3ake9f,KENSEIISHOTAF,-4,Sun Jun 21 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"We can decide what our downvotes mean, basically, to answer your implied question. If someone doesn't like your post, and disagrees with it, or whatever, they reserve the right to downvote away. Whether it's officially or unofficially what it means as defined in the official reddit rules, 99% of downvotes come from people that are telling you they disagree with or dislike your post, plain and simple. It's to let the poster and other readers know what others think of someone's post without having to read each person's lengthy reply. That's what keeps this place run by the community for the most part. This is how reddit works.  Personally I don't vote either way, I just scroll up and down and make my posts, and the arrows are too tiny for me to give a shit. It's just too tedious, WAYYY too tedious to be clicking these arrows.  For all you know there could be many users that feel the same way, and you won't even know if there are like 50 more people that really hate your post. You could have like 50 more downvotes, or maybe even upvotes, if people like me actually cared more to vote one way or the other."

bleach,3akyec,Sandisk4gb4,3,Mon Jun 22 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"My zanpakuto would be a tree type, It's Shikai would turn it into a wooden sword, but the sword would not be clean cut wood, more like a wooden branch but it would still be as sharp and as strong as a normal zanpakuto. In this release form it has the ability to grow and shrink making it possible to trap a sword inside it while fighting. The Bankai would be that My sword turns into a sack of tree seeds. When I throw a seed on the ground, a fully grown oak tree with grass takes that spot. what happens is that the tree is not made of wood nor is the grass made of grass but that the tree is a brown colored metal sword and the blades of grass become blades of small green swords. The grass can change from the size of normal grass til the size of bamboo and the tree branches (all as sharp as sword blades) can be controlled by my hands or mind (like Byakuya's bankai) if you try to stop the seeds from hitting the ground then it will grow on whatever you try to stop it on (ex: if you stop it with your sword, it'll grow on your sword) My special ability in this form is that I can throw down as many seeds at once/control as many metal oaks at once. I would challenge Byakuya Kuchiki to a battle to the death since our zanpakuto's seem similar enough. (What do you guys think of my zanpakuto? sorry if it is hard to follow)"

It didn't follow the manga so it's technically not part of real story.   Here is the list so you skip non essential stuff  http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/bleach   As for skipping the intro music I've never seen what you are asking.

Not the absolute best in japan,  but still one of the best out of the thousands of competing series, and still one of the most INTERNATIONALLY recognized manga/anime series.   Population of japan is roughly 130 million.  Population of america roughly 320 million. Rest of the world accounts for another 7 billion or so.  Here's some more stats. Bleach has sold more manga than the entire lifespan of many manga much older than it, and has sold more than every single manga that started after it. This is even after people are now able to download scans of the comics without paying for shit, and that's saying something.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga  Who's getting all the games, toys, cosplay items, stainless steel swords, movies, and anime episodes made again? Bleach is, along with the other top ones.   It's only being outsold by the very best older series in manga, but its currently rivaling them in sales from all the other content its selling all over the world.  Peope everywhere are agreeing the story has made a huge comeback as well. Half of the shit that sold more manga is done making anime, right there on the list.  You're not analyzing the bleach franchise at all if you're missing out on all that.  There's no arguing whether it's doing well in popularity or money, we can see it's doing magnificently. The only question is whether he wants to and if he made any official statements on it yet."
bleach,3agk25,reigun91,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:24:46 2015 UTC,"Bleach was outsold by a manga that ended 20 years ago. I understand that you are tryimg to defend the series, but be realistic. And yes, it has sold well in its lifetime,  but its no where near as popular as it once was. You don't drop from top 5 to 22nd without a reason."
bleach,3agk25,RogueHippie,4,Sat Jun 20 08:39:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, outsold by the most popular ones, that still print copies for more fans, and there is nothing wrong with bleach or any other manga losing to those. It makes perfect sense. Do we call all new pc games shit because WoW and CS have sold more copies?  And popularity in japan shifts all the time. New kids like new stuff.   But none of that means shit when Japan doesn't represent most of the fanbase, and it makes sales in dozens of countries besides Japan. Its ranking only pulls manga stats from Japan, not the rest of its content, and not the rest of the world where all of its content is being sold to as well.  I'm not being a defensive fanboy, its just annoying when people keep bringing up the same wrong argument and can't back it up. Bleach is doing perfectly fine. Lets stop pretending it's not just because the tiny nation of Japan isnt going apeshit over it right now."
bleach,3agk25,reigun91,-4,Sat Jun 20 08:50:18 2015 UTC,"Bleach hasnt been great in a long time, and most of it is Kubos doing, and editors rushing things as well. And I hate to break it to you: but you are making arguments that a fanboy would make. Even if Bleach sells in other countries, its still being outsold by other mangas in those countries. The anime was canceled, because people stopped watching. Bleach hasnt sold well in america in a long time as well. Its not a wrong argument, the facts are in your face. You are choosimg to overlook them. Also, I dont think just because something sold well it means its better."
bleach,3agk25,Humble_Shopkeeper,0,Sat Jun 20 09:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, the fact that this dude has made literally hundreds of millions of dollars and makes several million for each volume he sells, let alone what he makes from each time a chapter is released in Shonen Jump. The anime stopping means nothing, its just paused so he doesnt make another crap ton of filler and disappoint just his hardcore japanese fans. He's still raking in money from re runs, game sales, shonen, and the separate volumes. I dont know what part of multiple sources of income making him hundreds of millions you don't understand. Anyways, you all enjoyed each arc and only pretend to hate the filler arcs to fit in with the hardcore japanese fans, most of you guys here anyway. The tv network didnt cancel it cuz the ratings were too bad. He just knew it was bad PR to keep doing long, long streams of fillers, and him and his team decided to halt on making new episodes until its clear hes about to finish this arc. Its the same pattern we saw while all the other arcs were being released, filler comes out, then the main parts again, people still watch, he still makes millions. Everyone praises SS as the best arc and say it went downhill from there, well look at how many seasons came after, all the filler between the final aizen fight arc, and that hes making shit tons, literal shit tons of cash. No one sees the pattern just because of the slight pause?   Well if you guys still want to believe he's doing bad and will ditch this franchise after this arc solely because new anime episodes havent come out recently, be my guest. I'm just glad none of you are business majors or financial advisors, but Kubo doesn't need someone to tell him how he's doing, his bank account and continued contract with Shonen jump and game devs says enough to him."
bleach,3agk25,reigun91,2,Sat Jun 20 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"The anime was canceled, Studio Pierrot stated that it was canceled. Shows are not ""paused"" in Japan, they tend to come back with a different name (an example is Fairy Tail 2014). If it isn't stated to be on hiatus, then don't expect it to come back. It doesn't matter how much he has sold, it still comes down to the fact that bleach is no where near as popular as it once was. Nor as entertaining. Do I still enjoy? Yes, very much so. Can I see its glaring flaws? Yes, and still continue to read despite that. In case you were unaware (which seems to be the case) the last episode aired, while it was already 4 chapters into the last arc. Despite that it was still canceled, not put on hiatus, and the ratings weren't bad, they were terrible."

bleach,3ab9ks,Sirocco_,37,Fri Jun 19 14:41:07 2015 UTC,Most likely yes and I cannot wait. I want to know what happened to them. They were most likely killed in battle so I guess that means Yamamoto and Unohana were in completely different leagues.
bleach,3ab9ks,Alluka-,10,Thu Jun 18 18:26:07 2015 UTC,Did we have any confirmation that Yamamoto and Unohana are the only two from the original Gotei?
bleach,3ab9ks,Tmccaffery,18,Thu Jun 18 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"Not directly but it's stated that Yamamoto, Unohana, Shunsui and Ukitake are the oldest captains. From this information we can say that they are in fact the only two from the original Gotei."
bleach,3ab9ks,Alluka-,13,Thu Jun 18 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"Kirinji was in the original Gotei 13, and possibly Hikifune. Shunsui does state once Hikifune is promoted: ""Now that means you, me, and Yama-jii are the only ones left who have been captains for more than 100 years"" (Ukitake corrects him with Unohana's name). She doesn't necessarily have to be from the original Gotei, but I see it as a distinct possibility. We know she was at least involved in the Quincy massacre 200 years ago.  We also don't have confirmation regarding Shunsui and Ukitake's ages, so it's always possible they were in the Gotei."
bleach,3ab9ks,Andygoesrawr,12,Fri Jun 19 00:26:09 2015 UTC,"Isn't it impossible for Shunsui and Ukitake to have been a part of the original Gotei though? Shunsui was just a kid when we got the flashback of him asking about the painting on the wall. Also, is it possible that Oetsu was an original member since he was promoted to RG later?  As for the massacre 200 years ago there are only a few empty Captain seats that are hard to account for.  1 - Yamamoto 2 - ??? (Shihoin) 3 - ??? (retired?, Rose promoted ~100 years ago) 4 - Unohana 5 - ??? (Shinji?) 6 - ??? 7 - ??? (Love?) 8 - Shunsui 9 - ??? (Kensei?) 10 - ??? (Vacant seat in TBTP, possibly killed) 11 - ??? 12 - Hikifune 13 - Ukitake   edit: removed Ginrei and Kiganjo"
bleach,3ab9ks,Alluka-,8,Fri Jun 19 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"We don't know when that flashback was from. The flashback shows a painting of Yamamoto using Zanjitsu Gokui, which we know for a fact he didn't use against Yhwach 1,000 years ago. So the painting is likely of a time before that, which means Shunsui and Ukitake could be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old.  Ginrei and Kiganjou were not captains 200 years ago. Shunsui, Ukitake, Yamamoto, Unohana, and Hikifune were the only ones who were captains 200 years ago and still captains 100 years ago. That leaves 8 captains unaccounted for.  Ouetsu is possible, but IMO he probably became a Royal Guard before the Gotei 13 was created. Zanpakutou existed 2,100 years ago, and the Gotei 13 was created 1,000 years ago. That's 1,100 years of time for his invention to be recognised. Ichibe'e and Senjumaru are also unlikely to have made it to the creation of the Gotei before being promoted, IMO."
bleach,3ab9ks,Andygoesrawr,7,Fri Jun 19 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"Hm interesting.  I guess that means Squad 6 could've been Ginrei's father and Squad 11 the 9th Kenpachi.  I doubt we will be shown all the Captains to ever exist (or will we?) so it might be difficult to figure some things out. Aside from the original members and the active Captains from 200 years ago, do you think we will see any others?"
bleach,3ab9ks,Alluka-,6,Fri Jun 19 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like all we need to see is the original Gotei 13. The rest we can piece together, and the ones we never meet don't really matter since that means they had no impact on the current story.  The only one other than the original captains I would've liked to see is the 10th Division captain from 100 years ago. That was probably Kaien's father, Isshin's older brother."
bleach,3ab9ks,Andygoesrawr,5,Fri Jun 19 02:27:52 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense.  We know that the Shiba clan fell from nobility after Kaien's death. I wonder if the missing 10th Division Captain had a role to play in that as well. Unless the sole reason was because Isshin went MIA.
bleach,3ab9ks,Alluka-,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely Yama and Unohana and Hikifune. Possibly Ukitake and Shunsui. But I think we may see older royal families in there such as Kuchikis and Shibas. Not really sure though, I'm pretty excited to see."
bleach,3ab9ks,mognats,4,Fri Jun 19 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he forgot about her because she used to be go by Yachiru.  Or just Kenpachi.  Or if her demeanor changed so much he just forgot to include her.  Also, she's the first Kenpachi.  I guess we don't know how old the title is, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were as old as the Gotei."
bleach,3ab9ks,doodleysquat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"i dont think shunsui and ukitake were part of the original divisions because no one in the flashback photo seems to be one of them . plus he said they could strive fear in his heart , were really fearsome and murderous , and ukitake and shunsui for example arent known to be that fearsome"
bleach,3ab9ks,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:12:43 2015 UTC,"The person to the left of Unohana looks a lot like a short-haired Ukitake. Other than that, only 6 people were shown so we have no idea who the other 7 could be. Shunsui could be any of them.  Shunsui is absolutely known to be fearsome. When he's in a manic episode he's pretty terrifying, and Ukitake has shown to be quite serious in battle. Ukitake's probably mellowed out a lot as his illness overcame him."
bleach,3ab9ks,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:36:25 2015 UTC,"it could be , but it dont feels right to me . i still cant see shunsui and ukitake striving fear in yhwach's heart , on the contrary of someone like unohana ."
bleach,3ab9ks,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:03:13 2015 UTC,I've always imagined the person shown to the right of Yamaj-jii is Ginrei Kuchiki.
bleach,3ab9ks,necrosxiaoban,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think Shunsui and Ukitake are part of the original gotei. I'll be using some info I remember from the anime, I'm not sure if they say that in the manga, Yama-jii said at some point that he took care of Shunsui and Ukitake when they were on the academy, both showed a lot of promise. Ukitake get along pretty well with everybody and Shunsui was always chasing girls"
bleach,3ab9ks,ludicrouscuriosity,2,Fri Jun 19 04:22:46 2015 UTC,If I remember right Yama says they were the first captains from the academy he created and I believe( not entirely sure) that the shino academy was created after Yama beat yhwach.
bleach,3ab9ks,DjMcK14,-4,Fri Jun 19 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"There may be more, like maybe mayuri, but nothing is confirmed"
bleach,3ab9ks,kingofdabz,8,Thu Jun 18 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"no man , i dont think mayuri was one . plus , yhwach said they were a bunch of bloodthirsty thugs , and mayuri aint one"
bleach,3ab9ks,oetsuthebest,-3,Thu Jun 18 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"Mayuri is sinister and thug like in his behavior. The way he does things without telling anyone, how he kills without malice, tortures his own subordinates without malice, with actual enjoyment. Etc."
bleach,3ab9ks,kingofdabz,9,Thu Jun 18 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"If Mayuri was part of the original Gotei, he'd have likely been a captain before Urahara rather than after him. In fact, he probably would have been a member of the Gotei rather than a prisoner when Urahara went after him. It's doubtful he was originally in the ranks, but anything is possible through the power of the almighty retcon."
bleach,3ab9ks,JinHikari,7,Thu Jun 18 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"Pardon me, I actually forgot he became a captain after urahara. But him being a prisoner makes me wonder, did it ever say why he was a prisoner? It could be because of the 1000 year blood war. Because mayuri did seem to know a lot about that war, as if he saw Yama there himself, when he talked about Yama not being able to kill yhwach the first time."
bleach,3ab9ks,kingofdabz,3,Thu Jun 18 20:54:41 2015 UTC,I think he somehow found it out later . Like aizen for example : he knows of yhwach even though he was nowhere to be seen 1000 years ago
bleach,3ab9ks,oetsuthebest,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put it past Mayuri to be somehow part of the original Gotei. He's been shown to not give a fuck about his subordinates. Remember when he blew up a ton for giggles?  It'd be a bit confusing since he became a captain after Urahara, but it begs the question: why was he in the Maggot's Nest? (atrocities from the old war?)"
bleach,3ab9ks,MrFahrenheit39,3,Thu Jun 18 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"There could be plenty of other crimes he could have done man ... And i dont think they would imprison him for crimes during the blood war while all the others(yama included )did plenty . A captain has plenty privileges . They could imprison him now if that was it ,but it isnt it"

He said his division destroyed them but that seems like a waste. I think he created a Hogyouku. I mean Aizen created an incomplete Hogyouku dozens-hundreds of Shinigami souls over a century or more. Would 28k regular souls and potential Shinigami make one for Mayuri?   If so does he have a plan to complete it with something from the Soul Kings realm?"
bleach,3afzqr,voodoochileirl,6,Fri Jun 19 22:51:47 2015 UTC,He killed them and sent them back to the human realm. Turning them into a Hougyoku wouldn't fix the balance...
bleach,3afzqr,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"But I thought he had to destroy them utterly, like the Quincy do to Hollows in order to fix the balance?  I mean sending 28k to the human world would mean there was now more souls in the human world then Soul Society and nothing was fixed. Though I suppose if there were 56k Hollows destroyed that might make sense.  He could have also been lying with what he did with the souls."
bleach,3afzqr,voodoochileirl,2,Sat Jun 20 13:43:30 2015 UTC,"The Shinigami despise Quincies for the fact that they destroy Hollows. Why would the Shinigami destroy souls themselves to fix what they did? If there's a set soul pool, doing that would just exponentially make the problem worse over time.  The idea is, as you said, that there were 56,000 Hollows destroyed by the Quincies, so Mayuri killed 28,000 souls in Soul Society to send them to the human realm, correcting the balance.  Shinigami don't have the power to destroy souls, otherwise the immortals imprisoned in Muken would just be destroyed."
bleach,3afzqr,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:59:57 2015 UTC,I hadn't even thought of that but Mayuri would do something like that out of curiosity.
bleach,3afzqr,richiegraine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"Like I have said before, I do not think that Mayuri is an ""evil"" character. He simply gets to execute his orders from his position, and given the state SS is in, there are no bounds at this point. Maybe what he was doing was fishy, but if he has to kill some to kill Ywach I don't think it'll be a big deal. Also, I must have missed this chapter? exactly which chapter are you referring to?"
bleach,3afzqr,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:07:29 2015 UTC,I'm referring specifically to the dialogue prior to Kenpachi's return in 629.
bleach,3afzqr,NogardSoahk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:14:22 2015 UTC,"And I agree, generally, I also think Mayuri has time and again demonstrated actual loyalty to SS generally, even if he sometimes appears willing to cross ""small picture"" ethical lines (i.e., turning teh Zombified soul reapers into ""his"" zombies rather than ""curing"" them).  Maybe I'm just tired and bored."
bleach,3afzqr,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"No, see, the zombie switch you mentioned gave me the same mental itch. While he never seems explicitly evil or going to turn against SS he does always seem suspect and shady as all hell. I don't know whether its simply amazing character development, writing, and his general back story that makes me feel this way or if it may simply be hints and warnings of something to come remains to be seen.   But either way, yeah. He gives me the heebie jeebies."
bleach,3afzqr,Bitterkiwi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:29:06 2015 UTC,I think that might just be the combination of everything. He was created to be a creepy character.

bleach,3a9h1q,Hichigo,86,Thu Jun 18 08:04:09 2015 UTC,Damn. You know we think Kubo forgets about stuff but even minor stuff like that he remembers.

bleach,3a9h1q,Hichigo,49,Thu Jun 18 08:18:40 2015 UTC,I really really hope the editors let Kubo do his thing and tell the story his way.
bleach,3a9h1q,Captain-Turtle,8,Thu Jun 18 08:21:06 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that Byakuya came back after that heart warming speech to Ichigo and dying hints to know.

bleach,3a9h1q,Hichigo,8,Thu Jun 18 12:34:52 2015 UTC,I think that one of the shinigami that was cut down by the Soldats was the same shinigami that hit on Orihime when she and Uryu were in disguise.

bleach,3a9h1q,H4xolotl,16,Thu Jun 18 08:47:39 2015 UTC,"We've known this since they were first shown. Yama didn't know it was only an imitation, he genuinely thought he was talking to Ywach when he said ""your subordinates"".   Royd knew who they were because he's able to copy another's memories (it's possible he knew them himself, but not really that important seeing as he copied Ywach's memories anyway)."
bleach,3a9h1q,Hichigo,16,Thu Jun 18 14:05:06 2015 UTC,we will see them original Gotei 13

bleach,3a9h1q,Hichigo,2,Thu Jun 18 08:29:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, rereading that page, is that fear in Yhwach's eyes?  He looks calmer on the next page, but those eyes look like just the memory of the original Gotei 13 scares him."
bleach,3a9h1q,docmedic,8,Thu Jun 18 15:17:28 2015 UTC,Bruhhhh they probably got annihilated by Yamamoto.
bleach,3a9h1q,SlimSmokey,74,Thu Jun 18 08:13:53 2015 UTC,so that's where the hair came from

bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,3,Thu Jun 18 09:26:13 2015 UTC,"well ywach's power thingy is a reversal of sorts. The more you sucked the stronger you became under his... influence. If Bazz was already strong, his powers wouldn't have done much for him, at least in comparison to what it would do for someone like Jugo (who apparently sucked).  At least I think."
bleach,3a9h1q,RekkinEM,8,Thu Jun 18 12:05:34 2015 UTC,Or Jugo just worked really really hard and got better.  I just realized Jugo never used a bow and arrow.  Probably because he never could form one. :O
bleach,3a9h1q,docmedic,2,Thu Jun 18 15:18:36 2015 UTC,Bazz-B's logo looking like an arrow drawn up in a bow is ingenious. Kubo's amazing designs strikes again!
bleach,3a9h1q,Shippoyasha,58,Fri Jun 19 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"So the both of them wanted to pull a Gin from the very beginning?  On the other hand: Could it be that Hashbrown either 1) killed his uncle himself or 2) asked Yhwach to do it for him? Setting the village on fire was either collateral damage or an attempt to hide the truth from Bazz, who now is the only one left for Hashbrown?"
bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,45,Thu Jun 18 08:06:02 2015 UTC,"How cute, they plotted to kill Yhwach when they were cute little kids, kinda like how Gin miserably failed to defeat Aizen for his revenge too, ultimately. Kids remember this lesson: when planning to kill a guy like Yhwach who fucking burned your village down in your childhood, always bring a partner."
bleach,3a9h1q,kisae,27,Thu Jun 18 08:07:00 2015 UTC,I swear this panel reminds me of Eren and Armin.
bleach,3a9h1q,Nelo10Angelo,14,Thu Jun 18 10:53:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say miserably..  Aizen himself said that had the Hygou thingy (really not about to even try) had just evolved again, like in that moment. Had Gin been any sooner (at least according to Aizen) he very well may have succeeded.  But yeah, he didn't."

Is something being implied here? Or am I reading waaaaay too far into it.  EDIT: Mistook Haschwalds Uncle for Bazz B at a glace, my bad. I figured the two lines together meant something, but the second is clearly just excitement of meeting a new friend at that age. Though that means poor Haschwald is getting abused by his uncle :("
bleach,3a9h1q,soravx,38,Thu Jun 18 07:56:54 2015 UTC,But I say it's good to know that Hashbrown is neither Yhwachs biological son nor his first quincy... Perhaps he is his first Sternritter?
bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,31,Thu Jun 18 08:09:35 2015 UTC,"Yhwach called him his #1 son, not necessarily his first son. He was just calling him the best Sternritter."
bleach,3a9h1q,tchales7,31,Thu Jun 18 08:28:49 2015 UTC,"I hope we see a ""#1 son"" mug in some of these flashbacks"
bleach,3a9h1q,HaveAnUpgoat,6,Thu Jun 18 10:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm imagining Yhwach as Hashbrown's actual father, taking him on trips to the Hollow zoo, fussing over his grades, attending his graduation, etc."
bleach,3a9h1q,water_warrior,5,Thu Jun 18 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"You can't exactly say that just yet- he said he didn't have parents, so it's possible that Yhwach had a son with some woman who died in childbirth and was raised by her brother or something like that.  I'd say it's about a 50/50 chance Hashbrowns is Yhwach's biological son as well as the first Sternritter."
bleach,3a9h1q,ElModeloEnPace,67,Thu Jun 18 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"That was his uncle. It seems implied his uncle abuses him... he calls him Jugo, and he tells Bazz he hates that name."
bleach,3a9h1q,viatoretvenus,31,Thu Jun 18 08:15:11 2015 UTC,"It seems implied his uncle abuses him...   Holy fuck... yup. I just assumed it was another character that would be significant later on. It would be like his sister or some girl he was in love with, but you're totally right. His uncle abuses him and Ywach killing the uncle is why Hashbrowns decides to really devote himself to him as opposed to fake devoting himself to Ywach.   The commitment both Bazz-B and Jugo show towards Ywach was confusing to me if he killed everyone they knew and loved, but this makes so much more sense now."
bleach,3a9h1q,docmedic,12,Thu Jun 18 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"Also, Haschwalth is clutching his own bruised arm here, and Bazz even notices this, that's why he helped Haschwalth. It could have been due to Haschwalth's difficulty in hunting, though Bazz wouldn't know for sure, Haschwalth's wounds could in fact be from his uncle..."
bleach,3a9h1q,CRAEREASDW,3,Thu Jun 18 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"They're hunting rabbits though.  I think Bazz knew that Haschwalth got those wounds from his guardian, but assumed it was punishment since Haschwalth kept failing to catch anything.  He didn't know Haschwalth hated his uncle for possibly sexually abusing him."
bleach,3a9h1q,kasim42784,23,Thu Jun 18 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"No, it's heavily implied his uncle molests him from not only the uncle's words but also Haschwalth's body language. He might in fact be grateful to Yhwach for the fire and secretly sees him as a savior (explaining his loyalty).  Haschwalth is like the Rukia to Bazz-B's Renji. They could be close friends or maybe even lovers, though they seemed to have drifted apart over time. I don't think you'll ever know for sure, especially since they're both going to die."
bleach,3a9h1q,BoomersGold,6,Thu Jun 18 08:36:29 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't look too much into that first quote but the right after you read the second quote, the last panel on that page reads ""friend"". so i'm guessing that feeling is friendship. or maybe bazz b has a raging boner for jugram."
bleach,3a9h1q,Keranu,4,Thu Jun 18 08:10:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the first line was his ""uncle"" or whoever was Haschwalth's guardian at the time. Bazz-B clearly leaves the scene in the panel before this."
bleach,3a9h1q,TransposableElements,12,Thu Jun 18 08:11:56 2015 UTC,"The first line heavily implies pedophilia, the second could just relate to childhood friendships"
bleach,3a9h1q,nvrwastetree,14,Thu Jun 18 08:01:36 2015 UTC,wait... 5 fingers??? aint that just fisting??
bleach,3a9h1q,whatacrappyusername,3,Thu Jun 18 08:03:43 2015 UTC,He didn't go 5 knuckle deep.
bleach,3a9h1q,lime9391,2,Thu Jun 18 09:51:30 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the side text? In the MS translation:  ""Two young boys meet under the resplendent sun and a tension akin to awkward embarrassment fills the air.""   But yeah his uncle was definitely abusing him. Jugo looks beat up in the title page."
bleach,3a9h1q,Iniura,2,Thu Jun 18 15:51:50 2015 UTC,Yea that line was pretty creepy.
bleach,3a9h1q,master32x,43,Thu Jun 18 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"Some things you guys would've missed because of Mangapanda:   Their kingdom is called Lichtreich (Empire of Light). Yhwach has The Almighty activated on the last page, with two irises.   Luckily I think that's about it. On the page with no text, it says ""Jugram Haschwalth"". Nothing special."
bleach,3a9h1q,reigun91,29,Thu Jun 18 07:59:12 2015 UTC,So essentially Yamamoto beat Yhwach even though he already had ''The Almighty''.   Just goes to show how much of a powerhouse he must've been back in the day!
bleach,3a9h1q,mostafasalah,7,Thu Jun 18 10:16:19 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of Sasuke's fight against Lee: ""What does it matter if you can see an attack if you lack the ability to do anything about it"""

bleach,3a9h1q,H4xolotl,35,Fri Jun 19 01:19:19 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted because I was definitely not expecting Bazz-B and Haschwalth to be 1,000 years old."
bleach,3a9h1q,hardlyfatal,19,Thu Jun 18 08:07:54 2015 UTC,I always thought the Quincy were normal people. I mean how the fuck can they live for hundreds of years?
bleach,3a9h1q,H4xolotl,13,Thu Jun 18 09:37:08 2015 UTC,"Probably the Shatten Bereich ages people differently, or maybe a Schrift makes a Quincy age a lot slower."
bleach,3a9h1q,DodneyRangerfield,4,Thu Jun 18 10:28:01 2015 UTC,"thats fucked up, even the oldest SS captains ukitake & Shunsui are younger than 1000"
bleach,3a9h1q,persona_dos,13,Thu Jun 18 10:50:57 2015 UTC,"No, they're over 2000 also-- Shunsui was a kid rifling through Yama-jii's belongings when the old guy was still young, around when the shinigami were just created, and that was ~2000 years ago."
bleach,3a9h1q,sauvig,7,Thu Jun 18 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"Wait, so the Quincy vs Shinigami war was 1000 years ago ?  Then what disastrous event was Yama talking about when Shunsui invaded his room 2000 years ago? Could Shunsui have fought vs Quincies before?  Bit off topic, but was there a second Quincy Shinigami war 100 years ago that left Uryu's grandfather one of the little remaining Quincy in the human world?"
bleach,3a9h1q,SlimSmokey,7,Thu Jun 18 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"Wait, so the Quincy vs Shinigami war was 1000 years ago ?   Well the name of the arc is literally ""The thousand year blood war"""
bleach,3a9h1q,Perpetualjoke,11,Thu Jun 18 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Yamamoto was talking about something other than the Quincy war when talking to Shunsui. Firstly, he says that he made the situation in Soul Society worse -- the Quincy war took place in the human realm. Secondly, the picture shows Zanjitsu Gokui, which he didn't use against Yhwach 1,000 years ago since neither Yhwach nor Haschwalth recognised the technique. Other than that, Ukitake and Shunsui were Yamamoto's first students to become captains after graduation. He was teaching 1,000 years before the Gotei 13 was created, and not one of his students was powerful/skilled enough to make it into the original Gotei 13? Sounds like a lousy teacher.  It'd explain why he didn't use the full power of his Bankai against Yhwach. He says to Shunsui, ""If [I ever use Bankai again], I won't be coming back.""  I'm guessing he used Bankai in a fit of rage, maybe when Ichibe'e was promoted to the Royal Guard over him. He used to be that kind of person.  There was an extermination 200 years ago."
bleach,3a9h1q,docmedic,19,Thu Jun 18 15:44:27 2015 UTC,I'm curious if their friendship is set up to parallel the friendship between Uryuu and Ichigo. I'm sure it is but figured it would be a good point of discussion.
bleach,3a9h1q,Mekbop,5,Thu Jun 18 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"this also jumped to my mind. Idk if it will specifically be the same, but it seems similar, just that ichigo and uryu were older when this sort of relationship kicked in."
bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,36,Thu Jun 18 08:02:16 2015 UTC,Ywach is literally Hitler going out and conquering everything.

bleach,3a9h1q,Fred_MK,15,Thu Jun 18 10:01:12 2015 UTC,Bazz was in the Spartan II program.  Hope the next volume is a flashback arc with some cuts to Bazz and Jugo fighting.
bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,14,Thu Jun 18 12:33:38 2015 UTC,Just when you think Kubo can't squeeze anymore storylines....he comes back with   a gallon of Bleach.
bleach,3a9h1q,H4xolotl,12,Thu Jun 18 08:19:54 2015 UTC,Concentrated at that.

Now let us embark on our life long quest to avenge my family and our clan!""  Ooooo Flashback chapter! I love it! I'm glad we're seeing some backstory on Bazz-B and Hashbrowns. Bazz-B especially.   I wonder how in-depth they will go in this flashback. Probably not much but I would love to see some of the original Gotei 13 in this flashback. Next week can't come soon enough"
bleach,3a9h1q,StarkTheWolf,11,Thu Jun 18 13:04:18 2015 UTC,"So this is not TBTP2 but close enough. I'm okay with this. Jugram and Bazz-B bromance taking over the manga, i dont even remember the protagonist name.  Now, please don't take them away from me Kubo, not yet. It is too soon."
bleach,3a9h1q,Syborg49,7,Thu Jun 18 08:02:06 2015 UTC,"It could still be a TBTP2. Not an entire mini-arc, but I think he'll squeeze out a lot of flashbacks over the course of the volume. He could easily change the perspective of the flashbacks by showing the face of another character at the current time before fading away. Yhwach can be used to show more of the creation of the Sternritter, and Ichibe'e could be used to show the events around the same time from the perspective of the Shinigami. We might even see the Soul King before he lost his limbs."
bleach,3a9h1q,H4xolotl,3,Thu Jun 18 11:54:09 2015 UTC,"""Since when were you under the impression he lost his limbs?""  And it will be a flashback arc but this intersections between past and present sort of ruin the mood imo. Pick one. Still, can't wait for Bazz-B cover"

bleach,3a9h1q,Verlux,7,Thu Jun 18 09:33:30 2015 UTC,Reminds me of a certain someone in the Berserk manga...
bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,5,Thu Jun 18 16:49:23 2015 UTC,And Yhwach his behelit...
bleach,3a9h1q,rigaj,11,Thu Jun 18 12:17:40 2015 UTC,"Bazz was the stronger one when they were children?  Oh ho, Juha is in for a beating. Wait, does this mean Bazz and Haschwalth are 1000+ years old?!!  Ha!  Juha gave Bazz a fire Schrift to rub it in."

bleach,3a9h1q,Kr4d105s2,48,Thu Jun 18 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"Wait.  From what is said on the 16th page, the Quincies have actually conquered any ""available"" country in the world. Yhwach went Quincy Hitler on the world, yet nobody has heard of the Quincy for 200 years in the Bleach timeline? What the hell did they conquer then if it went unnoticed by any major figure? Wouldn't even Ichigo's not-so-bright ass have noticed major news reports on a weird army that fires arrows conquering modern countries?"
bleach,3a9h1q,jurble,30,Thu Jun 18 17:17:20 2015 UTC,I hoped Yhwach would look more like the younger version of Tensa Zangetsu back then... too bad
bleach,3a9h1q,Verlux,33,Thu Jun 18 08:00:45 2015 UTC,He was already 200 years old by that point.

bleach,3a9h1q,Kr4d105s2,21,Thu Jun 18 08:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he definitely seems to be the Bleach universe's Charlemagne.  The Massacre of Verden is probably the real world equivalent of Yhwach destroying Bazz and Jugram's home.  EDIT: Wait, that doesn't work. Too early."

bleach,3a9h1q,Piccolito,3,Thu Jun 18 12:53:48 2015 UTC,He did when he was a child.  Remember Yhwach when he was resurrected 10 years ago would have looked the same as his adult self 1000 years ago.
bleach,3a9h1q,S0ulMadness,16,Thu Jun 18 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like Kubo is finally deciding to explain where the Sternritter came from.  Based on this chapter, it seems they're all from the past somehow.  This jives with Yhwach saying who knows how many chapters ago that Ishida was last living Quincy when he introduced him to the Sternritter."
bleach,3a9h1q,Mechanicalmind,9,Thu Jun 18 17:27:38 2015 UTC,Does this mean the Sternritter are nearly as old as Ywach? Does that mean they all get his immortality?
bleach,3a9h1q,YachiruTheKittyKat,3,Thu Jun 18 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"Are we sure about that? Cuz that would make every Quincy over 1000 years old, and further, they would still be known worldwide for being a superhuman race of conquerors, yes? So how did none of the humans in the Bleach-verse know what a Quincy was until it was explained?"
bleach,3a9h1q,DemRocks,13,Thu Jun 18 08:22:27 2015 UTC,"The shinigami have the means to erase memories from humans, so they could have easily destroyed knowledge of the Quincies."
bleach,3a9h1q,SputterNutter,33,Thu Jun 18 12:45:57 2015 UTC,This all happened over 1000 years ago. It seems Bazz B and Jugram grew up in 900s Germany.
bleach,3a9h1q,Nnoitrum,21,Thu Jun 18 08:22:20 2015 UTC,The Christian Crusades to reach the Holy Land in our time was 1000 years ago as well.
bleach,3a9h1q,BoomersGold,23,Thu Jun 18 08:49:47 2015 UTC,And the quincy cross.. Holy shit is Kubo saying that the quincies were actually the Crusaders? This is pretty awesome

bleach,3a9h1q,aizen6,9,Thu Jun 18 08:12:49 2015 UTC,Do the Quincies live in their own world or did the flashback take place on Earth?
bleach,3a9h1q,BerrySZ,19,Thu Jun 18 11:41:21 2015 UTC,"This flashback is the human realm. Bazz states Yhwach has lived for 200 years, which means it was before he was sealed 1,000 years ago."
bleach,3a9h1q,temujin404,3,Thu Jun 18 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"So does that mean Jugo and Bazz are the strongest because their old as all hell? I remember reading somewhere cuz of that poem or whatever that alot of the sternritter came about 9 years ago, Bazz and Jugo seem to be alive for Jewbacca's human world shit before he was sealed. I wonder if this is like, bazz and jugo lived in poland and Yhwach is hitler..."
bleach,3a9h1q,Lawloh,8,Thu Jun 18 08:18:58 2015 UTC,"Also, I feel like Jugram probably had a life much like Alucard or Guts. Which isn't very pretty, and would seem like a good reason for Jugram to stay by bachs side."
bleach,3a9h1q,temujin404,17,Thu Jun 18 08:13:28 2015 UTC,"So, is this implying that the Soul Reapers weren't the aggressors from one thousand years ago?"

bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,13,Thu Jun 18 08:19:18 2015 UTC,"No, all the shit Bleach gets is 100% deserved. It's just that Bleach also does a ton of awesome stuff. Some of it is recognized like character design and character driven story. Others are overlooked or forgotten. The good doesn't excuse the bad, and the bad doesn't negate the good. They both combine to make up his overall ability and the story in general."

bleach,3a9h1q,feezaks,23,Thu Jun 18 08:21:19 2015 UTC,"Zeidritz actually said they've run out of regions of Lichtreich to suppress. I'm guessing it's meant to be the Kingdom of Germany, and he's running around his land showing them who's boss."
bleach,3a9h1q,HaveAnUpgoat,2,Thu Jun 18 08:27:24 2015 UTC,Soul Society wiped all knowledge about Yhwach perhaps? Although I thought the shinigami would keep out of living world stuff...
bleach,3a9h1q,5yk0515,10,Thu Jun 18 09:05:59 2015 UTC,jugo looks a lot like tensa zangetsu
bleach,3a9h1q,jns701,8,Thu Jun 18 09:13:01 2015 UTC,Except Yhwach's much younger version was confirmed to be Tensa Zangetsu.  Jugo looking like him is probably a side effect of Kubo not choosing a face much more different than Tensa Zangetsu's.
bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,5,Thu Jun 18 09:36:13 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to see how far Hashbrown is willing to go against Bazz B, given their being former best friends and whatnot."
bleach,3a9h1q,Shunsui_for_CC,3,Thu Jun 18 09:41:03 2015 UTC,Were they really friends? It looked like the flashbacks were from Bazz's perspective. Maybe Bazz thought Haschwalth was his friend. But Haschwalth hasn't shown any interest or affection for Bazz as a friend.
bleach,3a9h1q,PhuturePhil,4,Thu Jun 18 08:06:30 2015 UTC,"Great chapter, I'm loving the flashback: seeing that old soldier from 1000 years ago that Yama killed, and bazz and hash wanted to kill yhwach from the start. I wouldn't mind if this flashback gets lengthy and we get to see the start of the first war where Yama went apeshit"
bleach,3a9h1q,HetzerHetzesHetzly,4,Thu Jun 18 10:15:12 2015 UTC,"Getting a mild Griffith vibe from Haschwalth. He got the bad touch from his uncle, and so he's actually grateful to Yhwach for killing him then. I have a very good feeling about this flashback, we are going to learn a LOT."
bleach,3a9h1q,PhuturePhil,5,Thu Jun 18 08:30:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, Bazz-b and Haschwald were around 1000 years ago with Juha Conquering (basically) the world. I really liked this chapter; flashbacks and more incite around these Quincies."
bleach,3a9h1q,yanabana,4,Thu Jun 18 15:17:39 2015 UTC,Yhwach is totally like Zangetsu and I love that.
bleach,3a9h1q,SHINee21,3,Thu Jun 18 08:38:24 2015 UTC,I am confused. Did this happen in the human realm or in the Schattenbereich?
bleach,3a9h1q,COMPLIMENT-4-U,4,Thu Jun 18 09:07:43 2015 UTC,Wait. WAIT WAIT. If the guy who died a thousand years ago is there. Then this takes place over a thousand years ago. So does that make the sternritter over a thousand years old? Then why arent they dressed like it is a thousand years in the past?
bleach,3a9h1q,Sirocco_,3,Thu Jun 18 08:48:09 2015 UTC,"Then why arent they dressed like it is a thousand years in the past?   Glad you asked this, this is actually my biggest concern. Fashion was not like that back then..."

bleach,3a9h1q,29thspirit,7,Fri Jun 19 08:09:59 2015 UTC,I am quickly starting to like Bazz B's character.  I feel like that means Kubo has marked him for death after this flashback sequence lol.
bleach,3a9h1q,tchales7,3,Thu Jun 18 08:00:54 2015 UTC,He's in a flashback sequence and not a Main Character. He is 100% going to die within 3 pages of the end of the flashback.
bleach,3a9h1q,reigun91,2,Thu Jun 18 14:02:58 2015 UTC,Yeah thats basically the Kubo recipe for intriguing side characters lol

bleach,3a9h1q,GreatSharkSon,15,Thu Jun 18 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"It seemed like he had one of those uncles that liked to ""wrestle"", which would make sense that Jugram would want to stay by Yhwachs side. He ""saved"" him, from a terrible life."

Coyote Starrk is named after A French designer (Philipe Starck.) And guess what? Ulquiorra is named after a Spanish Architect.  Grimmjow is named after Nicholas Grimshaw (An American architect) and Jaeger LeCoultre (A french designer and clock maker)  You'll find that most of these names come from Architects/Designers.

I don't see Haschwalth being the big bad because he doesn't really have a reason to other than his loyalty to Yhwach.

I assume Bach will eventually be shown to have pulled a similar move with Haschwalt and Bazz B, allowing Haschwalth to leap-frog Bazz's power by making him his right hand, but we'll see.  whatever it is, I believe Haschwalth is truly loyal at this point."

It's a combination of the White and the Black Getsuga. Not a combination of 2 white Getsugas.  And I believe both swords can only shoot one type. OMZ shoots White, Hollow  Zangetsu (or whatever the fuck we call him now) shoots Black."
bleach,3a8cnh,Andygoesrawr,13,Thu Jun 18 10:33:13 2015 UTC,His white Getsuga was always drawn with a black outline. That's how white things are drawn.
bleach,3a8cnh,angryspacemahreen,-3,Thu Jun 18 10:55:37 2015 UTC,"Not at all. ""Black Outline"" as in black decals around it. You don't get it.  First picture you'll see lots of black decals between the cross shape's arms. I'm not saying Black as in the way white is drawn.  Also, the bigger sword shooting the smaller sword's getsuga? Don't you think it's stupid for both zangetsus to shoot the same getsuga seeing as the white one is quincy based?  http://imgur.com/jxQpp3m  I was talking about that.  Also just like I said, he hits the white getsuga's outline with his BIGGER SWORD, as we have seen, the hollow zangetsu shoots black getsugas, so it would only be natural for Juujisho to have black + white getsugas in it.  Both swords being able to shoot eachother's getsugas is just far-fetched and unnatural if you ask me, I think you got it wrong there. They shoot their own type of getsugas and cannot use eachother's getsugas."
bleach,3a8cnh,Andygoesrawr,7,Thu Jun 18 11:29:37 2015 UTC,"Those are clouds. The Getsuga isn't even there by that point. That's the aftermath.  I find it illogical to think that only one sword can use one type of Getsuga. He's in Shikai... that means anything that comes out of his swords (which are both Zanpakutou, not one Zanpakutou and one Quincy weapon) is powered by his own Reiryoku, not something that the Zanpakutou decides itself. To use a different Getsuga, he has to dip into a different Reiryoku pool. I don't find it reasonable for him to be able to dip into all of his Reiryoku pools at the same time while in Shikai. That's reserved for Bankai, where his Zanpakutou spirit can help him share the load.  If he ever uses a combination Black and White Getsuga, it'll be either solid grey or patterned, and it'll be in Bankai."

bleach,3a8cnh,Andygoesrawr,3,Thu Jun 18 05:01:57 2015 UTC,"Ginjou wasn't just a Fullbringer. The cross in Ichigo's context is probably more representative of the coming together of different types of powers. Ginjou was a Fullbringer and a Substitute Shinigami, two things which he considered to be opposites. Ichigo's a plethora of opposites.  Kubo uses a lot of crosses, so I think it's a bit difficult to say it fits a single thing. For instance, I could say that since the Quincy Cross is called the Mekkyaku Juuji, Getsuga Juujishou is a Quincy ability. But I really think the fact it's a cross either means nothing or represents the combination of his powers together (in this case, Quincy and Shinigami)."

bleach,3a8gjg,gummychaos,23,Thu Jun 18 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. Kubo's spent a significant portion of this arc solidifying him as a meaningful villain, not only to the ""good guys"", but to Ichigo, which is most important. The entire Everything But The Rain flashback led towards it being Yhwach's fault that Masaki died, which is something that still affects Ichigo.  Yhwach is the most powerful being in the universe right now. Aizen isn't an option because he's still going to be several times weaker than Yhwach, regardless of his power and abilities. Haschwalth and the Soul King are the only real options for alternate final bosses, Haschwalth because it's possible he gains all of Yhwach's power when he sleeps (we currently don't know if he gains his power or his powers, which makes a huge difference), and the Soul King because it's possible he will arrest control of Yhwach's soul.  But I don't see either happening, because neither of them are good enough villains for Ichigo. Ichigo has no gripe with Haschwalth, in fact some people think Haschwalth was somber when Ichigo showed up because Yhwach would have to kill him, showing some compassion towards him.  Ichigo also has no gripe with the Soul King. That might change when he finds out the Soul King created Yhwach, but I think it's been made clear that the Soul King has sided with both the Shinigami and Ichigo, meaning Yhwach is his enemy regardless of the past."

bleach,3a8gjg,omnigetsu,4,Thu Jun 18 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"I could see Aizen ripping Yhwach's almost dead soul and feeding the Hougyoku with it(Yhwach's soul , after his defeat). They're the same thing ... kinda . So it's possible for the Hougyoku to pull an Yhwach on Yhwach and absorb the former ""new"" Soul King (Yhwach) and then rewarding Aizen with over 9000 dimensional powers.  And then there's the part with him appointing a successor , that's super fishy to me."
bleach,3a8gjg,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think I agree in all fronts. I'm really looking forward to know more about Haschwalt and his current/future powers, and also about where the RG stands on all this. I refuse to believe they were taken down so easily. The other thing I'd like to know is Ywach's past. It'd make a huge difference in terms of character development if we got to know his real intentions and motives."

bleach,3a8gjg,Tynarus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:49:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really fair to state that Aizen is so much weaker than Yhwach, since we don't know the extent to which the former's powers have grown. Then again, we don't know the extent to which the latter's powers have grown either. That said, I don't see Aizen going up against Yhwach anyways, seems more setup to be the new Soul King, or just thrown back in prison - as sad as not getting to see him fight would make me. :("

That and I think Orihime is going to be a centerpiece at the end. Maybe replacement for the Soul King? She already has reality rejection powers.  In a Japanese legend/myth Orihime was the daughter of the Heavenly Emperor and was a gifted fabric weaver, making all her father's beautiful clothes. Her powers always reminded me of weaving, in that she weaves shields out of reishi(?) particles.

Maybe not villains per se but acting with a entirely different end goal in mind.

bleach,3aa6ey,aizen6,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with this, I think the biggest reason he hasn't done anything yet is he has no motivation. He doesn't have to lift a finger and he gets carried (?) everywhere, and doesn't have to deal with the Quincy plebs"

I know Mayuri is heavily protected by science plot-hax, but Aizen-taichou's knowledge plot-hax rivals that of Mayuri, and he's got ultra-powerful base abilities to boot. So I don't think Mayuri's science would have worked.  Then again, I'm probably biased because Aizen-taichou is one of my top 3 favorites."

bleach,3aa6ey,richiegraine,2,Thu Jun 18 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"This is a tough scenario to lay out because  it all boils down to one thing: Is Mayuri's tech really hampering Aizen to the effect we think it is or is Aizen just going with the flow to see how shit turns out waiting for the best time to troll everyone.  If it's the former, that means Mayuri has ""cracked the Aizen code."" We also all know what happens to people Kurotsuchi-taicho has figured out. They step up, talk shit and get curbstomped in short order.  If it's the latter, the reverse happens with the caveat that Mayuri pretty much can't be killed by conventional means thanks to Ashisogi Jizo."
bleach,3aa6ey,oetsuthebest,0,Thu Jun 18 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, could go either way really...

Really do wish the Palace HAD been shot down though... Would have made for an interesting battlefield. xD"

bleach,3aa6ey,oetsuthebest,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:53:03 2015 UTC,Well the reason he didn't before is because he wasn't as powerful because I think they even stated he was more powerful than before in the chapter he deals with the black squishy thingys.

Ichigo doesn't have hollowfication in this film.) So lets say, if the bounts were also cannon, then Memories of nobody would happen between the rescue of Rukia and The Bounts. He also doesn't have a hollow mask in fade to black, so maybe the two movies happened back to back? He uses hollowfication in The Diamond dust rebellion, so maybe that happens between the battle of Karakura town and the arrival of the Arrancar BUT AFTER he successfully learns to hollowfy.  And Hell verse takes place (presumably) after the deafeat of Sosuke Aizen, but before the invasion of the Quincies."

bleach,3a8lc0,Dotifo,3,Fri Jun 19 03:13:13 2015 UTC,"The first movie, Memories of Nobody, shows Rukia's Shikai, so it should take place after episode 117 (when it's first revealed), towards the beginning of the Arrancar Arc.  The second movie, Diamond Dust Rebellion, shows Ichigo using his hollow mask and Ishida shows off his Ginrei Kojaku so it should be after ep 144 (right after invading Hueco Mundo) when it's first revealed.  Fade to black, the 3rd one, has Hisagi using his Shikai so that would mean the movie is after ep 219 (right in the middle of the Fake Karakura Town arc).  The last one, Hell Verse, has Ichigo's full hollow form so that would put it anywhere after ep 272 (after the fight with Ulquiorra but before the final fight with Aizen).  The movies don't really fit anywhere in the anime, heck even some of the anime only arcs don't fit either."

bleach,3a3kto,The_ThirdFang,6,Wed Jun 17 00:52:34 2015 UTC,did they ever explain chad's and orihime's abilities' origins?  I never understood why they were the only ones with these unique powers...
bleach,3a3kto,maytagem,19,Wed Jun 17 03:34:02 2015 UTC,Chad is a fullbringer. His power comes from a hollow attacking his mother during her pregnancy with him.  It helps that he realizes his power is more hollow than anything else when fights that privarron espada in hueco mundo.  Orihime. She is just a human god. No explanation.
bleach,3a3kto,yukeake,12,Wed Jun 17 04:19:11 2015 UTC,Orihime is heavily implied to be one as well. She had similar circumstances. Regardless there's always the Hoguoku to fall back on. It was technically explained very early on that their powers came from it. The Chad thing was sort of a retcon but can easily be explained away as it being both.
bleach,3a3kto,Vlaid,15,Wed Jun 17 04:41:35 2015 UTC,"The Hogyoku connection is actually pretty simple.  It can only make things happen that were already possible.  Both Chad and Orihime's powers were something they could awaken on their own.  The Hogyoku simply acted to ""shortcut"" the process, and awaken their powers in response to their will (and, it's implied, Ichigo's reiatsu).  The only oddity about Orihime's powers being a Fullbring is that her faeries appear to be sentient - which is something that we don't see in any other Fullbring.  Otherwise almost everything she does fits almost perfectly, right down to the sentimental focus (her hairpins)."

bleach,3a3kto,HatoriHanzoSteel,3,Wed Jun 17 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"I just read up on it thinking that maybe she's also a Fullbringer, i mean her hairpins are basically an object affinity, but it says it was created by the Hogyoku, which created the Visored if I recall correctly because Aizen wanted them to go through Hollowification while Orihime wanted to not feel powerless.  I really don't understand the extent of the Hogyoku's power though.  It still exists within Aizen right?"
bleach,3a3kto,The_ThirdFang,2,Wed Jun 17 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, I uh.. thought her powers were explained? Rukia's gigai had the Hogyoku in it, and Chad/Orihime received their powers after coming into contact with Rukia. (Chad is a Fullbringer tho)"

bleach,3a3kto,The_ThirdFang,2,Wed Jun 17 15:06:23 2015 UTC,didn't the hogyoku reject aizen right when urahara's seal activated?... i remember him mentioning something like that.. so right now even if hogyoku is still in aizen's body it might not be a willing participent so to say... and might not care for what he wishes.. but aizen could still take power from it...
bleach,3a3kto,BaronRafiki,3,Wed Jun 17 15:15:49 2015 UTC,He said somwthing like it is the will of the hogyoku after Aizen said the seal wasn't strong enough  There is a theory that the hogyoku was trying to take control of Aizen. Later when is sealed the hogyoku thinks it will help in completely overriding Aizen but Aizen instead takes over.   The hogyoku thinking it could win let the seal happen but Aizen was the winner in the end.

Szayelaporro vs Unohana. I feel Szayelaporro could take out most of the captains that's why he got defeated like he did (deus ex machina) but maybe Unohana could do something.  Mayuri vs Barragan. Curious to see how Mayuri would've won this one.  Sajin vs Yammy. Because why not.  Kenpachi vs Zommari. Because I want to laugh.  Toshiro vs Starrk. Starrk could still be alive.  Soifon vs Nnoitra.

Well then, I'll use her against you!""  B: ""No you won't.""  Z: ""Well I'll use my powers to take over your weapon!""  B: ""Oh, you mean the one that's THOUSANDS of tiny weapons?

Unohana vs Barragon  I don't know what her Bankai does, but it just might kill him.  Harribel vs Yama  She vows to avenge her friends and gets grilled seconds later.  Szayelaporro vs Kenpachi  Fighting all those doppelgangers of himself would mean Unohana doesn't have die to unlock his powers.  Soifon vs Yammy  If her zan is nullified by his reiatsu, their fight'll be just like an person being attacked by an angry wasp.  Zonmari vs Mayuri  We'll get to see Mayuri rant about love."

Some places might get switched up though, depending on the conditions (for example, you have Shinji winning over Byakuya, but couldn't he just send his Senbonzakura flying in all directions to negate Shinji's shikai, the way Bambietta did? Then again, we don't know Shinji's bankai, so I believe either could win this battle).  The only thing I don't agree with is Rukia placing this high. Now, don't get me wrong, I like her as a character very much, but she only recently got her bankai, not to mention it's an extremely delicate one, where a single wrong move could kill her. In time, she'll certainly become one of the strongest people on this list, but I don't think she's ready to compete with those who have been training for years yet.  Edit: Oh, I forgot. I think Chojiro would at least wreck Hitsugaya, both of their bankai's could control the weather, but Chojiro has been training with his for a very, very long time. He was a closeted badass, I just know it.  And Renji would win a few fights as well, he does have the Soul palace power-up."

bleach,3a2dao,rogrogrickroll,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:46:55 2015 UTC,Yama already found a way around azien  shikai (identify the real from the fake by the retsu in the blade as thats a sense aizen doesn't control)   If it wasn't for wonder wiess aizen losses  (even with wonderwiess if yama didn't care about human lives aizen would have lost  (the fight but he would have succeeded jn being the town back  however he would still loss because yama not care about human lives wouldn't care))
bleach,3a2dao,shonryukku,13,Fri Jun 19 11:19:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't include Ichigo because he's also very different. As far as your list goes I'd like to think that Renji is stronger than Rukia. I'd put Yamamoto at number 1 since Aizen created Wonderwiess and Yhwach had to take his bankai to beat him.
bleach,3a2dao,EspadaPrimera,6,Tue Jun 16 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"Aizen VS Yamamoto is pretty sketchy to me. We never really got to see them fight because Aizen was meticulous and very careful in his planning, so that he wouldn't even NEED to fight Yamamoto. After fusing with the Hogyoku AND having Kyoka Suigetsu, I feel like he simply wanted to save his strength for the Royal Guard, instead of having a long drawn-out fight with the Captain Commander."
bleach,3a2dao,Tynarus,2,Tue Jun 16 19:11:30 2015 UTC,That's a really good point and Aizen is Aizen. Regardless of who won though I'd imagine it still would've been a very close fight.
bleach,3a2dao,EspadaPrimera,0,Tue Jun 16 21:06:35 2015 UTC,He could just rest before fighting the royal guard. Pretty sure he did all that vs yama bc he can't beat him. He even admitted it
bleach,3a2dao,rogrogrickroll,2,Tue Jun 16 22:24:54 2015 UTC,who says they wouldn't come down to knockout a tired aizen?
bleach,3a2dao,eightNote,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:42:09 2015 UTC,Do you seriously think fighting Yama would matter if the zero squad came right after his FKT fights?
bleach,3a2dao,rogrogrickroll,11,Wed Jun 17 13:56:05 2015 UTC,Her bankai being extremely risky is the reason why I don't see her being up so high. It feels like a dangerous coin toss. She would win fights but one wrong move and she could end up killing herself.
bleach,3a2dao,EspadaPrimera,11,Tue Jun 16 18:50:12 2015 UTC,You really understimate isshin man ... He cant lose to gin yoroichi byakuya or shinji man . He fought on par with aizen with only shikai
bleach,3a2dao,oetsuthebest,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:10:44 2015 UTC,So much this.
bleach,3a2dao,MTBDEM,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"Isshin got in a few good attacks on Aizen, but Gin ""killed"" Aizen. So I understand the reasoning there.  Yoruichi I'd have to agree is probably stronger than Isshin. Both are from noble families but Yoruichi just seems to have more tricks up her sleeve.  Shinji probably doesn't have his level of skill or strength, but his shikai is kinda hax so he is ranked high.  Byakuya is also a noble, and it seems he maxed out his power by going to the Royal Realm. Seems kinda like a toss up to me."
bleach,3a2dao,whatacrappyusername,2,Thu Jun 18 11:42:18 2015 UTC,"Gin only killed him by betrayal man , not in battle . In fact the second aizen got up , he died (the feels ...)youroichi is strong , but i dont think she could do what isshin did . I guess it takes one clean hit of his sword to finish the fight (look at what he did to aizen's coocon).against byakuya , even with his royal training , i still think he could beat him . Against shinji would be done if you finish the fight without breathing or if u shot a lucky getsuga"
bleach,3a2dao,oetsuthebest,4,Thu Jun 18 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"My heart is telling me kisuke is easily top 3, but my mind is telling me his feats don't put him there yet so I reluctantly agree with you. Until that is you put him in 11th, behind shinji?! I gotta think he's higher up than that. And as others have said there's no way renji loses every match."

bleach,3a2dao,MrTyeFox,4,Wed Jun 17 19:12:46 2015 UTC,Gotta think Urahara would be in the top 3. He seems like one most likely to have a Batman-like plan to take down all the other members.
bleach,3a2dao,thearmadillo,4,Thu Jun 18 04:33:11 2015 UTC,"Not top 3, but def farther up, I think he could take byakuya pretty handily"
bleach,3a2dao,kylexf,3,Tue Jun 16 22:42:31 2015 UTC,"My general opinions on tournaments in bleach is that there's a tiny bit too much rock-paper-scissor going around. There are some shiningami that I couldn't imagine winning against other. For example, how would Kenpachi beat Shinji? Spin in place? But then again, Shinji might have pretty hard time against any sort of AoE, like the senbonzakura."
bleach,3a2dao,Zil_v_a,4,Tue Jun 16 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"Kenpachi beat Tousen, though, and his Bankai also affected the senses. Reversed senses can't be that much stronger than no senses, so he might come up with something. I think he'd actually do better than any other physical attack fighter because his fighting is almost entirely instinct rather than training. A trained fighter would have to overcome all his training, but Kenpachi just cuts in a different direction."
bleach,3a2dao,fearsomeduckins,5,Tue Jun 16 23:28:11 2015 UTC,"There's also an opinion I repeat everyone brings up Kenpachi vs Tousen: it's a plot hole.   Tousen got to hit Kenpachi with no end for good few minutes, would he cut his neck or stab his heart, he would have easily won. Instead he aimed at shoulders and all other non-vital random parts of the body. If we explain it with blindness then I wanna know how is he cooking and how did he pass the shiningami academy."
bleach,3a2dao,Zil_v_a,5,Wed Jun 17 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"But doesn't he say that Kenpachi keeps dodging just enough to avoid taking fatal damage? He's trying his hardest to kill him, he just simply can't. Kenpachi is fast enough to dodge when he feels the blade touch him. It's either a plot hole, or Kenpachi is actually just that strong. And because it is Kenpachi, I'm kind of inclined to go with the latter. Either way, it's definitely canon so it would still count as a feat."
bleach,3a2dao,fearsomeduckins,2,Wed Jun 17 09:49:36 2015 UTC,"But he felt nothing. This means that he couldn't ""dodge"", what he was doing was ""moving at random"" to not make himself an easy target. All in all the plot explanation for that fight is actually ""Tousen sucks"". Or at least that's how it ended up."
bleach,3a2dao,Zil_v_a,3,Wed Jun 17 10:11:08 2015 UTC,"Actually it didn't remove his sense of touch. Only sight, hearing, smell, and reiatsu. It's issue 146/147 if you want to check it out. This is the page where he's dodging."
bleach,3a2dao,fearsomeduckins,3,Wed Jun 17 10:31:30 2015 UTC,"Woah, so it really suggest that Kenpachi is super ultra fast. Maybe even the fastest shiningami. Pretty interesting."
bleach,3a2dao,Zil_v_a,2,Wed Jun 17 11:10:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it's more instinct, considering his combat experience. He's absolutely oblivious to Shunpo, but seeing as he actually likes getting cut, he would know the sensation enough to be able to sense it. Kinda like ""smelling danger."""
bleach,3a2dao,aizen6,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:15:00 2015 UTC,He described it as reacting to the moment he feels the blade. It's way less than a second before actually getting cut. The more I think about this fight the more inconsistent with the rest of the manga it becomes.
bleach,3a2dao,Zil_v_a,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:51:23 2015 UTC,"Like you, I too believe that Tousen could have finished that fight with that first blow, the moment Kenpachi lost all his senses. He could have gone for the neck or the heart, but he didn't. Once Kenpachi adjusted to the Bankai, I think he would have been used the initial ""superficial"" blows that Tousen landed to be able react to another approaching strike. I guess that momentary ruffle of his clothes as the sword neared him, or something.  In my opinion, Tousen's was one of the better Bankais in the series. But like all other unique/interesting techniques, his was revealed with all the pros and cons, so that an opponent could figure out how to overcome it. I guess I'm used to good powers not winning any more."
bleach,3a2dao,aizen6,2,Wed Jun 17 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"if he was trying his hardest he would have just kido'd kenpachi to death, and he wouldnt even feel it - the only reason that kenpachi could react to the sword was because when the sword touches you, your sense come back. if he wasnt getting stabbed, he'd simply never know what was happening to him"
bleach,3a2dao,shittyatmath,2,Wed Jun 17 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"No, he always had his sense of touch. I linked it somewhere around here, but it's in issue 147, if you wanna look. So he would feel kido too. But this is Kenpachi we're talking about; his durability is absurd. He'd probably just blow the kido away with reiatsu, and you know it. Then he'd grunt about how boring it all is and try to cut something."
bleach,3a2dao,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"ah, you're right  he'd feel the kido but he wouldnt be able to catch tosen, ever. the only reason kenpachi caught tosen is because he felt the slashes from the sword and eventually tanked it, which let him see.  also, op said no plot armor - beineg able to blow kido away would we plot armor, we've never seen anybody blow kido away with reiatsu (even aizen)"
bleach,3a2dao,shittyatmath,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe. He'd tank an awful lot though, I'm not sure Tousen every shows kido strong enough to take down kenpachi. And eventually he's going to hit the limit with his bankai, so he has to kill kenpachi before that. But generally speaking reiatsu seems to trump everything, like in this panel. Although that's not really Aizen, so maybe he can't really do that, but I assume the underlying principle is sound."
bleach,3a2dao,fearsomeduckins,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"Tousen I think is one of the few characters that regressed as time went on. He was probably the most badass when he was in the TBTP arc- he was the one who took out the Vizards. He was really merciless, he used his bankai and went straight for their weak-spots.   After that he might have become more skilled, but I think he also became complacent. He thought he was impossible to beat so he toyed with Kenpachi, and then we was beat by him.  His defeat messed with his head I think. He thought he needed more strength like Kenpachi which is one of the reasons why  he choose to throw away one of the most hax abilities in the series to become a strong bug-thing."
bleach,3a2dao,whatacrappyusername,3,Thu Jun 18 04:44:33 2015 UTC,Renji is definitely not last place I'd say he's stronger than half the people on that list with Sōō Zabimaru. Byakuya could be higher too and Shinji is a wild card. I think that Ikkaku should be last considering he barely beat Edorad with his Bankai and didn't a stand a chance against Poww. Granted that was pre time skip but he's done nothing but get waxed this arc. I also think that Soi Fon should be last considering she couldn't beat a Sternritter with her best technique
bleach,3a2dao,SpiritualLemon,5,Thu Jun 18 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"Before I say anything I have to ask, what power level did you put Renji?  With his old Bankai or his True Bankai?"
bleach,3a2dao,redditrandomacc,8,Wed Jun 17 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. After his True Bankai, Renji would at least be stronger than the Visoreds. He took out Mask easily."
bleach,3a2dao,JakabBigShow64,2,Tue Jun 16 19:15:54 2015 UTC,I'm still convinced that he and Rukia had a temporary powerup from the zero division food and the SP's dense energy.  It's a bit too over the top to throw away experience and level due to a few days in the SP. Otherwise it'd be downright irresponsible to not send each captain at least once.
bleach,3a2dao,HiHoJufro,5,Tue Jun 16 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"But learning a the true name of your bankai is not a temporary power up. The only reason Ichibei told Renji the true name is because he felt Renji had finally earned the right. And don't forget that Renji's bankai was initially damaged by Byakuya, on its first ever use in battle. The true name plus Royal training should more than make up for that initial power loss. And dont forget the Visored's have been out of practice for years now."
bleach,3a2dao,JakabBigShow64,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"I would have to say Aizen, KS for the win. Followed by Yamamoto and then ""The Undead"" aka Zaraki.

Not only is he basically immortal, but we don't even know what his Bankai is. Everything we have seen him do has been done without it."
bleach,3a2dao,MrSterlock,-1,Thu Jun 18 14:05:54 2015 UTC,"Looks more like a list of who's your favorite Shinigami.  You have Renji losing EVERY SINGLE BATTLE, even though he has the 0 squad power-up and handily took care of many Quincy that owned all other Captains and lieutenants.  You also have Aizen winning all even though he is not on the same level he was last time we saw him fighting.  Yes he is strong but we really don't know HOW strong, it looked as if he was going to fall to ""U"" the underbelly without much of a fight."
bleach,3a2dao,jdonnel,5,Thu Jun 18 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"Fall to ""U"" without much of a fight? He's restrained to a chair with his reiatsu forced directly around him AND limited. ""U"" only managed to immobilize him for 5 minutes and had no chance of killing him anyways, being that he's immortal and all. Without the restrictions his reiatsu would have likely just blown away ""U""s entire ability and he'd have curbstomped him along with the rest of the sternritter (excluding possibly Yhwach)."
bleach,3a2dao,Tynarus,-5,Tue Jun 16 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"Once again you are making assumptions.  He immobilized Aizen until he was killed.  We assume he has actually reached immortally.  Everyone is immortal, until they die.  I understand everybody LOVES Aizen, he's perfect in every way, yada yada yada.  The fact that they can feel his reiastu again shows that he's not as strong as he was when he fought Ichigo w/mugestu.  He is strong don't get me wrong, but the U's power is based on sealing reiastu so someone with TONS of it would be most affective.  Also this is a ""no plot armor"" hypothetical, so Aizen being popular doesn't make him infallible."
bleach,3a2dao,jdonnel,4,Tue Jun 16 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"Only assumption I made was that Aizen's reiatsu would have blown away ""U""s ability if he weren't restrained. The rest is from dialog taken directly from the manga, so... For one, assuming ""U"" is dead is an assumption in itself. Aizen was still immobilized after ""U"" was 'defeated', and a Sternritter's powers don't just disappear after they die anyways. You shouldn't assume someone is buffing a character just because he's popular, because I'm only stating facts given by the manga itself."
bleach,3a2dao,Tynarus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Yes he is dead because we see Bazz-B shoot him, through the heart, same as we saw Kira blown in half.  People hold onto hope because of plot armor, it's the only reason Grimmy is back is because of popularity.  Yes he claims to be immortal, you probably are thinking about the conversation between Sunsui and Aizen where he says, if it were that easy to kill you we would've.  That doesn't mean he's actually immortal, it means he's too strong for them to kill.  I'm sorry if I offended you with the assumption you are a Aizen fanboy but it gets tiring reading the circle jerk that is Aizen here.  Quincey powers do go away after they die look at all the imaginary things that Gemmey made that disappeared after he died.  Assumptions are made on all sides because nothing is set in stone."
bleach,3a2dao,jdonnel,3,Tue Jun 16 19:42:56 2015 UTC,I'm sure it's stated explicitly somewhere that Aizen is immortal. His sentencing perhaps? Can't remember off the top of my head

Uryu vs. Ichigo because of Nakama reasons  Askin is currently fighting Grimmjow, but I think Mayuri will intervene. Or at least Urahara. They need someone with brains to take Ms. Aizen down.  That leaves the aiming guy, whom we're all hoping Shinji can fuck up.  I guess even Tousen would have been a good match for him.  I want Jugram to go against Shunsui, sort of like revenge for Yama-jii and because he's the head of the Gotei while Jugo sort of leads the Wandenreich.  But then, it could go either way.

Lille Barro (X-Axis) I'm sure the Vizords will get him. The way they all move from one direction to another is enough to throw him off, and I'm sure Hachi could create some reverse-like barriers under the ability of Shinji's Sakanade.

bleach,3a0gqd,puppycatlaserbeam,7,Tue Jun 16 06:56:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Well, that pride vs results motif is quite recurring in Bleach (or if you prefer, does the end justify the means?). It also holds huge importance in Japanese culture and history. During the Boshin War western weapons and tactics made their appearance and they made a stark contrast -since killing someone from afar and sometimes even unseen wasn't considered honorable- with the ways of the warriors or samurai (Bushido).   I've made a few posts about that on this sub where I talked about Aizen, Yamamoto, and others from this perspective and it sure is interesting. Kubo loves contrasts. Life and death, arrogance and humility, the already mentioned pride and pragmatism. And I think the last one is going to be central to the plot, as it already has. In SS you see how Yamamoto refused to listen to good reasons because of his pride, which once again contrasts with Kyoraku. In fact, it contributes to Kyoraku's character development. Pride is considered a good thing from the Japanese culture's point of view, and Kyoraku's pragmatism, I believe, foreshadows harsh decisions, surprises and (hopefully) a really dark Bankai. :)"

Even looking at the series as a whole, a whole lot of the 'you'll never defeat me, Ichigo!' attitudes were wrapped up with ideas of 'I'm a captain/the Nth espada, and you're just some invader/human'. Which makes sense for a few battles where that's all they know about Ichigo, but some were quite stubbornly attached to this line of thinking, like some of the captains after Ichigo slowly battled his way up the ranks in the SS arc.   I hadn't thought about it being a clue for Kyoraku's bankai though! That would be so cool to see, I hope you're right."

I'd fucking love them to go another round, as Kenpachi know's he shouldn't tip-toe his way around this time.   Aizen vs. Old man Yama, Aizen was scared and we found out why. Would like to see if he could still hold his own without Wonderweiss.(You know, before he became the sitting God and could probably suppress Yama's flames with his reiatsu alone)  Nel vs. Grimmjow. Both on the same-side now so probably won't happen but would be curious who would actually come out on top.

Taking all of the character's anxieties, fears and desires and having them playout in an obtuse matter, characters referring to seemingly unrelated matters on a surface level while still capturing the character's fear and anxiety, switching topics with no decent segway while still embodying the emotions. The whole sequence itself is not necessarly depedent on the rules of time and space. A good dream sequence is a difficult thing to do right. Joss Whedon in Buffy did some great dream sequences. Its a means of showing the characters state of mind without the heavy handed obvious metaphors or simply expressing things explicitly."

So who's to say that the old Quincy aren't still alive and connected to their old powers?  It would be sweet if Ichigo couldn't overpower Bach, but before he's defeated Ryuken brings the living impure Quincy and they manage to reclaim some of their power from Bach to let Ichigo win.

Aizen survives the selection, frees himself, and becomes Soul King.  All according to plan.  Aizen has Ichigo branded as the worst criminal in the history of the Soul Society.  Ichigo is banished/imprisoned for all time.  Ichigo doesn't object as he is in fact responsible for the deaths of his loved ones.  The End"
bleach,39zyqc,Vendetta1990,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:52:21 2015 UTC,Probably Yhwach sees a future he wasn't expecting and I suppose you could figure out the rest.

I will add that the fact that he has elite levels of all 3 main power forms in the bleach world, this concoction will probably make something new and transcendent like during FGT, but more mature."
bleach,39z5tb,ohman177,6,Mon Jun 15 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"He did have real Fullbring powers even though it was taken away from him very quickly. His power left with little of his Shinigami powers was to be shared among everyone else since he is so powerful. Since they were taken from him, no, he doesn't have them anymore. And you do have a point there: guess Kubo likes change in his Bleach?"
bleach,39z5tb,Temperatia,3,Tue Jun 16 00:10:36 2015 UTC,"Since they were taken from him, no, he doesn't have them anymore. And you do have a point there: guess Kubo likes change in his Bleach?   When Ichigo was trapped in Opie's cage, he created Bringer Light.   So, he does still have access to Fullbring. At least, the part of it that he retained because it was fused with his Shinigami powers."
bleach,39z5tb,Temperatia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"I thought Ginjo harvested all his powers, Shinigami and Fullbring to its full quantity."
bleach,39z5tb,ABashfulTurnip,5,Tue Jun 16 00:45:40 2015 UTC,"No, right after Ichigo got his powers back Rukia explained that Ginjou only took the portion of his Shinigami powers that had fused with his Fullbring.  It was stated in an interview that Ichigo's new appearance was because some of his Fullbring had also fused with his Shinigami powers."
bleach,39z5tb,Temperatia,2,Tue Jun 16 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe what could have happened was that Ichigo's fullbring and shinigame powers fused and took on the characteristics of each other, so when Ginjo essentially seperated his fullbring from his shinigame powers and absorbs the former, he got some shinigame aspects too. But of course the fullbring powers left behind an influence on Ichigo's shinigam powers since they were fused, changing his uniform and leaving him with abilities like Bringer Light."

bleach,39z5tb,Edge_Walkr,2,Tue Jun 16 01:03:54 2015 UTC,"Ginjo only absorbed his Fullbring because like when Byakuya tried to destroy his soul reaper powers they didn't target his true power, in Byakuya's case he targeted rukia's powers and in Ginjo's case he only targeted the Fullbring expecting Ichigo to not have any shinigami powers left.  As for why he may have his fullbring powers back, it could be like when he transferred rukia's power to himself, so when Ginjo died it went back to Ichigo."
bleach,39z5tb,BatmanMcladswag,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:01:12 2015 UTC,What a confusing way to absorb and then dis-absorb a portion of powers.
bleach,39z5tb,Scavenger144,3,Tue Jun 16 01:04:34 2015 UTC,"He really had his own Fullbring powers. His mother had a Hollow inside her. So, he was born with the ability to use Fullbring as a result.  Yes, he still has Fullbring. Ginjou stole part of it in the Lost Agent arc, but the rest of his powers remain insides him. At first, they were what caused his Bankai to have its new appearance with the new jacket and serrated sword. It seems that his Fullbring was deactivated when he gained his new Zanpakuto from Ouetsu. So, his Fullbring isn't currently in use."

bleach,39ucj0,firagaga,4,Mon Jun 15 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"Chad has a sizable fanbase because he's actually pretty strong.   Kubo will job him any chance he gets, but Chad isn't weak. Chad got to the level of a 3rd seat just by activating his powers, then he was VC level after his powers evolved to their second stage. If he completed his Fullbring, that would probably automatically put him at Captain level like Tsukishima and Ginjou.   Humans (Quincy and Fullbringers) gain power quickly. Xcution was half-baked, but that's Ginjou's fault for being a crappy leader. We can see the Stern Ritter here matching and overwhelming the Captains even without all of them using Vollstaendig."
bleach,39ucj0,Temperatia,3,Mon Jun 15 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"I always comforted myself with the thought that Kubo-sensei wanted to create Chad as a poster on Ichigo's bedroom wall, but then he thought Chad would get too much panel time, so he made him a character instead."

bleach,39ucj0,aizen6,4,Mon Jun 15 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"The topic of Chad was brought many a time. He's a good character but in the wrong manga, essentially. He has no pre-dating plot in a story build around retroactive storytelling, plays a role of the supportive character to fill the blanks behind Ichigo's motivations and character, but actually receives too much panel time, as well as too little. Essentially to be good he would have to do at least as much as Orihime, or as little as Tatsuki, who has the exact same function to Orihime that Chad has to Ichigo."

bleach,39us9f,assertiveguy,3,Mon Jun 15 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"Rukia actually does have blue hair, it's just really dark under natural lighting. The art style Kubo used for that spread used shading and highlights sparingly, so he had to combine the highlights, shadows, and midtones into a single colour, producing a purply blue. I think it's actually really cool because it shows different base hues for each of the black-haired characters.  It's easy enough to tell which ones would usually be drawn with black hair and the coloured highlight they're drawn with, since in the manga itself their hair is fully black."

bleach,39qo20,ecass305,3,Sun Jun 14 23:08:31 2015 UTC,It's a possibility considering Oetsu was said to have been promoted. Ichibe was most likely always a Royal Guard though. We desperately need a flashback arc.

bleach,39t7nc,ShiaLaBuff,-6,Tue Jun 16 08:20:19 2015 UTC,Edit:  I was wrong here.  But... still.  It is not over yet.  I disagree.  Mimihage was called the right hand.  Not the right arm. http://www.mangapanda.com/bleach/616/12  We never saw whether or not the Soul King had a right hand.  It is very hard to tell.  I should have put this in my original post since I knew this criticism would come.
bleach,39t7nc,Andygoesrawr,10,Sun Jun 14 15:32:19 2015 UTC,Yeah that was a mistranslation. Mimihagi is the right arm of the Soul King.

Regardless, the fact is that him giving Ichigo his limbs remains a possibility because Kubo clearly made that distinction.  Why is it not just as likely, in your mind, that Kubo forgot to take out the right arm that was shown from Mimihage?  OR... Mimihage was metaphorically his ""right arm,"" like the term is used when referring to a king's helper.  Mimihage could have been a seperate entity entirely."
bleach,39t7nc,Andygoesrawr,4,Sun Jun 14 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/zB1DX86.png  It says migiude (右腕), which means ""right arm"". Right hand is migite (右手).  Kubo made it pretty clear that Mimihagi was literally the Soul King's arm. He shed his limbs for whatever reason, and Mimihagi fell from the sky and was revered as a god."
bleach,39t7nc,Andygoesrawr,-10,Sun Jun 14 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"So, regardless... what you are saying is that Kubo must have made an error.  If you are correct here, then the Soul King should have been shown without an arm.    So, my question to you is:  Why is it more likely that Kubo simply forgot to draw him without his right arm than for him to forget to draw him without any limbs in the first place?  Or your allegory reason?  It seems like you are cherry picking in favor of negating my theory.  It seems like either way what I am saying is just as likely."
bleach,39t7nc,RustIedJimmyz,10,Sun Jun 14 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure what you're trying to say. I am saying that Kubo forgot to draw him without any limbs. The fact that he was later shown without any limbs, along with us being told that he lost his right arm at least 300 years ago shows that it's a fact that the Soul King was not meant to have a right arm in that panel, and since all his limbs were later missing it's also suggested that he wasn't meant to be drawn with any limbs at all. That means it was either an error on Kubo's part (highly likely considering he keeps accidentally forgetting to draw Shunsui's eyepatch), was retconned, or was done for artistic purposes (i.e. phantom limb metaphor, showing that he's still connected to his disembodied limbs).  My point is that Kubo's already nullified your ""evidence"". If your theory is instead that the Soul King gave his left arm and two legs to Ichigo then there's some possibility there, though unlikely considering that would mean Ichigo would currently be overflowing with power like Yhwach is. But considering the Soul King's right arm is currently inside Yhwach, it's obviously not inside Ichigo."
bleach,39t7nc,eightNote,-3,Sun Jun 14 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute... my point was NEVER that the right arm was inside Ichigo, only that the other limbs were."
bleach,39t7nc,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,9,Sun Jun 14 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"That's not what you said. But anyway, that's fine. That just means it's a crack theory that nobody can prove or disprove.  The only thing I'm disputing is what you're calling ""evidence"". For some reason it's taken me four comments to explain the fact that we have proof that the Soul King being drawn with all four limbs was either a mistake, retconned, or metaphorical. It's fine to say ""but maybe he only accidentally drew the right arm, and he actually had all his other limbs then and for some reason only discarded his right arm over 300 years ago and decided to keep the rest until Ichigo came along to hide them inside him"", but that's not proof.  I do think the other three limbs will play an important part in defeating Yhwach and creating the new Soul King, and the limbs currently being inside Ichigo is a valid theory, I just think it's one of the weaker crack theories."
bleach,39t7nc,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,-5,Sun Jun 14 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"Well of course after having this conversation my original post would read very differently if I edited it all.  Calling this is crack theory is just dick and disingenuous.  You know that if the soul king can give out his limbs then Ichigo would be a likely recipient.  A crack theory is something ridiculous.  This actually seems quite likely.  More likely, in fact... than the majority of theories posted on here.    I will edit my original post."
bleach,39t7nc,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,3,Sun Jun 14 16:21:11 2015 UTC,God you're delusional. Your theory's retarded.
bleach,39t7nc,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,-4,Sun Jun 14 15:58:02 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Lets get this straight.  The Soul King was drawn with limbs.  The soul king was said to have gotten rid of his right arm, producing mimihage.  Mimihage went inside Ukitake.  The other 3 limbs, were not explained...  please tell me where you think those limbs are.  I'm not delusional, this is entirely within the scope of possibilities considering that Ichigo is going to need to fight Ywach."

bleach,39t7nc,angryspacemahreen,3,Sun Jun 14 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you meant to post a different link for the first one :P and Mimihagi is the right arm of the Soul King, which was inside Ukitake since he was a kid. It could just be an accident on Kubo's part. It wouldn't make sense that the whole body is there when we know that he would have atleast not had his right arm."
bleach,39t7nc,angryspacemahreen,-5,Sun Jun 14 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I fixed that.  And, I feel like I am going to have to keep repeating this... but that doesn't negate my theory.  It just seems like an error. It still brings to question the fact that he only said that Mimihage had given out his RIGHT ARM.  Where were all of his other limbs in the end?  They had to have gone somewhere."

We don't even know what their Zanpakutou do (or even the names except for Isane) And Iba isn't even in the Gotei 13 party. Why keep secrets from lieutenants up to this point? Unless it's something really awesome, I don't see a reason for this. Sasakibe: fucking vice-captain of Squad 1. He does nothing the whole series just to get killed by an annoying Sternritter who was then reduced to nothing by Yamamoto. His Shikai remains unexplained. His Bankai was shown by another character. That sucks so much. Chad: at least he's all for IchiHime. Orihime: speaking of her... Candice: she acted like the leader of the Femritters. Then she gets offscreened while the other three survive and gets called useless by Liltotto. Great job, Candy. Still a better Femritter than Berenice. Nianzol: Wow he's the guy who stops Yhwach from being attacked. It must be impossible to beat him, nothing can... oh he's already dead... nvm NaNaNa: Ugh. The most anticlimatic of all Bleach characters. First he confronts Rose and nothing happens. He stalks Renji and nothing happens. He is in the gang that attacks Ichigo, then he's offscreened by Byakuya. Then he's hit by Auswählen. We still didn't know what his Schrift was, when even YHWACH'S had been revealed. Then he comes back in one of the most hyped moments of the arc: Aizen's return... just to die by a Burner Finger 1. Worst character arc of the entire series in my opinion..."

It's always bugged me that Kensei was a captain, deadly Bankai, and he gets constantly stomped on. In the battle vs Aizen, he's off-screened by Wonderweiss. Then becomes captain again, and in the current arc, doesn't even use his transformation when fighting Mask De Masculine. Which leads to my next point, why do the Vizards not transform at all during the Quincey fights? Only Mashiro transforms at all and it was to train Hisagi. The transformation is deemed so important vs Aizen, yet now it's meaningless? There's probably more to why they don't, but it's a nit picky thing from me."

bleach,39i4dz,mindseye84,11,Thu Jun 11 21:40:04 2015 UTC,What do you mean when you say royal qualities?  It's only speculation but the fact that his sword is a cane could mean that he was tied to the Zero Division at one point. All of their Zanpakutou are unique when compared to normal ones.
bleach,39i4dz,Alluka-,6,Thu Jun 11 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"My only issue with this is that his sword wasn't a cane in the TBTP arc but now it is which hints at him just wanting to hide his zan from people, not that it was Zero Squad special. Though I'm not sure if they could just change them back to the normal shape whenever they wanted."
bleach,39i4dz,richiegraine,5,Fri Jun 12 04:35:26 2015 UTC,I don't think he would've gotten in contact with the Zero Division after his exile. The most logical explanation would be that he knew how to reforge blades before he was exiled. This would allow him to create his new blade in the human world and it would flow together perfectly with the rest of the story.
bleach,39i4dz,Alluka-,2,Fri Jun 12 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"But why even make a new sword if his current one was fine? And if he could just make new ones why not make a new one for Ichigo when he needed it? I mean it's possible he met with the zero squad before and didn't immediately start remaking their stuff until afterwards. He made the underground hot springs before his exile, probably when he and Catwoman made the cave together."
bleach,39i4dz,richiegraine,6,Fri Jun 12 06:07:53 2015 UTC,"i believe he meant because of the name. I wached enough anime (well, hiyori helped) to know that ""hime"" stands for princess and as far as i can tell none other had that (?).  It's a quite interesting question and Urahara does seem to know quite alot about the RG"
bleach,39i4dz,Fred_MK,5,Thu Jun 11 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"Well the name Benihime means Crimson Princess. She is a female Zanpakutou spirit and the attacks are crimson in color. I'm not sure if the name has any special significance though.  Shunsui is also the only other male who has a female Zanpakutou spirit, Katen Kyoukotsu."
bleach,39i4dz,Alluka-,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:11:15 2015 UTC,Crimson Princess could be a male too...  No? ...okay...

bleach,39i4dz,EspadaPrimera,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:04:50 2015 UTC,Two young boys in the Zanpakutou arc. I don't think it was ever mentioned anywhere else yet.
bleach,39i4dz,Alluka-,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:22:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought they were female."
bleach,39i4dz,EspadaPrimera,3,Fri Jun 12 04:39:43 2015 UTC,"Sogyo no Kotowari is Ukitake's zanpakutou. They are two twin boys.  What you were thinking of is Shunsui's Katen Kyokotsu. They appear as two females, one Ninja girl and a mature woman who dressed like an oiran (high-class courtisan)."
bleach,39i4dz,29thspirit,0,Fri Jun 12 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"Well, all swords so far have a name and that name is connected to the zanpakutou. This goes as far as in the case of Yumichika, for example, the Spirit inside acting ""rebellious"" and refusing to work entirely. Renji even had a fake bankai name. Zangetsu is related to the moon and now we learn Yuha Bach powers suffer interference from the moon? Names were normally not just for show in bleach's case. With this, assuming the spirit that goes by princess may be a wild guess (indiferent of it's gender) but the fact the direct name is royalty may imply some things."
bleach,39i4dz,Fred_MK,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:24:44 2015 UTC,You're right. Names are the source of power in Bleach after all. It's definitely more probable than not that Benihime is a huge hint for Kisuke's character.

bleach,39i4dz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Fri Jun 12 07:19:56 2015 UTC,Just that Benihime means crimson princess and his shikai looks kind of royal. Could just be me getting carried away though.
bleach,39i4dz,WhereIsMyMime,0,Thu Jun 11 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"Well Shinigami can modify their Zanpakuto through years of meditation and all that bullshit. Everyone's base sword at the captain level has a unique look. Even that pussy healer guy has a unique sword.  And not to mention Urahara is a super genius, and his cane also functions as a thing to knock your soul out of your body. He probably engineered that shit himself."
bleach,39i4dz,Alluka-,3,Fri Jun 12 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"The only differences between their Zanpakutou are cosmetic. All of the blades between the Captains and Lieutenants are identical. No one but Oetsu can forge the blade of a Zanpakutou to make it look unique.   For example, the sealed states of the Royal Guard's Zanapkutou:   Ichibe: Brush - Responsible for naming everything in Soul Society Senjumaru: Needle - Creator of the Shihakusho and Oken Clothing Oetsu: Sheath Cover - Creator of the Zanpakutou Hikifune: Spatula - Controlling food means to control life Tenjiro: Paddle - Creator of the healing springs   For comparison:   Kisuke: Cane - ???   The two possible answers for Benihime's unique look are:   Oetsu made it for him Oetsu taught him how   Either way it proves that he had ties to the Zero Division even though it isn't actually confirmed yet. This and the fact that he has similar healing springs to Tenjiro."
bleach,39i4dz,Zil_v_a,3,Fri Jun 12 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"The shape of a typical zanpaktou showcases the spiritual power of the blade. The smaller the blade, the less reiatsu it holds. However, it was noted that captains can intentionally lower their size. Otherwise they all would have buildings-tall blades.  I say he knows the Royal Guard. He was around before Hikifune was sent to zero division which could give him at least one potential contact. More than that however, he did make a copy of the healing springs and managed to create his crazy way of getting bankai. It's easy to assume that he might have just learned from them how those things work before he started experimenting on his own. This knowledge might also be a reason why did he start his research facility to being with.  I will not be surprised if he turns out to come from one of the not revealed royal families. He knows what is the soul king, yet he did not see it during turn back the pendulum (as an inauguration or something)."
bleach,39i4dz,Zil_v_a,3,Fri Jun 12 00:29:42 2015 UTC,"It would not be below Urahara to modify his zanpakuto. It is also said that he has seen the soul king so he might know the royal guard and have learned a lot from them. He did manage to make a (supposedly inferior) copy of the healing springs.  While it is certain that he wasn't a part of the royal guard, given the back to the pendulum arc it is possible that he was or is a part of a royal or ex-royal bloodline. After all he served under Yourichi in Onmitsukidō at a higher position. It also explains a lot about his high level of skill, given that royal family heirs have higher natural amounts of reiatsu. There are still royal families that have not been presented, so he might belong to an unknown one that will be reveled sometime this arc."

bleach,39ew3d,kingofdabz,37,Thu Jun 11 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually worried about Grimmjow at this point. I mean he is being reckless. Askin is an Imperial Guard. He has a Reiryoku that is comparable to or greater than a captain-level Shinigami, and let's be honest here, Grimmjow can't kill Askin by himself. Deathdealing Askin's epithet, meaning he can perfectly calculate the ""absolute lethal dose"" of any substance he consumes - the amount that will cause death without fail - and raise or lower that value as he sees fit. By just consuming blood, he can increase the lethal dosage of the blood in his opponent's body, thus making it fatal to them. Remember, he determined Nimaiya's weight and how much blood his body contained by just simple observation. Oetsu was lucky at that time that Kirinji uses his hot spring water to replace all of the blood in Oetsu's body after his blood has been made lethal by Askin."

bleach,39ew3d,Vlaid,17,Thu Jun 11 08:27:59 2015 UTC,It's pretty safe to assume they would. Their Schrifts are just specialised versions of their basic Quincy abilities.  Nobody else has used Sklaverei so I think it's safe to assume it was part of The Jail. Slavery and jailing go hand-in-hand.

bleach,39hm31,jextacy,4,Thu Jun 11 19:43:59 2015 UTC,absolute power makes you a complete soulless vegetable..... making everything nothing more than a dream that plays itself out
bleach,39hm31,ajjuha,2,Thu Jun 11 20:01:04 2015 UTC,id think so too. and i think that this would include the bestowment of the oken to the royal guard. i dont think its a decision per se.
bleach,39hm31,oetsuthebest,4,Thu Jun 11 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"it would be more fucked up that poetic man ... plus , i think aizen knows all he needs about the soul king (he called him it too) , and i don't think he would want that"
bleach,39hm31,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Thu Jun 11 20:14:21 2015 UTC,but he wanted to kill the soul king and take his place. then again he probably wanted to pull a ywach and just make his own world where there was no ferrying about of souls going on. ywach in effect is the soul king now and i think he retains his consciousness because he isnt handling those tasks so id think that everything but wahrwelt is crumbling away at this point.
bleach,39hm31,mlc885,4,Thu Jun 11 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"I think Aizen is more of a "" I'm really smart and have tremendous power. Since I have the power, I have the responsibility to make the world better than it is. "" Instead of just being "" I am strong and I want to kill the biggest, baddest dude out there so I can be the strongest being."" Ichigo explained how he felt what Aizen was feeling, saying he just didn't want to be lonely anymore. It's kind of like Starrk, where he didn't want to be so strong if he were to be alone. Aizen was born a child prodigy, like Hitsugaya, and he is a smart man. I think he just wants his life to be meaningful. He saw the Soul King for what it truely is, and I think Kubo will go with that path of making Aizen the Soul King instead of Ichigo. Aizen's plan can still be in effect. He intended to lose to Ichigo, I'm sure. He knew about Juha, and his real opportunity of getting into the Soul Palace is now."
bleach,39hm31,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Fri Jun 12 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"""like Hitsugaya"" is stretching it until we see Hitsugaya attain Yamamoto-like power.  Aizen (and probably Gin) are the most ridiculous prodigies we've seen.  Though, if you count human teenagers, people like Orihime and Tsukishima are pretty absurdly overpowered. (also Ichigo, obviously)*  You probably also have to count Kenpachi as a prodigy since he was strongest as a child, and as strong as some of the strongest shinigami.  Though I think it would be unfair to Hitsugaya to not show him attaining that level of power, considering his prior hype.  It's sort of a shame that he ended up relegated to mid-tier captain power.  I don't really know what to think of Aizen's ultimate plan.  I wouldn't be shocked if we get some silly explanation that his clashing with Ichigo, despite his denial at the time, actually helped to eliminate some of his loneliness.  I definitely think Ichigo would be more likely to volunteer to sacrifice his life to become the Soul King, but Aizen could still easily become a ""kinda-good"" bad guy.  Also there's obviously still the chance that Aizen's feelings about the existence of the Soul King will be vindicated and it will turn out that Aizen was a particularly heartless good guy all along.  *Also Yhwach, but it's hard to count him as a prodigy since he seems to be the successor to a ""God."""
bleach,39hm31,mlc885,3,Fri Jun 12 19:32:10 2015 UTC,Well Yamamoto has been around for more than a 1000 years while Hitsugaya became captain a decade or so after Isshin left Soul Society. Shunsui said that Hitsugaya will pass him in 100 years during his fight with Starrk. I know what you mean about comparison with Aizen but he's still going to become at that level I'm sure. I can see him just being the next captain commander after a certain point.
bleach,39hm31,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally agree.  I'm just concerned that Kubo cares more about him because he's loved by many fans and was an early ally of the protagonist, and won't ever actually show us Hitsugaya at his peak.  Presumably Hitsugaya, ignoring reiatsu, is kind of at a disadvantage when compared to people like Aizen or Gin, since Hitsugaya's power has to be developed whereas their powers pretty much made them stronger than virtually everyone once they obtained them.  Hitsugaya probably has a better chance of additional plot development than most characters, though, especially since fans also care about his side characters like Hinamori and Rangiku, so I would think Kubo probably won't forget about his hype for Hitsugaya. (though I wouldn't be shocked if we only got some dumb flash forward showing him as CC, or whatever leadership position would exist at the time after this all plays out)"

I love her/him/it/that. Gremmy: he was pretty enjoyable and OP in my eyes. The way he didn't give a fuck about who could die was lovely. He got Kenpachi'd, there is NO SHAME in that. I mean, Yammy's one was worse. Jugram Haschwalth: too much mistery around him gives me an Ulquiorra like vibe but he somehow feels cooler. Maybe the fact he is in an actual power position.

bleach,39cpl6,ElModeloEnPace,3,Wed Jun 10 23:48:41 2015 UTC,"So, here's why I keep coming back.   I stopped and then Naruto ended and One Piece is way too inconsistent, so there would be weeks when I wouldn't have anything to read. I hate not knowing how a story ends I've invested countless hours into the anime and manga The Soul Society arc was probably the greatest arc in a manga I've ever read. It was tight, the cliff hangers were appropriate, and you had no idea where things were going next Hueco Mundo was a bit of a rehash of that same story line, but it revealed how expansive this world could be. Plus the fights were cool The beginning of this arc gave me so much hope. It was the best parts of Bleach all over again, and it was super fast paced. It let me know that Kubo still had it in him   I'm honestly probably going to stop reading for awhile, because Naruto is back. It appears chapters are finally going to have character development and actual plot, but Bleach is best when read in a long conscious stream. I'll probably come back once Naruto Gaiden ends or One Piece goes on another break."
bleach,39cpl6,Direktorman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I don't have an expansive list of reasons like you do, but I guess yours could pretty much work for me too (if you cross out the Naruto and One Piece ones, I've never read them). And I agree that Bleach is best when read in a long stream, but I kinda like this little tradition of sitting down every Thursday and reading little snippets of the story.  So go ahead and enjoy those other series, and when you do come back, I hope Kubo will have prepared something that's to your liking :)"

bleach,39cpl6,sephtis,0,Thu Jun 11 00:57:13 2015 UTC,Maybe you should actually read the chapter and look at the panels then? If you're one of those people who say the chapters are shit then I have no sympathy.
bleach,39cpl6,Runefall,4,Thu Jun 11 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"I would ask of you to put the pitchfork down please :)  I have never once said the chapters are shit, nor did I say that in my comment. I have read every chapter, and if I didn't like it at all, then I wouldn't be reading it. I think Kubo can draw beautifully, but also has a tendency to have action sequences or aggressive movements drawn at strange angles that make it difficult to ascertain the current situation. I think his plot has suffered from many shonen tropes that may simply be due to the fact that Bleach has gone on for so long. I'm already incredibly invested in the story and the main characters (Kubo's particular strength), but that doesn't mean I haven't grown tired of the Ichigo power-up or continuous deus ex machina that pervades the storylines. Bleach will always have a special place in my heart, but I'm looking forward to it wrapping up as well."
bleach,39cpl6,zaerosz,2,Thu Jun 11 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"I was never directly calling you out for saying it's shit. I said IF.   As for Deus Ex Machina, most if not all the things are explained or foreshadowed. Besides, you can't even accurately call DEM until the story is over because not everything is explained. The story is told in a way that gives the reader questions and mysteries about characters. (Kisuke Urahara) You can't say anything Kisuke does is DEM because we know very little about him. The things we do know about him are his undeniable intelligence and how resourceful he is. This is part of his character. His origin could very well be the explanation needed to verify everything he's capable of."
bleach,39cpl6,Alluka-,2,Thu Jun 11 02:27:14 2015 UTC,"Besides, you can't even accurately call DEM until the story is over because not everything is explained.   I mean that's now how Deus Ex Machina works. You can explain it down the line, but that doesn't make it any less of Deus Ex Machina. Hell the fact that the author is releasing a story over such an extended period of time makes it even more Deus Ex.   People make the mistake of thinking all Deus Ex Machina is bad and a sign of poor writing, but it's not. When used properly it can elevate a good story to an amazing story. Look at Avatar. In both the original story and the Legend of Korra major plot points are solved through Deus Ex Machina, but they're done in such a beautiful and skilled way you're okay with them (they're also explained down the road or through background images).  Deus Ex Machina is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object.  In Bleach Kaikyō Kotei and everything leading up to Ichigo defeating Aizen was pure unadulterated Deus Ex. Aizen destroyed the Kōtotsu purely so Ichigo could train, and you can't even begin to tell me Isshin knew all of this was going to happen and just happened to be carrying those devices, and he had the perfect amount of Reitsu to ensure Ichigo learned FTG.  Finally Ichigo getting his powers back is another classic example of Deus Ex Machina. Why would everyone act like it was a big deal for Ichigo to use FTG if he was just going to get his powers back because the same method that got him his powers would work again? That was a clear instance of Kubo painting himself into a corner and using an old plot device to restore Ichigo's powers. This is especially evident when you look at how much they talk about how his powers are gone permanently and he doesn't even have a shred of reiatsu for the powers to latch onto. It also completely takes away any downside to using FTG. What the downside is you lose your powers for a week until someone gives them back? That's a no brainer when you're trying to save the universe."

bleach,399axg,kenjiftw,5,Wed Jun 10 18:17:53 2015 UTC,also want to note that you can choose between the english dub or regular japanese version with english sub (although i recommend with english sub 100% for bleach)

bleach,399axg,HatoriHanzoSteel,7,Wed Jun 10 07:59:06 2015 UTC,"Well, Netflix does have to buy the rights for a limited time for what they show. I'm sure that after it gets a perfect rating they will add the rest."
bleach,399axg,Peralinth,4,Wed Jun 10 08:12:00 2015 UTC,"They might not, it really depends on the series. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood only has the first four seasons up, and it's been like that for ages."
bleach,399axg,spitfireM21,3,Wed Jun 10 14:19:16 2015 UTC,"Brotherhood is only 2 seasons long. For whatever reason Netflix has it in volume format, and only has 4 of the 5 volumes that make up the series, so it is missing the last 5 or 6 episodes.  A friend of mine actually thought it was the whole series and kept telling me how bad the end was until he happened to be over during the finale and he was blown away how wrong his guess was. If you haven't seen the last few yet, rob a bank and buy the DVD, it is one of the most satisfying endings to a story I've ever encountered."
bleach,399axg,Peralinth,2,Wed Jun 10 18:22:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, Netflix has it in volumes, that makes sense. I did watch the rest of the episodes (no idea where, it's been a while), and yes... it was definitely worth it! FMA: Brotherhood was probably the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched, especially since the English voices are just so good, which is such a rarity for anime."

In the same breath, I am somehow not excited about learning more about them ever since what Kubo did to the Royal Guard, who have been a hype-build-up for YEARS since the turning of the pendulum arc or whatever, only get brushed away as plot fodder, no bankais, no thing.  I don't even count Ichebei's retarded moseleum of infinite sadness and the meloncholies, it got one hitted - it doesn't count.

Yamamoto can't attack babies as we know it , that's why he couldn't strike him down then.  This is the Humiliation Yhwach was talking about.

His bankai is also insanely overpowered. This is also before Yhwach absorbed the souls of the dead stern ritter / absorbed the soul king.   If you go back and look at the panel where the true Yhwach reveals himself, Yama jumps into bankai immediately. You can see the resolve to thrash Yhwach in him. However, as soon as Yhwach steals Yama's bankai, Yama gives up. I think that gives a hint to just how devastating ZnT is."

It's as he said (and I'm paraphrasing) - ""how do you think I've managed to stay the Captain Commander for 1000 years?

bleach,398egm,yukeake,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"maybe yhwach and the soul king were part of a dynasty in the SS....yama was probably a general that lead a rebellion against a corrupt dynasty....soul king changed his mind and yielded and punished his son yhwach for his crimes.....and the soul king delegated both his power and his authority to the shinigami and the central 46 and went into a slumber  yama probably was able to defeat yhwach through a combination of forbidden kido, his bankai, if anything the soul king may have auswahhlened yhwach as a last ditch effort to protect himself"
bleach,398egm,ajjuha,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:34:27 2015 UTC,I always felt like it would have been a stalemate. I'm aware of Yamamoto's bankai greatness but who the hell sealed Yhwach is what I want to know. Was it the same group of people that sealed the Soul King?
bleach,398egm,SUfan1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:15:35 2015 UTC,Yama 1000 years ago is Kenpachi minus ever putting restraints on himself. Yamamoto was a guy who wouldn't let you become a traitor because he killed everyone who even thought about going against him. He was a tyrant murderer that organized the greatest fighting force in history and overthrew the group that organized the souls of the world. Yama lead that group of shinigami with ever growing power for 1000 years and no one had been born who had more raw energy than him.

bleach,398egm,Jedy_hacker,-1,Wed Jun 10 13:18:54 2015 UTC,Only his fan boys think Yamma is stronger.   They always forget that as soon as he gets his bankai stole he gets wrecked easily also forgetting there are other shinigami who didn't use Bankai and still out performed him.   Like when Ichigo's dad did better against Aizen than Yamma did... Neither using Bankai.
bleach,398egm,rickdousey,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"he gets wrecked easily   Yeah, it's not like he vaporised Wonderweiss with his bare hands and then had to facetank the accumulated total destruction of his strongest Shikai move concentrated in a container no larger than your average garbage can. Which, had he not done so, would have totally annihilated all of Fake AND real Karakura town as Aizen thanked him for stopping the blast. It's almost like you don't read or watch Bleach, these are all fully supported statements - I'm not even making assumptions or far-fetched links."
bleach,395hnz,Xallog,34,Tue Jun 9 11:54:03 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed Aizen knew. Also none of the top 4 Espada were allowed to use their sword releases or certain cero's in los noches for risk of destroying the whole place. Don't write the top 3 off so quickly  Hallibel vs Ulquirra Segunda -  I give edge to Ulq, but Hallibel's fight showed the classic manga trope of people not using their most powerful abilities until they have to.. Hallibel went unscathed (yes she was frozen once) but she suffered no damage. Damage is always shown in the manga/anime so thats just a credit to how strong she is. She was never pushed to fight harder that needed and Aizen cut her down before we did see that.  Also remember that Yhwach went to Hueco Mundo to single handedly fight and capture Hallibel. That implies that she was too strong for anyone else to handle with certainty.. Hallibel kicked ass but the edge still probably goes to Ulquiorra.  vs Barragon :  Sorry but Barragan's skills aren't as ""Hax"" as everyone says.. ""his power ages everything""   does it age air? does it age energy? how about reiatsu?  If you want to use a bit of science and half lifes of elements, etc. I think Barragan had plenty of weaknesses.   I think both starrk and ulq segunda could defeat barragan thanks to cero's or energy based attacks. I dont think they would age fast enough. The most important skill is barragans ability to slow things as they approach him.. That might let him dodge some stuff, but enough explosions near him and he's gonna get beat up.  Also I think Ulquiorra in Segunda Etapa is too fast for Barragan to ever land a hit on or damage him.  Ulq wins once he figures out the tricks.  Starrk.   Maybe I'm biased but I think Starrk is stronger than the other espada by a significant margin. Yes shunsui took him out, but he's also shunsui... so ya.   This matchup with Ulquiorra would be great though and from what we've seen its a stalemate unless Starrk can tap into his full potential. We never saw a hint of that though and his wolves in resurrection were quite frankly stupid. Cero Matrelleta (sp) was unreal though and almost pushed shunsui to bankai..  Hard matchup to call. I'd say it could go either way even with Starrk being so strong"
bleach,395hnz,c9IceCream,34,Tue Jun 9 13:21:45 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah, Barragan's ability aged everything including energy and reiatsu. He specifically showed Hachi and SoiFon that when he fought them.   Barragan suffered from hubris, which is like 90% the biggest character flaw of bleach characters."
bleach,395hnz,KanyeWest_AMA,6,Tue Jun 9 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"but, if the Reitsu was so powerful that he couldn't age it fast enough (to eliminate it) before the blast hits him then it is possible for him to take damage, Hachi just ""locked him up"" so he had all the time in the world to age it"
bleach,395hnz,LucciDVergo,9,Tue Jun 9 14:17:24 2015 UTC,"We've seen no indication that anyone can lock him to limit his Respira's acting area besides Hachi and perhaps Opie.  So I'd say that starrk MAY be able to handle it by sheer quantity of ceros, or using the wolves as both energy and soul would have to be aged. But once Respira has advanced a good distance, most attacks, including the Lanza, would likely be scratches at worst."
bleach,395hnz,HiHoJufro,8,Tue Jun 9 14:30:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you remember well. Being hit by soifon's bankai didn't kill barragan.  It was when he was aging hachi that hachi teleported his aging hand into Barragan and that's what killed him. Hachi stated only absolute power could beat him.   So essentially, barragan killed himself."
bleach,395hnz,KanyeWest_AMA,7,Tue Jun 9 14:32:36 2015 UTC,Aizen also stated his shikai was absolute hypnosis. But we clearly see that people with high amounts of reiatsu can at the very least oppose some of that power. Barragan was extremely conceited. What makes you think he wasn't making up crap about his own powers?
bleach,395hnz,rogrogrickroll,6,Tue Jun 9 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"This is such a good point, for any manga.  Most villains are written as arrogant but people always take them at their word which muddles these discussion"
bleach,395hnz,LucciDVergo,16,Tue Jun 9 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with these types of characters is that they know they're powerful af, but kubo writes them so weirdly it doesn't come off that way.  On paper, Barragan shouldn't be losing to anyone. Same with starkk, I still am trying to figure how the fuck that nigga shunsui was dodging 100x ceros directly, there should be no space there fam.  Barragan now was shown to have this protective respira shield when omaeda tried attacking him, so tell me, there is no reason besides plot that Barragan couldn't have cranked up his respira to be 300 and constantly be eroding shit. The dude claimed he was the master of the time but I guess kubo loves the arrogant characters. I mean starkk basically let himself die because he was lazy, if that isn't the pinnacle of arrogance Idk what is. Even hachi told soifon during their battle after he created the barrier that he doesn't think Barragan is going to ""tmake a move just yet"" which Barragan then used to monologue and watch hachi build a stronger barrier and then watch soifon load up her bankai all while laughing to himself about how futile and pointless it is. Seriously, get off your own dick son  But that's bleach, from byakuya in the SS arc to yhwach now, arrogance has been one of the most recurring and devastating plot points/character traits in the series. Bleach is literally about having the biggest dick and rubbing it in your opponents face."

bleach,395hnz,ScootsBoots,2,Wed Jun 10 09:17:24 2015 UTC,"It hurt him significantly when he was sealed in Hachi's barrier. And remember, when she fired it the first time, he used Respira to decay it from a distance and cause it to explode BEFORE it got to him. Meaning, he couldn't have been able to dodge the attack. So, because Barragan can cause things to age from a distance, Id say he would try this tactic if he ever fought Starrk. And even then, if he only managed to age them to where it wouldn't hit as hard, he would still get hit. (Not to mention, he never uses sonido from what I have seen.)"

bleach,395hnz,Temperatia,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting, the only thing I don't agree on is why Yhwach fought Halibel. When Mayuri and Urahara were talking about why the Vandenreich don't steal the Arrancer's Resurrection because they found it degrading I figured that in order for the quincies to remain as 'pure' as possible Yhwach himself goes to fight her so his underlings don't have to lower themselves to steal Halibel's Ressurection in order to beat her."
bleach,395hnz,Temperatia,2,Tue Jun 9 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Mayuri offered that as a possibility, but the reason they decided on (and later proved by giving Hollow pills to the Captains) was that a Resurreccion would poison the Quincy that possessed it."
bleach,395hnz,c9IceCream,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"definitely a fair counterpoint, but it also gives credit to how strong she is. They couldn't have defeated her without stealing her resurrection."
bleach,395hnz,Neknoh,38,Tue Jun 9 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"Groan. Not this again.     Ok, so. People. Ulqiorra had a limit before his regeneration kicked the bucket, and it wasn't super high really.     Harribel never fought at full power, but even not at full power, she stomped all over Hitsugaya and his most powerful attack. After which, she still held her own in combat against him and to Vaizards untill Aizen cut her down, and she still lived.     Ywach even went to Hueco Mundo himself to fight and capture her. I'm sorry, but, she has displayed the ability to take more punishment and hinted at being able to dish it better as well. She was stronger. Aizen always knew.     Barragan was even more powerful. What Ulquiorra did in his combat against Ichigo was pretty much the same thing Soifon tried against Barragan. And even if her reiatsu may have been lower than that of Ulqs segunda, Barragans Respira still worked against Jakuhou. And I'd even argue her Bankai was more powerful than Lanza, in large part due to the expenditure of energy required to fire it off in comparison. And he still tanked it. Ulquiorra did not survive an explosion of that magnitude when it came from Hichigo's cero, hell, the explosion may have been weaker.     And now, Starrk, the master of not fighting at max capacity and still rocking plenty of captain face. Don't listen to the Anime, read the manga. It's quick, it's dirty and when he even tries the slightest bit, he pushed Kyoraku toward Bankai, expected a thousand zero's at once to overload Ukitake's shikai and he casually tore down Love and Rose. Purely from what we've seen, he was far and beyond anything else Aizen brought, possibly stronger than Gin and Tousen both. But, he could not be bothered, and when he was left without Barragan or Harribel, he gave up.      The energy expenditure to launch not only a single cero that could hurt a captain (Kyoraku never blocks any of Starrk's ceros), but a thousand of them at once? I am so sad we never got to see what he really could do, but on a pure power basis. And as said elsewhere, it was Kyoraku who took him down, second captain commander, and he did so through swordplay against an opponent no longer wanting to win, not by overpowering him.     In fact, Ulquiorra was the only one of the top 4 espadas to be overpowered by his opponent. The other three were untouchable on a whole different level.     Ulquirra fought Ichigo when Ichigo really wasn't anywhere near peak condition, this is what leads people to hype him so much. He was our main villain for so long and fought the protagonist but... guess what. Plenty of people were more powerful than Ichigo at the time, and when Ulq2 met Hichigo, he got absolutely torn appart. Utterly and totally destroyed even. To think Ulquiorra was more powerful than the other Arrancar that Aizen ranked above him is mostly a case of not looking at what actually took place."

I'm sorry, but, she has displayed the ability to take more punishment and hinted at being able to dish it better as well. She was stronger. Aizen always knew.   If you think about it Harribel should have had a higher number given the nature of her abilities. She is stronger when there is water around, yet when she earned her rank she was in a desert- the worst conditions for her to work with. She had to be very powerful to be 3."
bleach,395hnz,Neknoh,3,Tue Jun 9 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"I believe that the assertation from Hitsugaya about her waiting for humidity to build up means that she supplies her own water, and since she's powerful enough to tank everything Hitsugaya could throw at her without a scratch, she can likely fight until she has upped the humidity enough."

bleach,395hnz,Neknoh,-2,Tue Jun 9 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Because most people gauge ulq's power from his Lanza's explosion and Hichigos cero wasn't way bigger. And again, it seemed to be more of a matchup than anything else (the same way Hitsugaya was the ideal counter to Halibel, pretty much solely due to his zanpakuto). I.e. Hichigo does not appear to be way stronger than Ulq, but rather fights in a way more savage way that Ulq did not know how to deal with. Even small power gaps in Bleach deals huge advantages to the favoured matchup.     Had Hitsugaya been more powerful than Harribel, even just by a little bit, his advantage of icing her attacks wouöd have resulted in a quick kill."

bleach,395hnz,Neknoh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"There is no indication of it. Wonderweiss is unclesr wether or not he was just a wakeup call for the Espada to get serious (as indicated by Starrk), or if he did indeed do... Something (We can't be sure if the ice cracks with the scream in the background or if it cracks because the scream hits it).      However. She was unharmed when she came out of the ice. Kubo loves doing slight injuries and scuffmarks to show that things did have an effect, but she is unscathed."
bleach,395hnz,SilviteRamirez,0,Thu Jun 11 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"Harribel stomped all over Hitsugaya, the worst-performing Captain who has ever been introduced, and possibly the two most useless Vaizards in the group. Hiyori is just a hot-tempered child and Lisa can literally only compete with her mask on and even then she's lacklustre. Suggesting that it's any sort of accomplishment to fight the dregs of the series all funnelled into one big cup of disappointment tea doesn't help convince anybody that Harribel was remotely worthy of being the new 3.   I'm not sure what you're suggesting by mentioning what Respira works on because Barragon explains that everything can age and because of that everything is equal under his power. There is nothing that can confirm that a large enough disparity of reiatsu would be sufficient defence against his power. Beyond that, he only ""tanked"" Soifons Bankai because he was able to age it and drain it of a lot of it's maximum yield. BOTH TIMES. The second time resulted in very real damage to Barragon, so I don't think that qualifies as tanking as much as surviving. It took Ulquiorra being hit point-blank by the cataclysmic power of Hichigos Cero to take the same damage as Barragon. (Also suggesting that Soifons Bankai requires more energy than Ulquiorra's Lanza del Relampago is hilarious considering just how impossibly stronger Ulquiorra was than a totally-fine Hollowfied Ichigo. Adding to this - Soifon isn't known for having a large capacity for her reiatsu, she's known for her speed. The reason her Bankai is so taxing on her is because she doesn't have a lot of reiatsu to spend in the first place)  Starrk I am willing to agree with you on, though. Regardless of discrepancies between the manga and the anime, Starrk was the only Espada whose mere presence was enough to snuff the life of lesser beings just by being around them. He had the same effect on Hollows as Aizen did to humans. He never fought seriously and died essentially to a cheap shot (I refuse to believe that Kyoraku wears that black suit under his regular clothes for any other reason than to use as a gambit with Ira Oni) So I think that if Starrk had a reason to fight at full capacity that he would absolutely annihilate Ulquiorra even in Segunda Etapa, but I don't think there was anything in Starrks mind that would motivate him to do so. Normally I'd say ""put his only friend in danger / kill her"" but that's what made him give up in the first place, so...  TL:DR - I agree with you 1/3"
bleach,395hnz,maytagem,14,Thu Jun 11 15:32:16 2015 UTC,If this sub were to be believed Ulquiorra could solo Ywach in his sleep. Good luck finding objectivity while discussing him
bleach,395hnz,aizen6,12,Fri Jun 12 05:12:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Respira isn't Baraggan's only ability. We have to remember, he outran Soifon in his unreleased state, so he's faster than almost everyone else in the Gotei. That means that Ulquiorra could be attacked before he can defend. Maybe power for power, Ulquiorra's attacks have a wider range and more pure destruction. That Lanza del Relampago sure packs a punch, but if all it takes is for Baraggan to touch Ulquiorra's arm or leg before he unleashes the attack, it's pretty much useless.  Now I don't know about Harribel because her powers, while having a large area of action, didn't seem to be as ""destructive"" as Ulqui's, Starrk's or Baraggan's in the strictest sense of the word. But her powers have much greater potential for defensive use. How that would fare a direct attack from Segunda Etapa remains to be seen, but I think if Aizen-taichou put her above Ulquiorra, it would fare quite well."
bleach,395hnz,aequusnox,8,Tue Jun 9 13:20:42 2015 UTC,Well ulquiorra could always just regenerate that arm or leg
bleach,395hnz,aizen6,4,Tue Jun 9 13:27:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, but Aizen-taichou in all his wisdom ranked Baraggan above Ulquiorra and Harribel, and he knows these guys' fighting power better than anyone, so I guess it wouldn't be that easy.   Baraggan is deceptively fast; he casually placed his hand on Soifon's shoulder before she could even notice it. And Soifon is second only to Yoruichi in speed, so I doubt if Ulquiorra could afford the time to regenerate while keeping up his attack/defense. Sure, respira might not be as fast as he might claim it to be, but there's always Gran Caida, and he could just cut an opponent down rather than breathe him into oblivion."
bleach,395hnz,XerGod,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:12:12 2015 UTC,"I would say soifon is third in speed, behind the zero division guy with the paddle and yoruichi."

bleach,395hnz,Yusumay,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:53:30 2015 UTC,"so he's faster than almost everyone else in the Gotei.   Ichigo falls under that category as well, not to mention Ulq outsped him in his unreleased state too.  On top of that, a few people seem to not give a fuck (For lack of better words to use) that Ulq is a second released state whereas the other three are only in their first release."
bleach,395hnz,aizen6,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:23:32 2015 UTC,"Well, Ichigo's speed boost is only because of his Bankai while Baraggan's is a more natural ability, so he can maintain it for longer periods of time. Moreover, his speed boost wasn't attributed to a technique as such, but as a result of his control over age and time. I think it makes sense to assume he's faster than Ulquiorra because Ulquiorra is nowhere near as fast as Aizen-taichou, and it's a close call between Aizen-taichou and Soifon on speed.  I don't think Ichigo's Bankai speed boost is as good as actual mastery of Shunpo the way Yoruichi, Soifon and Urahara have. Ulquiorra's power was depicted so because he fought in Hueco Mundo where all hell could break loose. Baraggan, Harribel, and Starrk were hindered by the plot armor that wouldn't allow the Tenkaikecchuu to break. Obviously their power couldn't be ""depicted on the same scale"" because that would mean the pillars would be destroyed and all the preparations of the Gotei 13 would be to waste.  Ulquiorra's strong, no doubt about it. But Baraggan's, Harribel's and Starrk's strength was of a different kind. Then again, that's just my take on it. If Kubo-sensei mentioned that Ulquiorra was not as strong as the other three even though he was the only one with a second release, I would take him for his word."
bleach,395hnz,Yusumay,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that Ichigos speed isn't attributed to shunpo mastery. I was referring to raw speed.  Also the only reason I believe that Ulq is the strongest out of the espada is due to the fact that I think of Ressureccion as a power limiter rather than an upgrade (My proof being Baraggan), meaning his Segunda Etapa would've been his original power prior to becoming an espada.  If Segunda was a powerup however, I would rate the top four in terms of power like this:  Starrk > Baraggan > Ulquiorra = Harribel. I put Ulq and Harribel on equal terms due to us having nothing to compare Murcielagos power too (Other than the fact that Ulquiorra essentially raped Ichigo).  TL;DR: Power levels are Bullshit."
bleach,395hnz,SilviteRamirez,0,Wed Jun 10 14:22:07 2015 UTC,He outperformed her in speed because her body wasn't functioning at 100%. There's a part that specifically points out that she notices her reflexes slowing down when she goes to kick him and he casually evades it. It's because he aged her muscles.
bleach,395hnz,LucciDVergo,3,Fri Jun 12 11:45:07 2015 UTC,Aizen must have known or else he wouldn't have left Ulqui to fight Ichigo (remember Aizen wanted Ichigo to fight villians that would help him evolve further).  He also did need the three other espadas to help hold off the Gotei (even if he knew they would lose they did stall a good amount).
bleach,395hnz,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Fri Jun 12 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"When the Karakura town fight was over and Aizen was talking to  Ichigo, he was telling him about all the stuff he knew about him and mentioned the fight with Ulquiorra. If he didn't know then he found out, but I mean it's Aizen of course he knew :)"
bleach,395hnz,CRAEREASDW,2,Tue Jun 9 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"Aizen probably knew about his Segunda Etapa, but may have ranked him by just his initial release as his second release was off the books.   Ulquiorra completely destroyed Vizard mask Ichigo and shaved down the dome of Las Noches with just his first form. Granted, Ichigo wasn't at his best, but he was still stronger than a released Grimmjow. His reiatsu was denser than anyone's either Uryu or Orihime had felt before including Byakuya, Kenpachi, Gin, Mayuri, Grimmjow, Nnoitra, Nel, and Szayel. That's 4 captains (2 in Bankai and 2 in Shikai) and the released forms of Espada 5, 6, and 8. It was so potent, Uryu questioned whether it could even be called reiatsu. A fatal wound from his attack could not be reversed by Orihime's powers, something that was only ever replicated by Yhwach (and maybe transcendent Aizen if she attempted to heal Gin). It is implied in the databooks that he was born a Vasto Lorde and killed every one of his Vasto Lorde siblings shortly after his birth. His Lanza was large enough to destroy Las Noches one hit. Assuming that Las Noches is the same size as the Seireitei, he could wipe out the entire Gotei 13 in an instant. Out of every other Espada 4 and up, Barragan was the only one who didn't die like a disappointment.   Assuming what Aizen said about reiatsu and Orihime is true, Ulquiorra should be able to repel or negate the special abilities of the other arrancar. It's possible that Barragan and Starrk might have enough speed, hax, or reiatsu to stand up to him, but based on what we've seen I'd give it to Ulquiorra. Hallibel is dead in the water."
bleach,395hnz,Xiohunter,4,Tue Jun 9 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"I always considered Ulq to be the strongest espada in the traditional sense of power, speed, and raw destructive power.  The only reason Barragon had a higher ranking was because of the ""hax"" type nature of his power. Starrk on the other hand could split and use his soul willy nilly and the only other person we've seen do that is Yhwach.  Only person I didn't think deserved to be in the top 3 was Hallibel, but we didn't get to see her full power."

bleach,395hnz,Tynarus,2,Thu Jun 11 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"I've always just thought that Ulquiorra was by far the strongest, and Aizen clearly knew this. He had him placed as #4 so that he could stay behind and fight Ichigo while he took the ""top 3"" to the real world to fight the rest of the Gotei. Seeing as he obviously wanted to groom Ichigo into a stronger being (not stronger than himself, but just to see where Ichigo could go, being the perfect hybrid...), he set up progressively stronger and stronger opponents for him to face. I don't think him leaving off at an anti-climactic ""#4"" would be very satisfying for Aizen, honestly...   That, and Ichigo's reiatsu and power were clearly on level with the Captains (reiatsu being higher than most captains, according to Unohana), and Ulquiorra (in his first release state alone) curb-stomped him WITH his mask ON without even the slightest bit of effort... While the captains at least seemed capable of somewhat defending themselves against the ""top 3"" espada (exclusing Shunsui, because he's too much of a boss to even need Bankai).  But, that's just my opinion/take on the matter... Other people have very valid and agreeable points that I'd have no issue accepting. I guess I'm just a little Ulquiorra-biased. :P"
bleach,395hnz,NobleV,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"I wont go into as much detail as I have in the past but here is my tldr version.   Ulquiorra is the strongest in segunda over the other espada. It is easy to not realize because he had to fight Hichigo, who is just obscenely strong. (I think Hichigo is just as strong as Dangai Ichigo, just in a different form. Neither of them had anything holding them back.) Also, compare Segunda to Bankai and the power difference is a much bigger jump than the first powerup. Even at half that jump, still more powerful."
bleach,395hnz,SputterNutter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:21:07 2015 UTC,"Nah dude.  Dangai Ichigo is, to quote a link I will never find, ""physical god tier"".  Hichigo is about 18000% lower.  FOUND IT"

bleach,395hnz,SputterNutter,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:57:48 2015 UTC,"I just figured that we might as well have a standard reference chart for powerlevels, and I've seen this referenced several times.    Also!  I think Dangai Ichigo is still stronger anyway, just because of the control he has.  Hichigo is a berserker--he's crazy strong, but has no way of controlling himself.  Dangai Ichigo has a calm knowledge of exactly how strong he is, so he won't let Aizen get to him.  I feel that if Hichigo had fought Aizen, he would have lost because Aizen would have found a weak point while he was berserking about.  (This last paragraph assumes that Dangai and Hichigo are of comparable power).  BUT if they are of different levels (which I get the feeling they are) then it's so because Dangai Ichigo is actually a combination of all Ichigo's powers (shinihollowquincy), none of which seem to be restrained because he's asserted himself as King again.  Hichigo is just Shiro."
bleach,395hnz,NobleV,0,Thu Jun 11 13:01:36 2015 UTC,"Oh I would agree with you. Dangai is a better fighter and would win because he has control. But Hichigo is ruthless and doesnt hold back. He was out to kill. I believe his power is equal in terms of level. In both cases that force inside Ichigo that held his power back was not there, allowing his full potential to be there."
bleach,395hnz,SputterNutter,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"I still disagree on the actual power level.  The combination of powers is always going to be stronger than a single one.  When Hichigo happened, Ichigo was dead, and Quincygo probably didn't give a shit, so there was no melding (or conflict) of powers.  When Dangai Ichigo happened, it seems to me that it was a melding of all his powers, because he got Tensa's approval."

bleach,395hnz,MrScottyBear,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"I think a major part of why people wonder about Ulq was the way his Reiatsu was described.  Up until Aizen started desitigrating folks and Ichigo got so strong Aizen could no longer feel him, we didn't really get anyone with Reiatsu described in any sort of special way.  Having Ulquiorra be the first and having it described as an Ocean weighing down on them (I forget the exact quote) was pretty substantial at the time.  As for weather or not he's stronger than the Top 3, it's hard to say, honestly.  Pairing him against Ichigo makes any sort of power gauging pretty much impossible."
bleach,395hnz,water_warrior,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the exact quote either, but it certainly is not the first time Ichigo has had someone's Reiatsu weighing down on him that much- I'd say before he fought Kenpachi he felt about the same,"
bleach,395hnz,SilviteRamirez,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but at the time he fought Zaraki Ichigo MAYBE was as strong as a Lieutenant. When he fought Ulquiorra he (this is a slight inference based on his conversation with Unohana) possessed almost double the capacity of a Captain's Reiatsu. If you feel like an enormous, oppressive force is crushing you and you unknowingly have a higher reiatsu than almost all of your peers... well that's saying something indeed."

They're simply ranked by the size of their reiatsu.  I'm not saying that he's strong than the top three -- but considering his reiatsu massively increases in his second release, it's impossible to know where he would rank.  Again, though, the size of your reiatsu isn't necessarily an indication of how capable you are."

bleach,395hnz,Xynth22,2,Sun Jul 12 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"Ichigo isn't a good judge of power due to plot armor and how wildly Ichigo's power varies from time to time.

bleach,395hnz,Xynth22,2,Thu Jun 11 08:35:36 2015 UTC,"By your own admission, clearly he was not the strongest captain, which is the reason why I made the comparison with your leap in logic in your original comment. Just because Ichigo fights someone in a particular group and that happens to be the last fight of that arc, it does not make that person the strongest member of that group. That is a fallacy. Now, I'm not sure of the specific name for that fallacy, but I'm sure there is one, lol.   And not to harp on the Byukaya stuff too much since that's not really the focus here, but Yamamoto and Shunsui were not the only ones stronger than Byakuya. All 4 of the oldest captains were, which include Ukitake and Unohana as well, and really since Aizen and his gang hadn't quite left the Gotei at the time, Aizen, Gin, and Kaname would have been stronger too, or at least would have been able to beat him due to hax bankai's in Kaname's case, but that might be nit picking."

bleach,395hnz,5yk0515,0,Tue Jun 9 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"First off: the Espada are ranked solely by Reiatsu. We've seen that Reiatsu and base stats (speed, brute strength, durability etc) do not always correlate. Example being Nnoitra having higher Reiatsu, durability and brute strength than Grimmjow but the latter has higher speed, mobility, and range, or Aaroniero and Szayel having higher Reiatsu and possibly speed and skill) than unreleased Yammy but the latter having more raw power and durability. Or Nnoitra and Zommari having the hardest Hierro/best CQC and fastest Sonido of all the Espadas despite only being ranked 5th and 7th (or 6th and 8th if you count Yammy as the strongest) in terms of Reiatsu.  Secondly: depends on how big the power gaps between the ranks are. They might be large...or very small.  So it might be that Ulquiorra has comparable or better stats than the Top 3 (perhaps he's faster than Harribel but has less raw power than her, etc) and that the Reiatsu gap between him and the Top 3 in terms of unreleased form and first Resurreccion) is quite small and the Segunda Etapa pushes him above their level.  Also: knowing about something and knowing the details of something are two different things. It could be that Aizen knew he had a second release, but not the specifics (like the power boost or abilities). Like Shinji. Aizen knew he had Shikai, but because Shinji never revealed it to him before FKT, he didn't know what it could do. Same with Gin. He didn't know what Kamishini no Yari's true ability was until it was too late, simply because Gin never revealed it until then.  Aizen is not omniscient."

bleach,39b53j,COMPLIMENT-4-U,8,Wed Jun 10 20:24:47 2015 UTC,Tousen had a bankai when he was 5th seat. He also had Hollow powers and a person whose death inspired him to become a fighter. He had quite a few things in common with Ichigo... how typical of Kubo to destroy a good pairing with someone's death.
bleach,39b53j,Zeta42,3,Wed Jun 10 16:39:48 2015 UTC,I seem to remember reading that Tosen's bankai wasn't fully developed in turn back the pendulum. It definitely didn't cover as much volume as it does when he fights Kenpachi.
bleach,39b53j,H4rtland,5,Wed Jun 10 17:07:23 2015 UTC,rukia's bankai seems rather weak. considering she become frozen herself.  rukia in a battle. bankai about to win.  from five miles away Kamishininoyari~ shatters rukia
bleach,39b53j,YachiruTheKittyKat,3,Thu Jun 11 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"That's because she hasn't gained full control yet. If she ever does, she will be a monster. Only those with hax abilities or crazy fire abilities will be able to stand up to her without instantly freezing."

bleach,39b53j,Xynth22,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:12:28 2015 UTC,"It makes no sense either. Its power is the ability to reduce one's temperature all the way to absolute zero kelvin degree.  That level of heat is completely theoretical, it's thought to be the level of heat in which ""No atoms can move or react"", thus being the absolute coldest level of heat one can reach.  This is why Kubo shat all over physics and science, because god knows how Rukia can move or do anything in that state."
bleach,39b53j,angryspacemahreen,3,Thu Jun 11 08:54:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, if they were at 0k nothing would be moving. What would be cooler if it reduced the area around her to 0k, while protecting her at just above it. She would be untouchable because she would be the only thing able to move."

Soi Fon's shikai is supposed to be able to 2hit kill people, but you can ""remove the effect with more reiatsu"".  Things hit by wabisuke are supposed to have double the weight, eventually being uncarriable. But you can carry it with ""more reiatsu"".  Shinji's shikai reverses everything. But you can see through it with ""more reiatsu.""  Everything in this manga has ""unique abilities"" that all boil down to power levels. It really does not matter what kind of an advantage you have compared to somebody else. Everything is about reiatsu.  And Rukia's bankai would be ridiculously op if not for that. 'Cause she's definitely gonna fight someone who's gonna protect herself/himself from the 0 kelvin effect with...guess what?  More reiatsu."

There must be more to it but that's what we know for now but if a Quincy killed Chad or Orihime they would not go to Soul Society.  So anyone who has died by to a Quincy in this arc will not be reincarnated."

What Quincies do is destroy the soul instead of sending it to soul society. So if they were to get their souls killed by a Quincy then they would be actually dead.

bleach,39akid,Sammier,11,Wed Jun 10 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Seriously though, Ichigo then fights Ulquiorra, dies in process. Then his op hollow powers bring him back to life he wrecks Ulquiorra. Then he later fights Aizen, even though Aizen basically becomes a god, Ichigo gets even bigger god power up and beats him, but Aizen doesn't die. But Urahara secretly planted kido into Aizen in previous fight and seals him.  Then Ichigo starts to lose powers cause his god mode took all his power basically..  SO he wants to get them back, and he meets these humans with powers called Fullbringers. They basically use Ichigo to get more power, they use him, and then Ichigo get his power back from all his friends, and then beats them.   Finally, some quincies invade soul society with the quincy leader and creator Ywach, and wreck everyone. Literally everyone loses their fight, and Yamamoto dies, R.I.P. But no one else really. (Not Confirmed). Ichigo during this finds out he is quincy, then goes up to zero division gets upgrade to full soul reaper and becomes dual wielder. Then the quincies invade again wreck everyone again and go up to soul palace and wreck the zero division and Ywach kills soul king, becomes even more godlike. And currently the rest of the Seireitei and Ichigo and crew plan a counter attack.   So that is very basic concept of what happen. There is a lot of extra and important information in between, so I recommend catching up, because it is too much to explain everything. But I tried giving general gist of what happened."

bleach,398koq,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"Metal umlaut:       A metal umlaut is a diacritic that is sometimes used gratuitously or decoratively over letters in the names of hard rock or heavy metal bands—for example those of Queensrÿche, Blue Öyster Cult, Motörhead, The Accüsed, and Mötley Crüe.  Among English speakers, the use of umlaut marks and other diacritics with a blackletter style typeface is a form of foreign branding intended to give a band's logo a Teutonic quality—denoting stereotypes of boldness and strength commonly attributed to ancient northern European peoples, such as the Vikings and Goths. Its use has also been attributed to a desire for a ""gothic horror"" feel.  The metal umlaut is not generally intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name.  These decorative umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction; in the mockumentary film This Is Spın̈al Tap, fictional rocker David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) says, ""It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you.""      Interesting: Da Möb | Jon Udell | N-diaeresis   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Some of them obviously suggest a particularly nationality (Berenice and Driscoll for Italian, Meninas and Gremmy for French, Shaz and Lille for Spanish, NaNaNa Indian, Cang Chinese), but most of them are fairly ambiguous."
bleach,398koq,water_warrior,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:48:45 2015 UTC,"Nnoitra, in both the dub in the sub (at least in the English one), is pronounced Noh-ee-TOH-rah, and I don't think they would change it from the manga to the anime. Pretty sure the other ones are correct though!   Source: Original sub English dub  Granted, even though Tesla is dying while saying this, it doesn't really make sense that he'd pronounce it so differently. That and they use the same pronunciation elsewhere."
bleach,398koq,Andygoesrawr,2,Thu Jun 11 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"Half the names in the dubbed anime are pronounced incorrectly. It's pronounced Noitora in the sub and dub because that's how his name is written in Japanese, and I'm fairly certain the name aired in the anime before we had the official spelling of Nnoitra. It's basically the difference between pronouncing Grimmjow's name ""gurimujou"" and ""grimjoh"".  So what I'm really saying is that Noitora and Noitra are both correct, but the only real excuse for pronouncing it Noitora instead of Noitra is if you're Japanese. Noitra (NOY-tra) is the correct English pronunciation.  His name comes from Richard Neutra, where it's pronounced NOY-tra because it's an Austrian surname."
bleach,395t6t,Shunsui_for_CC,4,Tue Jun 9 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"I don't see why the Schrifts would return to him. Schrifts are just the Quincy fragments inside their souls shaped in such a way that it grants the Quincy special powers. Their soul fragments would need to be reshaped for their Schrifts to disappear but their regular Quincy powers remain.  Though we don't know if Yhwach had even discovered Schrifts yet 1,000 years ago."
bleach,395t6t,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:47:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.... now that you say it, i got another question. If Yhwach didn't discover the Schrift ability back then, does that mean there were no sternritters? These questions struck me when i though of Soken. I wondered if Soken was a sternritter or not."
bleach,395t6t,Andygoesrawr,3,Tue Jun 9 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"If there were no Schrifts, there wouldn't have been Sternritter. I think there were both, though. But I don't think Souken had a Schrift, otherwise Ryuuken and Uryuu would've inherited it.  I think it's possible Masaki had a Schrift though. We're told her Blut Vene was exceptionally strong, so she might've inherited something like The Blood (which is what I think Haschwalth's ability is, essentially superpowered Blut Vene and Arterie that can be balanced between to use both at once, or a superpowered version of each one at a time). If that's the case, Ichigo would also have it."
bleach,395t6t,Jedy_hacker,2,Tue Jun 9 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Assuming Ichigo's first used quincy ability is Blut Vene, it's possible that Masaki had a Schrift. In any case, thanks for the answers"
bleach,395t6t,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"I think it was ""answered"" in the manga.   OMZ looks like Yhwach 1000 years ago , that's the time when he fought Yama-ji,so he must of learned it earlier, well , in the panels where we get a bit of background about Yhwach ,and are told about the Scrifts (also it's the moment when we received a ""blurry timescale"" for when he learned them), we are shown a younger version of Yhwach mp    ms, probably younger than Tensa Zangetsu.  So the answer would be  , He learned to do Schrifts before he fought Yama-ji , in a timescale of Tensa zangetsu age form - - -> Baby Ywach age form"
bleach,395t6t,Jedy_hacker,2,Tue Jun 9 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree the fact that we're shown a young Yhwach when it's explained that he learned how to give Schrifts suggests he learned it when he was young, but I don't think that's necessarily what Kubo was implying. He was just explaining that Yhwach learned how to transfer his soul when he was young, but figured out the Schrift method when he was older. We're not told exactly when he discovered the method.  But I do think Schrifts existed 1,000 years ago. The Lloyd brothers were born with their Schrifts, and they're obviously more than 9 years old. That means they inherited their Schrifts from a line that goes back 1,000 years."

bleach,39654x,richiegraine,5,Tue Jun 9 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, Yhwach didn't care about the Shinigami part of Ichigo either. All the while, he was bragging about how Ichigo was ""his son born in the dark"" and how the ""Quincy blood runs in his veins"" and all. And even he didn't demonstrate any knowledge about the Fullbring part of Ichigo.  Aizen-taichou knew that Ichigo's mom was a Quincy; he saw the battle between Isshin, Masaki, and White, and he saw Masaki shoot White with her bow. Considering Aizen-taichou, it would be safe to assume that he tracked Masaki up until her death, because around that time, Isshin would have started recovering his Shinigami powers. Now I can only guess as to why Aizen-taichou never mentioned anything about Ichigo's Quincy nature, but he's also too knowledgeable about Soul Society, in general, to not know about Yhwach or other Quincy."

When he was talking to Ichigo in Karakura he said something along the lines of ""You've always been special, as you are the offspring of a Shinigami and a... (Isshin joins in and interrupts Aizen)"".  There's no way he was going to say ""Hey, you're special because you're half shinigami and half average human"".  Edit: Oh, keep in mind the anime got this totally wrong. In the anime Aizen says ""You're the offspring of a human and a..."", like Isshin being a Shinigami is the actual plot twist. It's not."

I suspect that Aizen knew who Ywach was because he never asked Ywach who he was when Ywach asked him to join him. Aizen knew also at the end of Decide that Ichigo had surpassed him but his arrogance got the best of him. Aizen also know that he wasn't just a mere human but the perfect hybrid. Now what his expectations of Ichigo was besides using the powers for himself..is yet to be seen...but I suspect Ichigo was being groomed for something between Aizen and Urahara.

bleach,39654x,Sirocco_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:25:15 2015 UTC,"I think Aizen was saying ""mere human"" as a means of subtely insulting his Quincy lineage. Aizen definitely knew about Masaki (remember, Grand Fisher was one of his subjugated Hollows). Both the Quincy and the Shinigami seem to have an equal amount of disdain for the other.   I'm 99% certain that all Captains knew about the previous Substitute Shinigami and how he came to be. He did commit some pretty severe crimes to have such an elaborate planned hatched to capture/kill him. Aizen probably just wasn't very interested in Fullbringers powers because it seems their powers are far less impressive than that of powerful Shinigami; though their powers do seem very useful in the -right- situations.   On a related note, it would be nice to see Riruka dollhouse Aizen."

bleach,395blx,Naliichigo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"Can Ywach steal Ichigo's power since Ichigo has a piece of his soul?? Even if Ywach is unable to steal ichigo's power ( due to Ichigo having hollow power), Ywach prob is still able to manipulate Ichigo 's movement though Quincy blood that flows through Ichigo..  I think Ichigo is extremely powerful, but I wonder if the Quincy herritage might be his weakness against Ywach.."
bleach,394it1,silentorbx,21,Tue Jun 9 05:11:34 2015 UTC,"Firstly, his power (The Almighty) has been sealed for the majority of this arc and was only recently activated, so no, the arc hasn't suffered as a result of his OPness. Besides, he's only the main enemy. His own power doesn't affect the interactions between the Shinigami and his underlings unless he intervenes, which has been rare. Also, his power has different levels to it which isn't really explained in the excerpt you linked. The first level allows him to see the future, which lets him negate special abilities and gives him an upper hand in combat, a form of omniscience. The second level allows him to take control of anybody's ability and even use it against them, a form of omnipotence. The different levels are pretty interesting, since we know there's going to be one more level but we don't know what it will be, other than it might be related to omnipresence.  Secondly, he's literally God. His name is inspired by YHWH, the Hebrew name for God. I think if anybody is allowed to have God-mode, it's God.  This is just the level that we're at. Yhwach is the son of the Soul King, and he inherited his abilities. Now he's killed and absorbed the power of the Soul King, meaning he's at least as powerful as the Soul King, if not more powerful. Ichigo has the most potential of any being in the Bleach universe, so it makes sense for him to have to rise to the point of being able to take down the current most powerful being.  I really can only recommend reading the arc. There's a lot of important points that you're missing by reading the wiki."
bleach,394it1,Andygoesrawr,7,Tue Jun 9 06:07:41 2015 UTC,You tell him Andy. This arc had been amazing. It feels like it's really starting to pick up again too. Battles incoming.
bleach,394it1,unnusual_art,5,Tue Jun 9 06:37:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thorough input, it does make it sound a bit more interesting now.  And yeah his name literally meaning God flew over my head, but that does make sense. So I guess if it's a battle against God, it's okay to be that damn OP, haha."
bleach,394it1,Shunsui_for_CC,7,Tue Jun 9 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"Firstly, No. This arc is pretty good.  Secondly, He is the god! He has been named as a God ever since he was born. If he doesn't have a great power, why call him a God?"
bleach,394it1,Zil_v_a,5,Tue Jun 9 06:48:35 2015 UTC,"I had my bit on this topic  TL;DR - Bleach is not about who the villains are or even what they do. It's about what they represent and why does Ichigo fight against that. While it is yet too early to assume what is Yhwach in particular about, it is easy to assume that it has something to do with his force of nature.  Also, he was actually sorta not here most of the arc. He only shows up with yamamoto, Ichibei and then changes the looks of Royal Palace. Not much abusing his power."
bleach,394it1,HatoriHanzoSteel,3,Tue Jun 9 08:31:53 2015 UTC,"He IS god, he has almighty power. Also, I don't see how ANYONE can think the Stern Ritter or even the Quincies are boring. They're a race of people who have been extinct for over 200 years, and throughout the anime/manga, it was believed that only two were living. So when you find out there's HUNDREDS more, and at least 26 or so with UNIQUE abilities that don't REQUIRE bows, it's pretty interesting. We were exposed little by little, and then we got a HUGE punch in the balls face with all of these new characters.  Basically, an extinct species has resurfaced with unknown goals. How is this not interesting?"

bleach,394it1,reigun91,2,Tue Jun 9 17:54:44 2015 UTC,"The arc is very up and down in terms of enjoyment. For example: When Yhwach kills Yamamoto, and it looks like Byakuya will kick the bucket, the arc was awesome. But then, you have villains like Mask de Masculine, who is a complete fucking dope of a character. You also have things like when fights get off screened, the fact that Byakuya isn't dead and comes back even more op than before, which is a little corny. Or when Mayuri is am absolute boss against zombie Hitsugaya (not one of my fav moments but it was bad ass). Yhwach can be annoying but he is not the reeason why the arc has been considered bad. Although he had an Aizen momemt where he told he ochigo everything had gone according to his plans.   TL;DR: Catch up and decide for yourself."
bleach,394it1,richiegraine,2,Tue Jun 9 05:21:45 2015 UTC,He's super OP but in the end he would have to be in order for him to be the big bad that not even the guy that has literally been called the strongest all throughout the series can beat. But Kubo is gonna have to be really creative with how he loses now and give us plenty of explanation.

bleach,395eow,Zil_v_a,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:21:59 2015 UTC,"I would like to think of a Zanpakutou as a log of wood or a bar of iron - the 0 stage. Can be used on its own as a weapon (although probably much less dangerous).   Then, if I want to, I can remake it into a sword, or a hammer, or a mace... And then, I can choose to train with it to so that I have a more masterful control (in damaging the enemy, rather than actually wielding the weapon). +1 stage  Of course, this analogy stops at the fact that a Zanpakutou might not mortally wound it's Shinigami without good reason (if any), while my friendly bar of iron - as a sword or a hammer - can very well be used against me.  The -1 stage - that would be dependent on whether Yachiru is a Zanpakutou spirit herself.  As for clad-type Zanpakutou... Ikkaku and Renji have their clothing modified when they use Bankai, so whether that classifies as clad-type Zanpakutou, I do not know. But if they do, it would not necessarily refute what you said about them belonging ""nly to the shiningami that have highly emotional bond with their weapons and their cause."" Ikkaku and Renji train harder than anyone else anyway.  Of course, all this is just my opinion."
bleach,395eow,aizen6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:37:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't put out Renji, he did have a fair share of emotional fight in the Soul Society arc, twice as much in the manga as in the anime. If anything Ikkaku is the only one I would question, and I do admit I remember this part of the story a bit less clearly than the others."
bleach,395eow,aizen6,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"Ikkaku reminds me of Sasakibe in more ways than one. But he seems to have his own share of emotional conflicts, and he grew up as somewhat of a thug. His fight with Edrad Leones and Shishigawara come to mind."

I thought they were failed attempts to hollowfy souls. Then again, it is speculation. We have no for sure answer what happened to those souls. (Do we?)"
bleach,395eow,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"umm...The video states that if a person disappears but leaves their clothing behind then it didn't die but became unable to stay in the form of a human. They do not become reishi, they become something. The form itself would obviously be different based on what made them incapable to be human to being with.  I don't remember if this one was specified, but those people either turned into the hollow that squad 9 fights or been sucked into Aizens hongyoku."

Call me a grump, but they just bought those costumes so there's nothing special about them, even though they look very high quality everyone can just do that for a few bucks.  The other thing is the less nice one, but people should cosplay for who they look like instead of who they would like to look like. An impersonation is better when it's well-matched."
bleach,390a7c,Humble_Shopkeeper,4,Mon Jun 8 08:52:48 2015 UTC,Yep. This reminded me of the black Aizen dude in one of the older cons.

Even if you don't look the part I encourage you to come out to your local cons, they are loads of fun and no one cares how you look.  edit: Unless you're entering a cosplay contest ofc"
bleach,390a7c,Humble_Shopkeeper,17,Mon Jun 8 10:09:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of you, honestly.   Zil in the sense that just buying the costume and not personalizing it at all is kind of no fun, I mean anyone could do that. It's kind of a bummer to see fan spend hundreds of dollars on a costume that they do nothing with as far as aesthetics.  But at the same time, dressing up is about having fun and in a sense celebrating your love for an anime or a character. It doesn't matter how you look as long as the point gets across right?"
bleach,390a7c,Zil_v_a,6,Mon Jun 8 10:24:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, Cypress made an important point. I guess I immediately jumped at the idea ""yeah, that's an impersonation"". It's true that if you don't want to win contests and god knows what, but just fool around instead and have fun then you're welcome to cosplay anything. I wholeheartedly agree."
bleach,390a7c,itsuwaribito,3,Mon Jun 8 10:57:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how you look as long as the point gets across right?    That's the problem. Sometimes you have people dressing up as a character they look nothing like, and then not bothering to put in any effort to show that that's who they're supposed to be (wig/dye, accessories, props, etc). And then they get pissy when no one knows who they are. And that's no fun for anybody.  Tip for anyone: make the cosplay your own. Add in something unique/funny/stupid/etc. that would be (mostly) in character. Have fun with it.  On a related note, has anyone ever cosplayed Hinamori with Kyouka Suigetsu stabbed in their gut?"
bleach,390a7c,Humble_Shopkeeper,2,Mon Jun 8 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"When I cosplay bleach characters, I usually do females, but genderbend them. I also add my own little twists. I cosplayed Rukia Kuchki in a hollow form. (I called myself ""Ruriko"", also, I had white ass hair, so I figured I'd do a hollow form.)  However, regardless of what someone looks like, they can still cosplay anyone they wish. And when you say people don't try based on the color of their skin or body size, please notice how there is something wrong with every character in these pictures, so ""They aren't trying."" You can argue that some Ichigo's don't have bright enough hair, or aren't buff enough, and that the orihime could ""loose some weight"" to look more like her. Yeah, lose weight , dye your hair and work out ! That's REALLY trying, folks!  All in all, it doesn't matter, nothing does. Do what you want, have fun."

All Yhwach can do with that fragment is gain power from them after they die.   I don't believe Yhwach can use Auschwalen on them because they are not Quincy. With no Quincy powers, he doesn't have anything to really take from them. He may get some of their youth and experience, but that's probably it."

bleach,38zny0,aizen6,0,Mon Jun 8 10:03:19 2015 UTC,I always thought that Aizen wasn't actually confirmed one because he was asked. Yhwach didn't outright state that he was considered one like he did for Ichigo and Kenpachi. Either way we don't really have much information about this subject. Once/if(?) the other two (three?) get revealed we will probably learn more about it.
bleach,38zny0,autowikiabot,3,Mon Jun 8 10:15:42 2015 UTC,"I read it as Yhwach declaring Aizen-taichou to be a war potential, and asking him to join the Wandenreich, rather than asking him whether or not to be a war potential.  But judging by the way the plot is progressing, I doubt it's even important now. Yhwach has basically become Beerus the Destroyer, so war potential or not, Ichigo is the only one who's going to show him who's boss. And war potentials or not, nobody else is going to even be able to scratch him. That's how it stands as of now, sadly. T_T"
bleach,38wh36,__Arrowhead__,10,Sun Jun 7 12:25:34 2015 UTC,"First off, let me link you this.  It's the filler list for Bleach, I would strongly recommend not bothering watching any filler episodes.  It has put many of many friends off watching the show and they're not canon and can be entirely skipped.  Secondly, the showbox app has all the episodes in good quality with japanese voice and english subs, failing that you can also stream at bleachget.com"
bleach,38wh36,tackslock,2,Sun Jun 7 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"Even with me seeing the filler list, I decided to watch them all anyway, because I love Bleach. And the fillers aren't too bad, a little corny... but if you're feeling laidback and need something to pass time with, the Bleach fillers are pretty aiight."
bleach,38wh36,shundorbon,5,Sun Jun 7 15:50:24 2015 UTC,"I'll always advise against watching filler, a huge amount of the time the plot is terrible and essentially leads to nothing.  Pretty sure I'm still bitter about having to wait through 2 years of Baunto filler back when I was young(er).  By all means if you're interested in watching filler, then feel free but I always advise against it.  I cannot remember any filler being of above average quality, it stains the series for me."
bleach,38wh36,tackslock,8,Sun Jun 7 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"I cannot remember any filler being of above average quality, it stains the series for me.   Sounds like you stopped watching after the Bount arc, then. :P  I would never claim any of the filler to be on par with the canon material, but it gets better and better with each subsequent arc and, honestly, the last two aren't bad at all."
bleach,38wh36,Narissis,3,Sun Jun 7 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you stopped watching after the Bount arc, then. :P   Pretty much, I watched Bleach and Naruto side by side and suffered 2 years of filler from both.  The Naruto filler had some nice ideas but essentially turned them to garbage, now if I'm truly desperate for a fix while a show is in filler mode I'll just rewatch old episodes instead.  Adding onto that, what was that Zanpaktou filler arc like?  I didn't watch that either."
bleach,38wh36,tackslock,3,Sun Jun 7 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"A hell of a lot better than the Bount arc; a little bit weaker than the canon Fullbringer arc.  The designs for some of the Zanpakutou spirits are a little odd, and the way they act can sometimes do poor justice to the fact that they are weapons, but those are probably the biggest criticisms I could level against it. The villains are decently well-written and compelling enough, and apart from the exceptions I've just noted, most of the Zanpakutou spirits are very well-designed, to the point that even if you weren't told which blade they were, you would have no trouble at all figuring it out.  There's a popular rumour that Kubo personally assisted the anime production by doing the designs for the spirits, but I recall someone (probably andy) explaining that wasn't the case. But there was an interview quote floating around where he said that he was quite satisfied with them.  Anyway, it's worth a watch, I think. So is the one after it."
bleach,38wh36,Narissis,4,Sun Jun 7 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"Zanpakuto filler was meh, but the arc that came after Ichigo lost his powers was fucking awesome. The Kageroza arc or whatever his name was, the battles, the animation quality, THE FUCKING NUCLEAR GETSUGA TENSHO (yes, Ichigo charges a GT and ends up nuking a place)!!"
bleach,38wh36,angryspacemahreen,3,Sun Jun 7 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"I'm coming close to finishing a full rewatch.  Might be worth checking out the Zanpaktou filler, the whole concept of a Zanpaktou is something I've always found interesting so I'll give it a few episodes.  Will add the Kagezora arc too if you recommend it."
bleach,38wh36,tackslock,2,Sun Jun 7 16:51:47 2015 UTC,I'd honestly say the Zanpakuto Rebellion Arc is one of the best arcs regardless if it's filler. The opening for the Reigai Uprising Arc was pretty badass as well. Both are the only good filler arcs really imo.
bleach,38wh36,airstorm747,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:21:47 2015 UTC,I though that most people here thought the Zanpakuto Alternate Tales Arc was the best arc in general...
bleach,38wh36,airstorm747,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"It was cringy as fuck, had shitty plot and writing, people only liked it because we got to see zanpakutos. The battles weren't really good either."
bleach,38wh36,angryspacemahreen,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"Well, to each their own. I liked it for other reasons, I could care less about actually seeing the Zanpakuto Spirits but what I found interesting was the substance of the spirits: It's relationship with it's master or other characters, the character designs, it's moves being outleted differently, etc..   I do agree with the generic plot, I felt Muramasa's intentions should've ust stayed at ""letting the Zanpakuto free"" so we could cut off the shitty latter half of the arc with Koga and all. And yeah, the melodramatic moments were kinda cringy honestly (ie - Rukia and Sode no Shyo...)  Also opening 11 was very cool."
bleach,38wh36,airstorm747,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:31:30 2015 UTC,Kubo has used the fillers to reveal certain things. I know that's how we found out what Hanataro's zanpakuto ability was.
bleach,38wh36,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,2,Sun Jun 7 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I think only the Bount Arc and Captain Amagai aren't worth of watching. The rest of the fillers are ok IMO.  Late Anime"

So maybe imagine a twin set of bigass sickles that have ridiculous range+reach (not Gin bankai level though). not that imaginative I know, but that's really what I think Shuhei's would be like given his shikai+fighting style"
bleach,38vfbj,ArysOakheart,3,Sun Jun 7 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'm getting  bored of these pure power bankais that do nothing. Battles become boring and very one-sided. Where is all the strategy and shit, where's all the ""use your bankai's ability"" crap?"

bleach,38vfbj,caprexy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:49:30 2015 UTC,That fit thrown out a long time ago.   9/10 winning depends on your power level.
bleach,38vfbj,Temperatia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:38:36 2015 UTC,"That's why SS arc was better. It still had its occasional ""I MUST PROTECT MY FRIENDS"" powerup bullshit, but most of the time shikai and bankai powers actually had a meaning.   I'm sure Kubo could have done better. Perhaps he deliberately went for the power routine because teenagers like it more?"
bleach,38vfbj,angryspacemahreen,2,Mon Jun 8 08:09:56 2015 UTC,"No, everything has always been about power level. The power levels just weren't clear in the past.   Since day 1 Aizen had been picking out opponents for Ichigo that were at the same power level and within his ability to defeat. If Ichigo hadn't beaten Zaraki first, then he wouldn't be capable of making the jump necessary to beat Byakuya.   Ichigo's power level dropped at the beginning of the Arrancar arc. If that hadn't happened, Aizen probably would have had to start him out fighting Ulquiorra and Barragan instead of letting him fight Grimmjow."
bleach,38vfbj,Temperatia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:44:35 2015 UTC,"And when did his power level ""drop""? There's nothing in the story per sé that explains why his power level ""dropped"" as the Arrancars started invading."
bleach,38vfbj,angryspacemahreen,2,Mon Jun 8 09:38:33 2015 UTC,"Well, if you were paying close attention, you'd notice that Ichigo was able to cut Yammy at the beginning of the arc, but then couldn't cut through any of the other Espada easily during the arc.   Yammy's Hierro is the second hardest after Nnoitora. So, it doesn't make sense that Ichigo could cut him and no one else if his power level was the same.   Other than that, it's weird that Ichigo was having trouble with the Espada at all. He beat Zaraki without even using his Bankai. So, how is it that Zaraki can fodderize Nnoitora by just fighting with two hands, but Ichigo needed to use his mask on top of his Bankai (then get another power up during his fight) to beat Grimmjow.  Everything is spoonfed to the reader, but you can see there's something going on with Ichigo's power level."
bleach,38vfbj,Temperatia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:20:49 2015 UTC,"No no no no no. You've got it all wrong.  First of all, both Nnotoira and Yammy CLAIM that they have the strongest hierro. Nnotoria might be right, but Yammy is bullshitting, he's just arrogant as hell, as seen with his fights  Now, about Zaraki. Did you know that Zangetsu was assisting Ichigo with Blut Vene to close his wound, and Blut Arterie to defeat Zaraki? That's the only reason Ichigo was able to defeat Zaraki. Quincy techniques.  Also, ranks do not fully state the Espada's power as far as we have seen. This was said by Grimmjow and confirmed afterwards anyway."
bleach,38vfbj,angryspacemahreen,2,Mon Jun 8 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"If it's stated as a plainly in the databook, then it's a fact, not a claim.  Ichigo was stronger than Zaraki with just Blut Vene being used. He needed Blut Arterie to get another boost after the eyepatch came off, but before that he was stronger than Zaraki. Then, if Zaraki can cut Nnoitora with his eyepatch on, Ichigo should be able to cut Nnoitora while using Bankai. Regardless of whether or not he is tired. Besides that, Ichigo's Bankai should have been able to easily cut the other Espada if Zaraki and him were at a level where they could get through Nnoitora's Hierro. That still doesn't add up.  Now, why would you chose to believe Grimmjow's comment about their numbers rather than Ulquiorra saying that his number 4 meant that there were still three other Espada stronger than him? You're cherry picking, aren't you?"

bleach,38ruci,kingofdabz,2,Sat Jun 6 23:46:02 2015 UTC,Dragonball is so iconic and legendary that things that happened within it have become story tropes to be used in future Manga for generations to come. It paved the way and set the tone for a lot of other battle Manga that came after it. I think it's quite awesome
bleach,38ruci,soenottelling,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you have to realize that it's not like kubo pulled these stereotype  Characters out of thin air.  Sometimes the writers/artists, upon seeing how close they made them to others before them, make then even more similar in little tongue in cheek sort of ways (like the gold aura of which you speak).  Sometimes they own up to it, mostly they just play coy about the whole thing...but it certainly happens."

Not necessarily in Bleach but in Fairy Tail the filler episode like when they did a body switch and they didn't change back.

bleach,38ubpv,TrixoftheTrade,16,Sat Jun 6 22:20:25 2015 UTC,Isn't this basically... confirmed?
bleach,38ubpv,welcometomoonside,7,Sat Jun 6 22:44:59 2015 UTC,"Just like how ""The Strength"" and ""The Understand"" were basically confirmed.  It's obvious he has some sort of balancing ability, but that doesn't mean it's his entire ability. Personally I like the idea of The Blood, and the balancing is him shifting his power between attack and defense, to a level far beyond Arterie and Vene."
bleach,38ubpv,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:14:16 2015 UTC,"The Understand? What? Who is ""The Understand"" ? I think you mean ""Underbelly"" ?"
bleach,38ubpv,Andygoesrawr,2,Tue Jun 9 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. I'm saying that it was generally understood that his Schrift was The Understand because of his comment about being able to defeat Renji after observing him. Even after we got his true Schrift, observing and understanding is still part of his ability even though the main aspect is finding and attacking weak points.  The same happened with The Superstar. Everyone thought it was The Strength because it just made sense. It was illogical for anyone to think otherwise... and then we got The Superstar.  The point is that even though balancing is clearly a major part of Haschwalth's ability, it's not necessarily The Balance."
bleach,38ubpv,DatBankai,0,Tue Jun 9 01:58:18 2015 UTC,Getting a PS4 and Bloodborne today... fear the old blood It'd be interesting if Hashbrown's abilities were based around blood.
bleach,38ubpv,Sirocco_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:45:01 2015 UTC,HELL YES. It would be like Crona from Soul Eater.
bleach,38ubpv,Alluka-,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"I thought about this, but I wasn't completely sure on what it would be. It can't be a balance between good and evil (They're both ""Evil"") But maybe a balance in power? I mean between all the quincies, and maybe just between Ywach and himself. If it was all the Quincie's, their abilities would be at the same level (presumably.) And if it was just him and Ywach, then he has some SERIOUS power."
bleach,38ubpv,Zil_v_a,7,Sat Jun 6 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"The meaning behind Balance is kind of tricky to explain unless you already understand it. I guess it can be seen as his ability to change the outcomes of events if the ""scales"" are heavily tipped one way or the other, or not at all, so to speak. Don't forget nothing is actually confirmed yet, so we will probably get explanations and all that when the time comes.  Chapter 559, pages 3-4 He mentions how the battle was even so it was his role to make the tide of battle favor the Quincies. (Scales are even so by taking out Shunsui, they would start tilting)  Chapter 559, pages 13-17 He is easily able to cut through Cang's ""Iron"" after mentioning his ""power."" (Cang's good fortune of surviving was balanced with his unfortunate demise)  Chapter 565, page 11 This one is a bit tricky. He basically maintains the balance of power by standing in for Yhwach. There could be more to it since we don't really have that much information yet."
bleach,38ubpv,Alluka-,3,Sat Jun 6 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with it is that it seems hypocritical. The goal of quincies is to destroy the thing responsible for balance in the whole universe, and yet their second best would base his power on the same concept?   There is that page where he just shows us the scales, that's the biggest bit that makes you believe it could be a thing. It's also however arbitrary as well. Some sort of ""you did something successfully so now I will"". It feels a bit undefined."
bleach,38ubpv,doodleysquat,4,Sat Jun 6 23:14:49 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is we don't really know the true motivation of Yhwach and the Quincy. We know bits and pieces of what they've done and some brief history about them but that's it. If we get a flashback arc soon it will probably explain a lot of unanswered questions.  I mean yeah it's possible Haschwalth's Schrift could be X, Y or Z (not literally, different variables) but since there are no facts we're left to theorize for now. There are some hints leading to a few possibilities as many have stated but it's impossible to know until we're outright told. Yhwach and Haschwalth are the most mysterious Quincy at the moment so we have to wait it out."

bleach,38ubpv,Nepycros,3,Sun Jun 7 07:34:50 2015 UTC,My personal theory will be that he turns on Ywach. Ywach is obviously messing up the balance of things and if Hashwalth is anything like the other sternritter whos power dictates their personality than he'll turn on Ywach to stop him from messing up the balance.
bleach,38ubpv,TrentVictus,2,Sat Jun 6 22:45:54 2015 UTC,Does this explain his behavior when judging Cang Du and BG9?

I think his ability makes it so the same thing can't happen twice in any given situation or moment.  I just made a thread about this now and didn't see yours so I apologize haha.   But basically, remember when he executed Cang du? He couldn't pierce him at first because of Cang Du's own schrift ability. Then he said ""do you see the scales tipping in my favor now?"" And a scale was pictured above his head. Then he made the exact same strike on the exact same part of Cang Du's body and it killed him. So I think it makes it so the same thing can't happen twice. It's why Cang Du's schrift didn't work and why ichigo's bankai was broken with ease, I think"
bleach,38ubpv,maytagem,0,Thu Jun 11 00:55:12 2015 UTC,The Belief - the more he is assured in the greatness of Yhwach the more powerful he is. Shake his religious beliefs and he falls flat.  That's what I'm betting on for a while now.

bleach,38uklz,FoxyZach,8,Sat Jun 6 23:20:32 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% sure but I think he made everything he sells himself. Rukia knew about it because Kisuke approached and offered her a gigai. When Renji and Byakuya showed up they said she was missing which means they had no idea where she was.
bleach,38uklz,Alluka-,5,Sat Jun 6 23:41:56 2015 UTC,"Urahara probably sells human goods out of his shop. He still has contacts with Soul Society and Yoruichi is able to travel to Soul Society still.

bleach,38uklz,Temperatia,2,Sun Jun 7 00:57:17 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, Kisuke was banished from SS, but later (kinda) forgiven but not really.

(most likely)  In a perfect world, the anime won't be adapted until the manga is near it's end so no fillers. Alternatively, they can do a reboot to buy time for the manga to get closer to ending.

A few chapters ago Yhwach addressed Haschwalth as his son while ignoring the other quincy around them. He recognizes Haschwalth as a ""true"" heir, which leads towards the body swap theory for Uryuu.  Haschwalth makes sense as the balance, as he described himself as the other balance scale when Yhwach is asleep. These latest chapters show that Yhwach may go into another sleep again, therefore allowing Haschwalth to takeover and give him a chance to show his schrift."

For example, water can be a good thing to drink, but everyone knows if you drink too much water in a short amount of time, you're basically drowning yourself/ something called water poisoning (actual thing) so basically, he can make the lethal amount of water consumption (say 2 gallons in 1 minute) be something like a glass of water.

Discounting Ywach and Hashbrowns, of course...  Perkytits McParkinggarage and X-man both have powers that allow them to one-shot most Quincy - Cang Du's Iron won't help him defend, and if he can't survive it very few other quincies can. Askin with his endurance will last a lot longer than most, but can't do anything vs some of the more OP powers. The Wind could do quite well, but the two I mentioned above are far too powerful...  What people are forgetting is Gremmy created a Quincy using his power. While Bambi is trying to blow people up and X-man and Perkytits are obliterating everyone in sight, Gremmy isn't even in danger. His powers allow him the ultimate defence in creating Black Holes and shields as he wants, gives him the ability to hide and turn himself invisible, and summon any number of powerful attacks.   X-man and Perkytits will OHKO pretty much whoever they want. Gisele and Pepe can turn fights to their advantage but lack any useful power for the one-on-ones, and Askin and Windy have very useful abilities. But Gremmy's ability is one of the most broken powers in Bleach - no mean feat when we have Yukio, Kira and Tsukishima - and short of facing someone as ridiculous as Kenpachi, who cut a meteor and space to beat Gremmy, nobody else stands a chance..."

However, If you look at each one independently you can find how they can each be devastating. For example, Pernida Parnkgjas. (The Compulsory.) He can cause things to collapse in on themselves; and we have no idea as to how far he can go. Askin has a pretty OP ability as well, which can be dangerous. Along with others such as Lloyd/Royd and As Nodt. So for me, here are three separate ones.  In terms of POWER (Ywach)  In terms of Special powers/abilities (Askin)  And in terms of Psychological strength, It is a tie between As Nodt and Berenice Gabrielle."

bleach,38r5q8,Polygon_809,4,Mon Jun 8 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"We haven't had an explanation of Quincy's spirit weapons.  I guess it is because, as his powers increase, the strength and shape of the spirit bow he can create changes as well.   Back in HM, Chad unlocked his shield arm, but afterwards was still seen using his right arm with the spike on the top and no shield.  So, I believe Uryu showed two different bows in the Lost Agent arc because he was right at the cusp of power necessary to activate his smaller bow, while still being able to make his weaker, spider web bow."

bleach,38t82l,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"That's a continuity thing. They probably asked Kubo what his powers are supposed to be. Otherwise He would bury them alive. It's more of filler being attached to the planned plot rather than the plot adapting fillers into canon.   There are some instances of Kubo adapting the filler plotline, I believe there was a flashback recently to Ichigo being somewhere he only managed to go to in a movie or a filler. But we aren't really supposed to take fillers in consideration until Kubo just says ""yeah, that's cannon now.""."
bleach,38t82l,Zil_v_a,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"No, Sasakibe having a lightning zanpakutō comes from understanding the kanji used in his sword name, not from any special inside info from Kubo. I remember Andygoesrawr noting that Gonryōmaru 厳霊丸 is normally translated to ""spirit of majesty"", but can also be read as ""lightning"". It's an older, less commonly used reading, but it's enough to tip the animators off about Sasakibe's true powers.  Kubo has always given varying amounts of input for the movies, but that doesn't make the fillers or movies canon. Studio Pierrot is not obligated to follow through on Kubo's ideas, or even implement them the way Kubo has in mind. Hell exists in Bleach, but Hell as depicted in the Hellverse movie is not canon, because Kubo said Studio Pierrot discarded all the ideas he gave them."

Urahara and Jushiro had to be involved with the initial creation along with many other shinigami who would of received power and instantly begun taking care of it.   I believe the King could be the remaining Quincies but at the same time I get the feeling he is the other half of Yhwach, the bright white light opposite to the black being, rather than giving his soul to others the King is able to gather those souls and stop them from being removed thus keeping the balance.  I wonder how important the Fullbring arc will be in the deciding of the new King. Ginjo and a couple Fullbringers have powers that could be beneficial to a being that relies on time."

bleach,38mxwg,xViralx,25,Fri Jun 5 06:44:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe he is the real Yhwach. Letting everyone he knows believe he is 2nd. While all the time the current ""Yhwach"" is just an illusion."
bleach,38mxwg,Jiscold,10,Fri Jun 5 10:51:51 2015 UTC,"I like this idea but we've seen what Yhwach looked like when he was younger. I think Zangetsu even admitted he is a clone of him. Though they could use some weird techniques to alter appearance. It's been done before with one of the Quincy twins. Additionally, the last Soul King became a popsicle. I wouldn't think Yhwach would want to do the same to himself. You might be on to something here.."
bleach,38mxwg,SometimesY,8,Fri Jun 5 14:10:17 2015 UTC,That's what got me on this train of thought in the first place. Why would Yhwach put himself in a position that can be sealed.
bleach,38mxwg,Jiscold,8,Fri Jun 5 14:13:11 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if Yhwach was the final boss. His entire build up has been done in a way that makes it seem like he won't be, at least from my point of view. In a weird way it would be almost too boring if he was."
bleach,38mxwg,godhaspurpledreads,2,Fri Jun 5 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"There's always the possibility that Ichibē Hyōsube (monk) will be the final villain. He and squad zero were looking v v shady,"
bleach,38mxwg,jkvng,6,Sat Jun 6 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"true. maybe he'll remember he has other characters.   Personally though. I think it'll be Aizen. Yhwach and Aizen (and ichigo) are at a point where they are basically invincible. So I don't think it'll be strength that wins but intelligence/strategy. So I feel final boss will be Aizen vs Ichigo/Urahara or something. Some guy had a theory that Urahara will end up as final boss and that kinda got me excited, due to the moves necessary to make that viable i think if written well could be awesome. I think a final fight between Aizen and Urahara, and Ichigo/Grim/Kenpachi/Shunsui (all bankai/final released) vs Quincy triforce (Yhwach/Urya/Haschwalth) would be my OTP lol"
bleach,38mxwg,godhaspurpledreads,2,Sat Jun 6 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"Ah I didn't see your comment I'm sorry!  We know that Kubo likes to pull last minute character changes that are in line with previous hints. I think that Ichibe will stand as the final villain, something like Ichigo spares Yhwach and right after Ichibei and the rest of Squad zero jumps to kill him. Remember, Ichibe is only a step behind Yhwach, he is the strongest shinigami, and he revived himself just with Ichigo saying his name (and a lot of plot machinery). This would be in line with a lot of other Shounen mangas...but Bleach is also relatively unpredictable.   I can't see Aizen being a final final villain simply because it was that way for so much of the manga. He and Urahara both define their ideologies around utilitarianism so outright betrayal doesn't seem to serve them any justice. They want to advance their agenda but from what we've seen, defeating quincies takes the largest precedent.   Of course there will some kind of final battle, but Uryu will most definitely switch sides by the end. Something will happen like with Bazz B where he intends to kill the man who murdered his mother, and I have a feeling that his father, Ryuken, will be making a return with Isshin.   Anyways, we'll have to see. I would love it if this happened, I would love it even more if Kubo surprised us."
bleach,38mxwg,jkvng,2,Fri Jun 26 08:07:38 2015 UTC,"no worries bruv.   and very true. the leaders of the shinigami seem to have a dogmatic / religious fanaticm to them. So things could go as you say with Ichibei. Though it will ring similar to the soul society arc and Yamamoto. or Yamamoto in general, dude was kinda a hardass haha.   I also believe you're right and Uryu switches sides, which is boring but also fair, as given what we know of him, his joining that side to begin with doesnt fit well anyway. I want a different reason than secret revenge aka the Bazz B. I'm hoping Kubo gave us Bazz B being a double agent storyline cause he has something else in mind for Uryu.   I'm all for Team Dad-Force.   And after reading your thoughts, you are right about Aizen and Urahara. It would be broken recordy for Aizen to end up as final villian. But he is my favorite character so kinda want him to come out on top.   Either way the Haschwalth reveal from last two chapters seems like it'll play a big part. it'll prob be the dues ex machina that helps them beat Yhwach since he basically invincible right now. maybe he runs like Odin and has to sleep after exerting himself to for long and during the power transfer period both have no powers for a split second and you get uryu stabbing hashbrowns and ichigo stabbing yhwach. hope this doesnt happen hahah"
bleach,38mxwg,godhaspurpledreads,2,Fri Jun 26 09:19:43 2015 UTC,"I think everything it up to interpretation right now. After all, in total this will be something like a two and a half - three year long arc.   I can never see Aizen being a complete protagonist but maybe something like Orochimaru where Seretai leaves him to his own machinations. OR, he becomes the Soul King's replacement (which makes sense considering how strong he is). Also, other people have hypothesized that the rest of the Soul King's limbs may come to play in regards to the future stability of soul society.   Oh well, we'll just have to see.

bleach,38mxwg,SgtLittlebottom,4,Fri Jun 5 13:37:20 2015 UTC,"happy cake day!

Ywach will give Uryu all of his godlike powers after Ichigo and the gang do some shit to him that causes his death, and then he will take over as the final villain, brainwashed and mad with uncontrollable power. Ichigo will beat the shit out of him, and the evil out of him, and everything will go back to normal. Then Yachiru will finally appear, 10 years older, and Unohana will revive, and Isane, Nemu, Rukia, Rukia's older sister, Orihime, Yuzu, Ururu, etc, and they'll all have the biggest fucking orgy on top of Ukitake's dying body."

bleach,38mxwg,Zil_v_a,4,Fri Jun 5 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"I really think the link comes from his power. I theorized that he stands as ""B"" of ""Belief"". Meaning the more he trusts and believes in Yhwach the stronger he is. Also makes him a great target for team vengeance.  I'm pretty sure that Yhwach is the final villain, simply because this is the final arc. Otherwise I would be assured that there's a lot to come."
bleach,38mxwg,jdonnel,6,Fri Jun 5 09:25:42 2015 UTC,"I thought it was for balance., like he brings balance to all things.

And the guy says something about having invincible skin, then haschwalt says something to the tune of can to feel it the scales are tipping, with a goaded pictures of scales behind him.  Then the sword gets through and kills the Quincy."
bleach,38mxwg,Zil_v_a,3,Fri Jun 5 13:41:31 2015 UTC,This is also very possible and a common opinion on this reddit.
bleach,38mxwg,jdonnel,2,Fri Jun 5 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't read any discussion on it, but I think it may be more than just balance.  I think it could be an Anikin Skywalker type thing.  A check and balance for the Quincy for says but possibly all realms.  We know the war started because the quincies we offing too many hollows and the shinagami had to keep the souls flowing in order to keep things correct.  The ""B"" is here for this reign to keep that from happening.  Also to keep any Quincy from rising up and challenging the ruler."
bleach,38mxwg,Zil_v_a,2,Fri Jun 5 20:13:10 2015 UTC,"It's no longer assured that the war was because of hollows getting exterminated. It's very possible that they murdered hollows as a message of their hatred towards the Soul King. From what we can understand, they've been specifically created to overthrow him. Destroying the balance he needed so badly sounds like quiet the basic move to preform. Well, at least in my understanding. It's all kinda hard for me since I very much can't put Soken anywhere and make sense out of it."

As Zil_v_a pointed out though a lot of these characters are still lacking their bankai so these are just hypotheticals for now."
bleach,38n9ft,TiggerTheTiger1999,8,Fri Jun 5 11:19:33 2015 UTC,Who could beat Aizen other then Yamamoto? Do you really think their i s that big of a difference in captain power? He absolutely destroyed Komamura
bleach,38n9ft,Sandisk4gb4,2,Fri Jun 5 13:59:24 2015 UTC,"I've always seen Komamura as one of the weakest captains. He's got a badass Bankai and he's a cool guy but against any other captain I presumed he'd lose.   Against Aizen I think speed is the key. If he can't release then he's lost, if he can then chances are he's won.  Gin gave it a good shot and with his speed stats coupled with the poison blade you have to reason he would have more than a chance against pre-hogyoku Aizen.  With speed (and assassination skill) in mind I'd back Yoruichi, but then I'm bias on that count."
bleach,38n9ft,TiggerTheTiger1999,6,Fri Jun 5 14:53:43 2015 UTC,I'm the biggest Gin fan in the world(not fanboy) and i can say with utter certainty that he has no chance with Aizen.
bleach,38n9ft,zGhostWolf,5,Sat Jun 6 05:22:31 2015 UTC,"Gin caught him off guard. If it was a battle, gin would get reked. About speed, just look at Aizen's battle stats, he is crazy fast"
bleach,38n9ft,zGhostWolf,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:46:41 2015 UTC,true but he's no mental slouch either so it's not impossible that gin could've found an opening during a fight. Plus a speedy barrage of attacks would hinder Aizen's ability to release his zanpakuto
bleach,38n9ft,TiggerTheTiger1999,2,Fri Jun 5 16:44:30 2015 UTC,did you forget that aizen could get to ichigo while hi didnt even notice him? And ichigo should be preatty fast himself..

bleach,38n9ft,Freddichio,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:05:59 2015 UTC,alas we'll never know. I wish we'd had more time to observe his skills.
bleach,38n9ft,Freddichio,2,Fri Jun 5 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way, ichigo, when he released bankai, was fighting at a level slightly below Byakuya (considered high level captain) who commented on his immense speed and power. This Ichigo was then stopped by a single one of Aizen's fingers without any effort. Yes  they are all more powerful now, but this should give some prospective. Also, since when does Aizen need time to release his Blade? In his words ""When do you think I was not using kyoka suigetsu"""
bleach,38n9ft,Zil_v_a,0,Fri Jun 5 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"Byakuya, before RR powerup, was not high level. He wasn't even close.  Shunsui, Ukitake, Shinji/Gin, Kenpachi and Unohana are far above him. Yama/Aizen are far above him. Hell, I'd argue Soifon stood a good chance with her Bankai...  This is why I loathe the character of Byakuya - Kubo loves him so will keep giving him powerups far beyond what he deserves. His power is useful, his Reitsu strong. But some of the captains are absolute monsters and Byakuya isn't one of them. He's a middling captain, stronger than the likes of Maryui and Histugaya but still not able to match the veterans or Kenpachi. The boost the Visored's masks give them could realistically put them ahead as well if their masks weren't now in the Kubo room of forgotten objects. His noble stand-my-ground fighting style means Maryui's poison would wreck him, Gin (and possibly Soifon) could OHKO him. He can't match Kenpachi in strength or endurance. He isn't smart enough to hold off Shunsui or Urahara.  He's just bland, and given far too much screentime IMHO."
bleach,38n9ft,Gatlinbeach,5,Sat Jun 6 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I'm no fanboy of him, but you have absolutely no evidence as to him being weaker. Feat wise, Hitsugaya is way stronger then you give him credit, via power scaling, he is way above pre-dangai visard ichigo. Also, as much as people chalk it up to plot, Kenpachi WAS defeated by Shikai Ichigo. Ya, he is a bland captain, but he is stronger than you are saying, plus his bankai is crazy powerful.  Plus, really? Soi Fon? I mean, she is no weakling, but I personally rank her around Komumura"
bleach,38n9ft,Zil_v_a,0,Sat Jun 6 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the way I see it, for Byakuya there was no point of him being made out to be weak. But you then look at how strong the other captains I mentioned are: Ukitake/Shunsui could spar with Yamamoto semi-seriously. Unohana is repeatedly hinted to me a major badass. and as for Kenpachi, while he was beaten by Shikai Ichigo (with help from Blut), he gets stronger with every single battle. He was quite a bit stronger in Hueco Mundo than he was in SS - his Kendo being one example. Soifon is quite a bit weaker than most captains, it's true, but her 2-hit KO is no joke, and her Bankai being a giant missile is powerful. Byakuya managed to just about beat the weakest arrancar. Shunsui beat Starkk without even going Bankai.  Even though Senbonsakura is powerful as hell, Byakuya isn't a great fighter compared to the others. He's far more likely to stand there and be hit by abilities and relying on his endurance - see his fight with Zommari or As Nodt - than dodging and countering.  So, out of curiousity, which captains would you say he's waeker than? Taking the Gotei 13 as Yama, Soi-Fon, Kenpachi, Hitsugaya, Shunsui, Ukitake, Maryui, Komamura, Byakuya, Unohana, Shinji, Kensei and Rose."
bleach,38n9ft,KingBliz,12,Sat Jun 6 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"Aizen, Urahara or Shunsui.  Not only are these three ridiculously strong, despite having only shown Shikai, they are also underhanded. None of them are above lying, cheating or attacking during monologues.    Shinji could also be one to add as well as between being visored and his mind-altering Shikai he could do some damage.  It won't be Kenpachi or Byakuya. The whole 'stand and fight' philosophy will get them killed/exposed to abilities. Gin will blitz them. Maryui will poison them. Kensei will esplode them. They will lose."
bleach,38n9ft,majormay,3,Fri Jun 5 11:45:22 2015 UTC,Shunsui is a good shout as he seems to be a well rounded fighter as well as a strong captain.   Unahara for me is still a possibility: her battle data is nearly 100 across the board and I still hold onto the fact she was killed by plot after becoming rusty by training in a completely different discipline. (which could also be useful against enemies such as Mayuri). Imagine her with a Tsunade style 'Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique' buff. So much lost potential!
bleach,38n9ft,KingBliz,7,Fri Jun 5 11:57:26 2015 UTC,It's hard to say when we don't know half the bankais. I actually don't think Kenpachi would land at the top. It would be determined based on who does he get to fight. Until he comes up against someone who screws with your mind too much he loses. Maybe even shinji could turn him off. A good game from Shinsui would also be trouble.
bleach,38n9ft,mostafasalah,4,Fri Jun 5 09:20:29 2015 UTC,true as I was typing I was trying to think of a way around bankais. I considered saying purely reiatsu levels? I thought this lends itself to certain characters that wouldn't necessarily win a fight as well though.  Also I counted Unohana with the kenpachi/top comment as in her prime I think she could go toe to toe with any captain we've seen.
bleach,38n9ft,Freddichio,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:26:26 2015 UTC,I think he'd be able to do pretty much the same shit against Shinji as he did when the lights got turned out on him. Wait for the cut then kill.
bleach,38n9ft,c9IceCream,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:00:17 2015 UTC,"In my opinion that was a gigantic plot hole. I mean, Tosen should just cut him in a vital spot. Stab in the head or the heart.

bleach,38n9ft,Gatlinbeach,11,Thu Jun 11 11:16:27 2015 UTC,"Mayuri is a dark horse. He has impressed me in every fight bar being plot raped by uryuu, his he is one of the few people that has a shikai more impressive than a bankai to me(someone like kenpachi who likes being cut up would think twice) although Gin is my Favourite character, Mayuri cant be overlooked(which he often does by the fans), his fight against zombiegaya kind of opened peoples eyes to his skill.   I would like to say Ukitake is dead but has Kubo ever killed off a main captain class character without a bankai reveal?(even retsu who never fought in the series before zaraki got one)  I will omit yama for obvious reasons but   Retsu(she is the best sword fighter in the 13) Kyoraku(he plays dirty to get the win) Isshin(middle finger of doom) Mayuri  My top 4  Would like to see Ginrei in a fight"
bleach,38n9ft,EspadaPrimera,6,Fri Jun 5 10:54:22 2015 UTC,"If Mayuri got prep time before every fight, I would say he definitely wins. Just because his fighting style comes from knowing his opponent and being 3 steps ahead. He might not even need the prep time because he has probably been studying the Gotei 13 the entire time he's been there, but I would definitely say he has a giant shot at beating everyone."
bleach,38n9ft,KaiserNova123,4,Fri Jun 5 14:43:46 2015 UTC,"I literally just finished this video before reading your comment and was thinking how Mayuri and Urahara have very similar fighting approaches (with the 'always one step ahead, I'm just hear to observe' attitude) and both haven't been given enough time to shine in brawls where their power is the real test not their plan. (inb4 Keikaku)"
bleach,38n9ft,Rocksbury,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:17:14 2015 UTC,"But we know that urahara is a more that capable fighter as he was promoted from division 2 (which specialise in assassination) I'm pretty sure that with the exception of the kenpachis that during the captain proficiency exam that candidates are examined on their sword combat skills too, mayuri just doesn't exert himself using sword combat as he just doesn't need to to win a fight, he is Aizen level intelligent"
bleach,38n9ft,zGhostWolf,5,Thu Jun 11 08:38:40 2015 UTC,Too bad he's shit tier when it comes to physical confrontation so if everything doesn't go according to keikaku he's pretty much screwed.
bleach,38n9ft,Rocksbury,2,Fri Jun 5 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"Mhm - I can't see him beating Urahara, Aizen or Shunsui, for instance. The gambit pileup will commence, but regardless of who's ahead by half a step the sheer power difference will be too much. I don't think Maryui is smarter than Urahara, but even if he is it's not by much. On the other hand in terms of combat ability Urahara far surpasses him..."
bleach,38n9ft,zGhostWolf,2,Sat Jun 6 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"SuiFon is the fastest shinigami i the soul society (this was stated while yoruichi and urahara were living outside the soul society) . She would destroy this tournament with her shikai with a few exceptions like Yama and Aizen.  We dont know how strong shunsui and urahara are yet, but Urahara has shown insane speed. I put his speed equal to Yoruichi.  Anyone fast enough or OP enough to handle SoiFon is above her.. Anyone who isnt gets insta killed by her.  Yama, Aizen, Urahara, Yoruichi make the top 4.  Sui Fon kills the rest.  Yama and Aizen battle for top spot"
bleach,38kuhk,noneandtheless,35,Thu Jun 4 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"They didn't release him out of the chair. He's still sitting out there, with keys in the possession of Shinsui.  He was not taken to the palace since he could just take over the king's seat and then we lose.  He was not allowed into the ""teleport base"" or anywhere near the doors since the last time he showed up near them, a bit of his reiatsu was enough to destabilize and crumble them.  I believe the idea is that in case they lose, Shinsui will take the keys out of his chest and either send someone with them, or just drop them down and allow Aizen to go wild with the assumption that he will make future less of a hell than Yhwach."

bleach,38n7fh,HatoriHanzoSteel,3,Fri Jun 5 08:33:53 2015 UTC,"Well, it is possible that Gremmy could know Soken. Maybe our grandpa actually had the letter V, but lost it when he left sternritters.   But then again, I highly doubt that Soken knew anything about the sternritters. The idea of peace he was proposing was just impossible given the very nature of the organisation. He acted more as if the role of Quincy would be to hunt down hollows, not destroy the soul king."
bleach,38n7fh,Zil_v_a,6,Fri Jun 5 09:22:54 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it was the original purpose of Yhwach? Yhwach only wanted to destroy the hollows but it was screwing the balance so the SK gave orders to exterminate quincies. After the extermination, Yhwach wants revenge on SK.  Soken was the last one to carry the original wish of Yhwach? Sounds good to me"
bleach,38n7fh,Shunsui_for_CC,2,Fri Jun 5 10:08:46 2015 UTC,"It's even more complicated when we don't know where to put Soken in the timeline. I mean... we know he trained Uryu when he was a kid. But the present batch of Quincy looks like it has been around pretty long when Soken didn't demonstrate any inhuman lifespan. It's almost like they're as different as Shinigami to Hollow.  Soken was also a peace-loving man. He probably didn't want anything to do with the Wandenreich. I remember vaguely, something about Soken ""rejecting the progress made by the Quincy."""

Kenpachi and Mayuri are making death glares at each other, Ikkaku and Yumichika are about to walk off without them, Hanatorou is pissing himself,  and Nemu's just like ""meh...whatever"". The whole exchange between them was pretty hysterical. Praise King Grimmjow, a true badass through and through! Not letting anyone slow him down! Though I would like Ichigo's group to meet up with Rukia and Renji at least at some point.  Askin's reaction at Grimmjow immediately crashing down upon him, cutting him off mid monologue, and destroying the building he's on with his fist was great!  Something's just dawned on me....where the hell is Aizen? All the character reactions and interactions have been top notch lately. Good work Kubo. I'm fairly certain if Bazz-B and crew try and take on Hashbrowns and Jewbacca by themselves, they're going to do nothing be get destroyed.....Hard.   Looks like the first bout next week will be Ichigo's crew vs Askin with a side of Bazz-B and crew being rekt by Hashbrowns! Finally we're getting to the good stuff!"

And don't forget we still have Riruka and Yukio hanging around, and Ginjo and Tsukishima apparently doing...something...somewhere.    I think Kubo's habit of ""I'm bored, I'll make a bunch of new characters"" is finally starting to really come back and bite him."
bleach,38hsw6,SoulUnison,15,Thu Jun 4 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yes it certainly feels that way. Shame about Bazz-B though. I really like him. I won't enjoy seeing him destroyed by Hashbrowns so easily. Kubo did make it pretty clear Yukio and Riruka aren't going to be doing anything in this fight though so he's already taken care of them for the most part....as for the other fullbringers....meh....I honestly wouldn't care that much if they didn't show up again. I'd like them to of course for those who are fans of them but I personally don't care much. They've always felt like filler characters to me. Ginjo and Tsukishima particularly annoyed me...so that feeds into my indifference towards their reappearance. This was mostly due to them being so appallingly  arrogant and believing they had any chance against the shinigami during the Fullbringer arc. The best part of the fullbringer arc for me was the shinigami putting the fullbringers, particularly those two, in their place. Ginjo in particular I just roll my eyes at because without stealing Ichigo's powers he had the power level comparable to that of a mid-tier vice captain at best. So unless they have significantly increased their power levels and become likable for me....I am just completely indifferent towards their return."
bleach,38hsw6,darthnick426,11,Thu Jun 4 10:07:32 2015 UTC,This was mostly due to them being so appallingly  arrogant and believing they had any chance against the shinigami during the Fullbringer arc.    That was kind of the whole point though. Ichigo and co face a group that poses a huge threat to them. They struggle and Ichigo mostly just doesn't have power. When the Shinigami and Ichigo wipe the floor with them it serves to draw contrast. This seemingly huge threat was cannon fodder to real players. It emphasizes just how far Ichigo's powers had fallen.

bleach,38hsw6,stalinchan,12,Thu Jun 4 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"So after reading this latest chapter of 'what the hell is going on' I think I got a pretty firm grasp over who might be the big bad at the end of the series.  I think that so much effort is put onto the Quincy so that what Aizen & Mayuri Kurotsuchi did can be ignored and forgotten. I don't know who the true final big bad will be but I think that the major twist is that Aizen & Mayuri Kurotsuchi have been teaming up for a long time with the main purpose of killing the quincy, explaining all the evil acts they've committed in the series (experimentation) & part of the story being a huge Aizen level gambit. I don't know what will happen but I think if Bleach went with that dynamic then it might shape up to be a really good conclusion even though part of it was ruined by stuff not being relevant being dragged out.  I think that Aizen's whole shikai & bankai power can reflect how he's been the entire show. His Shikai affects the people's senses to such a extent that they can't trust what their seeing is real. I think his bankai would one up that by starting to alter with reality & the story with Aizen being able to 4th wall break the entire thing if he wanted to."

bleach,38hsw6,stalinchan,2,Thu Jun 4 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"because he needed to create something that guarantee's he can't die. At the end of the aizen plot nobody can kill him since he's literally unkillable. If I had to guess he used his bankai to help modify what it actually do's and now is casually having fun seeing what happens making sure he wont die in the process.  Another random guess, since a shinigami's weapon can be manifested into power depending on how powerful a person are, I think the reason why key characters haven't used it yet is because of how abusable they are."

Perhaps they will have no choice to protect Bach for some reason.  Not sure about the match-ups, but some I would like to see are:   Shinji vs. Lili Barro (Shinji's ability to mess with X-axis' aim would be perfect) Bazz-B and Renji vs. Valkyrie (Probably not going to happen now that Bazz-B went off on his own :/) so it'll probably be Renji and Rukia (perhaps with Byakuya?) vs. Tenjiro or Oetsu Hiyori and Love vs. Hikifune (since Hiyori used to be close to Hikifune before she joined up with the RG) Shunsui vs. Haschwalth (presuming Bazz-B and co. lose to him)   That's all I have for now, if I can think of anymore I'll edit my comment.  Edit:   Soifon (and some allies) vs. Tenjiro (after that little scuffle they had between them in chapter 517)"
bleach,38jpws,redditrandomacc,3,Thu Jun 4 18:15:11 2015 UTC,It's kind of hard to plan out fights since I doubt they will all happen simultaneously. This will be my opinion if they do happen simultaneously though.   Kenpachi vs. Oetsu Byakuya vs. Senjumaru Yoruichi + Soi Fon vs. Tenjiro Kisuke vs. Ichibe Renji + Rukia vs. Hikifune Shunsui vs. Haschwalth Grimmjow + Neliel vs. Askin Shinji vs. Lille Ikkaku + Yumichika + Hisagi vs. Gerard ???? vs. Pernida   This is actually difficult to plan out lol.
bleach,38jpws,Alluka-,2,Thu Jun 4 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"It is hard to plan out!  As for Renji and Rukia vs. Hikifune I agree with /u/redditrandomacc.  I think Hiyori (and perhaps Love or other people) is going to fight Hikifune.  Think back to the TBTP Arc, Hiyori was sad that Hikifune left the Gotei to join the Zero Squad and another reference to their relationship was in chapter 517 when Hikifune asked Shinji ""how Hiyori was doing"".  Kubo likes to foreshadow things and I think that's where he's headed right now.  I think you're correct that Renji and Rukia will be a team but I have no idea who they will be facing."
bleach,38jpws,FishieSticks,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:24:48 2015 UTC,I know the foreshadowing is there and all but I don't think Hiyori and normal Captain level Shinigami stand a chance against a member of the Royal Guard. (I put Soi Fon against Tenjiro because of their confrontation. Yoruichi can more than likely hold her own against him so having her former apprentice there to help is also a plus.) I can see Hiyori being there when/if the fight happens but I really doubt she will play a huge part in it.  This also makes you wonder who is actually going to survive this battle for the Royal Palace. There is no way all of the Shinigami will make it out alive.
bleach,38jpws,Alluka-,0,Thu Jun 4 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Aside from the one bearded guy, arent all the royal guard members KIA now? Only beardman had the ability to regenerate with a little help.

bleach,38jpws,Fallingdamage,3,Thu Jun 4 18:50:03 2015 UTC,Ichibee is alright and as for the rest of the zero division I highly doubt they were only introduced to be off-screened.

bleach,38jpws,redditrandomacc,2,Thu Jun 4 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"That... actually makes a lot of sense.  If the RG used to be members of the Gotei 13, they had their own Zanpato with their own Bankais.

He could probably heal anyone, assuming they are willing to subsequently give their powers to him when they die.  Beyond that, their association with the former Soul King is unclear and might make them a little more durable than the average Shinigami - plenty of people in Bleach can shrug off fatal hits, so recovering from one isn't too unlikely."

Wonderweiss really isn't a serious threat to anyone other than Yama - I don't think he'd fight on par with any of the stronger captains if they had taken him seriously, though obviously that might change if he had a Quincy power up + human mind.

From what i know, he could simply turn himself into a 3rd party and go against both quincies and shinigamis. Appart from that, Pre-cacoon Aizen defeated: Komamura, Hitsugaya, Soi Fong, Rose, Love, Lisa, Kyouraku and Shinji at once. No matter how many power-ups the Gotei 13 received, Juha Bach can atleast match it. Also, Haschwalth destroyed Ichigo's Bankai, a feat none could.   The way i see, only the ""favorites"" could go on and we all know Kubo likes plot twists. This screams RG ""betrayal""."
bleach,38jpws,SpiritualLemon,2,Fri Jun 5 00:06:52 2015 UTC,Here's what I think will be the match ups:  Kenpachi (with a dash of Yumichika and Ikkaku) vs Nimaiya Vizards vs Hikifune Mayuri+ zombie friends vs Senjumaru Yorouichi+Soi Fon+Yuushiro vs Kirinji Nel+Grimmjow vs Askin Renji+Bazz B vs Valkyrie Byakuya+Rukia vs Pernida Shinji vs Barro Shunsui vs Ichibei Urahara+Isshin vs Haschwalth Ichigo vs Uryu Ichigo+Uryu vs Yhwach

I think Mayuri will throw him at Kenpachi or something. It was stated a looong while ago that the level of control over his bankai has risen a lot.

Mayuri is a very bad guy and I think it's crazy that suddenly he became kind of ""comedy relief,"" but what additional threat does he really pose?  I guess he could ally with Yhwach in the name of interest/science and therefore bring his ""zombies"" against the good guys, but Mayuri becoming a serious threat is still far less likely than Urahara becoming a serious threat.

And tousen owning uryuu? And yoruichi saving ichigo on the bridge?  I would say skip up until ichigo takes down the first menos grande...all the fillers except the zanpaktou one were trash(the amagai one was alright)
bleach,38lkec,Zil_v_a,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:15:02 2015 UTC,I saw the first few episodes and skipped to where Rukia went back to SS. Watched every episode from there aside from filler.
bleach,38lkec,izn1337,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"watching and reading is pretty different, just make them do what they prefer. Also, make them stick to it until the SS arc. They will either get hooked or find completely no reason to watch bleach."
bleach,38kd88,izn1337,12,Thu Jun 4 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"What Ryuken has been doing all this time will probably be realized the same time we find out what Isshin was been up to. Yhwach has taken interest in Uryu mostly because he was the only Gemischt Quincy that survived Auswahlen, which lead him to believe that (somehow) he can surpass Yhwach himself, which is why he ignored Ryuken even though he's a pure-blooded Quincy."
bleach,38kd88,water_warrior,6,Thu Jun 4 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"Ryuken, as far as we know, is still in the human world.  We don't know what kind of contact the Wandenreich had with other Quincy. There may not have been an option for Ryuuken to join. Though, it's being implied that Soken disagreed with the WR. So, he would have taught Ryuken against joining. Ryuuken himself seems to have no interest in practicing Quincy arts.   Also, there's a question of whether the WR knows he exists. The WR have mentioned Uryu and Soken, but not Ryuuken. Yhwach also said Uryu was the last living Quincy. So, it's not clear if Yhwach knows Ryuuken exists and is keeping it quiet or if Yhwach doesn't know Ryuuken exists at all."
bleach,38kd88,Temperatia,3,Thu Jun 4 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"I think something like this has to be explained in due time. We don't really know why he did this or that or why he chose Uryu over Ryuken. For all we know, Ryuken could be dead somewhere. (I think the most recent time we saw him was in the ""Nothing but the rain"" arc)"
bleach,38kd88,HatoriHanzoSteel,3,Thu Jun 4 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"Ryuken didnt even had to die.. He was pure quincy, Yhwatch killed only mixed blood quincy's... Masaki was infested with hollow so she lost her power because of that..."

bleach,38j1zc,SmittyNW,9,Thu Jun 4 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"...No one knows, actually. Her Bankai's name Minazuki is basically the same as her Shikai (but are of different kanji). Minazuki in Bankai basically means 'flesh drops gorge', or 'all things end'.   From this we can therefore deduce that her Bankai has something to do with acid...maybe.   Our best hope on getting a complete (or partial) explanation from Kubo is when he decides to release another bootleg like he did before."

bleach,38j1zc,Ceegee93,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"They toned down the violence in the anime. A lot of the more serious wounds were made less serious, like Hiyori's bifurcation was made into a cut along the stomach, iirc."

I think from context that you mean Unohana, in which case the best explanation I've seen for her bankai is ""it does stuff"". But expect a lot of people telling you how little Yachiru hasn't used Bankai yet..."
bleach,38j1zc,angryspacemahreen,6,Thu Jun 4 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Do you mean Unohana? Well there was a lot of liquid, it all disappeared and left a little black sword. That's all.  Funnily enough, both her Bankai and her shikai share the same name but with a different kanji reading. Minazuki, as in a flesh gorge, and minazuki, as in everything's end.  But this again, leads to the question ""No zanpakuto with unrelated shikai and bankai exist"", however the shikai minazuki is a giant healing thing, and the bankai is melee focused."
bleach,38j1zc,thenewperson1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"If we assume it's acidic themed, it works. Shikai uses minazuki's stomach acids to heal, bankai uses the acids to destroy."
bleach,38j1zc,angryspacemahreen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:51:07 2015 UTC,"Except we don't know whether the liquid that disappeared is acid or not, it was just pure black liquid. Not to mention, when the liquid disappeared, it left only a black sword, perhaps made of that liquid, perhaps it's just black, and we saw no burns on Kenpachi, meaning that he wasn't burned by acid."
bleach,38j1zc,rigaj,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:54:33 2015 UTC,"The theme is not acid, the theme is HEALING. I think that's the mistake everyone makes. Her bankai allows her to instantly heal everyone she injures as well as herself, allowing her to keep fighting forever."
bleach,38j1zc,HatoriHanzoSteel,2,Fri Jun 5 14:21:54 2015 UTC,"I like one of two theories that I have read on her Bankai.  One is that her Shikai and Bankai have opposite powers. Her Shikai heals, while her bankai destroys ANYTHING it comes into contact with. (This is the one I see people agreeing on the most.) The other is that her Bankai replicates an ""Extreme Area"" of combat that pushes people to their max level; basically, her bankai has the ability to draw out hidden powers in others IF they can survive the fight with her. It's like a ""training type"" Zanpakuto."
bleach,38j1zc,gwrgwir,3,Thu Jun 4 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting theories, though I didn't see the destruction aspect in her fight with Zaraki.  What I thought was happening was essentially Bleach does 'Groundhog Day', and (bankai) Minazuki creating an area that basically acted as a death reset switch.  As long as the bankai was active, she could prolong the fight as long as was desired (or until her defeat) - thus all things would end for one of the (two) combatants at the end of the fight."
bleach,38j1zc,-MuffinTown-,3,Thu Jun 4 20:00:06 2015 UTC,I always thought that Unohana meant in Chapter 525 that she learned the art of healing for the sole purpose of healing him repeatedly when they eventually did battle so that she could break every one of the barriers he put on his own power.   Also Zaraki's multiple references to 'blacking out' Makes me think she was bringing him to the point of death repeatedly and healing him. Essentially meaning that Zaraki has a kind of sayains Zenkai boost. Where every time they're nearly defeated they get stronger.
bleach,38j1zc,HatoriHanzoSteel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"I speculated the ""Destruction"" aspect myself.  For one, it would be the opposite of healing, and two: Kenpachi turned into a skeleton when he was submerged in the lake or tar or black water or blood or whatever it was."
bleach,38j1zc,gwrgwir,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, sense.  Good catch with the skeleton thing. I'd forgotten about that (great fight, though - I should go re-read it...)"

bleach,38j1zc,Neknoh,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"Unohana's bankai was, to me, a reiatsu area that melted away the flesh of any one fighting inside of it, killing them quickly, quicker still if their reiatsu is low. It's basically Barragan's power, localised and with different mechanics, but the end result is the same. The biggest difference would be that her reiatsu damages where his caused aging.     This means that her bankai can be healed through, and that is the reason she learned to heal. She healbombs herself, and possibly her opponent so that they can keep fighting in the flesh melting environment. So Kenpachi went from fightfightdie to diediediediedie until he started dying slower and slower as his body and spirit re-adjusted until he was being back at a power where he could defeat her and survive her bankai enough to do so."

bleach,38jf3c,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:33:17 2015 UTC,"I think Divided is a better way to put it. Why create a country to destroy it, unless the destruction is the result of an imbalance of souls.  Consider the fact that Aizen a former captain is no longer interested in assisting Shinigami, Mayuri and Kenpachi have never cared and will do whatever to help themselves. Many other Captains from the start of the Show and their replacements have been killed. The living captains include Shunsui who just lost his mentor and closest friend meaning he cant get the same support he once did. The Seireitei itself is gone and has been replaced, the Shinigami can't use their Zan anymore to purify souls...I think destroyed as a result of losing leadership. Especially if Shunsui is killed but we will find out more about Mayuris plan before that. Lets say Ichigo and Co survive without any loses meanwhile the others might lose a few characters while dealing with the Quincy. Ichigo and Co are not standard members of the Gotei and would not be obliged to help them in the end if creating the Soul King goes against what he believes."

Of course you'd take his prized blade as a reward. As something that will remind you of him."

bleach,38ho4t,HatoriHanzoSteel,10,Thu Jun 4 07:38:10 2015 UTC,I like the theory that his spiritual energy that was being repressed by his mental block was leaking and made his childhood imaginary friend manifest as a physical being. This is even hinted at when her bankai is HER imaginary friends becoming physical beings. Then when he started to draw on the energy he had sealed away she dissipated.
bleach,38ho4t,NilCealum,6,Thu Jun 4 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"She didn't use bankai, though? She just released her Shikai. And not to mention, if she were his Zanpakuto, she would have some similarity to kenpachi's. The names are different as well. It is also possible that Gremmy simply imagined her out of existence."
bleach,38ho4t,kingofdabz,3,Thu Jun 4 07:50:27 2015 UTC,"Plus, when Nozarashi spoke to him, that was before she released her Zanpakuto. So if he drew out her power, wouldn't she have dissipated right on the spot?"
bleach,38ho4t,kingofdabz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:52:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe when he discovered nozarashi for the first time during training is when yachiru was able to also release her two imaginary friend zanpakuto...because the next time after his training that we see yachiru fight, we for the first time ever see her release her sword, and in a very non traditional way too."
bleach,38ho4t,BerserkerChocobo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:22:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Shinigami girl commenting on yachiru zanpakuto was just for no reason. I think that scene where she fought gremmy imagination with her own imagination was symbolic. Of course it wasn't her bankai, neither was kenpachi's, that was his shikai, and as soon as he called forth nozarashi, there was a flashback of yachiru touching ken's sword when he asked her her name, and then all of a sudden boom she's gone with only her clothes left. It's too far-fetched to assume gremmy imagined her out of existence, if he did that would have been expanded on already, I don't see why gremmy should be referred to again at all. His shit is done."
bleach,38ho4t,mlc885,5,Fri Jun 5 08:20:34 2015 UTC,"And if this is true, just concider how crazy strong Kenpachi is! Just like Gremmy, to be able to create life out of his own imagination... then the fight between Yachiru and Gremmy couldn't have been more appropriate, since it was essentially a fight between 2 ""imagined"" entities.  But as for his spiritual powers and manifestation of Yachiru itself, I still think it's somehow related to his Zanpakuto. Although Kenpachi's is rare as this huge spiritual monsters and could be used to set a precendent, no Shin has been able to awoke their Shinigami powers without Zanpakuto, so im still leaning towards that as being the case here."
bleach,38ho4t,BerserkerChocobo,14,Thu Jun 4 12:30:50 2015 UTC,"She is definitely Nozarashi.  The last time we saw her was looking up as Kenpachi called his release command, and then we got a flashback about how they didn't have names, ending with him holding Nozarashi.

bleach,38ho4t,docmedic,5,Thu Jun 4 08:28:23 2015 UTC,"This. The problem is, Kenpach is a bit ""dumb"" and don't know about all stuff that goes into it, so it isn't terribly surprising that he didn't know where Yachiru went.

Maybe there will be an interchange beteween Kenpachi and Mayuri wich will reveal to Kenpachi what happeend to her, now that the latest chapter is out."

bleach,38g4nk,Zetaborutan,7,Thu Jun 4 00:24:24 2015 UTC,"Fantastic insight. This is one of the best things I've read on this sub recently.   He doesn't get techniques and gimmicks and weapons and whatnot. He just IS powerful. He is dominance and he might be justice.   This is possible, but I doubt it. At this point, Yhwach doesn't seem very noble. His recent panels have him looking incredibly malevolent and sinister, a man who would risk destroying everything for the sake of his vision. In these ways, Yhwach and Aizen have much in common. Both of them wish to overthrow the status quo to (seemingly) implement their own vision, even if it means risking everything. Their respective end games, regardless of what they actually are, must be immensely important to them. It can't just be pursuit of power that drives them. They must feel them on a personal, emotional level. What else would explain Aizen's breakdown when defeated by Ichigo and then binded by Urahara? What else would explain Yhwach's passionate, lengthy diatribes against the Gotei 13? Their goals mean EVERYTHING to them. Their dedication to them is quite enviable.  Now, as a whole, Bleach has shown us that just because you wish to overthrow the status quo does not necessarily make you bad. The SS arc revolved around Ichigo and co. doing just that: opposing and ultimately changing the outdated, unfair system of the Gotei 13. However, the harm involved in doing so was deemed to be worth it. The Fullbring arc's entire purpose was to confirm this; Yamamoto HIMSELF thanked Ichigo from the bottom of his heart.  So, at this point, I would argue that both Aizen and Yhwach may have good reasons for what they're doing, but how they're doing it is probably not the best method... just the most straightforward one.   It also begs to ask what is Ichigo's standing.   Ever since the end of the SS arc, Ichigo has mostly been a preserver of the status quo. He wants to uphold the world and protect those who live in it — damned be the rules of governments, kings, tyrants, or bureaucracies — Ichigo evaluates everyone as their own entity and respects their right to live how they wish, so long as it doesn't harmfully interfere with anyone else. It's been this way ever since the beginning, really...  Remember how Uryu introduced himself? ""I'm a Quincy, and I'm your ENEMY!"" Ichigo's response? ""Well Uryu, you seem like a pretty good guy to me, no matter your race.""  Remember the Vizoreds? ""We're part Hollow, just like you... we also have spirits residing in us that basically represent the void, and SS branded us as outsiders. In a way, we're not quite the good guys."" Ichigo's response? ""You guys seem alright to me; after all, we're basically fighting for the same thing at the end of the day.""  It's a foregone conclusion at this point that Ichigo and Aizen/Yhwach's plans will NEVER naturally intersect. Hell, it's possible that the other important characters (Shunsui, being the CC and Urahara, being... well, Urahara) also have conflicting visions of the future.  I think that's part of what makes this arc so exciting. There's no telling how everything will be resolved. After a long and tiresome fight, will they all agree on a world? Or will the strongest of them all crush the rest and implement his will regardless of those opposed?  I can't wait to find out.  EDIT: In a way, Ichigo supports change on an individual basis. He believes if you change the parts, you change the whole. Yhwach and Aizen seem to believe the opposite: if you change the whole, then you change the parts. Ichigo supports a bottom-top approach, whereas Aizen/Yhwach favor a top-bottom approach."
bleach,38g4nk,TIHNK,2,Thu Jun 4 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. The thing with them being crazy about their goal is sort of a given with this type of an antagonist. Would they not be crazy about the one thing they want to happen, they would gain qualities that would push them away from representing those.  and yeah, this is a thing. I'm pretty sure that if Ichigo would already see Yhwach as evil, he would already go bankai on him. It really feels like this is a battle of Gotei, instead of Ichigo."
bleach,38g4nk,Sirocco_,2,Thu Jun 4 08:18:52 2015 UTC,"Fantastic read, sir!   I particularly liked the explanation of each main villain that Ichigo encounters fighting for a different cause. We can see the progression of past to present to future. What are Juha's true goals? To erase everything from existence? Not for a better future, but a completely different reality as we know it?"
bleach,38g4nk,LucciDVergo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:17:54 2015 UTC,"That's what I think, but I can only theorize on that. Initially he was actually destroying everything, now he's changing it. I really hope he will make himself clear when he faces Ichigo again."

bleach,38fxps,Zil_v_a,11,Wed Jun 3 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"Urahara is practically the definition of ""shady."" We've seen Yhwach in all his ocular splendor, we've seen Aizen-taichou, we've seen Unohana-taichou have a dangerous past, we've seen Yama-jii being a monster 1000 years ago, we've seen Ginjo's criminal dealings, we've seen Ukitake being suspicious with a smile on his face, we've seen Mayuri conduct questionable experiments, we've seen Shiba Isshin hiding behind the Kurosaki name, we've seen Gin hiding behind those almost-closed eyes, we've seen a muscular hunk in an apron using a level 100 Bakudou without so much as twitching... hell, we've seen a lot. But none of these guys even comes close to Urahara.  He's like one of those detectives that's always first at the crime scene, even though he's not assigned to the case, and the case hasn't even been reported. He's always there, whenever you need him. In the entire history of Soul Society, he was the first one to discover a method to merge to opposite beings in existence into one entity. He invented something that could grant immortality - if that isn't the pinnacle of invention, then I don't know what is.  He almost always has answers for everything, even when one wouldn't expect it. He's basically like a smaller version of the Soul King. Without him, Soul Society would have been destroyed on more than one occasion. His powers of observation, his deduction, his analysis of weaknesses - there's no one else in the entire series who even comes close. Not even Aizen-taichou. Safe to say, Urahara keeps the entire proceedings in check.  Whatever we know about the Quincy abilities - things like Blut, Bankai-theft, its counter, Vollstandig - these are Urahara's deductions. The same goes for the Hougyoku, nature of the Garganta, Dangai, soul balance, whatnot.  I wouldn't be surprised if Urahara has a major role to play by the time this arc is over - beyond fighting and defeating an insanely strong opponent. He's the kind of character that could only fail to directly defeat the villain only because that's the protagonist's job. Both he and Aizen-taichou in that way, have something Yhwach doesn't - insane levels of intelligence/shrewdness/sneakiness that only lose to plot armor. I think, given enough data/time for analysis, Urahara possesses the best chance of defeating any villain, be it Yhwach or someone else. That is what makes him dangerous."
bleach,38fxps,aizen6,4,Thu Jun 4 07:35:09 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see Ichigo and Urahara butting heads at some point.  Not over a Good vs. Evil thing, but rather an idealogical difference.  Urahara is generally ""good"".  He does ""good"" things - like saving the Vizards, saving Masaki, trying to keep the Hogyoku out of Aizen's hands.  Even in exile from SS, he's still at hand when SS needs him.  It's very hard to argue that he isn't on the side of ""good"".  But...Urahara is also willing to put the needs of the many ahead of the needs of the few.  He was willing to sacrifice Rukia's life/powers to make the hogyoku inert, for example.  He didn't give Rukia a choice - he led her to believe he was giving her a ""normal"" gigai, when in fact the gigai he gave her would eventually drain her powers completely.  Basically, he's willing to sacrifice individuals for the greater good.  Ichigo, on the other hand, has your basic simple shounen protagonist ""I will protect everyone!"" mentality.  Sacrificing someone in order to save the world isn't good enough - and he'll just keep smashing enemies until it's no longer necessary.  So what happens when in order to serve the ""greater good"", one of Ichigo's friends needs to die, and there doesn't appear to be an alternative?  Urahara and Ichigo end up on opposite sides.  They both want the ""good"" outcome, but one's willing to sacrifice others to achieve it, while the other isn't."

bleach,38fxps,efez,2,Thu Jun 4 01:59:13 2015 UTC,Initially KT was going to make Urahara a villain and that's why he seems shady in the early parts. Which just becomes mysterious later on because this dude knew every secret (except one) from pretty much the beginning of the story.

bleach,38fxps,remiscl,2,Thu Jun 4 11:42:53 2015 UTC,"Earlier on in the series I would have liked to see Urahara go villain but I feel it's too late at this stage.   After Aizen then and Yhwach now, any ""I planned everything"" reveal is going to fall flat. I'd rather he remained a (kind of shady) good guy."
bleach,38fxps,coyotestark21,3,Thu Jun 4 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"He probably will stay good. If he won't, I'm assured it will not be a ""I planned everything"" but rather ""I changed my mind"" kind of reveal. After all you don't need to be a mastermind to screw everyone over. Mayuri seems to be trying that out right now."
bleach,38fxps,unnusual_art,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:20:03 2015 UTC,I hear this alot and im curious. Can you show me where urahara appears evil or not so good?
bleach,38fiu4,lostgilgamesh,12,Wed Jun 3 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"he was going to be interesting and powerful due to having access to a long list of rare, powerful and mechanically interesting high level quincy techniques   he does have those, and we've seen a few of them. its just that he doesnt explain them, so we don't really know what they do.  a lot of the more overpowered aspects still follow as Quincy techniques though; power siphoning and stealing is what being a Quincy is all about! Uryu also had some moments of ""oh wait, your power doesn't work on me because I'm a Quincy"" when he faught kurotsuchi."
bleach,38fiu4,eightNote,8,Wed Jun 3 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"I know but i just wish he'd use more things like blut vene anhaben, sankt bogen and heilig pfiel and less op omniscience stuff and i feel like now that he's full god mode we'll see less of that stuff....i hope i'm wrong though."
bleach,38fiu4,kingofdabz,9,Wed Jun 3 22:39:51 2015 UTC,"if you reread his fight with ichibei he actually uses some pretty interesting techniques. like the blut vene that becomes a bubble and that can take over you if you touch it, that was badass, especially seeing ichibei shrug it off. another badass moment was yhwach summoning a gigantic quincy bow below him as he's falling at an extreme speed, 4 giant arrows shoot up and one pierces yhwach in the chest, which propels him back upward, using his invincibility and his own techniques against him to give himself an advantage again is ingenious. even the fight between yamamoto and fake yhwach was pretty awesome, because that fake yhwach still used yhwach's real techniques."
bleach,38fiu4,aizen6,4,Thu Jun 4 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"Uryu also had some moments of ""oh wait, your power doesn't work on me because I'm a Quincy"" when he faught kurotsuchi.   That fight was also a fair one, in the sense that Uryu didn't exactly win ""completely."" He would have died without Nemu giving him the antidote, and Mayuri would have been the last one standing. On top of that, Uryu lost his powers in exchange for the boost.  I like Yhwach as a villain - he's menacing, he's got the right destuctive attitude and he claims he's got the right reasons. All of these make for the perfect stereotypical villain. But it would look so much more respectable if the fights weren't this onesided. I mean... he defeated Yama-jii and Ichibei without breaking a sweat. If Ichigo is going to become stronger than both of them, it might take the fun out of it all. ~_~  Then again, Yhwach has also faced his fair share of troubles. He was born deaf, mute and immobile, and he basically had to leech off of other people's abilities just to be ""normal."" That would have created some shit attitude in him. And to add to it, he was apparently treated badly by his old man, and was sealed for a millenium. Without knowing who started this, it's tough to say if Yhwach is really the bad guy, simply going by what side the protagonist is fighting for.  Besides his abilities being interesting, he has developed it a lot, and has also granted powers to a lot of people in interesting ways. I think it sort of ""makes up"" for the shit days he faced as a baby."
bleach,38fiu4,Jedy_hacker,11,Thu Jun 4 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"Yhwach is the best Apool that has happened in Bleach.  I really like how he represents POWER in the series.  It's not like in other anime/mangas where the dude , just get's to do bigger explosions , shouting harder and breaking more shit up.  Or in other words.... he's legit man , like : If God existed , he would of shown his power in the same way   Yhwach did :D , by building a modaf***ng giant ass Crib"
bleach,38fiu4,maytagem,0,Wed Jun 3 22:37:29 2015 UTC,It doesn't help that Ywach is entirely uninteresting in every other regard though. We know almost nothing about him and have no emotional connection for a guy that's taken up more screen time than the protagonist that's a bit of a problem.  Aizen was the best example of me asking myself how in the hell is Ichigo going to get himself out of this one and the answer being both preestablished and out of left field simultaneously.
bleach,38fiu4,mindseye84,10,Thu Jun 4 03:36:34 2015 UTC,I really hope Yhwach gets a lot of back story and more character building. Bleach is amazing because of the different characters Kubo has created and Yhwach +  the Quincy's deserve the same treatment.  TBTP 2 would be ace.

Bleach is about OP powers looking cool and spectacular only to be curbstomped by a more simplistic but brutal power.  My Sebonzakura is in the millions!  Well, my Getsuga Tensho will just blow them all away!  I guess it wort of works with Yhwach, being the simplistic representation of power negation/siphon, but it's kind of underwhelming.

It might have a bit of a meaning with Ichigo I guess. His reiatsu is often shown as black since he has a bit of a hollow in him. For example, getsuga is basically a shadow or black light being propelled at a target. He then uses white for quincy techniques, with getsuga juujishou. But even then both Yhwach and OMZ dress in a lot of black, so it seems random after all."

Real katana have a dark line along the flat part of the blade which is made by putting clay on the blade while tempering it. Some of them are actually black, but they're usually a bit lighter. If there's no black part, that means the sword has no hamon which means it's double-edged."

bleach,38b8js,whatacrappyusername,3,Sun Jul 12 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"The point of attacking Hueco Mundo was to convert arrancar over to their side before they joined forces with the Soul Society. If they hadn't gone in there, Harribel would probably be fighting against them, and she would have brought a good chunk of the forces in Hueco Mundo with her.   Another reason they captured Hueco Mundo was to give Aizen more of an incentive to join. Yhwach probably offered Aizen the opportunity to take command over his old forces.  They might have also wanted arrancar because they could potentially steal Ichigo's bankai. I think converted arrancar for some reason could use the bankai stealing medallions more effectively than anyone else, which is why Ivan was sent to steal Ichigo's Bankai and not a Sternritter."
bleach,38b8js,whatacrappyusername,4,Wed Jun 3 04:41:53 2015 UTC,"Also when YH said that he sould have send an arrancar instead of kirge to stop Ichigo, does it mean he still has arrancars strong enough up his sleeves ?

Perhaps Yhwach was waiting for some of his Sternritter to die so he could assign some letters to the arrancar? Now they can go face their former master and maybe the ex-Sternritter who once had the same letter as they did."
bleach,38b8js,Keranu,2,Wed Jun 3 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"When YH said that he should have sent an Arrancar instead, he said that because he realized that Ichigo's relatively dormant Quincy powers had fully reawakened after being inside of the jail that Kirge put him in  That's not to say, however, that there might not be strong Arrancar up his sleeves, but I doubt that they would really pose a challenge for Ichigo unless Ywach (Kubo) gives them a powerup"

bleach,38b8js,eightNote,4,Wed Jun 3 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"The Arrancar Ichigo fought was not at Captain level. Ichigo used Bankai on him just to progress the situation. Ichigo almost took him out with Getsuga Tensho. So, Ichigo didn't really need to try to win against him.   One reason given by Haschwald was that Arrancar can be turned into Quincy then forced to fight immediately because they do not need to be taught howto fight. Defeating Halibel was obviously necessary to gain access to all of the Arrancar.  After that, it really doesn't seem like there was any other purpose for the Arrancaar or taking over Hueco Mundo. Just like Yhwach stole power from the Stern Ritter in Soul Society after making it to the Royal Realm. After he makes it on to the next step of his plan, the tools and resources used for the last step become purposeless and can be reused if necessary.  It just hasn't been necessary to reuse Hueco Mundo or any of the resources he gained by taking it over."

Are the different royal families all equal in power ?  Where do special people stand such as Ichigo and Uruhara ?  Is the CC also overseer of the Stealth and Kido corps   Edit: word
bleach,38ccmf,Andygoesrawr,5,Wed Jun 3 08:59:45 2015 UTC,"There's only one Royal Family, the Soul King's family. We don't know if it's a real family or just those directly beneath him, but that's what it means by Royal Family. The Noble Families have no official power whatsoever, just influence. They do have unique jurisdictions though, so they may have certain areas of control given to them by the Soul King or the Central 46, but we don't know that yet.  Urahara isn't under anybody's control since he's an escaped criminal, and he has no right to command anyone in the Gotei 13, though they let him during crises because he's usually the only one who knows what to do. Ichigo is under the control of the Captain Commander being a Substitute Shinigami, and would probably technically have to answer to any captain but in practice I doubt he would. They know both Urahara and Ichigo are very important allies and I'm guessing they would do whatever they have to to ensure they stay allied with them.  The Captain Commander commands the captains of the Gotei 13, nothing else. The Onmitsukidou and the Kidou Corps have their own inner workings and answer only to the Central 46 and the Soul King, not to the Gotei 13.  The diagram is a little outdated. Instead of the Royal Family it should say the Soul King, and in reality the Zero Division are the ones who have direct control over the Central 46 and Seireitei's military branches, since they are the ones who carry out the will of the Soul King."

bleach,38ccmf,aizen6,2,Wed Jun 3 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"I still have a feeling that the statue thing wasn't actually the Soul King. I bet it's a trap. I mean Bach might think he absorbed all of his power, but think about it... A god could EASILY create something that would give someone a tremendous amount of power and give them the illusion they're absorbing their own power.  The SK probably gave him something that made him super powerful, at first, but will inevitably corrupt from the inside out, leaving him weak enough for everyone else to subdue or destroy him... maybe SK was giving Bach a chance to be god, since he thinks he can do the job so much better. Kinda like in Bruce Almighty.... Hey wait a minute, Bruce Almighty.... Kubo must be a Jim Carrey fan...  And while we're bringing up theories. Where the fuck is Mayuri with all of his super potions? His super human one that he gave a 1 billion x dose to that Arrancar... why doesn't he simply give a dab to everyone? And why didn't he just single handedly defeat all the Stern ritter himself with it? He either could've used it on himself to slit all their throats, or he could've put it inside a bunch of hidden sentry machines or clones, or whatever, to quickly give powerful doses to all of them during their next invasion.  Seriously, Mayuri's bio weapons alone are the most OP thing in the whole bleach universe. Only the SK himself would be able to resist that shit. If Aizen couldn't resist Urahara's KIDOU, something that relies on a person's power level, then not even Bach could resist Mayuri's bio weapons."

Between Divisions 2-13, there is no ""internal"" hierarchy. Captain of Division 2 is also the supreme commander of the Onmitsukido, and Division 4 is the healing/relief division. These are ""special"" duties, but don't make these divisions superior to others. If that were the case, Ukitake (who's the seniormost along with Shunsui and Unohana-taichou) would be one of the lowest rung captains. Even Shiro-chan and Komamura would be higher up than him."

Renji is barely stronger than Ikkaku at this time, but he is stronger.   11th division being called the ""strongest"" is a self-proclaimed title; it's not necessarily true for the squad as a whole, but as for the captain...I'll leave that for you to decide hehe.  Urahara is relatively famous in Soul Society. I won't spoil anything so just watch the show.

Renji and Ikkaku are of comparable strength, but keep in mind that strength isn't everything. The powers of some characters are better suited to fighting some opponents than others, and worse suited, so sometimes the ""weaker"" fighter wins.   I like these posts. Keep em coming."
bleach,3894x6,seventhsoul,0,Tue Jun 2 21:03:35 2015 UTC,Yea I can see what you mean about certain skills being more/less suited for fights. Plus Renji had some past experience fighting Ichigo so I can see him doing a bit better and not underestimating him anywhere near as much as Ikkaku did helping him tag Ichigo a couple of times.

Stephanie Sheh also voiced Orihime perfectly IMO... she makes me want to stab myself almost as hard as the Japanese VA did!  Slight spoiler, but I found the captains to all be wonderfully voiced, but special mentions to Byakuya and Kenpachi (his original one, anyhow... the replacement wasn't as good). Considering how many characters Bleach has and all the screen time they get, I think they did an outstanding job at recruiting the right people."

It truly is one of the best I've seen in any series, basically combining a rescue arc, murder mystery, and civil war into one cohesive story.

Read at the very least, the first arc which is the first 70 chapters. Also One Piecr and Bleach are different series, with different plots, characters, and only have being shonen mangas in common."
bleach,388mjp,reigun91,3,Tue Jun 2 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Strap your belt because this is going to be a long one.  First off, there is no such thing like a ""manga community"". We have a crap ton of genres and ways of execution, so when you bad up a ton of people in one place, good example of that being /r/anime, you get a bowl of chaos. When it comes to big mediums like those, always ask people for opinions in close communities. Not always at sources, but like genres for example. You like shonens, you search for a place that only shonen fans visit. Then you can get sensible discussions going.  For Bleach as a shonen, I'm buyest. I am an amateur writer and I find bleach to be one of the best works of writing, so take whatever I say with a pinch of salt in it. At this point I may be loving it for the sake of loving it. It's definitely better than Naruto, but then again, in my opinion Naruto is the worst shonen to exist, and only grew so big thanks to marketing and lack of competition in the america and Europe. It was full of needless characters, the world was very inconsistent and the whole idea full of holes. Most of my friends watched it only because they've already invested a ton of hours so it was too late to drop it. Sure it was decent, but surely overrated. It will probably be remembered like Evangelion is nowadays. No one knows why anybody liked it.  Now, the main meat. Bleach vs One Piece.   That's a tie.  One Piece is an open adventure with episodic events and colorful, more European art style that makes use of forms and dynamics to create an intriguing experience. It's also a great deal both comedy and action. It doesn't take itself serious unless it absolutely needs to.   Bleach on the other hand is a lineal story with a clear goal always set before the hero. The idea of an ending never becomes arbitrary compared with now random idea of one piece. Ichigo is a character that stands against many ""Force of nature"" type villains. His first opponent embodies the idea of Law, Order, Tradition and shows us that Ichigo isn't motivated by any sort of rules or bigger good, but his personal sense of right. He is in truth an egoist, caring for the safety of the immediate world he lives in. Similar to Luffy. Then he stands against the idea of Chaos, a now classic villian of mangas (his name is a spoiler). He also briefly stands against Despair and now he's fighting Power itself. It's a lot like american/European comic structure. The villains have a story but it never defines them. It's always about their action and how heroes react to them.   The artstyle of bleach is completely the opposite of one piece, it's very realistic and very refined, especially in current chapters. While it's less dynamic it helps it build a more serious atmosphere.  My suggestion is that you watch/read it until the end of Soul Society arc. If you don't get hooked by the time you read the quote ""Farewell, Shiningami days"" then you won't find yourself hooked at all.   I'm also afraid that chapters 1-70 are as medicore as it gets. My most disliked part of the series."

It's really up to you, ultimately. I love Bleach, but I'm not going to try to convince you to read it.   One Piece and Bleach are different stories with different characters. But, being a shounen, there's a chance you'll like Bleach, but you shouldn't force yourself (or have to force yourself) to enjoy it. Heck, you didn't like Naruto so there must be something about One Piece specifically that you enjoy.   tl;dr: Start reading, which you did. If it doesn't stick, move on."

If you like some serious fighting, abit slow character developments (not like Naruto), jokes (which includes perveted), tits, whole new level of sword fighting, but brace yourself because starting chapters are slow just for the sake of character development. I'd recommend watching anime version if you didn't like reading manga chapters. FYI, If you don't like fights like Naruto, or of some DBZ level, you're not going to enjoy Bleach at all, neither me or others will force you to read/watch Bleach because everyone has their own opinions. I did watched/read Naruto and One Piece anime/manga, so yeah, don't compare them with Bleach, Bleach is at different level."

Im not exactly sure at which chapter the SS arc starts but maybe you should keep on reading until all the character introduction arcs of Ichigo, Orihime, Chad and Ishida are over and then look into the Soul Society arc with other shinigami. If its still not really your cup of tea dont force yourself to swallow it.  Its my personal favorite because what it sometimes lack in story or chapter length it gets back with art (though kubo seems to be demotivated right now but when he really wants he can draw really beautiful though his speciality lies in character drawing not backgrounds like Oda from one piece for example) and/or likeable characters."

It still holds the amazing world building, humor, characters, and story that oda created, but imo, the anime adds nothing good to one piece. Only filler and bad pacing.   Oh, and the marine base arc, that's a filler arc. That's why its bad."

But now that Kubo has done some excavating in his asshole it's going to also be because of his Quincy ability to absorb energy along with his Hollow regen shit. Because he's a hardwired hybrid of everything, all of his abilities are better than each individual power alone, so his Hollow and Quincy regen/energy absorption shit are through the roof.

bleach,384znk,Gabu-chan,2,Tue Jun 2 08:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean. I just think he started out as someone who just questioned the Soul King, and Soul Society must have just made him feel like an outcast or something, telling him he was wrong or whatever. After the fight with Ichigo and Aizen, Ichigo even said he just felt loneliness coming from Aizen and that he wanted to be a regular Shinigami again. During the Karakura town battles, when Momo appeared, Aizen sensed her and his mood changed. I'm sure he felt bad for what he did with her. He is just fueled by his anger against the Soul King, so maybe his actions were coming off a lot more cynical. He's thinking about his cause. When Urahara managed to finally seal him, you see some human emotions from Aizen finally haha."

Ichigo as a character has always been centered around growing stronger to protect the people around him, a value inherited by losing his mother to Grand Fisher as a child. The series ending with him completely powerless - even after one final act of protection for what he cares about on his part - isn't fulfilling to the reader, the main character, or the supporting cast.  Sure, you could work in a bit of Rukia, Renji, and the others visiting from time to time, and you could say that Ichigo's impact on the Seireitei from the time he had his power is how he protects them, but the fact of the matter is that ending Bleach like that would leave the main character and by extension the audience miserable and craving for more."
bleach,386hsy,JinHikari,2,Tue Jun 2 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"It would of been a good wrap up if aizen died, Him dead would of meant the ultimate evil of SS was gone because at that point the quincies were assumed dead, Ichigo losing his powers and returning to a normal life, and things more or less returning to how they were at the start of the series. If kubo decided to bring bleach back after that, it would of been more welcomed to bring about a new protagonist with members of the previous show popping up here and there"
bleach,386hsy,Keranu,2,Wed Jun 3 05:50:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bleach can end well for me, not after Aizen got the jewel ripped out of his chest and poisoned and evolved. Logic says Gin should've been the next main villian, then Ywach. When plot armor protected Aizen a big opportunity to break the mold of many shonen mangas was lost. I think many readers just want to see the yet to be shown bankais revealed."
bleach,386hsy,twofaze,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:57:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm expecting a repetition of the first ending, then maybe a short ""what is our life now, that you are the king"" moment similar to what Code Geass has in the last few minutes. Then maybe a morale at the very end.   I don't think it will be this good. Let's be honest, the very reason we have problems now is that it was too good of a climax. We are spent in that regard. Making another one will not make us feel as good as the first one made us."

bleach,386hsy,Temperatia,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:54:32 2015 UTC,Inner Zangetsu(Quincy) is the conscious mind of the previous Soul King. Ichigo was never to be used as the king but only to carry with him the power of a God.  Turns out Quincy powers are the same as Zanpakutos and the reason they created then was to harm but not kill hollows. Yhwach is just the lesser being comapred to his other half the king. It's why he finds it odd that Ichigo would fight but not strange he would kill the body of the king.
bleach,386hsy,Rocksbury,-1,Tue Jun 2 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"To the ""too many loose ends"" point, how will things like mystery bankais and other mysteries be properly solved this late in the game, without a clusterfuck? With 6 bad guys, 2 of which will likely be dealt with by Ichigo and Co? I'd rather these remain mysteries than just squeezed into the last chapters just cuz."
bleach,386hsy,lostgilgamesh,2,Tue Jun 2 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"We've allready covered most of the other mysteries, as for the remaing bankais that's what"" Wahrwelt"" is for imo...creating some structure for the final stage so some of the rest of the fights can be dealt with in a clear manner, not certain how this will work with the sternritter being extremely undermanned at the moment, perhaps they'll require more than 1v1 (i mean they were strong enough to take out the royal guard)"

He was praised as God from the moment he was born, and has always possessed the ability to grant life and take it away. He would've had an ego the size of the moon and a sadistic streak to match.  But his defeat definitely would've channeled any benevolence he might've had into hatred for the Shinigami."
bleach,382o0v,Andygoesrawr,5,Mon Jun 1 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"channeled any benevolence he might've had into hatred   Royd Lloyd impersonated Yhwach's appearance and personality, and the imitation showed a lot of grief and astonishment when Yamamoto summoned dead Quincies using Zanka no Tachi Minami. Would this mean that Yhwach actually cared for his comrades 1000 years back in a way that he doesn't right now? If Royd Lloyd's impersonation is perfect, he would mirror Yhwach's thoughts and feelings exactly, giving some sort of authenticity to the surprised expressions. The present Yhwach seems like an asshole who just kills for the heck of it, though."
bleach,382o0v,aizen6,2,Mon Jun 1 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"something that really bothers me is how strong Royd Lloyd is. Kenpachi fought and killed Loyd Lloyd, who has the ability to copy power and technique, where as Royd only copies memory and personality...  so how is it that Kenny got his ass handed to him when fighting Royd? Did he really handicap himself that much?"
bleach,382o0v,Provoker9714,2,Tue Jun 2 07:36:06 2015 UTC,I'm guessing a similar thing that happened when Ken fought his reigai.

bleach,382o0v,docmedic,4,Tue Jun 2 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"He was trying to take over the Royal Realm when he attacked 1000 years ago.   So, he was already evil back then.   He also implied that he had used Auschwalen more than once before the story began. So, he was definitely evil."
bleach,382o0v,Temperatia,6,Mon Jun 1 12:44:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't remember anything about him trying to do what he did but Kubo has dropped things that can imply that he is doing it again. Ill check on it though. But I feel he is good for bad in his chaotic way. So the Quincy empire thriving would be one thing he would be proud of otherwise he would have absorbed all pure quincy  EDIT. Kubo likes having complex characters, he could have well and truly been all evil but I think the complexity of his persona made some things different"
bleach,382o0v,Andygoesrawr,7,Mon Jun 1 12:54:53 2015 UTC,"We don't know that. We don't even know who attacked who 1,000 years ago, but considering the war took place in the human realm I find it pretty unlikely that Yhwach was the one doing the attacking.  And we only know that Yhwach's used Auswaehlen twice -- just recently, and 9 years ago. It's implied that he was using Auswaehlen when he was a baby, but I wouldn't really call anything a baby does evil."
bleach,382o0v,Temperatia,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but, just like the extermination of 200 years ago, I feel like it was the Quincy that were acting ""out of line"" and prompted a response from the Shinigami. So, Yhwach did not attack, but he instigated.   I also feel it's more likely Yamamoto gathered a group in response to Yhwach rather than just slaughtering a whole race just as a demonstration of power. If that was the case, they wouldn't have rewarded him by making him Captain Commander. They would have brought the RG down to put the squeeze on him and his operations.  I feel the statement ""No Quincy has survived my Auscwalen"" implies there was more than one Auschwalen. Feels like a comment based off of more than one instance of Auscwalen l. Depends on whether what he did as a baby was deliberate and if it could actually be considered Auscwalen."
bleach,382o0v,Andygoesrawr,4,Mon Jun 1 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yhwach and the Quincies definitely would've been out of line, but they didn't launch an attack for the purpose of taking over the Royal Realm. We don't know if the Royal Realm even existed 1,000 years ago.  Yamamoto was Captain-Commander because he assembled the Gotei 13 by hand, and he had already done so by the time of the war since he was wearing his First Division haori when he fought Yhwach. Yhwach hates the Soul King, and the Soul King favoured the Shinigami and promoted them to his personal guard even after the war, so I think it's pretty likely that the Soul King was either in favour of exterminating the Quincies or was sealed by that point and had no say in the matter. After all, he's the physical manifestation of the soul balance, which is threatened by the Quincies."
bleach,382o0v,Temperatia,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Chances are the Royal Realm and it's guards existed in the same state since long before the Gotei 13. The RG members and the SK all predate the Gotei by a long time.   Also, the SK doesn't really favor the Shinigami. He was just made by them. Yhwach and the Quincy did not chose their power. So, it's just coincidence that their powers disrupt the state of the world. The readers still need to learn why the Soul King's kind were laying around SS and why he had a son."
bleach,382o0v,Rocksbury,2,Mon Jun 1 18:51:40 2015 UTC,Except a couple members of zero had been a part of the 13 guard and Yama founded all the divisions. Plus they created the Soul King who gave zero power meaning all the time before Yama and the king no one had a zanpakuto. Also the King hates Shinigami so he should be a Hollow and Yhwach is just half of the king his birth is the first Quincy.

What did his fear needles do to anything that is not Shinigami pawn?   And it's not some noble sacrifice that almost made her kill herself. She's couldn't control it because as usual she's trash.  Let me remind you this is after the training with the Zero division. Imagine if she went in before. How fucking useless would she be? Let me also remind you Kubo only made her go through that training because there would be no other way to keep this idiotic, poorly written, completely unexciting, smug, weak, trash of a character relevant.

Straight after the soul society arc (and during) they lose their usefulness and are just sidelined for the rest of the story.  There is literally no reason for this. Like, he is the author of the manga, he could just make their powers stronger or give them an upgrade, or give them a fighting teacher, anything, but no, they are just pointless, which is sad because I really like them.

bleach,381bl3,tackslock,3,Mon Jun 1 11:07:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting analogy there. But the thing is, Orihime's abilities aren't just solely composed of defense and healing. It was stated to be more than that. But Kubo didn't utilize it. It fell short to the hype he built up. And it doesn't help when at the end of the arc, he revealed that Aizen just used Orihime to lure everyone out."
bleach,381bl3,BlindfoldScience,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:07:50 2015 UTC,"Orihime's abilities aren't just solely composed of defense and healing. It was stated to be more than that.   Are there any others I'm forgetting?  I've been re-watching and her abilities seem to be mainly shielding, healing and regeneration which are all forms of protection.  Apart from Tsubaki  but she has shown she doesn't have the will to attack, only defend.  All of Chad's abilities are fighting based and likened to that of hollows when in Hueco Mundo.  Now, here's what else I was thinking but my memory is rather sketchy.  Aizen (was it?) noted something along the lines that Orihime and Chad only got their powers because they were connected to Ichigo and wanted to become strong.  With the help of the hogokyu, they gained their powers and manifested the way they did.  Are their powers both connected to Ichigo's soul and thus are manifestations of his will like I stated?  Orihime's abilities were likened to Kidou by Hacchi which would represent Ichigo's Shinigami side whereas it's been mentioned multiple times (Kisuke I believe, but definately Chad himself) that Chad's powers are hollowlike thus representing his inner hollow."
bleach,381bl3,Sirocco_,2,Mon Jun 1 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"Orihime's power is the ability to reject reality. It was said to be something that trespasses God's domain. Kubo could've made her character more useful than being just a damsel-in-distress. So basically. It was not healing, shielding and regeneration per se but rejecting that the initial damage had happened."
bleach,381bl3,Zil_v_a,2,Tue Jun 2 09:45:36 2015 UTC,"I do not know what Kubo has in mind for them, but it did better be good. More than what they currently are now-plot devices.   Orihime's spatial rejection should demonstrate some new abilities, and Chad should master his powers, or they have zero chance against the Quincy, especially now that they are about to face off against the top dogs."
bleach,381bl3,4chan_is_sux,3,Mon Jun 1 15:34:51 2015 UTC,"So Chad is pretty much just there. And not even in a significant manner. Just kinda slides into shadow more and more.  Orihime will now have her best moments. That is, her presence in the arrancar arc, and then she will be the one reason for everything to start sucking (ichigo-kun intensifies) and will slowly but surely evolve into the worst character of all shonens. She could rival Sakura in intelligence at this point.  Idk, we had a topic about Chad recently. He's a good character but in the wrong place. Definitely not a material for a secondary. Beside that, Kubo is just pretty bad at writing female characters. When you think about it only Rukia and Yourichi are decent, and they both are surprisingly boyish."
bleach,381bl3,MetaAmbience,2,Mon Jun 1 10:10:06 2015 UTC,"I cant see much usefullness with Inoue-chan unless she gets an effective offensive ability, which probably aint going to happen. Chad might have potential to be around Espada 8 or 7 level but it wouldnt make sense anyway, since he is still just human after all."
bleach,381bl3,Temperatia,2,Mon Jun 1 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"Thing is, she does have an offensive ability, but for some reason she barely ever uses it. And when she does, she does a half-assed job of it, and it predictably has no effect.   You'd think she'd want to train so that she could have the mindset to use her abilities to their full extent."

As Zommari said, Gemelos Sonido and Utsesumi are tricks that only work because your opponent doesn't know they are about to happen. Neither Byakuya nor Zommari could have kept using that trick indefinitely. Zommari used Gemelos Sonido too much, which is why he switched to using his Zanpakuto after Byakuya started to counter.   Kubo swept Zommari's speed under the rug by having him conduct the rest of the battle from a single spot, without using the increased Sonido his released form would allow him. I guess that goes back to what Byakuya said to Ichigo: arrogance is often the undoing of a would-be victor.  There was really no reason for Zommari to lose that fight except his own stupidity.  1.

Not because either of them suddenly got too fast for the trick, but because they would know the trick was coming and plan for it.  Zommari could have dodged the petals before they surrounded him, used a giant Cero to blast the petals out of formation, or Amor'd Byakuya while Byakuya spoke to him through that hole in the Goukei. He did none of these. He forgot every technique he knew and just sat there to get blasted.  That's shitty writing. That's  kubo."

Not because either of them suddenly got too fast for the trick, but because they would know the trick was coming and plan for it.   Right, so I'm not sure what either was going to do in the speed department that the other wouldn't see. If they can keep up with each other's tricks I can't see how one's base speed can be said to be higher than the other's.    Zommari could have dodged the petals before they surrounded him   Would this be feasible? We just went through them being able to keep up to each other. He'd just get chased. And caught, most likely.    used a giant Cero to blast the petals out of formation   Lol. Aside from the question of whether this was a feat he'd have been able to accomplish, he'd just be hit on the blind side of the Cero.    or Amor'd Byakuya while Byakuya spoke to him through that hole in the Goukei.   He actually had used all his eyes before the hole (minus his trump card ones, which eventually failed so I really don't see that working there either).    That's shitty writing. That's kubo.

bleach,381i72,Temperatia,4,Mon Jun 1 10:09:46 2015 UTC,"That is not correct. We don't have clocked speeds for all of them. So, we have to rely on indirect comments from other characters.  Starrk was easily able to Sonido away from Ichigo and Zaraki when they tried to cut him. Starrk's speed was also great enough that he could dodge all of Shunsui's attacks and, overall, was getting the jump on Love, Rose, Shunsui, and Ukitake. So, Starrk's speed is above average.   Zommari was faster than Byakuya. Byakuya is renowned for his speed. So, Byakuya's speed is definitely well above an average Captain's.   Ulquiorr has no speed feats. Being faster than Ichigo while Ichigo was unable to draw out his Zanpakuto's powers, is not a speed feat. It doesn't help to be faster than someone who is slow or average."

bleach,381i72,Yusumay,2,Tue Jun 2 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"Even though Ichigo couldn't draw out his Zanpakutos power, he was still faster than every captain, except probably yama, (If he wasn't, his bankais speed boost would be redundant.) whilst Hollowfied.  Yet Ulquiorra still outsped him, Even in his base form. And even when Ichigo went into full Hollowfication, Ulquiorra could still react to Him much better than Ichigo could react to Ulquiorra after he released Murcielago.  If Zommamari was faster than Ulquiorra, he could have just speedblitzed Byakuya without any effort at all."
bleach,381i72,Temperatia,2,Tue Jun 2 06:03:34 2015 UTC,"Hollowification doesn't offer much of a speed boost.  Ichigo was having trouble with more than just using Bankai. When Rukia first came back to Karakura Town, she made him fight a regular Hollow and he was having trouble with that.  His Inner Hollow would try to take over at any time, not just while in Bankai. So, it's not like he was just in the SS arc again when he could fight Zaraki with Shikai. If he was, he would have enough spiritual power to cut Nnoitora.   Ichigo's power and speed wasn't just capped at Shikai. His whole power level went down. Which means his Shunpo was weaker/slower."

bleach,37zjnb,kwamzilla,5,Mon Jun 1 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yamamoto's Bankai was so powerful because he had such a large reiatsu. Someone with a comparable reiatsu should be able to accomplish something similar in Bankai.  As far as range goes, Ichibei's Bankai was able to take darkness from way out in Rukongai. Then it even reached into the future and stole darkness from there. Ichibei's Bankai isn't based on attacking like Yamamoto's, but it's abilities are even more ridiculous."
bleach,37zjnb,kwamzilla,4,Sun May 31 20:42:04 2015 UTC,I wonder....  if hitsugaya was his age and had his level of experience who would win?
bleach,37zjnb,uchihaizen,5,Sun May 31 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"Theoretically if Toshi was that age and level, he would be the same but the opposite end of the thermometer... He'd basically have Rukia's bankai as a side effect of his power."
bleach,37zjnb,Perpetualjoke,5,Sun May 31 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"It would produce more ice but ice doesn't need colder temperatures to exist.   Hitsugaya has power over ICE not cold.   Rukia has power over Cold,  not ice."

bleach,37zjnb,Teamkilleryo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"exactly, that's why nothing around hitsu freezes over or starts to grow frost on it, rukia every time she releases her sword freezes over the environment she's in"
bleach,37zjnb,angryspacemahreen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:08:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, why are you assuming hitsugaya's bankai would get colder because of more experience/reiatsu? Yamamoto's bankai would melt through everything, especially hitsugaya's ice"

bleach,37zcne,Achima,6,Sun May 31 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"I posted this in a thread some time ago  Bleach: Soul Ressurection was pretty good, the story took place from when Ichigo goes to Hueco mundo up until the end of the arrancar arc.The game play is nice, but the real downer is a lack of a multiplayer or a standard battle mode. Instead we get Story, Mission mode and Soul attack. Mission mode contained a variety of missions that could unlock new characters, the later ones were actually pretty challenging. Soul attack was just survival and time attack modes. Along with the limited character roster which was pretty decent. What really gets me is that the PSP games like Heat The Soul 7 have double if not triple the characters. Id say you should pick it up for a discounted price as its not amazing, but a gem among others."
bleach,37zcne,Pwntastic411,3,Sun May 31 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"Heat the Soul 7 all the way. The storyline follows the anime, and the special moves are just cool as fuck. In tag team battles, certain characters have special combos together, like Hiyori and Shinji's hilarious slipper-slapped combo and Renji and Ishida's Sprenger trap combo.   Oh yeah, unlike HtS 6 you get Segunda Etapa Ulquiorra and Fully Hollowfied Ichigo."

bleach,380uqu,Temperatia,2,Wed Jun 3 00:42:36 2015 UTC,"Quincy show up, kill Sasakibe (this deeply angers Yamamoto) then Quincy leave.   Quincy show up again, they're called the Wandenreich, they've been living in a world they created inside Soul Society's shadows for 1000 years. Their leader is named Yhwach, he was born deaf/blind/dumb, but has the ability to loan out pieces of his soul to people. When the person with his soul fragment dies, all of their knowledge and power return to Yhwach. The Quincy are a race of people created by Yhwach loaning out his soul fragments. So, all of the Wandenreich follow him believing that he can kill them by ripping out the soul fragment within them. Uryu joins the Wandenreich, but his intentions aren't clear.  1000 years ago, Yhwach tried to attack Soul Society and the Royal Realm. Yamamoto gathered 13 of the most powerful Shinigami and led them to defeat Yhwach and his Quincy. Those 13 people (mostly criminals) became the first 13 Captains of the Gotei 13 and replaced Seireitei's old military. Yhwach was sealed away at the end of their battle.  Yhwach's seal has been released and he has been observing Soul Society from the shadows in the previous years to gather information for waging war on them. In the first attack, the Wandenreich steals the Bankai of four Captains, decimates Soul Society, and kill Yamamoto.  Ichigo, Byakuya, Renji, and Rukia go to the Royal Realm to receive special training that will allow them to fight against the Quincy in the next invasion that they know will come. Shunsui is appointed Captain Commander after Yamamoto's death. Shunsui tell Unohana (one of the original 13 Captains) to battle Kenpachi so that he reaches his full power and becomes a real Kenpachi. Zaraki kills Unohana and attains his full power (and Shikai) Now the title of Kenpachi has been passed down to him by Unohana, the previous Kenpachi.  The second invasion begins. Ichigo, Rukia, Renji, and Byakuya quickly finish their training to return to Seireitei and help fight. Seireitei has been sucked into the shadows and the Wandenreich's Quincy city is there in its place.   More battling. Even after increasing their powers and even with the help of the RG training, Soul Society is still losing the war. Ichigo broke through the Royal Realm's barriers to make it back to Seireitei. Yhwach takes advantage of this and using the hole left in the barriers to enter the Royal Palace.  Yhwach and the Quincy he brought with him lay siege to the Royal Palace and kill the Soul King. Urahara comes to Seireitei, gets Ichigo+ChadHime+Yoruichi+Ganju to the Royal Realm. The world starts to fall apart now that the Soul King is dead. Ichigo and his friends can't do anything to stop Yhwach. Yhwach absorbs the Soul King and starts to recreate Soul Society and the Royal Realm.   Urahara uses royal artifacts from the Shihoun clan to open a gateway into the Royal Realm. Also, Yoruichi uses some device to have Grimmjow and Nel open a Garganta into the Royal Realm. Now Ichigo, his nakama, Espada, the Vizards, and the Captains are assembled in Yhwach's Royal Realm.   Also, the whole reason this arc started is because Nel and Pesche asked Ichigo to come save Halibel and get the Wandenreich out of Hueco Mundo..........they never saved her. Halibel is still chained up in a room in Yhwach's old palace. Which is now down in Seireitei. Like, there's probably some random Quincy playing with Halibel's boobs because there's absolutely no one else there to stop him or notice."

bleach,37y6uk,oetsuthebest,8,Sun May 31 11:48:08 2015 UTC,"Baraggan wanted nothing more than to kill Aizen. If his Respira were capable of that, don't you think he would've tried it?"
bleach,37y6uk,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sun May 31 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"now , i don't know very well , but i think he didn't go against him because aizen showed him in an illusion how he could have killed all his fellows if he decided to go against him ... i guess that was the motive . in fact , in his last moments , he tried to kill him but died before reaching him . aizen is strong , but still a shinigami , and i think he can be killed by respira like any other one"
bleach,37y6uk,Andygoesrawr,6,Sun May 31 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"The only reason Respira is an unbeatable force is because Baraggan himself is so strong. We can't really say how strong he is, but he's not so much stronger than Sui-Feng that he can shrug off her attacks, but we know that Aizen is. So it's possible that Aizen could be unaffected by Respira or at least not as affected, and if not then Kyouka Suigetsu makes it pretty difficult for him to be killed. The same rule applies for Hachigen, who is also under Aizen's hypnosis. So that's the answer to your question."
bleach,37y6uk,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sun May 31 14:24:01 2015 UTC,"my main point anyway is the teleport , even inside one's body . hell , i can teleport anything inside someones brain and kill him with that"
bleach,37y6uk,caprexy,8,Sun May 31 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really work like that. Everything comes down to Reiatsu. A Shinigami can't cut an enemy much stronger than them, so why do you think they would be able to teleport something into their body? They would be able to send it into a cavity, but unlike Baraggan most people don't have massive holes in their bodies big enough to fit one of Hachi's arms. If the cavity isn't big enough, he wouldn't be able to teleport it there because the person's Reiatsu would resist it. If his ability uses pocket dimensions then he probably wouldn't be able to pull the object out at its target location at all.  But you've stumbled on the reason why Hachi is one of the most potentially powerful beings in the Bleach universe. If he lives for another thousand years and focuses on building his own power for a good portion of that time, he would be capable of some terrifying things."

bleach,37y6uk,Sirocco_,1 point,Sun May 31 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Barraggam possessed a cape that nullified respira. He himself was not immune to it. It's easy to assume that Aizen made his research and got himself some sort of anti-respira barrier beforehand.  Now, the inside your body is in fact a pretty nasty and unbalanced idea. The way I explain it myself is that Hachigen didn't actually put it inside his body, but rather behind the cloak. After all Baraggan didn't have a body to speak of, just bones. His hand touched those.  Otherwise we have a guy that can teleport a sword into your brain and that's pretty broken."

bleach,37x6bo,Klaphood,1 point,Sun May 31 06:19:48 2015 UTC,I feel like that's been done enough with the whole zombie thing but it is plausible. But he absorbed Mimihagi not Ukitake. It would be a stretch for him to be controlling Ukitake.
bleach,37x6bo,richiegraine,3,Sun May 31 03:46:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's more like Ukitake's soul is now bound to Mimihagi.. I mean it always was... but I mean now he's basically Mimihagi, and he's inside Bach, so maybe he's going to infiltrate his powers and help defeat him from the inside once Ichigo weakens him enough. Or it'll be Ukitake that weakens Bach, and Ichigo has to deliver the deathblow that will seemingly totally obliterate Ukitake as well..... but then maybe Kubo will make him come back, and show that he's fine, except that now he's one of the top tier gods and has to go live somewhere else for some reason because being some all-powerful god means you ain't allowed to live with the peasants."
bleach,37x6bo,stickyourpinkyinmy,3,Sun May 31 03:55:43 2015 UTC,"If I remember right Ukitake is only in dire condition/dead because Mimihagi isn't making up for the injuries of his disease. Ukitake's soul wasn't connected to Mimihagi, his body was just wrecked by it leaving."

bleach,37sip3,Zil_v_a,8,Sat May 30 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"And this is why we can't have nice things. Chad is like the Lost substitute shiningami arc personified. Seeing how popular is this opinion I guess we should blame Kubo for it after all.  So, in writing there is this concept of a supplementary character. It has a supporting role but not for the main plot, rather for the characters that drag it. Chad is the very reason why Ichigo didn't grow up as an emo, he's a strong arm that allows the other two leads to fall on somewhere when they need help. Chad is strong. He's the guy that doesn't have many problems but rather made them when he didn't control his strength. He makes us feel more for Ichigo and in the beginning of the story Chad has pretty much the role a father figure would in a usual story, but Isshin had the wrong character to fulfill it himself. He's also not the sort of a character we can personify with, he's rather the kinda dude we would like having around.  Now, why doesn't such a passive role work in bleach? Mostly because he's pretty much the only passive character in the series that has a consistent presence. The whole bleach is based on constant revelations and retroactive storytelling. New character are introduced only so that we can learn their past. Almost all the revelations and plot twists in Bleach happen when we learn someones backstory. The story of characters in bleach is ""what led me here"". It's the one story that Chad doesn't have. It happens a lot in other mangas, like FMA where pretty much everyone is about what they're doing now, rather than about what they did, with some well-written exceptions like Scar.   Now, tell me: what do you feel about Tatsuki? Her role is the same to Inoue as that of Chad to Ichigo. Case is, Tatsuki is a third-party character. One that pops-up but isn't dragged around. Chad is everywhere, but he isn't constantly needed. Especially with Renji stealing a lot of the bromance spotlight. Chad ended up in a story that evolved into something he wasn't written for, reducing him to a role of a random tank protecting the healer, so that the healer may heal up the important characters when they get beat up while the author rises the tension of a particular plotline. It's kinda a sad thing. I can't hate on Chad, personally. But I can admit that he has no qualities that make him a good one. But c'mon, how can you hate such a friendly, calm guy?"
bleach,37sip3,Zil_v_a,2,Sat May 30 10:57:39 2015 UTC,"Now, tell me: what do you feel about Tatsuki? Her role is the same to Inoue as that of Chad to Ichigo. Case is, Tatsuki is a third-party character. One that pops-up but isn't dragged around. Chad is everywhere, but he isn't constantly needed.    This is literally the issue. Let this dude chill in the background Tatsuki. By like a third of the way through each arc he becomes more of a detriment than a help."
bleach,37sip3,Zil_v_a,4,Sat May 30 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"While I love your entire opinion on Chad, I think the rpg tank / healer analogy hits extremely well on the mark. Obvious Orihime is the party healer, Chad is the tank holding aggro, Ichigo is the hybrid melee / ranged dps, Uyruu is the ranged dps, etc It fits so perfectly, never really thought about it in traditional rpg terms. Every group needs a tank, someone has to keep things off the healer & party while the dps do their thing. Perfect analogy, bravo sir."
bleach,37sip3,Temperatia,3,Sat May 30 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Except Chad is like a really shitty tank because he really only holds aggro for like 6 seconds before he gets his shit pushed in and ichigo has to ""hold aggro"" while he fights the bad guy for the next 2 episodes  Edit: also, I don't know what RPGs you've been playing, but in most of the ones I've played the tanks are one of the better solo classes. Chad just gets wrecked on his own"
bleach,37sip3,Temperatia,2,Sat May 30 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"Tanks can't kill anything. They can only live for long. At least in standard terms.  RPG analogies work very well with bleach because it truly is built like an mmo/tabletop.

bleach,37sip3,Temperatia,1 point,Sat May 30 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna start debating the fine points of tanks, but Chad still doesn't fit that description. He gets straight dunked on in only a minute or so. Almost every single time"
bleach,37sip3,Temperatia,1 point,Sat May 30 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"Chad only fights 5 times, wins 3 of them. In the rest he's just present. Usually either too weak from the previous encounter to act or around an enemy so strong he's not stupid enough to approach them.  He even survives quiet a while against Shunsui even though it was his first time in a spiritual world. So I don't know, really. It doesn't seem that he loses too much. It's rather that he doesn't even get to do anything, most of the times.  At least gives him a better score than Hitsugaya ever gets. #burn"
bleach,37sip3,-MuffinTown-,2,Sun May 31 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"Saying he survived a while against shunsui is like saying you can play a guitar just because your left hand can form 1 god damn chord. You are missing the rest of the equation. Shunsui knew the big guy wasn't shit so he chose not to attack him at all until he was certain that he couldn't convince chad to leave. And even then CHOSE not to generate enough force to outright kill him.  As far as hitsugaya goes, consider his age to his peers. Sure you can argue chads young too, but I'm speaking soul reaper to soul reaper, and human to human. Hitsugaya is hundreds (thousands?) of years younger than the other captains and still able to hold his own amongst them. On top of that he is smart as shit.While there no adult humans to compare chad to, we have humans of the same age in ichigo orihime and uryu. Ichigos the main character so of course he's stronger. Uryu may have cooler ancestors than chad but he's still human and infinitely more useful both in combat and out. Orihime may be physically weaker but the abilities to heal and place a barrier from a distance, albeit a short one, is waaay more useful than a 1 trick laser punch. She might be annoying as a person but she saves a metric asston of people and I don't care what you say, that makes her useful."
bleach,37sip3,sockmess,1 point,Sun May 31 00:18:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry you took that wrong. It was obviously a joke, Hitsugaya, even when we don't look at the lore, both fought and won more than chad. I was laughing about his every loss is full of screaming and showing-off so we kinda notice them more than we do Chad's."
bleach,37sip3,Temperatia,21,Sun May 31 09:14:12 2015 UTC,Sucks dick=shoot lasers from fist  All this time I've has super powers and not even known it.
bleach,37sip3,ElJefe10,-2,Sat May 30 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"If you can laser punch a man that is sitting down, drinking his damn Saki, and after the laser has made contact with him, not only has he not even got a burn but he still hasnt spilled not one drop of his Saki, that shit ain't worthy of being called a super power. You may as well go around throwing some teddy bear stuffing at mothafuckas."
bleach,37sip3,Lewke,20,Sat May 30 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"Meh, Chad did alright for a human teenager. Why be impressed with Ichigo and Uryu? Ichigo was trained by Urahara and Yoruichi. Uryu had a piece of ancient technology (he didn't build that glove himself)  So, it's harder to be mad at Chad when Ichigo and Uryu are only using borrowed power."
bleach,37sip3,Lewke,-2,Sat May 30 01:51:06 2015 UTC,Uryu might have had some tech but he trained himself with it. Also he had to do that gangster shit where broke it and gained what's is so far still the best costume in the series as well as an apparently significant power boost for a little while. Sure he fucked himself up doing it but at least it looked cool.  I'm just saying at least uryu learns to do new and different shit as time goes on. Chads still a one trick pony and its a pretty shitty trick when compared to anyone else's. Literally anyone else. Even orihime. Not that I like her as a character either but still.
bleach,37sip3,Narissis,5,Sat May 30 02:02:30 2015 UTC,"Uryu might have had some tech but he trained himself with it   ""trained"" The training was basically that, if he used his basic powers he would get stronger. Making a bow and shooting arrows made him stronger.  It's the final arc and Chad has never been given an opportunity like that.  Come the final arc, Uryu is powered up simply by drinking some of Yhwach's blood. So, yet another huge power up served to him on a platter.    I'm just saying at least uryu learns to do new and different shit as time goes on. Chads still a one trick pony and its a pretty shitty trick when compared to anyone else's. Literally anyone else. Even orihime. Not that I like her as a character either but still.   His powers have changed enough. He has a new arm and the old one is transformed. His running speed is fast enough that it can be mistaken for a high speed movement technique.  The problem is Kubo, not Chad."
bleach,37sip3,ParanoidMaron,-3,Sat May 30 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"I think he's just this series' equivalent of Krillin. Except, you know, with fewer abilities. And less funny. And less useful. Starts out on relatively equal footing with the hero and rapidly fades away into uselessness"
bleach,37sip3,GDKnight76,8,Sat May 30 03:02:25 2015 UTC,"Meh, it wasn't rapid. His power level was in the same league as all the nakama (Rukia, Renji, Orihime, and Uryu) up until the current time.   He was only outclassed after Rukia and Renji returned from the Royal Realm.  Though, the major point is that, while being on the same level of power as Rukia and Renji, he comes off much worse than them to the readers. Kubo refuses to write scenes for him that cast him in a positive light.   He's what is called a jobber. He just shows up to be defeated as a way to create hype for the person that gets to defeat him. Though, you could say that, by virtue of their role, jobbers must have a respectable level of power to begin with. Otherwise, there's no hype created by beating them."

bleach,37sip3,reigun91,7,Sun May 31 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"This is Shunsui we're talking about.  Would you say Ichigo's powers aren't worthy of praise just because Aizen stopped his sword with a finger one time?  This was Chad when his powers were at a nascent stage, going up against one of the strongest members of the Gotei 13. It would have been a travesty if he'd been able to scratch him."

Ichigo can't do shit against Shunsui until after he gains another major power up. Shunsui has yet to reveal Bankai, and his Bankai is said to be very dangerous. Chad could take on a Lieutenant and win, but a captain is just too much, they are the 13 power houses of the Gotei 13. You don't screw with them unless you have a death wish."

bleach,37sip3,sephtis,5,Sat May 30 02:40:06 2015 UTC,Every opponent he has fought are people that are way above his class  He had his power for 2 weeks and went against fucking SHUNSUI. Not only was he up against Shunsui but he had just wasted pretty much all of his spiritual energy taking out grunts and was basically using his life force to power his attacks. A month later he was up against someone that had a defense high enough to break yoruichis bones just from her hitting him. Not even a day later a gillian arrancar comes along.  Also chads not a main character only Ichigo fits that bill. At his best Chad is a supporting character.  Lastly I hate peoples logic that just because a character is a friend to the main character means they should automatically be granted strength. Its a really stupid shonen trope
bleach,37sip3,whitboys,4,Sat May 30 10:24:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, you know who else is pretty shitty?  Ichigo.  No no, hear me out.  Ichigo's original Zanupakto was just an oversized but otherwise somewhat normal sword.  Then he got his Shikai, which he's been stuck in ever sense. His Shikai is worse than his Zanupakto, because now he doesn't even have a guard.  ""But, but... he can fire a laser thingy now!""  Ha. Yeah, guess he can. But so can Isshin. And Urahara. And absolutely any Shinigami who's reasonably competent in Kido.  ""But... at least his Bankai is cool!""  Yeah. It's true. He gets the guard on his sword back, which is pretty damned useful. Slight speed upgrade is useful too. But that's basically all there is to it."

bleach,37sip3,stickyourpinkyinmy,11,Sat May 30 04:02:37 2015 UTC,I could say the goddamn same about Ichigo at this point.
bleach,37ug97,ChaosKeeshond,11,Sat May 30 14:19:28 2015 UTC,Because people can interpret things in more than one way.  People that can't understand/accept this have always bothered me.
bleach,37ug97,AHobbitsMousepad,5,Sat May 30 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Let's start with realizing that no arc was just about one thing.  Retroactive storytelling is the bread and butter of Bleach. It's true. So obviously the reveal of what happened back then with the lost substitute shiningami (Kubo Ginjo) was an important part of the show and a big reveal.  However the real lost substitute shiningami of the arc is Ichigo. Most of the arc, that is pretty much all the way until the last showdown against Ginjo, is about how lost Ichigo became when he lost his powers. He didn't feel attached to the world around him, having tasted great power and seen many things. But more than that, he lived in the constant fear that something bad may happen one day, probably involving hollows or other spiritual entities, and he won't be able do anything. This deep fear was what made him trust a person as shady as Ginjo even though back in the day he wouldn't trust Shinji just because the guy was too similar to him (hollow powers). It showed us desperation.   The arc was about Ichigo, the inner working of his mind and motivations, as well as the past rules of his position, his resolutions and standing towards Soul society and the other way around, speaking about how does soul society treat Ichigo.  Ah and it was also about fullbrings and Chad's powers. But that was kinda just there. They really never explored the topic."
bleach,37ug97,Zil_v_a,2,Sat May 30 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"I understand multiple storytelling threads and different interpretations of what they mean. I'm awful at getting my meaning across sometimes. When I say what I say, bear in mind that what I dislike is the reductive attitude of believing that the Fullbringers were nothing more than a simple storytelling vehicle designed to redeliver Ichigo to his destination as a soul reaper.  Had Kubo wanted to, he could simply have skipped to Ichigo having his powers back and briefly mentioned it later. ""What, you didn't think SS couldn't do for you what Rukia once did alone? Idiot.""  The arc existed because it was a story Kubo clearly genuinely felt like telling, and fans of the series shit all over it with a reductive attitude.  I guess this thread was a tad redundant here because this reddit doesn't seem to hate the Fullbringer arc with anywhere near the amount of vitriol I see on other sites, where it's practicalled thought of as filler material."
bleach,37ug97,Zil_v_a,2,Sun May 31 00:12:15 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, I understand you Soooo much. I was actually a fan of this arc to some degree. Yet everyone hates it just because they don't fight every two chapters. It's as if people outright decided that there will be nothing important in it because Bleach should have had ended."
bleach,37ug97,Balorio,3,Sun May 31 09:16:12 2015 UTC,"The arc was dual purposed. The more obvious one was to show how Ichigo regained his powers and how he felt without them.  The second purpose was, as you said - to show SS's hesitance in restoring a subsitute's power...particularly after BOTH of them ""stole"" the power to begin with, in their eyes."

One of the theories is that the Special War Powers represent the strongest individuals of each race (and for the sake of that, Ichigo would represent humans and Aizen immortals/sinners).

Now it's ""if antagonists face those entities (war potentials) they may lose"".    It's there to make us excited and await their fights. A hype train as well as a rule.

Disappearance of Yachiru is at best the middle plot point.  The arc of Sousuke Aizen ends as he loses to Ichigo. It's a very well written one, not much to be surprised about.   I love how the arc ratings look like compared to arc toplist. In the end they're all good for what they are, but when you have to pick that one you end up in a pickle. None of them are bad. I'm however surprised how low did The lost shiningami score compared to the Shiningami agent.  When put side by side, the substitute shiningami agent arc is the opening arc. There's no volume to it. It's there to make the stuff go and it does that very well. It presents us the world and the heroes, but nothing revolutionary happens. And honestly, the only manga that did the opening arc especially well that I know of would probably be Berserk.  On the other hand the lost substitute shiningami arc actually build on Ichigo and the gang. Enriched the world and fixed some holes. Well, I'll sing it off at people still being mad that Bleach didn't end with the final getsuga."
bleach,37qa8w,oetsuthebest,1 point,Fri May 29 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"And honestly, the only manga that did the opening arc especially well that I know of would probably be Berserk.   Hmmm... how about Fullmetal Alchemist?  Does FMA even have ""arcs"" in the usual sense, though? I mean... the entire plot from start to finish is so well-paced and evenly laid that reading through the whole manga almost feels like a single long arc."
bleach,37qa8w,reigun91,1 point,Fri May 29 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, it has arcs. You can see them when you look closely, but they are way better in construction. You don't get ""dungeons"" like in bleach.  The FMA opening arc is quiet the little trick. You see, it doesn't have an opening arc. Honestly. It has a prologue like in a book instead. They screw up, lose this and that, become state alchemist and you don't realize when the story got past the beginning. It does give you some limits. This way you essentially show your protagonists backstory before you being the main plot. So you can't just build up so much on revelations like bleach does.   It kinda shows that FMA is better written than Bleach. I mean, Inoue and Sado got no backstory to speak of more than two sentences and look how hated they are. It really feels like the main attraction in bleach is the character arc and it's backstory. FMA had none of that, it was almost always on point with the main storyline."

Yhwach is third on the list because the share of people who thought he was the most powerful is smaller than the share of people who thought Ichigo or Aizen were the most powerful.

bleach,37t50i,lowmodality,3,Sat May 30 04:30:16 2015 UTC,"I'm only going to comment about the Bount Arc it's been a while since I watched it but I vaguely remember some things I liked about it. Like you said I like how it separated the SS arc and Arrancar arc making it seem like more time had passed to give Aizen time to build his army, making it seem like it didn't happen over night like you said. One thing I really liked thought was something Kariya said to Ichigo. While they were fighting he said something along the lines of Ichigo not fighting to kill his opponent and that he'd never win/survive that way, when Ichigo realized he was right he fought to kill him and won. I liked this part because I always felt Ichigo was never fighting to kill in the canon episodes and it kind of bothered me. I really liked the character Maki Ichinose(Maki Maki). I can't really remember him that well but from what I remember I liked his character and really liked his zankpaktou. That's all I can really remember but as a whole I didn't hate the Bount arc and feel like it shouldn't get as much hate as it does."
bleach,37t50i,hangemhigh420,3,Sat May 30 06:30:52 2015 UTC,"I actually think the event you're describing (Kariya lecturing Ichigo on his reluctance to kill his enemies) took place in the Arrancar arc, when Ichigo was being tormented by his past foes (Byakuya, Kenpachi and Kariya) during his Vizard training with Hollow Ichigo.   Which is another positive, that in treating the Bount arc as canon given its placement between two arcs, they didn't immediately ignore it as soon as they returned to canon, but rather embraced it as an integral part of the story. That and the Bount tracking Mod Souls later fought against some of Aizen's Arrancars when they arrived in Karakura Town."
bleach,37t50i,aizen6,2,Sat May 30 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"The only issue I have with filler arcs is that they often blur the power levels against what is held canon. Not that I mind having the focus shifting to different characters, but showing a character like Inaba Kageroza take out the likes of Yama-jii could have been avoided.  Like you said, filler arcs help adjust to the timeline in the main story, and that's an important thing, when you're looking at powerups and battle strategies. It would make more sense to show a filler arc and then revert to the main storyline, and ""Ichigo/someone else got his powerup through training in the meantime""."
bleach,37t50i,KENSEIISHOTAF,2,Sat May 30 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"That was actually one of the things I found so much fault with the Reigai filler. A 3rd Seat guy taking out the Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13? Even Aizen admitted he wouldn't be able to defeat Yamamoto on his own so he had to nullify his powers with Wonderweiss, but I guess Inaba is just too hax. The abilities of his Zanpakuto also fluctuated between episodes, so there was no consistency to it either. A really poorly written character."

bleach,37swhe,water_warrior,9,Sat May 30 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"Most of the Gotei 13 are not very proficient with Kido. This is because they specialize in combating Hollows. Killing a Hollow with a Zanpakuto is the only way to move their soul to Soul Society. So, a Gotei member's main focus is fighting with their Zanpakuto. Kido can only be a supplementary skill for them.  As for Shunpo. It seems that reflexive speed is different than the speed of movement you can achieve with Shunpo. Meaning, even if you can move behind someone more quickly than they can follow, that doesn't mean you'll be able to cut them down before they sense you and dodge or parry your attack.  So, having faster Shunpo doesn't guarantee that you'll get your attacks off in time."

Living aside Hadou (cast time, accuracy), using the Rikujokoro or the Hainawa may be useful against regular hollows, even Menos. Using against powerful shinigamis, quincies or espadas, I think the shinigami wouldn't have time to cast it and the enemy would probably avoid them because of his speed (Ichigo, Soi Fong, Byakuya and of course Yoruichi)."

They don't need another problem since they have so much on their hands already. Better to have Aizen play along.   Besides, it's not like he is completely useless in the chair. Anyway, I doubt that they will restrain him forever. They will probably need his full power to match Juha. Until then, it's best if they have some control over Aizen. He is too unpredictable."
bleach,37ps1n,Sirocco_,2,Fri May 29 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"What I didn't exactly understand is why Kubo dragged Aizen out of the prison only to not take him into the castle. It's kinda a tease, maybe even a quick take to rise in the popularity charts and have some overseers bugger off.   I mean, at the moment it has pretty much no meaning. He sits there looking at nothing and being slightly vulnerable. At least more than he would be in the prison.   My understanding is that in case Shunsui dies, he rips the keys from himself and throws them down to Aizen for a final solution.  Speaking about that, I don't like the argument of ""they don't know what Aizen wants"" anymore.  It's clear that Aizen is not a bad guy because otherwise Kubo would have them simply ask hundreds of chapters ago. We still have no idea what he wanted before he got mugetsu on his face. We only know how he wanted to get it. It's becoming sort of annoying."

However, making Aizen the soul king is more dangerous than many readers first assumed.  While this soul king seems to have degraded to a state of inaction, Yhwach has clearly shown that whoever serves as ""soul king"" can remake the world into the image they desire.  What image does Aizen have in mind, and how would it affect the Gotei or the human world?  Something tells me Shunsui is keeping Aizen locked down until he can obtain the necessary leverage to ensure that Aizen's vision for the future world more or less returns things to the status quo.    How you enforce that agreement after the fact, I have no idea.  I don't think Aizen was merely teased, however."

bleach,37khyg,Eaglezzz,23,Thu May 28 13:07:40 2015 UTC,Senpai has noticed me... :'3
bleach,37khyg,DatBankai,19,Thu May 28 15:03:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't count him out just yet. Let's take what Shunsui said in literal terms meaning Ukitake isn't physically there.
bleach,37khyg,Alluka-,3,Thu May 28 09:37:22 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely reaching with this, but you know how his shikai allowed him to absorb enemy energy and turn it against them? What if his bankai allows him to store his life energy/consciousness over time into a new vessel? Sort of like a gigai but with full capabilities, like a phoenix or some shit. That'd be legit."
bleach,37khyg,yourpants,2,Thu May 28 14:28:14 2015 UTC,I have a theory that Ukitake is the mastermind villain behind all the events in bleach... and recent events have played right into that theory
bleach,37khyg,sly_big_guy,2,Thu May 28 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"It's so fucking annoying because it's like Kubo is deliberately keeping us in the dark about Ukitake. There are so many ways to interpret this. ""If he were here right now"" could mean he's dead because that's what people often say about dead people, it sounds somehow less scay and awkward than ""If he hadn't died"". But at the same time, it could mean he's simply either not here or unable to join. Yet where is Ukitake right now? I don't think he's that far away from the others in the group. So maybe it simply means he's not conscious yet, but not dead either. Yet the Soul King is dead, so how did that affect Mimihagi and Ukitake? Damn, so many questions  Edit: besides - did you see Kiyone and Sentarous' faces in the next panel? They looked far too composed. I always imagined that if Ukitake happened to die, these two would go mad with sorrow and commit suicide right there and then or something like that, they practically worship Ukitake. No way they could be so calm about this if they thought he was dead."
bleach,37khyg,Sunjammer0037,3,Thu May 28 21:38:35 2015 UTC,His circumstances will more than likely be explained soon. There are a lot of different plot points that need addressing at the moment. I really doubt he's dead though.
bleach,37khyg,Alluka-,12,Thu May 28 22:00:04 2015 UTC,I'm so confused - didn't Kubo say that Ukitake was going to recover from his illness or something?  Unless Kubo has a very strange definition of 'getting better'
bleach,37khyg,Peregrine21591,10,Thu May 28 09:56:03 2015 UTC,"It's like we're back in Deathspank 2, where illnesses are cured by just killing off anyone ill. World hunger is cured in a similar way."
bleach,37khyg,Ryuuzoji,3,Thu May 28 11:13:35 2015 UTC,Have you ever heard anyone complaining about being dead?  No?  I rest my case.
bleach,37khyg,fwipyok,3,Thu May 28 16:15:50 2015 UTC,"He did recover from his illness. We just didn't get to see him do anything after that, and then he died."
bleach,37khyg,ElModeloEnPace,2,Thu May 28 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Ukitake's death (if it indeed happened) feelsy. It just sort of happened with no emphasis whatsoever. Also, from the look of it his sacrafice totally went in vain unless he - somehow - manages to fuck up Bach from the inside."

bleach,37khyg,viatoretvenus,59,Thu May 28 11:13:47 2015 UTC,"I like this chapter. Not one of them took a single step, except Yuushirou, who almost hurt himself doing so, but I think we got a fair bit of ""trivia"" type information in this chap.    Yoruichi remarks that she would not have divulged the information about her own brother to just anyone unless they were extremely close, like her fiance (wait... Urahara and Soi-Fon know, so does that mean-- (gets shot)), reasserting the fact that Noble Families are extremely private and tight-knit. Heck, not just from the Shihouin Clan, but the Shiba clan as well. Another example is back in the Soul Society Arc, where Yoruichi didn't even know Shiba Ganju was Shiba Kuukaku's brother, despite Yoruichi and Kuukaku being friends.  The Soul King can control the reishi density of the atmosphere in the Soul Palace. Now this is more impactful as compared to simply changing the landscape, in last weeks chap. The shinigami are literally fighting on the Quincies' home ground, where their reishi arrows are gonna be much more powerful and easier to form. It won't make sense for Ichibee and co. to work with Yhwach now and ""protect the current Soul King"", since Yhwach has his stronger elite guard that are made even stronger with the dense reishi atmosphere. Unless they are truly devoted to that duty, or doing it out of desperation to not be executed by the new SK, then maybe, but still I find it unlikely with this change. Kyouraku mentioned Ukitake. I think that may be all we will ever hear about Ukitake, for a long time. Seems he has accepted his friend's fate. Hardcore. Bazz-B and other Sternritters missing. Did only the shinigami get through? The doors are even closed. Where'd they go? Aizen really still is downstairs in Seireitei :( The comedy with Yoruichi and Ichigo and co. was sweet."

bleach,37n7q1,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Thu May 28 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"I personally think Kubo plays a TTRPG like D&D or Pathfinder. You see, in these games powerful Wizards (i.e. Tessai and Hachi) are pretty much game breaking by virtue of what they can do (which is basically anything they need to at any given point in time).  It doesn't make for a very compelling story when the group's Wizard uses Finger of Death and instantly kills the BBEG. In fact, it's pretty anti-climactic so TK has to sideline these characters or inexplicably relegate them to uselessness (i.e. DM Fiat). Either way, it ends up being a no-win situation from a storytelling standpoint."

Also a small thing to clarify. Time stop doesn't actually stop time, it stops ""your time"". Let's say you're bleeding to death, or transforming into a hollow. A time stop will stop you from doing anything, from breathing to dying. It's kinda the ultimate stun."

bleach,37m24v,Sirocco_,13,Fri May 29 12:53:09 2015 UTC,"If I could do it from the start...  . Shinigami wouldn't have weird technology - The way spiritual particles work on Seireitei would make any kind of sophisticated  hightech apparatus completely useless. The 12th division would use spells, curses and more arcane methods to research things. Soi Fon's bankai would be some kind of ancient cannon, not a missile. BG9 would be something like this, not a robot. And NO. FUCKING. CELLPHONES.  . The ""afterlife"" would be a mirror of our own world (without hightech, like I said before), and as big as our planet - Seireitei would be just a small part of it, the Japanese equivalent of the other side. Maybe I would add some story arcs exploring other parts of this world, but that sounds like filler :P. Maybe a sidestory after the series end.  . Romance. There would be romance. - No lovey-dovey characters, but Ichigo and Rukia would be in love (or Ichigo and Orihime, hell, Ichigo and Dondochaka even), in a mature relationship. This series is a coming of age of a boy. He will find his significant other and that will be relevant to the plot (thats why I tend to choose Rukia as the love interest, since she would be a good reason for Ichigo to go to SS).    . More 'traditional' races - No need to call them hollows: they are akuma, or maybe youkai (but we keep the masks, they're cool). No need to call them Quincies: they are Onmyouji. And their powers have poetic japanese names, no bronken spanish or bronken german.  . You don't call out your attacks - The only moment you need to yell something during battle is when you release your shikai or bankai. Or when you are reciting a kidou spell. Maybe, if your attack is impressive enough, people will give it a cool name, but that's rare and definitely doesn't make your attack stronger.  . Shinigami rarely enter the human world - Ocurrences like hollows (or akuma) killing human souls are pretty rare, and there's no need to assign a shinigami for every city to deal with it. However, from time to time, a particular area in the human world is overflowing with reiatsu, and that makes the creation of hollows (akuma) from human souls possible. There would be a difference between common reiatsu (that the shinigami use) and a black, tainted reiatsu (the akuma version). When a soul has more black reiatsu, it starts to turn into akuma. The 13th division specializes in hunting and killing akuma, and researches the black reiatsu and it's effects. They are responsible for monitoring the areas of the world where akuma can appear, and that's why Rukia was at Karakura Town (the high-reiatsu area during the time). Also, going from the afterlife to the human world and vice-versa is quite difficult (it's only possible once a month, during a particular phase of the moon, for example).  There are more things I'd like to change, but it would take me all day to write them out. I wish I had the time and willpower to write fanfiction..."
bleach,37m24v,assertiveguy,11,Thu May 28 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"You know, I find the use of other languages in Bleach to be one of the manga's appeals.

bleach,37m24v,smallchristmaslights,4,Thu May 28 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"That would work for me, too. I just don't like the bronken use of languages. And that's coming from someone that doesn't speak german, so I'm not that affected by the poor choice of words."

bleach,37m24v,reigun91,8,Thu May 28 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"I would never write in so many characters. With a cast this huge, it's impossible to give them all the screentime and the backstory they deserve, and whenever Kubo chooses to focus on one character's development or a particular part of the story there are always people left unsatisfied. I imagine it's hard for him too, keeping track of all ongoing events with different people.  And the power levels; considering the fact Ichigo lost his powers twice since the Arrancar arc, I think Yhwach would have been formidable enough with just his quicy powers + The Almighty  P.S. See how I used that semicolon? Was that right? I wish to learn."
bleach,37m24v,Direktorman,13,Thu May 28 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"This is probably the general consensus, but I disagree entirely. Bleach probably has the same number of characters as Naruto and definitely has fewer characters than One Piece. Yet, no one complains about those series having too many characters.  Part of the problem is that Bleach just has way too many cool character designs. They're also more fleshed out and we have a greater connection to them. This has warped our perception of them.  I would reduce the importance of some characters in the story, and kill off way more important characters. Byakuya should've stayed dead for instance, and Hitsugaya wouldn't have gotten so much screen time in the very beginning if we were just going to Worf his damn character the remainder of the series.   That brings me to the next problem. He Worfs like everyone every new arc. It gets old really quickly, and I wish he would stop.   I imagine it's hard for him too, keeping track of all ongoing events with different people.   Finally this is the crux of his problems as a story teller. He has this dumb desire to make every chapter into a cliff hanger. It means he cuts away from important events and fights, and you never get fully satisfied with what's going on. When he switches over you're busy caring more about what's happening with the other characters."
bleach,37m24v,ElModeloEnPace,5,Thu May 28 18:42:29 2015 UTC,I think that you are completely right on the character design for Bleach. Characters in Naruto have such plain attire and looks when compared to characters in Bleach.
bleach,37m24v,smallchristmaslights,5,Thu May 28 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Bleach probably has the same number of characters as Naruto and definitely has fewer characters than One Piece.   Oh, I had no idea, I've never read either of them. I guess I was out of my element speaking about the number of characters then, sorry.  And I agree on your other points, Kubo needs to either learn to let go of his characters or give them decent fights so they can justify the fact they keep surviving."
bleach,37m24v,Direktorman,5,Thu May 28 18:56:40 2015 UTC,I would add more character development and interaction so there could be more depth between them. Remove a few characters like that guy Uryu defeats in the SS arc. He could've been replaced with a vice-captain like Iba to develop him. It also would've made more sense because Uryu was just defeating fodder characters then he jumped to defeating a captain. It would've been a more gradual increase in the power of his opponents like Ichigo experienced. Remove Grimmjow's fracción that only said a few lines of dialogue. Remove Menoly; one of them is enough and Loly has a release and talked more so keep her. Remove a few more characters I can't think of off the top of my head.
bleach,37m24v,EspadaPrimera,3,Thu May 28 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"Remove a few characters like that guy Uryu defeats in the SS arc. He could've been replaced with a vice-captain like Iba to develop him. It also would've made more sense because Uryu was just defeating fodder characters then he jumped to defeating a captain.   Yeah, that was weird. And the worst part is that the guy he defeated actually could have some good backstory, too - he was Jidanbo's brother. But the four giant guardians that protected Seireitei never showed up again since Aizen's betrayal...  It would've been better to have Iba fight Uryuu. But, to be fair, he did won a fight against a lieutenant before fighting Mayuri (if you count Mayuri sacrificing Nemu as a victory, that is)."
bleach,37m24v,assertiveguy,3,Thu May 28 19:01:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really count it as a victory personally. That reminds me though. Did the 3 other guardians ever get shown like in a databook or something?

bleach,37m24v,Narissis,3,Thu May 28 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, I would use the current plot arc to stage a massive event with catastrophic casualties in order to shrink the cast size.  I would wrap up the story with Yhwach and the Quincies, have the now-smaller Gotei 13 begin to pick up the pieces, and then move the story back to Karakura Town for a nice epilogue arc where we see some character progression and spiritual emergence for Ichigo's sisters and friends.  Then I'd wrap it up. This thing's gone on long enough already.  If I still retained my skills and status at that point, I would do a new series of my own design set in a post-apocalyptic steampunkish future."
bleach,37m24v,renlytargaryen,6,Thu May 28 23:18:28 2015 UTC,"Well if I could start the series over from scratch Ichigo and his human friends wouldn't even be in the picture. The series would focus on Renji, Rukia, Kira, etc. as they rise through the ranks of the Gotei 13, and there wouldn't be a single ""hero"" of the story the way Ichigo is now.  For me the relationships among the seated officers and divisions within the Gotei 13 have always been fascinating. I love the fact that some captains outright despise each other and there's even tensions within the divisions themselves (think Byakuya and Renji during SS Arc). Kubo easily could've made the Gotei 13 some united nakama force, which would've been ridiculously boring. The Gotei 13 also has such a rich and complicated history that would be more fleshed out if the Gotei 13 itself was the sole focus of the series.  Removing Ichigo from the story also adds to the drama, because let's face it we know he's going to save the day no matter how Bleach ends (and to be fair, removing the main protagonist from most shonen series would make them infinitely more interesting). The officers of the Gotei 13 being forced to work together is much more compelling if there's a chance of it actually working."
bleach,37m24v,MetaAmbience,1 point,Thu May 28 20:18:52 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you. I've always thought that a prequel series would be interesting because of the lack of Ichigo and co.

bleach,37m24v,waxonwhackoff,2,Fri May 29 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"Posting late 'cause automod's a filthy Vandenreich sympathizer.  Ch. 1  From the beginning, because at this point Bleach is just a great big beautiful mess:  More high school supernatural hijinks, in a mystery/horror style. Supernatural murder mysteries, possessions, hauntings, apparitions. Keep the focus on a Karakura High gang. One of the characters, either Tatsuki, Chizuru, Keigo or Mizuiro would die and become a ghost, leading to a much more in-depth exploration of the afterlife on Earth.  Encounters with the afterlife beyond Earth would be rare and momentous, invariably a major ""shit's going down"" moment.  They wouldn't be shinigami, but rather psychopomps, and they wouldn't be ambiguously Japanese. Their dress and architecture would be a mishmash of several dead cultures, and I'd give them literal names in the style of Exalted, e.g. Swan, Panther, Harmonious Jade, etc. Also, no milieu-breaking schizotech.  Explore why Namek Ghost Mexico Hueco Mundo is a desert with no sun.  Explain the fucking spirit physics and keep them consistent.  Make a bigger deal out of Orihime's Santen Kesshun obviously being a variation upon or related to the Negación.  Make the arcs sufficiently personal to the Karakura gang. Saving the world is boring without an emotional stake in the game. The Soul Society arc was good at this. Rukia had great chemistry with Ichigo, and when her life was threatened I genuinely felt concern. From there the conflict just gets increasingly abstract until we arrive at the present arc, which I'm really following out of curiosity more than emotional investment.  For example, I'd introduce the Quincy arc in the following way either as its own arc or during the time skip. After learning about his father's history, Ichigo would get curious and investigate his mother's side of the family, leading to globetrotting and an encounter with the Wandenreich. The Reich would learn that there are still surviving Quincies in Japan, which would lead them back to Karakura town. I'm sure they'd take a very close interest in Ichigo's sisters. Boom, personal conflict.  Tone down the powerlevels and cut out the flying bullshit. Either draw actual sword fights or don't give 99% of the characters swords. In a similar vein, give Ichigo powers more interesting than sword lasers.  Less emphasis on most of the extended cast but further development of specific characters therein. Ryūken should be given a more thorough treatment (I refuse to believe that Karakura Hospital is covered in Quincy crosses for any other reason than to act as barriers to prevent hollows from eating the ghosts of trauma ward patients), as should the relationship between him, Isshin and Kisuke. Further, they should be responsible adults and actually look out for the children. Like how Yoruichi accompanied them into Soul Society, but all the time. One of the adults should be watching from the wings for most of the kids' early adventures, even if this is only revealed after the fact and the kids are unaware at the time.  In the same line of thought, I'd tie up what seems to be a frustrating loose end in canon. The final fight with Grand Fisher, if it can even be called that, was the most horrible anticlimax. That plot thread is not resolved. So, Ch. Headcanon  Finally, plot twists which conform to narrative logic. All necessary exposition should be completed before the arc reaches its climax. We should not be learning new things for the very first time during the final battle. Everything that happens needs to have been foreshadowed. It doesn't need to be obvious, in fact not all of it should be obvious, but it must be there. For example, it was completely unfair to the reader to pull the twist at the end of the Soul Society arc without first informing us that illusions like the one Aizen was employing were possible. We didn't have to know that he had that power, but we should have been told that powers like that were a thing.  ilu kubo, I just wish you'd planned ahead more thoroughly"

All of the Gotei and Ichigo's group would storm the castle, fight their way through and, when it looked like they were going to win, Yhwach would destroy the world and rebuild it all anew, making him the god of everything. He would sit alone on top of his tower. Using his newfound powers, he would turn the entire human race into his army, giving them all quincy powers, and make Ichigo and co. heretics. Everybody would be forced to choose to go into hiding or kill the human race to survive. Ichigo would go off on a new training regiment one final time and learn a final powerup, everybody else would gather up and storm the castle, taking out a the Royal Guard as Ywhach's final guardians. Yhwach is forced to kill everybody on earth to gather his power back and fight everybody off. Ichigo shows up and we have one final fight. In the end, Rukia dies to save Ichigo, Ichigo finally takes control of all of his powers and absorbs the lives of the human race from him and gives them back. Ichigo kills Yhwach finally and gives his life to rebuild the world the way it was, unbinding the world from the need of a soul king.

bleach,37ltzb,risunokairu,8,Fri May 29 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"We don't know where Kubo will go with that, yet. He might decide to bring them back. It's worth mentioning that the situation for Toshiro is different than the one for Rose and Kensei, since they were already dead when they were turned to zombies, while Toshiro was still alive"
bleach,37ltzb,Direktorman,4,Thu May 28 16:01:33 2015 UTC,I know Rose definitely had to be dead but are you sure Kensei was?
bleach,37ltzb,Direktorman,6,Thu May 28 16:15:24 2015 UTC,Here Gremmy states that he killed them and you can clearly see Kensei
bleach,37ltzb,Vlaid,14,Thu May 28 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"Here's some interesting info:  Mayuri accurately guesses Giselle's powers of Zombification as saying that when a person who is zombified by her has red-skin, it's because of the amount of blood required to reach the heart is much larger than normal. Having a higher reiatsu is what causes this ""process"" to require blood. (This is why Ikkaku wasn't immediately zombified even though he got blood on him).  Mayuri even recently mentioned (when discussing reiatsu restriction to everyone with regards to Aizen) that Shinigami constantly release reiatsu until they die.    We also know Kensei and Rose  both have red-skin in their zombified forms. We also know they were supposedly killed by Gremmy. If Gremmy killing them was a true statement (or if the effects of Gremmy's imagination last beyond his death), why would two dead captains have any reiatsu left to force Giselle's blood to work so hard for the effect?   Not only that, but we were also informed that Shinigami who are zombified while still alive retain much more of their speed and power than Shinigami who were zombified post-mortem. Given how quickly Kensei decimated Pepe in Vollstandig, I would say that he retained a great deal of his power.   So I think they're going to be brought back using some explanation from Mayuri like: ""They never really died. I can revive Arrancar because (Bleach-magic), but I can't do that for Shinigami. Luckily, that big, lumbering imbecile (pointing at Kenpachi) disposed of that child with an over-active imagination."""
bleach,37ltzb,Direktorman,6,Thu May 28 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's an amazing analysis, thank you. I honestly forgot the details of how Giselle's powers work, but, with what you said, all signs point to them being alive, which is great news.  And now that I think about it, I don't believe the effects of Gremmy's imagination last after his death. Didn't the ""battlefield"" he created for him and Kenpachi crumble after he died?"
bleach,37ltzb,Alluka-,2,Thu May 28 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Technically that child with an over-active imagination killed himself, but that's beside the point :).  I really think Mayuri might be up to something. Kubo could simply be using his personality as a means to make us think this and have him not be up to anything at all though."
bleach,37ltzb,infernus-hell,1 point,Thu May 28 21:17:54 2015 UTC,Thats a pretty thought out analysis. I think that may indeed be the case.
bleach,37ltzb,umbreon120,2,Fri May 29 09:22:11 2015 UTC,However since when Gremmy stops thinking about it. It goes back to normal like yachiro's arm went back to normal after it was a cookie. So maybe kensei and Rose turned back into their previous states.
bleach,37ltzb,Direktorman,4,Thu May 28 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I certainly hope so. I'm just saying, the last we've seen them, they were dead.  Edit: I've realized that I basically wrote: ""They're dead, but I hope they get better soon."" Gotta love Bleach"
bleach,37ltzb,Zil_v_a,5,Thu May 28 16:39:49 2015 UTC,"I need back Rose. Forever. Bleach isn't as fabulous with out him. (he is fucking fabulous, m'kay?)"
bleach,37ltzb,seratheanos,3,Thu May 28 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"Toshiro is either coming back or was supposed to come back. Thing is, he was said to have a new level of ban-kai and yet we have only seen a single wing of the new form. Then the zombie thing happened.  About the rest I have absolutely no clue. You know, if Kubo is really pressed to finish bleach, then the castle deathmatch might be just the last of it. Even though we have a lot of hooks to keep the story going."
bleach,37ltzb,Entershikari,3,Thu May 28 23:07:32 2015 UTC,"Rose can't be dead; we haven't even seen his Bankai's final ability, ""Death of a Hero"". And yes too goddamn cool to die....please don't be dead"

bleach,37ltzb,Houeclipse,1 point,Fri May 29 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"Even if Kensei and Rose are not revived, Toshiro surely will be. He is just loved too much by the readers to kill him off before the final battle. And even Kensei's and Rose's death was too sudden. They just have to have some role in the final battle even if its through some special powers only zombies turn out to have."
bleach,37nhia,Zil_v_a,7,Thu May 28 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"Do you mean Sui-Feng saying ""Even if we did get into the Soul King's palace I doubt we'd be able to see him""? If so, it's a mistranslation. It actually says ""Even if we were to try breaking into the Soul King's palace, I doubt we'd be able to feel the Soul King's Reiatsu at all."""
bleach,37nhia,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Thu May 28 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"So , we're back to Aizen's cocoon era levels of power? or it's more referring to the shinigami losing their detection abilities in the soul palace?"
bleach,37nhia,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Fri May 29 02:14:39 2015 UTC,"The context is that they can't feel the Soul King's Reiatsu. Sui-Feng says that since they can't feel any of it at all, it's unlikely that even if they entered the main palace they would feel it. Which means he's dead.  I don't particularly understand the reasoning, because I can't see why the Soul King would have a detectable Reiatsu. His power reaches every corner of the universe, so wouldn't his Reiatsu be felt everywhere?  I'll just put it down to Sui-Feng's ignorance. It's not like she would've ever been to Reioukyuu before."
bleach,37nhia,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri May 29 04:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the thing. So it was Sui-Feng who said that? I've got memory span of a goldfish. Thanks for clarifying."
bleach,37nhia,reigun91,1 point,Fri May 29 09:08:04 2015 UTC,"Well, Quincies absorb Reishi, so they are not easy to detect as it is. If you remember when Ichigo fought Sternritter J, Orihime made mention that they couldn't detect him because of the aforementioned reason I stated. But this is only I guess, andy would probably have a better idea than I."
bleach,37mk5c,wolve99,7,Thu May 28 18:51:34 2015 UTC,I think he was intending to kill the soul king and revert the 'realms' back to the previous state? I'm not really sure if Ichigo actually killed the soul king or if Yhwach absorbing him did... seems a little unclear.  Mimigami interupted Yhwach unexpectedly though then Yhwach said he was going to absorb them both. There's theorys that Mimigami did something to Yhwach to change his mind.
bleach,37mk5c,mindseye84,3,Thu May 28 20:02:44 2015 UTC,if anything by absorbing mimihagi yhwach gained more omniscience
bleach,37mk5c,ajjuha,4,Fri May 29 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"I would assume that Yhwach would have just absorbed the soul king anyway.  Purpose, dunno, become the only thing left in the universe?"
bleach,37mk5c,ABashfulTurnip,-2,Thu May 28 19:35:19 2015 UTC,Yhwach divined the future before he ever got there. He knew Ukitake was going to interfere.

bleach,37nl44,Sunfloraseeds,3,Thu May 28 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"The commands are structured in a certain way, and Yachiru's command doesn't fit them. Plus her Shikai was already released at that point.  It could be considered a secondary release command used to deactivate their invisibility, like Urahara's Nake and Ikkaku's Sakero, but like I said it isn't structured like a regular release command so I kinda doubt it."
bleach,37nl44,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Thu May 28 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"I think there are certain exceptions. Like Zennosuke's command is ""ohayou"", which isn't in the imperative tense like any other zanpakuto."

bleach,37nl44,shiba_keikaku,1 point,Fri May 29 05:40:54 2015 UTC,This is what confuses me. Renji doesnt say the release command here when he fights Byakuya. Two pages later Byakuya basically says when bankai is achieved you no longer need to shout a release command. Wouldnt it be safe to say Yachiru actually has bankai then? http://www.mangapanda.com/94-594-17/bleach/chapter-140.html http://www.mangapanda.com/94-594-19/bleach/chapter-140.html
bleach,37nl44,tash456,2,Fri May 29 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, either that or she has a constant release Shikai like Kenny and Ichigo. It would kinda make sense since those three people are the only ones who've shown that their Reiatsu can manifest as shapes -- might be connected?  Yachiru's pretty old anyway. She might look like a child, but she's almost as old as Byakuya or possibly older. I wouldn't be at all surprised if she has a Bankai."
bleach,37nl44,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri May 29 13:01:10 2015 UTC,When did Yachiru's Reiatsu form a shape? This I dont remember.

bleach,37nl44,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri May 29 13:30:37 2015 UTC,Does Sir Andy have a theory on why only those three have Reiatsu shapes?
bleach,37nl44,tash456,1 point,Fri May 29 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"Well like I said I think it's probably connected to having a constant release Shikai. We know that that's caused by having massive, unchecked Reiatsu, so I'd say the Reiatsu shapes are caused by the same thing.  I'd even go so far as to say that the Reiatsu shapes are similar to the Shinigami's equivalent of Vollstaendig. For Quincies, when their power reaches a level far beyond their limit their Reiatsu takes the form of wings and a halo. As they expend Reiatsu, they disappear. Perhaps when Ichigo, Kenpachi, and Yachiru flared their Reiatsu, they were able to momentarily cause it to teeter on the limit of solid manifestation. If so, I'd say Kenpachi could now create a constant, solid manifestation by removing his eyepatch."
bleach,37nl44,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Fri May 29 14:28:30 2015 UTC,"This is the first I've heard of Kenpachi constantly having his Shikai released, while i can see how this makes sense, I've never seen any indication of it, could someone clarify for me?"
bleach,37nl44,baou112,2,Fri May 29 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"I believe Kenpachi says it during his fight with Ichigo when Ichigo eggs him to release his Zanpakutou, and is reiterated by Yoruichi while explaining Shikai and Bankai to Ichigo.  Now we know it's a partial release like Yumichika's Fuji Kujaku, though still constant."
bleach,37nl44,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Sat May 30 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"ah, ok, makes sense, thank you for explaining it to me."
bleach,37nl44,baou112,3,Sat May 30 00:35:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe she achieved Bankai and doesn't need a command to release Shikai other than for ""formality""? I mean... Komamura has never used his Shikai release command even once in the series. Can it not be the same with Yachiru? Idon'twanthertobeaZanpakutou T_T"
bleach,37nl44,aizen6,1 point,Fri May 29 11:08:23 2015 UTC,"It could be, but the way she was talking about it made it seem like she just wanted them to be seen rather than actually calling them into battle"
bleach,37nl44,Keranu,1 point,Thu May 28 23:23:39 2015 UTC,She has Bankai or had one before she was killed by Kenpachis Shikai.   From what I gathered Yachiru is not apart of a Zanpakto. Consider Zaraki would need a blade that had split itself into what 1) Nozarashi 2) Yachiru  3/4) Sanpo Kenjuu different aspects of his blade. Plus after splitting all those pieces of his blade Nozarashi has always been beside Kenpachi meanwhile Yachiru has always been beside him and we can assume that Sanpo Kenjuu defend Yachiru or at least work as a team.
bleach,37nimd,PentaFlash,3,Thu May 28 23:02:17 2015 UTC,The popular consensus is that they now serve Yhwach. Yhwach has very few soldiers and the Royal Guard are bound to the Soul King's will. They're needed to serve Yhwach if we're to get some badass fights. Plus Tenjirou and Ichibei were shady as hell.
bleach,37nimd,seratheanos,4,Thu May 28 23:24:19 2015 UTC,I would say Oetsu was a lot shady than Tenjiriou
bleach,37nimd,reigun91,3,Fri May 29 01:07:01 2015 UTC,They both pale in comparison with Urahara.
bleach,37nimd,aizen6,4,Fri May 29 11:12:00 2015 UTC,It's very unlikely that the strongest Shinigami were off screened so easily. The way Ichibe spoke after being brought back by Ichigo was very questionable too.

bleach,37jrve,Seri55,-1,Thu May 28 03:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yea. I mean we think all asians look alike, but to asians, even slight differences to us make huge differences to them. He looks like he's 10 years older, and went from clean shaven to stubbled up, that's like a world of difference to them.  edit: Oh no look at all the otakus and weeabos in here getting irrationally offended at such a light joke. And it is true, people of other races think people of some other race all look alike. Whites do it with blacks, asians, middle easterners. You asians and other people think all white people either look like Ben Affleck, Toby McGuire, or some shit, and all the black people you draw in anime are prettty fucking stereotyped, with their big ass lips and arrogant attitudes.   EVERYONE does it, don't pretend this doesn't happen everywhere, all the time."
bleach,37jrve,stickyourpinkyinmy,1 point,Thu May 28 06:49:56 2015 UTC,Exactly....
bleach,37jrve,Seri55,-1,Thu May 28 13:40:48 2015 UTC,"Just restoring Ichigo's powers doesn't tell her he's a Shinigami.  How much she knows depends on how much she questions. How does she think Ichigo got an inner Hollow? Or, has she never stopped to question any of it?"
bleach,37jrve,Temperatia,9,Thu May 28 04:39:38 2015 UTC,She either didn't know at the beginning or she did know and chose to keep it a secret. Isshin aged because he was basically human until his Shinigami powers came back. He could've been unrecognizable.  During the FB arc it's possible Isshin was able to hide his reiatsu when Hitsugaya and the other captains showed up. Rukia had to have known at this point though.  There aren't any solid facts about this situation so add it to the list of questions that need answering.
bleach,37jrve,Alluka-,15,Thu May 28 03:48:01 2015 UTC,Since this is about Rukia recognizing people I'll throw my question in here instead of making another post.  Did Rukia know who Urahara was when she was buying stuff from his shop in the beginning? I find it hard to believe that she wouldn't know who he was. But I also find it odd that she would cooperate with him if she knew that he was a fugitive from Soul Society. She was a bit of a stickler for the rules during that time.
bleach,37jrve,beard_mcfisty,14,Thu May 28 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"If you remember in the TBTP arc, Byakuya was a kid at the time when Kisuke was there. I'm not 100% sure but I don't think Rukia could have possibly known who he was at the start."
bleach,37jrve,Alluka-,2,Thu May 28 05:46:05 2015 UTC,I know she never met him personally (before the story began) but even Ikkaku knew who Urahara was in the SS arc without meeting him in the past. Maybe it has to do with the style of story telling? I can't remember what it's called.
bleach,37jrve,beard_mcfisty,1 point,Thu May 28 13:13:02 2015 UTC,Wasn't Ikkaku a member of the Gotei long before Rukia? It would make sense that he would have heard of him. It's pretty difficult to keep a timeline of all these events in check.
bleach,37jrve,Alluka-,1 point,Thu May 28 21:03:41 2015 UTC,Yeah the timeline is a headache. I just know that Ikkaku joined soon after Zaraki became captain. It's not like this is ruining Bleach for me it's just something that popped in my head the other day.
bleach,37jrve,beard_mcfisty,11,Fri May 29 05:03:10 2015 UTC,Urahara discovered Rukia after she had given Ichigo her spiritual power and gave her the gigai that contained the hogyouku. This is the basis for her business with urahara.
bleach,37jrve,SafferCrystal,6,Thu May 28 06:05:17 2015 UTC,"Since you were being downvoted, here's proof from the chapter 1 sketch, where you can clearly see Kisuke approaching Rukia after Ichigo passed out."
bleach,37jrve,Kanzu5665,1 point,Thu May 28 09:23:12 2015 UTC,I think this is the answer. Not sure why you were downvoted.
bleach,37jrve,beard_mcfisty,1 point,Thu May 28 08:27:53 2015 UTC,I know how they met story wise but even Ikkaku knew who Urahara was without having personally met him. Maybe it has to do with the style of story telling? I can't remember what it's called.

bleach,37jrve,SW9876,3,Thu May 28 05:56:42 2015 UTC,"Really random but this thread made me think of this. The classic anime trope that can be seen multiple times in Bleach of a character sacrificing their powers in order to gain insane temporary strength is weird in the case of a soul reaper, since aren't they really sacrificing their zanpakto? It seems like a self-less act but they aren't really doing anything to themselves."
bleach,37jrve,MrGommyBoy,2,Thu May 28 06:15:27 2015 UTC,Yes but over time they grow VERY close to there zan and it's probably like losing part of themselves
bleach,37jrve,mlc885,3,Thu May 28 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"While I think it's just a plot hole, especially since I'm pretty sure Rangiku and Hitsugaya have seen him and not noticed as well, the easy explanation is that he and Ichigo only look a little bit like Isshin Shiba, and Shinigami take generations to significantly age.  So basically they'd have to know there was something weird about his disappearance and figure out that he effectively became human, since the Isshin Shiba they knew should still look as young as Ichigo.  Still pretty silly considering Isshin's weird behavior and Ichigo's prodigious talent, but it's not like they should have ever expected to see Isshin Shiba but twenty-some years older, considering that sort of aging would normally take forever on a Shinigami."
bleach,37jrve,Alluka-,4,Thu May 28 07:16:35 2015 UTC,There will most likely be explanations once Isshin makes an appearance again.
bleach,37jrve,SafferCrystal,5,Thu May 28 07:47:58 2015 UTC,"Rukia joined the Gotei 13 before the events in Everything But the Rain, so Isshin and Rukia definitely were part of the Gotei 13 at the same time. It's a plot hole that she doesn't recognize him in either the Substitute Shinigami or Arrancar arcs, but there are multiple possible explanations for it:   Isshin's changed a lot physically. His reiatsu was also heavily suppressed. She avoided any Shiba contact after returning Kaien's body, due to her immense guilt complex. Isshin is a branch family member, so he may not have been at the main family compound very often. There isn't much interaction between a captain and an unseated member of another division, so she wouldn't recognize him by looks. Isshin seems younger than Kaien, so it's possible Isshin's advancement captain didn't happen until after Kaien's death. If this is the case, I find it very likely Rukia kept away from him due to reason #2. No one expected Isshin to be hiding out in the World of the Living with a family. It's unknown how Soul Society classified his disappearance; if he was listed as KIA, it makes sense she wouldn't make the connection. Who expects a dead captain to be quietly raising a human family in a small town?"

bleach,37ipf4,HopelessCentipede,7,Wed May 27 22:38:02 2015 UTC,I think Urahara said they requested assistance but none could be provided so they might be in trouble.
bleach,37ipf4,Mekbop,5,Wed May 27 22:45:59 2015 UTC,It just dawned on me didn't Urahara send out a message telling everyone to come to the lab but a bunch of Captains didn't reply and were considered MIA?
bleach,37ipf4,Mekbop,3,Wed May 27 22:59:22 2015 UTC,http://www.mangareader.net/bleach/612/12  Finally found it.
bleach,37ipf4,Alluka-,3,Wed May 27 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"Mayuri is in control of Hitsugaya, Rangiku, Kensei and Rose. Byakuya was there during the fight with Pepe so he must know about this right? Kisuke says that the 3rd and 9th division Captains are with him but when Mayuri shows up, none of the 4 mentioned are there. Makes you wonder what Mayuri is up to.  edit: So Byakuya does know but he questions the morality of Mayuri in doing so."
bleach,37ipf4,kingofdabz,2,Wed May 27 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"If you notice there, byakuya only sees kensei and rose, doesn't see toshiro and rangiku, but from what we saw in mayuris fight we know toshiro and rangiku are zombified, but when roll call is taken, kensei and rose are mentioned yet toshiro and rangiku were listed as completely unknown. So not even buyakuya saw or knows about the experiments mayuri did on toshiro, or if he's zombified or even alive. This could get very interesting down the line"
bleach,37ipf4,Alluka-,4,Thu May 28 02:49:43 2015 UTC,Yeah we haven't seen Toshiro or Rangiku since Mayuri's fight with Giselle. Mayuri has been sketchy ever since he was first brought in by Kisuke. I think he has some weird agenda.
bleach,37ipf4,kingofdabz,2,Thu May 28 03:26:27 2015 UTC,It'll be interesting to see it play out. That whole exchange he had with byakuya where he turned away and justified messing with the captains dead bodies gave me an eerie vibe
bleach,37ipf4,oetsuthebest,11,Thu May 28 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"Thats right man . I think the last part of the story has become really messy with many random things happening.sometimes it doesnt even feel like bleach ... I mean , the first part of the arc is really god and gave out strong emotions (yama's death , byakuyas defeat ecc)but then it begins to get worse.first kira lost and rose says he and his guitar are both crying , then nobody talks again bout it )unohana dies and only isane sheds a tear bout it ,komamura became a dog after sacrificing all himself and nobody even cares , three captains dies and nobody gives a.damn bout them ,then ukitake sacrificies himself and after that nobody gives a fuck .the royal guard is defeated and orihime doesnt even heal them . I mean , why is everyone so cold man?"
bleach,37ipf4,reigun91,21,Wed May 27 23:03:16 2015 UTC,"Its a war, its kill or be killed, they do not have the luxury of mourning deaths, when the world as they know it might come to an end. Orihime doesn't heal the Royal Guards because there are more important matters at hand. Also, we don't even know if the Royal Guard are on the shinigami side anymore."
bleach,37ipf4,oetsuthebest,3,Thu May 28 00:13:54 2015 UTC,"it is not that orihime did something useful at the soul king palace anyway... she could have healed them instead of going up there showing off with chad and ganju and then falling down again ... and plus , i dont see the captains doing that much anyway . they are in a war , i get it , but even the first invasion was a war , but really showed horror and sadness ... but now,it feels unreal man . u can show some emotions even in a war . remember when yama died and shunsui lost his shit for the first time ? now that was beautiful for me , it showed how much he was scarred for that . now 4 captain dies , nobody says nothing , and ukitake is right there dying and nobody says nothing ... komamura sacrificed his life for the battle and nobody assists him.... i mean , someone wasnt doing nothing at the time they could have helped him man"
bleach,37ipf4,DerptasticHuman,2,Thu May 28 12:04:32 2015 UTC,Shinji doesn't even mention he saved his life... twice...

bleach,37lped,buzz3light,13,Thu May 28 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"It feels like nothing has happened since the Ichibe and Juha fight.   Did you miss the part where Ichigo was tricked into killing the Soul King, Ukitake sacrificed himself to try to save it, Grimmjow returned, and Yhwach completely took over the Royal Palace...?"
bleach,37lped,Aaroniero,-7,Thu May 28 15:40:14 2015 UTC,Did you miss all the empty panels that lead to all those things?
bleach,37lped,Aaroniero,8,Thu May 28 15:51:43 2015 UTC,You said it seems like nothing happened. I'm just pointing out that things did happen.
bleach,37lped,Zil_v_a,-3,Thu May 28 15:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yes SEEMS and I'm pointing out the glaring problems with the pacing in the chapter. There are a lot of moments in between big events that make the story remain stagnate. It took forever just to arrive at the encounter between Juha and Ichigo (short btw). Aizen's reappearance was awesome because Aizen. He hasn't been able to do much either. And Grimmjow was cool in the few panels that we saw him with Nell and Ichigo but we're probably not going to see him for a little while again. Also, we didn't even get to see the dismantling and reconstruction of the palace. Ukitake will survive (his efforts we somewhat pointless) and I hope we return to the pieces of the Soul king phenomena because that was really cool."
bleach,37lped,Alluka-,7,Thu May 28 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much the reason nobody reads attack on titan anymore. But even that survived on no progress for quiet a few chapters.   But jokes aside, the setup itself is quiet alright. We don't get ""empty pages"", everything sets some sort of a rule or plot for the incoming deathmatch.   I did dislike the ""let's build a door"" part. It was okay for two chapters, but after about five it's definitely tiring.   In overall Bleach is written for the book format so dropping it and reading after a while in bulks is generally the better approach. Weekly issues are honestly just for the impatient."
bleach,37jba8,FacialLover,2,Thu May 28 01:14:45 2015 UTC,I don't know how to say much without spoiling what's to come so potential spoilers  I repeat  POTENTIAL SPOILERS  In a later fight

bleach,37jba8,boredguy12,1 point,Thu May 28 01:28:52 2015 UTC,Will do thanks for the response :)
bleach,37hfau,oetsuthebest,8,Wed May 27 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Rukia fought aes nodt who wasn't THAT strong. He just had a nice gimmick for his schrift..   Renji on the other hand fought mask who was REALLY strong as OP said.    Renji, before going to royal palace, was already super strong. easily captain level.  In the fullbring arc you get to see exactly how strong he has become in his fight with Jackie.. People like to dismiss that arc or ignore it, but the fullbringers had some really OP abilities. Renji's training really showed. he was a badass that arc.  Once renji got royal guard training he gained a true zanpakuto. Remember your zanpakuto shares power with its user.. A zanpakuto power up with reiatsu boost makes sense for him to bee this strong or in the range he is now."
bleach,37hfau,c9IceCream,4,Wed May 27 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"The issue I have with Renji's is the fact that he basically outclassed Rose and Kensei. Now granted, Rose's bankai had a glaring weakness and Kensei's only flaw was not being able to keep beating a strong opponent that keeps regenerating but Renji was beating Mask pretty easily BEFORE bankai. That part tripped me out because he was taking hits like they were nothing while two captains were kind of getting rekted. I feel like if Renji had more of a struggle, the power up would've been more believable. But Rukia's on the other hand made more sense. She even struggled a little until Byakuya stepped in and gave her a little pep talk. And Byakuya...well tbh I would be disappointed if he wasn't able to handle his own against so many sternritter. But it was weird he had so much trouble against Pepe."
bleach,37hfau,richiegraine,5,Wed May 27 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"But think about this: most souls, no matter what, seem kind of weak in the human world (especially Quincy) but are just better in the SS. The SKP is like that, but more OP. Renji and Rukia both could barely breathe in there. Renji being super badass was so weak that he couldn't even function right in the skp. Now both of them are able to withstand the power, and even flourish in the SKP. So the SS is like easy mode now. Kind of how Goku trained in 50+G's to fight Vegeta and Freeza."
bleach,37hfau,HazelnutPi,2,Thu May 28 00:16:29 2015 UTC,I kind of get it but then I don't.
bleach,37hfau,richiegraine,2,Thu May 28 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"Basically having gotten used to the SKP (with high reiatsu density) during their time there, upon return to the SS (with lower density) they're more powerful as they don't have to push as hard.  Imagine swimming through treacle (SKP) which builds your strength, then in water (SS). The water is a lot easier than the treacle, but you're used to the treacle so you're stronger."
bleach,37hfau,AeonOptic,1 point,Thu May 28 22:47:57 2015 UTC,Ok thanks that makes more sense.
bleach,37hfau,richiegraine,1 point,Fri May 29 01:19:48 2015 UTC,"I still don't get why KT keeps making Byakuya fight people who try to fight him with love. Also, Wtf did it mean when he couldn't be affected by pepe's thing when he got hit?"
bleach,37hfau,arakano,1 point,Fri May 29 23:52:53 2015 UTC,I think it might be because he is so strong you have to pair him up with people with weird controlling powers to even get a good fight out of him. He did after all successfully take on 3 SR. Pepe had to be a little different and I guess it was hard to find a proper power to go against him and not get obliterated.
bleach,37hfau,richiegraine,9,Sat May 30 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Even though it seems a bit unbalanced, I'd like to remember you some details that could help make their victories not so impressive:  .Renji was not Mask's first enemy. He already fought other guys (two captains included). You can say that this is irrelevant, since James healed him afterwards, but, even like this, Renji had the time to watch the fights (this way figuring out he should deal with James too in order to kill Mask).  . Rukia wasn't the only one fighting As Nodt - Byakuya gave her some help after he used his Aschwallen (sorry for the spelling), so it was more like a 2x1 fight that Rukia finished alone.  .Both Rukia and Renji had just arrived to the fight. They were fully recovered, their powers were pristine, their mana and hp at max, etc. You'll have a better time during war if you come last to fight a weakened enemy.   But, yeah, in the end, the power up was kinda exaggerated."
bleach,37hfau,assertiveguy,3,Wed May 27 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"Makes sense that Mask wasn't at his strongest. He might be able to regenerate, but his reiatsu supply is probably limited"
bleach,37hfau,rogrogrickroll,11,Thu May 28 13:31:24 2015 UTC,I think bleach power levels are just messed up and difficult to figure out at times. I don't even
bleach,37hfau,rogrogrickroll,3,Wed May 27 17:40:23 2015 UTC,i think it is like dragon ball a little ... super sayian power for everyone who wants it
bleach,37hfau,assertiveguy,1 point,Wed May 27 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"If only... I still don't understand why just those four characters received the royal guard training. Shit's useful, yo, let other guys have a try at it too."
bleach,37hfau,Purona,3,Wed May 27 18:48:18 2015 UTC,-Aizen gin tosen betrayed the gotei 13 -Isshin and Yoruichi straight abandoned there post -Kenpachi has already betrayed the gotei 13 once and was ready to kill 2 of its captains why should he be trusted with training of that magnitude?  And you think its a good idea to just give every shinigami training?
bleach,37hfau,seratheanos,6,Wed May 27 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Kensei and Rose were proven loyal and were presumably much stronger than Rukia and Renji, being at captain level for over a hundred years. As was Shinji. Plus none of the got their bankais stolen either. It would have made sense to give them all a power boost.   Hitsugaya, what with being a ""child prodigy"" and all coulda gone."
bleach,37hfau,assertiveguy,3,Wed May 27 19:09:45 2015 UTC,^
bleach,37hfau,Purona,0,Wed May 27 19:24:04 2015 UTC,Let me make this simple  Who would you trust more between Kensei and Rose now and aizen and Tosen before there betrayal  two Shinigami that disappeared and came back vs two shinigami that have remained in the gotei 13 for over 100 years
bleach,37hfau,seratheanos,1 point,Wed May 27 19:18:42 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly see why that's relevant. May as well doubt everyone then, because Rose, Kensei and Shinji were wrongly exiled but still fought alongside the Gotei. They reintegrated into Soul Society. They were exiled for something that had been done to them not by them  Much as I hate to admit it, the only reason it was Renji and Rukia is that they're fan favourites."
bleach,37hfau,assertiveguy,6,Wed May 27 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"-Aizen gin tosen betrayed the gotei 13 -Isshin and Yoruichi straight abandoned there post -Kenpachi has already betrayed the gotei 13 once and was ready to kill 2 of its captains why should he be trusted with training of that magnitude?   Well, Kenpachi still received a damn good power-up nonetheless... and that costed the life of a captain (one of the most powerful, word has it). Wouldn't it be better if he could receive this power-up without killing Unohana in the process?   And you think its a good idea to just give every shinigami training?   In that situation? Yes. Actually, if you re-read the arc, you'll notice that most of the relevant characters went to some kind of training (like Histugaya learning to use his shikai more efficiently, and Soi Fon doing that one-arm-stand thing...). Why not make them all receive the most effective training possible? It wouldn't be such an interesting read, but it's the more logical decision.  I actually hate random power-ups. Ichigo's FGT looked badass, but was so poorly explained that I just can't like it. But training seems to be the standard plan whenever a powerful enemy appears in pretty much every shonen manga out there."
bleach,37hfau,aizen6,5,Wed May 27 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"I really was hoping to see unohana go wild on some sternritter and then shunsui did a wtf move like that ... I just dont get it why kubo makes the story seem as a 9 year old boy did it . Plus i just remembered rukia was awake and talked to ichigo after the first invasion , then she appears uncounscious in one of shutaras balls ... It doesnt make sense man .she wasn't that wounded . They could have taken poor kira up there instead"
bleach,37hfau,kingofdabz,5,Wed May 27 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"They could have taken poor kira up there instead   The ""Where the fuck is Kira"" club shouts its assent!"
bleach,37hfau,Aaroniero,1 point,Thu May 28 08:16:19 2015 UTC,"It was the soul kings direct orders to train those people, as said by ichibei when he first came down from the royal realm. Storywise, you can call it a move by the soul King to beat yhwach, since the soul King could see into the future"
bleach,37hfau,FritzII,4,Thu May 28 03:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm perfectly fine with the power-ups, only because Rukia is one of my favorite characters and seeing her fight and use bankai was awesome. I actually preferred Renji's bankai the way it was, so I'm more indifferent to his power-up."
bleach,37hfau,rogrogrickroll,0,Wed May 27 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yea man i got what you are saying but though really exciting when your character tears shit up , i really want it in a more realistic and logic way"
bleach,37hfau,rogrogrickroll,4,Wed May 27 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah my biggest problem with the manga. It's impossible to have an actual ""what if"" challenge between characters throughout the series. Like there is going to be some long explanation as to why Grimmjow went from being beat by a sub-Vasto Lorde powered Ichigo to being able to fight Bach's elites, who are clearly more powerful than Vasto Lorde level Espadas."
bleach,37hfau,rogrogrickroll,3,Wed May 27 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"They say he developed segunta etapa and i really think it is like that . Plus we have yet to see him fight so maybe who knows,he could get his ass kicked(praying god not)"
bleach,37hfau,sticfreak,3,Wed May 27 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"So is he stronger than Ulquiorra now? Ulquiorra was ranked ahead of Grimmjow, but is that based on his first release or second release? If Ulquiorra was ranked ahead of Grimmjow based on their first release, and Grimmjow becomes more powerful than second release Ulqiorra after he himself achieves it, I don't think that makes any sense."
bleach,37hfau,Alluka-,2,Thu May 28 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"If he is strong as ulquiorra second release , i think it will be a nice show"

bleach,37hfau,shogunreaper,3,Thu May 28 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"Well Renji wasn't ever fighting at his full potential because he didn't know the true name of his Zanpakuto. It only makes sense that he became much stronger after he did.  Also, this is important to take note of. Correct me if I'm wrong but we don't know what being on this list means."
bleach,37hfau,KingBliz,3,Wed May 27 20:16:48 2015 UTC,No man you are not wrong but i guess the list will never be explained because it comes out of nowhere . You are also right bout renji not being at full power but still i find it exagerated how he became so top player
bleach,37hfau,HazelnutPi,3,Wed May 27 20:25:54 2015 UTC,I think it will be explained later. I don't really think it's that much of a shocker that Renji became so strong. He was able to achieve Bankai which is a feat in itself because not everyone is capable.   There are a lot of unanswered questions but I believe in Kubo to deliver.
bleach,37hfau,Zil_v_a,1 point,Wed May 27 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"Nowadays everyone grows a bankai fam . Even shuhei got one .the 2 captains fought mask with bankai and lost anyway .but anyway yes , lets believe in kubo and hope he remembers all the answers he has to give"
bleach,37hfau,Sutanreyu,1 point,Wed May 27 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's not that common. It's just that the characters that we usually see are getting stronger, but bankai isn't a common thing if you look for characters under the lieutenant tier that have achieved it (the only one would be Ikkaku, iirc), and most lieutenants don't have it. Having a bankai is still rare in Gotei 13."
bleach,37hfau,kenpachiki,1 point,Wed May 27 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"Yes man i know but i mean the characters who appear in the series have one , almost everyone we know . But the point was that it isnt enough of an achievement to let you become op as renji was"
bleach,37hfau,Temperatia,3,Wed May 27 21:29:25 2015 UTC,i always felt that this arc was stupidly unbalanced. yamamoto should never have been fodderised like that and if he was to be beaten at least make it so he is at full power when it happens(every fight he has had either in manga or anime filler he has been heavily handicapped)  we now have to face the fact that ichigo will become more powerful than beings that have been around for thousands on years in the space of under 10(probably 5) years. ridiculous.
bleach,37hfau,aizen6,2,Thu May 28 08:50:50 2015 UTC,"this really shows the manga isnt made to be taken that seriously ... the say this happens because it is a shonen ... even hunter x hunter is a shonen , but goddamn it how many times did gon get his ass kicked ... and the king wasnt even defeated by him . i really like the maturity and realism of that manga and wished it had been the same here in bleach man"
bleach,37hfau,Temperatia,2,Thu May 28 11:54:16 2015 UTC,HxH kept it real as hell. even Hisoka said (or was it wing) that power doesnt win fights but how proficient you are wiith your nen ability.

You can see the struggle they go through and they have too use strategy to win ...netero barely burned the king and readily exploded himself after his defeat that gave me chills!that show really goes deep and not everything and everyone is there for the protagonist there are many things going on in there amd the protagonist becomes even irrelevant sometimes . In bleach everone coasks.ichigo to protect them and save the world

Uvo killed a guy with his scream but due to how Kurapika utilised his ability he fodderised him."
bleach,37hfau,Hipplol,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:26:07 2015 UTC,"Kurapika's abilities were stronger than usual because they only worked on the spiders.  and bungee gum is pretty basic in what it can do. It sticks to stuff and stretches, how would that work against gon? If he stuck it to him he could just drag his ass over towards him and beat him down.  Gon far outclassed pitou and i can't see hisoka beating her."
bleach,37hfau,redditrandomacc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"Bungee Gum is perfect for fighting enhancers. Remember he also incorporates it in his mobility, it's basic but very original and versatile. Remember he also has texture surprise and them cards of doom, super gon seems very reckless and doubt he thinks to use gyo in that form, it just sets up too perfectly for hisoka"
bleach,37hfau,SHINee21,2,Thu Jun 11 08:28:25 2015 UTC,"Imagine that each world has a power level. Let's say that Tue human world is 0, the SS is 100, and the SKP is 100,000. The characters have to get their base stats high enough to exist in the realm. So going to the SKP makes the SS boring and not even a fight, so even though the Quincy aren't really correlated, it still affects them. They max out at lvl 100, whereas Ichigo&gang max out at lvl 100,000...assuming I'm correct"
bleach,37hfau,rogrogrickroll,1 point,Thu May 28 18:25:19 2015 UTC,It was never said how many times stronger they will get. But pretty much everything they did there was increasing their reiatsu in one way or another.   Call it convenient.

bleach,37f7ay,Alkura,3,Wed May 27 13:53:13 2015 UTC,lol
bleach,37f7ay,StuperSconed,5,Wed May 27 14:21:40 2015 UTC,I was wondering what the hell use Ganju would be in the upcoming fight ...I can't believe I didn't notice this! Nice catch

bleach,37f7ay,wolve99,3,Wed May 27 16:53:57 2015 UTC,"People are just making up crap again, don't worry about it."
bleach,37f7ay,HazelnutPi,7,Thu May 28 00:23:45 2015 UTC,This leaves a lot of open questions.   Could he have gained segunda etapa without his current skillset?  Keeping his regeneration might be why Ulquiorra reached it and the others above him didnt? Instant regeneration is a super strong ability. Considering how strong ulquiorra was it seems like the smarter choice to maintain that. Without it he might have been killed easier even with stronger powers..  There's lots to consider
bleach,37f7ay,c9IceCream,9,Wed May 27 13:47:02 2015 UTC,I don't think he'd be as strong as Ichigo or Aizen at the end of the Arrancar arc but he'd be close I suppose. This interesting though. I'm assuming Grimmjow and Nel will have segunda etapa and they don't seem the type to give up power for regeneration because they wear there scars with pride so it'll be interesting to see how strong they are when they go segunda etapa.
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 05:08:54 2015 UTC,I don't think Nel was able to reach Segunda Etapa because of her cracked mask from Nnoitra since she is constantly spilling out
bleach,37f7ay,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,3,Wed May 27 19:33:07 2015 UTC,I'm 99.99% sure she'll have it. I think Urahara's wristband counteracts the leaking of reiatsu but it was never fully explained so it's speculation.
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 19:45:09 2015 UTC,I still ask myself of why did only ulquiorra have the segunta etapa ... What made him so special ?
bleach,37f7ay,oetsuthebest,2,Wed May 27 20:13:32 2015 UTC,I don't think he is special. Unless anybody wants to link to something that proves me wrong. With that in mind any Arrancar should be able to attain segunda etapa. I compare Ulquiorra's segunda to Mayuri going bankai for the first time. Just because he was the first doesn't mean he's the only one.
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 20:25:42 2015 UTC,Yea man plus i dont think kubo shows something special like segunta etapa only once and then takes it off forever at least i hope
bleach,37f7ay,oetsuthebest,2,Wed May 27 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is 100% proof that he was the only one capable of it. Considering he says not even Aizen knew about it, that means other Espada could have had it too but didn't tell anyone.  However, to counter that, you would think that if any other Espada had a 2nd release they would've used it in battle. I think it's safe to say at that point in the story, Ulquiorra was the only one who achieved it."
bleach,37f7ay,Alluka-,1 point,Wed May 27 20:57:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree that at that point he's the only one that had it but 2 years have passed. 2 years in the human world and 2 years in Hueco Mundo aren't the same so I think it'd be a safe bet to assume that Grimmjow and Nel have it too.
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"Man , with all the bankais and fullbringers and and segunta etapas we're expecting , i really think some epic shit will go down"
bleach,37f7ay,oetsuthebest,2,Wed May 27 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hoping for a bang if this really is the end. You gotta go out in style after all."
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 21:40:35 2015 UTC,Im hoping for a big bang man . So i can peacefully continue my life without regrets
bleach,37f7ay,oetsuthebest,2,Wed May 27 21:46:48 2015 UTC,It's a high possibility that they have it but there's always a chance that they don't.
bleach,37f7ay,Alluka-,2,Wed May 27 22:34:56 2015 UTC,I see what you're getting at but unless Kubo puts a big emphasis on the fact that hollows can poison quincys. Its more likely they'll have segunda. I don't think they'll get shafted to support roles like Riruka and Yukio so segunda would be a logical step. That's just me though. We'll have to wait and see how it all goes down.
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"He would have been substantially stronger, but not to the extreme of Yammy. I think Yammy sacrificed more than just his regeneration, I think he sacrificed his heirro, speed and possibly his intelligence for strength. Yammy was so strong he could have crushed Rukia in his hand if he wanted to. If Ulquiorra just sacrificed his regeneration, he would have probably ended up looking like Batman instead of idk a 120lb dude with wings. He would have been between Nnoitora and Yammy in terms of strength.  Story wise I don't think it would have changed much. He would have beaten Ichigo faster the second time, but he would have also been defeated by Ichigo quicker after he turned hollow."
bleach,37f7ay,whatacrappyusername,3,Wed May 27 16:08:06 2015 UTC,120lb dude with wings. Is that the official weigh in?
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,3,Wed May 27 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, his actual official weight is 121lbs. I was just making a guess."
bleach,37f7ay,whatacrappyusername,3,Wed May 27 17:23:37 2015 UTC,Dang. He did seem thin but 121?! He should've ate some wheaties.
bleach,37f7ay,EspadaPrimera,2,Wed May 27 17:51:08 2015 UTC,Well he is pretty short and it's not like he's muscular either.

bleach,37f7ay,Alluka-,2,Wed May 27 21:53:37 2015 UTC,Wow. I guess I never really paid attention to heights. Kinda like Ulquiorra a little bit more just for his height.
bleach,37fr78,Shunsui_for_CC,11,Wed May 27 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"Hints to this are across the whole storyline. Pretty much once I saw that bit in turn back the pendulum - ""When a body disappears but the clothes are left, one is unable to sustain his human form"" - I started to support the idea. Yachiru can easily be another Lilynette, just one made unconsciously. But then again, Yachiru has a shikai of her own. Based on making friends from reiatsu at that.  At this point the reason for and against have been listed so many times we might as well just sit down and wait for Kubo to cut the dispute."
bleach,37fr78,Zil_v_a,5,Wed May 27 11:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that was really her shikai, she didn't call for a release.. also, IIRC one of the spirit/things was holding a blade that looked like Kenpachi's released blade."
bleach,37fr78,crustang,3,Wed May 27 12:19:39 2015 UTC,also isane commented about how she was able to make her shikai appear without calling its name i believe?  something strange like that.. Definitely plenty of mystery
bleach,37fr78,c9IceCream,2,Wed May 27 13:34:25 2015 UTC,I believe this one was debunked. Some characters can call the name later or not at all. Usually when they already have a bankai. Or something like that.
bleach,37fr78,Zil_v_a,2,Wed May 27 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"ya, and i'm in agreement with that.. it also has some overlap with a filler arc so it gets confusing..  I try not to over complicate things and just notice that Isane was surprised/confused."
bleach,37fr78,c9IceCream,2,Wed May 27 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"If filler conflicts with the rest of the series, ignore the filler."
bleach,37fr78,Holyrapid,1 point,Wed May 27 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"This seems shaky at best. Just for reference who are the ones that can call their zanpakuto out without saying their name or even anything at all? Isane Also seemed to point it out to herself as if this never happened before. Even if other shinigami could do it, they didn't do it in the way yachiru did. She didn't call forth a shikai or bankai or say the name later, they literally just appeared. As if she was all of them. And then we come back to the point of her clothes disappearing and her flashback of her not having a name and touching kenpachis sword, right before she disappeared. It all seems to point one way. There is too much evidence for it to dismiss her calling out her zanpakuto without a name as ""debunked"""

bleach,37fr78,Zil_v_a,1 point,Wed May 27 20:29:52 2015 UTC,Sorry but she didn't disappear when Kenny and Ichigo fought in the SS arc. She sat there and just watched the fight.
bleach,37fr78,TwistedMemories,1 point,Wed May 27 20:03:41 2015 UTC,She disappeared only when Kenpachi was using shikai. That's why people think she's the suppressed reiatsu of his zanpakutou leaking out.

bleach,37fr78,TwistedMemories,1 point,Wed May 27 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"She's his inner child. Kenpachi never had a childhood in his soul society life.

She wants to have fun, be careless. She's got nothing to prove."

bleach,37fr78,kingofdabz,1 point,Wed May 27 21:14:42 2015 UTC,well not exactly. The line was first used when talking about simple citizens of soul society that lost their ability to maintain their original human form due to hogyoku.

bleach,37c2oh,69username69,4,Tue May 26 15:55:03 2015 UTC,Then everything would've been according to Aizen's keikaku and the fullbringers could've been more connected to the story.

bleach,37c2oh,RogueHippie,1 point,Wed May 27 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"I thought he planned it to be Rukia because he knew Ichigo would remind her of Kaien, which would convince her enough to give him her powers even though it was against the rules."

bleach,37c2oh,BackHandLegend,5,Thu May 28 11:43:18 2015 UTC,"He could've gotten fullbring somehow, and then the other powers would just rise up in time. Maybe Ryuken or Ishida could have taught him how to be a quincy, for some reason. He also could have died, and his soul form might have gone through holowification, which, you can say, is just like him awakening his hollow powers. If he didn't become a hollow after dying, he would have definatly gone to the SS and become a shinigami the normal way."
bleach,37c2oh,YachiruTheKittyKat,6,Tue May 26 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Given his spiritual power level was well above human norms, it feels likely that he'd eventually awaken Fullbring. It would necessarily have had a different focus, since he wouldn't have the badge, and potentially a different manifestation (since he wouldn't subconsciously have his Shinigami abilities influencing it).  That might bring him into contact with X-cution, though without the specific background in the main plot, their interest in him might be more cooperative than predatory.  On the other hand, they could just train him up, steal his power, and leave him once again powerless (and without his history with Rukia and SS, they wouldn't show up to re-power him).  With the composition of his soul, and his high spiritual power/potential, it's very likely that after his natural death, he'd end up a Shinigami anyway, assuming he didn't fall Hollow before making the transition to SS."

bleach,37dnsi,TodenEngel,4,Tue May 26 23:01:23 2015 UTC,Tsukishima was OP. The arc was heading down before the Shinigami showed up.   Which may just be Kubo changing directions after the ratings started to come in. His editors jumped up his ass like Aizen's cellmates down in Muken.

bleach,37c338,kingofdabz,3,Tue May 26 21:23:02 2015 UTC,yea but watching him defend the one he swore to kill means him becoming more or less a war tool in the hands of yhwach doesn't it ?
bleach,37c338,kingofdabz,1 point,Wed May 27 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"He was a war tool for the previous soul king before this. That's they're purpose, especially the creator of zanpakuto: war tools."

bleach,37c338,rogrogrickroll,2,Wed May 27 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"The soul King chose him for that duty as he chose all the other royal guard. There is technically no mention of oetsu wanting his profession, it was just given to him, most like because he was already good with swords. Also you gotta look at it like this, the royal guard keep saying over and over again that it is their sworn duty to protect ""the soul King"" that could be easily be seen as if there was any other guy up there in the tower, they would have to protect him too because he is keeping the realms together and they have to protect the person keepin the realms together. And what did yhwach just do? He didn't destroy the realms like he originally intended, he is keeping them there but reshaping them. Right now yhwach is that lynchpin that holds the worlds together. If Ichigo were to kill him now without a replacement, all the realms would fall apart, and yhwach is all powerful too, and ichibei was just revived saying ""you cannot defeat yhwach, humans"", so he can easily revive the other members by chanting their name, and he seems to have accepted that yhwach is the new king. Think of it from the eyes of the royal guard ""we have a new soul King now, if HE dies, then all the realms will be destroyed anyway, so if this Ichigo guy is coming at him we should probably stop him, there is no one else to be soul King."""
bleach,37c338,WongDesire,2,Wed May 27 21:45:29 2015 UTC,"Damn man , your answer is good and.it makes sense , but it is strange and weird looking the guard defend the one who killed them without any hate or regret for their failure .

bleach,37c338,shiba_keikaku,2,Tue May 26 15:35:39 2015 UTC,Hype was created the moment we learned that there was another squad outside of the regular 13. It's like finding out that there's a white ranger or silver ranger when you only have the regular 5.
bleach,37c338,Rocksbury,6,Wed May 27 17:49:17 2015 UTC,I think one of the main reasons oetsu got rekt was bc of plot

bleach,37ccpe,Reina-de-Rosas,3,Tue May 26 16:16:36 2015 UTC,I think Rukia and Renji were in a special training building that condensed the reishi.

bleach,37c7kc,oetsuthebest,2,Tue May 26 16:03:06 2015 UTC,Nozarashi was his shikai. Also Kenpachi met Yachiru before he met Aizen at least to my knowledge so it wouldn't make sense if she was made by Kyoka Suigetsu.

bleach,37c7kc,EspadaPrimera,1 point,Tue May 26 16:14:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that happens to me too. It just shows how much of fanboy/girl you are so it's cool.
bleach,37c7kc,MetaAmbience,1 point,Tue May 26 16:19:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit too out there to be realistic. For one, Yachiru would probably disappear after Aizen was sealed with Urahara's kido after the battle with final gt Ichigo if she was an Aizen induced illusion. For another, wouldn't Aizen have to consciously and constantly control the Yachiru illusion? She has a radically different personality from Aizen and I think it would be difficult for Aizen to keep it authentic enough so that Kenpachi wouldn't notice."
bleach,37c7kc,Keksliebhaber,1 point,Tue May 26 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"I think that your theory is incorrect, because, as we know, Kenpachi found Yachiru as a toddler, before joining the Gotei 13. Also Ichigo was able to see her, way before he met Aizen."
bleach,37c7kc,Shisui_,1 point,Tue May 26 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"Kenpachi met Yachiro before he even joined the 13 court guard squads. So, this is pretty much impossible unless he knew Aizen before that, which is also pretty unlikely."
bleach,37c7kc,Shisui_,1 point,Wed May 27 21:22:21 2015 UTC,"I would have to argue two theories to debunk that. One being, as Aizen was testing the extent of his Bankai's abilities he was either satisfied or unsatisfied with it's results after creating Yachiru and just left her there, which eventually lead Yachiru to wander and then she & Kenpachi found each other. Second theory, Aizen came across and knew of Kenpachi at some point and saw him as a threat to his plans or was just simply amused and wanted to monitor to see what Kenpachi would do to a child, creates Yachiru, and then either was satisfied or unsatisfied with the results and just didn't care to put Yachiru back after witnessing the outcome.  Everyone should not be so clingy to something so well known about how Kenpachi & Yachiru met just because it was shown. This theory is no better than those who believe that Yachiru is a Zanpakuto/Ausachi. The difference here is that nobody ever thought of the possibility of Yachiru being an ""illusion"" that was manifested given a material body by Aizen through his Bankai, because we don't even know what Aizen's Bankai is or what it does.  Aizen has already once made a body double of himself once, so who's to say he couldn't have done so for Yachiru as an experiment? Whether Yachiru & Kenpachi's meeting was an accident, intentional, or just pure coincidence it's anybodies guess. But it doesn't mean that Yachiru couldn't have just been her own person from the start either so I'm not arguing that.  edit: For all we know, Aizen probably never even had reached Bankai to begin with so whatever the case there are just too many unknown so whether this theory is right or wrong it's anybodies guess."
bleach,37c7kc,Shisui_,1 point,Wed May 27 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"Well except the fact that Aizen actually has to show his kyoka suigetsu to a person in order for them to be under the complete hypnosis. Also, reasonably, if he could use his ability from so far away at any point in time, he could have taken out the gotei 13 realistically at any point by crushing them from within. Framing, and manipulation.   But, the real problem with your theory is the fact Ichigo had NOT seen Aizens ability (which is stated in the manga and show multiple times) and Ichigo was able to see Yachiru. (along with the rest of the human crew) So, just that in itself debunks the theory 100%."

bleach,375wwt,TodenEngel,21,Mon May 25 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"I don't find it likely. Pernida seems to have some sort of appendages in her hood, her eyes are bright and round, and it's implied that she's basically an animal making cracking, screeching, and roaring noises.  I find it more likely that Pernida might be an Arrancar whose mask was completely torn off and was ""purified"" with Quincy powers. Haschwalth's maid might actually be that as well, but she would've turned out a lot more normal. We already know such a dramatic difference is possible since Pesche basically looks like a regular human, but Dondochakka looks like a caricature."
bleach,375wwt,Andygoesrawr,5,Mon May 25 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Now that's an interesting theory. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to assume such a purification would be a very violent phenomenon. So violent that it turned Pernida into a puppet (or animal).  Now, since Hollows and Quincies are some sort of opposites, as Kurotsuchi said when they Hollowified the captains to make them recover their Bankai (I think the pills were called Shineiyaku). If I remember correctly, it took advantage of the fact that Quincies can't absorb Hollow reiatsu without having their souls destroyed in the process, so the opposite might still be possible though.   Take this with a grain of salt since I just thought of it, but remembering As Nodt, who was a human close to death and afraid of going to hell, I think at least some of the Quincies' powers, -and maybe you can pinpoint it further to the members of the Sternritter- are allegories or representations of the feelings or circumstances they had or were in as they were about to die. Since Pernida's power is physical compression (The Compulsory), maybe that had something to do with his death, and what he wanted to escape was losing his consciousness, reasonability or his humanity.   After all that, and if we assume he turned into a Quincy in a way similar as As Nodt's, I'd say Pernida was a human (or a ""normal"" Quincy, since they are some sort of spiritually aware humans) who was about to suffer a painful death with a more physical than psychological ""dimension"" (as opposed to the, for example, psychological suffering of As Nodt before Ywach reached out to him)."

Aizen, Shunsui, Isshin, Shinji, Ukitake, Kenpachi, and Urahara have not used bankai so they definitely aren't at full strength.   Yourichi hasn't even shown her zanpakuto.  Technically guys like Ichigo, Nel, Uryu, Grimmjow haven't fought at full strength yet but will all likely will.  Then there's Chad who may or may not be useful, Kubo probably flips a coin deciding on this.  A lot will justifiably choose Aizen or Shunsui as do I but I'll be hipster and say Shinji.

bleach,375yi8,CRAEREASDW,6,Wed May 27 01:53:43 2015 UTC,"The Stands from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure are essentially manifestations of immense will and spirit power, with the same caveat that Komamura's Bankai has: damage taken by the Stand reflects back to the user. I have a feeling that most Stand users from the series could face most average enemies, and the most powerful could fight and potentially even defeat the most powerful from Bleach.   If we can use manga characters from the series, Giorno Giovanna with the power of the Arrow could ragdoll anyone in Bleach. His evolved Stand, ""Gold Experience Requiem"", has the special ability of ""negating cause"". This prevents both it and Giorno from being attacked at all (so much that it's thought that he survived, or at least could have survived a series of universal resets and periods of vastly accelerated time that claimed the rest of reality), and prevented his enemy from ever achieving the finality of death, being forced to live out every conceivable way to die on an endless loop for all of eternity. The worst thing Yhwach or Aizen could do to him is stare him down; nothing they do will ever reach GioGio, while he can assure them a fate worse than death.  If I'm limited to anime characters and developments, then most users could deal with most random jobbers. Recent anime Asshole Cool Ice Vanilla Ice would be interesting to see; while he is a fanatic lacking in the brains, his Stand ""Cream"" (take a second and figure out the pun) is incredibly powerful, being able to generate an area around it and simply erase space, and be perfectly protected (Stand and user) while doing so, with the only drawback being that the user can't see and is a Vampire and has the usual weaknesses (and strengths) that come with it. Otherwise, Poster Child Jotaro can use his ""Star Platinum"" to punch through material as hard as diamond, has broken a katana (glorious Nippon steel folded a thousand times) in recent memory, and can punch pretty hard. It can also extend its fingers incredibly fast and incredibly hard (Star Finger ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), and, shortly, will be able to stop time entirely, for a short period of time."

A lot of them had proper death scenes, and some of those death scenes were meaningful. It would feel forced.  The only way I can see him getting away with resurrection at this point is if he brings back some old Sternritter from 1,000 years ago. It's possible all this Soul King business has made him nostalgic, so he'll use the overflowing power to resurrect his old Schutzstaffel, and we'll finally be able to see the unknown Schrifts and some of the ones that weren't used to their full extent. I'd like to see:   Sternritter K: The Knowledge, representing omniscience. I like the idea of it being someone with the surname Domino if Shaz was the real K, but it'd also be kinda nice to see BG1. Maybe the original Sternritter K actually was a Domino, but made himself into a cyborg and renamed himself BG. Sternritter N: The Navigate/Navigation/Nimble, representing omnipresence. Again, it'd be nice if they were also an Accutrone. Sternritter L: The Love, representing omnibenevolence. I'd like a female, more dignified version of PePe. A real Marie Laveau-style voodoo queen would be welcome.   And the fourth would be Uryuu, representing omnipotence. Since he's still alive, Yhwach wouldn't have to resurrect an Ishida.

bleach,374ny3,Terosan,30,Sun May 24 21:07:15 2015 UTC,Nothing has ever beaten the Ichigo vs. Byakuya fight for me. It felt like the only time Ichigo ever actually used his bankai correctly.
bleach,374ny3,Hungy15,11,Sun May 24 21:43:03 2015 UTC,I agree that that was one good fight. I give bonus points for the badass entrance too.  And it always bothered me that the amazing speed Ichigo had just faded away during the arrancar arc.
bleach,374ny3,Hungy15,9,Sun May 24 21:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was strange to me that Kubo seemed to take his bankai's only strength and then never use it again. Just made Ichigo so boring, all he ever did was getsuga tensho. I'm really hoping he gains some actual new fighting techniques in this arc (the new cross getsuga is at least a step in the right direction)."
bleach,374ny3,Alluka-,3,Sun May 24 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, Ichigo's power was restricted during the Arrancar arc. That's why he seemed so much weaker than before."
bleach,374ny3,Hungy15,1 point,Mon May 25 04:00:24 2015 UTC,Even after the Arrancar arc though Ichigo is never crazy fast like he was in that fight. I do kinda understand why Kubo did it though as simply being faster than his opponents would pretty much auto win every fight for Ichigo which makes for a boring Shonen. I just wish he had been given a more robust set of abilities at the start if they were just going to drop his main attribute.
bleach,374ny3,richiegraine,1 point,Mon May 25 04:19:03 2015 UTC,And for an in universe explanation it could probably be because moving that fast was too much for his body to handle so he had to dial it back or end up hurting himself. Besides he does get a power increase in bankai. It's just hard to see because he doesn't use shikai as much as he used to imo.
bleach,374ny3,Tiresieas,2,Mon May 25 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"I thought it was explained that he was limiting his own power (thus speed) because he was afraid of White, even after learning how to draw out his mask, which just compounded after Ulquiorra and up until after his Hyperbolic Time Chamb- Dangai training session.  Though it's also possible that everyone else's speed just scaled up. I thought the Grimmjow fight round 3 was shown to be pretty fast, and that Orihime could barely keep up with what was happening, though I could be wrong in that respect."
bleach,374ny3,richiegraine,1 point,Mon May 25 08:37:56 2015 UTC,You might be right on both points I forgot about White and Grimmjow was pretty fast in his Ressureccion.

bleach,374ny3,mostafasalah,12,Sun May 24 21:58:50 2015 UTC,Kyōraku vs Starrk. One of the few fights were Kubo employed strategy and treachery. I also loved how everything escalated gradually and perfectly from just swinging swords to explosions and backstabbing abilities.
bleach,374ny3,Shunsui_for_CC,10,Sun May 24 23:28:05 2015 UTC,"Unohana vs Zaraki - This fight had both epicness and sadness. Zaraki crying, Unohana's inner thoughts, everything was nice.

The 2nd was totally unnecessary and made Ichigo look like an even bigger bitch (and I understand thats the point.)

I really liked Stark's FKT fights too, he was a cool character with a creative design. I feel like I'm alone in saying this, but I also really enjoyed Ginjo vs Ichigo too, mainly because of the animation quality towards the end of the series."
bleach,374ny3,assertiveguy,4,Sun May 24 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"I know Yammy isn't anyone's favorite character, but i somehow liked most of his fights. Specially those against Ichigo. That fight they had after the fight with Ulquiorra was pretty cool, and it's a shame it got interrupted by Byakuya and Kenpachi - and than the fight between the three was lame. I like the idea of a normal-sized character fighting super strong hulks on equal ground. Seeing Yammy get his ass handed to him by Ichigo, Yoruichi and even Urahara was sweet for me.     But, if I had to choose a favorite fight, I'd go with the majority: Ichigo vs Byakuya was really well made, relevant to the plot, and was the first time we saw Ichigo's bankai and hollow mask (incomplete).  Some of the fights in the FKT arc were good too, like Barrangan vs. everyone, Ichigo vs. Gin and, of course, FGT Ichigo vs. Aizen (mostly for the design of Ichigo's powers - the fight in itself was a bit boring)."

I loved the way sukishima messed with byakuya and exposed his flaw and the war byakuya killed him was imo the most badass moment in the whole series.

bleach,374ny3,darthnick426,1 point,Wed May 27 20:45:37 2015 UTC,I'm sorry my friend but...  Byakuya is a pedestal that Renji won't ever be able to surpass in this series in my opinion. Byakuya is just too powerful for Renji to reach. Byakuya's zanpakuto powers are just infinitely more powerful and deadly. Zanapkuto powers aside Byakuya out classes him in every category. Shunpo? Byakuya is one of the fastest in Soul Society. Kido? Byakuya is one of the most powerful practitioners. Swordsmenship? Byakuya's sword skills are second to none. Byakuya is in a damn class of his own man. But that means Renji will always have that drive to get even stronger so that's a plus.  Though this may be my Byakuya favoritism kicking in. He is my favorite character after all.
bleach,374ny3,redditrandomacc,2,Wed May 27 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"Banned from /r/Renji.  But no, you're totally correct :p it was just banter.  It was a cool plot point in the SS Arc but it seems that Kubo/Renji/Byakuya have move passed that.  Then again, it kind of has been addressed (to me at least) and has concluded.  Going off what this panel said in chapter 140, Renji has definitely gotten past his insecurities of Byakuya's strength and can be considered an equal (not strength-wise, obviously, more like confidence) to the point that he can move forward and achieve other goals.    And don't worry about the Byakuya favoritism, I'm the same with Renji :p.  Other than Byakuya, who are your top 10 favorite characters?  I'm guessing Grimmjow is on that list."

Ichigo Kurosaki - Out of all the series I've watched he is my favorite MC Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez - Grimmjow motherfucking Jaegerjaquez.  That is all. Sajin Komamura - All time favorite captain.  I liked his storyline with Tousen and that whole dynamic (including Hisagi). Gin Ichimaru - I never thought he was a bad guy, a total dick yes, but hell Kubo you did such a good job with his character. Ulquiorra Cifer - My favorite Espada, an old comment will say why Aizen - Made Bleach into the awesome story it is. Rukia Kuchiki - I love how Bleach started with Rukia narrating while standing on a telephone pole and just how the beginning of Bleach was centered around her.  Actually, this is my phone's wallpaper.   Orihime Inoue - Here scenes usually make me laugh and how she impacted Ulquiorra. Rōjūrō (Rose) Ōtoribashi - Favorite Visard other than Shinji, it used to be Shinji and it could easily change once we see him in an actual fight this arc, just recently he has been getting shafted (just like the other Visards ]: )   My next top five six seven:     Shunsui  Hisagi Nel Uuryu Ikkaku/Yumichika  Mayuri Byakuya"

And the fight between Yhwach and Ichibe was good was because of how epic the scale of Ichibe's powers were, just the line said by Kuroari (Yhwach) ""This....

Too often Bleach has one opponent dominating the other until the dominated opponent pulls an ace from their sleeve and becomes the dominator. My only complaint about this fight is that neither of them truly went all out and we were robbed of how epic it would've been.

bleach,373aop,KillerAdvice,6,Sun May 24 14:16:16 2015 UTC,"Not that we know of. Ultimately it comes down to the Zanpakutou spirit's decision to allow their Shinigami to have Bankai, and Kenpachi has a unique relationship with his Zanpakutou in that it was tied to his shackling of his own power. Now that he's unshackled, Nozarashi respects him enough to tell him his name, and would probably trust him with Bankai.  But I think the spirit manifestation portion of Bankai training would prove difficult for Kenny. I'd rather see him explore other methods of empowerment before being able to use Bankai. I imagine he could be capable of some Shinigami equivalent of Vollstaendig by removing his eyepatch and fully releasing his power. Maybe a stable manifestation of his Reiatsu, like the skull he's manifested multiple times but in solid form?"
bleach,373aop,Andygoesrawr,4,Sun May 24 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"Question about the lore: is knowing the name all it takes? Usually one has to develop a deep relationship with their Zanpakutou spirit to earn the right to learn the name but once they can call it, they can use the power right? I always assumed at the end of Ichigo's Bankai training Zangetsu told him to call out Tensa Zangetsu and then it all clicked. But what if Ichibei told a 4th seat officer the true name of their Zanpakutou when they only had just begun to understand their shikai? Or does it take more than knowing the name?"
bleach,373aop,JakabBigShow64,2,Sun May 24 18:01:34 2015 UTC,I don't think we have enough information about this.  We could probably assume that Ichibi would never tell anyone the true name of their Zanpakto if they did not deserve it.

The furigana for his name are quite clear. (Unless the scans used were obscenely terrible, but his name was well known via other means...) And most issues are corrected by Kubo revealing the proper romaji, not Viz. Anybody else remember when he 1. did chapter title pages and 2. they featured new characters (often with the name)?  This issue mostly comes from non-Japanese names because the kana can't be taken literally and interpretation comes into play."

That's about when Bleach started getting popular and a bunch of scanlators jumped in who had no idea what Bleach was. The fandom knew the names, but they did not. Like the time a group translating from Chinese had Zangetsu's name as 'Kitsuki'.

If you want to see good industrial Anime coloring with good line work you should look at Death Note and Hellsign Ultimate anime.

bleach,3720c5,D1V1NEONE,2,Sun May 24 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"You don't need a tablet to color my man! It just helps. And when coloring your going to want to use the lineart/manga panel unless you really want to draw it all yourself, which even then you should add some black lines to differentiate. Anyway, in photoshop if you create another layer on top of the lines and switch the blending mode to Multiply, the colors won't go over the lineart. Another way to do it is to duplicate the lineart layer, then go to channels. From there there is a button on the bottom that looks like a circle that's made up out of dashed lines. If you click that it selects all the white of the page and you can hit backspace to delete it all, leaving you with just the black lines. Then you can make layers underneath that layer to color as the color will be below the lines. I don't even know if you want this advice lol, but I hope you take it because I think if you did you could be quite good."

Once you have removed the whites, go back to the layers panel and hit Lock Transparent Pixels, then edit>fill with black. The channels process can't get rid of the white right next to the black, so this makes those pixels black so it looks nicer."

bleach,370ovf,Shunsui_for_CC,4,Sat May 23 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"We don't know why yet. We know that Hollows and Quincies are antitheses (essentially matter and antimatter), and we know that humans have the antibodies that allow the two to mingle without destroying one another, but we don't know why Hollows lack Quincy antibodies and Quincies lack Hollow antibodies. The most logical guess would be that Quincies were created to be the exact opposite of Hollows or vice versa, but we don't know the nature of Yhwach's creation yet. This is why a flashback arc is desperately needed.  As for Shinigami, kinda. Nothing is poisonous in the same way Hollows and Quincies are poisonous to each other (as far as we know), but Shinigami souls are still carefully balanced so an injection of another soul type would be poisonous without a vaccine."

bleach,370ovf,AddSomeCerea,2,Sun May 24 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"The way Urahara explains it is that Quincy souls lack the spiritual equivalent of antibodies that ""naturally"" fight against Hollowification.  In essence, at the soul level, Quincy souls have no defense against Hollow encroachment.  Rather than consume the heart, and cause the victim to become Hollow, the soul would simply be destroyed - ""Soul Suicide"".  From that explanation, we can assume that ""normal"" souls (Plus) have some amount of resistance.  When encroached, they don't undergo ""Soul Suicide"", instead their souls become Hollow themselves.  Shinigami appear to have a much higher resistance than Plus - they're not in danger of undergoing ""natural"" Hollowification in the way Plus are.  They're still vulnerable, if Hollow material is inserted into their soul - but they won't undergo that process naturally, as a Plus would.  In Masaki's case, Urahara tied Isshin's Shinigami powers directly to the encroaching Hollow influence (White's remnant), in order to stabilize her.  The introduction of Isshin's Shinigami powers provided her soul with defense against the encroachment.  In the case of the Vizards, the Hollow influence was already within their soul - past their defenses.  Urahara used energy from a Quincy Helig Pfeil to stabilize them.  Most likely, he was taking advantage of the unique property of Quincy energy to completely annihilate Hollows.  By putting a bit of that into the Vizards souls, it provided a way to halt the encroachment.  The damage that was already done wasn't reversible, but at least they weren't consumed."
bleach,370ovf,yukeake,3,Tue May 26 12:27:36 2015 UTC,"Think of Quincy as pure souls. They have no 'immunity' or 'resistance' to other species' influence.  Hollow are tainted souls (ones whose heart is now their mask). For this analogy, think of them as a disease or virus.  Now, if a disease or virus (a Hollow) were to come into contact with a body that has no resistance or immunity to them (a Quincy), the disease or virus will eventually and inevitably take over the body.   As an in-universe example, for Masaki, that meant that her soul would be destroyed. By using Isshin as a stabilizer, her soul was still tainted but not taken over. (Almost as if her soul was developing a resistance to White.)"

bleach,370ovf,inoneear_outtheother,2,Sun May 24 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"Quincy are humans with a pure lineage that began with Yhwach, Father of the Quincy.  Other humans are either like the parakeet kid or all the other ones we saw. They don't have spiritual power and are unaware of spiritual beings.  Shinigami are human souls that have spiritual power (and, quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if they are somehow related to the Soul King) and are gathered to protect the Soul King and the balance of the worlds that he created.  Hollow are tainted souls of either regular human souls or Shinigami. When purified, they may either be a regular soul or a spiritually aware one. I would assume, though, that the transformation into a Hollow is merely a break in the soul cycle and the soul continues its path once purified.  Yhwach is the reason for the mutation of Quincy souls, based on his power and pure lineage. Shinigami most likely are just stronger souls than others. Weak souls would be ones that were spiritually unaware, weaker souls would be ones that only see outlines of souls (like Ichigo's younger sister), strong souls can see souls and would most likely comprise of the Shinigami who make up the lowest ranks, and the stronger/strongest souls become (Vice-) Captains. Hollow are those that are unable to pass on, their hearts become empty, and so they wear their hearts as masks to hide the pain they're feeling. Devouring other souls supposedly satiates that pain.  And that's how I see all of this."
bleach,370ovf,Aaroniero,4,Sun May 24 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"My guess as to why:  Quincy and Shinigami are opposites. Hollows and Humans are opposites.   Quincy and Shinigami are opposites I assume because Quincy are a)human and b)because Quincies have the natural ability to break apart reishi, of which Shinigami (and Hollows) are made. It's never really said, but I assume that when a Quincy kills a shinigami, they're also removed from the reincarnation cycle. So, Yama is gone. Forever. So I guess Quincies are ""poisonous"" to Shinigami.   Hollows and Humans: that makes sense why they are opposites. Hollows were humans. And Quincies are Human, so Hollows being ""poisonous"" to them also makes sense, because a Hollow has a need to devour a human."

bleach,370ovf,JinHikari,2,Sat May 23 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"Going off of this image (Potential spoilers if you haven't read Bleach in the last six months or so): http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1379/04/1379040781300.jpg  Shinigami harness their inner power through their Zanpakuto, items made of artificial hollows (asauchi) that allow them to use the powers they would have as hollows without losing their humanity in the process.  Because of this, the energies of Shinigami and Hollows are actually quite close to each other, meaning both are opposed by Quincy energy. The two (technically three?) types of power aren't poisonous to one another, they're simply opposites that cancel each other out."
bleach,370ovf,Rocksbury,1 point,Sun May 24 06:22:37 2015 UTC,"Me thinks Shinigami are hollows given Quincy souls as Blades. Therefore you never kill a group but you dont let them free able to kill hollows and upset the balance.  The Quincy can absorb power and use it. It makes sense to break them down to basic souls and absorb the power of the sword wielder and become a reflection of the soul. Aizen breaking the Shinigami hollow barrier, plu adding his sword made him go into his OP level."

He's usually serious but not to that degree."
bleach,36zmli,SometimesY,6,Sat May 23 14:35:57 2015 UTC,I agree. Also the way he speaks about Benihime I get the feeling his zanpakuto spirit is a rather blood-thirsty lady. After all his techniques in shikai are all based on blood.
bleach,36zmli,29thspirit,2,Sat May 23 19:27:10 2015 UTC,That's what I thought at first but the way his character unfolds into this seemingly all knowing being when all he has to work with is a small shop with not much in the way of surveillance equipment and how he always seemingly know where to find everyone just made me think it gave him some kind of all seeing thing
bleach,36zmli,Humble_Shopkeeper,6,Sat May 23 15:18:07 2015 UTC,'Not meant/Unsuitable for training' likely means just that: The bankai isn't suited for training other people. Sui-feng's bankai is a good example; it's a fucking nuke.

bleach,36w920,materhern,3,Fri May 22 21:23:07 2015 UTC,Character arc  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc
bleach,36w920,fellatious_argument,2,Fri May 22 23:01:41 2015 UTC,"Character arc:       As opposed to the plotline of a story, a character arc, or transformation, or inner journey  is a description of what happens to the inside of a character over the course of the story. He begins as one sort of person in the beginning; things happen to and around him, gradually moving him in an ""arc"" that ends when the story is over. The lead character is a different person at the other end of the arc.  A character begins the narrative with certain viewpoints that change through events in the narrative, in part because he must adapt to changes throughout the storyline. In many narratives, the main characters or protagonists seem unable to resolve their problems because they lack the skills to overcome the forces of antagonism that confront them. This flaw is a driving element of the story's plot.  In order to improve their predicaments, not only do they often learn new skills but also must arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness and capability. In turn, they can only achieve such awareness in contact with their environment and usually mentors and co-protagonists aid them. The new awareness changes who they are or are becoming. A character arc affects the protagonist in a narrative, although other characters can go through similar changes.

bleach,36w3f9,Ziazan,3,Sat May 23 15:40:57 2015 UTC,If you are talking about Nozarashi that is his Shikai.
bleach,36w3f9,Alluka-,3,Sat May 23 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"Either that's the a pretty good attempt at trolling or I did miss it. Cite source? As far as I remember, he released shikai in the fight against Gremmy when he had to gut down the meteor that was going to destroy SS."
bleach,36w3f9,theemptycove,1 point,Sat May 23 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"either that, or he thought that was his bankai."
bleach,36w3f9,LucciDVergo,-4,Sun May 24 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"moreover, i never complained about the absence of character development in the past.   In fact, I would like to see SOME thing significant happen, something interesting - anything that meaningfully progresses the story. And that doesn't necessarily have to be character development... maybe some plot development?"
bleach,36w3f9,uh_oh_hotdog,5,Fri May 22 20:51:01 2015 UTC,I wasn't directing my statement at you personally. It was a generalization because of how much hate I see these past 2 chapters get.  There was plot development. Both parties are at the Soul Palace and we see what Yhwach has done with some of his new abilities. It might not have been huge but it's definitely progression.
bleach,36w3f9,Yukiyuki_,7,Fri May 22 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"Growing trend? Sometimes its short, sometimes its average... Not really a trend"

bleach,36w3f9,izn1337,6,Sat May 23 00:56:01 2015 UTC,I liked the chapter lol.
bleach,36w3f9,LucciDVergo,2,Fri May 22 23:54:25 2015 UTC,"The chapter was like the kenpachi vs gremmy set-up. That set-up was only 10 seconds of the anime. But it was a set-up of a awesome fight, so does this one. Epic fights incoming"
bleach,36w3f9,materhern,4,Sat May 23 00:55:30 2015 UTC,I don't mind. We have 626 other chapters and it took years to get to this point.  Honestly when bleach is over and the close fans are stuck with nothing for decades minus the possibility of a non canon movie or if a miracle happens and we get a spin off we will be desperate for a couple pages of nothing.
bleach,36w3f9,materhern,2,Fri May 22 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"In this time, I'd just pile up few chapters before I start reading them, but since I've loads of other things to do, waiting for whole week seems nothing to me. Plus, I wouldn't care less if the next few chapters will be just talk and stuff because I know there's going to be huge thing happening soon, going with this pace will only make this arc longer which is (kindof) a good thing (yeah most of them won't agree with me but that's my two cents) since this is the last arc of Bleach and I particularly wanted to enjoy every moment of it, I don't want Kubo to rush things up just to finish this arc soon."
bleach,36w3f9,ElJefe10,5,Sat May 23 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"So the return of all the characters we've seen over the past 5 or so chapters is a trend of no content just because this one was a transition?    Edit: Instead of a DV, hb, explain?"
bleach,36w3f9,materhern,0,Fri May 22 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"I love Bleach and need to see how it ends.  But the last year or two I've been very disappointed with very few Chapters that I would consider ""good reads"".  I won't stop waiting for each new chapter every week, but I'm tired of being disappointed."
bleach,36w3f9,ElJefe10,-7,Fri May 22 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"ditto for me.  But I hate to say this - I think Tito is tired of Bleach and maybe needs to end the series, take a long break and come back with something entirely new."
bleach,36w3f9,materhern,3,Fri May 22 17:05:51 2015 UTC,"He looks like he's rushing to get to the end.  People think we have a year left, but we've gone from one or two people up there, to now everyone is going to be in the same place in a chapter or two.  I can see this ending this year.  People won't be very happy with it I think, but I can see it."
bleach,36w3f9,Exastick,6,Fri May 22 17:11:53 2015 UTC,But... there are so many bankais left to unravel...
bleach,36w3f9,materhern,2,Fri May 22 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a chance in hell we see everyone elses bankai honestly.  I'd love to see them all, but he's just blown past seriously good opportunities to use them.  How did we not see Shinji's bankai against Bazz B's strongest attack? Naw, I think we will see the end of the series without seeing everyones bankai.  But man I really really want to see Shunsui's."
bleach,36w3f9,Keranu,4,Fri May 22 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can't stand how Shinji has had no development or real battle moments, so much wasted potential.  Shunsui's bankai is a must. If he doesn't show that one ill buy a plane ticket to japan along with a translator to bitch him out personally. and if he isn't home ill take a dump on his front porch and reshape it to read ""Shunsui""."

bleach,36tkft,lamka,1 point,Fri May 22 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"good timeline-ish-thingy. just two things i wanna add. Pre-reforging Zangetsu was a Quincy spirit construct similar to the Ishida's Kojaku or Ywach's sword. not sure if that means that every hollow he killed was passed to Soul Society, given to Ywach, or simply had their soul destroyed.And for how much the Substitute badge restricted him; 20% of full power seems like a good base to start given as that is the same level as the Gentei Kaijo."
bleach,36tkft,Vindicare241,2,Fri May 22 00:41:48 2015 UTC,"Pre-reforging Zangetsu was a Quincy spirit construct similar to the Ishida's Kojaku or Ywach's sword.   Pre-FGT, I don't think this should be the case.  Post-Fullbring, Pre-forging, there's an argument that can be made, though I'm not sure that I agree that it's wholly a ""Quincy spirit construct"".  ""Zangetsu"" was a zanpakuto formed by Ichigo's imprint upon White's remnant, which acted the part of an Asauchi due to having a similar composition.  While abnormal, it should still be considered a zanpakuto.  OMZ's involvement was in both suppressing and controlling the ""Shinigami side"" of Zangetsu's power, as well as lying to Ichigo about being ""Zangetsu"" himself.  He effectively served as ""gatekeeper"" to Ichigo's power up until Bankai - where the reishi strand tying White's remnant (now Zangetsu's Hollow side) to Isshin's Shinigami powers broke, allowing Hichigo/Zangetsu to gain ascendency.  Post-Fullbring, after having his reiatsu engine ""jump-started"", there's some very odd things about Ichigo's powers.  First, and most troubling to me is that between being ""re-powered"" and the forging, neither OMZ nor Hichigo/Zangetsu make an appearance at all.  Given what's happened, and how chatty they both were, this feels wrong.  Second, his state seems ""brittle"" and easily broken.  Both Ivan and Haschwald break parts - Haschwald breaking Ichigo's Bankai blade with ease, seemingly without activating any special powers.  While Haschwald is undoubtedly very, very strong, the ease with which he breaks Ichigo's blade seems wrong.  Third, both blades (Shikai and Bankai) are exact replicas of those used by figures important to Ichigo's past, but of whom Ichigo himself is unaware at this point in time.  The Shikai blade is the blade of Yhwach's sword, without the crossguard/hilt (Ichigo is unaware of the connection between Yhwach and OMZ at this time).  The Bankai blade is one of White's armblades (and Ichigo is certainly unaware of White at this point).  This ties in with the activation of Ichigo's Quincy abilities a bit earlier.  Yhwach states that Ichigo's Quincy powers awoke because he completely expended himself within Quirge's jail.  Having been expended, his body absorbed reiatsu from its surroundings - including that of the jail itself.  Exposure of Ichigo's core to that reiatsu ""awakened the memory of Quincy powers latent in his blood"". Basically saying that it caused Ichigo's soul to ""remember"" his Quincy heritage.  If that's the case - I think it's possible that Ichigo's blades and abilities in this state could also be ""memories"", rather than a ""proper"" zanpakuto.  His Shikai state, which he closely internally associates with OMZ (who is, ultimately, a soul fragment of Yhwach), and his Bankai state, which he closely associates with his Hollow form (which, of course, is based on White, whose remnant acted as his original Asauchi).  It's something of a crackpot theory, but it makes sense of things that otherwise don't - at least to me."
bleach,36tkft,yukeake,1 point,Fri May 22 13:07:14 2015 UTC,"Good gathering of information.  The only thing I can't understand about Ichigo's inner world is Tensa Zangetsu, whom we see when Ichigo enters while in his bankai. He denies being OMZ, he isn't White since we see him emerging a few seconds after. He's, however, able to melt with White. Now, for my understanding, Tensa Zangetsu, the real Zanpakuto, is stated as a Hollow, but he's not White. TZ would be the hollow Ichigo was close to become when he obtained his Shinigamis powers. Ichigo emerged from Urahara's chain-corrosive hole about to become a Hollow, already wearing a mask. This would explain why we have two characters inside Ichigo apart from OMZ, both hollows, that can merged together, without one interfering from the other (Ichigo's capacity to mantain bankai while Hollowed).   BTW, I don't think Ichigo searched to supress his Hollow but more to be able to use it without going crazy. Ichigo's Hollowded form gives him a great amount of power, which he knows he needs to defeat the Espadas, who are powerful even before their resurrection (maybe even more powerful that the Gotei 13 Ichigo fought). It's really hard for me to see Ichigo been weaker in Las Noches than he was in the Seretei. He was already tired by the fight against Grimjoww to know if he could have taken Noitra on his own, at full power, which Kenpachi was. If the Gotei was able so easily to fight the Espadas, I think it was because of training after the Soul Society Arc (and even then Renji and Ishida would have been defeated if it wasn't for Kurotsuchi, which show the power of the Arrancar)."
bleach,36tkft,blaziken24,3,Fri May 22 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"Ichigo was trying to suppress his Hollow. See the Byakuya fight, the Ulquiorra and Yammy fight, and the reason he went into Vizard training. He hated his hollow and didn't want it to take over. So much so to the point where he offered Ulquiorra to cut off his limbs to make it even."

bleach,36tkft,blaziken24,1 point,Fri May 22 04:39:07 2015 UTC,"""Tensa Zangetsu"" was most likely OMZ's non-ascendant form.  At that point he was still perpetuating the lie that he was ""Zangetsu"" (which he didn't come clean on until the forging), but Hichigo/Zangetsu was the ascendant portion of the amalgam of Ichigo's power."
bleach,36tkft,yukeake,1 point,Fri May 22 10:28:44 2015 UTC,I have a really hard time believing the Hollow replaced Zangetsu. Isshin has Engetsu and knows the technique that Ichigo will learn. Which means that power is Shinigami in nature and not completely Hollow/Quincy.  It's cool to look back and see how many times he didnt use any of his soul reaper powers. I think without a doubt in my mind Yhwach pre-soul king fusion was afraid or at least concerned about Ichigo waking his powers up.   Unless the hollow really was able to consume his shinigami power but if thats true how would they be able to awaken his powers? If they had been consumed are they not converted into the hollows power?
bleach,36tkft,Rocksbury,0,Fri May 22 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"And he doesn't become weaker either after his inner hollow awakens. He does get stronger, but his oppenents were that much stronger than he was. More so in the case of Ulquiorra than Grimmjow, but Grimmjow was stronger than Ichigo, and only lost due to the plot."
bleach,36tkft,reigun91,2,Fri May 22 03:36:10 2015 UTC,"He actually does get a lot weaker. Ichigos Bankai became pretty useless and he didn't have OMZs power anymore after Soul Society arc. He doubted his own powers and had a bad relationship with his Zanpakuto. If you have a bad relationship with it, you become much weaker. Grimmjow wasn't very powerful at all. Ulquiorra on the other hand was and it took his hollow completely taking over to beat Ulquiorra."

bleach,36tkft,reigun91,1 point,Fri May 22 04:26:47 2015 UTC,"It's technically both.  His Bankai certainly made him stronger, but Hichigo also became ascendant and began fighting to encroach.  Ichigo - at this point believing that OMZ was ""Zangetsu"" simply views Hichigo/Zangetsu as ""the Hollow"" and ""his enemy"", so he makes no effort to come to an understanding - he just fights against it.  That fight against his own power, and his fear of encroachment made him weak."

Sometimes the anime just changes stuff, like in the Kyouraku vs. Starrk fight.

bleach,36pq10,kisae,2,Fri May 22 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"Technically, she doesn't have ""healing powers"" - her power appears to be reality rejection.    What she's doing when ""healing"" is rejecting the event that caused the wound.  So far as local reality is concerned, the event that caused the wound never occurred, so neither did the wound itself.  It's heavily implied during her time in HM that her powers are limited only by her willpower.  In theory, were she motivated enough, it's possible that she could reject anything - though her personality and general lack of self-confidence get in the way.  Kubo missed a prime opportunity to show the full extent of her powers, back when Ulquiorra ""killed"" Ichigo.  Trope-wise with these sorts of personality-limited characters, a traumatic event (or mind control/possession) ""breaks"" them, causing the true magnitude of their powers to surface temporarily. Ichigo's death certainly would seem to qualify.  Instead of this, we got a few pages of ""Kurosaki-kun!"" and then Hichigo's full (and glorious) encroachment."

They didn't meet as children either, Sora died only three years prior to the start of Bleach.   I think Orihime initially had a minor crush on Ichigo, starting from the time they met at the clinic. After she entered the same class as Ichigo at Karakura High School, this developed into a full blown crush.

I think at that point the sole advantage Shunsui would have is that he already knows most, if not all, the games to be played and their various rules whereas others don't."

bleach,36n6u8,mindseye84,2,Wed May 20 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on how figurative his ""Balance"" ability is.  If Shunsui's foreknowledge of the rules is enough to ""tip the scale"", it could be an early advantage for Haschwald.  On the other hand, if Shunsui's games affect him as much as his opponent, a string of bad luck on Shunsui's part could ultimately give him the advantage when Haschwald's power activates.  Taking a huge risk to gain an advantage and turn the opponent's ability against them seems very much like something Shunsui would do."

bleach,36jt40,Minktons,57,Tue May 19 22:22:39 2015 UTC,It was the beginning of the greatest relationship in bleach: ChadxGround
bleach,36jt40,reigun91,6,Tue May 19 23:10:17 2015 UTC,"really though, its kind of annoying that the only competent humans of ichigos group are ishida and ichigo, why can't chad be like captain level. it feels like there are too many side characters in bleach with all the shinigami."
bleach,36jt40,sora677,8,Wed May 20 03:17:21 2015 UTC,Ishida's competent? He did nothing in Hueco Mundo and is literally the only person in the series to lose to one of the Xcutioners. Even on the winning side he hasn't done anything but set the plot back like 20 chapters. Based on the fact that all of the Quincy are super powerful and Ishida isn't I'd say he might actually be the 2nd most incompetent member of the group. 1st place of course going to the girl capable of warping reality but is literally too incompetent to use her powers.
bleach,36jt40,maytagem,5,Wed May 20 11:35:22 2015 UTC,"In fairness to him, he took down Mayuri"
bleach,36jt40,seratheanos,7,Wed May 20 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"And when ichigo used a similar style power up, he took down Aizen :D"
bleach,36jt40,sephtis,4,Wed May 20 15:11:14 2015 UTC,But... Mayuri made the chair.
bleach,36jt40,Sutanreyu,2,Fri May 22 03:30:36 2015 UTC,Couldnt have said it better myself.
bleach,36jt40,Manixxz,2,Wed May 20 11:40:10 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree re: Ishida, but he's definitely going to get some kind of a hax powerup soon (if he hasn't already off-panel).  It's been foretold on a few different occasions (Bach naming him as his successor, Kirge being shocked when Ichigo told him his arrows were stronger than Ishida's, etc.)"
bleach,36jt40,emusentinel,2,Wed May 20 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"I believe Ishida has already had a massive power-up, but it wasn't from Chewy Bark.  This was his bow in Hueco Mundo: https://youtu.be/ooDHmC4g4qI?t=70  And this is what his bow looked like when he helped Ichigo take on Ginjo. https://youtu.be/K_JzM5sJJro?t=630  It's no longer an unstable bow made of basic condensed Reishi. His Reishi manipulation is now so powerful and precise he can completely recreate physical objects. We haven't seen him fight properly with his new strength, but I for one really love how much Ichigo's friends progressed in their training while he was powerless, and it most definitely will not be a case of Deus Ex Machina when Ishida shucks fit up."

bleach,36jt40,whitemoonrising,3,Wed May 20 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"I do. I'm an Uryu fan, so I'm biased (see: flair), but I always thought he was the strongest of Ichigo's friends. In terms of speed, power, and intellect, it seems he trumps Chad and Orihime in all three. Not to mention, he's had more of a role in the story than both of them combined. Chad barely had a role in his own arc. When all is said and done, I think he'll be the strongest of Ichigo's friends by a long shot, and probably even one of the high tiers of Bleach.  EDIT: I don't see this happening, but I think it would be awesome if Uryu were the one chosen to rebuild the Quincy society... only this time staying within the necessary bounds for all dimensions and imparting virtue and justice. Seems like a really poetic way to close out his character. Now if only him and Orihime could hook up and have Quincy babies... sigh."

I don't think that scene was meant to portray the actual length of time Chad spent running, but rather that it was deliberately exaggerated to show the weight of the moment and how monumental it was for Chad... which provided necessary contrast to show the vast difference in their strength when Shunsui defeated the whole thing in an instant."

That moment was captured much more dramatically in the manga due to the ""instant feeling"" of the counterattack.  I do watch the anime, but it's mostly just to see if they did a good job capturing the manga's greatest moments.  This came close but they overdid the running."

bleach,36jt40,Martin1225,1 point,Tue May 19 23:13:38 2015 UTC,"Kubo does nothing for Chad because of fandom opinion, I believe. If you look at the popularity polls, Chad is always ranked super low. If he was as popular as Hitsugaya, for example, he'd likely get a lot more screentime.   Granted, that does bring up the chicken-vs-egg question:  did Chad's popularity dwindle because Kubo made him suck, or was his popularity always weak?  I'd like to think the former.  Chad has always been an inherently cool character, in my view. Kubo still has time to salvage him; sadly, he might just not care."
bleach,36jt40,emusentinel,6,Wed May 20 17:25:56 2015 UTC,When I started watching Bleach I always thought Chad was going to be super strong just from the fact that hes built like a Tank. Visually he looks the strongest out of anyone else in Bleach (excluding Jinbando and his brother)
bleach,36jt40,Narissis,2,Wed May 20 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"This does beg a question... is Chad marginalized because he's unpopular, or is it the other way around? Maybe he's unpopular because he's marginalized."

bleach,36lh0v,jas0660,7,Wed May 20 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hm... not sure, but after Aizen's rant towards Urahara before the latter sealed him, I suspect there is more to the Soul King than what is told so far... My guess is, that Aizen will turn out the evil guy with the righteous objective, à la 'I had to be the evil guy in order to defeat an even greater evil'..."
bleach,36lh0v,29thspirit,3,Wed May 20 07:52:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot of the ""Urahara is actually the main bad guy"" theory. I personally think he's just thought so far ahead and planned out every possible worst scenario, that people won't follow him if they knew what was coming. Maybe they need to go in blind in order to have the optimism to win."
bleach,36lh0v,omnigetsu,7,Wed May 20 09:07:40 2015 UTC,I'm all in on the urahara is way ahead of everybody thing. My main reason for this is because when Chad and renji were training in urahara's basement rebuild asked why urahara didn't just train him and uraharas told him his bankai isn't meant for training others. At the time I thought that was meant like it was too powerful to train others but the more I watched of the show the more I started to think it may give urahara an omnipresence that lets him see the future and every thing else that's going on
bleach,36lh0v,Shunsui_for_CC,4,Wed May 20 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, i'm kinda sick of Aizen being the villian. He's been the villian for like 10 yrs? I'm really happy that he still has the evil heart but helping the shinigami side. I hope he stays that way... But i can't predict what will happen to Aizen at the end"
bleach,36lh0v,Lightning-Jesus,3,Wed May 20 07:56:43 2015 UTC,I am of the belief the Soul King did exist as sentient being with all his limbs but due to the amount of power and being the Linchpin of the world causing him to me a oppressive ruler. The reason he is limbless and in a crystal is because the Shinigami 'created' him because they couldn't kill him but they were able to suppress his power by removing his limbs. Yhwach is a fail safe created by the Soul King as a conduit for his power. If Yhwach gathers all of the Limbs he will either be taken over by the Soul King or will transfer himself into Uryu.
bleach,36lh0v,ajjuha,1 point,Wed May 20 09:55:17 2015 UTC,that is the best theory that ive ever heard...it explains why aizen rebelled against the soul society....and it explains the purpose of the quincy......yea this post is gonna be the entire plot of tbtp2 or at least will most definitely be talked about in a monologue of some sort

He probably realizes Yhwach is too powerful for him to take alone. Kubo wouldn't rehash this trope again, no matter how lazy you think he is. All the Sternritter suspect this anyway; he's not dumb enough to walk into a trap like that. He realizes the good guys are on their way, and whatever he DOES have planned, he'll probably do when help is close by. This doesn't fit his character archetype. Gin was slimy and consistently compared to a snake, both by himself and others. Uryu has always been honorable and calculated. Can you really see him firing an arrow into Yhwach's back?

Maru is a suffix used for affectionate nicknames for children (usually boys), or the actual names of swords, ships, and pets. It comes from -maro (麿, an old first-person pronoun), and over time the pronunciation shifted to -maru. Since there was already a word pronounced maru, the two got grouped together using the same kanji.  It basically means ""something with a certain attribute"". So if a young boy had bright white hair, he might be called Shiromaru (shiro being white). Hence:   Zabimaru: ""snake tail"" (it looks like a snake tail) Hyourinmaru: ""moon"" (it controls weather like the moon) Hoozukimaru: ""ground cherry"" (the red tassel resembles a ground cherry) Gonryoumaru: ""lightning"" (strikes like lightning, might even have lightning abilities) Tengumaru: ""Tengu"" (this one's a mystery really -- it could refer to the fans Tengu sometimes wield, here being used to create/feed flames)"

bleach,36f1t6,BearZeBubus,4,Tue May 19 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"maru can have several meanings, and to figure out the exact meaning, you need to know the kanji associated with it. In most of those cases, the kanji used for ""maru"" is 丸 which means, ""round, circular."" But Kanji compounds are a funny thing, because when you combine it with something else, it can change names and meaning.   Example = 弾丸 = dougan ""bullet""   Another example: 日の丸 = Hinomaru = ""Circle of the Sun"" AKA the Japanese Flag."
bleach,36f1t6,Six-StringSamurai,2,Mon May 18 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"I believe Kubo uses ""Maru"" for these Zanpakuto because they all involve making some type of circular motion in order to release their particular shikai and bankai.  Let's take Zabimaru, for example. Look at the Kanji Kubo sensei uses for his name: 蛇尾丸  蛇 = Snake 尾 = Tail 丸 = Circle  Maru, is also a suffix used by sailors to name their ships. Similar to the prefix HMS for the UK or USS for the USA, -maru denotes a ship with Japanese origin. The ""Kobayashi-maru"" from Star Trek is a popular example."
bleach,36f1t6,Six-StringSamurai,1 point,Mon May 18 22:23:35 2015 UTC,"Maru can also mean ""correct"", since circle is often used to denote that something is right.  Source: Too much Rinne no Lagrange"

bleach,36dcz0,Aaroniero,-1,Mon May 18 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, but it certainly does. He explains in here that while the size of a soul reaper's sword is dependent on how much reishi he or she possesses, all captains have the ability to control the size of the blade, otherwise they would be hundreds of meters long and wide.  If every captain has in reality a gigantic sword, Gin cannot have a shikai about making his sword bigger. That wouldn't be his personal ability nor would it make sense in story-building. As it turns later, his blade isn't the longest, but the fastest."
bleach,36dcz0,Aaroniero,27,Mon May 18 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"I agree: Isshin's explanation of how zanpakuto works helps understand Gin's ability.

""Foreshadowing"" implies that Isshin was saying something that might specifically call to Gin or his zanpakuto."

Maybe ""hinting"" is more on spot? The thing is we learned a fact about the universe that allows us, the readers, to not even guess but deduce what is Gin's ability. Gin vs Ichigo hasn't yet happened, and once it does you might remind yourself ""but every shiningami can make their weapons bigger"" ""so what's special about Gin?"" ""Oh, right! He does it super fast!"".   While it is not direct and by no means the main topic of the chapter or even this page, the main message being about the meaning of the blade's size, one of the symbols of Ichigos immense strength. It is still something that gives us, view, a chance to theorize.  It's just a little subtle thing that I like. Makes me thing that Kubo would be good at writing detective stories or other mysteries. So many of them don't give readers enough clues to guess anything before the last page.   Clues, right, that's the word I wanted! On this page, Kubo gives us a clue indirectly related to Gin's shikai and bankai."

bleach,36bq3f,EspadaPrimera,4,Mon May 18 02:28:02 2015 UTC,I am 100% sure it is his zanpanktou and he has such a nice cute inner world xD with all pinky stuff and flowers and Yachiru being in it the boss xD
bleach,36bq3f,TwoSidesBaked,10,Mon May 18 03:12:01 2015 UTC,"I'm fine if Kubo takes this route, but the only thing that I'm confused about is why Yachiru also has a Zanpakutou spirit."
bleach,36bq3f,i_4got,8,Mon May 18 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"It's kinda similar to Lilinette. Lili was able to use cero on her own, had her own zanpakuto. Yachiru didn't even call her zanpakuto, just called the name and they showed up"
bleach,36bq3f,Shunsui_for_CC,11,Mon May 18 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"Lilinette had a sword, but she never used a Resurrecion. The only ability she used was a Cero, which is also Stark's main attack, so we can assume that Lilinette's abilities were just an extension of Stark's. But Yachiru displays a set of skills and abilities that is totally different than what we've seen from Kenpachi."
bleach,36bq3f,i_4got,3,Mon May 18 06:20:05 2015 UTC,The interesting thing is she did use a unique skillset but she didn't use her zanpakuto to do it. It was more akin to the Asuachi at the royal palace using the abilities without needing a zan.
bleach,36bq3f,krkonos,3,Mon May 18 18:32:45 2015 UTC,Could be alluding to kenpachi's bankai maybe?
bleach,36bq3f,rogrogrickroll,1 point,Mon May 18 19:45:33 2015 UTC,Came to here to say that ... yeah it is probbably same as Lilinette we might also say that Yachiru is Kenpachi's extension!

bleach,36bq3f,mlc885,2,Tue May 19 19:27:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of it. The recent timeline goes against it. She does her own fighting while Kenny is talking to the sword, and is present when he returns. It just doesn't make full sense."

bleach,36bq3f,HiHoJufro,3,Mon May 18 21:14:17 2015 UTC,This. Really hoping it holds true though to be honest. It would be interesting to see how Kenpachi reacts to learning the truth.
bleach,36bq3f,Alluka-,9,Mon May 18 03:24:07 2015 UTC,We do not know.
bleach,36bq3f,reigun91,6,Mon May 18 02:32:58 2015 UTC,"Yachiru being Kenpachi's zanpakuto is a popular theory but she might just be incapacitated right now.  edit: But one little snag in that theory. If Yachiru is indeed Kenpachi's zanpakuto, then why in earlier chapters while he's training with Unohana is she out and about doing her own things and Kenpachi is able to finally hear the voice of his zanpakuto? And even still, she was out and about getting her butt kicked by Gremmy and Kenpachi had to save her. If she was Kenpachi's zanpakuto, then why would she have her own zanpakuto? Theory behind that is because they believe a zanpakuto can have a zanpakuto themselves, even though they are zanpakuto's, which honestly doesn't make sense."
bleach,36bq3f,DahjerCanaan,3,Mon May 18 16:26:41 2015 UTC,My theory is that she is an asuachi but not Nazaroshi. Nazaroshi is the zan that he's been carrying around since he scavenged it from the dead shinigami. Yachiru is Unohana's zan from her time as kenpachi. When she fought Zaraki she realized she was no longer the true kenpachi and her sword either deserted her or she willingly cast it off as it was the sword of rhe kenpachi. She then got a new sword from the royal guard and her new zan was imprinted with her new personality which was as a healer and someone who was meant to nurture the new kenpachi hence the healing manta and an illusory bankai meant exclusively for Zaraki.  Zaraki wasn't able to fully take over the sword until his training with unohana when he finally took over the role. Yachiru followed him because she knew he was the kenpachi but he couldn't truly communicate with her on that level. When he finally released Nazaroshi with her there it engulfed her into his sword. We'll eventually get a scene of Zaraki going to his inner world and he'll find both Nazaroshi and Yachiru there.
bleach,36bq3f,krkonos,3,Mon May 18 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"I can't accept that, because if she was originally Unohana's zanpakuto/asauchi then she would have disappeared when Unohana died."
bleach,36bq3f,DahjerCanaan,5,Mon May 18 19:15:16 2015 UTC,Why? Zaraki has Nazaroshi who's original shinigami is dead and wasn't Tosen also using his dead friends zan?
bleach,36bq3f,krkonos,1 point,Mon May 18 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Those are valid points but it doesn't make sense for a zanpakuto to still exist without it's master. During the zanpakuto rebellion arc, even though it's a filler arc, the idea was still one of Kubo's design. Many of the left-over zanpakuto's of former soul-reapers that died lived and lingered for a short while before they themselves disappeared.  So the theory is still missing a few pieces. I'm holding on to a logical reasoning to say that Yachiru is just incapacitated right now or Gremmy managed to turn her in to a cookie and she ate herself. (that last part is a joke)  It's not that I'm against the theory of Yachiru being a zanpakuto or an asauchi, I've always been one to make wild theories just like that but it's just not plausible for me without evidence supporting it. There wasn't even any flashbacks shown of Yachiru's ""final moments"" like many characters that were killed off before her, at least not yet, so I can't say that she's gone just yet. We still don't know whether or not Izuru is dead or alive even with that supposed graphic panel where it looked like he was torn in half.  So, I suppose I'm saying that I'm unwilling to beleive anything unless or until Kubo reveals it at this point because apparently this is the last arc that he's doing of Bleach."
bleach,36bq3f,DahjerCanaan,1 point,Mon May 18 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"It could be that she hasn't been an owner less zan, she is the zan of the Kenpachi so as soon as Unohana realized that Zaraki was stronger, she became the new kenpachi Zaraki's sword.   Even if she does turn up alive and she isn't an asuachi/zanpakuto, there will be some mystery that needs to be explained about her. It was commented at the time that it was completely unique for a zanpakuto not to change form when released. The only things we've seen to use abilities like that without the sword itself were the Asuachi in the palace."
bleach,36bq3f,krkonos,1 point,Mon May 18 19:37:45 2015 UTC,The explanation about that would be an example of Sajin's zanpakuto having the same type of zanpakuto release form.
bleach,36bq3f,DahjerCanaan,1 point,Mon May 18 19:42:19 2015 UTC,I like this idea!
bleach,36bq3f,FatherPrax,7,Mon May 18 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure. Here are a couple possibilities!  Could have been:   killed by Gremmy (or other Sternritter) / collateral damage she is Kenpachi's Zakpaktou or part of Kenpachi himself she changed forms (either like Yoruichi, or Nel) she got turned into a hollow she just turned invisible (maybe not just her ""friends"" have that ability)   The zakpaktou thing would be interesting, but personally I think it something along the lines of her deciding to stop mentally shackling herself too. Who knows though."
bleach,36bq3f,DoeNaught,1 point,Mon May 18 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"I always thought that she chooses to remain as a little girl as a way to not only handicap herself (like many members of the 11th division), but also for sentimental reasons (likes playing the little girl card).  Though, I don't know if they'll play that card again due to Nel."
bleach,36bq3f,luciferella,3,Mon May 18 20:04:33 2015 UTC,I really hope she's not Kenpachi's Zanpakutou. I loved Yachiru's interactions with Kenpachi. But that's probably gonna be it. =/
bleach,36bq3f,KENSEIISHOTAF,1 point,Mon May 18 14:58:12 2015 UTC,When he yelled before slashing the meteor he said Drink which I thought could of meant he took the power of yachiru which made the blade look like her shikai.  I think next time he uses his power and sees that it looks different he will realize that he killed her.

bleach,36bq8d,reigun91,1 point,Mon May 18 02:30:35 2015 UTC,"could it be that he only wanted aizen dead, so then he asked for their help ? .... but who normal would put so much ""stuff"", ""weight"" on one boys back ? and put him a huge quest to beat aizen xD or get him exposed ? that is kinda insane ... I think that there is more behind him ... and we will be soon to find out in manga I hope so"
bleach,36bq8d,reigun91,3,Mon May 18 03:08:29 2015 UTC,"He didn't tell this to Ichigo when he went to the Soul Society. The only thing that he told him was that he needs to save Rukia from being executed. Ichigo had no idea what it was that Urahara was really planning, or what his true intentions are."
bleach,36bq8d,yukeake,5,Mon May 18 03:51:43 2015 UTC,"Further, Ichigo was rather naive at that point (and in general still is, though slightly less so), and didn't really suspect any ulterior motive from Urahara.  He needed to save Rukia - Urahara was helping him make that happen.  For the straightforward shounen hero, that's good enough.  For his part, Urahara seems to have been playing at least two gambits at once.  First, were Rukia to be saved, eventually the hogyoku would become inert, as the ""special"" gigai sapped her powers, eventually turning her human.  Second, as you brought up, he knew Aizen was after the hogyoku, and used this as an opportunity to expose him.  Urahara's always been about the greater good, at any cost.  He's not above using anyone in order to bring about what he feels is the ""right"" outcome.  He's in general a ""good"" person, particularly when it comes to saving the innocent (see Masaki, the Vizard, even his protection of Karakura town itself) - but he doesn't mind sacrificing a few lives if it means saving a great many.  And this is where I think eventually he's going to clash with Ichigo, who wants to protect everyone."

The guy should not really care much for friends and such. His life is about saving as many as possible regardless the measures. If he helps people along, that's cool."
bleach,3699p1,ChaosKeeshond,53,Sun May 17 12:35:02 2015 UTC,Being near Ichigo in the beginning of the series they should at least have powers like Orihime and Chad.  Being the children of a Noble family Captain and a Quincy who was attacked by a hollow would give them a better chance at having power than lets say Tatsuki.

bleach,3699p1,RogueHippie,1 point,Mon May 18 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"The real problem, I think, is that the powers it'd make sense to give her (and to an extent, the other human nakama) would essentially make them ""lite"" versions of other characters.  As an example, given her martial arts background, it makes perfect sense that she'd become a powerhouse brawler-type.  But we already have two of those - Chad (big tanky brawler), and Yoruichi (fast dodgy brawler).  What would another bring to the table?  Especially one whose powers are less-developed?  Chad's under-utilized as it is, and the same could be argued of Yoruichi, though she's at least been getting some action lately as support.  Chad's been there, but the most significant thing he's done in the past hundred chapters has been as Orihime's wingman."

Therefore when Ichigo was born, the link was still intact, only breaking when Ichigo gained his hollow powers."
bleach,3699p1,WhereIsMyMime,5,Sun May 17 18:08:35 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. Isshin didnt start fighting again until after Ichigo almost got killed trying to save Rukia. Pretty sure he wouldve been there for that if he could, then he wouldve talked to thr captains about how Aizen is the one who took his powers away by making him bond to a girl he saved from his hollow attack, and all that shit.  That would be a cool alternate story, for Isshin to come in right as Byakuya or Kenpachi would actually be about to kill Ichigo, or before one of the bad captains kills Ichigo on the execution hill. And then we get to see him fight more. Wouldve been awesome to see them rekt espada together."

bleach,3699p1,yukeake,1 point,Mon May 18 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"Therefore when Ichigo was born, the link was still intact, only breaking when Ichigo gained his hollow powers.   I think that's slightly backwards - Ichigo's Hollow powers surface because the link to Isshin broke.  Prior to that, the link was holding the Hollow influence in check, at the expense of Isshin's Shinigami abilities.  The moment of change appears to have been when Ichigo gained Bankai.  Very shortly afterward Isshin's powers come back.  Most likely, the power up Zangetsu received from Bankai caused the thread to break.  This affects the balance of Ichigo's powers.  Prior to Bankai, OMZ (his latent Quincy power) is actively suppressing the Shinigami side of Zangetsu.  Likewise, Zangetsu's Hollow side is being held in check by Isshin.  When the thread breaks, the Hollow influence is no longer restrained.  Only after that does Hichigo/Zangetsu start encroaching, which is the impetus for the Vizards to seek out Ichigo, and Ichigo to accept their training - in order to control Hichigo/Zangetsu's now-unbound Hollow influence."
bleach,3699p1,Iramohs,3,Mon May 18 12:38:23 2015 UTC,Nah. When Ichigo first became a shinigami the hollow powers were still being restrained. It passed from Masaki to Ichigo when he was born. After the Byakuya fight the hollow's powers were too strong to restrain anymore so he got them back.
bleach,3699p1,Rocksbury,0,Sun May 17 20:27:53 2015 UTC,Only the White hollow was absorbed by Ichigo. Nothing was mentioned about Grand Fisher.

bleach,3699p1,N4RUT0,2,Mon May 18 00:17:38 2015 UTC,Didn't that link transfer to Isshin  and Ichigo instead? That's why Isshin still couldn''t use his powers even after Misaki died

bleach,368pry,Sirocco_,1 point,Mon May 18 14:45:20 2015 UTC,"Purpose - Her purpose will definitely be to reinforce plot points and backstory about the Four/Five the Noble Families. Kubo's biding his time on revealing anything about them, and it may take years before he shows his fans mercy. T.T  Zanpakuto - I'm following the theory that proposes she does not use one. I suppose this will allow her to use her Shunkou technique to its maximum potential, and not have a a part of her soul be used in a separate physical manifestation, other than pure Kidou. If she did have one, then like most people guess, it's probably the thing that her younger brother brought for her, when he first debuted.  Soul King - I think you need to be extremely powerful to be the Soul King, so unless you are literally a part of the Soul King himself like Mimihagi-sama, or extremely powerful like Aizen Sousuke or Juha Bach...  However, it does seem to be a logical process that if a King dies, the ones next in line of royalty/nobility are suitable candidates to become the new King. It's not a stretch that Kubo may be setting up conflict between the Noble Families as to who is worthy to replace the Soul King, so yes, I think she could be a possible candidate.

bleach,367ox5,reigun91,5,Sun May 17 09:31:11 2015 UTC,They spent chapter after chapter on zombies but offscreen the zero squad. I wouldn't mind the zombies stuff if he focused more on the other captains and fights as well.
bleach,367ox5,kingofdabz,1 point,Sun May 17 09:44:48 2015 UTC,"I think it just means that the true powers/fights of the Zero squad/assorted captains is going to come later down the road. I mean, I'd rather see the Zero Squad's true fighting potential closer to the climax, when all hell is just breaking loose. Kubo had to do the Zombie stuff at some point. Better when it happened rather than when the plot would REALLY be picking up."

bleach,367ox5,aversion25,2,Sun May 17 06:19:24 2015 UTC,"i like it. i feel as though kubo knows we most likely won't see it animated, so he just decides to create weird shit for the hell of it. still would like to see it animated someday. i agree with your criticism's with the gremmy fight. it was just very disappointing."
bleach,367ox5,kingofdabz,2,Sun May 17 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which is a total shame because some of the stuff he's written in this arc has been amazing. Komamura's (?) new Bankai was the tits, seeing how Bambietta emerged from Vollstandig was awesome, the Quincy all activating Vollstandig and rushing at the shinigami would be cool, and As Nodt in ANYTHING would be awesome to see animated."
bleach,367ox5,aversion25,2,Sun May 17 12:33:06 2015 UTC,"Excellent chapters, The Zombies killed Toshiro! If the anime was still running that would of never happened. I think even if temporary that was a gift from Kubo for all that merchandise hype toshiro had."
bleach,367ox5,kingofdabz,2,Sun May 17 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"It was certainly a breath of fresh air to see a captain had fallen to the point of being taken over by the enemy. Even though I know Mayuri took control of the zombies afterwards, I think it shows how much stronger Giselle is than PePe and how both of them were stronger than the Espada who could control people. She took control of three captains and a lieutenant, PePe only got one, and Zommari got Rukia and two of Byakuya's limbs."
bleach,367ox5,aversion25,4,Sun May 17 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"This  whole war has been pretty fun, so much stuff has happened and it's all been quite awesome. I don't get the hate at all and don't think any particular fight was a waste of time at all. What is a was of time anyway in the sense of the bleach story? Every scene in the Manga holds a purpose for either character development or cool fights or whatever, I don't get what time is being wasted here. Everything from the surprise Arrancars to the toshiro mindfuck madness, to Rukia bankai, kenpachi shikai, yachiru shikai and disappearance, every damn thing I could mention has been pretty awesome to witness, and bleach isn't even my favorite Manga at all."
bleach,367ox5,kingofdabz,2,Sun May 17 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"If you like it, that is fine. It made Mayuri look like a complete badass, but was a waste of time."
bleach,367ox5,reigun91,5,Sun May 17 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, a waste of time it may be, but are there any fights in this entire manga that aren't a waste of time? Fighting is a way to flesh out the personalities of the characters. If they don't fight and develop through dialogue, people complain. If they develop through fights, people complain. I'm not saying you're complaining, just voicing my opinion on the matter."
bleach,367ox5,kingofdabz,4,Sat May 16 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"What the hell does waste of time mean in terms of bleach? Waste of time for who? Are you in a rush? The Manga is still going and yhwach isn't even close to being defeated, there's still time for whatever you're in a rush for"
bleach,367ox5,reigun91,4,Sun May 17 01:33:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's more so wasted potential. They hyped up things that never came to be: Renji vs NaNaNa, and Bazz B, Pepe's powers, Old Quincy who shot out Shunsui's eyes, Hisagis bankai. Then we also had no resolution to whether Hits/Mats/Rose/Kensei are actually dead, temp zombies, etc."
bleach,367ox5,assertiveguy,1 point,Sun May 17 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that sounds like talk people should save until the Manga is over, you're all talking about those events as if there is still no time for bazz b, lilotto, and others who are still alive to show their stuff. And the other captains already confirmed which captains are missing: toshiro and rangiku, the rest are still there accounted for by either mayuri or byakuya. There is still PLENTY of time for the other zombie captains to show up as well. I would understand wasted potential talk if it was good characters (pepe and nanana were lame) and if it was the very end of the Manga, which it is not lmao"
bleach,367ox5,Fred_MK,1 point,Sun May 17 04:48:29 2015 UTC,"Yea of course, but that doesnt change the fact that there are too many characters (leading to ""where is Shinji"" or where is so and so). If Kubo would have truly committed to killing Byak/Izuru and a few others it really would have set the tone for the arc. Instead we are left with the same bloated cast and not enough screen time for all.   And at the moment I can't truly see an ending where the VCs/weaker captains get a time to shine - who will they fight? Squad 0 are probably the only possibly enemies left (quincy Squad 0 + ywhach will fight Ichigo + all the big names). We still have to see how Isshin/Ryukken come back into play as well.   So im hoping there is something solid coming up, but I really cannot fathom why the war/destruction of SS wasn't taken as an opportunity to kill off a few more characters in meaningful and committed ways"
bleach,367ox5,Fred_MK,2,Sun May 17 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"The answer could be as simple as there is much more story to go. Yhwach is currently about to reshape all of the realms of existence into whatever he wants. Who knows what kind of shit that's gonna create. Kubo has a golden opportunity here to make something solid happen. And his process of changing reality won't be interrupted as there is a whole group of weirdos ready to defend him. We still don't know what happened to yachiru, we still don't know the resolution to toshiro and rangiku, we still don't know ishins and uryuus dad's involvement like you said, and I don't  think kubo is going to leave these things hanging in the air when the Manga end, especially when they've been referenced as though the story would come back to them later, meaning there is way more story to go."
bleach,367ox5,Fred_MK,1 point,Sun May 17 18:43:42 2015 UTC,That's a good point - I hadnt considered Yhwach could create additional beings or even resurrect souls as the SK. Figured he would only be allowed to reshape the realms.   I hope he capitalizes on this and avoids jumping into the overpowered fights right off the bat (Ichigo or Aizen vs Ywhach)
bleach,367ox5,assertiveguy,1 point,Sun May 17 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he seemed to say he even had too much power. We know the soul king before this was almost like a lifeless husk in a seal in the royal realm, he didn't have mimihagi infused into him and he didn't even talk supposedly. Now yhwach has mimihagi and the SK inside of him and he is a very mobile person even without the fusion. So he could probably not only redirect souls like the SK'S job but perhaps create more things. Maybe this won't create a bunch of new monsters or enemies but I can see it at least reviving Zero squad"
bleach,367ox5,jns701,1 point,Sun May 17 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"yea definitely! I'd also think it'd be pretty cool if he could take over the zombification of the ""dead"" captains, or maybe even revive Ukitake to fight on his side. Basically any scenario where the whole cast is split in half and fighting each other, as opposed to the majority just being off screen in the corner for plot purposes"
bleach,367ox5,smallchristmaslights,1 point,Sun May 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"That would be fun to see for sure, I'd be happy even with zero squad vs gotei 13, when they came down from the royal realm for the first time they were all taunting the gotei n shit, it would be so cool to see those taunts fleshed out into fights :)"
bleach,367ox5,richiegraine,-7,Sun May 17 21:54:30 2015 UTC,"Waste of time means this: I could have avoided reading those 4 chapters and would have missed nothing. I didn't because I enjoy reading it weekly, and its part of a routine at this point. Also, I shouldn't have to explain why I found it to be a waste of time, I am allowed to have opinions."
bleach,367ox5,gummychaos,3,Sun May 17 22:05:08 2015 UTC,"Of course you can have an opinion, but others still have a right to say that opinion is dumb.  And you have NO idea if you would have really missed nothing by not reading those chapters. Kubo leaves little hints about everything here and here, you may have missed an important speech bubble that would be relevant later on, so many things are like that in bleach. When aizen talked about the soul king after being defeated by icihigo, that entire conversation didn't become relevant until right now! Even if it's not hints or clues it's character development, nothing in the Manga is a waste of time, only Anime Filler is a literal waste of time. Talking about ""wasting time"" is jumping to conclusions and assuming the Manga is about to be over in the next chapter or something"
bleach,367ox5,DrBoltz,0,Sun May 17 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"I read the chapters, thought they were a waste. nothing you say will make me change my mind."
bleach,367ox5,ChaosKeeshond,2,Sun May 17 15:43:07 2015 UTC,It WAS a waste of time. Just like the Zaraki fight you mentioned. Two wrongs don't make a right.
bleach,367ox5,Freddichio,11,Sun May 17 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"But what about it was a waste? We saw the fates of several characters (zombie gotei, zombie arrancar) which set up for a lot of other possible things to happen. I would argue that Mayuri's ""fight"" with Giselle was one of the least ""wastes of time"" because it set the stage for other things to happen. Zaraki's fight on the other hand was simply to show off his new Shikai."
bleach,367ox5,Sunjammer0037,11,Sun May 17 00:49:26 2015 UTC,"Neither were waste of time in my opinion. We had extra to know the Sternritters. Gremmy's arc included two captains death, Yachiru's Shikai and Kenpachi's tittle being proven. Gremmy was really OP and somehow cool, just his end that was pathetic. Imagine the BS if Zaraki OHKO Gremmy and Mayuri OHKO Gigi.  Ok, i understand Giselle survived but who the hell cares? (S)he is a zombie god damnit"
bleach,367ox5,BeatTheDeadMal,5,Sun May 17 01:36:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. Plus, Kubo had to use up the letters of the alphabet. Thinking about all of the fodder sternritter just reinforces how much I like the remaining members."

bleach,366rd1,Direktorman,44,Sat May 16 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"The Spanish is quite sound, but there are a few gender/word order inconsistencies.   These are my pet peeves:  Hueco Mundo should be Mundo Hueco (Hollow world, although this word order can be explained as a poetic licence...)  Arrancar, meaning to tear something off, is a verb, not a noun. In English it's way too easy to interchange nouns and verbs as they are usually the same word (to walk - verb, a walk - noun), but in Spanish there are a lot of differences. The associated noun to arrancar should be arrancador (one who rips something off).  Brazo Derecha de Gigante. Urgh. Brazo (arm) is a masculine noun, but it's followed by a femenine adjective. Also, the preposition de should be followed by the article el before a masculine noun, and in this case it's shortened to del. The correct form should be Brazo Derecho del Gigante.  Rant over. Overall, I give the Spanish a 9.5/10.  Source: Spanish speaker, from Argentina."
bleach,366rd1,curambar,14,Sat May 16 20:43:27 2015 UTC,"Lets not forget Cero Oscuras. If ""Dark Cero"" is what he meant then he got both the gender and number wrong and should be Cero Oscuro."
bleach,366rd1,Esfer25,7,Sat May 16 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"""De"" would be ok. I mean, he is not talking about some specific giant (del) but talking about it like a generic one (de). Like ""tiene un brazo de hielo""(generic ice and not a specific one). I'm from Spain."

bleach,366rd1,LionFists,3,Sat May 16 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"The spanish is good for the most part, there are a few weird ones like Fornicarás ( you will fornicate) and Grillar grillo ( to grill cricket). And then the misspells like brazo derecha.   Other than that its pretty good!"
bleach,366rd1,Andygoesrawr,2,Sun May 17 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"Don't Grillar and Grillo share the same origin? Essentially it means ""cricket making the noise of a cricket"" (Grillo que Grilla?). And grillos/grilletes means shackles, so the kanji for Grillar Grillo is ""insane shackled cricket"" as a reference to that."
bleach,366rd1,LionFists,2,Sun May 17 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"I've never heard the word grillar used outside of cooking. Using an animals name to describe the sound it makes is not the norm in spanish ( El perro ladra, la oveja bala, etc.) but then again I live in Argentina so I'm probably not the right person to ask about gramatics.  ( My country is notorious for not giving a crap about speaking proper spanish lol)"
bleach,366rd1,KENSEIISHOTAF,1 point,Sun May 17 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know if ""Grillar"" is the right word to call the noise of a cricket. But even if it is, it would still be wrong. It would be the same as ""Ladrar Perro"" (to bark dog) or ""Maullar Gato"" (to mew cat). Grillo que Grilla or Grillo Grillando would make more sense grammatically."
bleach,366rd1,Edghyatt,2,Mon May 18 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"""Menos Grande"" is laughable. It literally means ""less big"", makes no sense grammatically and only sounds silly.  It should be Gran Menos (""Great Minus"", in a way)."

bleach,366rd1,SLXShujo,1 point,Sun May 17 03:42:51 2015 UTC,"Im Mexican. I understan that the style of spanish used in bleach is Spanish (from Spain), but the languaje is originaly suppoused to be the same. As the comments say, there are a lot of weird use of the female and male use of the words (like in smapish table is a female sustantive, and desk is male: so la is for female and el is for male sustantives: la mesa, el escritorio; the table, the desk) and its just odd and awkward to say it, but at the same time it feels just kind of artistic, and in many times it was really well used, like ""Arrogante"", the sword from Barragan. So, its not good at all, as if he speaked it, but for the simbolism in bleach, its just adecuate."
bleach,366rd1,kingofdabz,1 point,Sun May 17 08:52:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say kubo takes creative liberties with the Spanish and German language. I'm sure he did this intentionally and doesn't want to copy real Spanish and German language outright, but add his own kubo twist to it. The way he writes them makes them better to say as attack names or character names and whatnot, and it's kubo's own fantasy world, it doesn't have to follow real life language rules"
bleach,366rd1,Tumor159,0,Sun May 17 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"Of course there is a Kampfstil in German, but it's something like all Kampftechniken as a whole.  Letzter Stil isn't really wrong either. They don't have much time after using it and changing their (Kampf-)Stil is the result of that. Instead of using numerous weak arrows they depend on one strong attack.  In my opinion he is kind of using the right vocabulary, but uses wrong grammar and spelling."
bleach,366rd1,tazzerer,-2,Sun May 17 00:08:58 2015 UTC,German language is actually pretty easy but it sucks donkey's dick.
bleach,366rd1,assertiveguy,-1,Sun May 17 08:13:34 2015 UTC,"I've never studied German (always wanted, never had the time), so it never bothered me in bleach. I'm a portuguese speaker, so, even though it's not the same language, the grammar is really close to it, and my comprehension of spanish is quite good. Like people already said, there are some problems most gringos have while trying to learn spanish/portuguese, like forgetting to change the word according to its gender/number, specially articles that follow prepositions (like curambar said, Brazo Derecho del Gigante would be the right form of Sado's power... a very remarkable mistake, specially for a Mexican character).  Seeing how this happens a lot in anime, I'm tempted to say is a problem with the japanese. But I see the same mistakes being made by Americans, Germans, etc., so I guess it's just the problem of having to learn a really different language. Those mistakes don't happen with speakers of languages that come from latin (like french, italian, romanian), since their structures look alike. That's why I wouldn't say spanish grammar 'is not so hard'. When we talk about different languages, the difficulties always depend heavily on the familiarity between the language you are trying to learn and the ones you already speak. Spanish looks quite easy to me. Not so easy for a russian guy...  Anyway, I'd prefer Kubo to only use japanese. Seems like quite a beautiful language, and he knows how to make good use of it to give names to zanpakutous, bankais, etc. He should use what he knows better imo."

Honestly, at the level that the Elite Squad were when they first faced the Zero Division, they would definitely not have been able to take down Kenpachi.

bleach,365bhr,TodenEngel,3,Wed May 20 03:34:25 2015 UTC,I should've made it clearer in my post that this was a hypothetical situation in which Gremmy and Kenpachi never fought.
bleach,365bhr,rogrogrickroll,2,Sat May 16 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"That begs the question if gremmy was that important, would ywach have sent gremmy to fight kenpachi."
bleach,365bhr,SHINee21,0,Sat May 16 16:01:56 2015 UTC,Kenpachi is a special war potential. Obviously he's important.
bleach,365bhr,mick4state,0,Tue May 19 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"Think of how different the whole story would be if Yhwach didn't send Gremmy to fight Kenny. Zaracki would have probably gone on a tear, killing several Sternritter, but never learned his sword's name.  At the same time, Gremmy would have been in Yhwach's company when the Zero Squad fought them. Which would have been very inconvenient for the Zero Squad. edit He would have fought Ichigo & Co as well."
bleach,365bhr,subaudible2012,8,Sat May 16 11:47:15 2015 UTC,"Kenpachi already knew his zanpakto's name before fighting Gremmy, he learned it after killing Unohana."

Then at one point he did, losing to kenpachi. I'm assured that entering the soul kings palace and facing the royal guard would be even more stressful on the boy."
bleach,365bhr,seratheanos,13,Sat May 16 08:54:00 2015 UTC,Maybe because Gremmy was an idiot who could jeopardise the whole mission if he fought before Yhwach's Almighty was activated.  Also he was dead

The problem is he doesn't know restraint- he could end up hurting the other elites.   He wouldn't have fought well with anybody, so maybe he would have replaced W as the random guy who fights by himself.

The ability to manipulate and create absolutely anything, limited only by your mind.  Except, the human mind is very limited. I could imagine a person coming into existence, but I might not have imagined an adequate count of mitochondria, making the poor git eternally lethargic. And remember, Gremmy had to maintain the thought. Yachiru's bones stopped being cookies when Gremmy was distracted by Kenpachi.

All he did was having a short clash with the FemRitters where he did not seem to have any problems at all, then the other four Sternritter appeared and he still did not seem concerned. He got hit twice if I cound correctly, then Renji and the rest appeared and he ran after Yhwach and Uryu.  Then we see not really anthing of him again until he reaches Yhwach and the soulking, where he clashes with the former, but again we don't really get to see alot. Yhwach blocks Ichigos attacks, Ichigo fires a black Getsuga Tenshou, Uryu interferes, Ichigo & Co fall down.   So basically we have seen nothing, or at least not something I would call a real fight which helps us to learn about Ichigos powerlevel. We will need to wait a bit longer it seems."
bleach,3670jf,Boringx3,1 point,Sat May 16 22:41:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We'll only see his real power when he commits to a fight (single or multiple opponents - remember what happened to the lieutenants when he resqued Rukia In SS arc?), especially when he goes full Bankai/Ressurrecion/Whatever. Only then will we see how his power has grown."
bleach,3670jf,seventhsoul,13,Sun May 17 11:41:26 2015 UTC,"In Ichigo's first training session with Urahara, Urahara had said that a spiritual being's power is raised most easily and by the greatest amount when the spirit is placed in danger. That makes training where the trainee is actually being targeted by attacks that could maim or kill them the most beneficial method of training.  What did Ichigo do with Tensa Yhwach for 3 months? Battle training. Moments like this are what increases a spiritual beings powers. Imagine how many times Ichigo did that over the course of a fight that lasted 2160 hours. That's why his cumulative power boost was so ridiculous.  In the current arc, he started out around Captain level, just because that was the amount of spiritual energy given to him by all of the Captains. The Royal Guard training boosts someone to about double a normal Captain's level of power. Then, on top of that he gained his new Zanpakuto. So, he should be around Yamamoto and Shinigami Aizen's level of power.  Yhwach's level of power isn't clear right now, but it was never clear. Before even activating The Almighty, Yhwach was strong enough to make Ichibei'i use Bankai. After activating The Almighty, Yhwach killed Ichibi just by pointing at him."
bleach,3670jf,Temperatia,8,Sat May 16 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"You've hit the nail on the head.  Spiritual pressure is better thought of as a battle momentum -- it's the amount of energy being pumped.  To apply a real world example, imagine a trip to the gym. If you were to just sit down and leg press double your body weight, most of you would fail. However, if you were to warm up by pressing half your body weight, then gradually increased it until you were doing double, then while it would bloody hurt there's a good chance you could do it.  What's increased? Your strength? Or the amount of strength you're exhibiting?  Ichigo didn't just train in the dangai, but also had the warm-up session of the century.  After all, remember that the Hogyoku wasn't some sort of magical power-up device. It could only unlock the potential that was already there, but Aizen never became more powerful than he was innately capable of being. Ichigo's potential has always been out of this world, and his dangai training allowed him to unlock enough of his latent strength to fight Aizen.  And guys, we must really do our best to remember that this is NOT Dragon Ball Z.  Characters get power-ups, yes, but they're balanced in comparison to other franchises. For instance, at the height of their power both Ichigo and Aizen were able to destroy mountains.  That's pretty cool.  Post hogyoku and FGT, they could destroy mountains. Who else do we know with that sort of strength? Kenpachi can easily one-hit meteors of a comparable size and Yamamoto's Shikai was easily capable of levelling entire cities or more.   In other words, while Ichigo and Aizen became significantly stronger than the majority of Shinigami, their power was still within the realms of plausibility.  In order to evolve any further, Aizen had to undergo an extreme hollowfication which pushed him into a class beyond Vastro Lorde, and Ichigo use his burnout move, FGT, a steroid-like technique which boosted him to strengths so unnatural it would go on to have huge ramifications. Neither of these proved to be sustainable, and for one reason or another their bodies gave up.  What this all ultimately means is that power disparities in Bleach are never as great as they might appear. For example, the sweeping victories the Quincies originally enjoyed in this arc were due to their employed tactics, namely bankai theft, and the ensuing confusion that brought about. It wasn't due to the Quincies possessing 10x the spiritual pressure."
bleach,3670jf,ChaosKeeshond,5,Sun May 17 11:29:26 2015 UTC,"What about Bleach, Vegeta? It's like us, with swords!"
bleach,3670jf,CrimsonRex,2,Mon May 18 00:22:55 2015 UTC,The Royal Guard training boosts someone to about double a normal Captain's level of power.   But then that would mean that Ichigo was stronger before the dangai training than he is after the RG training.
bleach,3670jf,Yusumay,4,Sun May 17 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"I would say the difference now is that before Dangai training, his power was either 99% OMZ / 1% Hichigo, or when beaten badly, OMZ couldn't repress Hichigo anymore and it became 1% OMZ / 99% Hichigo. After Dangai he merged them both into one spirit, then became that spirit manifest when using Mugetsu and the whole ""The Sword Is Me"" chapters.   He lost his powers, but began to awaken OMZ and Hichigo through fullbringer training (we know he rewoke both because of the hollow influence on his clothing), then at the end of the FB arc he received the reiatsu from all the captains again and got his powers back in full.  If you wanna simplify it think of it like this:   (OMZ control) Soul Society Arc: 1+0 (hollow control) Vizard/Ulquiorra fight: 0+1 (Merged control) Dangai Training: 2 (Fullbringer Only) Pre Ginjo Fight: 0.1+0+1 fullbringer is odd because the power comes from his badge, not a spirit (post Ginjo) reiatsu from Captains: 1+0+1 (Each spirit gets full control its own sword, fullbringer power gives him armor)   Royal Guard Training:* 1+1+1"
bleach,3670jf,boredguy12,2,Sun May 17 06:58:43 2015 UTC,"He obviously wasn't.   He never reached full power before the Dangai training. He had a large amount of spirit energy, but wasn't able to use his full power until he went into his inner world and fought with Yhwach and White.  He isn't having the same problem in the current arc."
bleach,3670jf,Temperatia,1 point,Sun May 17 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"Unohana said that Ichigo was at captain level before they went to the fight, and Ichigo said that his Reiatsu level was relevent to how much of his shihakusho was left, however he only had a sleeve left. If you look at that mathematically, that would make him around 4-5 times captain level (However, its kubo, so thats not going to be the case, regardless, he would be double a normal captains power at the LEAST during that fight).   On top of that however, theres also the fact that he had his powerboost from his hollow mask, which would probably double his power, making him four times the normal captain level."
bleach,3670jf,Yusumay,1 point,Thu May 21 09:32:49 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between reiatsu and reiryoku.  That's how Zaraki was able to defeat Unohana as a child, but had his Zanpakuto broken by Ichigo in the SS arc and couldn't cut through Nnoitora's Hierro in the Arrancar arc.  A person may not be exerting all of the reiatsu their body possibly can at any given point. So, just because Ichigo's reiryoku was replenished by Unohana, that doesn't mean his reiatsu became any stronger."
bleach,3670jf,Temperatia,4,Thu May 21 12:47:51 2015 UTC,"I think the explanation is more simple. When Ichigo was bitch-slapping Butterfly Aizen, he was in Bankai.  Bankai is said to boost power 10fold. Do you think ten-times-stronger double sword Ichigo would be at the same kind of level as he was post-Dangai?"

Remember how Ichigo looked after his Dangai training and right before he lost his shinigami's powers? He reverted back to his usual self."
bleach,3670jf,Fred_MK,3,Sat May 16 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"Oh my, oh my. I think you might be mistaken. Ichigo is not fighting right now. He's trying to stop and understand the quincy. He's being patient. It is hard to say how strong he is and he probably can't stand against soul-king yhwach, but he could beat up Aizen. He should be around the power level of mugetsu at the moment.   He won't need any sort of power ups. All he will need to do is go bankai. Surely he should be stronger than all other Shiningami. Multiple times."
bleach,3670jf,Zil_v_a,2,Mon May 18 13:11:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe he needs to gain all his power again? He lost all his power (and Reiatsu?) and I think it would take some time to restore all again.  On the other Hand we didn't see him in full-action after getting his real Zanpakuto, so maybe he's a lot stronger."
bleach,3670jf,rosality,2,Sat May 16 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"From Chapter 542-Page 12, it's noted that for the first time (at least for the 3 companion girls of Oetsu, they have never seen the Sea dry up) This could be a good indicator of Ichigo's power. However the only draw back is he also awakened his sword right then and there instead of at a later time I'm sure like most other Shinigami. So we don't really know if Yamamoto/Aizens awakening could also dry the Sea, but for even Oetsu to be shocked...perhaps it means something."
bleach,3670jf,Kazuma54,2,Sun May 17 05:04:33 2015 UTC,he bare hand caught the snipers arrow that punches a hole through anything and everything including 2 zero squad zans.  id say hes on a whole new level.
bleach,3670jf,Knerfed,1 point,Tue May 19 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"Ichigo lost his power due to him being one with his zanpakuto---FGT. He tried to get it back in the FB arc by himself, epic fail only to have it all stolen. But Rukia said that they only stole the top of his power. Though, that is no explanation but probably the best we'll get. Now, Ichigo is strong enough where he can use a tidbit of his power to heal Ichibei...now that's powerful. You have to remember that Ichigo wasn't using his full power as explained in chapter 542."
bleach,3670jf,Seri55,1 point,Sat May 16 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"Did he even use his true powers? I thought the old man was suppressing most of it. Also, when he beat Aizen, he had the long hair of Yhwach. I don't know. I am thinking it was his Quincy power that did it. Or I am probably confused. I can't wait to see how the boy beats the beast."
bleach,3670jf,cirad,3,Sun May 17 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"Ichigo's Quincy powers themselves weren't active until after Quirge's Jail.  Even then, they're not something he can use consciously - they're essentially in the same state his Shinigami powers were just after activating his Shikai for the first time - he's able to use them instinctively, but he's not able to activate them at will.  Prior to that, his Quincy powers themselves wouldn't come into play.  OMZ as a spiritual ""actor"" is active, but the powers he represents aren't.  Instead, he essentially serves as a ""gatekeeper"" for Ichigo's other powers (until Bankai, at which point he's backgrounded as Zangetsu's Hollow side becomes more powerful).  What Ichigo achieved in the dangai was basically a unification of wills of his spiritual factions, which allowed a sort of unsustainable ""spiritual overclock""."
bleach,3670jf,yukeake,1 point,Mon May 18 13:19:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. Just the hair similarity and all confused me :) Didn't the newborn holy god say that the boy had surpassed that level already or am I remembering it wrong?
bleach,3670jf,cirad,2,Mon May 18 15:18:42 2015 UTC,"""Newborn holy god""?  Ichigo won't have surpassed his post-Dangai state yet.  Folks can still feel his reiatsu.  Both Mullet-Butterfly-Aizen and post-Dangai Ichigo had achieved a level of reiatsu where those ""beneath"" them couldn't perceive their reiatsu (and Ichigo's post-Dangai state was at such a level above even Mullet-Butterfly-Aizen - who incorrectly assumed Ichigo had abandoned reiatsu entirely)."
bleach,3670jf,yukeake,1 point,Mon May 18 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"""Newborn holy god""   Wasn't that the title of the last chapter on MP? I probably butchered it ... Yup. Makes sense. Next few chapters should be interesting :)"
bleach,3670jf,cirad,1 point,Mon May 18 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"Other people have made their point, and I totally agree Boringx3 and Temperatia, but there's something more I want to discuss Ichigo v Yhwach.    I'm quite sure his Shinigami powers won't be enough to all alone beat Yhwach, he will definitely use some Quincy techniques (probably) along with his Shinigami powers combined, and yeah not forgetting about his hollowfication combination powers aswell which is now a part of one of his zanpakuto. So he SHOULD be stronger than Genryusai Yamamoto and Sosuke Aizen combined!"

bleach,364jng,DeusExMachina810,14,Sat May 16 08:26:11 2015 UTC,"And then Zaraki got beat without even taking off his eyepatch. What was the point of all that if he was still holding himself back, to the point where he nearly died?"

bleach,364jng,KimJungWin,24,Sat May 16 03:47:07 2015 UTC,We don't even know what she is. Kubo never gave us any clear answer. Is she a Fullbringer or what? This annoys the hell out of me
bleach,364jng,DeusExMachina810,2,Sat May 16 08:22:23 2015 UTC,She might play a key role now that aizen is back in the picture
bleach,364jng,elxx714,2,Sun May 17 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"The only part of her power that doesn't gel with what we know of Fullbring is that her faeries appear to be sentient.  We know that Zanpakuto (and possibly Quincy powers - we've yet to see a Quincy soulscape other than Ichigo's, and Cang Du's intimations about Zanpakuto spirits suggests that he isn't necessarily aware of sentient internal spirits) are, but we never see anything out of the other Fullbrings to suggest sentience of any kind.  Remove that, and her powers fit Fullbring almost exactly.  I'm guessing that Kubo designed her powers before coming up with the greater concept of Fullbring, and that we're supposed to overlook this.  Then again, he could also use this difference in the future to throw us off again.  Time will tell (no lies)."
bleach,364jng,yukeake,7,Mon May 18 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, plus the character development (about saving herself, etc.) that Kubo pretty much whooshed away at the end of the Ulquiorra vs. Ichigo fight."
bleach,364jng,alcheras,2,Sat May 16 16:49:37 2015 UTC,"Orihime is one of my favorite characters, but I feel like she in particular gets shafted by bad writing pretty frequently. Her abilities are incredibly underutilized given what they were established to be; if Aizen was correct and her power was rejecting phenomena overall, then that logically shouldn't be restricted to just healing, and in that case, even the sky isn't the limit for her. She had god tier potential and then...well, we get what we have now. Like others have said, she had some promising character development, but it just got thrown out the window. It's so frustrating.  Orihime is my homegirl but it's for that very reason that I'm disappointed in her character's trajectory (or lack thereof) as far as development goes. :("

Maybe I forgot some details since the chapters for that arc were released years ago but I remember Ulquiorra telling Ichigo something like ""you have no idea what we did to her"". And I don't recall Kubo ever actually revealing what Aizen did do to her. Or was it all a bluff by Ulquiorra to get Ichigo mad? Why did Aizen even want Orihime to be kidnapped anyway? Was it just a plan to make Ichigo come to Hueco Mundo so that Aizen could go to the human world and fight the Gotei 13 without having Ichigo interfere?"

Was it just a plan to make Ichigo come to Hueco Mundo so that Aizen could go to the human world and fight the Gotei 13 without having Ichigo interfere?   Pretty much the reason. So, she was just reduced to a simple plot device both by Kubo and Aizen. I mean for someone who got branded with a God-like ability, her character was handled very poorly.

bleach,364jng,darthnick426,10,Sat May 16 05:21:14 2015 UTC,At least he isn't talking about his own pride when the entire world is in danger...
bleach,364jng,Sandisk4gb4,8,Sat May 16 08:44:56 2015 UTC,"Byakuya's pride as a shinigami is both one of his greatest strengths and weaknesses. His pride as a shinigami has driven him to become as powerful and deadly of an opponent as he is today. At the same time, it makes him arrogant and causes him to assume he is always miles ahead of his opponents. (Even though most of the time he is)  I honestly don't see much wrong with his pride as a shinigami. If anything his pride goes hand in hand with protecting the world. He has pride in his ability to dispatch the enemies of the Soul Society. He has pride in his ability to protect the Seireitei and save innocents. He has pride in his sister and her great strength that will help her defend others and defeat evil. I don't really see how anything he has pride in is a problem to anyone else. If anything, it is only harmful to himself, otherwise his pride is an asset to the Gotei 13."
bleach,364jng,darthnick426,2,Sat May 16 08:58:10 2015 UTC,I'm talking about when Shunsui released Aizen and byakuya made that statement.
bleach,364jng,Sandisk4gb4,3,Sat May 16 09:06:52 2015 UTC,"Well he wasn't just talking about himself there. He was more or less telling Shunsui the collective feelings of all the shinigami present and their opinions on Aizen's release. It certainly wasn't just Byakuya's pride Shunsui offended it was all of the Gotei 13. I took that exchange more as Byakuya saying "" Shunsui, you've just pissed everyone off by doing this man.""  It wasn't just Byakuya telling Kyoraku that he specifically was pissed. I understand their feelings on the matter since it's Aizen and freeing him even in a sealed state is controversial. That being said, they will need Aizen to win so I do think the Gotei obviously needed to swallow their pride on this. That being said, I think they've all swallowed their pride and understand the decision since that chapter."
bleach,364jng,darthnick426,2,Sat May 16 09:22:04 2015 UTC,Byakuya says that after Shunsui explains himself.

bleach,364jng,darthnick426,2,Sat May 16 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"Why should he even say that? That's like saying ""yea i understand but i'm still mad you hurt our pride""."
bleach,364jng,Sandisk4gb4,1 point,Sat May 16 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"The reason he was spouting out all those bullshit was because he was influenced by Aizen over time, and coupled with the fact he went insane over the death of his friend it explains quite well why he did the things he did.  Those last few seconds before he exploded, when he opened his eyes one last time and looked at Komamura and Hisagi, was when his true essence was shown. I think that is the same Tousen we all liked before he started contradicting himself, and it isn't fair in my opinion to judge him so harsly for being a person that he never really was in the first place."

bleach,364jng,One_Who_Walks_Silly,2,Sat May 16 06:13:08 2015 UTC,Didn't the fans complain like crazy to Kubo and that's why he brought Byakuya back?
bleach,364jng,imFreshPineapple,6,Sat May 16 06:44:53 2015 UTC,I always just thought that was a rumour someone started out of spite. I believe he was just too afraid of possible backlash to kill off a character as liked as Byakuya
bleach,364jng,One_Who_Walks_Silly,3,Sat May 16 06:52:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think he ever planned on killing off Byakuya. Byakuya is one of Kubo's favorite captains to write for along with Kenpachi and Mayuri. In order to give Byakuya and Kenpachi character development with this arc he needed them to lose horribly. They needed that shock factor to realize how much stronger they needed to become. It's the DBZ formula. Before you get stronger you get your ass kicked. Plus Kubo loves the rivalry he has going between the honorable samurai of Byakuya and the blood thirsty barbarian of Kenpachi. If he was powering one up, he was powering up the other to keep them near equals to maintain their rivalry. Neither Kenpachi or Byakuya were meant to die at the beginning of the arc. Anyone who thinks Kubo decided to allow Byakuya to live due to fan backlash or pressure from producers is kidding themselves. They just want to believe Kubo wanted to kill him off because it was better writing. While yes I do agree it would have been better writing to kill off Byakuya, I don't believe Kubo ever intended to do it."
bleach,364jng,darthnick426,1 point,Sat May 16 08:47:23 2015 UTC,"Kinda pointless to have all that buildup then, you knew bya was screwed the moment he lost his cool about losing his bankai, for him that's the biggest shock is seeing bya get taken by surprise and not being able to fight back, not having him survive a near death shredding. It was pointless as hell having him reflect on his failure, putting his trust into ichigo, his sword clearly breaking, and haschwald saying he died if he was gonna back literally 4 chaps later"
bleach,364jng,Keranu,1 point,Sun May 17 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's painfully obvious that Byakuya's conversation with Ichigo was intended, at least when it was written, as a death scene.  It brings Byakuya's character full-circle, from disrespecting Ichigo at the beginning of the series, to entrusting him with his last wishes.  That scene was damned powerful, and I think it loses quite a bit of impact without the finality it seemed to represent.  This scene is a stark difference from what happened to Zaraki.  Zaraki didn't get a ""death scene"".  He was defeated, and quite obviously severely wounded - but he didn't get a scene where he made his peace. (Of course, neither did Kira, but I doubt Kira has the fanbase Byakuya or Zaraki have)  Whether Kubo simply changed his mind, or whether it was pressure from above - we'll probably never know.  And honestly it doesn't really matter much at this point."
bleach,364jng,yukeake,59,Mon May 18 13:34:30 2015 UTC,Stark. No.1 espada!! So much hype. Okay...you shoots guns. Okay...you got  killed by a shikai. Just wow...okay :/

bleach,364jng,Nnoitrum,32,Sat May 16 13:55:02 2015 UTC,Okay...you got killed by a shikai   Fuck. This angers me the most
bleach,364jng,DeusExMachina810,18,Sat May 16 08:24:33 2015 UTC,I mean I feel like shikai and bankai are kind of relative. For example Kenpachi in shikai was still leagues above most of the other characters in bankai.  I'd take more pride from being defeated by Shunsui using a toothpick than by Hitsugaya with bankai for example.
bleach,364jng,Silversoth,2,Sat May 16 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"Right, But can you see Kenpatchi losing 1v1 vs any of the captains?  I honestly think he's the strongest captain as of right now."
bleach,364jng,Brandonspikes,3,Sat May 16 23:33:15 2015 UTC,Only strongest in terms of raw power tbh. I think someone like Shunsui could still beat him in a fight.
bleach,364jng,Ceegee93,9,Sun May 17 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"He was still able to fight on par with Shunsui and Jushiro, who are no weaklings. Those 2 captains in shikai were able to keep up with Yamamoto in the SS arc."
bleach,364jng,Hothera,4,Sat May 16 07:17:54 2015 UTC,Were able to keep up with Yamamoto? What?
bleach,364jng,Sandisk4gb4,6,Sat May 16 08:53:22 2015 UTC,"SS Arc - shortly after Shunsui/Ukitake break the seal for Rukia's Execution, Yamamoto chases them as they lead him far away from anyone else. It's implied that they fought for a bit, although nothing was shown onscreen"
bleach,364jng,Freddichio,2,Sat May 16 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Yama wasn't fighting all-out against them - he was in ""discipline"" mode.  Likewise, I sincerely doubt Shunsui/Ukitake had any intent whatsoever to kill Yama.  Had the fight been shown, I expect it would be much more like a master teaching/testing students than the sort of all-out dirty fight that Shunsui's powers in particular play to."
bleach,364jng,yukeake,1 point,Mon May 18 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, none of them intended to kill one another. But still, Yama certainly wasn't giving them a gentle treatment. He looked pretty pissed off."
bleach,364jng,Sunjammer0037,1 point,Tue May 19 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Sure - it was a master disciplining his students.  However, the OP was trying to say that Shunsui/Ukitake were ""keeping up with"" Yamamoto in the SS arc.  That particular encounter isn't indicative of skill/power, since all of them were holding back."
bleach,364jng,yukeake,1 point,Tue May 19 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"Well, you could compare it with Nanao almost fainting when he so much as looked at her, exerting his reiatsu. He was probably doing the same with Kyouraku and Ukitake but they were seemingly not affected by it. At the very least it showed what a tremendous power gap there was between the average vice captain like Nanao and the oldest and most powerful captains like Kyouraku and Ukitake."
bleach,364jng,Sunjammer0037,1 point,Tue May 19 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"Again, that's true, but largely irrelevant to the point OP raised.  Yamamoto's reiatsu when in ""battle mode"" affected Nanao because she didn't have the required reiatsu to defend herself from it.    Ichigo feels something similar when approaching Zaraki for the first time, but is able to overcome it without any special training.  The takeaway from that is the ability to ""repel"" others' reiatsu is either instinctive, or reasonably easy to figure out, assuming the base level required is met.  That base level seems to be something of a constant, rather than a variable, since we never see a Captain fall victim to it - even when facing an opponent who vastly outclasses them.    So really, all this tells us is that Shunsui/Ukitake have Captain-class reiatsu, and Nanao doesn't.  Which makes sense, given their ranks.  It doesn't speak to Shunsui/Ukitake/Yama's relative power levels."
bleach,364jng,yukeake,1 point,Tue May 19 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. But Ukitake and Kyouraku don't simply have Captain level-reiatsu. I still think this whole encunter was shown to demonstrate that Ukitake and Kyouraku aren't on the same level as most other Captains, and a closer relationship to him than others. If it were anyone else blatantly going against his orders, I don't think Yama would have even bothered to fight them. I think he sort of wanted to test Ukitake and Kyouraku. I have a feeling it's been a while since they fought each other."

But being able to put up a great fight until you go and not be curbstomped by someone neither Aizen  nor Ywach wanted to face fresh is still no mean feat. Do you think Byakuya or Hitsugaya could hold off mad Yamamoto for long?"
bleach,364jng,Freddichio,-10,Sat May 16 16:42:43 2015 UTC,Lol they suck dick. Especially shunsui who got rekted by a low level sternritter whom Byakuya veat 1v3.

bleach,364jng,aizen6,-1,Mon May 18 08:26:33 2015 UTC,Byakuya and kenpachi will rekt shunsui.
bleach,364jng,SHINee21,0,Mon May 18 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Kenpachi, but there's no way Byakuya can beat Shunsui. The guy was trained by Yamamoto, and he's got centuries of experience over Byakuya. Plus, we haven't seen his Bankai yet.  Byakuya is a 1000 years too young to take on Shunsui and survive. It's just that he doesn't look the type of bloodthirsty or vengeful Shinigami (like Byakuya or Kenpachi)."
bleach,364jng,aizen6,0,Mon May 18 13:08:52 2015 UTC,Blah blah blah all that matters is shunsui got rekted by a low level sternritter and lost an eye while byakuya beat him in a 1v3. If shunsui was really the most powerul captain at the moment he would have eadily beaten the old guy.  Lol trained by yamamoto and still got rekted. Okay okay.
bleach,364jng,SHINee21,1 point,Mon May 18 13:27:11 2015 UTC,"Shunsui didn't get ""rekt."" If you call that getting rekt, what would you call Byakuya who was killed by As Nodt, but brought back alive because of fanpower? Shunsui fared much better than Byakuya in the first invasion. Or because Rukia killed As Nodt, would you say Rukia is stronger than Byakuya?  1v3 made no sense because last time I checked, NaNaNa Najahkoop was still dancing. Besides, Byakuya needed Bankai to win against a fodder Espada when Shunsui took out the Primera with his Shikai. He and Ukitake are the only guys who could take on Yamamoto head on.   Shunsui had a lot of disadvantage in that fight (fighting against the pressure of getting his Bankai stolen), the shock of Yama-jii getting killed, incomplete knowledge of the enemy's abilities... Byakuya, on the other hand, had the security of being able to use Bankai, Royal Guard training and some knowledge of enemy abilities. And he still nearly got screwed by Pepe and had his ass saved by Kensei. He's still a 1000 years too young to be able to go toe to toe against Shunsui."
bleach,364jng,aizen6,0,Mon May 18 14:45:52 2015 UTC,im not talking about past events. im talking about current byakuya against current shunsui. byakuya post royal guard> current shunsui. why are you bringing past events when byakuya was clearly weaker than shunsui to make your point lmao
bleach,364jng,SHINee21,2,Mon May 18 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"I think the thing about him was that he was supposed to be different from other Espadas in almost all aspects. He didn't really give a shit about fighting, or anything at all, really. To him, fighting was simply abut staving off boredom, but unlike Kenpachi, Nnoitora or many others, he didn't have bloodlust, didn't care about glory or anything like that. During the whole fight with Kyoraku he acted like he didn't even want to be there. I don't think he even cared about winning - he looked nothing more than clinically curious about Kyouraku's abilities and wanted to make sense of them, but nothing more. I think his Resurrection reflected that - shooting guns is pretty efficient but it doesn't involve as much physical exertion, you don't get to literally beat people with your sword in fury.  In short, I think he was never supposed to be the ""cool"" guy. Not even cool in the ""I don't give a fuck about anything"" way, more like completely resigned about his life."

But his death seemed kinda rushed, like ""Hey, let's get to fighting Aizen and them now"". And why make it such a big deal about him being the Primera if you were just gonna retcon it into the whole ""Zero to Nine"" thing and make Yammy, fuckin' Yammy, the strongest Espada?!"
bleach,364jng,acesilver1,9,Sat May 16 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"Which we never really see him as the strongest either. He was just a massive brute with brute strength and probably powerful defenses. But then he gets off-screened by Byakuya/Kenpachi duo. Kenpachi who had some difficulty with Nnoitra, and Byakuya that attacks with a bunch of tiny blades, I can't imagine how they could have cut into Yammy's Hierro. You'd think he'd have some of the thickest Hierro in the manga but nope, he's taken down. I didn't care much for him though, he was annoying. He should have just stayed as #10 and not taken the glory of being the strongest from Starrk."

It'd have fit the formula too: Renji gets new powers, Renji squicks Mask easily to show how badass he is, Nanana gets an advantage (he talks about spending all that time observing him while he slept), and uses it to push him into a close fight.

Hence why I was pleasantly surprised that the Kasumioji filler arc's main focus was on Izuru and the impetus of Gin's departure still weighing heavily on him in the wake of Amagai taking over the post of 3rd Division Captain. It was great that Izuru was given the screentime he deserved to explore his suppressed feelings, and his fight with Makoto was pretty good given it touched on the same ideas about his failure and apparent weakness at failing to stop Gin's betrayal. Too bad it's a filler, because Izuru was really well written in it."

By itself, the power is ranged. The circumstances put her in need of using it up in close quarters, but that's hard to avoid when all potential opponents use swords. Her side spiritual weapon is a blade for that reason.  The other one is McAllon, who has a lot of melee potential from her letter of P for Power, but her reishi weapon is a bow. So it's the other way around to Bambietta.   In essence they're both ranged, they just have some level of proficiency in melee. Kinda like some shiningamis have a ranged or semi-ranged ability even though they're sword users. We still call them shiningamis."

The sternritter have shown a great variety in skills that had made this arc more interesting imho. I can't really think of any sternritter that have complex powers other than the Royd brothers (due mostly to confusing explanations) and Askin. The Espada were built to be better villains for sure. If the writing for the Sternritter was at the level that is was for the Espada, I don't think their slightly more unusual powers would be a problem for anyone."

bleach,362cis,darthnick426,10,Fri May 15 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"Not wrong at all. The reason it happened is because a lot of people liked the Gotei 13. I personally only liked some of them and really liked Ichigo's relationships with Chad and Uryu so, for me it's a disappointment."

On top of that I feel like Karin & Kukaku look so much alike that Ichigo should've almost immediately clicked and had a lingering feeling of ""being at home"" around Kukaku and Ganju.  I too wish that the animators didn't rush Kubo with his work, they went way too fast developing the anime that they complained about the lack of manga to go by and just made filler episodes & filler arcs that really sucked and annoyed fans & viewers.

bleach,362cis,DahjerCanaan,5,Fri May 15 15:27:53 2015 UTC,The fillers didn't bother me as much as the padding of canon episodes did. I would've rather Bleach taken season breaks like here in the US but apparently the Japanese just don't do that.

bleach,362cis,atuinsbeard,15,Sat May 16 08:59:10 2015 UTC,"I still think that even though they rushed him and squashed part of the story, they did give Kubo a big chance with the manga.   When you look at Naruto and One Piece, those stories are filled with random events and official filler-like padding, while many characters get abandoned or pop-up from nowhere. Why is that? Well, because neither of them expected the story to get big. So they needed time to write the story while publishing it, destroying the consistency.   When you read bleach it lacks in random events. When you look back at it after reading, you see a trail of connected, convoluted dots. It's no secret that Kubo had planned the whole story, from arc to at least the mugetsu fight. He knew he's going big and he knew he's going to make a success. Publishers must have known that. Bleach had to be crafted to be a hundreds of chapters long series. I don't think any mangaka would get that offer nowadays. Especially with only one, ongoing series under his belt, since hey. Bleach is the second manga Kubo ever made and he never finished his first. Makes you wonder how great will the third be, will he ever decide to make it."
bleach,362cis,Zil_v_a,16,Fri May 15 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"I've marathoned One Piece manga from the beginning to the most current arc and it flowed much better though. Oda doesn't really ""abandon"" characters like Kubo does."
bleach,362cis,BlindfoldScience,9,Fri May 15 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, One Piece is very detailed and planned out.  It is not as erratic or ""all over the place"" as Bleach."
bleach,362cis,everythingismotion,4,Fri May 15 21:47:19 2015 UTC,True. I like the way the events mesh well together. The main problem I have with Bleach is that it gives me a constant impression that it was done hurriedly.
bleach,362cis,BlindfoldScience,3,Fri May 15 23:56:08 2015 UTC,To be fair a lot of shounen have like cast fatigue where only certain segements get fleshed out. Oda's pretty unique in building on everything in his world.
bleach,362cis,-mickomoo-,1 point,Sat May 16 11:57:05 2015 UTC,"He does all the time. Over hundred plus characters will never get shown again that were big.   The people in choppers arc, alabasta arc, nami's arc, sangi's arc, who were important are now abandoned (some havent been seen in 10 years) but oda gets excused for it.   Where is crocodile? Is he not like one of the most popular characters yet it's been like 3+ years since his last appearance. (unless he was shown in the last 30 chaps i haven't read)   But kubo just drops characters.  Not saying bleach is better than OP but some of the stuff kubo gets blamed for but oda gets excused for is the same."
bleach,362cis,DylanTheZaku,6,Sat May 16 04:08:16 2015 UTC,"The difference is that nearly all of Oda's characters get satisfying endings or farewells when they are potentially left to never been seen again, and the fact that he does that with so many is pretty impressive. Also, for the majority of them, they aren't teased that they may return, so when they do its more of a happy surprise than anything else. Just like with Crocodile, who got a second satisfying end when he was no longer needed.  The same can't be said for Kubo. As you said he just drops characters left and right, which is what he gets grief for."
bleach,362cis,Xynth22,3,Sat May 16 08:11:02 2015 UTC,"Nah. They were not ""abandoned"". It was properly done. There's proper ""closure"" each arc. And even though Crocodile is popular, I don't think he has anything to do with Dressrosa Arc."
bleach,362cis,BlindfoldScience,3,Sat May 16 08:49:06 2015 UTC,"It's a difference in world, though. One Piece is a story where the protagonists are constantly traveling. It wouldn't make sense for someone they left on an island hundreds or thousands of miles back to reappear. Likewise, Crocodile isn't a main character, he just intersected with Luffy's story twice. Most others got shown after the time-skip in cover series, which is really all they needed, their story had already been told.  Bleach however takes place in the same general area, the problems and conflicts and enemies are pretty relevant to every character, and some just disappear forever, or are never expanded on whatsoever. It doesn't really make sense in the scope of the story for there to be a war on the Gotei 13 and to have members of the Gotei 13 just go missing for huge chunks of screentime."

Yes OP has a lot of characters, but most of them play at least some part in the arc and are introduced and many come into play hundreds of chapters after they enter the story.  I like bleach, and I hate to say this, but I haven't found much enjoyment out of this arc. The last half year has just felt like waiting for Ichigo to move between the palace and soul society, swing his sword once, and then have to move back where he just came from. Just my personal opinion tho"
bleach,362cis,redkardon,6,Sat May 16 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Ichigo doesn't act, he reacts, which IMO is the core problem. I enjoy the fight scenes and dialogue and the world Kubo's built but it's hard for me to like the main character when it seems like he's always relying on someone else to tell him what to do and when. Yoruichi or Urahara tell him to point his sword there and he nods and goes for it. This wasn't the case earlier in the series, when he actively fought Hollows, rescued Rukia, etc; but as the fight against Aizen dragged on it seemed like he lost motivation and became depressed. And even after Rukia gave him hos powers back, he's still sort of ""I'ma kill that guy cuz everyone told me he's a bad guy."""

My main problem was the way it was done, the Bount arc was fitted in well time-wise, but was awful. The other two filler arcs were just ""Ichigo is in a pressing situation!

bleach,362cis,ecass305,3,Fri May 15 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can blame it all on the publishers though. In my opinion Kubo has some of the blame. I think Kubo was given room to write his story but he just took too long to tell it and there was so little content for the anime. So they had to rush him to placate fans and keep the anime going because they have to make their money.   I was left with a lot of questions when arcs were over which I think Kubo meant to answer but because he took so long and the publishers were rushing him he didn't have time to explain. Like Gin's motives, Aizen's motives, the Hogyoku. I think the Fullbringer Arc was supposed gives us more insight on Soul Society and possibly hints into Yhwach's reasoning for attacking it.  I have a feeling once the show is over we will get more insight into how the Kubo originally intended for the manga to go. I remember watching the tv show Firefly and then the sequel movie Serenity and recognized the change in character of the mc Malcolm. In the movie he was darker but in show he was more lighthearted. When I did research I found out that is how the creator intended him originally to be with the studio execs wanting him to be more lighthearted and fun."
bleach,362cis,AronTimes,3,Fri May 15 22:04:37 2015 UTC,"The characterization and the plot is inconsistent has hell. You're not supposed to think about it too much, just admire the pretty art (seriously, the writing got progressively worse as the art got better and better).   Aizen was never going to be anything other than a murder victim. He really was dead when he was impaled on his own zanpakuto in Soul Society. Kubo changed his mind in the middle of writing the Soul Society arc. Gin and Kenpachi approached Byakuya together, interested in his sister-in-law, Rukia, who had secretly been implanted with the McGuffin by Urahara. Gin and Kenpachi have since never been seen together after this one scene. I suspect that they were going to be the actual villains of the original story. It makes no sense for Tousen to side with Aizen, nor for Aizen to keep Tousen alive. Tousen, by virtue of being completely blind, is completely immune to Aizen's illusions. When this fact was revealed, I immediately leapt to the logical conclusion that Tousen, who had been grievously wounded by Kenpachi (who was seen in the company of Gin, one of the actual bad guys), would've been their ace in the hole. Instead, the story revealed the ""logical"" conclusion that he was in league with Aizen the Master Illusionist. WTF?"
bleach,362cis,Dynamex,1 point,Sat May 16 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Where did you hear that? Gin was the only one interested in Byakuyas reaction towards his sister being executed and kenpachi just went along and wanted to fight byakuya. The reason they have been never seen together after that is because Gin had his own plans and locations to be in wheras kenpachi was searching for ichigo. You could say the ONLY reason they even had an interaction together was because they were captains of the gotei 13. They work together. The whole ""I DONT GET TOUSEN!"" idea is pretty weird to me. I mean yeah of course. If you have the knowledge of ichigo being the protagonist than chosing the way with the least bloodshed would be ichigos side but in tousen view aizen was insanely strong and his lust for power would have killed anyone standing in his way. I mean when i heard what his zanpakutou was capable of i searched and searched forever to find a weakness. It was obvious at the end that he had to lose the sword in order to be beaten (which also got impossible because he is immortal now).   I think Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero had the same dilemma. All he wanted was to help the most people but the numbers were getting lower and lower until ""most"" meant only 2 and it all fell down. Maybe tousen thought if at the end he, gin and aizen were still alive he would have saved the most he could but maybe that was dumb because sometimes people make dumb decisions."
bleach,362cis,EspadaPrimera,6,Sun May 17 07:25:31 2015 UTC,"I also wish that he could've done what he wanted to do. The Karin, Yuzu, Tatsuki, Keigo, Mizuiro, Ururu, Jinta, Tessai, Chad, Uryu, all the vizards, all the fullbringers, only half of the espada got a backstory and those were supposed to be even more fleshed out. All these characters and more from what I read and heard were supposed to be more developed. The most notable example is the Fullbringer Arc that was rushed. It was supposed to focus on all the humans more and the shinigami were supposed to have a smaller role and/or come later but Kubo was rushed.  Why can't we have nice things-Fullbringer Arc."
bleach,362cis,SafferCrystal,0,Wed May 20 09:26:57 2015 UTC,"Except you can see, on this very subreddit, the reason why the Fullbringer arc was rushed. A lot of people hate the Fullbringer arc, calling it canon filler and wondering why the Gotei 13 didn't show up with the reiatsu sword earlier. Ichigo being 'emo' was boring, even though it was important character development."
bleach,362cis,EspadaPrimera,7,Fri May 15 17:45:44 2015 UTC,That's your opinion. A decent amount of people on this sub actually enjoyed it and wished it would have been done better.

Though, I do wish Kubo had given more backstory about Ginjō."

bleach,362cis,Billalone,6,Fri May 15 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"You are aware that kubo doesn't have complete creative control, right? If his publisher isn't getting the numbers they want, they can go to him and say ""This stuff is popular, do more of it. Otherwise we're dropping your manga""."
bleach,362cis,Dynamex,1 point,Fri May 15 18:29:44 2015 UTC,I think you kinda underplay the power of a publisher. Its in movies too. Publishers react to money that means if they see sudden increase of sales when kon is in the manga and it drops again after he gets out they will not only pressure you but kindly remind you that you signed a contract and they decide if they want to keep you in the shonen jump or not. In the end we have more kon just because the teens thought he was really funny at the time but now he just plain sucks.
bleach,362cis,Bolded,1 point,Sat May 16 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"I heard that the arrancar arc was made longer because arrancars were popular after fans.   Grimmjow would've been killed off earlier instead of having two more fights and coming back later for an example. While I think that some of the biggest mess-up were Kubo's doing, I do think that his artistic views were somewhat restricted for the purpose of moar money."
bleach,362cis,EspadaPrimera,5,Wed May 20 09:12:01 2015 UTC,How would Grimmjow have been defeated earlier if he didn't even pull out his zanpaktou in his first fight with Ichigo. At least one more fight after that one would've been necessary.

It'd be a pain in the ass to hack the rom, the sprites from 3rd phantom aren't quite the same style, and they have only a fraction of the number of frames that the first two games have. (Bonnie has as many frames in the 2nd game as many of the new characters have in 3rd phantom. No, I'm not joking.) So even if you did it, it would look terrible.   tl;dr Just go grab MUGEN, I'm sure they already have something similar already made."

bleach,362gja,MrSterlock,8,Fri May 15 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"i think this is actually a good question. Definitely not one we've coverd 100 times.  Why did the soul king specifically ask for Ichigo to be summoned to the Royal Palace?  Opinions on why could change with each chapter. Its hard to say.   My initial thought is due to ichigo's crazy combination of bloodlines, he could be on par or even greater in strength than the squad 0 members already protecting the soul king.  The soul king wanted all of those powers to be unlocked for protection. It didnt work out.  We'll if there's more to the soul kings plan in the future I guess."
bleach,362gja,c9IceCream,2,Fri May 15 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"Well...I think it might have something to do with simply his accomplishments (just like Urahara and Aizen go to see him before) or with his strength. I mean, it doesn't seem that other shiningamis ever went to a state even similar to mugetsu. Maybe it's a thing that was once a shiba family power. With all those powers he is also still a human.   I wouldn't be surprised if SK just wanted him around when Juha comes, just for additional defense, or maybe simply planned to take a look at him and figure out if he needs to be changed into a full-blown shiningami he could keep, before he disappears somewhere (thus the tickets.)."

This is when icihigo was bought up and the soul king's servants pointed out that the soul kings eyes have opened. I think there is MAJOR significance here. That order was perhaps an action he concluded he should take after seeing the future. Whatever Ichigo accomplished in his royal realm training should be enough to stop yhwach, according to the soul king, maybe not kill, maybe we don't actually even know the soul kings true intentions...whatever the case there definitely is gonna be a huge twist, I can't wait"

Also, Yhwach calls him Haschwalth when if he were his son I'd think he'd call him Jugram.  Haschwalth is unique though in that he's the only one other than Yhwach and BG9 with a ""German"" name.

Yamamoto was clearly influenced by Ichigo and the other Shinigami as its hinted he was a lot less forgiving in his past. Plus the fact that all the older characters carry with them some incredible murderous intent.  As for Aizen, I don't think he could change that. He was a Shinigami who became a monster, had no ties to other individuals and wanted ultimate power. Not a good setup for a successful king.  Tousen...honestly couldn't stand the character, his motivation was extremely weak and his resolve/commitment to his cause was broken almost immediately. He goes against everything he said he believed in. I think Aizens power could influence Tousen if it was released in front of him.

bleach,361cgy,Rocksbury,2,Fri May 15 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going off the anime because it's been a while since I read that far back, but when Unohana finds Aiken in Central 46's chambers he explains his powers, telling her anyone that sees it is under its control. Unohana get a look of realization and Aizen's mentions she must have figured out that, since Tousen can't see, he has been a willing participant the whole time."
bleach,361cgy,Unipanther,2,Fri May 15 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"Tousen wanted to follow the path of least bloodshed (towards revenge).  He viewed Aizen's path as meeting his goals.  Notably, Aizen has killed very few that we know of.   He appears to have fed part of Matsumoto's soul to his hogyoku, but not all of it, as she's still alive. The vizards got screwed, but are still alive (thanks to Urahara). Isshin was attacked by White, but is still alive (thanks to Masaki) Masaki was attacked by White, but lived (until Yhwach's auswahlen and Grand Fisher) Momo has been stabbed (repeatedly) but is still alive. Aizen planned to kill Rukia (as a way to get at the hogyoku hidden inside her), but ultimately he removed it from her without killing her. Yama was wounded, but not killed (until Yhwach) Harribel was stabbed, but survived. He fought only to defend himself from Isshin, Yoruichi, and Urahara - none of whom were seriously injured. He blew up Kototsu.  Whether this counts as a kill isn't exceptionally clear. A few residents of Karakura got squicked by Mullet-Aizen's reiatsu.  We don't know that they're dead, but they were last seen lying in pools of their own blood, so it's very likely these are casualties.  Ichigo, of course, wasn't killed. Binding-guy's hands got sheared off, but he wasn't killed.   Aizen's actually got very little blood on his hands, at least that we can see.  Tousen may have actually been right (especially considering the mass purging of Rukongai by Mayuri, with Yama's blessing)."

bleach,361cgy,staticccc,1 point,Fri May 15 11:30:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, we do. Aizen wanted to be god."
bleach,361cgy,CptAustus,3,Fri May 15 13:15:50 2015 UTC,i believe that its more then just that.
bleach,361cgy,staticccc,3,Fri May 15 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"Not really, Ichigo himself says Aizen wanted to have an equal, but he was higher than all of Gotei. At some point he met the Soul King, only to find out his equal is a stone. At that point he figured out a rock can't rule the world, so there's someone pulling those strings, so he decided to tear down Gotei, become a god, and fix the world."
bleach,361cgy,CptAustus,2,Fri May 15 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"Reread those two chapters - Ichigo mentions that all he felt inside Aizen's blade was solitude; he then follows it up that IF aizen truly was born with such immense power/intellect (which put a lot of responsibility on his shoulders), THEN maybe there was some part of him deep down that wanted to wish away his powers (so he could be average).   The implication is that he wished away his own powers and the Hogoyku acted upon his desires (thus its still under his control, but his resolve is broken). However this is not 100% confirmed - just a possible plot point that Kubo can pursue if he wants too.  Also Urahara's expression when Aizen rages about why he doesnt act against the SK implies that there is much more to it than ego. Couple in the fact that S0 says Aizen is pure evil, the Quincy say the Shinigami were ruthless/evil killers, and that the theme of the 3 defectors (Aizen, Gin, Kaname) were all revenge with initially noble intentions means that it's probably deeper than Aizen simply wanted to be god."
bleach,361cgy,aversion25,1 point,Fri May 15 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"it's probably deeper than Aizen simply wanted to be god.    And where is the evidence? In End of Hypnosis Aizen makes it quite clear he wants to become a god, finally has the means for that, and that he doesn't consider the SK one. Once he starts evolving until his defeat it's quite clear he doesn't care about anything other than becoming a ""transcendental being"", and again he repeats his ""god"" speech."
bleach,361cgy,CptAustus,1 point,Fri May 15 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"I just gave you all the evidence - its a theory, but his motivations were never EXPLICITLY stated. Kaname went on and on about justice/path of least bloodshed, but before he died he came to terms that it was all about revenge for friend. Gin never revealed any of his motivation until before he died (before he sounded like he enjoyed hurting people).  And despite whatever Aizen said throughout the series, he only lost his composure right before being sealed (his emotions are a better indicator of his motivation). Otherwise his dialogue was very calculated.   Aizen definitely got caught up in the transcendence thing, but he had to believe in his own powers. He was about to go try to take out S0/the SK. It reminded me of Vegeta telling Frieza over and over he was a super saiyan when he fought him. If Aizen wasn't a god, then he was marching towards death. And if Ichigo was able to beat him, he had no chance of accomplishing his goals (becoming SK) - thus his resolve broke.   It could be possible that Aizen was just an ego maniac who cared only about being at the top, but that doesnt fit with all the seeds they planted/themes Kubo set up. If Kubo goes that route it will basically make him a completely another simple villian who wants power for the sake of power"

Also, Kaname is not known in Bleach to be one of the smartest captains. I always thought that when he asked Sousuke that he wanted to have a resurrección was one of the dumbest ideas I've ever read on Bleach."
bleach,361cgy,ludicrouscuriosity,1 point,Fri May 15 12:29:41 2015 UTC,"I dont think he directly asked for it, at the time the strongest thing other than a bankai was a hollow infused shinigami, so I'd imagine tousen wanted something that far surpassed a bankai and since aizen had come way further than he did with shinji and co with hollowfication he probably could of used the orb of destruction to make tousen into a perfect vizard, if you noticed every vizard had a hollow form, Tousen probably just learned control of his"
bleach,361cgy,Keranu,1 point,Fri May 15 19:19:19 2015 UTC,You have it the wrong way around. Tousen's blindness made him an obvious problem. Aizen was either going to find a way to control him or kill him.

bleach,35xdfb,EspadaPrimera,3,Thu May 14 10:05:48 2015 UTC,Haschwalth gives absolutely no fucks about the situation. Everyone is freaking out while he just carries on as normal. Why do I feel like he's one of those characters that will end up decimating a Captain or two by himself?

bleach,35xdfb,izn1337,5,Thu May 14 16:25:05 2015 UTC,So I colorized a panel of Grimmjow being in the mood for death threats.  http://i.imgur.com/iQnpFxJ.png

And have you removed the background (making it transparent then colouring it). I've an issue with pixels left alot, like greyish whenever I remove the background, so wondering what you might have done to improve it to this level. I use Adobe Photoshop CS6 btw."
bleach,35xdfb,izn1337,2,Fri May 15 07:47:25 2015 UTC,"I use Paint tool SAI to color. With it I can create a layer called Linework layer, which I use to trace the lines. I can then highlight areas in the linework layer, and then color in that area in layers below the Llayer."

bleach,35xdfb,Copy_Ninja93,2,Sun May 17 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"wooo man, I just checked it out, this is going to take ages to actually linework whole chapter. I think I'm good with Photoshop then lol, I'll just use different layer modes to solve those pixel edges. EDIT: this is me trying with photoshop for the first time ever. chp625 page 3rd/4th (Ignore the first panel, right side needs some colouring and fixing stuff aswell, well I fucked up the first panel pretty much)"
bleach,35xdfb,mostafasalah,2,Sun May 17 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"It's quite good! The difference is you keep to the original format far more than me! And yeah, it takes me a couple hours to do the lines, and a few more to do the actual coloring. I usually spend a day on one page! If you look at the speech bubble with ""And if Hueco Mundo's no more..."" you can see I forgot to color the small flerp that indicates who is speaking.  It's an example of using the highlight tool and forgetting to get the areas where the pixels strangle to access."
bleach,35xdfb,cerealfalcon,2,Sun May 17 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Aha, I see, I didn't even notice that little white thing but still no comparison with mine, yours is too good. The image I posted is done totally with transparent background, did colouring properly with brush, without going outside of line. (requires a steady hand, and a good mouse) and using eraser all the time. I sometime use Magic Wand but it makes me so lazy since I'll have to switch between the lining layer and the layer where I've to colour so I usually ignore that method. So yeah, now I'm currently trying something else without removing background (making it transparent), now I'm just particularly focusing on layer modes (should've known about it before), so that thing actually solves my edges problem, and plus I don't have to use Magic Wand all the time since I can just colour even on the original lining layer then simply set the layer mode (the only thing needs to be done is experimenting with all types of layer). Oh, heck I didn't even know about the cloud filter, and few more stuff, I'm quite sure I can do much much better now since I'm experimenting with shading aswell and shadowing layer so that they would look cool. Coloured chapter 625 release is possibly this week since I've got some tests on university on Wednesday, I'll be free by then."
bleach,35xdfb,Auesis,3,Sun May 17 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"So hype to see Haschwalth in the future. I was so gutted when his fight with Kyoraku didn't go ahead, I really hope he lives up to the potential. Ywach seems to place him above the other Quincy and his attitude to the way events progress indicates why."

Don't you think it strange Byakuya had it easy with Zommari while Ichigo was only breaking even with Grimmjow while using Bankai on top of his mask?

bleach,35zwpt,Temperatia,2,Fri May 15 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"All espadas were really strong, Byakuya was lucky he had someone who matched his fighting style where being faster gave him the edge (same for Mayuri with preparations and Kenpachi with raw force).

bleach,35vg1r,jlcoll3v,3,Wed May 13 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember technically he is a part of one of the prime families in Soul Society - the Shiba clan.  Isshin Kurosaki took his wife's name, he's Isshin Shiba. This was why in the beginning of the series characters kept discussing and saying random ""is he?"" Type questions. Even Bayakuya denied the possibility to Ukitake when Yoruichi saved Ichigo before training him in Bankai.  With what was known during the fullbring arc, I doubt there is any questioning. Following all of the coming truths during that arc and since then, even Bayakuya has a vastly changed attitude towards Ichigo."
bleach,35vg1r,agentgreasy,7,Wed May 13 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that just because he looked so much like Kaien Shiba?

I mean, his father was a captain of Soul Society and even though he had given up of his role as the captain I don't think they would simply forget him on the real world. I think that they are aware that Ichigo has Quincy blood on its veins, but that's an info that maybe just the captains are aware, or maybe just the captain commander. Also, don't forget, Urahara, after Aizen had shown his true colours, became closer to SS, so he could have shared this info. I think it's highly unlikely that they don't know about that."

bleach,35r5pr,Direktorman,18,Tue May 12 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"What I got from it, Orihime was getting a bit jealous that a girl as hot as Nel is practically throwing herself all over Ichigo while saying it's because of Urahara's braclet that she is now able to stay in her adult form the whole time and be of some ""use"" to Ichigo. Chad sees this, and he tries to console her by telling her she shouldn't worry, and that Urahara most likely made the armband solely so Nel could fight against the Quincy, and not for her to be of any other ""use"" to Ichigo.  Though I really think that Orihime should be more worried about Nel's intentions regarding Ichigo, rather than why would Urahara make such a thing in the first place (it's Urahara, that's what he does). But Chad comments on the armband thing, so I guess that's what's bothering her."

Right now everything is semi-explained and we're at a point where the next step is each group debuting at different times. Plus the last chapter's cliffhanger was Yhwach finishing absorbing the Soul King, so I think we might tie up what's happening with Urahara's group and then end with Yhwach's new form and a flashback to show his relationship with the Soul King.  Also hoping that Yhwach will now look like OMZ or Tensa Zangetsu, but I'm not holding my breath on that one."

bleach,35ujcg,whatacrappyusername,6,Wed May 13 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"But there are some differences: it was Chad's pride in his skin that awoke his powers, while it was actually Orihime's desire to protect Tatsuki that caused her powers to form. Also Orihime's pride was actually in her hair not her hairpins.   Chad's powers activated because he wanted to protect Karin. It wasn't until much later that his pride in his skin was mentioned. It's almost a retcon since Yoruichi also gives them a speech about how people activate their powers when they want to protect something.   You're foiling your own argument by trying to say it was pride that awoke Chad's powers, but the desire to protect that awoke Orihime's powers. You're cherry picking.   Having pride in her hair could still cause her power to manifest from her hairpins. They are an accessory worn in her hair and a symbol of the reason she feels pride in her hair. Fullbring don't all follow a specific formula. Her Fullbringing her hairpins instead of her hair itself is really as random as Chad only using Fullbring on the skin of his arms, but not anywhere else on his body."
bleach,35ujcg,Temperatia,0,Wed May 13 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"The point is that the powers awoke in a similar manner, but they aren't 100% the same.   When Yoruichi first started training Chad and Orihime, she told them to think about what they were trying to protect. Thinking about protecting Tatsuki helped Orihime activate her powers, but Chad thought about protecting Karin and nothing happened to him. So the evidence shows their powers activated in a similar, but different manner.  Also Chad thought about his fist, which is close enough to the skin on his fist not to be a retcon imo. Orihime's hair is directly connected to her relationship with Tatsuki, so that is why she was thinking about her hair and not her hairpins. She wears her hairpins for her brother, not Tatsuki. Yet her hair did not gain any powers, it was her hairpins."
bleach,35ujcg,Zil_v_a,1 point,Wed May 13 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"I believe that Chad noted in the fullbring arc that his fullbring lies in ""Those arms of his"" and not skin.  Orihime has a big storyline regarding her brother and her regret towards him and her hair was also a part of that plot along the lines. The hairpin makes reasonable amount of sense and the main reason behind it is probably in the design. It's hard to have a support who uses her hair to heal people.   Their powers have been manifested by them cursing their powerlessness, not by them desiring to protect others. That's why Chad's desire to protect Karin wasn't really the thing, it's not what he truly believed in. Also, the power was granted by the Hongyoku and not their inner hollow fragments."

Perhaps you read a different translation? In the mangastream translation he refers to his skin.  http://www.mangastream.to/bleach-chapter-450-page-17.html   Orihime has a big storyline regarding her brother and her regret towards him and her hair was also a part of that plot along the lines. The hairpin makes reasonable amount of sense and the main reason behind it is probably in the design. It's hard to have a support who uses her hair to heal people.   It all kinda makes sense, but I think if Kubo wanted to make Orihime a Fullbringer, he would have done a few things differently so she matched Chad and the other Fullbringers better.   For example: maybe instead of her classmates bullying her about her hair, she could have been bullied over her hairpins instead. Rather than hairpin's powers awaking when she thought of protecting Tatsuki, they could have awakened when she thought of the pride she had in wearing them. And instead of turning into spirits, her hairpins turn into giant flower-like shields.  But since there are some differences between the way Orihime's powers awoke and the Fullbringer's it seems more likely to me that her powers are supposed to be somewhat similar to Fullbring, but different.    Their powers have been manifested by them cursing their powerlessness, not by them desiring to protect others. That's why Chad's desire to protect Karin wasn't really the thing, it's not what he truly believed in. Also, the power was granted by the Hongyoku and not their inner hollow fragments.   It is a combination of both wanting to protect and not having enough power. If they simply wanted to protect, but they already had the power to do so, they wouldn't have gotten powers- that is probably why Tatsuki didn't get anything. If they were weak, but had nothing to protect, they wouldn't have gotten powers either though. That is why the other classmates didn't get any powers.  It was specifically the thought of protecting others that triggered Orihime's powers to emerge, while it was Chad's thoughts about his pride that triggered his powers. If Chad just thought about his pride he probably could have triggered it somehow like how Ichigo was able to awaken his powers- but he only thought about it because he was placed in that specific situation.  As for the Hougyoku, I'm not sure how that thing works. I'd rather not get into that."
bleach,35ujcg,Temperatia,1 point,Fri May 15 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"Hougyoku essentially manifests the desires it feels like. If god would be a woman, that would be his name. It's hard to avoid it since it was specifically told in the story that it's responsible from them gaining their powers.   Perhaps you read a different translation?    No, that's the one. He says that it's ""The skin on this arm"" so that's probably why I remembered it as ""the arm"" and not ""the skin"".  Now the sad part. The reason why other classmates go nothing is...the editorial department. I mean, most of the gang was supposed to be important. But he didn't get a time for that and later on he wanted to make a neutral faction and somehow explain both Orihime and Chad. That's why Fullbringers might seem a bit inconsistent or undefined.   Ah, and about the hairpin. I believe it was the symbol of her pride in her hair."
bleach,35ujcg,Alluka-,1 point,Fri May 15 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"I take it you are just going by what Aizen said about their powers? Aizen did not give a full explanation as to why their powers awoke here. When Shonou (one of Orhimie's spirits) first started talking to Orihime he said it was due to thanks to “outside influences” that Orihime got her powers- which could include the Hougyoku- but Shonou also mentioned Ichigo as a reason why she got her powers.   Aizen knows how the Hougyoku works, but he may not have known the exact circumstances in which Chad and Orihime were in when their powers awoke. Even if he did, he had no reason to give Isshin the complete explanation; he was just telling Isshin what the Hougyoku did anyway."
bleach,35ujcg,seventhsoul,0,Sat May 16 13:26:27 2015 UTC,That's not really evidence. Chad not being able to activate his power on his first try doesn't prove anything. Chad couldn't even remember what Karin looked like so that's not much of a memory for him to go off of when trying to find his powers again.
bleach,35ujcg,materhern,0,Wed May 13 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"How is it not evidence? Kubo had the opportunity three times to show that Chad awoke/activated his powers just like Orihime (When his powers first awoke, again when they were training, the other time when Ichigo was training) yet in all instances he made them somewhat different. Kubo has been consistent here, nothing has been retconned imo."
bleach,35ujcg,Biotrin,3,Wed May 13 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the people who thinks there is something more to Orihime than her simply being a Fullbringer.  Look at this page from the manga. Aizen says, ""Her ability is awe-inspiring. The ""Rejection of Events"" is a power that far exceeds the realm of what is permitted to humans. The highest levels of Soul Society understood the significance of this ability...""  I actually hope she becomes pivotal to the story instead of being a generic damsel in distress, medic plot device, supporting character."

bleach,35ujcg,Rydel6,2,Wed May 13 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Orihime is different, but I wouldn't say Fullbringers just turn objects into weapons. Tsukishima was able to write himself into the history of whatever he cuts. It is a bit weird that her powers manifest as living beings, but she is kinda weird herself and I think they could have just turned out that way because of her personality. I don't think Kubo has thought as far as the Fullbring arc when Orihime and Chad's powers were awoken, which is probably the reason she seems different.  As for viewing Nel as a shinigami, it's very easy to draw a parallel there - arrancars are hollows that have ripped of their masks to gain powers similar to the shinigami (kinda the opposite of the Visored who gained hollow-like powers).  To end my ranting, I think Orihime is a fullbringer, solely because she fits in there the most. We saw very few people who were capable of using fullbring, so there is no real control group here, I can't really tell whether her powers stand out or not. All of their powers were kinda weird. She could turn out to be something completely different, but there is no solid evidence to support it."
bleach,35ujcg,Sagotomi,2,Wed May 13 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"It is a bit weird that her powers manifest as living beings, but she is kinda weird herself and I think they could have just turned out that way because of her personality.    It isn't just that her powers manifest as living beings- it is that she  has a completely different relationship with her Shun-Shun-Rikka than Fullbringers have with their powers. Shun-Shun-Rikka helped Orihime out by telling her what their names are and how to use their powers. They are like guardians. Fullbring is like a tool, you have to figure out how to use it or it will be useless. Or worse: you could hurt yourself or someone else on accident.     As for viewing Nel as a shinigami, it's very easy to draw a parallel there - arrancars are hollows that have ripped of their masks to gain powers similar to the shinigami (kinda the opposite of the Visored who gained hollow-like powers).   That is kinda the point. Shiginami powers are similar to Nel's powers, but there are some key differences. Just like how Fullbring is similar to Orihime's powers, but they are some key differences.   To end my ranting, I think Orihime is a fullbringer, solely because she fits in there the most.   If you were seeing Nel use her powers for the first time, but you didn't know about arrancar (or Vizards), would you conclude she is a Shiginami because that is what she is the closest to? Or would you think she is something different?   I can't really tell whether her powers stand out or not.   Her powers certainly stand out. When Orihime was first visiting the Soul-Society, Mayuri was very interested in her powers. He was so busy making her offers to be his test subject that he didn't even notice the super-rare Quincy that was with her until there was a bow in his face. Mayuri has shown zero interest in Fullbringers though. He didn't seek out Chad in Hueco Mundo. Nor did he take the opportunity to go to the real world and study Xcution."
bleach,35ujcg,YachiruTheKittyKat,2,Thu May 14 04:44:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of what you're saying does make sense. But to me Orihime's powers never stood out too much from the rest of the Fullbringers. Sure it may be OP, but some shinigami are way more OP than others, and yet they all belong to the same group.  TBH, I never really overanalyze these things, I just took it as granted that she is a Fullbringer. As I see it now, there is as much evidence that she is a Fullbringer as there is that she isn't one. I'll say it again, she may turn out to be something else, but I just don't see Kubo making that twist now. If he was planning something, he would've at least hinted it during the Fullbring arc. Or maybe I'm missing a lot of things here, I don't know, man."

bleach,35obw8,David4647,67,Tue May 12 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"I like what you're thinking OP but I think his new bankai will be a combination of your idea and another.  I'm still convinced that the majority of his new bankai will take influence from White and will look very similar to this. Except of course I expect him to be dual wielding and I don't think his hands will be connected to his swords. In other words I expect his bankai to look very similar to this. I expect his new bankai to look very close to his hollow form from when he fought Ulquiorra.   As we know, a bankai is the physical manifestation of one's zanpakuto's true form into the world. Since we all now know that Zangetsu's true and original form is White, it only makes sense that his true bankai looks as such. Now this begs the question: well if that's zangetsu's true bankai, then why hasn't it always looked like that? Easy. OMZ. As we know OMZ has been suppressing Ichigo's shinigami powers, aka Zangetsu, from the beginning. As such only small portions of Ichigo's power/Zangetsu's power were able to come to the surface. I believe that during Ichigo's fight with Ulquiorra it was the very first time that Zangetsu's true bankai was actually allowed to come to the surface. Because Ichigo's life was in mortal danger and because it is OMZ's truest wish to protect Ichigo, OMZ allowed more of Zangetsu to come to the surface than ever before. He ceased suppressing Zangetsu so he could defeat Ulquiorra and save Ichigo. After the fight OMZ began suppressing Zangetsu once more but since it is increasingly more difficult to suppress Zangetsu each time OMZ allows him to come to the surface, Ichigo's power continued to increase thus the changing of Ichigo's mask. Since Ichigo's shinigami and hollow powers are actually one in the same apart of his zanpakuto, his mask changing was because Ichigo was growing closer to his true bankai power after that release.  Further supporting evidence of this theory of Ichigo's second hollow form being his true bankai comes from when he visits his inner world in bankai during his dangai training. As we are told, the zanpakuto's spirit changes when their user is in bankai. And just what does hollow Ichigo look like now while Ichigo is in bankai in his inner world? Oh right he looks like this. He looks like this now because OMZ can't suppress him as much as he used to and as such the closest thing to the true form of his bankai has come to the surface.  Now as for why I believe the flaming sword you mentioned will be his dual wielding weapons, that is explained rather easily. As we know OMZ is Ichigo's Quincy power, hence his similar appearance to Yhwach, etc. That flaming blade OMZ shows has a striking resemblance to this sword the Yhwach used himself. Ichigo's Quincy powers need to be incorporated into his new bankai some how. What better way than this? As such I believe that Ichigo's bankai swords will look like the flaming blade due to their resemblance to Yhwach's energy blade he summoned.  To summarize The main difference I see that will happen in his new bankai form that will differ from his old hollow form will be his zanpakuto. Since OMZ has been made his own blade and has been seamlessly transitioned to be apart of Ichigo's zanpakuto powers, I think he'll be dual wielding those flaming rieatsu swords that OMZ revealed. The same swords you believe to be his new bankai blades. Obviously the majority of Ichigo's bankai will look like his hollow form due to his shinigami/hollow powers having a larger presence, but the flaming blades will be the influence of OMZ in his bankai."
bleach,35obw8,darthnick426,18,Tue May 12 05:59:35 2015 UTC,"I always thought that the hollow form he took when he fought Ulquiorra would have been his resurreccion.  Tosen had one as a Visored, so I just assumed Ichigo could have one too."
bleach,35obw8,Toahpt,15,Tue May 12 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"That is indeed possible but what we have to remember that Ichigo is a very specially case. Tousen was a Visored created by the Hogyoku. He was more or less a perfected version of Shinji's Visored group. As we know with Shinji's Visored, they simply have their own inner hollows which are completely separate entities from their zanpakutos. We can discern this from their zanpakuto's never changed from their previous forms prior to their hollowfication. For evidence there, we need only look at Kensei. His zanpakuto functions the same now as it did as he was a captain 100 years ago.   Now for Tousen we can assume he was created in a similar manner. His inner hollow was created as a separate entity from his zanpakuto since this was of course the method that Aizen was familiar with, plus the fact that Tousen's zanpakuto already had a present and established zanpakuto spirit after years of building a rapport with Tousen. As such they began as two separate powers. Two separate souls distinct from one another. Aizen had to compress the hollow powers of Tousen's inner hollow into his sword the same way he does with arrancars. Which means he is essentially making an arrancar out of Tousen's inner hollow. Arrancar don't have a zanpakuto spirit. It is just their own power. Their own form compressed into a blade. His inner hollow, since it was combined with shinigami powers and compressed into the blade, then would then have it's own true form or resurrecion established at this point as it is put into Tousen's zanpakuto. His inner hollow's name would then be Suzumushi Hyakushiki: Grillar Grillo, the name of his resurreccion.  Again though we have to remember, Suzumushi already had a soul as a zanpakuto. It already has an established true form but now so does his inner hollow. This means that there are two separate souls. Two separate entities inside of Tousen's Zanpakuto, both SuzumUshi (His shinigami powers) and Suzumushi Hyakushiki: Grillar Grillo (His inner hollow) Tousen most likely has two different souls in his zanpakuto.  Now Ichigo on the other had is a much different case. He isn't the same kind of Visored as they are. He didn't have an established zanpakuto spirit and a separate inner hollow. They are the same being. Zangetsu (Hollow Ichigo) has always been his zanpakuto spirit. Zangetsu himself originated from White and then merged with Ichigo's powers to become one soul, Zangetsu. Back then, when Ichigo first used that hollow form on Ulquiorra, there was only one Zangetsu. There was no other separate soul that could be a resurrection. One soul in command of his shinigami powers that was constantly being suppressed by OMZ. One soul in his Zanpakuto itself. Zangetsu(Hollow Ichigo) was both his Shikai and Bankai. Zangetsu's bankai was already his true form and as such didn't have a resurreccion or arrancar true form because his bankai was already it.  In short, I believe that Tousen had two separate souls in his zanpakuto (Suzumushi and Suzumushi Hyakushiki: Grillar Grillo). Thus allowing for shikai and bankai (Suzumushi's true form), and resurreccion (Suzumushi Hyakushiki: Grillar Grillo, the inner hollow's true form). Ichigo on the other hand had only one Zanpakuto spirit, Zangetsu who's true form is his bankai.  Granted this is just a theory. Aizen may very well have just hollowfied Tousen's zanpakuto spirit himself and reached the same result thus making him like Ichigo. So you could indeed be right."
bleach,35obw8,darthnick426,2,Tue May 12 07:22:36 2015 UTC,"What is a ressureccion though? I'd say its the release of sealed hollow powers, rather than a final form of sorts.  We've seen such a phenomenon happen with each vizard, when the seal is broken by the hollow taking over the vizards body, and transforming it. In this respect, I would consider hollows big/white/tailed form to be his ressureccion.  While sure, zangetsu is at the top of his shinigami strength while in bankai, the hollow aspects are not addressed as hollow powers are:   a mask, and a (user) shape change   neither of which happens to ichigo in bankai, nor any of the other vizards. Instead, they have a monstrous, masked form where the hollow is released -- a ressureccion if I ever saw one. Despite the obvious mask and shape, there's another similarity between tosen's named resureccion and the these alternate ""hollow"" forms: personality change. Like the others, tosen becomes much more hollow-like in his actions while in resureccion, though he maintains ascendence.  I imagine that the rest of the vizards could, by befriending/accepting/training with their hollow, learn to have similar control over their hollow form/resureccion. Tosen obviously had the help of the hogyoukou.  I could imagine that the inner hollow needs to become an arrancar though. That would be a bit weird, since we've seen hichigo treat his mask like a vizard would, rather than having it stuck on.  On the topic of ichigo, we've seen home with two different hollow forms, one much more powerful than the other. If the first one was his resureccion, then it would make sense for the second to be his segunda etapa: perfect for fighting against Ulquiorra's."
bleach,35obw8,eightNote,8,Tue May 12 08:36:46 2015 UTC,"I could imagine that the inner hollow needs to become an arrancar though. That would be a bit weird, since we've seen hichigo treat his mask like a vizard would, rather than having it stuck on.   Using Ichigo as a litmus test for anything is a trap that we all fall into, because he's the one who, mechanically, we know the most about.  Ichigo is similar to a Vizard, but not exactly the same.  The Vizard are the result of inserting a Hollow into an existing Shinigami/Zanpakuto relationship.  Hichigo/Zangetsu is a Hollow Zanpakuto spirit - and has been since the very beginning.  OMZ's suppression has also, until very recently, been responsible for Hichigo/Zangetsu's Hollow-dominant personality.  It'll be interesting to see if NewHichigo (a fresh imprint on a ""proper"" Asauchi, unsuppressed by OMZ) has any personality differences from the Hichigo we've seen before.  What we do know of the Vizard is that they have soulscapes (where they subjugate their Hollows), and that during that subjugation, they experience external encroachment (as they were prepared for with Ichigo).  Those with Bankai are still able to use them, but none have used them while masked.  We don't have an explanation for that yet - and we may never get one, since we appear to be beyond that in the plot now.  I agree that what we saw of Vizard-Tousen is a pointer to how the other Vizard could evolve, given enough time, training, and maybe a little bit of ""help"" from Urahara.  But, having been re-accepted by SS, they seem reticent to use their Hollow powers.  (Well, aside from Mashiro, but she was following orders)  We still don't know quite why that is, and with most of them out of commission, we may not find out.  Again, the plot appears to have moved beyond them.  They're present, they ""fight"", but they're not the main event anymore.  Best I think we can hope for is a bankai from Shinji at some point."

We know nothing else about the War Potential's upgrades since learning about their status as such. At the very least, they'll be able to take out the Elites, whether it's the Quincy Elite or Royal Guard and make the goal a little easier. At first, they were likely ""high priority targets"", ones who would be easy to coerce to defecting (Aizen), easily manipulated (Ichigo), or otherwise too dangerous to leave alive to mature and power up (Kenpachi, though all three fit the bill). We've seen that Yhwach's ability isn't complete (didn't foresee Mimihagi's interference), and it wasn't even active when he dubbed them the War Potentials, so it's possible they could have a greater impact than Yhwach initially thought.

Kenpachi wants to fight, sure, but he's also proven he is an ally.  If he really only cared about fighting the strongest opponents, whoever they were, then the other captains have always been around.  As far as Aizen goes, I don't think Shunsui would risk utilizing him if he didn't firmly believe two things: Aizen's and Yhwach's plans are so diametrically opposed to one another that Aizen can be trusted at least to stand against Yhwach and (2) Aizen was never really the villain he made himself to be.

Aizen could potentially fake join him, but Yhwach should really see through that.  Though it wouldn't be surprising if becoming the Soul King significantly changed him, and it's not as if villains don't often make dumb decisions once they've decided they cannot be defeated.  Really hard to guess before we know what Yhwach's deal is right now.  For all we know he only managed to ""free"" the Soul King by absorbing him and is now going to be a enemy to the Quincy too, so maybe we just get the Royal Guard plus Yhwach fully reviving and commanding the dead from Yama's Bankai.  There's clearly something up with Haschwald, and Uryu will never intentionally be a villain (other than perhaps in a ""this is what we need to do"" way), so Yhwach is kind of lacking in strong allies even with the Royal Guard.  But Yhwach has always had the ability to give people powers, so Royal Guard plus his remaining Quincy allies could easily be individually strong enough that it doesn't matter that we have five times as many ""good guys"" to fight them.  I can't see Kenpachi joining him because Kenpachi can always fight strong people if he wants - he doesn't have to do it when existence is on the line, unless he's tricked in some way.

I'm not sure if it's necessary, though, since we haven't fully seen what they can do.  He probably will give them power in some way, if they join him, but it might depend on how long Kubo wants to drag out the fights.  We could get full showings from each Royal Guard while they fight with different characters simultaneously, then have them ""on the ropes"" before Yhwach gives them his own Soul King aspect/Quincy power up to give them the upper hand again.  Kubo likes slight design changes because he likes making interesting clothing designs so much, so that would be right up his alley, as seen with the Fullbringers."

He may ally for the moment that he needs to get through the... Others in his way, but, Aizen is not a #2... Ever.  In addition, Uryu showed us doubt. Doubt. He hesitated. He had some disappointment.  Yhwach had morale, dedication, and true belief on his side - now, he does not.  That said, I still have questions regarding why Yhwach has acted the way he has - the blood war happened for a reason and it implies supreme guilt on the part of the Gotei.

Yhwach is what we know as a ""Mechanical Villain"" it means that we don't know much about him, he's just there to do bad things to give our hero a reason to act. It's almost never used for main antagonists and most likely it will change once his backstory gets explore. But, at the very moment of today, he's just bad. There's simply nothing about him. Yeah, he looks cool and he has had some nice presentation but he doesn't even say much. Absolutely no redeeming qualities for an end-game villain of the final arc."

Do we only count ""big bads?""  Yhwach certainly isn't as enjoyable as Aizen's ridiculousness, but he probably can't stand up against some of the more colorful and evil villains from other manga.  And if we're counting one-time villains, then most villain-rivals-turned-allies in any series are better than Yhwach. (though that lessens a bit if we count ""Zangetsu"" scenes as Yhwach's, and it's not really fair since it's comparing a semi-mysterious villain to protagonists with lots of panel time)"
bleach,35o45b,BlueVelvet90,3,Wed May 13 01:12:18 2015 UTC,"Well, nobody in Bleach at their absolute meanest can take out even the nicest, least-douchey Berserk villain. The DBZ-verse had villains who blew up planets and slaughtered hundreds of trillions for funsies! Naruto's villains were varying in their extremity, but they're around the level of Yhwach, at least. One Piece's pre-timeskip villains (not counting guys like the World Government or guys the SHP haven't directly fought yet) are arguably weaker, save for a few of the Captains."

But his introduction was initially nice and him having to kill his subordinates makes sense since he's given them part of his power; rather than doing it ""for the evulz"" their death, while pointless, still benefit himself and other Sternritter since her can redistribute the power.

The letters are a piece of his soul. So further explanation would be nice but really we saw who he is and what he wants, we saw his motionless childhood. All the Sternritter represent an emotion given to them by Yhwach. Could be the reason why Yhwach acts like a tyrant. His only remaining emotion is the A. The desire to kill and surpass the kill. As he takes that energy back when they die he regains emotion and power.   That and Yamamoto fighting him was the coolest thing I have ever seen/read."

Outside of that, I guess Stark is the only confirmed natural arrancar."

bleach,35iyzu,HomelessBoxBoy,12,Sun May 10 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"The skull is his mask. Its a sign of his evolutionary advancement. Vasto Lorde are the most humanoid of all hollows and you can't get more humanoid than a skull for a mask. Thats why he was the King, he was the pinnacle of hollow evolution and probably the oldest most powerful in their original hollow forms."
bleach,35iyzu,JakabBigShow64,5,Sun May 10 21:54:30 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that Barragan is a naturally forming arrancar.  His state in the flashback is far to identical to his release form.
bleach,35iyzu,69username69,11,Mon May 11 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"Harribel's form as a Vasto Lorde is entirely an anime fabrication. There is no confirmation on whether that was her actual form or not before she was turned into an arrancar.  I don't think Barragan is a natural arrancar because he still has his mask when we see him in the flashbacks of when Aizen defeated and subjugated him. His mask is his skull. Had he been a natural arrancar, he would have looked the same as he does when we are first introduced to him, as an old man with white hair. When he released his zanpakutou, he returned to his original form, a Hollow with a skull.  Ulquiorra is a different story as we do not know for certain how he became an arrancar. I'm inclined to think he may be a natural arrancar who was in the process of removing his mask because of that white bush before Aizen came along and helped speed up his transformation."
bleach,35iyzu,acesilver1,1 point,Sun May 10 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"I've got a strange feeling that if Barragan had indeed evolved into a natural Arrancar, he would probably detest that he looked more like human or a Shinigami. He would probably have found a way to take on his skeletal appearance to still maintain his Hollow-appearance.  I actually found it very telling that Aizen mocked Barrgan by telling him: ""With that black cloak, you resemble a Shinigami more than a Hollow."" I always found that hilarious, and it could have been a hint that Barrgan may have actually evolved into something more human like over the course of his life. Giving him a more ""human"" form could have been one of the many things Aizen did to rub being subjugated in Barrgan's face.   Everything from me is totally baseless speculation lol. :D"

bleach,35iyzu,Saayem,3,Mon May 11 11:39:20 2015 UTC,"Vasto Lorde and Arrancars are two different things. Vastolorde are the highest class of Menos there is, Menos being a congregate of multiple Hollows. So a Vasto Lorde is to a standard Hollow what a Captain is to a shinigami, a higher form of a given class of being, but perhaps even higher as far as power gap is concerned. Vasto Lorde were hyped to be stronger than shinigami captains during the Arrancar arc (and they somewhat have lived up to the hype, though in a rather disappointing fashion in my opinion)  Arrancars on the other hand are Hollows/Shinigami hybrids, the kind where you turn Hollows into a shinigami (as opposed to Vizards or Ichigo being shinigami turned into Hollows). So technically a Vasto Lorde can totally be stronger than an Arrancar if you're considering an Arrancar that originates from a low-class Hollow.  Ulquiorra apparently became an Arrancar by walking into a huge ""quartz-tree"" bush that inhabits Hueco Mundo, during a chapter that was released for a Data Book (Masked was it?). I say ""apparently"" because natural Arrancar-isation is a bit of an unclear process but we definetely see his mask being scratched away."

Either every Espada banned from releasing his blade was a Vasto Lorde or none of them have been.   Baraggan was in theory too big, Vasto Lorde have been described as ""human like in size"", while even his human form was that of a giant.   Ulquiorra had a very similar backstory to Starrk, essentially he was just less powerful, so if we say that he was a Vasto Lorde, Starrk had to be as well.   I guess only Tier Harribel is widely accepted as a Vasto Lorde. Presonally I think that before Starrk split himself in two, he was more than a Vasto Lorde or at the very verge of evolving. He may have some sort of connection to either the Soul King, or the missing link between shiningami and hollows."

bleach,35jywt,CptSprinkles5,36,Mon May 11 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely an intentional plot hole since Kubo actually had Mayuri explain that he simply remodels his Bankai. Mayuri all but says that it's possible for someone to fix their own Bankai, but they have to have the knowledge and skill to be able to do it themselves.  Mayuri was cut off before he could fix Ichigo's Bankai, and then Ichibe kept repeating to Ichigo that Reioukyuu has a super Reijutsu that can fix his Bankai, which Ichigo found suspicious. I think it was essentially a lie to make Ichigo go to the palace (along with taking his friends as a bargaining chip) because the Soul King wanted to meet him.  In other words, I think it's more like foreshadowing or an intentional misdirect than a plot hole."
bleach,35jywt,Andygoesrawr,3,Mon May 11 02:47:00 2015 UTC,well it was probably also to get ichigo to go and get a proper asuchi since he didn't have one before

And the bankai wasn't exactly the same in hueco mundo. It had different poison, at the very least.  If you wanna know if he planned that far ahead count the blades on renji's shikai before and after his fight with byakuya (I don't know if it works out or not, but it should according to this rule)."

This broken bankai things is definetely a total plot hole that was put there solely to provide a reason for Ichigo going up the Soul King Palace.   It would have been waaaay smoother if Kubo didn't mention Renji's bankai because it really is the only one for which it is totally obvious that Kubo came up with this on the fly."

So much for Komamura being the only bankai who can repair damage."
bleach,35jywt,Rimefang,8,Mon May 11 04:09:00 2015 UTC,"I saw someone say the wings are not the bankai, but something he does, maybe subconsciously, whenever he uses bankai. That makes sense as to why it doesn't break anything whenever they are broken."
bleach,35jywt,Scourgal,9,Mon May 11 05:14:48 2015 UTC,"Daiguren Hyorinmaru's ""wings"" are just ice constructs.  They're not part of the blade's body.  I'd guess that if the blade itself were to be damaged, he'd be in trouble."
bleach,35jywt,yukeake,5,Mon May 11 13:49:17 2015 UTC,Maybe the only way to break Hitsugaya's bankai is to break his sword while it's in bankai.
bleach,35jywt,Zeta42,6,Mon May 11 07:10:32 2015 UTC,"After Ichigo's bankai was broken by Hashbrowns we learned that a broken bankai can never return to its true form, on its own, unless it's totally bonded like Komamura's. Otherwise, just use tech, or a master shinigami blacksmith."
bleach,35jywt,WhereIsMyMime,5,Mon May 11 04:45:51 2015 UTC,Well if I remember correctly Mayuri has also made his Zankpakuto self destruct. Maybe it was already broken before he was Captain and he just created a new one. Urahara did recruit him from the Maggots nest after all. There's no telling what his life was like before that.
bleach,35jywt,DaxLonghorn,3,Mon May 11 02:38:07 2015 UTC,As much as I love the Rogue Zanpakutou arc. It's technically not canon since it's an anime filler arc.

bleach,35j8ep,alwayspickthekatana,18,Sun May 10 22:20:53 2015 UTC,Well there were 200 canon episodes adapted from 479 chapters. That's ~2.4 chapters per episode. This arc is currently 146 chapters so that would be roughly 61 episodes.
bleach,35j8ep,Alluka-,11,Sun May 10 23:16:03 2015 UTC,Around a weekend's worth then.
bleach,35j8ep,rigaj,2,Mon May 11 05:58:53 2015 UTC,A weekends worth? For me that would be like 3 months worth. I wish I had that much time on my hands. :(
bleach,35j8ep,The_Hippocrite,0,Mon May 11 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"61 episodes at about 24 minutes per episode (though for ease of calculations, we'll do 20 minutes, then add on the 4 minutes per episode later) would be 1220 minutes (61 * 20) + 244 minutes (61 * 4) = 1464 minutes = 24 hours + 24 minutes (TIL a 24 minute anime lasts 24 hours with 60 episodes). Assuming that, as a college student without a need to study for class on Monday or work on the weekend, it can easily be done in a weekend. Even devoting 8 hours of free time, 8 hours of work, and 8 hours of sleep, a college student could still theoretically finish most of it in a weekend"
bleach,35j8ep,Tiresieas,2,Mon May 11 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not a college student, I'm an underwater welder in Texas,USA."
bleach,35j8ep,The_Hippocrite,1 point,Mon May 11 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't try to imply that you were, just a situation in which one would have the time to watch 24 hours and 24 minutes of anime over the course of one weekend"

bleach,35j8ep,shonryukku,6,Mon May 11 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"We have material for around 75 cannon anime episodes .  That's about 1 year and ~ 2 months of anime episodes , if they would release 1 episode per week."
bleach,35j8ep,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Sun May 10 22:52:58 2015 UTC,Seems like they should just go ahead and start it up again... if Kubo keeps up the .08 - 1 chapter per week pace that is~
bleach,35j8ep,Vlaid,3,Tue May 12 19:52:27 2015 UTC,Considering it will be the longest arc of Bleach it would be at least 125 episodes. If they added filler because they animate before it's finished it could go to 175-200+ episodes which is why I think it was cancelled to begin with. The popularity of the anime paired with the fact that they caught up meant that they would need more filler than people wanted.   If they wait another year or so and let the arc end you could start with a movie involving the Invasion of Soul Society followed by 50 or so episodes of the final arc.    sorry if they caught up to this point maybe 75 episodes.
bleach,35j8ep,Rocksbury,5,Sun May 10 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"Anime that adapts a weekly manga (~20 page chapters) tends to use anywhere from 2 to 4 chapters per episode (ie, for two, Shokugeki no Soma has been relatively consistent with 2 per episode thus far, while Jojo's Bizarre Adventure can go from 2-4.5 chapters, depending on the original content and how it translates to anime). Assuming the weekly releases remain (no breaks for either crew) and with a 3 chapter per episode limit (because of Kubo's use of talk no jutsu, combat, and space), we'd see the anime catch up to chapter 625 in about 48 episodes. That will then add 48 chapters, which adds 16 new episodes (64 episodes) and chapters, which in turn adds about 5 more episodes (69) and chapters, then, with the rounding done thus far, we get 2 more episodes (71) before the crew runs out of groupings of 3 to adapt. And that's only under perfect conditions."
bleach,35j8ep,Tiresieas,2,Mon May 11 02:03:09 2015 UTC,Depends on how many of the off-screen battles are animated. And how much they pad/cut things. It could be anywhere from 50-100.

Other words, her bankai can melt away at the flesh and the blood coming from her sword/ area can then be used to heal from the bone up.   Quite fitting since she did take up healing so that she can heal herself and others in order to fight for as long as possible.  eh, they had a much better and detailed theory."

Sort of like Kokuto in Bleach: Hell Verse but it's not too much of a stretch to imagine his villainous side from Kazuya Nakai's voice. Hisakawa's voice is very kind and sincere as Unohana, so seeing the polar opposite of that from her would be interesting indeed."

bleach,35gm47,zombykilr777,26,Sun May 10 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"Renji's 'old Bankai' was Hihio Zabimaru and it was not his 'true Bankai'.  What happened was his Zanpakuto neglected to tell Renji its real name which was Souou Zabimaru.  So during his fight with Mask it was revealed during a flashback that Ichibei told Renji the name of his true Bankai back at the Soul Palace.    Another example of something like Renji's situation is Yumichika.  His Zanpakuto Ruri'iro Kujaku doesn't fully form if Yumichika neglects to say its full name, but he does it on purpose unlike Renji.  It'll only sport 4 blades instead of releasing its Kido power if he says Fuji Kujaku."

bleach,35gm47,Crazyalbo,5,Sun May 10 10:05:13 2015 UTC,I think Yumichika's was something to do with colors. Something about his Zan had a favorite one (Ruri'iro) and didn't like the other (Fuji)... I think
bleach,35gm47,DaxLonghorn,1 point,Sun May 10 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"So this is the most obvious and if read on the the surface this is it.  But deep down I wonder if there is more?  Renji was sent to heal/power up.  And when ichibei names something that's what it is. He erased jewbacca's name and made him powerless what if after having his ass handed to him Renji could only get stronger with a ""new"" Bankai was to have it renamed?  Which in turn granted him new and stronger powers.  I don't know something I've been tossing around the ole noodle."
bleach,35gm47,jdonnel,18,Mon May 11 03:30:32 2015 UTC,Even his zanpakuto thought he was a jobber. Nuff said.
bleach,35gm47,reigun91,7,Sun May 10 09:58:20 2015 UTC,"His Zanpakuto is based on a mythical creature that it part snake and art baboon.  His Zanpakuto did not acknowledge him as a warrior before. So, it only told him part of his Bankai's name. It told him the name of the baboon half. In lieu of training with Zabimaru, Ichibei'i simply told Renji his Bankai's full name.  There's really not anything special about his Bankai. It's a melee type and all it can really do is shift between its baboon form and its snake form. The baboon part is the giant arm and the snake part is the blade on his right arm."

bleach,35fw0i,razerdoh,7,Sun May 10 08:50:12 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna be annoying or a party pooper but please, for the love of god, if there's a paid alternative to watching Bleach or any anime use it. Anime isn't really a highly profitable industry. So, long story short, if you enjoy anime and really want to see more chapters of a particular anime, or new anime, support the creators.  Same goes for manga. We all read the manga here on unofficial sites but it's really hard to get your hands on a chapter that's official, translated and with no delay. Completely understandable, I believe. But one option I'm sure many of us take advantage of is buying the volumes, and that's terrific.   To summarize, remember that even though the mangaka may be in this because they enjoy it, they can't publish something by themselves. The raison d'etre of this industry is profit. So, give them what they want so they give us what we want. (which in our case probably is a Bleach anime :D)"
bleach,35fw0i,gummychaos,-1,Sun May 10 04:41:58 2015 UTC,"I also recommend watchcartoononline.com, but only if you have an adblocker. They have a pretty good selection of anime and other cartoons but they've gotten a bit heavy on the ads."
bleach,35fupd,telecastic,10,Sat May 9 23:14:03 2015 UTC,"Plausible, yeah. But I don't think it's that likely. Allow me to make my case (this may get long, bear with me)...   If that's the case, then Urahara must have known that was going to happen which is unlikely (and that Ichigo was to be invited). He was surprised when the worlds started collapsing. The wisest choice would be to try to kill the enemy first, because then the SK wouldn't need a replacement. Besides, how would Urahara know the SK even could be replaced? Maybe Ywach could do it because of his abilities. Maybe he couldn't. We cannot know for certain as of now. It's too big of a gamble from Urahara's perspective. On top of that it's a shounen manga and you'd have to search a lot to find one where the mentor/master of the protagonist turns evil. The SK has shown absolutely no signs of really having a will. See what I wrote in another post link. Hyousube's words were the only time we've ever been hinted to something like the SK ever doing something. I think the Soul King really has no will, and he is more of a mechanism than anything else (read link, there's a reason which comes from the inspiration I assume Kubo had, which is the history of the Emperor of Japan). Now what does that mean? Well, that the ones who brought and wanted to bring Ichigo were the guys from the Royal Guard. Now this starts to pick up steam. If you read the chapter 517 (when the RG arrives at SS), you can see that Kyouraku, greets Hyosube with little confidence. And Kyouraku is the best in the Bleach universe when it comes to judging people's true intentions. If I put myself on the shoes of the guys from the Royal Guard, I'd say ""why don't we bring this guy -Ichigo- and, hopefully, he has the power to stop the enemy"". I'm from now on assuming the Royal Guard knows that Ywach can, in fact, absorb the Soul King (something that I assumed Urahara had no chance of knowing earlier on). i don't think this is too much of a stretch, since the Royal Guard probably has a lot of information on Ywach (the reasons are kinda obvious). If that is the case, they may have done this reasoning ""... and if he can't defeat them and Ywach absorbs the Soul King, we have him here and we can eliminate him and restore peace in the universe"". Remember now when Ichibei used that creepy smirk as Ichigo went to the Palace and said ""You cannot possibly win, human. But it doesn't matter, because that's what peace is all about"" ? Up to this point it makes a lot of sense, doesn't it ? One thing that always bothered me is how the Royal Guard sent Ichigo back to SS. I mean they MUST have known the path to the Palace would remain open. It's kind of stupid to send your winning card to another place when you know the door is completely open for the enemy to come. What if they sent him that way because they wanted Ywach to come? Besides, why haven't they appeared? They have the best healer available, and they're the strongest shinigami. How on earth were they defeated that easily? Summarizing everything, this turns into a theory that the bad guys in the shadows are in fact the guys from the Royal Guard. And that to some extent, even Ywach is part of their plan. One thing I put on the other post (link above) is a curiosity the history of Japan gives us. The Emperor appointed during the Sakoku (the peace that came after the Sengoku Jidai under the rule of the Shogun) a Council of Five Elders. The thing is he really didn't appoint them. The Emperor had no real power. He was a slave of the political tides. Therefore, the Council controlled him completely. Does it ring a bell? Now if you would indulge me, how many members are there in the Royal Guard? 5, right? ;)   I know this turned out long, sorry for that. There are many things I have on my mind that I didn't put, so there are parts of this theory that might be incomplete. If you find any errors, incoherences or simply want to critique or comment, I'll be paying attention to this post. Please do so if you like.  Oh and a small note, I verified the things I said about chapter 517 using the raw version in Japanese."

But remember Hyousube got his head literally ripped off and came back as if nothing had happened.  Besides it's a shounen manga, not Game of Thrones. Characters usually don't die. And when they do it's usually flashy enough for us to realize it."
bleach,35fupd,gummychaos,1 point,Sun May 10 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"That has been my opinion of Urahara that he was grooming Ichigo to replace the SK; while Aizen was grooming Ichigo for his power. Though, I think the SK's interest in Ichigo might also mean that the SK has found his replacement."
bleach,35fupd,Seri55,1 point,Sun May 10 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"The SK was only immobile and mute after all this shit went down. Before that, the SK sent the royal guard down to pickup Ichigo and some others, and they mentioned that the SK had a very special interest in Ichigo. We also saw all his limbs intact the first time he was introduced. So really, it doesn't seem at all like he was immobile or any of that shit, people keep forgetting he's the one that made a special request to get Ichigo, and has his own periods of being awake and asleep and all that. And AFAIK Urahara never wanted to replace the SK, he was trying to protect him and stop the bad guys from the beginning. He was scared and shocked as shit when the worlds started collapsing, he didn't plan for that."

bleach,35glhq,Tiresieas,2,Sun May 10 04:46:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just one of those things Kubo wants to keep very mysterious, and always meant to use it more, like how he meant to do other things he never got around to. Hopefully he's still saving it for its special moment."
bleach,35glhq,gummychaos,2,Sun May 10 04:56:30 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I don't think so. It's completely unrelated to the present plot, and besides there's a movie that centers in Hell. So, even though it'd be nice, I don't really think it's going to happen. You also have to consider this is the last arc, and that if you were to put Hell in the equation the manga would have to drag on for a considerably longer time."
bleach,35glhq,gummychaos,2,Sun May 10 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"Or Hell could just remain canonically mysterious for the remainder of this series, and just make its small appearance when it's time for it to be relevant. I mean look at all the characters we got that never got their stories all fleshed out either. Hell should be mostly unknown anyway since it's pretty much a one-way stop for everyone. I highly doubt Central 46 or the RG ever had a mission to go to Hell and settle someone down like Goku and Piccolo 2 did with Cell and the other dudes, so it's not like anyone would really know much about it other than when they witness evil Hollows getting sucked in.  Bach does seem to be purely evil. Doesn't matter what new world he wants to create, he's trying to create it by force, slaughtering and using people along the way, and doesn't care about the well-being of any of them. The Sternritter and Arrancar are just misguided people, well except a lot of the Sternritter did seem to be pretty evil, even though some of them were ""good"" before Bach came in to their lives."

Even in that case, the episode when they go to hell is a filler. And probably because of the same reasons that make such an episode or arc about hell in Bleach unlikely. Just like /u/EspadaPrimera said, it's too much of a stretch.  Now I'm not saying it's impossible. In fact I think it'd be fun to watch, but my opinion is I don't think it's going to happen."

This was an ancient post, so forgive me if some of the informations seems outdated   Here's one insanely retarded batshit crazy theory  Yhwach was the first Fullbringer. He's a Fullbringer on a higher level. A super ultra mega advanced Fullbringer. Ginjou was his first protege  Think about it. Ginjou's ability is kind of similar to Yhwach. The ability to distribute powers. The difference is, Ginjou need steal those powers first while Yhwach already has them and only need to carve part of his soul onto others to distribute them. Why did Ginjou acted on his own and killed hundreds of Shinigami just to steal their powers? To become stronger? Ok. To become stronger for what? To get his revenge on Soul Society for not telling him about the purpose of the Substitute Shinigami badge? That's all? Nah, I don't think so. There must be a better reason than that. Maybe he was working for Yhwach and is actually older than we thought  Quincy were created by a super ultra mega advanced Fullbringer, Yhwach. What's the difference between Fullbringer and Quincy abilities anyway? Fullbringer manipulate the souls contained within matter and Quincy manipulate reishi. Their method are kind of similar in my opinion  Like I said before, this is just one insanely retarded batshit crazy theory.

Fairy Tail Ice Trail  Fairy Tail Zero  (For those wondering)
bleach,35dr9v,aizen6,1 point,Sat May 9 10:58:55 2015 UTC,"That's because Kubo is a master troll; he can't go around revealing what Urahara's true intentions are now, can he?   Plus, we already have some backstory from TBTP."
bleach,35dr9v,HazelnutPi,1 point,Sat May 9 12:43:10 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't his mom have had to be a Quincy for him to be a hybrid? And be attacked by a hollow before Urahara was born to be a Fullbringer?  Of course, this doesn't mean that he cannot be the villain in the end. I think his motives might be very different, probably not associated with power but something else."
bleach,35dr9v,HazelnutPi,1 point,Sat May 9 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"This idea is great, and plausible, but the reasoning is highly truncated, to the point where you're almost countering yourself. If Kisuke wanted to make Ichigo a perfect hybrid being, then he was on the right path (the Quincy bit seems like a stretch.) But Ginjou...just because he has a bankai and can hollowify doesn't really mean squat. Kisuke didn't make the viziards, yet we've seen Shinji perform Cero. As a former captain, this also means that he has bankai. Soo...nice theory."

Now that we see yhwach actually absorbing the soul king I'm sure of it. Just imagine how badass that scene will be when everyone is face to face against each other. Elite sternritter + uryuu and royal guard lined up with yhwach in front of them vs the Shinigami + Arrancar + aizen + fullbringers + remaining sternritter that turned all lined up with Ichigo in the front, damn that would look so badass"

I can understand why they'd be relaxed. Not to mention their boss is absorbing the Soul King.   It's tough to say, but I see Uryuu and Ichigo fighting."
bleach,35bs58,Aaroniero,7,Fri May 8 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"Well, this might be long. First, i want to set up the ""players"" (who is alive, who was never defo killed, etc): Quincies:    Sternritters: Juha Bach, Jugram, Ishida, Askin Nakk Le Vaar, Pernidas, Gerard and Lille. ""Traitors"": Bazz-B (Best quincy), Giselle and Lilloto.   Shinigamis:   Soul Society: Kyouraku, Nanao, Ukitake, Rukia, Soi Fong, Omaeda, Shinji, Hinamori, Byakuya, Renji, Hisagi, Kenpachi, Ikkaku, Yumichika, Mayuri, Nemu, Aizen Royal Guard: Ichibei, rest unknown   Others: * Arrancars: Grimmjow, Nel   Ryoukas: Ichigo, Sado, Orihime, Yoruichi, Urahara, Ganju Vaizards: Hiyori, Love, Hacchi, Lisa Fullbringers: Riruka, Yukio Unknown/Uncorfirmed: BG9, Cang Du, Candice, Meninas, Shaz Domino, Kira, Zombies, Mashiro, Starrk (a man can fanboy), Yachiru, Ginjou, Tsukushima, British Hulk   This leaves a vast possibilty of upcoming battles. I followed to whole ""Juha Bach's will absorb the Soul King"" theory. From Ichibei's final quote before he went into the eternal screentime waiting, pointed towards Bach's not being necessary a treat he had to finish. ""This all there is for the so called-peace"" points towards acceptence, so i could see (just like everyone else) the Royal Guard being revived only to align with him. This add a total number of 11 underlings for Bach (10 if you count out Ishida).  As of now, we have 3 ""squads"": the quincies, Kyouraku's Team and Ichigo's team. The quincies have at least 7 ""players"", at best 12. Kyouraku's team has a total of 25 ""players"" with 3 quincies, 7 captains, 2 trolls, 4 Vaizards (i'm counting Shinji as a captain), 7 lieutenant (being atleast half fodder worth) and the 11th squad duo (fodder unless Bankai). Ichigo's Squad has 9 individuals but appart from Ichigo, Yoruichi and plot-kai, fanbase's King Grimmjow the rest  are wildcards who may not be helpful at all (Please, don't dissapoint me Nel-sama).  I'll assume Ichigo, Grimmjow and co. will arrive AFTER Kyouraku's team crosses the portal but Bach will have finished absorving the soul king BEFORE they arrive, making the RG their enemy. The possible match-ups would probally be:   Shinji, Hiyori, Hinamori vs Hikifune. This won't be an actual battle, since both sides don't have a thing against each other. Soi Fong, Omaeda vs Kirinji. Soi Fong's ""pride"" was messed with, and she will take this chance. Omaeda will just follow for being his underling and maybe someone else like Lisa will aiding them. This battle will most likely be utter defeat, before Yoruichi (or Urahara) decides to step up. Kenpachi vs Oetsu. Both are strong, with Kenpachi lust for battles most likely leading him straight for some top dog. If he does not fight a Quincy, this is HIS enemy. Mayuri vs Senjumaru. She messed with his toys, he'll try messing with her. Bazz-B, Giselle, Lillotto vs Other Quincies. They don't give a fuck about the shinigamis, their goal is Bach's head. And since the RG will probally be busy trying to stop the others, they will probally sneak into the palace. Most likely fights? Bazz-B vs Jugram is possible, Giselle is unpredictable as fuck (thats what makes him/her/it so cute/awesome/creepy).    I believe the ones that do not fight the RG (if the RG is involved) will move foward. I don't think Ichibei will involve himself early on, atleast not directly but when he does Aizen or Urahara will be involved. I think the RG won't ""lose"" but might retreat under order from Ichibei, only time will tell. Moving past it, Kyouraku and Ukitake will most likely tag team eventually if the later is not dead but i think they will have their individual fights before moving foward. For ""part 2"". i think it will go:   Ichigo and maybe Nakamas vs Ishida. Just to change his mind. Shinji vs Lille: Something that can't be stopped? Something that will not change its direction? A troll Shikai (or please god a troll Bankai) can do the trick.  Urahara, Mayuri or Aizen vs Askin Nakk Le Vaar. Askin screams for a troll battle. We shall have one. I honestly hope Mayuri is not relevant here tough. Jugram Haschwalth vs fodder: he will bring balance to the battlefield. If you're injured, he will finish you off. Bazz-B will be defeated and Jugram will go rampage. Maybe Ichigo will fight him.   Nor Pernidas, nor Gerard gave me a big impression. Kubo likes to match fights based on personality (as seen on the arrancar and fullbringers arc) so i can't really match anyone for them. Gerard vs Kenpachi is the closest i have in mind, but we have no idea how powerful Batman is. Grimmjow will arrive later with the others so might act like ""the hero"" defeating someone who was probally about to defeat/kill someone but who is a rather hard prediction for me. Same for Nel and the Vaizards. I could see the quincies (Bazz-B, Gigi and Lilotto) double crossing the shinigamis but that is for Kubo's insane mind to decide. May the plot twist ruin my long prediction."
bleach,35bs58,Fred_MK,8,Sat May 9 03:59:24 2015 UTC,"Grimmjow fights everyone.....and wins.  Serious answer now. I assume the royal guard and the elite quincies will all be split up among all of the captains, renegade quincy, Ichigo's group, and anyone else who shows up.  I don't know how every match up is going to go but I would assume there will be some definite match ups. For instance:  Hiyori + others vs Hikifune  Mayuri, Giselle, and their corpse squads I could see fighting either Askin or Senjumaru Shutara  I really REALLY want a team up fight consisting of Grimmjow, Renji, and Bazz-B vs someone. Probably Valkyrie.   I would also love more than anything for there to be an Ichigo/Grimmjow team up battle as well so I'm torn....if they do team up it will be to fight Ishida I think. Rukia, Chad and Orihime will probably help fight Ishida as well. Renji probably as well....but I'm not sure Ishida could take that many people on at once...  Byakuya and Kenpachi I want to fight Oetsu. The person who brought Byakuya's zanpakuto to his current broken potential battling against Byakuya and Kenpachi, the man who rejected zanpakutos for so long. There's some kind of poetic elegance to this match up. I can't help but want it.  Shinji and/or Ukitake are definitely going to fight Lille I think. Who better to fight against an attack that can't be blocked? The guy who can fuck up where you're shooting and the guy who can shoot your attack back at you.  Sui-Feng and is definitely going to fight Tenjiro. Yoruichi might join this fight but something tells me she might want some payback on Pernidas.  Kyoraku is probably going to fight Hashbrowns.  Aizen and/or Urahara will probably have to take Ichibei. No one else could probably handle him.  The possibilities are really endless. I look forward to seeing how the fights will match up."

Unless you have the power to grant yourself power like Yhwach or you are on another level and his powers cant affect you. Which could be Aizen if he really is the most OP character in the series.   I think Yhwach is going to do some crazy shit in the next couple chapters that really changes the landscape/characters that can be involved in the fight. I'm hoping for a Berserk type moment in Bleach where all these characters meet and are excited and think they stand a chance and Boom, Yhwach descends from the palace with his undead army (Yama) and his endless flow of Souls (SK) and just wipes the floor with half the characters in Bleach thinning out the series so that the final 75 chapters are more like a desperate struggle to survive rather than a fight to save the world."
bleach,35bs58,Rocksbury,1 point,Sun May 10 18:15:20 2015 UTC,Shunsui will be killed by Bazz B. His character has connections with the Oni or Troll.  If Kubo follows the Poetic rule then he will die by fire.   Which follows my theory of a sudden change of circumstances.  To many things have gone right considering the Quincy have already invaded and killed the King. They won. The world is now theirs and we keep thinking there is still a fight to be had.   It will be an extermination and the remaining Quincy like Ichigo are bound by blood to remove the Shinigami.

bleach,35aat2,assertiveguy,11,Fri May 8 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"Iirc its only Shikai that weights ""as much as a feather"". Unreleased and Bankai are not affected by this logic."
bleach,35aat2,RenkiDenki,5,Fri May 8 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"Well... that makes sense, but if we assume this as the explanation, that means that preety much any other lieutenant could neutralize Kira's zan ability, provided that they had a shikai. It wouldn't be necessary to have an ability akin to Mastumoto's or Byakuya's. Suddenly, Kira's zan would start too look not that badass for me...  And, more importantly, if the logic doesn't applies to the bankai release, than Gin would have a very hard time using his bankai. Same thing for Ikkaku, Renji, and even Hitsugaya (ice is heavy)."
bleach,35aat2,Spikecaster,5,Fri May 8 14:46:14 2015 UTC,"Thing is enemy weapons not only thing can Kira doubles weight, if Kira's zan hits your arm then your arm weight doubles. Like Kira vs Avirama fight. He won't be too disadvantaged against Shikai's. (i think)"
bleach,35aat2,RenkiDenki,4,Fri May 8 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"That's only if he's able to touch the opponent with his blade, though. In a regular swordfight, this is quite a feat, and if he was able to touch the opponent's body multiple times with his blade, than his zan's ability would be irrelevant. A regular sword would do the trick just as well. The great advantage of Wabisuke's ability is precisely the damage it can cause without touching the opponent's body (taking him by surprise)."
bleach,35aat2,RenkiDenki,3,Fri May 8 15:10:44 2015 UTC,Well not necessarily. It only feels like the weight of a feather for the shinigami. The weapons seem to very much have a weight despite the usual physics problems.
bleach,35aat2,RenkiDenki,3,Fri May 8 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Not arguing with that. They indeed have mass (just look at what happens whenever Renji's bankai hits something - it crushes or break it, just like you would expect of something that huge being tossed around like a whip), but the shinigami is not affected by it. But that doesn't solve the question: regardless of the actual weight, the shinigami wouldn't be affected by it, not even if Kira's ability augmented it.  The only explanation would be that Kira's zan cancels that rule, and once touched by his blade, the zanpakuto's actual weight starts to affect its wielder. The problem is that this was never clearly stated anywhere (not that I remember).   But, in the end, I guess this is implied."
bleach,35aat2,Dynamex,5,Fri May 8 15:39:55 2015 UTC,I'd Wager its more figurative than them literally feeling no weapon weight. I mean they get used to that exact sword with those exact dimensions. To them it feels as light as a feather because it is them and their style. If you add unnecessary weight like Kira does you push them over a limit they would never ever experience in a normal situation.  Kubo does that thing a lot where uses idioms and figurative explanations and makes them sound like rules.
bleach,35aat2,RenkiDenki,2,Fri May 8 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"mmm, yeah, perhaps translation could be a problem here. But, in this interview, the explanation about the zan's wheight doesn't seem as figurative:   SJ: How can Ichigo swing a sword that looks heavier than he is? Is he secretly working out at home?  TK: Well, no. To begin with, a zanpaku-tou isn't something you'd swing with your muscles. Ichigo's zanpaku-tou comes from inside him, so he wouldn't find it heavy. If Ichigo tried to wield Renji's zanpaku-tou, Zabimaru, he'd find it heavy.   SJ: So it depends on the person?  TK: Yes. Zabimaru looks pretty heavy, too. Ichigo wouldn't be able to wield him. Renji would probably find the same thing with Ichigo's Zanpakutō, Zangetsu.    Mind you that in any moment he makes a statement about the bankai form not obeying this ""rule""."
bleach,35aat2,Dynamex,2,Fri May 8 18:01:56 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense since its their swords fueling them with power and to an extend muscle strength. When Holding someone elses power they dont have that support.
bleach,35aat2,Direktorman,3,Fri May 8 18:43:55 2015 UTC,Really? I mean did you see Ikakkus bankai? I dont think its possible to carry that without having some bs feather magic.
bleach,35aat2,c9IceCream,2,Fri May 8 22:14:48 2015 UTC,People in Bleach are silly strong. Ikakku is one of those who relies heavily on muscle strength and Popped his own shoulder in with only muscle strength. I think he can carry that.
bleach,35aat2,Rocksbury,1 point,Sat May 9 07:27:07 2015 UTC,fair point actually.
bleach,35aat2,Rocksbury,10,Sat May 9 12:23:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the only explanation I see is that they're not completely weightless, they just feel really, really light but they do have some weight. So then Kira would have to strike it more times, but he would still be doubling the weight, however small it may be.  Edit: I don't know much about physics but it may be important to note that Wabisuke increases the weight, i.e. the gravitational pull, instead of the actual mass of an object. So maybe, however light the zanpakuto may usually feel to its wielder, there is just this massive force pulling it down."
bleach,35aat2,Rocksbury,2,Fri May 8 14:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess you are right. A little bit of weight would be necessary for the shinigami to know precisely what he's doing with the blade.   The thing about gravitational pull being different from mass seems like a good explanation too (though I don't know much about physics, either)."
bleach,35aat2,Rocksbury,5,Fri May 8 15:13:59 2015 UTC,fair question. I think anyone who hadn't thought about this topic would assume they weight the same as any normal sword we'd find in RL.  Your points are good and we also have to consider isshin vs grandfisher and isshin explaining that captains/shinigami can control the size of their zan's or else they'd be the size of a skyscraper... A sword that big would be immensely heavy too if we use real world logic so I'm going to assume the weight is manipulated too.
bleach,35aat2,yukeake,3,Fri May 8 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the source of the information, IIRC. That chapter when Isshin fought against grandfisher, I mean."
bleach,35aat2,Narissis,3,Fri May 8 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"Even if you had a 1 pound blade exponential growth is frightening.  2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 Doubling the weight even at a low number would alter the use of the blade.   Gin couldnt make his blade a mile long and swing it, he swings a short sword that becomes large instantly so momentum keeps it moving and by the time the weight kicks in its back to standard size."
bleach,35aat2,Narissis,3,Fri May 8 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"Gin couldnt make his blade a mile long and swing it, he swings a short sword that becomes large instantly so momentum keeps it moving and by the time the weight kicks in its back to standard size.   Yeah, that works when he's using the bankai on a straight trajectory. But, in his fight with Ichigo, he makes transversal trajectories too (he cuts whole buildings in half, horizontally). In that kind of movement, I believe that the momentum would actually work against him, since he is dramatically altering the previous trajectory, and at tremendous speed. I don't think that it would work so well if his zan had actual weight.  On a side note: only now I realised how much of a broken combo Gin and Kira would be if they fought together: 'Here, let me drop this 128x heavier than normal 10 kilometers metal blade over your head...'"
bleach,35aat2,Narissis,2,Fri May 8 15:49:50 2015 UTC,"A 1 pound sword can be swung, at that instant the sword is now a mile and it's weight is increased. after it cuts the building which takes fractions of seconds it returns to being 1 pound. Gin never notices the weight change because technically the weight only influenced what it hit not the swing or return.   The sword does have a weight and it could be heavy as a standard sword and extremely (Tonnes) heavy in release. The benefit to using his blade is the speed of the transaction. You dont need to use X amount of force to swing a 1000 pound blade because when he swings it weighs the same as it did at standard size, if someone was to block it and stop it from reverting Gin couldn't hold his own blade."
bleach,35aat2,Narissis,2,Fri May 8 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok, I get it now, he could swing it before it grows.   But how does that applies to Renji's bankai? It's quite heavy too, but it's length is constant, and the speed definetly not as great..."
bleach,35aat2,DRoyLinker,2,Fri May 8 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"His is interesting because its not all connected.  He uses the Hilt and Energy to manipulate the sword. When he swings his sword forward the hilt creates forward momentum which forces all the pieces of the puzzle to move accordingly.   His new Bankai is another story, the old Bankai would of been difficult to maneuver because of the way it moves not the weight of it (which would of been extremely heavy) The current technique is a tether to the sword and his new arm."

bleach,359tip,ruetero,4,Fri May 8 16:16:32 2015 UTC,Explanation
bleach,359tip,jameslee85,2,Fri May 8 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"It isn't that all detectable reiatsu is denied entrance to the palace, it's the fact that the enemies won't be able to detect, and therefore not react, to their arrival. They are using a sealed dimension with special reishi that rends them invisible (via the 6th sense every spiritually gifted character has anyway) to the enemies. Basically it's a big deal that theyre undetectable NEXT chapter, not now.  It was transported through the Garganta because ALL of the Valleys exist in the Garganta. I think the nail she drove into the ground, due to the design on the head, allows a Garganta to be opened in places it otherwise shouldn't be possible. This fixes the ""Why didn't Aizen just go to the palace with a Garganta?"" problem. It seems that they aren't going to take the Box back into the Garganta, but rather they're going to simply fly back up inside the Box. This also makes sense if you consider the fact that a Garganta appearing in a convenient location inside the Palace itself would not only be VERY visible, but loud as well.  tl;dr Valley was already in Garganta, nail made it possible to open Garganta in Royal Realm. Valley's stealth matters later for a surprise attack, not just now when it arrived."
bleach,359tip,tyler7988569,1 point,Fri May 8 09:28:27 2015 UTC,"I'm still not following. Yeah all valleys exist in the garganta, but what does it have to do with being able to actually open up a garganta in the soul palace? I can understand them being able to travel within a valley of screams due to the fullbringer powers, but I still dont see how they can just open up a garganta in the soul king dimension. It's supposed to be a place that is highly protected, so you're telling me they do not have any protections against other dimensions opening up in their dimension? I mean I can understand aizen not being able to do this because lets say you need to travel within the valley of screams to be able to get to the soul palace which aizen could not do, they did it now because of the fullbringer powers, but actually entering the place? Speaking about this situation in a different way,it's like, Aizen never had the transportation to do this, nor than entry requirement. Right now they did have the transportation via the valley of screams but they still should need some sort of access to be able to enter the soul king dimension. The way this logic I see now it's like, the soul king dimension is an open dimension with the difficulty of finding your transportation/path towards it but if you can do that, hey, enter it for free, is that the case here?"
bleach,359tip,ruetero,1 point,Fri May 8 09:44:22 2015 UTC,"It is only possible because they gained access earlier and then Yoruichi placed a stake. The Valley of screams just makes it possible to travel undetected with the box. Where the box goes is a different matter entirely and dependent on the locations where a stake exists. Were the one on the royal guard territory to be destroyed, where they currently are, they wouldn't have a way of getting back to the palace."
bleach,359tip,tyler7988569,1 point,Fri May 8 10:32:56 2015 UTC,I still answered that in my essay of a post. I think the nail that Yoruichi drove into the ground allows the Garganta to form there. It has a symbol that looks like a closed Garganta on it; she even says that she is using it as a landmark for their transportation.
bleach,359j1s,twilot_spankle,5,Fri May 8 06:09:56 2015 UTC,Is there any reason they would also not be Shinigami-Quincy hybrids? They're Ichigo's siblings after all...  If only Rukia had Fujikujaku. Then she could have given powers to all three of them.

Unless the ending of Bleach is completely closed there might be a window for the Karin storyline as the next thing from Kubo, given he won't finish his career or go do more zombie powder.  I was actually kinda upset when it turned out that the fullbring arc is about Ichigo and not Karin, especially since the very first chapter/episode starts with ""Karin has now the strongest reiatsu affinity in the family"" or something along those lines."
bleach,35948m,smward998,7,Fri May 8 03:23:50 2015 UTC,Yes. I wish all the characters in the human world had more relevance in the story.

bleach,35948m,reigun91,3,Fri May 8 05:14:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there's no place for her to fit.  Based on what we've seen of her, she'd most likely be a powerhouse/brawler type.  We already have Chad (for what little Kubo finds for him to do) and Yoruichi for that.  Adding a third doesn't add much in the way of variety.  As a love interest, she's essentially the third choice, running behind Rukia and Orihime, even though she and Ichigo share more of a past (and a relationship between the two would seem more believable).  So, that makes us ask, what's her role in the group?  What can she bring to the table others don't?  And I can't see an opening that isn't already filled by one of the many, many other characters.  I agree that she, Keigo, and Mizuro were heavily hinted at as being important - and I'm rather disappointed that they basically got pushed to the background, and reduced to ""Ichigo's human friends"".  But, I also can't see a good way to fit them in with the ensemble cast as it is, without them looking like ""lite"" versions of other characters."
bleach,35948m,yukeake,3,Fri May 8 17:56:19 2015 UTC,She deserved more of a spot than any of the other human characters besides Chad. It's a shame. She could've been a badass bruiser of the team.

I genuinely think Kubo has set up some sexual tension between the two if not just the fact that they've been so close since such a young age with such similar personalities and how important they are to one another. I just think they'd really work and there's foundation for it in past chapters.

Ichigo definitely likes her, though, even if he doesn't admit it - even Orihime sensed that way back in chapter 213 (probably didn't help stifle her urge to just take off).

bleach,355ha0,shiba_keikaku,160,Thu May 7 07:23:26 2015 UTC,Not surprising he's so blunt after countless collisions with the ground.
bleach,355ha0,semimorrell,18,Thu May 7 07:33:22 2015 UTC,That's a Krillin joke if I ever heard one.
bleach,355ha0,darthnick426,25,Thu May 7 16:47:50 2015 UTC,I laughed at this harder than I should have.
bleach,355ha0,ShiitakeTheMushroom,12,Thu May 7 08:38:28 2015 UTC,I don't really understand what Chad is talking about. Could you explain?
bleach,355ha0,Zanhana,43,Thu May 7 13:21:06 2015 UTC,"Chad is saying that Urahara is usually a pretty good guy, so the bracelet is so Nel can fight in her adult form, and not for fanservice, don't worry Orihime, I'm sure...pretty sure...that's why he'd make it..."
bleach,355ha0,ShiitakeTheMushroom,16,Thu May 7 14:37:57 2015 UTC,So Chad may actually be using some sarcasm? That's adorable.
bleach,355ha0,Sleepytimer,69,Thu May 7 14:54:03 2015 UTC,"The Power to control space at his own will with only electricity   Now that you mention it, Yukio's power is pretty OP, how did he job to Hitsugaya."
bleach,355ha0,Kritigri,71,Thu May 7 07:32:35 2015 UTC,Remember in the Fullbring arc when he hit the fast-forward button so that Ichigo's training ended up only taking 90 minutes when they were in there for days? He can bend space and time. Like what the fuck.
bleach,355ha0,Korrasch,68,Thu May 7 10:02:51 2015 UTC,Kubo isn't very good at giving people powers that aren't irrationally powerful.
bleach,355ha0,CptAustus,51,Thu May 7 10:28:51 2015 UTC,But it works out in the end since everyone is irrationally powerful except for Chad.

bleach,355ha0,HaveAnUpgoat,27,Thu May 7 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"He's like Gremmy, powerful but really overconfident and lacking in experience. They have one-track minds and can easily be led astray (Hitsu tricked  Yukio into getting hit by his own monsters, Gremmy focused so much on becoming like Kenpachi that his body tore itself apart)"
bleach,355ha0,CrimsonRex,115,Thu May 7 08:32:49 2015 UTC,"Kyougoku means ""Valley of Screams"". It was mentioned in the Memories of Nobody movie...  I don't think this canonises the movie though. I'd say Kubo gave them the term for them to use as the setting of the movie.  I'm glad Garganta has been confirmed as the name of the void. It was never clear whether that referred to the void or just a general name for portals that open into the void."
bleach,355ha0,DeusExMachina810,45,Thu May 7 07:37:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks alot, all I can see now is Senna walking behind Nel and Grimmjow with a confused expression saying 'Wait what, I'm canon now?! And alive?'."

bleach,355ha0,29thspirit,12,Thu May 7 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"Wait. This is confusing. So, Garganta is the name of the void, portal or both?"
bleach,355ha0,EspadaPrimera,49,Thu May 7 09:08:57 2015 UTC,"Garganta is the void. There are different types of portals, but the one used by the Arrancars is called Descorrer. The one used by Shinigami is called Keikaigi, and the one used by Menos is called Kuumon.  The wiki currently lists Garganta as being individual pathways created between the worlds using those techniques. This is incorrect. The Garganta is the massive void between the worlds.  That's why Hollows are able to use Descorrer to enter the human realm, Hueco Mundo, the Dangai, and Soul Society. They all exist within the Garganta."
bleach,355ha0,GreyouTT,9,Thu May 7 09:16:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for explaining this! I've been wondering how Ulquiorra managed to enter the Dangai through a Descorrer when he abducted Orihime...
bleach,355ha0,cerealfalcon,10,Thu May 7 09:33:16 2015 UTC,It'd be cool if that movie was canon though.
bleach,355ha0,keikun17,20,Thu May 7 08:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah but canonising one movie (Memories of Nobody) while openly condemning another one (Hell Verse) is a dangerous game for Kubo to be playing. People will start claiming that Bounts are real.  We do know that he has at least a small role in the movies, so I can definitely see him having given them a small amount of information and left the rest. So far Kubo's explanation of the Kyougoku doesn't entirely match up with the one in the movie. For example, it's clearly said and shown that there's more than one of them, and that none of them make contact with both the human realm and Soul Society. The premise of the movie is that there is a single Kyougoku that touches the two separate realms and serves to bridge them."

I say this knowing that some people might say ""what if he has a segunda etapa""... even then.  Remember everybody: Ichigo has to fight Bach, he's gonna need to be stronger than that (and he will be). I mean, the guy's powers are all merged and unrestrained now.

bleach,356r78,MrSterlock,17,Thu May 7 15:57:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmm well yeah, in fact I think the bigger question behind all this is one that's been discussed hundreds of times, and that is what were Aizen's real intentions?  Now I don't believe it was something they knew that no one else did. In the TBTP arc it was hinted that knowledge about anything related to the Soul King is scarce. Only a handful of people know about him (or the Royal Task Force or, as I said, things related to it), but there are others.  What I think is key (and I'm assuming Kubo drew inspiration from Japanese history, in particular you can read about the ""Sengoku Jidai"" (戦国時代) on wikipedia) is that the Soul King is a completely passive, marginalized (he lives in another dimension) and sort of ceremonial figure. He holds no real power, yet he stands above everyone else.  It has time and time again been said that pride is behind Aizen's actions. I disagree. Pride in Japanese culture is considered something positive. In fact in a Bleach volume (don't ask me which, I don't really remember) in one of those little poems Kubo does at the first page it says something like ""Any one time we throw away pride we take a step closer to becoming beasts."" Since pride is a really ""wide"" emotion, people without pride have nothing to hold them back, they just live their lives pursuing their own selfish, ""cold"" and objective goals. Which I think describes Aizen rather well.  So, having said something about the Soul King and something about Aizen's character and deepest motives... I think it's because he was being honest with Urahara. To find out about the existence of power beyond imagination was the reason that made Aizen start planning what he eventually did. He sought to search for someone more powerful than him, and by doing that to find an equal. And if that's your quest what better than to aim at the guy that holds the ""ultimate"" power in the universe?. And that guy is just a figure, a ""statue"". Aizen says what he says probably because he just can't understand that someone as smart or smarter than him hasn't reached the same conclusion: why should you be happy with how things are? If there's power available for taking, why not take it? why bind yourself to rules that aren't there? (and I think that's why Urahara mentions that the Soul King is a ""linchpin"", unlike the Emperor in Sengoku Jidai's Japan, a literal linchpin that mantains the dimensions together and keeps the souls flowing between them)"
bleach,356r78,gummychaos,5,Thu May 7 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you say.  Also back when he entered the Garganta on the Execution Hill he said something to the effect of ""No one has stood on throne of heaven yet"" which at the time seemed kind of just an arrogant thing, implying he would be the first.  I think now that he was referring to the fact that while you may think that the Soul King sitson the throne, it might as well be vacant, and that is whathe wanted to correct with himself most likely."
bleach,356r78,LucciDVergo,3,Thu May 7 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about that same phrase. And I agree 100% with your interpretation. Aizen sees himself as some sort of ""transcendent being""... and if that's the case, to his eyes, who better suited to sit at the top than him?"
bleach,356r78,gummychaos,2,Thu May 7 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"Also Kubos quote on Aizen; ""The gaze into the sun..."""
bleach,356r78,H4xolotl,2,Fri May 8 03:31:27 2015 UTC,"I completely forgot about that one, you're right. And in fact it's very interesting. The Emperor of Japan is called Tennou (天皇) which means something like King of the Heavens, or Heavenly Sovereign. And even better, the Emperor of Japan in their mythology is said to be a direct descendant of the goddess of the sun, Amaterasu. Then, that direct relation between the sun -or the heavens if you prefer- probably gives more ground to that assumption that I made (that Kubo inspired himself, at least in part, with the Emperor himself and with the views the people had on the Emperor during the Sengoku Jidai).  Now, the Emperor was never killed (spoiler) but the history behind the Sengoku Jidai might just be a good source for hints and theories.  In fact there was a ""council of five regents"" nominally apointed by the Emperor, but since the emperor was a de facto slave of the political forces they really weren't nominated by him. And moreover, they controlled him completely. What's the point of all that? Well.... it could very well support the theory that the ones controlling the strings from the dark are, in fact, the guys from the Royal Task Force or Zero Division (or someone else we're not familiarized with so far)."

bleach,356r78,H4xolotl,3,Thu May 7 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"Well the funny thing is that almost everyone he fought ended up not being dead. It could just be Kubo being Kubo, with these individuals somehow surviving a near death experience. Though, it could also be Aizen was holding back, not wanting to not kill these former comrades. All he wanted was to complete his goal, which he believes is right. I think Aizen has a very good reason for doing the things he did."
bleach,356r78,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,1 point,Thu May 7 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Thats interesting when he mentions the destruction of worlds as being a theory of the vanquished on page 22, Aizen is assuming that the destruction of worlds is not fate and can be changed by the person who removes the Soul King.  Which is exactly what we have, the worlds are not collapsing as Yhwach has decided to allow things to stay the way they are. Even going as far as saying he will consume everything the Soul King governs.   It has been mentioned that the Soul King was created by the Shinigami so my theory is that the Quincy ruled things just fine. A bunch of killers show up and power changes hands, The end of this war results in the creation of the Lynchpin and the destruction of the Quincy as well as the formation of the Gotei 13.   Urahara must have been summed to the palace before he was thrown out of Soul Society for meddling with the Hogyoku/Hollow creation. Which is interesting as the Hogyoku does not create Quincy or Shinigami powers and it doesn't look to break barriers it enhances the Hollow abilities of an individual.   I also think that Aizen built a roof over Hueco Mundo for the sole purpose of hiding from the Soul Kings not to make barrigan depressed. Why bother doing that if you have complete control? By the way when Yhwach mentions being the son of the King I get the feeling that Hollows are the perfect being in bleach and in achieving ultimate power the empty part of their soul was what gave the Quincy life. Literally the will or soul of the same being that controls the world.  The Shinigami are some sort of exception to this maybe being the Kings personal creation using his own life force rather than the missing element of himself which is why Shinigami and Hollow are close while Quincy/hollow are opposites."

It's a pretty arbitrary system that only the Shinagami benefit from (they make the laws)  Without said boundaries, everyone will live with each other.   Sure, there'll be chaos and lotsa of people will die, but who really knows what'll happen?  It could be like Korra opening the spirit world to the, thus allowing the sprirts and people to live with each other.  With immense power, Aizen can pretty much enforce his rule in that new world.

What Kisuke was doing was casting the Kido ""Keikaigi"" to open up the Garganta.   ""My right hand is the stone that bridges worlds."" Mimihagi is the acting right hand of the Soul King and stabilized the worlds.  ""My left hand is the blade that binds reality."" I think this could refer to Kisuke himself but it's a bit of a stretch with no factual evidence.  ""The black haired shepherd is hung from a chair."" Aizen?

bleach,354u3f,pngwn,6,Thu May 7 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"Making a jump here, but he says ""...I strike down the ibis"". (From Wikipedia) Ibis is the plural form of ibises, a type of bird that was revered in ancient times and associated with Thoth. Thoth is responsible for writing, mathematics, measurement and time as well as the moon and magic. The moon. As in, Ichigo. And his zan, the Moon Slayer.   I think it refers to Aizen only if he attempts to take the throne/mantle. Otherwise, this would be solely reserved for the Soul King.  I'm liking this connection.  I also wonder if the 'ibis' would be the black mouth things coming out of Yhwach. Or maybe that the reference to ibis is about the Shinigami/Quincy."
bleach,354u3f,inoneear_outtheother,7,Thu May 7 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"I did a bit of research and I think that the shepherd could possibly be Bach and not Aizen as well. It's a bit rough since we don't have all the pieces of the puzzle but I think it could work. (or I might just sound insane)  Okay this might be a bit of a stretch but here it goes.  From brief researching I've found out in Christianity it's usually the Right Hand that is mentioned more often than the Left because the idea of a 2 armed/2 handed God is unheard of. While this is usually the case, the Left hand is still mentioned occasionally.   The Right Hand is said to be the good while the Left Hand is said to be the bad. (Good and Bad sides of God, so to speak)  Here is part of the story of sheep and goats as told by Jesus:  “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.  He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.   If you were to dissect this and relate it to the story right now, Bach can be seen as sitting on the throne in heavenly glory because he has obtained the power of the Soul King. All of his Angels are the Sternritter. The nations before him - Arrancar, Human, Quincy, Shinigami.  This is all I've got so far. I used this for reference if anyone wants to take a look. http://rejoicinglifeministries.com/Hand%20of%20God.htm  edit: Okay so, taking a further look at this website. ""The left hand of God is manifested through a people who are in the kingdom of darkness. The right hand of God is likewise revealed through a people, the Sons of the Kingdom.""  Now I'm not too sure about the Sons of the Kingdom part and relating it to Mimihagi but the interesting part is the Left Hand section. So let's look at this quote: ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places""   Could this be related to the Zero Division in any way? Just think of Ichibe's power."

bleach,354u3f,Humble_Shopkeeper,1 point,Thu May 7 23:01:15 2015 UTC,I would agree that the black-haired shepherd is more representative to Juha versus Aizen. Then Aizen would be the blade in the left that binds reality (KS).

bleach,354u3f,Seri55,9,Thu May 7 12:07:34 2015 UTC,"This is what I did on the limbs..disregard the missing panel..  Recently we learned that Ukitake was embodied with Mimihagi-Sama; the right arm of the SK. It has been mentioned by -----that chapter 617 disproved the concept of any other bodily parts belonging to the 5 SWPs. Suppose these individuals that houses the SK’s limbs are his SWPs; or the fact that Juhabach doesn’t know everything as he claimed to know about the SWPs. We will have to await future chapters to determine if any of this could possibly be true; and for discussion purposes the former versus the latter will be discussed.  The Left Hand of God Meaning  The Latin meaning for left-handed means “sinister.” Frequently, the left side stands in opposition to the right. It is often assumed that the right hand is stronger and more proficient than the left hand also. In addition, the left hand is sometimes perceived as eccentric, undesirable, and antisocial. In Buddhism the right hand leads to Nirvana; while the left hand is to be rejected.  Implications  The left hand of God acts as a wrestling partner in order to augment (increase) endurance and strength, character, and wisdom. The left hand of God is shown through individuals who are in the realm of darkness. This might be paralleled to in the panel where Ukitake is questioning Aizen before he left for HM.  This is kind of like, the right hand is questioning what the left hand is doing. However, this is not implying that Aizen is the left hand of the SK. And no more than saying that Juhabach could also be considered as the left hand of the SK. We know both men harbors hatred for the SK; and both can also be considered sons of the SK-at least we know that Juhabach is the son of the SK. The question is, with him being the son of the SK, is he also the left hand of the SK as to why he’s considered the son? If he is the son and the left hand of the SK; could this be the very reason why he hates the SK; as the left hand represents being rejected?  More Characteristics of the Left Hand  The length of God’s arm is like the length of this world to another one. We can see from the following panel in chapter 617 how far the right arm of the SK reaches:  However, the width of God’s arm is the width of this world, but it’s difficult to determine if the width correlates to that of the Seireitei. In addition, the radiance of God’s arms is like the splendor of the sun in the season of Tammuz. Though this is nestled in Judaism, I found it interesting as the sun relates to Aizen. Interestingly, in Buddhism the left hand path is represented by a female wisdom deity that depicts meditation on emptiness or wisdom.  Final Thoughts  Speaking of limbs of the SK that happens to be four; I wonder if it parallels to the 4 encounters of Transcendence. We know that the East Rukongai District produced Mimihagi-Sama; will the other districts produce more Gods as well? Also the number 4 seems to be relevant to the SK in that he have four eyes, and he is missing four limbs. In addition, if his limbs are from the four districts of Rukongai; then it is also relevant here as well. Last, in Buddhism the number 4 is a sacred number and whose name means “four-maple-institution?” None other than Yoruichi Shihoin."

Y'know what... it's already raining down in Seireitei, ever since Juha, Haschwalth and Ishida went up to the Soul King Palace (since Chapter 587).  Edit: Also, note that it's not raining in the Soul King Palace at all. If this incantation could be an pointer to what is going to happen, maybe it will only happen in Seireitei where it is raining?    ""strike down the ibis""    bird imagery of Ibis could be a reference to Shiba Clan member(s). Kuukaku, Ganju and Kaien have ""birds"" as their given name. Oh fuck no. ""Strike down""? Please let that not mean what I think it means. Please let it only refer to Ichigo being struck down from the Soul King Palace, and not the demise of the Shiba Clan.   Such a good find, TC. It made me think... can you imagine: the incantation for every single Kidou could have a significance to the story, or have a history attached to it? And that their history could only repeat itself?

Renji's fake bankai? Those teeth were and still are broken. In Byakuya's case, he has so many rose petals that it's hard to notice, but if you take a closer look, you'll see damaged rose petals.

bleach,356ei8,Aethos,1 point,Fri May 8 01:39:45 2015 UTC,so this goes for non normal healing wounds correct?

Sorry andy still not quite understanding this.
bleach,356ei8,Andygoesrawr,1 point,Thu May 7 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure. That depends on if the guns are part of the main body of his Resurreccion or if they're an additional piece like Nnoitra's weapons.  Usually it's easy to tell since the part of the Resurreccion that resembles white armour is the main part, but with Starrk he doesn't have any white armour chunks like Harribel.  The only part we can count for sure is his mask fragment."
bleach,356ei8,Aethos,1 point,Fri May 8 00:15:58 2015 UTC,Thanks Andy! I assumed it was a bit different for him since Lilynette is a big part of his guns. So if she dies like she did in the Anime he would lose access to her and thus his guns would lose potency. Maybe? Idk..

I feel like they've been around and visible enough that if they were war powers they would have been called out on it. That makes me think the war powers are people we have yet to see, ie grimmjow, parents of Ichigo and Uryuu, MAYBE. a full ringer, perhaps another to be seen arrancar or something.  It would really amplify grim jows entrance and value of returning in the manga, otherwise there would be no value except fan value of having him here."
bleach,356lxk,aizen6,2,Thu May 7 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"It could always be that the other war powers are not revealed at all; that would go hand in hand with not knowing Sternritters K, N and Shaz Domino right up to the end of the series. Not to mention Pernida Paerjfhskhsljkhskas' face. But it wouldn't make sense to do so because the concept is something Yhwach himself, the Almighty, came up with.  It would be great if our Grimmkitty is a war power, but there seems to be a lot of competition, and we have more all-round people like Kyouraku, Ukitake (??), Urahara, Isshin, Ryuuken, Uryuu, Mayuri etc.  I wouldn't be surprised if Hashbrowns was a war power either."

bleach,356lxk,aizen6,2,Thu May 7 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"Well, Yamamoto was not a war power because Yhwach thought he was mentally weak. Kenpachi was because he could wreck havoc without even knowing his Zanpakutou's name. Ichigo because of his multi-species nature (or plotkai, whichever people prefer). Aizen-taichou because... he's Aizen-taichou.  Kyouraku's Bankai can be expected to be one badass power. It's been hyped for a decade. So is Urahara's.

Grim is even in the current chapter weaker than Nel. Both are weaker than Halibel even with Urahara going to hueco mundo.  People need to get real with Grim he is not some OP character never was. replace Ichigo with Byakuya and Grim still loses. Not current Byakuya either. He took down that eye ball hollow and he was 1 number below grim.  Scariest part is that Yammy was the strongest...Remember that, thats canon so when talking power levels only Ulquiorra in full release could beat yammy so Grim is still 6th on the list, hes far below a lot of captains but he provides a means of stopping vollständig . Unless they use the Reshi multiplier on a Hollow the only was you can boost their power is by consuming souls."

If you think Grim would of been able to defeat all the Arrancar above him or any of the Captains who managed to defeat higher level Espada then why did Kubo give Espada numbers?   It wasn't like power levels in Dragonball which was to show you not to judge a book by its cover. The Espada had been ranked because they had fought constantly and had been graded by their power level. True Ichigo pushed Grim to a point he had never been but that doesn't mean he consumed more souls and managed to become more powerful. He didn't have the strongest Skin, Didn't have the strongest Cero, Wasn't the fastest, Didn't have the most advantageous powers or release.   If people are able to clearly explain why they think hes stronger and not just Ichigo had a hard time then m open to debate but it's clear even Nel in the current chapter is stronger than Grim. Which means there are still Quincy stronger than both of them and still Captains who could beat them. This all goes out the window once we know for a fact that their power has been altered."
bleach,356lxk,Edge_Walkr,-2,Fri May 8 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"I don't k ow why on earth you think nel is stronger currently that is absurd. Second I think for the same reason Ichigo was able to bullshit his way through many wins. Nobody can tell me ichigo should have been stronger than byakuya or kenpachi the first time they fought but they both lost, due to plot. Grim  would not just come back as ichigo's ""rival"" as part of the plot only to be as useless as before. Furhtermore we all have seen the way people get stronger in bleach. Couple days in soul kings palace and boom 10x stronger. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw similar for grimmjow. Finally grimmjow ripped through stern rotter j like nothing. Sure maybe he was weakened or whatever , but I think kubo showed us that panel as a hint to just how strong grim has become. One slash from his sword 1 shot stern j, a feat maybe only kenpachi achieved to this point , and quiljie opie seemed to be pretty damn strong. Bear in mind it's been a bunch of years and in bleach time loads has happened, tons of people received power ups, look at rukia. Got a bankai strong enough to kill as nodt, from previously being shit. When they first met grim raped Ichigo and 1 shot rukia. Just watch he will come back as a war power."
bleach,356lxk,Terfmop,1 point,Fri May 8 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"Currently there is no evidence to prove Grims strength. I admit that can change but Sternritter J was not only Corrupted by Hollow essence he had been fighting multiple opponents and unless he was an elite sternritter would have been destroyed with collateral damage, Grim prevented that by eliminating him with a surprise attack on a weak opponent. In no way does that prove he has strength beyond the current characters in the Arc.  http://www.mangapanda.com/bleach/625/8  Proves the Grim has either not increased beyond the power of his number (Not to say they all stayed the same) or has not challenged those who had been stronger than him proving that he is not stronger than the other Espada unless something changes.   The fact is Ichigo is one of three characters at God Level. Aizen, Ichigo and Yhwach. If you think Grim is at Ichigos level do you assume he could also fight Aizen? What about Yhwach?  It's nonsense, he was brought in to either eliminate the Sternritter or Zero Squad and Im guessing because the Hollow advantage over Quincy Release I would say with the assistance of the Visored Shinigami Grim will help in the war effort to destroy the remaining Elite Quincy.   Why would the Number 6 Espada suddenly become stronger than 5 other Espada, the creator of them and the man who destroyed the creator PLUS a being that can consume God. I love Grim, I wear my 6 Necklace all the time but it would be illogical to assume he received such a power up."

Also Kenpachi but my thought doesn't really apply to him as well except for maybe the whole ""He just want to fight the strongest around, if he wants to fight strong souls reapers instead of us why not?"" idea, but hey it makes since for 2 out of the known three."

bleach,353iv4,SyanWilmont,1 point,Thu May 7 17:32:08 2015 UTC,These comments came before this week's revelations. We had only seen the dead Fullbringers this ark.
bleach,353iv4,HaveAnUpgoat,1 point,Thu May 7 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"What?  Why do people keep saying the ""dead"" fullbringers?? Yukio and Riruka both survived and were released after Ginjo was defeated.  That's the only 2 we have seen so far."
bleach,353iv4,KristophGavin,1 point,Fri May 8 04:19:05 2015 UTC,"That is distinctly false. We have just now seen them. Previously, nearer the start of this ark, we saw Ginjo, Giriko, and Tsukishima. They are the ones who were sensibly in SS due to their deaths."

bleach,353iv4,sunshinecid,4,Wed May 6 22:27:02 2015 UTC,Yes they were all shown during the quincy arc.  One of them looking back and saying something and then all of them walking off to do something seemingly important. So yes I'm 100% sure of fullbringer involvement.

I've read hundreds of mangas and watched hundreds of anime and I've formed my taste for these types of entertainment and I can tell you that Bleach is one of my favourites. Also, I stopped reading Bleach years ago probably after Lost Substitute Shinigami Arc and returned to it like 5 months ago. What made me come back to Bleach was plot, true story. Really, I like it. But what holds me back is, 40% Bleach, 60% /r/Bleach and awesome people here."
bleach,357r0r,a_real_Monkey,3,Thu May 7 20:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I read it because I enjoy this series. Why else would I wait every single week for a new chapter to come out? Then, after reading said chapter, come on to the forum and discuss it with others? You may not enjoy it, and that is fine. The real question is this: Why the fuck are you here bitching about a series that you think is ""so fucking bad""?"
bleach,357r0r,reigun91,3,Thu May 7 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"Let me put it this way. The only day I have no trouble waking up at 6am is Thursday, and I usually do it with a smile on my face and my phone on my hand to read the new chapter as soon as possible.   I love everything about it. And I know not everybody does... I mean, and not only manga, it's impossible that everyone likes something since we're all different. But I feel that if Kubo thought about something like a ""target audience"" when he started writing Bleach, I'm right in the middle of it  :D"
bleach,357r0r,gummychaos,2,Thu May 7 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it. Ofc, there's ups and downs but i still enjoy it. I read Naruto, One Piece and Gintama but none of them gives me excitement like Bleach does (Not everytime,tho). I think i will enjoy it to it's last chapter"

Bleach is super slow chapter by chapter as a matter of fact the anime used anywhere between 2 and 3 manga chapters per episode(around 15min of animation) , if you would wait for chapters to release and read it monthly you would enjoy Bleach 20 octillion times more/better"
bleach,357r0r,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Thu May 7 20:55:59 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that was the case for me until I read this...  Honestly I skim through the weekly chapter in about 20 seconds to see if something actually happens
bleach,357r0r,yumSalmon,1 point,Thu May 7 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"It's been a rough read as of late. Like most of us, it's been a long investment in this series, and it's been more weak chapters than strong ones lately. Can't give up on it b/c it's given so much greatness and too much time invested, just hope kubo ramps things up soon to reward us for a lot of the sub par issues."

bleach,35366r,anerdscreativity,1 point,Wed May 6 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"Ugh, the ""Headless Star"" series of chapters was one of the worst in recent memory, in my opinion. Chapter after chapter of Kubo at his worst: blatant Ichigo-worshipping filled with dozen of blank panels to that took up nothing but space. But to be fair all of those chapters could probably be condensed into one anime episode because of how little actually happens in them, so it'll probably be less egregious if/when it's animated.  For the record, I did like Ichigo and Kenpachi's interaction as a nice callback to the Hueco Mundo arc."

bleach,35366r,Keranu,1 point,Thu May 7 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"It definitely kicked off the worst stretch of chapters of the arc, in my opinion. Ichigo came all the way from the Soul Palace, only to turn right back around. There was rampant off-screening and the zombie business started off cool but quickly turned into a mess. It got better once the attention shifted to the Royal Guard and the Soul Palace, and I think it's relatively good since the battle between Yhwach and Ichibe."

bleach,353ojo,reigun91,2,Wed May 6 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"so it increases his fighting potential, right? well thanks"
bleach,353ojo,Jedy_hacker,3,Wed May 6 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen Ichigo's abilities , barely this arc he has become a shinigami .   We will probably have a training arc(most likely , inner world training) in which he unlocks some .  Getsuga Tenshou is not part of Zangetsu's abilities , Ichigo learned it from OMZ. Furthermore Urahara can shoot an unnamed Getsuga Tenshou and Isshin can shoot a named GT aswell"
bleach,353ojo,Alluka-,5,Wed May 6 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm not sure if it was actually confirmed anywhere but GT is basically the Shinigami equivalent to Cero.   Not too sure about Shikai and correct me if I'm wrong, but the only ability we know of that Ichigo receives from his Bankai is speed."
bleach,353ojo,Jedy_hacker,3,Wed May 6 22:24:03 2015 UTC,"Speed , durability , strength etc are all increased when going Bankai cause of a larger reiatsu pool. I think all shinigami benefit that way from their bankai , it was stated sometime that when a shinigami goes bankai they become x3 or x5 times stronger  In Ichigo's case that multiplier could be x7 or x10 times(who knows) cause he's a Shiba , thus explaining his overwhelming speed / power etc so not even that can be considered as a ""special unique ability"" gained by going Shikai / bankai"
bleach,353ojo,Alluka-,3,Wed May 6 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"thats kinda funny, that means he gets the raw bonuses from bankai/shikai and nothing more, but he is still as op as he is"
bleach,353ojo,Andygoesrawr,3,Wed May 6 23:08:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so quick to jump to conclusions. We simply don't know what abilities his Zanpakuto may have to offer. Only time will tell.
bleach,353ojo,Jedy_hacker,2,Wed May 6 23:36:17 2015 UTC,"Getsuga Tenshou is a Zanpakutou ability. Ichigo didn't learn Getsuga Tenshou from anyone, it just came naturally to him. Black Getsuga, on the other hand, was taught to him by Zangetsu. Getsuga is the core of his abilities and represents the entire theme of his Zanpakutou.  Urahara has shown the ability to replicate even the abilities of other races, so it makes sense for him to be able to replicate Getsuga Tenshou."

bleach,353ojo,anerdscreativity,1 point,Thu May 7 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"It's Nake, but Nake also produces Chikasumi no Tate so it's just a technique that releases a bunch of energy. Urahara can do what he wants with it.  So I'd say he's imitating Getsuga Tenshou."
bleach,353ojo,Jedy_hacker,1 point,Thu May 7 01:58:08 2015 UTC,"Nah, Getsuga Tenshou is definitely part of Zangetsu's moves, but OMZ taught him the name of the move and how it activates/is used  Also, you might be confusing Urahara's GT-like moves with this or this"
bleach,353ojo,anerdscreativity,2,Thu May 7 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"in any case it's not ""unique"" to Ichigo since Isshin has pulled a GT aswel with his normal Zan"
bleach,353ojo,Starrk10,5,Thu May 7 01:51:52 2015 UTC,"I think that has something to do with the bloodline since Ichigo has ""Zangetsu"" and Isshin has ""Engetsu"""

However, Kubo really messed up, and makes her a clingy damsel in distress, as opposed to someone who can be quite useful. My thought has always been this: Kubo gives her a power that is beyond OP, so he tears her down in order to build her up. Or, at least get to the point where we can see why she does have such a hax power."
bleach,353fqo,reigun91,5,Wed May 6 20:56:04 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree about the thing about the way she acted in the Hueco Mundo bit. She promised herself that she wouldn't rely/depend on anyone too much because she wanted to stand up her own. But when Ichigo was basically dead, all she did was call for him to save her. It speaks alot about her misconception about Ichigo's character. And the way she felt afraid of his mask rather than try to think of what seems to be the cause of this. Plus Nel has to bring  Orihime back to her senses why Ichigo was fighting. To need a third party to spell it out for her, I think her feelings are just an infatuation built around misconception."

bleach,351p04,renlytargaryen,4,Wed May 6 12:06:46 2015 UTC,"""Everybody gets a bankai"" is not a new sentiment among this fandom and seemed to really gain traction when Ikkaku was revealed to have one. Kubo is partially to blame for hyping it up so much when it was first introduced, but I think people are forgetting that lieutenants are still the cream of the crop when it comes to shinigami, second only to the captains. There are thousands of shinigami in the Gotei 13, and assuming all the lieutenants can bankai that means around 30 or so seated officers have the ability to do so. That's still an extremely small margin of shinigami who can bankai, it just seems like a lot because we know all of them."
bleach,351p04,LucciDVergo,1 point,Thu May 7 02:38:12 2015 UTC,Except Kuririn was one of the only characters that literally couldn't become a Super Sayain lol
bleach,351p04,Doc_o_Clock,5,Wed May 6 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"Bankai isn't required for captaincy. There are three methods by which a Shinigami can become a captain:     The Captain Proficiency Test, which requires the ability to perform Bankai. This test must be taken in front of at least three captains, including the captain commander. Personal recommendations from at least six captains, and the approval of at least three of the remaining seven. Defeat the previous captain in a one-on-one battle, in front of at least 200 members of that captain's division.   Bankai is only required for one of those three methods, but it is the easiest method to becoming a captain, so I assume that most people use it.    And of the lieutenants (and Ikkaku) who have Bankai, they all have personal reasons why they wouldn't want to leave their respective divisions to become captains; they want to continue to serve under their captains. And honestly, it really is still a small percentage of non-captain Shinigami who have Bankai."
bleach,351p04,Zil_v_a,3,Wed May 6 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"Of course not all of them have a bankai, but the closer a lieutenant is to the captain, the more likely he is to either have it or the potential to unlock it. Your right hand is the one you think might be a good pick to replace you when it comes to the worst."
bleach,351p04,Nnoitrum,3,Wed May 6 11:19:34 2015 UTC,"That's likely the reason Shuhei, Kira, and Momo didn't take over their district after their captains left; they likely didn't have Bankai.   No, they didn't take over because they were not captain quality."
bleach,351p04,LucciDVergo,3,Wed May 6 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"Because the SS had fallen into a lax state pre-Aizen.  They could defeat most Hollows without releasing Bankai and no Quincy bothered them.  Now post-Aizeb they realized how weakened they have become and probably encourage more people to develop it (it is like Nen in HxH, it could be misused in the wrong hands)"
bleach,351p04,Sandisk4gb4,2,Wed May 6 15:23:57 2015 UTC,Because at this point there is no difference being a lieutanent than a common shinigami fodder. Just look at Hinamori for the best example.

bleach,34yvut,Gl33m,6,Tue May 5 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"As /u/Andygoesrawr talked about at length last week, the main two translators for the last year or two* have been at Mangapanda and Mangastream.   Superficially, Mangastream is superior, although Mangapanda release translations of new chapters faster. In actuality, they're both excellent translations, but mangapanda suffers from insufficient editing (grammatical mistakes everywhere) while Mangastream suffers from excessive editing (changing the meaning of statements sometimes for the sake of smooth dialogue).   Most of the archives of old chapters I see use Mangastream's translations though, and as I understand it they're pretty damned good up through 500 at least. As far as downloading them goes, I have no source; my first instinct says torrenting would be your best bet, but of course that carries its own risks and doesn't support Kubo at all. It's somewhat hypocritical of me to say that though, as I mostly only read Bleach online. Shit gets expensive, you're right."
bleach,34yvut,ArcTruth,3,Tue May 5 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"You're fantastic, and this is exactly what I wanted. I'm still buying the box sets as they release (if only for collector's value, but it supports Kubo too). But damn if they don't take forever to get here.  Thanks a ton for the info. It's very appreciated.  And a side note: Holy fuck is there so much to read... I mean, I'm doing like 20/30 chapters a day here, but there's still so much left. But it's better than when I hit the end and have to start waiting each week for a chapter like everyone else."
bleach,34yvut,ArcTruth,3,Tue May 5 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"It definitely is way better. Miss those days sometimes.  One more thing, in case you're not aware - I often use Kissmanga, which uses Mangastream's translations iirc, when I do marathon reads because of their format. Instead of loading a single page at a time, making you load a new page twenty times in a single chapter, they just load the whole chapter on a single page. Even works fine for me on a little iPhone, was reading Claymore that way a few weeks back.  Just in case that's the reason you didn't want to bother with reading the chapters online. Only problem with Kissmanga is that as far as I can tell they don't have the Turn Back the Pendulum arc, which has a weird numbering format. Looking at Mangastream's archives though, they come right after chapter 315, so just don't forget about it if you want a bunch of helpful backstory on Urahara and co."
bleach,34yvut,MetaAmbience,3,Tue May 5 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"Ooooh that's really helpful. I'll try that on my phone. If I can read that fine on my phone, I'll just use it. And I'll make sure to move over to the archive for the Turn Back the Pendulum arc. It was in the anime, so I've watched it, but I'm still trying to read everything. So I'll definitely be reading it too."

The holy grail grants one wish to the victor. The servants are summoned spirits of influential and powerful people from throughout the ages that were made famous from historical events or notable legends.  It's a really cool concept. This is called the Fate series. Definitely check them out.

bleach,34woz8,Zil_v_a,3,Tue May 5 13:41:29 2015 UTC,Basically refers to how random shit always seems to happen.  Stuff that there was no logical build towards ends up defining the end of arcs.  It gets kind of annoying.
bleach,34woz8,feralstank,3,Tue May 5 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any, really. Maybe I just take the story too passively. Throw an example at me and I'll see if I can debunk it~"
bleach,34woz8,Zil_v_a,3,Tue May 5 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Ichigo himself is far and away the worst offender. In order, the Ulquiorra fight, the 3 months of training making him a physical god, and the sudden revelation that ""oh he's part quincy too"" are probably the three biggest incidents people will mention. Though the last one is less Deus Ex and more often just referred to as unnecessary complication.  Except for the first two mentioned, I absolutely love just about everything in Bleach. The main character is the least interesting thing about it in my opinion largely because most of Ichigo's involvement takes it from an interesting and diverse universe with a ton of depth to a stereotypical shonen. If Kubo'd gone back and made Ichigo less of a stupid-ass Mary Sue I think I'd love it a whole lot more.   Odds are pretty good, though, he's going to be revealed as a lynchpin of some sort with a ton of legacy and a major role to play, which will of course retroactively justify the entirety of the Bleach narrative. Kubo's good at that."
bleach,34woz8,ArcTruth,5,Tue May 5 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, the Ulquiorra is absolutely the worst example at anything, I agree. No idea if Kubo ever tough hollow mode will be a good idea, especially after he never used that idea again. I say he pulled out a naruto there.   The three months of training...idk, somehow I liked that part. You know, he did train after all, this doesn't happen often in shonens, whatsoever in the very beginning. By looking on how much reiatsu he has and all that absorbing power from atmosphere quincy thing, he might just have enough of a reason to beat a few captains. It is his superpower that makes him the hero of the story. If he was to assume a normal training schedule to match up to anyone, then there would be no reason to have a substitute shiningami. The manga would be just about the gotei."
bleach,34woz8,Zil_v_a,2,Tue May 5 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"Bleach is cool. That's all there is to it. It's way cooler than Naruto and One Piece. If I want captivating storytelling with impeccable wit and penetrating depth, I'll fucking read Sartre or Camus or something. It's that simple."
bleach,34woz8,TIHNK,23,Wed May 6 07:36:04 2015 UTC,"They claim Bleach story telling is awful and that it should have ended at SS arc. It's normal to bash on the ""big dogs"", have you ever seen they rate Dragon Ball Z or One Piece nicely?

bleach,34woz8,Fred_MK,6,Tue May 5 05:26:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure about DBZ, but /r/manga rates One Piece pretty highly. The anime suffers from low production cost like all long running animes so /r/anime doesn't care about it much."
bleach,34woz8,Sazerfan,14,Tue May 5 10:49:18 2015 UTC,"Imagine this scenario:  Kishimoto, Oda and Kubo all decide to draw the same comic strip, completely unrelated to their own work (hell, we could even make it a Naruto tribute).  According to /r/manga the following would happen:  Oda would be the one who came up with the idea, being hailed as a literary, and artistic, genius.  Kishimoto would be paying tribute to Oda.  Kubo would be the dirty fucking plagiarizer who hasn't had a single unique thought in his entire life."
bleach,34woz8,Plattbagarn,6,Tue May 5 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"What they really ought to do is a collaboration. Oda and Kishimoto writing (Oda would be the idea guy and Kishimoto could bring his ideas down to Earth), and Kubo as the artist.  Whatever manga came out of such a partnership would be pretty awesome, I think."
bleach,34woz8,Narissis,3,Tue May 5 14:34:43 2015 UTC,I'd hope Kubo had some influence in character design and dialogue. Kishimoto's characters get a little preachy for my taste.

bleach,34woz8,Narissis,2,Tue May 5 19:27:05 2015 UTC,How come?  I don't see his art being any better.  I think Kishimoto's is probably the best of the three.

bleach,34woz8,Doodle210,7,Tue May 5 11:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the author of FT admitted that it was supposed to be way shorter but he stuck to it, so you end with the same situation One Piece had: you didn't plan it to go there. You end up making official filler content trying to write the story out, padding and lowering the quality of writing.  When you read and or analyze bleach you realize it was planned to be a hit. Everything at least to the final getsuga was supposed to happen from the beginning. That's what allowed Kubo to make a good story in the first place.  But no, they don't fight in every chapter so it's crap, right? Honestly, people like on /r/anime are another reason why we can't have nice things."
bleach,34woz8,Zil_v_a,7,Tue May 5 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"On top of it being a magnificently planned and orchestrated plot up to FGT, Kubo's a goddamned master of finding the little plot holes he can exploit to tie a whole new plot in on its own.   Ichigo's mother is a prime example of this; it's a little odd to think someone as strong as he came from a single Shinigami parent. But if his mother was spiritually strong too, she wouldn't have died to an ordinary Hollow. Except boom, she's a Quincy and Ywach took her powers for himself rendering her helpless at the worst possible time.  Hell, he does it with Zangetsu too; there was always something a little fucky about Zangetsu when you compared him to any other Zanpakuto. Now we have an explanation for why that makes a ton of sense and seriously fits retroactively, right down to specific dialogue. And it's tied in to how his parents got together, which is itself tied to Aizen."

When people who know and want to make it do it, you get awesome things like death note, bleach, code geass and so on. But nowadays it's far easier to make, so you get a lot of throwaway series. I mean, 90% of anime with the harem or ecchi tags are garbage. There are whole sectors of this genre that breed no worthy material and I'm not sure if even god knows how do they cover their production costs."

A single genre is so wide in amounts of tastes it can provide that putting everyone together in one room is like trying to cause a war.

The second place was given to Steins;gate, while first to FMA:Brotherhood. Death Note lost to Fate/Zero, I assume because in Fate/Zero they fight a lot.  Hellsing ultimate loses to Haruhii Suzumia no Yuutsuu, while Jogoku Shoujo and BECK lose to Kiss x Sis.   In their current Ships bracket we have Maou & Yuusha, pretty much 1st row characters of a romance losing the contest to 3rd row comic relief of Erika Karisawa & Walker Yumasaki. Kenshin Himura & Kaoru Kamiya lose to Shirou Emiya & Sakura Matou, I have no idea why since Fate/Haven's feel has not been an anime yet. I can bet it's a random ship and not something based on them knowing the series.  Pretty much every time they make a bracket they confirm that their tastes are beyond saving."

I tend to apply my knowledge about them when crafting my subjective opinions and while I know that there are many factors and often time a things vastly different can be equally good, the results from /r/anime votings are somewhat chaotic, they don't follow any patter or reason, it's as random as it gets.

bleach,34woz8,mrbiggelsworththe4th,5,Tue May 5 15:20:19 2015 UTC,R/anime are the snooty wine drinkers of anime and while it is by no means unfair to say that Oda is the superior story teller it is unfair that they discredit kubos true strength which is design he honestly is the best in terms of artistic ability amongst the three without resorting to gimmicks he can design characters that by merely looking at them and the way they carry themselves from chapter to chapter you can learn a lot about them. Ive been a fan of all of the big three and hands down I think Kubo just has the coolest stlye and maybe the guys over there maybe a little right about some of there artistic assessments they're kind of snobbish docks about it.
bleach,34woz8,Zil_v_a,5,Tue May 5 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. The streanght of Kubo is definitely his writing. He planned the story out expecting it to be a great hit, which gave him an edge over the other two.  While his artstyle is realistic and pretty good since some more recent arcs, I also have to say that One Piece represents an artstyle that is equally good albeit as different as it can get. Explaining it would be pretty boring, so to make it simple I'll tell you that his forms and figures greatly represent dynamism and awake subconscious reactions towards his characters, while keeping each and every one of them as original along others as possible.  This makes his style great but aimed only at ones that enjoy its cartoony approach. Kubo is the other kinda guy, everything is realistic and while everyone certainly has his own character, it's build in a conscious manner via what the figure is dressed in, not what it's constructed out of. I have to say, if we exclude the gods of art like Kentaro Miura then Kubo and Oda are one of the best ones around.  Putting artstyle aside, it's hard to enjoy a story about a bunch of people talking about searching for a treasure they never search for. One piece is good as it goes, but garbage when looked at as a whole. For contrary, while Bleach may appear very typical, when you look at it in retrospective and connect the dots it becomes an artpiece of storywriting."
bleach,34woz8,Zil_v_a,3,Tue May 5 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"Also, r/anime are not snobs, but noobs. Those guys enjoy tatter from the Ecchi and harem genre as if it had content. That place is full of noobs and inexperienced weaboos searching for attention. I highly doubt a single one of them would enjoy the taste of wine while agreeing with the general opinions of the board."
bleach,34woz8,RC211V,2,Tue May 5 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know what he's talking about. R/anime is full of casuals, not snobs. Almost every damn post is about some best girl shit and their standards are ridiculously low in general."
bleach,34woz8,Syntaxlies,7,Tue May 5 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair I can see why /r/anime doesn't like the Bleach anime. Anime adaptions of big Shonen manga are rarely done with respect to the source material. This is why Naruto is still airing fillers despite the manga ending 6 months ago. This is why the pacing of the One Piece anime is so bad that it often adapts a single chapter at a time. Bleach is no exception to this, a ton of filler and inconsistent animation quality have plagued it from the get-go. It makes me thankful that studios like Madhouse and David Production exist, as they've adapted HxH and JJBA as well as they could within their budget and didn't just cut corners wherever possible to make a buck.  That said though, that subreddit can still eat shit. They only seem to care about crappy FoTM harem/romcom bullshit and waifutalk over there. It's pretty gross."

Bleach was good. We have our sentiments, so we can enjoy things in new chapters that others can't. For example - we're happy everytime old buddy returns to the series, or we see Ichigo after a long break, or some new power-up etc.  Again, it's nothing wrong if some people doesn't have that much fun from reading the same manga/watching the same anime as we have.  My opinion? Bleach currently really sucks and it deserves its rank in WSJ's weekly pools. Objectively, it's how it is in my opinion. I like some things in new chapters, but generally saying, comparing it to different mangas - latest arcs are nowhere near them."

Edit: ok my memory must have been a bit shaky because I looked it up and yeah, there are definitely fanservice moments in the original. I agree that those scenes were unnecessary."

The theory is that these Quincies were from a more ancient lineage and therefore had different types of Quincy powers and Yhwach just uber-enhanced them.  Correct me if I'm wrong /r/bleach
bleach,34ukhe,LucciDVergo,3,Mon May 4 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, actually. Ywhach seems to get all of their power when they die, but until that point it seems he can shift around what power he's bestowed on others at will."

bleach,34ukhe,JinMarui,0,Mon May 4 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"I thought he just shifted the life-force, not the powers, they never used different powers when they revived"
bleach,34ukhe,LucciDVergo,2,Mon May 4 20:07:23 2015 UTC,"He meant power, not individual powers. Like how in the very beginning Ichigo got Rukia's power, but not her powers (Sode No Shirayuki)"
bleach,34ukhe,HazelnutPi,2,Mon May 4 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"ah, my fault"
bleach,34ukhe,LucciDVergo,2,Mon May 4 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"It hasn't quite been explained yet. In chapter 617, Both Bazz and Nanana were hit by the Auswählen.   http://www.mangastream.to/bleach-chapter-617-page-18.html  Since then, both of them have shown that they are still able to use their powers. Furthermore, Giselle showed up with some fresh zombies and it can be assumed that her powers remained intact, otherwise she wouldn't have control over them. Since she and Liltotto avoided the light, I'm just going to assume she also has her powers.  I think it has something to do with those quinces specifically and their amount of natural power. It seems to me that the remaining sternritter are amongst the strongest. Earlier in the chapter above, Liltotto said that they were the stronger side, but losing Candice and Meninas was going to make it a more rough battle. During their mini-fight with Ichigo, each girl was struck several times and were still able to move about and fight. This proves a stark power difference between the Sternritter and the Gotei 13, as Ichigo had previously incapacitated three lieutenant officers when he was at a much weaker point in his power development. In addition, each girl was struck by a burner finger and continued fighting. Hitsugaya got hit by one burner finger and it seemed to do quite a bit of damage to him. And as a final point, in the most recent chapter the little beginning quip was ""The Elite Quincy renegade against Yhwach!!!"" This is obviously talking about the Sternritter left in soul society, which are the elite quincy that held their own against soul society in both of the invasions."

bleach,34qrwn,lamka,32,Sun May 3 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Hefty spoilers ahead, you are warned.  Kenpachi has a saiyan thing going on, when he's beaten down, he comes back stronger.  When Ichigo first fights him, he's actually pretty weak. (compared to his full power).  Ichigo vs Byakuya is an odd one,I think he was actually really strong at that point in time, but with his hollow coming to the surface at that time put his power into flux for a long time (Ulquiorra comments about this as well).  We could surmise that Ichi vs Byakuya, he was strong because he was consistent (strong to the point he actually cracked his bones with his new power he wasn't really ready for).  And he spent the entire Hueco mundo arc making peace with his hollow side, and eventually becoming more stable, culminating in the Grimmjow battle.  He's no match for Ulqiorra at this point in time, without access to more of his hollow powers.  he then spends the next 100 or so chapters being useless as shit while everyone else fights the espada and aizen.  he then gets plot no jutsu power up from his dad. etc.  Apparently Zangetsu was actually the manifestation of Ichigo's quincy side, mimicking shinigami powers (this explains his lack of needing an asauchi, and his inability to seal his sword lower than shikai).  Zangetsu heavily limited the amount of power he granted ichigo ""To protect him"" (Utter bull, the amount of times he nearly died when he could have used more power, like vs Ulquiorra). The reasoning being that if ichigo were stronger, he'd seek out more powerful foes. TL;DR old man zangetsu is a fucking moron.  disclaimer : Some of this is speculation, and the rest from my memory, which has proven to be faulty in the past."
bleach,34qrwn,sephtis,10,Sun May 3 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"In addition, while Kenpachi has the ""Saiyan thing"" going for him, it turns out he also subconsciously limits himself to be roughly the same ""power level"" as his opponent. As a kid, he could have easily beaten ""The First Kenpachi"" Unohana, but didn't as he wanted to have a worthy opponent and not destroy everyone around him. So, in addition to his reiatsu limiter, he also has a subconscious strength limiter, so that his fights aren't one-sided, so it occasionally will result in Kenpachi being beat-down by a swift, large power-up (ie Ichigo learning to properly use his Getsuga Tensho), and is part of the reason he can't communicate with his zanpakuto."
bleach,34qrwn,Tiresieas,7,Mon May 4 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"OMZ is not an idiot.  If he is a part of Yhwach then he would want Ichigo to get as powerful as he could and survive as long as possible before ultimately dying, thereby sending back his Quincy powers to Yhwach, stronger....if I understand all of this correctly.  He did not let his sword power go too far past his training power."
bleach,34qrwn,LucciDVergo,2,Sun May 3 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"Not utter bull.  Look at it this way.  You feel your kid will go far in life with a specific job but he's taking classes that will lead him away towards something different.

bleach,34qrwn,MrcisuM,20,Mon May 4 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"You're skipping over a detail that, really, everyone skips over. Ichigo's Inner Hollow said ""I am Zangetsu."" Well, for the whole Arrancar arc, Ichigo was wary of Hichigo. However, if Hichigo is also Zangetsu, that means Ichigo was afraid of his own Zanpakuto.  OMZ told Ichigo that a Zanpakuto and its wielder will only make each other weaker if they don't trust each other.   Ichigo's poor relationship with Zangetsu didn't remove his ability to use Bankai or any techniques, but it made his power level pitifully small. He wasn't even allowed the speed boost that his Bankai should have offered him.   That's why he seemed weaker in the Arrancar arc.   Congratulations for being observant enough to even notice. Most of the people on here still haven't."

bleach,34qrwn,Temperatia,1 point,Mon May 4 16:02:02 2015 UTC,Yes it did matter... because Ichigo not knowing and OMZ restricting White caused the tension/distrust inside Ichigo. And Confusion. Lots of confusion.
bleach,34qrwn,toons475,1 point,Mon May 4 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"No, the cause of the tension and distrust was White's own behavior. White tried to take over his body, beat him to a pulp, insulted him, and threatened to take over his body if the chance ever presented itself.   That adversarial relationship between Ichigo and White was what he needed to progress his Hollow powers (leading to him being able to wear his mask for indefinite amounts of time) but torpedoed his Shinigami powers."
bleach,34qrwn,Temperatia,1 point,Mon May 4 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"Ah I see what you're getting at now... so if Ichigo went the other way and tried to understand White he would have increased Shinigami powers, or do you think he'd still gain more Hollow powers?"
bleach,34qrwn,toons475,1 point,Tue May 5 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"He would have been forced to go through his current situation with White. White was trying to take over his body. So, focusing on his Shinigami powers just would have left him unable to fight off White.  Trying to ignore White and keep fighting is what got him so beat up while fighting Yammy.  There was no alternative to learning to beat back his inner Hollow. Though, fearing his Zanpakuto wasn't really necessary. Neither Tousen nor the Vizards showed the same decrease in power Ichigo did. Even though the Vizards seemed to have the same problem of their inner Hollow going out of control when they used Bankai."
bleach,34qrwn,Temperatia,1 point,Tue May 5 03:57:28 2015 UTC,"Well, do you think the difference between Ichigo and other Vizoreds caused a majority of the differences and situations?

bleach,34qrwn,Temperatia,4,Mon May 4 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question about Ichigo's power fluctuations is resolve.  In SS, Ichigo was focussed.  He was there to save Rukia.  Period.  End of story.  The various captains and lieutenants were in the way, so he would defeat them.  Simple as that.  In the Arrancar/HM arc, Ichigo's not focussed.  He's dealing with his own inner demons (somewhat literally).  He wants to rescue Orihime, but he's afraid of what's inside him.  He's afraid to use his power, because he's afraid of losing himself to it.  As for the OMZ/Hichigo connection - if you're only up to Ichigo vs. Aizen, there's a lot that hasn't been revealed yet.  Unfortunately, you've got the whole Fullbring arc between you and those explanations.  If you want to read it for yourself, stop here.    Spoilers follow.  Hichigo is the ""real"" Zangetsu.  He's a zanpakuto spirit created by Ichigo's imprint upon the remnant of the artificial hollow ""White"", created by Aizen.  White infected Ichigo's mother, Masaki.  Urahara saved Masaki by binding White's remnant to Isshin's Shinigami powers.  That remnant and the reishi thread binding it to Isshin were passed down to Ichigo at birth, and Ichigo's soul nturally imprinted upon it.  But Ichigo also carries Quincy powers, inherited from Masaki.  Quincy powers are linked to soul fragments of Yhwach that are either passed down through Quincy bloodlines, or implanted directly.  In Ichigo's soulscape, those Quincy powers take the form of Yhwach form 1000 years ago - who we know of as OMZ.  OMZ is a separate being from Yhwach.  He has his own goals and desires.  Specifically, OMZ's desire is to ""protect Ichigo"".  He's somewhat of an overprotective father figure. He thinks that Ichigo following the path of the Shinigami will inevitably bring him into conflict and danger.  To avoid this, OMZ wants to scare Ichigo away from that path.  He does this by suppressing Zangetsu's ""shinigami side"", and only allowing Ichigo to access it's Hollow side.  Mechanically, at the beginning of the series OMZ is the ascendant portion of Ichigo's power.  Zangetsu's Hollow sie is suppressed by the thread tying it to Isshin.  His Shinigami side is suppressed by OMZ.  This allows OMZ to take over, and thus when Ichigo ""contacts"" his inner spirits, he's the one who's there.  Ichigo of course doesn't know any better, so he thinks OMZ is Zangetsu.  When Ichigo gains Bankai, the reishi thread breaks, Isshin gets his powers back, and Hichigo (Zangetsu) gains ascendency.  This is why ofter Banki, we don't see OMZ at all until the Dangai - and then we see him in his non-ascendant form.  Zangetsu's Shinigami side is still being suppressed, however - so Hichigo is still being driven by his basic Hollow urge to take over."
bleach,34qrwn,yukeake,3,Mon May 4 12:07:30 2015 UTC,The Kenpachi battles as well as The Old Man Zangetsu/Hollow things are explained later on in the manga.
bleach,34qrwn,Dragonsden26,3,Sun May 3 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"Why is it that in Soul Society arc he was able to defeat/tie the likes of Kenpachi with just his shikai   Kenpachi has this shtick where he subconsciously lowers his max power level to match that of his opponent. This is so he can enjoy a fight since his haxx p0warz will wipe the floor with almost anyone, barring Yamamoto and Unohana (seriously) in a matter of minutes. He has recently undergone training to remedy this. During the fight with Ichigo, he lowered his power to equal that of Ichigo's.   and Byakuya with his bankai   This is a bit more dodgy. I'm of the opinion that Byakuya doesn't have that much raw power, but he does have mad skills. So during his fight with Ichigo, his power level should be equal, if not slightly higher than Ichigo at the time. What turned the tide was Ichigo's hollow powers kicking in, making him much, much more powerful (Hollow Ichigo is slightly stronger than Ulquiorra, barring Segunda Etapa and stuff).   In the Arrancar and Hueco Mundo arcs his shikai and bankai seem so weak and he has to rely on his Inner hollow.   The Arrancar were basically more powerful than majority of captain-class shinigami at the time of their introduction. Remember that Hitsugaya and Ikakku had to go full Bankai against Grimmjow's fraccion, and those were just Gillian-class Arrancar.   He seemed so weak against Grimmjow and he barely defeated him while Kenpachi beat the number 5 espada and byakuya easily defeated the number 7 espada   explained earlier.   I'm also confused about the whole Old Man Zangetsu and White Ichigo thing. Why was it Old Man Zangetsu at first and why did his hollow powers take so long to come out?   Later on in the Manga, it is revealed that Ichigo has actually three sets of powers: Shinigami, Quincy, and Hollow. Since the three all hate each other, they compete for dominance. Ichigo's Quincy side actively suppresses Ichigo's Hollow side until Ogihci was strong enough to overpower Old Man Zangetsu."

Byakuya commented how Ichigo's bankai was so powerful that his own body couldn't keep up with it.   I think from that point onwards, Ichigo kept his power in check. He didn't move as fast, and he didn't hit as hard because he knew that if he did, he'd run the risk of hurting himself.   It wasn't until he started using his Hollow mask that he really started letting go, which propelled him past his original level..."

As in you have to fully commit yourself to an action in order to go at it with full power? The fights with renji and kenpachi echo that lesson, in both cases ichigo is only reallt able to match and beat them by fully commiting himself 100% to failure not being on tue table. Kenpachi even makes a point of telling ichigo not to lose focus or else his reitsu will weaken, and when ichigo does lose his resolve for an instant, he gets left for dead until a pep talm from OMZ gets ichigo in the game again.  After he first goes bankai, two things happen. One, ichigo goes hollow, which makes him a little scared of his own powers - even after he learns to control it, he's still unnerved by it. The second is he gets a little cocky. He crosses the fine line between complete resolve and believing he will win not matter what. He's become extremely powerful, but he doesn't regain his true resolve until he faces down aizen in the finalie.  His power waivers because his power output is directly tied to his willpower and focus, which waivers over events."

bleach,34s2eg,zombykilr777,6,Mon May 4 02:00:58 2015 UTC,"Yes.  At the end of the Fullbring arc when Ichigo is ""jumpstarted"" back into Shinigami-hood, he's an order of magnitude weaker than he was vs. Aizen.  There are a couple of reasons for that, both of which are simply implied (and open to speculation).  The first is that post-Dangai Ichigo was in a ""special"" state that wasn't sustainable.  We know that Mugetsu was a ""burnout"" technique, but it's highly likely his post-Dangai state itself was also an aspect of the ""Final Getsuga"".  The second, and much more speculatory explanation is that Ichigo literally ""burned out"" Zangetsu when using FGT/Mugetsu.  If you've only watched the anime, you haven't reached the infodump(s) about Zangetsu.  If you want to read it yourself, stop here.  Spoilers follow.  From FGT/Mugetsu until the forging, we don't see or hear from either OMZ or Hichigo/Zangetsu at all.  Even once Ichigo gets ""jumpstarted"", his spirits are silent.  Additionally, his post-Fullbring zanpakuto is much more ""memory"" based than previously.  Shikai looks exactly like a larger, crossguard-less version of Yhwach's blade.  Bankai looks exactly like one of White's armblades.  And they're brittle - Haschwald, seemingly without activating his ""balance"" power, slices Tensa Zangetsu in half with seemingly no effort.  My theory here is that post-Fullbring, pre-forging, Ichigo is using what's essentially an empowered memory of his powers, drawn out by the remnant of his Fullbring.  At the forging, Ichigo essentially creates a ""new"" Zanpakuto.  Whereas pre-FGT Zangetsu was Ichigo's imprint on White's remnant, post-forging Zangetsu (""NewZangetsu"") is a fresh imprint upon a ""proper"" Asauchi.  Then he forcibly inserts OMZ into the mid-forging blade, creating a second blade, and what may be the first Quincy zanpkauto spirit.  Also of note is that ""NewHichigo"" hasn't spoken yet.  I don't know if we can read anything into that.  The fact that his Shinigami side will no longer be suppressed could mean he'll have something of a personality change."

bleach,34s2n2,iajaabq,10,Mon May 4 02:03:08 2015 UTC,"There are arc-wise listings of episodes with a small one/two sentence description of the episode contents on Wikipedia (not the Bleach wiki). You want to look at that if you want a quick catch-up.  Here's a short(er) recap if you want:   Hollow attacks Kurosaki family; Shinigami Rukia comes to rescue, is injured; gives her powers to Ichigo; Ichigo becomes a Shinigami; fights hollows Rukia is accused of illegally giving powers to a human; forcibly taken back to Soul Society; given the death penalty by Central 46; Byakuya and Renji mess-up Ichigo in the process of taking Rukia back  Ichigo gets his powers back with Urahara's help; he, Chad, Uryu, Inoue and Yoruichi invade Soul Society as Ryoka to save Rukia Fight between Vice-captains/Captains and the Ryoka; ""murder"" of Aizen Sousuke, Momo suspects Gin; Ichigo defeats Ikkaku, Renji, Kenpachi, almost battles Byakuya; rescued by Yoruichi; Uryu battles and defeats Mayuri but loses his powers Infighting within the Gotei 13; on the front lines are Momo, Kira, Komamura, Tousen, Hisagi, Iba, Kenpachi, Ikkaku, Yumichika, Hitsugaya, Gin, Byakuya, Yamamoto, Shunsui and Ukitake Ichigo uses ""hollow powers"" in his battle against Byakuya; battle ends in a draw (although Byakuya admits Ichigo's victory) It so turns out Aizen is a traitor; been manipulating Soul Society under the guise of Central 46; he needs to execute Rukia to get the Hogyoku implanted in her soul by Urahara; hence the use of Soukyoku; Unohana discovers the betrayal and informs everyone Gin and Tousen are accomplices; they mess up Ichigo, Renji, Komamura; get the Hogyoku; try to kill Rukia; escape to Hueco Mundo   Skipping the filler Bount Arc - this arc is basically about some vampire-like creatures created by Soul Society and revolves around a ""former 12th Division Captain"" who created them   Aizen wants to use the Hogyoku to break the boundaries between Shinigami and Hollow and gain even greater power; he creates powerful hollows called Arrancar; they come in 3 flavors - Gillian, Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde Has a team off 10 super-ultra-hyper-powerful Arrancar called Espada Ulquiorra and Yammy sent to gain intel on Ichigo, Yoruichi and Urahara; Inoue's Koten Zanshun gets destroyed; Ichigo battles them; hollow powers interfere; he gets messed up; Yoruichi and Urahara force Ulquiorra and Yammy to withdraw Isshin revealed as a Shinigami and former Captain; defeats Grand Fischer, the hollow that killed his wife Masaki Kurosaki Yamamoto sends a small team of Shinigami to work with Ichigo in the Human World, to fortify it and get info; Rukia saves Ichigo from despair Skirmishes between the team and some Arrancar; Grimmjow revealed; he brutalizes Ichigo, Rukia; Hitsugaya's team battle his underlings; eventually win, although barely; Ikkaku uses Bankai to win Grimmjow punished for invading without permission; arm severed, stripped of Espada status; new characters revealed to possess both Shinigami and Hollow powers - called Visored; Inoue's Koten Zanshun healed; Wonderweiss created Ichigo trains with Visored, gains small amount of control over hollow mask/powers; battles Grimmjow again; gains upper hand until mask breaks; ass saved by Hirako Shinji of Visored; Uryu trains with his dad and gets his Quincy powers back Urahara brutalizes Yammy, Hitsugaya freezes the new 6th Espada; Inoue Orihime kidnapped; Arrancar withdraw from Human World Inoue branded traitor; left for dead; Ichigo, Ishida, and Chad break into Hueco Mundo to save her; joined later by Renji and Rukia (on Byakuya's orders); Orihime heals Grimmjow; he gets back his Espada status, kills his replacement Espada Ichigo & Co. break for Las Noches (Aizen's fortress in Hueco Mundo); battle and defeat former Espada (Privaron Espada); are confronted by current Espada; Rukia defeats Aaroneiro; Uryu & Renji vs. Szayelaporro; Chad loses to Espada # 5 Ulquiorra kicks Ichigo's ass; nearly kills him; Grimmjow brings Orihime to him; Ichigo barely healed by Orihime; Grimmjow seals Ulquiorra; battles Ichigo; loses (waaahhh T_T)   From here to episode 189 is a filler arc about Shuusuke Amagai; it tells of some noble-family conspiracy, involving Gin's replacement Captain Shuusuke Amagai.  Hope this is good enough."

bleach,34s2n2,reigun91,1 point,Mon May 4 08:53:58 2015 UTC,I would look at the bleach wiki for all the info you need.

bleach,34ptpi,WhereIsMyMime,2,Sun May 3 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe thats why his zanpakuto is unique in that its figuratively a double edged sword. It conflicts with his well beingx giving him advantages and weaknesses. And in the arc that kubo directly oversaw, he made them have totally different personalities."
bleach,34ptpi,rigaj,7,Sun May 3 23:44:41 2015 UTC,I prefer to believe Shutara is the ex-lover and she wove it for him.
bleach,34ptpi,smallchristmaslights,18,Mon May 4 11:24:45 2015 UTC,Maybe Senjumaru made it for him.
bleach,34ptpi,aizen6,8,Sun May 3 16:01:58 2015 UTC,This could be worth pondering over.

Everyone all over the internet made the dame connections.  edit: Oh I see what happened. This is the part where I mixed up OP with this idiot.

bleach,34ptpi,aizen6,7,Mon May 4 07:53:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't read about Bleach anywhere other than this subreddit, so I'm unaware of where else it has been discussed. I'm sorry if my post insinuated that I came up with the theory. I only meant that it could warrant further discussion; that's all."

I shouldn't have to repeat it to someone who thinks they're so smart they can point out plagiarists of the ""Shunsui Haori theory,"" even when there is no plagiarism involved.    You've seen it.    You do not know what I have seen or not seen, so for your own good, I would recommend that you refrain from commenting on something beyond the reach of your knowledge    Looks like we got two people playing stupid today.    Do not use such strong words. It makes you look weak. -- Sousuke Aizen. Apparently, you're the real thing he meant. I notice from the history of your posts, how you claim that everyone else on this subreddit is stupid or a karma wh0re. Pretty big talk for someone who follows Bleach but doesn't know who Candice Catnipp is. I apologized if I insinuated that I came up with the Pink Haori theory, and nobody but you, of all the 20,281 interracial, interdenominational, gender non-specific beings on this subreddit, had a problem. Seems to me like you're the one with issues, not the other 20,280 people here. If you're trying to sound assertive and authoritative, you're doing a mighty fine job, yes, but you're doing an even better job of being a jerk."

And oh look, you're basically admitting you knew how to use search.  And also lol at reading my posting history, I'm glad you wasted time doing that, and typing up that big wall of text like this is some sort of important debate.  You're a karma whore. That's it. You admitted it yourself just now for stating your reasoning behind it.  Also, I never said I was a hardcore bleach fan, I don't give a shit if I don't know everyone's names and all their powers, and their favorite color dildos. I mean exactly what I said, you're a karma whore, bro. The shunsui kimono and ichigo's melting pot of powrs making him the soul king theories have been discussed a shitload of times. Even a casual lurker like me has seen it a shitload of times. Thats how a non hardcore bleach fan that doesn't know every sternritter was able to point out your beyond overdone repost.  So suck it."
bleach,34ptpi,aizen6,1 point,Mon May 4 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter, because you're the one that's railing and wailing, and you're the one that's having to use abuses and offensive language.  The rest of us here are here for constructive discussions; such language, attitude and outlook are beneath us. I'm not really angry at you; on the contrary, I feel sorry for you because you've lost an opportunity to hear neat thoughts from a variety of people because you're too obsessed with karma and wh0res and what not.  Besides, I have the right to voice my opinion on just about anything, and as long as it is not insulting anyone and directed at anyone in particular, I don't see how it should be a problem. Whether an issue has been discussed or not doesn't give you the right to decide whether it's sh!t or whatever. If a Moderator stopped by to inform me not to discuss something, I would gladly comply. You're not one; you're far from someone who would try to engage in meaningful conversation. So please, kindly get over yourself, because with that pompous attitude, I hardly think you're going to get much support - not just here, but about anywhere on the planet. The world is a big place; learn to think beyond yourself and your own opinions.  And please do not call me ""bro."" No matter what sense you intend it to mean, the word in itself means ""brother,"" which you and I hardly are to each other as."

bleach,34ptpi,misterhifriend,13,Sun May 3 17:54:03 2015 UTC,There was a theory on here a little while ago that said something on the lines of Senjumaru being Shunsui's lover.
bleach,34ptpi,AustinRivers25,8,Sun May 3 18:46:50 2015 UTC,"Too bad Senjumaru didn't interact with Shunsui... Otherwise, it's a good theory"

bleach,34ptpi,aizen6,6,Sun May 3 15:37:11 2015 UTC,"It is. The flowers are different. I wonder why, because if that haori has a history to it, it wouldn't make sense to change it."
bleach,34ptpi,LoLKirukia,2,Sun May 3 16:10:51 2015 UTC,Drawing mistake maybe?
bleach,34ptpi,Rocksbury,8,Sun May 3 22:12:56 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Kubo-sensei has been building up that Haori since the Soul Society arc. The only other explanation I can think of is that the haori reacts to his reiatsu and changes with time when his personality exhibits minor changes.
bleach,34ptpi,_Hypersugar,8,Mon May 4 05:23:08 2015 UTC,I wonder if it will tie into why he selects female vice captains who look similar.
bleach,34ptpi,Zil_v_a,9,Sun May 3 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"I think that his Bankai involves a bet.  When he last used it, he cannot choose who or what to offer, the sword does. It demanded the owner of that Haori which I believe is the mother of the two similar looking girls who are close to him."
bleach,34ptpi,linuen,3,Sun May 3 20:34:30 2015 UTC,This is a good theory!
bleach,34ptpi,xMatttard,6,Sun May 3 23:04:42 2015 UTC,I hope we get answers soon! :p maybe it works like Kenpachi's eyepatch and it restrains reiatsu

We know that Isshin was in the branch family, and we know that Kaien was in the main family. We also know that Kaien was head 50 years ago, and Isshin was head 20 years ago. Combining that with Kuukaku's comment leaves very little doubt that Isshin is Kaien's uncle, younger than Kaien's father.  It is slightly confusing because 20 years ago Isshin looked about 25 years old, but 100 years ago Kaien looked around the same age, maybe even older. But we know how weird soul ageing is... Isshin could be several thousand years old. (And technically Kaien could actually be older than Isshin since uncles aren't always necessarily older than niblings.)"

bleach,34qd1s,Mekanimal,1 point,Sun May 3 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"I thought cousin as well, for mostly the same reasonings"
bleach,34qd1s,Tumor159,3,Sun May 3 18:01:38 2015 UTC,"He could be Kaien's cousin if every single member of the Shiba family (main and branch) who's older than him at the time were dead, but that's impossible because of Kuukaku's comment that she has an uncle.  Realistically it's only possible that Isshin is Kaien's uncle or anywhere in any generation above that (except for the main line), with how branch families work. If he's not his uncle then Kuukaku's comment is confusing and unexplained, so I'd say it's a fairly certain thing."

bleach,34qd1s,cbelaski,1 point,Sun May 3 20:21:29 2015 UTC,I think Isshin aged faster because he lost his shinigami powers and lived in the human world.

Shunsui didn't even use Bankai (and neither did the vizards fighting him) so it seems unfair that one of the strongest Espada was taken out with a somewhat relative ease."
bleach,34o9ll,Shameuno3,3,Sun May 3 18:41:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the slash wasn't a normal one; it was part of Irooni. Shunsui called ""black"" and he was practically wearing all black (except for the blue obi). Even a small cut would cause massive damage to Starrk (and also to Shunsui, if he happened to hit). Moreover, Shunsui could only cut the black portion of the hollow hole, and nothing else.  Makes sense when his powers are explained. Shunsui is after all, the seniormost after Yama-jii and Unohana-taichou. I don't know how old the Espada are, but if he needed Bankai to kill Starrk, he would be a far cry from Aizen-taichou, whose power was greater than the Espada combined. And we all know that's not true.  Edit: mistook the color of his obi."
bleach,34o9ll,linuen,2,Mon May 4 10:02:48 2015 UTC,Can someone remind me why everyone loves stark so much? i dont remember much from that arc except he was second strongest or was strongest arrancar. Sorry for ignorance lol
bleach,34o9ll,Alluka-,12,Sun May 3 04:33:04 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest factor is how cool he was, his appearance and demeanor just ooze style. And he was one of the more relatable espada, having a completely justified reason to follow Aizen, not being a complete dick, and was overall a laid back guy who could have been one of the good guys had things been a little different."
bleach,34o9ll,Andygoesrawr,3,Sun May 3 04:38:59 2015 UTC,His character was humanized very much so.
bleach,34o9ll,ISAF_Griever,10,Sun May 3 17:52:27 2015 UTC,He's basically the Arrancar version of Shunsui.
bleach,34o9ll,Nightblade96,8,Sun May 3 05:38:43 2015 UTC,A lot of Bleach fans have depression and they can relate to Starrk. The fact that he was both a character (at least somewhat) representing depression and also the strongest Espada just rubs a lot of people the right way.

bleach,34odde,ErikLabroo,55,Sun May 3 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"Fullbring in general is pretty similar to Shikai. It's the act of bringing out the true shape and power of a particular object that has been imprinted on by someone whose parents were attacked by a Hollow before birth.  In Ichigo's case, his Fullbring was literally a Zanpakutou as well as a Fullbring because of his Hollow powers and Zanpakutou being fused.  In other words, Ichigo's Fullbring is about as useful as his regular Shikai. He doesn't get any special powers other than enhanced defense and Getsuga Tenshou because his character doesn't have that sort of depth, unlike some of the other Fullbringers who have strange, god-like powers.  Realistically there should be some defense-based power to his Fullbring, but I don't think he ever figured it out because he didn't have enough time to develop them. Just think about how long Chad was using his Fullbring before he even realised he could use his other arm, or that his right arm was being used in a partial form to begin with. If Ichigo had just his Fullbring and were put through similar tribulations, he would surely unlock some sort of power other than just Getsuga Tenshou. Or at least a defensive application of Getsuga Tenshou.  There's still time though. Unlike other Fullbringers he has an actual Hollow soul inside him that he can communicate with and discover new techniques from, and we've already started to see some new techniques (Getsuga Juujishou), so I wouldn't rule it out just yet."

bleach,34odde,Andygoesrawr,12,Sun May 3 07:45:03 2015 UTC,"We've never been given an answer, but it fits the description of a Fullbring. The only thing that makes it dissimilar to other Fullbrings is the fact that it manifests as sentient beings, but I don't really think that's enough to disqualify it. As we know, Starrk's sword took the form of a little girl. Hollow powers are weird like that."
bleach,34odde,Andygoesrawr,3,Sun May 3 08:58:54 2015 UTC,Starrk's Hollow powers were in Lilynette. He still had his own sword.
bleach,34odde,clicker4721,5,Sun May 3 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"Aaroniero had a hand made of tentacles, and Hikifune has a giant spoon. They're still called Zanpakutou -- soul-cutting swords.  Starrk's actual sword was just a prop. The important part is pretty clearly that his powers, when sealed, took the form of a little girl, much like how Orihime's powers take the form of six fairies. She could pick up a sword that looks like an Asauchi too, but it wouldn't be relevant."

bleach,34odde,Saayem,2,Sun May 3 06:17:28 2015 UTC,"Superb explanation. Additionally, there could be more implications using fullbring in soul society/royal palace. Most of what we've seen of fullbringers were from users in their physical bodies. I think their powers will be enhanced in their spirit forms since their physical bodies were pretty much their biggest hinderance. That's how the reincarnated group will be able to still fight the quincies."

Getsuga is Ichigo's ability -- it's literally impossible for him to get any ability that isn't just a unique application of Getsuga. In this case, Juujishou means cross-shaped-piercer, which says, yes, it's just a regular Getsuga Tenshou in the shape of a cross.  But the point is that it means we might still get some new abilities from him."

bleach,34odde,Mekanimal,5,Mon May 4 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Imagine Ichigo's soul as a sphere, the sphere is filled with fluids that don't usually blend and when they're active, they start to glow. Now for one, if the Human portion and the Hollow portion blend (because a child was exposed in utero or a parent has remnants of Hollow energy in them which is transfered onto a child's soul) you get a Fullbringer. This example is most interesting for Ichigo because the fluids that make up the contents of the sphere, they naturally don't blend but for him they do, even those that are usually toxic to eachother (hollow vs quincy). Second, Spiritual Power in the bleach universe is an energy, a powersource which can be used to power a variety of abilities.  Hollows and thus Fullbringers are able to channel spiritual power that is stored in their soul and manifest it. Usually this transfers their ""essence"" into a mask that the Hollow wears and it subsequently manifests typical Hollow-attributes (hiero) and it allowes the Hollow to manipulate energy into kinetic waves (cero). More souls consumed/merged = more energy available = stronger attributes. The more powerful the spiritual power is the more unique the abilities become GENERALLY. Ultimately Fullbring & it's users utilize Hollow-esque powers in a mortal form by siphoning off souls to enhance their already considerable spiritual energy.  Now a Fullbringer has a living body, thus doesn't manifest the standard Hollow-attributes! Rather than that, they are able to pour their spiritual power into a totem to manifest certain Hollow powers, mostly unique one's rather than the standard one's (mostly a creative choice, this is sorta backwards to how Hollow's usually progress in power). Their most prominent shared attritubte is the ability to extract spiritual energy from the soul of any object/entity and manipulate it, when the target resonates with the Fullbringer it would be their totem and they can manipulate even it's shape (turn it into a blaster or a sword)!   Now for Ichigo's Fullbring, we've all seen his hollow powers multiple times, they're still in there despite Ichigo losing his connection to his Shinigami/Soulreaper powers (they wouldn't blend anymore, but were still there!)... Where previously his Hollow fluids blended with his Shinigami fluids to give him an outlet, now the Hollow part of him can blend with the human part too with a similar effect. Thus his sub-shinigami badge resonates with his power and thus becomes his Totem, he siphons it's soul and then releases his own spiritual power into it and manipulates it so it forms a sword, so to does his body become an extension of his Fullbring (manifesting pseudo-hiero).  As a Soul Reaper uses part of their soul to imprint on a blade and thus gain unique abilities so to do a Fullbring imprint on their totem, just not as permenantly.  Third and finally;   Human = Standard Human x Hollow = Fullbring Hollow x Shinigami = Visored Shinigami x Human = Gigai / Living person with spiritual pressure Quincy = Race of Human(oids?) with spiritual pressure (Homo Quinciens?!) Shinigami x Hollow x Human (Quincy) = Ichigo ... Quincy could be a subspecies of humans thus allowing Ichigo to go fullbring despite the natural toxic relationship between Quincy & Hollow energy."
bleach,34odde,Temperatia,6,Sun May 3 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"I think there needs to be a clear separation between Fullbringing (a human manipulating the souls of objects) and object affinity (a Fullbringer's ""totem""). When it comes to the totem they're drawing out Reiryoku inside the item, but for normal object manipulation there's no Reiryoku involved, as far as we know. The reason Reiryoku is involved for object affinity is because the user has imprinted on the object, effectively like a Shinigami does to an Asauchi.  When it comes to Ichigo's clad-type Fullbring, it's not that his body becomes an extension of his Fullbring, but that his Fullbring wraps around his body and projects itself outwards. For his entire body to be an extension of his power, he'd have to be using Resurreccion.  Regarding Quincies/humans: they're separate species of souls. Humans have their own distinct souls (so humans with powers are not part Shinigami, unless they're born Shinigami but even then their powers must be awakened), and Quincies theirs. The only thing they share is that they both have physical bodies (made of Kishi), which allows them to interbreed. Ichigo is able to have both Quincy and Hollow powers because of the human and Shinigami souls inside him, which create a natural vaccine against soul suicide."

However, I have no real basis for this belief other than (1) the soul king, as he is currently, seems unable entirely to exert his will.  It is unclear what caused this and for how long it has been so.  If it is, for whatever reason, in the nature of being the Soul King then I can hardly see our protagonist left to his fate and (2) Ichigo doesn't seem to be on the power level of either Aizen or Bach and I could see his role in the ultimate resolution not tied directly to his ""strength"" anyway.

bleach,34n9az,WhereIsMyMime,2,Sat May 2 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"It really could be anyone. Kyoraku approached Ichigo's spirit-sensitive friends a while back, saying that Ichigo may not be able to come back from the coming battle, implying he might die, his power would be too great to allow into the real world, even with a limiter, or even that he has been promoted to Spirit King. Then Kyoraku brings Aizen back from the depths of Muken, who seems like another likely candidate.

But we already had a sternritter with this exact power.  Other possibility would be a bankai that changed everything the person believes, not only what they see at that moment. But, again, we already had a character with that power (Tsukishima).  As eager as I am to see Aizen's bankai, I can't say for sure that we will see it someday.

bleach,34ne0b,WhereIsMyMime,2,Sat May 2 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe his bankai has some sort of hindrance/ flaw that Aizen simply doesn't like?  Kinda like how Soi Fon's bankai ended up being a heavy and flashy nuke. Or Unohana's healing shikai turning into....aoe acid?  In the end, zanpaktous reflect the weilders soul. So maybe his Bankai reflected the part of Aizen we didn't see yet?"

bleach,34ne0b,luciferella,3,Sun May 3 00:35:27 2015 UTC,I think that one is Candice Catnipp.
bleach,34ne0b,agentgreasy,2,Sun May 3 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"I dont  know her name, just picked her.  It should be on the flair list. Hard to find since there's so many  If it helps, she's on the 3rd row to the right. next to Renji"
bleach,34ne0b,AdituV,2,Sun May 3 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"Something that I have observed is that the bankai of the more complex Zanpaktuou have been somewhat disconnected from the original activated abilities.  The most absolutely clear example is Unohana's. During her fight with Kenpachi, the difference between shikai and bankai was life and death - you don't get any more polar than that.   While it is easy to associate the abilities of a hypothetical bankai, it could also be possible that while we know the ability we do not actually know the type. Confusion/false image/mind manipulation could be the result of a number of things.  I don't think Kubo would have such an OP as complete control though.  All that said - I think it's important to remember that Aizen has unspoken powers now. He is no longer the same ""person"" that obtained his shikai, and more importantly at arrest I would presume they would have destroyed it, especially given the fact that it was the entire cause of his initial deception success.   So in light of this, he may not even have a bankai - but he may not even need it."
bleach,34ne0b,Atukanuva,2,Sat May 2 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"I like to think that Aizen's bankai is complete control over a single person, at the cost of losing his shikai's abilities on all other targets.  To me, that also explains why he only seems to use his shikai: by using his smarts to manipulate people via their senses he can provoke pretty much any reaction he wants, rather than having to take direct control."

bleach,34ne0b,LoLKirukia,1 point,Sun May 3 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"From what we've seen so far it looks like her bankai just lets her use one aoe deep freeze when she releases it, kinda like Soi Fon. When she's in that new outfit that is fully white, she herself is also frozen and immobile, the only difference being that she is immune to death from cold temp just by itself."
bleach,34ne0b,unitedpath,1 point,Sun May 3 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"This is similar to my thought.  Yhwach noted that he lost track of time while he was conversing with Aizen, but Aizen's shikai has only been stated to affect the five general senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch).  I wonder if temporal manipulation/illusion is his bankai's ability, and possibly even spatial.  It would be massively OP, but it would expand on his shikai's abilities and fit into what we know he is capable of."
bleach,34ne0b,HomelessBoxBoy,1 point,Sun May 3 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that one result of his merger with the Hogyoku is that he lost his shikai, although I think there is still some debate about whether he retained its powers.    As stated prior, I think we'll either (1) never find out Aizen's bankai because its moot at this point or (2) a flashback will reveal that his Bankai was of the sort that could have been an enormous aid to his comrades but which placed his personal ambition at risk."
bleach,34ne0b,bigluck2k3,1 point,Sun May 3 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"I think his bankai is more like a complete sensory obliteration, he sends the target into a world of torment of his own creation.   For example, one person effected could be tormented and driven to insanity by images of their greatest fears, horrible creatures and brutal torture in an instant."
bleach,34ne0b,WhereIsMyMime,1 point,Thu May 7 19:58:41 2015 UTC,My theory is that kyoka suigetsu is his bankai. Remember at one point in the series they talk about Aizen showing off his abilities to all the lieutenants. It does get said that he took that opportunity to hypnotize all of them but what if he did show them whatever his shikai is not realizing he was already in bankai screwing with them. Just a thought

bleach,34jylv,fellatious_argument,9,Fri May 1 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"Her power is to reject reality because she herself rejects reality mentally. Like she ignores that her brother is dead and can't be with her, she ignores that she's super alone at home all the time because she's a fucking idiot and won't just move in with one of them, and she rejects the possibility of Ichigo not liking her, so she pretends she's already his gf without ever asking him. All kinds of shit.  So God was like ""Ok fine, that will be your power, you can literally make shit unhappen if you want it to."""

Still, execution is just too convenient for the one responsible for turning the shinigami into vizoreds. They should have held them as prisoners and investigate further. I mean, I know it's thanks to Aizen that they choose execution, but someone (other than Yoruichi) could've suspected that whole situation, right?  The Gotei is just too execution-happy sometimes."
bleach,34j5lf,assertiveguy,2,Sat May 2 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"It's a military organization, so following orders is something they are trained to do, even the captains are supposed to follow every order from the Central 46, hell, they've been doing it for over a thousand years.

bleach,34j5lf,Keranu,4,Fri May 1 20:43:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, what bugs me more is that Aizen chooses Hinamori to be stabbed. That was a missed opportunity to seriously harm a powerful enemy, like Shunsui, since he would have to fight against all other shinigami.  But I guess Hinamori is a blade magnet, so it can't be helped."

bleach,34j5lf,Plattbagarn,5,Fri May 1 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but choosing Hinamori did get the big guys fucked up. It was all psychological. Aizen knew getting Hinamori properly injured would drive Hitsugaya over the edge and made sure he was the one to do it.   That prompted Hitsugaya's blind rage attack which got him struck down. Then Kyoraku, Soifon and Hirako had no choice but to launch an attack; opening themselves up to being taken out."
bleach,34j5lf,FlaredPants,3,Sat May 2 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"Hinamori was barely conscious and unable to move. Shunsui would be able to dodge most, if not all of the attacks, and everyone might sense something off. Hinamori was basically a sitting duck (sorry Pernida Parkasdhfksjdhksjhgas).  If he created an illusion of Shunsui, he would have to do something about the real one.  Then again, all Aizen-taichou had to do was ask Hinamori to get stabbed, and she would do so of her own accord. Kyouka Suigetsu would really have been redundant."
bleach,34j5lf,aizen6,2,Sat May 2 09:43:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, why not just make them think Ichigo is him?"
bleach,34j5lf,Brainiac_Outcast,17,Sat May 2 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"Most of the Soul Society's mistakes are the result of the Central 46, which has no power of its own, attempting to maintain it's preeminent position on behalf of the nobility and prevent any meaningful reform or progress. That's why Aizen revolted, Urahara was exiled without trial, and, ultimately, why it was so easy for Aizen to manipulate the Rukia situation. The only thing that kept the Soul Society together was the fact Yamamoto (and his successor) willingly submit themselves to the Central 46.   As for the first point mentioned by OP, I'm going to say this was actually a masterstroke and not a blunder at all. Yamamoto played the Aizen crisis perfectly, the only thing that undid his plan in the end was that Aizen was hax. He allowed Ichigo to breach Hueco Mundo's defenses (suuuure Yamamoto believed Ichigo would stay put, it's not like he was working in close coordination with the guy who could get Ichigo to Hueco Mundo) and then sent in a strong expeditionary force. Mayuri could react to anything Hueco Mundo threw at him, Zaraki and Byakuya were good mid level captains with close relationships to the infiltrators, and Unohana was insurance. As a result of the invasion, Aizen lost a few Espada and chose to invade, knowing that the Gotei were divided. This is exactly what Yamamoto wanted: he had prepared the field of battle exactly to his liking. He even positioned his lieutenant outside the barrier to bring in his Visored allies. The trap was perfect: Aizen's Espada corps was slashed by over two thirds, the strongest captains were prepared, Karakura a Town was safe, the Visoreds were on board, and Mayuri was able to bring Ichigo and Unohana to the field.  If not for Hogyoku bullshit, Yamamoto's strategy would have demolished Aizen's rebellion in its tracks. Without the suffocating oversight of the Central 46, Yamamoto built a powerful alliance and thoroughly outmaneuver end his opponent.   But its's shonen so none of that mattered."
bleach,34j5lf,LuridofArabia,3,Fri May 1 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"I never noticed that before. Yamamoto is a great strategist, indeed."
bleach,34j5lf,assertiveguy,7,Sat May 2 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"If they're probably screwed against Aizen anyway, why pick the Captains who have no chance? Kenny one-shotting a bunch of friends by mistake? Byakuya AOEing the G13? Losing the brains behind the Squads if Mayuri dies? Losing the main healer who can bring Ichigo back if he gets screwed in HM? Nope, it was a wise choice. Their logic was to show them and figure out what they were doing so they could build counter plans... But yeah... Silly... They should have just sacrificed one member really quick... Like Renji... His Bankai was rubbish."
bleach,34j5lf,kwamzilla,3,Fri May 1 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"Byakuya has control over his zanpakto and would never ""AOE"" his allies unless he was under Aizen's influence, which wouldn't have been possible until released from Yamamoto's flame prison. Kenny wouldn't do that either, sure swing his arms carelessly and knock back allies but not slaughter them by mistake.  Half of this sounds like a joke but the other half sounds serious, and if it is a joke, i guess you got me. w/e."

About as level-headed and informed as decisions get.  The second is where they sacrifice the first Kenpachi to give the current Kenpachi a powerup, when both of them side-by-side could have shitted on the Quincies without the powerup at all.  The third is where the Royal Guard can help all the Gotei 13 captains become stronger, and instead choose to take Rukia along with them for some magical training. Keeping their training a secret from the Gotei didn't do the Guard any good, and they got their asses handed down to them.  The fourth is when Soul Society kicked out Urahara, because he's singularly responsible for saving their asses every time they shit in their pants."

bleach,34j5lf,kwamzilla,4,Fri May 1 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"By that time, all the Shinigami who had Bankai had one of Urahara's Shin'eiyaku, so the Bankai stealing medallion wouldn't work.  Besides, it would make more sense to take Kenpachi up there and have Ichibei ""rename"" him to Kenpachi, rather than have him kill Unohana for the title.  And if Renji became that strong after the Royal Realm training, Kyouraku and Ukitake would definitely help turn the tide against the Quincies (not that they might not be able to as they are now). I still wonder why they chose Rukia and Renji. Byakuya I can understand, because he needed ultra-modern medical access, and Ichigo because plotkai. But Rukia of all people. Maybe the Royal Guard deemed it unnecessary to heal or make Ukitake's condition better. Or they felt it useless to take Shiro-chan or Soifon, who could have benefitted more from the training. ~_~"
bleach,34j5lf,aizen6,3,Sat May 2 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Well, Renji could have his bankai stolen, but received training nonetheless. I don't think that 'not having an available bankai' was one of the criteria used during this selection."
bleach,34j5lf,assertiveguy,3,Fri May 1 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"This is kinda irrelevant, Urahara had already developed a way to hollow-fy their bankai's by the time the training ends..

bleach,34j5lf,luciferella,3,Sat May 2 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"1.Your first point has everything to do with Aizen manipulating things for years (slaughtering Central 46 btw and using his Complete Hypnosis to make everything seem normal). I could go more into this but ""because Aizen"" is good enough.  2.Two Kenpachi's does seem good (although a very gimped Zaraki compared to what we have know) but I don't think they could take out a freaking meteor. Even the Quincies were shitting themselves when that happened.  3.Maybe they could have taken more people with them, but perhaps it has to do with the fact that it isn't their job to protect the Seireitei. Also does it even matter in the end?? Yhwach and his goons slaughter the Royal Guards, I really don't think some slightly stronger captains are going to matter, they would just end up being more cannon fodder.  4.They work with Urahara a lot during the SS arc and Fullbring arc, AND the current arc. Pretty sure they dgaf about where he is anymore and it is Urahara that wants to stay in the human world."
bleach,34j5lf,AColdPotato,5,Sat May 2 05:59:19 2015 UTC,"I wrote here about Ichibei sort of helping Zaraki become stronger and gain his Shikai, without Unohana having to die. That way, they have both Nozarashi and Unohana.  I don't think Unohana and Zaraki would lose to the Schutzstaffel as easily as the Royal Guard did. Unohana was a first generation Gotei 13 captain, and nearly matches Yamamoto in terms of power. Besides, her powers didn't have many tricks associated with them, so countering them would be a hassle for the Quincy. Her skill was with the sword more than anything else. But that's just my opinion.  Still makes sense that they might not really care about the ""protecting Seireitei"" part as long as they can have a good fight.  The Royal Guard were screwed, but I'm still hopeful that Mayuri is the one that is going to take down Askin Nakk le Vaar, and maybe Shinji can screw the shooting guy.  It also seems sort of shameful of some of these Gotei 13 captains that are overly proud, when they have to go crying to a former captain that was dishonorably discharged. Yama-jii spoke a lot about the ""pride of a Captain,"" and Soifon and Byakuya also hinted stuff along those lines. And the one that almost always saves their hides is our shady sandal-wearing shopkeeper."

Unohana and Zaraki were were the 2 strongest captains besides Yama. If Aizen hypnotized them into thinking the other captains were the enemy then they would have devastated their ranks. If they were hypnotized in Hueco Mundo worst case senario 4 captains and some outsiders would have died but they probably would have done a decent amount of damage to the enemies aswell.  Sending Mayuri gave them the best chance of returning from Hueco Mundo in a timely manner. Plus any help he would have been in the FKT fight would come from his creations which they were still able to use without him actually being there.

If it made things more dense that would mean he was actually adding mass to the object/person without increasing the volume. In terms of zanpakuto it's easier to imagine one that effects the way gravity works on an object rather than one that adds more mass.   If it worked that way he would literally be adding more skin, blood, and bone cells to a person as he cut them without increasing a persons size and since cells are a set size that would make the person bigger.

bleach,34idhu,FieraDeidad,4,Fri May 1 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"Copy-paste from the last time a similiar thread came up:  Name: Arashi no Me (Eye of the Storm)    Command: Sora o Toriorose (Bring the sky crashing down)    Description: Before release, a regular wakizashi that's a couple of inches shorter than a katana, but the handle is 20-30% thicker than usual. On release, a thin strip from the middle of the blade dissipates and the two remaining halves bend further apart from each other, creating a tuning fork appearance. Should the need arise, the handle splits exactly in half to allow each blade to be wielded separately.  Shikai Ability: Redirection of spirit energy in to electrical current and circuiting it around the user's body. Pointing the blade directly at incoming energy attacks breaks them down, transforms them in to electrical current and passes them through the body, increasing the user's speed and reflexes while doing so, meaning that the more the opponent throws, the faster the user becomes. A clever way to take advantage of this ability is to cast Kido against your own blade, which forces the expended reiatsu to be collected around the user's body for the speed boost (though somebody would catch on to this pretty quick and prevent the trick being done often). Someone with overwhelmingly strong energy attacks would be able to overload the absorption process (can't break down + absorb fast enough to not take damage). The most important aspect is that all spiritual bodies release reiatsu passively unless they repress it on purpose. This means that, if the opponent is allowing their reiatsu to leak as they fight, the zanpakuto can feed on it, increasing the user's speed even if the opponent isn't firing energy attacks directly.  Bankai: Kaikenran (All-Seeing Tempest). 2 fingers are inserted in to the tuning fork's gap and flicked across the blades' length, coating it in blood. Lightning emitted from the zanpakuto becomes tainted a deep shade of red after the release is complete. Shihakushō ends up looking a bit like this with less decoration.The weapon itself extends to the length of a longsword (and can still be split apart for two thinner blades). The gap in the middle is now closed at the end, so there is a definitive tip when the blades are together. The remaining gap becomes opaque, thick with red electricity.  Bankai Ability: The weapon is now able to transform the reiatsu being emitted by the user's reiryoku directly in to the current that surrounds the user, massively increasing its potency. There is no longer a defined entry or exit point - reiatsu-based abilities will be converted no matter where they hit the user instead of just through the blades. Subsequently, the user can now send converted reiatsu outwards in its electrical form in any way they choose, as well as convert reiatsu hanging in the air and releasing it against an enemy immediately without going through the user directly. This effect extends as far as the user's reiatsu reaches. The most popular way to use it offensively for a quick kill is to point the blade at an enemy and beam out invisible reiatsu from the tip in the same way that clouds in the sky fire ""feeder"" bolts to create a circuit with the ground to discharge lightning. When that reiatsu connects, a circuit will be formed and the user immediately discharges a ton of electricity through the opponent's body, shredding them from the inside in an instant."

Adding weight to the blade as it slowly turns Crismon Red, adding destructive force as the blade fills from the hilt to tip.  Once filled, when I go Bankai, that excess weight is lifted and that blood is absorbed into my body. Allowing me to heal minor to major(nonlethal) damage. And my sword becomes lighter, making it seem like my swings get faster. Bankai does not add destructive force, it just lightens the blade and I can heal minor to major non life threatening damage. The more I heal and the crismon fades, the less destructive force my blade has, until it's at its most original level. This allows me to fight longer, and heal myself if necessary, as well as forcing me to rely more on my personal skills than swords ability.

bleach,34iw4s,Aaroniero,4,Fri May 1 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a tie between Quilge and BG-9. Quilge really did a good job showing us the power level of the Quincy: we knew already that a Quincy fighting with his full potential could be trouble even for a captain using bankai, thanks to that fight between Mayuri and Ishida. But Quilge told Ichigo that the technique used at that time is obsolete, and the Vollständig surpassed its effects. After that, it wasn't absurd to think that the new enemies could seriously harm the Gotei captains.  And BG-9... he's just cool. His fight against Soi-fon was one of my favorites in this arc. The action was good, BG-9's lines were badass, Soi-fon's lines were badass, hell, even Omaeda looked badass for a moment.  I'd say As Nodt is a solid second place in my list, too.

bleach,34gi4k,Madmeerkat55,3,Fri May 1 07:38:17 2015 UTC,"Golden Week (Japan):       Golden Week (ゴールデンウィーク, Gōruden Wīku ?), often abbreviated to GW, is a Japanese term applied to the period containing the following public holidays:   April 29 The Emperor's Birthday (天皇誕生日, Tennō Tanjōbi ?), until 1988  Greenery Day (みどりの日, Midori no Hi ?), from 1989 until 2006  Shōwa Day (昭和の日, Shōwa no Hi ?), from 2007  May 3 Constitution Memorial Day (憲法記念日, Kenpō Kinenbi ?) May 4 Citizen's Holiday (国民の休日, Kokumin no Kyūjitsu ?), from 1985 until 2006 Greenery Day (みどりの日, Midori no Hi ?), from 2007  May 5 Children's Day (こどもの日, Kodomo no Hi ?), also customarily known as Boys' Day (端午の節句, Tango no Sekku ?).   Note that ""kokumin no kyūjitsu"" or ""citizen's holiday"" is a generic term for any official holiday. May 4 was until 2007 an unnamed but official holiday because of a rule that converts any day between two holidays into a new holiday. May Day is not a public holiday. Instead, Japan has Labour Thanksgiving Day, a holiday with a similar purpose. When a public holiday lands on a Sunday, the next day that is not already a holiday becomes a holiday for that year.  In some cases, a Compensation Holiday (振替休日, Furikae Kyūjitsu ?) is held on either April 30 or May 6 should any of the Golden Week holidays fall on Sunday; 2012, 2013, and 2014, have had Compensation Holidays for Shōwa Day, Children's Day, and Greenery Day, respectively, and 2015 will have Constitution Memorial Day fall on Sunday, requiring another consecutive year with a Compensation Holiday.

bleach,34hk7n,I_Am_From_Mars_AMA,2,Fri May 1 07:12:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think one of the most fun things about bleach is all of the different races. Human, Fullbringer, Shinigami, Quincy, Hollow/Arrancar/Espada, etc. (Also Bounts, evolved mod souls, and etc if you want to get into filler stuff.)  I think that if you want to make your own bleach fan-arc, you should consider coming up with your own race (possibly as an enemy). It'd be fun as hell too come up with all of the specifics, and I think that would also interest a lot of people.  It would also allow for a LOT of creative freedom, seeing as how every single race has their own unique releases/powers. You could come up with their theme, appearances, the realm they live in, their goals, how their powers/releases work, etc. Plus you could give them a new language theme too (like german for quincy, spanish for hollow, etc.)  Just my 2 cents. I know I personally would have fun coming up with all of that. Even if you don't do that I'd still be interested in reading it."

While the title ""The Voodoo Doll Arc"" has a more metaphorical meaning to the arc's plot, I do plan on incorporating French and Haitian themes into the main story's arc. I will also be bringing in a new race, though I'm more tight lipped on those specific details as I'm still molding them to be more detailed.   But yes, I do agree. I enjoy having the creative freedom to bring something fresh to the table, especially with such a rich and vibrant universe like Kubo has made."

The extra chapter about Hell isn't necessarily canon since the other events related to it never happened in the main story line.   There's also Komamura and his clan.

bleach,34if5n,firagaga,2,Sat May 2 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say a tentative 'yes' to the Fullbringers retaining their powers, because:  A) Plot reasons. They wouldn't be very interesting to Kubo if they were powerless souls who developed new powers which needed an explanation arc... again.  B) Giriko retains his eyepatch even in soul form, which is a direct consequence of his Fullbring. Normally a dead human would be reborn into an intact spiritual body, so to still be missing an eye implies its transference.  As for the Arrancars, through the non-canon movie spinoffs Kubo seems to have confirmed that dead Arrancar go to hell. This is contradicted, however, by the established lore in the first series. You only pay for the sins committed as a human, and not as a hollow. Moreover, Arrancars are not individual souls at all but the bastard child of hundreds or thousands combined. One dominant soul surfaces, yes, but the rest probably wouldn't be judged guilty for that soul's crimes. Finally, the first series established that hollows destined for hell don't simply disintegrate, but are dragged into hell by gatekeepers."

You should do your homework on whose covering the topic (KID)  And the cost of running the company are null and void. When it's based in China to begin with, with ghosted IP's. And what hell are you talking about publisher lol.....You think they got Tite to sign off on this? At least know a little about how these games run. Before you go saying things you literally know anything about.  What cost would there be for a company running out of China? Almost nothing because US law doesn't govern it. So for it to adhere to the dollar like it does. It's basically bullshit companies get away with. Because no law exist for that on the internet."

bleach,34f7qh,unitedpath,8,Thu Apr 30 17:23:28 2015 UTC,Shunsui has a plan.   I agree. Although I think his overall laid-back personality makes it seem like he's always 10 steps ahead.    Zero Division was never about strength.   I disagree. The Zero Division are definitely more powerful than beloved Capitanes. But Yhwach is more powerful. Simple. I think that was Kubo's point.
bleach,34f7qh,Aaroniero,3,Thu Apr 30 17:53:19 2015 UTC,Shunsui seemed relaxed before and during the final fight with aizen.
bleach,34f7qh,rogrogrickroll,8,Thu Apr 30 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"As for Soi Fong getting embarrassed during the initial encounter, she was never one of the more powerful Captains. She was easily overtaken by Yoruichi even in bankai.   I don't believe Soi Fong ever used her Bankai against Yoruichi. Granted, if she did, it would certainly slow her down. So granted, it's possible? But during their only canon fight (SS-arc), she was using her Shikai.   Personally, I don't buy that he has a great or immense power that he keeps hiding and I don't think the fact that he's arguably the smartest guy in SS indicates as much.   I agree that he doesn't have some immense power. But I feel that his Bankai could be incredibly dangerous in the right situations. Much like I feel Shunsui's will be."

bleach,34f7qh,WhereIsMyMime,2,Fri May 1 03:58:53 2015 UTC,I believe that was Shunsui that said that.
bleach,34f7qh,thenewperson1,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:17:48 2015 UTC,It was Shunsui who said that.
bleach,34f7qh,tazzerer,7,Fri May 1 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"1) Shunsui has a plan. Despite everything Shunsui seems as confident as ever. He took precautions with Aizen, but only those demanded by Central. In all contexts, he speaks of what they will do ONCE they save Seireitei not IF. The situation currently seems to concern him only a little more than Starrk did, the primera espada who Shunsui defeated with his shikai.   Shunsui responds to emotional distress, not danger. So, until Nanao gets blasted to piece, we probably won't see him come undone again.   2) Aizen does not. Power seems to have broken him. He's sort of following along and willing to let his power do the work for him, which has failed him twice already. Unless there is some change coming up shortly I can see him ending up cursed with his greatest desire - he is transformed in some manner into the soul king, a being who in its current state seems unable to exert its will at all.   Aizen doesn't have a plan, but he's still a genius. So, he will always be a threat because Shunsui keeping him is like a chimpanzee trying to keep a human restrained.   3) Zero Division was never about strength. The zero division seems now to have been based only on those whose abilities allowed them to best serve Seireitei and the Soul King from above and removed from the fray, almost as if they were too valuable to be placed in the danger of ordinary combat. For instance, while it seems clear that the Monk's ability would have given him the edge over Yamamoto, the Captain Commander appears to possess the more brutal destructive force. As for Soi Fong getting embarrassed during the initial encounter, she was never one of the more powerful Captains. She was easily overtaken by Yoruichi even in bankai.   That could be one reason for it. They were removed from normal service and given the Ouken to ensure that they could continue to offer the services they provide. While others can imitate their inventions, no one can perfectly reproduce the Zero Division's inventions.   So, Soul Society would suffer greatly from the loss of any of the Royal Guard members."
bleach,34f7qh,Temperatia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of another point: Shunsui hasn't even acknowledged Ukitake going down, which makes me think there's hope there yet."
bleach,34f7qh,Temperatia,2,Fri May 1 01:30:24 2015 UTC,"Shunsui already knew about the Kamikake. So, he knew Ukitake was, most likely, going to go down.  Though, I'm sure Shunsui realizes that it's well within Mayuri's ability to save Ukitake. Which is why he's not worried about him. Shunsui has a lot of faith, maybe too much, in Mayuri's abilities."
bleach,34f7qh,Zil_v_a,3,Fri May 1 01:40:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. Shinsui seems to have came up with something. I mean, he did give away his master and then his best buddy to this war already, I wouldn't expect him to still count for good luck.  Aizen seems like he could have a plan, but it's hard to tell what does he want. We've been never told why did he want the palace and right now he seems sort of...depressed? I won't be surprised if he will willingly offer himself as the next imprisoned soul king. Then Ichigo opposes him and says something cool about a new world, better future or some other inspirational stuff.   Urahara just wants to win. There are some people that suspect him to have shady plans, but in the end all he wanted was to keep the place afloat. I expect him to turn into some drastic measures near the end of the arc. He will probably want to preform some lesser evil as his final measure, which will lead to him facing off against someone from the main team. I'd expect him to lose.  The other thing I would expect would be Urahara and Aizen teaming up and winning, but then turning out to be good guys in the end."
bleach,34f7qh,Fred_MK,2,Thu Apr 30 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"I will have to call nonsense on the ""3) Zero Division was never about strength"": It was stated a long time ago that their powers added were atleast on pair with the whole Soul Society. Also, Oetsu and Ichibei are clearly not all talk.  I do agree on the other points thou, Urahara seems to be just a piece in this game unlike the last arcs with Aizen going with the flow and Kyouraku over-confident atitude."
bleach,34f7qh,aizen6,2,Fri May 1 02:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yhwach mentioned that Yamamoto from 1000 years back was a truly fearsome Shinigami; he never made any such statement about Ichibei. Throughout his fight, he only spoke of Ichibei's powers being no match for his own.  I personally feel that as a combatant, Yamamoto had the upper hand against Yhwach that others didn't. Ok, the Royal Guard are stronger than the 13 Divisions, but that doesn't mean that individually, the Royal Guard members are stronger than Yamamoto. When we say ""13 Divisions,"" we're also including people like Soifon, Hitsugaya, Komamura etc. and that brings the average power level down.  Of all the Bankais of all the Shinigami, Yhwach chose to steal Yamamoto's, not Ichibei's. I think that alone should speak for how unique a Shinigami Yamamoto was considered by Yhwach.  Now, being trained by Yamamoto, Shunsui might have a similar advantage/hidden power that could turn the tide of the battle. I'm calling it (as are many others) - he's one of the Special War Powers."
bleach,34f7qh,rickdousey,-1,Fri May 1 06:48:13 2015 UTC,He stole Yamma's Bankai because it happened before he got to the Royale Palace.  Plain and simple.   He dispatched Yamma in seconds plain and simple.   Ichibee without his bankai stood in Ywatch's way and held his own a lot more than Yamma did.   Yamma claimed he was all powerful... Did we ever once see anything indicating he was on a level he claimed? Even once?   If he was so powerful would he depend so much on his bankai?   Against Aizen he couldn't even face him even when he went all kamikaze on him all he did was ruffle his clothes a bit while Ichigo's dad took Aizen to his limit (without his bankai either I might add)   Ichigo's dad was stronger than Yamma without their Bankai's so how are we to believe anything Yamma says.   A lot of military leaders in history have exaggerated their power to maintain order and obedience.
bleach,34f7qh,aizen6,3,Fri May 1 11:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Ichibei is weaker than Yama-jii. I'm merely saying that Yama-jii was someone even Yhwach feared (i.e. the Yamamoto from 1000 years ago). In Bleach, powers don't scale like ""A"" beats ""B"" and ""B"" beats ""C"" so ""A"" beats ""C.""  Yama-jii is by no means weak. It's just that more often than not, situations didn't let him use his full potential. He was concerned about damaging fake Karakura town, and hence lost to Aizen-taichou. Ichibei fought in a pretty open space with nothing to distract him or make him hold back.  Besides, every single person in the series that fought Yama-jii (i.e. powerful guys like Aizen-taichou and Yhwach) chose to seal or limit his Zanpakutou in order to get the upper hand. I think that alone speaks for how much they fear his abilities.  Ichibei and all the other guys had the advantage of information and situation that Yama-jii didn't have.   Did we ever once see anything indicating he was on a level he claimed? Even once? If he was so powerful would he depend so much on his bankai?   He dispatched Wonderweiss with his bare hands, and Wonderweiss punched a gaping hole through Ukitake. If, by your logic, powers scale linearly, Yamamoto is stronger than every other captain in the Gotei 13 (since Ukitake was the strongest alongside Shunsui). And we know that Kirio Hikifune had her time in the Gotei, and Shunsui/Jushiro still held the title of strongest captains. That makes it clear that all of the Royal Guard aren't stronger than Yama-jii. He also took down 3 Sternritter as if it was nothing. And burned a fourth right down to his bones. And defeated Ayon with just his sealed Zanpakutou, and burned Harribel's fraccion to a crisp using just his reiatsu flames.  Ichigo's dad fought Aizen-taichou without restraint because there's no evidence that he would destroy the fake town and bring back the original if he let loose. Yama-jii had that restraint. And he had his own Zanpakutou powers used against him. Isshin was pretty much free to use all his powers in a way Yama-jii wasn't. And Aizen-taichou didn't use his Complete Hypnosis against Isshin, Urahara or Yoruichi, but he did against Yama-jii.  Aizen-taichou himself claimed that his fighting abilities paled in front of Yama-jii. And he cut down half of Gotei 13 without breaking a sweat. The only one he had to plan for in advance was Yama-jii.  Ichigo's dad was never stronger than Yama-jii. I don't think anyone in Seireitei even compares to Yama-jii. The moment Yama-jii was enraged after killing Driscoll Berci, the Shinigami were all in high spirits, and the moment he died, the Quincy pretty much started shitting on all of them. He's safeguarded Seireitei for over 1000 years, and I don't think you can do that if you're not powerful enough. Just his death alone was enough to turn the tide against the Shinigami in the current arc.  Besides, official ratings show that only Aizen-taichou had power equalling Yama-jii. Ok, Yama-jii was an arrogant blockhead. But that's far from being called weak. A careless Shikai attack was enough to shit on 3 Sternritter who trashed Byakuya, Hitsugaya and Rose (??). At that point in the storyline, who else had the power to face the Sternritter and win with Shikai alone? I doubt if Isshin would have fared any better than any of the other captains.  Let's face it. Even Yhwach feared Yama-jii at some point in time, and all he did was make fun of the Royal Guard (who, we might add, got offscreened worse than fodder). Besides, we all know Urahara, Kyouraku and Ukitake are going to set the situation right, so by that logic, they're stronger (or at the very least, more effective) than the Royal Guard. These guys were hyped for a decade and got offscrceened before I could blink."
bleach,34f7qh,Lariasio,2,Fri May 1 12:20:17 2015 UTC,"My only problem with the comment that ""the five squad zero members powers combined are greater than that of all of the 13 court guard squads"" is that it doesn't actually disprove what I hinted at.  Of course they are very powerful...just not the five MOST powerful.  Several moments from the Manga (I can do some lifting on this if anyone is skeptical) seem to indicate that the Captains and Lieutenants so far outclass the normal rabble that I think it could reasonably be asserted that any five of the Captains could pretty much eliminate the 13 court guard squads in a battle with no captains.  Yamamoto, who may believe too strongly in his own power, seems to intimate that if he wanted to he could probably accomplish such a task on his own.    Frankly, Ichibei's power (supposing it can ever do what he says it will - the fight with Yhwach made no sense at that point) could probably defeat them all with his renaming ability.  BUT in terms of destructive force, I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out Shunsui, Byakuya and Kenpachi all have a greater ability to inflict direct harm (I only list Byakuya because Ichibei hinted that his power grew tremendously as a result of his time with the zero division.    Also, two things that aren't clear but I think are likely:  1) Uryu is Bach's weakness.  Some circumstance seems to have required Yhwach to share his shrift with someone and, for whatever reason, Uryu was that person.  Ichigo's ability to defeat Bach will be hinged on convincing Uryu to betray him - I just don't see Ichigo overpowering him in a straight fight.  2) Zero Division won't stay dead.  In the same way that Ichigo raised Ichibei, I see no reason Ichibei couldn't raise Zero Division.  I kind of hope this one isn't true, however, because at Kubo's pace reintroducing these guys probably extends the arc 40 chapters."

bleach,34f7qh,rainea,1 point,Fri May 1 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"Here's mine:  All Urahara really knew was whatever he did in the secret ninja clan, and the shit involving aizen's plans and Ichigo's family, along with his knowledge of science. He never knew the forbidden jutsu, or about the true nature of the SK, or any of that shit. And it's not that this plans were falling apart, his plan was to get the most powerful people up to SK to fight Ywach and hopefully save the world, and he did that so far. He never knew for sure they'd win, but he was betting on it, hoping his people were stronger than the bad guys. His plans didn't go beyond that. All of his surprised looks are just him experiencing the shit that he was afraid would happen, that him and his people are in over there hands and only a power much stronger than him will be the one to determine everyone's fate, not themselves.  Shunsui isn't more intelligent than Urahara or anyone, it's just that he's been entrusted with more secrets and access to more powerful shit than other people because of his age and rank. It's all about security clearance and trust and all that. He doesn't have an ultimate plan either, really, he's just more sure that he has the tools necessary to defeat Bach, namely Aizen and Ichigo working together. What he thinks he knows is that Aizen has no upper limit, but at least he can keep him contained, to an extent, and Ichigo has enough power to be in a god tier himself to at least help Aizen if it turns out he's not the strongest being himself (which he probably is, because maybe true power is all about how strong your emotions are, and the stronger your emotions are the more you resonate with all the soul energy in existence and all that shit). He's not sure if Aizen's at a level to fight Bach without totally dying before he can activate his evolution shit to make him stronger than Bach, though he might be. He's going for the worst case scenario that if it's even possible, it will take every single person they have to overpower him, so he's bringing every powerful person with him. It makes sense to be so sure when you're literally giving it everything you've got to win this time.  They know that ultimately the cards are in God's hands. They must know that Bach isn't the ultimate power in existence, he's just a dropling from a higher being. They know he's not the oldest thing. At most he's a fallen angel type of thing, either created by God to test everyone's power and resolve to see if they have what it takes to watch over all the realms, or he is something that formed on its own due to some anomaly within the big flow of soul energy swirling between the realms, but it's all just appendages that are part of the bigger living consciousness that is the true god of the universe, something much bigger that created the SK itself, and it's well of aware of its existence, but it knows or has the power (because it controls every particle in the world) to give the Shinigami team the power to stop it."

I am convinced that some power inherent to all souls put into Soul Society leads to the development of Shinigami powers, since they are a very specific set of powers that are shared between all Shinigami regardless of training or aptitude, and it would make a lot of sense for these powers to come from the Soul King's essence in some way. Something similar could happen to Hollows since the SK controls the flow of all souls into all realms. That's certainly how Quincy powers work using Juha's essence.

I really don't understand what you're getting at. We know for a fact that the Hougyoku has a will of its own, and we already know what happens when its will clashes with the will of its ""master"".  There's no reason to think Urahara and Aizen would need to overpower one of the Soul King's limbs to create the Hougyoku. All they had to do was harness its power, and it allowed them to do so. It's exactly the same as Mimihagi-sama being transferred into Ukitake's lungs, but in this case they were transferred into orbs.   There are hints towards disproving this, the biggest one would be the ""castle refuge"" or Wandenreich built by the Quincy's under Soul Society.  The fact that Quincy's retreated in a ""secret bunker underneath the castle"" like king's in ages past would of done in times of siege totally disproves the fact that the Quincy's came from Human realm, which if i'm not mistaken was only stated by very low ranking shinigami and repeated by i think Hytsugaya or a Vice-liutenant. You can consider that Shinigami Propaganda   Yhwach himself stated that Quincies came from the human realm and hid within the shadows of Seireitei in order to escape the Shinigami, because at the time all of the most powerful Shinigami were in the human realm slaughtering the Quincies."
bleach,34e56f,luciferella,0,Thu Apr 30 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand what you're getting at.   I'm trying to say that , yes the Hougyoku may have had a will of it's own , but that it was acting according to SK's backup Keikaku and it allowed both Aizen and Urahara to harness it's power .  Again i'm talking about things that are far from confirmed.   Yhwach himself stated that Quincies came from the human realm .   Quincy's are ""blessed human's"" so yes they're origin may place them from the human realm.  But that doesn't mean anything since we wore discussing they're role in soul society(before the war with the shinigami) not they're origins.  As i see it they wore fighting shinigami in the human realm, losing the battle , lost it then they've retreated into Soul Society's shadows(Sort of like how King's and the nobility wore retreating in their safety bunker in times of siege) then the shinigami brought the battle to they're place , won , and replaced they're system with a new SK .  Otherwise i wouldn't see the point of this page   Now you understand what i'm trying to say?"

But I don't understand why you're saying that the Hougyoku couldn't be from the Soul King's limb, when the traits that you're applying to the Hougyoku are canonically applied to the Soul King's limbs and vice versa...   Quincy's are ""blessed human's"" so yes they're origin may place them from the human realm. But that doesn't mean anything since we wore discussing they're role in soul society not they're origins.   Yes, but Yhwach said that they invaded Seireitei because the Shinigami had left Seireitei.  We know for a fact that Quincies initially came from the human realm, and they lived there until the war, when they were forced to hide inside Seireitei's shadow. For the Quincies to have owned Soul Society before the Shinigami, basically everything we've been told in this arc would have to be retconned. It doesn't make sense for Kubo to have characters like Yhwach explain these things to us if they're later shown to be false. What would Yhwach gain from lying about that to Shinigami, who are already told that? It can't be Shinigami propaganda if it's from Yhwach's mouth."
bleach,34e56f,Alluka-,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"when the traits that you're applying to the Hougyoku are canonically applied   I didn't understood you at first but now i can see it being as how you explained it .  I didn't find it necessary for a whole limb to be forming the Hougyoku , i felt it was an overkill for it to be that way, but i can see it happening. Also it would of been impossible for Aizen to control or harness it power since he was going against Soul Societies best interests(or was he? :D) , as with Urahara he didn't bother using it as he was to afraid of it's power so the limb/hougyoku had no interest in staying in his way.    It doesn't make sense for Kubo to have characters like Yhwach explain these things to us if they're later shown to be false.   Yah but maybe we are misunderstanding the event's a little and the different translations we have available ain't helping us, also Kubo like's a lot to twist words.   For ex. Mangapanda uses the word Escape which literally confirms that the Quincy indeed had soul society occupied back then aswell , cause One simply doesn't just  escape into enemy territory , you know .   While mangastream uses the word fled ,which is more in tune with what we know now about the former (shinigami-quincy) war.  Idk but this whole incident is super confusing; also Kubo didn't give an exact timeline to when was Wanderreich built. It implies that they've built a whole dimension under the shinigami's nose without them detecting it, which i find very implausible . The stronger shinigami may have been in the human world but the fodder one's would of stayed home ?! they could of noticed something !!! Either way Ywhach's description of the event's seem very fishy   What would Yhwach gain from lying about that to Shinigami   Maybe he's not lying and that's is what he is remembering , but what he is remembering may not be the exact truth.   I suspect Yhwach may be one of those limbs , so we don't know how accurate his memories are , and remember! Yamamoto hit his head so hard 1000 years ago that he lost everything , not just his conscious"
bleach,34e56f,yooooowtf,4,Thu Apr 30 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"I like the theory that one of the chi babies was discovered and experimented on. We know that Aizen (maybe Urahara's?) incomplete hogyoku needed lots of souls.   An individual chi baby might not be powerful, but once fed with lots of souls it's not too far fetched to think it'll grow in power.  Kinda like Baby Yhwach"

bleach,34e56f,t3hjs,5,Thu Apr 30 13:01:28 2015 UTC,That foreshadowing though.  Is it just a coincidence that both Aizen and Kisuke are the only ones who have created and used the Hogyoku? We know Aizen has plans having to do with the Royal Palace/Soul King.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if Kisuke was in on Aizen's plan from the beginning and just acted the part. Cannot wait to see when he becomes a central plot point.

bleach,34e56f,yukeake,2,Thu Apr 30 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah ever since his fight with Gremmy it was clear that Yachiru was the manifestation of his sword.   Chapter 577  He finally calls out the name of his sword and we Yachiru remembering back to when they first met. She had no name, wasn't afraid of Zaraki, the dead bodies or the blood everywhere.  The only thing about her being a manifestation of Nozarashi is the fact that she had her own Zanpakuto. Actually re-reading the theory and looking at the panels, it's possible that Sanpo Kenju (Yachiru's Shikai) could be Zaraki's Bankai. Here's Isane saying that the ability is unheard of: Chapter 572  It's definitely a plausible theory and one of the better ones in my opinion.  Here is a post made by someone when the chapter was released a while back. http://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/24y64i/spolilers_the_kenpachi_yachiru_theory/"
bleach,34e56f,Jellye,4,Thu Apr 30 13:45:56 2015 UTC,This is just a theory right? We have no canonical confirmation of this?
bleach,34e56f,Seri55,3,Thu Apr 30 14:21:28 2015 UTC,Correct. No confirmation.
bleach,34e56f,Reddude37,3,Thu Apr 30 14:29:05 2015 UTC,"I saw a theory that said Yachiru's zan ability was that of the Shinigami Zaraki stole the blade from and as his power began to reshape it into Nozarashi, Yachiru was forced out, so when he called out Nozarashi, she was completely forced out of existence... or something like that. It was from a while ago"
bleach,34e56f,Seri55,3,Thu Apr 30 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"I suspect that both Aizen and Urahara came to the same invention/conclusion, from different sides of the issue.  Aizen was looking for something to give him the power of the SK, or power that rivals that of the SK.  He wanted to displace the SK, as evidenced by his little speech at the end of the SS arc.  Urahara's intentions are less clear - however, based on circumstantial evidence, I suspect he was also looking the replace the SK - though with an artificial creation, rather than himself.  Note that when confronted by Aizen about the SK, he looks almost regretful?  Like he accepts that this is the way things have to be, but he's not happy with it either?  And then we see the SK itself later - helpless and seemingly imprisoned in a crystal.  My thought is that Urahara was looking to create something like an artificial SK - something that could preserve the ""balance"" of the worlds, without needing to ""imprison"" ""someone"" (not getting into the ""are mod-souls people"" debate ;P ).  Now, the actual process by which the ""core"" of each was created isn't known - just that they needed to be ""fed"" souls (and eventually, Aizens was fed Urahara's).  Whether they're based around a ""limb"", or something else isn't known.  It seems unlikely to me that one of the ""chi-chi"" beings would be the core, as it looks like they're something of a side effect of the SK's power overflowing its vessel.  Prior to Yhwach's usurption, I'm not sure there was an overflow.  Unless...blind-baby-Yhwach was also one of those things initially?  (This whole thing starts looking too much like Gremlins for my comfort. ""Don't feed Yhwach after midnight!"")"

I've been thinking that the Hogyoku was another part of the SK ever since we saw Mimihagi-sama too, but it was just a wild guess for me.  Now, what you found there is actually pretty strong evidence.

I don't have the ratings data in my back pocket, but I would expect that Bleach was rating a lot lower at the time of its cancellation than Fairy Tail or Gintama.  Anyway, a revival didn't make those series any less cancelled in the first place. Going back to my original comment in the thread and my note of ""unless TV Tokyo has a major change of heart"" - that's essentially what happened to these other series that returned after cancellation.

Of the two assumptions we're potentially making here (that the series' absence means it's cancelled or that the series' absence means it's ""on hold""), the most reasonable one is that it's cancelled.  Series don't go ""on hold"" in Japan for years at a time without notice. It's the hiatus theory that has the burden of proof here, not the cancellation one.  It's cancelled. We could have a whole other argument about whether there's even a difference between ""cancelled"" and ""on hold indefinitely""."

bleach,34c3qm,CptSprinkles5,7,Wed Apr 29 23:28:13 2015 UTC,I don't think there's going to be anything special about ukitake and shunsuis sword pair. Shunsui is probably just an asauchi with duality in the sense of gamesmanship. We've seen that he can be affected by his own sword games.
bleach,34c3qm,Ichinine,3,Thu Apr 30 00:29:48 2015 UTC,Ukitake probably has a +/- duality nature.
bleach,34c3qm,boredguy12,3,Thu Apr 30 07:45:36 2015 UTC,He also had the arm of the soul king in him. Two souls = two swords? The reflective nature of his ability perhaps has to do with the 'protection' he was granted as a child?

Ukitake's Zanpakutou is different on its own way, because in his basic form there's only one sword, the other appears after shikai release, however Kyoraku's Zanpakutou is a dual blade type with two different swords in basic form that turn into the same type of swords after shikai."

bleach,34dj37,Aaroniero,2,Thu Apr 30 11:59:30 2015 UTC,"If what we have seen the RG do so far is all they are capable of doing (although highly unlikely), then, compared to Yamamoto, they're all trash (maybe Ichibei can beat him with high difficulty).  Now I see why aizen was so sure that he'd succeed in taking the RG down by himself."
bleach,34dj37,FateBender,2,Thu Apr 30 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an interview with Kubo where we stated that Yamamoto could have been in the Royal Guard- so I guess that means that he's at worst as strong as they are.  However, based on how events have played out, it seems like 'Eye Ball Monk' is stronger than Yamamoto, but Yamamoto seems to be stronger than the rest of the Royal Guard. That's just my thoughts though."
bleach,34dj37,tom-the-lawn,2,Thu Apr 30 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"Yama is probably stronger than all except Ichibei. That one would be something like ""reduce all creation to ash, uh what was your name again?"""
bleach,34dj37,shiba_keikaku,5,Fri May 1 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"This ultimately goes into something far more than just Yama vs Royal Guard.   Bleach has always been a big game of Rock Paper Scissors when it comes to who can beat who.   The powers are so unique and so diverse that its extremely difficult to say who is really stronger...   It doesn't seem like any of the Royal Guard are stronger than Yama-ji, but we've only seen one of their Bankai's and they were sent to be Royal Guard for reasons other than simply being ""strong""  This isn't like DBZ where it was clear in every fight who had the upper hand.   When it comes down to it, the one who has the stronger Reiatsu generally is the winner... I'd wager that Yama-ji's Reiatsu is stronger than anyone we've seen. Including Ichigo's post Dangai.   Post Dangai Ichigo was strong enough so that people couldn't feel his reiatsu, but Yama's was so powerful that it would burn SS to ashes if he didn't control it...   Seems like he'd be stronger."
bleach,34dj37,Mr_Xing,10,Thu Apr 30 13:07:38 2015 UTC,People couldnt feel ichigos reiatsu because it was on another level. How can you perceive 5D when you only live in a 4D world? Pretty sure post dangai ichigo is bar none the most powerful character in the series.
bleach,34dj37,rogrogrickroll,7,Thu Apr 30 18:10:57 2015 UTC,I agree. Post dangai ichigo showed no weakness at all. He toyed with evolved aizen. I doubt yama wud be able to keep up
bleach,34dj37,bursilym,2,Thu Apr 30 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"I'm also of the opnion that Yamamoto had the strongest reaitsu in the series.  I also imagine that, politically speaking, he was probably pretty much treated on the same level as the Royal Guard - being the Capitan Commander and all that."
bleach,34dj37,Jellye,9,Thu Apr 30 14:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think Yama is the same level as RGs but Yama's special talent was ""Aggressive power"". He isn't suited for a role of guarding a dude. He is more likely to be a Head of an army, that's why he was the head of gotei."
bleach,34dj37,Shunsui_for_CC,0,Thu Apr 30 14:30:48 2015 UTC,"Not so sure about that... Remember a Bankai increases the strength of the shinigami like ten fold so without it they are ten rides weaker.   Aizen has zero problems with Yamma once he sealed his sword.   Meaning that being equal (neither using their Bankai)  Aizen was stronger than Yamma even while Aizen was still only in shinigami form.   In contrast Ichigo's dad (also without bankai)  took Aizen to his shinigami limit and forced him to evolve for the first time.   Further evidence of Yamma not being so strong as the royal gaurd is that when Ywatch stole his Bankai(not his shikai,  he still had use of this) he completely obliterated Yamma in seconds.   Yamma is said to have the strongest zanpakuto but a lot of leaders in history have exaggerated their greatness to inspire obedience and order.   His Zan may have been powerful as hell so maybe it multiplied his strength 20 times instead of 10 when in Bankai but still at his Base strength he wasn't even as strong as Aizen or Ichigo's dad so they end up being more even if all are in Bankai.   Too many people get caught up in his boasts of how hot and powerful his flames are but never really showed any tremendous power against any real enemy.  I'd say the Royal gaurd were stronger,  well at least Ichibee and maybe one Oetsu"
bleach,34dj37,rickdousey,8,Thu Apr 30 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"aizen didnt stand a chance against yama, and he knew it.  yama just plain stomped on aizen when they fought - tanking swoord hits that took out captains in one blow, allowing him to catch the real aizen. then, as his zanpakto get's hard countered by a arrancer specifically designed to kill him, he takes that one out with his fists alone. then he tanks all of his own really strong condensed flames that would have obliterated an area far larger than karakura town.  does that get him down? nope. he proceeds to sacrifice his arm because aizen shows an opening, forcing him to back off.  it's pride that killed yama in the end - not restoring his arm, unwillingness to involve the human world in their fight, not using his soldiers as disposable tools. aizen would most liekly have been instagibbed against zanka no tachi - but that'd also destory a large part of the human world. if he were fully powered with both his arms, he'd have fought better against ywacy, and if instead going after him for vengeance he would have waited it out a bit until the real ywach showed himself he might have stood a chance against him.  as for how he stands compared to the royal guard, eh haven't seen nearly enough of the royal guard to judge that properly. i think he'd actually stand a very good chance against ichibei if his bankai woudl burn the ink before it can touch and weaken him."
bleach,34dj37,zelatorn,0,Thu Apr 30 15:33:53 2015 UTC,Him taking out Wonderweiss with his fists means what exactly?   Pretty sure that any of the top captains could do the same.   And if you think he won any part of the fight with Aizen then I don't know what to tell you... That's ridiculous.
bleach,34dj37,rickdousey,1 point,Fri May 1 11:54:41 2015 UTC,"wonderweiss was stated to be at espada level.  in fact, kensei went bankai against him and lo and behold, later on a resurrecion wonderweiss shows up with no noticable injuries. kensei's bankai is basicly JUST punches. and he lost.  meanwhile, wonderweiss was specifically designed to counter yama's sword. no other captains got any special countermeasures thrown at them as far as we know. also, it was the only modified arrancar.  as for their fight, at first yama grabbed aizen and prepared to basicly destroy everything in the barrier. aizen may or may not have had a free bailout there throught the hogyoku, but considering he still tried to counter yama i doubt he could just have shrugged it off.  heck, aizen himself even states that that blades offensive capabilites may very well exceed his own, and that he's powerless before wonderweiss. well nope - he proceeds to beat him to death with ikkotsu and soukotsu.  in other words - wonderweiss alone failed horribly to stop him.  then ofcourse the twist - o noes! flames sealed in his body.  this is where the pride factors in. his pride didn't allow him to just let those flames explode and take out a large part of the human world as well. his pride didn't allow him to let that happen, so he tanked the entire blast. aizen thinks he has him, goes to execute him, and eats a hado 96 to the face, forcing him to back off.  ofcourse, he didn't win. but then again - neither did he lose. he got outplayed by one of the most intelligent people out there, which cost him an arm, but he didn't outright lsoe against him. saying aizen had no problems with him after his sword was sealed is plain ridiculous - he even had to go out of his way in the first place just to seal it, then failed to actually capitalise on it.  he also easly took out ayon(who was just plain slaughtering vice captains before that), took out 3 (weakend) fraccion in a single hit, killed some sternritters without really being in any danger. his zanpakto is said to have the most offensive power of all of them. he can supress vice captains with his reiatsu alone. his bankai destroys the world if he leaves it on for too long. i can agree to him not being the strongest out there, but claiming he never showed any power and all that is something i can't agree on."
bleach,34dj37,zelatorn,-1,Tue May 5 13:36:46 2015 UTC,"Yama lost that fight to aizen. He was handicapped, but he did lose. Not because of his pride either."
bleach,34dj37,rogrogrickroll,4,Thu Apr 30 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"Aizen had the Hogyoku-hacks. I don't think that is a fair comparison. Aizen also needed the help of Wonderweiss to pull it off.   Aizen had mentioned that all battles among Shinigami come down to being battles of reiatsu. If one's reiatsu was larger than the opponents, the weaker one's Zanpakuto would have issue taking effect (see Soi Fon trying to use her two-hit kill on Aizen).   Notice that Aizen didn't try to use his hypnosis on Yama-ji during their fight, even though Aizen had already successfully hypnotized Yama-ji many years ago (Yama wasn't able to detect it was really Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu at play during the SS-arc). Aizen asks Yama-ji if Yama is sure that the sword that pierced him was actually from Aizen, and not just an illusion. To which Yama responds by saying that he would never mistake the reiatsu of that sword.   I take this as meaning that Aizen knew Yama had a larger reiatsu than himself (at least during combat with his Shikai released) and even using Kyoka Suigetsu would likely fail because his reiatsu was too high for KS to be fully-effective. If that wasn't the case, why would he even bother creating Wonderweiss if he could just ""Complete Hypnosis"" the whole fight like he did to everyone else before slashing them all down.   Aizen even admits that if it were a fair fight, he knows that he would too lose too much ground against Yamamoto with straight zan-to-zan combat."
bleach,34dj37,Vlaid,-1,Thu Apr 30 18:52:10 2015 UTC,Because yama was going to destroy everything with that special attack of his. Everything around him dies. Doesnt matter if he is hypnotized or not. Then aizen takes out ww to block that attack. Do you remember? This was how their fight began.
bleach,34dj37,rogrogrickroll,2,Thu Apr 30 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Right. And if all Zanpakuto abilities can be negated/severely mitigated by having a higher reiatsu, what does that tell you? If Aizen's reaitsu had been higher than Yama's, he wouldn't have been so cautious around his Zanpkauto's ability/Shikai's reiatsu increase to come up with a counter.   Aizen's reiatsu, even with Hogyoku (Stage 1) was lower than Yama's. If it wasn't, he could have hypnotized Yama to make him think he died during the encounter with the other captains. Which again, I don't think he was even able to make Complete Hypnosis take effect on Yama with his Ryujin Jakka released."
bleach,34dj37,Vlaid,2,Thu Apr 30 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"What are you even talking about?   Aizen didn't use the hogyoku until after he stopped Yamma.   Do you remember who it was that pushed Aizen to evolve to hogyoku stage 1....it wasn't Yama it was Ichigo's dad.   Aizen beat Yamma whole still only a shinigami.   Answer me this..... Why do you think Yamma was so strong???   Do it without using ""because he said so""  or ""because someone else said so""    can you?"
bleach,34dj37,rickdousey,0,Fri May 1 12:03:32 2015 UTC,"We actually have no evidence that the Hogyoku wasn't actively increasing his reiatsu or not (without causing evolution). What we do have is this:  Remember, when Ichigo surprise-attacked Aizen (after Yama sacrificed his hand), Aizen revealed that the reason he wasn't truly hurt and was able to regenerate was because the Hogyoku was already assimilated.  The Hogyoku didn't need to be causing Aizen's evolution to already augment his abilities. Proof of that is seen right here.   In response to your challenge:  I'll refer you to the fact that Aizen needed to form a plan of sealing his Zanpakuto and releasing the sealed-flames all at once to defeat him. If his reiatsu was stronger, he could simply have used that. Instead, he needed a fairly convoluted, plotkai plan to defeat Yama-jii."
bleach,34dj37,Vlaid,1 point,Fri May 1 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"What? Im not saying aizen is stronger than yama. Im saying he didnt get stomped by yama like you made it seem like. Your arguments are also starting to become a little crazy. Hypnotize people to make them think they're dead? Are you crazy? Aizen can hypnotize people. He's not omnipotent. If he was able to hypnotize people into thinking they are dead, why didn't he do so in the very first arc when they were all under hypnosis? Anyway i am done with this discussion. It's starting to get a little absurd...  My point is that aizen is not as weak as you're making him out to be."
bleach,34dj37,rogrogrickroll,0,Thu Apr 30 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"I could have been more clear I suppose. I didn't mean to say that he would hypnotize Yama into thinking Yama (himself) was dead. I merely meant that Aizen could make everyone think that he, Aizen, died again (during the captain onslaught). It wouldn't be the first time he's faked his death to make moving around easier.   I never said he was weak. Nor did I say that he was ""stomped"" by Yama. That was someone else. I am merely stating that his reiatsu was only being augmented to such extreme limits due to the Hogyoku, and that his normal reiatsu was far weaker than Yama's. Hence all of his necessary planning with Wonderweiss."
bleach,34dj37,Vlaid,-1,Thu Apr 30 19:58:36 2015 UTC,As I mentioned.   BEFORE HE EVOLVED (no hax)  and WITHOUT BANKAI(so Wonderweiss doesn't matter)   people always use excuses as to why he lost buthere a e some facts.   Yamma ddidn't have his bankai BUT Aizen did't use his either ALSO Ichigo's father DIDN'T have his bankai either did he.   Using the fact that Yamma didn't have his bankai means nothing since neither did those two who fought to a stalemate while Yamma got beat by Aizen before he fought Ichigo's dad.   Yamma was just never as strong as he claimed.   If we saw Yamma in Bankai vs Aizen in Bankai maybe we could speak differently BUT all we saw was Yamma without Bankai vs Aizen without Bankai and Aizen won.
bleach,34dj37,rickdousey,1 point,Fri May 1 12:00:22 2015 UTC,"Again, you are mistaken:  (Copy and Paste from my previous point)   We actually have no evidence that the Hogyoku wasn't actively increasing his reiatsu or not (without causing evolution). What we do have is this:   Remember, when Ichigo surprise-attacked Aizen (after Yama sacrificed his hand), Aizen revealed that the reason he wasn't truly hurt and was able to regenerate was because the Hogyoku was already assimilated.  The Hogyoku didn't need to be causing Aizen's evolution to already augment his abilities. Proof of that is seen right here.   So to claim Aizen didn't have ""Hogyoku-hax"" in play isn't accurate and we will never be able to gauge a fair fight between them because others got involved. Simple as that. I still would like to point out that Aizen had to come up with extensive planning that required the use of the Hogyoku (hello...Wonderweiss's birth was entirely dependent on the Hogyoku) before being able to comfortably defeat Yama."

Then after the first Quincy War, the Soul King created the Royal Guard cause he felt the need to be protected. I'd like to believe the original Gotei members we're Yamma, Unohana, the 5 Royal Guard members, Then 6 members of some Noble Houses ( Shinoin, Kuchiki, Feng, Kyoraku, Ukitake, Omaeda, Kira and Shiba)"

The only one that's definitely younger than Yamma is the girl with purple hair, as she was the Captain of 12 right before Urahara.

Watch the show, and I would advise you to stay away from this subreddit or any other place that discusses Bleach, unless you want every major plot point spoiled. The manga's been out for years now, so people are rather casual with dropping spoliers.

bleach,34ajo8,Gargarlord,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"Regarding the second two questions:  3: As far as we know, there is no ""heaven"" in the Bleach setting. Soul Society is not a 'heaven'; it's just a second world where souls live. We know that someone who dies in the living world is reborn in Soul Society, and the implication is that someone who dies there is reincarnated in the living world. Hell, in Bleach, exists outside this cycle and is reserved for souls that are so maliciously evil they do not belong in the cycle. Ichimaru, Mayuri, and Aizen probably just didn't qualify at the time of their 'death'. They may not even qualify now; we haven't been given a whole lot of information about Hell to understand exactly where the tipping point is.  4: Hitsugaya is supposed to have the appearance of a child/adolescent somewhere around 12-14, but he's actually a few hundred years old. Later on in the series, you will come across a few flashbacks showing him when he was younger, and based on those, I would guess it takes him a few decades to age one year by living human standards. Something to take note of, though, is that aging is inconsistent among characters in Bleach. Unohana, for instance, is revealed much later (in the manga, post anime finale) as being actually not a whole lot younger than Yamamoto, but he looks ancient and she appears middle-aged at most."

bleach,34a4v2,Temperatia,3,Fri May 1 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"Right, because that's nothing like revealing Ichigo is a Shingiami, but not having him learn to do anything except Bankai. No Kido, Hakudo, or Hoho.   Nor is it similar to Ichigo being a Hollow, but not learning Pesquisa, Bala, Cero, Sonido, or gaining High-Speed-Regeneration.   Basically, Ichigo's ability to use all of his different powers is as proficient as if he was using Urahara's Benihime (which possesses six different abilities) but is only able to use Nake. Look at how diverse Benihime is. Now look at Zangetsu. Getsuga Tensho is so basic it shouldn't even be called an attack."
bleach,34a4v2,Temperatia,2,Fri May 1 01:49:31 2015 UTC,"Well as it was revealed throughout the story, it is not mandatory for a shinigami to learn Kido, Hakudo, or Hoho. It's not essential to identify as a ""shinigami"".   Ichigo used both Cero, Sonido, and High-speed-regeneration throughout hollow training and the fight with Ulquiorra, just like a hollow.  Also, it's not really correct to judge Zangetsu as we have not seen Ichigo reveal what his limits are as of new chapters and revelations. I'd also like to add that Getsuga Tenshou is controllable. Ichigo demonstrated this multiple times, such as covering his sword in Getsuga rather than firing, charging one big burst, defending by blocking with it using it's power (just as Urahara did with Benihime against Yami), and firing short bursts.   Also, with the new Getsuga Juujishou, we can't measure anything else about Ichigo currently."
bleach,34a4v2,Temperatia,2,Fri May 1 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if it's mandatory or not. What matters is that Ichigo has neglected to try and learn it.   White is fully capable of using all of those abilities, but Ichigo himself is not. The Vizards all took the time to learn about those abilities, but Ichigo never even attempted them. He couldn't even learn it instinctively the way he learned Kurio Getsuga after White took over his body. Which might even be him knowing, but refusing to use it.   Releasing a Getsuga to help him parry Ulquiorra's attack is not the same as making a shield out of his spiritual energy like Urahara can. Really, all Ichigo did was change the direction he released his Getsuga in to get a secondary effect out of it. That's still extremely basic."

Ichigo has always been a character to only use his full potential when the situation literally goes out of his hands and into OMZ's or White's. Now, as I said before, we can't judge anything as of now since Ichigo has both settled things with OMZ and White.  EDIT: I'd also like to add that when Ichigo received each new set of powers or trained for them, the situation has always been dire, allowing only training for the most basic functions and letting other abilities kick in through the other spirits controlling his body."
bleach,34a4v2,yukeake,1 point,Fri May 1 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"In fighting it doesn't matter what you use, if it works, it works.    And if it doesn""t? In that case, Ichigo just keeps using the same attack over again until he loses and White takes over.  Just because he's gotten stronger doesn't mean he has a mind to develop any new kinds of attacks.   He can learn things instinctively. Even before White would took over his body, he started using Getsuga Tensho on his own, by accident. That's how Hollows learn everything. So, that's how Ichigo should have been able to access his Hollow powers when he had his mask on."
bleach,34a4v2,Temperatia,1 point,Fri May 1 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"Well you see, Ichigo never fully understood his hollow powers and history, and was always in a state of confusion. Instinct kicks in during a fatal struggle. However, Ichigo was still just trying to learn Basic Hollow Powers along with mastering his Bankai. He only ever used the mask as a Reaitsu power up, never as a ""transfer"" to become a ""vizored"" such as Hirako."
bleach,34a4v2,reigun91,1 point,Fri May 1 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"Still, the rest of his powers should have progressed instinctively the same way his ability to wear a mask progressed."

Having Cero, Ressurecion, Segunda Etapa, Hado, Hoho, or anything else but the basics and being good at the basics would put Ichigo through the roof in situations that would otherwise need to be handled with some plot and character development, which is needed throughout a story."

bleach,34a4v2,ChaosKeeshond,4,Wed Apr 29 18:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was implied by OMZ's manifestaion above the smaller blade at the forging.  However, remember that OMZ is now technically a zanpakuto spirit as well.  Perhaps the first, or only Quincy zanpakuto spirit.  We don't know how that'll work out just yet.  Ichigo also doesn't necessarily need a bow - he already has ranged ability via GT/GJ.  The supporting Quincy abilities end up being more useful to round out his skillset than being able to fire Helig Pfeil."

It's also pretty epic when Isane does it in the anime.    What spell would you like to see?   More 90s level spells.   Who do you think would win in a kido fight against who?   Aizen probably trumps everyone. But I bet Tessai can handle himself. Yeah, I still hype Tessai.   Will Ichigo ever learn kidō?   Probably not."

bleach,349195,Purona,4,Wed Apr 29 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"All of those examples are modifications to the sword, not the blade. The tsuka and saya can always be switched out or modified since they're just complementary to the blade itself. We saw during Ouetsu's forging process that the Asauchi only becomes the stock which he forges into the blade, which means that any other additions to the sword are cosmetic.  Modifying the blade of a katana is essentially impossible. The only way to make Benihime into the shape it is now from the shape it was before would be to reforge it, and the knowledge of how to reforge an Asauchi wouldn't exactly be easy to come by. If anybody could do it, Ouetsu's title would be pointless. The fact Urahara's blade is modified means either Ouetsu himself did it, or Urahara did it by observing and copying Ouetsu's technique (which is the likely option considering he's copied every other Royal Guard's creation)."

bleach,346qan,kingofdabz,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"They weren't saying it like its a bad thing, they were just saying it as a fact. The pacing of the days in one piece fits really well with the story and only adds to the positives of it. It all just depends on the story. For one piece it works, bleach has its own pace as well that works for it I suppose."
bleach,346qan,selly112090,2,Wed Apr 29 21:19:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I agree, it's just not a pace that fits in with me. I respect it as a show and it's following I just don't personally enjoy it after giving it multiple attempts"
bleach,346qan,kingofdabz,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:35:40 2015 UTC,"If you're into reading have you tried the manga? As a fan, I would say the manga is tons better than the anime of one piece, no filler and there's no mistakes in the art (which I hear the anime does a lot). Source material is always superior"
bleach,346qan,a_real_Monkey,11,Wed Apr 29 22:06:05 2015 UTC,We'll now read 9 days of Bleach in 2 years ;)
bleach,346qan,Horrent,9,Tue Apr 28 20:38:02 2015 UTC,I was about to laugh but was cut off by the sinking realisation that your right...
bleach,346qan,reigun91,3,Tue Apr 28 20:42:06 2015 UTC,We have about 7 1/2 days left. Or another 3 years in terms of story.
bleach,346qan,darthnick426,5,Tue Apr 28 22:53:09 2015 UTC,Huh. Well we've certainly had a lot of this war happen over the span of one day. And here I gave Naruto shit for having the Fourth Great Shiniobi War happen in only 3 days.......Nvm....that was still ridiculous.
bleach,346qan,a310gintoki,2,Tue Apr 28 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"I tried to figure it out, then got floored after realizing that it's 2003 in the bleach universe right now. 2003!"
bleach,346qan,LucciDVergo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:50:57 2015 UTC,I too have been wondering exactly how important those 9 days will be?  Like will the final clash happen between Yhwach and Ichigo 8 days from now (manga wise) while the world is epicly crumbling around them?
bleach,346qan,Keranu,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"I thought it was only night 2 so far, Mask's fight was the end of the first day and I assume dealing with aizen now is the end of the second"
bleach,346qan,fellatious_argument,-1,Wed Apr 29 06:19:15 2015 UTC,I doubt 9 days will actually elapse.  Aizen was supposed to invade in the winter and that whole arc ended before then.

bleach,348o5z,Zeta42,8,Wed Apr 29 05:05:19 2015 UTC,"Ichigo was picked up by that zanpakuto chick, so his body just dropped unconscious in front of Ikumi. And because she can't see Isshin when he's a Shinigami, she probably had to watch Ichigo's body being dragged into his house by an invisible man.  She either had a heart attack on the spot, or stopped drinking."
bleach,348o5z,CRAEREASDW,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:05:50 2015 UTC,Maybe Isshin possessed Ichigo's body and started screwing around in it like Kon did.

I thought it was just for protection so your body isn't just out there passed out in the middle of whatever/wherever you came from.  I think that whole concept was from early Bleach where it seemed like the series might mainly take place in K-Town and would be about defending K-Town from outsiders more than going somewhere else to rescue people."
bleach,348o5z,Purona,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:02:40 2015 UTC,Mod soul isnt needed to keep the body alive its only needed to keep it out of danger
bleach,348o5z,aizen6,2,Wed Apr 29 23:00:20 2015 UTC,Really? I thought when his soul left his body he was basically dead at that point and his body would start to rot.

bleach,348o5z,aizen6,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:52:08 2015 UTC,are you sure about that? Tatsuki seemed like she had the hots for Orihime and Orihime alone.
bleach,348o5z,itsuwaribito,2,Fri May 1 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Tatsuki was sort of a ""protective guardian"" to Orihime, a sort of security against Chizuru. I don't mind an Ichihimetsuki tri-way though. Tatsuki deserves to be with the main character; she's strong and independent and hot and ... well, everything that a female lead should be."

I made a deal with my friend that if he watches all of Bleach with me I will give Naruto a try. Also Naruto will keep you busy for awhile, so many episodes, Part 1 at the start may be kinda hard to get through but its worth it.   Attack on Titan measures up to the hype, still early in its run, so its short.  Full Metal Alchemist also good stuff."

bleach,348wf2,StuperSconed,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:04:57 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity why would you advise to skip to water 7 in one piece but also watch the early filler? Wouldn't you skip only the filler?
bleach,348wf2,x30x,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:06:50 2015 UTC,"Cause honestly the early filler is the best filler in any shounen, you get some really funny jokes and the early filler does a great job of the crew's personalities coming out, a scene where they are putting on a play comes to mind which I can't Iink cause I'm on mobile atm but it's really funny, also the filler character designs anrn't  that bad either usually filler characters stand out like a sore thumb but  their designs help blend them into the world very well, also the fillers make a lotta sense the one piece world is island to island so any fillers are very believable that they just went to a island before the cannon islands, but honestly above all watch them for their personalities and the jokes, worth the time cause post time skip fillers is all about fighting some weird devil fruit while pre time skip was about mystery and humor and some fighting  Serious should give the filler a watch"

In the Arrancar arc, Mayuri got mad at Ichigo because Ichigo only called him ""Kurotsuchi Mayuri"" without any honorifics and without including his title of ""Captain""  Speaking of Mayuri, addressing someone by just there first name can be rude as well. We can tell Mayuri calls Urahara by his first name out of disdain.  As for Orihime, Ichigo does it to purposefully distance her since it's a break from his normal habit of using first names. IchiRuki and IchiHime shippers will spin that factoid in whatever way suits them."

His level of formality is usually based on how formal they are to him (with some notable exceptions, like Byakuya and Tōshirō.) Uryū and Orihime use Kurosaki, so he uses their surname. If anything, the oddball outlier is Shinji, as Shinji uses Ichigo, but Ichigo calls him Hirako."
