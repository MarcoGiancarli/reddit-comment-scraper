The switches are loud but I find the caps bottoming out is the real source of peoples complaint's. Some caps also make switches louder or quieter so there's that. When you compare a brown to blue to green they aren't hugely louder. They're all in the ballpark of sufficiently loud.  My opinion is brown, blue, green, whatever...it'll still be loud enough that people will have to deal. Sometimes nobody minds, sometimes not. I've used blues / greens for about two years. Jokes yes, but no complaint's that I've heard."

It's $165.99 on Amazon and has been since April.   Is there something that I'm missing? Wouldn't it be worth it to spend the extra money and get the keycaps plus 2 day Prime shipping?
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1so0,jesusponcho,4,Tue Jul 21 08:34:21 2015 UTC,It's not worth it. Especially with promos and going around.

Ordered them within a day of each other, the Realforce arrived earlier and the Noppoo just today. So far it's been great, love them both to bits and am ready for cup rubber oneness!"
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0rm6,mschock,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:58 2015 UTC,how do you like the Realforce? really tempted to pull the trigger on variable weight Topre
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0rm6,BOTY123,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"I think from what I've read so far, the consensus from the community is that variable weight isn't for everyone. I would agree as well. From my own experience, when I tried a Novatouch for a day, I found that my ring/pinky fingers got tired much more quickly than the rest of my hand. By comparison the variable Realforce got the weighting just right for me. So if you feel that the ring/pinky keys are a bit too stiff on the HHKB, variable weight might work well for you. One word of caution, though. Even though the variable Realforce is supposed to have 35-45g switches, keep in mind that switch weight still varies from what is advertised. For instance, I kept accidentally actuating the ""A"" key on the Realforce without knowing why, but I haven't had issues with any other 35g switch. After some testing with pennies, I found that even though all the other 35g keys actuate around 34-37g, my ""A"" key is particularly light at around 32g. It's entirely possible that I just got unlucky, though.       Edit: line spacing."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0dqs,Atredl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:38:52 2015 UTC,It's the lacquer finish which I highly recommend. I used clear spray on lacquer with 7 coats on the top and bottom pieces. The middle two got 3 coats. After the 3rd coat I used wet 400 grit sandpaper (finest I had). The spray on stuff I used didn't need much sanding at all and only 2hrs drying between coats. It's worth the wait and will last longer than the oil/wax alone.

MechanicalKeyboards,3e1p36,rjmana,2,Tue Jul 21 07:39:12 2015 UTC,The 2u high 1.25u wide key doesn't exist to my knowledge. Unless there is some vintage board with one it will be almost impossible to get a keycap for it.
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1p36,nathanrosspowell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:18 2015 UTC,"An alternative solution would be to use an ISO Enter. It wouldn't look as nice, but it would work. If push comes to shove I can always use a 3D printer."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1p36,OxoCuboid,2,Tue Jul 21 11:31:11 2015 UTC,"If you turn the ISO enter upside down it might look ok, and it should fit."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1p36,Zoenobium,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"As I am also working on a more ortholinear layout I see a few problems in your design immediatly. You seem to have missed one of the most important tips available: Don't use Keycaps unless you have a good Idea of where you might get them from.    Your enter Key is a 2 unit height 1.25 Unit width Key which is something I have not yet seen in any of the places selling keycaps in any profile ever. I am fairly certain a Key like that doesn't exist at the moment so you'd have to make one yourself. Pretty much the same goes for a 8 Unit-wide spacebar. that things quite gigantic really and I haven't seen a 8 Unit spacebar in any of the usual shops so far. You may also want to check for availability for all those 1,25 keys for all the rows you need them for. I am not certain wether all of these would be available anywhere.    personally I also think having an extra-numpad on an ortholinear keyboard with extra layers seems a little redundant, but if you think you will really need it a lot, I guess there is no way around that.    If you want something a lot easier to put together you could just get one of the available keyboard designs like the Atomic from ortholineakeyboards.com and just get a seperate numpad for when you need it."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1p36,Zoenobium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I was wondering about the Enter key. The ISO Enter key is 1.25 units wide at its widest point, so I kind of assumed something would exist. I do have access to some 3D printers, so it's not that big of a deal. An alternative would be to make the column 1u wide, but that's not very appealing.  When it comes to the 1x1.25 keys, that's the dimensions of a normal control key if I'm not mistaken. Wouldn't just using loads of those caps work?  And when it comes to the space bar, I have actually seen something like it. The Sun type 6 and 7 both have insanely long space bars. I'm probably going to shorten it though, since I'm not really happy about the corner with the status LEDs.   The important thing for me is that it all lines up. I don't want any unbroken columns.  Edit: Also, on the topic of numpads, it's a bit of a gimmick, but it really helped with the placement of the arrow keys. My previous attempt looked something like a keycool 84, but without the function keys I couldn't find a good place for delete or insert. then a friend showed me the TK and I thought it was a good compromise."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1p36,Gtantha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:29:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with using 1.25 keys in all the rows is that most keycap sets have a certain profile to them. The Iso Key is actually 1.5 Units wide at it's widest part and 1.25 Units in it's more narrow part. I've also been unable to find any 1.25 wide keys for the homerow (the one with caps-lock in it) when I was looking around. You could possible go with keys that are the same on each row, like DSA profile ones but even there you probably won't find your enter key or your spacebar. The normal spacebar length is 6.25 units btw, but some other lengths are also found available in some shops, like 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0 lengths that I have seen around on keycap sites.    Unless you want to make your own keycaps I'd recommend looking at a bunch of keycap sites to see what is out there and you could remake your layout while using a standard ansi or iso layout as a source for your keys on the layout-editor site. that way you can see what you'd be able to source form a normal keyset and what you'd have to get extra from somewhere or make yourself."

Unless you want to make your own keycaps I'd recommend looking at a bunch of keycap sites to see what is out there and you could remake your layout while using a standard ansi or iso layout as a source for your keys on the layout-editor site. that way you can see what you'd be able to source form a normal keyset and what you'd have to get extra from somewhere or make yourself.   I will definitely do that.  Edit:  Is there some sort of a guide to the different cap profiles like DSA and such? I tried finding a list of the ones available on the layout editor, but I can't find one without decompressing the CSS files and that's a bit too much work."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,_Metro,11,Mon Jul 20 11:56:48 2015 UTC,Just received a Type S for my birthday as a gift from my girlfriend. First impressions are pretty great. As soon as I received I began to have doubts to whether I would use my original HHKB but after typing on it for a few hours I can understand why people buy more than one of these keyboards. Each keyboard feels totally different from each other in my opinion and I love each one for their unique features. If you own a standard HHKB and you've ever considered the possibility of a Type S and have the extra cash then I would highly recommend it.
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,DyLaNzZpRo,5,Mon Jul 20 12:07:05 2015 UTC,What exactly are the differences with the Type-S?
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,DyLaNzZpRo,5,Mon Jul 20 12:29:42 2015 UTC,"The ""S"" stands for silent so it is quieter than the standard HHKB."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,pss395,3,Mon Jul 20 13:05:17 2015 UTC,"Huh, does it affect the feel of the switches?"
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,FE_Still_Waiting,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:08:23 2015 UTC,"Very slightly, they haven't got as much pop as standard Topre switches but I actually prefer them."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,pss395,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"I would decide which one to get first based on where it will be used. If it is in private get the regular, but if it is in public get the type S"

MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,Dead_Politician,4,Mon Jul 20 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty commonly asked question, but isn't 45g a little too light? Is there much feedback, or do they resemble linear switches? I want to get 55g Topre, but I really like the layout of the HHKB so I might just get that instead."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,Violent_Bounce,4,Mon Jul 20 15:35:27 2015 UTC,"I have girl hands so 45g is light enough for me, considering that when I type with Cherry boards I normally use MX Black with 50g springs just so my hands won't tire as quick. If you're really that serious about 55g then buy a 55g Realforce and if you figure you want a HHKB you can always dome swap the 45g to the 55g domes from the Realforce. There is loads of feedback, they're definitely a lot snappier than MX switches. The only thing I can really compare them to is an ergo clear or a Gateron brown with a much faster reset time and ultra smooth mechanism."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,TehPanduh,2,Mon Jul 20 15:44:54 2015 UTC,"45g topre does not feel nearly as light as 45g cherry mx. I despise reds/browns and find the hhkb 45g to be really pleasant and easy but without the misclicks and loose feel that I get from light mx switches. 55g is still my favorite so I'm considering swapping in 55g domes to my hhkb, but don't shy away from the 45g, it's really nice actually."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxpnr,martinyeah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"Topre switches are essentially really nice rubber domes and have the rubber dome force curve. I think 45 grams is definitely enough to prevent accidental keystrokes, though after the initial bump, it's smooth and light all the way down so you'll bottom out pretty often."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e2xjk,TheOneOutlander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although a properly designed connector like the CM Quickfire XTi one I think is better.  Having your keyboard accidentally disconnect is pretty annoying."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e2xjk,ripster55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"I don't imagine that your keyboard would disconnect randomly.  The magnet seems reasonably strong.  I think that you would have to be pushing the keyboard around a lot to get it disconnecting wildly.  In either case, even if I just end up using this on my phone, it's worth it.  I put in a pledge for the set, hopefully they're done by the end of the year, but I'm not holding my breath."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e2xjk,I-J-Reilly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:49 2015 UTC,So sad the HHKB still uses that crusty old USB Mini-B connector. I love that keyboard but a version with a modern connector and some Bluetooth would be so welcome.

MechanicalKeyboards,3e20qv,Quakemz,3,Tue Jul 21 10:33:06 2015 UTC,"Of course. Most of them feature a solid color. Typically, when you see one like the one in this video, it's a custom paint-job. Checking PCPP is a good place to start. Here is a list sorted by mechanical, TKL and price. You will find several here on this list.   It's also a good idea to keep an eye on Massdrop's mechanical keyboard section. You'll frequently find drops for TKL boards, as well as keycaps and everything else related to the topic."

I tried to put as much info into the description as I could, but if I'm missing anything, or things are unclear, let me know here, and I'll explain/make changes!  I've been shipping out a bunch of orders recently, and trying to get caught-up to the 3 week mark, and lowering shipping times for in-stock parts to 1 week. This will be possible in part to the new office (pics once I get everything organised), but also to having some help shipping things in the future!

MechanicalKeyboards,3e1dtc,IBNobody,3,Tue Jul 21 05:18:48 2015 UTC,Jkraghify from the Corsair forums came up with a simple mod to add a white laser-cut sheet of plastic underneath the keycaps on his K95 RGB. He has templates available to create your own.  http://forum.corsair.com/forums/showthread.php?t=140978  I got my own sheet of styrene plastic and tried it out. I am very pleased with the results. Others are reporting positive outcomes with using cut-out paper sheets.  I hope other RGB keyboard makers use white/reflective bases in the future because it significantly accentuates the lighting of the keys.
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1dtc,rjmana,2,Tue Jul 21 05:23:17 2015 UTC,"for sure. i first got a taste of it with the wasd code board which has a white plate. the quickfire tk (and rapid i as well i think) do the same, except use a blue plate for their blue led board and red for the red led one. it really makes the shine from the leds come out. if using a white plate and white leds it also reflects the colors of the keycaps used which is awesome as well :)"
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1dtc,Kaemdar,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:25 2015 UTC,cool stuff i do hope others use them more like this. though some of the beauty in the corsair K line is the floating keys on metal look which is prolly ruined a bit now with this mod. still if you're all about getting the most from your rgb colours you should be doing this
MechanicalKeyboards,3e1uo6,DestinV13,4,Tue Jul 21 08:47:44 2015 UTC,"Quickfire for sure, no doubt. Standard keycaps, good build quality from a decently respected brand and looks pretty nice and simple."

Non standard bottom row which would make changing key caps harder or more expensive, a worse build quality and quality control tends to be quite bad (even though it is the cherry version) and a brand that marks up the board's price in relation to the quality you're gonna get. The only other difference is the aesthetics of the board, which I guess appeals to some but to most it gives off the tacky 'gamerzzzzz' board."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,kubatyszko,5,Mon Jul 20 08:25:03 2015 UTC,"I finally got around and built the Atreus. It came with blues but I wanted reds so it took some time. Better yet, once it was soldered I realized the pcb was upside-down (somehow it made more sense to have the Astar micro in the open space rather than sandwiched between pcb and switch plate). I ended up making a tiny patch, simply reversed column pins and swapped two middle keys (since those are on the same column) - that made it all work. I will submit this to Atreus firmware and make it configurable - default will of course be ""non-flipped"""
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,technomancy,3,Mon Jul 20 08:28:16 2015 UTC,This is actually already supported in a branch of the firmware: https://github.com/technomancy/atreus-firmware/tree/pcb-flip  I need to add a link from the readme though; thanks for the reminder.
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,technomancy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:15 2015 UTC,At a quick glance - this doesn't seem configurable - it's simply a branch with all of the columns flipped right ?
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,RocketmanZero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:58 2015 UTC,Ah right; true. Making it an option you could set in the makefile would be better.

MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,technomancy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"The schematics are here: https://github.com/technomancy/atreus  However, I'm one step ahead of you; it's already been adapted to Matias switches. =)  Right now all quiet kits are shipping with Matias and clicky ones are shipping with Cherry blues still, but I am planning to transition fully over to Matias soon. I do have some stock of Matias clicky switches around if that's what you're interested in; they are my personal favourite switch. If you place an order and email me with specific requests I can make it happen."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,technomancy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Cool. I may hold off on the order for now, as I just recently got my blacked out unicomp, though it would be fun to build a keyboard.   I have modded and repaired a good few keyboards, and I quite like ALPS switches, as there are some out there that require quite some actuation pressure."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,rpgoof,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"Also, out of curiosity, what do you think such a kit would be priced at?"
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,Swainix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"The pricing is the same for either kind of kit. I will be introducing acrylic cases soon which will add an additional $20 or so, but the switch type does not affect the price."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dxam3,SRTroN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"Cool, in fact I would have liked Matias version (have a large bag of switches) but getting the caps remains a problem..."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e1i0b,tigojones,2,Tue Jul 21 06:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well, right now, if you want to stick with Cherry switches and not something else, I'm not sure if you have many options outside the Corsair K70.   Other than that, either build one yourself, or buy one that uses a Cherry clone like Kailh or Gateron switches and replace them with Cherry. That being said, Gateron seems to get a lot of love here, so you might not even need/want to replace them."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e1i0b,homerunnerd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:53 2015 UTC,"As I said, Gateron switches seem to be performing well, with some people actually preferring them over Cherry for the slightly smoother feel. The word is still out on how durable they are, long term.   Kailh, however, doesn't have as good of a reputation. Poor consistency and quality control compared to Cherry. They are, however, the most common ""knockoff"" switch you'll find. All that being said, there are people who have little issue with Kailh switches and find them a suitable substitute as long as the price is right."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dziwg,trenchantgrifter,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:20 2015 UTC,I wonder what the limitations they have about spacebars is about. I think the only way to get a spacebar with the exact same color code is to get a DSA on from PMK but that would be a very different profile.

I just recently started playing and mapped my camera movements to WASD, My hero casts are QEXRF and Item casts are 1234, respectively. I've been doing great with that layout so far and haven't had any issues. I'm not hardcore into it so I may have overlooked something that more experienced players do."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0qt9,ADSRelease,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:44 2015 UTC,"I generally remap any important F keys to either a new key or shift/alt/ctrl combo. F1-5 often become Ctrl +1 - 5 as its pretty easy to palm the left control on my pok3r and anything that I really need to use often will get a letter key. Honestly the only think I can think would have an issue would be an MMO where you are a healer or pvper with some ridiculous spell needs and even then you should probably looking into the macro system to cut down your keystrokes.  I think the biggest benefit of the 60% is the low amount of hand travel. Its very easy to use keys outside of your alphas on a full sized board but a 60% really makes you refine, remap and adapt to things all in the same region.It has decreased some of the stress my hands had playing games and made my gaming more responsive without costing me anything but the extra movement that I was wasting my time with before. I also like that I have more room on my desk for other things and my mouse."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,Maxbet,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:46 2015 UTC,Sounds doable to me. Don't forget stabilisers. I imagine the keyboard will have some and I assume these will be of a standard size (I am no expert).  A small thing but you might want to think about feet. This won't have any incline without them and you need something to stop slipping.
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,goomba_gibbon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"Actually,I forgot to put in the OP that I would need a set of keycaps and stabilizers. Those are the last thing to buy though. I think I'll be sticking to a 60% design for this one. Those sets seem to be available for decent prices regularly these days and I don't want to end up with a board I cant get caps for.  Thanks for the suggestion on the feet, I have been thinking about those and I want to try and use some bolts for that + rubber sheet like stuff I have laying around."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,RGlkIHlvdSByZWFsbHk,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"get a cheaper controller like a pro micro, they are only $5 on ebay.  Depending on the layout you can reuse parts of the old plate.  Totally doable though. One super cheap idea I've seen was get long standoffs and put rubber feet on the end of them. Then you don't need a bottom case or and you can easily set the tilt with different length standoffs  If you are just trying to prototype start with a sheet of cardboard though. Just print off your layout and cut the switch holes with a knife. It's super crappy but free and you at least get an idea of if your layout will work. like you plan."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,RGlkIHlvdSByZWFsbHk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"Cardboard sounds like a good idea to get a sense of the layout. However I want to make a functioning prototype to iterate from.   I do wonder if I could just leave the bottom plate off like you suggest when using 2mm alu for the top plate.Might get a little flexy though. Something to try out.  Yeah, I have been looking into the pro micro today. Looks a bit more complicated with the firmware but it might be doable. That would bring down the total investment for the first keyboard down to ~€30. Not bad."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,fliptrik,2,Mon Jul 20 23:28:11 2015 UTC,"Firmware is the same, you just can't use the teensy loader to put it on there."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,rjmana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really need to do some reading about using one of those, it would be a big chunk of the costs saved."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,rjmana,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much this would be around your area, but you could look into 3D printing some pieces that you need. Although I see now that you're cutting the aluminum plate yourself. Just an option to consider."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,Kupuntu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:29 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told 3d printing the plates is not really financial viable. It would cost a multiple of the cost for lasercutting the plate from acrylic.  I do think I will be attempting to cut the plate by hand from alu though. In my mind it shouldn't be to hard to get it close enough if the template used is good. But then again most of the times things that look simple aren't.  Oh well, if cutting by hand doesn't work I've wasted €6 and learned something."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e04yy,Kupuntu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:36 2015 UTC,if a cad file is needed for laser cutting you can generate your layout from http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ and put it into http://builder.swillkb.com/ or here http://www.keyboardcad.com/

I was planning on using Swill's tool to make a template of the top plate and glue it to the alu so I can cut it like that.  Or if that fails to get the acrylic cut ;)"

I've been considering a project like this but it seems that donor keyboards aren't that commonly available here. It's pretty much 30€ and up for a cherry MX board.  Good luck with the plate if you cut it yourself. I don't think I'd ever be able to cut it well enough to use it for a keyboard. My original idea was to use a wooden plate and get it cut somewhere but I don't think many wood shops can cut it well enough, at least without paying an arm and a leg for it."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dz7fg,Mattr567,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone.  Thank you for all the feedback on the last interest check.  Upon request and great ideas I have added child deals and revised the set.  Also as in the title I have changed the profile to R3 SA. Many people weren't particularly interested in DSA and the majority wanted SA. R3 means users who use Dvorak or colemark/other can use this keyset.  As for the other revisions; yes because of SA it has to be ABS. SP ABS is good quality and I wouldn't worry about it. Thick SA FTW! The legends are going to be doubleshot.  New colors are NN and BFK. The blue is darker than it used to be and fits the darker blue legends better. NN isnt a super dark black rather a darker gray. The legends remain the same: #0f5bd4  NUM has replaced Numlock for consistency    There are two new child deals: Alternative color and legends  and Alternative Alps Keyboard. (not the best names I know)  alter color and legend gives you a option to go for the original layout of having some of the mods the same color as the alphas. This is no longer the default. Also a chance for people to get Enter and Backspace rather than Return and Delete.  alter alps kb is a child for people who want to use the set on an older alps board and the infinity.  Included are 2x 1.5 Ctrl and Alt keys, 1x 1.5 and 1.25 shift keys, 1x 7u spacebar, 1x bigass enter + 1u backspace (arrow) + 1u right slash, 4x blank blue keys and 2x blank black keys.  You should be pretty well covered. I cant get every alps board though, so check first! (If I am missing anything big let me know)  Also both infinity layouts should be covered. As before let me know if I missed anything!  Feedback is always appreciated."

MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,mrsimmons,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:11 2015 UTC,Did you try reds?
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Stadsveld,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"I have tried reds! They were good as well. In fact I have some blacks with very light springs in one of my boards. Stock blacks, however are much heavier than reds. Its definitely worth trying reds before hand because if you have elephant fingers like me you can make mistakes pretty easily. Maybe that was just me though."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,mrsimmons,3,Mon Jul 20 00:47:14 2015 UTC,"I tried reds for about a week, didn't like them at all and returned them."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,spezzi,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:21 2015 UTC,That's fair. I definitely tend to prefer stronger springs to lighter springs. But I go through phases and sometimes I enjoy lighter switches.
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,mrsimmons,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:05 2015 UTC,Are blacks quieter than reds? I would imagine not. But my girlfriend still complains about reds even with o-rings.
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,2,Mon Jul 20 02:31:33 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they're any quieter. I don't know how much louder they are either though. I can't imagine they would be all that much louder. Either way though it sounds like your girlfriend doesn't want you using any sort of keyboard, since I don't think reds with o rings is much louder than a dell keyboard."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Stadsveld,2,Mon Jul 20 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"This is my issue. I haven't commited to buying a keyboard quite yet, but I've been torn between brown and blue. I make a lot of typos on the blues but I like the clickiness and the feel of the switches. However with the browns I make less typos, but I don't care too much for the bump."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,5,Sun Jul 19 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"I have had red blues and now browns, used the reds for about a week before returning them. Fucking hate linear switches. The bump on the brown feels to ""low"" but I do like clicky. Do you suggest clear or green?"
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Stadsveld,2,Sun Jul 19 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm a noob who doesn't own any mech keyboards at the moment because I can't decide which switch I like best yet. I've only tried MX Browns, Blacks, Reds, Blues, and Kalih Blues. So I know nothing about Clears and Greens as far as hands on goes.  I'm sure someone will right me if I'm wrong, but won't o-rings help with the 'height' of the bump?"
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:54 2015 UTC,Sorry for being unclear. I ment that the bump was too soft.
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,ipisano,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:31 2015 UTC,You're perfectly fine. If that's what you mean then I think you should give Blacks or more than likely Greens if you can find a board to get your hands on. Personally I felt like the Blacks were a much more hardcore version of the Browns when it came to the bump.
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Numiro,5,Sun Jul 19 20:34:59 2015 UTC,Aren't blacks just harder reds? Maybe you're thinking of clears?
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on that, my Browns are on a standard ducky while my blues are on an ergodox."

MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,2,Sun Jul 19 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"How do you make more typos on blues? That seems incredibly difficult to me, higher actuation force = less accidental keys pressed."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,corvett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:35 2015 UTC,I think the issue is with the fact that you don't have to bottom out the key for blues right? I've only been using rubber domes up until the point I tried out a few keyboards at an electronics store so when I type on these keyboards I'm pressing all the way down. Does that explain why I don't mess up on tactile switches like browns and blacks(?) but have typing issues with blues and reds?
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,3,Sun Jul 19 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but my understanding is all cherry switches have the same actuation distance, and you don't have to bottom any of them out. That's why the rubber o - rings work on all of them."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,corvett,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, it makes sense that actuation distances would be the same, so I need to learn how to not press the keys all the way down. Do you bottom out the keys on blues?"
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Rock48,2,Sun Jul 19 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think I do. I'm really not sure. You can get thicker rings that noticibly shorten the key press distance and still work"
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Cool_Muhl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"Blues are tactile, even more so than browns. Blacks are not tactile at all, they are linear like reds."
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Rock48,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:58 2015 UTC,Shows just how much I know. So what makes blacks feel less... travel(ly)? When I press on reds till I bottom them out it feels like it takes MUCH longer than blacks. And why did I seem to feel a tactile bump like the browns?
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,xdeific,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:48 2015 UTC,lolidk maybe u just need to be better /s  Blacks are harder to press than reds but I still don't know why they'd feel tactile.

MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Halfpac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:12 2015 UTC,I use Browns on my numpad. The bump is too subtle for my tastes. It's a numpd though so I'll deal with it.

Clears are my favorite, followed very closely by Blacks.  I love  blacks on my KUL for work (I'm in a large room, no cubicle walls, so loud keyboards could be a problem).  I have some really tiny o-rings coming that I want to try on it to see if it makes it even quieter even though I'm quieter than the heavy-handed guy on a Dell keyboard 10 feet from me.  Reds were too light for me, and having blacks and work and clears at home has been pretty easy when it comes to switching back and forth each day."

MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,Himiko_the_sun_queen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"Reds are linear switches so what you're probably missing is the bumpy feeling you get from browns/clears/etc.   You could buy single switches of the ones you want, it would be cheaper than a tester and since you already have a cherry mx keyboard you can (temporarily) throw those keys on it to get a better feel. Don't expect the sound to be the same though, sound depends on a lot more than just the switch :)"
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,rengarenekton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:57:53 2015 UTC,"Nah I know what I bought. By compared to the set of rosewill browns and a set of blues I have, the sound is very hollow.

MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,yiyopuga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:21:59 2015 UTC,Yeah the case would have an affect on the sound (one of the reasons I took mine off)  What do you mean by hollow though? What sort of sound?
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,GrammarNaziABC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:27:20 2015 UTC,Not easy to explain. I guess since they arent inset they arent muffled when pressed. I think having a different red switch keyboard would sound different. Or heck maybe its the quality of the corsair keys. Thin?
MechanicalKeyboards,3du3bi,a1blank,2,Mon Jul 20 16:55:25 2015 UTC,Hmm I think what you are describing might be the cause of the keycaps. Thick ABS or PBT has a much more solid sound than the thin polycarbonate of those gaming keyboards

I'd recommend a Coolermaster QFR as a cheap tenkeyless option you can customize, or a KUL if you're willing to spend more money. If you've gotta have a full board prob go with a Ducky or maybe the Code that is on Massdrop right now.    If you don't care about changing anything and just want a lot of colors then it doesn't really matter, I'd rather get a Shine though.    You'll also find great shit on mechmarket."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,boblo1121,5,Tue Jul 21 00:23:13 2015 UTC,Just loud enough =D
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,UsualSuspectXXX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well, technically I could disagree with you here since greens are even louder!  On a more serious note, they are not so loud that you can hear them from another room (unless your house is made of paper). It also depends on how you type, I am louder on my blues than my partner is on his greens.  Browns in my opinion are a bit less tactile than blues and they are also lighter. You might like that, you might not. It will take some typing to find out what switch you like."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,Hundike,2,Tue Jul 21 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"Greens are indeed louder. But the blues in my opinion are the perfect combination of tactility, actuation force, and, of course, sound"

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,ComradeOj,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"They're about the same volume as the razer green switches.  To me, they sound about as loud as a firm mouse click. That's only the click from activation. They make another loud clack if you press it down all the way until the key hits the bottom."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,Zoenobium,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"So while typing a novel I noticed that you said you actually tried a Logitech G710. The G710 should be using MX Blues actually. IF the G710 you tried wasn't clicky you probably actually tried the G710+. The G710+ actually uses MX Browns. SO you either didn't notice the clickyness on the G710, which would be quite surprising to me, or you used the G710+ and just liked the clicky ones way better. ;)    MX Blues definetly give a lot nicer feedback when activating the keys than MX browns. as mcuh as I do loke my Brownss they just can't compare to blues there. They are really more of a compromise if you want some feedback, but have to accomodate for others that might be nearby or you might be talking to via VOIP or something while typing on your keyboard. MX Clears are supposed to give stronger feedback MX Browns, while also needing a bit more force to push them, which is probably why they seem to be incredibly popular at the moment."

If so you could just ask if you may try it before buying it. Most stores I have been to have been very helpfull in these regards."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,xKirbee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:26 2015 UTC,I had them on my old Razer... Loud. I like reds better for keeping the volume down. I used dampeners but they are not the best method. Get browns if you still want the tactile bump. Well good luck on you MK adventures!
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,voxnex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:15 2015 UTC,"Will they be annoying to people around me, even if I'm alone in my room? (my house is small).    It's going to depend on how thick your walls are and how much sound travels through. It's also going to depend on how tolerant everyone else is.    Will they be too loud if I'm going to game/type an essay at night?    They could be, but again, it's going to depend on what your house is like and how your family/roommates reacts to them.    Should I just go with Browns?    Up to you.    Are they just as satisfying?   I don't think they're as nice, but others are quite fine with them. To me, the bump isn't as noticeable. I prefer Clears, as they have a larger bump, they also have a heavier spring, but some people mod them with lighter springs (Ergo Clears)."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,qftvfu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"They arent loud in terms of like, decibels imo. But their clikiness is high pitched and goes through wall easier than the mellow browns in my experience. It was unfortunately enough for a concern that I eventually replaced my blue's with clears.  ymmv."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0g1d,sLpFhaWK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"I have an MX blue board. It really depends on how hard you type. If you bottom out with each stroke, it will be very, very loud. Even if you type pretty lightly, bottoming out on only a few keys, people can still hear it through 2 doors. I'd suggest getting browns or clears (because of the tactile, but a bit louder than browns) if you're worried about volume, or at least getting o-rings for your blues.   Personally, I have ordered a board with clears because I don't want my future roommate to hate me that much."

Personally, I'd keep the Rapid-i, but I don't use the numberpad enough to warrant having one. The Rapid-i, unlike the TK, has a standard bottom row, making it easier to find replacement keycap sets.

I've got a TK and if you need or really want to use a Numpad while also wanting a bit of a more compact keyboard there is pretty much nothing out there besides the TK.  You could potentially get a seperate umpad and pair it woth one of the extremely compact keyboards out there already, but the TK is a really nice option already. I'd recommend you contact your customer support, tell them what happened and have them figure out what to do. I'd tell them that you'll send the rapid-i back as soon as the one you actually ordered arrives and they have supplied you with a way to do so without any extra-costs to you."

Some folks hardly ever use the keypad, some use it all the time. another reason to have a TKL over a full size board is that some folks prefer to have a separate keypad on the other side of their mouse, or on the left side of their keyboard."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dzlqg,Adience,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Considering it is sold by KUL themselves. It's pretty legitimate. Keep in mind Amazon is not the seller, they are just shipping the product.   So don't expect Amazon's amazing support if you have an issue. You would have to deal with KUL themselves. But that shouldn't happen because the KUL is perfect... /s  please don't kill me.  Edit: /u/theimmc, clarified what ""Fufilled by Amazon"" means."

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0smi,Zoenobium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"On the TK when you hold down the FN key for about 3 seconds it will light up and lock you into the function layer. If your FN key is lit up right now that's probably what happened. you held down the key and it locked your F-Keys into the FN-layer, so their media and light controls would work, but you can't use them otherwise at the moment. Just hold down the FN key for 3 seconds again, the light will go off and your F-Keys should be readily available once more. You can then access your Media-keys either by pressing down FN for 3 seconds again or by keeping it pressed at the same time as pressing the F-Keys."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0smi,Zoenobium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:23 2015 UTC,My FN key would be my F12 key? or my windows key? Feel like a complete retard for asking but i can't get this damn thing to work.... maybe its the weed >.>
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0smi,Zoenobium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:14 2015 UTC,The FN key is the key between your right windows key and your right ctrl key.

They're not common, so it's unlikely you'll run into them.  Edit: If you want to keep your budget low, you can buy one of the old boards from the Keypocalypse, or if you decide to just go with another membrane board, Redmaus on Deskthority is selling an IBM one for $12 here. I think those are supposed to be some of the better RD keyboards."

MechanicalKeyboards,3dzqj0,okBroThatsAwkward,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:48 2015 UTC,Best way to find which switch fits you is to try out an actual keyboard with those switches. You could also buy a switch sampler such as: https://www.massdrop.com/buy/npkc-switch-tester. Make sure you check out the mk wiki to find out approximately what the switches feel/sound like.

Actually I also found out a lot of keyboards have these lighting modes so I think all my questions have been answered. If you have recommendations for mechanical keyboards, let me know! :) Sorry I'm a newbie haha"
MechanicalKeyboards,3dzqj0,wilarseny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who bought that drop w/ the intention of making it into a numpad as a long-term project, I'd emphasize to anyone new to massdrop that it's not due to ship until the end of August. You can get key testers elsewhere that'll come much sooner.  To OP: Cooler Master XTi and Corsair K70/K95 are popular LED keyboards in this sub. I'm not a personal big fan of the latter (despite, or perhaps because, of owning it). If I were buying a light macro keyboard today I'd do the XTi."
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0izm,SexySohail,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:37 2015 UTC,It's the E-Element 87 Key Backlit Keyboard as currently available on Massdrop. Except that yours says it comes with actual Cherry Mx Blue Switches which would most certainly make it a better choice if that is in fact true.
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0izm,Zoenobium,2,Tue Jul 21 01:11:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure those are actually Outemu (Cherry MX clone) switches. Price looks about right.
MechanicalKeyboards,3e0izm,schizoidpig,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:38 2015 UTC,with blues   Outemu blues and single row nonchangable back lighting. But if that is you're type of thing then go for it.

MechanicalKeyboards,3e0izm,SevenUsers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:58 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in with my opinion, I wouldn't say its crappy (I mean sure if you compare to great and expensive boards it would look crap) but if you go in with the expectation of it being a cheaper board it really cant be that bad. In all honesty though, maybe its better just to spend a little more on a solid board."
MechanicalKeyboards,3dx7oa,Meteorpils,3,Mon Jul 20 07:41:27 2015 UTC,How is the build quality of this numpad? It seems to be one of the cheaper ones available.  Also does it output numpad codes?
MechanicalKeyboards,3dx7oa,Daniel123654,3,Mon Jul 20 12:44:51 2015 UTC,"u/Draxor wrote a review of this numpad 2 monts ago. not the greatest build quality for this pad but the low price and immediate disponibility  decided me.

MechanicalKeyboards,3dx7oa,Draxor,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"Hey, alt codes work without a problem under 1 condition, rebinding a key on it to Alt, which is annoying, but the only solution I could find"
