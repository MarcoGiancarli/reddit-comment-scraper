Dublin,3e5slk,redditCT,2,Wed Jul 22 04:23:57 2015 UTC,"We're planning to take the public transit into the city, then walk to and rest in Phoenix Park while the shops are still closed.   At 6/7am on a November morning with your luggage? I dread walking to my car on November mornings. I wish you the best with that.   You have time to have a quick look around Dublin and do one of the tours. They start at 9/10 am. But realistically you would want to be heading back to the airport by 12pm so probably not able to do both. Be cutting it very fine with lunch too."
Dublin,3e5slk,wantouttobg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:58:09 2015 UTC,"You'll be too early for public transport at 5am. I suggest getting breakfast in the airport and waiting until 6am when the buses start running. The #16 bus will bring you all the way into town from the airport for a fair (in exact change) of €2.55 - €3:20 depending on your bus driver. You'll not be happy to hear this but you realistically only have time for 1 activity. The phonix park is a long bus ride again from town and the park is only serviced by buses on a irregular basis. I suggest going with either Guinness or Jameson. They are to similar to do both. If you get there on time you might just have enough time to head up to St. Stephens Green which is a nice little park in the city centre, lots of ducks and stuff. Beyond that I don't know what to suggest, enjoy though!"
Dublin,3e5slk,breaker4,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"Whilst I agree that OP shouldn't go to Phoenix Park, it's wrong to say it's got an irregular bus service.   The 25, 26, 46a, 66, 66A, 66B, 67, 145, and red Luas line will all get you within 2 minutes walk of the main gate. Plus some other buses that stop at Heuston I can't remember.  If OP were desperate, the 747 bus will leave them at Heuston as well, and it runs from 5am. But I wouldn't rush to go there if I only had 5 hours in Dublin."

We all stand back to let them on first and as I was getting on, last, the bus driver closes the door on my foot and starts driving off with me banging on the door and my gf screaming at the driver to stop and let me on. He didn't and drove to the next stop and told my gf to get out as well as her friends while I'm tearing up the road behind them all."
Dublin,3dykaa,HappyLeprachaun,15,Mon Jul 20 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"It was absolutely lashing rain and a man who looked like he had cerebral palsy got on. He took a while getting his coins out (understandly because he had tremors) with the bus driver giving him abuse the entire time. It turned out that he didn't have the correct fare so everyone started digging in their pockets and a guy in front stepped forward to give it.   The bus driver, fed up at that point refused to take the change and ordered the drenched, shaking man off of the bus. When he refused to go the bus driver started spouting some story about how he recognised him as a man who had tried to jump off his bus a month before, and how he refused to carry him and would call the guards if he didn't step off the bus immediately. The man was protesting, saying it wasn't him, and what was he talking about. You could see talking didn't come easy to the guy as well, he was struggling to get words out and he looked so embarrassed at being made a spectacle of. People on the bus were also yelling at the driver, but he said he wasn't moving until the guy got off. Your man eventually gave up and ended up getting off of the bus and back into the rain.  I made a report about it to Dublin bus, who knows if anything came of it. I hate to believe that someone would throw a disabled passenger out into the rain because they took too long getting busfare, but I'm fairly sure that's what happened. I mean, he was starting at the man for two minutes while he fished for change, why did the driver only refuse to drive the guy after all of that and not the second he stepped onto the bus if that story was real?"

Dublin,3dykaa,irishemperor,8,Mon Jul 20 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"I posted a while ago a rant about a dick of a driver.  I was getting the night link a few years ago, a guy at the stop was deaf & asking about a certain stop.  The guy got on the bus and was trying to type on this ancient phone to ask the driver about his stop. Driver yelled at him for taking too long and told him to get off the bus.  I went to the driver to try and explain that the guy wasn't drunk, but deaf & trying to ask a question via his phone. Driver then shouted at me.  The deaf guy got on, I asked around about his stop / where he was going but nobody could help.  One guy said it to the driver as he was getting off that there was a man who didn't know where he was going and could he look out for him, the driver yelled at him that its already his stop and told him to get off the bus.  I was so concerned about this poor man, as we got closer to my stop I told him to get off at my stop and I'd call a taxi for him, he said he had no money, I offered to give him some money but he refused.  A friend of a friend who I've met once or twice was on the bus and offered to help after I got off. She messaged me on FB the next day and said he got home safely.  I couldn't believe that anyone could be as rude as that driver was.  Its the nightbus, its the driver's job to get people home safely.  To have such little regard for someone's safety, not to mention the time of night and that this guy happened to have a disability.  I lodged a complaint with Dublin Bus, but not sure anything came of it.  Also - it was a bus I took on a weekly basis and the driver's were nothing but wonderful, stopping at my road so I wouldn't have to walk home from the bus stop (even though its only a 5 minute walk), I was totally shocked that the driver would be so unhelpful and straight up mean."

Dublin,3dykaa,tama_gotchi,3,Wed Jul 22 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"I had ongoing issues with them for a LOOONG time before I moved. Key email details provided below.      ""Dear Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority,     I have made numerous complaints with Dublin Bus over the past 12 - 18 months about the 47 bus route and have rarely received any level of satisfaction or resolution/conclusion. These complaints have ranged from repeated lateness to scheduled service, complete failure of the scheduled service to run, unannounced changes to routes, unacceptable levels of customer service both by the drivers and the recipients of the emails and malicious and illegal actions by drivers.     Before I raise this with the Office of the Ombudsman directly I am giving you one final opportunity to rectify all matters raised by me to an appropriate level of satisfaction.     If I have not heard an adequate response from your by 17:30 on Monday, XXX 2014 outlining how you intend to resolve this matter, and the expected time-frames, I will be contacting the Office of the Ombudsman.      I also contacted the National Roads Authority, the Road Safety Authority, The Consumers Association of Ireland and cc'ed in Dublin Bus.       subject:  Accusation of unprofessional, malicious and illegal activity of Dublin Bus driver.     ""To whom it may concern,     I was the victim earlier this evening of what can only be described as a horrendous display of unprofessional, malicious, abusive, immature and illegal action by the driver the 47 southbound service departing from the city centre at 18:45 on Wednesday XXX. The registration number of the bus in question is 132-D-XXXX.     I would like to officially request the on-board CCTV footage of the driver's cab of the vehicle referenced above as a direct consequence of the following events of this evening:     Due to the unavoidable disruption caused by the road works on Fleet Street where the 47 bus is due to depart from, i crossed to the first bus stop that I knew the 47 bus was due to pass, the stop behind Pearse St Garda Station.     I waited there with a second passenger and a uniformed Dublin Bus employee (unknown name). The 3 of us all shared the intention and tried to hail the 47 bus as it passed.      The bus failed to stop, but did, in fact, slow sufficiently for my fellow hopeful passenger to run beside the vehicle. For roughly 50 metres the bus proceeded to maintain roughly a 1 metre distance in front of the late 40's lady, only stopping once arriving at a set of red traffic lights.     While at these red traffic lights my fellow traveler tried to communicate with the passenger that due to the road works, we needed to get on the bus at our current location. The driver took undue pleasure in informing us that he couldnt stop at his current location (in the middle of traffic). The smug grin on his face enticed me to take out my mobile phone and take a picture of the registration number of the vehicle.  Upon seeing my actions, the driver beckoned me to take a photo of himself giving me the ""two thumbs up"". I attempted to capture this prime moment, but unfortunately only got a shot of the driver with both his hands on the wheel.  Acknoledging that I wouldnt be getting on the bus at its current location, i proceeded to walk in the direction that the bus was headed expected to be passed at any time by said bus.     It is with great shock that between the Irish Times building and Tara Street Bridge, the same Dublin Bus slowed to roughly my walking pace and proceeded to slowly over take me.      I would like to clearly state here that there is absolutely no embellishment at all regarding the following events. The driver of said bus had slowed his vehicle to slightly above walking pace and proceeded to overtake me while holding his own telephone up towards me (implying that he was recording the entire incident) while shaking the middle finger of his other hand up and down at me. I clarify that neither of his hands were engaged in operating the vehicle he was supposedly in control of; one was engaging in exceptional customer service while the other was engaging in an illegal activity - namely operating a mobile telephone device while in control of a vehicle.     This is not the first complaint of dangerous and illegal driving that I have brought to D.B. but hopefully, with the assistance of the CAI, will be the first adequately resolved complaint. I fear that without the weight of the CAI behind me on my request, it will be dealt with in a similar fashion to my previous complaints and that I will inevitably be told in a number of weeks that their policy is to record over the CCTV after X number of days. Hopefully more immediate resolution will be forthcoming.""      I was contacted by the Head of Public Transport Regulation for the National Transport Authority who had contacted the Operations Manager with Dublin Bus on my behalf. He also informed me that the National Transport Authority had raised my issues with Dublin Bus at their monthly face to face.      ""The Authority has made it very clear to Dublin Bus the importance of maintaining service on low frequency routes such as Route 47 and awaits confirmation that arrangements are in hand to ensure their control staff have been reminded of this requirement and that the situation will be monitored on a regular and ongoing basis.     The Authority will continue to raise issues with Dublin Bus to assist the continuous improvement in the reliability and punctuality of services and also the response to individual customer service issues.""       Almost all of these emails were written while I was waiting for buses that were late."

Dublin,3dykaa,RoryH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:28 2015 UTC,"I had been waiting for the last 122 of the night and had been left standing at the bus stop with another person for 40 minutes in the pissing rain. The other person eventually gave up waiting and went back to the house he was in, but I persisted. When the bus finally arrived 40 minutes late the driver was visibly frustrated. There were 3 passengers getting off the bus and 2 of them were a pair of friends. The first girl came down the stairs and asked the driver could he wait a second while the second girl could get her bearings as she had fallen asleep, the driver then proceeded to march up the stairs shouting at the top of his lungs that ""I have a family to get home to"" and rushes the girls off the bus. I then walk up to the door and ask what the delay had been to which he replies that he knows nothing and repeats ""I have a family to get home to"". I told me again that he was late and he just mockingly shut the doors on me and turned the lights inside the bus off and sped away, leaving me stranded in the pissing rain at midnight and having to walk over 45 minutes home. The next morning I went into Dublin Bus on O'Connell street to complain and the man there was very helpful (for a change) and within 5 days the manager of the depot called me to personally apologise for what happened and informed me that the driver had been given a formal warning. A few weeks later I got the same bus driver at the same time and no doubt he remembered who I was and was ever so kind to me haha."
Dublin,3dykaa,hoganusrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:51 2015 UTC,"I hailed a bus once, a 145 southbound on the N11.   I paid my fair and was on the bus for about 2 minutes without incident. The bus was utterly wedged, so full I couldn't make my way back past the driver's cabin. I was basically stuck standing at the driver's door. He looked at me and said nothing.   The driver was talking on the phone, and must not have seen a hazard coming, because he suddenly jammed on, causing everyone to surge forward. I stayed upright but a few people fell over.   Luckily no one was hurt, but it was dodgy.  This must've given him a fright cause he hung up the phone. Then he turns and says about our fall ""THAT'S WHY I TOLD YIS TO BLOODY KEEP BACK, ISN'T IT!"". (First thing I'd heard him say)   I'm 2 foot from him so he's basically screaming in my face. Bad enough.   Then he says, to me directly ""GET BACK BEHIND THE LINE THEN! (Under his breath) yih fuckin midget""   I say ""the bus is too full, there's people, I can't"" because I actually couldn't.   So, he does the natural thing and leans out the window of his cab with one hand and just starts trying to physically push me backwards into the others. It was too fumbly to actually move me anywhere but I was really annoyed about it all the same.   Loads of people got off a few stops later, and I managed to move down the back away from him.   I was too shocked by what'd happened to make a complaint which I really regret now."

Dublin,3dxyht,gahane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:00 2015 UTC,Well fg want an overall majority like the tory's have now so they will have to go harder and faster across the board to try get that. They're just using the position of size of party power early to try undercut independents and small parties who won't have the fundraised money to already have boots on the ground. You're definitely not the first person to mention canvassing around Dublin already but maybe put an 'I support [insert party here]' sticker in the window and buy a barking dog :)

A new place opened up called Beer Market in the Christchurch area,  central enough,  small,  but nice place.

Firstly, I've been exactly where you are, when I finished my course 2 yrs ago I could barely get out of bed for 3 months, cried all the time and lived on a pittance so wasn't even eating properly (that really doesn't help). I don't know of any support groups but here's a few things that might help hun (forgive me if you've heard some of them before).  Reach out to the student services dept of your college, they might know of some groups and supports that are free/ very cheap for students.  Even if it's here on reddit where there are depression subs and all talk to someone, anyone, often about how you're feeling, sharing helps.  Routine, this is very tough but find a reason to leave the house, if you're near the city centre say wander in as far a Stephens Green, sit under a tree for a bit, listen to music or something (more on this in minute)  Food, if your diet is all over the shop try get it back to normality, breakfast, lunch and dinner... It'll help stabilise your blood sugars (it's not only diabetics who can need to watch those) during the day and help with routine.  Exercise, be it a leisurely walk everyday to the nearest park or shops consider throwing something faster paced in the mix too, I went back to doing an exercise walk every evening for an hour to help tire me for bed, process the day and get a bit of fitness back.  Bed, if you're stressed you don't sleep well so try every trick you know might work for you to maintain healthy sleep patterns.  What really helps me, as I still live alone and have very limited irl contact with my mates who all live at distance is podcasts... More than tv, in fact when I'm not down in my parents I don't even watch films on my laptop any more, I just listen to podcast. The talking helps because every radio/ podcast show is designed to talk to the audience as a whole yes, but the audience of one specifically. Take the Kermode and Mayo film review show, two middle aged guys bickering over films basically but they both talk all the time to the audience as well 'if your listening and can't see Mark he's waving his hands about' or whatever... Find topics that you like, hunt down some podcasts and give it a go. Music helps too depending on the mood, music is better for the exercise walking say but I play podcasts morning noon and night, they really so help keep me sane.  I think a few days ago there was a similar thread here for a group suggestion so I'll see if I can find that, and you'll get through this k!

Dublin,3dd0ba,mattsbury,5,Wed Jul 15 08:39:50 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for somewhere handy for Greystones, and just similar to chapter one, or somewhere literally near Chapter one?   My answers will obviously be different depending on the above, but just as general advice, many of the very classy restaurants (i.e. ones likes Michelin start Chapter One) are closed Sunday/Monday, so you might wanna look at taking a step down on the fancy.   /u/louiseber nailed it, many of the best places on a Sunday are in hotels. In the City Center that means places such as The Saddle Room in the Shelbourne Hotel, or  The Cellar Restaurant in The Merrion Hotel. One Pico on Molesworth Place is also open at least for earlybirds on a Sunday. One Pico isn't quite as fancy as esteemed as Chapter One, but it's a very nice French restaurant of a similar ish style in a similar price-bracket."

My gf is a veggie and she enjoyed just as much as me. The staff are super friendly and down to earth but not imposing. I think they have a 777 Sunday where they've a food and drink menu where everything is €7.77. It's a small enough place and always seems to be busy so I'd book before. I can't recommend it enough, delicious, delicious food. I'm a fussy foodie too so that's saying something. Izakaya across the road also do an amazing whiskey sour if you're interested.

You're young and looking a part time position, not a career I assume? contrary to belief, you can just walk in and ask for a job, i've done it with success plenty.  In all honesty you will be hired because you are young, therefore cheap, flexible, desperate for work and hopefully keen to do well.  It's a given that you've no experience but that's fine.  It's the confidence they need.  You're english is fine to engage with people, you're math is presumably fine to handle money. Most people tick those boxes so it falls to the soft skills, communication, presentation and confidence.  Nobody is looking through CV's to find a min wage till assistant with a strong academic background.  If anything they want the opposite, they want 'stayers'.  You are in the same boat as the rest of the crowd your age so make yourself stand out. Go in and chance your arm, get talking to decision makers at a good time and see where it leads.  The majority of people get no where because they spam out CV's online or maybe to stores and then just hope something pops up. You're odds are too low that way, too much competition."

Dublin,3d888x,PurpleWomat,2,Tue Jul 14 23:28:39 2015 UTC,"Did you ever think of just going back in and following up on a CV you handed in? Just ""hi, I gave in a CV a week ago, I was just wondering what your process for hiring is and if there is any current position's available etc. etc. Would actually show a bit of initiative on your part.   Get a friend or parent to go over your CV. You do not need a life-story and spelling mistakes is an insta-no for HR. Theres plenty of guides for this on the net.  I also hope you didn't give your CVs to just the Jo-So behind the counter cause having worked in retail near 4 years and just gotten out, any CV you didn't hand to a manager went into a drawer that got cleaned out once every two years. Always ask for someone in charge and if they aren't there come back when they are.  Finally your hire-ability for the jobs you've described is usually less skills based and more you won't be a total tool for the staff and customers to get on with, so be polite and talkative when you deal with any of the staff in the places you're trying, holding a conversation for more than 30 seconds while handing in a CV will literally set you apart from 70% of applicants.   Once you get to the interview stage the most common rejection for these jobs at this point is usually either lack of drive in the interviewee (couldn't give a shite or lied to get there) or lack of experience so if the latter's the case just drop the old ""what I lack in experience, I make up for in an ability to learn new things quickly and the eagerness I have for learning new skills."" 9 times out of 10 you'll be trained for the first few weeks anyways."

Dublin,3d888x,louiseber,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:52:51 2015 UTC,"That's all solid advice and my years of retail up North can confirm.  Best results I had finding a job like this was always in person. The odd time I talked my way into jobs that didn't exist and weren't being advertised. Online you're a number in a mass of emails, on paper you might be able to sell yourself well but it needs to go to the right person.  A good bit of advice to get to the decision maker, drop in one day and ask who's the owner/ manager. Make sure to get a name and ideally a time they are in the office.   Once you've that you can call in the next time with a diff member of staff, just casually ask ""is X in? He should be doing paperwork at this time I think?"",   the staff assume you know the boss and all barriers quickly breakdown (Used it on the phone a lot too).  They'll generally run off with the message that a friend has called in.  You'll have the bosses curiosity too because a lot of these requests die at the gatekeeper so it must be something important to have made it's way to him right?  After that you've to hit the bossman with your best salvo of charm and confidence. Smile, shake hands, have a laugh and keep the conversation flowing and chances are they'll arrange something. Bypass the whole application process and go straight for the person in charge. Landed me work in a kitchen, centra, bar and subway by doing this when in school/student."
Dublin,3d888x,ItsRhyno,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"Look into Kitchen jobs,  dishwasher/kitchen porter.   Prob won't suit your school hours when it kicks off but it's a no qual/ no exp role.  Ask for the head chef in restaurants or the manager, not supervisor or below.  Cornershops/subways are a good one.  Sometimes privately owned or franchised you can catch the owner in the shop and get a decision on the spot. till assistant, floor staff, sandwhich artist.  all no exp/qual roles.  Another option to consider is some voluntary work like in a charity shop for experience and references. I did it for Action Cancer, shows you're keen to work and hearts in the right place kinda.  Yet another option is to create your own work.  Consider the viability of something like a neighbourhood car wash.  Check with the 30-40 people nearest you to see if they'd be up for having their car washed as often/little as they like without leaving the house.  Even if it fails you've shown the drive to actually do something plus it's good experience. Talking to public, generating sales, building relationships with clients, discussing money and following up bills etc.   You can turn 'I washed my neighbours car' into 'I developed all the skills necessary to get a business off the ground but school commitments/ local demand made it non-viable long term.'"

There are loads of great places to eat and drink, and you'd be rarely stuck. Its nice that there are so many parks too, the good weather is a little rare but when it is nice it's a beautiful city. I do love how close to Dublin Co. Wicklow is, on the weekends you can get a bus there and go hiking for the day in places like Glendalough (one of our national parks), go for cycles in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains, mountain bike, orienteer and rock climb (to name a few things) and not feel like you live in a city. There are also places north of the city like Howth which are beautiful seaside towns. If you surf there is also the west coast of Ireland, which is 3.5hr drive, but has amazing surf at times and is well worth the drive.

When someone buys you a drink, you're now in a round and owe them, and everyone else at the table a drink, get comfortable.   it usually takes about 3 trips to get any 1 thing done.  Irish women? Good luck. Loads of foreign ladies in Dublin however. I met my wife in Dublin, she was going to Trinity at the time and she's Russian.   Most of my best friends are Irish men, sound lads, always got your back. Be a good freind to them and they will a be good friend to you.   Things I missed? Real BBQ, real Mexican food (the Mexican on offer in Dublin isn't Mexican) cheap gasoline.  Ireland also has some gems we don't have like, like Cineworld's Unlimited Card, for €22 per month, all the films you can watch. Deep fried battered Mars bars. Murphy's Stout on tap. Most importantly, County Kerry, dear Lord, that is gorgeous.

To be honest, the hardest part of adjusting was the food here. The milk/bread/cheese/fruit/everything goes bad WAY faster than it did back in the States. This calls for more trips to Tesco on your way home from work, buying less at a time and more frequently. I truly miss Target and CVS, but nothing in the States compares to Penney's. I think it's quite an easy place to adjust to and I would stay here permanently if it weren't for school back home :)"

Dublin,3d1zku,Versk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:30:09 2015 UTC,It won't get any easier when you start working. Housing in this city is beyond crisis point and unless there is a significant change in policy away from private funded housing builds it will remain this way for a very very long time. In my recent search for accommodation the issue that I found particularly disturbing was the number of Ads on daft for shared accommodation that said Females only. I'd say it was around 50%  and I find this gender discrimination quite shocking. The other issue is the level of overcrowding in some properties where you know the migrant workers are sharing 3-4 to a room. Obviously this reduces their individual costs but it also doesn't get adequately reflected within the overall housing issue because it's rarely reportd or factored in. The number of properties failing basic standards was recently evidenced after inspections and from personal experience I can tell you there are many Landlords who don't gice a fuck about the state of the property they rent to you. They just want the cash. In a country with incompetent oversight on just about everything and a laissez-fare attitude to this issue you'd be well advised to complete your studies and get the fuck out of the place. Just grit your teeth in the meantime.

A note of caution is that a lot of places exercise a 23s policy to keep out underagers as they risk their licences if caught with people under 18 on the premises, I don't know how mature you guys look but make sure to bring suitable ID with you and don't be surprised if you are turned away from a few places. Drinks in the Temple Bar zone are really expensive so watch out for that too."

All lost property in taxis now go to one of 5 garda stations in Dublin (see link). These stations don't have a central logging system so you'll need to call each one individually. You might have trouble getting an answer during the weekend. Not a terribly efficient system but what can you do?   I was lucky enough that a nice taxi man dropped my list wallet into a station and the guards got hold of me using my ID.   Good luck!  http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=100

Dublin,3ctux5,PurpleWomat,4,Fri Jul 10 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"""old city"" is not a term that is used in Dublin. The City council might try to use it, but it's not in actual use. Dublin doesn't have an ""old town"" bit like many other European cities."

Dublin,3coqym,ImNotClever12345,10,Thu Jul 9 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Not totally sure about down south but from what I gather under UK law at least, it was the hotels negligence that allowed 2 men to walk in and steal your belongings therefore they should be liable in some way. You did nothing wrong at all, you took all reasonable steps to keep your gear secure i.e. by asking the staff to keep it secured, as is normal expectation for a hotel.  They will try to fob you off by pointing you at a sign or the T&C's but if you escalate it to head office or something then they'll pay attention.  You might be entitled to getting even a small amount per item stolen. It won't be the full cost of your stuff but it's something to give that hotel a kick in the ass to sort out it's security. I would get in contact.   I've stayed in other places in the area and they'd issue tickets like a cloakroom.  Also you should check whatever insurance you have to see if it'll cover you."

Copan is for the young and sexy and tragically hip,  Grace Kelly's has pretty scary locals, but has a brilliant live trad session on Saturday nights  Blackbird is pretty modern with a young, but not-quite-hip crowd, week day nights are the best; Friday and Saturday tends to get packed and have a pile of D4 types in,   Rody Bollands is full of country lads and lasses on the lash, bit rowdy, and loud musics.

Dublin,3cfenc,TheDataWhore,5,Tue Jul 7 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"I just checked and 52k US is 47k Euro. There is no way any bar staff would make anywhere near that. Shit, a salary like that would nearly put you in the top 20% of earners."
Dublin,3cfenc,bonesfordoorhandles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"That's kinda crazy to me, but makes sense as most of her wages were tips.   Say if you come home with $200 a night in tips, plus you only get paid $2 an hour.   Also, almost all bartenders in America only pay taxes on a fraction of those tips too.   Can't believe there is such a disparity."
Dublin,3cfenc,TheDataWhore,2,Tue Jul 7 19:49:54 2015 UTC,Tips is not custom here in Ireland for bartenders like it is in the US

Dublin,3cfenc,buckfastqueen,2,Fri Jul 10 11:57:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I'm a barmaid in the city centre. As I'm new I only make €10 an hour but I usually make around €50 a day in tips. I have a friend who works in a really posh club around the corner who never makes less than €200 a weekend though, so you can get lucky.  Try and work in hotels. ;)"
Dublin,3cfgl3,ess161,5,Tue Jul 7 14:31:33 2015 UTC,"If you're going to be here for a while, you'd probably be better to take a short term rental for a month (though the dogs are going to cause a major headache on that front) or airbnb and go hunting yourself, especially as you have pets. Real estate agents in Ireland don't usually act for the buyer/renter in the same way that they do in the US and the few that specialise in it suck big time."
Dublin,3cfgl3,PurpleWomat,3,Tue Jul 7 15:33:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I think air bnb is a great short-term option while I search for apartments myself. On air bnb I already found a place in center city which welcomes dogs that I could rent for $880 a month- very doable with my budget. Do you think a month would be long enough to find my own place? I have no idea how long the leasing process is for Dublin apartments. Thanks again!
Dublin,3cfgl3,PurpleWomat,3,Tue Jul 7 16:05:53 2015 UTC,"http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ is the best place to get info about the renting process. They're very helpful if you have any questions.   As with any competitive rental market, a lot is going to depend on you. Landlords prefer professionals to students, a lot of them prefer females, etc., the usual. With pets, you might have more long term success finding a house share as houses are more likely to take pets than apartments."
Dublin,3cfgl3,robin9585,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks again! I'm a female and a professional so I'm two for two there, but I know the dogs will be a problem. I'll have to think about the house share option."
Dublin,3cfgl3,Devrol,2,Tue Jul 7 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty fantastic Air BnB deal. Anyway, once you land, there isn't a particularly huge amount of apartments in Dublin, but you should be able to find a place within 10 days or so. I was far more flexible (no pets) and I found a place in about 5 days."
Dublin,3cfgl3,ninjawasp,4,Tue Jul 7 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"You'll have lots of difficulties with the dogs. Very few places will allow pets, and there's some hoops to jump through to be allowed to bring them into the country ."

There is live music on in bars, choice of venues and good atmosphere. It is more expensive than bars off the beaten track but you will be guaranteed a good night. I'm Irish and regularly pop into Temple Bar for drinks before going elsewhere."
Dublin,3ccxqm,Rach_,3,Mon Jul 6 23:27:05 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you
Dublin,3ccxqm,CaptainEarlobe,3,Mon Jul 6 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"As an american living in Dublin, Temple bar is a bit more expensive, but it is easy to have a lot of fun in that area, plus you can pop into some of the smaller pubs without having to walk too far.  If you're only spending a couple of nights here, it won't hurt to check it out!"
Dublin,3ccxqm,funkyavocado,2,Tue Jul 7 10:07:57 2015 UTC,"Temple Bar is fine for a tourist, it's busy enough and always has some decent live music.  The novelty wears thin a bit (been here a few months now) and you might prefer to go somewhere cheaper but that's not likely to happen over a night or 2.  Temple Bar gets slated here because it's pretty much just a tourist attraction.  It's the same back up in Belfast, all tourists are pointed at the Cathedral Quarter but I can't stand those bars for more than a pint or two.  The Laughter Lounge comedy club kicks off about 7, I've been there and it was good. Walking distance to temple bar for drinks after. Should have something on for the Sat."
Dublin,3ccxqm,infected_2,2,Tue Jul 7 10:58:23 2015 UTC,"This really depends on what kind of pubs you're interested in. If you want ones that are rammed full of people and have a party atmosphere, Temple Bar is for you. I agree with the other guys, it's not as bad as people make out but most locals wouldn't frequent it too often.  If you're looking for what miserable Dublin gits like me would call a 'proper pub,' then I'd suggest Mulligans on Poolbeg street. It's not cheap either and has it's fair share of Americans (it was a James Joyce haunt and is a stop on the Bloomsday tour) but the beer is always good, the pub is very old and the staff are top notch....just don't go in thinking you're all fancy!  Second suggestion for a great old Dublin pub in the centre of the city is The Long Hall. This is on South Great George's Street. George's Street has become a very busy street again in the last ten years with lots of bars and restaurants which are pretty modern. In the middle of that is the Long Hall. Like an oasis in the desert. Last refurbished in 1890, it's the definition of a classic Dublin pub.   The Guinness in both these pubs is like the nectar of the gods."

Dublin,3cc6f8,queev,10,Mon Jul 6 20:37:37 2015 UTC,Split the rent into  €750 for rooms and  €750 for shared spaces.  €250 rent payable by each bedroom and then €187.50 per person for shared spaces. Split utilities evenly amongst the 4 of you.
Dublin,3cc6f8,ireland123,5,Mon Jul 6 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"It's a tricky situation, yes you share a bedroom while the others have their own room. But you have to understand you guys are also  sharing the common areas too.   Since you and your GF are in the bigger room you should be paying slightly more than the girls in the single room. But I wouldn't be paying it per person either (Since they have their own rooms)  Work it out with them. Explain the reasons above and decide on a figure an example would be 450 for the two single rooms and 600 for the double (So you'd pay 300)"
Dublin,3cc6f8,Kenno90,3,Mon Jul 6 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't split it up by people because you guys are sharing a room while they're getting one to themselves each, but you are getting a larger room, so to me the fair option would be to pay a slightly larger share than them. Like for instance instead of everyone paying 500, the you and gf pay one sum of 550 and each of the girls pays 475. But really it's something to figure out between you guys, because any way works as long as all of you are satisfied with the arrangement."

Dublin,3byqm7,frikisada,23,Fri Jul 3 06:30:27 2015 UTC,"I've been homeless twice, never at my own choosing. The first time back in 2004, I had been on the Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown housing list (one of the quicker moving lists) 9 years.   The second time was in 2008 and because I had been homeless before ('04) I had bumped up the housing list but still hadn't been housed in the intervening 5 years.  I'm still on the housing list after 20 years. The truth is for a single person it is unlikely I'll ever receive a council house. I can get rent allowance (only if you're unemployed) and find a private rented place, but again for a single person my rent limit is about €90 for shared or €115 for single person. That means that if the rent is higher than that I wont get the allowance. Plus finding a landlord that takes rent allowance is easy (you must seem lazy/no good if you're not working).  I know people with kids who have been on the housing list as long as me and kids are now grown and left home.  In other words your friend is talking bollix. If he gets his info from government issued reports he's get told bullshit. Focus Ireland (homeless charity) would have more honest figures."

Dublin,3byqm7,Tadhg,2,Fri Jul 3 06:42:20 2015 UTC,I commend you. More people need to ask these questions about how your government operates in regard to this issue.

In the meantime, you can apply for rent supplement but the rent caps for Dublin are 350 for sharing a house & 520 for a single bed studio apartment/flat. Daft used to have an option in the advanced search to show only accomodations that accept rent allowance. The govt put a stop to landlords saying in listings they wouldn't accept rent allowance, thinking it would help people being discriminated against, but it's actually made it even harder to find appropriate properties now, as landlords will simply decline you in person. In addition you've got the constant increases in rent, so finding something beneath the caps (imposed a few years ago when rents were lower) is very difficult indeed."

Dublin,3br7zh,ArcadeRivalry,4,Wed Jul 1 14:29:19 2015 UTC,You could message cats aid on face book They often have appeals for missing and found cats.   Really hope everything is ok in the end either way.  Was the dog owner at least apologetic?
Dublin,3br7zh,BallPointPariah,12,Wed Jul 1 20:35:52 2015 UTC,"He came back to ""apologise"" but it was literally ""sorry about that bud"" didn't really seem to feel bad about it. I suspect he's put all the blame on his dog. I lost the plot a bit at him like and he was really defensive. Said we should have kept the cat inside, he didn't know that cats could be outdoor pets, his dog ""wouldn't hurt a fly"". Was very very defensive about the whole thing. Didn't seem to accept that it was just a very very stupid thing he did and he should feel guilty for it, instead went for more of the ""Sorry, i'll get you a new cat if you want otherwise there's nothing else I can do"" route.   we managed to get into the apartments and find the cat yesterday though. I was in shock she was still alive after two days in that heat without being able to drink. Brought her straight to the vet expecting her to be put down. vet said she was very lucky, no broken bones just the skin has been pulled off her Jaw and there were maggots in it. She has to stay in for a few days to get cleaned up and operated on but the vet seemed very positive she's going to be ok! Delighted."
Dublin,3br7zh,PurpleWomat,3,Thu Jul 2 08:29:28 2015 UTC,So glad the cat is okay! You should report the guy for having a dangerous dog in case it does the same thing to someone else's cat.
Dublin,3br7zh,BallPointPariah,2,Thu Jul 2 08:54:40 2015 UTC,I often let the local vet know the description of dogs I see going after cats/kids or other dogs and where I saw them.  Although my neighbour and I after much discussion recently reported a local dog owner to the local dog warden.  We had previously spoken to the owner after next doors granddaughter narrowly escaped having her face eaten because I saw what was happening.  The dog is a massive malamute that is just left loose and you often see kids crying with the dog pinning them against walls or following them growling.  When we spoke to the owner he was all what do you expect me to do?   Keep your fucking horse of a dog from wandering around trying to eat everything smaller than it!  No guilt.  I stopped him going after a seven year old last week and had to walk her home she was crying so badly.  Pretty certain eventually the dog will maim some poor kid.
Dublin,3br7zh,BallPointPariah,2,Thu Jul 2 09:34:14 2015 UTC,"I was talking to the vet about it, I was so angry when he called back I didn't even think to ask for his name and address. But to be honest I very much doubt he would have given them to me. The vet did say I can ring someone the organisation who look after watching dogs (forget the feckin name now) and report that he walks around our area and they'll keep an eye out. My girlfriends friend says he thinks he may see him often walking around Fairview (the dog owner said he was from there) and is going to keep an eye out."
Dublin,3br7zh,BallPointPariah,3,Thu Jul 2 10:25:22 2015 UTC,"That's great! I'm really happy for you, very lucky!  Some dog owners can be major pricks. I live opposite the entrance to a local park near ballyfermot and the amount of dog attacks that occur is f*cking stupid. If people just kept them on a leash it would be fine.  My cat is usually only ever outside with me as I'm an avid gardener. The amount of times dogs have come legging it out of the park, into my garden after my cat is unreal, they often chase him through our house into the back garden before the owners appear. Either to just give a brisk whistle and piss off, or with their ha has isn't he such a scamp! BS  I know this is a bold question, but my own cat is fairly sick at the mo, did it cost a bomb for the vet?  I don't have pet insurance and I'm dreading him needing anything else done.  A major injury is my worst nightmare till I can get him covered again."
Dublin,3br7zh,BallPointPariah,2,Thu Jul 2 09:24:35 2015 UTC,"I know! Its ridiculous seeing people walking around Dublin without them on leads. My parents always had 4 German shepards in the house and I loved them. Absolutely lovely dogs and very docile but jesus I would never ever walk outside the house with them not on a lead. They could easily take up the idea to go for something around. Its the stupidest fucking thing ever to just think ""ah he's grand"".  The vet actually cost a lot less than expected! We were expecting to go in and if it was fixable it would be completely out of our price range.  The Vet said that they expect to have her in for about 3 days and with the surgery and the stay it's going to cost €350. Not exactly a drop in the ocean for me but it's affordable compared to what I expected. The cat was a stray that we took in and our neighbors take care of her too so we're going to split the price. The vet said there's a possibility she could recover earlier and it would be cheaper too. I don't think they charge for a ""quote"" for want of a better term. The vet gave us a full run down of exactly what was wrong and what needed to be done and then told us the price if we wanted to go ahead with it so there's no harm in getting it checked at least!"
Dublin,3br7zh,BallPointPariah,2,Thu Jul 2 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"That's good.  We've had some issues with cat poisoning in the area.   It happened to him about a month ago but he survived, apparently because he's so hefty (10kg) in a smaller cat the dose editor have been lethal.  They over the weekend it happened again and he appears to have hurt himself on his way home.  He's on antiinflammatory meds and antibiotics but so far it's cost us around €120"
Dublin,3br7zh,dublinirish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:43:19 2015 UTC,"Jesus that's steep enough to just begin with! Hope he's ok in the end! Out of curiosity actually have you had any experience with out of hours vet care?   Have to say I'm a bit shocked at how little help there is around Dublin. We originally took in the cat as a stray at and most shelters told us to fuck off. Then when the cat was attacked on Monday the only vet that was working was in Terenure, who told us that he'd put it down if we wanted but that's it."
Dublin,3br7zh,fidelcat,2,Thu Jul 2 11:46:42 2015 UTC,"My local vet is anicare.  Each evening one of the anicare vets in Dublin takes on the role of vet on call.  So when we phoned our own vet on Saturday we were transferred to one in clontarf.  €80 consultation fee if you want to bring the animal in after hours.  But they're mad sound and never push for it.  Whenever I've phoned they've spent as long as is necessary chatting to me, offering advice. No charge for calling.  Luckily my vet opens on Saturdays and Sundays too.  There's the animal hospital in UCD too that are 24 hour 365 days a year.  Have had friends who worked there.  But to the best of my knowledge it's €125 for walking in the door.  Anicare have links to and offer cage space to catsaid of at least they did three years ago, I was told they dedicated up to 20% of their cattery space for it. So they're generally very sound about strays and support.  They offer discounts on Thursdays for some services too.  The palmerstown branch has one American vet called Kim who is particularly sound and thorough.  It's terrible that places were assholes about taking on a stray.  The blue cross can help if you're really stuck for cash.  I donate to them whenever I can. They bring a mobile vet to various areas of Dublin once a week. Every Wednesday they are in ballyfermot at 18:30 at the massive roundabout. They're under a lot of pressure since so many people fell on hard times though."
Dublin,3br7zh,fidelcat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:05:30 2015 UTC,Is the blue cross mobile vet free? I wouldn't mind getting the cat a checkup once she's back to see if there's any other problems with her. I don't think her eyesight is the best.
Dublin,3br7zh,fidelcat,2,Thu Jul 2 12:27:14 2015 UTC,I think just bringing them in is free. If you've no money they won't turn you away and will do what they can.  I think it works more on a suggested donation system.  But it's much much cheaper than a normal vet.  Going is mayhem btw. All sorts of animals in very long lines.   If you check out their website it'll have more info.
Dublin,3br7zh,irishemperor,2,Thu Jul 2 12:47:02 2015 UTC,good to hear your cat is on the mend! i can literally picture the dog owner in my mind from the description you gave.
Dublin,3btscy,21Exploration,8,Thu Jul 2 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at this:  I know you asked for clubs, but one thing I would suggest would be to look up any gigs that are on those days. Lots of acts travel through Dublin and they usually play in great venues (Vicar Street,  the Button Factory). That would be my first try.  I'm not so much into the suit/shirt/shoes scene so I like the Workman's Club. Several rooms and a big terrace, reliably messy and fun. If you want something a bit more upscale you can go to the Liquor Rooms next door, which has a nicer decor and slightly older crowd.  You can check out the Black Door, which is a shirt/shoes type of place, more upscale as well. There are a few clubs on the same street which are all different as far as quality. One of those is Copper Face Jack's where taste and dignity go to die (in a good way).  You can also check out Whelan's which is fun and has a good number of locals."

Its literally the weirdest atmosphere every. Like call me maybe was played at least 4 times an hour there, when it was just released. Honestly if you want to go to a club, where everyone is drunk and wants to have fun. Its the ideal club. Its not 100% mad on it(weird older crowd and the music is ok), but I have never meant anyone unpleasant at it and never not had a good time on it.  Workmans is good. But considered ""ALT"" for some people. So its not for all."
Dublin,3btscy,remix6464,3,Thu Jul 2 22:52:27 2015 UTC,"I always suggest Diceys Garden. It's fairly nice, partly outdoors, and plays good music. Drink specials too on certain days."
Dublin,3btscy,Noble_Ox,3,Thu Jul 2 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hanger or Twisted Pepper if you wanna good night rolling.  This page is worth a look.  The Lost Society if you want a bit more class.  Button Factory has some good nights.  Someone else mentioned Coppers (Copper Face Jacks), I'd avoid it as it's an over priced tourist trap full of culchies."
Dublin,3btscy,ArcadeRivalry,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:47:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be really into clubs anymore but I'll give it a go.  Pub crawls are the way forward. Dublin is that small you can just hop around from place to place until you find somewhere decent. Although if you're going to clubs you'll probably have to pay in which will make this a bit more difficult.   Diceys, as remix6464 said, is probably the best if you're looking for the proper ""nightclub"" thing. Big outdoor area.   I'd also recomend the globe/rira for a good night out. Free in and usually some good tunes. Workmans is also good for this. The grand social is also a decent enough ""alternative"" music night but I'm not a big fan.  If you're preferred method of intoxication for the night isn't drink then I'd say button factory.  Obviously this is just my opinion, everyone is going to tell you a different story, but unless ""suit/shirt/shoes"" for you counts as brown leather shoes, boot cut jeans and a jack and jones shirt then definitely stay away from coppers."
Dublin,3btscy,ArcadeRivalry,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:01:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Lets switch the question up though. You mentioned pub crawls are probably a better choice. Any specific places worth seeking out on the way?
Dublin,3btscy,hikydh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:09:21 2015 UTC,"A good pub is a difficult thing to explain I suppose. I'd recommend staying on the southside of the city though. Baggot street is a good spot, there's a thing here people do called ""the baggot mile"" which is basically just starting at the stephen's green end of Baggot street and crawling your way to the ballbridge end. I think it starts in O'donoghues which is a good spot. Toners is also there.   Pmacs just off Grafton street is good. Could then move down St. William Street or Georges street to the long hall. Then Stags head and dame lane are close to there. I also hear great things about the library bar on Exchequer street for a quiet one.   That's the beauty of a crawl though, drop in if you think it looks good, if it's shite, you can down your pint and fuck off somewhere else."
Dublin,3btscy,deanpala,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"Xico on Baggot street is a good spot. Serves til 3sh, small smoking area though. If you do go, pop into Toners pub right next door for a drink."

Dublin,3bgh8w,slims_s,12,Mon Jun 29 03:01:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of the advice i'd give would depend pretty heavily on where you're moving from/to, and also why and for how long.    Housing: Do you already have a place to live? If you show up in Dublin to househunt, you're gonna have a bad time. Some things to keep in mind, as our 'renting culture' is a little different from other places:    The cost-gap between living alone (in, say, a studio) and sharing an apartment (in, say, a 3 bed with 2 housemates) is a lot bigger than in other places. Mostly a supply and demand thing.  daft.ie is probably the best website for finding accommodation. Free to use for house-hunters.  If you're looking for a house-share, expect to deal with the incumbent tenants, rather than the landlord. It's common practice for landlords to just let the tenants pick/vet their new housemate (I thought this was the case everywhere, but apparently not...)  We're in the middle of a fairly big housing drought - so even if you accept living with housemates, and have first-month's-rent/deposit and work/landlord/character references in hand, still expect to jump through hoops and 'sell yourself' to get a room in D1,2,7,8 and 4, and anywhere decent just about anywhere else.   Public transport: Do you drive?    It looks like you'll be working in Dublin 2, where transport connections are quite good. The dart passes within walking distance of most places, lots of busses etc.  If you do end up living in the city center, the citybike scheme is actually quite good and I would recommend it. You pay €20 per year for a membership card, then you can borrow a bike whenever you want (first 30 mins is free, more than enough time 95% of the time) and then it's a euro or two per hour after that. Lots of bikee stations all over the city center.  Traffic isn't the worst in Dublin, but it's not great. If you're working in D2, and living somewhere with decent transport links, the bus is much faster if you need to be in for 9. The dart much moreso.  Night buses: Sunday through Thursday, there are none. Last Dublin Bus/Dart leaves at 23:30. Last LUAS leaves at 00:30. This is a pretty big gotcha on your first night out in Dublin. If you're new to the city, that leaves you taxis, pretty much.  Taxis: this in particular is quite expensive in Dublin. It's €4 the second you sit in the cab + €1.40 per kilometer. That's ~€25 give or take home from the city center after a night out if you're living in Dunlaoghaire or D18.   Cost: Dublin is expensive. In particular:    Alcohol is very expensive. Taxed out the wazoo. Expect to pay €5 for a pint of beer in most pubs. up to 7 in touristy areas.  Groceries are somewhat expensive. Lidl and Aldi are your friends. Their selection isn't amazing in some respects, but for the staples - veg, fruit, cuts of meat, bulk toiletries - they're very kind on the wallet.  Eating out runs the gamut of affordable to very expensive, but Dublin's pretty good for nice restaurants if you're a foody!  Nights out:    The temple bar area is very touristy, and very expensive. You might want to give it a try, for the novelty, but I wouldn't recommend it very highly. IF you know what you're at there's a few good spots in there, and you might want to give it a try for the novelty, but I wouldn't recommend it very highly as a whole.  If you just fancy trying a few places and seeing what you like, you could try: Dame Lane (lots of music-y, young, relatively trendy places. More loud bars than outright nightclubs. Georges Street is similar ('The George' is one of the better known LGBT bars if that's your bag), and Camden street lower has quite a few places on it.  IF you tell me what you're into in particular, with respect to a night out, I'm sure I can recommend something.  Irish people are very friendly and chatty, but also often quite weary of overly friendly strangers, I find. The difference in culture between Ireland and England is most pronounced here, I find. It's less common to just go out and mingle with strangers in Dublin, so you might be met with skepticism. Keep at it."
Dublin,3bgh8w,lit_IT,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:58:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot!  I realized the cost-gap after a little time on daft.ie. I'll definitely try to find someone to share a flat.  A huge thanks for the last bus information. I once ended up waiting an hour for a bus in Uppsala, because bus schedule was in Swedish and I thought only-weekend bus was gonna arrive. That's info is a life saver.   About nights out, I don't like clubs at all. What I generally expect is a bar/pub that has good music (I like indie rock/folk). Can you recommend a place like that?  And again, thanks for all other points as well, I really appreciate it!"
Dublin,3bgh8w,slims_s,4,Tue Jun 30 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Your first few days in town you should :   Get a PPS Number Get a bank account Start looking for a place to rent long-term Look into misc stuff like a LEAP card/dublin bikes card, whatever floats your boat   The PPS Number is a requisite for renting, and you'll need a bank account.  I see you said ""I'll stay in D2 for a month and then look for a place""... you're going to have a bad time if you do that. You'll quickly notice that most landlords/letting agencies are assholes who take a few days to answer your emails (if you're lucky and they ever get back to you, call if there's a number posted on daft), and you'll find yourself with other 5+ interested parties when going to a viewing, where they'll take note of your information and never call you back, most of the time. I ended up finding a place that gets available in one month, that seemed to turn a lot of people away from it so I ended up getting a pretty decent place.

Also as you get older, it's naturally gets a lot harder to make friends.  A huge chunk of people in their 30s are married/settled ""down""/ busy with babies/simply not that particularly interested in making new friends as they have an established social circle.   As such it's a different situation to making friends in ones 20s, so you'll have to be a bit more proactive.  I would say getting out of your comfort zone and trying new things would be a big thing. The more things you try the better your chances. Best of luck."

Dublin,3bffwt,redbluemangle,2,Sun Jun 28 19:18:22 2015 UTC,What time does your flight get in at
Dublin,3bffwt,louiseber,2,Sun Jun 28 19:25:18 2015 UTC,You can do a tour around Trinity College for €12 which includes entry into the Book of Kells (normally €10). Otherwise if you're not too interested in the tour around the University I can get you into the Book of Kells for free (Trinity student perk) and point out some of the fancy buildings. Just PM me.
Dublin,3bffwt,jasonbot,2,Sun Jun 28 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"The Book of Kells IMO is so NOT worth it. But it doesn't take long and the Long Room Library is gorgeous to see.  I'd say take the offer of the free tour.   Don't worry about public transport, everywhere in the city is walkable and buses are silly expensive anyway. Don't be afraid to ask anyone on the street for directions.  St Patrick's Cathedral and the surrounding area is nice... Christchurch nearby is okay.  National museum of Ireland Archeology is cool. It's close to Trinity too, on Kildare Street.   There's a Music Shop called 'Waltons' on South Great George Street where you could pick up a guitar."
Dublin,3bffwt,John-oc,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:35:01 2015 UTC,"If you wanna get a cheap guitar, head over to Music Minds on liffey street, right on the river.  Decent selection, good prices."

Use the search function to look there for information.   Don't pay anyone anything for a room before you've seen it, there are many scams around. Best plan is probably to stay in a hostel when you get here and then look for a permanent place.  There is a city bike rental scheme which you can sign up to, and then see how you find cycling in Dublin before you commit to buying a bike. Some people say you have to pretty brave to cycle in rush hour here.    Sim cards- if your smartphone is unlocked then get a prepaid card from 3.

Dublin,3auzef,End-of-level-boss,2,Tue Jun 23 19:54:05 2015 UTC,25 cent per ATM transaction would be the usual on most accounts.

Dublin,3apr71,louiseber,11,Mon Jun 22 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"The 41 is a much faster option, doesn't have to go through Whitehall, would have thought that meant less stages and therefore a cheaper fare but Dublin bus fares are less transparent than Dail procedures"
Dublin,3apr71,c0mpliant,7,Mon Jun 22 15:00:09 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure bus fare is just based on whatever the driver feels like.
Dublin,3apr71,Versk,3,Mon Jun 22 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"There is a massive element of that, I've always said the destination rather than a fare, and it used to be that depending on the driver of the day I'd be charged less.   Seems to have changed since the leap card came in though, it's more consistent."
Dublin,3apr71,c0mpliant,4,Mon Jun 22 16:18:17 2015 UTC,It fast ratchets up to full fair no matter what the route but with a leap it's 2.60 from airport to town regardless if it's a 16 or 48 (which I didn't know about tbh)
Dublin,3apr71,louiseber,5,Mon Jun 22 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"It really does depend on the route, if the bus stops less times, you get charged less I believe.   For example, I work near Booterstown, it's cheaper for me to get the 7 from the Rock Road to Dun Laoghaire, than to get the 46a from the N11 to Dun Laoghaire. It's no difference to me which stop I go to because I'm almost slap bang in the middle, but because the 46a goes all around the houses on its way, it more expensive for me."
Dublin,3apr71,c0mpliant,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that is a shorter bit of the route, airport to town is what it is"
Dublin,3apr71,louiseber,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"You can't get charged less depending on how many times the bus stops because the driver can't know where he'll stop ahead of time, when he's taking your money for example.  As always, look poor for better prices."
Dublin,3apr71,MariusBC,3,Mon Jun 22 17:32:46 2015 UTC,Its charged by the number of stops between when you get on and your destination. It doesn't matter if the bus actually stops or not.
Dublin,3apr71,ireland123,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"Prices are based on stages, but what is a stage isn't specified, it's not a stop because that would be too many. I think they've divided up the route up into stages and then the stages into a number of stops, but how many stops in a stage I don't know, is it based on distance, number of stops or others.   In my example above of the two bus routes, they both travel to the same destination and have roughly the same distance as the Crow flies, but because of the different routes involved, one route is much longer and travels further. From a customer point of view, you're going to the same destination, you don't want to go all over the fucking southside to get there, seems a bit unfair to punish the customer because you want your bus goes the most awkward route possible."
Dublin,3apr71,c0mpliant,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"I just checked the Dublin Bus app and you're right, a stage isn't a stop, altough it's not clear what a stage actually is.  For each route you can see that some stages are just one stop, others are 3. Maybe on a map this has more sense."
Dublin,3apr71,MariusBC,2,Mon Jun 22 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"It's something I've wondered about on and off for years. Like it's crazy, what the fuck is a stage and why isn't any more clearer in their literature..."

UCD's own map is much more helpful. E.g., from SCD: 46a = DunLaoghaire; 145 = Bray; 7* = Sallynoggin etc. The areas that you list are expensive, you have a much broader selection than D4 (ugh) etc."
Dublin,3aljfg,PurpleWomat,2,Sun Jun 21 14:46:46 2015 UTC,Oh christ!!!! I was looking at google for all of the bus routes from different properties. I guess all that research is slightly botched.

It's currently undergoing a process of regeneration and is quite bohemian and vibrant right now, with several festivals and events going on during the year. It's rough too, though, with a few bad neighbourhoods, but you'll find that nearly anywhere outside the leafy enclaves of the very wealthy. D7 is good too, with a similar vibe and strong local community like D8. Both districts are also within walking distance of the city centre, with all the amenities you could want, and generally nights out in your college won't take place in UCD, but in town. The areas nearby to UCD are pricey as hell and pretty boring mostly. Rathmines, Rathgar have some decent bars and restaurants but it's all pretty tame and bourgeois, leafy, lots of overpriced housing, people with SUVs, that kind of thing."

So, what other things — these are the enjoyable things I've done and come as my recommendations, but hopefully others will give you some suggestions or comments on my suggestions.  History  The Little Museum of Dublin is a small museum in a Georgian Building on St. Stephen's Green, which covers much of the history of Dublin in a short amount of time. It's really enjoyable, and you can either do it on your own or do one of the guided tours. Neither will take up a lot of your time. Entry is €7 and the guided tours are on the hour, every hour. http://www.littlemuseum.ie/  Colins Barracks is another museum that covers a lot of the historical elements to Ireland, and is definitely worth checking out. You could easily spend 1–2 days there. It covers the history of Ireland in terms of clothes, furniture, money, and more popularly — the 1916 rising and Irish War of Independence. Entry is free. http://www.museum.ie/en/intro/arts-and-history.aspx  Seeing Dublin  The Dublin Bus Tours which start on Cathal Brugha Street are also really fun, and if you get a good driver doing the live commentary, it can be quite entertaining. Tickets are €22 and available from Dublin Bus Offices on O' Connell Street. There are now 2 routes for this bus, and I definitely recommend the Original/Purple Route for a more historic tour of Dublin. http://www.dublinsightseeing.ie/citytour.aspx  There are also walking tours that take you to places around the city. There are so many of these though and all cover different areas. I can't recommend one specifically as it depends on times that suit.  Places I recommend  There are a lot of places that you may not see as part of any tours, but places that I like for various reasons, mainly that they are just nice, include:  Grand Canal Dock Iveagh Gardens Smithfield Square (This is where Generator Hostel is) Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin Sandymount Beach  Again, there are many other places but these are nice places that I like to go just to relax and be in nice surroundings.  Places to eat  There are so many places to eat, so again these are just places I like.  Irish Food Ann's Bakery on Mary Street on Sunday for what many would call a traditional roast dinner. I love it, although many others would have suggestions for authentic Irish food.  The Hairy Lemon on Stephen Street also do a broad mix of food, but stew is one of the dishes they serve, and that's probably one thing I'd recommend as an Irish meal plus it's a really nice pub too.  ""Irish"" food isn't really as strongly identifiable as Spanish or Italian, so Dublin really offers a wide range of cuisines more so than traditional Irish food.  Burgers  If you like burgers, then there are 2 places I'd recommend. The Counter on Suffolk Street lets you build your own burger with thousands of different combinations of toppings.  There is also Bunsen which has 2 restaurants now. One is on Wexford Street and the other is in Temple Bar. They have 2 options, a hamburger or a cheeseburger. Since they have such a limited menu, they make them really well and they are probably the juiciest of burgers around. Be prepared to wait 20–30 minutes for a table in the evenings. I don't feel the burgers are worth queuing for, but you might like to try it if the opportunity arises.  Mexican Food  There are so many Mexican places. For a more restaurant feel, I recommend Acupolco on George's Street. For more relaxed Mexican Food, try 777 which is opposite Acupolco, or else Mission which is on Liffey Street.  Pizza  There are quite a few nice places for pizza, and many dispute the best, but if you're near any of these, do try to get something from there.  Vincenzo's in Fairview, which is a suburb of Dublin. However, it's right beside the Marino Casino which is an interesting visit, so you could head out there one day and kill 2 birds with the 1 stone. They do some great pizza's with toppings that aren't very common in most pizza places.  Firehouse in Ballymun, which is again a suburb, and there isn't really anything else nearby, but if you are out in the Botanic Gardens, then it is not too far away.  Di Fontaine's on Parliament street is probably the closest place if you are in the city centre, and it is my favourite pizza slice, but there are a lot of similar places to it, this was just one of the earliest places to do late night pizza slices.  Seafood  Seafood is quite popular in Dublin, and there are so many places that claim to be the best.  The most basic which you should try is a traditional ""chip shop"" in Dublin, however this isn't fine dining. They sell fresh cod (in batter) and chips, and this is somewhat of a more renowned ""Irish Meal"" and you should try it while you're here. There are so many chippers/chip shops in Dublin, but most central would be Leo Burdocks on Liffey Street or in Temple Bar.  For proper seafood, there are really so many restaurants. For Chowder, I would recommend either The Winding Stair on Ormond Quay, or else a day trip out to Stoop Your Head in Skerries where they have in my opinion, the best chowder and the best Dublin Bay Prawns in Dublin.  Like I said though, there are so many places for seafood that it's hard to recommend one place.  Chicken Wings  One place in Dublin that is notorious for it's chicken wings is Elephant and Castle, and I think you should try there if you like chicken wings, as they are somewhat of a popular thing in Dublin if you like Chicken Wings.  I think that's enough for food! There are so many places though. There is of course McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, etc., but the above are some of the more popular places around Dublin.  I'll move on to what you probably care most about — night life!  Night Life  Since you mentioned Temple Bar, I will say that you should take a walk down Fleet Street all the way to the end of Temple Bar just to take in the atmosphere, but there really isn't anything special about the pubs in Temple Bar other than being overcrowded and over priced.  Remember, there is a pub called the Temple Bar but this isn't what people are referring to. Temple Bar is the entire area of Fleet Street/Crown Alley, and all the way down to Fishamble Street.  In terms of quiet pubs, less loud places to drink, I would recommend:  Grogans on South William Street The Church Bar on Mary Street Solas on Wexford Street No Name Bar on Fade Street The Hairy Lemon on Stephen Street  These are all based on taste, but they're nice and not too quiet and not too lively.  If you want some more lively places that aren't overly busy but can get full later on weekend nights, then I'd recommend:  Mary' Bar on Wicklow Street Pygmalion on South William Street Grand Social on Liffey Street Cafe en Seine on Dawson Street (nice interior too) The Garage Bar in Temple Bar (small place, good music) Opium on Wexford Street The Grafton Lounge on Royal Hibernian Way (can get quite busy later on) 4 Dame Lane on... Dame Lane The Globe on George's Street Harry's on The Green which is at St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre  There are a lot more, but these are the places I enjoy when I want to meet some friends for a drink, but nothing too crazy or with too many drunk people.  If you then want later clubs etc., there are few, and most are much the same in terms of drinks prices, and the crowd. The most popular places would be:  The Palace on Camden Street Copper Face Jacks on Harcourt Street Black Door on Harcourt Street (supposed to be a minimum age of 27) Everleigh Garden on Harcourt Street D2 on Harcourt Street Howl at the Moon on Mount Street  I could be here forever to go through everything, but this is a list of what I'd recommend. Some others might have comments about the places I've said, and possibly places to avoid, but I hope this gives you some ideas if you are looking for things to fill your time.  If you get stuck while you're here, just PM me and I can help you out. Have fun!"

Dublin,3al5lr,kimmahkat,3,Sun Jun 21 07:41:41 2015 UTC,"Just got back from a weeklong trip there and it was amazing! I would absolutely go back in a heartbeat.  If you want to do a bus tour to check out sights outside of Dublin, Paddywagon Tours was cheap and I liked the guides. You get to see quite a bit, but some stops will be brief. They do pickups in Dublin at three locations and you should choose the earliest pick up to get the best seats. Highly recommend Giants Causeway and Cliffs of Moher.   Skip Temple Bar (as everyone says). The music was crappy, it was way too crowded with students from study abroad, the drinks were expensive, and it was super kitschy. I went because I was with a group that wanted to go. Wasn't worth the time or money.   Couple of pubs I liked were The Brazen Head and The International. Good music at both and really cool people.   Get a SIM card from 3. I bought one off a shop on Grafton Street that gave me unlimited data, talk, and text for 20 Euro. This came in so handy since signage for streets was really hard for me to find.  Some eateries I really enjoyed: The Winding Stair, Fallon and Byrne (basement), Avoca Cafe, Queen of Tarts (went back twice on my trip), and afternoon tea at The Shelbourne. If you like fish and chips, you absolutely need to check out Fish Shop (6 Queen Street, near the old Jameson distillery). Took a Scot and a Brit there who said it was some of the best fish and chips they ever had.  Hope this helps and feel free to PM me if you have any questions about my trip. :)"

Dublin,3adyuk,louiseber,13,Fri Jun 19 10:07:56 2015 UTC,"I cycle to work everyday and I take a very liberal interpretation of the rules. In my experience motorists do to, its just the rules they break aren't as visible and don't always affect other motorists. I break the lights when its safe to do so and when it doesn't slow anyone else down (I take a utilitarian view here).  If you're on a motorbike, get the fuck out of the cycle lane. The yellow box means you can't put your car there. Stop behind the white line, not in the cyclist area. A continuous white line in a cycle lane means you can't cross into it. You don't have right of way because you're driving a car. Indicate early enough that i can get your of your way without slowing down. Don't turn across me. If I'm not using the cycle lane it's because its in bits, there are cars parked in it, it was designed by a retard,  or I'm turning right.  I'm not going to slow you down if I can help it, I expect the same courtesy."

They do not carry the same risk and should not be bound by a system used to govern vehicles which have drastically different risk portfolio.  2. If we want our cities to adapt to alternate vehicles, there must be some measure of disobedience to existing laws. Its called democracy, its how things get changed.  3. Cyclist are more ecologically responsible and should be welcomed and encouraged by being given preferential treatment. Ditto for health benefits.

Many people don't really know that the rules apply to them while they're on a bike, too. Others don't care. Others are aware but choose to selectively break them in order to avoid being around moving motor vehicles. Please don't be any of these people.  Edit: here are the rules in English: http://rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Rules_of_the_road.pdf  The rules for cyclists begin on page 186.

If you thought you weren't going  to fulfil the terms of the lease, which is a legal document you should of put a break clause in it.

Dublin,3a0jdy,GRAPE_FRUIT_EXTRACT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:30:16 2015 UTC,"Same as a car, insurance will depend on your age, driving history, experience and then whatever it is you're driving. I was 17 last lear and got insured for just over a grand on a 125cc Motorbike, If youll want something bigger insurance will be a lot more, especially if you have no experience on bikes before. Tax is cheap, round 70 quid a year for a bike, its insurance that's the killer. Don't forget to factor in the cost of gear to buying a bike. You'll want to budget 3-400 on just a helmet, some sort of protective jacket and some gloves is the minimum. You'll need it. Gets cold during the winter or late at night. Also there's compulsory training for every new rider getting their license called the IBT which can run from 4-500 as well.  I've bought a bike off DoneDeal and also Adverts has a big bike section. Check out some of the local motorcycle dealerships though, prices might be a bit higher for a used bike but at least youll get some sort of warranty (usually) if anything goes wrong.  any more questions feel free to ask"
Dublin,3a0jdy,Luketh12,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I am not Irish, just here for some work from Germany. Fortunately I already got full gear and just need a bike. I suppose I wont have to do the IBT if I already have a license (been riding since 16, so for 7 years now) But I'll double check that."
Dublin,3a0jdy,Luketh12,2,Tue Jun 16 20:52:51 2015 UTC,Ah I assumed you were just starting out. If you already have your European A license you should be fine. Insurance here isn't too bad once they see you have experience. They may not count your driving history on the continent though. A lot of places ask if you have experienced driving in the UK or Republic of Ireland.
Dublin,3a0jdy,definitelynotmattp,2,Wed Jun 17 07:23:14 2015 UTC,I'm 25 and got my licence at 19. I don't have a bike at the moment but I did look at insurance quotes recently and got an estimate of €700ish for annual insurance on a CBR600. If your bike is going to be kept somewhere secure rather than the road you'll pay a good deal less.
Dublin,3a0jdy,unsureguy2015,2,Wed Jun 17 07:49:46 2015 UTC,Ireland no longer allows you to hold 2 licences. People were losing their irish licences to drunk driver and then using their UK licences for driving. Or they were transferring their penalty points to their UK licences.   As a German you can swap your licence for an Irish licence. But there is little benefit.   May suggestion is pick a random bike online and start phoning insurance companies for a estimate for insurance
Dublin,3a0jdy,Mistawez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"Insurance = ~€350-€2500 (depends on size/category, supersports are very pricey)  Tax = ~€80  IBT = ~€500  Gear = €300-€400 (you can spend crazy money, mine was ~€150 on helmet, ~€100 on a jacket+trousers, €25 for gloves and about €50 for some boots I rarely wear).  I personally got tired of sweaty gear and just bought used summer gear on Adverts and wear a jacket over it when I need it.  I also picked up gloves without lining (just leather) and my hands don't stink every time I wear them now. Also much easier to get on/off.  I think there's a point with helmets where you're just paying for comfort. I also think it's better to change them more frequently, whereas @ €400 I'd be more reluctant. I'm not going to say you're a fool for protecting your noggin though!"

So if you get there at 6 or so you'll probably get away with staying there a bit later, but you most likely wouldn't be allowed in at 7/8 when the security guys start checking IDs at the door.  EDIT they can however stay if they're eating a meal (not just bar snacks!) so if you go for a late dinner you'll probably be okay."

A flat, a separate bedroomed place in say a converted Georgian house probably sub 1000 and a studio/ bed sit with no separate bedroom sub 900. But also bear in mind DL, like Bray has always held a high price because of the  Dart line.

Dublin,39knpv,PurpleWomat,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"Let's clarify the terms first, for the sake of simplicity:    Studio: One or two rooms -bedroom/living space/kitchen all in one room. Sometimes a separate private bathroom, sometimes a shared bathroom with other studios.  One bedroom flat - three more rooms - at the very least a bedroom, a private bathroom and a kitchen/living room.    Lets also clarify Dunlaoghaire - There's the area marked Dunlaoghaire on most maps, but then there's a much larger area where some places are addressed as Dunlaoghaire, but you might not really think of as being so.   Where specifically are you looking to live?    Bigger red area?   As little as 550 for a tiny studio with poor transport links. as little as 700 for a studio. Really not much selection for these types of properties in this area though. Mostly family homes.  little red area?   Pretty much town center. Much higher property values. ~700+ for a studio i'd say. 800-900 is about as little as you'll pay a month for a one bed. Slightly more selection as it's slightly more built up. Prices are higher because anywhere'll have brilliant transport links and a good locaiton.    These are just very rough numbers, but they're what I'm working with after looking in the area for quite a while."

Dublin,398vse,Alprevolution,2,Wed Jun 10 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"Go on a pub crawl. You will meet loads of new people that way. A musical pub crawl, a literary pub crawl or the backpacker pub crawl. There's loads of others too.   Ireland are playing Scotland in a big international football game on Saturday afternoon. Go mingle with the crowds around the stadium. Pubs will be packed."
Dublin,398vse,VOTEMARINE,4,Wed Jun 10 05:57:27 2015 UTC,"Don't hang out with these twats. They'll find some way to feul their weak egos having a piss on you. My advice is to take yourself on a pub crawl. Pick an inviting bar, have a pint or two and if you dont make any friends there get a water and head to the next. Its better to be spontaneous and see how the night plays out for you. Don't carry a lot of cash at one time, keep your wits about you and stay on your guard. Dublin can be a lot like NYC, fun if you run into the right people, dangerous if you don't. Only in the sticks or somewhere like Galway will you be more likely to find more friendly people."

Dublin,391fty,infected_2,4,Mon Jun 8 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, if a store is offering to charge you in sterling, you're probably getting ripped off.  Shops often do this hoping people will think they're avoiding bank fees, but the shops give you a really shit rate."

But I know what you mean about the home currency thing, I'd be losing out if it was my own money, but luckily I can expense my meals and hotel so getting them charged in sterling wherever possible helps because I won't have to take watever exchange rate my work reimburses me with for the Euro purchases.  But I need euro cash as back up cos a lot of the restaurants don't do it.    More hassle than it should be I know but I'm just trying to avoid myself losing out in the longrun."

Dublin,38x3dl,dazziola,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:17:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. There's no streaming involved. I just periodically fetch some HTML from the TXFM website and parse the info. Not so fancy, I know.  What is interesting, however, is how I store the data. It first goes into a Redis in-MemoryDB where the last 50 songs are stored. All the others are stored in a MongoDB on the FileSystem.  You might notice that when you search something, some songs are loaded instantly and the rest follows after a few seconds. This is because they have to be loaded from the slow FileSystem. I wouldn't say it's expensive in terms storage space, though.  The source code is on github: Server Side, Client Side"

Dublin,38l7re,legitwantdis,2,Fri Jun 5 09:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah then it sounds like the guy was a junkie.  The main Dublin Fire Brigade station is just around the corner on Tara St., and as /u/moononastick1 said, there is a rib boat at the ready a few hundred meters for exactly these instances.  It's hard to speculate on why it's so common for junkies to do it, suicide is perhaps one of them, if not the irrational thinking under the influence of heroin and a lot of other drugs.  Suicide is a common thing though for a lot of the jumps into the river. My cousin being one of them as he suffers with Bipolar Disorder — but thankfully the Dublin Fire Brigade reacted quick enough to save him.  I hope seeing that hasn't put you off Dublin too much. Heroin addiction is somewhat of a problem in Dublin compared to many other countries, but there are also a lot of nice things about Dublin, especially when every city has it's own unique problems."
Dublin,38l7re,moononastick1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:30:12 2015 UTC,"Awk nah, I remember the junkie issue even from my childhood visits to dublin.  The junkies tend not to bother me, it happens in big cities and i've never had a bad experience with them really other than the odd baffled conversation or begging. Earlier in the day a guy had approached me from behind asking me for help to get rid of the guy with him, he was alone...   Not much I could do other that ask if everything is okay and does he actually need help but he could barely string a sentence together so I walked off. More of an inconvenience than anything, although it's still pretty grim to see people in that condition."

I've lived in Bray for two years now and that seems to be the general consensus with everyone I've spoken too.  Anywhere along the killarney Road, Herbert Road, Sidmonton Road and the Meath Road would be good. Rents tend to get more expensive closer to the DART line, rent would probably be cheaper than Greystones but I haven't checked in a while. I'd guess it would be about 400 a month on average to rent a room. Avoid the sea front it can be very noisy.  My main problem when moving here was trying to find a house share with only one or two people. Most of the places I viewed had three to four people already living in the house and most of them weren't great.   Bray like any other town has its fair share of problems but I haven't experienced anything negative since I moved here. The town doesn't have much to offer in terms of shops but there are some nice restaurants around and it is pretty easy get in and out of Dublin from here via bus and DART.

Dublin,38a3ll,Khaleesee,8,Tue Jun 2 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"There has literally been no serious development of housing in Dublin for the last 7/8 years. There wasnt even a huge amount built in Dublin previously to that, compared to most of Ireland. But Dublins population has been growing strongly due to the fact, Dublin attracts a majority of FDI, english language students and migration within Ireland(people moving from the West of Ireland, where jobs are scarcer to the greater opportunities in Dublin).   Daft is literally your best option. Its where nearly all property is advertised in Ireland"
Dublin,38a3ll,unsureguy2015,4,Tue Jun 2 21:48:51 2015 UTC,It WAS a bank holiday weekend. I know a few agents and they took off all weekend.  That means there is a backlog.

Dublin,38a3ll,ah_ha,2,Wed Jun 3 07:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you've already seen the advice to go to Daft. However I do think the way Dublin's market is you need to consider where you're going to stay in three days. If you can't extend your current location, airbnb is a good option. Also, there's 'guest houses' and short-term lets (check Let.ie for these) that you can consider. Ranelagh Park House near the city centre is currently giving double bedrooms for €1k a month, which is a good option for something to tide you over and I don't expect you're going to find a place cheaper than €1k a month anyway."
Dublin,38a3ll,neonic75,3,Wed Jun 3 08:50:55 2015 UTC,"Moved back to Dublin after a couple of years away and I feel your pain. Demand is HUGE, for a lot of reason but it boils down to less houses than people.  Daft.ie is going to be your friend, but you need to constantly monitor it. Set up email alerts and also watch for new houses in areas you might like. Try be the first to call the letting agent and at least soon after the ad goes up, in my experience it makes a big difference. Look at outside Dublin if needs must. The commuter belt is huge, you could look at Naas, Kildare, Bray, Louth, Wicklow.... Hell even Thurles is on the commuter train line these days. Living in a town outside the city will save you considerable money.  If you dont have a car, look at the where commuter trains travel and start looking in those towns too.  If you really only have 3 days left before you have to pick up sticks and live on the street then time to make some decisions quickly."
Dublin,38a3ll,robin9585,3,Wed Jun 3 08:00:19 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation recently. You have to just keep calling, viewing places, etc. Unfortunately, because there is such high demand, property agents can get away with acting like assholes.  One consolation is that once you find a place, landlords are eager to get everything signed and move you in quickly."
Dublin,38a3ll,brrrilliant,3,Wed Jun 3 08:42:10 2015 UTC,"In addition to what people have said here, take copies of references to viewings and have the deposit available to hand over within a couple of hours of viewing. Time is not your friend here."

In my case it was to Australia from Ireland. In my experience in Ireland, if I was under the same pressure I'd be looking outside the city and high-demand areas. You might have better luck looking in northern Wicklow or eastern Kildare, or anywhere outside the m50 area, and commuting into the city for work. I know it's a pain in the ass but it doesn't have to be permanently. When you're set up you'll have time to focus on finding a more suitable home in a better location. Also, out there the rents will be a bit cheaper.   Good luck, btw, and let me know how you get on."

Dublin,38a3ll,helion12,4,Wed Jun 3 02:53:32 2015 UTC,The whole world most certainly does not have similar ideals.  This is the exact reason why we have immigration law and a visa process in almost every country. Not only do immigrants diversify a culture but they also bring skills and numbers to a workforce that is otherwise not available.  Everyone accepts the fact that people like to move and travel and bring skills and knowledge to a particular place that would be otherwise lacking.  There is a huge need at the moment for immigrant workers to fill a numbers a jobs in different sectors because Irish short-sightedness means we just don't have the knowledge to fill these roles.  Looking at the tech sector as a prime example (and also its what I have experience with) we just dont have enough people to fill the amount of jobs that require 4-5 years experience. These people just dont exist in the numbers required to fill the roles available.  Without looking at immigrants for the tech giants we are trying to desperately to attract we have no workforce to supply them with.  /u/webby_mc_webberson was wrong to call you a racist. You are a racist and an idiot.
Dublin,38a3ll,neonic75,-1,Wed Jun 3 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"Chinese immigrants to take one example come to Ireland to work. They apply to visa farms pretending to be English schools and pretend to be learning English. Then they work every hour of the day saving as much money as they can so they can go back to China where they will be able to buy a house with their savings after approximately five years. They have told me this themselves. I have worked and become friends with them. They live in cramped shit-hole aparments.  This affects both the job and the housing market. A landlord is able to pack his hovel for large money because the Chinese are willing to pack themselves into them. They do not care about their standard of living. It is a tempory hard-ship for them. Likewise the job they do. They do not mind working Saturday night and Sunday morning.  Meanwhile the native Irish has to lower their standard of living and working to compete. Except for them, they do not get to pay off a mortgage on a nice home after five years of toil.   If you cannot understand this, I do not know what to tell you.  I will leave you with once more fact. Nearly 50% of the people on the housing list in North Dublin are non-Irish born."
Dublin,38a3ll,helion12,2,Wed Jun 3 03:00:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your argument if I'm honest.  I cant honestly believe that Chinese immigrants are clogging up the housing sector in Dublin but if you have a sources to show me otherwise please provide them.  Also people generally travel and migrate all over the world, from all over the world.  I couldn't count the number of people I know who left Ireland (including myself for a couple of years) with no fixed deadline for returning to earn some money and see a bit of the world.  Is your argument against the Chinese in particular? Because this is common practise from almost every western country in the world."
Dublin,38a3ll,neonic75,0,Wed Jun 3 03:04:36 2015 UTC,It's one aspect of the immigration system which is clogging up the housing sector and making working harder. I don't see why you can't understand that. I don't blame the Chinese. The government actually like this system because they are in the game of inflating property prices. It is their biggest cash cow. They work against your interests. They want you to spend the largest chunk of your wage on housing.

Wander through The Powerscourt Centre. It's a Georgian courtyard turned into a nice little shopping centre. Afterwards walk through George's Arcade for some random crap. Get frozen yogurt.  Someone else mentioned it but the walk from Killiney to Dalkey DART station is really nice on a clear day. You can get a map off the nice Dutch woman in the shop at Killiney then have a meal/beers when you get to Dalkey.   Another nature-related one but walking up Bray Head can be fun and there's a nice view from the top.  Get a burger in Bunsen. Fucking delicious.  Have a beer aboard the Cill Airne. It's a boat down in the IFSC. Bring a jacket if you're planning to sit on the deck.  Do one of those ""escape from the room"" things. I forget the name of the place but a Google search should find it.  Have a quiet beer in the Library Bar in the Central Hotel.  Try some Irish craft beer in one of the various craft beer places around town.  Go to a musical in the Bord Gais Theatre or a play in one of the more traditional theatres.  EDIT: I also hear good things about the Glasnevin Cemetery tour if you're interested in Irish history. And I heard this from people that wouldn't normally even be interested in something like that."

There is an abundance of great museums and art galleries, all reachable by foot or public transport, so check out some of the places like the Chester Beatty Library, IMMA or the Natural History Museum.  If I were showing friends around for the weekend without a car, I'd take a DART and then do walks around Howth Head, Killiney Hill or the cliff walk from Bray to Greystones. All three are great walks and you'll see fantastic views of the coastline, if the weather is right.  You can hire bikes at the entrance to the Phoenix Park and wander the park, maybe take a picnic.   The number 44 bus will talk to you Enniskerry where you can walk to Powerscourt, one of the most beautiful formal gardens in Ireland.   The Dublin Free Event Guide comes out every Friday, it'll tell you about all of the local markets happening over the weekend.   Edit: personally I like the food market in the people's park in DunLaoghaire that's on most Sundays. It's reachable by DART, and afterwards you can have a long walk down the pier while scoffing an ice cream from Teddy's which is a Dublin institution!"

They most likely won't be able to process it all for people (or don't want to cover the cost).  The majority of stuff that's valuable will have been lifted by the litter pickers and security staff (been there) and then sometimes they let recycling co.s come and sift the rest. Give the station a bell and see if they have any info, they should be aware of a big pile of crap landing on their doorstep.  Hopefully you've not lost anything too important cos your chances are slim of finding unless some kind soul has found it and taken upon themselves to reunite you."
Dublin,3884sv,infected_2,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:32:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response. Sobering read! I lost my phone at it and it sounds like either a security guard or a fellow festival goer most certinanly has it..! My only hope is that there were better looking iphones than my one with its nice big crack on the back and was somehow shifted to the police station.
Dublin,3884sv,bhob86,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:19:28 2015 UTC,It more depends on the person the finds the items. Judging by the crowd there at the weekend your chances of getting anything back are at about 5% whereas Knockanstockanhas has a much nicer clientèle. Anytime i find items at festivals i try my best to get them back to their owners. Handing them in at the festival sometimes isn't the best idea as the organisers rarely give a shit about that kinda stuff
Dublin,3884sv,BlueGhosties,0,Tue Jun 2 21:36:51 2015 UTC,Can't comment on FF's lost and found system but Knockanstockan have a great lost and found thing set up. I know a few people who have lost phones and other things only to get them back by going to Whelans the week after the festival!
Dublin,385tqp,kafrofrite,6,Tue Jun 2 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"St Patrick's is in Dublin 8, so fire up daft.ie and search by area, start with Dublin 8 and have a look at the prices and work your way out from there. D8 is the 'up & coming' neighbourhood so prices are a bit high but you might find something to suit. Don't discount looking at sharing, might help you get settled. But, you won't be able to secure anything before you're here in Dublin, any pay before you view leases are probably scams unless done through those expensive short term business accom agencies."

Dublin,3813mh,idunnowatimdoing,15,Mon Jun 1 02:07:40 2015 UTC,"Most Irish dress in layers as it's quite possible to have rain, full sun, hail, slush, and a freezing wind that sneaks up your trouser leg and depilates your vag all within the space of an hour. Buy a sturdy, purse sized umbrella after you arrive and keep it with you at all times. And comfy, waterproof shoes as you'll be doing a lot of walking in Dublin."
Dublin,3813mh,PurpleWomat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:10:41 2015 UTC,"Is there a certain type of umbrella you recommend? I don't know how windy it gets that and I don't want to bring something flimsy if it's just going to fall apart!  Also, if I got shoes that weren't originally waterproof but sprayed them with waterproofing spray would that do any good or should I just go ahead and invest in rain boots? ..or both?"
Dublin,3813mh,PurpleWomat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bother with rain boots (I assume that you mean wellies?). I usually wear leather shoes/boots or a pair of easily dried heavy trainers.  Yeah, some days it's too windy to use an umbrella so a jacket with a hood is useful, but the thing about Ireland is that it can be pleasantly sunny then rain so hard that you start getting primitive ark building urges...then go right back to being sunny. It's very changeable. So you really need an umbrella that's easy to throw in your bag and forget about. Those big, heavy sports umbrellas are too awkward on city streets anyway.   I have an umbrella in my bag all year around (this is quite funny in mid July when it suddenly starts pissing rain out of blue skies and all the Irish just wisk out an umbrella whilst the Americans stand around looking confused). E.g., from elsewhere on this sub, Dublin today."

Dublin,3813mh,moononastick1,6,Mon Jun 1 02:44:10 2015 UTC,"Dublin's a bit dryer than most of Ireland, but all the same, an umbrella won't go amiss.   It's humid, which makes it feel colder than it is, but nothing a Minnesotan can't handle.   Our winters are also a little bit darker than - we're just that bit further north."
Dublin,3813mh,kiaara,3,Mon Jun 1 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"September is usually decent enough by Irish standards (anywhere from 10-18C) and a warm coat, scarf, hat and gloves will do you from mid October til December. We get a bit of frost on winter mornings, but rarely much snow, and the very coldest it'll get would be around -1."

Dublin,3813mh,JordashOran,2,Mon Jun 1 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'm also a 21 y/o woman studying in Dublin. As everyone has said before, September is quite nice/average, but October can get very cold very quickly, and then begins our six month long winter! If I were you, I'd start out with a decent leather jacket or something similar to stay warm during the mild/verging on chilly weather. Maybe adding in a scarf once it gets colder. Then you're going to need a winter coat. Nothing serious - in Minnesota I'm sure you need a proper, sportswear, insulated ski coat - while in Dublin you'll probably just need something like this. Warm, practical, but not made for arctic temperatures.   Typically, Irish students will just wear skinny jeans, runners(sneakers) / boots like these, and some sort of jumper, depending on the weather. (Obviously you can wear whatever you want, just giving you a general overview). You'll also probably want a decent sized handbag, being a student, but also because Irish weather requires things like emergency umbrellas etc.   Also, be warned, it starts to gets dark at about 4pm during the depths of winter. So, be prepared for very little daylight!"

I'm working there atm, i've been bringing a thin hoody which i've always got on to stay warm and then a really thin waterproof in the bag to throw on for showers. Decent shoes/boots. Puddles everywhere and you'l walk plenty.  But it's really not that bad. Our weather is pretty mild by comparison to other places.

Dublin,3813mh,Herb_Tokeston,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"A hell of a lot of codology going on about rainfall, like you're going to need a snorkel and wetsuit. You'll find Dublin to be just about as wet as Minnesota (although it's wet wet, not snow wet). Dublin gets 28.85 inches of rain a year, and Minnesota get between 18 inches in the NW to 32 in the SE. So my advice on that one is pack your usual rain gear.   Ireland is a country of 4 seasons in a day, so you'll probably want to lot. We have had a few very cold winters in the past decade (nothing on Minnesota scale, but pretty cold, ~ -10°C). The difference is Ireland is not ready to deal with that kind of thing, The country grinds to a halt, so I would be sure to bring ice grips for your boots if you have them (they sell out as soon as the bad weather comes). When there is a big Freeze the paths aren't cleared like they are in Minnesota and become treacherous and the number of admissions to A&E for broken wrists and bones goes through the roof.  In general though, Ireland has a temperate climate. We benefit from the Gulf Stream bringing warm water  from Mexico so it never gets too cold for too long. That said, you prob want to leave the bulkiest of your winter wear behind you, but do bring a warm jacket as we are quite far North and there can be a few cold days in December.  This all said, Irish people are laughed at by our continental cousins as we have a habit of dressing totally inappropriately for the weather of the day.   Of course, if you do ever find yourself caught in a rain shower with all the wrong gear, there's probably a lovely pub with a big turf fire and a nice pint waiting just a short walk away."

When leaving if you don't want to wait for hours for a bus head to the pick up point before the encore. Ignore the queue and just every man for himself. Good luck.

Dublin,37jhqh,kushmoney929,16,Thu May 28 02:02:30 2015 UTC,"Hostel: Avalon House where you will be able to get some of the best coffee in Dublin the next day.  Things to do: You'll be right by Stephens green shopping centre and park, which are on one end of Grafton street, at the other end is Trinity college, go in have a look but be warned its €10 to see one page of the book of kells so not worth it in my opinion. I suggest the natural history museum instead where you can see even more interesting historical items for free. Then Viking Splash tour! Its so much fun. You dress up with a Viking hat, roar at unsuspecting people and learn about dublins history all from a motherfucking ex-military amphibious truck! If you're here for a day you won't be able to do anything outside the city realistically. If you like whiskey, beside trinity is a whiskey museum and then on the other side of the Liffey is the Jameson distillery tour. You could also go to the Guinness factory if you're so inclined.  Going out: Depends what you like, loads of people go to Coppers from all over the country and its near the Hostel I suggested. Its also the easiest place in Ireland to get the face gobbed off you, as long as you're not a giant bag of shite. If you want gay clubbing The George or Panti Bar. I prefer O'Reillys pub myself by Tara street dart station, but it depends on how much you are willing to walk.  Also you can walk everywhere in Dublin city centre. Its a small enough city, but it's deceivingly tiring so don't carry too much around with you, and obviously be careful with your possessions. If you have a hankering for fish and chips Leo burdocks or beshoffs. You can get decent food for decent prices too but it depends on what you want.  Good luck anyway and enjoy Dublin!"

You need to move into the right lane early by sticking your hand out so the driver doesn't try overtake you. Then just move out and don't feel awkward about being out in the middle of the road - it's what you're meant to do. I normally try stay on the left side of the right lane if that makes sense, that way traffic in the lane can still overtake you.  I find you need to just be assertive sometimes otherwise drivers won't give you any respect. Don't be afraid to move into the lanes you need to be in - just indicate to let the drivers know what you're doing. It'll get easier as you get to know the routes you're taking."

People in cars, especially taxis, will beep at you, don't let it unnerve you. Turning right just takes a bit of confidence, you're entitled to cross lanes, just signal clearly and early. Bus lanes can be tricky, bus drivers don't like sharing. Don't assume they're going to follow the rules of the road, protect yourself first.   There are lots of great cycle lanes in the city but sometimes they can just disappear inexplicably.

Then after shit has been fully pondered catch your Dart back into town, have a bite to eat before grabbing a few warm up pints and heading to the aforementioned Coppers. Safe in the knowledge that whatever bizarre shit happens during the night of insanity in that wretched hive of scum, villainy and culchie nurses you will have had fresh air in your lungs, a beautiful landscape and ample time during the day to find peace in this world before it gets cruelly stripped away along with your underpants by Naimh from Nenagh."

Dublin,37dz7z,queev,3,Wed May 27 06:16:45 2015 UTC,I understood about half of this.. However I am excited to check out all those places you just mentioned!  I have seen some pretty ratchet clubs here since I used to live in a college town so hopefully it prepared me for Coppers haha.  And I just looked up what culchie meant and there will be nurses at this club that are from the countryside?  So redneck nurses....  This shall be interesting!  I am jotting down all this and Ill hope that after a night at Coppers Naimh from Nenagh wont take my underpants xD

Dublin,37dz7z,remix6464,2,Wed May 27 07:11:13 2015 UTC,I can only think of two reasons.   A - They're trying to be funny  and   B - They genuinely have zero taste.

Dublin,37dz7z,tastyprivilege,1 point,Wed May 27 04:20:28 2015 UTC,Oh quick question. Is Dublin relatively safe to walk around in? Any places that I should avoid?
Dublin,37dz7z,jmarsica86,2,Wed May 27 04:25:20 2015 UTC,most places are fine. Just ask someone on here before you book your accommodation. If you're really drunk and really loud and really unlucky someone might rob you but you're not gonna get stabbed or shot.
Dublin,37dz7z,ireland123,1 point,Wed May 27 07:42:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say so. I walked around pretty much all of Dublin at every hour of the day/night and never had any issues. Watch out for groups of like 10-12 year olds though, they're kind of scary."
Dublin,37dz7z,that-there,0,Wed May 27 04:29:20 2015 UTC,"Get there early and get drunk before the crowds turn up. Went went last thurs and the queue to get in and for the bar was horrendous.  And be prepared for bouncers pushing you every other minute because your standing in the wrong spot. Literally, we were shoved aside whilst queuing because we were doing it wrong. Whilst in the queue for the bar, having been in the exact same spot for 10 mins the bouncer decides I need to be 2 inches to the left and starts shoving me. Any time you stand still for a drink you'll be in the wrong place and shoved a couple inches in a different direction.  I mean it's a dodgy enough crowd and the bouncers must have a short fuse as a result but never have I been pushed around so much by bouncers even before I could get my first drink into me. Actually, just go somewhere else unless your looking a really packed club."

Dublin,37bap9,unsureguy2015,2,Tue May 26 18:16:25 2015 UTC,I use them all the time. The area is pretty hood. But there is always parking outside the door (no one really parks their Iong term). The fish is pretty cheap and super fresh
Dublin,37bap9,PurpleWomat,3,Tue May 26 17:59:49 2015 UTC,Someone asked a similar question on Boards and there were some good answers. My personal preferences are Howth and the coal pier in Dun Laoghaire but those might be too far if you are on crutches.

Dublin,377z5y,charlesgillanders,3,Mon May 25 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"Shops, food, and bars wise I'd go for Portabello/Dublin 8 area"
Dublin,377z5y,doctor6,2,Mon May 25 19:21:38 2015 UTC,"For 2k you get get lucky near the harbour. There are some amazing apartments with great views and it is close to the city but still quiet enough. Or just across the liffey in the ifsc.  Also quite nice. However, I think ranelagh is probably closer to East London. Cheaper though. Still a great place to live."
Dublin,377z5y,BottledUp,3,Mon May 25 17:51:31 2015 UTC,Harbour? Do you mean Dublin harbour as that's not the nicest place to live considering the guy's budgeted 2k PM
Dublin,377z5y,doctor6,2,Mon May 25 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Harbour = Dublin Docklands. Similar to London Docklands vibe. More suburban but still central = Sandymount, Beggers Bush, Ranelagh type places. Gonna cost dollaz though."
Dublin,377z5y,InOutInOutShakeAbout,1 point,Mon May 25 18:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry. That is what I meant. Docklands."
Dublin,377z5y,BottledUp,1 point,Mon May 25 18:58:35 2015 UTC,That area ain't referred to as 'the harbour'

Dublin,377z5y,InOutInOutShakeAbout,2,Mon May 25 19:07:44 2015 UTC,North side Docklands are a bit sterile. South Docklands more residential. Bath Avenue is a decent mix of city-suburb but very expensive.
Dublin,377z5y,kitten_on_smack,2,Mon May 25 20:46:18 2015 UTC,D8 for the most similar vibe to East London I think (although still quite different).
Dublin,377z5y,Versk,1 point,Mon May 25 18:39:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I think d8 might be a good shout
Dublin,377z5y,mcwhogirl,1 point,Mon May 25 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Just be aware that Some parts of D8 are really rough. Like you have one of the nicest areas in Dublin (Portobello) literally right next to one of the worst (Dolphin's Barn).  I'd Personally look for a place in the area between Lwr Leeson Street and Lwr Mount Street.  Unlike London, you can actually live in the city centre in Dublin without being an oligarch."
Dublin,377z5y,libfree,1 point,Tue May 26 09:16:26 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the tips. it does seem a lot like london, you can walk from amazing 6 bed mansions to tower blocks in 5 mins."
Dublin,377z5y,Carpe_Noche,1 point,Tue May 26 09:29:25 2015 UTC,"South side of Dublin city, definitely. A good tip for searching on daft- even postal numbers are south, odd numbers are north. There's great areas like Rathmines, D6, D8. Also, keep in mind ads on daft frequently embellish quality, and sometimes even amenities. Ask how recent the pictures are, and look up reviews for the letting agency. Landlords are getting ridiculous with pricing and quality."
Dublin,377p8a,da_crust_keoza,3,Mon May 25 15:44:59 2015 UTC,They used to sell it in bottles in Swords but I haven't seen it around in a long while.
Dublin,377p8a,jjtreanor,1 point,Mon May 25 15:58:29 2015 UTC,Yeah. It was definitely everywhere about 15 years ago.

Dublin,377p8a,thedeclineirl,2,Mon May 25 17:09:18 2015 UTC,I'v no clue about the city centre but The Blackrock Cellar in Blackrock usually stock it. They also have a fantastic selection of other beer as well if they don't happen to have it. Maybe somewhere like Redmonds of Ranelagh would have it.
Dublin,377p8a,niall7171,2,Mon May 25 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"If it's not in the Blackrock Cellar then i doubt its anywhere in Dublin, talk to the boss there he's very knowledgeable"

Dublin,374t6p,irieriley,9,Sun May 24 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"The cliffs are not near Dublin at all and are the other side of the country (Galway side). It is nice if the weather is good but there are also plenty of other things to do and see which won't have you missing out.   In short, if your that side of the country on a nice day, then by all means they are good to see!"
Dublin,374t6p,somethingawsome,2,Sun May 24 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm aware how far it is, that's why it's such a hard decision for me! Maybe I will see the cliffs on my next trip. Hopefully it isn't too far down the road!"
Dublin,374t6p,FRONTBUM,5,Sun May 24 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"Approx. 3 hours drive each way to the cliffs from Dublin. Could be 4+ if there's traffic in the city or the road to Lahinch.  If you want to go, this company does a day tour from Dublin, but you'd be stuck looking at boring motorway and countryside out the window of a bus for most of the day.  I'd save the cliffs for another trip, and spend a few days in the west of Ireland. A day trip is a bit daft."
Dublin,374t6p,MarioSpeedwagon13,3,Mon May 25 01:46:50 2015 UTC,"Yes - but check the weather before you go, it can be foggy."
Dublin,374t6p,Saoi_,1 point,Sun May 24 21:53:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been hearing, does the weather change really fast or will you have a pretty good idea in the morning? Obviously with such a short time in the city I don't want one day to be a waste haha."
Dublin,374t6p,bowets,3,Sun May 24 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"Well ""Four seasons in one day"" or ""if you don't like the weather wait 20 minutes"" are popular sayings."
Dublin,374t6p,tigerav,3,Mon May 25 12:41:13 2015 UTC,There are enough things to do in Dublin to fill those 4 days. Here are a few: Wicklow national park Dun Laoghire or howth Bray to greystones walk along the coast Dublinia Guinness storehouse Jameson distillery Leprechaun museum Ghost bus tour New grange is a day tour close to Dublin Trim castle is close as well and it's the site where they filmed braveheart.  Belfast is close and you could see the titanic museum and the black cab tour in one day Back in Dublin there's Dublin castle The botanical gardens and the glasnevin cemetery  Marion square and the statue of Oscar Wilde  Phoenix park and the zoo are a nice place to see.  There are many more so your 4 days here will be filled. On your next trip focus on the west.
Dublin,374t6p,TimeToWander,2,Mon May 25 09:23:26 2015 UTC,You could visit Galway and go to the cliffs from there. You'll probably run out of things to do if you stay in Dublin for 4 days.

Dublin,374t6p,webby_mc_webberson,1 point,Mon May 25 03:35:52 2015 UTC,You'd run out of things to do after four days?
Dublin,374t6p,Saoi_,2,Mon May 25 12:46:59 2015 UTC,"I took a day tour to the cliffs and while it was enjoyable, the weather was crazy (winds will push you around daily) and I was on a bus for 10 hours. It's only a three hour drive so if I had a rented a car I would have had a better time, instead of stopping every 45 minutes on the bus.   It really depends on how much you want to see them and whether you're willing to spend the time to get to them. They were great to see, but I probably won't go see them again unless I go by car."
Dublin,374t6p,CaptainEarlobe,4,Mon May 25 16:29:59 2015 UTC,If you go to Ireland to stay in Dublin then you haven't seen Ireland.

Dublin,3753ar,iamadinosaur,3,Sun May 24 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"Daft is likely to be the place you'll find the best selection of rentals.  Dublin is insane for rent at the minute. You more than likely won't be able book anywhere in advance. You'll need to turn up to viewings with deposit, first month rent and work and previous landlord references.   Anywhere Southside will do you for location. Otherwise just get near a dart station for the fella in Blackrock. Ranalagh, rathmines and the like are popular for renters."
Dublin,3753ar,late-parrot,1 point,Mon May 25 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yea looking on daft and have been trying to set up viewings. It's been difficult as we only have our last exam tomorrow and a lot of renters are unwilling to rent to students even though we're working.  Looks like we might have just set up a viewing for tomorrow evening, the estate agent is just checking if it's ok for us (students but working). Rent is €700 though."
Dublin,3753ar,late-parrot,2,Mon May 25 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"Rent is €700 though.   Welcome to Dublin 2015! It's a pain in the ads, but that's the reality. It's a landlords market, so they can be choosey.  You should have some chance in student houses, seeing as you'll be filling the gap while they're gone for the 3 months."

Dublin,36z649,tie_suit,1 point,Sat May 23 10:39:06 2015 UTC,"I have no connection with either college.   The DIT courses look reasonably interesting to me. There's a lot of overlap between them. DCU have an industrial placement, which I don't see in the DIT courses. Otherwise the courses are similar. DCU has a bit more maths and computing, as you'd expect from a course with significantly higher points.   Overall, if you've the academic credentials to get in, the DCU course looks a bit better, but if you'd struggle there, DIT's course looks fine."

Dublin,36r3k8,louiseber,1 point,Thu May 21 14:08:24 2015 UTC,There was a thread from 2 days ago with all the comedy bars. Link

Dublin,36r3k8,clammind,1 point,Fri May 22 08:35:02 2015 UTC,International might be a bit small if there are 15 in the group and you could end up with people not getting in. Maybe the laughter lounge on the quays might be better for such a large group. I think you can reserve places.
Dublin,36r3k8,mynameipaul,1 point,Thu May 21 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"Ah no, it's not a huge room, but I've never seen the international so full that you couldn't accommodate a couple dozen more people showing up. They're very likely to not get seats and end up standing a the back, but I don't think they'll be refused at the door - not least because gigs in the international are never that well moderated to begin with."
Dublin,36r3k8,clammind,1 point,Fri May 22 06:53:57 2015 UTC,I do prefer the international over the laughter lounge. Better atmosphere and better value. I can't say for a fact anyone will be refused  i'm usually standing beside the door with a pint to make sure i get a seat. But if I had a large group and wasn't paying for it I'd probably book laughter lounge for less stress

Dublin,36q0ov,Salparthas,1 point,Fri May 22 10:48:12 2015 UTC,"It's just because it's expensive. Honestly, unless you're going to have 20 pints it makes no difference at all"
Dublin,36q0ov,legitwantdis,9,Thu May 21 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"OK, so there's a lot of negativity here and some of it slightly unbalanced. Just to give you a perspective from a ""local"" point of view, people who live in Dublin generally wouldn't drink in / socialise in temple bar because it's very touristy and EXTREMELY expensive, but having said that, if you are visiting, it is a pretty cool place if you're willing to pay above the odds - most people around will be like minded and sociable, just don't expect to find too many Irish people, but a lot of the bars do excellent live traditional music and it is definitely a party hub of the city.  Also, in terms of location it's right smack bang in the middle of everything, so all of Dublin city centre is within walking distance.  If you want to go to more authentic Irish pubs, I'd suggest you cross the street from temple bar on the other side of Dame Street (where the central bank is - ask anyone, they'll direct you). There are some really good bars like the Stags Head in Dame Lane (a small alley on Dame Street), or along Georges Street there are several good places. Just to note, the bar called ""The George"" on Georges Street is a gay bar, so if you're gay, that's your spot, if you're not, then just thought I'd give you a heads up as if you're looking for a bit of action, you may well be barking up the wrong tree in there.  Places along there I'd recommend are Hogans or The Globe, but there are lots of side streets to explore with cool bars too (as there are further up in temple bar and along the quays). Trust me, you will be spoiled for choice with night life.   In terms of day time things to do, you're a short stroll from Trinity University - there's an attraction to see the the book of Kells, I'm not much of a culture vulture, so it's kind of wasted on me, but it's worth the trip to see the nice campus and if you take the tour, to see the library - especially if you're a Harry Potter fan! :p  You could also take the Viking Splash tour which is suprisingly fun, it leaves from St. Stephens Green Park pic 1 pic 2 pic 3, which is a nice spot to have lunch if the weather permits - also around that area are plenty of nice shops if you are interested in doing some shopping, and a shopping centre / mall right beside the park.  If you're in the mood for day trips, you can take the DART out to some of the nice suburbs of the city, which have beautiful hiking and sight seeing, and almost a taste of rural Ireland from right within the city, such as Howth (where you can feed the seals - they really don't like it when you feed the seals, but I do it all the time!), or Dalkey (even the train ride out there is picturesque) or Malahide Village - for a lot of these though, you're at the mercy of the weather. If you go to Dun Laoghaire you can get a Dublin Bay Cruise which I've never done, but guess would be nice. All of these places are along the same train line (there's only one!) but are at either end of Dublin Bay, so you could do Howth and Malahide in the same trip easily or Dun Laoghaire and Dalkey (which is in the other direction).   If you'd prefer to stay in the city centre / the weather doesn't hold up, there are plenty of indoor things to do also, such as the Jameson Distillery Tour, Guinness Storehouse Tour, National Musuem of Ireland (which is free!!), Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin Castle, or some sightseeing of Christchurch Cathedral and St. Patrick Cathedral.  If you're into sport, there are some cool stadiums you could do tours of also, such as Croke Park I think it's second or third biggest stadium in Europe, the also do a Skyline Tour and there's the Aviva Stadium.  Dude - I don't even work for the tourist board! I guess that's just the Irish welcome! Hope you have a great time!"
Dublin,36q0ov,legitwantdis,4,Fri May 22 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"The Mezz in Templebar is a good spot, live music and free entry every night. Very popular amongst staff from other bars. Look up Publin for a directory of Dublin pubs, there's no lack of them."

Dublin,36pejn,Simon_K,2,Thu May 21 09:13:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Sandycove will work for you depth wise, you'd be lucky to get 10m at high tide. There are definitely some free divers around most are spearfishers though rather than just free divers.  UCD actually has one of the biggest scuba diving clubs in the country. Talk to Des who runs it, he maybe able to point you in the right direction."
Dublin,36pejn,meanaspie,1 point,Thu May 21 09:39:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I'm a beginner so I think that max 10m should be fine. My main concerns are the pollution coming in from the city through the river as well as the marine life population. But i'm assuming that the visibility at sandycove and the marine life are pretty good then?  Also, would you say that biking to and from UCD to sandycove is practical?"
Dublin,36pejn,meanaspie,1 point,Sat May 23 03:48:21 2015 UTC,Just checked my log I've only actually shore dived from Sandycove twice and the depth both times was ~8m but I've no record of if that was high tide or not....  Pollution is not an issue at all the vast majority of shore diving in Dublin is done from Sandycove I don't think I've ever been down there and not seen a few divers and I'm there most weeks as my club house is in Sandycove. I assume you're talking about pollution from the Liffey (the river on which Dublin is built) Sandycove is far enough away from there that it has no effect.  There is sealife I wouldn't say it's abundant but there's enough to keep me entertained when diving. As for vis I'lll be honest really good vis there is 5-7m but generally reports of the vis are anything from 1 - 3/4m. There's a group on fb for Vis reports around Ireland (https://www.facebook.com/groups/155394051249714/) but most of the reports are for Sandycove.  As biking yeah that shouldn't be a problem google says it's ~9k each way the roads are good and a lot of the way there shold be cycle lanes I think.

Dublin,36pfgb,rellis3953,1 point,Thu May 21 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"In my experience, by far the best way to find the best restaurants/pubs etc in Ireland is word of mouth. Ask a local, a bartender, shopkeeper, tradesperson, etc. We're a naturally talkative people. If you look online, you'll just come across hip or touristy locations.   As regards what to see in Dublin, this question comes up daily on /r/Dublin and so look back through past answers, it's pretty much all been covered. My personal favorite tour of the city is the Viking Splash tour; as a local, it's the only one I've bothered to take. For Cork, I'd try /r/Cork as there is a longstanding rivalry between the two cities. (Dubliners will tell you that people from Cork are gormless langers, and Corkonians will tell you that Dubliners just got off the boat from England and can get right back on it again tyvm).  Outside of Dublin, look to Wicklow. It's got some great foodie places and awesome scenery. Check out Enniskerry, Powerscourt, the Wicklow Way etc."
Dublin,36pfgb,PurpleWomat,1 point,Thu May 21 07:03:27 2015 UTC,"I have legitimately never heard of O’Malley’s Ice-cream. Anyone else?  Murphy's Icecream are good  though.  One thing I'd recommend that you haven't mentioned are St. Michan's Church where in the crypts you can see naturally mummified bodies. Close to there is the Cobblestone pub which is a good spot for traditional Irish music and it's not as touristy (or overpriced) as Temple Bar.  Also our National Art Gallery, National Museum and Natural History Museum are all free entry and right next to each other.  If you're renting a car my top recommend would be a drive through Sally Gap towards  Glendalough in Wicklow. Is beautiful drive and there are some great walk and scenery in Glendalough. If you're not renting then I'm sure the must be someone doing tours on that route (although Sally Gap is a pretty narrow old military road so it's not suitable for big buses.)"

Dublin,36ltf1,relevantusername-,5,Wed May 20 09:41:03 2015 UTC,"Renting in dublin is insanely expensive.  You're looking at around 400-800 euros in rent and bills per month, depending on the area, plus deposit is typially one or two months worth of rent on top. This is for a shared apartment/house.   Other than that you just check rent.ie or daft.ie and try to find something you like.  If you want to know more you should ask more specific questions."
Dublin,36ltf1,Panigg,7,Wed May 20 10:07:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed with all of this so much. I feel sorry for the parents too - surely, there's few out there who still want their 23-30 year old kid living with them full-time. I moved out when I was 18 and yea, sometimes it sucks having to work out bills and rent, and do your own groceries and laundry but that's how you learn life skills. It's shocking how incapable some people my age (25) I know are, mostly because they've never lived away from Mammy and Daddy.  OP, I would advise you to move out as soon as you can. Yes, it's expensive, and yes, you'll be spending a hell of a lot more than when you were living at home. But the independence and the skills you acquire are so worth it. Budget right and you'll be fine anyway - you might just have to reel in any luxury expenses for a while."

Dublin,36ltf1,PurpleWomat,-4,Thu May 21 07:03:37 2015 UTC,Personally I would continue to live at home and save as much as possible. I know in my neighbourhood everyone's children are still living at home and they are nearly 30( it's a really nice area).   Like you are using savings to rent. It doesn't make any sense. You will be living beyond your means. My advice would be live at home and try save for a deposit for a house/apartment. Or even save a little and you will still have a far better lifestyle than if you move out
Dublin,36ltf1,unsureguy2015,2,Wed May 20 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this at all. Get out there. Experience life. My house sharing days were some of the best times of my life. You can never go back in time and experience it. You'll have plenty of time later on to settle down, save, get a mortgage. Living at home until your nearly 30 is also pretty selfish. Your kinda asking mum and dad to shell out so you can keep money for yourself. It's also pretty embarrassing and lame.  Carpe Diem motherfucker!"

Experiencing life is going abroad or travelling(which is possible on money not spent on rent).   I know plenty of people who live with their parents and their parents have zero issues with it. They brought a 4 bed house for a reason. Whats lame is realising at 35, that you are in a houseshare with no savings and have to pay for wedding and somehow find a deposit for a mortgage.   Personally Im going to save for a few years to get a deposit for mortgage for a 2 bed. Then move out. Ill get rent from the spare room and not be wasting money on rent. Its literally a few years of savings to have financial independence later in life."
Dublin,36ltf1,unsureguy2015,2,Wed May 20 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"Each to their own I suppose. We're all in different financial and family situations and with different career and life aspirations.  To give a little context, I'm 33 now. I grew up in and studied in Australia, graduated at 23 and moved out of home immediately (Mum & Dad starting charging rent once I was on a full-time wage). I spent 3 years working while living with housemates (it was a kip but we all loved it) and saved enough to travel South and Central America for a year. I then lived and worked in UK and ended up in Dublin while continuing to travel Europe. I lived in a share house in Dublin (loved it and met lifelong Irish friends). I now live with my Irish fiance, we own an apartment, currently rent and have saved enough to pay 50% deposit on a nice house (when we find one).  I guess what I would encourage is to take (calculated and sensible) risks in life. Throw yourself in the deep end. Plan for the future but don't discount today. You never know, that first housemate could end up connecting you to an amazing career opportunity. They could turn out to be a successful business partner. Hell they could end up your wife!  (ps I would recommend a share house (4 bed) over sharing an apartment though. Cheaper and much more sociable.)"

Dublin,36eies,legitwantdis,3,Wed May 20 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"As others have said, Generator is the most popular hostel, and has quite a bit going on in the hostel itself, that it brings people from Dublin in there as well as tourists.  So, what other things — these are the enjoyable things I've done and come as my recommendations, but hopefully others will give you some suggestions or comments on my suggestions.  History  The Little Museum of Dublin is a small museum in a Georgian Building on St. Stephen's Green, which covers much of the history of Dublin in a short amount of time. It's really enjoyable, and you can either do it on your own or do one of the guided tours. Neither will take up a lot of your time. Entry is €7 and the guided tours are on the hour, every hour. http://www.littlemuseum.ie/  Colins Barracks is another museum that covers a lot of the historical elements to Ireland, and is definitely worth checking out. You could easily spend 1–2 days there. It covers the history of Ireland in terms of clothes, furniture, money, and more popularly — the 1916 rising and Irish War of Independence. Entry is free. http://www.museum.ie/en/intro/arts-and-history.aspx  Seeing Dublin  The Dublin Bus Tours which start on Cathal Brugha Street are also really fun, and if you get a good driver doing the live commentary, it can be quite entertaining. Tickets are €22 and available from Dublin Bus Offices on O' Connell Street. There are now 2 routes for this bus, and I definitely recommend the Original/Purple Route for a more historic tour of Dublin. http://www.dublinsightseeing.ie/citytour.aspx  There are also walking tours that take you to places around the city. There are so many of these though and all cover different areas. I can't recommend one specifically as it depends on times that suit.  Places I recommend  There are a lot of places that you may not see as part of any tours, but places that I like for various reasons, mainly that they are just nice, include:   Grand Canal Dock Iveagh Gardens Smithfield Square (This is where Generator Hostel is) Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin Sandymount Beach   Again, there are many other places but these are nice places that I like to go just to relax and be in nice surroundings.  Places to eat  There are so many places to eat, so again these are just places I like.  Irish Food Ann's Bakery on Mary Street on Sunday for what many would call a traditional roast dinner. I love it, although many others would have suggestions for authentic Irish food.  The Hairy Lemon on Stephen Street also do a broad mix of food, but stew is one of the dishes they serve, and that's probably one thing I'd recommend as an Irish meal plus it's a really nice pub too.  ""Irish"" food isn't really as strongly identifiable as Spanish or Italian, so Dublin really offers a wide range of cuisines more so than traditional Irish food.  Burgers  If you like burgers, then there are 2 places I'd recommend. The Counter on Suffolk Street lets you build your own burger with thousands of different combinations of toppings.  There is also Bunsen which has 2 restaurants now. One is on Wexford Street and the other is in Temple Bar. They have 2 options, a hamburger or a cheeseburger. Since they have such a limited menu, they make them really well and they are probably the juiciest of burgers around. Be prepared to wait 20–30 minutes for a table in the evenings. I don't feel the burgers are worth queuing for, but you might like to try it if the opportunity arises.  Mexican Food  There are so many Mexican places. For a more restaurant feel, I recommend Acupolco on George's Street. For more relaxed Mexican Food, try 777 which is opposite Acupolco, or else Mission which is on Liffey Street.  Pizza  There are quite a few nice places for pizza, and many dispute the best, but if you're near any of these, do try to get something from there.  Vincenzo's in Fairview, which is a suburb of Dublin. However, it's right beside the Marino Casino which is an interesting visit, so you could head out there one day and kill 2 birds with the 1 stone. They do some great pizza's with toppings that aren't very common in most pizza places.  Firehouse in Ballymun, which is again a suburb, and there isn't really anything else nearby, but if you are out in the Botanic Gardens, then it is not too far away.  Di Fontaine's on Parliament street is probably the closest place if you are in the city centre, and it is my favourite pizza slice, but there are a lot of similar places to it, this was just one of the earliest places to do late night pizza slices.  Seafood  Seafood is quite popular in Dublin, and there are so many places that claim to be the best.  The most basic which you should try is a traditional ""chip shop"" in Dublin, however this isn't fine dining. They sell fresh cod (in batter) and chips, and this is somewhat of a more renowned ""Irish Meal"" and you should try it while you're here. There are so many chippers/chip shops in Dublin, but most central would be Leo Burdocks on Liffey Street or in Temple Bar.  For proper seafood, there are really so many restaurants. For Chowder, I would recommend either The Winding Stair on Ormond Quay, or else a day trip out to Stoop Your Head in Skerries where they have in my opinion, the best chowder and the best Dublin Bay Prawns in Dublin.  Like I said though, there are so many places for seafood that it's hard to recommend one place.  Chicken Wings  One place in Dublin that is notorious for it's chicken wings is Elephant and Castle, and I think you should try there if you like chicken wings, as they are somewhat of a popular thing in Dublin if you like Chicken Wings.  I think that's enough for food! There are so many places though. There is of course McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, etc., but the above are some of the more popular places around Dublin.  I'll move on to what you probably care most about — night life!  Night Life  Since you mentioned Temple Bar, I will say that you should take a walk down Fleet Street all the way to the end of Temple Bar just to take in the atmosphere, but there really isn't anything special about the pubs in Temple Bar other than being overcrowded and over priced.  Remember, there is a pub called the Temple Bar but this isn't what people are referring to. Temple Bar is the entire area of Fleet Street/Crown Alley, and all the way down to Fishamble Street.  In terms of quiet pubs, less loud places to drink, I would recommend:   Grogans on South William Street The Church Bar on Mary Street Solas on Wexford Street No Name Bar on Fade Street The Hairy Lemon on Stephen Street   These are all based on taste, but they're nice and not too quiet and not too lively.  If you want some more lively places that aren't overly busy but can get full later on weekend nights, then I'd recommend:   Mary' Bar on Wicklow Street Pygmalion on South William Street Grand Social on Liffey Street Cafe en Seine on Dawson Street (nice interior too) The Garage Bar in Temple Bar (small place, good music) Opium on Wexford Street The Grafton Lounge on Royal Hibernian Way (can get quite busy later on) 4 Dame Lane on... Dame Lane The Globe on George's Street Harry's on The Green which is at St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre   There are a lot more, but these are the places I enjoy when I want to meet some friends for a drink, but nothing too crazy or with too many drunk people.  If you then want later clubs etc., there are few, and most are much the same in terms of drinks prices, and the crowd. The most popular places would be:   The Palace on Camden Street Copper Face Jacks on Harcourt Street Black Door on Harcourt Street (supposed to be a minimum age of 27) Everleigh Garden on Harcourt Street D2 on Harcourt Street Howl at the Moon on Mount Street   I could be here forever to go through everything, but this is a list of what I'd recommend. Some others might have comments about the places I've said, and possibly places to avoid, but I hope this gives you some ideas if you are looking for things to fill your time.  If you get stuck while you're here, just PM me and I can help you out. Have fun!"

Some good natured abuse from my mates but nothing that ever came close to getting to me. I saved a fortune - not just the booze cost but the no late night taxis and odd eating habits and chip shops etc, quite amazing how much that can rack up."
Dublin,36ah49,ABabyAteMyDingo,2,Sun May 17 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"The savings are astounding. The amount of money I would call acceptable for a night out back in the day would be enough to feed myself for two weeks, or make up a sizeable portion of my rent bill."

Dublin,367h8v,XelectDub,1 point,Mon May 18 00:19:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah D&D is a good example. There are loads of different genres of games you can play and there's usually something for everyone. All you need is a bit of imagination, basic grasp of the rules and your enthusiasm. There's a group that meets every Wednesday in Hughes bar and they always welcome new members. You can even just pop down and watch them play over a pint to get the hang of what's going on. I played there for a long time then took a break but starting up again in a few weeks. If you wanna call down give me a shout and we can have a pint and see what's happening. At the minute they are playing Fallout.  I get to plenty of gigs too. Similar to your tastes, lots of punk/ska. You tried just heading down to Fibbers, the Pint and the Gypsy Rose? Always good gigs on and people are pretty friendly."

Dublin,364xsq,galloo,8,Sat May 16 16:45:13 2015 UTC,Chapter one I guess. I've never been but hear great things. Michelin star and pricey though.
Dublin,364xsq,bainneban,3,Sat May 16 06:58:32 2015 UTC,"Well there are six restaurants in Dublin with Michelin stars, that might be as good a measure as anything else. I had the privilege of eating in one of them years and years ago (Patrick Guilbaud's) and it was an amazing experience (helped by the fact that I wasn't paying for it!). Oh, I just remembered I've eaten in one of the others too - Chapter One. Also wonderful but not quite the same experience, though that was just because it was for a corporate lunch type thing.  The others on the list are Thornton's, Bon Appétit in Malahide, L'Ecrivain, and Locks Brasserie."
Dublin,364xsq,kitty_o_shea,4,Sat May 16 08:50:10 2015 UTC,Locks doesn't have one anymore. The Greenhouse on Dawson Street is worth a look even though it doesn't have a star yet. Or Shanahan's on the Green if she likes steak.
Dublin,364xsq,ireland123,1 point,Sat May 16 09:01:38 2015 UTC,Ate at the Greenhouse last week..it was spectacular
Dublin,364xsq,Bective,2,Sun May 17 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"L'Ecrivain and Locks were both better than Chapter One in my experience. I think a lot depends on what you order. Locks was probably the best value out of all three though. I think, in general, the premium paid for Michelin star places is not worth it.  Recently, Saison on Kildare Street impressed me. Worth checking out."
Dublin,364xsq,Echeos,2,Sat May 16 09:58:02 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're after, if it's a serious culinary experience you're wanting i think Sabor Brazil takes it - you need 4 hours at least though, 7 courses, it's the best I've ever been to but it's pricey and even now you would be lucky to get a table for July (pretty much no chance on a weekend night - booked up months and months ahead).  Indian - Ananda in Dundrum, it's not like any other indian restaurant, it's like gourmet indian, lamb shanks and the lot. It's amazing.  Chinese - China Siuchuan in Sandyford, again not your silver tray version of chinese, they import their own chefs, obviously no msg, great great food.  There are loads, narrow it down a bit to your/her taste."
Dublin,364xsq,megacorn,2,Sat May 16 12:16:26 2015 UTC,What's the deal with Sabor Brazil ? Is Brazilian food that amazing? It doesn't look like much more than a cafe from the outside.
Dublin,364xsq,Tadhg,1 point,Sat May 16 14:36:26 2015 UTC,"Yea it looks tiny and it is, I've only been twice and the first time there was only 3 tables (for two). The second time they'd extended to a second room but there's still only 6 or 7 tables for two and each table takes only one sitting per night. The menu changes every night but is set, as in you don't pick anything unless you're allergic or have some other dietary needs.. sounded dodge the first but but I was immediately converted after the first starter, they know what they're doing and with the courses take you on a sort of tour of Brazilian cuisine, giving you a backstory to every part of it.. serious stuff altogether.   They horse the drink into you as well which is good.   They're number 1 on tripadvisor for restaurants in Dublin and deserve it, in my opinion. Obviously there's loads of top ones I haven't been to but of the ones I have it's definitely the best."
Dublin,364xsq,megacorn,2,Sat May 16 16:34:33 2015 UTC,Agreed on Siuchuan.  It's modern Chinese fine dining.  I'm quite fond of Fade street too.  Butchers Grill in Ranlaigh do excellent steaks.

If you want to spend less but get as equally good food, go to Forrest Avenue or  Mulberry Garden. If you fancy something a bit more boozy and loud, Coppinger Row is good, the food is good (I used to chef there) and the new gin and tonic menu is very very good. Avoid Rustic Stone, drury buildings, or Fade street, all vastly overpriced and substandard food. Winding stair is a bit meh, nice concept but very badly executed"

Dublin,35mvif,BZH_JJM,2,Tue May 12 15:40:58 2015 UTC,This is a bit ridiculous considering more and more people are using Hailo or calling a taxi
Dublin,35mvif,unsureguy2015,1 point,Mon May 11 20:43:12 2015 UTC,"I work near a rank and will Hailo a cab often instead of using it because I can pay by card.  I can enter in my destination so the driver knows how long of a fare it is instead of getting into a cab at the rank and getting bitched at because it's only €10 and he's been on the rank for an hour.   Some Hailo drivers don't seem to know how to use the map part of the app at all, but this has been getting steadily better so you get less ""so where is 1 Main Street"" phone calls. The only advantage I see with a rank is that the driver knows where you are for the pickup.   All the firms have to keep a record of all their pickups. I wonder could the council use the data from big firms like NRC, Hailo etc to establish how many cabs on average are needed at each time of day to say ""no more than 4 cabs on rank 21 during peak hours"" or something as it's ridiculous the way it is as the minute. I don't see how more ranks will help, sure ranks can only take like ten cabs at a time."
Dublin,35mvif,Lotsoffeelings,0,Tue May 12 04:17:14 2015 UTC,"If the main concern is overflowing ranks, then reduce the amount of medallions in the market. With uber and Hailo operating now it has never been more efficient for taxis to get jobs. The reason why the ranks are overflowing is the saturation of the market and people using uber(not medallion drivers). If they are sitting in ranks, there are clearly too many working."
Dublin,35mvif,MMcB,2,Tue May 12 01:36:36 2015 UTC,Here uber drivers are just taxi drivers the insurance doesn't allow for non taxi's...uber drivers must hold an spsv license which you can only get after paying and garda vetting...it's not like the states where it's anyone as long as you've x standard of car.

Dublin,35mvif,louiseber,1 point,Tue May 12 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"So I thought that Uber drivers did not have medallions and that they were raising supply. Let's say for example the overall supply is 20,000 cabs. X = medallions, U= Ubers.  X + U=20,000  But in fact you said that Ubers still need to be actual taxis. Thus, X=20,000. I thought that the Uber drivers without medallions were partly causing over saturation. The fact that they have medallions means the market of drivers is oversupplying itself."

Dublin,35mpgc,btwontletmecallhome,2,Mon May 11 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"I was supposed to be in Galway for the second half of my stay, I'll still try to see if I can make that happen."
Dublin,35mpgc,CaptainEarlobe,0,Mon May 11 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"i am a Dub. i like dublin - some days i even love it - but this Captain is right, if you come to ireland for a week and stay in dublin you've wasted your time. Go west: northwest, southwest or just west but go west. it's where ireland is."
Dublin,35mpgc,legitwantdis,1 point,Tue May 12 08:05:21 2015 UTC,The nice part of Ireland is not Dublin    Traitor!
Dublin,35mpgc,CaptainEarlobe,1 point,Mon May 11 20:21:20 2015 UTC,Sorry. I've been living in this city for 12 years. It's expensive and it's shit.
Dublin,35mpgc,legitwantdis,1 point,Mon May 11 20:42:57 2015 UTC,Why do you think it's shit?
Dublin,35mpgc,CaptainEarlobe,0,Tue May 12 07:01:49 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't compare well with other European cities. The people are nice, but that's about it. The weather is awful, it's full of junkies, everything is expensive, the food is crap, it's unsafe at night...."
Dublin,35mpgc,legitwantdis,2,Tue May 12 07:17:40 2015 UTC,Are you Irish or have you moved here from another country?
Dublin,35mpgc,CaptainEarlobe,0,Tue May 12 07:44:18 2015 UTC,I'm Irish
Dublin,35mpgc,legitwantdis,1 point,Tue May 12 07:49:25 2015 UTC,What European cities are you comparing Dublin to?
Dublin,35mpgc,parmstar,1 point,Tue May 12 08:00:18 2015 UTC,I'm not getting a lot out of this conversation.
Dublin,35mpgc,CaptainEarlobe,2,Tue May 12 17:00:36 2015 UTC,Well I'm just wondering what cities you're using as a baseline to say Dublin is shit?
Dublin,35mpgc,Done2me,1 point,Tue May 12 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"What's so bad about it? I just moved and don't find it too bad - I quite like the pace of the city. Came in from Toronto and Vancouver, though I don't know if that makes a difference.  Would be interested in hearing the other sides' perspective!"
Dublin,35liw3,btwontletmecallhome,2,Mon May 11 14:15:25 2015 UTC,/u/boxofcarrots said he would take some snaps if he resurrected from the scratcher in time. Let's hope he did!
