This promotional campaign was orchestrated by the man himself, after a couple of years where his reputation took some serious damage. It has generally been regarded as a way of being 'ahead' of the critics, going all out and exaggerating himself and his ego so much that any criticism of him will be drowned out. Of course he did not see himself as a mighty superhuman, but the intention was definitely to be louder and more in-your-face than his detractors were and would be. Pretty interesting stuff, might have backfired as so many of his well-intended decisions did ultimately.  Also, MJ loved military themes and historical figures, so it all makes sense. Kinda."

Much like seasons six and eleven, this season was lambasted by critics for its decline in quality. Season twenty suffered from having sketches based on very thin premises, a high number of which focused on or mentioned O. J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial.  Much like the 1980–1981 season and the 1985–1986 season, NBC worried over SNL's decline in quality (and in the ratings) and initially decided that now would be the best time to pull the plug on the show once and for all. According to the prime time special Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation, Lorne Michaels credits this season as the closest he's ever been to being fired. In the end, the cast member firings and crew turnover resulting from this season represented the biggest involvement into the show's affairs by NBC executives since the 1980–1981 season and the biggest cast overhaul since the 1985–1986 season.[1]   The next season saw a large renewal of the cast, with the introduction of members like Will Ferrell, Darrell Hammond, David Koechner and Nancy Walls."

The record we have built up over the last two years and the things we’re trying to do to implement it give it relevance.” It was, by most accounts, the lowest point of the Clinton presidency. The next day, domestic terrorists bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and Clinton’s strong response put him back on track for reelection in 1996."

The strike began on August 12, 1994 and resulted in the remainder of that season being cancelled, including the postseason and, for the first time since 1904, the World Series. The strike was suspended on April 2, 1995 after 232 days, making it the longest such stoppage in MLB history and breaking the record that the 1981 strike set.  948 games were cancelled in all, and MLB became the first major professional sports league to lose an entire postseason (the National Hockey League lost its entire 2004-05 season to a lockout, while the Arena Football League lost its entire 2009 season owing to financial issues). Due to the strike, both the 1994 and 1995 seasons were not played to a complete 162 games; the strike was called after most teams had played at least 113 games in 1994 and each team played 144 games in 1995.
