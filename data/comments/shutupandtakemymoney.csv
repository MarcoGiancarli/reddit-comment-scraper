shutupandtakemymoney,3dyv2i,rxninja,6,Mon Jul 20 17:26:44 2015 UTC,So...how do you play?  Sell me!
shutupandtakemymoney,3dyv2i,formulapharaoh9,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll give you the pitch and some details. This is generally what I tell people at conventions, too.     Yomi's Gate is a dynamic strategy game for two players where the board is different every time you play. In it, you get samurai or oni units and you use their special abilities to either wipe out the opposing army, capture their stronghold, or defeat their hero units. It's for people who like games like Risk and Axis & Allies but want something that can be played in under an hour and without any frustrating randomness.     That's the pitch. If you want to know more detail, keep reading.   To set up, you take the three large prototiles and three small filler tiles to randomly create a new map. Each player places their fortress on their own prototile, with the third being a neutral tile that gets the Temple. At that point, you're completely done with setup since your army starts in reserve, off the board. All in all, you can go from box to table in under two minutes.   Gameplay is also fast, as there's no dice rolling, card draw, shuffling, or management of any complex resource system. On most turns, you'll bring in 2-3 units from your reserve and then move units that are in play one at a time. You can move all of your units in play every turn, but everything dies pretty quickly so there's rarely an overabundance of moves to be made at once.   Units all have flexible movement styles, using an energy system for movement, attacks, and abilities. For instance, the basic Samurai unit has 4 energy and attacks cost 1, so it could either move 4 spaces or move 3 and make an attack. All attacks are resolved like Chess, so they're instantly successful with no random failure or delay for dice rolling.   Finally, there are two factions, Samurai and Oni, and each has 7 units (4 with multiples and 3 unique heroes). This means you can play Samurai vs Samurai, Oni vs Oni, or Samurai vs Oni, allowing for balanced or asymmetrical play.   All of this can be read about in free, downloadable instructions found on the linked page.   I designed and produce this game entirely on my own using my own 60W laser. Everything you see in the images is made by me, including all of the art, the units, the board design, and even the hand-assembled acrylic boxes. The idea was that I didn't want to wait for someone else to tell me that my game was good enough for other people to enjoy, so I bypassed the entire production, publication, and distribution system to do everything myself.   So far, it's a game people very much seem to enjoy. It was extremely well received at SXSW and continues to show well at local events. It's a game that hits all of the wargame/strategy notes and dodges many of the inconvenient conventions like long setup, complicated rules, and extended play sessions. At this point, I only really want to come up with rules for more than 2 players and release more factions, both of which I have plans for if I can continue to sell copies and get closer to actually making a living.   I hope that answers your question! Please feel free to ask me anything else if you're still curious."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dyv2i,formulapharaoh9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"You most certainly did!  Your creation sounds simply spectacular, very interesting.  However, I have to wonder, with only six tiles, your map certainly won't be random every time.  That small quibble aside, the entire setup is beautifully crafted, and reminds me of a less insane and complex version of heroscape.  I do also enjoy your notable lack of outside instruments required, truly a time saving mechanism.  I think I'm going to have to add another game to game night soon..."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dyv2i,VinnyValentini,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:04 2015 UTC,"However, I have to wonder, with only six tiles, your map certainly won't be random every time.   There are actually only three prototiles, though there's a pool of four filler tiles for the edges.   That said...  There are six orientations for each prototile, plus the exact interlocking arrangement can vary, plus there are different patterns for three tiles (triangle, ""L"", and straight line). For instance, in a triangle configuration, having A and B on top with C on the bottom is different than having A and C on top with B on the bottom.   When you add in three filler tiles for the triangle layout and four for the L and line, the actual numbers get crazy high. I have a pretty strong handle on math and spatial reasoning, but even I have trouble figuring out exactly how many combinations that is. With just the three prototiles in the same spots and different rotations, it's a minimum of 216 configurations, but it's clearly way more than that in practice.   It is incredibly unlikely that you'll ever play the same map twice.     As for the rest of your comment, thank you very much! I haven't played Heroscape, but looking at it your comment sounds accurate. Yomi's Gate is based in part off of the old Avalon Hill game, Feudal, and it tends to draw comparisons to Kemet, which I also really want to play for that reason.   Keeping outside stuff out of the picture was always part of the plan, partially to minimize setup and play time but also to keep the material costs as low as possible. Even then, I designed Yomi's Gate without much of a mind for production and the deluxe edition takes a maddening 3-4 hours per copy to craft. The box, while the ideal package for the game, takes as much time and material to make as the rest of the game combined.   Anyway, I could talk about Yomi's Gate all night, so I'll stop there. Thank you again for checking it out and I hope I get to make a copy for you soon!"

We got a bunch of different kinds as gifts and the ones that were designed for swaddling, with little hoods or velcro were not as good as these plain square wraps.   Damn, I really miss swaddling.

shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,aimbonics,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"do you wash your body with soap in the shower?    is soap a scam? with oil pulling you're rinsing your mouth with oil which clings on to the bacteria pulling it out of hard to reach areas. then when you spit it out it is removing it from your mouth, the concept is very simple. The oil does not kill bacteria and we have never claimed for it to do so."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,beef_goulash,7,Mon Jul 20 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"I understand your stance on the subject. I get where you are coming from. Logically your argument that oil will remove bacteria when you swill and spit may have merit. Where I draw the line is comparing soap to an oil you swill around your mouth. I expect that even if ""Oil Pulling"" was studied that it would have little or no impact over good dental hygiene in the first place.  The American Dental Association states;  ""Based on the lack of currently available evidence, oil pulling is not recommended as a supplementary oral hygiene practice, and certainly not as a replacement for standard, time-tested oral health behaviors and modalities.

shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,damnshoes,5,Mon Jul 20 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"Dental Student here, there is little science behind oil pulling, it's a traditional Indian folk way to clean teeth and the claims made can be done through regular brushing and use of chlorhexidine mouthwash.   While research is needed before you can claim something is good for you or healthy, you don't need scientific proof for a cosmetic claim so they can say whatever they want about how much it changes the appearance.   Another thing to bear in mind is that people who will spend money on this are more likely to care about their teeth so will take the time look after them and therefore appear to have healthier teeth."

shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,VenetiaMacGyver,0,Mon Jul 20 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"we worked with both dentists and dental hygienists while making this, it won't be available for resale in clinics because they make a fortune from teeth whitening (bleaching your teeth) - their process strips away enamel and is horrible for your teeth.

Let's go.... Cough 'em up, Chompers."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,VenetiaMacGyver,5,Tue Jul 21 00:40:15 2015 UTC,"Oh god the lack of scientific evidence and abundance of snake oil salesman wording in this website is astounding.   PerlaCoco has reinvented the oil pulling experience with our 100% natural method that will provide much more than just a clean mouth.   The act of oil pulling is essentially using PerlaCoco oil as an oral rinse. The oil is swished and pulled around the mouth for 15-20 minutes; when first starting shorter periods of times might be used to train yourself up to 20 minutes. The oil reaches all sections of the mouth, teeth and gums, causing bacteria to stick to the fatty layers within the oil. All bacteria are covered with a fatty layer of protection, that then sticks to the fat in the oil eventually exiting all of the hiding spots within our mouth. The oil will reach a cloudy state after 20 minutes and is then spat into the garbage ridding your mouth of all that bacteria.       WTF ...?  First, good luck swishing anything in your mouth for 20 fucking minutes and not have your mouth 100% full of saliva.  Second, The ADA specifically states that:   oil pulling is not recommended as a supplementary oral hygiene practice, and certainly not as a replacement for standard, time-tested oral health behaviors and modalities   and    Recent articles in the media recommending oil pulling procedures generally have not described potential adverse health effects, but case reports of lipoid pneumonia associated with oil pulling or mineral oil aspiration5 have appeared in the literature.  In addition, cases of diarrhea or upset stomach have been reported.   There is no actual, peer-reviewed evidence which shows that oil-pulling is more effective than anything else, other than a few case reports that it is actually harmful to some people.  Come back and hock your snake oil remedies after they're proven to not be snake oil, please."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,SooperModelsDotCom,0,Mon Jul 20 17:30:36 2015 UTC,It's not at any point stating that you stop brushing your teeth because you are using this. You use it in addition to that.
shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,dylanjhunt,4,Mon Jul 20 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"That's funny, because verbiage like this:    Many people spend thousands of dollars on oral products like mouthwash, teeth whitening, and many more that in the end hurt your oral health. PerlaCoco has created an enjoyable experience that yields far more benefits than the investment involved.   Implies that it's intended as a replacement for other forms of tooth care.   The FAQ says that you should brush, but it doesn't say anything about flossing or mouthwash -- as if it's a replacement for those things. I guarantee you will not find an actual, board-certified dentist, who isn't on Perlacoco's payroll, who agrees with that."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,misterchief117,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:34 2015 UTC,But don't you get it man?  It's all a conspiracy by Big Dental!  The ADA is totally out to get you. /s
shutupandtakemymoney,3dydib,PriceZombie,4,Mon Jul 20 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"Well I mean there are anecdotal results to this that some people report which imply that it helps. There's anecdotal evidence for pretty much everything, but I don't think this stuff would harm you if you used it in addition to all normal, ADA-approved dental hygiene.  What astounds me is when people try to say ""hey look at this thing that people did thousands of years ago!"" as a means of getting you to try it.  Without access to modern dental care, then yes, swishing nearly anything other than sugar or strong acid through your mouth to try to clean it out is probably a fuckload better than doing nothing.   But you know what else people did a really long time ago?    They examined the livers of sheep to determine if you were sick (ancient Mesopotamia).  They crammed the dooks of elephants, along with flowers, in vaginas as contraception (ancient Egyptians).  They bored holes in skulls to let out demons (multiple cultures).  They put ground-up dead mice in their mouths to relieve toothache (ancient Egyptians).     The list goes on and on. Did it work sometimes, anecdotally? Sure. Were they a good idea and a replacement for modern medicine? Fuck no!"

shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,Ikari_Shinji_kun_01,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:03 2015 UTC,There is a hole in the bottom and the tap that pours the beer in seals the hole after with a little lid
shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,Stiggy1605,-51,Fri Jul 17 20:05:48 2015 UTC,Am I the only guy who prefers to tilt the glass when pouring a cold one? (although I drink local microbrew which is pretty heavy.)
shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,Ikari_Shinji_kun_01,22,Fri Jul 17 13:12:47 2015 UTC,You tilt it when pouring so it doesn't splash around and froth up from the fall into the glass.There's no reason to tip it when filling from the bottom.
shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,puterTDI,-58,Fri Jul 17 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"Actually no, I tilt it so some of the carbonation evaporates quicker. As I said it's a heavy beer (10%) and if I don't tilt it it will take 20 minutes for the head to go down."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,Stiggy1605,17,Fri Jul 17 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"The tilting prevents the beer from being agitated by the fall, which releases CO2 and is what causes the head to appear.  This is actually the same reason why you shake a keg to carb it up faster, it agitates the beer and allows higher pressure CO2 to enter a beer.  It's also why you don't pour from a keg that has recently been moved.  With a bottom fill system this no longer a problem and you don't need to tilt the glass."
shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,Ikari_Shinji_kun_01,14,Fri Jul 17 13:50:26 2015 UTC,So you agree with me that you tilt it to prevent the beer getting a huge head?
shutupandtakemymoney,3dl6ca,kiranhi,-54,Fri Jul 17 13:58:24 2015 UTC,"No moron, it's to make the head while allowing it to go down quicker which releases some of the carbonation."

A little old lady owned him, and she named him Fingers because he had lots of extra toes on each paw.   He was an amazing cat - she used to being him into the pet store I worked in while in college - she'd put a upside-down basket in a shopping cart, put a blanket on the basket, and place Fingers, who also happened to be the largest cat I've ever met, upon his throne. He would always sit there calmly and quietly as Mad√≠ pushed him around and shopped, and he didn't seem to mind when kids came up and pet him, or when dogs were in the store, or really anything - it was amazing - I've never met a cat like that before or after. There's a photo of me dressed up as Santa (I had to fill in at the last minute) with Fingers floating around out there - the store was doing Pet Christmas Photos for a charity fundraiser, and of course Fingers was there, and he was the calmest pet that we got a snapshot of that day.   I haven't worked there for years, but that cat was one of my favorite customers, and even though I'm sure that's totally irrelevant to the conversation, I appreciate the jog in memory.

At $425.75 for 17280 mints, we get $0.02463831019/mint.  From Walmart, at $2.96 for 200 mints, we get $0.0148/mint.  This ratio is roughly 1.66.

shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,GetPorted,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:19:13 2015 UTC,Yes. You got it. We highly recommend visiting a certified locksmith instead of a big box retailer like Home Depot or Lowe's. Locksmiths generally have more key cutting experience and have duplicated a wide range of keys before. We also partner with Key.me which can duplicate your keys onto Blades directly from a photo using their mobile app. It's pretty sweet and I believe that they stock the top 100 key types.

Definitely a lot more expensive but a lot cooler."

If I leave home, I always take my wallet which means I always have a way to get in. My car and lab keys are bundled, because I can only get to work by car, and if I am there, I can get to my lab.  This way if I lose my wallet (happened 2 months ago) I only lose my home and mail keys, and conversely if I lose my car keys I can still get home.  When I go down to for a run, I normally take just the home key and leave everything else back home to minimize loss."

shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,GetPorted,3,Thu Jul 9 00:26:26 2015 UTC,Disclosure: I work for Keyport.  Just wanted to let you know that we are able to integrate transponder chips (we have a side plate that holds a variety of immobilizer chips).  Check out our Auto Checker to learn more on the process and whether or not your auto key is compatible - http://mykeyport.com/auto-checker/.  A couple of other things that differentiates the Keyport from its competition: one-handed access (never have to search through your keys to pick the one you need) and our Reward If Found program via registered serial number - http://keyport.tumblr.com/post/122235705106/the-fallacy-of-lost-keyports.
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,Claychip,6,Thu Jul 9 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the information, but adding the chip takes the price to $80 and still won't eliminate my FOB."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,A_UPRIGHT_BASS,0,Thu Jul 9 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct. For now, the chipped auto Blade would allow you to integrate the key and chip into the Keyport, and you would have to attach your fob to the lanyard. But depending upon your setup, that can make a pretty substantial difference in your everyday carry as the Keyport plus fob often sits more comfortably in the pocket coupled with the Keyport's other features and benefits."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,Lur42,3,Thu Jul 9 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"I would like to address the concern about Keyport keeping copies of customer's keys. As a locksmith, one that sells Keyport as well, I can assure you that Keyport has no interest in keeping your keys. The whole basis for people to trust locksmiths and companies like Keyport is our integrity. If we did something that would make our customers distrust us, we would be out of business very quickly. That said if you are truly concerned about Keyport or anyone else making copies of your keys, you could always upgrade you current locks to High Security locks where the keys cannot be duplicated unless you are an authorized signer.  Keyport cannot duplicate these High Security keys, but they can convert your existing key to work with the Keyport Slide. I'm not trying to get off topic so if anyone has questions about High Security Locks please feel free to ask me. Keyport also encourages people to visit a locksmith to get their Keyport and key blades cut. Keyport even has a locksmith locator on their website.  Also, I wanted to touch on Keyport‚Äôs customer service. They are probably one of the best companies I deal with as far as a vender stand point. They are always quick and pleasantly willing to assist me and any of my customers that have questions, concerns, or problems to which I may not know the answers. They even warrant keys that have been improperly cut at a locksmith when you purchase them from Keyport. The locksmith should also warrant any keys you may buy from them if they are a stocking dealer. I can tell you that I have been selling The Keyport for about 1 year now, and it is probably the only thing I sell that people actually stop back by the shop to talk about how much they love the product."

Assuming you have a vehicle old enough to...not have a keyless entry or ignition security with a chipped key, something that heavy is bad for the ignition cylinder and likely to bump your leg or not even fit.  The last thing you need is weight ruining the cylinder and a large object that your knee could brush and shut your car down.  As a car guy this looks terrible to me."

shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,GetPorted,-2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"Disclosure: I work for Keyport.  With that out of the way, the Keyport Slide fully loaded weighs less than 3.5 ounces, which is substantially less than most keychains.  Unless you are attaching a ton of stuff to the swivel lanyard attachment, this is about the same weight than your traditional plastic headed car key. So, it has not been and should continue not to be an added stress on the ignition.  We might go so far as saying the weight reduction caused by graduating to a Keyport from a traditional keychain may have even spared a few ignitions along the way."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,AGlassOfMilk,4,Thu Jul 9 01:28:53 2015 UTC,which is substantially less than most keychains   A split key ring weighs ~0.6 oz without keys which is the same as your product's listed pre-blades weight.  And a split ring costs ~$1.
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,GetPorted,-2,Thu Jul 9 01:07:57 2015 UTC,"My mistake...I should have said keychains with keys on it. You can take a look at the Specs and Size Comparison towards the bottom of the page here - http://mykeyport.com/product. There is an image of a fully loaded Keyport vs. 6 keys plus split ring. As far as cost is concerned, you are absolutely correct that a split ring costs around a $1, and if that is what you want to carry, then you're all set. I am just explaining the benefits of a stylish, compact, lightweight, one-handed access, no jingle, no smartphone scratching, reward if found, customizable everyday multi-tool that incorporates keys alternative."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,AGlassOfMilk,4,Thu Jul 9 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"A Keyport loaded with six Blades is lighter than six equivalent keys due to the removal of heavy key heads   I took a look.  And I am calling bullshit on this.  Or, if there is a difference, it is effectively imperceptible to 99% of people.  Since you work for this company you should be able to tell me what the difference is (I'm going to guess a few ozs).  Weight isn't a selling point for this product...tell marketing."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,GetPorted,0,Thu Jul 9 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"Not exactly sure what you are calling bullshit on.  There is a difference as you saw from the image.  Whether that is perceptible to the average customer is a fair question, and it is going to depend upon the individual as most customers are not transitioning from just 6 keys plus a split ring. Many use a bulkier keychain which have more keys, tools, etc. on it, so the difference is often more than ounce or two.  Honestly, from the all the feedback we have gathered, weight is a significant issue to many.  So for us designing and building it, every ounce counts."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,AGlassOfMilk,4,Thu Jul 9 07:59:35 2015 UTC,I'm calling bullshit on your spec that:   A Keyport loaded with six Blades is lighter than six equivalent keys due to the removal of heavy key heads   A base keyport and a split key ring weigh the same.  Therefore all the weight lost is in the keys.  I doubt that cutting the heads off 6 keys significantly alters the overall weight.  Do you actually have the data to back up your claim?  How many ozs are we talking about?  If it is only a few then it is inconsequential.  Not every oz counts.
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,lordsprinkles,0,Thu Jul 9 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"As mentioned previously in the thread, there is an image (4th rotating image) in the Specifications & Size Comparison of the Product page on http://mykeyport.com/product which shows the Keyport + 6 Blades = 1.6 oz. while the split ring + 6 standard keys = 2.4 ounces.  And what I said in the previous post was that ""for us..., every ounce counts"" because our customers have said that weight is an important issue for them.  We understand that the difference of an ounce or two may be imperceptible to some, but that doesn't mean it is not important."
shutupandtakemymoney,3clt6y,AGlassOfMilk,3,Fri Jul 10 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"So, your product reduces the weight of my keys by 0.8 oz.  To put that into perspective: 0.8 oz is equivalent to 4 quarters.  Yup, weight isn't a selling point for this product...tell marketing."

shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,fm8,-17,Tue Jul 7 13:40:10 2015 UTC,"you are doing that wrong, or at least not efficiently. we dont need a bunch of water thru the day. we need a certain amount at certain times. If you eat, you need water to digest food. If you are walking around or hot and sweating you need some water. If you are exercising or working really hard, you need a lot of water. If you are sitting on your ass in air-conditioning and not moving for 4 hours watching netflix you need barely any water. When you wake up you need water since you have been sweating it out all night.   Just drinking a set amount of water will actually leave you either over or under hydrated most of the time. Focus on your actual thirst. And if it has been so long that you cant tell between your hunger and thirst. practice to both extremes. eat one day and try not to drink. you will quickly remember what being thirsty feels like, then the next day drink and dont eat. they feel totally different."

shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,Zarknox,4,Tue Jul 7 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, without a doubt. That's how Andy Warhol died. All of your electrolyte levels can get out of balance. That's why athletes drink gatorade.   Fluid overload is especially dangerous in someone with heart failure or impaired kidneys, but it can also be dangerous in a healthy person. A few years ago a radio station hosted a contest: whoever drank the most water won a Nintendo Wii. A lady won it for kids. She died later that day. I think she has drank about 4 gallons, but I can't remember."
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,fm8,3,Tue Jul 7 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"Lol, I thought I was being healthy. How do you suggest I determine a rough amount to drink?"
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,Zarknox,5,Tue Jul 7 15:07:38 2015 UTC,Honestly? The color of your urine will be your best indicator.   Crystal clear? Too much water. Dark yellow? Not nearly enough. Aim for somewhere in the middle.
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,Will_Piss_You_Off,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"thanks, yeah it goes from crystal clear to middle range. I'll try to watch it  as far as electrolytes and that sort of thing, I don't work out everyday but I am active and do stuff like hiking.. any tips for managing that sort of stuff?"
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,Zarknox,4,Tue Jul 7 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"As long as you're eating a good healthy diet (well-rounded), I don't think you have anything to worry about! Most electrolyte concerns come from extreme or marathon styled physical activity. I'll post a bit from the US National Institute of Health.   Fluids and electrolytes (sodium) are consumed by athletes, or recommended to athletes, for a number of reasons, before, during, and after exercise. These reasons are generally to sustain total body water, as deficits (hypohydration) will increase cardiovascular and thermal strain and degrade aerobic performance. Vigorous exercise and warm/hot weather induce sweat production, which contains both water and electrolytes. Daily water (4-10 L) and sodium (3500-7000 mg) losses in active athletes during hot weather exposure can induce water and electrolyte deficits. Both water and sodium need to be replaced to re-establish ""normal"" total body water (euhydration). This replacement can be by normal eating and drinking practices if there is no urgency for recovery. But if rapid recovery (<24 h) is desired or severe hypohydration (>5% body mass) is encountered, aggressive drinking of fluids and consuming electrolytes should be encouraged to facilitate recovery for subsequent competition.   Odds are really good that a normal paced hike doesn't really fall into an extreme category if you're already in shape. But if you're worried, take some salty granola or trail mix along with you to keep those levels up!   Much cheaper than Gatorade/Powerade/etc. too!"
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,Will_Piss_You_Off,5,Tue Jul 7 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"You said that you sip on it, so it's probably not too much.   From Wikipedia: Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication  It's hard for me to say how much you need. I would go by how thirsty you feel and the color of your urine. Dark pee usually means dehydration. At the bare minimum, 0.75 liter is enough to survive, and I wouldn't drink more than 3-4 unless you're exercising a lot. So somewhere in between, closer to 2-2.5L is probably good, but really depends on your overall diet, body size, and level of activity."
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,fm8,2,Tue Jul 7 16:55:22 2015 UTC,thanks! by sip I mean like steadily drinking and refilling throughout the day lol. I'll monitor my urine color but from what I've noticed it goes from crystal clear to the middle color so I will watch that.  Are there any tips for managing electrolytes etc.? I don't work out daily or anything but I am active and do things like hiking/sports occasionally
shutupandtakemymoney,3cf4p8,Zarknox,2,Tue Jul 7 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"Drinking something with electrolytes isn't a bad idea (gatorade, powerade, etc), but you can also make your own electrolyte solution at home mixing salt and sugar with water. It doesn't have everything, but the main concern with dehydration is having low sodium levels. That's why we usually use saline as IV fluid instead of sterile water. It has levels of sodium somewhat proportional to the normal levels in your body.   If you make your own drink, a Google search will probably tell you the ratios you need. Search for homemade electrolyte drink. If you're exercising and sweating A LOT, this might help keep the levels in balance, but otherwise I wouldn't be too concerned about it.  If you are really concerned with your electrolyte levels, you can have your doctor runs some blood tests to check them. Do a lipid panel too while your at it and see your cholesterol levels (always good to know)."

The next day she would remove them and start fresh.   Cheap and easy.

shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,Spaturno,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:24:27 2015 UTC,"If you look at the link they come in 8, 12, and 29 gallon. ¬†  I agree that these are a bad idea and way overpriced, but there are so many horrible fish tanks on the market that are a gallon or less that are ACTUALLY an unsuitable size for a fish, but at least these have filtration and lighting. The smallest is perfect for a betta and a mystery snail buddy, the medium is big enough for a sorority or some small schooling fish and the 29 gallon would actually give you a lot of options."
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,cheevocabra,0,Tue Jul 7 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"Most people think bettas don't need much room because they're kept in small cups at most fish stores, but that's because they will fight with each other and it would take up a lot of space to have a tank for each individual fish.  I personally wouldn't put a betta in anything less than 20 gallons with filtration and heat."
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,Timlad,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you meant 2 gallons? Because 20 gallons for a betta is a little outrageous I think. I have a betta and two mystery snails in a 10g right now and he loves it. I personally wouldn't keep a betta in anything less than 5g, but I think the standard recommendation for a betta tank is a minimum of 2.5 gallons."
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,cheevocabra,2,Tue Jul 7 21:11:54 2015 UTC,"and he loves it   How do you know? I personally installed a suggestion box in my tank, but the comment cards kept getting soggy, so I couldn't read if my betta actually had any suggestions for improvement. Every so often, I even shout the wifi password towards his tank, to remind him that he can just tweet any comments he has, but i don't think he's into social media. Come to think about it, he's kind of a loner/shut in type. I don't think I've seen him with a female over at his place in forever. I keep inviting him out to the bar with me and the guys, but he never shows up. Anyway, he hasn't made a fuss yet, so either there are no issues or he's just to betta to confront me about them."
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,SpaceCowboy58,2,Sat Jul 11 06:58:43 2015 UTC,"No I meant 20 gallons.  What's ""recommended"" and what's right are two different things. 2.5 gallons of water will make for a pretty unhappy fish."
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,Timlad,2,Tue Jul 7 22:38:52 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I have my betta in a 10 gallon, so I think 2.5 is a bit too small as well, but a 2.5 is way better than those teacup sized tanks they try to sell at petstores. If you want to keep a betta in a 20 gallon then more power to you, I'm sure your betta is quite happy, but making it sound like you need that much tank for a single betta is kind of silly in my opinion. (especially since most HOB filters for a tank that size probably make too much current for a betta) It is hard enough to sell people on a tank that's over a couple gallons as it is.  ¬†  A 20 gallon is more than enough for a betta sorority of six or seven fish in reality. We all know that the ""one gallon per inch"" rule of thumb isn't that accurate, but ten gallons per inch is a bit out there... unless you're talking about a goldfish of course. :P"
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,cheevocabra,0,Tue Jul 7 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sure 10 gallons is sufficient, I was just saying that 5, or 2.5 gallons wouldn't be a nice habitat for a betta, or any other fish really.  Maybe some cherry shrimp or a snail or two.    As for the current issue I have a canister filter and I just tilted the outtake valve up so it creates virtually no current at all, since betta fish do need low current environments.    My 20 gallon is home to many creatures.  Betta fish can get along with very few inhabitants, but a little research will show they do well with fully aquatic frogs, which I have 4 african dwarf frogs, 1 clown pleco, a ghost shrimp, and like 5 or 6 nitrite snails."
shutupandtakemymoney,3ce5lp,Timlad,0,Wed Jul 8 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I said the minimum that I'd put a betta in would be a five, but still not very ideal. I have my betta with two mystery snails (who are really awesome and have a lot of personality themselves) and I've kept them with pygmy corrys before and they got along great. I thought about trying dwarf frogs, but I've heard that they can be a little hard to keep because they get out competed or food easily, especially since bettas are usually such pigs."

shutupandtakemymoney,3bzi24,rmosler,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:39:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're completely wrong, but no hard feelings :)   Electrical capacity doesn't really have a concept of voltage. This pack can store and discharge 150Ah (Amps, which describe current and hours which describe time), which is a lot. USB voltage is 5VDC,and yeah, it's probably charging via the solar cell at a lower voltage, but the battery doesn't mind. In fact, it appreciates the gentle touch and will last longer.  Edit: looks like the actual capacity is 15Ah, which is still a lot, but normal for battery packs."
shutupandtakemymoney,3bzi24,wadel,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:01:37 2015 UTC,My understanding is that volts have amperage factored into them. So 150000mah at 3.7 v is not the same capacity when it gets output at 5 volts.
shutupandtakemymoney,3bzi24,rmosler,5,Sat Jul 4 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"You may be thinking about Power (Watts). Power is calculated by the voltage potential (Volts )  x the current (Amps); P=v x a.   The capacity listed here (like most batteries and primary cells) is listed in mAh (milliamp-hours).  15,000 milliamp-hours is equal to 15Amp-hours; equivalent to the charge transferred by a current of 15Amps for one hour.  This thing would not be able to drive 15Amps thermally (that's like the max load on a residential outlet, btw), but it has the charge capacity to do so if it were able. It's a common way to specify how much /juice/ something has specifically NOT to have to care about the voltage (and, correspondingly the Power) draw at the other end.  Most phones and other lithium-ion (and -poly) devices that this will be used for actually require 'conditioning' during the charge cycle by starting slowly and ramping cyclically, which greatly alters the power draws during the charge, making it impossible to list battery capacity in any unit which takes voltage into account.  Hence mAh."

shutupandtakemymoney,3bzi24,Rufus_T_Firefly_,7,Sat Jul 4 00:59:50 2015 UTC,This is a bit late but I purchased one that looked exactly like this on aliexpress. When I got it in the mail it was extremely light for being the advertised 50000mah (I thought the 150000mah was alittle farfetched) I charged it to full capacity and tried to charge my 3200mah LGG2 over night with it to see how it would compare. It only charged half way before it ran out of juice. So I figured the battery was only 1600mah and I got scammed by the Ali express seller. Well I thought you know if the solar power works it'll still be worth it. But when I left it in the sun the lights would blink indicating that it's charging but it never seemed to hold power. I left it in the sun for weeks.   Tl:Dr it doesn't hold as much as it says and the solar panel doesn't charge the phone. Don't waste your money

shutupandtakemymoney,3bzi24,Nicenightforawalk01,2,Fri Jul 3 20:04:51 2015 UTC,Yes the gas used is 'green' if you need. if you scroll down the page it gives a breakdown of what it is.

shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,AmberHeartsDisney,35,Thu Jul 2 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"I also got one on the Kickstarter.  They didn't reveal to us that it required constant buying of their proprietary ""food"" liquid until halfway through the manufacturing process and it's not even that impressive.  Shake it once, it slightly glows, shake it twice, almost nothing.  You also have to be very careful of where you put it.  Too close to the window, they'll die, too much shade, they die."

shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,OneEyedPlankton,22,Fri Jul 3 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"This was super disappointing in reality.  The seam between the two halves of the dino is really visible.  It will never be as bright as in that picture. Even when mine was brand new it wasn't.  After about 3 weeks I had, literally, only 5 tiny specks that would glow.  Ended up having to dump it. Got an email that there was a new and improved 'formula' for the food and the initial bacteria fill, but haven't ordered it."
shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,HugsAllCats,8,Thu Jul 2 21:56:50 2015 UTC,That makes me sad to read.
shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,Gillespee,7,Thu Jul 2 23:38:46 2015 UTC,I bought in on the kickstarter too and second everything said here.  The glow is gone BEFORE you stop shaking it.  There's no residual glow at all.  This is not a night light no matter how awesome it sounds on paper.
shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,thetinguy,2,Fri Jul 3 01:02:12 2015 UTC,it's never as bright as the picture because the picture was taken with a very high iso and a relatively long exposure time. pretty fraudulent imho.
shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,VodkaSodaSplashCran,12,Fri Jul 3 09:53:12 2015 UTC,I recently just got one. It's kinda neat but it's really just a plastic dinosaur shaped container and you have to continuously buy food for it every few months. I wish the container was glass so I didn't have to worry about the chemicals in the plastic seeping into the water and harming the micro organizisms.
shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,VodkaSodaSplashCran,3,Thu Jul 2 20:43:21 2015 UTC,I would think you could transfer it to a glass container but then you couldn't shake it.
shutupandtakemymoney,3bwhy3,dirty_hooker,8,Thu Jul 2 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, but then it wouldn't be in a dinosaur, unless I find a dinosaur shaped glass container."

Depending on your disposition, this might be the perfect reason to buy one of those glass skulls filled with rot gut vodka."

We gain ground in some of these battles, even taste victory once in a while, but we are still reminded of how many are at a standstill. It's really quite demoralizing sometimes, to be aware of how far we still have to go before we live in a utopian future of resolved problems.  Then someone brings up the ethics of shrimp.  Suddenly, I can take a break from the daunting task of processing the various injustices of the world that are slowly trickling into my consciousness. I can now look back on how far we have come, and how this enormous task list of moral/ethical dilemmas is shrinking so fast that the wellbeing of shrimp is actually manifesting itself as a recognized problem."

shutupandtakemymoney,3b1324,snowman334,2,Fri Jun 26 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"Don't put it in an air-tight container. seal it with saran wrap and elastic bands so gas can get out if the pressure builds up, but the water won't evaporate. Or put it in a bottle and loosen the cap every few days until no more air comes out.  Try making a few from different source and see if they produce different pigments. However, make sure to use sources where plants and animals are living in the water (doesn't have to be fish). If the water can't sustain animal and plant life then it is likely polluted and won't produce a good column.  Try supplementing one with an egg (great source of calcium and sulfur) and one without and see if they look different.  Try anything else you might think of; they're dirt cheap (get it?) to make so you can mess around and experiment to see what works best."

shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,pauljordan92,27,Wed Jun 24 15:11:33 2015 UTC,"Check out a brand called Musashi (site I went with)  They did an interesting thing a while back, knowing people wanted a katana they could use, but not have to pay $500+ for it. So they made a compromise: Stamp the blade like a cheap sword, but deferentially harden it like an expensive sword.  So you get a sword hard enough to keep a sharp edge, but you can stick it in a stump and bend it 40¬∞ and it'll return to perfectly straight. The reviews will tell you a $500 is better, but no sword is better for under $200. Most rank it as a practice sword, so it's meant for actual use and not just display like most ""1045 carbon steel"" shit."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,Dramatic_Explosion,6,Tue Jun 23 06:35:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for that link.  Might pick one up.  That's crazy that they sell San Mai sword for under 400.  You bought one of those 100 dollar 1060?  How is the quality on the handle and scabbard?
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,neotekz,8,Tue Jun 23 12:09:04 2015 UTC,"I bought one a long time ago for around $100, and it is fantastic. The scabbard is good quality, along with the rest of it. As long as you take care of it, it will last you a long time. The wood is a little delecate though, so you have to be gentle with it. They come very sharp as well. Would definately buy again.

shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,TelosVelox,2,Tue Jun 23 13:35:10 2015 UTC,"It's nothing fancy to keep the cost down, but it's more than functional. If you want, re-wrapping the handle with your own material (not the nylon it comes with) can be a step up, but it was really getting a $200-$300 blade for $100 that did it for me. Other than that, it all looks great including the glossy piano-black scabbard.  This is the one I got. Right when the line came out there was so much hype I ended up waiting about a year before it was back in stock."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,Dramatic_Explosion,3,Tue Jun 23 14:18:02 2015 UTC,Nice.  Thanks.  So you're saying the quality of these are as good as/better than the one's on the site OP posted?
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,MusicMagi,2,Tue Jun 23 12:48:12 2015 UTC,"Based on the blade selection vs. price, yes. There are a number of factors in overall quality, but the one up-front-and-center is the blade itself. If a blade is reeeeeeeealy hard, it keeps a sharp edge but is brittle. If the blade is soft, it's flexible enough to not break, but won't hold a sharp edge.  How do you get the best of both worlds? Differential or ""clay"" tempering. When tempering the sword they put clay down the spine of the blade, shielding it from the heat. This way, the blade-edge gets very hard (stays sharp) while the clay side stays soft (blade won't break easily). Using this method also gives you the Hamon (the squiggly tempering line) which is just stained onto cheaper swords.  On the site linked by OP, they don't offer a clay tempered blade until the +$250 range. (I just put together a replica of my blade on that site, and it's $444.99. Theirs probably is better overall quality, but mine is a functional practice sword for 1/4th the cost)."

shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,Cozy_Conditioning,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"mislabeling something   I don't understand what you're asking, so I'll just explain the quote in more detail. Musashi wanted to make a low-cost blade that didn't suck, so they skimped where they could. They used stamped blades to cut out the expensive and time consuming process of drawing and forming the blade, and jump straight to hand tempering and honing. They also save money in less essential areas, such as nylon cording.  Generally a $100 katana is display only and will break if used, and it's only in the $500+ range you get the really good stuff. Musashi offers a line for $100 that's in the $300-$400 quality range, and fully functional."

shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,TurtleTitan,17,Tue Jun 23 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, the folding is a double over method. Fold #1 = 1 Fold. Fold #2 = 2 Folds, Fold #3 = 4 folds, Fold #5 = 8 folds. At around #16 you reach it's limit. So going any higher will be like never folding it and starting all over.   I blame the 80's for all the horrible myths about these swords. The more you look into the samurai sword the more you find out they are actually not even good swords for it's time period.

Any situation where draw/cutting speed is more important than strength.   And no, these were not common weapons.   Bruhh samurai wore daisho. A katana and a wakizashi. They were military personal and did not walk around unarmed. Katana was overwhelmingly popular among the samurai class.   Physics. If you want something to help you better understand friction and force look up Hollow Ground vs a Wedge.   If the katana's blade was too fat to cut it wouldn't cut. What are you saying the blade's fatness causes? A katana is a better cutting weapon than a longsword or rapier but it is fatter."

On the battle field a naginata would be a superior choice. But in every day samurai life they carried Daisho, a pairing of the katana and shorter wakizashi. They were by no means mainly ceremonial. They were popular among the samurai class because of their combat situations among each other.

It is not meant to be optimal for battle field use use against steel armor like a European longsword. For it's time period (I'll say Edo, 1603-1873) katana were some of the best flesh cutting swords being produced."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,ThatAgnosticGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"If you look at how the katana was forged, it was already out of date with the reset of the world from day one due to the regions poor steel resources. After it was first forged, through out the years the katana changed very little if at all. Compare that to the constant changing of forging method, length, width, cross section, weight ... The sword was always evolving else where in the world through trial and error. Here is a cool video if you are into forging."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,DerHelm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see how their forging method makes it inferior if it doesn't hinder it's use. Japan could have gone through it's own path of trail and error before settling on folding and differential clay hardening. Edo period katana were very good cutting blades for samurai culture regardless of their forging method. Much of it's success as a cutting blade is exactly because of that. It was optimized for situations that samurai culture created. Largely unarmored, and needed motions combining drawing and striking in one.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxp7HqgCLZM   After it was first forged, through out the years the katana changed very little if at all.    From ancient Japan until WWII nihoto, specifically the katana, have under gone pretty significant changes. Nihoto evolve as well, there is more to smithing than just for folding aspect Japan decided to keep."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,ThatAgnosticGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"Forging is everything. It's the reason the katana is so limited.  If you watched the video I posted you will see how a dull un-sharpened European sword cut through a straw mat just as easy. A thinner blade mean less force is needed and a stronger blade I should not have to explain.  As I said ""After it was first forged, through out the years the katana changed very little if at all. "" and the link you posted shows that. Your link shows aprox 9 changes from 900 AD to the 1900s. That is extreme very little change."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,DerHelm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:41:53 2015 UTC,"Just because it's limited doesn't mean it's worse. The properties of a katana were shaped following samurai culture. In that environment kenjutsu, iaijutsu, and it's tools are more fit. On a battle field with armour where a European longsword could be used primarily, samurai would prefer naginata, yari, yumi, etc. So yah a viking weapon would be superior there but when draw speed or succesive cutting comes into play a wazizashi or katana would outclass it.    If you watched the video I posted you will see how a dull un-sharpened European sword cut through a straw mat just as easy.   A katana is still a better cutting blade. It is curved, lighter, and katana employ yaki-ire and which longswords usually did not. When I said what does the forging method have to do with anything, I meant how the Japanese using folding methods suddenly renders them out dated from the rest of the world.   My link just shows clear periods sword shape over 900 to 1900.   . Rather the changes were trends which took, in most cases, many years to develop, therefore numerous variations and intermediate styles are found.   There were more than 9 changes. That's just broken into clear distinct periods of time.    A thinner blade mean less force is needed and a stronger blade I should not have to explain.   It definitely takes less force to cut cleanly through flesh with a katana than it is with a European longsword. Katana was forged to cut. It is curved and single edged."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,ThatAgnosticGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"You need to remain objective.    The properties of a katana were shaped following samurai culture. In that environment kenjutsu, iaijutsu, and it's tools are more fit.    This says nothing about how good the the katana is against other swords. All you are saying is that this is the best sword Japan could make, and I agree with you.  You keep saying you don't understand why a fat blade is bad but you are answering you own question when you keep mention that the blade is curved. You are changing the blade angle so it's not going into the katana, but rather along it's edge. This should tell you that is it not a good cutting weapon and more suitable for slashing.  In the 70 the new aged movement cause people, some of whom to this day to still believe that crystals have healing powers.  The Anti Vac movement cause people, some of whom to this day to believe immunization causes Autism.  In the 80's all the way to taday, horribly written TV and movies that evolved katana and ninja cause people, some of whom to this day to believe that a katana is some magical, super powerful, end all weapon that could do things no other weapon of it's time could do.   Don't get me wrong, if you are asking if a katana can cut a bullet in half. the answer is, YES!  But, so can a plain butter knife.  But if you want a more profession answer on the subject. This guy knows more than you and I.  I hope you watch his video, she has a ton of them on other weapons too."
shutupandtakemymoney,3arhuj,DerHelm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"This says nothing about how good the the katana is against other swords.   Yes it does. It tells that that I would rather use a katana to make a clean, swift cut(s) as opposed to a sword forged in conditions with steel armor.    You keep saying you don't understand why a fat blade is bad but you are answering you own question when you keep mention that the blade is curved. You are changing the blade angle so it's not going into the katana, but rather along it's edge. This should tell you that is it not a good cutting weapon and more suitable for slashing.   Maybe on paper that would say it is a bad cutting weapon but in practice it does not hold through. The katana is a superb cutting weapon. Watch some tameshigiri videos and you can see that. Blade fatness may be an issue when cutting armor, but that's not the katana's purpose. It cuts flesh. This cutting vs slashing thing I don't see much significance in the terminology because a katana does both very well.    But if you want a more profession answer on the subject. This guy knows more than you and I.  I hope you watch his video, she has a ton of them on other weapons too.   This guy most definitely doesn't look or sound like a professional.  This guy sounds like he does't know much about japanese smithing and craftmanship. He completely and deliberately downplays the sword. ""Cut someone in two if you hit them hard enough."" He says it's a ""last resort weapon"" which sounds pretty stupid when you consider for samurai not at war it was a weapon of first resort. He says the katana was stuck with one shape but that is false as well. Nihoto have a long history of change. The katana did not stay stagnant. Everything he says that varied in European swords over time, ""longer, shorter, more curve, less curve, more tapered, different construction methods"" the katana experienced as well. He says the Japanese ""found perfection and stuck with it."" That's completely false. Lamentation techniques  for one have insane variation in Japanese sword smithing. European swords had using one hardness throughout the blade, so I could say that those show little evolution there. This guy says the fat blade is an issue with cutting steal which I can understand. But not with an unarmored combatant. That's who the katana was crafted for. In feudal Japan, European longswords and their schools would see themselves much slower off the draw."

I just mocked up the most expensive sword at just shy of $800. Folded 1095 is no display sword imo.

So basically, for $10 you can get 20 collars instead of one for $14.99. The rest you can give away for Christmas or as nice presents for your dog owner friends."

shutupandtakemymoney,3ak34w,mookieprime,2,Sun Jun 21 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"My dog and I run most nights, and he always knows it's time to go when I strap on his light up green collar.

shutupandtakemymoney,3ak34w,endersg,2,Sun Jun 21 11:22:30 2015 UTC,I have tried about 4 different types of these.   The lesson I learned is don't hook your leash up to these.   Any minor pulling puts strain on the water electronics and causes them to fail. Use a separate collar.
shutupandtakemymoney,3ak34w,dirtyultraface,2,Sun Jun 21 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"Or you could just get one of these, and put it on whatever collar you like. I use this with my dog, and it works great."

However, when my dog does get wet, she doesn't like to submerge herself too much, so I can't say much about that.  As for the pressure, it's never been too big of a problem for me, and I've never had a problem with them not illuminating enough for me to see her, even when the light is shining from behind her. That would also be a problem with the collar in the OP though too. I was just posting this as a cheap alternative that's worked well for me in the past."

The handle is a round ""stick"" with nothing to brace it against pressure other than a person's inefficient grip. This is compounded when handling delicious fatty meats & getting your hands a little greasy.  Were there a piece that made it brace against your wrist, it would more efficiently transfer your force without grip required by greasy palms even being a factor.

A rake style shredder works far more efficiently, and will shred a LOT more meat before fatigue sets in.

I'm not referring to generating substantial force. Sorry you didn't understand that. I'm talking about as you are using these to generate force, they are relying on your grip (with greasy hands) instead of mechanical support to stay in place.

The trick for me was to keep one claw stationary while using the other to pull away.  At first I was trying to pull away with both claws but it wasn't going as fast."

Edit 2: I asked Maria (the lead inventor) to get me in contact with a previous buyer with his/her permission -she said she'll do her best. Maybe some closure by night time.  Edit: here is the inventor's explanation  Edit 3: I've managed to get in contact with one purchaser named Robert Huxley, he's willing to send in his shirt to a tech reviewer   Edit 4: UPDATE: My order arrived - I live in Vancouver, Canada and the shipping address is from Edmonton (probably why they let me expedite shipping). It's sunny/cloudy here, will test out in a few minutes. So far, so good. If you live in the area and review tech, let's meet up!  EDIT: REVIEW: Okay, it works. Caveat - it's more of a cool sensation than being fanned. Like the feeling when you walk into an air-conditioned building after being in the heat. I wouldn't call it a breeze. It's just like being cool. I don't know the lifespan of the shirt but I can feel the fibers if I sit back in a chair too hard. I will give it a wash tonight. There's definitely something other than cotton or regular fabrics in the shirt.  Also a disclaimer it's not too hot or fully sunny where I am so my experience may be a bit skewed.   It took a while to start working, it kind of creeps up on you but you acclamate pretty fast. If they had a whole outfit it would be 10x better because I could notice the difference between my core and my face temperature, maybe I was trying too hard to notice it. Overall, it's not a bad purchase if you live somewhere super hot, I don't. Might take it on vacations to Cali. It's unnecessary in VanCity.   EDIT: It washed well. Sorry for the late update, I forgot."

shutupandtakemymoney,39b1g4,Use0nceDestroy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"Well, industrial screen printing dryers (huge machine with long conveyor belt, it's basically an oven with a conveyor belt) must get that hot for the ink to permanently ""cure"" on the shirt.  This is why the ink stays on your screen printed tees even though it's been through the wash.  If the ink comes off that means it didn't hit cure temperature at least not for long enough."

shutupandtakemymoney,39bn8b,damnshoes,6,Thu Jun 11 17:16:59 2015 UTC,I remember reading an article in popular science years ago about alternative things to do with your remains. One of them was to be flash frozen and put into a vacuum chamber and have all the water removed from your body. Then they'd put you in some kind of shaker and without the water you'd turn to dust. Then they'd bury you in a corn starch box. It was supposed to preserve more nutrients for plants to grow. At least that's what I remember. There was another method mentioned in the article where they could take your remains and turn you into a diamond and become a family heirloom. Kinda creepy if you ask me Edit : found the article http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2006-02/fyi-life-gems

shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,SonaStyle,10,Wed Jun 10 13:47:31 2015 UTC,There are really no reviews of this device. Can someone chip in with experience.
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,SabashChandraBose,8,Wed Jun 10 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"I picked up one from TinyDeal 5 months ago. You get what you pay for. It isn't going to replace a FitBit. If you are not a hardcore runner and just curious then it's OK. When I first got the band the battery life was not that great (3-4 days between charges). After updating the app/firmware (I'm using Android) from here, it's been 25 days since charging and the device is at 66%.  The sleep tracking actually is pretty accurate most of the time. Some nights it is off though. The same can be said about the step counting.  Again, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles a FitBit has, but for the price it's alright for the curious."
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,Dspradau,3,Wed Jun 10 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"So it's basically a step counter and a sleep tracker. I am not bothered by the steps, though I am interested in sleep tracking. How is the data is viewed/shared? I am running Lollipop. Is it compatible?"
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,SabashChandraBose,3,Wed Jun 10 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. All the data is accessible from the application itself. I'm not running Lollipop (on 4.4.4) so I can't confirm that it is compatible. I would recommend checking out /r/miband though. I'm sure you could find more information over there."
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,Dspradau,5,Wed Jun 10 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"I got it from TinyDeal (~$37 with shipping) with the sole intention of keeping my Android Lollipop device unlocked and it works great. I slip it into the little change pocket in my jeans. You can install this custom version of the app and it will still track all your steps/sleep but also vibrate when you get notifications with customizable LED colors, number of flashes, and number of vibrations for each app including alarms if you want to set it to silent (but it can be buggy so I wouldn't rely on it completely).  The battery lasts for ~40 days of almost daily use and one time spent about 10-20 minutes in the dryer at full heat and is totally fine, never submerged it in water but it been wet with no problems. When you create an account it requires a phone number (I used Google Voice) and everything is saved in the app's cloud.  edit: When we got it on TinyDeal a friend also ordered a car ionizer that turned out to only be an LED inside and a flash drive with a mic but the SD memory was spoofed so it didn't actually record anything (we got full refunds without hassle). However this MiBand was exactly what it said it was and for my purposes has been great. Any bluetooth device will keep Lollipop unlocked but not many devices would be as small, durable, or have a long lasting battery as this turned out to be."
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,ThePointed,2,Wed Jun 10 15:40:22 2015 UTC,How accurate is the sleep data? Can you show me a snapshot of what a night's log would look like?
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,SabashChandraBose,4,Wed Jun 10 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"Imgur album  I only used it a couple times earlier this year, and as you can see it's averaged out the old results, but it seems to be comparable to the Sleep Better app on my phone which only saves the data locally. When you set it down it goes into a ""deep sleep"" mode so it doesn't muddle the data. I can use it again tonight and PM you the results."
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,ThePointed,2,Wed Jun 10 16:11:18 2015 UTC,That'd be nice. I am really interested in sleep tracking.
shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,SabashChandraBose,2,Wed Jun 10 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"https://imgur.com/a/8scxd  First image is the unofficial MiBand Notifications app I linked to. It lets you edit the time you went to sleep/woke up to improve accuracy. Second is the Sleep Better app, I changed the MiBand times to match. As you can see it's pretty much exactly the same but Sleep Better puts those red spikes in, I'm not sure if that means I twitch or run in my sleep, but it screws with my overall percentage because it thinks I'm wide awake.  Sleep Better has more features but no way to automatically backup/restore the data if the app gets deleted only manually copying the folder to storage and MiBand backs everything up to it's own cloud. Neither have an export option. If I share to say Google Drive both apps publish something like ""I slept for X hours which is X% efficient!"", no metrics, mood, dreams, etc. So for a free app and a <$20 device you're getting the bare minimum, but if you like entering the data into your own tracker or saving screenshots it's completely sufficient. Devices like the Microsoft Band are $200 because of their back-end services.  Hopefully this is the info you were looking for."

shutupandtakemymoney,39ap7r,kiplinght,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"I had one for about a month before the beacon piece slipped out of the band and was lost. It's great! Besides that fatal design flaw.. If you wear it anywhere you might bump your wrist on something, example being I am an overnight stocker, its going to fall out and you will not even notice until its way too late. I imagine if you only put it on to sleep and run you should be okay, but I wanted to wear it 24/7. It wasn't a defective band either, it was a very snug fit and I did not believe it would be a problem with it falling out, but I bumped it the wrong way one day I guess and it was gone. Also, it takes something like a month to get to you from overseas if you are in the US. Vendors with reasonable shipping time charge more for it."

shutupandtakemymoney,388ylw,kwalterb,18,Tue Jun 2 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"These are simple carbon filters you can buy at home depot for twenty bucks. There's a lot of info about stealth growing you can learn from the internet. Thousands of people have been refining the art for decades now, sharing their info, and I've no doubt you can save $600 off this price by doing it yourself.  I haven't looked into this for at least a decade, but I'd suggest people check out /r/spacebuckets for some info on techniques.  No matter what ""kit"" you buy, reading up on things is still 100% necessary, and if you do read up on things, you'll find out there's absolutely nothing special about this kit. You can do this yourself for like a hundred bucks."

This company is no doubt just a guy who built his own from home depot parts for long enough he decided to go into business selling them. This appears to still be all DIY-grade parts, and you should be achieve the same level of smell-elimination with a little research and some cheapass home depot parts.  I'm certain those are just regular activated charcoal filters, which do eliminate most smell, but probably not all."

Sea of Green or SCreen of Green methods would lead to maximum yields, for the given lateral/horizontal dimensions. Years (and, sadly, even more years) ago, I did an excellent standalone-closet grow, my first SCROG set up, and I had far more than I either expected or could deal with.  This may be a bit too small, but if I lived in a different location, I'd at least try to give it a shot (assuming I had 4 months to spare and a free set up)."

shutupandtakemymoney,388ylw,EkoostikAdam,2,Tue Jun 2 22:57:42 2015 UTC,"Hear me out (or don't, hehe) - CFL lights aren't that bad, if you cater to their weaknesses / strengths, and use something like the SoG or SCRoG methods, as you don't have to worry about CFL lights' diminished penetration abilities.  There are higher-powered CFLs out there, I have a few left over, and I now use them in my garage, cuz standard CFLs tend to suck in that space.  I have some that are each equivalent to 150W.  I'll tell you, lack of penetration can quickly be defeated by having the equivalent of 450W of light in a small space.  This kind of box, (setting aside the astronomical cost) would also be perfect for germination.  Note: If you know SoG / SCRoG - skip to next paragraph, if not - If you're not sure what SoG (Sea of Green) or SCRoG (Screen of Green) methods are - they are basically a method of just getting a top layer of buds, but over a larger lateral area.  I personally prefer SCRoG, because you can force each shoot to grow almost exactly where you want, ensuring maximum latera-area coverage.  Some people use chicken wire, custom string rigs - I ended up just cutting a grid out of the lid of a Rubbermaid container, giving me a surprisingly strong mesh, and the lid just sat right on top of my nutrients basin.  Being a ""lid"" made it really easy to open/close/lift the screen to add nutes,peroxide, check roots, check my bubblers, check PPMs, etc.  Back to CFLs.  When I used to grow in small spaces, (can't grow anymore, I'm finally legal, and my country eliminated the ""grow your own"" clause, so I'm not going to risk a good thing until that law is stricken down via a currently ongoing court challenge), I'd most often use them to light the sides/underbellies of my ladies (when not using SoG/SCRoG, because the CFL's heat efficiency allowed you to put the bulbs right up close, unlike with HPS/MH bulbs), or, to supplement the HPS/MH lights.    I did a whole grow with just CFLs once, and was surprised by the results.  The buds were certainly less dense (wispy), but they were always just for me, and there was zero difference in smokeability / enjoyment.  Also, I was able to grow in much smaller spaces.  The cool part of the grow (hehe) was that that I didn't always have to worry about the heat in a small enclosure.  CFLs are what they are - efficient.  What I'd do here is, (after ditching their CFLs and using my own higher-powered ones - as high powered as I can find that would keep me within acceptable heat ranges):  Germination:  Use a box / riser on which I'd place my babies, and have them right up close to the light.  Veg:  Drop the box / riser down about half-way, train using the screen, rotating the nutes container every day or couple of days.  Ensure ladies are as close to light as possible, and train train train those shoots through the proper spots in the screen.  If growth is slow, augment with custom/ghetto C02 machine (pop bottle, yeast, sugar, breather tubes - fun to make).  Flower:  Remove completely the box / riser, leaving me with the most usable space.  Let SCRoG do its thing.  If ladies grow too tall during flower, drop light schedule down lower than 12/12.  If buds aren't growing fast/big/dense enough, increase ghettoC02 output (bigger pop bottle, more yeast/sugar).  You could also cut out the bottom of the rig, so the nutes bucket sits right at the bottom.  Cut out hole in desk top, bucket goes down into that hole - and grow rig just looks like a computer sitting on a desk.  Growing in small spaces is bordering on an art form.  It leads to very creative solutions.  For my old space, that computer case would be about 1/3 the height, and 1/3 the depth (it was a schrank-style closet - something like this, but only about 2/3 as wide."
shutupandtakemymoney,388ylw,baldchow,2,Wed Jun 3 14:00:34 2015 UTC,"That's a very well thought at response.  I know of the sea of green technique from back of the day, but this is the first time I've heard mention of screen of green.  I'm just not sure if this amount of space would make for plants in which the yield would make the time and money invested worth it, which i think you also commented on.  It does, however, seem like a pretty fun hobby project.  It sure would be nice not to have to worry about heat.  I'm wondering if an LED would be a good solution in this situation, though I know you pay a LOT more for a lot less light."

It could work - but that's a LOT of time and money to find out.  If you REALLY have to grow, and you REALLY have to do it stealth - and you REALLY can't build your own custom, light-proof cabinet (for way cheaper) .... then ... this is the way to ... Nope.  really - it's just too fucking expensive.  The more I think about it, the more I remind myself of the other options available.  It would be cool to have one given to me for free to see what I can do with it, but I sure wouldn't want to be both wrong and out $700 in the process.  Hey - have a great day, man."

Don't know how much the ""filter"" would be but I'm gonna assume it doesn't really work as well as they say.

shutupandtakemymoney,384c0l,g0zer13,14,Mon Jun 1 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"In the United States the law that regulates the possession and or capture of any migratory bird and is called the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This law specifically includes hummingbirds in the list of Migratory Birds that are protected under the United States Code of Federal Regulations.  Basically, it is illegal in the United States to hold a hummingbird, a hummingbird nest, a hummingbird baby, or any part of a hummingbird, nest, or egg, in any type of captivity in any way, shape, or form. This means that unless you have a valid permit, it is illegal to trap, band, hold, harass, or control any hummingbird or any part of the hummingbird, nest, or egg.  Shorter answer: You can look, but don't touch.  If someone is caught violating this law, the hummingbird will be taken away immediately and there is a fine of anywhere between $15,000 (fifteen thousand) and $200,000 (two hundred thousand) US dollars.

shutupandtakemymoney,37q200,jenfoolery,13,Fri May 29 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, the biggest cost involved is not the 3D printing but the acquisition of casting/reproduction rights on the specimens.  The company I work with had to pay lot of money to acquire the catalog of 3D scans and the rights to reproduce them.  It's also not a cheap resin based 3D print job.  It's using a full color, ""sand stone"" 3D printing which produces a far more realistic looking model but is many times more expensive.  These aren't toys, but rather museum quality, miniature reproductions of the actual fossils.  Many of the other 3D models I've seen are far less detailed and not actually based on the fossil itself, but rather an artists interpretation of the skull.  We'll be able to have everything up to full-size, mounted reproductions produced in the future, though with the current cost of 3D printing technologies they are not cheap."

I don't recall anything specific, but a lot of the pieces had a small placard with a couple sentences or paragraphs written by Bill Watterson, describing this or that aspect of the art or the time period.

shutupandtakemymoney,37mpgq,wiggles747,1 point,Fri May 29 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"This is an excerpt of an amazon comment. It is regarding the content of the book:  ""This new book from Andrews McMeel Publishing is a breakthrough for the hungry Calvin and Hobbes fan. Exploring Calvin and Hobbes: An Exhibition Catalogue begins with an extended interview with the man who curated a recent exhibit of Calvin and Hobbes strips at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum. In this interview, Watterson discusses his childhood, how he became interested in cartooning, his various attempts to break into the industry, and how the production of Calvin and Hobbes took place for its decade-long run.  The second section contains ink on paper samples of some of the cartoonists and illustrators that influenced Watterson. These samples were chosen and annotated by Watterson himself. Next, there are samples of Watterson‚Äôs early efforts at editorial cartooning and submissions to syndicates that never made it to press. Finally, the collection includes many pages of samples of published cartoons from the strip‚Äôs epic run. These are original, ink on paper drawings that sometimes have whiteout, pencil marks, and even scotch tape visible. The final portion of the collections was selected by Jenny Robb, who is an associate professor at Ohio State University and a curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum. They reflect her choice of some of the best and most representative strips that Watterson created."""

shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,bejean,2,Thu May 28 13:51:10 2015 UTC,We don't currently have a bimonthly option. Interesting to know that so many people would like this - we'll have to look into it. Just curious... would you be okay with skipping half the countries?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,nanalayo,2,Thu May 28 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, I'm surprised that so many people also wanted a bimonthly option, too. My thought process was that one $25 box is a better value than two $13 boxes.  The obvious downside of skipping a country didn't occur to me until you pointed out, because I'm used to subscription services delivering the same package month after month, sort of like Amazon Subscriptions as opposed to Times Magazine.  Even though I suggested the $25 bimonthly option, I think I'll subscribe to $13 a month option instead."

shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,aooga12,72,Thu May 28 12:42:22 2015 UTC,"Good question! Here are some reasons why we're better:   We provide smaller sizes of many different items. This lets you try lots of new foods without having to buy a big bag of something you might not enjoy. Oftentimes it is difficult to tell what you're looking at, unless you already know what the product is (especially outside of Europe). We provide detailed descriptions of each of the items so you know what you're eating. We also include a bunch of interesting facts about the country and each of the items. Since we are selling to the US market, we pick out products that we think people in the US will enjoy. We still include more authentic items like salty licorice from Finland, but we won't send you dried catfish from Japan.   Also, it's great that you have a grocery store with an awesome international section. Lots of people don't have that and have to either go to a ethnic grocery or order online."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,aooga12,42,Wed May 27 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"What if I do want the dried catfish from Japan? It sounds pretty good to me. Do you offer an ""Adventurous"" mode?"

Snacks that are made by big companies like Pepsico or Nestle can be tough, because they won't import their own products overseas. That means that they won't be labeled properly for the US, so whoever imports them has to apply labels to every single product. This gets expensive, so importers are less likely to stock those items unless there is a big demand. I'll keep an eye out for them, though!"

shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,markender,2,Thu May 28 20:20:05 2015 UTC,thats super awesome and I know i probably spend more than 25$ a month on snacks and what not as it is.. but my brain cant help but think of this as another monthly bill and wont let me buy it :(
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,holypiefatman,4,Fri May 29 18:03:29 2015 UTC,"maybe try it for one month and see how you feel about it? i've done that with a couple boxes. some of them became subscriptions, and others didn't"
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,holypiefatman,2,Thu May 28 03:32:51 2015 UTC,Are kinder eggs in any of the boxes?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,omnominous,2,Thu May 28 11:49:55 2015 UTC,Is there a sub for subscription boxes?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,40ozkiller,3,Thu May 28 04:04:54 2015 UTC,/r/SubscriptionBoxes
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,40ozkiller,2,Thu May 28 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"This is really cool! I love subscription boxes, especially ones that are for consumables. I had one for cosmetics for a year, and it was my favourite. I also had one for snacks, and it was pretty cool.  Just wondering if you're considering having a store section to buy snacks from older boxes? Or maybe have a ""create your own"" box where people could choose from those items and fill a box for a flat price? (more than the price of a regular box)"
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,TjallingOtter,2,Thu May 28 11:53:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We have strongly considered both of those ideas. We are planning to offer past boxes, but are still figuring out how to offer them at an affordable price while making sure the chocolate doesn't melt during shipping (thermal packaging is expensive)."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,telesterion,1 point,Thu May 28 11:34:21 2015 UTC,"maybe just make the chocolate unshippable for the hotter months? just take them off the offers during the summer, and put them back on in the fall."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,omnominous,4,Thu May 28 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"So I was a subscriber to Munchpak for like 3 or 4 months. How much different is your sub box of goodies and snacks different from Munchpak?  I liked Munchpak but when they started sending fish and meat flavored items in my box after paying not to have them in there, i cancelled."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,3sheeting,2,Thu May 28 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"A few key differences:   We feature a single country each month whereas Munchpak always sends an assortment of ""random"" snacks. Munchpak also includes lots of snacks from the US, whereas we only send international snacks. We include an information card describing each snack, as well as fun facts about the featured country.   Hope that helps!"
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,Fisionate,1 point,Thu May 28 01:17:56 2015 UTC,I appreciate the response. It actually sounds like your sub box is a better fit for me. Maybe I'll subscribe for the June box. Could you tell me what Junes box is going to be or is that top secret info?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,FAHQRudy,3,Thu May 28 20:24:16 2015 UTC,Great to hear. We announced it on our FB page so it is no longer top secret - it's Mexico.
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,danielbelum,2,Thu May 28 21:20:59 2015 UTC,Is Ethiopia on the list?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,Beatrix_BB_Kiddo,6,Thu May 28 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe someday, but there are very few Ethiopian food products imported into the US right now."

shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,skippyfa,2,Wed May 27 17:15:24 2015 UTC,The site says 13 or more snacks in each box and the first two months in the history section had 12 and 10 snacks listed- what gives?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,castironpuppet,8,Wed May 27 18:36:41 2015 UTC,"Each box contains 13 or more items, but we include more than one of some of the snacks. We try to include enough so that 4 people could try each item. The amount of individually wrapped items actually varies a ton (the China box had over 40), but the size of the box stays the same each month."

shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,FurriesRuinEverythin,2,Wed May 27 22:54:17 2015 UTC,Any planned boxes for vegetarians?
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,pedrobeara,7,Thu May 28 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"All of our boxes thus far have not included any meat products. Importing products containing meat is a real nightmare, so we don't plan to include anything non-vegetarian anytime soon."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,lilnas313,10,Wed May 27 19:15:39 2015 UTC,He/She may have meant the fact that gelatin is an animal product.
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,CalexaRose,6,Wed May 27 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"Ah. I am not super-informed on these matters but wouldn't that only be an issue if you were vegan? And to preemptively answer that, we are not currently set up to accommodate individual customizations of the snacks."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,pedrobeara,7,Wed May 27 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"One thing that could be helpful is listing the contents of the next box somewhere (with ingredients, like you do for past boxes). That way, people could decide whether or not to get the next box if they are vegetarian, have a food allergy, etc. The biggest thing keeping me from ordering a box is the uncertainty about whether I'd actually be able to eat everything that came in it.  Also, regarding vegetarian/vegan: Many vegetarians, even if they aren't vegan, won't eat gelatin because an animal has to die for it to be produced (unlike other vegetarian but not vegan animal products, like milk)."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,CalexaRose,2,Wed May 27 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"Gelatin is made from the meat/bones of animals. Not really a by-product in the same way as dairy & eggs. Some vegetarians don't mind it, some do. It depends on how strict they follow."
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,pedrobeara,7,Wed May 27 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"Gelatin is the issue here, among various other additives extracted from animals. Some people won't eat cochineal (red food colouring), as it is made out of bugs, or castoreum (vanilla flavoring) which comes from the anal glands of beavers, and many other examples... But I eat it all, so you've gotta hurry up and organise deliveries to Europe! I'm waiting for my bug and bum juice bonbons!"
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,CalexaRose,6,Thu May 28 14:39:35 2015 UTC,Castoreum is actually usually made in a lab since beaver anal glands are way too expensive.
shutupandtakemymoney,37gzq2,pedrobeara,2,Wed May 27 20:35:17 2015 UTC,Well I'm certainly glad to hear that.  It's taken me a few years to be okay with the ground up beetles and boiled cartilage.

It's a pen with a fine pipette on the business end.  It lets you  apply just a droplet right where you want it.  Then hit it with a dose of uv - sunlight or one of the uv flashlights Amazon sells - and the droplet bonds.  I would've just bought the refill if I'd known my uv LED flashlight worked with it.  But 'weld' is hyperbole.  It's just a resin like any other epoxy."

shutupandtakemymoney,37axz2,junpers,3,Tue May 26 07:46:16 2015 UTC,"Just as a heads up~ Most current Digital Thermometers have absolutely horrible build quality. Last year we tested 6-7 digital thermometers- Included a few from the Local Cabelas/Target, and two high dollar ones from Bunzl Processing (Commercial Equip- One was $250, the other a bit higher)   They were all the same for the first week or two- All calibrated within a few degrees. 5 months down the road they are all shit. Absolute shit. The $300 unit went just as fast as the $30 Target unit.  After 5 months none of the digital thermometers were within 10 degrees @100F. We only buy long stem dial type ones now, I'll never waste $10 on a handheld again.   -- This is $9 and lasts about a year before it gets a few degrees off. Even after 2-3 years these will read closer than a brand new digital. Its obviously not as convenient as a wireless digital, but the joke around here is our index finger is a better judge of temp than the handheld =)  TL:DR we dropped $500-600 ourselves trying to make our weekend smoking/cookouts more convenient- They are more or less a sham. Save your money if you are cooking anything other than vegetables."

And I like the pirate version concept. Are the cards different between the two games or is it just the pirate hats that makes it different?

shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,crusty_undewear,2,Fri May 22 16:54:29 2015 UTC,We have a 70s  model with a 3 speed suicide shifter and a 2000s model they are awesome and can go anywhere. Only down fall is there slow but they will slowly climb anything.
shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,theking82,2,Fri May 22 18:54:14 2015 UTC,3 speed suicide shifter   why do they call it that?

shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,satisfyinghump,2,Tue May 26 21:36:52 2015 UTC,The shift lever comes up on the side of the engine so you have to take your hand off the handle bars to shift. It was an old school teem for motorcycles to describe this type of shifter as they were going do the road and shifting at high speeds with one hand on the bars.
shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,theking82,1 point,Sun May 24 02:13:16 2015 UTC,thank you
shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,satisfyinghump,10,Tue May 26 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"I live in a mountainous area of the Philippines, the second I read about this I wanted one.  Until I found out I could buy three 10hp diesel mini tractor/trucks AND two 220cc dirt bikes for about the same amount of money.  That price seems excessive for a simple tube steel framed machine with a 7 HP motor."
shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,nebuchadrezzar,13,Fri May 22 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"I was looking into buying one of these, but after comparing it to other stuff in the same price range ($6500+), I just couldn't justify spending that much for what you get. The upper end one is fucking $10,000. That's fully loaded ATV money. You also can't finance them, like you can work almost every other powersports toy. They're neat bikes, but the components are pretty crappy for what they're asking. The engines are junk, that high of a price and they throw a Chinese Briggs clone in it, not a Honda or Kohler. They're pretty fun to ride, but the novelty wears off fairly quickly. Also super slow."
shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,shitterplug,13,Fri May 22 20:25:26 2015 UTC,Exactly. For 10k  you could get a nice new motorcycle..or even a nice new atv  or side by side. Or hell 2 or 3 used atvs.

shutupandtakemymoney,36w0h7,argentcorvid,2,Fri May 22 22:37:08 2015 UTC,No but for the price point I'm sure there is many other options that are just as if not better.

shutupandtakemymoney,36ecsw,mysexyknowsnolimits,9,Mon May 18 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"HeroClix is decent quality for what it is. I've been buying cheap little 1$ HeroClix minis and clipping the bases to use them for Pathfinder minis. I even took a Joker and chopped it up and turned it into a decent kitbash, mixing it with Deadeye Slim from Reaper."

shutupandtakemymoney,36ecsw,Vinnie_Vegas,19,Tue May 19 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"HeroClix is a miniatures tactics game.  The minis range from movies to comic books to video games, and look something like this, varying in quality from ""shit"" to ""decent enough"".  Pathfinder is the current most popular roleplaying game, created after Wizards of the Coast decided to a) not continue the same laissez-faire open gaming license of 3.5 edition into 4e, and b) decided not to let their biggest second party publisher get inside knowledge about the upcoming 4th edition; Paizo broke away and decided to expand on the OGL made Pathfinder setting, creating an offshoot that many affectionately or derisively have called ""D&D 3.75""  As a roleplaying game with a heavy focus on map based tactical combat, Pathfinder is often played with miniatures.  The Joker is a Batman villain that has (several iterations of) HeroClix minis.  Deadeye Slim is a character from the Bones series of cheap miniatures from Reaper.  I took The Joker, popped him off the base, popped the legs off from the hips, glued them on at a different angle, cut both arms and the head off, glued them at a different angle, lost the left harm, cut one of Deadeye Slim's off and used that, put a thin nail through the top of the Joker's head and glued it on at a different angle, used bolt cutters and fingernail clippers to cut off the top third of the Joker's head, cut Deadeye Slim's hat off since I was going to be taking his arm anyway, clipped the cowboy hat into a tricorn shape, clipped the left side and glued it on sideways so it looked folded up, clipped a piece of his coat off and glued it as a sort of feather, put a broken triangle of a base on the Joker's hip as a sheathe (even though he still has the little dagger he came with), and then glued it to a watch battery and primed the whole thing white, since one arm and the hat were already white. I unfortunately can't find the pictures I took, and I'm way too lazy to take more."
shutupandtakemymoney,36ecsw,Aspel,10,Tue May 19 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"Wow... You uh... Really went to great lengths to ensure that I understand your very, very niche hobby.   I must say I'm kind of impressed with that."
shutupandtakemymoney,36ecsw,Vinnie_Vegas,5,Tue May 19 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"We‚Äôre not talking Monopoly money here, either. ICv2, a site dedicated to hobby gaming (defined as titles sold primarily via the hobby channel of game and card specialty stores), reports that shoppers in the U.S. and Canada spent $700 million on hobby games in 2013, up 20 percent year-over-year and almost double the totals of 2008. The collectible-games category (properties like Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh!) leads the charge, with 2013 retail sales of $450 million; miniatures (including Warhammer 40,000 and Hordes) are nextat $125 million, followed by board games at $75 million, card and dice games at $35 million and role-playing games at $15 million. [source]   It's not 100 billion dollar video game industry, or the 88 billion dollar movie industry, but a decent $15 million is not what I'd call ""niche"". Plus, you seemed confused, so I elaborated."
shutupandtakemymoney,36ecsw,Aspel,5,Tue May 19 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"a decent $15 million is not what I'd call ""niche"".    Well;   A) I would call that incredibly niche, if you look at the overall recreation, leisure and entertainment market as a single entity. You're spending your free time doing this, meaning that it's essentially competing with sports, movies, television, music and anything else you could choose to do with your time. In that scheme, role playing games are incredibly niche.  B) I actually wasn't talking about the entire industry as a niche hobby in this instance - I was more referring to your specific method of customising your own pieces, which I imagine is niche even within the RPG world, right?"
shutupandtakemymoney,36ecsw,Vinnie_Vegas,3,Tue May 19 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"Eh. It's niche only because it's time consuming. Technically, most of the model based stuff--like Warhammer, Warmachine, and Hordes involves a lot of customization. I know Warhammer at least even has rules for it, where you need a certain amount of a specific model to count as being legal for play, and that your model needs to actually have the gear it's stats represent for it to be able to use that gear. There's a lot of kitbashing and using ""Green Stuff"" sculpting. Super glue, clippers, painting, sculpting bits. Clever use of sprues.  That of course is why wargames make more money than RPGs. Buy a 300 page rulebook and you're set. Want to keep competing in tournaments and you need to buy new, more expensive models, many of which are die cast in pewter as opposed to being plastic."

shutupandtakemymoney,36a2f5,sadsaffa,3,Sun May 17 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"Very clever, but I think the artist is missing an opportunity to own this idea by charging so much. It isn't to say it isn't worth that much, but the idea is so clever it will undoubtedly bring copycats who will do the same thing at a much lesser price point. Making this a bit more affordable could help drive up demand, then raise prices as the brand is established."
shutupandtakemymoney,36a2f5,shaunsanders,2,Mon May 18 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the compliment. Although this is original and creative art that takes many hours to draw in this much detail, selling for less would be working be like working for minimum wage or less."
shutupandtakemymoney,36a2f5,shaunsanders,2,Mon May 18 08:28:53 2015 UTC,"Totally get what you're saying, and agree with you. This just reminds me of those ""jump from paper"" bags. When they came out, they were a really original, creative concept that hadn't been seen before... and then other companies copied them and made really good knock-offs for a fraction of the cost.  Here, I can see the quality you put into this... but, as an artist, I also see how I could easily mimic the concept and create templates that would allow me to do what you're doing in an hour or so per trip. So while your pricing treats each individual, custom drawing as being from scratch... if two people wanted South American posters, you would split the cost of the entire drawing between 2, then actually only factor your cost to customize the existing map. I'd start with more commonly traveled areas, like Europe... spend time making a really nice europe map, campus rose, etc. Then charge to plot out the trip.  Anyway, just spitballing.   I guess my point isn't at all to change what you're doing or your pricing structure... just that I can see this becoming a trend and it'll be fun to remember that time when I saw the original creator post about it =P. Cool stuff."

shutupandtakemymoney,366l71,Isaac7250,2,Wed May 20 10:36:36 2015 UTC,Just wanted to say I've had one for a few years and I still use it! I don't use the hidden cash area that much but the hidden card slot is great for things that I don't use very often.  It also looks and feels great.  I got it from a shop called Roztayger but it doesn't look like they carry this model any more.
shutupandtakemymoney,366l71,badasimo,2,Thu May 21 18:58:00 2015 UTC,Hopefully it comes with the money included to justify being $89.95.   No way it's worth that much at all.

shutupandtakemymoney,366l71,Ma_Stache,0,Fri May 22 07:23:39 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's alright looking wallet - probably decently built, maybe you could justify the price tag on those two points alone.  But to discreetly hide your cash...from people potential peeking into your wallet? Nah, that's a little dumb. If you're that paranoid, use a CC/Visa Debit.    ""...it helps separate items you use more often from those that are important but needed less. The unique hidden flap means large bills can be concealed from view, while the flat pack storage section helps stack away cards in a secure location.""   Either don't constantly carry around large bills, or like an ordinary person when paying for goods and/or services - don't have your wallet out until you're ready to make a purchase, and don't flash it around when doing so. It's also not going to deter thieves - they won't take a quick look - see there's no cash and return the wallet to you. They'll ditch it, you'll lose your cash, cards and the $89.95 you spent on the wallet."

They end up pretty small. One of my competitors used to sell something very similar so I wanted to see what the hubub was about and that's really about it. The OP says they're good guest soaps, which they would be if they were only staying a day or so. Once they get small they get slippery and useless. I personally feel 19 dollars (9 dollars for the soap + 10 shipping) is extremely steep for 5 tiny soaps that will only be used a handful of times."
