realdubstep,3e3vlr,aydiology,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:25 2015 UTC,It didn't blow me away or anything but I reckon it would be massive on a proper soundsystem.
realdubstep,3e3xtx,akcept,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:09 2015 UTC,oh man the flow on the sub line is sick! Not to mention this drums are fucking tightttttt. thanks for postingg

realdubstep,3dywye,aydiology,3,Mon Jul 20 17:40:01 2015 UTC,I'm not sure the scene was ready for that much weight dropping at once. Respect to him for not pulling a Skream.
realdubstep,3dywye,thtanner,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:08 2015 UTC,What's a Skream?  He gave out a lot of tunes for free too.
realdubstep,3dywye,winry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:44 2015 UTC,bandwagon from deep ass rootical heavy shit to deep house.
realdubstep,3dywye,Kloster,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:25 2015 UTC,This solidifies TMSV as one of my favorite artists. It was only 2 days ago that he talked about doing this on facebook. Not to mention that Swerve and gutter are absolute bangers.

realdubstep,3dxw1m,radioslave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:34 2015 UTC,The only time I heard Smear Dub played out I had to do the Herky Jerk it was so funky wobbly. Massive tune!
realdubstep,3dxw1m,dominicaldaze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:48 2015 UTC,Karma - Smear Dub   Wow I honestly thought that was an old Coki tune this whole time...TIL its Karma.

realdubstep,3dxw1m,mortonz22,7,Mon Jul 20 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Tic by LAS when it was still a dub. Had only heard it in mala's essential mix, then saw Gantz drop it and it was difficult to know what was happening."
realdubstep,3dxw1m,fghots,2,Mon Jul 20 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, it's one of those I hope to hear some day"
realdubstep,3dxw1m,Layoar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:13 2015 UTC,heard it at SYSTEM last month - would've been bonkers if they hadn't put a limiter on :(
realdubstep,3dxw1m,StacksOfRax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:14 2015 UTC,That second drop is serrrrious.
realdubstep,3dxw1m,Scout_022,6,Mon Jul 20 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"Horror Show by Loefah. I had always like this, but it came out during an era when dubstep was marginalized and pushed into side rooms with mediocre sound.   but then, one of my friends unleashed this on a proper system and the difference was like night and day. so. much. pressure."
realdubstep,3dxw1m,DannyZesta,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:15 2015 UTC,This! I use this tune all the time to soundcheck at my venue. It's bonkers
realdubstep,3dxw1m,KingSoundwave,5,Mon Jul 20 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"The Bug - Skeng. I liked the track before, but after hearing The Widdler blast it through Funktion Ones...well, suffice to say it was sick."
realdubstep,3dxw1m,thtanner,3,Mon Jul 20 14:41:49 2015 UTC,Love when people play it. The crowd always joins in!
realdubstep,3dxw1m,KingSoundwave,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yep. Rare for more than a handful of people to know the lyrics, but everyone ALWAYS joins in to scream SKENG. Such a dope tune."
realdubstep,3dxw1m,Carpantar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:19 2015 UTC,Too many times it gets dropped as a crowd pleaser I think. Been rinsed so much in the wrong occasions  Think I prefer autechure remix now
realdubstep,3dxw1m,invisiblekid56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:53 2015 UTC,SKENG

realdubstep,3dxw1m,dddamnsonnn,5,Tue Jul 21 13:28:29 2015 UTC,Sleepers remix of Under Control. Didn't think it sounded good at first but after hearing it on the system MASS had..sweet jesus
realdubstep,3dxw1m,JimmyTheKiller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:09 2015 UTC,Oh myy godd the truth remix of this at The Moat in Outlook last year fuckin went off. Gives me shivers thinking back at it
realdubstep,3dxw1m,invisiblekid56,5,Mon Jul 20 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"I've always liked Under Control by Bukez Finezt, but you can't appreciate those horns fully until you feel them vibrating your eyeballs. Totally takes that track to a new level.  Also, just about lost my shit when Swazi Rhythm got dropped this weekend. Can't wait for that release."
realdubstep,3dxw1m,rgbPP,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:19 2015 UTC,J:Kenzo - Cause and Effect  My chest caved in from the bass
realdubstep,3dxw1m,air-,3,Mon Jul 20 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"Goth-Trad - Sunbeam VIP  J:Kenzo - Ruffhouse (Distance remix) - think this was the first time the Gritsy WOB made me go ""holy fucking shit"""
realdubstep,3dxw1m,Carpantar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:01 2015 UTC,I need to know. Have you ever heard goth trad - 2 faced out? Think it's the song I want to hear out the most and don't think I ever will
realdubstep,3dxw1m,air-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:58 2015 UTC,Another one I'd love to hear on a big system actually! Haven't heard it out myself :(
realdubstep,3dxw1m,lol_admins_are_dumb,4,Tue Jul 21 03:28:57 2015 UTC,Author - Green & Blue  Always thought it was a good tune but then I heard it proper and DAYUM
realdubstep,3dxw1m,abag0fchips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:02 2015 UTC,Just to add to this I didn't like Author - Mothership at all but that tune fucking bangs on a system.
realdubstep,3dxw1m,lol_admins_are_dumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:46 2015 UTC,Oh yeeeaaaaaah it does. So fucking hard.  I won't get into how wrong you are about it (;P) but at least we can agree it's so HARD on a system
realdubstep,3dxw1m,abag0fchips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:42:49 2015 UTC,Tbh when I first heard that tune my taste in dubstep wasn't as fleshed out as it is now. I love it now but I had to be properly educated first.
realdubstep,3dxw1m,lol_admins_are_dumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:38 2015 UTC,"Ah fair enough, I can see why it wouldn't be appealing to a newcomer, it's a little terse and offputting"

realdubstep,3dxw1m,nitwittery,2,Tue Jul 21 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"In For The Kill (Skreamix). My friend bought it when it came out and didn't think it was anything special. Hearing it drop on Iration Steppa's Soundsystem was genuinely unreal. Same goes for Nero's remix of Blinded By The Lights. Again, wasn't a massive fan of the tune, but on the same sound system, it really was something else. Maybe everything just sounds good on Iration.."
realdubstep,3dxw1m,kushdizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:09 2015 UTC,"I was about to say I remember both of these being dropped the same night on iration system and that I still have in for the kill, but then I realised we were both there, fairly sure mala cleared the room straight after skream by playing a minute of solid bass into anti war dub?"
realdubstep,3dxw1m,JimmyTheKiller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:13 2015 UTC,Dj Madd - Someone (Breakage remix) and Skream - Bahl Fwd
