Thailand,3e69c5,jeffmcneill,0,Wed Jul 22 07:29:40 2015 UTC,this article and its author has to be fake: I was told on this board that Thais are not capable of critical thinking or of questioning the authorities. Only western minds and white foreign tourists living in Thailand can do that.   /s
Thailand,3e21v3,jonez450reloaded,2,Tue Jul 21 10:26:48 2015 UTC,"Transport Minister Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong affirmed the Indonesiaâ€™s restriction but assured that the recent move by Indonesia would not disrupt any operations by Thai airlines   Instead of ""meh, doesn't matter"", how about a statement promising to fix the whole airline safety mess? This fine fellow was in charge when it all started, didn't do enough to address the early warnings (which were loud and public)... and still doesn't seem to be too worried. Does there need to be a major air crash before the authorities take the issues seriously?  When Indonesia (a country with a terrible air safety record) bans your flights on air safety grounds, you must be doing something very, very wrong. It's almost like China criticizing you over human rights abuses..."
Thailand,3e21v3,AdorableAnt,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:13 2015 UTC,Because that would require admitting fault.
Thailand,3e21v3,StopMakingScents,-4,Wed Jul 22 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"some journalist asked ""what about Thai Airways"" the minister answered and someone wrote an article around that statement.      The way Thai news article are written are different from the way in English speaking countries. and this source doesn't even want to be on par with high lvl journalism.  if you want a full length editorial at the state of Thai airline safety don't look in a thaipbs english article for it.  but i guess you just wanted to post a rant on things you look down because they aren't like back home."
Thailand,3e21v3,horsthorsthorst,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"Please let me know where I can find ""a full length editorial at the state of Thai airline safety"" that meets your approval."
Thailand,3e21v3,militarydictator2015,2,Wed Jul 22 01:44:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure what Hors is referring to but this is a pretty good interview covering the issue. In summary he said the problem was caused by lacking of auditing due to budget cuts made over the years resulting in poor/no record-keeping and regulatory control. Right now only a staff of 11 when in reality it should be closer to 60. They're in the process of hiring but it's slow as people with experience are quite limited in the global market. There are 33 critical points to fix in the next 90 days (since the interview, last month) and he feels confident that 95% will be finished as they are not difficult to implement. In addition there is a list of 'best practices' numbering in the 100s that they will look to apply over a longer period. Biggest impact in the short-term is an inability of Thai airlines to provide additional flights to certain countries. Guy feels confident that it's safe to fly, because Thai airlines have bought a lot of new equipment such as A380 etc.   Not sure if that confidence extends to the old Airbus I flew on Bangkok Airlines recently that had Russian writing on the wings."
Thailand,3e21v3,Grande_Yarbles,5,Wed Jul 22 06:02:19 2015 UTC,"some journalist asked ""what about Thai Airways"" the minister answered and someone wrote an article around that statement.   That's how good investigative news reporting works. Reporters try to get tangential stories from unsuspecting interviewees. It's irrelevant that this was not the primary subject of the interview: it was a revelation. Furthermore if such a thing were revealed in such a way during an interview in a non-Thai country, it would also be huge news in that country.  I'm guessing from your reaction that you're not used to how a free press works. Newspapers in the west are crammed full of stories that are critical of their government. It's not prejudice, it's just normal for the balancing element that counters the upper and lower houses of government and the judiciary."
Thailand,3e21v3,Ftumsh,0,Tue Jul 21 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"my point is that you cannot build your criticism of the Thai airline safety on a shitty article published by thaipbs english.   i am guessing you are not used to how certain media here in Thailand works. No one really bothers to delver a quality article on thaipbs english, It is not even a newspaper but a TV channel.  it is mostly not based on investigation but on same quote from an official. that quote is often not put in proper context other things left out and the whole story is not reported, not because the fine folks at thai pbs want to hide something from you, they just don't care.   i am pretty sure the are shitty news sources in the west. i will not take them as primary source to feed my negative feeling i might have."

The iStudio (Copperwired) chain has always served me well and has the same prices as Apple online. They retail a lot of high-end accessories in the store as well, including LifeProof cases :-)   I usually end up at the iStudio in Digital World,  ground level just opposite Siam Paragon. There's a direct exit from Siam BTS."

Thailand,3dpnmo,horsthorsthorst,-2,Sat Jul 18 07:24:20 2015 UTC,Isn't that just for foreign tourists?
Thailand,3dpnmo,horsthorsthorst,-2,Sat Jul 18 09:26:00 2015 UTC,the whole scheme is called VAT Refund for Tourists. the shops participating have a VAT refund for Tourists sign. The yellow application form clearly says VAT refund for Tourists on it.  The counter at the airport has a big sign that says VAT refund for Tourists - and you have never seen it?    Visa exemption is for tourist visitors as well so you don't need to have a tourist visa to be classified as tourist and eligible to get a refund under the VAT refund for Tourists scheme.    So are you speaking from experience and did you get VAT refund while being something else than a foreign tourist?     edit: here is a photo of the application form  http://i.imgur.com/3yWgN3z.jpg you fill in your details under for tourist.  how comes that you have never seen that.
Thailand,3dpnmo,upvotersfortruth,0,Sat Jul 18 09:49:57 2015 UTC,"What is their definition of a tourist?   if you get your VAT refund under the VAT refund for Tourists scheme they probably see you as tourists.     but some foreigners in this subreddit are pretty much in denial when it comes to their 'status' in Thailand. on one hand they reaping the benefits of being a tourist when getting atax refund, on the other hand they complaining that the locals get a discount at certain places and tourist not and call that a scam.  A discount you could also get as a foreigner nota bene if you can proof that you are a resident or pay taxes here.  edit to add: btw. i searched the board to find some other thread on the VAT refund issue and interesting enough i found the following comment made by nobody else than yourself   Your ticket type doesn't matter, but you need to have either a tourist visa or an exempt stamp (not a Non-Immigrant visa or an extension), and it must be less than 60 days after the purchase.      https://np.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/3atizv/if_i_buy_from_the_apple_store_th_can_i_get_vat/csg0jfw  so few weeks you claimed it will work only for genuine tourists with the proper visa status, now you claim you got the refund several times by being something else than a tourist. tagged you now as the bullshiter."
