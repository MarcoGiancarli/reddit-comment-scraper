I never expressed any wish to antagonize these  guys, I have never contacted nor have I ever posted in their sub.  And just got this message  //you have been banned from posting to /r/Socialistmusic. note from the moderators: Pay denbts. you can contact the moderators regarding your ban by replying to this message. warning: using other accounts to circumvent a subreddit ban is considered a violation of reddit's site rules and can result in being banned from reddit entirely.//  Just wow  EDIT: my post on r/communistmusic is in a different thread of r/fullcommunism, which means that quite literally these guys are just banning for fan anyone anytime.

FULLCOMMUNISM,3e1ghk,Gohte,12,Tue Jul 21 07:46:39 2015 UTC,It's kind of exciting. Never been banned from a sub before. Much less banned from a sub occupied by Nazis.   We'll take it back like good Soviets would. Then we invade /pol/.
FULLCOMMUNISM,3e1ghk,tigernmas,9,Tue Jul 21 07:48:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is going to be fun, also, they replied to me with this:   Watch the racism please.

FULLCOMMUNISM,3e1ghk,instantdebris,9,Tue Jul 21 07:53:02 2015 UTC,They replied to me with pretty much the same thing.  We should decorate /r/FULLCOMMUNISM with anti-Nazi posters such as this one. . It would be glorious comrade!
