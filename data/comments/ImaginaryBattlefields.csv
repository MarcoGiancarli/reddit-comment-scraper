I also found this link. Not sure how accurate it is but it resembles the soldier in the photo closely. I believe that these soldiers are sturmbatallion.

Here is an analysis of Stannis himself by the same person, which I highly recommend. Again, spoilers  Stannis in the book as a whole, as a character, is definitely better done than Stannis in the show. Of course, the same can be said for most of the characters, but this is usually a restriction based on the TV platform, you simply don't have the time and budget to flesh out all the characters that well.

He may have assumed they just headed for the coast. It's one thing to break a contract, it's another to actually switch sides, and sellswords trade largely on their reputation, so I imagine it's not a decision they took lightly.  So from his perspective, he would have still been looking at slightly superior numbers, with neither side having any cavalry to speak of. Lay the siege, hope the thaw holds long enough for Davos to return with food, and maybe even horses and troops, while they use the surrounding forest to construct siege weapons.  Would he have been successful? Hard to say, odds were stacked against him, but he had a shot, and in his mind, the blessing of the the one true god. But when he got hit by the sellsword cavalry charge, well... You can see the look of defeat in his eyes before he draws his sword."

Bears are real, not imaginary.    A: All artwork is inherently imaginary. Unless it is a photorealistic copy of a real photograph, the colors, details, composition etc all came out of the artist's imagination. This is also why we allow WWII artwork in /r/ImaginaryHistory - even subject of the artwork is a real place/event/thing etc, it takes a lot of talent and imagination to create the wonderful artwork that we see in our network on a daily basis. ""Imaginary"" is simply the naming scheme that ties all of our subreddits together into a single network."

One of the things that fascinates me historically is trying to visualize late Roman engagements - both from the equipment and tactics of the legions to the overall ""feel"" of a battle.  It's too easy to associate the classic late-Republic / early-empire legionary image with anything ""Roman"", even if 4th century troops only very vaguely resembled what Julius Caesar was running around Gaul with."

Bears are real, not imaginary.    A: All artwork is inherently imaginary. Unless it is a photorealistic copy of a real photograph, the colors, details, composition etc all came out of the artist's imagination. This is also why we allow WWII artwork in /r/ImaginaryHistory - even subject of the artwork is a real place/event/thing etc, it takes a lot of talent and imagination to create the wonderful artwork that we see in our network on a daily basis.

Much like its namesake, the Shrike has a special ""tree "" for its victims: a vast, artificial tree-like armature made of a substance resembling chrome steel and studded with three-meter-long thorns. When the Shrike chose to impale victims on the thorns, they would not die, but rather continue living while experiencing the full physical pain of impalement. Countless individuals - possibly numbering in the thousands or millions - have been taken by the Shrike and impaled on this tree, including Martin Silenus and his patron, Sad King Billy.

If you like books, you have an absolutely huge selection to choose from. I have a breakdown of some of the more famous (and better) ones here. Most of them have little connection plot-wise to one another other than taking place in the 40k universe and instead follow different members of different factions.  If you have any questions /r/40kLore and /r/AskScienceFiction are pretty decent places to ask. I also mod a sub called /r/ImaginaryWarhammer where I normally write little blurbs explaining what's going on in pictures."

The Imperium of Man The Emperor Protects...   Read more >   The Emperor Protects...  They Shall Know No Fear... Suffer Not the Alien to Live! The Creators! ""It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that he may never truly die.Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods."" Warhammer 40,000 is a science fantasy tabletop war game set in approximately the year 40,000 AD, created by the British hobby company Games Workshop and first published in 1987. Games Workshop also created Warhammer Fantasy Battles, a table-top war game whose fictional dark fantasy universe, first published in 1983, was the basis for Warhammer 40,000 and whose miniatures gaming system was the foundation for The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game. The game is a hobby enjoyed by thousands of people across the world and includes modelling and painting a full army of miniatures who represent the various forces of Order and Chaos in the dark, dystopian future of the 41st Millennium. The Warhammer 40k Wiki is a collaborative project to create the most definitive, accurate, and accessible encyclopedia and reference for all official, canon-only information related to Warhammer 40,000. The database is organized in a Wiki structure, which allows an incredible level of interconnectedness and expansion.

ImaginaryBattlefields,30rjy0,DingDongSeven,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:28:47 2015 UTC,There was no thumbs down. It was thumb up for mercy and thumb to the throat for execution. The thumb signified a blade.

ImaginaryBattlefields,2zzxc8,Arkmes,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:50:13 2015 UTC,"Solar sail:       Solar sails (also called light sails or photon sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds. Light sails could also be driven by energy beams to extend their range of operations, which is strictly beam sailing rather than solar sailing.  Solar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes. Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads.  Solar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven, measured effect on spacecraft. Solar pressure affects all spacecraft, whether in interplanetary space or in orbit around a planet or small body. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, will be displaced by thousands of kilometres by solar pressure, so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory planning, which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the attitude of a craft, a factor that must be included in spacecraft design.

Think about it: When they breached the corvette at the start of episode IV they decimated the crew with extreme prejudice. And when they took out Hoth in episode V they were damn effective at clearing out the base. The whole purpose of the Death Star bit where they couldn't hit anything was to plant a tracking device on the Millenium Falcon so the Imperials could find the rebel base. Princess Leia even says so with something like, ""It was too easy."""

ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,mihachris,12,Mon Feb 9 14:45:07 2015 UTC,Why the red smoke? (Legitimately wondering) was it just an aesthetic choice?
ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,DrewTheHobo,20,Mon Feb 9 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"Obviously, heavily inspired by Godzilla. The red smoke could indicate the soldier's position, especially when the weather is so bad and the visibility low. But yeah, thought the smoke would be cool."

ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,saargrin,6,Mon Feb 9 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"Less than that; there's 129 on a LA class nuclear sub. In the cramped space numbers won't count for much. Also, I doubt that a sub crew would be all that well prepared for hand-to-hand combat; they aren't going to have sidearms on their persons."
ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,medford_btc,2,Tue Feb 10 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"i think there are supposed to be at least a few ncos armed at all times, at least thats what i know from non-US subs ive been on the boatswain and the officer of the watch and the armory sergeant also the big subs usually carry a team of SEALs or other operators"
ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,figec,0,Tue Feb 10 08:41:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, but that's still just a few armed people at most. It's feasible that a few well-trained people could take control of the sub. Especially in the cramped quarters I think it would be fairly easy to pick apart a largely unarmed crew that's not expecting an attack."
ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,55easy,2,Tue Feb 10 08:54:28 2015 UTC,"if i were a captain of a nuke sub, id probably seal all compartments if somebody attempted to penetrate ,and dive     i'm not an expert ,but never heard of training to  HALO onto a hostile sub ..."
ImaginaryBattlefields,2vawrv,DrewTheHobo,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:02:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I would imagine that the chance of success is very unlikely. Just landing and getting on board the sub would be a huge challenge. Once you get on board though, you've got some kind of chance of succeeding, esp. if you had gas-masks and some kind of chemical agent that you could pop to knock-out/kill crew members. Also, would it be possible to breach the bulkheads with a shaped charge? I bet something like this would only happen in very desperate scenarios, like to avert nuclear armageddon or something."

ImaginaryBattlefields,2thmxf,ShadeO89,6,Sat Jan 24 12:27:02 2015 UTC,"Estimated numbers of the english army:  Modern estimates range from 6,000[1] to 9,000[2] (see Numbers at Agincourt.) About 5⁄6 longbow archers, 1⁄6 dismounted knights and men-at-arms in heavy armour.  EDIT: Casualties and losses English: At least 112 dead, unknown wounded[3]  French: 7,000–10,000 (mostly killed) and about 1,500 noble prisoners[4] Wiki  Because the english army consisted of mostly archers I would not agree with you on that point"

ImaginaryBattlefields,2ldjqa,HunterTAMUC,2,Thu Nov 6 00:27:48 2014 UTC,"The fall of Mardosh finally awakened the remaining Sarnori kings to the depth of their peril. Putting aside their own quarrels and rivalries at last, the Tall Men gathered from up and down the Sarne, assembling a great army beneath the walls of Sarnath, intent on breaking the power of the khals for good and all. Led by Mazor Alexi, last of the High Kings, they struck out boldly to the east. In the tall grass halfway between Sarnath and the ruins of Kasath, they met the assembled power of four khalasars on what forever after was known as the Field of Crows.  Khal Haro, Khal Qano, Khal Loso (the Lame), and Khal Zhako commanded almost eighty thousand horsemen between them, we are told. The great host of the High King of Sarnor was led by six thousand scythed chariots, with ten thousand armored riders behind them, and another ten thousand light horsemen (many of them women) on the flanks. Behind them marched the Sarnori foot, close to a hundred thousand spearmen and slingers, giving the Tall Men a great advantage in numbers. On this all chroniclers agree.  As battle was joined, the Sarnori chariots threatened to carry all before them. Their earth-shattering advance smashed through the center of the Dothraki horde, the spinning blades on the wheels of their chariots slicing through the legs of the Dothraki horses. When Khal Haro himself went down before them, cut to pieces and trampled, his khalasar broke and fled. As the chariots thundered after the fleeing horsemen, the High King and his armored riders plunged in after them, followed by the Sarnori foot, waving their spears and screaming victory.  Their elation was short-lived. The rout was feigned. When they had drawn the Tall Men deep into the trap, the fleeing Dothraki turned suddenly and unleashed a storm of arrows from their great bows. The khalasars of Khal Qano and Khal Zhako swept in from north and south, while Loso the Lame and his screamers circled round and attacked the Sarnori from the rear, cutting off their retreat. Completely encircled, the High King and his mighty host were cut to pieces. Some say a hundred thousand men died that day, amongst them Mazor Alexi, six lesser kings, and more than threescore lords and heroes. As the crows feasted on their corpses, the riders of the khalasars walked amongst the dead and squabbled over their valuables.  Bereft of defenders, Sarnath of the Tall Towers fell to Loso the Lame less than a fortnight later. Not even the Palace With a Thousand Rooms was spared when Khal Loso put the city to the torch.  The remaining cities of the grasslands followed one by one, as the Century of Blood drew to its close. Sarys, at the mouth of the Sarne, was the last to fall but yielded little in the way of slaves or plunder, for the people of the city had largely fled by the time that Khal Zeggo descended upon it.  It must not be thought that the Kingdom of Sarnor was the only victim of the horselords. The Valyrian colony Essaria, sometimes remembered as the Lost Free City, was similarly overwhelmed. Today its ruins are known to the Dothraki as Vaes Khadokh, the City of Corpses. In the north, Khal Dhako sacked and burned Ibbish, reclaiming most of the small foothold the men of Ib had carved out on the northern coast of Essos (a much smaller Ibbenese colony survives in the dense forests beside the Shivering Sea, huddled around the town they have named New Ibbish). In the south, other khals led their hordes into the Red Waste, destroying the Qaathi towns and cities that once dotted that desert, until only the great city of Qarth remained, protected by its towering triple wall."

The Peace Brigade/Yuuzhan Vong conquest of the jungle moon was partially due to the fact that the New Republic was unwilling to provide aid for the New Jedi Order. The battle was divided into two phases: the initial Peace Brigade attack, and the subsequent attempts to recover the Jedi who remained trapped on the jungle moon as the Yuuzhan Vong consolidated their presence in the system.

ImaginaryBattlefields,2dt1vr,Fancypan7z0,5,Sun Aug 17 21:07:38 2014 UTC,Guess the results of LCS that year will be controversial enough to spark a Korean civil war.   So...the South decided to invade Taiwan to gain more resources?
ImaginaryBattlefields,2dt1vr,Viend,2,Sun Aug 17 21:09:36 2014 UTC,Yep.  The Assassins we're winning too much.
ImaginaryBattlefields,2dt1vr,Fancypan7z0,1 point,Sun Aug 17 21:58:49 2014 UTC,It was a civil war because fuck logic.  Edit: ...and because OP was behind it all.

ImaginaryBattlefields,2d30xo,Ragemelon,1 point,Sat Aug 9 18:28:06 2014 UTC,I had the same thought. Looks almost like they tried to build one out of half a Broadside suit.

ImaginaryBattlefields,2cqgdc,Ozymil,0,Wed Aug 6 07:53:37 2014 UTC,This is a random ass picture. Like what is a leopard doing in the cold. Plus what the fuck is that nigga doin in the back with that sword? Psh bitch trippin
ImaginaryBattlefields,2coor4,Lol33ta,2,Tue Aug 5 13:14:45 2014 UTC,I dont post often but this one really is amazing.  What gets me is the care put into the glow around Eowyn.  Awesome.

ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,karmicviolence,3,Mon Aug 4 00:29:32 2014 UTC,"This is awesome, only thing that lets it down for me is missing gloves, other than that... very awesome!"
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,FastFruit,2,Mon Aug 4 14:48:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the lack of gloves stands out as not really fitting, but they contrast and remind you the subject is human.  I think it's funny that the ""future"" soldier's rifle is the 1957-born AR-15 with modern modifications. One could interpret that it's just that good a design, I guess. :p"
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,Swordsmanus,3,Mon Aug 4 15:14:39 2014 UTC,It's an M4. Standard army issue but with a few additions like a peq-15. Still completely unfuturistic though
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,JtiksPies,-2,Mon Aug 4 15:54:27 2014 UTC,"Who said it was an M4? Even If it is the automatic big brother of the AR-15 it is in Semi-Automatic mode, helping the case that it isn't select fire."
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,happyshlappy,1 point,Mon Aug 4 18:17:16 2014 UTC,"M4s aren't fully automatic. Yes the selector switch is set to semi but I don't see how that helps the case that it isn't select fire, because it is.  The next setting is burst which is still a semi automatic mode"
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,JtiksPies,2,Tue Aug 5 15:56:04 2014 UTC,"It still depends on what variant you are talking about.  The first M4, called the M4, was only capable of semi and burst fire modes while the M4A1 was capable of full automatic fire.  Regardless of what type of rifle he is shooting, I think it detracts from the overall image.  The artist could have chosen something designed in the last 2 decades and used a Tavor to improve the overall ""Future"" image. The M4 was designed in the late 1980s and is based off of a design from the 1950s.  I hope hope hope that by the time we have exoskeleton suits we have moved away from the AR15 platform.  The image also looks pretty weirdto me in that if you really look at the detail of the mechanical arm, it looks like the artist has used Photoshop to overlay images from modern day items.  The ""watch"" doesnt flow well with the hand and looks like it would interfere with movement. The cable along the shoulder looks out of place and vulnerable while still looking like a power cable i'd find in my own computer. The pistons along the forearm and in front that seem to attach to the rifle's magazine....I don't even know wtf is going on there."
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,opiatool,0,Thu Aug 7 18:30:39 2014 UTC,"It depends on the varient, police have full auto. in the military it is what your CO or whoever wants.  My Neighbor and good friend is a vet as well as a police officer and I have fired his guns. What makes it an M4?"
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,happyshlappy,3,Tue Aug 5 16:20:58 2014 UTC,Maybe future gloves do look like that.
ImaginaryBattlefields,2cjlq5,a3f,-15,Mon Aug 4 16:11:20 2014 UTC,"Yup, not photoshopped at all."
