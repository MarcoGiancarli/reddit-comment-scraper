conspiracy,3dx3j8,Cgn38,5,Mon Jul 20 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"It's very much an international problem. Rich westerners are propping up these sex slavery rings in poor and destabilized countries. They come down to those countries so they can fuck the sex slaves.  When you see it in western countries it just represents the powerful getting bpld and reckless with their child fucking. They usually travel and keep it confined to places no one cares about.  From research it seems like LA, Rome (specifically Vatican city), the UK, Brazil, Mexico, and Thailand are the biggest problem areas right now.  The pedos in LA that trade sex for fame have been well documented. Mothers will pimp out their daughters, literally pimp them out, to get them roles on shows.  abuse being covered up by Catholic priests has also been coming to light. (they don't molest children at a rate higher than the general population, but they cover it up. That's the issue)  Mexico had a bad problem with cartels. The cartels have a big hand in the sex trafficking trade in addition to the drug trade. Thousands of young girls are taken and sold into sex slavery. The Mexican drug war has killed 106,000 people and displaced 1.6 million people in Mexico since 2006. That's a ripe area for exploitation.   Brazil, Mexico, and SE Asian countries like Thailand are exporters of these sex slaves, and are ""tourist"" destinations for these types. When the rich in western countries want to get their rocks off fucking children and slaves they get with networks operating those places.  For Mexico, migrants come through mexico from central America and get tricked into slavery (one case was a ""Drug Rehab"" facility for migrants in Mexico turned out to be a factory where 107 migrant slaves were working). Tourists from the US and Canada get taken too, but nowhere near as much as the native Mexicans and central American migrants. The majority of customers come from  the US western Europe and Canada.   Mexico is a large source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor. Government and NGO statistics suggest that the magnitude of forced labor surpasses that of forced prostitution in Mexico. Groups considered most vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico include women, children, indigenous persons, and undocumented migrants. Mexican women, girls, and boys are subjected to sexual servitude within the United States and Mexico, lured by false job offers from poor rural regions to urban, border, and tourist areas. Mexican trafficking victims were also subjected to conditions of forced labor in domestic servitude, street begging, and construction in both the United States and Mexico. In one case, 107 trafficking victims, both Mexican and foreign citizens, were freed from a factory disguised as a drug rehabilitation center in Mexico City; many of them had been kidnapped, and all were subjected to forced labor.[1]  The vast majority of foreign victims in forced labor and sexual servitude in Mexico are from Central America, particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador; many transit Mexico en route to the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Western Europe. However, trafficking victims from South America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa are also found in Mexico, and some transit the country en route to the United States.   Unaccompanied Central American minors, traveling through Mexico to meet family members in the United States, fall victim to human traffickers, particularly near the Guatemalan border. Mexican men and boys from Southern Mexico are found in conditions of forced labor in Northern Mexico, and Central Americans, especially Guatemalans, are subjected to forced labor in southern Mexico, particularly in agriculture. Child sex tourism continues to grow in Mexico, especially in tourist areas such as Acapulco and Cancun, and northern border cities like Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Most child sex tourists are from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, although some are Mexican citizens   For Brazil Russian and Spanish sex slavery networks have been uncovered   According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, sex trafficking of Brazilian women occurs in every Brazilian state and the federal district. A large number of Brazilian women and children, many from the state of Goiás, are found in forced prostitution abroad, often in Spain, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States, but also as far away as Japan. Brazilian authorities have uncovered evidence that foreign organized criminal networks, particularly from Russia and Spain, are involved in sex trafficking of Brazilian women. There is evidence that some Brazilian transsexuals have been subjected to forced prostitution abroad. Brazilian women and children are also subjected to forced prostitution in neighboring countries such as Argentina, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela, and Paraguay.  Brazil is a destination for the trafficking of men, women, and children from Bolivia, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Paraguay, China and African countries for forced labor in garment factories and textile sweatshops in metropolitan centers such as São Paulo. African, Arab and Bangladeshi migrants forced to work in the halal chicken factories in the Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. Child sex tourism remains a serious problem, particularly in resort and coastal areas in Brazil’s northeast. Child sex tourists typically arrive from Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States.   Sex trafficking in Thailand has always existed, but with US soldiers for the Vietnam war getting Thai ""services"" and Chinese men coming down to Thailand in the late 50s the sex slave population skyrocketed in the 60s and 70s  In 1957 there were 20,000 prostitutes (both child and adult) in Thailand. By 1972 there were 500,000. It has only grown since then. Thailands reputation is somewhere you can go to find child prostitutes and fuck them"

conspiracy,3dx3j8,zaturama015,3,Mon Jul 20 13:42:52 2015 UTC,"It's way way way more than just England. The rich in western countries (West Europe, The US, and Canada) are feeding these sex slavery rings with sex tourism and forced prostitution networks being exported abroad.  Mexico, Thailand, and Brazil are the biggest providers.  Mexico usually services the US, Canada, and Western Europe.  Thailand has a booming child sex industry that has been going since the late 60s.  Brazil is the sex slave supplier for much of western Europe (linked to spain, Portugal, Russia, italy, Germany, the UK, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands) the surrounding south American countries  (Argentina, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela, Bolivia and Paraguay) and the US, Canada, China, Japan, Bangladesh, and Lebanon.  Brazil supplies women, children, and transsexuals for those countries to fuck. Foreign networks have been found operating in Brazil (Russia and Spain)."

conspiracy,3dx3j8,Zi7,2,Mon Jul 20 17:12:02 2015 UTC,It gives them occult power (lots of fear energy is created when abusing children).
conspiracy,3dx3j8,Mageant,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's more to do with the fact that they are too rich. Once you've seen all the world's sights, stayed in the fanciest hotels, eaten at all the best restaurants, and screwed all the most expensive prostitutes, people go for the next most exotic thing. Whether it's buying your own island or screwing underage girls/boys, there is a person out there with no morals willing to supply that demand. The conspiracy part of this whole ordeal, in my opinion, is the massive power granted to the providers. The organizers of these rings are the ones who own each and every one of the politicians, businessmen, celebrities, etc., who take part. Part of organized crime is being organized, i.e. keeping records, so they could destroy the reputation of any one of these men/women (I've not heard of women being involved yet, but it's definitely possible) if they wanted to, just like having pictures of them with ""regular"" prostitutes. The fact that it's kids though adds greatly to their fear of prosecution. Combine this with the inherent fear a reasonable person would have of this kind of organization and you can see why (almost) nobody would be willing to speak out.  Then again this could just be a distraction, since there will most likely be no prosecution, just like with Bill Cosby, because the events are all from 20+ years ago. ""They"" tend to bring up old scandals that cause a lot of public outrage without actually generating any real changes, to distract the masses from other voices screaming about things that are happening now."
conspiracy,3dx3j8,lateral_us,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:21:14 2015 UTC,"Of course it is still happening now. Look at the increased sexual imagery of children in advertising, the sexualization of Disney, Nickelodeon, other Hollywood kid stars. The depictions are becoming more blatant, reflecting how deeply it's penetrated the arts. The goal is to lower the age of consent, to make pedophilia normal and legal."
