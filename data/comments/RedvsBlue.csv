Nothing specific, but basically set up a scenario where either Locus directly kills Felix, or leaves him to die instead of saving him.   2: I want one of the generals to be wounded (not killed), preferably Kimball, so the other has to lead the armies into a union. Then a certain temple helps everyone make up at the end.   3: this is the furthest fetched of my far fetched hopes. I want the Reds and Blues to assume command of a ship to go to war against Malcom and any planets that may align to his side, assuming that his treachery is revealed, kicking off a galactic civil war (sounds a bit familiar).   I have serious doubts that any of these will happen, but a man can dream. And then be crestfallen when his dreams are shattered."

Then in the final battle she reveals she's been able to harness O'Malley's psycho personality to unleash on the enemies so we see Doc (with the O'Malley) personality in charge going on a crazy rampage against Charon.

RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,TodtheT1000,27,Mon Jul 20 09:04:09 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Church never actually went back in time, it was Gamma fucking with him for old times sake.  Church was never successfully able to change anything that happened or effect anything at all. Even Tex had no memory of there ever being multiple Churches. So we can assume that it never really happened.  It's revealed that Gamma and Sigma have tortured Alpha in the past making up scenarios for him to fail. So he's more than capable of doing it. So we can assume that he did it again."
RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,JacksonSX35,15,Mon Jul 20 09:12:23 2015 UTC,Wait so the reds and blues never traveled to the future

RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,Libertyprime117,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"How did Flowers/ Florida originally die? Was it just a heart attack?   Most likely the case. Gamma just made Church think he was responsible for his death.   And why is Filis named Shelia if Church didnt change it?   Probably to keep Alpha's memories of torture from resurfacing and being used to hurt Project Freelancer. Something familiar would be more likely to trigger those memories returning. Also explains how Florida/Flowers went from blue ODST armor to aqua Mark 5, and why Tex/Beta accepted the 'ghost' story when she knew the truth."
RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,idMisteroe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:36 2015 UTC,Tex accepting the ghost story can more be chalked up to Tex just knowing whats going on and having no real want or need to tell church the truth.
RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,Libertyprime117,4,Tue Jul 21 12:41:03 2015 UTC,The time travel was just gamma bringing them a few minutes after the explosion. It wasn't actually significantly very far into the future.

RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,Forikorder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:02 2015 UTC,"noone told him so, Church sat in a hallway for a thousand years, spent months sitting in bloodgulch watching everything happen again, noone told him he travelled through time  and the idea that it was all a simiulation from Gary only raising more questions and plot holes"

RedvsBlue,3dxcgt,2ayy4lmao,3,Tue Jul 21 05:10:43 2015 UTC,I don't see what the difference is. Either way Gary leads Church to believe that Church is using time travel to try to fix everything that had happened at that point.

RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,DarkKing97,16,Sun Jul 19 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Church or Tucker had more development.

RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,TodtheT1000,10,Sun Jul 19 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. He was always an AI, we just didn't know it yet. It's not really character development if he was always that thing. And when he did find out he was an AI, he didn't act different at all: Still an asshole. Wash on the other hand, has gone from Protagonist, to Deutoragonist, to Antagonist, to Protagonist again in 5 seasons. He is a completely different character than the one in Season 6, it's almost like it's not the same guy, and then of course to prove he's not the same, he goes on a murderous hunt for the BGC, and a few episodes later becomes their ally again."
RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,84981725891758912576,8,Sun Jul 19 10:02:45 2015 UTC,"No, he didn't change much after finding out he was an AI, then again he wasn't the only Church. We got to see Church go from basically a clone of the Director into a series of multiple personalities from what can only be described as the most intensive self harm ever. We saw his desperate pursuit of Tex, the women he loved and lost. Then he moved on and ""forgot"" her. Now he's closer to Carolina's Brother. That's a lot of development, even if some of it was before BGC.  From a story standpoint, he went from being the main protagonist seasons 1-5, to being a just another character season 6-10. A plot point in season 7, and what I can only describe as a sub character in season 12+.  I say sub character because he's no longer independent, he's only on screen when another character is, mainly Carolina. He have less free will than the others."
RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,TodtheT1000,5,Sun Jul 19 12:32:16 2015 UTC,"But Epsilon isn't really church, and even counting him, IMO wash has had more in less time."
RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,84981725891758912576,7,Sun Jul 19 12:44:54 2015 UTC,He is the character of Church. He remembers BGC and consider the sim soldiers friends. He is Church.
RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,TodtheT1000,5,Sun Jul 19 14:21:19 2015 UTC,Until Caboose stops calling him Church he will always be Church
RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,Dakota66,2,Sun Jul 19 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree, it took Tucker far longer to develop than Wash. You are right about Church, each of him."

A-Church was introduced in Season 1 and killed off in Season 6. Aside from a few scenes in S10 that was the last we saw of him (6 seasons plus a few more episodes).  Wash had a miniseries (Recovery One) before being formally introduced to the main story in Season 6. He is still alive as of Season 13 (7 seasons plus RO)."
RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,OtakuMecha,5,Sun Jul 19 14:15:24 2015 UTC,Burnie actually said the same thing in the S11 commentary I believe. Wash has been there a while but still feels somewhat new.

RedvsBlue,3ds9uw,mcandhp,3,Sun Jul 19 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you actually.  Wash has had a shit ton of development, probably only rivaled by Epsilon/Alpha/Church. He went from helpful, to villan, to Blue leader, to Blue soldier, back to Blue leader, and one of the leaders in the army of Chorus. Even besides that, he developed. In the S12 episode Fed vs. New, he said that he used to be a shithead. He acknowledged that. He's patient, he's a leader. Actually kinda reminds me of North and York."

RedvsBlue,3dn9wy,BoneArrowInfinity,24,Fri Jul 17 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Epsilon-Tex, the one that Meta and Wash were fighting and went into the capture unit, was deleted by Epsilon while in the memory unit at the end of Season 9.   The Tex robots that were in Season 10 were deleted by the Director. However, these were deleted along with F.I.L.S.S., which Hargrove recovered, so if Tex comes back, it's not gonna be Tex, or Epsilon-Tex, but probably some new Tex.

RedvsBlue,3dn9wy,infernal_llamas,10,Sat Jul 18 10:12:09 2015 UTC,No she was in the capture unit that Epsilon went into.   It's assume they merged and that Tex was forgotten.   The later Tex in season 10 was created by the director and that's why she kinda sucked. He couldn't get her right and that why it took all of them to create a personality Church could talk to. He then helped her move on essentially.   And Original Tex was destroyed in the EMP along with the rest of the Ai.   Pretty much there isn't a way for Tex to come back.
RedvsBlue,3dn9wy,infernal_llamas,2,Fri Jul 17 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Darn. I just would love to see Tex in this modern, Chorus setting. :-("

The line itself is one of the most underrated in the series, too. It was a line of anger and mystery, from a man who'd suffered years of torment and loss.

They've made him a little too altruistic lately, and with Carolina mourning the death of her comrades in Project Freelancer, I get the feeling that we're about to see her completely alone.

RedvsBlue,3dfav9,DarkRubberDucky,4,Wed Jul 15 22:26:35 2015 UTC,Omega is more likely than Sigma since that would require Elijah wood again.   I think something might happen and Epsilon will snap and unleash Omega. Or perhaps he will be forced to use him to fully complete a task.   Trying to repress some aspects of himself while using others and running equipment is probably why he is failing.

RedvsBlue,3db3v8,heyhey922,-6,Sat Jul 18 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"What always bugged me was Sigma's idea that collecting all the AI fragments would result in Metastability. I mean, I get that he's Ambition and Creativity, but he was even told in the Classroom that its only theoretical that a Full fledged AI could become stable, and Sigma was a fraction of one.  Masterchief had a fullblown smart AI in his head and he wasnt driven bonkers from it and it wasnt until game 4 that Cortana, an AI made from the brain of the woman who made the damn AI in the first place , started showing signs of metastabilizing.  I mean, i can get Epsilon becoming meta, he was a fraction who had the memories of a whole AI, so there was room to grow. Cortana says AIs usually kick it because they learn so much they think themselves to death. Epsilon, being a fraction but remembering being a whole, had room to allow the thinking overload to stabilize. Didnt hurt that he was able to constantly distract himself with idiots.  But Sigma straight up wanted to go Cortana's route and he was calling himself ""meta"" when he had Maine with only, what, 3/8ths an AI?"
RedvsBlue,3db3v8,twitchedawake,15,Wed Jul 15 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"By the time we see him in Recovery One and Reconstruction, there's practically nothing left of Maine's mind.

From what I've gathered and from what else I can assume, Maine seemed to be a big team player. For instance, he took a bullet for Carolina and chose to battle alongside her despite the wound. But of course, despite nearly dying to save Carolina and to escape with the package, he ended up at the second-lowest place on the leaderboard and was constantly treated like a brute idiot (i.e. Epsilon-Tex called him a ""big dummy"", Connie sarcastically told Wash to give Maine a ""pat on the head"").  He sacrificed his health and his voice for his teammates, and was treated like shit for it. The only thing he ever got out of it was Sigma, and even that was just Carolina passing along the voice in her head to someone else and not a since act of compassion.  I believe that Sigma began to act on these feelings of being neglected and mistreated, and used them to turn Maine into the Meta. Of course, this is mostly assumption, but it's better than getting absolutely nothing about backstory despite being promised that for god's sake Burnie why didn't you keep your promise about Maine becoming the Meta"

RedvsBlue,3d9bq4,professionalecho,6,Tue Jul 14 14:58:56 2015 UTC,That makes sense!! Who is the chairman? And how did he get the Meta's armour?

We last properly saw him way back in season six as the guy the Director was writing letters to. His official position is the Chairman of the Oversight Committee, and it was his job to look over the ruins of Project Freelancer, and work out who needed to be arrested. As such, he took a lot of very important stuff from the Freelancer days as 'evidence'"
RedvsBlue,3d9bq4,ABashfulTurnip,11,Tue Jul 14 15:09:26 2015 UTC,"And a lot of that ""evidence"" can be seen in nice little display cases in his office, really appeals to the bond villain side of me."
RedvsBlue,3d9bq4,Dan_Of_Time,9,Tue Jul 14 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"Felix and Locus were part of a squad of soldiers fighting in the Great War. I imagine they were some sort of special ops kind of deal. When the war was over they couldn't adjust to civilian life, Locus has this ""soldier"" shit drilled into his head and Felix is a cock. They went on to put their unique skill set to mercenary work.  Sharkface was part of the insurrection fought by Project Freelancer. Wash and Carolina fucked him up and he went quiet as he was being healed and shiz.  As for the Meta, so far only Locus has expressed knowledge of him. He may have found out about him by reading the UNSC's report on Wash, likely obtained by the Chairman. He still doesn't know much about him though and we will see how this changed his actions in the future."
RedvsBlue,3d9bq4,ABashfulTurnip,7,Tue Jul 14 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"The mercenaries have all the old files and reports from project freelancer, so its not too much to assume they have at least a cliff's notes of what went down, plus before the meta was revealed to be Maine that was what all the reports called him after he carved ""We are the Meta"" into one of the walls of Outpost 17B. So seeing as Locus and Felix have both these and the counselor,  its not suprising that they know some things.   Not to mention that there was a freaking newspaper article of which some of the (minor) details were probably released to the general public in which case using the meta as a scapegoat probably would have worked out well for the reds and blues so they didn't get the chairman breathing down their necks about the ""Destruction of top secret, classified military technology."" Hell they blamed the pelican as well as everything else that happened in season 8 on him why not a little more."

Also turned out to be in charge of the freelancer competition in season 9 and 10  The meta is a collection of AI fragments they come together with the purpose of becoming a full AI.

Washington says in his first appearance ""that's the fifth agent in a month."" And it wasn't just agents he was killing, as proof by the trailer(s) he kills some random people and his attempting to kill the Reds and Blues.  The reason everyone knows about it is after the events of season 10, Project Freelancer (a Special Operations program) was brought to light for their illegal activities. The Alpha was hidden, the Freelancers went off in different directions, and the Meta started hunting them. Since the Meta was a product of the Director's illegal activities, he was a terror. Not just the Freelancers were being fucked with, but the UNSC. The insurrectionists were former UNSC soldiers and worked for the Chairman. Anyone with connections to the UNSC were no doubt informed of the possibility of a hostile. Everyone in the series is connected to the military in one way or another, minus the SIM troopers, but they found out the hard way.  TL;DR: The UNSC knew because of Project Freelancer's illegal activities, the Chairman hired UNSC soldiers. So everyone evolved with the UNSC would know about the Meta killing a lot of people in the UNSC. Top it off, they've had Aiden Price and the Chairman telling them about the Meta."

In the Meta symbol are the Greek letters Gamma, Sigma, Omega and Xi. We never see or hear from the AI Xi. And in that same system, the letters highlighted are the ones active at the time (and Iota... hmm). Eta, Alpha, and Beta are all muted. Alpha (Church) is hidden I'm guessing because the Director refuses to allow the fragments to speak of him. Beta (Tex) is muted because she's a secret, also. Theta isn't listed at all, even though he is active, he's even at the meeting.   So, honestly, it was either supposed to be the ""perfect"" combination in Sigma's calculations to reach the Meta state and Xi was just never made into a fragment/shown to us, or it really was just the most appealing symbol to Sigma to represent his agenda."

RedvsBlue,3d4fv6,kman273,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"Why I said that the fragments in the Meta's insignia would be the way to bring back Alpha, and why even after having all of those AI, Meta didn't stop the rampage.   At first I thought it was for the visual appeal, but after watching it this morning, it hit me that the optimal combination to rebuild Alpha."
RedvsBlue,3d4fv6,DarkRubberDucky,2,Mon Jul 13 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"But the Meta never had Xi. Maybe missing that one AI made it impossible to complete the perfect combination, so I guess they did go after them all to rebuild Alpha on the chance it created a full AI, though still not really reaching the Meta state, just becoming closer to a full AI.   Its all quite confusing since in Recovery One, Wash mentions the Meta killed five other agents in a short time span around the time of York and North's death. What AI would he have been after with those other agents since all the ones that appear around Delta are ones we see the apprehension of the others. Probably just retconned information."
RedvsBlue,3d4fv6,Libertyprime117,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:12:08 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. Meta was still looking for the last piece to the Alpha when he went after Project Freelancer's headquarters in Reconstruction. Epsilon wasn't necessary to rebuilding Alpha (and without memory, it would have been easier to convince the full AI that what they were doing was right or justified). However, Epsilon would have been able to tell them where the missing piece was."
RedvsBlue,3d4fv6,BananaGiraffe54,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:38:19 2015 UTC,"Xi...  Wild mad theory incoming, Florida was the A.I fragment Xi. Yes you heard me right, agent Butch flowers! Hear me out on this...:  Evidence in favour:   We never see ""love"" AI is in the flesh. We see it referenced in C.T.'s dog tag but was it really Eta or Iota? We don't see Coralina getting anymore lovely, if anything her relationship with York worsened. Florida, well he was love. That just doesn't need an explanation.  Florida is not a believable human being. Do you really buy a spec-ops solider being that nieve, benevolent and... just plain dumb? I don't. Red vs Blue has always taken a nuture>nature stance. Even Caboose is only that way because he was traumatised, had his mind invaded and his brain was deprived of oxygen. Why shouldn't Florida be the same? Flowers somehow was brought back from the dead, Despite what happens to a dead body. When you die your blood clots and rushes down to the bottom of your body, you can't have it come back like magic. I don't care if they 'don't treat life and death like we do'. Human blood colts sinks to the bottom of the body when you die. There was no way the alien could have brought back a human, only an A.I. enclosed in a robotic body could come back like that.   Evidence against:   The whole thing sounds very epileptic trees and is obviously not what the writers intended. However, so did season 6. And that was the best season ever; of all time. Florida was in season 9 before the Alpha seemed to be tortured. This is perhaps the biggest flaw in my theory. Yet, there is the fact that he never talked to be taken into account. Could Xi have only been implanted after the construction of an earlier, non-talking robotic Texas prototype? It would explain his quick change of attitude for the season 10 ending reveal.  Florida became more aggressive after possession by Omega. Church, didn't neither did he suddenly develop DID like Doc and Florida. This would indicate Flowers is probably human."

He compiled a simulation that Church was designed to fail, just like in seasons 9/10 This is assumed cannon by most of the community. Miles and Monty left hints of it throughout the freelancer prequels; so that really doesn't count.  As for the second point, Also, he didn't really seem affected by being possessed by the most nefarious, aggressive and omnicidal A.I. in existence. Just like Church...  Although, the possession explains why Omega could control a dead body, maybe he just controlled the armour and used the brain implant to allow Flowers to speak.

They talk about his eye injury as though it just happened and he was being released from the hospital the next day, but this can't be true because York was driving the Warthog when Maine got shot in the throat. Also, there is a scene with Tex, York, and North surrounded by Insurrectionists in the middle of a desert that was nowhere in the season."
RedvsBlue,3d32gu,Cardinal_Sizzle,9,Wed Jul 22 08:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always wondered how they could just be there.. My theory is that AI actually leave shadows in people after they leave/get EMPed, would explain a lot. Such as why people were concerned about Wash's mental state after Epsilon was gone, why Caboose said ""No... I can feel him..."" With regards to O'Malley when Omega was with Doc, why the Wash still called Maine ""Meta"" after Sigma was gone, and how Tex/Church could still be there. These shadows aren't big enough to run equipment, but are big enough to influence, which is why I believe whoever steps inside the Meta suit will go crazy."

I just need to get angry, and say, mean, things! Like... uh... Your brain is a mountain of hatred!   Sarge: I never thought I'd reach the moment in my life when I actually missed Grif... but here it is.   Caboose: Now. I, am, thinking, about... kittens! Guh, kit-tens, covered, in, spikes.

How you're now REFUSING to believe that his failure to run your equipment as a reason is because of limitations and treating it is an excuse? You know better than that Carolina.

But he makes some good points. But knowing what Carolina saw- everyone dying- is either going to make her more competitive to save them (a bad thing, we've already seen how that went with Sharkface) or she has to make a big change to herself.  Is Locus trying to act like a soldier? Clam and apparently collected (""says the pyschopath"") in the face of Felix having performance issues (don't worry, Tex had them too). And at least the trio aren't all sunshine and roses. The balance in this arc shifts with an engaging unpredictability.   Now we see if Doyle's going to make it to s14. I think that his death, witnessed by Kimball, will be the catalyst for her to openly accept the next leader of the Feds.  And finally, can we appreciate the wonderful music when Epsilon and Carolina are talking? I want it on a loop."

I'm fine with Locus trying to fracture Epsilon like the Meta, but nobody but Maine wears that armour.  So Epsilon says he isn't failing, huh? Yeah, I don't buy it.  Poor Carolina. Didn't think we saw that coming. Was she about to say ""Wash""?  Doyle is slowly becoming one of my favourite characters. He just got called a worthless excuse for a human being after doing the right thing, and what does he do? He goes to comfort someone else. You rock, Doyle, you rock. please don't get killed off  Everyone who shipped Doc/Gray? Here's fuel for the fire. Possibly the same for Wash/Carolina, depending on who she was about to name.  Also, I'm with Sharkface on this one. I'd like to see Felix try it, just so Sharkface can burn that fucker to death. It should be noted that Sharkface is the only one of the three who actually seems to be redeemable.  EDIT: Just realized that she already said Wash. Still, I guess people can still 'ship the two together.  On a side note, that's two more mentions of Maine to add to the list, so I guess I can add that as fuel for my ""Maine's still alive"" fire I've got going. It's interesting to note that while Locus's statement implies that he'll be using the Meta's methods in the future, Carolina's remark is a little less clear. She sounded very defensive, as we know that she feels responsible for his fate. If Maine is still alive—that's just an ""if"", put down your pitchforks—then this is something that I'd like to be explored a little more."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,-SpaceCommunist-,14,Mon Jul 13 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think Wash and Carolina would ever hook up, due to their past. He's too used to being directed by her in a military fashion to be comfortable/relaxed around her emotionally. And with her past with York still hard on her, added to having to see him die in the portal, I think that would weigh on her mind too much to start a new relationship, especially with someone like Wash.  I don't legitimately ship any of the current characters. None of them have any romantic chemistry, and their personalities clash too much for there to be a romance. Closest I've come to shipping is Kimball and Doyle, and right now, Kimball is getting on my tits.   *Edit for Honesty: I have in my head considered Grey and Wash.

RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Libertyprime117,15,Mon Jul 13 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"Really great episode. Amazing comedy at the beginning, such as ""Take yourself, fuck yourself, with yourself."" and ""Quiet, fish stick, the adults are talking.""  and the 1 minute scene at the end provided so many feels. The mercs are ready to kill each other. Locus sneaking behind his teammates' back to discuss the Meta makes me think he'll betray Felix for the Meta suit.  He could even become the Meta; The Meta still exists as long as the suit exists, by my theory of AI shadows. Anyone who steps in the Meta suit will actually become the Meta. If that does happen, then Felix and Sharkface would have to work together.. I do agree that there's going to be some betrayals on the Charon side, but I think it'll end up Locus betraying them for more power. Since his introduction, they've set up Locus as a ""Meta-like"" character, it's interesting that he wants to know more. One thing that hasn't been touched on much is the Counselor's/Sharkface's allegiances. I don't believe the Counselor hates the Reds and Blues, or even Wash and Carolina. I think he would want to give Wash a stern talking to. Other than that, nothing. All of them were misguided by the Director just like he was. The Chairman is worse than the Director;  He commits genocide to get alien artifacts. I can't imagine the Counselor actually wanting to kill everyone on Chorus, or even Wash/Carolina. Sharkface says he wants to kill Wash/Carolina, but if the Counselor talks to him about it, I think he'd reconsider. It's not their fault, they shouldn't be held accountable: They were just doing their job, they were misled to think that they were the good guys. Sharkface was misled by Charon into thinking that he was still working for the UNSC. Wash/Carolina don't deserve to die because the Director is a fucking douchebag. Thinking about this made me realize: Pretty much the only important characters in the entire series that weren't mislead by anyone were the Director and the Chairman, and they were the two who were doing the misleading."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,84981725891758912576,3,Mon Jul 13 06:38:07 2015 UTC,"It strikes me more as Locus might switch sides instead of betraying Felix and Sharkface for more power. Locus seems unsure of how long he can keep Felix and Sharkface from ripping each other to shreds, and to keep the mercenaries on task. I think he's trying to understand the Meta and what led to his defeat to avoid repeating the same mistake, and to understand what the Freelancers, the Reds and Blues had to go through. Locus has probably caught on that either Felix or Sharkface will want the Meta armor, which will inch them towards becoming the Meta, and Locus wants as much information as possible to try and fight back as best as he can.   Think of it. Over the last two seasons, we've witnessed: the reason for Locus' cold demeanor, dedication to the mission and his self-absolution of any responsibility as to what happens to the people he has killed; the first crack in his otherwise emotionless facade (""Just don't cry to me when you lose."" ""I won't."" ""lose, I-I won't lose.""); and his irrational (in his view) quest to understand Washington's humanity in being a soldier. His development as a character cannot be ignored. He keeps asking questions and trying to understand because he's finally beginning to think for himself, and he's realizing that he has been on the wrong path."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Rebyll,2,Tue Jul 14 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"I really hope you're right, but I'm not sure Locus is as redeemable as Sharkface at this point."

RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Rebyll,2,Tue Jul 14 13:48:14 2015 UTC,Eh. Locus has been shown time and time again as being sub-human emotionally. Sharkface is a lot more human just based on emotions alone. How much emotion a character is shown to be able to use determines redeemability as far as I've seen in movies.
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,JacksonSX35,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:29 2015 UTC,But the point is that Locus is beginning to let emotion into his sphere of attention and not shut his emotions off like he's been doing since the incident shown in the Gateway.
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Rebyll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"I remember the Counsellor saying that he would kill the people that ruined his life if it meant getting his old life back, or something like that. So, he does have a desire or willingness to kill, but it's left ambiguous who he's referring to. But yeah I agree, it was the Director who put everything in motion, and so he is the one responsible, not the Freelancers"
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Lemonhead_27,14,Tue Jul 14 11:52:47 2015 UTC,They're really hinting at a possible Locus vs Felix showdown or at least them arguing costing them big time.  That might lead up to sharkface being the last one left who fights Carolina.
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,thedoctorstig,5,Mon Jul 13 06:10:16 2015 UTC,The super suit shown earlier is going to be given to sharkface more than likely TBH
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,woesky,2,Tue Jul 14 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"It does seem that way, but locus is showing some interest in it. Sharkface might be happy with his flamethrower upgraded suit."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,thedoctorstig,2,Tue Jul 14 03:41:01 2015 UTC,"Still though, the idea was if you fail, you get killed. It seems unlikely the director will change his mind on that, although possible."

RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Animated95,8,Mon Jul 13 12:59:35 2015 UTC,Probably one of the space pirates who helps run the others when Locus and Felix are away.
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,JacksonSX35,3,Mon Jul 13 21:45:23 2015 UTC,Probably the pilot of the Tartarus

Her teaming up with Donut is a great choice. I'm going to assume that the Doc/O'Malley deal is a case of split personality stemming from Omega's previous presence and Doc's recent isolation, and they're NOT going to pull some crazy 'AI fragments and re-birth themselves' stuff....because that would be too much crazy.  I've probably mentioned this is previous posts but the Red-Blue banter is seriously on-point this season. I've been re-watching the show and I really think these past two seasons have hit a sweet spot between humor and drama.   Drama as in that Church-Carolina scene. Oopmh. Maine references hurt her. I liked the focus on the only reason Wash isn't dead is because Locus is 100% a raging lunatic. ""I can't lose another family"" : (  HOLY shit Felix. ""The grown-ups are talking"" Hahaha wow.  ""I want to know more about the Meta"" Well fuck there is absolutely no way that's a good thing. Does he want to know more to use the armour, or is this more ammunition against Wash?"

The only reason that she was chasing Doc was cause of OMalley, and being as intelligent as she is, she wanted to investigate it further. But, I have to say, the best part was the opening to the merc scene. ""I hope the mercs are as frustrated as us!"" ""I..AM EXTREMELY...FRUSTRATED!"""
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,Furbyeater,6,Mon Jul 13 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"Felix was on point this episode. I will say that Grey's line 'That only makes me want you more!' was taken out of context, but it also seemed to hint at it just enough to fuel the fire. Could be taken either way, I think it was an odd line for her anyway."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,JacksonSX35,5,Tue Jul 14 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"She's a sadist with a medical interest.  There's a multiple personality disorder right in front of her.  She wants him, just not in a sexual way.  More of a ""learn while torturing"" kind of way."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,AnAngryFetus,3,Tue Jul 14 05:38:48 2015 UTC,"I'd hesitate to call her a sadist, since she has consistently fixed people with no side effects. She's just slightly unhinged."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,JacksonSX35,8,Tue Jul 14 13:15:53 2015 UTC,"This episode really showed Doyle's leading trait: compassion. He cares about those he's allied with, and it shows here.   Doc and Grey play off each other so well, and I think Donut and Grey have a great little 'competition' going for Doc.   Palomo. Master of insults. And schooling.   Felix had humor on point here, and it shows just how far gone he is. Locus is… another matter entirely. I'm not sure what direction he's taking the Meta idea, but it's not gonna end well in any case.   This is just getting me more hyped for the finale."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,JacksonSX35,2,Tue Jul 14 02:43:01 2015 UTC,I don't see that. Locus never focused on Carolina. He's much more fixated on wash.
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,JacksonSX35,5,Tue Jul 14 03:39:39 2015 UTC,"""I want to know more about The Meta.""  Every time, without fail, the opening seconds of his theme send chills down my spine."
RedvsBlue,3d2mv6,nodnarb232001,3,Tue Jul 14 03:44:43 2015 UTC,"So, while my first inclination with [Put Spoiler Here](/""Tell me more about The Meta"") was to think that Locus wants to be Maine 2.0, I just had another thought:  What better way to hit Wash where it hurts than with info about Maine? Their S8 relationship was the low point of Wash in his own opinion. Even without the armor, Locus and Wash's next encounter will focus heavily on that. If it happens"

However, again like the Counselor, I believe it will come into play. Personally, I think it would be a plot point if Epsilon begins fragmenting instead of outright failing."
RedvsBlue,3cwfv0,-SpaceCommunist-,11,Sat Jul 11 13:03:37 2015 UTC,"Most likely it was confiscated by the UNSC. I mean, It could theoretically be Nigel VIRGIL from ODST. That would be funny."
RedvsBlue,3cwfv0,Dan_Of_Time,5,Sat Jul 11 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"If it was confiscated by the UNSC, doesn't that leave the possibility that it was on the dropship that crashed on Chorus?"
RedvsBlue,3cwfv0,Anathe,6,Sat Jul 11 16:58:58 2015 UTC,Considering the time difference I would doubt it. Considering the time of PFL going down it's likely the engineer was released or looked after. It may have been killed by the UNSC if deemed dangerous.
RedvsBlue,3cwfv0,Dan_Of_Time,5,Sat Jul 11 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"Well, there were two falls of Project Freelancer. The first was after the break-in, but as the Director said, they recovered. The second was after Reconstruction, when PFL assets were seized by the UNSC, the Counselor arrested, and the Director hunted down.  I guess it comes down to this: did the Director need the Engineer to continue to make/fragment the Beta AI in order to make his Robot Tex Army?"
RedvsBlue,3cwfv0,Anathe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"Presumably he did, as even someone with the level of skill using all equipment (cough cough sniper rifle) that L. Church has/had would need a little hand"

Staying with the project because she knew nothing of the Alpha and his torture, and she even felt guilty about that. (Listen to her tone in season 6 and recovery one compared to seasons 9 and 10.)

RedvsBlue,3cwlb9,-SpaceCommunist-,5,Sat Jul 11 13:07:51 2015 UTC,"Sharkface is motivated by a desperate need for revenge stemming from the loss of his family.  At least, the UNSC troops he was serving with when the Freelancers came and killed all but him.  He sees Carolina and Washington, both of whom were the ones who took him down, as the way to get revenge for his dead family.  Because of that, he's more than willing to do whatever it takes to kill them.  To him, there's nothing left but revenge, and Charon Industries have offered him just that."

Since Epsilon is too old to run the suit they might try to capture Santa to run the suit because he is a more advanced A.I. If the trailer holds true Church will die because Carolina tries to stretch his limits too far and he will die in the last one or two episodes of the season. Or like he said in the trailer ""I fought both beside them and against them, and against them when I was supposed to be beside them"" this makes me think that somehow and for whatever reason the pirates capture Epsilon and reprogram him or brainwash him into fighting for them.

RedvsBlue,3cp58d,Chaantheman13,10,Fri Jul 10 06:26:41 2015 UTC,"Felix figures out what Santa is and is able to capture him.  Chairman Hargrove tortures Santa and uses one of his fragments to run the Meta suit.  As a reward for capturing him, Hargrove gives Felix the Meta suit with one of Santa's fragments running it. And it will be hella cool to see someone so talkative in it.  Felix is able to use the Meta suit to kill Doyle.  So now Felix has the Meta suit and an AI able to run all of its enhancements, as well as a sword/key.   Somewhere along the line, Felix betrays Locus, who has gradually realized the error of his ways. The Reds and Blues have to stop Felix from setting off the purge and Locus decides to help them.  It also turns out that the Counselor is actually working against Hargrove. He reveals this to Sharkface, who only then finds out that Washington and Carolina actually turned against Project Freelancer. He forgives them and joins the Reds and Blues to stop Felix while the Counselor goes undercover with Hargrove.  The Reds and Blues, Locus, and Sharkface stop and kill Felix.  They also save Santa, with Epsilon giving its life to do so. There's a beauty to this, with Epsilon able to save Santa from the very same suffering he experienced.  Santa, now having been brought in to these human affairs, joins the Reds and Blues.  But Hargrove gets away and goes on the run. Season 14 focuses on the Reds and Blues chasing Hargrove, picking up alien gifts and tearing apart Hargrove's web of allies along the way.   Locus and Sharkface go their own ways, remaining characters that can be brought back in future seasons.  Carolina stays with the Reds and Blues, and in Season 14 leads them after Hargrove. This parallels her leading them to find the Director in Season 10, but we see her now able to lead more effectively and more comfortably."

I dont actually want this, if it means losing Wash as a character, but i can see it going that way."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,DarkRubberDucky,4,Thu Jul 9 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Felix will promote Sharkface to his ""Number 2"" for killing (they think) Carolina and finding the sword. He'll do this by offing Locus. The Reds and Blues need to make a call from the Temple of Communication. Since they'll have the best soldiers with them, Doyle comes along. The Mercs discover that they need to kill Doyle, and that he's going to the temple. Our finale is a battle at the temple of communication, with the Reds, Blues, and Team Lieutenants defending it. One of Team Lieutenants will die. My money is on Palomo, although Bitters and Jensen may also die - Andersmith is the one I think will live. Epic Felix vs. Tucker sword fight. Similarly epic Wash vs. Sharkface rematch. Carolina is tasked with defending the transmission center (where Epsilon is sending the message) along with Doyle. Sharkface and/or Felix make their inside, where they kill Carolina. That's the meaning of Epsilon's ""This is the story of how I died"" from the trailer - we know from his experience with Wash that two minds sharing a space can get hairy if one dies, and Epsilon will experience death firsthand when Carolina is killed to save Doyle. Sharkface MAY off Felix to get the Meta armor. Or, perhaps they like Felix enough to keep him around. I'm conflicted on this point. The Meta's armor was a red herring... for this season. It'll come into play for the next story arc. Doyle will die, but not before proving his worth to Kimball, who reconciles with the Feds to lead Chorus. Grif continues to fail to get a signature weapon. Tl;dr: Villains develop a chronic backstabbing disorder, deaths make you cry, Grif still sucks, Red team for life.   Deaths I'm certainly calling: Palomo, Locus, Doyle  Deaths I think are likely: Carolina or Epsilon, Jensen or Bitters, Felix."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,Kriegerbot01,4,Thu Jul 9 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"Funny, I'm getting the feeling Felix is going to die and Kimball, too. She's getting far too Carolina meets Agent South. She's pushing all the wrong buttons with everyone and getting into villain mean.  Doyle may die, too, but a lot of the times RT will give subtle emotions about the characters they kill off (after season 5 mostly). With York, Tex warns him, and since at the time he wasn't any kind of a main or important character, you figured he'd die. South was getting to be too much trouble, and she was revving up her attitude. CT, lots of somber music played, she was in a situation she couldn't have escaped without having the Director on her forever. (And she died, but the build up to why Wash kept calling ""him"" a ""she"" was fantastically executed.)  Doyle, Kimball and Felix are the only ones I'm getting the ""they are going to die"" vibe from. And even Kimball and Doyle are kind of up in the air for me."

RedvsBlue,3cp58d,Firebat12,5,Sat Jul 11 05:04:57 2015 UTC,"Theory #1: Epsilon sacrifices himself to kill the Meta Suit, similar to Alpha did in s6, and similar to HALO 4 SPOILERS: Cortana did.  s14 would be about reviving Epsilon, via finding out that the Director is actually still alive.    This theory really came from the trailer, where I thought about how fucked Epsilon was. AIs only last 7-8 years, and since he's a fragment, and one that was designed to fail.... Well, it's insane that he's lasted this long. And the guy who he's based off is presumed dead, so they can't get Church back. Unless, one of two possibilities: A: The Chairman has tech that can get equipment back after EMPed. This would explain F.I.L.S.S. being alive, and all AI could be recovered. The other possibility is that the Chairman swooped in as soon as Carolina left, took F.I.L.S.S and the Director, a nd therefore he can be rescued. Theory #2: Epsilon goes rampant and infects Doyle, and activates the Purge. Most of the population on Chorus die, but the BGC leave on a ship.        This one doesn't have much behind it, I just think it would be intriguing to have Epsilon as a sort of Frenemy. Theory #3: The season ending/post credit sequence is Sharkface going inside the Meta suit, and the Chairman says something like, ""How do you feel?"" And Sharkface says, ""Fine,"" as he growls and kills the Chairman.      This one is based off a theory that AI leave shadows of themselves behind if they get EMPed or removed, evidenced by people still being worried about Wash after Epsilon was gone, Caboose saying ""I can feel him(Omega)"" and Meta still rampaging after Sigma was gone. All the shadows of AI would compel the user to kill everything to get Epsilon."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,Furbyeater,3,Thu Jul 9 18:09:25 2015 UTC,Director ain't alive. Sorry. All the evidence we've seen has confirmed it. Plus I think he deserves to be dead. He devoted his life to replicating the woman he loved and never once succeeded. Thats really fucking depressing. If he was still alive he'd be trying to off himself.
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,NitroMagmaFlash,0,Sat Jul 11 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"What evidence? I definitely think it is possible that the Director is dead, but there is a ton of evidence to the contrary, namely F.I.L.S.S being alive."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,009reloaded,2,Sat Jul 11 05:02:40 2015 UTC,"Hargrove may have found a way to reverse the Director deleting all of Freelancer's files but he can't bring the Director himself back to the living. He's dead and he ain't coming back. He had Carolina leave him her pistol, he locked himself in a secure facility, and basically removed life support. He is gooooonnneeee."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,NitroMagmaFlash,2,Sat Jul 11 09:32:25 2015 UTC,"Thats a completely differnt thought though. Ais arent people. An Ai can be recovered, restored or even remade. Especially a more human programmed AI like FLISS. We hear the gun shot go off. We know that Hargrove has to recover FLISS somehow and again why would he be alive. It wasnt like the reds or blues killed him and we cant find the body. He was depressed and shot himself. I just don't see a reason to keep him alive. The dude had his time and he used it."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,Spieler42,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:02:57 2015 UTC,This actually sounds pretty probable. Except for #2. That might  be probable but that sounds terrifying.
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,Furbyeater,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"I like your Epsilon sacrificing himself for his squadron theory but it has a few holes in it i would like to poke at. As I stated in a previous comment, there's no way the actual Leonard Church is actually still alive. After the Director deleted all Freelancer's files, he locked himself in a secure facility with no life support and his daughter's pistol. I don't think there's any other alternative from that point besides suicide. Your #1 makes sense, Hargrove has found a way to get equipment back from being affected by the electromagnetic pulse. But the Director isn't a gadget. And plus, maybe this was a recent discovery. Maybe the loss of the fragments were deemed unrecoverable due to how long ago it happened. And, in addition to your second point in your first theory, it's just as well probable that the Director killed himself the second FILSS deleted herself and Carolina and Epsilon walked out the door.   As seen in Halo 4, I don't think the rampancy would cause Epsilon to so that. It's highly probable but when an AI goes rampant, it's usually a short burst of anger that could be catastrophic, and that sounds like it would have to be thought through. Also, Epsilon is a fragment. He may have memories of the other AI's, or his brothers, but he is a fragment of Alpha. For all any of us know, the deterioration of a fragmented AI could just be a failure of equipment as seen before and then just eventual shut down, not the full blown rampancy we have seen in Halo 4 by Cortana. Also, the entire Chorus saga said that they couldn't leave on a ship, they would be shot down. Granted, there might be some opportunity for the BGC to escape in all the commotion, but I don't think it's likely.   Hargrove doesn't even know Sharkface has joined up with Felix and Locus. He told them about the Meta suit, not him. Well, for now. And the reason people still worry about Caboose and Washington is because those AI's did some serious shit to their minds. Omega actually made Caboose more stupid. Caboose isn't used to that level of evil or hatred. And Epsilon literally went insane inside Washington, driving Wash insane with him. The reason people ask that is because being temporarily insane by a crazy ass AI remembering the memories of it's original might be a little damaging to your psyche. These examples are with people who have been implanted with the AI's to negative effect. Shark face has never been implanted with an AI. In addition to that, the fall would've probably wiped out any equipment the Meta had with him."
RedvsBlue,3cp58d,hubbledog,2,Sat Jul 11 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't see this post until after I made a post with my theory, so I'll just put it here too:  So remember in the first episode of Season 13 where the Counselor talks to Felix and Locus about the Freelancer Agents? He says this:   Did you know Agent Washington refuses Artificial Intelligence access to his neural implants? Or that Agent Carolina’s 57% more likely to neglect her teammates when presented with a competitive scenario?   We've seen Carolina's quirk come up, with her running away from her team to find the key. Does that mean there might be a point where Washington has to take an A.I. and he refuses? Sure, it might just be (and probably is) a throwaway line about the Epsilon incident to show what the Counselor knew, but one thing he mentioned came into play, why not both? I think there might be a point where Wash has to take Epsilon from Carolina (or just retrieve Santa, I dunno) and he just can't? Especially with his previous experience with the Epsilon A.I., it's gonna be hard to even make him consider taking it. It might even be related to Epsilon dying (though highly unlikely), where Wash blames himself for it. I haven't seen this theory around, and there might be something I'm missing and I'm being stupid, but please leave comments with thoughts or counter-theories!  Edit: spelling"

But, Charon, Hargrove and whoever he's working with are so well connected, so integral to the running of the UNSC, that it results in a full blown civil war. Season 13 is the end of the Chorus trilogy, but the beginning of the larger Charon conflict.  Epsilon isn't dying.. kinda.. Epsilon dies, but Epsilon is just a blank slate that the ""memories"" exist within. Epsilon will die, but only because it's being pulled apart.  Epsilon dies, and the memory of Alpha, Delta, Theta, etc all become independent A.I. Same way the memory of Tex was able to operate separate from Epsilon.  Unfortunately, this means Omega and Sigma are also back. They escape and team up with Charon.   Sigma promises Hargrove that, if he helps them capture the other A.I. fragments, he will achieve metastability, and will help run the Meta suit. A metastable A.I. outclasses whatever newer A.I. Hargrove can hope to get, and he won't be able to what with the civil war breaking out.   But, rather than go the route of Maine, and have all their eggs in one basket, Sigma and Omega split up and join with Felix and Locus. Once all the A.I. fragments are captured, they'll begin the recreation of the Meta.  Meanwhile, the Reds and Blues get the other A.I. fragments shared amongst them (along with Santa) and the prepare to fight in the civil war, but this time it's real rather than Red vs Blue."

He would need to feel that working with Hargrove would be a good idea, maybe indoctrination? ""We need to steel these weapons to save humanity from the covenant. They're not doing anything here."" Delta was based on the director, who was an even greater 'End>means.'"

I think it would be interesting to see Omega partnered with someone who would be willing to endulge Omega's anger.  Similarly, Sigma was only really a part of the Meta. We never saw him on his own until the season 10 flashbacks.  Anyway,  the way I see it, all the Reds and Blues will be there for Epsilon's ""death."" Then all the A.I. wi be reborn at the same time. The two of them will have only a short amount of time to escape. Omega will jump into someone, grab Sigma, and escape before the superior numbers can stop them.  Then they'll go to Charon.   Their motive is to become metastsble, but what will they do after that? They might as well agree to work with Charon. What else would they do but hang around being metastable?"

I think he's ok with joining Sigma in becoming metastable, since a metastable A.I. would be able to do what it wants.  The Reds and Blues aren't going to want him since they know they can't control him. He can either stay with them and get locked away, or join Charon and be part of the greatest civil war ever.  And I don't think Doc really has Omega with him. I think it's just how his insanity manifests itself.  Imagine if I'm right, and Omega takes over Doc to escape. Then there's Doc, Doc's insanity version of Omega and the real Omega. XD"

Doyle was a secretary to a brigadier, he clearly has no taste for battle or leadership but he is doing it anyway because he has to. He is also not a coward, despite what Kimball says.   He went after the key with no escort and did tried to throw it away, but he was simply no fast enough due to Felix manipulating him  Kimball is also far too headstrong and isn't learning from her mistakes. She keeps walking into traps because she thinks she failed by trusting Felix and wants to make up for it.  Doyle at least knows that he is flawed and ill-suited for command but he's trying.

After all, she was just a junior officer who got tossed into commanding an army; maybe that wasn't so bad when you had a united force and a clear enemy, but now you're not quite sure who the real enemy is, you can't get any good strikes in on them, and half your army is now people who, a couple of months ago, were your worst enemies. And they aren't entirely sure they want to be working with you either.  So did Kimball go overboard? Yeah, she did. Doyle did about as good as he could have in that situation, and him killing himself wouldn't have accomplished anything more. But is it because she's secretly a terrible person or something? No, it's because she's a flawed person (like everybody else in the show) under an enormous amount of stress and guilt. Doesn't make her a bad person. Just makes her human."

Get the glimpse of what Locus used to be from that hallucination in the 'gateway', and realize it was a more compressed and less subtle echo of what Agent Washington (as Recovery One) had become.   He'd been idealistic, devoted, but the revelations from the Epsilon Unit turned that around. Making him more comfortable as being flawed so long as he could finish at the end he figured was necessary - bringing down Project Freelancer and the Director. Such an attitude got kicked in the face again when it turned out Epsilon wasn't delivered to the UNSC like the plan had been, and instead was kept by the Blood Gulch Crew . . . unintentionally messing up all of Wash's expected results.   Which drove him to dive deeper into the ""the ends are going to justify the means"" during season 8, and his deal with the Chairman. ""It will all be worth it if I can pull this off.""  I mean, we went from idealistic Wash (""The Director?! He's helping us!"") to jaded Wash (""Wash, you can't go killing everyone you meet."" ""Why not?"") to redemption seeker (""I've already been responsible for enough of their problems in the past, and I'll be damned before I let you cause any more."")

The most telling exchange should be the confrontation after York nearly got his face blown off.  Wash was outraged that Wyoming and Maine had broken regulations at the expense of a teammate, and then instead of punishing them, or at least calling them to heel, the Director berated the whole team, and got right in Wash's face for suggesting that what the other two Freelancers did was wrong.  In fact, we see York's broken helmet and the Director says ""Ingenuity and adaptability are admirable trait"" - York's injury wasn't even acknowledged by the Director.  York was at this time #2 on the board, as Tex wasn't there yet, and just as importantly, he was Wash's friend.  Wash was in shock - ""I can't believe this.""  He fully believed that the Director would do the right thing, and as soon as he saw that live ammo was being used on the floor - he even said someone should get him, so he would stop it.  To find that he didn't - even beyond that, that he took the rest of the Freelancers to task for suggesting that what Wyoming and Maine was anything less than admirable - that rocked Wash.    So yes.  Idealistic is a very good word to describe him at that time."

RedvsBlue,3ckq74,Forikorder,2,Thu Jul 9 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"But you haven't addressed it as false either, only listed it as conjecture. Which you haven't refuted at all except to suggest it may not be so.   If you wish more evidence, it should be considered what the other Freelancers were like. Agent Washington is perhaps one of the few Freelancers who was less concerned about the leaderboard and more about the mission goals or personal goals (of the ones we have seen).  South was nursing an inferiority complex, North was devoted to sticking around his sister, Texas had to be the biggest badass in the room, a trait shared with Carolina who was used to that until Texas showed up.   Of the others, York was easily one of the others who valued teamwork and actually working with others without needing to shine. Wyoming was a bit of a coward but definitely focused on getting things done. Florida visibly was trustworthy and capable even if not being anywhere near the leaderboard during the two seasons we could see it.   Washington was much like York, only decidedly less polished in any singular skill. He was still capable enough, something which could be seen much later when he wasn't being outshone by other Freelancers. But he cared less about being a badass, and more about finishing what he was supposed to be doing. (Or chose to be doing, as the case was for Season 6-8.)  It's obvious in the early stages his ideals are what guides him until he loses faith in them in Season 7. He has the ideal of bringing the Director to answer for what he did to the Alpha AI after seeing what happened. (And feeling a lot of the broken-ness himself when implanted with Epsilon.)   So it's fairly evident to me he was idealistic and impressionable to start the Freelancer program as he did, but got jaded as things went horribly . . . horribly wrong once the ""Insurrection"" was put out of the picture. And it wasn't until Carolina came back he started to figure out where he really wanted to stand.  Is that better?"
RedvsBlue,3ckq74,Kereminde,0,Thu Jul 9 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"only Carolina and south ever seemed to care about the board (well CT a bit too but more the reason of its existance and less her position on it and south was just angry she got demoted and didnt really show much obsession with moving up it)   It's obvious in the early stages his ideals are what guides him until he loses faith in them in Season 7.   just because you say something is obvious doesnt mean its actually obvious, wash barely got any screen time in the flashbacks, and 90% of it was just for gags you cant say any of that with any certainty  so far your not actually showing any evidence, you have one line from wash, which is terrible evidence, and you have him being a team player, like all the Freelancers were aside from Carolina and Tex (South was a rash idiot but she still worked with people properly)"

RedvsBlue,3ckq74,Forikorder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:28:16 2015 UTC,"When it comes to Locus and Wash being similar, if you look at Locus' portal nightmare, he is acting like Wash. He's told to kill the being, but instead of blindly following, he questions, reasons that the being couldn't understand them, thus not feeling it appropriate to kill it.  That one moment is driving me crazy because that showed Locus wasn't like Felix. Didn't kill just because he was ordered (at first). That he had sympathy, empathy, for a being he knew nothing about.  Wash would have done the exact same. And Wash, in season 8 was kind of a dickhead. He shot Donut without remorse, to get closer to freedom (from the Chairman, how interesting).  The difference is that Locus hasn't had the good influence Wash has had from the Reds and Blues. They accepted him at the end of 8, instead of turning him in, instead of killing him, they accept him and he gets to spend three months with them, mostly free of pressure until Carolina shows up. But he still holds onto that friendship the Reds and Blues have shown him.  Locus, meanwhile, has had only Felix, his friend/enemy/companion, or friendenemepanion, who is fucking crazy and all too happy to kill everyone and enjoys it. Locus doesn't take joy in killing, he just does it, much like Wash in s8. Then Locus is under the thumb of the Chairman, who is obvious pretty exacting in his expectations.   Hopefully, we get more insight on Locus, or he at least remains a character we can come back to in future seasons. I'm expecting, honestly, for Felix to die. But I feel Locus has to opportunity to evolve like Wash did. Not to the same extent as Wash (seriously, dude used to be a goof ball. Doubt Locus was that loosey goosey) but maybe he can at least see reason in not being a ""perfect soldier"". He follows protocol as strictly as the Counselor does in s9 and s10."

RedvsBlue,3ch49i,Chaantheman13,19,Tue Jul 7 21:31:39 2015 UTC,It's not going to be the end of Red vs. Blue. There is no reason to think it would be.
RedvsBlue,3ch49i,alynnidalar,3,Tue Jul 7 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"Business-wise it makes no sense. ""Let's get rid of our money-making, trademark series that brought us to where we are so that we could make other money making trademark series"" this is the response ""Hahahaha good one"""
RedvsBlue,3ch49i,Firebat12,-1,Sat Jul 11 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"The only reason i thought it would end is because of what Hargrove said at the end of episode one ""All good things must come to an end"""

As for it being the end of Red vs. Blue, they've actually made a site about it: Are you making more Red vs. Blue?"
RedvsBlue,3ch49i,standrew5998,3,Wed Jul 8 00:13:49 2015 UTC,Nice. I love the text. Only way it could be more appropriate is if they used comic sans to type it.

RedvsBlue,3c9z0f,omar104,3,Mon Jul 6 19:22:28 2015 UTC,Dude. It's too early for a feels trip sniffle  VERY well written though :)
RedvsBlue,3c9z0f,omar104,2,Mon Jul 6 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"Why thank you. I was going to have it from Caboose's point of view, but I had already written most of it by then, and I couldn't figure out how to write as him with his mental deficiency."
RedvsBlue,3c9z0f,omar104,2,Mon Jul 6 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"Dude. I just thought of something potentially brilliant that could run parallel to this. Maybe I should write one where Carolina and Church make it out, but the Reds and the blues don't, or where Church survives but Carolina doesn't. Let me know what you think!"
RedvsBlue,3ca15x,stolersxz,7,Mon Jul 6 07:19:40 2015 UTC,Well it's not actually canon. It's just a tribute song like A Girl Named Tex.
RedvsBlue,3ca15x,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cuz in A Girl Named Tex her name is supposed to be Beth, but canon states it's Allison. Sooo, it's a cool song, I totally dig it. But it shouldn't be taken as anything serious or what roosterteeth intends for Sarge's backstory, if they even give him one."
RedvsBlue,3ca15x,MarkNUUTTTT,-7,Tue Jul 7 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"Not to be a dick, but I thought it was pretty obvious that the song was about Sarge"
RedvsBlue,3ca15x,Tmlboost,4,Mon Jul 6 07:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah i know, i was just trying to summarise what the description of the song was on the trocadero website/Wikipedia"
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,LavastormSW,14,Mon Jul 6 08:19:51 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that just be half of season 9 and 10 before everything else?
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,ThaGreatIsaiah,7,Mon Jul 6 11:28:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah...   Really other than those scenes in season 9 and 10 and some short sequences everywhere else, it's all pretty chronological."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,MNGaming,6,Mon Jul 6 11:31:02 2015 UTC,Yeah but watching the pure Freelancer glory all in one go without the Reds' and Blues' dumb bickering interspersed would be amazing.
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,Midnightapalooza,0,Mon Jul 6 16:47:03 2015 UTC,You're dumb!
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,07jonesj,2,Thu Jul 9 15:24:52 2015 UTC,MIA would be placed between episodes 7 and 8 of Season 9.
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,OtakuMecha,5,Mon Jul 6 12:36:53 2015 UTC,Actually I think MIA just takes places on another level of memory recursion before the one we see in S9 (he's said he's had to go through it all several times). The Reds and Blues work together in that one which doesn't dovetail as well with the loop shown in S9.
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,theYOLOdoctor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:37:19 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed the multiple times were original Leonard Church, Church-Alpha, Epsilon-Alpha, and Epsilon in the Memory Unit."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,OtakuMecha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"No. Burnie has talked about this. Epsilon undergoes recursion in the memory unit where he lives out all his memories then gets to the part where he gets trapped in the unit again which takes him down another level. We aren't sure how many times he's been through the same general memories trying to find a way to keep from losing Tex, but we know it's been at least a few times by the time we see him in S9."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,theYOLOdoctor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"Really? I had no idea about that actually, where did he say this?"
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,ZachGuy00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:45:41 2015 UTC,He said that's something that might happen but it never did. Or at least we never saw it on screen.
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,iPlayNL,2,Wed Jul 8 17:18:54 2015 UTC,Out of Mind and recovery one would have to be placed between 4-5-6 as well.
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,alynnidalar,2,Mon Jul 6 12:55:14 2015 UTC,"Technically, Out of Mind takes place partly in parallel with the end of season 4/the beginning of season 5, and Recovery One probably overlaps with the end of season 5. But it's not clear exactly when/how."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,lordolxinator,3,Mon Jul 6 17:43:19 2015 UTC,Or at least can someone list what seasons/episodes to watch in chronological order?
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,alynnidalar,8,Mon Jul 6 11:30:20 2015 UTC,"It gets confusing because there's a couple of flashbacks in BGC that are contradicted by later things we saw--especially the stuff from Out of Mind.  But ignoring that, as far as order goes, it would be:  Prequel parts of season 9  Prequel parts of season 10  Out of Mind flashbacks (which are not canonical/can be excused as screwed-up memories) are sometime after S09E10 (when Tex is introduced) and probably S10E19 (when Tex and York start attacking the MoI)  Season 1  Season 2  Season 3 (the time travel stuff was a simulation by Gamma and didn't ""actually"" happen, so there's no need to watch it in a different order)  Season 4 up to episode 71 (when Tex leaves)  Everything else from Out of Mind (technically parallel with what follows)  The rest of season 4 (interesting side note, if you pay close attention to the passage of time and what people say about it, the Blood Gulch parts must be taking place later than the quest stuff--otherwise, the timeline doesn't match up at all!)  Season 5  Recovery One (may overlap with the end of season 5, but it's unclear)  Reconstruction (Season 6)  Relocated (miniseries)  Recreation (Season 7) and Revelation (Season 8)  ""modern-day"" parts of seasons 9 and 10  Seasons 11, 12, and 13  However, I wouldn't suggest a new viewer watch it this way, because there's significant stuff that's contradicted/reinterpreted/retconned later on. So watching it in the order it's released is the preferred viewing order for newcomers, IMO."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,DarkRubberDucky,6,Mon Jul 6 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that newcomers should watch it in release-date order, not chronological. I don't think they really had any idea where it was going when they started it, so a lot of stuff was retconned, etc, like you said. BUt for someone who's watched it multiple times (like myself) it'd be interesting to watch it in chronological order."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,lordolxinator,2,Mon Jul 6 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"Eh, major comic fans don't complain about Retcon info, why should we...  Though, I would love to have an explaination of Tex stealing Church's money and sleeping with other guys. That never fit her personality, even in the original 5 seasons. I just chalk that up to Church being bitter."
RedvsBlue,3ca59m,thedankbank1021,2,Fri Jul 10 06:23:36 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is, in seasons 9 and 10 there are scenes in each episode that take place in different time periods from each other. One is the ""present,"" and one is the ""past,"" showing what happened to the freelancers, so you'd have to watch only parts of each episode and jump around."
RedvsBlue,3c8v5c,ClubsDalek,4,Mon Jul 6 00:03:42 2015 UTC,"I wish more people would watch his reviews, they're really good."

RedvsBlue,3c3f4i,ChickadeeAce,11,Sat Jul 4 11:26:23 2015 UTC,"She wasn't given Sigma prior to Maine, Wash probably thought she would be distracted knowing she didn't have one.  As for the fight I think Carolina was just distracted about fighting Tex. She probably listened to York but didn't want to seem weak."
RedvsBlue,3c3f4i,Dan_Of_Time,3,Sat Jul 4 12:17:40 2015 UTC,"While I'm willing to believe that she didn't have one, I don't understand why anyone, Wash in this case, would think she would be distracted by that.  If she never had one, there's nothing to really put her off.  Sigma's comment (with barbs in) about how she could excel even without an AI was spot on.  There is nothing we've ever seen of Carolina in Season 9 to suggest that simply not getting an AI would slow her down in the least.  Did he really think that just disappointment would distract her from the mission?  Not likely, which is why I was wondering if there was more to Wash's comment, something more to account for why he'd be so concerned.  Also, for what it's worth, we only see them install one ""port"" or whatever it might be called that they plug the AI into in the back of Carolina's head.  I would have expected them to show them doing two installs - they only do one, though there are two plugs on the tray.  Definitely could be that they install, plug, install, plug... but since they don't show it, can't say for sure."
RedvsBlue,3c3f4i,84981725891758912576,9,Sun Jul 5 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"She was acting really strange after getting Eta and Iota. She immediately says ""I want a match"" after waking up. Preparing for the match, she doesn't even talk to York who is giving her instructions. After the match, she gets really upset for really the first time at the Director, and says that she can't give up her AI. Then, she mindlessly chases Tex. We don't know much about Eta and Iota, but maybe they weren't trustworthy, and they influenced her like Sigma?"
RedvsBlue,3c3f4i,DarkRubberDucky,3,Sat Jul 4 14:44:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think she was acting strange at all, not in the state of mind she was in.  The whole reason she got the AI in the first place was specifically to test herself against Tex.  She was obsessed with proving that she should be back on top of the scoreboard.  And I don't find it surprising at all that she would blow up at the Director - she finally has what she believes will put her back on equal footing with Tex, and the Director wants to take it away from her.  This is totally in line with the behaviour she's been exhibiting since mid Season 9, where she was afraid of losing her #1 position to Tex from the moment she first saw her in the training session against York, Wyoming, and Maine.    Mindlessly chases Tex?  No.  I'd say the exact opposite.  She has plenty of reasons to chase her, and has rationalized in her head that she is the one that is doing the right thing.  She isn't doing this without giving it thought.  Problem is, she's thought about it, obsessively thought about it, but come to all the wrong conclusions.  This was all on the wall in huge red block letters before Eta and Iota even existed."
RedvsBlue,3c3f4i,DarkRubberDucky,7,Sun Jul 5 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"She was never implanted with Sigma, though he was made for her (I'm guessing the Director paid just enough attention to notice how ambitious she was). However, since they needed the Sarcophagus to make the AI fragments, and Maine was shot getting the Sarcophagus, when Sigma was created, she passed up the chance to have him so that Maine could communicate.   The reason she ignores York is likely for the combo of her thinking too much of herself to need help and being focused on taking on her biggest rival, for both her rank and her father's attention.   So, basically, Tex showing up really fucked with Carolina's head. Instead of being the best of a team, though still worrying about her team, she had to be the best, period.   Carolina likely does know the process of accepting an AI, since they had to take the classes and she was all to willing to learn, but Carolina's pride really gets in the way of her doing the smart thing."
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,22,Fri Jul 3 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"I think Monty also did the scene in Season 7 where Epsilon does the ""laser face"" to kill CT, but yeah, that was the first major reveal of Monty's incredible animating on RvB."
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,Belisarius25,11,Fri Jul 3 13:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one thing I've noticed is that, only 5 minutes after the Warthog scene (all seasons on Netflix are split up into volumes, not episodes) is that the show seems to be making a very quick transition towards animation over Machinima, and I like it. It adds a lot more possibilities as to what characters can actually do, removing the limitations of Machinima."
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,beregond23,17,Fri Jul 3 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Seasons 8-10 got pretty crazy with the animation so expect many awesome fight sequences. They've toned it back a little for 12-13, but I'd almost say the story is better this season than it was in 10... anyway enjoy"
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,AMeowingCat,8,Fri Jul 3 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"Man, I just watched the fight scene with Tex vs Everyone and yes, I think I'm going to like these fight sequences."
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,spiral6,5,Fri Jul 3 15:32:02 2015 UTC,Oh yeah you're gonna love the next two seasons
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,alynnidalar,3,Fri Jul 3 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Monty also did Meta's color change transition in Season 6, which according to the director commentary is his first Red vs. Blue contribution."
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,spiral6,3,Fri Jul 3 17:51:04 2015 UTC,You sure about that? I thought they said the laser face was his first shot on the show and the Meta's color change was some in-game trick.
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,Mercer8878,2,Fri Jul 3 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Nope, Meta's color change was done in Maya, and was in Season 6 as a test composition."

RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,AMeowingCat,11,Fri Jul 3 17:09:38 2015 UTC,I like it! Got a ring to it...
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,jordan_bar,6,Fri Jul 3 17:19:42 2015 UTC,"I won't lie, that was the scene that scared me. I was, for a few episodes, one of those people scared of change in a series I loved. Of course, I stopped watching for a few weeks... the episode RIGHT BEFORE ""THIS ONE GOES TO ELEVEN""!! (I used the episode title to avoid spoilers for you.)   Fuck me if that didn't make me a bigger fan than before. Then season 9 and 10 dropped... and they have seriously not dropped the ball since!"
RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,84981725891758912576,4,Fri Jul 3 20:03:35 2015 UTC,Ha! Wait til you get to season 9 and 10.  But seriously glad you're enjoying the series and hope to continue to do so.

RedvsBlue,3bzqj1,ThiefofNobility,2,Fri Jul 3 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"I watched all of Volume 1 before Volume 2 started, but then I just kinda forgot about it. I may watch Volume 2 this week at some point."
RedvsBlue,3bzs33,StooTubbs,13,Fri Jul 3 13:58:39 2015 UTC,"They explained it the Commentary for Season 11 if I remember rightly. If my memory serves, I believe it was because they didn't like the way that the armour sorta fazed into the warthog, because the armour was bulky and actually went into the seat."
RedvsBlue,3bzs33,InfinityLDog,6,Fri Jul 3 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"Right, it clips through a lot of materials. Although Doyle's shoulder-pads do that all the time, not sure why that went amiss."
RedvsBlue,3bzs33,TaylorCulosis,2,Fri Jul 3 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I've never actually seen it in game. That doesn't really explain why they went with the same chest piece for so many diffirent characters though.  To be honest, the armor doesn't look like Mark VI without the chest, I personally would have given them diffirent armors to suit their personalities a bit more, and just kept the Mark VI helmets as the BCC's iconic look."
RedvsBlue,3bzs33,Dan_Of_Time,8,Fri Jul 3 14:58:33 2015 UTC,Miles said that the Mark VI chest piece gave the characters a stronger look. It was far too large and buff to suit the characters.

RedvsBlue,3byu33,DarkRubberDucky,7,Fri Jul 10 06:24:20 2015 UTC,"I think it was when Alpha was in close proximity with Epsilon at Freelancer HQ, just before Wash told him he was an A.I.  Alpha kept getting painful flashes of memories from Epsilon. That was a two way transfer. Epsilon gave Alpha memories, but also took copies of memories from Alpha. So, Epsilon has the memories of Alpha until Epsilon left the base, after which Alpha died, so pretty much has a full copy of Alpha's memories."
RedvsBlue,3byu33,PrinceCheddar,2,Fri Jul 3 07:14:59 2015 UTC,"If that was true, why did he get so many major details wrong?  And not know who Tucker was at all?"
RedvsBlue,3byu33,ChickadeeAce,19,Fri Jul 3 10:25:55 2015 UTC,"Because Epsilon was still very messed up and relied on Caboose's stories to sort itself out.  Before Caboose's stories, Epsilon was insane. A chaotic mess of memories. The Director's memories, Alpha's memories from when Epsilon split from it, Alpha's memories from just before the EMP, not to mention whatever memories of the other fragments Alpha had before the Epsilon split. They were all in there, all jumbled up and all going though the hell of the memories about the Director's experiments.  Caboose's stories gave the memories of Alpha something to latch on to. Something positive, adventures and friends, that allowed Epsilon to gain some kind of order. The majority of Alpha's memories came together, creating the entity we now call ""Epsilon."" It wasn't completely sorted, it relied on Caboose's stories to fill out the bits he wasn't sure of, but once Epsilon started interacting with other people, things got better and better until he remembered everything properly.. Until this season when things started going wrong, but that's another discussion."
RedvsBlue,3byu33,PrinceCheddar,3,Fri Jul 3 11:34:27 2015 UTC,"Caboose doesn't like tucker because he perceives Tucker as trying to keep Church from him, so when he got the chance to rebuild Church he made sure to remove Tucker from the stories, therefore removing competition for ""Church's best friend""  As for everything else, it IS caboose we're talking about"

RedvsBlue,3byqc4,StooTubbs,4,Fri Jul 3 13:48:24 2015 UTC,Rushed isn't the right word because they have a lot of production time and I do not feel like they rush episodes.  Especially since it is Miles last season I doubt he would want to rush anything.  You need to think of Red vs Blue as a movie.  When you watch it all the way it won't feel like that.  And I don't feel like it was a bad episode.  Sure I wanted more church but I also wanted cool stuff to happen in episodes like 2-7 but it was just a bunch of set up for the future.  Does that make them bad episodes cause I didn't get to see freelancers fight pirates?  Nope.  I like the new characters and I think since this is the last season we should go more into detail with them.  Plus Miles said they'd be talking to church in the next episode about what happened.
RedvsBlue,3byqc4,ThaGreatIsaiah,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:08:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I want more Church, I'm saying I want less so soon. I think they should have left Carolina and Church alone for a few episodes to build the suspense as opposed to just removing it one episode later."

RedvsBlue,3byqc4,DarkRubberDucky,2,Fri Jul 3 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not disappointed (except for no Wash on Locus action) mostly because this isn't season 9 and 10, with lots of animation. They don't have the resources right now (it took months for that one episode, so...)   I'm actually really glad they glossed over the Carolina thing and just left it with Church sitting on her. Its very RvB. We'll see more on them and the situation soon.  Though... I'm beginning to wonder if the people saying Doyle will die are right. I hope not, cause I still kind of want a silly ending with him and Kimball and the activation of a certain temple...  But Kimball is getting less and less likable. I'm not happy to see her. She's like the old Carolina (s10).   And a lot of the seasons are feeling rushed, but they have a lot to tell in 9-15 minute videos with only around 19 of them to tell it. Season 10 they didn't even bother actually telling us what Eta and Iota are. They said they showed it in one episode (I'm assuming Fear and Love), but we don't know anything about them. It was totally rushed through."
RedvsBlue,3byqc4,Forikorder,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:00:15 2015 UTC,if they were doing large seasons that would be one thing but they only do about 20~ episodes for a season so theyre probably gonna wrap everything up in 10 or so episodes  you cant waste 2 episodes on milking Carolina's injuries on such short seasons TBH i feel like theyre already drawing shit out with the Fed/rebel tensions  THE FUCKING MERCS ARE LITERALLY TRYING TO KILL ALL OF YOU STOP BITCHING AND JUST WORK TOGETHER ALREADY YOU WILL LITERALLY DIE IF YOU DONT

Season 8, episode 9, AKA the last time aliens are seen, except for Santa. What is the 57th episode of the Chorus Trilogy by that criteria? It's Season 13 episode 8, AKA the first time Santa is shown. If we only count episodes and PSAs, then we get Season 13 episode 11. Does that mean there was some alien interference with Church? If we only count episodes and trailers, we get Season 13 episode 16. The significance of that is unknown, I still think the main significance of 57 in Chorus is s13e8.

His history prior encountering the freelancers, what he's been doing in the gap between meeting the freelancers and meeting the reds and blues, any other motivations for his actions, etc. are all relatively unknown.  In the Wash's first season he was just an angry dude doing his master's bidding. He wasn't all that deep of a character. We know him for who he is now because snippets of info we've received over time (his past, his motives, is hopes for the future, his relationship to other characters, his losses and victories, etc)    People need screen time in order to get further developed so it would make sense that Wash, a character who's been part of the main crew for several seasons, would be more fleshed out then Sharkface who only shows up every now and then to deliver a one liner.

RedvsBlue,3bqmem,-SpaceCommunist-,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:39:45 2015 UTC,Sarge is Red Teams definitive badass. Wash getting up from Locus' rail gun blast in S11 was a given considering how much shit he's survived. but Sarge survived that rail gun blast too.

RedvsBlue,3bqmem,slocke200,2,Wed Jul 1 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"very good point. I could at least see him making amends with Washington, because he did bring down project freelancer with the reds and blues, and it was carolina who hit him with a banshee and gravity hammer, Washington was just there bitching about a bouncy gun"

RedvsBlue,3bhav6,stolersxz,0,Wed Jul 15 08:48:16 2015 UTC,"Say what you will, but I really do think the series is setting up for a return from Maine. I mean, let's look at the details:  • His armour, and therefore his body, is in Hargrove's possession. The latter is likely stored in a cryotube.  • Hargrove is willing to let ""someone else"" use the armour to finish the job on Chorus and tie up any loose ends. If it comes to that, it's not likely going to be Sharkface, as he's already on Chorus and would therefore be considered a ""loose end"".  • Carolina lamented Maine's fate and feels responsible for it back in Season 10. She has nightmares about the Meta in Season 12 (or perhaps just Sigma). And now in Season 13, the testing chamber showed her her dead teammates, a scene that Miles said would be touched on later. This seems like a setup for emotional conflict for Carolina, should the Meta return.  • We now know that a fall from an icy cliff can be survived with a full recovery, even without the durability that Maine has. All that is induced is unconsciousness, which could initially be mistaken for death. The only difference was that Maine fell into water and not solid ground, but we know that Freelancer suits are airtight enough to withstand the void of space, so drowning shouldn't e a problem.  • Epsilon is ""failing"". If he starts fragmenting, Hargrove could use this as a reason to let Maine go down to Chorus and raise hell. Remember how destructive the Meta's last rampage was? Hargrove remembers that.  I'm not saying this is gonna be the full basis for Season 14's plot, but I know that these facts all seem to be pointing at Maine's return. That itself would definitely impact the plot of Season 14, whatever it may be."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,ElskeFryst,49,Sun Jun 28 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, Kimball, you really need to just fuck off. Doyle did throw the sword off the mountain, but Felix still got it! And if he ended up taking the bullet, then the Space Pirates would be able to activate the Purge! He may not have known that, but he still ended up trying to get rid of the sword anyway, and that takes a hell of a lot more bravery than you give the man credit for!  So Epsilon and Carolina are fine, though the former is definitely failing. Again, though, I'm just sayin'...Maine went through the same thing, albeit into water and not solid ground...if Carolina could've survived that, and Maine, known for his incredible durability, suffered the same kind of fall...plus, she was unconscious, which could've easily been mistaken for death...I'm just sayin'.  The second half of the season is upon us, and with it are a ton of stuff. The Feds and News need to be united, Doyle needs to stay alive for the Purge to remain unactivated, Tucker's gonna have to find the Temple of Communication and send a message to Earth, Sharkface is no doubt on the hunt for Wash, Epsilon is failing and may very well fragment at some point, and Grif has dish duty again. Shit's pretty fucked."

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,UltimaNylocke,8,Tue Jun 30 02:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think there is a fair good reason kimball has been acting up.

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,darkpenguin1,12,Tue Jun 30 09:26:25 2015 UTC,I reckon Doyle bringing up the fact she led her soldiers into a trap probably hit a nerve... but still it was a bit too much.

That, however, only leaves his previous wounds, drowning, and temperature to do him in, like you said.

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,LadWatcherIsHere,15,Mon Jun 29 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tucker has really undergone some great changes since Season 7.  He went from being one of the most shallow and uninteresting characters to one of the most matured and increasingly complex.  For a little while I was worried they'd kill off Wash to give him an ""Obi-wan Kenobi"" moment, but luckily they found a way to force Tucker to stand on his own and start assuming leadership responsibilities without resorting to that.  Now if only they'd give Grif and Simmons a chance to change a bit as well, i'd feel more satisfied.  Grif especially.  He's more a caricature of what he used to be.  I'd hoped when he was ambushed and forced back into training that we'd start to see the start of that, but it looks like that is over and done with."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,ChickadeeAce,2,Mon Jun 29 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"it is a popular rumor that this will somehow be wash's last season, as he gets killed. but i dont think they'd kill more than one character, and my money is on carolina/epsilon (they're a package deal).

Also, did anyone feel that they should have left Carolina being alive ambiguous, since they made a huge deal of Sharkface beating her last episode? I guess it's to show more of Epsilon/Church starting to falter, but still."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,locus782,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:46:52 2015 UTC,Kimball's kinda justified in being a bitch. Remember the Feds' disrespect for her? They may be on the same side but they certainly aren't taking orders from someone who isn't Wash or Doyle.
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,mcandhp,22,Thu Jul 9 17:19:19 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, Doyle's actions were reasonable, bearing in mind his lack of combat experience and the fact that Felix is one scary fucker. He did try to destroy the sword, and did get away. Felix running his mouth is a good distraction? Who would have known? It makes me hate him even more. He seems to be getting more smug with every episode. And the mercs are winning- Sharkface won, they have sword/key, and the Feds/News are falling apart.  Kimball is being a little harsh on Doyle. He does need a talking to, but her way is too blunt, like old Carolina. Perhaps Wash will have a chat with him next episode. I'm looking forward to how the Feds and News will be brought together as well. That little animation with Epsilon and Carolina was a great way to show that they're both alive after the previous episode. I wonder I if any of the Fragments actually did die, and when Church next does a diagnostic, Eta and Iota are missing.    The cracks are starting to grow wider. Even with Sarge's comedy, there is a very serious tone here."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,Odin_Crusades,13,Mon Jun 29 04:59:42 2015 UTC,"Or worse: Epsilon finds out that the two he tried to communicate—Delta and Theta—are the ones who are gone. Not only are some of the more beloved memory fragments gone, but that only leaves Epsilon with mildly-trustworthy AI (i.e. Gamma & Eta/Iota) as well as dangerous AI (Omega and Sigma)."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,-SpaceCommunist-,9,Mon Jun 29 05:48:36 2015 UTC,"That is awesome and scary at the same time. Epsilon's personality could shift as a result. But remember, Sigma was meant for Carolina. We saw how well North and Theta worked, as with Delta/York. We could see Sigma and Carolina as an effective paring."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,Odin_Crusades,4,Mon Jun 29 05:53:48 2015 UTC,"That's assuming Epsilon fragments Sigma. Epsilon is still Epsilon in this scenario, just...well, creepier. Also angrier because of Omega, but y'know.  Personally, I think he's gonna start fragmenting by the end of the season. If Sigma gets fragmented, he will without a doubt definitely be considered a threat, especially by Carolina, who blames him—and herself—for Maine's fate.  Speaking of which, if Epsilon fragments, that'll just be begging to have Maine let loose in his new suit by Hargrove to hunt down the fragments and let the ensuing chaos leave Chorus in a tight spot. But imagine if Carolina does accept Sigma, and convinces herself to hunt down the fragments in turn. We'd end up having a two Metas, and a faceoff between them would be downright incredible."

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,Odin_Crusades,4,Mon Jun 29 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Your devotion to Maine's survival is infectious.   Almost as infectious as O'Malley amirite u guys?! Yeah, I guess that's thanks to him being one of my favourite characters, as well as all the evidence that suggests he's alive—well, moreso facts and information rather than outright evidence, but you know what I mean. To be fair, if there was as much evidence for another character surviving and returning, I'd be doing the same for them, too.   I would have thought that Hardgrove would have revealed Maine's survival when he showed Felix and Locus the suit, or after the call, to tease the audience.   Meh, I think ""someone else"" is enough of a tease. Plus, admittedly it is open ended enough for speculation, which is more of what I think Miles and friends were going for.  Personally, I think a reveal of his survival would be more suited for a post-credits scene, as the crate containing his helmet has been featured in the past two post-credits scenes. It'd definitely be a way to get people excited for the next season—or maybe just piss off people who didn't want Maine back, I dunno.   It seems that Sharkface has taken the place of 'big strong guy' this season.   Agreed. After his little skirmish with Carolina last episode, he's definitely a force to be reckoned with. I honestly don't know if they're gonna kill him off by the end of the season or not. They brought back Donut for only one season (Recreation) before killing him (not permanently, of course), so they could do the same with Sharkface; still, I think it's more likely that he's going to end up being a recurring character post-Season 13. Whether or not he'll be the ""big strong guy"" is up in the air.   But if I'm wrong, you will be crowing triumphantly in that episode's megathread.   I prefer to think of it as ""trumpeting"" :P  But don't worry, I won't try to make that much of a fuss about it. Maybe.   As for your doube Meta suggestion: that. Would. Be. Amazing.

With just those couple seconds they managed to wipe out a lot of the fears that Carolina and/or Epsilon was dead, and bring a touch of levity to a scary situation.

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,ChickadeeAce,9,Mon Jun 29 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"You know neither Doyle or Kimball are suited for leadership role they are in. Defiantly Kimball, she is meant to be in an alliance with the feds but spends so much time berating and/or insulting them and Doyle even when they have a point, not to mention her hypocrisy.  She berates Doyle for not taking risks (Despite taking a big one in the last few episodes) when she took a risk and led a large portion of their forces into an ambush that almost got them wiped out.   Doyle had to react to a situation with limited forces and time. I say he made the right call, Kimball’s forces managed to escape to his reinforcements and has a key that won’t work for him. Kimball needs to get off her high horse. No wonder the fed soldiers don’t like her and don’t get along with rep soldiers, until she accepts that the feds and Doyle are no longer the enemy and don’t need to be fought on everything they can truly start working together."

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,mcandhp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"I said neither are suited for the leadership role. And the whole reason I focused on her hypocrisy was because she was acting Holier than Thou towards Doyle. Since the current season started we have seen Doyle try and keep the alliance between the Feds and Reps going, but at every one of these scenes we have seen Kimball basically shove it in their faces and take the alliance for granted. Now you can't expect soldiers of two opposing armies to get along, especially after they just came out of a long bloody war like these two. But as the leader of the New Republic Kimball should put aside that animosity like Doyle so they DON'T ALL FUCKING DIE. How can the Feds like her when she still acts like a bitch to their leader and publicly insult them, and then expect them to follow her orders.  As for walking into an ambush it falls on all of the leadership, yes it was a good time to attack, but none of the leaders, especially those leading the assault (including my favourite Wash), expected that Charon would have a fall back plan for when backed into a corner, they should have taken precautions in case the enemy (who do have known off world ability) brought in reinforcements or something. Kimball said “Don’t you dare turn this around one me”, she basically tried to shift everything onto Doyle’s shoulders when as I said, he had to react to a situation (we already knew he was a shit military leader, he admitted it when we first saw him) that would either result in a, the destruction of their main army or b, Charon having access to a doomsday weapon. He took c and stopped both from happening (at great risk to his own life by the way).  Neither side is perfect, never have been, but Kimball is the one straining this alliance with her attitude and Doyle blaming/hating mentality. Sorry if I am focusing on Kimball, but we all knew Doyle wasn't a good leader, but Kimball's attitude really pisses me off, it just feels like she feels she in entitled to respect when she doesn't show it (And hence gets none back from the feds)."

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,azntrojan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:00:17 2015 UTC,There is a PSA every 4 episodes. The pattern is pretty obvious when you see the list of episodes on the site.
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,Bobthemurderer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:50:55 2015 UTC,"it was more similar to episodes from past seasons. this season they have been good about keeping a battle/huge drama secret thing every episode, so the season feels fast paced and makes the season also feel like a lot of things happened.this was a post battle/huge drama secret thing for the most part.   and yes it is the shortest one by 17 seconds, with overall it being only the 2nd 6 minute episode."
RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,kman273,3,Tue Jun 30 04:04:33 2015 UTC,It seems to me that this is shaping up to be Season 3 in reverse: It's the villains who show up at the midseason point with an army introduced in the first few episodes to score a victory (as opposed to the heroes with the Red and Blue Zealots) and the heroes who have to attack an alien temple to win the fight (as opposed to O'Malley attacking one).  ... Time to go back to the theory drawing board.

RedvsBlue,3bg8oi,Bobthemurderer,2,Tue Jun 30 12:29:38 2015 UTC,Oh I love talking bits. This was just a boring episode in my opinion.
RedvsBlue,3bflfh,Belisarius25,34,Sun Jun 28 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"I dunno, this season is very reminiscent of Season 3. Large temples, alien technologies, an AI that runs at least one of the temples, a sword acting as a key, the antagonist amassing an army (S13 Locus and Felix turning prisoners into Space Pirates, S3 O'Malley having Lopez build a Robot Army), hell even O'Malley came back (in the form of Doc getting angry after going insane).  At this point, if they end the Season with an alien appearing, I wouldn't be surprised."
RedvsBlue,3bflfh,-SpaceCommunist-,7,Sun Jun 28 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"I completely agree on this season's similarities with Season 3. This was more of a ""there isn't a portion of the show devoted to the Reds and Blues in a Box Canyon"" like the BGC or seasons 7, 9, and 11 had."

RedvsBlue,3bflfh,-SpaceCommunist-,3,Mon Jun 29 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"Well, Junior was born at the end of Season 4, but I'm down for him showing up at some point. Personally, I'd rather they settled the matter of whatever the hell happened to this guy after the ship crashed in Reconstruction.  Time travel is...well, a little less likely to appear. Still, we haven't seem Yellow Church in a while, so....  And Gamma already appeared briefly in S12 as a memory. Poor guy was only trusted with saying how much time was left until the data transfer was done; but hey, Epsilon at least trusted Gamma with something, as opposed to Omega, who he dismissed immediately, let alone how he didn't even acknowledge Sigma.  Regardless, I think if Epsilon starts fragmenting, we'll see Gamma come back, though I don't know how well he'd be treated. Delta and Theta are obvious friends and Omega and Sigma are obvious threats, but Gamma is just...well, Gamma. He can be either way. I hope they see him as a friend, instead of trying to get rid of him. :("

RedvsBlue,3bflfh,astalavista114,2,Sun Jun 28 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"That's probably because the Chorus trilogy is the first one that has been a properly continuous trilogy, whereas the Recollection was a 1+2 season story arc (with Season 6 being nicely self-contained), and Project Freelancer was a 2 season arc. So the BGC throwbacks are sort of like the base point for each of the following stories, which are then built on for each arc. To be honest, I wouldn't mind if Season 14 didn't do that, just for a change up."
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,Uganda-In-Particular,21,Sun Jun 28 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"I think it could make for a fantastic miniseries, in the vein of Out of Mind or Recovery One (seriously, those were great, I'm sad we haven't seen any in the Chorus Trilogy). It could be really great, to have four or five episodes, each jam-packed with action and character development."
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,Belisarius25,8,Sun Jun 28 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"You know, that episode made me actually really like Locus. He obviously had compassion for the scared being that couldn't understand them. And the way they made his superior office seem so ominous makes me wonder if he won't somehow show up. The helmet and the way he talks down to Locus seemed important. Maybe its just to underline (quickly) why Locus is so focused on the soldier/killer mindset while Felix is just an ass-hat."
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,DarkRubberDucky,4,Sun Jun 28 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Felix is an asshat, actually, no more than Locus.  The show clearly shows it believes in nurture over nature, and the stresses of a massive, chaotic battle could certainly make anyone go mad in a hundred different ways.  It's possible that Felix was what he pretended to be to the rebels, a charismatic, talented soldier with a dead-eye and a carefree disposition.  Which is exactly my point for the idea of a prequel.  Showing Felix and Locus turn from the very best aspects of what they idealize, Locus being a 'true soldier' and Felix being the charismatic mercenary, but slowly devolving into monsters, each perfectly fucked-up in their own ways."
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,DarkRubberDucky,3,Sun Jun 28 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think some people really are just mean. And with Portal Felix all too willing to kill Locus, while Portal Locus is willing to help him shows the difference in their personality to start with. True, things can change you, as proof with Carolina and Wash, but I think Felix is just more of a killer than any other.   Watching the series, Felix kills with a laugh, patting himself on the back. Locus kills without fanfair. He kills and moves on. Felix gloats. I really can't see how Felix could have been a ""good"" guy in his life. Seeing how well he plays the New Republic... he does a complete 180. From a man who really does sound like he cares about them dying... to being willing to kill every single one of them? Felix is one dark SOB. But I'd still love to see the past Locus, before the war."
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,InfiniteStrong,2,Mon Jun 29 05:55:48 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that Felix is and was a far more amoral and cruel person than Locus was and is, I don't think that Felix is really treated well by your assessment.  I mean, war is fucking terrifying, after all.  And they were in a brutal battle with an alien species (at least, that's what's implied), I mean, soldiers today have massive difficulty trusting anyone on the battlefield.  It doesn't matter who you are or who you're fighting, and if you're fighting aliens, that makes it all the worse.  Sure, Felix was willing to shoot the creature, but it could just as well have been trying to get the drop on them, or just distract them as its allies flanked behind.  How would Locus have known?  Or maybe not, maybe Felix is a cunt, but that's my point.  I'd like to see a bit more of both their characters explored."

RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,Mercer8878,2,Tue Jun 30 03:25:16 2015 UTC,They may expand on that more in the season with like Felix's flashback if they ever show that but it'd either look really weird or have to be fully animated because they used Halo 4's engine which does not contain any Elites so idk how they'd do it.
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,ThaGreatIsaiah,2,Sun Jun 28 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"if they do show elites, they'd probably have to use the master chief collection, or wait for halo 5 if it has elites at all."
RedvsBlue,3bfbbt,bryanb46,2,Sun Jun 28 23:54:43 2015 UTC,"Master Chief collection cannot be used by them.  It is limited with customization and there are still no elites in Halo 4.  Just 3, 2 and 2 anniv.  Also no elites in Halo 5."
RedvsBlue,3bgfa3,Shizzable,14,Mon Jun 29 00:20:56 2015 UTC,"If the BGC had gone on much longer than it did it would have gotten stale. Five seasons was the perfect length for it, and if you look at it as a stand alone series it works just fine. The writers did an admirable job of ""retconing"" parts of the first five seasons to form a coherent story line with later seasons, but certain things don't quite fit. It isn't exactly their fault because they didn't really know what they were doing all the way back in 2003, but the end product was still a bit sloppy.  I prefer the later seasons as well, but I appreciate the BGC for what it was: a bunch of idiots in a canyon talking about killing each other and eventually getting around to it -- accidentally or otherwise."
RedvsBlue,3bgfa3,MyNameIsMaurice,2,Mon Jun 29 04:31:14 2015 UTC,i think theyve tried to go too far from that though with the current season its way too complicated and IMO there not pulling it off as well as if there kept the story more simple and just told it really really well like some of the previous seasons
RedvsBlue,3bgfa3,Forikorder,7,Tue Jun 30 06:30:30 2015 UTC,"The big thing that I think the BGC has going for it is that it's a much more focused show. The characters are established very firmly (and arguably are more fleshed out in the early seasons, since most of the gang become caricatures of themselves during the Recollection) and the only purpose is to have funny and bizarre shit happen to the characters. As a result, I think it's the time when the show's writing was the least impacted by Burnie's limitations as a writer. Because the writing is very sharp in the early seasons, it is very easy for me to overlook the weird production quality that comes from the early Halo games. That said, they completely retooled the show from Season 6 (my personal favorite) onward, so there's a big disconnect that tends to make people become disinterested in the BGC. So I think you do have a point here, the BGC might as well be a separate show from the subsequent seasons."
RedvsBlue,3bgfa3,theYOLOdoctor,2,Mon Jun 29 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that the Recollections and Chorus Trilogy have been the strongest in the series, personally. I get the feeling that those are stories they really want to tell, while the BGC are them playing with the characters. I think it's pretty clear when they really want to tell a particular story, like in Reconstruction, with Wash's story, or Season 12, with the story of the Chorus Civil War."
RedvsBlue,3bgfa3,Belisarius25,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:39:33 2015 UTC,"Back when RvB was beginning, it was just.. a bunch of guys playing Halo and it was hilarious. And then it evolved into what we have now. My personal favorite era was Season 6-10 (two different sagas but w/e I consider it an era) because of the amazing writing and plot, but rewatching the old episodes is always a great trip."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,Mercer8878,30,Sun Jun 28 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"I think the balance is good. The Reds not always having a full grasp on the situation works to the advantage of the narrative, the banter, and the viewers. (As they are allowed to ask more questions)  I absolutely don't think they should be involved with the backstory, as it would only alienate them. The BG crew aren't predestined heroes or anything like that, they're just people.   There are some spots of development, such as the Reds conversation about the director in Season 10 and Simmons not kissing ass in Season 12. And I think that's all that's needed.   Simmons: ""What do you mean? We were terrible leaders.""  Grif: ""Well yeah. But you gotta admit, they did make you feel pretty important."""
RedvsBlue,3bde60,TaylorCulosis,3,Sun Jun 28 04:55:04 2015 UTC,"while i can agree too a good majority of what you just said theirs no denying that the Reds are just the same as they were in blood gultch.  Church was a ghost now Ai that could be very well dead for the final time, blue team has a new leader in the form of wash. And Sarge is still the semi crazy, violent, shotgun lover with a southern accent.  Caboose now has a gun with aimbot so he's now somewhat usefull in combat and is now special alien chosen one number two, Grif's still a fat lazy ass.  Tucker is now also greeting center stage as he's now a forefront of the show, progressing as a character and being somewhat of a predestined hero as you put it. Simmons is still nerdy Simmons.  And Donuts and Lopez have so far just been back ground character. while they seem to be fine as of now being the three stooges and two back ups of the show who have there moments here and there, red team as a hole has never once changed in terms of character, meaning that the hole name, red vs blue takes a hit as in it now seems more like the show should be Named Blue vs freelancer's."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,Hanpwolf,9,Sun Jun 28 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"That's kinda the point though. All the drama is ""Blue Team stuff"". Without the Red Team as foil to these serious characters and situations, the show would lose it's comedic value almost entirely."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"Still, there is a difference between staying true to the core of a character, and another thing completely for them to be stagnant, like Simmons, or become caricatures of themselves, like Grif.  Out of shape slacker Grif from BGC has become obese slob Grif, who drips used cooking grease out of his pores and can't be bothered to take a couple steps in order to smack someone who insults him.  Carolina is disgusted that a gun is soiled after he touches it and Epsilon says being in Grif's body is like ""breathing through a trash can.""  And while he went back and forth between being thoughtful, clever and stupid in BGC, now he's just dumb as a stump all the time.  And as if that wasn't bad enough, listen to his voice from BGC to now - he used to talk normally - now he has a Shaggy from Scooby Doo falsetto thing going on almost all the time.  I'm half waiting for him to say ""Zoinks!""  He's still my favourite -- but got to admit, I'm a little bit bitter."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,clarinetninja,17,Mon Jun 29 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"Eh. I honestly like the red stock characters. It's good to know that no matter what happens, Sarge will always regret Grif's continued existence, that Simmoms will still be just as nerdy, and so on. They serve a useful purpose as comedic relief."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,DarkRubberDucky,2,Sun Jun 28 05:44:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, we've have 13 seasons of them. We know just enough for them to roll with every punch. Half of them we know their home states, we know their foods, we know their middle names. The reds and blues are well known now (minus Sarge, but Sarge is a jar head, so I imagine he's just been in the military since out of high school). They characters are nice and even.  Its the Freelancers I'd love more backstory on. We know Wash was David and he was a silly blonde with a love of fruit and twisty straws and rubber ducks (sup, Wash?), but how did he end up as a Freelancer? Where is he from? What's his favorite vacation spot? And with him at a nice middle nowadays, both military hard-ass and going back to the fun Wash in 9 and 10, he's at the good point overall.  Carolina, I can take in that she joined Project Freelancer (maybe the military/UNSC before that?) because of her mother and father, so her past isn't needed, but her future is up for grabs and she's so interesting I can't wait for more of her."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,Samocoptor,2,Sun Jun 28 18:15:12 2015 UTC,"If there are seasons past 13; I want a storyline/arc that features the Reds rather than the Blues. But instead of some super serious storyline like past ones, it should be a callback to the crazy, bombastic and downright ridiculous adventures of Blood Gulch."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,brenster23,2,Sun Jun 28 20:39:18 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing sarge's backstory considering that guy can be a total beast when he is in the right situation he is the best fighter on red team. if only he wasn't insane.

RedvsBlue,3bde60,JacksonSX35,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:20:55 2015 UTC,"From a writing standpoint, I think adding in backstory to the Reds would just seem contrived. As much as I like toying with the idea of the Reds getting backstory, their being storyless has always served the story well. I think the dynamic wouldn't work well enough with the Blues serving the static character purpose."
RedvsBlue,3bde60,UltimaNylocke,3,Sun Jun 28 06:42:56 2015 UTC,I think the thing about the garden hose was all the backstory we needed for Sarge.
RedvsBlue,3bde60,JacksonSX35,2,Sun Jun 28 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"He was an ODST. That's also what we know. Simmons wanted to be a Mathlete, and Grif has a sister. What else could you want?"
RedvsBlue,3bde60,Harbinger_Reaper,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"The Red's character development is that they never have it. They always just get dragged along for the ride. They(as in the writers put it in character dialogue, so the reds) say how they always get dragged along without any proper incentive, and never seem to contribute that much (compared to others).  Which is kinda their purpose, comic relief...well, except that nothing beats Caboose in that."

RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Libertyprime117,16,Sun Jun 28 07:53:30 2015 UTC,"The obvious implication, given that we see Maine having fully turned into the Meta before this is mentioned, is that the Meta attempted to attack Wyoming and steal his A.I., but was unsuccessful, possibly by being lulled into a trance by Wyoming's knock-knock jokes.  The big reason is that it's implied that Tex wouldn't have 'left anything' if she'd attacked Wyoming.  What's odd about this is that it's heavily implied it was Maine having fully devolved into the Metastate, and went so far as to attack another Freelancer, but yet was still on the Mother of Invention, seeing as it was in space while this happened.    In reality, it was likely the Meta, and it was simply overlooked that he would somehow still be on the ship when it crashed."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Uganda-In-Particular,3,Sun Jun 28 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"Ok but why didn't The Meta kill Wyoming? He was much stronger, and unless Wyoming already had the time distortion unit, Meta would easily have killed him. And if Wyoming did have the time distortion unit why didn't Wyoming activate it when he was fighting York?"
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Forikorder,8,Sun Jun 28 09:06:01 2015 UTC,"the Meta didnt have all his nifty gear and AI by then, just his super strength and Sigma he wasnt unstoppable yet"
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Forikorder,2,Sun Jun 28 13:45:29 2015 UTC,"Super strength would allow him to beat Wyoming easily at close quarters. Heck, York beat Wyoming and he was never as strong as Maine."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,ChickadeeAce,4,Sun Jun 28 23:04:51 2015 UTC,IIRC York was always above him on the leaderboard so might want to change a thing or two there
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Forikorder,2,Mon Jun 29 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"York was always #2 or #3 on the board I'm pretty sure - the only people who were ever higher were Tex and Carolina.  I'm actually having a hard time finding all the different screenshots at the moment, but the one that I did find shows Wyoming at #4 behind York, and Maine at #6.  As we saw in the test fight against Tex, strength alone isn't necessarily enough to carry a fight, and that was with two other Freelancers alongside.  Maine was the first to charge in unsupported and get his ass kicked by Tex every time, and further, never learned from it to adopt a new strategy.    I feel like a real ass, but I cannot remember - what was Maine's special tech?  And do we actually ever see him fight with Sigma's help?  The only time I can think of is when they were chasing down CT, but in that instance all we see is Sigma sic-ing him on the other soldiers like a dog, which I found pretty horrific.  Furthermore, wasn't it while Maine was fighting that Sigma went to speak with York and Wash?  He just left him to fight on his own, even though York was concerned that Maine was fighting so soon after his injury.  I'm not sure what benefit Sigma ever really brought Maine - even the dubious help he gave him by allowing him to communicate after his injury is suspect.  Sigma could have said anything on Maine's behalf and no one would have been the wiser.  Sigma and the Counselor would be a pretty close match in the ""Who is the more manipulative bastard"" contest."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,ChickadeeAce,2,Tue Jun 30 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"its never said directly, but when malcolm is listing the equipment in the meta suit he names super strength so i think that was Maines, and im guessing he used that super strength to use extremely heavy armor which is why he could take such a beating and weighed more then everyone else  how the AIs supported the freelancers in combat was never actually showed at all (epsilon so far has seemed pretty mcuh useless aside from during the 3 mooks and activating equipment) but im fairly certain Sigma could chat with Delta and support maine at the same time"
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Forikorder,2,Tue Jun 30 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"Well, we do know somewhat how the AI help - their individual special tech can be deadly without an AI to help run it.  That was why North caught shit for using his shield on his own, without a connection back to the mainframe or whatever it was Wash said when he freaked out.  Also, we saw what happened to Grif when he and Simmons experimented with a tech similar to Carolina's with super speed.  That... didn't end well.  And Theta both assisted North with his shield AND with guiding him when he threw a shield unit to shut down (and indirectly kill) the soldiers firing on the Freelancers while they tried to hunt down CT.    Delta seems capable of helping York work on locks and carry on other tasks simultaneously, but not sure about Sigma.  He does eventually leave his conversation with the other Freelancers saying ""I'll be right back"" and goes to apparently assist Maine - how, I don't know.    ""Three mooks?""  Not sure what that is referring to.  If that was the scene in the flashback after they saved the BGC in Season 12, Epsilon was pretty freaking awesome.  Being able to access memories of all the other AI fragments like that, it was like an actual sane and working equivilent of the Meta."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"ya but Carolina and Connie were both able to use there special tech without an AI so i think york was an exception not a rule (which is odd cause his seems like the one that would be easiest to use)  thats the scene im talking to, and as awesome as that was he was completely useless against Felix and Sharkface both of which easily landed sneak attacks on Carolina without him warning her"
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Uganda-In-Particular,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"You mean North?  York's was a healing unit, wasn't it?  Sadly, it didn't save him from Wyoming, even with Delta there to use it.  And yet it managed to keep Wash alive after South shot him in the back, and without an AI.  Ah well, sometimes consistency goes out the door for good drama.    Hmm, thinking back to North again for a moment - even if he was able to run his shield unassisted, there's no way that he would have been able to accomplish the customized tasks that Theta did, regarding rerouting power to cover necessary areas and to open gaps in the shield so he could fire at targets outside.  Theta wasn't merely running the tech, he was manipulating it in a very complex way.  The reaction from the spectators is probably a good indicator of how impressive it was.  They did address at least the Felix attack directly, didn't they?  Epsilon and Carolina traded barbs about who was responsible for that one, so at least it wasn't an instance of a detail sneaking past the writers.  I haven't re-watched the Sharkface fight yet, so I'm not in any position to comment on that one."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Uganda-In-Particular,7,Tue Jun 30 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"Any number of reasons could be the reason why Maine didn't kill Wyoming.  The first being that he was interrupted by Freelancer personnel or other Freelancers.  There's shitloads of them, after all, despite the series showing a fifth of them.  The second being that he simply wasn't intelligent enough.  Wyoming's smart, and Gamma's creative as hell, the two together could've probably found a way to defeat Maine, or at least hold him off or escape.  Finally, he may have simply spared Wyoming, in the same way that he spared Wash twice."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,locus782,2,Sun Jun 28 09:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he could have got away with blaming it on Texas. He got away with beating up Wyoming so he could have killed her easily.  What's more interesting is that Wyoming didn't tell anyone that it was Meta, if it was."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,84981725891758912576,3,Sun Jun 28 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"""Blaming it on Texas"".  How, exactly, could he have done that?  It's not as if the Meta can speak, and Sigma was a lying little shit, which the Director knew.  I think that Wyoming did tell the Director, but to make sure that no one sided with Tex, he fabricated the story that it was her who tried to steal the A.I., which would probably especially infuriate Carolina."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,84981725891758912576,2,Sun Jun 28 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"My guess? He decided it was probably to risky to take his AI and be on the mother if invention, someone definitely would have noticed if he had an extra AI."
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,84981725891758912576,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:00:17 2015 UTC,"He could have put the A.I. in a convenient storage facility... An abandoned wind power facility perhaps?

And Gamma did things like call upon an alien and a robot army to keep Alpha in an easily recoverable place!"
RedvsBlue,3bdv6m,Tmlboost,5,Sun Jun 28 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"Tex went rogue at that time, and PFL claimed that she tried to take his AI, but it was a lie, to get them to hate her."

RedvsBlue,3b8875,clarinetninja,14,Fri Jun 26 23:53:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really fair to say. Sure, Church has had many iterations so technically he has died more than once, but in reality they are all separate characters. The Director, Alpha, and Epsilon are, for all intents and purposes, entirely different entities. And considering that the Director and Alpha are dead, Epsilon really is the last ""version"" of Church left, so his death really does matter.  Also, Church's scenario is pretty unique, so it's not like death doesn't matter for every other character."
RedvsBlue,3b8875,Crocodilefan,2,Sat Jun 27 00:12:04 2015 UTC,"He has a point about death not being as big of a deal. Tex, Donut, Sheila, FLISS, all the fragments, Lopez. Sharkface. And a general rule of fiction, if you don't see a body don't be sure they're really dead. coughMettacough"
RedvsBlue,3b8875,Dan_Of_Time,6,Sat Jun 27 03:54:51 2015 UTC,"Good point, good point. Our wind instrument warrior here had just focused on the Director/Alpha/Epsilon/Church so I did as well.  But here's a counter-point, for the sake of being technical: Did any of those characters really die and come back, or were they just presumed dead and then reappeared? In my opinion/memory when a character is killed in RvB they aren't just brought back in some BS way. As the show has gotten more plot-centric and dramatic I feel that the team has learned to handle death seriously.  Then again, to counter my own point, I will admit Donut was heavily implied to be dead given how Washington did shoot him, kicking off a long period of radio silence from our favorite lightish-red soldier."
RedvsBlue,3b8875,Crocodilefan,4,Sat Jun 27 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"I would say Donut is an exception because his ""deaths"" are like a running gag at this point.  All others have been pretty serious so far though."
RedvsBlue,3b8875,Dan_Of_Time,3,Sat Jun 27 07:52:25 2015 UTC,"I dont know about ""running gag"" he died once then just always seemed to be somewhere else. Either the VA was busy or maybe RT was trying to phase him out becuase his entire characterization ""wearing pink turned him feminine and or gay"" seems a little dated. But you can't get rid of Donut, hes a fan favorite, so they gave him a new schtick: mistranslating Lopez."
RedvsBlue,3b8875,Crocodilefan,3,Sat Jun 27 08:05:24 2015 UTC,"He was loose weight, same with Lopez. It makes it easier to write for. He didn't particularly have a place in S8's events, Doc was able to give life and character to the enemies perspective and was really there to keep Wash a character that could return."

RedvsBlue,3aysjl,iovita2,3,Wed Jun 24 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Also the Tumblr fandom had a nice time narrating everything in Church's southern drawl after Epsilon's speech. More of an inside joke thing, no one's mad."
RedvsBlue,3aysjl,WW4O,0,Thu Jun 25 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. I think it's more tumblr culture vs reddit culture. You ever notice how many shared images on Tumblr have the comments section below with something along the lines of ""THIS IS THE BEST"" or ""THIS IS THE WORST?"" It's like a laugh track, showing an audience reaction to condition you to have the same reaction. The hyperbole adds to that, like when laugh tracks are way too strong."

Given he was assistant to oversight, then chairman of oversight, it wouldn't be a big surprise he ladder climbed quickly.  Not to mention there's the other option which is that he was made chairman of the PF oversight which at the time wouldn't be a conflict of interest with Charon. His actions letting Charon gain the PF assets and contracts to fill the void."

RedvsBlue,3au0nb,Belisarius25,17,Tue Jun 23 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"All sounds pretty solid... except for your last theory. I highly, highly doubt Tucker would ever seriously consider activating the Purge himself. He's nowhere near amoral enough to contemplate genocide - it's one of the things that separates him from men like Felix. He might think about it for a moment, but he would never go through with it, IMO.  One thing I'd add to the 'Fights' section is Wash vs Locus. Judging by the latest episode, Locus is after Wash's head in a big way, thanks to Wash's careful provocation. They'll almost certainly come to blows.  Good stuff!"
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,Huwage,5,Tue Jun 23 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading! I'll admit, the last theory is by far the least likely, but I imagine it as the final step in Tucker's evolution as a character. He's gone from not caring about the fight in Season 11, to leading the people he cares about in Season 12, to realizing that there's a larger battle to be fought in Season 13. It'd be a situation where, if Tucker doesn't act, all of Chorus (aside from Felix) will die. Tucker may be bluffing, but his point is that he's willing to sacrifice it if he can stop Hargrove from doing anything like his job on Chorus again.  As for Locus and Wash, I'm hesitant to say they'll fight, because from a narrative standpoint, their conflict was resolved last episode. Their first battle (Season 11, and the flashback in Season 12) has Locus telling Wash that the two of them are similar. Season 12's final battle has Wash calling out Locus's flaws, but admits that he used to be similar: ""I know I used to be a real piece of shit, but at least I'm trying to do something about it."" Last episode, Wash's speech gave a definitive answer: ""I'm a soldier, and you're just a murderer.""  Of course, I'm probably wrong about half of this, and Locus's line ""I need a vehicle"" does imply he's going after Wash. Thanks again for reading!"
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,84981725891758912576,8,Tue Jun 23 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"Wash is just so awesome. He was never the strongest, never the fastest, never the smartest, and yet, look at the shit he's survived. He was right. He IS the soldier."
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,JacksonSX35,5,Tue Jun 23 19:11:59 2015 UTC,100% agreed. Wash is probably one of the biggest badasses in the series.
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,JacksonSX35,7,Tue Jun 23 19:45:22 2015 UTC,I read something very different the first time. Shark vs. Washface. Maybe I need new glasses.
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,-SpaceCommunist-,7,Tue Jun 23 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"Wash's helmet gets thrown into the ocean, and the shark which eats it has to deal with the indigestion it causes.  Somebody call Miles."
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,-SpaceCommunist-,4,Tue Jun 23 16:18:33 2015 UTC,Already on it.
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,JacksonSX35,2,Tue Jun 23 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"I doubt Tucker would ever kill his friends and all the people on Chorus. He wouldn't be defeating Felix at all; he'd be finishing the job, making all of the efforts that the BGC and the people of Chorus have put forward mean nothing.  As for Doyle, I dunno if he's gonna die or not. Now that he's in possession of the sword, it's more than likely that Felix will try to use his sword to activate the Purge in the same way that Truth tried to activate the Halo array with Johnson's push in Halo 3. Plus, I'm actually starting to like the guy, especially after he did something as brave as taking the sword at the risk of his own life, just so that his soldiers could live.  And on the parallels between Seasons 1-3 and the Chorus Trilogy, let me just remind you of one thing:  Season 3 ended with the appearance of an alien, and Season 12 showed us that aliens have crash-landed on Chorus. Think about that."
RedvsBlue,3au0nb,Libertyprime117,2,Tue Jun 23 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, the Tucker thing is my least likely theory. I don't actually think Tucker would activate the Purge, but he'd threaten to, to force Felix to retreat in order to live.  I think there's a reason that Santa specified that the key will remain bonded to you ""until your death."" Doyle isn't as popular in the fandom or as well-developed as Kimball, and would force Kimball's character development that we've already seen hints of (episode 6).   And yeah, I think there's a solid chance we encounter actual aliens before the season ends."

RedvsBlue,3atf24,infernal_llamas,9,Tue Jun 23 10:50:52 2015 UTC,"You need to remember that she was raised like this. Her entire life was a competition. The Director liked to meddle with personalities, that's all the leaderboard was for.  It's like the Spartan program, he believed emotions could be used as a strength not a weakness. Ambition and such can be caused by jealously. Sigma was ambitious, the Director liked that.   The fact that Carolina was prepared to go on missions with the BGC instead of going solo shows HUGE improvement. She is fighting for the greater good, not to be on top or stand out.   Before she knew who Sharkface was she saw a unique individual. The confidence, visual separation and vicious personality. She knew he was something more than a regular space goon. When he showed this to her, she knew she had to beat him. He presented a challenge and she wanted to be on top. This is the first time since the end of S10 she's done this.   We've seen her actually listen to Tuckers plans and fight alongside them before. This one act shows that naturally the competitive nature drilled into her mind is still there, she just doesn't listen to it all the time.  During the fight she found out Sharkface was from her past, PFL was still affecting her. This is what drove her to finish him. She is running from her past, trying to be one of the good guys again.   TL;DR Carolina will always be competitive, she will always carry that with her but we have seen her control it much more in the past 2.5 seasons."
RedvsBlue,3atf24,Dan_Of_Time,3,Tue Jun 23 13:12:14 2015 UTC,It's just that we haven't seen her struggling with it so this is a bit of a bolt from the blue.
RedvsBlue,3atf24,Dan_Of_Time,5,Tue Jun 23 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"She did hesitate in episode 5 when Wash said that they would take on Locus and Felix. She was then very keen to go and fight them in the portal on her own. We havent seen many signs of her breaking, mainly because she can control it. After being introduced to the mysterious merc she does show signs of wanting to go after him. Sharkface's threat of finding Doyle first broke that."

You just have to remember that her life for the last several years has been loosing all of her team/friends from betrayal or death, being basically left for dead by her own father while he saved his precious AI (ever wonder how she disappeared after being tossed off a cliff? Why didn't the Director, I don't know, send a search party for his daughter?), feeling responsible for her own friends' deaths because she gave Maine her AI, getting vengeance for her friends and herself by trying to kill her father, then joining a group of sim-troopers, with no real combat use, and is now fighting a new AND old enemy, all at once. All while trying so hard to overcome her past, it still just keeps not only coming back to haunt her, but its coming back to beat her shit up.  Carolina is a deep character, and right now is a fine time for her to just glide as-is so that when her development does come, it will be even better. She's nudged her way forward, only for something to set her back. She came to terms with her past, saying it doesn't define her, then trying to loosen up (if only in one episode), but this episode I think will lead us forward in her development.  Or it will be the final breaking point and destroy her."

Tex shot the last one seen on-screen, but the stray sniper shot that killed Captain Flowers suggests that one of the clones got away. Tucker didn't corner CT; CT cornered him. Granted, the former did blow up the latter's car with one swipe of his energy sword, but that badassery was immediately beaten by the fact that CT survived said explosion unscathed. As for the cornering, CT would've shot and killed Tucker had Epsilon not shown up. Tex used to be considered a part of Blue Team back in the day, and Wash has taken her place. So if not for them, you'd be right.   That's not to say that Tucker isn't a badass. He's pretty awesome if you ask me, but he's not on par with a Freelancer."

He spotted Florida from several dozen yards away, threw a tomahawk all the way back, and hit Florida square in the chest with it. He got hit a lot by Tex in the four-way fight, but got right back up and kept fighting like her punches were nothing (plus, if you look carefully, you can see him actually knocking Tex back a few times, something that few have ever been able to do).  No, CT isn't a freelancer, but I'll be damned if he isn't as good as Connie, if not better.  EDIT: Also, let's not forget the WARTHOG SURPRISE ATTACK"

Carolina gets taken out by one of the Tex clones by one clothes line. Tucker instead cracks constant jokes.  Really, I think its just that Tucker can take one hell of a beating and is the smartest of the Reds and Blues (excluding Church).  However! How was Tucker assigned to Outpost Alpha with a Freelancer and an AI they were trying so hard to hide?   I've had a theory that there had to be a second place Freelancers were being trained. Some seem like they had more field experience, versus Washington and the sudden arrival of Agent Florida. If Tucker were a Freelancer, in all likelihood, he was maybe considered to be trained to be a Freelancer. He has some Freelancer knowledge in season one, so maybe if you stretch, Tucker could have been a Freelancer-in-training, but didn't know what he was being trained for."

Tucker was more or less the leader of the four the New Republic had, and Felix betrayed the New Republic. Wash was more or less the leader of the four the Feds had, and Locus betrayed the Feds. Carolina wasn't part of the conflict, and neither was Sharkface.   Killing Doyle seems like a reasonable prediction.  When the user dies, the system that locks it to the user disengages, allowing a new user to be imprinted.. or something."

RedvsBlue,3at58v,JacksonSX35,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:12:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know about killing Doyle. Though, to be honest, I figured him getting the sword was a way to sort of justify his reason for even being in the show at this point. In season 12, he was the leader of the Feds, so he sort of had to be there. But now, he's one of the weakest, least favorite characters, who doesn't really need to be in the show, except to show there is still tension between the Feds and New Republic. But that's being shown just fine with the other soldiers and Kimball.  So, as much as I kind of wish Doyle weren't going to be very important, I don't know if they hate (or love) him enough to kill him off."
RedvsBlue,3at58v,DarkRubberDucky,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:29 2015 UTC,I like Doyle. He's one of the characters with the most potential for growth.

That was just his first major display of failure and I'm sure it will continue to get worse until the finale where either he dies or thinks he will but gets saved at the last minute somehow.  And Carolina isn't dead either.

RedvsBlue,3arlgm,DarkRubberDucky,5,Tue Jun 23 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think Carolina is dead.  And I don't think Epsilon is dead.. yet. He's kinda had a bluescreen (not a redscreen) of death and needs rebooting, but when he does reboot he'll have deteriorated, and will continue to do so until Epsilon ""dies."" Epsilon can't just disappear all at once, he needs to record the message we heard in the trailer, the one that ends with ""this is how I died.""  I think Carolina will get Epsilon to whatever laboratory Chorus has and they try their best, but it looks like Epsilon isn't going to make it. Big touching farewell to all his friends, and Epsilon accepts oblivion.  Sadness..  Then Church reappears and is like ""what the fuck just happened?"" Then Delta appears. Then Theta.  You see, EPSILON is dying.. but the Epislon A.I. is just a blank slate, a program lacking any personality that the memories of the A.I. exist within. Those ""memories"" are pretty much copies of the A.I. fragments. Epsilon isn't just simulating their personalities, those personalities really do exist within Epsilon.  Why I think this?   We treat the memories of Church as Church, not some A.I. using Church's memories to pretend to be Church. The memories of Beta/Tex were able to separate themselves from Epsilon and exist independently for some time. They're not just simulations. The memories of Omega scared Theta. Had Church been completely in control, Omega wouldn't have done that.   Epsilon is dying, but that's because the memories are pulling it apart. (Tex was special, being able to seperate herself without destroying Epsilon) When Epsilon dies, new A.I. will be created, copies of all the fragments.(minus Tex because she's a peace or something.)  So YAY! Church is back, as is Delta and Theta. Yay..  Wait..  Doesn't that mean?  Yep, Sigma and Omega are back as well.  Omega takes over someone (probably Doc, so there's Doc, Omega and Doc's insanity in one body), grabs Sigma and escapes.  Together, they meet up with Charon and offer them a deal. Sigma and Omega want to be The Meta again. If Charon helps them capture the other A.I. fragments, they'll help Charon complete their objectives.  Hell, when they become metastable they'll even run the Chairman's suit for him. The Chairman is trying to get an A.I. through official means, but who knows if and when that will happen. He said it will happen, but he's not exactly humble. I know he said Epsilon was too old, but I think a metastable A.I. should outclass any newer normal A.I. The A.I. were able to run Maine's suit back before Charon's upgrades.  So, Omega and Sigma end up paired up with Locus and Felix. The rest of the A.I. are shared among the reds and blues. End of season!"

RedvsBlue,3arlgm,GeminiRB,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:34:47 2015 UTC,"But as the Chairman said ""The director did leave an impact on this world."" So maybe just maybe omega left enough impact on Doc, the reds and blues will be able to salvage Omega. (I know I'm grasping at strings but, we can all hope)  As well if Epsilon fragments I can guess that the new AI will at least be able to get Carolina out of her mess, due to the AI's berth. As Carolina said in the Freelance Conicals ""The new AI are getting weaker all the time."" This insinuates that the fragment were strong. So just maybe the new AI chould be some what better than Epsilon."
RedvsBlue,3arlgm,jdofasgard,2,Tue Jun 23 10:46:47 2015 UTC,Nah it's too early for either of then to die.  This is probably just a precursor to something bigger happening in a few weeks.   I feel like it'll be an episode 19 or 20 reveal.  But that being said I hope the fragmentation thing is the route they go.    Church is too big of a part of the series for him to leave us.   If we get the fragments again....I'd be happy

Despite the trailer saying he dies, Church has now lived through so many recreations of himself, there's bound to be a come back.   For Carolina, if she loses Epsilon absolutely, it could mean her ultimate downfall. She's been relying on him too strongly in recent seasons. Where before, we saw her doing some bad-ass shit without any AI help, now, almost every fight, she's relying on him to run her equipment, while she tries too hard to do as she's done before.  So, if Epsilon is gone, even for a least a few episodes, this will be an eyeopener for Carolina. Hopefully, this is the start of a better Carolina. A Carolina who won't be 57% more likely to abandon her teammates, and she can correct that before Locus and Felix take complete advantage and she turns the tables on their asses."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Uganda-In-Particular,4,Tue Jun 23 06:31:15 2015 UTC,"Well the AI had such a great influence on Maine I think he isn't considered Maine anymore and just the meta. Not saying he's alive, but I think it's right to call him the Meta."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,locus782,3,Wed Jun 24 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"I do agree that the A.I. had a major impact on Maine, given the events of Season 8, but I think that Maine's reason was more closely related to the desire for power and the withdrawal that, say, an addict might go through.  I mean, having that much power, mixed with madness, suddenly yanked from your grasp?  It'd be enough to throw me into a mindless killing spree.  And he also showed several instances of humanity during that season that didn't make sense in the context of the Meta.  He make jokes and sarcastic comments to Wash (at least, it's implied by his responses) and generally seemed willing to work with both Doc and Wash.  In Season 10, it's even shown that Sigma was the one who created the idea of the 'Metastate', and that he was largely, if not utterly in control of Maine.  But since Sigma, as well as the other fragments are gone, Maine, even if he is alive, is not the Meta.  He's just a vicious, insane, incredibly powerful supersoldier."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Uganda-In-Particular,2,Wed Jun 24 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that Maine who is now called the Meta, AIs or not, could have survived the fall given the rule of fiction, if you don't see the body don't be sure they're dead."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,LadWatcherIsHere,35,Sun Jun 21 23:12:23 2015 UTC,"People keep using the word rampancy and I don't think they know what it means. Rampancy is the state of an AI where it completely loses sanity. This can usually involve trying to conquer the world, exponentially try to increase its influence, or just babble like a mental patient.   What Church is going through is more like trying to do more than he physically can. It's like overclocking himself and he's finally burning out. He isn't a Full AI like Alpha was. He's still  a fragment and thus, he can't handle doing things Full AI can do."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Aruseus493,14,Sun Jun 21 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"Didn't Cortana in H4 say that rampancy happens after 7 years and is literally when ""The AI think themselves to death"". The Director said that since they were fragments, they couldn't have a personality subroutine UNCHECKED. Nobody is checking Epsilon for personality subroutines. Fragments can go through Rampancy, just not unchecked. We've seen some traits; He had Melancholia when Tex shot him, and then when Tex died. He had anger when the BGC refused to help him, and he turned into a giant red thing. Jealousy might happen soon, and then comes Metastability... I think he is a unique AI, in the sense that when he goes rampant he won't JUST start going crazy.... He'll shed off the memories of the other AI in his brain, like he did with Tex in s8."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,84981725891758912576,3,Sun Jun 21 23:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think he made a big deal out of forgetting Tex, but is she really gone? He still remembers her and mentions her, and the fact that Omega or was it sigma still exists in his head shows he doesnt have total control over  them. So Tex could still be alive in there somewhere and if he starts splitting like others are theorizing he might, I could see Tex making a comeback."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Crocodilefan,8,Mon Jun 22 22:41:39 2015 UTC,i could see this as well. it seems almost like repressed not forgotten. that being said sigma is alpha's ambition so if he represses his ambition maybe thats why he cant do everything carolina wants him to do. everytime this happens though it seems like carolina is putting him through pain which is scary to me.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,slocke200,4,Tue Jun 23 21:03:40 2015 UTC,"Imagine, Blue Team makes it to the communications temple. Church is able to take control of ot but its too much, he's running too many processes at once between running Carolina's augmentations, trying to run the communication temple and fighting a captured (now evil, because he has to objective) Santa. He unconsciously splits himself. This time Delta is the first to emerge. And now that the process has begun he cannot stop it, he's splitting uncontrollably with his last moments of existence he codes the message from the trailer and sends it to the UNSC for whoever will investigate Hargrove. Milliseconds later he's gone, and all the fragments are no longer just memories, they're back, and they're all conscious in Carolina's head freaking the heck out. She screams and passes out falling into a coma with only the healing unit keeping her alive. The fragments have learned how to jump from on radio waves just like Alpha and Omega could. Omega jumps into Doc and Sigma escapes into whoever has Maine's upgraded suit, taking over and deleting Santa. The blues each take an AI in order to to help Carolina; Theta, Delta, Eata, Iota, and Gamma. Epsilon is gone completely. They just barely survive the battle and escape with only the hope that the signal went through. But Church is dead, Carolina is comatose and Sigma is in a power efficient suit with all the armor enhancements and is now hunting them for being in posession of the other fragments. Dr. Grey and Doc (who has slight resistance to Omega due to experience) are treating Carolina when she wakes up. Dr. Grey screams for all the ""freelancer people"" to get there immedietly. As everyone rushes into the room Carolina stands up and asks what happened.....in Tex's voice!"
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Crocodilefan,0,Wed Jun 24 01:37:55 2015 UTC,Halo universe is not canon. I'm certain I've heard Burnie say that before
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,EoinLikeOwen,7,Mon Jun 22 23:03:09 2015 UTC,As far as I know. Halo is cannon to rvb. Not vice versa though.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,hadezv2,2,Tue Jun 23 00:15:14 2015 UTC,I could be wrong here but I thought that the only connection between RvB and Halo is the fact that RvB is filmed in Halo?

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,hadezv2,2,Tue Jun 23 07:03:50 2015 UTC,"That was in season 1, theres a lot of stuff in seasons 1-5 that aren’t cannon."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,PerfectionismTech,2,Tue Jun 23 20:16:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, so there's a loose connection between Halo and RvB that the writers take a LOT of liberties with?"

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,hadezv2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about the four stages since season 10... wouldn't Church already be at the Meta state? I don't know about the rampancy, since we never really see him completely gone, but... he reached melencholia I'm betting after being tortured and told Wash and Tex died. Because after that, when Tex goes in for him, he... sound pretty depressed. And then, after Blood Gulch, you'd think at some point of that saga, he'd have gone off the deep end a few times. I'm just wondering if there is a way, through the memories, that Epsilon has had the experiences to reach the Meta state. Or since that was mostly Alpha, do you think it restarted the process?"
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,DarkRubberDucky,30,Sun Jun 28 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"A comparison I find really interesting. Carolina is kinda like the Meta now; specifically having lots of armor enhancements at one time. Plus she also (sort of) has all the A.I.  However, unlike the Meta who had multiple A.I. running multiple enhancements, Carolina has only got one A.I."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Animated95,24,Sun Jun 21 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"Oh my.  I mean, we all knew Church was going rampant at this point, but that was just brutal.  I think Carolina's going to live to fight another day though. Those trees probably broke her fall.  EDIT 1: Gotta show some love for Team Lieutenant. That was a pretty good plan they had."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,MarshallMelon,18,Sun Jun 21 22:19:45 2015 UTC,Yeah plus Miles said she would shine this season rather than just getting fucked up like last season. So I doubt this is the last of her.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,OtakuMecha,18,Sun Jun 21 22:29:12 2015 UTC,Are we forgetting the fact that this isn't the first time she gets tossed off from a cliff? Not even Meta survived that but Carolina did. Girl's got experience with these kind of situations.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,LadWatcherIsHere,19,Sun Jun 21 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, she had her grappling hook that time and this time she didn't. Still don't believe she's dead though."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,locus782,16,Sun Jun 21 23:47:40 2015 UTC,Coming to think about it. Sharkface caused her to fall with the grappling hook. Irony punch.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Mon Jun 22 01:35:29 2015 UTC,Oh yeah that whole fight was karma being a bitch.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,theYOLOdoctor,3,Mon Jun 22 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"On a related note, where is Carolina's own grappling hook. I remembered she always has a grappling gun with her cause that's her signature weapon."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,xFlyersFan94x,17,Tue Jun 23 08:58:14 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to throw in my own personal theory here. Back in Season 10, when all the Freelancers are sitting in the AI classroom, the screen showed this. The 3rd stage of AI Rampancy (in RvB) is jealousy, and can be considered a safe stage. In this stage, the AI will seek situations in which it can gather intellectual and physical knowledge. Another thing the screen says is that ""Hardware limitations will quickly become inefficient to contain the expanding construct."" Since we've seen Epsilon be able to do more things (such as the ability to project the other AIs, the ability to split himself into many copies when he disabled Tex, and possession from Omega), maybe the hardware just isn't keeping up with him? Not sure what the hardware could be though, besides the AI slots that each armor has.  edit: or hell maybe he's just getting old like hargrove said  edit 2: or he can't keep up with the hardware, similar to the meta."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Artyom_The_Cat,3,Sun Jun 21 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe a super-computer-like set up, if he's not getting old and failing? Like, a massive server array or something similar to what we saw Gamma in in the earlier season? It's possible that he is just getting old, and I'd imagine that set up would be quite inefficient for actually helping Carolina."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Odin_Crusades,16,Sun Jun 21 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"I got up early (5:00 in the UK) to watch this, and my fingers are shaking as I type. That was incredible.    Wash gets one up on Locus without having to fight him- soldier not a killer, using his mind and tactics.  I-r-o-n-y! Was great, and we see the Leiutenants work together. That warthog jump brought back some memories 'Life finds a way!' If Carolina didn't know who this guy was, she really does now (I want to see more of those flamethrower gauntlets!) Carolina is know to be a competent fighter, and it's shown by her quick reactions and usage of the enhancements (although they did drain the power).   As for her fate, I leave you this: ""Epsilon, run the healing unit!"" I have a feeling her last command will be carried out, to preserve her life.  I can only hope that this resolves itself with Carloina being recovered soon.  Doc/O'Malley was awesome. Good to have him back.   And props to the animation team! Great animation for the smoke, car and fight!"
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,chimney3,8,Mon Jun 22 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, Doc was gone!? I thought he was, uh... With red team?"

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,PerfectionismTech,2,Thu Jun 25 16:01:49 2015 UTC,I want to know why Church was running her camouflage unit (turning her grey).
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Odin_Crusades,4,Tue Jun 23 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"Mabye to give Carolina a split-second advantage when she jumped at Sharkface.Mabye it shows Epsilon losing control over what he can do. Idk, just brainstorming. Who knows what Miles has planned?"
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,JacksonSX35,3,Tue Jun 23 20:33:14 2015 UTC,He probably took her command literally under stress and started running all the enhancements she had.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,NextPorcupine,2,Wed Jun 24 20:12:08 2015 UTC,...flamethrower gauntlets!)   Sharkface is Yang confirmed.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,CBcube,17,Fri Jun 26 00:56:12 2015 UTC,"Carolina ain't dead. She definitely survived that fall. Miles wouldn't leave us with a cliffhanger and then next episode be like ""Oh, btw Carolina's dead."" It's sad to see Church deteriorating like this. It reminds me of the last mission in halo 4, when master chief gets inside the didact's ship, and cortana says ""I don't know what to do! I always know what to do!"" I'm getting a very similar vibe with Church."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Sickzaur,9,Mon Jun 22 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"That's probably what they were going for. Viewers have developed a relationship with the AI on this show like players of Halo developed a relationship with Cortana.

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,AAAHSPIDERS,35,Mon Jun 22 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a firm believer that Wash is the most badass of the freelancers. He's not the fastest or the strongest, but he's got to be the most mentally clear and he's determined to survive anything. The little quip at Locus he had is making me hope we finally get to see that."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Sickzaur,15,Sun Jun 21 22:49:45 2015 UTC,"I would say that he was the least damaged by the Freelancer program. Sure, he is screwed up emotionally and mentally from Epsilon, but compared to the others..."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,AAAHSPIDERS,28,Mon Jun 22 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"If he's the least damaged, it speaks volumes to his mental fortitude.   He got to see what the Director was doing, experienced all the pain and suffering Alpha went though, something that literally broke the Alpha apart, then got to experience what suicide was like.   After his first run in with Epsilon, his job became to collect the armor and enhancements from his dead team mates, as someone else said. People he knew and cared for had to be reduced to equipment, broken tools that were to be disposed of. During his Recovery One status, he tries to help someone he considers a friend, putting himself in harms way only to get betrayed, literally being shot in the back by South.   After healing up from being shot he gets to learn about the Red and Blues, something mentally trying at the best of times. He could have possibly bested Meta in their next meeting, if it weren't for the Red's terrible timing. Once they get to the PF building, he not only has the courage to let an AI back in his head, but has no problem with a plan that no one expects him to survive, just for the greater good of mankind.   He does survive though, again. For the third time, if you're keeping count. He gets detained in what we can only assume is one hell of a prison, adapts, and finds a way out. He has to put away his distrust and possible hatred of the meta to work with him, and at this point doesn't seem to have a problem with killing two people he knows just to prove a point, something that I'm sure weighed on him later.   After a clusterfuck of tracking, he gets to face off with Tex, and though he doesn't beat her, he's no slouch. Arguably, I'd say he did better than Wyoming, Main, and probably York the first time around. Then he gets betrayed, again. Are we keeping up on betrayals? I think we're up to 3 or 4, depending on what you count. After being very seriously wounded and fighting two of the best Project Freelancer has to offer, he's the one that comes up with the plan to kill Maine. And guess what? He survives, again. That's 4.   After all this, he's still showing compassion. He leads the blues, and doesn't hesitate to protect them from Carolina when it comes down to it. What does he get for all this? The UNSC tries to arrest him, again. Are we counting this as a betrayal? I mean, they sort-of got what they wanted, right? It doesn't matter though, because Wash is a badass and gets to show a bit of that as he takes down, I believe, 6 UNSC troops.   Let's fast forward a bit to where he gets shot by a fucking rail gun and then captured by Locus because he survived, again. 5. We know that after this, and after everyone being convinced, he immediately recognizes Locus as out of place,  and kept up an act to fool Locus and make him feel as though Wash wasn't a threat.   Fast forward a bit more and he gets betrayed by Locus. Does that really count since he knew something was wrong anyways? Sure. What are we at on the betrayal count? I've lost track. After this he gets to fight Locus one on one, and gets his ass kicked. Later we learned that he did this as a stall tactic, and even the dialog he gave was designed to throw Locus off. Bottom line? He came out on top from another ass beating.  tl:dr; Wash is a bit of a badass, and the best Freelancer ever, of all time."

It's going to reach a boiling point before they settle and start fighting together, it's ridiculous that the one rebel literally had to share cover over his dead body in this episode.  On another note, Church is either going to become a martyr or make an amazing comeback while Carolina is going to need to learn to fight without an A.I. to back her up again. She's obviously got the ability to fight without one, it'll be interesting to see her trying to adapt to fighting alone again though."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Fezman92,9,Tue Jun 23 10:25:34 2015 UTC,NO! Epsilon! That was so sad.. Now the real question is: did he release the other AI into rampancy or is he dead? I think the former.
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,vin0,4,Sun Jun 21 22:20:41 2015 UTC,What the fuck!?
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,jordan_bar,8,Sun Jun 21 23:04:29 2015 UTC,oh my god  locus please your obsession with wash is gonna get ur ass killed pls   cAROLINA NO THO E P S I L O N P L E A S E DONT  i guess that flicker we saw last episode was failing; sad it doesn't look like it was actually omega jumping last episode but nice to have that answer at least  kinda sad how little we saw of doc but i have the feeling that grey will be more than happy to spend some time with him
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Odin_Crusades,3,Sun Jun 21 22:21:05 2015 UTC,How did Sharkface avoid going over the cliff with Carolina if that avalanche was behind him?

Epsilon truly was failing, Sharkface kicked Carolina's ass, and O'Malley, if he's back, likely just infected Dr. Grey. At least everything is going good at the crashsite and Locus is likely going to get his ass kicked."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,stolersxz,20,Sun Jun 21 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"But O'Malley isn't back in the physical sense. Doc just has traits from him left over from being driven crazy like how Caboose does when he gets angry.  Also, there's a chance Sharkface might go for Wash now."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,digitalcat41,10,Sun Jun 21 23:41:08 2015 UTC,"Wash = 1, Locus = 0  Also, OH SHIT. Epsilon and Carolina are down! D:> Odds are that they're both alive, but broken.  I guess this means Sharkface is now on the hunt for Wash....  EDIT: Okay, some notes and thoughts upon further review:  If Carolina ends up surviving that fall, then Maine survived his. That cliff was bigger and she fell on solid ground, so if she ends up surviving after that, then all arguments saying Maine's fall killed him are invalid.  Honestly, I'm not sure that she survived the fall. Her armour and the rampant Epsilon might have, but it was a pretty steep fall. Still, the camera angle suggests otherwise. Like I said, if she's alive, she's no doubt physically broken.  EDIT #2: Back on the topic of Maine's fall, Epsilon wanted Carolina to aim for the lake in order to survive. That's almost word for word what happened to Maine, but apparently he didn't a survive that. If Epsilon expected Carolina to survive that kind of fall, then the same must go for Maine, whom we all know is far more durable. Point is, I'm taking this as confirmation that Maine is alive."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,84981725891758912576,21,Sun Jun 21 22:20:15 2015 UTC,"The Meta fell into icy water with holes in his armor, while chained to a Warthog. It's not the same thing."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,vin0,11,Sun Jun 21 22:21:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, Maine's armor was already retrieved by Hargrove. If Maine is alive, he certainly isn't fighting anymore."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,stolersxz,13,Mon Jun 22 00:55:32 2015 UTC,"If Sharkface is on the hunt for Wash now, I feel like Locus is going to stop him from killing Wash. Locus def wants to kill Wash himself at this point and I doubt he'll let this rando take it from him."

RedvsBlue,3amx4e,JacksonSX35,19,Tue Jun 23 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"Stabbed, shot, tied to a car and dropped into frozen water is different than falling. Carolina can put her armor in armor lock and protect her from the fall. Maine is dead."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Forikorder,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"Stabbed, shot   Both of which didn't seem to bother him.   tied to a car and dropped into frozen water   This episode suggests that a fall from that height into frozen water wouldn't be lethal, seeing as Epsilon apparently believed Carolina could survive that fall. I don't see how having a hook attached would kill him when he could easily unhook it.  Now, that's not to say that there wasn't any hypothermia involved immediately afterwards. Odds are that it either killed him, or knocked him out in such a way that the troops that arrived later mistook him for dead.  Point is, the fall wouldn't have killed him. Epsilon's comment is proof of that, and if Carolina ends up surviving, then that's all the more evidence in favour of him surviving. Again, hypothermia may have done him in, but still."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,SerJolton,15,Mon Jun 22 00:00:44 2015 UTC,"Just because he was so detached that he didn't react to pain doesn't mean his injuries wouldn't catch up to him alongside hypothermia. He's dead, and deserves to stay that way. He ran his course."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Dan_Of_Time,2,Mon Jun 22 00:13:08 2015 UTC,the difference in cold is pretty substantial
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Odin_Crusades,3,Wed Jun 24 06:36:20 2015 UTC,"Carolina would not be tied to a car sinking into the water. And she didn't have any substantial wounds. If she landed in a lake she could potentially swim to shore. Maine is tied to a sinking car. His armor is providing no protection to the water, and even if he detached and swam up, he is still next to a cliff with no way out of the water. Dead."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Dan_Of_Time,3,Mon Jun 22 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"Carolina fell on her own weight and hit a thick layer of pin trees, The Meta was tied to a car and hit pure ice, not snowy ground like Carolina, pure ice. She has a much better chance of survival"
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,Harbinger_Reaper,2,Mon Jun 22 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"As for her (Carolina's) fate, I leave you this: ""Epsilon, run the healing unit!"" I have a feeling her last command will be carried out, to preserve her life. Maine had fluctuating power, like Carolina, but no A.I. To run any of it. Carolina has a better chance of survival, as she is a 'born survivor' and has Epsilon, who could sacrifice himself to save her."
RedvsBlue,3amx4e,GGSoapMan,7,Mon Jun 22 04:27:43 2015 UTC,"THE HYPE TRAIN IS PULLING INTO THE STATION!  Seriously though I am super fucking hyped for this.

How I imagine it going down: ""Alright, as much as I want to see this idiot kill you, I can't let that happen...""blah blah and blah, I can't write anymore.  PS: This probably not 100% accurate...also, it won't be the Tex we knew, but I would kill to see Carolina's reaction...assuming she makes it."

It may not be LP numbers but 400,000 just for the trailer isn't bad.   Plus don't forget RvB is in its 13th season so already has a strong established fan base.

Sarge is just an idiot and thought the rest of them traveled into the future."

RedvsBlue,3adodc,alynnidalar,14,Fri Jun 19 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"Not sure what there is to explain? This is how canon for most things work... the most recent stuff is the most canon, then older stuff and things the showrunners say, and so on.  EDIT: or do you mean about the time travel? No, it's not directly explained, but there's sufficient references to it not happening that it's fairly obvious. For example, once they start meeting people outside of Blood Gulch in season 6, it's pretty obvious they aren't hundreds of years in the future."
RedvsBlue,3adodc,alynnidalar,2,Fri Jun 19 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"yeh i was meaning the time travel, what i mean is that theres things in between things shown recently and the hierarchy that you have to basically make a theory which isnt exactly canon, gamma putting alpha in a simulation for example is still just a fan theory that explains things"
RedvsBlue,3adodc,Forikorder,6,Fri Jun 19 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's not a fan theory--Burnie has talked about it in interviews and I think it was mentioned on one of the commentaries. It's never been mentioned overtly in the show, but I would still consider it more-or-less canon."
RedvsBlue,3adodc,alynnidalar,-1,Fri Jun 19 17:43:54 2015 UTC,thats not really evidence its just retconning  if the time travel never happened then the yellow church in caboose should never have existed but he did and flowers would still be alive  and gamma running it as a torture session makes even less sense since Church wasnt really bothered by it he just accepted it after the first go round and didnt really care until he realised he was probably on the last one and might die
RedvsBlue,3adodc,Commander_Cobe,3,Sat Jun 20 06:31:22 2015 UTC,"As I think I've pointed out to you in the past, Burnie has said explicitly in interviews that even at the time, he was writing it as if the time travel didn't actually happen. This is because while writing the season, he already knew Church was an AI, and therefore needed a plausible explanation for him not going rampant. That explanation was that Church didn't actually go back in time."

RedvsBlue,3adodc,Commander_Cobe,3,Mon Jun 22 16:11:57 2015 UTC,"Finally found the right one! Here it is.  There's a lot of really interesting stuff in there (all Burnie's interviews are great), but the time travel stuff starts around 12:30 (he starts off by talking about how Yellow Church is a joke, then ends up going into time travel--this is also one of the many places he's talked about how they knew Church was an AI back in BGC).  Here's a Burnie quote (cleaned up slightly):   One of the biggest issues I wanted to tackle with explaining why Church is in a big loop is I wanted to be able to tackle how does an AI, who lives in the Halo universe for seven years, how does an AI live for eight hundred years? And why would Church be an exception to that? And he's not. So I had to come from a different angle to set up how Church was traveling through time. [...] So, knowing that he is not rampant and that he is not dead, there must be some explanation for why he didn't. And the only possible explanation for that is he didn't go beyond seven years, and that he still hasn't. [...] And so I had to make sure that I wrote something that was bulletproof enough to where Church did not live beyond seven years, and I had to write that at that point in time.   There's a lot more important context, plus some really interesting stuff about the Director and splitting the Alpha, but that's kind of the relevant quote."

RedvsBlue,3adodc,Forikorder,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:58:03 2015 UTC,"Commenting to remind myself to respond to you later. He's talked about it several times, but there's one interview in particular where he explicitly talked about all the decisions that went into the time loops/time travel, it's pretty interesting. I don't have the link at work, though, just on my home computer.  From brief googling, it might be this interview I'm thinking of: www.jengajam.net/2009/10/burnie-vs-lfto.html  I think it was a JengaJam interview, anyway. I know there were a couple with Burnie, so this might not be the right one. (don't have time now to listen to it to check, sorry :/)"
RedvsBlue,3adodc,alynnidalar,-2,Mon Jun 22 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"so if Burnie came out tomorrow and said donut was actually a woman and they always intended for him to be a woman and anything that pointed otherwise was simply misinterpreted would you simply say ""of course donut is a woman it makes perfect sense""?  i dont care what he saids the fact of the matter is that is quite clear that AT THE TIME they did in fact Travel through time, at the very least Church did, and theres nothing you can say that shows othewise because   you cant explain how Flowers died you cant explain Yellow Church you cant explain PFL sending a tank pre-programmed to kill the Alpha you cant explain Church and Griffs cell door opening you cant actually even explain a scenario where Wyoming and Gamma would go through so much effort without the slightest tiniest chance of getting something in return, even if they were trying to fragment they didnt even do anything to make him suffer"
RedvsBlue,3adodc,Forikorder,2,Sun Jun 21 04:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, fine, whatever, there's a couple plot holes. Yellow Church is and was always just a joke, by the way, and judging by what Sister said, Flowers legitimately did die from a heart attack. (that's why even going into the simulation, Church already knew Flowers died from a heart attack and was trying to prevent it) And I have no clue what you're talking about with Sheila, she was never programmed to kill Church and I'm not sure why you think she was.   But there's also plot holes if the time travel did happen, anyway, and big ones. If the time travel happened, why didn't Church go rampant after thousands of years? If the Director had access to actual time travel, why didn't he use it to go back in time to save Allison, or at least fix the problems of Project Freelancer? If the time travel actually happened, why is it literally never brought up again except when people are questioning whether or not it actually happened? (such as Tex in season 5 talking about how York is still alive) If Church really did go back and muck about with the previous timeline, several dozen times even, how did he possibly escape being noticed for so long?  You can't just be like ""there's a couple plot holes over here, CLEARLY THIS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THING HAPPENED."" Even in the BGC itself it's pretty obvious the time travel didn't happen if you pay attention. There were a lot of people already questioning it before the BGC even ended, and that was without knowing yet that Church was an AI."

During season 3, Burnie certainly knew Church was an AI and was writing him as one. I would argue that there's strong evidence as early as season 2 that he was being written as an AI even then--when he and Tex are possessing Caboose's mind, for example, they look exactly like how Omega does, even though he's an AI and supposedly they're ""ghosts"".

RedvsBlue,3adyek,Crocodilefan,3,Tue Jun 23 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's complicated.  Basically, there are tiers of advancement for A.I.  Lowest tier is made up of programs like F.I.L.S.S. Very advanced compared to what we can do today, but was probably programmed by people typing out code.  Next tier are the A.I. fragments, Delta, Sigma etc. They're probably too complex to be programmed by hand. We saw how they're created.  Nex tier are true A.I. like Alpha. They're created by scanning a human mind and using it to construct an A.I.  The final tier is a metastable A.I. Metastable A.I. are currently only theoretical, and we're not sure how to create them.  Lopez is an anomaly. He was built by Sarge using a ""standard robot building kit."" But, I think Sarge probably programmed him himself. This should mean Lopez should be tier one, but I think his complexity could be anywhere between tier one and three.  Sarge is an idiot. He probably didn't know it was impossible to write an A.I. as complex as Lopez from scratch. Because he didn't know it was impossible he was able to do it.  Lopez is as complex as he is because it's funny, and reality can be ignored for the sake of a good joke.  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny  Only after getting fixed by Lopez did Sheila become more advanced.

It pretty much has to be a plot from PR becasue they are the only ones where we see faces, they did show carolina and york so it can't be to preserve the facelessness for later series. So what if ""Wash"" is really another surviving freelancer but that feels like a ""screw you"" to the fanbase, or it could be another revelation like the Director's eyes."

I love Locus and Felix's characters so much, but if I think if any of that crew had to join a 'team' it probs be Sharkface. His story reflects Wash's and Carolina's with the anger at Freelancer pretty well. Of course, another character mad and overcoming anger at Freelancer mighttt be a bit stale at this point. 0:   It'd be an interesting thing to see how RvB, if Locus does convert, how they're gonna to deal with the redemption of a man who literally almost caused a genocide for a paycheck."

RedvsBlue,3a4ks0,Libertyprime117,3,Sat Jun 20 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"Here is how I think everyone's mind would look (just my opinion, not what I think is fact):  Grif's head:sarge is evil, but really dumb and Simmons is an annoying nerd, but a very sexually attractive one. Meanwhile Caboose is ridiculously dumb, Tucker is actually quite like himself and Church is this actually quite reasonable A.I. Finally Wash has control issues, he needs to be in charge of everything or else he goes total bitch mode.  Simmons: sarge is almost literally his benevolent father and Grif is a lazy slob. Church is an insanely aggressive A.I. and Donut wants to sleep with him. Tucker on the other hand is kinda like the guys he didn't really get on with at school let's just say...  Sarge: Grif is horridly insubordinate whilst Simmons is an excellent solider. Caboose is kinda weird blue and Washington is untrustworthy and Machiavellian. Tucker, however, is a respectable solider.  Tucker: Caboose is so dumb he can't even breathe, while Simmons is actually a really smart guy. Grif is lazy, but curios and creative. Sarge is a great leader, if a little detached from reality. Donut is gay, and Tucker kinda isn't ok with that... He's not homophobic per say just a little weirded out by it. Washington is an inspirational leader and basically Tucker's role model.   Wash: Tucker is an epic fighter, Simmons is an idiot who thinks he's so smart and Grif is a troubled kid who just needs to learn disaplin, courage and self belief. On the other hand Caboose is a ""special"" yet self actualised and all together good kid. Sarge is a delusional maniac but a good leader really dedicated to the cause. Donut is just crazy.   Coralina: Grif is lazy, insubordinate and greed, the worst possible solider... And everything she fears she is. Tucker is a pervert obsessed with her and Simmons is a weird geek. Washington is a competent solider yet has managed to form friendships after the collapse of freelancer, she envies and hates this greatly. Caboose and Sarge are insane, just completely insane.  Oh and in everyone's mind, Carolina is a total psychotic Bitch."
RedvsBlue,3a4ks0,Libertyprime117,3,Wed Jun 17 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"Even though I would love it I doubt they would do it because there is no comedy there and if there is it's to forced. Cabooses head had all these exaggerated wrong characters to show how stupid he was but other characters minds will be pretty accurate to what they would be like in real life with vety subtle changes grid would be a little more lazy in Simmons head, everyone one would like wash a lot better in his head than in real life or the opposite. If they were to do this it would be in cabooses head but there would be more characters, what I think is strange about cabooses head is that there is no one else from his life other than the characters in the canyon which actually supports a lot of fan theories"

RedvsBlue,39ujvi,Forikorder,35,Mon Jun 15 02:30:20 2015 UTC,"dude was a secretary who got put in charge of an army, just remember that part"

RedvsBlue,39ujvi,InfiniteStrong,23,Mon Jun 15 15:22:50 2015 UTC,I feel so bad for Doc. Also yeah Doyle has some balls.
RedvsBlue,39ujvi,craigmej,7,Sun Jun 14 22:32:19 2015 UTC,"They could have at least pretend to have missed him. He would have been so willing to buy it, but they didnt even put forth the  smallest effort."

RedvsBlue,39ujvi,vin0,64,Sun Jun 14 22:24:23 2015 UTC,I don't think Omega is actually back unless people are kidding.  Pretty sure that was just a result of Doc going insane from the other dimension.
RedvsBlue,39ujvi,PrinceCheddar,16,Sun Jun 14 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"See it might be that but the flickering from Epsilon makes me wonder if it is something else? The only time we saw another flickering with Epsilon is when Delta finished decoding the manifest so (if I remember correctly I'm on mobile while writing this so I can be sure). idk it is exciting to see if doc has lost his mind or if it is Omega.  There was also mention from the Counselor about how Wash won't accept AI? It's either linked with Epsilon dying, but since Omega is the only one who can jump without a neural implants.  However, the Omega we see interacting with Epsilon is just a memory?"
RedvsBlue,39ujvi,Crocodilefan,9,Mon Jun 15 01:06:57 2015 UTC,I think that this time with Epsilon flickering is because they were losing energy.
RedvsBlue,39ujvi,infernal_llamas,3,Mon Jun 15 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"It could be that, and it was my first thought when I watched it. With Omega possibly showing up again? Makes me really excited for next week though.   He also flickered after the bubble shield was down, I thought. I could be wrong; I didn't have the chance to to re watch the episode."
RedvsBlue,39ujvi,ThaGreatIsaiah,5,Mon Jun 15 01:25:54 2015 UTC,"However, the Omega we see interacting with Epsilon is just a memory?    You mean the episode where Church is interacting with Theta and Delta?  I think the ""memories"" of the A.I. are more than just information accessed by Epsilon. I think they're, more or less, copies that exist within the blank slate that is Epsilon.  Hence why we treat Church as Church rather than some A.I. using Alpha's memories to pretend to be Church, and why the memories of Tex were able to separate themselves from Epsilon and act independently from him. Church is the Alpha, so he's one in control of the Epsilon A.I., and Tex was special, so she was able to leave without much trouble. Church doesn't have absolute control, since Omega was able to come out and frighten Theta, which had he been just something Epsilon did, wouldn't have happened.  I think the ""death"" of Church hinted at during the trailer is the death of the Epsilon, but not of Church. Epsilon will pull itself apart, recreating all the separate A.I. fragments, including Church. (except Beta because she's at peace or whatever)  And then Sigma and Omega will find some way to join up with Charon. Sigma will offer the Chairman a deal. Either he can wait however long it takes to get a new A.I. through proper methods, and there's no telling how long that might take, (the chairman's confident he'll get one but he's not really very humble) or he can help him and Omega capture the other memory fragments, become The Meta once more and finally become metastable.  I think the metastable A.I. should be more powerful than even the newer A.I. the Chairman has his eye on, since a metastable A.I. is supposed to be some holy grail of artificial intelligence theory. A metastable A.I. should be able to run the suit fine, the A.I.s of The Meta were able to do it before Charon had made all the upgrades. The chairman originally dismissed Epsilon because he thought it was just a copy of Alpha with memories, rather than a collection of all the A.I.  And, rather than have all their eggs in one basket, Omega and Sigma pair up with Felix and Locus, until they capture all the other A.I. and they're ready to become The Meta all in one go.  That's my theory at least. I don't think Omega is in Doc ATM, but perhaps it's foreshadowing his return?  *edit* Omega and Sigma escape by Omega taking over Doc again, and Doc, Doc/Omega and proper Omega argue. XD   There was also mention from the Counselor about how Wash won't accept AI?    Wasn't that false though? Washington only told the councilor that he'd never have an A.I. because he knew he wouldn't be able to hide the knowledge of Alpha's torture from it. He needed to keep the knowledge a secret, otherwise he wouldn't be allowed to bring PF to justice. I had Alpha with him just before the EMP."

Caboose, the only other one to ever have Omega also laughed somewhat evilly. This might be a sign that Omega will pop out of Epsilon as he goes into rampancy?    Or is it a sign that AIs do, in fact, leave a shadow even if they get EMPed, as someone theorized on here?"

God the animation on the snow-mountain scene is just gorgeous.   DOYLE!!! <3 Oh my god I did not see that coming. What an awesome hero moment. Please don't die.  The deconstruction of the 'everyone on the team getting one line' thing was pretty funny. Oh Wash, please don't do something stupid 0_0  Pffffft Caboose and the nickname.   And since I've been waiting to see the aliens/Junior come back I did NOT see that coming at all! Doc :D Good god the lampshading on forgetting Doc was great. And the O'Malley voice! Is that pure nostalgia fuel or are they reminding us of Omega for a reason? I wonder if Doc's after finding something in his journey that'll help everyone else. As a side note, I don't think that was actually Omega unless that line about the time-twisted dimension was really important. Remember back in S2 where Caboose 'remembered' how to get angry because of Omega? I think Doc is just really fucking unhinged at this point and is just imitating the memories of Omega he had in the past. I still think it's important that they reminded us of Omega, I just don't think he's actually with Doc. (But if he is, Delta better come back!!)  This was great, and it felt like the last bit of setup before the 'big' episodes. Granted we're only at EP10 and last season went until 19. If the length will be similar, still have a ways to go."

Tex got Omega back, hooked up Wyoming's helmet to a ship, and used Wy's freelancer equipment. Wy's equipment allowed him the ability to manipulate Space and Time, much like the Future Cubes. When Doc got cubed he could have wound up in the same dimension that Wyoming's equipment would use. Doc could have been trying to radio for help, Omega picks it up, and transfers over.

RedvsBlue,39mkhl,eden_delta,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:17:20 2015 UTC,tuckers key doesnt work on Chorus though so kinda pointless to specifically kill him for the key when killing him is already in the plan
RedvsBlue,39mkhl,Forikorder,7,Sat Jun 13 06:55:09 2015 UTC,"tuckers key doesnt work on Chorus   Except it does. We saw him use it to access the Weapon Temple in S13E04. If it didn't work on Chorus then him, Sarge, Caboose, and Dr. Grey would still be back at the tower trying to turn it on."
RedvsBlue,39mkhl,eden_delta,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:58:45 2015 UTC,"what happened immediately after? Santa turned it all back off, only the great key of Chorus is accepted there was just a mistake when he sensed a great key while his wasnt claimed he couldnt tell the difference between them at first Tuckers key was enver supposed to be on Chorus"
RedvsBlue,39mkhl,Forikorder,3,Sat Jun 13 14:35:54 2015 UTC,Santa shut everything off because Tucker didn't give the proper response to his question. He then brought them to the Jungle Temple in order to test that the presence of a second Key wasn't an error. Once he confirmed Tucker's Key was legitimate he said it was acceptable for use on Chorus.
RedvsBlue,39mkhl,GeminiRB,-1,Sat Jun 13 16:37:45 2015 UTC,no he said it was a legitimate key not the great key of chorus
RedvsBlue,39mkhl,GeminiRB,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"In all honesty. I feel either one of the villains, Sharkface, Felix, or Locus, will end up with the key in a sort of Good vs Evil situation where both have the power to destroy the planet. If not one of them then maybe Caboose will have it because he was the one able to get Santa. Or from a Red vs Blue stand point maybe Griff will have it because he seems to be the one on Red team to get the iconic weapons such as the Brute Shot/Griff Shot. There are really a multitude of possibilities."

That might’ve just been a standard-issue thing, especially since Tex has one in season one as well. We're never shown South using any other sort of equipment in the Project Freelancer flashbacks, but that would make sense if her equipment was an energy shield, since that’s shown to be extremely dangerous to use without an AI. She starts using it in Reconstruction after she gets Delta, but I guess it’s possible she took North’s. But I don’t see any reason to assume she didn’t have a domed energy shield all along, especially since doing so creates this plot hole. Plus I always liked the idea that they gave North and South the same equipment to go along with the whole twin theme."

This may ultimately reveal him to enemies on the battlefield, but it is a good means of disguising yourself. Knowing that, we can assume that he deployed this style of camouflage against Wash, who was actively hunting him, but not on Freelancers that he'd cornered alone like South as there would be little point in hiding your identity from a dead man."
RedvsBlue,39hbcn,-SpaceCommunist-,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:07:37 2015 UTC,But he didn't get the cloak until he stole it from Tex...
RedvsBlue,39hbcn,HidariRyoushin,2,Thu Jun 11 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not. In the opening shots of Reconstruction, he can be seen with the Active Camouflage being used. Plus, the last surviving simulation trooper from Valhalla--Private Henderson--described, to the best of his ability, the fact that the Meta was using active camouflage.  Even if he went for Tex first, and then used the Active Camouflage to disguise himself, the Overshield is pretty distorting as it is, and he could have easily used the Adaptive Camouflage to help hide his identity (it would explain why he is brown and red at the end of Recovery One)."
RedvsBlue,39hbcn,-SpaceCommunist-,2,Thu Jun 11 23:42:40 2015 UTC,Adaptive camouflage was carolinas. Maine took it off her when she was thrown off the cliff... so yeah.
RedvsBlue,39hbcn,hadezv2,2,Fri Jun 12 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"Technically, he didn't take it off of her. He simply took out her AI, then threw her off the cliff. There was no exchange of equipment between the two. Odds are, he stocked up on what equipment he could during the chaos before the Mother of Invention crashed on Sidewinder, and then left to pursue AI.  The best evidence I have to back this up is that, by Season 12, Carolina had a Healing Unit and an EMP, both of which she could never have acquired if those modules were the only ones that existed (York's healing unit was taken by Wash, and his EMP was presumably taken by the Meta at the end of Recovery One). However, equipment like the Temporal Distortion Unit would almost certainly be scarce or produced after the Freelancer break-in, explaining why Maine had to get it from Wyoming's helmet).  Point is, he probably already had some equipment like invisibility and adaptive camouflage since they may have been much more common, whereas others like the temporal distortion and the bubble shield had to be acquired from other Freelancers."

RedvsBlue,39hbcn,HidariRyoushin,2,Fri Jun 12 07:29:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, I am more concerned how Washington deliberately faked South's death so Command didn't know he hadn't killed her, and that Command is aware of this deception and continued to trust him, which was really fucking stupid since he went on to destroy all the AIs.  Conversely,  the Counselor refers to South as Wash's ""partner"" even though they clearly weren't working together - he had no knowledge of South's status as Recovery Two and it would have been really fucking rich of them to use that term when they deliberately set up a situation where they gave him an order they knew he would disobey, only then leading to any sort of partnership or teamwork between them.  He must have been absolutely irate when that became clear.  Going even further,  do you think that Command would have made South aware that they were going to roll the dice on Wash disobeying an order to kill her?  Did they plan on her brother dying?  That whole scenario with Wash was planned, and North's distress beacon never would have gone off without injury or death, so was Command counting on South getting him killed?  Had they outright ordered her to?  I can't imagine that, but South did claim that everything went to plan after she shot Wash ( though she did blame that on the Meta.)  Was North also a Recovery agent?  How would that whole scenario have played put if North was still alive?"
RedvsBlue,39hbcn,ChickadeeAce,3,Fri Jun 12 11:42:36 2015 UTC,"Seeing as South was clearly working with Command the whole time (although it's doubtful they knew she deliberately set North up to get killed), I always assumed that they knew Wash wouldn't actually go through with killing her and set up the scenario to get both Wash and South into the scenario they actually wanted them to do--take down the Meta. In particular, they may have thought South might be sufficiently grateful to work with Wash afterward.  Of course, the plan didn't work, but that was my interpretation. The Director was always about getting people to do stuff without explicitly telling them what was going on.  It's possible they intended to get Wash to hook up with North and South in a different way (so the three of them could take on the Meta), or that this was simply a last-minute throw-it-in moment by the Director to take advantage of the situation."
RedvsBlue,39hbcn,alynnidalar,2,Fri Jun 12 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I just thought of something further.  This is kind of ugly.  And it rather relies on much later events in Season 10, so not sure that it holds much water.    Wash believed that he was selected as Recovery One due to his history with Epsilon, and his statement that he couldn't see himself ever able to work with another Freelancer or AI again.  He thought that the Counselor and Director believed that this would prevent him from going rogue and stealing an AI, just like South did (hello, irony.)  But we also know that at least the Director had suspicions regarding Washington - after Washington was sedated we see the Counselor turn to the Director and ask something like ""what was that he said about goodbyes?""    It very well could be that the Counselor and the Director knew how Wash would react to save South, but also how South would react to betray Wash.  Wash was useful, but he was also a liability that the Director was suspicious of.  If they truly thought he was valuable due to his unique position in regards to an aversion to AI, they wouldn't have thrown him in with someone as unpredictable as South and kept him in the dark in regards to her position.  They could have identified the Meta AND taken note of how he fought without the gap in knowledge and communication that came keeping Wash uninformed.  Maybe with North there, they could have had a chance to defeat him - he hadn't harvested Tex's or Wyoming's equipment or AIs at this point, and wouldn't have had the added advantage that would have come with them.  Further, if the Director and the Counselor knew of North's actions when he confronted South in order to let Tex escape and find Alpha, they could have seen this as an opportunity to clean house and get rid of two possible liabilities at once.  That's pretty horrible.  And keeping with their MO.  South would have been an easy pawn to manipulate."

RedvsBlue,39hbcn,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's going to happen with any show that has so many seasons.  Each season's story gets sort of locked in, and writers find themselves stuck with the decision to either contradict small details in order to continue with an amazing story, or sacrifice something incredible just so the fans won't bicker over small details that ultimately matter very little when you look at the series as a whole.  Plus, do we have any idea how far into the future they were looking with the whole Freelancer thing?  I would give a pretty to know how much they had mapped out at this point, and what changed between Recovery One and Season 10.    Writing something like this is like baking a loaf of bread - it's a satisfying and stimulating process, and what holes are there in the final product don't keep it from tasting fucking fantastic.  Mmm... tasty tasty plot holes."
RedvsBlue,39brbq,sirmonkey95,21,Wed Jun 10 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize this was such an issue.  But I do want to point out that while Tex is Church's memory of Allison, she DOES go by the name ""Allison."" I would call her Allison II or something. Except she's not a giant plant with weird lips singing about eating people. No wait...that's Audrey.  It's the same reason Alpha and Epsilon are called Church, except that it seems Alpha has/had more of the original Church's memory, which is what makes him think Tex was his girlfriend. And Epsilon is TECHNICALLY more of a copy of Alpha than Alpha was of Chuch/Director during Bloodgulch era. After all, he has most of Church's memories, a bit of his personality, and all of the blanks filled in by Caboose. Epsilon, while a different entity, might as well be Alpha.

RedvsBlue,39brbq,KlavTron,2,Thu Jun 11 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"This is good, but I think there are some problems.  First, I don't think Alpha is just bitterness. When we see him in Season 9, he sounds like Church instead of the Director, so i think he's always been like what we've seen, it's just that the torture resulted in him creating a bunch of extreme alternate personalities that were then extracted from him. The A.I. fragments were like tumors, forced into growing large enough to exist independently.   I think Alpha reflects how the Director was like before the loss of Alison. Since Alpha always had Beta, he was never the man who surrounded himself in work to try and forget his grief. Alpha lost a lot of memories, forgetting the torture and even that he was an A.I., but was more or less the same person from creation to end.. at least, in my opinion.  As for Epsilon, I think the Epsilon A.I. is more or less a blank slate that contains copies of A.I. We think of Epsilon-Church as Church rather than an A.I. using Church's memories to pretend to be him. When Alpha and Epsilon were close in season 5, when Alpha got headaches and visions, I think that was Epsilon copying Alpha to it. The entity we call Epsilon is pretty much Alpha. He's just less a dick because he's gone through character development, learned about himself and junk like that. He's got all the Director's memories, Alpha's per-torture memories and Alpha's memories up to just before the EMP. He's Alpha, with his memories restored, just inside Epsilon.  I think the ""memories"" of the A.I. we saw in season 12 are all, more or less, exact copies. Hence why Omega was able to interact with Church when Church clearly didn't want him to because he scared Theta. Had Omega just been a lifeless memory, it wouldn't have been able to do that. Also, Epsilon-Tex was able to separate itself from the rest of Epsilon, proving that these ""memories "" are more complex than they appear.   As for Beta.. I wouldn't say she's the memory of the perfect soldier. I think the director just remembers thinking of Alison as a badass and in his grief and love, focused on that memory, making Beta way more badass than Alison was in real life.  In real life, I think Alison was probably a bit of a bitch while being a bit of a badass, who the Director fell in love with. They started dating. As they grew older, Alison became less a bitch and more mature, becoming a mother. Then she died, and the Director obsessed over her, specifically how she was when he first fell in love with her. He remembers her as a badass and a bit of a bitch, so Tex is a badass and a bitch."

So when he likes something, he HAS to tell you or show you it and insist that you'll like it too.  Yes. My brother was super into the show at the same time as me and he ended up showing my wife (then girlfriend) huge chunks of the show, she didnt like it then and it only increase as he watched more with her because she had no other options. So when it comes around to me watching it with her a few years later, she refused and tells me why. It takes a few months of me watching it while she is asleep before she relents and at least lets me listen to it while she is doing other things at the same time."

RedvsBlue,394yu9,slocke200,19,Tue Jun 9 08:07:07 2015 UTC,All York did was love Carolina and wanna help her. She never reciprocated those feeling. She only came to fully understand his feeling once he was dead.
RedvsBlue,394yu9,seraphofdark,15,Tue Jun 9 12:15:37 2015 UTC,"No, I think that she did have feelings for York.  But she was too ambitious and focused on being the best.  She was constantly pushing herself, working harder than anyone else, way past the point that it was healthy.  That was priority, everything else secondary, and when Tex showed up, everything secondary was shut down completely.    She felt so jealous and threatened by Tex that she couldn't see York's motives for supporting her, and saw it only as betrayal both to the Freelancers, and to her.  She clearly regretted what happened with him, or she never would have visited the place where he died, but it took Church showing her York's confidence in her, and then later his disappointment/grief that it was Tex, and not Carolina that was alive and causing a ruckus, to really hit home and begin to allow her to change her point of view.  She still struggled after that, as the final fight with the Tex-clones showed, but that was the first point where she could begin to change and heal."
RedvsBlue,394yu9,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. In season 9, she clearly has feelings (though maybe not deep love) for him, even her voice kind of lowers when she talks to him, and its sounds like she's smiling. Though the same could be said most of the times she makes a joke in early s9. She's the first one, and the most concerned, when he gets blown up. She is excited to see him out of recovery, and checks to make sure he's really okay.  And likely, she feels conflicted about who to blame for his death. Herself, for not trusting him and going with him, despite Tex. Tex, for putting him in the situation. The Director? Wyoming? Now, she's faced with all of her dead friends, her father, the man she loved, or was coming to have deeper feelings for, all in a short amount of time.  Carolina is one hell of a tragic character. Of the characters with a similar past (Alpha, Washington) she's the one not really able to completely come to grips with her loss. Alpha was able to let go, and is now becoming a slightly less harsh version of himself. Washington is slowly becoming a mix of early Freelancer Wash (all jokes and bendy straws) and the hard-ass who was the one to recover the armor of his dead friends.  Meanwhile, Carolina is still transitioning. Add to that, she seems to also be suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, she's currently having to help save a whole planet, and fighting guilt, as shown by her nightmares. That's why I'd love to see York come back. To help Carolina. And because they'd make super cute babies with green eyes."

RedvsBlue,394yu9,Toasiddy,4,Tue Jun 9 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"Are we going by the definition of a ""tragic character"" or by just a character who suffered under tragic circumstances?    I'd agree with /u/Toasiddy that Alpha had a pretty tragic time, but in terms of who fell the hardest by their own devices, I'd have to say the Director, though I wouldn't call him a ""tragic hero"" by any means.  Either Washington or Carolina would have had the ""tragic hero/heroine"" title in the bag if they would have continued to crash and burn, but luckily they both managed to redeem themselves."

RedvsBlue,394yu9,itmakessenseincontex,4,Tue Jun 9 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say Carolina. She lost her Mum at a young age, and the Director doesn't seem like he was the most attentive father. She joined a program run by her father, and spent most of that time striving for his attention and respect, only to be replaced and pitted against an artificial intelligence program based off of her father's memories of her mother. not only that, but she watched as her team tore itself apart and was unable to do anything as most of them died.. She played a ey role in the death of her father, and never got to properly say goodbye to her teammates.

RedvsBlue,3944wu,Anathe,12,Tue Jun 9 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the ideas below are canon explanations, but the team has said before that lots of BGC stuff is incompatible with the universe they created, and as such is considered to be mental trains of thought by certain characters. I.E. Not canon."
RedvsBlue,3944wu,JacksonSX35,17,Tue Jun 9 05:19:08 2015 UTC,"Rule of funny.  Also, /u/JacksonSX35 isn't saying it's not canon, it's that it wasn't what actually happened--it's what the characters thought happened. From Church and Sarge's viewpoint, they were ghosts, so they said it was the afterlife or whatever. In reality, Sarge was in armorlock and Church, the head-hopping AI that he is, was in Sarge's mind, so he could talk to him similar to how Church spoke to Tex while she was in armorlock."
RedvsBlue,3944wu,zacablast3r,2,Tue Jun 9 05:56:07 2015 UTC,"I argue this simply because church had no reason to enter Sarge's mind, and had been ejected once Sarge was shot. I know that it makes little sense in the scheme of the show, but I think the best explanation is that sarge was hallucinating and on the brink of dying, and this is what he saw. I say that because the show really can't cover everything as canon, especially in the BGC (I.e. The armor changing between Halo 1 and 2, but they ultimately chose to say that it's the same armor), so some stuff either doesn't have an explanation or is considered to occur in a character's mind, last I heard."

RedvsBlue,3900jv,Johnny-raven,23,Mon Jun 8 06:44:41 2015 UTC,"It's certainly the worst from a technical perspective--the audio in particular is pretty atrocious.  But from a writing perspective? Well, I think there's a reason half the biggest RvB jokes are from season 1. I still think it's really, really funny. It definitely hadn't hit its stride yet, it's still closely tied to the ""they're all playing multiplayer Halo"" concept. They hadn't figured out what they were doing yet, so it always feels kinda disconnected from the rest of the show (even though it set up a ton of important stuff).  As a result, I have a hard time saying whether season 1 is ""good"" or ""bad""--it kinda depends on your perspective. On its own, I think it's hilarious and very enjoyable. When you compare it to the rest of RvB, well, it's still really funny, but it doesn't mesh with the rest of the series as well as some other seasons. So it depends on what you're looking for, IMO.  At any rate, RvB is a show where at its worst, it's miles ahead of most other shows out there, so even if you do consider season 1 the ""worst"", that's still pretty good in my book."
RedvsBlue,3900jv,alynnidalar,22,Mon Jun 8 11:59:52 2015 UTC,It's different depending on what you like. I loved it for the dialog. It has some of the funniest moments for me.
RedvsBlue,3900jv,StandAloneBluBerry,10,Mon Jun 8 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"After binge watching the show in Netflix, I have to say that I loved Season 1. It's where the show gets its heart, and it keeps that comical tone throughout the series. However, I can imagine that it would be insanely annoying having to wait every week for an episode, only for it to have hardly any progress in the plot."
RedvsBlue,3900jv,Th3MufF1nU8,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:04:20 2015 UTC,"Been following the show weekly since mid season 3, and yes it has been painful waiting for each new episode after every cliff hanger ending. I love this show so damn much"
RedvsBlue,3900jv,VegetaLF7,6,Tue Jun 16 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Well, let's compare it to the one I think is the worst, and see. It's Season 9 by the way.  Season 1 did a lot better in the whole 'give your characters things to do and say.' They're running ops against each other, stealing flags, taking prisoners, rescuing prisoners, etc.  However in 9, it's more of a 'sit around, bemused, and watch Tex do things.' The three blues are given almost nothing to say or do. Once Caboose calls command he fades into the background. Tucker has nothing to do except comment on stuff. Church has essentially been relegated to being an observer in his own story! After the initial confrontation with the Reds, he has nothing to do either. And the Reds themselves, with their very limited interaction with the Blues, are almost entirely superfluous.  Church's character development is rather illusory. Rather than interweaving his realisation throughout the narrative, we have to be told, exposition-style, in his speech at the end. We do not see it reflected in any of actions up until then, mostly because he doesn't have any actions. Show, don't tell.  Part of the problem is the reluctance to commit to any plotline. Alternate personalities? Fixed with little effort early on. Rocket Hog? Completely forgotten about two seconds in. Lopez? Completely forgotten about when he's shot, thus wasting quite a bit of screentime on him. The Red's drill to the core plan? Never even gets going.  This reluctance is reflected in the Freelancer portion. North being shot up to save South? Never mentioned again. No guilt from South, no nothing. Carolina's interest in Tex's arm sparking? Totally abandoned. York's eye? Never comes up, never enters play. York holding any feelings against Maine, who threw the grenade? Nah, they're best buds. No animosity, no resentment whatsoever. Even the conflict that the season does commit to, Carolina's rivalry with Tex, is hard to get interest in, given their cumulative shared screen time probably equals about three or four minutes total. Carolina says, like, seven sentences to her. Her relationship with York is similarly stunted - the most they get is a couple of 'cutesy' moments, like holding hands when they plummet off a building. Only in S10E12 is their relationship handled with gravitas and maturity.  Got sidetracked there - talked mostly about Season 9. So, yeah, Season 1. At least it has a theme, and invests you in its conflict by actually having characters do stuff."
RedvsBlue,3900jv,rersaf,4,Tue Jun 9 01:57:46 2015 UTC,I find season one a little weird because the characters we know and love haven't fully developed yet.   It is a very funny season and did a very good job of introducing the characters and setting up the rest of the show.
RedvsBlue,3900jv,TodtheT1000,3,Mon Jun 8 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"Brilliant writing and comedic moments. I loved every single moment of it. The only negative things are the quality of effects (camera, audio, etc.), but that barely even matters.  Considering we've come so far in the series, I guess there's a downside to it in that there's a lot of conflict concerning canon. The biggest issue I can think of is how Caboose and Church say Sidewinder is an ice planet, when you can actually reach the Freelancer crash site from the desert, meaning that the planet Blood Gulch is on must be Sidewinder itself."

RedvsBlue,3900jv,TodtheT1000,2,Mon Jun 8 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"I thought 10 was really overrated, and quite enjoyed 9. The present day part of s10, aside from the Tex bots scene, was complete filler, and not even funny, sitting around in a canyon filler, just boring filler. And then the big revelation of how they find the Director is that Epsilon just randomly ""remembers"". Seriously? Why didn't he remember before? IDK, I just liked 9 better, it had the dicking around of the Blood Gulch seasons, + the awesomeness of the Freelancer seasons. 12 and 9 are honestly interchangable, 12 could've gone above 9, etc. And if we were going by the importance of what happened in the season, seasons 1-5 would be in last place, in opposite order, with 1 being last, 2 being 2nd to last, etc."

There was plenty of development in the present day scenes, and lots of a legitimate laughs. There's a whole scene where the Reds talk about the Director (the folks that are always criticized for taking a backseat in the plot). Then there's the entire episode with York's logs (which for my money is among the the Top 5 of the series). And then Wash having to choose between Carolina or his new team, which would morph him into the infinitely-protective person he is now.  We even see the start of Tucker's leadership arc, even if it wasn't fully realized yet. (""So much for sticking together."")  Edit: I'll just put my top 5 (greatest to least)-  S12  S6  S8  S10  S5  (I really like strong endings, and especially endings to contained sagas.)"

And it offered some final closure to the Tex stuff, with her really being gone this time.  But all of the Reds stuff, while amusing, was 100% pointless, yeah. So IMO some Epsilon unit stuff was necessary, to show Church working through his issues, but it didn't need to be half the season. And then we could've done more with the Freelancers and built them up a bit more."

RedvsBlue,38ybdc,DatGameGuy,28,Sun Jun 7 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"OH SHIT.  I mean, wow...there's a lot of stuff to cover from this episode.  So there's technology on Chorus to both repopulate the planet and provide boundless resources. There's also ancient weaponry that can wipe out all sentient life (which, as a sidenote, are much like the Halo installations). And now Sharkface is off to activate it, with Felix on his way to join 'em.  One thing that Sharkface mentioned is that, once the Bubble Shield deactivated, Carolina would be left with ""no cover and a failing AI"". Hargrove, too, previously mentioned that Epsilon was ""far too old"" to run newer equipment. The only thing I can take away from this is that Epsilon is rapidly approaching rampancy, and will soon begin to fragment those memories as separate AI. If that happens, all I know is that Doc (assuming he makes a return any time soon) needs to be infected by Epsilon-Omega.  And now the Tartarus has arrived above Crash Site Alpha, pinning down the Reds, Wash, Kimbal, and the Chorus forces with its reinforcements for the Space Pirates. Locus is now (presumably) on the prowl to kill Kimbal; I, however, predict that Wash will manage to protect her, and a fight will ensue.  But of course, Doyle is now faced with a choice: send reinforcements to protect what's left of the people of Chorus, or send reinforcements to potentially stop the activation of the Purge. I'm inclined to think that he might send help to Crash Site Alpha instead of the Jungle Temple, just because people's lives are at stake more immediately.  And then there's the Episode 10 reveal that we've been waiting for. I'm not so sure it will happen, actually; Sharkface has already been shown three times by now, so it can't be him. I don't know if they could manage to squeeze Doc's return in by next episode, though it would be hilarious if he came back in the midst of a firefight at Crash Site Alpha or the Jungle Temple. If the ""reveal/return"" is meant to be the start of Epsilon's fragmentation, then I'd be okay with that, though of course that begs the question: which memory fragment would it be? Delta? Gamma? I'm inclined to think it would be Omega, just because he was the strongest of the original fragments (Beta/Tex doesn't count, as she was more of a shadow than a fragment).  All in all, a great episode. Kinda slow at the beginning, but halfway through, things really started to pick up the pace. I cannot wait until Episode 10."

RedvsBlue,38ybdc,btip29,5,Tue Jun 9 08:04:17 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, that could be right! Especially when Santa said that there's a temple for Interior Decorating."
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,KAnimalia,14,Tue Jun 9 10:50:06 2015 UTC,I feel like if Epsilon does start to fragment that Delta will the first out.  He was the first born from Alpha and he has made the most appearances outside of Omega.  It'd be nice if Delta stuck around with Carolina after all is said and done.  He was York's A.I. and it'd be a good bit of closure for her after losing Epsilon and York.
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,jdofasgard,15,Sun Jun 7 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, I don't think Delta was the first. Just because his birth was the only one shown does not mean he was the first to be fragmented.  Consider Carolina's comment in Season 10: ""They are just fragments, and the newer ones are getting weaker all the time."" This implies that each AI is weaker than the one produced before it, meaning the strongest would be made first. Thus, I think the lineup goes as follows:  Alpha-->Beta-->Omega-->Sigma-->Delta-->Gamma-->Theta-->Eta/Iota-->Epsilon  The Alpha AI is the original one that gets fragmented, and is thus the first AI overall. Beta/Tex doesn't exactly count, as she is more shadow than fragment; still, as the first thing the Alpha sheds off, she deserves a spot on the list. Omega must be the first AI fragment, as he is the strongest of the fragments due to being able to fully possess others like Alpha and Beta. Sigma follows up because he, too, can somewhat ""possess"" others in the form of influencing them into doing his bidding; afterwards, the possession trait is lost. Delta comes next because he is capable of lying; Gamma fully inherits this trait, but does not possess anything else (presumably), thus the logical (no pun intended) conclusion is that he came after Delta. Theta must have come next because Carolina recognized Gamma only about a week or two after Theta was created, so Gamma must have come before. Then, Eta and Iota mix things up; it's likely they came along together instead of one before the other, as Epsilon considers them ""twins"". Then, of course, Epsilon was the last fragment before the Director stopped fragmenting Alpha permanently. Epsilon seems to be the only exception to this ""fragment by strength"" lineup, as he can now possess others like Alpha, Beta, and Omega; I, however, believe that this is due to the growing age of Epsilon and the strength of the memories of the fragments inside of him.  EDIT: It should be noted that there were other failed fragments that were put away into storage (i.e. the voices that welcomed Wash into the Freelancer Command storage room where Epsilon was located). Next to nothing is known about them other than they must have been failures and were in storage when the Reds and Blues arrived at Freelancer Command, thus their place on the list is impossible to pinpoint."
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,-SpaceCommunist-,2,Mon Jun 8 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. The first AI we officially saw, chronologically, was Delta. There is a strong case for Omega being first, given ""The newer ones are getting weaker all the time,"" and Omega having the ability to jump from person to person. Additionally, it follows, that Tex would be given the first AI, and she was given Omega. The problem is that the order after that is a bit fuzzy. Delta would probably be next, given that he's seemingly quite smart, (Was able to figure out that Alpha was an AI) and that he was the first chronologically shown. Next comes either Theta or Sigma. Theta appears in an episode before Sigma, but in the episode after, Carolina says that she gave Sigma to Maine. It would follow, that Carolina had Sigma before this episode. The amount of time before, is not known, so we can't be sure which came first. The next AI we see is Gamma, 7 episodes, later. The next AIs are Eta and Iota. After that, we finally get Epsilon. So the order goes: Alpha Beta Omega Delta Theta/Sigma Gamma Eta/Iota Epsilon"
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,84981725891758912576,3,Mon Jun 8 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"So you're mostly using their appearance by episode as an exact means of saying which fragments came first. It's understandable, but I politely disagree. If I may comment on my own listing (Alpha, Beta, Omega, Sigma, Delta, Gamma, Theta, Eta/Iota, Epsilon), you'll find that a good portion of that list fits up with the leaderboard rankings (Omega/Tex, Sigma/Carolina, Delta/York, Gamma/Wyoming, Theta/North). This, of course, would make sense to give the newest AI fragments to only the best Freelancers. There are of course some changes, in that Carolina refused her AI and gave it to Maine, and when Eta and Iota were created, Maine would be skipped over to South as he now already had Sigma. Carolina again intervenes, and Epsilon is given to Wash.  It's funny, actually; in either list, if Carolina never gave up Sigma and demanded Eta and Iota, Epsilon would have been given to Florida, of all people."
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,-SpaceCommunist-,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"I think that it's definitely possible that Sigma came before Delta, but there are a few problems in the rest of the order. First of all, when Texas originally came, she wasn't first on the leaderboard, but she still got Omega. You have Gamma before Theta, I don't think this is true. In s10e6, when they are all learning AI theory, everyone who has a confirmed AI has theirs out, but Wyoming doesn't have Gamma out. He would obviously bring Gamma out for AI theory, if he had him at the time. Also: after watching s10e13, i'm beginning to question whether Omega was the first AI. The counselor asks Tex about her agression levels, which would imply that she didn't have him until recently. He only appears 2 eps later, though I suspect he was created much before that."
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,84981725891758912576,3,Mon Jun 8 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, when Texas originally came, she wasn't first on the leaderboard, but she still got Omega.   Actually, by the end of Season 9, she was at the top of the leaderboard. Remember, the AI were only being produced after the acquisition of the Sarcophagus, and after that mission Tex was at the top.   You have Gamma before Theta, I don't think this is true. In s10e6, when they are all learning AI theory, everyone who has a confirmed AI has theirs out, but Wyoming doesn't have Gamma out. He would obviously bring Gamma out for AI theory, if he had him at the time.   A good point. However, I don't think there's any particular reason Gamma would need to be ""brought out""; we already know they can take in information from the surrounding environment without displaying themselves visually; perhaps that was the case with Gamma.  Still, if a Gamma came after Theta, then that raises an interesting question: can Theta lie? Delta most likely came before Gamma, and he can lie. It's possible, too, that Omega and Sigma can lie; they are both known to be very deceptive. So if Theta came before Gamma, that should mean he inherited that trait.   Also: after watching s10e13, i'm beginning to question whether Omega was the first AI. The counselor asks Tex about her agression levels, which would imply that she didn't have him until recently. He only appears 2 eps later, though I suspect he was created much before that.   Actually, when she and Carolina are preparing to confront Connie and the Insurrectionist Leader, Tex is pretty damn angry: ""Carolina, I know what the fucking objective is!"" She's the first to shoot, and she downright mauls Connie to death. Once the Leader and Connie escape, she's absolutely furious, even more than she should be—hence, Carolina's comment that she doesn't know what's gotten into Tex.  All of this points to Omega's presence by the tenth episode of Season 10."
RedvsBlue,38ybdc,-SpaceCommunist-,4,Mon Jun 8 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think we've never seen theta lie because he is based on trust. Therefore, he may not even be able to lie. We have seen his power though, when running bubble shield.  On the Omega thing, s10e10 is the first time we see her aggression, so she probably didn't get it too far before that. Omega being able to jump bodies is, IMO, just random, or perhaps he learned it after being inside Tex for a while?"

He switches to the Charon Industries Binary Rifle, aims it at Carolina's face, and just when the Pelican comes back into view- he fires.  Carolina is naught more than orange dust in the wind.

RedvsBlue,38ybdc,alynnidalar,8,Thu Jun 11 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"Holy shit! Sharkface coming behind them... Noticed either a plot-hole, or a clue. Sharkface was  with the Counselor in ep7, when Locus/Felix were at the alien structure, how'd they know to come back? And also, how'd they know that they would be at Alpha at that exact moment? Sharkface said not like they were just constantly prepared at Alpha, but that they had specifically prepared for this assault. Reinforces my idea that there is a mole in the armies. I really think the only options by now are the lieutenants, but they're all too seemingly idiotic to do anything. ""Interior decorating!"" Doc confirmed. ""Procreation"" maybe Sister, probably not though. ""The Purge"" sounds like a too good to be true for the Mercs; Isn't it a big alien thing though, that the chosen one always gets the key? So even if Charon makes it there first they still won't be able to get it due to alien prophecy. Additionally, it's weird that it has the same name as the thing from the ship. Maybe it will end up the same way? With most of the people dying, but with a few, crafty, important people surviving? That would also mean that Locus/Felix would have to go to Charon's ship, which would give the Chairman an easy avenue to ""tie up loose ends."" ""Failing AI""  I think this reinforces the fact that something is wrong with Epsilon. Maybe all the personalities inside his head are too much to handle, they'll seperate from him?"

(a traitor seems unlikely because there's literally nobody who could be a traitor--we really don't know anybody in either army other than the lieutenants (unlikely, plus they haven't had as much focus this season), Kimball (obviously not), and Doyle (very probably not, unless he's the best actor ever)."

There's no reason Wyoming would have shot at Wash, one of the only other Freelancers still loyal to the Director. Hence, it may have been York. Plus, ""Wyoming"" was duel wielding weapons, something Wyoming has never been known to do but something York often did (at least in the PF seasons).  It's a stretch, but hey, it ain't my theory."

If so, why not in the tenth episode? We could have those Freelancers all making ""returns"" then, even if it is only for that episode."

It's mentioned but he's such a good character he defiantly deserves his own identity.  The reason PFL is involved is because it has left such a large mark on our heroes and the galaxy. The war on Chorus will defiantly shine on its own, the use of Hargrove makes it even more exciting for the long time RvB fan (Something Miles likes to do). Wrapping that around Charon continues the tradition of making everything interconnected which then shows how important the Blood Gulch Crew are.  I would recommend looking back at times PFL is mentioned even as far back as Blood Gulch.  As for Sharkface I think we will soon think of him as a Chrous character rather than a Freelancer-era one. Especially with his new design.  I do hope the next few seasons does lack some freelancer stuff though so I agree with you on that :)"

RedvsBlue,38rob6,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:41:01 2015 UTC,alot of explaining for this but basically agant maine is clearly a very good moral person taking bullets for people and such the sigma AI was crazy and power hungry and also living in maines head so basically it corrupted him theres alot more to it than thats the jist of it
RedvsBlue,38rob6,slocke200,0,Wed Jun 10 01:55:13 2015 UTC,so he took a bullet for someone and that makes him the most sympathetic villain ever  Sigma may ahve convinced him to go after power but he clearly wanted it himself or he would have stopped after Sigma left  the idea that Maine is this super good guy with a heart of gold who was just broken by sigma is ridiculous  considering the guy has basically 0 actual character invalidates him as sympathetic at all hes just a soldier
RedvsBlue,38rob6,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:05:01 2015 UTC,"how do you know he has 0 character you havnt heard him. and you dont realise the damage that sigma can do i have explained this way more in depth in other posts. Sigma is the AI for ambition he wants to be powerful we can see that powerful AI can take hosts hower sigma himself isnt powerful enough to do that however he can corrupt the very mind of the user someone litrally living in your head for years making you think the way they want to think, also on top of that giving them headaches when they think in a way you dont want them to think... its called conditioning. however i do agree we get to see very little glimpse's of maine before hand however the fact that all the good characters believe the director is responsible for maine going insane and are clearly mad about it, it would make you think he was a good character, also you see maine even try to resist the conditioning he goes to the med bay but the director lets it continue for experiment sake, i could also use your same poiunt against you, you have no evidence that maine before the meta was evil"

All of the technology that PFL had was insane. People will fight over it. Eventually, they will expose the Chairman for who he is, and that will leave a huge  mark as well. I do like Locus and Felix better than most Freelancers, but Wash is definitely my favorite character in the series. The Meta can almost be seen as a seperate entity from Freelancer. The Meta wasn't Maine, it was Sigma attempting to corrupt Maine.    On the Church and Tex relationship, I think the first 9 seasons were just completely based on that.

RedvsBlue,38lhyc,TaylorCulosis,6,Sat Jun 6 18:01:27 2015 UTC,We touched on it in the episode 8 megathread. You make a good point. I don't think it was suicide. More like not being able to handle something and passing out. That's how everyone else seemed to end. The point was is they probably told her something about how she wasn't good enough. How she failed as team leader. Etc. Tl;dr she wasn't good enough.

RedvsBlue,38lhyc,hadezv2,6,Fri Jun 5 00:45:59 2015 UTC,No... we don't know exactly how north died.  CT was stabbed by texas. Maine was pushed off a cliff. Florida died of an aspirin overdose. south was killed by washington. Wyoming was killed by the reds and blues during bgc. York was killed on a mission with Texas by wyoming.  Honestly... we never really hear her say she wasn't killed. Only that there wasn't any fighting.
RedvsBlue,38lhyc,Dan_Of_Time,3,Fri Jun 5 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"everyone being shot was meant to be everyone who went in the portal for example felix and locus. and her saying there wasnt any fighting kinda supports my theory because all others was them being shot but carolina it wasnt a shootout, it wasnt even self doubt it was regret that was her weakness i just think it driving her to suicide made it even cooler"
RedvsBlue,38lhyc,DarkRubberDucky,4,Fri Jun 5 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"I think they just leave the portal when they aren't worthy enough or get mentally defeated. They never really specified you had to ""die"" in the portal to leave.   I think Tucker was sent out as soon as he was overwhelmed and knew he couldn't win, Locus went out as soon as he saw what made him the person he is today and I believe Carolina went out after she absorbed the guilt of what happened to her team.  Also suicide is quite a dark thing for them to suggest, hence why they have only done it once and it had a pretty large effect."
RedvsBlue,38lhyc,Toasiddy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:44:46 2015 UTC,"They have been making some comments that make me think she has Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The bad dreams (said by Theta in season 12), her obvious guilt about giving up the Sigma A.I. and leading to Maine becoming the Meta, her guilt over basically the whole Freelancer group (as shown in the portal), super aggressive during her mission to kill the director. So, she does have a serious issue with her past.  But despite all that, she does not show suicidal tendencies. In fact, though she does put herself into the front line-type battles, she talked about ""becoming better"" so she's thinking about the future, not killing herself. She's fair too strong a character for that. She just lost her self-assurance when Tex showed up and after the Director's death/suicide, she lost even more of herself, believing she didn't have much of a purpose. She's just trying to find her reason to go on."
RedvsBlue,38lhyc,DarkRubberDucky,3,Mon Jun 8 03:04:47 2015 UTC,It could be safe to assume North was blown up. Since the Meta killed him.

RedvsBlue,38i8to,LegendaryBroNr7,3,Thu Jun 4 11:45:58 2015 UTC,"The DVD and the Blu-ray collections are mostly identical. The Blu-ray collection has an extra disc, though. I haven't noticed any voice cutouts as you say but the ""missing episodes"" I always hear tell about are just the trailers that had story relevance in them, and you're really not missing too much, honestly. I also believe the trailers actually are on one of the discs, it's just not conveniently located where it should be so people say it's not there.  Now, honestly, what you ARE missing by getting the collection is the character and life that was in the original DVDs. Buying the originals one by one, those DVDs had life in their menus, easter eggs, interactivity, and they were just fun. The collection menus are streamlined clean cut hollow shells of their previous forms and I really feel like you're missing out if you don't have them.  I own both the Blu-ray collection and the standalone DVDs, the individual DVDs are better than the collection, but the collection is a leaner meaner cleaner presentation and superior quality if all you're really interested in is the show itself in its best possible quality."

RedvsBlue,38bta2,KristophGavin,2,Wed Jun 3 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"My ideas:  I think the memories of the A.I. fragments within Epsilon are more than they appear. I mean, we treat Epsilon as Church, not some A.I. using Church's memories to pretend to be Church, and the memory Tex was able to separate herself from Epsilon and act independently, until Epsilon gave her peace or whatever happened at the end of Season 9.  I think it's possible Church's ""death"" mentioned in the trailer may be the death of the Epsilon unit specifically, due to the memories of the A.I. essentially pulling it apart as they separate themselves into distinct entities again. Which means, yay, we get Delta and Theta again.. but also Sigma and Omega.. who are quick to turn on the Reds and Blues and join up with Charon.  The Chairman is trying to get an A.I. through legitimate means, but we don't really know if he'll be successful, due to all the new restrictions in place after Project Freelancer.(He's confident he'll get one, but he's not the most humble of people I feel.) He said that Epsilon was too old to operate the suit, but I think a metastable A.I. should trump any newer A.I., so Charon will help Sigma and Omega become metastable, after which the new metastable A.I. will run the suit, creating a new Meta. Since the Chairman is all for the Meta, the new Meta won't feel the need to go rouge against him. He'll have all the armor powers and the A.I., what else is he going to do with his life?  Until they capture the other A.I., Sigma and Omega will feel it's more effective to have two separate A.I. operating with two soldiers, and will be paired up with Felix and Locus."
RedvsBlue,38bta2,MJRpancakes,2,Thu Jun 4 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"i had a very similar idea that i don't believe i ever posted about. Locus and Felix are sent a Mercenary with the prototype of Agent Maine's upgraded armor that will serve as support because of their incompetence. the prototype is a piece for piece copy of Maine's original suit, but with minor upgrades.  When i say ""piece for piece"" i'm including the components in the helmet. as time goes on, the Mercenary acts stranger and stranger until he finally behaves similarly to The Meta, but easier to control."

Epsilon could lose control we see it in season 10 that all of the AI are a part of him and you see before that that they memories have there own personalities like delta appearing to caboose suppose somehow epsilon was split or suppose one of these part gained control sigma perhaps, the most interesting thing about that is the dynamic between sigma and carolina as sigma was suited for her"

RedvsBlue,37z26k,_masterofdisaster,4,Mon Jun 1 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"RvB has far too many contradictions to be part of Halo lore. The very first mention of Master Chief is a contradiction (Master Chief didn't ""blow up the whole Covenant armada""). The Elites, which RvB uses as their standard alien, didn't have an ancient empire that left relics/weapons behind. And the alien structures they're using right now are explicitly Forerunner in Halo lore, not Elite. Then there are the weapons Charon created, which are supposedly a melding of human and alien technology. In Halo, those are Forerunner weapons. They are considerably older than the Covenant ones (which are the stand-in ancient weapons in RvB), and the Covenant weapons are actually a partially successful attempt to reverse engineer those Forerunner weapons. So completely opposite of what RvB has established. There are huge differences in technology throughout both series as well, so while it's a fun idea, I cannot fathom a way in which RvB can fit in the Halo universe."
RedvsBlue,37z26k,ElRay0707,3,Tue Jun 2 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"The very first mention of Master Chief is a contradiction (Master Chief didn't ""blow up the whole Covenant armada"").

And the alien structures they're using right now are explicitly Forerunner in Halo lore, not Elite.   But they made the distinction between Elites and Forerunners in S7 and S8.

RedvsBlue,37z26k,UltimaNylocke,5,Sun May 31 22:55:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with this one. Firstly, in s10e22 the Director sends Alpha straight to Blood Gulch, no stop at Sidewinder, but Church has a memory of sidewinder. A memory of Tex, at a snowy base, beating the shit out of everyone he knew, then leaving him alive."
RedvsBlue,37z26k,ChickadeeAce,2,Tue Jun 2 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm,  dunno about that.  In the Out Of Mind miniseries we see Tex's memory of them Church getting ready to leave with Jimmy after telling her to be careful, and after he is harassed by Wyoming.   Maybe the discrepancy is just a brain fart on the part of the writers and we should cough politely and pretend not to notice?"

Another interesting tidbit."
RedvsBlue,37z26k,azntrojan,3,Tue Jun 2 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"Well I read this on a youtube comment but I think this theory might be very plausible:  ""I have a theory that would explain a lot about Caboose and why, unlike the rest of the Reds and Blues, very little is known about his backstory.  He's actually a failed early version of a SPARTAN super-soldier that was sent to Blood Gulch for the same reason Alpha Church was sent there; to keep him safe from those who would exploit his abilities. He was probably one of the U.N.S.C.'s first attempts to create a surgically enhanced super-soldier, but the procedures responsible for creating SPARTAN IIs, like John-117, hadn't been perfected yet. As a result, the procedures that granted him superhuman strength and endurance also caused catastrophic brain damage that impeded his higher brain functions, rendering him uncontrollable and severely decreasing his intelligence. The damage caused by the procedure very likely traumatized him and caused him to repress many of his memories, but also had the side effect of creating mental inhibitors that keep him from using his full strength under normal circumstances. His seemingly idiotic behavior is actually a defense mechanism designed to keep those mental inhibitors in place and his repressed memories from returning. This same behavior also rendered him practically useless, so the U.N.S.C. sent him to Blood Gulch in order to keep him away from the Human-Covenant War, where he could potentially fall into the wrong hands or end up killing the people that created him.  Despite his extensive brain damage, Caboose is still clearly capable of making some rational decisions on his own, even if he himself doesn't realize it. For example, when Agent Washington and the rest of the Reds and Blue were planning their attack on Freelancer command, it was Caboose who recommended using a Freelancer tank to get into the facility without being captured. And on the occasions where Church entered Caboose's mind, there was clearly some structure and order to his thoughts, even if they were distorted. This is evidenced by the fact that Caboose views himself as a normal human being when he is in the safety of his own mind, and by Delta being able to survive within Caboose's mind without being distorted himself. In fact, Caboose may once have been highly intelligent, since he was able to transfer Epsilon into a Forerunner monitor unit without any outside help.  Due to his enhancements, Caboose is much stronger than a normal human, but his mental inhibitors usually prevent him from using his full strength. But when he is under the control of an AI, or if he somehow gets angry, those inhibitors will stop working, causing him to go on a rampage. It's also possible Caboose is actually significantly stronger than other SPARTAN super-soldiers, since he was made before the same procedures that created John-117 had been refined and improved. This is mainly evidenced by how he was able to plow through several dozen copies of Tex with seemingly minimal effort, while Agent Washington and The Meta were barely able to defeat a single Tex robot. This makes Caboose as strong, if not stronger, than The Meta at full power, and probably makes him one of the most powerful soldiers in the entire galaxy, at least when his inhibitors are removed.  Since (spoiler) The Meta's helmet was recovered by Locus at some point, there is a good chance that he managed to survive falling off a cliff after his battle with the Reds and Blues in season 8. Hopefully this means he will return at some point in season 13. If he does, I really want to see him fight an angry Caboose. That would be fucking spectacular, don't you agree?""

RedvsBlue,37z26k,CarterAC3,3,Tue Jun 2 14:03:41 2015 UTC,"Nah I think this one doesn't work because Caboose was essentially normal at the beginning of the show (as normal as it gets in that Gulch) and he only started being as dimwitted after O'Malley, Tex, and Church all went into his head and we know what happens when 3 AI go into a head"
RedvsBlue,37z26k,KravenKaos,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:18:18 2015 UTC,"After seeing him being the only one that was a 'true warrior', it got me thinking, what if the J in Michael J.

Imagine the effect Cortana had on the Chief. This is assuming RvB occurs years after his events in Halo lore."

RedvsBlue,37z26k,DarkRubberDucky,2,Mon Jun 1 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"I have made up a few theories, and my biggest theory (despite Burnie admitting he wishes they hadn't killed him off) is that York is alive.  Mostly, I base this on nearly no one in this series dies unless its directly on-screen (C.T., the Leader, South). I'll admit to North, but mainly because of South's reaction. Meanwhile, many ""die"" and yet are back again later (Donut, Flowers, Church - a few times-, Tex, Demo Man - the robot arm guy, who is STILL alive in a deleted scene-) With this, I maintain the Meta is alive too. That cliff looks to have water at the bottom. A spacesuit for super soldiers and he can't survive a fall into water? He lives through a half dozen bullets in the throat!  Anyway, York 'died' with Tex close by. And the first words she ever says to him (in the timeline) is ""Never abandon your team"". Delta fades, as York's armor fails, doesn't 100% mean he's dead. Yes, Wash arrives and blows the armor, but I remain strong that Tex would find a way to save him, even on the run from Wyoming.  I know I'm likely wrong, but I hold out hope that something saved York. Maybe he lived the same way Donut did. The armor kept the blood in..."

Miles stated on the commentary that he didn't realize how suspicious she seemed until after the film version was complete.

I think she's currently on the straight and narrow, but I don't discount her ability to decide to change sides in some way. But she was seriously too pissed off about what happened to her friends before she tortures that one guy (while she sings opera - its late I don't remember).   She's cool.

RedvsBlue,37gnsw,Forikorder,2,Wed May 27 18:55:59 2015 UTC,Given what we've seen of Alien tech and how Hargrove employs it in his new weapons Santa could at least provide the basis for what he needs for a more advanced AI. I mean... just look at what Fragmenting the Alpha gave us.

RedvsBlue,37gnsw,Forikorder,1 point,Thu May 28 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"How are Locus and Felix signing their own death warrants? They're under orders to capture Epsilon should the opportunity arise,  Hargrove has the Meta Armor, it's upgrades, F.I.L.I.S.S. and possibly other freelancer tech that was confiscated. Not to mention the Sarcophagus used to create the fragmented AI was his before Project Freelancer stole it. And considering Freelancer used AI Fragments to run their armor, and the fact that Hargrove wants to Mass Produce the Neo-Meta suit after he gets it up and running (you know, for money), they'll need more than a single AI."
RedvsBlue,37gnsw,KaiserGrey,1 point,Thu May 28 14:57:47 2015 UTC,Hargrove said that if he gets an AI before they TPK chorus hes putting someone in the suit and sending him to TPK them he already said the Epsilon unit was too weak to run it he may have had the sarcophogas but we dont know if he knew what it did we dont even know if Santa is a legit smart AI psycological torture could be completely innefective
RedvsBlue,37gnsw,Forikorder,1 point,Thu May 28 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"I kind of think recovering rare alien tech would make up for not getting the TPK. Yes, yes it is. Which is why a shiny new full AI could make for an interesting choice, especially since Alien lifeforms have been shown to have more advanced tech than humans. Chances are Freelancer kept records of how they made their Fragments, and at worst the Councilor could explain the process. Santa's smart enough to be shocked by Caboose's strength and savvy enough to ask for someone smarter to talk to after dealing with him. No reason why he shouldn't be fragmentable with enough trail and error."

RedvsBlue,37gnsw,Forikorder,1 point,Thu May 28 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"Their current primary mission is erradicating all life on Chorus, recover PFL and Alien tech is just extra credit. Santa is ""smart"" enough to devise a test capable of drawing out a person's deepest darkest fears. The Councilor was always by Director Church's side.  He was there when Delta was born; it is more than likely he was there when Theta, Sigma, Gamma, Eta and Iota, and Epsilon were born too.  He was the only person Director Church trusted enough to allow to see the fragmentation process.  The Councilor also knew the PFL Agents better than Director Church did. He activated all Chorus based alien and hybrid technology once Tucker triggered the lock with his sword.  He also learned the English language after only a handfull of people were sent into his test.  Also considering that much of Human advanced technology was likely reverse engineered(like the weapons) from alien tech, it is also safe to assume that A.I. technology was reverse engineered from alien A.I. tech."

We see Carolina towering above him, probably at least 6 foot 5, in armor. She is the shortest of the freelancers. We can also see from several CGI scenes that Wash is a decent bit taller, maybe 6 foot 8, in armor. In a picture of all the freelancers together, Maine, while slightly slouched, absolutely towers above wash, definitely over seven and a half feet tall. Putting that into perspective with the difference in height between Chief and normal humans, it's pretty safe to say Maine is taller. He probably is a good bit shorter out of armor, and 8 feet is possibly a bit of a stretch, but it's not a terrible estimate. And he had to duck when stepping out of a drop pod, which is pretty damn huge :)"

It would probably be:  Sarge- (Considering how depressed he got after finding out about the simulation troops) Being completely worthless or unable to affect a situation.  Simmons- Finding out he isn't actually  smart like he thinks, and being far from it.  Grif- I would actually say having all of his friends die, since he tries to always play it like he doesn't care about anyone's fate.   Donut- I actually can't think of anything from what we know about Donut.  Doc is spot on though. I can definitely see Omega being a huge fear for him, since it threatened his pacifist nature."

Especially now that they know they were just pawns in that battle, being herded like sheep, it could be nightmarish. They've were cannon fodder under PF, but now they were thrown into a real war. We know Sarge takes his whole military career seriously, so being a pawn and killing people who aren't the real enemy would hit him hard. Sarge was leading, the others were trying for something real, but it was all them being played again. I know I would be afraid of that happening again."

Grif- Sarge and Simmons die, Grif is put in charge of red team and has to do loads of work.  Simmons- Basically Grif's dream, but with girls everywhere and Grif dieing instead of him.  Epsilon-the torture Alpha was put through at the hands of the director, Gamma and Omega.  Washington- his team dieing and him having to do the atrocities he did with Meta all over again and again and again.  Tex- failure, Tez fails at everything.  North-losing his squad, especially South.  South- IDK, she was never a very 3d Character.  Maine-Losing his squad (he took that sniper round to the chest for Coralina so we know he cared, before he became the Meta...)  Florida- Everyone is depressed, no more positive thinking.  C.T.- her boyfriend dieing, then she has to work for project freelancer.  Vanessa Kimball- her people all killed and the death of The New Republic.

Grif-Likely some of the more...traumatic things that happened to him in Blood Gulch  Epsilon (if he could see anything)-Fragmentation of the Alpha. No doubt.  Tex (if she could see anything and was alive)-Every time she failed.  Director- Allison  Lopez- His time under Sarge's command, particularly at Blood Gulch  Donut- The circumstances that forced him into the Army (he clearly isn't a military person. Neither is Grif, but Donut at least seems the type to be very hostile toward the military life)  Wash- Epsilon trying to kill itself  York- His fight with Carolina during the break in  Can't...think of any more main characters as of right now."
RedvsBlue,37akv2,emPtysp4ce,2,Tue May 26 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell from when Caboose enters the portal, Santa looks for any fear, doubt, negativity, strength and maybe any holes in self-identity, because he asks ""Who are you?"" to everyone who enters the portal. Here's my take. I'm including some past and AI characters, because it seems like fun.   Sarge - As Toasiddy said, for being worthless and insignificant in any situation.   Simmons - A large variety of his own memories. People who are self-conscious tend to remind themselves of small and insignificant negative memories.   Grif - Seeing the consequences of his laziness.  Donut - Nothing that would affect him emotionally, besides being called pink. But he might not be able to pass the strength test.   Lopez - Being a head again while not being able to communicate with others. Probably be abused by the Red Team.   Doc - Pretty much Omega. And maybe the various patients he failed to save.   Alpha-Church - Being tortured by Director, seeing the various fragments of himself.   Beta-Tex - Being a ""shadow"". (See S10E10: ""C.T.""). And as LibertyPrime said, being fated to fail.   Wash - Being the worst of an elite team of fighters. And his mental breakdown when he was given Epsilon  Epsilon-Church - His own identity. He would see all of the epislon doubles of the AI fragments and Santa will constantly ask him ""Who are you?"" Epsilon was never given his own personality. He just copied Alpha's persona, but less of an asshole.   Felix - We weren't told about this one. But from what I can tell from past-Felix, something has happened to become more charismatic. Whatever ""shit straight out of his nightmares"", it has to be one of the worst battles that Kimball mentioned to Tucker. After all, he can't get back to civ life. I'm hoping that Miles will tell us about the battle."

Epsilon said he only got static when he and Carolina entered the teleporter. At first thought, that might be because he's an AI, and his programming wouldn't register with the Alien tech. However, now that I think about it, I think he couldn't be tested because he deleted Tex from his memory. ""Santa"" tried testing him, but could not find the proper memory--aka Tex--due to her deletion, and thus Epsilon was presented with static instead."

Hargrove will then get Santa to run the suit...though the compatibility between the two might be a little questionable. But then again, Charon developed hybrid weaponry.

Perhaps it means the reds and blues as a whole, or maybe just the blues. Tucker with the sword, Caboose with the strength and stupidity to fulfil the criteria. Carolina the decent fighter and Church the intelligence.  Perhaps they're prophesied to, together, be a ""great destroyer,"" hence why the seemingly incompetent soldiers are able to successful fight overwhelmingly odds like against the Director and now Charon.  Perhaps that's why the blues always get the plot heavy stuff, ""blue stuff"" like Grif called it.  Of course, we don't know how much of the prophecy Gamma modified or simply made up."

With everybody talking about Caboose and ""The Great Destroyer"", I really wanna talk about Carolina and her vision(? idk). She sees Tex, which is basically the reason behind all of Carolina's jealousy, which lead to Season 10 Episode 13, Greenish-Blue With Envy. Carolina sees all the Freelancers. Carolina has been (indirectly) responsible for many things that happened to the Freelancers, a good chunk of which because of a single episode where she took Eta and Iota.  Washington: Because his AI implantation got delayed, he ended up with Epsilon, leading to his insanity. Things eventually worked out in the end kinda, so maybe that's why he wasn't in the vision.  North / South: Carolina stopped South from getting an AI, which ultimately lead to South's jealousy and betrayal of North, leading to North's death.  Maine: Carolina was originally supposed to have the Sigma AI, but gave it to Maine. While this was in no way Carolina's fault, she probably still feels bad. ""Poor Maine"" -Season 10, Episode 6.  Wyoming: I am unsure about this one, if anybody has any ideas feel free to tell me and I can edit.  C.T.: Carolina literally saw her fatal blow. To be fair, it was at the hands of Tex, but still...  Florida: I'm pretty sure Carolina didn't wrong this guy in any way... but it was very nice to see him.  York: Where to start? Carolina's jealousy of Tex led to her leaving(?) York. Season 10 Episode 12 has Carolina go to where York died, and well, we all know what happened there and we can probably guess how she feels. I could go on... but this entire post is big enough already.  I really hope future episodes in this season expand on what Carolina saw in her vision."
RedvsBlue,3753uj,Crocodilefan,14,Tue May 26 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"The answer is simple. Carolina failed. season 10 "" I had a team. A team with the best training. The best equipment. and they still lied, and stole, and tore each other to peices."" Ultimately she feels responsible for the teeam failing. They were here responsibility. She failed to beat tex. which is why she still sees tex as the better soldier. she failed to protect her team. She failed to keep them together. She sees that as her responsibility. Calling it now, that when her old team Apeared They berated her for not being good enough. Not good enough to keep them together. Not good enough To keep then from fighting.

RedvsBlue,3753uj,OptionK,5,Wed May 27 18:03:06 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed this episode. It was a highlight if the season so far for me.  The bit between Wash and the Reds was good. The show often uses music for comedic effect and in this scene, it was the absence of music that had the comedic effect. If a certain style of music had been playing while Wash was talking, he would have actually sounded thoughtful and emotional. Without it, his words sounded out of place and Grif's realization of the speech's purpose was hilarious.  I do wish they had kinda reminded us exactly where they're going. It's been a couple episodes since they left, and it took me a minute to remember what mission they're on. I did eventually, but it would have been nice to have had their destination mentioned at some point.  Anyway, then, everything that happened at the gateway was dope. Grey's line about Tucker being right and the sword negating the need to be strong or smart was perfect. Seeing Tex and then York...I fucking lost it. That was totally unexpected. While in some sense I would have loved to see everything that happened there, I don't mind that we didn't. There's probably nothing they could have done that would have lived up to what we all would have wanted that scene to be, so it's probably best that they didn't show more than they did. I mean maybe they could have shown us a few more seconds or something, but I'm ok with it.  Of course Caboose was the true warrior. Kinda saw that coming. I also think that his scene through the gateway could have been better. It was an important moment, and I just don't think the dialogue landed as well was it should have. But, the stuff after Caboose comes back was on point. They introduced an interesting new concept/character. gave me multiple laughs, and left me anxiously awaiting the next episode.  A few thoughts/questions:  Why did Tucker seem to just bounce of the energy thing? Everyone else we've seen go through disappears for at least some period of time. Tucker didn't, even though he seems to still have experienced something on the other side. Is this meaningful?  Seems like they could possibly do a mini-series showing all of what everyone saw on the other side of the gateway. I don't feel like those stories matter to the overall development of the season, but they could be pretty interesting to see and a miniseries would be a way to show them without having to meander away from the ongoing story.  I initially thought the gateway seemed somewhat contrived. Just a magic energy thing that shows you your nightmares? It felt forced in there. But now, knowing that Santa (lol, btw), an alien AI was in there, I'm more ok with it. It wasn't magic, it was an AI. Presumably (though correct me if you think I'm mistaken), Santa was able to connect with people that entered, get some of their memories, and show them something based on it. This makes it not random magic like I had thought at first, and thus not contrived. It wasn't forced, it was introduced to bring in a new character/concept. So I'm good with that.  So yeah, those are my thoughts overall."
RedvsBlue,3753uj,hadezv2,1 point,Tue May 26 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, and what's up with Santa (lol again) saying he had increased the gravity tenfold since Caboose arrived? I thought they weren't actually anywhere, but that Santa (apparently I lol every time I use his name) was just connecting to them and showing them images from the past. Felix described it as an illusion, right? That was how I had taken it. But then Santa (dammit, lol) says that he increased the gravity tenfold, implying that they're in an actually physical location. Maybe the gateway takes them to a real physical place where the alien AI construct (just so I don't have to use his name again) can connect to them and show them stuff? I guess it doesn't make that big of a difference either way, it just caught my attention as implying something incongruous with how I had interpreted things before."
RedvsBlue,3753uj,OptionK,5,Tue May 26 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"It has to take them away somewhere, we knew that. Not that big a stretch to transport somewhere the AI has complete control... maybe a holographic room of some kind... cough relocated miniseries cough cough"
RedvsBlue,3753uj,hadezv2,2,Tue May 26 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. For some reason I thought it was all in their heads. But it is more likely that they're in a real place and just being shown illusions."

I mean he does have all the memories of what PFL did, so wouldn't he have seen at least something? Or is it because he isn't flesh and blood?  Anyone have any thoughts on what Carolina saw? I think that the memories of the other Freelancers confronted her on what she did about the Director, her relationship with him, the anger she had (her line in Season 10 about how she could not even trust the people she worked with), her guilt over the death of York/her unresolved feelings about York, and any issues she had with Tex.  Also I wasn't able to tell if Tex's normal voice actress was doing the voice this time. Sort of sounded like her, but the end didn't."

The whole test thing appears to show someone's regrets or fears, so I'm guessing they attacked her poor leadership and teamwork for indirectly getting them all killed. She was never able to get the team together since she was always more concerned with her and self-improvement.

RedvsBlue,36rmvu,alynnidalar,5,Thu May 21 20:46:45 2015 UTC,"Well, not sure I'd call it obvious.  In the very first season Church and Tucker argue over why his body hasn't been buried yet and Tucker comments on how Church's body stinks.  It's already started to putrify.  There has to be some sort of organic material involved - it's even got buzzard-like birds starting to circle overhead.  Also, we know that characters have seen each other out of armour before, so it would seem a bit odd if Church was never seen out of his by his squadmates (namely Tucker.)  So far I haven't heard an explanation for that and I've rather cheerfully put it down to the writers not yet having decided that Church is an AI and didn't let it get in my way of enjoying BGC.  I need to find some background info about when they decided on major plot points, just to help put some of the continuity issues into focus a bit more.  edited to add:  Church also met Sarge in an afterlife/limbo kind of landscape after Caboose shot him in the head.  Unless Sarge is also an AI, I'm not sure how that can be explained away.  (Of course, Sheila is there too, so... *shrugs)"

One thing I did notice was during the Meta/Sarge showdown. When Grif and Simmons push the Warthog off the cliff, Sarge reaches around the Meta and grabs the storage unit with a quiet ""Yoink"". I originally thought it just fell off when he hit the ground.  I think this is kinda important as it shows how Sarge has changed throughout the Recollection. At the end of S5 he was fine with killing Tex and Junior by stopping the ship, now he's saving Tex.  EDIT: Another thing I remembered is during an early episode of S12 you can see Caboose walk up to a tank and look at it in the background. Small things add so much detail some times."

RedvsBlue,36j93s,OptionK,23,Tue May 19 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's an event from Felix and Locus' past.  It looks like Locus (the present, a-moral one) has been put in the place of some ""monster"" he and Felix came across however long ago. Maybe an Elite they come across, and this whole event takes place during the war with the covenant? Their CO orders Locus (the past, hesitant one) and Felix to take the monster somewhere and kill it quietly.  The tower apparently makes you relive the things you regret most, and past-Locus was pretty clear that he did not want to kill the alien. I think the point was to make Locus revisit a murder he particularly regretted, probably his first one ever. Only this time he experiences it from the perspective of his victim."
RedvsBlue,36j93s,Probably_A_Raptor,17,Tue May 19 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"There is also the origins of his name there. He prefers to go by the name of his armor right?

He follows orders to a tee another point of his captain. I also find it interesting that the marines say they found themselves a monster. To my knowledge, Wash was the only one to call him that, and as we all know he has a huge thing for Wash.  I may be ahead of myself, but this may have opened a door for a Locus redemption arc, or at least him becoming less of a psychopathic killer. This really shook him up, he got clearly flustered and rattled for the first time so far."

Felix and Locus never got along. They fought over everything but, considering what they were up against, they banded together...and they survived. But, surviving isn't always enough.  Scene flash forwards to the aftermath of the Great War, where several UNSC soldiers, including Felix and Locus, are seen in a room. The soldiers gradually fade away until only Locus and Felix are left.  Kimball: (voice over) When the war was over many soldiers had a difficult time returning to civilian life. And some of them weren't able to return at all.   We know now that Locus wasn't always a stone-cold killer. Starting from when he was made to murder a Sangheili (assumption based on conversation from Locus of Control), and going further towards when his squad was wiped out aside from Felix, his mind wasn't able to cope with the stresses of war and he broke. The man currently known as Locus wasn't able to return from the war, and instead adopted the Locus persona in order to survive. But surviving isn't always enough."

RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Forikorder,7,Tue May 19 15:20:08 2015 UTC,"Wild theory?  Well, been thinking about Church's claim that he dies this season.  We know that the Counselor has info regarding the weaknesses of both Carolina and Wash, which really makes both of them vulnerable and I have to believe that one of them is going to die this season, to give that a proper whallop.  If Carolina dies, Church would appear to go with her.  But we still have Agent Washington, who is not only Recovery One, but also Epsilon's original host.  Yeah, we've heard that he never thought that he'd be able to host an AI (fragment, whatever) again, but he never thought he'd work with another agent again, and he's worked side by side with both the Meta and Carolina now.  And even if he still felt that he couldn't do it, I don't believe that he could face the BGC, specifically that he couldn't face Caboose, and refuse to save Church/Epsilon and take him on.  Plus, this would hide his continued existence from anyone outside the BGC that might know of Church and see a use for him, which would account for the message in the prologue.  And it would give a lovely completed circle for Wash and Epsilon, and a nice kicking off point for a next season - there would be a lot of mileage in Wash learning how to cope with an AI again.  Just because he might agree to do it, it doesn't mean it wouldn't be traumatizing."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,ChickadeeAce,2,Tue May 19 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"he only refused an AI because he was worried it would learn about his plans to take down PFL and rat him out, he doesnt actually ahve any problem with letting an AI in his head now that PFL is dead  also the chairman called epsilon to old to even use his suit and was getting a better AI so why would anyone want epsilon?"
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Forikorder,2,Tue May 19 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, didn't Wash take Alpha on board for a very short period of time at the end of Season 6?  Alpha made a comment about how he understood why Wash didn't want anyone in there - he had some really dark stuff in his head.  That said, Wash was walking into a situation that he didn't believe he would survive and that's a bit of a game changer.  I can't think of any instance after that when Wash has made any statement to the effect that he would be willing to take on another AI - can you think of one?  That said, I'm not immediately coming up with anything to support that he's still against the idea.  Could be that it just hasn't really come up yet.  Whether or not he is still against the idea, it would still be rather poetic for it to come full circle and put the two of them together again.    I remember him saying that - but can you remind me who it was he said it to?  Locus and Felix?  I need to go back and watch it again."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,ChickadeeAce,6,Tue May 19 18:17:34 2015 UTC,He's still scarred from having Epsilon attempt to kill itself in his mind. He allowed Alpha in but I doubt that changed him. Of course the Counselor is using his data from PFL so he may be unaware of Wash's current mental status.
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Dan_Of_Time,2,Tue May 19 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... might or might not.  Keep in mind, Wash spoke with both the Counselor and the Director at the end of Season 6 when the EMP was activated and Alpha and all the other fragments were destroyed.  He should know that Alpha came in with Wash.  But as you said, I don't think that would have changed Wash's attitude towards taking on another fragment.  He did react in quite a hostile manner towards Delta in Recovery One."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Tue May 19 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"he straight said ""thats why i wouldnt let them put another one in me, i wasnt sure i could keep what i know hidden, ironically thats why they trusted me for this mission""  i cant remember exaclty when i think right after they get epsilon out of storage"
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Forikorder,1 point,Wed May 20 02:16:57 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right.  It doesn't necessarily mean that Wash wants an AI, though, or that the experience wouldn’t be distressing.  Poor Wash is broken goods.  Even if he did have hidden motivation for not allowing another AI fragment, he did have to suffer through Epsilon going insane, and went temporarily insane himself, perhaps.  Think how paranoid he is about betrayal, and then imagine how terrifyingly intimate the connection with a fragment could be.  The combination doesn't sound.... ideal.  But as I said, your point is spot on."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Wed May 20 02:40:57 2015 UTC,not saying he wants one but i doubt hed freak if Epsilon plugged theres trust there now
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Forikorder,2,Wed May 20 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"Trust of a sort.  Keep in mind how Epsilon freaked on the entire party and pushed them away in Season 10, and abandoned them completely when they were stranded.  Even though it appears all is forgiven,  he has a recent history of unpredictable behaviour now.  Trust is there, but might be sporting an asterisk after.  You might be right on all points, but I am just throwing this out there to cover all the bases."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Wed May 20 03:11:02 2015 UTC,using abandoned in the loosest term possible since what they were actually doing was hunting down the space pirates  wash seemed more concerned that Carolina left then Epsilon since that made him leader im sure he understands tehy made the exact right call and its not like they could ahve helped that much in the canyon
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Forikorder,1 point,Wed May 20 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"They left without warning, without explanation, with no clue when, or even whether they would be back.  That is going to do some damage, especially to an already paranoid soldier.  Yes, there might have been good reasons for it, and yes, all might be forgiven later, but the anxiety, fear and sense of betrayal he felt during that time would still leave a mark.  He still experienced it, no matter what came next.    And couldn't have helped that much?  Well, on one hand, having them not around was less of a drain on resources/food.  But look at everything Caboose and Tucker went through.  They both were pretty ripped up and the impact on the Blue team was  severe.  A simple goodbye could have eased a lot of that pain.  A one line note, even."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Wed May 20 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"you are blowing Washingtons paranoia WAY out of porpotion with no evidence or even hint theres even the slightest shred of proof there  he knows Carolina isnt the type to do something on a whim, and he knows Epsilon wouldnt want to leave without good reason"
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,Forikorder,5,Wed May 20 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"Tucker is the great warrior, Carolina goes in the thing with Church, they have separate judgements, the process jogs something inside Epsilon, and Epsilon becomes a full AI, may even achieve metastability."
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,TodtheT1000,2,Tue May 19 19:03:01 2015 UTC,I would say that most the wild theories are wrong (like the theory Locus is Maine).
RedvsBlue,36i0gu,SerJolton,2,Wed May 20 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"My crazy theory would be Locus stopping Felix near the climax of the season. And maybe just sacrificing himself for the crew. Just a something that I came up with after seeing Locus of Control. If Locus used to be moral and and didn't get along with Felix, I'm pretty much sure that we can't rule the trope out of the picture."
RedvsBlue,36iaf3,CBcube,16,Tue May 19 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"I noticed that to, but keep in mind that she originally got the helmet from one of the enemy soldiers. So I'm sure what we are seeing is just another peon running around."
RedvsBlue,36iaf3,SpunkyRooster,12,Tue May 19 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"Not likely, All of the female mercs use recon. We've already seen a few since then.  When Locus leaves the gateway you can see the other soldiers vanish, showing the time passing. Then Blue Team rolls up. Since they came in a convoy I doubt Carolina snuck out to spy on the Mercs."
RedvsBlue,36iaf3,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Tue May 19 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"If all the female mercs use recon, it would make you wonder if the mercs are thinking about changing their helmets. To prevent Carolina from impersonating a mer."

It also wouldn't really fit with the last episode. The pirates were shown to have arrived at the temple before Carolina, Grey and the Blues got there. The group probably thought they arrived first because Felix told the pirates to leave no trace they were there."
RedvsBlue,36iaf3,Animated95,1 point,Tue May 19 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, especially since rewatching 12,10 and that's a kind of give away that it's her, but the fact that she said they arrived not a moment to soon makes me think they thought they were ahead of the pirates/mercs."
RedvsBlue,36iaf3,beregond23,1 point,Tue May 19 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"I thought just the opposite, with not a moment to soon because if they were sooner they would have been killed/had another confrontation."

RedvsBlue,36e3m3,MISTERKRABBZz,3,Mon May 18 17:46:35 2015 UTC,Maybe some gloves? I feel like tucker would be the type to have soft hands...
RedvsBlue,36eqxy,zacablast3r,4,Mon May 18 20:35:30 2015 UTC,No I don't  think so great idea for you to do. But you should wait after the season is over to make it because we have not seen him in armor yet.
RedvsBlue,36eqxy,Franketti579,7,Mon May 18 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah we did, though I prefer the old armor."

RedvsBlue,36eqxy,Eproth,1 point,Tue May 19 01:02:50 2015 UTC,They probably can't have a sharkface visor because they have to create the armor in game at some point.
RedvsBlue,36eqxy,spiral6,0,Tue May 19 12:24:31 2015 UTC,I know. I just hope that they'll find some way to get it in the game. How awesome would that be for a shader? Beats the hell put of Emiles stupid ghost face.

Perhaps this suit is just a recreation, since the Chairman said it had a great deal of upgrades. Repurposing an old suit just because it's got historical significance doesn't seem right, especially when the chairman has a fondness for keeping trophies.  Keep the helmet as a trophy, rebuild the suit with new specs from the info from Project Freelancer and the experiments done by his own scientists.  As for Maine's body, he's dead most probably. He's no use to anyone."
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Mon May 18 10:44:51 2015 UTC,well you realise the room he was placing the call in was most likely the trophy room
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,Forikorder,2,Mon May 18 19:30:30 2015 UTC,Yes.. I suppose so.. Maybe you're right.
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,PrinceCheddar,2,Mon May 18 19:31:31 2015 UTC,well it was full of items of significance
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,Forikorder,5,Mon May 18 19:32:47 2015 UTC,the UNSC probably eventually managed to recover it and then either buried it somewhere quietly (since i doubt theres anyone to claim it) or stripped the armour off and tossed it back in
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,Forikorder,4,Mon May 18 15:38:59 2015 UTC,Possibly stored somewhere else. I doubt the chairman would have thrown it away. He's sick like that
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,Dan_Of_Time,2,Mon May 18 06:03:52 2015 UTC,"I think Maine is possibly still alive. That is a super soldier space suit, designed to keep warriors alive in battle. He lives through several bullets to the throat, and I'm fairly positive there is water at the bottom of that cliff. I can't believe that Maine, super soldier to the max, dies from falling into water.  But then, without his suit, what are they going to do? Give Maine a face? They haven't even given Wash a face in 7 seasons."
RedvsBlue,36c4qy,DarkRubberDucky,-2,Mon Jun 8 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"Still inside the suit, parts of him, anyway. A tangled mess of wires and preserved flesh. Brain dead but still being animated by computer.   All that stuff he said about giving them the suit? Bullshit. His plan is that they kill the reds and blues and then he gives them the suit, they open the drop pod to get it and pull the helmet off revealing the ice-water preserved face of Maine. And then he fucking murders them, or tries to. The plan is no loose ends. Kill the reds, blues, Felix and Locus and you just have the braindead cyborg, supersoldier Meta left. Neat."

Someone who doesn't have a worst fear wouldn't be able to be punished. Who would that be? In classic RvB fashion, I think it would be Caboose. He simply doesn't have the mental capacity to be scared of anything."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,jijuyiuhnjyubytvtyfr,16,Mon May 18 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"Welp, guess Epsilon's not gonna be going into the ""shows you your worst fear"" beam..."

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,jijuyiuhnjyubytvtyfr,2,Mon May 18 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly while the AI mess was harsh I think Epsilon would more have The Directors memories, we might see him being told she died (I'm kind of rooting for seeing her get blown to bits bc Alison is too bad ass to just die in some boring manner but I don't think their is any footage of her death in Epsilons memory)."

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,ilivetofly,1 point,Tue May 19 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"Alpha got really upset in the situations the fragments forced him into when the Director was trying to harvest fragments. Based on what we see of the process, the fragments presented Alpha with 'situations that he was designed to fail at and here his failures effected the rest of the team'. So I'd say Church's biggest fear would be of letting his team down."

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,ilivetofly,5,Mon May 18 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"If we see Carolina's worst fear, it will be York hating her, calling it now."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,AAAHSPIDERS,1 point,Mon May 18 13:54:11 2015 UTC,I think if both york and Tex/Carolina turned on her she would crumble. I also think it might be from her childhood since Alison wasn't really their and she did anything for the director... who knows BUT I CANT WAIT

He does have the traits the machine is looking for, I will give you that; however, he also holds the traits of the Great Destroyer from Season 3 (incredibly strong, clad in blue armour, and the stupidest lifeform in the universe). I'm betting that, come next Sunday/Monday, they're all gonna go into the device. Most will be rejected by the machine, as few fit any of the traits that the machine is looking for. Caboose, however, will come out last, followed by an alarm: ""The Great Destroyer has arrived! The end is near!"""

I really want to know what felix's fear is he is so charismatic and cocky I think it would be interesting to see
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,alynnidalar,28,Mon May 18 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"Everybody's talking about the Locus scene (which I agree was awesome), and I'm just sitting over here being excited about how amazing the Counselor is...  Here you've got this tiny little guy, no armor, no fighting experience that we know of, a total egghead. And he's running around with these huge, terrifying, half- (or all-) psychotic supersoldiers with these scary guns in armor, and he's openly psychoanalyzing them. And he's been doing this for years.  And somehow, not a single one has snapped and killed him. He's got serious people skills. It's kinda scary.  (I'm curious if Sharkface actually knows who he is, though--and what Sharkface might do if he figures out that the Counselor was a big part of Project Freelancer. And, for that matter, that Wash and Carolina switched sides and helped take down Project Freelancer in the end. Could be interesting...)"
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,LadWatcherIsHere,14,Mon May 18 01:48:58 2015 UTC,I think he knows. He called him Counselor and he asked how he ended up working with the Freelancers or at least that's what it sounds like since the counselor talks about his past rather than his present meaning he's referring to the Freelancer Project.
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,alynnidalar,18,Mon May 18 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"When he asked that, I thought he meant how the Counselor ended up on maximum security prison ship. And ""Counselor"" is a pretty generic title. Doesn't necessarily mean he knows who the Counselor is."

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,locus782,6,Mon May 18 05:28:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Even though they took down project freelancer, they still fucked up his life badly. He definitely wants revenge."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,LadWatcherIsHere,21,Mon May 18 05:57:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, Sharkface's monologue was amazing. Gray once again nails it with his voice acting. I was a little surprised that he called those soldiers his family but it makes sense once you think about it. Clearly Sharkface is not just some ol' good reminder of the Freelancer Saga. He has reasons to fight.  It will be very exciting when he finds out that Carolina, Wash and the Reds and Blues AKA the people he's supposed to kill are the ones who took down Project Freelancer and that the person he's currently working for AKA Chairman wants to bring the project back to life.   Who really deserves his vendetta?"

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,locus782,15,Tue May 19 12:05:21 2015 UTC,"That Locus scene was incredible. It shows that Locus wasn't always the way he is, and how he regrets what he's done, kind of like how Wash felt after project freelancer, that's why Locus is so obsessed with him. He reminds him of himself before he became what he is."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,84981725891758912576,14,Mon May 18 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"I wonder who the leader guy is... In a journal, Locus says ""Tell me Washington, who is most deserving of your hate? The man who fires the gun? The man who makes the gun? Or the gun?"" Clearly, he considers himself the gun, and the Chairman appears to be the one who fires the gun, but I think that their squad leader is the one who makes the gun. I don't think he'll be more significant aside from extra motivation for Locus, due to the fact that their entire squad died."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Forikorder,5,Mon May 18 00:35:24 2015 UTC,i think hes the reason Felix and Locus ended up so fucked up though
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,LadWatcherIsHere,15,Mon May 18 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think that includes Felix. For what we've seen in the flashback, Felix has always been a sociopath while Locus had morals and ideals. And since Felix didn't see anything then he has no regrets about the things he's done. Of course, that could be wrong if Felix was lying or if there is an actual past he's hiding but it's hard to consider it given that he hasn't really done anything wrong when it comes to his character.  He's always the same sociopath who likes to make jokes."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Forikorder,25,Mon May 18 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"except Felix said he DID see something straight out of his nightmares, the not seeing anything was a joke  considering how emotional he got with Tucker and his speech at the end of the season im definently thinking Felix saw some of himself in Tucker and hates him for it  maybe Felix convinced Locus to try to save the guy like how Tucker convinced the other 3 to go rescue wash"
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,LadWatcherIsHere,6,Mon May 18 02:19:09 2015 UTC,That... actually makes a LOT of sense. Though Felix looks like he's beyond redemption while Locus feels conflicted. I wonder if the character development will be only for Locus? Maybe he turns good and fights Felix at the end of the season.
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Forikorder,3,Mon May 18 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"maybe both of them do and they team up to take down Hargrove before he perfects his super soldier to wipe them all out  well turning ""good"" may be a stretch lets say ""decide that chorus was a mistake"""
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Franklin413,11,Mon May 18 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, we may be seeing Locus beginning to see that hes on the wrong side, maybe by the end of the season Locus will switch sides, Washington style?"

Whatever it was, it barely fazed him, but he definitely remembers (and probably hates) it.   Thirdly, I'm actually starting to feel sorry for Locus. He seems confused, and a bit anxious/regretful of something. There's something in his past... he wasn't always a merc..."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,PrinceCheddar,11,Mon May 18 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"The original was probably custom made, so the pattern didn't interfere with the operation of the visor. He can't just take an ordinary visor and spray paint all over it. It would hinder his vision."

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Tearfulfriend18,10,Mon May 18 07:21:26 2015 UTC,"Seeing how Locus was before makes me really think that he'll switch sides by the end of this, or at least betray Felix. And Jesus, Felix was always bloodthirsty wasn't he? Was that why they never got along?"
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,JacksonSX35,6,Mon May 18 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"The song 'contact' might foreshadow Locus and his mental state.    'one of us will be forgotten/ the other one's wrong'   I get the feeling Locus is the wrong one, and Felix will be forgotten, but we've a ways to go before any of this can be proven."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Anathe,3,Tue May 19 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"The lyric is ""one of us won't be forgotten,"" which makes me think it's the other way around. Felix is on the wrong side, while Locus won't be forgotten. I'm wondering if he's going to sacrifice himself to save the Reds & Blues, or at least save their lives and turn on Hargrove and Felix.  Edit: Also, the lyric ""Am I still willing / To foot all this billing?"" makes me think of Locus 'settling his debts'"
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,ChickadeeAce,3,Tue May 19 08:52:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I've never considered Contact outside of the BGC and Friends, though I wouldn't put too much weight on it applying directly to events on Chorus.  But I would have thought that if it was about anyone, that it's about Church and Tex.  ""Forgotten"" is a pretty charged word in RvB - and one tied rather tightly to Tex and Epsilon/Church.  Connect that to the cowboy image, and the idea of someone's name in the sky - I think that it's not likely to be Locus and Felix.  If you're looking for settling debts, that applies to Epsilon just as well, considering what he and Carolina left to do.  If Tex won't be forgotten - maybe she does come back.  I just hope that it isn't because Epsilon is dying and remembers her one last time."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,Anathe,2,Tue May 19 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"""We are green and grey"" led me to think the song is referring to Locus and Felix. Back in their UNSC days, Felix and Locus both wore green and grey armor, although Felix changed to orange.  Also I think bringing Tex back (except maybe as a dying Epsilon's memory) would be a disservice not only to the character, but to the last few seasons as well."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,ChickadeeAce,2,Tue May 19 20:52:55 2015 UTC,I agree completely with you re Tex coming back.  Still not sold on the Locus/Felix idea.  The melancholy wistful sound of the song just really doesn't lend well to the idea.  I would see green and grey as a way of gracefully shoehorning colours into another rvb song.  Every single one has them.  And they don't necessarily have any meaning in relation to what is happening in the season they are tacked on to.

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,OptionK,4,Tue May 19 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"So at first I was like: Damn. That scene after Locus goes through the gateway was fucking intense. Then I was like: That's kind of a lame setup though. Just some magic show-you-stuff-from-your-past/worst-nightmares device? I mean the scene was cool, but that's kind of a lazy way of getting there. But then I was also like: Well the aliens already brought Flowers back from the dead, so I guess it isn't too much of a stretch too think they might have something like this gateway. So I guess I'm ok with it, though the nature of the gateway does seem a bit contrived.  And the stuff written on the temple walls says they're looking for a soldier with ""great strength and mental clarity?"" That has to be Caboose, right?  Also, how much do the Counselor and Sharkface know, and what are their motivations? Does the Counselor know he's working for Hargrove? From what he said this episode, it seems like he ended up regretting being a part of Project Freelancer, but that doesn't necessarily mean that that he'd be down to work for Hargrove. And if he regrets what he did as part of Project Freelancer, why would he be so willing to go after Wash and Carolina? Shouldn't he identify with them? Offering to help Felix and Locus obviously kept him alive, so is he doing it just so they don't kill him, or does he actually have some animosity toward Wash and Carolina? Does Sharkface know that the Counselor was involved in Project Freelancer? Shouldn't he be mad at him as well? Does he know that Wash and Carolina eventually turned against Project Freelancer? Should that even matter to him or make him less interested in getting revenge against them?  How is Hargrove going to get a new AI? Will he have one made based on himself? That would seem pretty appropriate, creating a family of Hargrove-based AI's to go after the one remaining Church-based AI.  If Hargrove gets an AI before things wrap up on Chorus, who would it/the Metasuit be given to? What characters from earlier seasons remain that could potentially return? Maybe it would be given to Sharkface? Though I doubt Hargrove would want to give something like that to someone he doesn't really know. Someone else mentioned the possibility of it being given to the guy giving orders to Locus and Felix in Locus' gateway scene. That would be interesting, but it also feels like a potentially good opportunity to bring back someone we know already. I'm not sure who that would be though.  If the gateway energy was used to develop the future cubes (the cubes of the future!), has Doc been languishing in some kind of personal hell this whole time? Maybe that's who will get the Metasuit! Hargrove has a way of keeping track of everything that goes through the cubes, knows that he's there and what he's going through, brings him out (now all deranged from the horrors he's seen for however long it's been), gives him another aggressive/evil AI and the Metasuit, and sends the longtime pacifist on a goddamn killing spree. I don't actually like this idea that much, but it seemed just barely interesting enough to be worth typing out.  Ok, that's probably enough (if not too much) for me to say about this episode/season so far."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,alynnidalar,1 point,Mon May 18 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Counselor: he very much strikes me as the kind of guy who doesn't really care what he's doing and who he's doing it for, he just wants to make sure things go his way. He's smart, I'm sure by now he's figured out Hargrove is in charge even if no one told him directly.   As for why he wouldn't side with Wash and Carolina--well, they turned against the project and helped bring it down. And he was party to some pretty messed up stuff that was done to both of them. He's not really a natural ally."

He'd happily work against them if he thought he'd benefit. He's no more loyal to Felix and Locus than he is to anybody else.  The only way he survived the ""purge"" of the prison ship was by making himself useful to Locus and Felix--and until he can figure out a way off of Chorus, he's got to keep that going."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,OptionK,1 point,Tue May 19 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Right, but we're maybe kind of confusing two issues: his interest in working with Felix and Locus/his interest in working against Wash/Carolina.

RedvsBlue,36bd4b,OptionK,1 point,Tue May 19 17:02:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If he still thinks Project Freelancer was a good idea, maybe he's pissed off at them. If he regrets it, maybe he sympathizes with them.  But he's going after them while also telling Sharkface that he regrets it. Even though those two things don't really line up. Which might support your proposal that he's simply trying to survive. It's tough to say."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,ChickadeeAce,2,Tue May 19 17:38:45 2015 UTC,"The Counselor made my skin crawl from the first time I saw him.  He's pure manipulation - listening to him talk, he sounds like an evil hypnotist.  It was always up to him to salvage matters when the Director blew up at the Freelancers - the friction there could have caused a real explosion if he hadn't said all the right things in just the right way to defuse different situations.  And the Director regularly stomped on him, ignored his advice and acted quite capriciously.  If he sees the remaining Freelancers as an extension of the Director and the remaining part of his legacy, however tarnished, that he can stamp on and destroy -- I wouldn't put it past him.  I would give a pretty to know what happened to that last surviving soldier we met in the very first episode of Season 6.  The one that the Counselor said would be staying with them for as long as was necessary.  This guy is no innocent, and I have a hard time imagining him having regrets."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,OptionK,2,Tue May 19 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have a response, but I think everything you're saying is very insightful and wanted to let you know that I read it."
RedvsBlue,36bd4b,ChickadeeAce,2,Tue May 19 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks mate.  It's a great discussion.    I noticed your guess for Caboose re: soldier of great strength and mental clarity.  I've almost been losing sleep over that, trying to figure out who in the world would fit that the most.  Straight up, I cannot think of any one soldier that we've met.    But while trying to swing the meaning of that around a bit, I have two rather mental ideas.    1) This gets a bit Saturday Morning Cartoons-ish, but... if it's related to the BGC it could be that the entire team goes in together.  All of them are flawed as people and soldiers, but when they fight together they are greater than the sum of their very tarnished parts.  All the selfishness, the egos, the laziness, the fear, the anxiety - it all gets pushed aside for something bigger.    2) In a much more wild guess -- Locus.  We might have the makings of a redemption story here.  It would swing in the opposite direction of Felix's, where we believed he was a hero, and he turned out to be a scumbag - we thought we saw Locus clearly as a scumbag from the start, and he could end up being something more.  Washington saw through his self-deception, and called him out on being a murderer and a coward, and not a soldier.  Then facing down his vision in the portal, we see a version of himself, maybe a real memory from the past, where he is guided by his conscience and seems to feel genuine compassion.  Is that part of the horror of this portal thing?  That you see what you were before you made choices that brought you to what you now are?  Knowing that you could have made different choices that would have made you a better person, or a better soldier?  If Wash made a crack in his self-perception, that portal thing had to have ripped it open further.  What would he do with that new sense of awareness?  Recklessly try to strike out to prove to himself that he really is the soldier he believed he was?  Or sacrifice himself to try and put things right?  If it really is him, I cannot believe that he will survive either way."

The flood don't really have a brain, except for a Gravemind (since they're a hive minded species), and only really have one instinct: Attack things to infect.

Still pretty unclear.  Maine is the bald man. I don't think anyone would consider Locus a second Maine, even with the armor and the wound. Perhaps he could become a second Meta, but not a second Maine."
RedvsBlue,3665y5,Samocoptor,2,Sat May 16 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"As well as that, we already have an established history for Locus; him and Felix are placed together from the Great War and onwards from that, there's no association we can make with Maine considering this would be the time he was operating as a member of PFL/gone rogue as the Meta."

RedvsBlue,3665y5,PrinceCheddar,2,Mon May 18 11:19:29 2015 UTC,"That would actually make a lot of sense. Locus is obsessed with power and becoming a true warrior, so he gets the armor and an AI fragment to run it and boom, new meta. What I want to know is what happened to the AI that ran the meta? Delta showed the AI can back themselves up to external storage, so why do we assume that they died with the meta? If the armor survived the fall so could they."
RedvsBlue,3665y5,zacablast3r,2,Tue May 19 14:20:42 2015 UTC,"You mean during the freefall? It's been made a big deal that A.I. cannot be copied, hence why the torture of Alpha was necessary to perform the experiments with multiple A.I..   Delta: I have high degree of confidence we will be able to complete this maneuver.  Delta flashes.  Four Seven Niner: Wait a second, why did you just blink like that?  Delta: That was just a standard maintenance routine.  Four Seven Niner: Dude! Did you just make a backup of yourself?  Delta: Confidence is one thing, but it is always prudent to prepare for failure.  Four Seven Niner: That's a dick move, green guy.  Delta: I apologize if I have offended-    Delta doesn't actually outright confirm that he was creating a backup.  Creating a backup in case the pelican went down doesn't make sense since he wouldn't have access to anything outside of the pelican to copy himself into. Anything he tried to copy himself into would be as likely to be destroyed as Delta in York's armor.  The EMP wiped out the original A.I. An EMP would wipe data and the programming of any backup within the Meta's armor, more thoroughly than any crash could.  However, I believe the memories of them we see existing within Epsilon are more than just simulations. I think copies of the A.I. do exist within Epsilon, that could potential exist separate from Epsilon.  Having them be copies makes sense to me. We treat the new Church as Church, not as some A.I. simulating Church. Similarly, the memory of Tex was able to separate from the rest of Epsilon, proving that they can be more than just Epsilon pretending to interact with the A.I. They can exist separately from him.  Personally, I think the ""death"" Church talked about in the trailer was the death of Epsilon, but the reason Epsilon is dying is because the A.I. within it are separating themselves. We'll get a return of all the A.I.: Alpha, Delta, Theta. but Sigma and Omega as well, who will side with Charon. All except Beta, Tex, since she is at peace or whatever.  True, the memory of Delta refused to call himself Delta, but that's because he isn't Delta. Delta ""died"" in the EMP. Had that not happened, Delta and this memory of Delta could have existed simultaneously. Therefore, he is not Delta. But since he is a copy, and the original one is dead, we may as well think of him as Delta.  Of course, the idea that these memories can be considered copies goes against the rule that A.I. can't be copied, but since the Director was already pushing the bounds of A.I. experimentation, it's possible such a thing was always possible, but not known about."

I was thinking.. the chairman said that Epsilon wasn't advanced enough to operate the suit, too old..  I assume the original bunch of A.I. within the Meta would have been enough, since they were able to do it without all the improvements Charon has made. And if the Meta had indeed been able to achieve metastability, it should have been more advanced than any newer A.I.  And Epsilon, IMO, is more or less a blank slate that has memories of all the other A.I., similar to copies.  Could the chairman be underestimating Epsilon? Think he's just another basic fragment when it appears he's more advanced than the others, able to either recreate/simulate the personalities of Alpha and the rest.  http://www.reddit.com/r/RedvsBlue/comments/35ify8/speculation_and_thoughts_about_the_season_so_far/cr4sib9  If my general idea is right.. the chairman my try recreating the Meta, hoping to have a metastable A.I. to operate the suit.."

Personally, I think the program working for the chairman currently IS Sheila.  A copy of F.I.L.S.S. was in the tank, and her name changed to Sheila. The tank then got blown up. The tank then got repaired by Lopez, after which she became a lot more complex. I think Lopez fixed her too well, to the point where she evolved into more a person than a very advanced Seri.  Shelia, who was more a person than the original F.I.L.S.S., was placed inside the ship, which then crashed. She stayed there for a while.  Meanwhile, the primary F.I.L.S.S. remained running Project Freelancer bases, until the Director ordered her wipe everything, including herself.  Then the Chairman salvaged Sheila from the ship, who wasn't destroyed since she was separate from the other F.I.L.S.S. He wanted to use her as a personal assistant, another trophy, but due to her more advanced programming, she resisted, resulting in the Chairman having something done to her. She's made to work for him and even made to use her original name, with the side effect of the depressed voice. And now she's being forced to help him kill her friends.  The Chairman's real name is ""Malcom Hargrove"" BTW."
RedvsBlue,35sv66,PrinceCheddar,3,Wed May 13 10:52:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. It HAS to be Sheila. However, I began to think. Unlike FILSS who can be implanted anywhere, Sheila can only be implanted into vehicles. The Staff of Charon IS a vehicle, and Sheila has only made appearances when the ship makes an appearance. So I think it's definitely her."
RedvsBlue,35sv66,Animated95,3,Wed May 13 12:11:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think I agree. From what I remember, and it's been a while since I last watched it, I think Tex only specified that Sheila wasn't the kind of A.I. that could be placed into armor, like Gamma and Omega. She then said they needed another large vehicle.  Now, this might mean Sheila can only be put in vehicle, or it might mean Tex thought it was the only solution. That Shelia could, theoretically, be put into a normal computer, but there was no way to bring the tank to computer while it was switched off nor could they bring a stationary computer to Sheila.  I'm not saying it's impossible.. It just seems like an unnecessary complication."

Season 1: Tex is hyped up and appears for the first time Season 2: Tex possesses Lopez's body and appears for the first time since dying Season 3: (nothing special) Season 4: (nothing special) Season 5: Tex's first full appearance in the season (she's mentioned in episode 9) Season 6: (nothing special) Season 7: (reveal that the original dig site team is dead, but nothing aside from that) Season 8: the big Tex fight (she appears briefly at the end of episode 9) Season 9: Tex's first full appearance in the prequel stuff (she appears briefly at the end of episode 9) Season 10: Tex's first full appearance in the season (she appears briefly at the end of episode 9) Season 11: no Tex, but a fakeout with Doc and Donut Season 12: Carolina's first appearance in the season  So Tex has appeared for the first time in a season in 6 out of 12 seasons."

Sharkface is probably going to be introduced earlier, as it seems more likely that the inevitable battle at the Jungle Digsite will happen in the next few episodes, where he's probably going to be revealed (and I suspect killed off).  Doc is likely because Doc.  Maine is likely because A: He's had a big reveal pretty close to a tenth episode before (remember when he met Donut in Recreation?), and B: There's been so much mention of him and teases at some kind of return that I'd be surprised if he doesn't make an entrance sooner or later."

RedvsBlue,35nvnf,OtakuMecha,1 point,Tue May 12 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that I've kinda reworked after last episode:  The chairman underestimates Epsilon. Since Epsilon was little more than a chaotic mess back when Project Freelancer still existed, its exact nature was never documented. The chairman thinks he's just another fragment, much lesser than the original Alpha.  When in reality, these ""memories"" of the A.I. are more than just memories. They're like copies. Hence why we consider Epsilon ""Church"" rather than just an A.I. pretending to be Church, how the second Tex was able to become independent to Epsilon and how Epsilon is able to ""learn"" how to jump between bodies. True, they're not the originals, so they're ""just"" memories, but for all intents and purposes, they be resurrected.  Epsilon is going to ""die,"" but really it's all the memories of the A.I. splitting the A.I. apart. So, there will be a second Alpha, Theta, Gamma, etc.  Sigma and Omega escape to join Charon. Together are enough to run the suit. The chairman gets his suit operational, Sigma gets another chance to try and become metastable, the Meta's suit once again contains THE Meta and the Chairman has a chance to potentially create humanity's first metastable A.I., something that should be very valuable. Good for business, as we saw last episode was important to him."
RedvsBlue,35nvnf,PrinceCheddar,0,Thu May 14 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"Well, Charon wants Church, but, they may have to settle for a lesser A.I. ...maybe...Freckles...Filiss...?"

My second favorite from them is ""Good Fight"", which definitely is used in the show, previously as Church's theme, now more as Wash's theme. It is on the album ""Ghosts That Linger"".  Jeff Williams did some really good tracks for seasons 8-10, as well. I love all of the lyrical ones, like ""I Am The Best"" and ""I Say Ooh"" from season 8, ""Bow Chicka Bow Wow"" and ""Donut: The Musical"" from season 9, as well as ""Pray"" and ""Come on Carolina"" from season 10.

I don't like how people are always trying to bring back characters in ridiculous ways, except for Donut, Doc and Lopez, because they are minor characters  and their continued return was always funny. I've said this before, and I'd much rather see new characters like Locus and Felix rather than returning villains like the meta or the director. It's not even for the laziness of writing, it's just the characters get old after a while.

RedvsBlue,35ii4h,Forikorder,1 point,Mon May 11 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"It's not really a paradox, Malcolm probably shipped his body off to some lab and had the armour on the ship so he could have it recovered."

Ultimately, they manage to best them in battle. Cue entrance of Sharkface, clad in his Insurrectionist armor and with flamethrower in hand. Eventually, using technology recovered from the site, Carolina actually kills him this time. Outnumbered and faced with alien technology, Felix and Locus are forced to flee.  Flash forward to the end of Episode 10, the episode generally reserved for big reveals. Chairman Hargrove is berating his two mercs for their failure, one that risks his entire operation on Chorus, for not only have they not killed the stragglers yet, but they have both suffered massive casualties and lost the technology Hargrove sought in the first place. As a result, he tells them that their services are no longer needed, and cuts off the video chat, effectively leaving them alone on Chorus.  Hargrove, now alone in his trophy room, orders FILSS to retrieve both the prototype armour and his ""special guest"". Two silver blocks emerge; one contains the prototype armour, and the other's contents are not visible.  Hargrove begins to speak to the obscured block. He tells it the situation so far, and that he needs some ""loose ends tied up."" He says that for such services will come great rewards. As he says this, he reaches behind his head and pulls out a silver chip; it's the smart AI he has been working to achieve.  Hargrove says that he will offer the reward in advance to help tie loose ends. Cue a slow panning shot towards the obscured block, revealing it's contents: a bald white man in a cryogenic tube, with bullet scarring across his throat...."

Maine doesn't have to work with him, per se, so much as the Chairman needs to give him the suit, tell him where the Epsilon AI is, and let him do his thing. As for sending Maine against Felix and Locus...well, I doubt the Chairman would care about what those two are capable of. All that would concern him is that there are two people out there who know what he's been up to, and that they need to be killed. Price, I believe, is currently working for the Chairman after being found on the ship, and is probably just there with the mercs to help make sure Sharkface is alright. Even if he isn't, I'd bet the former Councilor would think of something to convince Maine to let him live (i.e. lying about Epsilon's location, mentioning the AI Hargrove is trying to create, etc.).   plus hes DEAD   Yeah, and Church is a ghost, and Carolina is dead.

Plus, Maine's bound to have a grudge against the Reds and Blues; that should be enough of a guarantee for the Chairman that the Meta will at least kill them, especially considering that they possess Epsilon.   worst case scenario hes fine with just having a smart AI that can run all the equipment already and just goes straight after the chairmans forces to get somewhere safe   As I said, he's probably got a grudge against the BGC, so he has reason not to just abandon Hargrove as soon as Maine gets his equipment. Also, you've gotta remember: his desire for Freelancer AI has been practically ingrained in his mind; I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't really have a choice in going after Epsilon. Add to that that the Epsilon AI is as close to the Alpha AI that Maine can ever get, and you've got a near guarantee that he'll do what Hargrove needs him to do.   the Meta wants power, the 2 armies of Chorus dont ahve the power he wants aside from Epsilon (and remember in this scenario he has a fully functional smart AI) but the Chairman does in the form of alien tech and other enhancements   Keep in mind, there's apparently a goldmine of alien tech down on Chorus. I imagine by the time this scenario happens, both sides will probably possess some amount of the ancient weaponry found on the planet. Considering that Maine's prototype suit will already have all of his PF enhancements—highly improved, mind you—and a new smart AI to control them, I doubt that the Chairman will have any other tech to suit his needs that isn't on Chorus. All the Meta will have to worry about is a grudge to settle, a bunch of alien tech to acquire from Chorus, and an AI he's needed for some time.   several stab wounds and submerged in freezing water for a long length of time doesnt matter how much stamina he has in that scenario hed freeze or drown in minutes   You seem to forget the time he got shot by a sniper rifle, had his throat torn by bullets, hit by a truck going several dozen mph, and fell off a freeway that was probably as high up as the cliff at Sidewinder, and survived.

I wouldn't be surprised if it's a little below 1,000, even with the Space Pirates taken into account. Speaking of which....   the space pirates are mercs if he pays them theyd kill felix and locus themselves   Hargrove said it himself: Felix and Locus are two of the most deadly, intelligent mercenaries he could hire. Knowing that the Space Pirates are now riddled with inexperienced prisoners, I'm not entirely sure that they'd manage to kill the duo. It'd probably take someone as hyper-lethal as Maine to kill them.  Also, like I said, there's not too many Space Pirates left, let alone that many to begin with. Considering how they had to boost their numbers with prisoners, they're likely running on empty. It'd take more than what they have now to kill them—hence, Maine.   assuming hes dumb enough to care about Epsilon when he already has an AI that can run all his equipment if he has a grudge against anyone it WOULD have been wash but he worked fine with him for a time, Meta cares about getting power not settling scores, settling scores gets in the way of him getting power so he wouldnt bother   Concerning Epsilon, it's not about what he can do, it's about what he represents: the Alpha AI. He can't do as much as a more modern and smart AI, but he is the Alpha's memory. To Maine, and the Meta overall, it was always about pursuing the Alpha AI and it's fragments. That's why he was never interested in Sheila on the ship; she wasn't a part of what could produce a metastable AI. He'll definitely be happy to have a smart AI to power the suit, but it's Epsilon that matters to him the most, not because of what he can or cannot do, but because he more or less represents the Alpha.  As for grudges, he definitely has a grudge against the BGC. He's got one for nearly all of them: Wash, for the EMP (yes, he worked with him for a while after that, but out of necessity; plus, the partnership was strained while it lasted); the Reds and Blues for robbing him of Epsilon-Tex and them dragging him into a frozen ocean, as well as aiding Wash with the EMP.  The only one I can't think he'd have a grudge against is Carolina; still, she possesses te Epsilon AI, and as long as she does, she is a target.   aside from the equally powerful (if not more so) AI Malcolm gives him in addition to his armour you mean   Again, Epsilon represents the Alpha; he'll mean more to Maine on a personal level.   of all those things freezing water is by far the most deadly when you have so many stab wounds, especially while attached to a car   Remember, Maine had a Freelancer suit on, armour capable of keeping an agent alive and well in the void of space. I think a suit as advanced as that can probably provide a lot of protection against cold water.  Plus, this is Maine we're talking about. He's known for surviving tough shit like this.   honestly i dont get why people think RT is so incompetent there incapable of creating a new villain   I never said that they're incompetent. I think they're more than capable of creating a new villain, believe me! Still, we've been getting huge teases at Maine ever since Season 10 (Carolina lamenting Maine's fate and saying the BGC couldn't defeat him at Zanzibar, Sarge's rant in Season 11 ending with him asking if the Meta was involved with his conspiracy theory, Tucker saying that the BGC beat CT and Maine in Season 12, Grif mentioning the Bruteshot being confiscated, the helmet reveal at the end of Season 12, and now Maine's suit and the possibility of Felix and Locus being ""replaced""), so I'd think some kind of reveal for Maine surviving is coming."

RedvsBlue,35ii4h,jdofasgard,3,Mon May 11 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"I thought this episode would be a badass action one. Instead it was a badass plot-driven episode with some very telling revelations.  The various remains of the previous series: - Tex's helmet, the visor shattered from when The Meta stabbed her with the capture unit - Church's 'lazer face' monitor body - The Grifshot/ knifle - an old CE magnum? Whatever it was, it's small compared to the others. And probably not as powerful as it once was... Also, the RWBY Easter egg on the scrolling bar at the top of the screen!  The armour tells us that Maine is probably KIA, as there was no mention about a previous occupant being alive. I also don't think that the Meta would be much more than a shell after his defeat. But I digress, especially as u/-SpaceCommunist has put forward an awesome theory.   Seeing Wash and how he has earned the respect of the troops was cool to see, although not entirely. If anything happens to Kimball, then he could very well take over.   Carolina still doesn't know how to loosen up fully (plus the return of hey-chika-bump-bump!). Caboose is as sweet as ever, and Tucker is still attempting to crack a sexual joke... About sex with a jeep(s)? I'll leave that one by the wayside.   Carolina is itching for an opportunity to use her armour abilities, and since Felix and Locus are already at the temple, it will be an interesting fight- especially if the mercs can get whatever they found active...   Again, a very, very good episode."

Second... the Counselor probably knows where the leftover PF secrets are hidden. Such as the Engineer, maybe?

RedvsBlue,35k78u,ilivetofly,10,Mon May 11 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"I think Tex is based on what the Director remembers of Alison, and the Alison he thinks of most is the younger, badass woman he fell in love with, not the more mature woman who became a soldier and the mother of his child.  When the Director and Alison started dating, the two of them weren't very mature, but the Director thought she was awesome. Later, the two of got a bit older and more mature, settling down with each other. When she died, he couldn't get over her death and obsessed about her, specifically how she was when he first fell in love with her. Then Alpha was created, with Tex based on those memories coming along as well.  Similarly, I think Church reflects what the Director was like back then, since he's voiced by Burnie in that short scene with the Director in season 9, rather than the Director's voice actor. I think the Director's personality changed a great deal after Alison's death, he surrounded himself with work to try and distract himself from the grief. But for Alpha, he always had his Alision, Beta.  At least, that's how I interpreted it."

RedvsBlue,35k78u,forrestib,6,Tue May 12 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"Well she did kind of run off on Alpha, abandoning him on the Mother of Invention. And in a way she stole everything from the Director when she first died. So it's possible that was a subconscious way for him to acknowledge that she had wronged him without being able to remember exactly how or when or why."
RedvsBlue,35ify8,SomersaultGuy,2,Sun May 10 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"An idea I've had for a while, since before season 12, and recent events have made me more confident:  In the trailer, Church says that this is the story about how he ""died.""  Now, the fact that he was able to put this letter together implies that this isn't something sudden, but something Church was made aware of ahead of time, allowing him to get his affairs in order, hence making the email. Also, since he's talking about the story of how he dies, he must believe he's going to die, but at the time of writing has not died.  I think Epsilon will die, but not Church. Epsilon is a blank slate, an ""A.I."" that stores memories of other A.I., which act as copies. The copies exist within Epsilon, but Church is the dominate personality, so he has some control of the others.  Bad stuff is going to happen to Church. Perhaps he gets captured and experimented on or whatever. He thinks he's going to die. He does everything he can to tidy up, says goodbye to all his friends, and ""dies.""  Turns out what Church thought was Epsilon dying was actually Epsilon splitting up, the copies of the A.I. becoming independent from Epsilon, same way the memory of Tex was able to become independent from Epsilon. It's just Tex is special, so was able to do it without the experimentation.  So now Church and all his A.I. buddies are back..  Also Omega.. and Sigma.. and would you look at that, we have two evil space pirates who would love to get some help killing the reds and blues.  Omega and Sigma team up with Felix and Locus, the reds and blues try to distribute six A.I. among eight humans, we get a huge number of new and potentially fun character interactions and relationships, and Charon gets to have a chance at recreating the Meta. The Meta was as close as any A.I. got to metastability and a metastable A.I. would be unique, so would be very valuable. This is foreshadowed by the chairman wanting Maine's helmet as a trophy, hinting at a deeper interest in the Meta and the A.I.  Of course, I might be wrong, seeing how this has nothing to do with the alien artifacts plot.. but I think it would be awesome.  *edit* last episode may have made me a bit less confident.. But I still think its possible."
RedvsBlue,35ify8,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Sun May 10 20:26:11 2015 UTC,I would just love to see Felix getting in an securement with Omega now. Or Grif arguing with Delta for that matter
RedvsBlue,35ify8,Tauva101,4,Sun May 10 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"I think Felix would get Sigma, since Sigma's all about the manipulation, and Felix is the charmer, while Locus is a lot more direct.  I imagine Grif and Simmons (the married couple) getting the twins. They argue about whose is better, try to make them compete, etc.  Caboose gets Delta, because he needs the help in logic+ Caboose got him before+ Caboose, Delta and Freckles makes the best team. Carolina gets Alpha/Church.  Not sure about Gamma and Theta.  I think Wash should definitely get one, since he's a trained freelancer. I think Theta would suit him, since he is trust and Wash's character arc was all about learning to trust again.  Leaving Gamma, who was a bit of a dick but was partnered with Wyoming, who was a dick, so he was kinda doing his job + Church was ok having him run inside Epsilon unlike Sigma and Omega.  I think Tucker maybe, since he's a focus of this trilogy. Plus he's rather unsure of himself, so having Gamma's cunning could be useful.  Which leaves Sarge without an A.I. and Donut wishing he had someone inside him.  I may or may not have written all that down just to make that joke."

He has always been reluctant to take them ever since epsilon tried to kill himself in his head. Even though he's grown as a person and learned to trust, I don't think he would let go of that bias, as it is such a part of his character.   That said, it would be a really interesting bit of character development for him if he were to attempt to get over it and start using AI units.  Personally I am torn with Tucker's AI. I really think him having Theta would be interesting, because he had already had to deal with a child and is pretty caring when it all comes down to it. They would be a pretty good team. Him and Gamma however could be a very interesting pair, especially due to their encounters in the past (end of season 5, the battle with Wyoming)."
RedvsBlue,35ify8,Hanpwolf,1 point,Mon May 11 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"Iirc, Wash exaggerated when he said he'd never use an a.I. because he knew he couldn't keep the fact he knew about Alpha being tortured a secret from an a.I. sharing his mind. Also, he wanted to become a recovery agent, and saying he would never use an a.I. was the easiest way to make them believe he could be trusted to not steal equipment for himself. Hence why he has Church with him at the end of season 6.  Perhaps he is truly a bit reluctant, but I don't think its as bad as you might think."
RedvsBlue,35ify8,PrinceCheddar,3,Mon May 11 05:44:24 2015 UTC,"I'm siding with the other side on this one. I think Tucker would end up with Theta because it's show another side of his personality they is hinted at being there, but just hasn't been explored yet.

RedvsBlue,35ify8,JacksonSX35,1 point,Mon May 11 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Tucker having Theta makes sense because it can show him growing more as a character. Gamma and Tucker would probably be a comedic duo."

It pissed me off a bit when a freaking EMP took them down despite the circumstances. So a thought I had was, what if the AI taken down by the EMP weren't destroyed, dead, etc, but dormant? Like it shut them down until something could reactivate them? I say this because in the trailer Epsilon/Church said he died. Well I doubt there gonna kill off Church cause he's died like 20 times now, so if Epsilon goes maybe Alpha comes back?

One of the things I love about RvB is how its so distant but so connected to Halo at the same time. You definitely don't need Halo knowledge to enjoy the show as they take everything and put their own twist on it (AIs, Aliens etc).   Personally I absolutely love Halo and got into RvB because of that love, I enjoy seeing people who got into Halo through RvB and people who got into RvB for the sake of it."

Never played much of the Halo sequels, since they were Xbox exclusive (boo!!!).  But as others have said, you really don't need any of that to enjoy RvB. They make up their own story as they go along, which I personally find more entertaining than the official Halo story."

I'm not an FPS player, really.  Caught RvB because /r/netflixbestof mentioned it and I was in a really bad spot in life, ready for anything entertaining to distract me from my troubles (family health problems, awful job that prevented me from sleeping, boss who gave me several years of first hand experience with abusive interpersonal relationships). Believe it or not, I liked the campy silliness but I loved the lessons learned. RvB and the PF saga helped me understand that the boss, who I took at the time to be an excellent mentor and teacher, was really more like the Director, bending others to do what he wanted them to do with no real intent of meaning well for those people. There was other stuff too but that's one example.  All those issues are history now and RvB, stupid as it is, helped me solve my problems and make life better."

I love them both for very different reasons, although I probably love RVB a bit more. In fact whenever they do throw in a Halo reference it's downright jarring for me. I had to take a minute to even register why you phrased the title of this post the way you did. So, even though I do regularly play Halo and have delved into the expanded universe and even occasional fanfiction, I think I functionally fall into the category you're talking about. I almost never think of either in the context of the other, and in my mind RVB wasn't really based on any previous fiction."

On an internal level, Locus knows killing and all that he does is wrong so he tells himself it's not really him pulling the trigger. It's whoever is calling the shots and he's just their weapon. He copes by taking all responsibility out of the equation but I wouldn't say he enjoys or gets a kick out of killing. He tries to feel nothing at all toward it."

RedvsBlue,355li8,infernal_llamas,16,Thu May 7 08:25:40 2015 UTC,"The majority of the time that they mention ""x number of years"" it is reference to the show's run, not the actual passage of time. (Like in that PSA)  There are typically only a few months in between seasons, as is the case with 10-11-12-13. The only large leaps are the years between PFL + S1 and the year between S5 + Recon.   But there is no established timeline (as in actual dates).  Time (and location) is very much a mystery in RvB, and this is likely because it isn't meant to fit directly into the Halo canon."
RedvsBlue,355li8,TaylorCulosis,9,Thu May 7 08:36:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Dates stated in the PSAs are references to the RL years the show has been on, not the in-universe dates. During PSAs we are watching the ""actors"" of Sarge and Church and everyone rather than the ""characters"" they play."
RedvsBlue,355li8,VegetaLF7,9,Thu May 7 15:12:06 2015 UTC,"Do not stare too far into the abyss, for it shall consume you. Escape while you yet can! The search for enlightenment regarding RvB's timeline is nigh onto that for wisdom regarding AI Math--it is a futile endeavor doomed to failure and madness.  cough  Seriously, though, the timeline is confusing, and various statements made about it in the show itself are somewhat contradictory. I have a whole elaborate document written up on the subject, complete with multicolored arrows and lots of question marks.  tl;dr of the below: It's a mess, if a character says anything about a date, ignore it immediately. There is no way to reconcile the timeline, so don't try (unless you're crazy like me).    There are very few solid assertions about the date in the show itself. It's stated by a couple of different people that the first five seasons took about three years (Grif, Tucker, and Simmons all say this in season 5). Church was stationed at the outpost in Reconstruction for 14 months, although we don't know exactly how long passed between the end of season 5 and everybody being relocated. Finally, Reconstruction is supposed to take place ""Post-War Year 1"" and Recreation's trailer takes place ""Post War Year 1.25"".  Now, if we assume that Halo canon applies here, the ""war"" is surely the Human-Covenant War, which ended in early 2553. This means that Reconstruction takes place 2553/2554, and Season 1 must have begun in roughly 2549 (2553 - 14 months between seasons 5 and 6 - 3 years of BGC = 2549).  (As an interesting aside, this means Alpha almost certainly was created before Cortana, because she was only created in November 2549, and Alpha definitely existed prior to that point.)  The real problems arise when we try to move forward past Reconstruction. It begins ""Post-War Year 1.25"", okay, so probably 2554ish. But past that point, we have practically no indication of how much time has passed at all. Tucker says in the first episode of Revelation that they've been fighting for ""like eight years"", but that doesn't make sense. (By Recreation, only about 4 and a half years have passed since season 1 started (3 years + 14 months + 0.25 years between Reconstruction and Recreation), which means that Recreation would have to take three and a half years for Tucker to be right.)  And then we've got the picture of Junior from the last episode... which implies Junior is in fifth grade, which if he developed like a human would mean he's ten years old... it's a headache!  At any rate, don't listen to what the characters say, because they crazy. PSAs in particular always reference how many years the show has been running, not how many years have passed within the show.  EDIT: Oh, and definitely don't try to make it match up with Halo canon, because then you're just asking for an aneurysm."
RedvsBlue,355li8,alynnidalar,1 point,Thu May 7 14:07:08 2015 UTC,Don't they say in S1E1 that Master Cheif has already destroyed the covenent armada? And that's why they're stationed at bludgulch rather than actually fighting.
RedvsBlue,355li8,thedankbank1021,2,Fri May 8 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that line in particular, you really can't try to incorporate into the timeline, because it contradicts just about everything. It implies that season 1 begins after Halo 1, but Halo 1 takes place in 2552, with the war ending the next year. Which totally contradicts the interpretation that Reconstruction takes place in 2553/2554, four years after the beginning of Season 1!"

And for the boring explanation, RVB isn't halo cannon and don't need to strictly adhere to all the rules the halo universe has set. So the whole rampancy after 7 years thing is something they can choose not to do.  Also the PSA's aren't cannon,  nothing that is said should be taken seriously."
RedvsBlue,355li8,TodtheT1000,2,Thu May 7 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"I mentioned the rampancy becasue they mentioned it in the freelancer saga, and the meta was trying to avoid rampancy by collecting all the fragments, or something?"
RedvsBlue,355li8,ibbolia,2,Thu May 7 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"The Meta was attempting to outlast rampancy by becoming metastable. The short version of that is most (all but 2 or 3, depends who you ask) AI in Halo/RvB that can go rampant don't get past stage 3: the ""Kill everything forever"" stage. That stage is mostly filled with the AI is just reliving memories or scenarios similar to PTSD in an effort to get rid of useless data, just while attached to something that will kill humans(Maine's armor, Halo Arrays, etc). Sigma tried to find the combination of fragments that would last against rampancy long enough to not self destruct by having them work sort of against each other's insanity, forming the Meta."
RedvsBlue,355li8,astalavista114,3,Thu May 7 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"Also, if Epsilon needed to go Metastable, it could've just remember the right fragments"
RedvsBlue,355li8,TodtheT1000,2,Thu May 7 20:59:53 2015 UTC,You're thinking of metastability.
RedvsBlue,355li8,swi7ch64,-1,Thu May 7 17:47:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure all the AI in the RvB universe have already gone rampant. Considering how they were made and all plus if you wanna take some of the halo lore in to it; one book describes rampintce as emotions taking over the core logic and removing safeties that kept the AI from thinking itself to death.  May or may not have all that right but I am still sure church was rampant before season one.
RedvsBlue,355li8,alynnidalar,1 point,Fri May 8 00:02:35 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. A rampant AI is basically nonfunctional--none of the AIs in the series have been shown to act like that. And it's still unclear whether fragments can even go rampant in the first place.  Alpha in the BGC and Reconstruction had very few issues, there's no way you could interpret him as rampant. Rampancy is like power hungry, information hungry, murder-everyone-around-them--that's not what Alpha was like at all."
RedvsBlue,355li8,xFlyersFan94x,2,Fri May 8 12:42:07 2015 UTC,the PSA aren't really apart of the main story line.

PSA's especially, but even the series risks fucking with people's perception of the timeline for a joke (I.E. Tucker's 'we've been fighting for like eight years' joke in season 8). The actual timeline there is definitely not 8 years (unless a REALLY long time passed between season 5 and 6), but is also never clearly established and left up to speculation."

I beleive he is rampent, and has reached the theoretical state of metastabilty. Also, (Possible spoilers?)  It was mentioned at the end of the Season 13 Trailer that ""This is, of course... the story of how I died."" Leading me to beleive that thw phrase is either in reference to the Director, OR possibly Epsilon himself...  The reason I say the director, BTW, is simply because he states that he has a set of databases labeled 1-13 (in accordance to the different seasons of the show) which could simply (and in my opinion... hopefully...) be just a reference to when the director dies. Or, at least, when it is implied that he dies, as he shut down the facility and kept a pistol for himself... so it is very well possible that he could be experiencing the end of rampency shortly. :P"

RedvsBlue,34zzgo,Animated95,1 point,Wed May 6 21:01:11 2015 UTC,Who ever said it was Project Freelancer that obliterated an entire state?   Maybe it was a natural disaster. Which is what I was aiming for.
RedvsBlue,34zzgo,CommanderLoco,1 point,Wed May 6 21:04:32 2015 UTC,A natural disaster destroys the state of Florida the same time PF takes agent Florida off their rooster. That's WAY too much of a coincidence. It's shown in Season 10 that the Director and Counselor sent Flowers to Blood Gulch along with Alpha
RedvsBlue,34zzgo,Animated95,15,Thu May 7 02:58:26 2015 UTC,At the end of Season 10 there's a screen in the background with an animation of the State being destroyed.  That's the most confirmation we get.
RedvsBlue,34zzgo,ElRay0707,10,Wed May 6 01:37:51 2015 UTC,That was probably just a way of symbolizing Florida/Flowers disappearing from the Freelancer roster. Not literally the state being destroyed.
RedvsBlue,34zzgo,Dudefrommars,7,Wed May 6 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"There's no good explanation I can think of for either option.That scene in season 10 really does imply that they destroy the state. The Director says people will wonder what happened to Florida, the Counsellor says leave it all to me, and there's immediately a shot of the state with red pulsing markers on it before it breaks away and shatters. Maybe it's just a metaphor, but neither character is looking at the screen. There's not much point in using a graphic to enhance your point if no one is looking at it. And we do know that Florida is gone from the United States, and that something bad caused that. It's a hell of a coincidence if the agent they wanted to send to blood gulch happened to share a name with the one state that's been (presumably) destroyed.  Having said that, destroying the state doesn't solve the problem of people wondering about Florida. It's not as though they wiped Florida from history; people will remember that the state existed. And the other Freelancers will remember that the agent existed.  All in all, I'd guess that the shot was meant to just be a simple joke at the end of a fairly serious season. Because if Project Freelancer can destroy chunks of Earth, then their power really isn't shown well at any other time."
RedvsBlue,34zzgo,loony123,1 point,Wed May 6 06:32:39 2015 UTC,Could it be possible Florida sunk due to climate change reasons?

RedvsBlue,34zzgo,Donbuster,3,Wed May 6 14:43:03 2015 UTC,Maybe the state was disowned by the US or the UNSC for somereason. Or maybe the aliens glassed it.

RedvsBlue,34zzgo,Animated95,3,Tue May 12 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"My assumption is that since Carolina covered two states as one Freelancer, the project must have had to account for that by including another territory, most likely DC."

RedvsBlue,34zzgo,Animated95,1 point,Wed May 6 13:40:26 2015 UTC,"But saying that the graphic means nothing also doesn't make sense. Freelancer is good at covering its tracks. I see it as backstory to the joke, via hijacking of UNSC ordinance, as we know PFL wasn't the most virtuous of PMC's."

Tucker probably interpreted the state of Florida being destroyed since, as naive_dreamer said, he understandably didn't know much about PF. While at the same time Tex thought Tucker was referring to the Freelancer. Maybe she thought Church told Tucker several things about Project Freelancer, as it's shown he has, and assumed Tucker knew of the agent's death.  Tucker thought Tex was talking about the state of Florida being gone; Tex assumed Tucker knew of agent Florida's death. Just trying to make sense of it."

If I remember correctly, the last time they worked together was when Carolina was tracking down the Director, forcing Wash -- who she probably remembered as comic relief from his days in Project Freelancer -- to play second fiddle.   This new Washington, more assured, more confident and more in-charge than she's ever seen him, might have thrown her for a loop."

I like the idea of her and Washington going up against each other, with the Counselor smugly observing that his psychological understanding of Carolina is being confirmed; but then Carolina truly does get past that problem because she's a very different person from her days as a Freelancer, and that is ultimately what helps her (and the team) defeat Charon Industries and settles the conflict on Chorus."

There's been multiple hints that Tucker is black, and no hints that Tucker is white.

RedvsBlue,34qeal,alynnidalar,16,Mon May 4 12:59:52 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda worried about Carolina--that bit, coupled with the stuff that was mentioned by Epsilon last season, strongly implies she's not doing that hot. I guess it's healthier for her to be safe as opposed to suicidally overconfident like she was before, but it seems like she's losing confidence in herself, and that isn't gonna help her fight.  Or even (kind of a scarier idea) Epsilon having a bad effect on her. Not on purpose, I'm sure, but if his issues are bleeding over into her thoughts, that could be bad."
RedvsBlue,34qeal,atfsix,2,Mon May 4 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"She could be hit and forced out of the fight, forcing Wash to be paired with Church. Lots of potential storytelling options having Wash being reunited with his AI."

RedvsBlue,34qeal,LadWatcherIsHere,6,Mon May 4 00:10:20 2015 UTC,And let's not forget that Tucker is a hero. He probably got a huge payment for helping to take down the director. Junior has zero worries about getting proper education.

RedvsBlue,34qeal,J_Bear,0,Tue May 5 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that it wasn't Sharkface. They had a number of villians to choose from, Sleeveless or Girly would have been a better choice as they actually seemed to have been able to put up a fight against Wash/Carol. Sharkface turned up for one scene, got his face pulped by a Grav Hammer and then had a building collapse on him."
RedvsBlue,34qeal,Sickzaur,1 point,Tue May 5 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say that out of Sharkface, Sleeveless, and Girlie, two of whom died on-stage (Sharkface being assumed dead from the collapse), Sharkface seems like the best option."
RedvsBlue,34qeal,J_Bear,2,Tue May 5 23:44:09 2015 UTC,It's never confirmed that Sleeveless and Girly were actually killed though was it?   Sleeveless took one punch from Maine and the last scene was him lying on the floor minus a helmet. Girly fell about 2 storeys into the ocean.   Both of these sound far more plausible than Sharkface taking a Grav Hammer to the face and surviving the collapse.
RedvsBlue,34qeal,Sickzaur,3,Wed May 6 00:04:31 2015 UTC,"I would say that Maine tends to go for the kill. If they're still alive, though, I'd love to see as many of the insurrectionists as possible."

RedvsBlue,34qeal,hessdawg3113,2,Fri May 8 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"I would agree, but she fell directly into the water right after her back was broken. Unless they got to her very quickly, she is almost certainly dead."
RedvsBlue,34qeal,Jason_Wanderer,1 point,Fri May 8 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"It's less about plausibility and more about character.  Sharkface has history with Washington and Carolinia, the two freelancers that are still on the show.  Sleeveless had more to do with Maine than anyone else and Girly had little interaction with anyone in general.  Not to mention the fight with Sharkface actually lasted a bit, and Washington was able to comment on him directly.  Character-wise, Sharkface is the best option.  ~ Jason"

And the Stark-Ultron-Vision lineage could be considered similar to the Director-Alpha-Epsilon lineage, although that's not entirely new to the movie if you switch out Stark for Pym. Also, Wanda's power is similar to what Gamma did to Epsilon."
RedvsBlue,34omq1,forrestib,2,Sun May 3 03:28:43 2015 UTC,Ok these are a bit of a stretch. I'm a huge RvB fan but the circle shot was also done in the first Avengers and is something to expect from a movie as comic booky as AoU.
RedvsBlue,34omq1,009reloaded,2,Wed May 13 21:45:58 2015 UTC,I wasn't saying Ultron did it because they saw it in RVB. That movie would likely be almost identical if Rooster Teeth never existed. I was just pointing out things that they had both stolen in common.

RedvsBlue,3461uy,Monqueys,2,Wed Apr 29 06:11:06 2015 UTC,I absolutely love your armor. Why did you choose foam over paper? I always thought that papakura would be lighter? Is it easier to use foam and how long did it take? And one last question how did you paint it?
RedvsBlue,3461uy,JayLuvLL,3,Wed Apr 29 04:53:34 2015 UTC,"Foam is significantly lighter than Pepakura, as pep is fiberglass and very dense or hard, depending on the amount of reinforcement used. It's also non-flexible and non-breathable, so quite uncomfortable to use. That, combined with the difficulty of working with paper, card, fibreglass and resin, foam was the better choice for me.   EVA foam is way cheaper, very easy to use (only need a knife/scalpel and a hot glue gun), flexible, very durable, extremely comfortable and simple to learn from YouTube tutorials. It might not get as fine of details as casting or some types of pepakura, but it's up to the builder how much detail they put into it.   The base suit by itself, with the DMR and lights, took about 2 months working only at night and on weekends. I did it for PAX AUS in October last year. I can back-mount both rifles using high-power magnets, and switch them like in-game (demo here: https://youtu.be/shCR0ocrVtY). It also has a loudspeaker in the chest for playing music.   Since then, I've done loads of upgrades - a Halo 4 Sniper Rifle (now with a live-preview scope powered by a Raspberry Pi - see here: https://youtu.be/pr3T0s4BNyA), a push-to-talk microphone, casted-resin gloves, a hex pattern on the visor, and I'm midway through sewing silicone 3D hex panels onto the undersuit to give it depth.   EVA foam can be painted without cracking by first priming it with PVA glue, then spraying it with Plasti-Dip or Rustoleum Peelcoat (a spray-on rubber typically used for painting car wheels). Then, just use paint as per normal - I used Rustoleum 2X Paint+Primer.

RedvsBlue,346oe8,ChickadeeAce,1 point,Thu May 7 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"How long were they gone, if we assume that time passed normally and there was no massive jump forward?  And yet Church DID get blown into the past?  That seems pretty solid - he had to wait 1000 years for Gary to be able to send him through time back to Blood Gulch.  Also, what did Church tell Sheila after all his attempts to change history in Blood Gulch failed?  He asked her to do something for him, and then when he left she decided to shut down for a while to conserve energy.  But if they ever clarified what he asked her to do and how it affected the story once they made their ways back to BG, I haven't picked up on it."
RedvsBlue,346oe8,professionalecho,2,Thu May 7 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"Church was an AI, as was Gamma, and we know from s10 that Gamma ran fake scenarios to torture the Alpha, so it's possible he faked the wait.

RedvsBlue,346oe8,Zankou55,5,Tue Apr 28 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"Just a handwave to explain away the change from Halo 1 to Halo 2. A similar thing happens when Wash is sent to Blood Gulch in S6.

Both are a kind of middle ground, so they're as good as you can get to being impartial when negotiating. I guess Tucker got sent to the dig site because it was a joint alien/human effort.. then either all the humans except Tucker got replaced, and the aliens were didn't question it, or the aliens and the humans we saw replaced a previous group of humans and aliens."

RedvsBlue,33ftof,Bacon_Falcon,5,Wed Apr 22 04:15:53 2015 UTC,"York, Maine, CT, both Dakotas, Wyoming, Florida, and Georgia are all dead so far as we know. Wyoming could theoretically still be alive (he made a bunch of copies of himself in the S5 finale, it is certainly possible one slipped away), and Maine may have survived the fall at the end of S8 (although I suspect he didn't, and his helmet appearing in S12 was confirmation of his death, not survival). Tex is deleted as of now, but both the original Beta and all of the subsequent ones the Director created could be salvaged, meaning Tex could be ""alive."" I doubt any freelancers will return in S12 (unless the guy we think is Sharkface is actually someone else), but I think there exists a possibility that Wyoming or Maine stages a comeback after the Chorus Trilogy ends.  Epsilon is the only AI we know is still alive. Every other one was, presumably, wiped out by the EMP in S6. That said, two possibilities exist. One: the EMP didn't completely delete them, making them recoverable. Two: during his quest to re-create Allison/Tex, the Director created more of the fragments - another copy of any of the AI, which could have then been taken by the UNSC after the events in S10, similarly to FILSS. I'd say the second is the most likely way AI will be reintroduced, as sort of ""dark mirror"" versions of those memories constructed by Epsilon we daw in S12E11. That's just a theory, though."

RedvsBlue,33d3xc,-SpaceCommunist-,17,Tue May 19 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"I suspect that Flowers was the one supposed to find the sword instead of Tucker; this is because I also suspect that the sword does not activate for only one host, but rather whoever is wearing Flowers' armor at the time. From that, I doubt the Freelancers ever suspected any of the Aliens themselves to be involved in the simulation, hence Omega being shocked to see one at the end of Season 3 and Wyoming killing Crunchbite at the first opportunity he had. It is likely from there that Wyoming, Omega, Vic, and later Flowers conspired to use the pregnancy of Tucker as a means to capture Tex and the unexpected alien in a single stroke.  This, of course, doesn't explain the appearance of the Green Alien that revived Flowers. It may have been mere coincidence, but I wrote a while back on /r/fantheories that it might have been Agent Georgia using some kind of Space-based alternative/counterpart to Wyoming's Temporal Distortion Unit. It would make sense, as we never got any distinct closure as to Georgia's supposed death; what's more, both the Green Alien and Georgia share the same armour colour, as revealed in the after-credits of Season 10's DVD. Further still, a random Alien would have no reason to revive Flowers, whereas a Freelancer colleague would instinctively help a teammate out of a locked-down suit. All of this is conjecture, of course; once again, it could just be that a random alien came across the body of Flowers.  TL;DR: Flowers was supposed to get the sword. There were never supposed to be Aliens, so Wyoming and friends used Junior as a means to capture Tex. Also, the Green Alien may have been Georgia disguised as an Alien using some sort of Spacial Distortion Unit similar to Wyoming's equipment.  EDIT: I found the thread from /r/fantheories detailing my theory on Agent Georgia. Feel free to check it out."
RedvsBlue,33d3xc,DudeMcBraski,8,Tue Apr 21 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe Tucker having Florida's armor is why he knew that Church was actually an AI and not a ghost (he says so in Season 7).

The way I see it, there are very few possibilities, none of which have any real evidence.  • A Wyoming clone may have survived and shot Flowers before the latter could presumably reveal the truth about Project Freelancer to Tucker. I doubt it, however, as there were multiple missed shots beforehand, yet Wyoming was known as an excellent marksman; not only that, but the supposed last of the Wyoming clones was killed by Tex at the beginning of the episode.  • A time-traveling Church. The missed shots imply it was the cobalt-coloured AI, but seeing as Church was sent into the past and not the future, this is highly unlikely. The only exception to this was Yellow Church, who presumably got stuck in Caboose's mind before the bomb went off in Season 3.  • The present Church. Again, the missed shots imply it was him, but why he would kill Flowers is unknown. Plus, he was probably too busy trying to stop Tex from leaving with Junior to bother with Flowers.  • Tex, though the missed shots make this unlikely. Along with that, it would be counterintuitive to kill a Freelancer that was about to reveal the truth to the Blues. That, and she was probably too busy going after Omega to care about Florida."

That way if anyone noticed, say, a freelancer's recovery beacon, they can check the files and see they are in ""scenario x"" and disregard it.  Project Freelancer was probably writing all that stuff as it was happening.  For all intents and purposes what we see in the Blood Gulch Chronicles is actually the recorded data of Project Freelancer.  From who? One can assume they always had someone watching Blood Gulch, who is the same person that killed Flowers for attempting to reveal the truth.  Want to hear a crazy theory?  What if Epsilon killed Flowers and all those ""scenarios"" are Epsilon's files that were referred to in the Season 13 trailer. With the aliens back, maybe time travel will be used again (this time in a serious way however). How else would Project Freelancer know exactly what happened unless someone who was there recorded it? Epsilon may get caught in some temporal time anomaly causing him to go back in time to the first episode.  This would be the ""death"" he refers to in the trailer.    By being there he then initiates the events of Red vs Blue by acting behind the scenes (i.e. Killing Flowers).   This whole thing might come full circle with all the story-lines connecting...  Or maybe it's just late and I'm insane.  ~ Jason"
RedvsBlue,33d3xc,slocke200,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"My best theory is there is stuff that was meant to happen and stuff that wasnt. as in anything with tex in it wasnt meant to happen as tex was a fugitive of project freelancer tecnically. so omega was never meant to be in the canon so maybe anything that took them out of the cannon wasnt sim trooper stuff? like going after a deadly AI is something wash should be doing but they do it. then they are in another base for a while with Gamma another AI that they shouldnt be dealing with. what im thinking is that yes there is scenarios they want them to play out like oh we have you pinned its your turn to surrender(which actually sounds like a training simulation), except from that VIC just wrote down what he was told by red and blue team and Scenario 3 is just the paperwork"
RedvsBlue,33d3xc,Aruseus493,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:17:57 2015 UTC,"It mostly has to do with the poor writing coming back to bite them. Frankly, they shouldn't even have wrote Scenario 3 as a freaking scenario. A lot of stuff from Seasons 1 to 5 can be considered canon and then they decided to just write all of it away under the idea of a scenario which just caused them to have to back track here."

RedvsBlue,33eccc,TaylorCulosis,3,Wed Apr 22 02:49:37 2015 UTC,He's a sharpshooter. A good shot.
RedvsBlue,33eccc,chimney3,2,Wed Apr 22 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"After the scene with the Pelican, I can go with this answer."
RedvsBlue,33eccc,PrinceCheddar,2,Wed Apr 22 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"Isn't Wyoming a sniper AKA sharpshooter? Hence why his symbol is a cross-hair. http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/rvb/images/2/28/Director_looking_at_Freelancer_List.png/revision/latest?cb=20120121112604  Strange North is considered an infiltration expert rather than a sniper also. From what we saw, it was as though South did all the infiltrating, while North stayed back and kept an eye on things as a sniper. I think Wash even said that North was the sniper in season 11.  I always thought Wash's battle-rifle meant he was more a mid-ranged combatant. Not a long ranged combatant like a sniper, not a close range fighter like Maine with his strength or Carolina with her martial arts. This shows how Wash doesn't really have a specialty, he's more a jack of all trades. Passable at everything, ( wasn't he going to replace York as lockpicking after getting exploded) and so is versatile, but compared to the others he doesn't excel at any one thing, making him seem less interesting. Hence why, when talking about the rest of his team to Tucker in season 11, all he can say that is notable about himself is the time he made a fool of himself in training."

I was just explaining what larger significance I think the symbol meant.  I always thought it like the difference between a sniper and a fast-draw artist. Both require skills at aiming but apply them differently. But I guess with A.I. assistance you can be a quick-draw sniper."

Wyoming seems to be more of a traditional sniper though, where he focuses more on his rifle skills; while North is more of a tactical sniper, meaning that he is very good with his weapon, but he also utilizes other weapons and technologies to help in battle.  This is shown when he throws his bubble shield to contain the enemy snipers on the rooftop when they're hunting for C.T.."

RedvsBlue,33a5ww,BellTheMan,9,Mon Apr 20 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"A point I'd like to make. You say Alpha had the exact same personality as the Director. I think not, since when we briefly saw him in season.. 9, I think, before he'd even been tortured, he was being played by Burnie rather than the Director's voice actor.  I think Alpha's personality has always reflected the Director's mind before the Director lost Allison, because Alpha had his Allison, Beta. He had the memories of the Director losing his Allison, but didn't experience it first hand. So, Church reflects the Director's mind back before the tragedy had changed him in to the professional we see heading Project Freelancer, who surrounded himself with work to distract himself from his grief.  Even if he hadn't, the effect of the torture, which includes causing Church to forget everything that had happened, and leaving him believing he was human with an alive (ex?)girlfriend, should have made it so his personality was different to the Director's, so the Church has had a different personality since the moment we met him.  Just my opinion."
RedvsBlue,33a5ww,PrinceCheddar,3,Tue Apr 21 08:39:01 2015 UTC,"Epsilon and Alpha have some pretty distinctive traits that set them apart, though. Alpha was an angry prick and Epsilon is an arrogant prick."
RedvsBlue,33a5ww,Rogan_McFlubbin,2,Tue Apr 21 02:33:45 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Caboose spent a lot of time telling Epsilon everything that happened to Alpha Church, which is how he retains the memories of Alpha Church even though he was already separated much earlier in the story.  Then he somehow transfers Epsilon from that device of his into a Forerunner Ancilla.  Caboose is a genius."
RedvsBlue,33a5ww,ProbeEmperorblitz,6,Tue Apr 21 05:18:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Caboose was the source of Epsilon's memories of being Alpha. I think it was when Epsilon and Alpha were in the same room in season 6. Alpha was getting memories, and experiencing pain, from Epsilon. I think at that time, Epsilon was taking copies of memories from Alpha. A two way exchange of information.  But, until Caboose talked about their adventures, those memories were in a storm of memories of different A.I. fragments. All acting independently, all fighting to have some aspect of control. Complete chaos.  Caboose talking to Epsilon, telling him about what Church had done, gave the memories of Church something to latch on to. It gave those memories something to focus on, allowing the memories to gain order, until Church to become the primary personality of the Epsilon A.I.   So Epsilon does have all the memories of Alpha, except for the few moments before the EMP, so treating him as Church is a lot more reasonable than all his memories being second hand from Caboose."

That isn't to say there wasn't a lot of manipulation though."
RedvsBlue,33bawm,Conor_S,11,Tue Apr 21 03:41:06 2015 UTC,This. And when Sigma was gone Maine was desperate for the power he had lost.
RedvsBlue,33bawm,TodtheT1000,6,Tue Apr 21 04:42:26 2015 UTC,"The problem with this, however, is that we never see Maine transition into this state of ambition. Considering he took a bullet in the chest to save Carolina in Season 9, I can honestly say that, though brutish, he cared for his teammates. But all through Season 10, not once—not once—is Maine ever shown to be manipulated into becoming someone vying for power. All we ever see is Maine having a headache. That's it. Otherwise, we get absolutely nothing out of Maine showing his transition towards becoming the Meta. Sigma, sure; we see him desiring Metastability, we see him manipulate Carolina into getting two AI, we see him discover the process of fragmenting the Alpha. But Maine never gets any development at all. Aside from a measly headache, Maine gets nothing.  This is what irks me about Season 10; the writers spoke about how this is where we would see the fall of Maine, but we got nothing. I feel insulted, to say the least, that a character willing to risk their life by taking a bullet for a teammate can just turn into an evil bad guy because of a fucking headache. I mean, why? Why should a character like that never have their transition towards a state of evil be addressed?  What's more is that there is good reason Maine could have become the way he was. After all he did for PF, Maine was always given the short end of the stick. He's the toughest in the program, has survived almost everything thrown at him, risked his life on numerous situations (saving Carolina from the bullet, driving the Warthog to save York and Carolina after the building collapsed, fell several stories just to act as a counterbalance, being deployed to the Longshore Shipyards when his teammates couldn't handle the Insurrectionists, and so on), and y'know what he gets? He gets shot in the throat and can never speak again, and what does he get?   He's moved lower on the leaderboard.  If you had gone through all of what Maine had been through by that point and were placed lower on the leaderboard, you'd probably be pissed, too. And what does everyone else get? Everyone who gets dragged by a grappling hook to the codpiece (Wash), ruins the mission because of competitiveness (Carolina), and can't open locks—the job that they're on the team for (York), all of them get special equipment, AI, and top rankings on the leaderboard. Oh, sure, Maine got Sigma, but only because Carolina didn't like the AI, and she went ahead and got herself two more AI shortly after that.  All of this is goo reason to transform someone into an evil being; all Sigma needed to do is act on the hurt and humiliation he'd naturally feel after all this has transpired, and BAM! We'd have a great backstory for the Meta.  But what do we get? We don't get this complex backstory for the most popular villain of the show. Instead, we're given a fucking headache.  It's just insulting that even after being promised Maine's downfall, we're never given it, and we have to piece together our own explanations; ""Sigma controlled him!"", ""Maine wanted power!"", ""Maine just went insane after being with Sigma for too long!"", ""Maine turned evil because he always got the short end of the stick!"", etc.. Sometimes it's nice to be able to piece together a backstory for ourselves, but not when the season is a prequel meant to set up the events of earlier seasons, not when the character in question is celebrated as the most popular villain of the show, and not when we are promised this character's downfall."
RedvsBlue,33bawm,-SpaceCommunist-,3,Tue Apr 21 06:37:37 2015 UTC,"well York DID get the lock open, Wash did get his job on the ship done, and Carolina did recover the briefcase (though Tex got it first)"
RedvsBlue,33bawm,Forikorder,6,Thu Apr 23 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"Sigma had the plan for uniting the AI fragments.  He used Maine as a method of obtaining the fragments as he obviously couldn't.  To use Maine, he first drove him insane, then used the armor upgrades to bribe him.  After sigma and the other AIs were gone, Maine was just trying to get an AI so he could use his armor upgrades, not trying to unite the fragments.  Plus he was batshit crazy."

Maine was a good guy he got shot in the throat to save carolina and he got her AI and when that AI started messing with him he tried to go to the medical bay you see this but you know who wouldnt let him take it out the mother fucking director. Maine isnt a bad guy he was driven insane til he thouyght the only thing that mattered was getting as many AI as possible and anything else is expendable."

After getting repaired by Lopez, Sheila became more advanced, becoming more like a real person. I think Lopez is an oddity in the RvB world. Sarge is an idiot, so him being able to make an A.I. person without needing to base it on an existing human mind is funny, therefore allowed. An achievement in ignorance. When Lopez fixed Shelia, he fixed her too well, making her like him, much more advanced than the standard F.I.L.S.S.  I think the F.I.L.S.S the chairman has is most likely Sheila, with something done to her to make her obey, hence why she sounds so glum."
RedvsBlue,337ju6,PrinceCheddar,3,Mon Apr 20 08:41:56 2015 UTC,"She is an advanced computer program, but not as advanced as an A.I.  A possible reason as to why she was able to contain Gamma is that Gamma was just a fragment, while Sheila/FILSS is a complete program.  The fragments likely lose some capabilities and functionalities from being split form Alpha.  This is shown when Wash mentions ""Omega was the one that inherrited that ability(passing between suits).""  And when Tucker says, in Season 12, ""I thought only the Alpha could do that(possess other soldiers).""  FILSS is the porgram the Director made to run pretty much all parts of PFL, and it makes sense that they would use it for something like the Tank's training program, though it was likely put there to monitor the Reds and Blues and Alpha's progression."

RedvsBlue,333rgz,84981725891758912576,13,Sun Apr 19 06:11:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with your theory is that the fragments were pieces of Alpha, and with Epsilon, his memory removed, he wouldn't remember much/only have fragmented memories of PFL and the events that happened.  Epsilon was the last fragment to be harvested from Alpha, so it would have the memories of the other fragments that had already been harvested.  Also, towards the end of BGC, Omega possesses Church, but nothing happens, he even says ""No, I feel pretty much the same.""  That means that Omega was a piece of Church and therefor was unable to affect him.  Also, when Epsilon was recovered from ""Freelancer City,"" he was projecting memories out to Alpha, but it is unclear if he was able to absorb memories from Alpha too.  How else would he remember Blood Gultch and ""How things are supposed to be.""  Yes, Caboose told Epsilon stories, but those were only the starting points.  I think everyone mixes up Alpha, and Epsilon, because all of them, with the exception of Carolina, knew Church when he was Alpha, and to hear Church's voice and personality come from Epsilon, probably causes an idle confusion.  Hell, even Epsilon said it when he went into the memory unit ""Well in here, I guess I'm the Alpha.""  Lastly, as pointed out in Season 12, when Church takes over Grif, Tucker says ""I thought only the Alpha could do that.""  To which Church replies, ""Yeah, it's just another thing I picked up from one of my memory buddies... gah, it gives me a headache though.""  That last bit, ""...it gives me a headache..."" is a sign that he is not the Alpha, because Alpha never showed any issue or negative side effects when he took control of someone."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,Simusar,-1,Sun Apr 19 10:12:15 2015 UTC,"I concede that it makes sense for Epsilon to remember the other AI, but it makes absolutely zero sense to me that they would appear in the ""real world"" and not just AI world. Him changing into all the AI when speaking about the attributes is a sign, to me, that he has gained those attributes back. In fact, you can almost pinpoint when he gets certain parts back. He gains his memories in s10e17. ""Carolina, I just remembered... everything."" He gains his rage in s10e18. ""You shot me through the head, you put a bomb in my gut, you killed me with my own damn tank, and that's just how we met."" He gains his trust in s12e19. ""Eh... I figured it was time to trust the guys again."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,Simusar,3,Sun Apr 19 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"Epsilon is the Alpha's memory, so he is a sort of ""prodigal son"" of Alpha.  The other AI fragments never show up in the 'real world'.  The only time we saw the other fragments was when Epsilon increased his perception of time.  Even Delta says ""I am just a memory of Delta.""  The other fragments aren't really there, they just exist as a memory.  Being that Epsilon is Alpha's memory, and that he contains the memories of the other AI fragments, he is the closest thing to a ""Full AI"" that is left of PFL.  Besides, Church(Alpha) demonstrated Rage and Trust without knowledge of those two fragments existing.  He also lied, without having Gama, and manipulated others without Sigma.  The fragments weren't exclusive to the emotion they represented; Delta lied, he demonstrated his ""Caring Algorithyms,"" he even manipulated Wash into killing South.  As a computer program, Epsilon can appear in whatever color, shape, size, he wants.  He chooses the light blue armor for the same reason he always has a sniper rifle, that's what he's comfortable with.  I think what you may not be understanding is that, when Epsilon was harvested, it was already in the process of breaking down, similar to Alpha, and his versions of the other memory fragments is likely his way of controlling the fragmentation process that had happened to Alpha."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,Simusar,0,Mon Apr 20 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"They do appear in the real world, s10e22 and s12e16. My theory would mean that Epsilon was the one in Blood Gulch, and those fragmented AI are capable of using emotions other than their own. The point is that the Alpha wouldn't have any of those emotions, and would be just an emotion-free rock, which is an eerily similar description of how ""Epsilon"" was in s7. Also, Tex reveals in s8 that when she broke into the facility to save Alpha, he was an emotionless being that didn't remember her at all."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,Simusar,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:13:02 2015 UTC,"Epsilon chainging his appearance and voice isn't the other fragments appearing.  When Caboose brought the memory unit to Sarge's holographic simulation room, Epsilon said ""We thought it would be best to appear in this form because from your stories we gathered that this was a form you trusted,"" when he showed up as Delta.  In season 12, only Epsilon saw the other fragments, noone else did.  This is similar to the last episode of 12, where Epsilon flashes green for a second and says ""Thanks D"".  If it was Epsilon that was sent to Blood Gultch, they why did it take so long for his memories to return to him?  Why did he have such flawed memories?  Why was the Church in Season 12 less capable of possessing someone than the Church in the first 5 seasons?  Lastly, there's only one time that, to my memory, anyone calls Epsilon Alpha, and that is Carolina at the end of Season 9 when she says ""You're going to help me kill the Director.""  Other than that, everyone calls him either Epsilon or Church, even Caboose."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,bornmadness42,-1,Mon Apr 20 03:29:47 2015 UTC,"In s12e16 Tucker walks up to Carolina and asks to speak with Church. Church appears, talking with Delta and Theta. Theta says ""just say you're sorry"". This not him appearing as one of them, it is him talking to one of them, in the real world. Epsilon in BG had fine memories, in fact, he was able to tell everyone about Freelancer with amazing accuracy. The Alpha in s7 has awful memory because its memories were taken from it. The Church is s12 only possesses someone once, and that was when he possessed Grif. He took full control of Grif, and had no voice distortion whatsoever. It doesn't make sense that Epsilon would be able to do it with no voice distortion, as the supposed ""memory buddy"" was only able to influence their actions, not take full control. My theory includes the fact that literally no one knows that Church is actually Alpha, including the Director, or Alpha himself."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,bornmadness42,2,Mon Apr 20 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"As a computer program that can control his appearance, it is believable that he could holographically project pretty much whatever he wants, including Theta and Delta.  Alpha isn't in season 7.  Epsilon had horrible memory because he had been deactivated in storage  for years.  This is supposed to be similar to a human going into statis for years and having to regain their memories over time.  Church in 12 says, about his possession ability, ""It's something I picked up from one of my memory buddies... gah... it gives me a headache though.""  That headache part is the area that Alpha excelled at more than Epsilon.  Alpha never got headaches when he possessed someone.  As for the voice distortion thing, that was stated by RT that they decided to drop it after the second time.  The reason the people Omega possessed still had their voices altered was to make it more obvious who was possessed because we didn't see Omega run into their bodies, the same way that Alpha, Beta, and Epsilon do it.  If noone knows it, then there is no way to prove your theory is right.  But the story so far, lends heavily to the ""theory"" that the current version of Church is Epsilon, not Alpha.  And that Alpha died in the EMP fighting the Meta."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,MichaelP578,-1,Mon Apr 20 07:15:36 2015 UTC,"It's possible that Epsilon inherited the trait to switch bodies, and was able to move around in s1 without headaches because he was not a full AI, and wasn't undergoing rampancy. IMO, the reason for those headaches is because Church in Chorus is undergoing rampancy, and it is almost impossible for a fragment to undergo rampancy. Even with the Omega thing, Omega was never capable of fully controlling the person who he was projecting's actions. He was able to influence them into (to quote the Director) ""take more direct measures."" Everyone who was possessed by Omega just went further in order to complete their goals. Caboose wanted to kill Tucker in order to become Church's  best friend, Simmons wanted to kill Sarge to become the leader of Red Team, Grif just wanted to sleep. I believe that there will be some sort of revelation where they find out that the new Church is actually Alpha."
RedvsBlue,333rgz,bornmadness42,3,Mon Apr 20 07:25:58 2015 UTC,"Its a good theory, however just a slight counter point to discuss, the bit with AIChurch talking to the director at the end of season 10, epsilon has memories of each of the other AIs and is able to impersonate them. If you remember when the MonitorChurch is down in the minefield in the dessert Delta is able to speak to the guys only while MonitorChruch is passed out. This fits your theory is it sort of makes sense that 'how could delta speak to the guys if the Monitor is passed out, unless it's different sides of Alpha' but you could also consider it that as Episilon is the memory unit of the fragments, the memories of the other AIs are so strong that they almost have their own personalities and a slight level of control. I know its a bit rubbish of me to present arguments both ways but I like your theory so I'm trying to discuss instead of argue :)"

RedvsBlue,333ld0,ericph9,20,Sun Apr 19 05:21:06 2015 UTC,Season 11 goes back to when RvB was more comedy based than plot and only gets serious towards the end.

RedvsBlue,333ld0,mrhairybolo,3,Mon Apr 20 00:05:09 2015 UTC,Naw it's really good. If you consider season 10 the end you're really missing out. Season 11 isn't that good but it was set up for season 12-13 which have been amazing.

RedvsBlue,333ld0,AMeowingCat,2,Sun Apr 19 09:03:56 2015 UTC,Wasn't the freelancer arc effectively 4 seasons? (6 through 10) while we've only had two of the chorus arc and that's dragging?

RedvsBlue,32vhih,SaintEverton,3,Fri Apr 17 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"I think what they meant was Allison's memory was so strong to the director and her death was so devastating that when the alpha was created he had to shed her memory instantly to maintain sanity, much like how the other fragments were created, but without any manipulation by the director. That memory became Beta, the first of the AI fragments."

So, first thing - Tex/Beta is not part of the alpha per se, she is a byproduct. Not part of Alpha though, very different.  Now regarding your questions, I think Omega is in Tex's helmet and not implanted in her, for 2 reasons; 1)Omega can jump between people, which makes me think he's not permanently (or at least semi-permanently) implanted in Tex, and 2)Tex mentions how she's ""blocked him off for a couple days"" in the Freelancer Saga - something which I think would be easier for her to do if he's just in her helmet. This is just speculation though. I don't think it's actually properly addressed anywhere in the series - or if it is I forgot (sorry).  Also,   O'malley wasn't able to jump into church due to the fact that there was already an AI occupying the body   Nope, O'Mally/Omega was able to jump into Church and did for a short time. The only big thing there was that it didn't really effect Church that much. Omega and Church shared a body for a very brief time. Episode 100, actually.   We don't actually know that Tex is in control of her body   Actually, Tex is more likely to remain in control than other people when 'possessed' (sharing a body with) Omega because she's an AI and not a person."
RedvsBlue,32vhih,Forikorder,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"In regard to the Beta/Tex argument, I direct you to the next set of comments in this thread.   The jumping is a trait that omega only possesses in the blood gulch chronicles, so we don't know his status in the freelancer saga.  But Sigma also has this ability since he could Watch Dogs his way into the security camera when the director told him to log off, so I'm not sure if all of the fragments have this, but I doubt it because epsilon always has to stay within a certain distance of Carolina while he's in her storage unit instead of just jumping into Tucker or Caboose to talk to them. If all of the AI fragments have this ability, what's keeping them from just switching off between the different freelancers during battle to help whoever needs them most? Is it because they are in they are in the implants rather than being In the storage units?"
RedvsBlue,32vhih,Forikorder,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm..that would make sense to me; that the AI's that have been implanted can't 'jump' but the AI's that are in storage can come and go. I'm not sure how Sigma could sneak his way into the security camera, though. Or maybe because Alpha/OriginalChurch, Omega, and Beta are all 'strong' AI's (remember the AI's that came first are the strongest...and Alpha, Beta, and Omega were some of the first AI's) they have the strength to jump, but weaker AI's can't? Again, I'm kinda theorizing here, because it's not really explicitly explained anywhere in the series."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,Chaos_Construct,22,Thu Apr 16 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"Probably. She probably knew about her mother, either memories from her childhood or (if Allison died before Carolina was old enough to remember her) from other people. The line she says about her mother at the end of season 10 suggests first hand experience.  But she probably didn't suspect Tex to be an A.I. based on her father's memories of her mother while a part of PF. Who would? Tex most likely wasn't an accurate duplication of the original, Tex was just what the Director thought of Allison, and may not have reflected her actual personality.  I think both Tex and Alpha represent the people they were when they were younger. Allison before settling down with Leonard and growing into a mature adult, capable of a military career, Leonard before the grief over the death of Allison sent him to dive deep into his work with artificial intelligence.  After coming back in season 10, she probably was made aware of the Tex/Alpha situation, and almost certainly does now Epsilon is sharing her mind. Even if they didn't discuss it, it's the sort of thing that she'd have to realize now they're so close. I doubt there are any secrets between them.  Tex was never her mother though, same way Alpha/Epsilon was never her father. Her relationship with Epsilon seems to mimic a sibling one, which fits how they're both ""creations"" of the director. I guess Tex would be her brother's girlfriend.. or.. I don't know.. it's weird."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,PrinceCheddar,6,Thu Apr 16 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"Tex was more of what alpha interpreted the directors memories of Allison to be, since she is also a fragment of alpha. She was the most painful memory that alpha had so much so that she was the first to become a fragment. So yes shes extremely inaccurate depiction of the original Allison because alpha interpreted memories of the director."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,Firebat12,5,Thu Apr 16 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"she wasnt a fragment, she was a full AI like Alpha they didnt have the alien device needed to create fragments"
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,Forikorder,3,Fri Apr 17 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"The way you explain doesn't feel right.  I don't think Alpha interpreted anything. Alpha and Beta were created simultaneously. The Director went though whatever the process is to create an A.I. based on a mind, and rather than just getting Alpha, the memories of Allison were so strong that they became an A.I. as well. It was the procedure that created Alpha that resulted in the second personality, not Alpha needing to jettison her.  The fragments were created by torturing Alpha until alternate personalities that could be harvested emerged. Alpha had to create them to remain sane. If Alpha had to create Tex to remain sane, then why is the director sane, seeing how he is unable to do this."

RedvsBlue,32uc7s,TheTjTerror,10,Fri Apr 17 04:22:05 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, Leonard and Allison met when they were young. Allison was most likely a bit of a rebel, who was violent and mean, while Leonard was most likely a bit of a nerd who thought she was a total badass.  They started dating, and Allison grew into a more mature adult. She joined the army, while Leonard was too useful an asset to become a soldier, and instead went into military research into A.I.s. They had a daughter.  Then, Allison died in combat. It was most likely not her fault, but due to the Director's memories of her, that painted her as a total badass, (think Master Chief) he couldn't come to terms of with her death. In his mind, something went wrong, she had to have messed up. The Allison he remembered was always so willful, that in his mind only Allison's own actions could account for her death. Allison wouldn't have allowed someone else's actions to result in her death.  Leonard becomes emotionally detached, focuses on his research, ostracizing his daughter. The memory of his wife haunting him, of how they were when they were young, making him focus on his work to distract himself.  Leonard goes through the A.I. creation process, creating an A.I. based on his own mind, but his is so fixated on the memories of Allison, of this Allison he believed in, not of the mother of his child but of the badass he fell in love with, that it creates this second A.I. that is all badass, but is destined for failure, just as the original was.  At least, that's how I see it."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,PrinceCheddar,3,Fri Apr 17 07:19:01 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting take on it. I always took it literally, like she actually did mess up or did something stupid. Never that it was actually just Leonard's thoughts of her. That being said, probably the line that most sticks in my head is when Tex is fighting Meta. Church says something like ""Don't you understand? She's built to fail. All she ever does is fail. It's how she's created. Don't you know what that's like?!"" to Wash. Then again, it also made me sad when I realized Church is actually dead. The Church we all stuck with for like 6 seasons.   Please excuse my tired rambling."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,TheTjTerror,9,Fri Apr 17 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"The actual quote begins: ""She died in her real life, and that's all the Director ever remembered of her. So now, no matter how tough she is, no matter how hard she fights, she's always going to fail, because that's what she's based on.""   Hence why I think her being based on the director's perception of Allison that matters.  The fact that she died was such a huge part of the memories for him that it became the focal point of Beta."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the quote. All in all, it's interesting how the dialogue can be interpreted in different ways."

RedvsBlue,32uc7s,PrinceCheddar,3,Fri Apr 17 06:38:05 2015 UTC,"i think your assuming a mind meld of a higher order then there is, i dont think either of them can literally read or even feel each others mind (which is why Carolina needed Epsilon to say something after her helmet got shot) so if one of them doesnt say it the other doesnt know it  Epsilon may plan to eventually tell Carolina everything he knows but that depends on  1) Carolina actually caring, she hasnt shown much interest in that sort of thing so far, her mother is a fond memory she may not want it to be tainted by finding out Tex is her mother  2) the mood, the middle of a war isnt exactly a good time to drop bombs like that  3) Epsilon even wanting to, Tex isnt really her mother, and telling her that doesnt solve any problems it would jsut hurt the both of them and bring up demons that may be best remain buried  Epsilon went through alot to learn to leave the past alone, and Carolina suffered alot by being under Texs shadow, even after Tex was dead, neither of them would be interested in bringing up the past when theyve finally gotten to the point where they can look to the future and do good without being chained by demons of there past"
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,Forikorder,3,Fri Apr 17 06:43:51 2015 UTC,"Wash lied to Project Freelancer because he knew he couldn't hide what he knew about the torture of the Alpha.

""You know I can see why you didn't want anyone else in your head. Got some pretty heavy stuff going on there. I think you need to talk to a professional.""  Church, in Wash's head, at the end of Reconstruction."
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,PrinceCheddar,0,Fri Apr 17 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"Church is different from the other AIs though so thats an invalid example that doesnt demonstrate a 2way street of information, it only shows that while Church is in someones head he can peek around  Wash lied because he was concerned about it, since he never really had an AI he didnt know for certain what theyd be able to find out if they got in his head"
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,Forikorder,3,Fri Apr 17 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"You can dismiss it as proof but it's still evidence. The fact that they both point to the same thing can't be dismissed, even if you assert that there COULD be problems with them.  Clearly A.I. and host effect each other. Omega completely overwhelmed his hosts with anger, and when Doc, the man who was a pacifist, became host there was so little anger in him that Omega became a silly cartoonish super villain. That's two ways. We saw the A.I.s exist within Caboose's mind, able to manipulate and interact with his subconscious, again two ways.  Regardless, Church and Carolina are close. They consider themselves siblings. I certainly think they would have talked about it, especially how much emotional baggage about Tex Carolina had before she added Epsilon to her armor.  Tex isn't some horrible memory for Church. ""I forget you"" was Church developing the peace of mind about Allison that the director never could. It was the director who had lost Allison, but Alpha always had Tex, and Epsilon had the Tex he made. That's most likely why Alpha seems younger and less cynical than the director, even before the torture messed with his head.  Regardless, the point is, Carolina most likely knows about Tex. It's too huge a plot point for her to just be completely ignorant.  She saw the Tex robots, she saw the Director, sad and pathetic, watching a video of her mother on loop.  Maybe she figured it out all herself, maybe she shared something with Epsilon. The main point is that she knows, regardless of the method. I just gave a potential explanation as to how.  ""She certainly does know now."" Not ""she certainly knows though this method."""
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:16:18 2015 UTC,"no that is not evidence that Carolina can read Epsilons mind and steal all his secrets  and Omega was always a silly cartoonish villain even while possesing Flowers so obviously thats not docs fault (i mean his ridiculous evil laugh? please thats trademark cartoon)  Epsilon has been seen refering to Carolina as sis but not to her face, in his wier AI super slow time zone where Carolina doesnt even know happening because its so fast, and Carolina never called him Brother, at best they see each other as close friends  look how much and how far Church had to go, he had to bring her back to life, he had to rip himself into shreds, he had to bring her back twice more and then have a good long talk with her before he could finally bring himself to accept the fact that Tex was dead, and she wasnt coming back anymore  if thats not a painful memory then theres no such thing as painful memories  certainly there is a good chance she knows, but theres enough ambiguity that she may not, the army of Tex could have just been his last line of defence with no deeper meaning"
RedvsBlue,32uc7s,Forikorder,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"Church never ""ripped himself to shreads"" to create either Tex. With Beta, she just appeared alongside Alpha when Alpha was created. With Epsilon-Tex, Epsilon got a couple weird visions and felt a compulsion to find a way to seperate her from him. To ""get her out of his head."" Neither experiences seemed particularly traumatic for Church.  Also, the host is able to ""read"" the A.I.s mind because that's what already happened with Epsilon and Wash. Why would Church feel compelled to hide this information from her? We saw how she felt about Tex, so how can Church sharing with her the truth hurt? You think it would break Carolina or something?   This is dumb. Carolina must know about the true nature of Tex, from a thematic standpoint. She stood side by side with Church to confront the Director about what he'd done. Everything that he'd done.  You can't have the characters do that and not have them be on the same page.   What does Carolina not knowing about Tex accomplish? All it does is leave the issue open, unresolved. Season 10 was all about putting the past behind them and letting go. How does Carolina forgiving the Director work when she doesn't even understand what he did and why on such a fundamental level?  It just doesn't fit into the narrative."

RedvsBlue,32uc7s,alynnidalar,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:45:34 2015 UTC,Carolina and the Director also have the same eyes. They both have uniquely bright green eyes. The fact that they made the scene where the Director took off his glasses into a big reveal and they had Carolina's helmet off for that scene made it obvious we were supposed to make a connection between the two. It's basically confirmed when Carolina and Church later talk about how great Carolina's mother was and how she had terrible taste in men.

RedvsBlue,32sspa,calidoc,2,Thu Apr 16 13:14:10 2015 UTC,"So we don't have a timeline of how ""old"" Church actually is, right?"
RedvsBlue,32sspa,alynnidalar,6,Thu Apr 16 13:37:54 2015 UTC,"Not really, because we don't have a firm timeline for the series in general.  It seems that the first five seasons took about 3 years, and we know season 6 took place at least a year after that (because Church had been at his new base for fourteen months), but beyond that it's left very vague.  It seems very likely that Epsilon has lived longer than the usual seven-year AI lifespan, but that's because he's not a full smart AI."
RedvsBlue,32sspa,theYOLOdoctor,2,Thu Apr 16 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"Well for reconstruction, we can assume that it's been roughly 14 months because of the Church thing as you mentioned, and the Recreation trailer says 'post war year 1.25', which means that it takes place wishing the same few months as Reconstruction. Based on the events in Recreation and Revelation, these stories probably collectively took place over the span of just a few days, with the only uncertain time being transit to Sandtrap and back (probably just a few hours). So collectively the Recollection took just a few months."
RedvsBlue,32sspa,alynnidalar,2,Thu Apr 16 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"I have a whole lengthy hypothetical timeline if we want to go there, actually. :)  But in general, I'd agree that it's hard to make Recollection last more than maybe six months total. Beyond that, it's hard to tell, though, because seasons 9, 10, and 11 all took place an indeterminate amount of time after the previous season."
RedvsBlue,32sspa,JacksonSX35,2,Thu Apr 16 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed the BGC occurred in maybe two years at most, then reconstruction comes some 14-18 months later (they may have stayed in Blood Gulch awhile after the end of BGC). Reconstruction would take three weeks at most, by my idea of how things work. Then comes recreation maybe a month later, and that lasts a few weeks. A week may have passed between recreation and revelation, and Revelation would take maybe two or three weeks. Then a monthish later, season 9's finale (the breakout) occurs, followed by maybe three weeks for season 10's realtime events. Probably a week after, the crash on Chorus, followed by the chorus trilogy currently spanning maybe six months at the moment. That's my timeline. I'll streamline it when I'm not on mobile.   As promised, a (theoretical) timeline based on my understanding of the events of RvB:  -BGC: All five seasons, nine months to two years, counting the off-time between seasons, followed by  anywhere between a few months to maybe a year, then the relocation from Blood Gulch.  -Fourteen months later, Reconstruction's events occur, ranging from a little over a week to a little less than three weeks, but no more. Maybe a month at most of off-time until...  -Recreation. I imagine this would take place over another week, maybe two at the most, counting the travel time to Sandtrap.  -Revelation would occur almost immediately after Recreation ends, maybe a day passed at most. From there, the season could take place within a week, maybe a week and a half, with downtime after Tex's reactivation. Then the epsilon unit 'fails', leading to a very hard to pin down off-time.  -Seasons 9 and 10 would pick up anywhere between a week or two and a few months later, as we don't exactly know how many versions of the canyon Epsilon went through. Anyway, the breakout occurs right as Tex is finally deleted, and the next season would take anywhere from a week to two weeks long, then a good two weeks max for the ship to crash on Chorus.  -Seasons 11 and 12 likely took place over at least a month, with season 13 picking up another month after the unification of Chorus, leading us to where we are now.   Keep in mind, this isn't official, just how I've come to view the timeline of the show. This would put RvB into about 4 or 6 years as a timeframe."
RedvsBlue,32sspa,CommanderLoco,2,Thu Apr 16 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"A scene from the first miniseries shows Church and Wyoming meeting.  Whether that is an actual memory or just a piece of a memory from the alpha, I don't know."

RedvsBlue,32sspa,Dan_Of_Time,2,Fri Apr 17 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"That's where I thought you got that from.  That situation along with his sidewinder memories are fake, loosely based on PFL history. Church would have known about Wyoming when he was an AI, some of these memories retained when he went to blood gulch.  Church is based off The Director and has some of his childhood memories. He was never a soldier."
RedvsBlue,32sspa,Forikorder,-5,Fri Apr 17 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"OR we can just accept that S1-5 are intended to be the entire story and they didnt plan on making S6-13 from the begining  the reason why Church knows Wyoming is because they met while soldiers, while that was later retconned that was the actual reason at the time  so to answer the question ""how does Church know Wyoming"" the answer is ""from training"""
RedvsBlue,32sspa,Dan_Of_Time,3,Fri Apr 17 06:47:38 2015 UTC,"1-5 are canon yes, but other events such as flashbacks and such are somewhat less. Church was never a soldier, he was an AI. Meeting Wyoming like that was a situation he developed in order to find an excuse as he couldn't believe he was an AI anymore. I think Burnie had a rough idea what he was planning for 6-10 as hints are made very early on. ""There's no Red vs Blue, it's all a lie!"", the existence of Phillis/VIC early on, Church mentioning concern/curiosity about Carolina in season 5 when we had no idea who she was.  Of course there are discrepancies here and there but we can ignore them or make excuses for them. Situations like the one you mentioned are usually just altered memories of the Alpha, or told from a different perspective. The canon answer would be he knows about him because of PFL."
RedvsBlue,32sspa,Forikorder,-4,Fri Apr 17 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"the retconned answer would be that, but the true answer is they met during training  as much as i love RvB you cant deny the continuity is a complete mess"
RedvsBlue,32sspa,Dan_Of_Time,2,Fri Apr 17 14:09:22 2015 UTC,Canon = True I agree there are errors but most if not all can be related to the corrupt memory of the Alpha.
RedvsBlue,32sspa,Forikorder,-5,Fri Apr 17 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"sure if you want to hide behind a ridiculous idea od ""everything that could literally have not happened is simply Alpha somehow inventing a random nonsense memory that doesnt exist for some reason even if Tex is the one telling the story""  and that doesnt explain all the problems in the first place"
RedvsBlue,32sspa,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:29:51 2015 UTC,"For a 12 year old series you will find continuity issues, especially one that has a global storyline. Taking into account the Freelancer idea was a vague concept for the first 5-6 years, RT has been able to wrap everything in nicely. (Especially the Florida joke in Season 5, made sense in Season 10)   inventing a random nonsense memory that doesn't exist for some reason   If you pay attention to the show you would understand Church creates these situations in his head as he cannot cope with the truth, hence the birth of Epsilon and the eventual downfall of the program.    even if Tex is the one telling the story   Tex was telling the story, but it concerned Alpha. For us, The viewers, we saw the Alpha's view of the situation. Tex met Wyoming in training at PF. Alpha would have known about this.   A lot of RvB depends on this sort of analysis, we know we haven't been told the full story so these sort of continuity problems can be easily looked over if you look at it with a broader mind."

RedvsBlue,32m3pp,Forikorder,3,Wed Apr 15 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"Hargrove didn't steal it. He's had it. He's Chairman of the Oversight committee and would've confiscated this stuff a long time ago when he shut down Project Freelancer.  It didn't just arrive there or originate from there--the Chairman specifically moved it there after he decided to use the planet as a big harvesting ground for alien tech.   As for whether the UNSC knows--they likely know the Chairman has it, but without the AI's it's pretty useless stuff. Delta said that North was only able to hold up the energy shield in the field for 3 seconds and that Maine couldn't use any of the equipment after the EMP. Without the AIs it's super usless, so likely the UNSC didn't care that the Chairman had it. By their reasoning, he IS the UNSC. It's like the police confiscating evidence and putting it in lockup indefinitely.   As for the rest of the freelancer tech, that was covered last season. I don't really feel it necessary to repeat myself on every single detail unless it hints at future episodes. Breakdowns are mostly about foreshadowing, not about reviewing or refreshing."

RedvsBlue,32m3pp,Forikorder,3,Wed Apr 15 13:47:21 2015 UTC,The freelancer tech wasn't on the ship. That's why Carolina and Church left the blue and reds for a bit. They knew some of the Freelancer tech was being used by the Space Pirates. You think they would've left it behind for the Space Pirates to collect?  It was just weapons. The main thing they wanted from the Reds and Blues ship was to crash their ship and sell weapons to the two sides. That's what they even admitted to.

Is it the part where you counted their guys or the part where you counted our guys, cause they both sound really tough.  Simmons: Shut up Grif, no ones talking to you.  Sarge: Hmm... This could be strategically advantageous.  Grif: Or maybe it was the part where you subtracted 1 from 5. Math can be hard, Hey Lopez!  Lopez: Si  Grif: Fire up your calculator unit, we got a doozy!     In Chapter 1 ""Don't Get Me Started""     Grif: If we beat them, Command will just send us to some new base, where we have to fight a real team.  Simmons: So?  Grif: So!? Do you want to fight one shitty enemy, or five real enemies?  Sarge: B-L-U-E. Blue! Try looking under “suck it!”  Grif: You want me to help you subtract one from five? I know that’s tough for you.

RedvsBlue,32kg9z,KAnimalia,8,Tue Apr 14 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"I RvB, I think the bubble shield acts like a containment dome.  there is no way in or out. It deflects bullets and prevents anyone from passing through it. In the scene with the insurrectionist snipers, If it acted like a normal halo bubble shield then they could have just walked outside of it, but instead they are trapped. Same in Same with S6 E6, where South traps herself inside to protect herself from the meta. He resorts to shooting the dome to try and weaken it."

RedvsBlue,32kg9z,Forikorder,4,Tue Apr 14 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"The thing about the Bloody Mary soldiers being trapped was that the bubble shield expands around them. They may have been trapped once it was expanded, but when it actually activates it doesn't bounce them all away like it did this soldier.  My possible solution to that is that the Fed didn't know how to use it, so just poking it caused it to not expand properly. Like, if it has a ""pass-through"" mode it uses when it expands, and a ""containment"" mode when it is solid, the Fed could just have not calibrated it properly. After all, he's no expert."
RedvsBlue,32kg9z,professionalecho,2,Tue Apr 14 16:58:52 2015 UTC,There. You've got it! That was what I was wondering about. Thank you for clearing this up.

RedvsBlue,32kg9z,CommanderLoco,2,Thu Apr 16 14:39:19 2015 UTC,I think it works on people too.  Those guys in the Bloody Mary were trapped and were killed before they could figure a way out of it.

RedvsBlue,32kg9z,gamefanatic,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:17:35 2015 UTC,"Well if the shield works on everything, then why does it still form in a semi sphere rather than pushing out all of the material under it, creating a crater? Let's say you're on a ledge in Halo, and you make a bubble shield near the edge. The shield will still form in a sphere where there's no ground. According to the Halo Nation Wiki: The Z-4190 Temporal Protective Enfolder/Stationary Shield, also known as the Bubble Shield, protects against bullets, explosions, lasers, plasma, flames, Fragmentation grenades, and other projectiles. Players and Enemies can enter the shield freely, and vehicles are still able to pass through it. My original theory was that it had to do with velocity, much like the surface tension of water, where relatively slow moving object like a person or a vehicle would be able to pass through it but bullets would be deflected, but a warthog definitely moves faster than a grenade, so now I'm confused on how it works."

RedvsBlue,32hng4,TheBawlrus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:52:20 2015 UTC,So I'm a software developer and it's common practice that every time you have to assign an arbitrary value to something you always pick the same number. It makes realizing that the value was arbitrary later a LOT easier. I could easily see them consistently pick the same arbitrary number when they need a random one.

RedvsBlue,32e8ww,SmokeySmokes,14,Mon Apr 13 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"Locus - direct, deliberate and focused. Maintains respect for his enemy. Something tells me he would have worked well with the Delta AI.  Grey - who doesn't look a chipper doctor? Just don't get on her bad side.  The Director - more on a personal note, as someone dear to me was lost early in my life, I question to what lengths I'd go to bring them back.  North - Like the older brother I never had. TWO sniper rifles and witty banter mixed with a cold determination, sold.  CT - Dedicated to what she believed right to the death. Able to stand up to Tex and Carolina in a fight for a decent length of time. And made the hologram armor mod awesome to see in action.  Honorable mention goes to Pillman because folding combat tomahawks are always awesome."
RedvsBlue,32e8ww,Odd_Tactics,9,Mon Apr 13 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Director. That reveal when he's just sitting alone in the secret base/whatever, just endlessly rewatching that home video of Allison..... um....I got something in my eye. Yeah. sniff"

RedvsBlue,32e8ww,Dudefrommars,8,Tue Apr 14 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"Never was big on the freelancer saga, and wash is basically a blue now, but the Chorus trilogy has some of (in my opinion) the best written characters in RvB. Locus and Felix top that list. They contrast each other so well, and it's always fun to see Felix flip from charming hero to cold killer in an instant, while Locus has one of the bigger internal crises looming over him, waiting to pounce. Grey, Kimball, and Matthews finish out the list.   JK: Andersmith because Ryan and a somewhat realistic version of Caboose. And because nobody really likes a kiss ass."
RedvsBlue,32e8ww,JacksonSX35,3,Mon Apr 13 08:27:59 2015 UTC,"Love Andersmith and Bitters, those two have been the best additions aside from Felix and Locus in the Chorus trilogy. Hope after this season they stick around and maybe join Red and Blue team"

Always moving the plot forward and you can tell his years with York rubbed off on him. He is also the only AI apart from Epsilon after pairing with Carolina that we see him assisting in the field. It not just being assumed.  Vic. Vic is awesome and hip and I adore his banter in the radio. Yo Yo.  Dr. Grey. She is so cool, and dark and happy and excited. Basically like a cool version of doc.

RedvsBlue,32e8ww,Dudefrommars,3,Mon Apr 13 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get down voted for this but I'll go ahead and add my top 5 least favorite characters outside of the Reds and Blues.  Vic- I never ever liked Vic, he always just annoyed me and he (in my opinion mind you) was the least funny of the funny characters.  Felix- Tucker was dead on when he called Felix a ""fucking tool"" because that's exactly what he is.  Wyoming- Although he does have a few funny moments anyone that kills Caboose gets an automatic on my least favorite list.  CT- Not the original CT but the insurrection leader who took over her armor. The only bigger tool in RvB is Felix. I liked him when he was just the insurrection leader, he was alot cooler then. He seemed to change from awesome to douche bag the second he put on her armor.   Sigma- Basically the reason Maine became Meta so he's gotta be on the least favorite list."
RedvsBlue,32e8ww,TheXanderZone,3,Mon Apr 13 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"Aw, but Felix's douchebaggery is exactly why I love him so much. I find him incredibly fun to hate. He's a bit like South, I loathe both of them as people and adore them as characters."
RedvsBlue,32e8ww,Kilro,2,Mon Apr 13 18:34:10 2015 UTC,He's one of those perfect love to hate characters. I may hate him but he's fun to hate

RedvsBlue,32dexs,ilivetofly,2,Sun Apr 12 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"all they need is the shield, then she only has to beat someone 1v1, last time her leg was still a problem but now its fine so even if Felix or Locust arrive she can deal with either of them easily enough  even if both Locus and Felix attack her if she focuses only on defense she could distract them while important things happen, if wash keeps Locus busy then theres noone who can beat her  and she can freely engage in long range while everyone has to only melee her"
RedvsBlue,32dexs,Forikorder,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:20:08 2015 UTC,I agree. I can't wait to see what they do with it. Didn't Carolina find information proving they where developing the freelancer equipment to be able to work without the need for an AI?  Maybe Wash or Tucker or someone will get it (maybe caboose to keep him safe or Gray so she can get working without being interrupted e.g. she needs the shield to prevent them killing her when she stops them activating the floating alien thing). Its also possible they have modified it in other way's so it can be over-ridden or deactivated/boobytrapped.
RedvsBlue,32dexs,ilivetofly,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:35:10 2015 UTC,well they are reverse engineering and reproducing them (which is why every space pirate can go invisible) but theres still the Freelancer originals kicking around which is moooooost likely what they found (i mean why hand out regular shields to your soldiers when you ahve bubble shields?) so only Carolina will be using it for the foreseeable future
RedvsBlue,32dexs,Forikorder,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"Probably, unless her armour only permits one. Still can't Epsilon jump between bodies through the radio like O'Mally? Shouldn't they be abel to give the shield to anyone and then have Epsilon pop in when they need to use it.   Technically North was able to use it without a line back to base or an AI so... the possibilities are endless I guess."

Same goes for Grey but since she was only introduced in season 12 thats expected.

If you're talking about the guy in Episode 1, that wasn't the Meta. It seems pretty clear he's Sharkface, the Charon/""Insurrectionist"" soldier with a flamethrower that Wash and Carolina fought in the heist in season 9.

RedvsBlue,32daz5,BoneArrowInfinity,7,Sun Apr 12 20:59:35 2015 UTC,Everyone seems to be listing some pretty important people:   F.I.L.S.S (computer screen) Sheila (tank) Chupathingy (Warthog) Junior (small alien head thing)   But everyone is forgetting the real MVP's the real team players Andy and Vic.

RedvsBlue,32daz5,ilivetofly,7,Mon Apr 13 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"Chupathingy? As awesome as it was, not really that important, although it'd be hilarious to have a flair I guess.  As for Sheila, I definitely agree here, a very important character. Hell, if we also count F.I.L.S.S she is kinda more important. I think it'd be difficult to find symbols for them though..."
RedvsBlue,32daz5,UltimaNylocke,9,Sun Apr 12 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"It's one of the most long-lived side characters- hell, it's died and come back more times than Church, and that's saying something."

RedvsBlue,32bsuy,surosregime,17,Sun Apr 12 12:42:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the first Tex we ever encountered was actually the Beta AI. Agent Maine (The Meta) took her and Omega from her body in the crashed Pelican (with Sheila installed on it). Then the EMP killed Beta, Omega, and all the other AI that the Meta had.  Later, Epsilon and Caboose found the offsite storage facility (Where FILISS/Sheila first thought Epsilon was the Director) and Epsilon ""created"" Tex again based on his memory of her. Then Washington and the Meta stabbed her in the face with the Epsilon Memory Unit-turned capture device and locked her in it. Epsilon followed, where he finds and ""forgets"" her.  End timeline for where you are in the story.  The theory that he could create her again is possible, but unlikely. Reason being, he didn't actually forget her in the sense of deleting her from his memory, but in that he actively chooses to leave her in the past and move on. Allison is long, long dead; Tex/Beta is long dead now too; Epsilon's memory of her didn't even want to be brought back to begin with. It's better for her, and it's better for him, if she were left in the past.  Spoiler for after Season 9"
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,dayofwreckoning,9,Sun Apr 12 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"This is the best explanation. A good thing to add is that Burnie once said we may have seen the end of Tex's story, but we haven't seen all of her story.  So in theory Tex could ""return"" in some form that we explore her past, possibly linked to Epsilon in some way. As there have been subtle hints of the end of Epsilon recently, we might see Tex returning for him. Possibly like a flashback/memory. Personally I doubt we will see her again, at least for a while."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,Dan_Of_Time,5,Sun Apr 12 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"well technically its possible that he didnt meet her in the storage unit, but created another tex (which is why she knows everything he knows and talks about, because he needed a tex that would talk things out with him) in which case the 2nd tex is still in the memory unit and the one he talked to and deleted was a third tex"
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,Forikorder,4,Sun Apr 12 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"You coherently expressed my feelings on this matter. When in the storage unit he says ""I guess I'm the alpha in here"" and the alpha ""made"" tex so I think he made the Tex in there as well.   I miss Tex... Carolina is okay but I mean I still miss tex"
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,ilivetofly,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely possible. However, unless someone attempted to pull her out of the memory unit after Sarge and Caboose pulled Epsilon out, then she'll remain hidden there. A very unlikely event, even if Malcolm Hargrove got his hands on the memory unit, because he wouldn't even know she was there. And even if he did know she was there, he'd have every reason to believe that she was pulled out of it when Epsilon was, and is simply unaccounted for."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,dayofwreckoning,2,Sun Apr 12 16:13:43 2015 UTC,"the memory unit itself would have reason to be studied, he might try to reverse engineer it as a way to capture and neutralize epsilon and then discover Tex by accident while doing so"
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,Forikorder,2,Sun Apr 12 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"Hm. He does seem to have the time and resources to throw at such an endeavor. And even the motivation. But when Wash and Maine converted the Epsilon unit into a capture unit, Wash said that they were trained to do that. Which means that the device itself, as well as the method of conversion into a capture unit, is old news to Hargrove. He would need a reason to assume that that particular device was of significance. Outwardly, it's not, as there are dozens of similar devices left over from PFL (albeit disabled from the EMP), AND the recovery teams already believed it to be broken beyond salvaging. It wasn't, and Hargrove knows that now, since Epsilon is back with the Reds and Blues, so perhaps that may give him a reason to look back at it again. We shall see.  As we say in r/RWBY, it's all potato."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,dayofwreckoning,2,Sun Apr 12 16:29:31 2015 UTC,i dont think the recovery team ever believed it to be beyond salvaging (aside from maybe the soldiers at the begining) even Caboose didnt take long to figure out it was still functioning i imagine any scientist could take one look at it and realise it was still functionable  and since Malcolm was in charge of catching the directer and building the case taht info would ahve been forwarded to him
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,Forikorder,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"All good points, but let me counter one: Caboose may not have known it was still functioning. Caboose is simply obsessed with Church and would have gone looking for him even if the unit was actually dead. So while he may not have known it was working, he hoped, no he believed that it was, and that's all he needed."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,dayofwreckoning,2,Sun Apr 12 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"no i meant after they found it, he easily figured out it was still working"
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,Forikorder,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Yeah, he has a...way...with machines."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,dayofwreckoning,3,Sun Apr 12 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"Original Alison is dead.  Tex, AKA Beta got destroyed by the EMP.  Epsilon-Tex appears to be gone as well. Either destroyed or reabsorbed into Epsilon and put to rest.  Only thing that's really left are the dozens of Texbots the Director had, which are unlikely to be as advanced as the Tex(s) we knew. It's unclear from where they came from, but seeing how the Director made so many, and rejected them all, they're probably only shadows of what our Tex was, which in itself was but a shadow of Alison. A shadow of a shadow.  Epsilon telling her to go to sleep may have made her permanently inoperable, or possibly they were connected to F.I.L.S.S. when she was ordered to erase everything. They/she is unlikely to exist in that form.  I think the only place Tex lives is Epsilon-Church's memories, and only as a memory, not a memory/fragment like what Epsilon does with Delta and the rest."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,PrinceCheddar,2,Sun Apr 12 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"No, as far as anyone knows, she's gone for good."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,loony123,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:00:10 2015 UTC,"Epsilon could just remember Tex Like he does with the other AI fragments, but he doesn't want to because Tex HATES coming back for two reasons (for example s 8 ep10 where she tries to escape from the facility and ends up kicking everyone [minus caboose]'s asses)    1.) She can't stand people making decisions for her and she despises that everyone thinks they know what's best for her ""He didn't exactly ask me what I wanted... I didn't get a vote"" ""I didn't ask to come back... Yeah, everybody always seems to know what's best for Tex.""   2.) She can never achieve any goal because ""she died in her real life, and that's all the director remembered of her, so now no matter how tough she is, no matter how hard she fights, she's always going to fail because that's what she's based on."""

Everything that happened, happened because  the director believed she died. The death was never confirmed though. She could still be alive somewhere.    With the whole Cryogenic thing /u/nightmare901 said ""It would explain the friction between the Director and the Chairman. If the Chairman had Allison in cryogenic suspension, but refused to let Church wake her up. It would explain why the Director's mind was so fractured that the memory of Allison got out, and why everything Tex does ends in failure. Because the real Allison was held just out of the Director's reach.""     I like that theory though don't necessarily agree with it. I do believe it is possible that she never actually died though."

RedvsBlue,32bsuy,ilivetofly,2,Sun Apr 12 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"I take back what I said about neither being confirmed, She was KIA which infected the Director's memory of her, Essentially always trapping her in a circle of failure.   Epsilon even confirms her death in Season 8 Episode 19  ""She died in her real life and that's all The Director ever remembered of her""  So this is confirmation from Epsilon and The Director that she died. Also I don't think he would work on replacing her if she was MIA. He would most likely go out and try to find her. The risks he took in order to bring her back were way to big to be chances if she was still alive."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"Still we are talking about a space war, you think every body was recovered?

But I wont bet on a possibility and I doubt she will be back in any form in the future of RvB. That doesn't mean we wont see more of her past though."
RedvsBlue,32bsuy,ilivetofly,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's clear she was confirmed KIA, hence why The Director feels so strongly about her and Tex. Those feeling's don't come unless you have lost someone that close."

RedvsBlue,328mos,TweetPoster,4,Sat Apr 11 15:51:07 2015 UTC,How come it's directed towards Tumblr? Is that where the discovery of the number started spreading around?
RedvsBlue,328mos,jordan_bar,13,Sat Apr 11 15:59:02 2015 UTC,Yep. Specifically daftprodigy discovered the first ones.
RedvsBlue,328mos,OtakuMecha,2,Sat Apr 11 16:03:51 2015 UTC,It was actually discovered by multiple people at once. Not just on tumblr but several places. Tumblr is just the place Miles seems to pay more attention to.
RedvsBlue,328mos,ilivetofly,4,Sat Apr 11 17:44:18 2015 UTC,Tumblr also is kinda known for fanning about stuff and like losing there dicks. Personally I never fucking realised and am an active tumblr user
RedvsBlue,328mos,TaylorCulosis,3,Sat Apr 11 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"He's a busy man. Why would he not pay attention to the arena where information gets thrown around faster and promotes various fan works?  I'm sure he checks on the main thread around the time of an episode's release, but that board quickly devolves into nothing after a couple days and during PSA weeks.  And this sub is like the thread but... slower... with more participants. (It wasn't too long ago that people were posting pictures of the Staff of Charon saying ""Wow, Charon was there all along!"" and getting plenty of upvotes.)  That being said: this sub has certainly gotten better, I'm glad we're not getting people posting fanart they found on Tumblr without crediting the artist."
RedvsBlue,328mos,OtakuMecha,2,Sun Apr 12 02:01:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I know. Was just pointing out this observation was not unique to just the tumblr part of the community.
RedvsBlue,328mos,TaylorCulosis,2,Sun Apr 12 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"Wasn't sure, a lot of people are quick to demonize other portions of the community.  Even still, I keep up with the three boards and didn't spot it on the main thread until daftprodigy's post showed up. I'd hope she sourced it if she hadn't found/compiled it herself. (And having it compiled in one post is still convenient.)"
RedvsBlue,328mos,OtakuMecha,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:18:35 2015 UTC,I just saw several people on tumblr and such mention the recurring 57 in their episode reactions which were all pretty close together and it popped up on the site too. So I just figured different people all noticed the same detail. Like it didn't come from one exact source.
RedvsBlue,328mos,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"That's probably the case. But I think it's worth crediting the person who assembled it all visually, since that gets the message across much faster. (Which apparently wasn't Daft)"
RedvsBlue,328mos,OtakuMecha,2,Sun Apr 12 02:29:58 2015 UTC,Where else was it discovered?
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:48:58 2015 UTC,I mean I think I saw it on other blogs too when the second episode first came out
RedvsBlue,328mos,sqyguy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:13:13 2015 UTC,I can't speak for the exact timing but I know it was in the Season 13 thread on the site pretty early too. There tends to be a lot of theories or ideas that show up there but don't get much recognition until it gets put on Tumblr.
RedvsBlue,328mos,jordan_bar,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"Becasue Tumblr's idea of equality is putting what they support first. And he has to make sure that Tumblr feels equal, you don't want to piss off those motherfuckers."
RedvsBlue,328mos,sqyguy,3,Sat Apr 11 20:24:26 2015 UTC,I kinda laughed at this so I hope you were joking
RedvsBlue,328mos,jordan_bar,4,Sat Apr 11 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"On Tumblr you don't make jokes, your jokes make you...a bigot"
RedvsBlue,328mos,Firebat12,3,Sat Apr 11 23:54:38 2015 UTC,10/10 would be offended again
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:56:41 2015 UTC,But were here i mean do they have more than the people who don't belong to forums or the people who arent on tumblr. Or the people who arent going to riot if he makes carolina break her leg. I mean he could piss them off because he eventually will have to or the next writer will(assuming there is one).
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:07:29 2015 UTC,Because Miles is in bed with the Tumblr community
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,4,Sat Apr 11 17:46:38 2015 UTC,What makes you say that?
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,5,Sat Apr 11 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"The fan responses he talks about and his commentaries about certain theories are always related to how the Tumblr crowd feels.  Basically the reddit discussion threads and site forums are much more...I'm not sure how to describe it. But there is a stark difference in the way they react to things.  On Tumblr every one is like ""PLS NO MILES MY FEELS! oh god don't hurt my precious babies Miles, you're such a dark writer!!!"" despite the fact that he has only actually killed two named characters and they were totally unimportant. They sort of over react to stuff and act like he's about to kill off every character when it's becoming increasingly obvious he doesn't have it in him to kill off anyone. On Tumblr, people say things like ""If Miles makes bad things happen to insert character then we riot"" and shit while people on the site forums tend to be more accepting of bad things happening to characters because it would be boring if it didn't. Some people even wish Miles would kill off some people because as is, no one has really got hurt or died so the stakes and darkness are all fake unless there's some bite to the merc's bark. It lessens tension when there's no reason to believe the characters are in any real danger. But Tumblr gets all worked up over the slightest thing and that's what Miles focuses on when talking about fan reactions. Talking about how everyone is upset and ""feels"" and stuff. On the commentaries, he gushes about the characters in the same way Tumblr does which makes it seem like he wouldn't hurt the characters even though it would make the stakes better.  Basically, he focuses a lot more of the overemotional Tumblr side of the fanbase that doesn't seem to want to allow RvB to have real stakes or darkness while just playing with them when there's no real danger present.  Reddit is a lot less emotional but doesn't have as many wild theories as Tumblr.  The site has both the theories and the more ""logical"" look at the writing and storytelling instead of posting in all caps and focusing on the more overemotional side. But Miles tends to only bring up the more Tumblr-esque fan reactions and theories."
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,5,Sat Apr 11 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, put like that, it's because reddit sounds a lot less interesting than Tumblr. I kinda reject your premise, because neither is a hive mind, and I think what you're actually describing is just a level of activity. We're not a super-active subreddit, whereas the Tumblr tag is very active. That makes it much more likely that what actually happened is, Miles saw most of the 57 activity there (where it was) and posted with that in mind"
RedvsBlue,328mos,07jonesj,2,Sat Apr 11 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I'm not talking about just here. I mean like the S13 discussion thread on the RT site comes up with some of the same theories before tumblr but it's only acknowledged by Miles as a ""tumblr thing"". Like the site forum regulars figured out a lot of stuff (like the Charon and Chairman thing was figured out way back in S11) but Miles would attribute it to being something tumblr picked up on.  And he can sometime act like Tumblr's opinion is the dominant one. Like when it comes to character deaths, he says on the commentary how he didn't want to deal with the backlash of implying Wash was dead for an episode. But it's mainly just Tumblr that is all the time like ""OMG IF ANY SINGLE CHARACTER GETS HURT IN THE SLIGHTEST MILES IS THE GRRM OF RVB!!!"" whereas some people on the RT site and such would be very welcoming of a meaningful main character death and want Miles to be a little less afraid to pull the trigger on people since it is a war and stuff.  But Miles tends to only bring up the overemotional reactions that overexaggerate everything and make it seem like he shouldn't take risks like that."
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,2,Sat Apr 11 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that's annoying, but have you considered that Miles' tweet might be thinking the same thing? He's obviously baiting them, but what if he's also making fun of them for the same things you're describing?"
RedvsBlue,328mos,beregond23,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe but past things he's done (like the S13 announcement vid where he's doing mocap) and the way he words things in journals and stuff makes it seem like he really revels in the ""evil writer"" persona when really he's less dark than Burnie was. It's like playing with that fanbase by exaggerating the danger when really he hasn't given us reason to believe any of the main good guys could die. But the Tumblr crowd acts like he's already delivered on danger and tension which tells him ""Alright this is working. I should do more of this act like they're in danger when they're not stuff."" whereas I feel like he should do more. Show us he's not afraid to pull the trigger on someone important and I'll believe there's actually a reason to ""feel"" but until then it's all smoke and mirrors that the Tumblr crowd is blowing way out of proportion and sends a message to Miles that that's adequate."
RedvsBlue,328mos,Achilloraptor,2,Sat Apr 11 18:53:03 2015 UTC,I already said I agree with you; I'm just not sure it relates to this tweet.
RedvsBlue,328mos,Hokzwijn,0,Sat Apr 11 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"You asked why I said Miles was ""in bed"" with Tumblr"
RedvsBlue,328mos,Hokzwijn,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"So I don't use Tumblr whatsoever because I'm not down with the ""everything is a trigger/offends me BS"" that seems to propogate there.  Do people there truly consider Miles to be a dark writer? He's a good one and the Felix twist was brilliant, but did the people saying this start with S11? After the Tex/Church stuff, Carolinas's story arc (+ York) and how they dealt with the Director, nothing comes close to where that season went in terms of grimness."
RedvsBlue,328mos,haqq17,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:47:35 2015 UTC,Yeah he talks about it in the S12 finale livestream. People have called him the George RR Martin of RvB which is stupid as he hasn't killed off anyone important. And if you ever looked at episode reactions on Tumblr you'd think he was killing their cats every episode.
RedvsBlue,328mos,itmakessenseincontex,2,Sun Apr 12 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"I'd argue we're just a smaller community than tumblr, most of our threads don't break 30 comments where tumblr can easily pump out dozens of pics in a short time."
RedvsBlue,328mos,haqq17,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Alright but I'm not talking about just here. I'm mainly talking about the site and the S13 discussion threads there which is, y'know, RT's homebase."

RedvsBlue,328mos,KulaanDoDinok,3,Sat Apr 11 16:47:34 2015 UTC,Interesting. Seems like it was more than a random number Miles repeated. I have no idea what it could be though
RedvsBlue,329g0q,paeoco,17,Sat Apr 11 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"Most coherent explanation I can come up with:  Church being blasted back in time by the bomb, waiting for years, going forward in time back to Blood Gulch, trying to fix things but causing them, repeatedly going back in time, creating the clones of himself, until deciding to just go forward in time with the rest of the guys.. didn't happen. It was Gamma trapping him in a simulation for reasons that are unclear. IIRC, Burnie confirmed as much, but I have no sources to back that up right now.  Yellow Church was a product of Caboose's mind, his mental representation of Sister.  When Church was ejected from Caboose's mind, the yellow Church was ejected along with it. Due to the whole business with A.I.s in Caboose's mind at the time, Yellow Church kinda became an A.I. himself.(Though probably only existed as an extension of Alpha rather than being an A.I. in its own right) This copy of Yellow Church existed, floating around like Alpha, Tex and Omega.  Yellow Church, existing in this ""ghost"" form, interacts with Wyoming's corpse, which has its time manipulation unit malfunctioning. This sends this Yellow Church A.I.-like entity back in time, and placed into the simulation run by Gamma, probably without Gamma's knowledge.  ...  Or it's just a joke.."

When he got ejected from Caboose's mind, he encountered the Wyoming corpse which sent him back into his abandoned robotic body.  The loop is closed, continuity is kept and pretty much no plot holes, except for why Church's body got painted yellow.  But I can accept that as just being part of the joke."

But was that the right thing to do? From Church’s (and the writers’) perspective, perhaps. Without Tex’s shadow haunting him he is finally at peace, but he does just delete her. She is just as much a person as him, even if she did come from him. Once again, nobody asks what Tex wants, and Church believes she is his, to delete as he wills. It’s not an easy conundrum, partly because she was never “supposed” to exist in the first place, but it doesn’t look good. I’ll let you make up your mind on that one, though.   I though Tex said she didn't want to come back? She also didn't like the recursive nature of their interactions, as expressed above. By forgetting Tex, Church figured out the issue, and his motivation was to put both of them at peace before they both died anyways."
RedvsBlue,3252ki,Beamazedbyme,11,Fri Apr 10 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"I was going to make a post of Tumblr since a lot of feminist related stuff gets posted there (because if a show is doing something right, you have to give props to it) but since this topic has come up, I’ll post this here.  One of the reasons why I do like Red vs Blue is their above average portrayal of female characters. Yeah, with the exception Sister, most of the female characters in the show are bitches or moody, but it fits with the scheme of how Red vs Blue works. Alpha was one of the more level-headed characters (as long as it doesn’t involve Tex) but is an asshole (anger management issues), Tucker is an easy-going and take in charge of rationality when Church isn’t but is also an asshole (his lewdness), Caboose is quite friendly/cheery and will try to get along with anyone that isn’t Tucker but is still an asshole (though more so in the earlier season where he was a bit more selfish and didn’t take responsibility for his actions. This later shifted away from being an asshole to not having common sense), and Tex being the strongest soldier excluding the Meta (who is a fusion of different equipment and AIs) but is also an asshole (being very greedy and mean. I mean, punching the team as they sleep for no reason?). They were all jerks or a glaring flaw for one reason for the other (I’m sure you can piece together how the Reds fit in this scheme). Up to season 9, all the characters had a good share of flaws that wasn’t didn’t feel like the writers were being sexist (season 12 also has the same thing but in a different way).   The only really “sexist” characters I found were Tucker and Sarge but the show portrayed them in a good way. For Tucker, his lewd comments but as you mentioned, he gets called out for it or works against him: despite his supposed knowledge on girls, season 9 proves that he probably hasn’t ever dated or banged one (and interestingly enough, he is the one that gets pregnant). For  Sarge, he has a 50s sorta of stereotype which would include females being “weaker” or “in the kitchen” sort of view. He was the only character that commented how Tex not being a real female (or human).He doesn’t attack Sister in season 6 because she is a girl which Wash calls out on (despite this, he does fight Tex in season 8). Lopez even comments he couldn’t win a fight against a teenage girl. For both Tucker and Sarge, these traits aren’t really viewed as “positives” aspects of them (though you make a valid point Tucker’s Bow Chika Wow Wow comments have shifted away from it)  What bugged me in a lot of action-oriented shows was that most of the girls wore more skimpy or impractical armor compared to the guys. We don’t have that problem with this show because they all wear the same type of thing. It’s why we see a lot  less NFW material and lewdness in this community here than we see in /r/RWBY. Other problems I see (not in RWBY but other shows) is that half the reason a female character is there reason on the show is for boobs/sex, they start off strong but progressively become weaker while nothing happens to male characters, or they are all motivated by their love interest. What I love about Red vs Blue is that avoided this for the most part. While Carolina was a bitch, her motivation was to be recognized by father and that she took her job seriously (even if she was approaching it the wrong way). I enjoyed her rivalry and Tex in season 10 and found it really refreshing. After her conflict was resolved, you can see her character improve in season 12, she was wasn’t a bitch because she was her girl but because of her conflicts and character development (note that in seaons 11-12 in general has all of the characters “better” traits outshine their flaws so it’s not specifically different about Carolina). In season 11/12, while Carolina was noticeably weaker to the badass she was before, Wash also suffers from it too (and Epsilon even comments that they weren’t fighting at their best).  About Tex’s agency in season 9, I though that because they were in the memory unit, all the characters were “hallucinations” for the BGC crew (Since the real ones were in the real world). If Epsilon stayed in that world long enough, he probably figure he can delete any of the other members if he wanted too.  Thank you for bringing this up. It was an interesting read, especially about S12 introduction to average female character's.  TL;DR: While I do agree there are still flaws in gender protrayal, I think that it has done it a lot better than most shows from what I’ve seen."
RedvsBlue,3252ki,ShiroiTora,4,Fri Apr 10 21:43:36 2015 UTC,"Good write-up! I still haven't made up my mind about Tex in the Epsilon unit yet, so don't take this as an argument, but just a point of pedantry; she isn't a hallucination in the same way as the others. She knew that it was a memory unit before Church had to tell her, and she remembered her own things beyond the unit; think of her retelling the first fight between her, Wyoming, York & Maine."
RedvsBlue,3252ki,ShiroiTora,2,Fri Apr 10 21:56:12 2015 UTC,"So the Tex we see in season 8 is the same Tex we see in season 9? I   know Tex was able to put pieces together but I thought she sort of died when she was placed in the storage unit  (because I had originally took Church ""forgetting"" Tex in a similar vein to ""I know you are a figiment of my imagination"" sort of thing). If that isn't the case, then I do see the point you are trying to make about her agency."
RedvsBlue,3252ki,ilivetofly,2,Fri Apr 10 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well, remember that even Beta (Tex from s1-5) was originally a figment of Alpha's imagination, so Epsilon ""forgetting"" Tex in s9 is basically an extension of that, except that Epsilon has power over this world so he can literally make her disappear."

I think what RT is doing is having Caboose express an unconventional way of looking at things. It's not necessarily smarter, but it provides insight because it's a different view.  In season 10, just because Caboose understands what Carolina meant without hearing it doesn't make him smart. If two people think the same thing, it's not because one of them is a genius, it's a coincidence.  The Higgs Bozo PSA does have Caboose taking very philosophically, but again, that doesn't make him smart. Sure, that isn't the type of thing you would expect Caboose to say, but I would expect anybody on the RvB cast to say that either.  Ultimately, Caboose is just a character that thinks differently than most people do. This in turn, requires people to think so they can understand what he said. His character is very philosophical on this sense. Philosophy is about asking questions nobody else does, thinking against the crowd. All these times where he is being ""smart"" are really just meant to make you think, which they do."

RedvsBlue,326er7,Edible_Pie,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:34:45 2015 UTC,There were 150 candidates and 75 were picked to be spartans. So John was 117 on the list. That was my understanding anyway.

EDIT: Oh, and keep in mind: ""newly revived,"" as in, they known that Project Freelancer fucked up, and are trying again, this time with less AI breaking stuff. The Spartan Program, instead of just using children who they've genetically enhanced, are now accepting volunteers, granted they have at least three years of active duty on the field. As for the parameters of Freelancer, because they are now on good speaking terms with the UNSC, they have agreed to send at least one Overseer (a neutral power, who under most circumstances, CANNOT get involved with the Sim Troopers) to check up on both teams every once in a while, and send back information to Command on who to pick if war were to be declared. Either way, thank you for the critique.  EDIT EDIT: The reason Gordon-2323 is numbered so is because he etched the extra three at the end of his ID number. He is actually Gordon-232, but he wanted to keep the pattern going."

The things you miss on Netflix are what happens to York (Out of Mind), the backstory for Washington (Recovery One), a bit of filling in gaps between seasons (Relocated), and some shenanigans in the Epsilon Unit (MIA & Where There's a Will, There's a Wall).  I'd recommend finding them online and watching them, even if only for a few more laughs."

Felix and Locus will just want a badass machine, make any machine that isn't a lazy fuck and can fight and dress it up with Tex's armour and a synthetic voice. Im not saying it would be impossible but it would certainly have a (perhaps small) psychological impact on Carolina and perhaps also Epsilon. Or at least the director will tell Felix and Locus it will and use a fake Tex to create a competitive situation and then somehow trap or injure Carolina as she deserts her team to punch fake Tex in the face or you know whatever."

RedvsBlue,31xlm6,ilivetofly,2,Fri Apr 10 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"Idk they could make it so it seemed like one of the directors failed robots that they didnt kill and one that went AWOL. I think it would be nice to see them play more on the Carolina Tex rivalty a bit more considering they mentioned her competitiveness.   I deffanitly think its going to crop up that the counceller has this elaborate way to fuck them but because his information is out of date is only works a little bit (57% success rate teh) and so its like a close fight but in the end they win because Carolina or Washington acted in an ""unexpected"" way that the councillor didn't plan for.

Not to speak ill of the dead but since Monty Oum is no longer with us, the fights scenes may not be choreographed as well as they used too. I'm sure this was one of the series' selling points, probably after comedy. While the series is funny and the plot has proven to be intricate at times, there is that hole in the series, especially since the season premised to be the war between Charon/mercenaries and Chorus. How do they patch this up? Psychological warfare! May not appeal to everyone though.   The Counselor's focus will likely be on the Freelancers since he has the most data on them. I wouldn't be surprised to see the suggestions he gave on episode 1 being done. For example, if Carolina hasn't realized yet that Tex was based off her mom (or knows but has not come to terms), /u/Fiensto's suggestion would be right on the money.  The other suggestion was that Washington refuses to have anymore AI transplants. Eplison could be captured (maybe through Carolina's ""competitiveness"" taking over with the Tex clone). They could forcefully send him into Washington mid-battle, have them both self destruct on each other (2 birds, 1 stone). I don't know if the Councilor has any grudge against him but it would be pretty sadistic, considering how they first met. Regardless, if both Freelancers + AI are out of commission, that would definitely push the morale down for the rest of the army. It would be up to Tucker, Sarge and the rest of the crew will bring them out (assuming Felix doesn't have anything else planned for Tucker)."

RedvsBlue,31xlm6,ShiroiTora,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:01:03 2015 UTC,"I could see Epsilon managing through try to calm him down. However, my point with Epsilon was that the incident could have caused a psychological trauma to Wash, and potentially Eplison. We didn't realize see so much of it in the eariler seasons when Wash was introduced. Even  in season 10 played off Wash's reaction to Donut's death as innocent whistling. However, in season 12 where Locus is more formally introduced, Wash sees hallucinations of the past of taking orders from the Director and killing Donut , despite it being played for laughs in season 11 and season 10. I'm sure the point of the flashbacks was to show Locus and Wash are foils to each (or at least the old Wash). Still, the fact remains that Wash did react the way he did after met Locus (he did though get over it quickly). And then considering how he changed initially after the Epsilon incident, I wouldn't be surprised if he hasn't completely gotten over that either.  Either way, this is what I think might happen if Felix/Locus go using the Counselor's first suggestions in episode 1 (which I doubt thats all  he'll give or how early RT will foreshadow)."
RedvsBlue,31xlm6,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:15:57 2015 UTC,"Psychological trauma:       Psychological trauma is a type of damage to the psyche that occurs as a result of a severely distressing event.  Trauma, which means ""injured"" in Greek,  is often the result of an overwhelming amount of stress that exceeds one's ability to cope or integrate the emotions involved with that experience.  A traumatic event involves one experience, or repeating events with the sense of being overwhelmed that can be delayed by weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences, often overlooked even by mental health professionals: ""If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects.""    Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's familiar ideas about the world and of their human rights, putting the person in a state of extreme confusion and insecurity. This is also seen when institutions that are depended upon for survival, violate or betray or disillusion the person in some unforeseen way.

When filming they had to use the Pistol because it allowed the most filming space (other weapons took up more of the screen). But due to the idle animations, you'll see in some shots the 'camera' moves a little, just so the animation doesn't cut into the middle of a shot.   Season 3 had the most changes I think to the cropped shots, considering they swapped games. Halo: CE used the pistol, then they had the full screen time travel spiral shot, and in Halo 2 they used the Sentinal Beam because it took up less space.   Eventually RT discovered the Oddball weapon drop glitch, which allowed them to crop everything down to the motion sensor, and up to the grenade counter, because the player had no weapons on screen."

RedvsBlue,31oikd,madamfray,6,Mon Apr 6 22:29:53 2015 UTC,I find myself hating Grif more and more each season.  On the reverse side I find myself loving Wash and Tucker more and more.
RedvsBlue,31oikd,Odd_Tactics,4,Tue Apr 7 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"Wash and Tucker have had developments which help with our ability to relate. When it comes to Red team, however, there's been very few character developments, aside from maybe Lopez and Sarge. Even those arcs were pretty minor. Grif seems like the forgotten soldier. He's around for the ride, but most of the time, people forget he's there."
RedvsBlue,31oikd,G3yost,3,Tue Apr 7 00:53:51 2015 UTC,I'm personally enjoying grid more and more. He's like brick in the original anchor man few and far between but when he's on screen he steals the show.

RedvsBlue,31ox3o,paeoco,3,Tue Apr 7 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"When the Alpha was not able to handle the torture, he cast off his memories into the fragment called Epsilon, which means he would not have had knowledge of what the Director had done."
RedvsBlue,31ox3o,ElskeFryst,2,Tue Apr 7 00:29:40 2015 UTC,Then how does the Alpha that we see in the BGC have what he thinks is his own memories? If he cast off his memories into the Epsilon fragment then wouldn't he remember nothing at all? He mentioned in season 6 how he had memories  of when he was a kid (which were actually the directors memories) how would he have these memories if he cast them off into the Epsilon fragment?
RedvsBlue,31ox3o,ElskeFryst,4,Tue Apr 7 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"It was most likely memories of all the horrible things the director had done, not literally everything."
RedvsBlue,31ox3o,G3yost,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:37:29 2015 UTC,Ok that makes sense but what about his other emotions like his logic Alpha showed signs of logic in the BGC how can he still posess emotions like that? I can see how he could discard memories of all thee things th director did to him but did it just discard part of his logic and logic relating to what exactly ?
RedvsBlue,31ox3o,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:47:36 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/elskefryst 's theory.
RedvsBlue,31ox3o,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"The logic he cast off didn't prevent him from having basic logic, It just made him have less. Essentially he went from being quite smart and advanced (Sort of like Epsilon in S12) to just dumb enough to trust. Of course it was always obvious he was one of the smartest and sensible ones of the crew, but compare that to how he was originally the overall loss is obvious.   The memories he shred were specific to PF I believe as ElskeFryst said, what the Director has done, What PF is, memories of Tex. Thats why he didn't recognise her in Season 10 on the Mother of Invention.   Personally I never see how horrible the Alpha's life was until we look at it more closely. Makes you feel bad for the guy :("
RedvsBlue,31ox3o,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Tue Apr 7 10:10:21 2015 UTC,So you're saying that Epsilon was just a part of a fragment. Those that go for of the all AI's ? Weren't we always told that they were fragments of Alpha's  personality but like you said it was only parts of parts of Alpha
RedvsBlue,31mp31,LordArutha,32,Mon Apr 6 14:24:05 2015 UTC,One fan theory is that since he had 3 AI's in his head at once he suffered some sort of brain damage.  From a narrative point its just because each character has become more distinctive.
RedvsBlue,31mp31,Dan_Of_Time,2,Mon Apr 6 14:49:47 2015 UTC,It's a pretty good fan theory though. Carolina could only handle two AIs in her head and she was an agent trained to deal with AI. It seems like more than one AI and things start to go south quickly.
RedvsBlue,31mp31,God_Given_Talent,2,Thu Apr 9 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"Nope, Wash already sorted out South"
RedvsBlue,31mp31,Tauva101,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"Especially since Caboose had 2 full AI's and a fragment, Carolina could only handle 2 fragments before going unconscious for days. God, Caboose got off lucky."

RedvsBlue,31mp31,Hilgy17,9,Mon Apr 6 15:41:19 2015 UTC,His mind was nearly destroyed by an AI in the first season and he has been losing control of his sanity since.
RedvsBlue,31mp31,pureparadise,2,Mon Apr 6 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I mean, Doc had Omega for a while and he doesn't seem affected by that. Maybe it's Doc's alternative lifestyle that's helping him maintain his sanity"
RedvsBlue,31mp31,mkgilligan,5,Mon Apr 6 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps Doc had a stronger mind, Caboose was already not stable to begin with. the human mind is an odd device."
RedvsBlue,31mp31,pureparadise,3,Mon Apr 6 16:33:22 2015 UTC,Yeah but Caboose had three AI at the same time who were fighting each other.

RedvsBlue,31mp31,ilivetofly,5,Mon Apr 6 15:59:41 2015 UTC,But...but Caboose is friends with Admiral Buttercrust as well
RedvsBlue,31mp31,mkgilligan,2,Mon Apr 6 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"but with the loss of private Andersmith, caboose will never fully recover."
RedvsBlue,31mp31,TodtheT1000,5,Mon Apr 6 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"He was always dimwitted and slower than the others, being a rookie I believe he was suppose to reflect Donut being the idiot of Red. There is much debate on how Caboose came to be so stupid but the AI definitely damaged his mind. I wouldn't say he's insane, when I think insane I think Sarge. I'd say he's more detached from reality, VERY detached from reality."
RedvsBlue,31mp31,SmokeySmokes,4,Mon Apr 6 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"Joel has said before that Caboose is the only one that realizes they are in a video game. Canonically I'm sure it had something to do with Omega, Church, and Tex battling in his mind."
RedvsBlue,31mp31,ChriosM,5,Mon Apr 6 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah for sure. I can't remember his exact words but I remember Sarge saying something about O'Malley taking the furniture, and everything else, when he left."
RedvsBlue,31mp31,SmokeySmokes,2,Mon Apr 6 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's from the episode where he and Caboose are in Battle Creek with those Reds and Blues that keep killing each other and then respawning! That is still one of my favorite episodes!"
RedvsBlue,31mp31,ChriosM,4,Mon Apr 6 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"Seems relevant... ish  Though it doesn't really go into the difference after season one, most attribute it to having O'Malley in his head. He was brain damaged before, but having O'Malley in his head really messed him up."
RedvsBlue,31mp31,eldest_gruff,3,Mon Apr 6 17:33:08 2015 UTC,Killing Church broke his sanity. He couldn't cope with the loss so he committed himself to a child like mentality in order to repress his feelings.  Seeing Church brought back as a ghost brought half of his adult hood up but left the other half as a child. This causes him to appear both child like and dumb while at the same time being able to fix and understand complex machinery.
RedvsBlue,31mp31,Stunsthename,2,Mon Apr 6 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"It's been theorized that Caboose is extremely susceptible to the AIs and their influence and this causes Caboose's strange attitudes for some seasons.   I would explain more but I'm not sure how far you've watched, I don't want to spoil anything!"
RedvsBlue,31mp31,Dexta_Grif,2,Mon Apr 6 16:11:12 2015 UTC,"Flanderization. All the characters become more unique, and their personalities show more as the series goes on.  That's honestly not a negative thing, as the characters weren't all that well defined in the first season."

RedvsBlue,31mp31,gamefanatic,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:50:02 2015 UTC,One theory is that after killing Church it affected him mentally with something like PTSD.
RedvsBlue,31mp31,Kenmister1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"Like any first season of a show, it's about finding the tone & character.  A lot of first seasons of shows are markedly different they what they morphed into (check out Seinfeld, Community, Park & Rec, etc.).  Having just re-watched the whole series, it does amaze me how much it's morphed from the original concept of a sketch show to a full-on action comedy."

RedvsBlue,31n32u,Nemo94,10,Mon Apr 6 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"It probably has something to do with the fact that he thought he was a ghost. Or because they didn't establish the whole ""ai are small"" thing until out of mind and suddenly changing his size would've been suspicious. Alpha only had one moment of being tiny, right at the end of his existence, while Epsilon only had two moments of being big, in the holo-chamber and right at the very end of season 10 when he and Carolina are talking. I don't know, it probably didn't happen for any specific reason other than aesthetics. Or the fact that ghost church was made by filming the same scene twice, one with him and one without, so getting a different size would've been tricky.  TL;DR: Lots of reasons. Nothing concrete."
RedvsBlue,31n32u,boxesofboxes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"Epsilon was also big when he possessed Grif in S12.   Although, it did give him a ""headache""..."
RedvsBlue,31n32u,TaylorCulosis,4,Mon Apr 6 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"You're confusing epsilon with alpha a little. Epsilon becomes life sized when he gets all of the alpha's memories. Alpha becomes miniature only at the end of Reconstruction when he's with Wash. This could be because Wash doesn't let AI's into his head like the others do so he's forced to work on only the armor slot and not the implant. Not a perfect explanation I know, but it's the best one I've got"
RedvsBlue,31n32u,beregond23,2,Mon Apr 6 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"I believe the implant and armour slot work alongside each other, Alpha was able to see Wash's thoughts when he was in there as he recommended a psychiatrist"
RedvsBlue,31n32u,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"I think Wash let Alpha into his head. He only told Project Freelancer he'd never let an A.I. into his head so they'd never learn that he knew about the torture.   IIRC, Church even says something about Wash having some emotional problems or something, so he'd have to have been in with Wash."
RedvsBlue,31n32u,PrinceCheddar,2,Mon Apr 6 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"Alpha can project himself out into Human size when he transfers between bodies. When he was not inhabiting/possessing a body and was instead in someones neural implant he would be projected like a regular AI, although he still had to ability to become large again.   Epsilon was able to copy this trait due to being a copy of Alpha."
RedvsBlue,31n32u,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:45:33 2015 UTC,It's so simple that might just work.
RedvsBlue,31n32u,Crimson_Raven_Fox,2,Wed Apr 8 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"well hes a holographic projection he could be as big as he wants, or anything he wants  but presumably its a waste of effort to show himself as godzilla"
RedvsBlue,31n32u,Forikorder,2,Mon Apr 6 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"He can project himself as human sized, or A.I. sized.  He was always human sized when he thought he was a ghost, he didn't believe he was an A.I., so why shouldn't he be human sized?  Now he's not only learned about his true nature, but he's also come to terms with it. He's comfortable being an A.I., and he's happy being projected at A.I. size.  Presumably he needs to go human sized to do certain things though."
RedvsBlue,31n32u,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:46:26 2015 UTC,Could it be that when inside someone's helmet he is small and when he is just out of a helmet on his own he is big?  That would explain why he's usually small in season 12 because he is with Carolina and becomes big when he moves from her to Grif
RedvsBlue,31n32u,ThaGreatIsaiah,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:46:54 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with the neural-implant memory units. Alpha Church also did the same thing, when he ""possessed"" someone, he didn't project his ""ghost"". Washington, at the end of Reconstruction, was the only exception. The first time Epsilon becomes miniature is when he uses Tucker's armor to store himself."
RedvsBlue,31mn6s,KidGrey,12,Mon Apr 6 14:07:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was a joke, because of the obvious name Tex(as)"
RedvsBlue,31mn6s,Dan_Of_Time,9,Mon Apr 6 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Burnie commented after that it was a mistake for Tex to make a joke because the audience viewed her as such a serious character that wouldn't make a joke.  Personally I think the joke was fine, it just needed another second before passing on to the next line of dialogue."
RedvsBlue,31mn6s,TodtheT1000,4,Mon Apr 6 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like even though she was viewed as such a serious character, the joke was still fine because it was such a jab at how stupid Tucker's question was. To me it seemed that it was sarcastic enough and warranted enough not to make her seem like a silly character."
RedvsBlue,31mn6s,agt_mothman,3,Mon Apr 6 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agreed. They even get into the whole ""Tex"" ""Allison"" thing in season 9 or 10."

RedvsBlue,31lft2,CrackedAbyss,3,Mon Apr 6 04:28:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the meta is assumed dead, but if his gel layer locked like it's supposed to during a fall, he could have survived that drop easily. We've seen Spartans fall from space and survive without the use of an AI. As much as I loved the meta, I hope he does not return because they wrapped up his story so well and I feel like that would be lazy writing wise, I would much rather see a new character. Also, Charon Industries is an umbrella conglomerate which has made appearances since season 9, they can say they have experience with nearly EVERYTHING. As for the real Allison, the only time we've seen her was in Season 10 where she was played by Lindsay Hicks. All of the other Tex's we've seen have been memories, byproducts of Alpha fragments. It was implied that Allison was killed after she was shipped out, so maybe Charon could have taken some bodies for research and very well may be in possession of the real Tex."
RedvsBlue,31lft2,Chaos_Construct,2,Mon Apr 6 08:18:43 2015 UTC,"I've always kind of suspected that he might come back at some point because we never saw a body. We saw him go over a cliff, in a similar(but far more drastic) fashion to the way he attempted to kill Carolina. But that's it. Presumed dead, even though he's lived through quite a bit worse.  That comment about Charon dabbling in cryogenics AND the scene after the Season 12 credits showing Maine's helmet on a screen makes me think that it's not only possible, but likely.  I doubt the whole Allison bit though. It's a bit of a stretch."
RedvsBlue,31lft2,graywolfe42,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:51:48 2015 UTC,"i know it's a strech, really it's not even a full theory, but that line just really stuck out to me. and the only characters that are ""DEAD"" (characters we see die but do not see any sort of evidence of a body) Are Maine and Alison."
RedvsBlue,31lft2,TodtheT1000,2,Mon Apr 6 12:28:13 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about the real Allison but I think that if she was alive to any extent, the director would be focusing on repairing her body not bringing her back to life.   The director must truly believe that she is dead, and if she was in cryo storage, he would know about it.  I do think that the real Allison is still alive though."
RedvsBlue,31lft2,nightmare901,2,Mon Apr 6 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"It would explain the friction between the Director and the Chairman. If the Chairman had Allison in cryogenic suspension, but refused to let Church wake her up.

Unless they take a break mid season (for 12 weeks, absolute minimum), or they have done a deal with 343i/Microsoft to get access early (they could have done, given that Rooster Teeth have previously produced RvB side content as adverts for Halo games) it can't happen."
RedvsBlue,31lrds,astalavista114,9,Mon Apr 6 07:20:18 2015 UTC,"Probably 22 episodes, then we have about 4-5 PSA's"
RedvsBlue,31lrds,Dan_Of_Time,4,Mon Apr 6 08:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point.  They got early access to Halo 4 for some PSAs when S10 was running, though, so a peek at H5 RvB isn't out of the question."
RedvsBlue,31lrds,_masterofdisaster,3,Mon Apr 6 07:32:34 2015 UTC,I just kinda assumed Rooster Teeth got early access to the games. It's the least 343 could do.

The episode number they usually shoot for is 19, with 4 PSAs.  (As Dan_Of_Time mentioned)  The early access thing is certainly possible, as they did with Halo 4 at the end of Season 10.

That said, I very much doubt they are going to do a 32 episode season to have the last episode after Halo 5 releases. It is much more likely that 343I/Microsoft have arranged for them to get advanced copies (even if it is just a Beta build, so they can do that one scene at the end)."

What really sent him on a downward slope was the forceful removal of Omega. I mean, it's clear that the three A.I.s inhabiting him at the same time did some damage. When his mental image of Church was killed within Caboose's mind, he temporarily forgot who Caboose was.  And I don't remember the exact line, but when the Blues are talking to Sarge about Caboose, they make mention of Omega and Sarge made a joke about how Omega must've ripped up the wallpaper on his way out or something like that.  I don't know...maybe I'm thinking too hard about a joke, but there's still some evidence that he was only as dumb as Donut at the beginning."

He can pick up the bomb when Tex couldn't, mowed down Tex's in the 100 Tex battle like it was nothing - and Tex seems to have been one of the strongest characters in the show and Caboose was substantially stronger than her.  Adding to this - there are a few parallels between Caboose and Lenny from Of Mice and Men, and honestly, I think that if Church told Caboose to defend himself against Maine (In the vein of George getting Lenny to do the same against Curley), then Maine would probably be fucked."

RedvsBlue,31jhat,MothaFuckingSorcerer,4,Thu May 7 05:34:30 2015 UTC,"You have to think with the 100 Tex battle which is the main source for figuring out his strength (its the most bad ass) you need to take a few things into consideration. Church his best friend and he was instructing him so Caboose is pretty likely to comply (or at least try to) not to mention Church/Epsilon went into him and kinda became like a O'Mally situation and AI do enhance the soldiers they are in.   The Tex's he fought where not the ""real Tex"" Carolina mowed a fair few down before they overwhelmed her, Carolina who would get her shit fucked by one of the real Tex (listen to the lyrics). The robots where rejects messed up copy's made in the Directors crazy period.   That considered I really don't see any way to legitimately figure out how strong he is since he was given some for of enhancement from Church/Epsilon and was fighting Tex robots that where in some way weaker, we have nothing really to use as a benchmark, we don't know how much weaker the robots were to the Tex we all know and love or how much impact Church/Epsilon actually had in him."

Wash didn't have an AI and doesn't seem the type to take the risk of using equipment without one. But he does activate it with a ground pound so who knows.

He also seems to be a pretty good leader, as even the Reds seem to fall under his command when he shows up."

I remember reading this somewhere (it might be on the same page of that link) but as to his rank on the leader board, I think it has to do with not caring about the leader board and just getting the job done.  He might not get and special or specific tasks (like lock-picking with York, sniping like North) but whatever tasks he's given, he gets it completely successful (wheras compared to North, who is often paired up with his sister, has a meh control of his sister's temper on the field which causes drawbracks like the lack of stealth. That would make the mission not completely  successful), despite North's special skill set)."

As in when thrown into a completely unknown scenario his does well just reacting. This is seen more in the present day timelines then in the flashbacks to project freelancer. Such as him shooting down a Hornet in Valhalla, he also did this as he was falling off a skyscraper as well.   That's what I can remember off the top of my head."
RedvsBlue,31kfkj,Ginnipe,2,Wed Apr 8 05:35:54 2015 UTC,Wash shot down an airship while free falling and spinning on the sarcophagus.   He also took down another with a pistol.  He's always been a ridiculously good shot.

RedvsBlue,31kv6g,TheRedditorer,21,Mon Apr 6 01:21:20 2015 UTC,"It should be stated that RvB is technically fan-fiction. So it's not going to fit directly into the Halo canon, and the writer's don't intend it to.   In any case, Wash summarizes it pretty well in Reconstruction:  ""At the end of the war, things didn't look good for humans. And there were dozens of projects all trying to come up with the magic bullet to win.""  ""Project Freelancer was one of them. They had their research with agressive A.I. But they could only get the one, and they needed more to conduct their experiments. So, they got desperate.""  Halo 3 saw the resolution of the war between the UNSC and the Covenant; Project Freelancer was another military project that attempted to do just that. (Not unlike the Spartan project, although definitely less vital/successful.)"
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,TaylorCulosis,6,Mon Apr 6 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'd put Projevt Freelancer down as a complete failure, primarily due to the fact that despite the deck being stacked massively in their favour, every freelancer that has gone up against the Blood Gulch sim troopers failed. Wyoming got killed, Tex got killed, Maine (post Meta) got the crap kicked out of him, and may or may not be dead, Wash lost to the Reds and Blue a couple of times before switching sides again. Furthermore, South killed North, and Maine rounded up all the AI fragments he could get his hands on as Sigma went rampant.   That said if they hadn't been using AI fragments, but rather full AI, they probably would have done a lot better. Alpha was largely stable, as was Beta, since they were both basically fully formed AI (even if Alpha had lost some of the furniture), and Epsilon seems stable, since he ""remembers"" the rest of the AI fragments, so is kind of a whole AI (but is definitely not metastable). A lot of their problems stem from the fact that they were using fragmented AIs. The Mother of Invention crashed because the fragments started getting their agents to find the Alpha, the Meta came into existence because Sigma figured out how to become metastable, and, being pure cunning, convinced the other fragments to join him. And if that hadn't happened, the Chairman wouldn't have been called in to investigate Outpost 17B, which wouldn't have prompted Wash to go find Church, which wouldn't have prompted him to organise the destruction of Freelancer Command, and the effective termination of the rest of the project."
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,astalavista114,3,Mon Apr 6 03:45:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say project freelancer was a failure, while most did lose to the sim troops, that's only 1 failure.  I'll use Burnie's superman theory to help explain it. Superman has to save the world every time and can't fail once. If he fails once the world is destroyed.  The fact that the Freelancers have failed once doesn't mean they're failures because they've had many successes in the past. They're a well trained and strong team that has accomplished many missions and killed a lot of people."
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,TodtheT1000,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:28:39 2015 UTC,The Director himself stated that it was a faliure but not for the reasons stated above.
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,thechoudharage,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"It's funny though. The SPARTAN-II program wasn't intended to combat the Covenant; they were super soldiers bred for battling insurrectionists.  The SPARTAN-IIIs, however, were. They were orphaned by the Covenant (which also gave them a personal vendetta), and relatively young (10-12)."
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,ChronicRedhead,6,Mon Apr 6 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how helpful this is, but in Reach there is a document apparently written by Dr. Halsey mentioning the soldiers of Blood Gulch and that she ""fears for their sanity"". It's really more of a nod to the series than any acceptable canon link stuff because there is no mention of Project Freelancer. This kinda contradicts my theory of Freelancer being a companion project to the SPARTAN IV's (which would include pretty much every character as a IV). I suppose that would put RvB taking place after the events of Halo 3 for sure and probably after the new trilogy. I don't have much evidence to back that up, so if I'm missing something feel free to correct me."
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,sherman8492,2,Mon Apr 6 05:44:18 2015 UTC,I think that the Freelancer project starts around the time of the beginning of halo 2...ish maybe halo 1. at least that is where i put the project
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,Swaffire,2,Mon Apr 6 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's the very first episode where Grif says he joined the army to kill aliens, but Master Chief already killed them all. That tells me it started shortly after the end of Halo One. That would mean the Freelancer saga occurred years before halo 1 probably around the time the Covenant frist started making contact with the UNSC. It might have been a UNSC splinter group attempting to make their own SPARTAN super soldier, or trying to recreate the SPARTAN II program. They obviously failed but it's an interesting theory. That would make the Freelancers around the same age as Master Chief or more likely younger."
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,SmokeySmokes,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:04:24 2015 UTC,It would also make sense that Church would want his own super soldiers to get back at the Covenant for killing Allison (if that's how she ended up dying) and could be the driving factor of why Project Freelancer existed in the first place.
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,SmokeySmokes,2,Mon Apr 6 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"It would be highly difficult to justify it being canonical. Between highly expensive armor being so universal, AI theory inconsistencies, and especially post human covanent events, the evidence is just not there. In the RvB universe the UNSC is less prominent even to the point where the reds had never heard of them, which could be attributed to stupidity, but then again I doubt they could be that ignorant. We also have never seen ONI which would have (in the halo universe) been in charge of oversight of top secret programs as opposed to a UNSC subcomitee. Another inconsistency is equipment, in RvB AI are required to run equipment/armor abilities(until late in the series and after the HvC war), but in Halo they are self regulating even before the end of the Human Covanent war.  To me it doesn't really matter if its canon or not. Red Vs Blue is a comedy, and making it canon would limit a lot of possibilities."
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,jay_of_walker,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:10:14 2015 UTC,I think you guys should watch the new episodes of season 13 ;)
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,G3yost,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:49:46 2015 UTC,I believe that the rvb story at least bgc is halo cannon. Try halopedia for starters.
RedvsBlue,31kv6g,forrestib,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"I personally like RVB mythology better than the new stupid Halo 4 mythology. I think RVB got it right by expanding the parts of the world that relate to people, instead of just telling us stories about war and crud. In a lot of ways I feel Halo has tried to copy RVB of late, with Halsey somewhat filling the Director's shoes, and the canonization of the red and blue training armies themselves. But I think they fall short every time. If Red Vs Blue is fanfiction, it's the only fanfiction I can say with confidence has vastly overshadowed its source material in quality, mythology, storytelling, and character."
RedvsBlue,31j97m,ElskeFryst,29,Sun Apr 5 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"I like seeing Sarge out with Tucker and Carolina, I like the chemistry. Also I love the small bits of Animation Epsilon gets!"

RedvsBlue,31j97m,Agent-Vermont,4,Sun Apr 5 22:52:06 2015 UTC,"As much as i like seeing her pissed and fighting (Reminds me of Tex) we never really saw Tex ""happy"" so I like seeing the character development of her when she isn't pissed off."
RedvsBlue,31j97m,ilivetofly,26,Sun Apr 12 16:05:06 2015 UTC,Tucker got moves. And let's just take a moment to appreciate that this is basically the first city-scene we've ever had in RvB!
RedvsBlue,31j97m,professionalecho,27,Sun Apr 5 22:36:07 2015 UTC,Had to make one. I can't stop watching it.

RedvsBlue,31j97m,ilivetofly,6,Mon Apr 6 03:54:57 2015 UTC,Does season 9 episode 14-17 not count as a city-scene? They drive on the freeway past a lot of civilians after all.
RedvsBlue,31j97m,KikoTheGreat,3,Tue Apr 7 02:53:13 2015 UTC,I think it does but its kinda not the same I mean the Reds and Blues aren't there its like it happened in another place and time so... Idk its hard to express my feelings on it in words but its nice having the Reds and Blues in a city like space.
RedvsBlue,31j97m,ilivetofly,2,Sun Apr 12 16:06:49 2015 UTC,It is pretty cool.

I hope we see Dr. Grey soon, I think she's the only important character from last season that we have yet to see! Edit: Somehow forgot about Caboose! We'll probably see him in the next episode though. Edit2: He was in the first episode, that's why.  I also am a fan of this unlikely friendship between Sarge and Tucker. I'm betting the Reds and Blues are going to play an important role in keeping the peace between the two sides. Which sounds very ironic.  Also the small bits of added animation really add to the show. The Lieutenants after their run, Tucker's dancing and Sarge... They give the characters a little more life that I really appreciate."

A light, humorous episode in light of the previous one is always appreciated, but I can't wait to see what they've been doing at that research base. I haven't played any Halo games so I'm not too sure what that thing at the end was, but hopefully we get to see that next week. Also gotta say, Tucker has got some moves!  Also, we haven't seen Caboose yet!"
RedvsBlue,31j97m,Dan_Of_Time,17,Sun Apr 5 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"But we saw Caboose right at the end of Episode 1. Dunno what he was doing, but I'm assuming he was channeling his inner strength to observe the events aboard the Tartarus via his mind in an effort to assess the actions of his enemies. Unfortunately, he was interrupted by Grif, hence the startled scream."
RedvsBlue,31j97m,SkyriderRJM,3,Sun Apr 5 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"Right, I guess I meant in episode 2, although it could be inferred that he's probably at the city with the rest of them."

RedvsBlue,31jjgg,SmokeySmokes,14,Sun Apr 5 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"It was explained in Revelation that ""The candidates for Red and Blue squads will be culled from enlisted army ranks based on low test scores and poor field skills-"".  They're just a bunch of ordinary folks that signed up for the military and got thrown into some false war and the ensuing misadventures it would bring. But unlike the others, they survived and in doing so, formed a sort of brotherhood. The series thus far, is their backstory.   Tucker is probably the most capable of the bunch, but that didn't happen overnight, he grew into it. As a chosen one, a single father,  and in general, a hapless heroic.   As for backstory beyond the military, it might be worth checking the wikia. A lot of information from the DVD character bios is stored and summarized there.  ""Prior to the series, Caboose was born and raised in a colony on the moon with 17 sisters. He joined the army after mistaking a recruiting center for college."""
RedvsBlue,31jjgg,TaylorCulosis,0,Sun Apr 5 18:59:00 2015 UTC,That's true but what if that's just the back story project freelancer gave them? They are far from ordinary people and have managed to beat The Freelancers and Cohen time and time again. Just doesn't seem like your average every day person and I'm pretty sure it's known that Sarge had prior military service before going to Blood Gulch?
RedvsBlue,31jjgg,TaylorCulosis,4,Sun Apr 5 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"The only person that ever had their memories tampered with in the entire series is the Alpha. I wouldn't assume that is the rule.   I think if they had revealed each of them to be a part of the PFL backstory, they would've already done it (during the PFL Saga). And in doing so, they'd probably lose a lot of relatability. Additionally, hurting all of the development they've went though.  They were ordinary, but they grew from there, it'd be really lame if that was all predestined.    Edit: Sarge found out that his entire military career was a lie. He was never a real soldier. He likely operated at another Red base."
RedvsBlue,31jjgg,Samocoptor,-1,Sun Apr 5 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"All valid points (and thanks for clarifying Sarge and his military career). I was thinking more along the lines as it wouldn't be revealed until the very end. Maybe the last cut scene of all of them in freelancer armor as a big final reveal? I just don't like the ordinary person aspect, they just don't seem ordinary at all. They all have specific traits that would be far above average in any normal human. Maybe I'm just reading to much into it?"
RedvsBlue,31jjgg,ShiroiTora,3,Sun Apr 5 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, to use one example Donut is good at throwing... a lot of people are good at throwing. Hardly an 'above average' trait. It just seems you're making a little bit of a stretch here."

RedvsBlue,31itua,Daddy_Frank,3,Sun Apr 5 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"What got me thinking about it was, Allison never appeared in the show except for a pre-recorded video.  She is such a big part of the background and story but never appeared, and not much details are given about her.  I think that the real Allison wouldn't be a badass to the level Tex was. The real Allison was just a normal soldier not a freelancer. Tex is essentially the Director's perception of Allison. It wouldn't be surprising that the Director's perception of Allison would be more bad ass than she actually was.  They could be 2 totally different characters."
RedvsBlue,31itua,astalavista114,3,Sun Apr 5 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"Isn't one of the key points about Tex that she always fails just before Alison succeeds because that's how she died (or at least how The Director remembered her death) so when Beta split off from Alpha, she always fails just before she succeeds, and then Epsilon Beta does the same, because that's how Caboose and Epsilon remember Beta. I need to double check it, but I think that Epsilon Beta is currently combined with the rest of Epsilon, so it is possible that in future we will see a version of Tex that doesn't always fail at the last second."

This version of Tex (Project Freelancer/Blood Gulch) was then destroyed alongside all the Fragments and Alpha.  Next up we have the excluded fragment Epsilon, stuff happens and then history repeats itself, as Epsilon is the same as Alpha, another byproduct is made, this being the Tex from season 8. Epsilon had Caboose transfer this byproduct into her body which was stored in the facility. She was then ""Forgotten"" by epsilon at the end of S9."

RedvsBlue,31dbmu,ilivetofly,14,Sat Apr 4 14:12:33 2015 UTC,Don't forget he's the only(original) Blue that hasn't died. Still Caboose for the win
RedvsBlue,31dbmu,SmokeySmokes,16,Sat Apr 4 03:29:18 2015 UTC,Is anyone else forgetting that fact that he is BLACK?  Tucker is also my favorite character as well. He's the most reflective of the group and actually grows as a character along side Wash. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with his character in this season.
RedvsBlue,31dbmu,Odd_Tactics,5,Sat Apr 4 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"We do not know if he is black or not, we can only speculate! Personally I imagine him as a really nerdy white guy pretending to be black.

RedvsBlue,31dbmu,WoolyBabby,4,Sun Apr 5 06:42:54 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he mentioned being black somewhere back in BCC. But I could be mistaken.
RedvsBlue,31dbmu,Odd_Tactics,2,Sun Apr 5 07:03:06 2015 UTC,Tucker asks if Church assumes he's black. Tucker doesn't confirm or disagree which is why it's speculatied

RedvsBlue,31dbmu,Odd_Tactics,2,Sun Apr 5 15:51:57 2015 UTC,There's a couple more moments in the series where it's implied that he's black.
RedvsBlue,31dbmu,Rogan_McFlubbin,2,Tue Apr 7 03:00:45 2015 UTC,I think someone asked him if he was black but he didn't give a straight answer.
RedvsBlue,31dbmu,WoolyBabby,4,Mon Apr 6 14:00:47 2015 UTC,I hope the character development continues and he keeps on getting better as a fighter with the help of Wash
RedvsBlue,31dbmu,mkgilligan,6,Sat Apr 4 22:45:09 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I kind of hope for a Tucker v. Felix rematch

I can see why Alpha's spare bodies were robot bodies inside armour, but wouldn't it have been easier for Epsilon to have just built a full robot inside the armour, rather than leaving it as a separate body? This would make it impossible for Wash to actually fit inside Epsilon Church's armour. Also, why didn't the UNSC notice that there was a robot inside the armour?"

RedvsBlue,31dbmu,amanguupta53,2,Sat Apr 4 04:58:48 2015 UTC,That doesn't make them married. I was confused seeing the point.

RedvsBlue,31ci70,Babirusa1,3,Fri Apr 3 20:51:34 2015 UTC,Puts the finger on why I like Caboose so much more than other exaggerated 'stupid' characters. He has so much more to him than just how funny he is.
RedvsBlue,31ci70,SmokeySmokes,3,Fri Apr 3 21:09:30 2015 UTC,"What makes Caboose special is his uniqueness. He isn't some run of the mill idiot he's also an intriguing character and obviously has the most heart out of any of the redvsblue characters. A great example is in season 12 when he gives Tucker a motivational speech. He gets laughed at and yes it was stupid but it's what motivated Tucker to make up with Church. He's probably the only Blue Sarge actually likes, was the first to really befriend Wash and is the only one who genuinely gets along with everyone aside from Donut (I want a petition going for more Caboose and Donut moments). Bottom line, Caboose for president"
RedvsBlue,31ci70,chimney3,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:15:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, good point... how many times have Cabose and D00nut ever talked? There was the time Donut got their flag.... anything else?"
RedvsBlue,31ci70,SmokeySmokes,2,Sat Apr 4 04:20:49 2015 UTC,There have been way to few times and it's usually here and there. Like Caboose and his motivational speech Donut seemed to be the only one who wanted to hear it. They need to have a Caboose and Donut adventure at some point because that would be hilarious
RedvsBlue,31d9gx,ThatIckyGuy,10,Fri Apr 3 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"I do believe that Carolina knows that Leonard is her father. At the end of season ten when she leaves him her pistol she gives him a kiss on the forehead. I do also think that Epsilon and Carolina do regard each other in a sibling sort of way.   I believe that Carolina did not know who Tex was until she found out that Tex was an AI and an AI based on her mother at that. during the years Carolina and all the Freelancers were still together I think her hatred of Tex was out of competitiveness and the fact that Tex did get special treatment from the Director.   After season 10 when Carolina and Epsilon are on the mountain talking after their ship when down on Chorus the two seem to be having a lighthearted conversation. They even joke about how Carolina's mother was a smart women but had  bad taste in men. Another line that leads me to believe that Carolina knows that Tex was based on her bother is that Tex in parts of the series says that she doesn't like saying goodbye. Then before Carolina and Epsilon leave with Epsilon wanting to say goodbye, Carolina stops him and says ""...and when she left she never said goodbye to me. Instead she always told me, never say goodbye if you don't say goodbye then you aren't really gone you just aren't here right now."""
RedvsBlue,31d9gx,sirmonkey95,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"just want to drop by and say i agree with you completely dude but the whole situation makes me sad I really liked Tex and she got fucked and EMP'd and then forgot. I also really like Carolina, her and epsilon seeing one another as siblings fts well for me I didnt pick up on that even though he called her sis I just figured it was a pet name of sorts (kinda how everyone called Grif's sis, sister even though she wasn't related to everyone in the canyon)"
RedvsBlue,31d9gx,ilivetofly,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"she saids ""did i ever tell you about my mother?"" which would be a dumb question if she knew her mother was Tex i dont think she knows, and i dont think Epsilon ever wanted to bring it up"
RedvsBlue,31d9gx,Forikorder,2,Sun Apr 5 05:11:17 2015 UTC,"All signs point to Carolina knowing about her relationship to the Director.  Later on, after she starts her mission to ""Kill the Director"" she seems to hate Tex because in her eyes, Tex is a perversion of her mother.  Tex was created as a by product of the process that made Alpha.  And the fact that the Director obsessed over Tex, even going so far as to give her preferential treatment, probably felt like he was betraying Carolina."

As a result, this season is significantly more detailed than any prior season."

I don't know if it was easier to blend animation with ingame footage in 3, but there were times in the halo 3 seasons where the animation was completely flush with the game and it looked amazing. The animation from seasons 12 on looks really fake, off, and noticeable, don't know if its the animation style or program, or if halo 4 is just harder to replicate."

RedvsBlue,31d8ml,Dan_Of_Time,3,Sat Apr 4 00:06:58 2015 UTC,It was a fairly quick scene and it was quite hard to spot the individual AIs.
RedvsBlue,31aygn,RexPythonem,15,Fri Apr 3 12:49:23 2015 UTC,"There is no reason given, perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Tex/Beta is considered to be (by some fans) Metastable   To quote the wiki; The fourth and final stage of rampancy is metastability, in which an A.I. can, theoretically, be considered a human being.  If this is the case for Tex then there would be no reason as to why she couldn't be implanted with an A.I. fragment"
RedvsBlue,31aygn,ilivetofly,4,Fri Apr 3 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"Aahhh! That makes so much sense. I need to totally reach the series again... I totally forgot about Metastability. I honestly want to understand why Epsilon is not, then, considered as reaching Metastability. Then again I guess he never truly entered Rampency per say. And since Alpha and Beta are created in a (theoretically) similar way to Cortana in the sense that they are based off of human intelligence, which allows them to ""feel/show emotion"" even without entering rampency. There is a lot of AI information that makes sense from RvB, and so much we don't yet understand. I also beleive, after the trailer for Season 13, that Epsilon might actually reach full Metastability by the end of this next season."
RedvsBlue,31aygn,ilivetofly,3,Fri Apr 3 14:04:34 2015 UTC,"He may, I think he thinks he is like the alpha based off this episode but in the episode delta says ""I am just a memory of delta"" so I don't think he is all the way there yet, who know's."

It might be a different case for 'full' AI, but we have no way of knowing that right now."
RedvsBlue,31aygn,ElskeFryst,6,Fri Apr 3 13:20:37 2015 UTC,"Tex is not a fragment of Alpha, she was a byproduct, so a completely separate 'person'. Might not completely answer the question but it might help the fact that Tex is able to use an AI."
RedvsBlue,31aygn,ElskeFryst,3,Fri Apr 3 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"She was, wasn't she... she was a byproduct of Alpha/Leonard's memory of Allison. It's obvious that she is almost like a second Alpha, but more of a sub-alpha, because she's technically not a fragment of the Alpha. That would make her like a nearly whole AI."

RedvsBlue,31aygn,TodtheT1000,6,Fri Apr 3 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"An AI is based on a real person, taking their personality, memories, pretty much everything that makes them who they are.  Project Freelancer was allowed to create 1 full AI who was based on the director. The director ""split"" Alpha through torture into different fragments that contained different parts of Alpha's mind and personality.  Allison was the Directors wife/gf who died. Allison was a person who the director obviously loved a lot and left such a big impression on the director. So when the director had an AI made  based on himself, Tex or Beta was produced as a side product. She isn't a fragment of the alpha, she is a side product of the process that created the Alpha.  On a bit of a tangent, Tex being a side product of the process to create Alpha is what gave the director the idea of ""splitting"" Alpha to get multiple AI.  Tex was given her own robot body, which in turn had it's own AI slot. That's why she could have an AI.  When Omega tried to jump to Church, it had no effect because Omega came from him as you correctly said.   It is designed that an AI and a Freelance work together, one isn't directly in control of eachother. However the reason Omega can take control of people is because Omega is the Alpha's anger. While getting tortured his Anger only grew, so when it split off Omega was one of the most powerful AI's. This is also why he can jump bodies in the same way Alpha and Tex does. Because he's so powerful he can control people and impose his will on them.  I think I answered everyone of your questions. Just respond if I missed one or if you have another."
RedvsBlue,31aygn,Dan_Of_Time,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"I especially like your answer. The only quedtion I have now is why is it that when Tex had Omega did it seem like instead of direct control, the two worked together mutually? Thats about the only thing I don't understand now. :P"
RedvsBlue,31aygn,spiral6,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"When Tex and Omega were together through Project Freelancer, they had similar if not the same goals. The goal of completing the mission.

RedvsBlue,31aygn,ThatIckyGuy,3,Tue Apr 14 13:03:21 2015 UTC,"I think it would work on like a level system, I can't see why a stronger AI can't control a weaker one. Since Tex is on par with Alpha due to being a byproduct she shouldn't have any problem controlling the fragment.  Maybe it's because she's a badass"

RedvsBlue,31aygn,astalavista114,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:04:36 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that during the PF plotline, Tex's AI was Omega, and she was still the Beta AI. They probably know they're both AIs, and work together to reach mutual ass kicking goals.   I assume the same happens at Blood Gulch, when she goes looking for Alpha Church."
RedvsBlue,31aygn,spiral6,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"When you think about, sending Tex to Blood Gulch probably wasn't the smartest move that Project Freelancer ever made."

RedvsBlue,319s03,Forikorder,3,Fri Apr 3 03:50:03 2015 UTC,"Church's monologue in the trailer seems to be from near the end of this season, as it indicates Hargrove will, at some point, become the FORMER Chairman (he is clearly the current Chairman in 13x01) and the RvB team is acting against him during the season. Don't be fooled from the Season 12 imagery in the trailer.  I think Hargrove is trying to INSTIGATE war with the Covenant again and his public speeches are one way he's trying to get that to happen. Maybe he was able to profit from the first war and wants to see it happen again. Or he hates the aliens and doesn't want peace, he wants them wiped out. Who knows.  Taking it a bit further, maybe he's Felix and Lotus' ""Command"", or at least in charge of Command. Would explain why the RvB teams, who are sure to get drawn into this mess with Felix and Lotus again, will end up pursuing Hargrove as well. This arrangement would provide him with a small army to perhaps stage fake Covenant attacks or who knows what in order to try and start a new war."

I'm 99% sure that he isn't Maine because he has no Meta tattoo, implant scars, or obviously disfigured throat (Maine was shot there repeatedly in season 9). I'm pretty sure he's still alive somewhere, but this guy is not him. It can't be York, Flowers/Florida, or Vic because none of them would be helpful from Price's point of view in taking down Wash and Carolina. It could be dig site CT in theory, but I think he is more likely to be dead than Sharkface. It also could very well be a new agent or Georgia, but the Freelancers seem like a pretty tight group and we never had any indications of another agent walking around (or that Georgia was still alive). I suppose he could have been a secret operative similar to Tex, but it doesn't really seem like Miles to write another character like that. And then there's what little actual evidence there is. The flame tattoos, flame damage-like scars, and obvious shark tattoos kinda point towards sharkface. Also, the scars on his face/busted eye are on the same side of the face that the gravity hammer thrown by Carolina hit Sharkface's helmet."

RedvsBlue,3191h3,thedoormanmusic32,18,Thu Apr 2 23:32:56 2015 UTC,"Leonard and Allison, yes.  Alpha and Beta, no. But they were literally together.  ""You're bound to have some residual memories. They're just not yours."" - Wash  ""No, man, she's just my girlfriend, ya know? We were gonna get married, but I got shipped out... ah, you know how it works."" - Church  ^ This is a reversal of how things actually went."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,TaylorCulosis,3,Thu Apr 2 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just finished s10 and it got me wondering. Thanks for confirming.   I love (no sarcasm intended) how they just ignore plot holes that are directly linked to established story.  Like when Wash tells Church that ghosts don't exist...even though Sarge was a ghost for like 5 mins.   Edit: because I don't want to take up another thread - is there any particular reason that we have yet to see any members of the nain cast (sans certain freelancers) unmasked? Personally I couldnt care less if we did or didn't,  but I do think it would be cool."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,TaylorCulosis,7,Thu Apr 2 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"Sarge wasn't a ghost, though. He was in a type of armor lock, similar to the one Donut was put in after his injury, and FILSS put the gang in following their encounter with Tex in Revelation.   Edit: The lead writers/directors said they didn't want to shatter people's perceptions of how they think established characters look. The answer is better in the minds of the viewer."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,TaylorCulosis,7,Thu Apr 2 23:53:08 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Thanks for the responses.   I think one great way to end the series would be for all of the cast to remove their helmets while sitting in a pelican en route to BG.  Tucker is Asian, much to Church's chagrin   ""I thought you said you were black!?""  ""No, you just assumed I was, you fucking racist!"""

RedvsBlue,3191h3,astalavista114,2,Fri Apr 3 00:07:46 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly suggest getting through S12 before someone ruins the surprises for you. Spoilers are getting to be very dangerous things in the RvB canon.
RedvsBlue,3191h3,ThatIckyGuy,3,Fri Apr 3 00:10:12 2015 UTC,Only 28mins to go.
RedvsBlue,3191h3,sqyguy,2,Fri Apr 3 00:13:53 2015 UTC,I think in a press conference they said they didnt want to show the Red's and Blue's without their armour.
RedvsBlue,3191h3,sqyguy,2,Fri Apr 3 13:49:36 2015 UTC,After Season 5 they retconned a lot of stuff to get their story for 6-10 to work. I'm surprised it still mostly works.
RedvsBlue,3191h3,ThatIckyGuy,3,Fri Apr 3 04:30:37 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like they retconned it, more like just ignored it."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,ThatIckyGuy,3,Fri Apr 3 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"No they retconned a ton of stuff. Off the top of my head:   Freelancers are mercenaries for hire. Retconned to be the name of Project Freelancer and the mercenaries who used that label became agents (Tex was the first). Though there is some connection between them made early on given Wyoming's name as a state, same as Tex's. (Side note: Tex claims in an early season Tex is her REAL name and Nevada is her codename. She could be snarking at the stupid question of what her code name is, though). Tex was changed from Church's ex-girlfriend into his would-be savior aboard the Mother of Invention crash site. It's implied when she meets him there he latches onto her agent name of ""Tex"" and remembers her later as his girlfriend (partially due to the Director's memories, as well, maybe). Church claims he was stationed at Sidewinder, which was later retconned to be the Mother of Invention, crashed. He wasn't serving, he was the ship AI. More memory mangling. Church dies and becomes a ghost. So does Tex. They can possess and control other people. They are later retconned to be AI and the possession is them using their abilities as AI to transfer themselves and take control of armor. Captain Flowers was the old leader of Blue team. Later retconned to be an undercover Freelancer agent there to keep an eye on Church. Some of the crazier time travel stuff in 1-5 was retconned as standard training exercises for Freelancer agents (the RvB teams discover this in the abandoned Freelancer site). O'Malley becomes Omega and Gary becomes Gamma. Then we get all the others, including Alpha and Beta, who we of course already met but conveniently never knew those names. Wyoming previously had no link to Gary IIRC but when the writers decided Freelancers got AI they suddenly got a backstory as being together, then quickly reunite.   Plenty more I'm sure. I think earlier than Season 6 they had SOME ideas that were developing as you can see them changing some things (freelancers have state names and hook up with AIs, Church doesn't change when O'Malley jumps into him), but it's only with the start of Season 6 do the major changes to the story direction happen.  Perhaps ""retcon"" was too strong a word. I don't mean intentionally ignoring previously established canon, I mean subtly changing it. Rooster Teeth has done a good job I think."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,Convic817,7,Fri Apr 3 05:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not quite retcon, moreso altering. Great part is, most of it fits into ""The Simulation Troops were deliberately misinformed"". They did a great job covering their bases."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,Convic817,5,Fri Apr 3 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"The Gamma/Gary-Wyoming link was established in Season 5, but by then I suspect they were already starting to think about The Recollection, because we'd had Out of Mind by then, which introduced us to York and Delta.   Project Freelancer was referenced early on (although not by name) with Church mentioning a conversation with Tex when she first joined the program, and then Wyoming interrupted it. Of course, what with Alpha's memory being all screwed/basically toast, we don't know what was and wasn't real."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,WoolyBabby,2,Fri Apr 3 10:33:40 2015 UTC,"(On mobile, so can't edit) the bit with Church not responding to Omega jumping into him was in Episode 100, by which time I'm sure they were thinking about Season 6, so that was probably laying the groundwork. What I'm curious to know is if Omega realised that Church was Alpha or not, and if so, if it passed that knowledge into the other components of The Meta. It certainly didn't recognise Tex as Beta."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,ThatIckyGuy,3,Fri Apr 3 10:36:44 2015 UTC,"I was too busy talking about Wash and the other freelancers in a different part of this to answer the question.  Well, everyone else mostly covered it, so I'll add my two cents: Yes and no. No because it never happened. Anything Church remembers as them dating is all mixed up with Leonard Church's memories.   Yes, because even though it's fake, the feelings for each other (though not immediately obvious) are still there. Anything Leonard Church felt for the real Alison is there for Church with Tex.  And as a result, Epsilon also feels the same about his Tex, which is why he has a hard time letting her go...or at least why it took him so long to realize he had to let her go."

The ""ghosts"" of them were just the physical world manifestations of the AIs Alpha and Beta. They were then able to enter the armors Sarge made them and continue to ""live"" until the EMP went off in season 6, which did destroy both of them along with all other known AIs and any other ones stored at the HQ, except for Epsilon which escaped with the Reds and Blues. The Church who exists now is only the memory of him created by Epsilon, which Carolina is currently carrying."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,astalavista114,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"Factually, would an EMP (pro: ehm-p) destroy an AI, or just incapacitate an shut down the host system?    This is a serious question. I have no fucking idea how that tech works irl."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,DBHT14,2,Fri Apr 3 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert in it at all. But with a quick scan of the Wikipedia page it does seem like your right in that the wave of electromagnetic energy fries more of the physical aspect of electronics.  But because of the way that the AIs function with there whole being and personility existing digitaly it's hard say whether it's possible for them to come back if someone with the right skill set were to come around. By the way Wash talks about the plan though and how it's presented in the show the AIs appear to be completly destroyed. But who knows maybe we'll get some crazy reappearance of what we thought was gone, which would definetly create some crazy situations due to everything with Epsilon."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,TaylorCulosis,2,Fri Apr 3 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"York was the tech expert. Wash was quoted as saying he was the worst of the Freelancers.  Hell, I'd love to see Church return as a fully (well, almost fully) intact Alpha."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,astalavista114,3,Fri Apr 3 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"Wash was quoted as saying he was the worst of the Freelancers.   I'm a huge Wash fan, so I pay attention to stuff like his stats and whatnot.  Wash is partially correct in saying this. There are something like 50 Freelancers (barring Flowers, of course) and Wash is in the top 10 or so. Wash was the worst of the best and always at the bottom of the board. But you're forgetting that there are 40 other Freelancers on top of other grunts that aren't considered freelancers.  On top of that, a couple of Freelancers were slipping in the rankings in some of the later seasons, which pushed Wash up. And that's how he got Epsilon. Otherwise he wouldn't have gotten Epsilon.   Wash is also a good shot, which is probably how he got in the top 10.  Sorry...I know I went off on a tangent, but I like Wash, so I felt the need to correct something. (He and Church are my two favorite characters in RVB.)"
RedvsBlue,3191h3,Convic817,2,Fri Apr 3 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"He's the worst in the rankings,  and ge got Epsilon because he made the board.   I love him too buddy."
RedvsBlue,3191h3,TaylorCulosis,2,Fri Apr 3 01:29:35 2015 UTC,"At least he made the list, right?"
RedvsBlue,3191h3,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, he fluctuated between number 5 & 6. He's been higher rank than Maine, North, South, and York at different times."

RedvsBlue,316tfz,luckyteep14,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:47:13 2015 UTC,"At this point I think Sharkface is for granted, and I want him to be the Director's deserter son that joined the Insurrection."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,1upIRL,3,Thu Apr 2 22:49:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Sharkface theory but on the badass level i think that they might use him as a mid-season enemy, like a stepping stone. They've done a lot of progression with the RvB characters fighting skills, especially Tucker. Now that they are preparing for war, I expect Wash and Carolina to give Tucker full on Freelancer training. Sharkface will probably be Tuckers ""Nemesis"" to show how he's progressed up to the fighting level of Wash, Felix, Carolina, and Locus, or at least getting there. This way they can have Tucker kick the shit outta Felix and it won't be completely out of nowhere."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,WoolyBabby,3,Thu Apr 2 22:19:04 2015 UTC,"Reds are friends, eat the blues!   I'm very excited for SharkFace and what will happen next."

RedvsBlue,316tfz,DrSoap,4,Thu Apr 2 17:59:19 2015 UTC,This guy. [2:08]
RedvsBlue,316tfz,TaylorCulosis,9,Thu Apr 2 18:14:37 2015 UTC,The fuck is with that guy?

RedvsBlue,316tfz,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:36:35 2015 UTC,And how do we have solid proof that they are the same person?
RedvsBlue,316tfz,SaintoftheUnderdog,5,Thu Apr 2 19:28:40 2015 UTC,Tattoo on his chest of the shark face he put on his helmet. Tattoo below his neck on his back matching the insignia on his chest plate. This comment from the main thread is rather convincing
RedvsBlue,316tfz,beregond23,0,Thu Apr 2 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a little skeptical. He's not exactly the best secret weapon out there, plus even if the hammer to the face didnt kill shark face, the mac round that leveled their building most certainly would have.  Still the best theory, don't get me wrong, but one that has equal holes and evidence."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,SaintoftheUnderdog,3,Thu Apr 2 19:48:27 2015 UTC,"Still, he's got the right build and motivation to be put in Maine's old armor and be menacing"
RedvsBlue,316tfz,beregond23,3,Thu Apr 2 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"Demoman survived a shot from the MoI and the resulting building collapse only losing an arm. I'm not really sure how badass each of the Insurrectionists was supposed to be, but Sharkface could have fled the building before being detained."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,TaylorCulosis,2,Thu Apr 2 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"Sharkface aside, some other topics to discuss:  What was the chairman talking about?  Felix and Locus gathering troops?  Counselor is working for Chairman's people now? Is he actually a turn cloak or is this a ruse to save his life?  Felix and Locus are off Chorus, Reds and Blues are still there."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,chimney3,2,Fri Apr 3 07:56:55 2015 UTC,"Perhaps sharkface (dragons breath for destiny fans) was kicked out of project freelancer early on.  This would explain why he has knowledge, and why he is pretty badarse but not as well trained as the freelancers. Also it would explain why he wanted to melt them so much."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,hypoferramia,0,Thu Apr 2 14:09:54 2015 UTC,Yes.  I like this.  Just a soldier who once fought the Freelancers is honestly pretty lame IMO.
RedvsBlue,316tfz,jkeyc,5,Thu Apr 2 14:36:17 2015 UTC,Well they also... killed all of his comrades. That's something.
RedvsBlue,316tfz,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think I found a way for Sharkface to be the Meta: Back when Wash had teamed up with the Meta, Maine had uploaded the remnants of his mind to a hard drive somewhere. Somehow, Locus and Felix have that hard drive and are going to force Sharkface to jack it in his head."
RedvsBlue,316tfz,bluepanda5,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"Well they have Maine's helmet, and presumably his entire suit of armour, so maybe we will be seeing Sharkface in Maine's armour?"
RedvsBlue,3158gg,thedoormanmusic32,43,Thu Apr 2 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"You mean, once they discovered that their following was great and vast enough to warrent an epic story, that they would find it within themselves to write and produce such an epic story; not done out of love/desire for money, but out of love of their craft and fans?  That they would also plan out this story in such a way as to keep said fans, laughing, crying, and awe-inspired in turns while never sacrificing their integrity or the style of humor that drew fans in in the first place?  That they could not only come up with jokes to keep the series going, but also be able to call back to old jokes in just the perfect way that would, simultainiously, make long-time fans say ""They called back to that? Awesome!"" and inspire new fans to go back to the older seasons and learn where all these referenses came from?  I guess, when it comes down to it, it really all boils down to one, simple question... Do you ever wonder why we're here?"

RedvsBlue,3158gg,TaylorCulosis,3,Thu Apr 2 02:26:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, Rooster Teeth does write the whole season all at once and they work very hard to make it be a seamless experience on DVDs or Netflix, but also can be viewed as a segmented show. Often, they won't complete a season before release so that they can move stuff around or add stuff where needed within the script. You may not realize this until you watch in it's entirety, or even with the commentary, but it sure is there."
RedvsBlue,3158gg,Chaos_Construct,4,Thu Apr 2 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"Generally, a basic plot for a series that's  intended to also be a movie is written before principal photography, allowing work towards a final goal to begin, while still giving breathing room for jokes to be written in. Source: I approach writing the same way (am working on a series) and am at school to be a screenwriter."
RedvsBlue,3158gg,JacksonSX35,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:07:35 2015 UTC,Aspiring screenwriter and cinematographer here. I definitely understand.
RedvsBlue,3158gg,JacksonSX35,2,Thu Apr 2 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"It's a process, but as seen from the seasons, it definitely works once you nail down the structure."
RedvsBlue,3158gg,OtakuMecha,2,Thu Apr 2 16:49:35 2015 UTC,Yes. Though Burnie tends to write it more as a movie and then divides it into episodes while Miles writes it more episodically and they compile it into a movie.
RedvsBlue,3158gg,JacksonSX35,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:44:44 2015 UTC,Which is odd. I found Reconstruction didn't flow that well compared to Seasons 11 and 12 as full movies.
RedvsBlue,3158gg,zando95,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:10:02 2015 UTC,That's a good question. I wonder if they wrote the whole season at once? It wouldn't surprise me. They flow into each other very well.
RedvsBlue,3158gg,Simusar,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:37:41 2015 UTC,They must have spent so long conceptualizing each cut in order to make the season seamless.
RedvsBlue,3158gg,flipcarroll,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:42:22 2015 UTC,"For season 10, they got everyone into one room and read through the entire script before they started recording/filming."
RedvsBlue,3158gg,WoolyBabby,1 point,Thu Apr 2 09:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think that they've talked about it before. For everything after the Blood Gulch Chronicles, with the possible exception of season 6 due to the ""letters"" that the Chairman and Director send back and forth, I think they had said that they actually film each with the idea of a season equaling a movie. Then they cut them up to be episodes, and release them each week."
RedvsBlue,3158gg,flipcarroll,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:51:06 2015 UTC,"Season 6 wasn't apart of the BGC, it was the start of the actual written story that they had planned."
RedvsBlue,3158gg,WoolyBabby,2,Thu Apr 2 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"Hence why I stated it separately. I meant that it may not have been filmed in the same way as seasons 7-12 due to the Chairman and Directors' ""letters"" segmenting the story a bit."

RedvsBlue,316ok1,UltimaNylocke,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:07:04 2015 UTC,This is a great variation of Big Prize/Faraway. I've always loved how Trocadero essentially does remakes of certain songs but in new ways that totally change the feel of the song.
RedvsBlue,3150rh,madamfray,14,Thu Apr 2 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"You see, the theory is that it IS an Insurrectionist, specifically the Flamethrower one. We never did see his face, and he was never confirmed to be killed. Plus, all his tattoos on his chest and back have to do with flames and sharks (reference to visor and weapon). The tattoo on the base of his neck is the Flaming ""Rock on"" Halo emblem, which was also on the flame soldiers' chest plate. Also, the burnt side of his face looks like a shark (with the black eye and the partially bared teeth)."
RedvsBlue,3150rh,Tmlboost,3,Thu Apr 2 01:58:04 2015 UTC,Oh I forgot about him! This is a great theory. Thank you.

Recovery One especially is pretty important in terms of understanding the characters and plot in seasons 6+, so make sure you catch that one. Out of Mind is still relevant and worth watching, but if for whatever reason you're in a hurry, it's slightly less mission-critical than Recovery One. That said, watch them both."

I'd be happy if when RvB ends that if that's what it'd reveal and it'd cut to a real version of Church where he isn't ""The Director"" (bad guy), or Alpha/Epsilon Church (good guy).   Just a normal guy who sees himself as responsible for his wife Allison's death. The last scene would be a shot of him crying to himself in a poorly maintained room.  He spent years envisioning this scenario in his head where he needed to save her from himself. Then accepting that she's gone and moving on(Season 11+) and busying himself with a fantasy. Leaving his real life in shambles. What we saw was the delusions of a self hating possible mentally ill man."
RedvsBlue,3124l2,ilivetofly,4,Thu Apr 2 14:33:59 2015 UTC,I would accept this only if it was a simulation and the people where actually real if that makes sense like how epsilon recreated the canyon inside himself but they existed in the real world

RedvsBlue,30xiaq,DatGameGuy,18,Tue Mar 31 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"He has the second highest rank in the series now. And is likely going to be doing more heavy lifting than his superior.   I've been suggesting the ""death of an elder"" since the overt Star Wars references started propping up at the end of S11. It would have to be either Sarge or one of the characters seen during the Freelancer backstory. Although with the S13 teaser trailer, I feel more confident in the latter.   OR, the more obvious answer, all of the other choices were Blue and they needed a strong Red to counterbalance it. Sarge is the lead writer's favorite character (omitting Flowers) and his regulation red armor contrasts with all the blue offshoots.   Edit: Also this is the end of a Saga. Typically, Sarge gets some development via one of his patented speeches and then sticks his neck out for people he wouldn't otherwise.  S5 - ""Glory, glory to the red team..."" then they assist the Blues.  S8 - ""You ever wonder why we're here?"" then they assist Church, Tex, and Wash.  S10 - ""Do you want to get a little reckless?"" then they assist Carolina and Church."

RedvsBlue,30xiaq,WoolyBabby,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"Agent Florda? He was Captain Flowers. Flowers died because Church gave him aspirin which he was allergic too. He never got shot. (Unless you were referencing something I'm not getting) Also with AI and Sheila difference, the AI were based off of a human being (in this case Leonard Church) and have a ""personality"" so to speak. While Sheila and Andy are just really smart computers...or a smart bomb."
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,forrestib,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:40:02 2015 UTC,"Flowers was resurrected by the alien in season 5. He was then shot without warning near the finale right before he could tell Tucker something of vital importance, presumably that Church was the Alpha. And if you've seen any significant amount of the show you know Sheila, Andy and Lopez are positively seeping with personality, so that argument doesn't really hold any water. Especially when compared with the fragments like Delta or Omega that have only a little more personality depth than your average Vulcan."
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,WoolyBabby,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:16:23 2015 UTC,"But it was said that the AI fragments are fragments of the Alpha AI, which was created from the mind of the Director, Leonard Church.

RedvsBlue,30xiaq,forrestib,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"But what makes human minds so special? Arguably the brain could be called ""just a smart computer"" too.

If it acts like an AI and sounds like an AI and can do all the same stuff..."
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,WoolyBabby,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:19:00 2015 UTC,"But a simple robot kit cant think for itself like the ai do. If you noticed Sheila only responded/acted when she was told to and rarely did anything on her own or suggested something else. Sigma had the idea of metastability and completely corrupted Maine,  turning him into the Meta. A smart computer could not do that."
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,forrestib,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"But Lopez killed Sister all on his own. He built two motorcycles for Simons without being asked to. And most significantly, he and Sheila staged a short-lived robot revolution. Do you honestly think Sarge wanted Lopez to become Doc/Omega's sidekick? Lopez made the choice to leave Red Team and betray his creator all on his own."
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,WoolyBabby,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:57:33 2015 UTC,Yes because that was his job (except the whole robot revolution but RT has said BGC was non-canon anyway). Lopez was programmed to be a solider so of course he would kill Sister after Sarge left because it is in his programming.
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,forrestib,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"Rooster Teeth never said or even implied Blood Gulch wasn't canon. Most events have been cast in a new light since, but they all still happened in some form or another. There are no direct contradictions between Chronicles and later seasons, which there would be if it were no longer canon. In fact, the story blends almost perfectly taking the various hiatus mini-series into account. (Out of Mind, Recovery)"
RedvsBlue,30xiaq,WoolyBabby,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:32:24 2015 UTC,Burnie has said himself that there would be continuity errors with BGC and seasons 6 on. They've tried to make it flow as nice as possible but he has said that there would be errors. The AI in BGC and the AI in PFL being one of them.

RedvsBlue,30vsmz,BeefyGhost,18,Thu Apr 2 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"I too am hopping on the ""its totally Sharkface"" train."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Ravyn4077,7,Tue Mar 31 22:31:15 2015 UTC,And thus his name is born.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Aruseus493,14,Tue Mar 31 22:34:51 2015 UTC,He's had the name for a long time.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Ravyn4077,4,Tue Mar 31 22:37:28 2015 UTC,Really? Didn't know that.... >///<
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,TomPheysey,7,Tue Mar 31 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"Lol, in the soundtrack for that episode the song is called sharkface/rooftop"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,11harry2,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:36:54 2015 UTC,I would like him to be called FlameKnuckle that would be pretty cool
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Sethsquatch509,16,Mon May 4 14:38:44 2015 UTC,Could it be the insurrectionist with the flame-thrower from Season 9? Had the same shark-teeth tattoo as the flame-thrower guys helmet.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,PrinceCheddar,14,Tue Mar 31 22:18:06 2015 UTC,Also the emblem on the his armor is the same as the tattoo on his neck.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,11,Tue Mar 31 22:25:06 2015 UTC,That guy was a dick.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Rebel_Peyton,5,Wed Apr 1 08:03:11 2015 UTC,could be but I'm not too sure how much info he would be able to provide not to mention he looked pretty dead
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,11,Tue Mar 31 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"He is Sharkface (The Flamethrower ""Insurrectionist"")   He is seen with the flaming rock horns emblem tattooed on his back when all the prisoners are being shown at first, which is Sharkface's emblem His chest has a giant shark mouth tattoo... Shark mouth... Sharkface.... His face injury, received from a gravity hammer maybe? He has a past with Washington and Carolina, the two remaining Freelancers. He was never a ""confirmed"" kill and in RvB unless you see them die they aren't dead... Or even then they still come back some times....   Those are your five reasons, thank you"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,The_MAZZTer,3,Thu Apr 2 01:35:59 2015 UTC,"yeah this is an old post, I'm 90% sure its him but still of what interest is he? I bet loads of people got smacked in the face by carolina"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,xFlyersFan94x,3,Thu Apr 2 01:53:44 2015 UTC,"He will likely have a huge flamethrower. He's out for revenge.   That's really enough, I think."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,potatoqualitymemory,3,Fri Apr 3 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"Not maine, i believe he died at end of S8 or the Mercs already had him.  I could be other Freelancer we didnt met"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,QuantumAwesome,5,Tue Mar 31 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"Plus, the symbols on the back of the neck do not match the Meta's."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,veryalias,4,Thu Apr 2 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's CT from season 7, the Insurrectionist Leader."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,3,Wed Apr 1 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"The fact that convinced me most that he is the Flamethrower Insurrectionist is the fact that his battle was with Carolina and Washington, the two remaining Freelancers.  So he likely has a personal vendetta against those two.  Consider the tattoos, and I think there's a pretty strong case."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,jkeyc,3,Wed Apr 1 22:36:56 2015 UTC,"The personal vendetta thing is a good case yeah, since his eye and jaw is fucked probably from Carolina throwing the hammer at his face not to mention he vanished at the end of the shot and we never really saw his corpse"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Proyected,3,Wed Apr 1 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's FI either.  FI didn't have a history with the project.  Honestly I think Maine.  Yes, the neck thing.  But I still think he'll return with the tease of his helmet.  And he never really was confirmed dead, honestly he was just like Carolina at the end of Season 10's Freelancer part.  Thrown off an icy cliff."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,jkeyc,3,Wed Apr 1 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"Except that Carolina used her grappling hook. Maine was dragged down to the depths by a warthog, not to mention that his armor was already heavy to begin with (also not mentioning the entrance and exit wounds from Tuckers sword and the lack of an AI to run any equipment). I think it should be an Insurrectionist, not necessarily Flamethrower Guy but an Insurrectionist nonetheless. (PS: I think Maine's helmet is just there to show the fact that Charon Industries now has the Meta's equipment albeit failing equipment). :)"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:42:07 2015 UTC,Good thought.  I'd like it to be Meta but I see what you mean.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,jkeyc,2,Thu Apr 2 00:44:11 2015 UTC,no meta tattoo tho... I want it to be maine tho
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,2,Thu Apr 2 00:40:58 2015 UTC,Yeah the FI just seems boring.  Like if the big reveal was that it was a one time character.  Which is what the FI is.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Proyected,3,Thu Apr 2 00:43:24 2015 UTC,exactly i man he will want revenge sure but the freelancer project didnt exactly have a lot of friends
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,fbiguy22,2,Thu Apr 2 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"It must be an ""insurrectionist"" of some sort. Maybe it was flamethrower guy, but the shark tattoos should make it clear that it was a past enemy of the Freelancers. :)"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Kylester11,2,Thu Apr 2 00:35:32 2015 UTC,It's gonna be Utah.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"I hope the other insurrectionists return too, the surviving ones like Girlie."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Agent-Vermont,20,Fri Apr 3 08:16:39 2015 UTC,"About the guy at the end  Okay I didn't make this image but I added to boxes to make it very clear, it looks like it will be this guy but;   What real information can he provide? Expect a how-to on getting your ass kicked by Carolina not to mention he has been out of the loop for a while.   Anyways its almost certainly not York or Maine as they York had an eye injury but not a jaw scar and Maine had a bullet in his neck and they both would have AI implantation markings"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,7,Tue Mar 31 22:32:19 2015 UTC,Somehow I missed the ACTUAL SHARK on his back while I was frantically screen capping and posting on here.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Fezman92,2,Tue Mar 31 22:38:02 2015 UTC,so did i till i looked at it lol I noticed the little symbol and then was checking the other tattoos and was like oh... I put it up bc I figured if I missed it other people might have as well
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,9,Wed Apr 1 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I took the eye thing too far, thinking it was York. Do I want him back that much?"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Fezman92,8,Tue Mar 31 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"I want york back a fkn lot but I don't think he is a ""bad guy"" I think he would do anything for Carolina, even when he fought her he didn't really try too hard if you know what I mean its not like he shot her or anything and in the end he understood and wished she didn't do it."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Recon1000000,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"When I thought it was York, I felt sick. I was thinking ""no, York can't have gone to the dark side. But it looks like him"""
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KikiFlowers,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"Aside from the enormous scar on his face (which doesn't look like York's scar), wrong color of glass eye and black hair."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Nuclear-Cola,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, couldn't be York. He loved Carolina, and if I recall he was killed by Maine. Wyoming."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KikiFlowers,4,Wed Apr 1 23:05:11 2015 UTC,York was killed by Wyoming in Out of Mind.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"Oh derp. I need to rewatch Out of Mind, clearly. Sorry 'bout that."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KikiFlowers,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:04:18 2015 UTC,even if he wasn't killed by main he didnt look like that and I doubt they would completely change the character model even if they updated it. No way that dude its York its just a lot of people are saying it is
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Inkerius,2,Wed Apr 1 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, plus it wouldn't fit York's m/o at all."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,3,Wed Apr 1 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"What real information can he provide? Expect a how-to on getting your ass kicked by Carolina not to mention he has been out of the loop for a while.   To be fair, them beating him was a result of his attempts to pin them down in a literal armory."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Grundle_Guzzler,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"yeah ik lol still not sure what information or use he would be, lots of people have been beat up by Carolina, the councillor is of more use I bet he could be a right bastard tbh"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:19:06 2015 UTC,Well the insurrection guys knew a lot about what freelancer was doing and we're trying to stop them I'm pretty sure. So a guy on that side would know a lot about project freelancer.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Kaneland96,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:12:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure, he just seemed to be some kind of guard. Perhaps though."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"The councillor never said the other inmate had info, just that he ""shared a history with project freelancer"" and that he could easily convinced to fight alongside the mercenaries."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Proyected,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"perhaps I was mistaken but I think the freelancers have kicked a lot of ass and made a lot of enemies, what would make him so special is what I'm getting at"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,534465,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"It's that it was because of Carolina that his eye and mouth is messed up. If that guy was anything like the other Insurrectionists, then he would want to take revenge or at least give some payback. :)"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,MarshallMelon,2,Thu Apr 2 00:48:19 2015 UTC,it's Doc. case closed  he's no longer a pacifist after being abandoned and forgotten by the reds and blues. on top of being treated like crap since s1
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,WoolyBabby,15,Mon Apr 27 05:25:55 2015 UTC,I'd just like to take this opportunity to show some appreciation for the new music.  It sounds like Trocadero and Jeff Williams have gotten together and are going for a hybrid of Season 11/12 and Season 9/10. And i'm pleased as punch with that.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,MarshallMelon,2,Wed Apr 1 06:39:32 2015 UTC,Jeff Williams doesn't write music for RvB anymore. It's David Levy and Trocadero teaming up now. Not sure if you mean't that it just SOUNDS like them teaming up or if you thought they actually were.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,WoolyBabby,2,Thu Apr 2 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, found that one out a little bit after I posted. Sounds a lot like the S9/10 stuff though."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ThaGreatIsaiah,2,Thu Apr 2 22:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does. Which is good because they're actually in a full out war, which brings the same sort of feel that the Freelancer Saga brought, so having similar sounding music is definitely going to be awesome."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Dan_Of_Time,16,Thu Apr 2 22:50:43 2015 UTC,My only problem with this being the shark face guy is that he was in like one scene in season 9.  He really doesn't seem like he'd be THAT important to me.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,todd360,9,Wed Apr 1 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"He's a tough opponent with a grudge against the two strongest fighters on the opposing side, I think he will be something special.  Also he looks insane."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Grundle_Guzzler,2,Wed Apr 1 19:34:00 2015 UTC,He might have only been in that one scene but he just so happened to be in the scene with the two Freelancers they're going to be fighting against. Someone with a grudge against your enemies is certainly someone you want on your side.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Agent-Vermont,2,Wed Apr 1 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"One thing people aren't mentioning is that miles said in his interview with two four ten (can't link, on mobile) that he notices really small things and tries to flesh them out into something huge. So while sharkface had a small role, it doesn't rule him out. Also, in that scene he was fighting against Wash and Carolina, so he definitely holds a grudge."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Rogan_McFlubbin,12,Thu Apr 2 01:51:40 2015 UTC,Ok shot in the dark here. With the return of the Councilor what are the odds that 479er showing up? Because I would just LOVE for her to make a return.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KAnimalia,6,Tue Mar 31 23:05:03 2015 UTC,Tinfoil theory: 479er was Echo 419 THE WHOLE TIME!
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KaiserGrey,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:25:23 2015 UTC,But she died when two banshees crashed her pelican :(
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KAnimalia,1 point,Thu Apr 2 10:03:41 2015 UTC,I don't think she died. I'm pretty sure she was Recovery Command back when Wash was still working for Project Freelancer.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Rogan_McFlubbin,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"What I was saying was that Echo 419 (you know, Pilot named Foehammer) died in the Halo CE game at the last mission when two banshees attacked her pelican.  And yeah, I think 479er became the Recovery Command in the miniseries Recovery One."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,QuillyWonka,1 point,Sat Apr 4 09:19:38 2015 UTC,It's more likely than the guy at the end of the episode being York or Maine.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,CakeScientist,3,Thu Apr 2 17:31:47 2015 UTC,Alright it's been a while. Who is she again?
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Forikorder,3,Thu Apr 2 01:26:45 2015 UTC,Pilot for Project Freelancer.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,TheMajesticDino,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:37:57 2015 UTC,maybe she was the pilot of the prison ship
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Forikorder,2,Wed Apr 1 23:36:56 2015 UTC,I heard a male voice groan when that pilot died
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,2,Thu Apr 2 01:47:06 2015 UTC,ya you can hear him talk earlier too when there picking up the pelican
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,graywolfe42,12,Thu Apr 2 01:51:48 2015 UTC,"Wow venting the cells was really unexpected and funny, I still think they would get pulled away though. You would need to grasp pretty hard."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,4,Tue Mar 31 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"I realized what he was doing about 5 seconds before he did it because I was confused on why that of all things is how he wanted them to show they wanted in. Then I remembered the crew mentioned something about a ""purge"" and then it happened."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Agent-Vermont,3,Tue Mar 31 23:07:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I was confused I actually thought they where going to some electrical thing and then I released anyone holding the bars would die if they passed a current through them and by then it was already happening.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Fezman92,11,Wed Apr 1 00:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think its Flamethrower Guy/Sharkface. Not just because of the flame tattoos, but the shark jaws on his chest. Remember Flamethrower Guy also had shark jaws on his visor. ALSO, he has the same emblem on his back that Flamethrower Guy has on his chest. Image for Reference  EDIT: Also the actual shark on his back that I just noticed..."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ahmnutz,3,Tue Mar 31 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"Now we need to translate the tats on his back. They look Japanese or Chinese.   First three rows:  Imgur  Other rows, I think the last one of the first image and the first line of the second image are the same one:  Imgur"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Firnin,6,Tue Mar 31 22:26:04 2015 UTC,It is apparently an excerpt from the Art of War. I found translations here and someone in another reddit(/u/Firnin) posted this wikipedia page for it.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ahmnutz,2,Wed Apr 1 18:54:26 2015 UTC,I can't take credit for finding it. that would be /u/Tresnore I just decided to tell people about it

RedvsBlue,30vsmz,autowikibot,2,Wed Apr 1 19:05:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. It sounded like the Art of War when the translation was posted.

It's certainly not the Meta before people talk about it considering he didn't have the AI Tattoo on the back of his head.   If we're talking about Freelancer enemies, it's either a former freelancer or perhaps one of the ""dead"" mercenaries from the Prequel seasons. Based off the tattoo on his chest, I'm guessing it might be Shark Face from season 9."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,11harry2,3,Tue Mar 31 22:17:25 2015 UTC,Flamethrower guy perhaps? He did have all those flame tattoos....

To see the return of so many characters is always cool, especially the Councilor. I love how they are tying the story back to the freelancers. In my opinion it helps link up the most recent major story arc with the past major story arc, which I thought was kinda necessary."

RedvsBlue,30vsmz,SmokeySmokes,2,Wed Apr 1 01:18:46 2015 UTC,what is your website?
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,spiral6,3,Wed Apr 1 18:06:22 2015 UTC,Two Four One Ten
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Forikorder,2,Wed Apr 1 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"Well now that Felix and Locus have a lot more recruits including Sharkface, most likely the guy at the end is Sharkface, the Reds and Blues are going to need some kind of equalizing agent."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,The_ThirdFang,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:39:15 2015 UTC,Time to rebuild Freckles then!
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,The_Whitest_Negro,2,Thu Apr 2 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"So, would Felix/Locus potentially know Sharkface already? As he worked for the Chairman as well? If it is Sharkface, why is he in jail? I also noticed some potential foreshadowing: The two agents who fought Sharkface was Carolina and Wash. The two agents who will fight Sharkface should he join Felix/Locus are Carolina/Wash. Also just realized that the ending scene with Caboose and Grif is the exact same thing Miles tweeted."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,J_Bear,3,Wed Apr 1 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"Miles, with the tease. That was in January!"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Dan_Of_Time,2,Fri Apr 3 05:23:35 2015 UTC,Kinda makes me want to go through his past tweets in search of clues.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,itz4mna,2,Fri Apr 3 05:27:41 2015 UTC,"i wonder if the councilor forgot that Wash let alpha in his head, or if hes simply knows they cant call that a lie"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Dan_Of_Time,2,Wed Apr 1 23:45:27 2015 UTC,What if they give Flame Insurrectionist the Meta's armor and equipment. It helps that they teased Maine's helmet and now showed  99% possibility of being sharkface.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,SerJolton,2,Thu Apr 2 02:44:16 2015 UTC,I wonder if they will use the Meta armor on sharkface. Pure speculation but they have a similar build and would give reason to showing the Meta's helmet.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,2,Thu Apr 2 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"It seems likely to be him, but I'm really hoping it's not Sharkface. He had such a minor role in a single episode, and promptly got his arse kicked by Carolina. I have no idea where this ""grudge"" people are talking about is coming from, it seems like a wasted chance to develop a more relevant character: I would have preferred to see Girlie or the Sleeveless Trooper instead."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,CyberianSun,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:22:50 2015 UTC,"Clearly he had some sort of high ranking/credited position on the team, to be taken out and presumably put out of action for a while would definitely make you hate those who did it. I think he will just be muscle for the mercs, like an insane brute."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,todd360,2,Thu Apr 2 17:02:37 2015 UTC,The story of how Epsilon died? Hasn't he died at least a dozen times by now?
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,johndoz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it makes you wonder, If he dies now, what is his fallback?"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Aruseus493,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:00:28 2015 UTC,Epsilon has never died
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Inkerius,3,Tue Apr 7 13:20:16 2015 UTC,OH SHIT THEY WHERE CLOAKED.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,2,Tue Mar 31 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"So lets talk about hargroves final words in the press conference of this episode. ""All good things must come to an end."" Could that mean that this is Miles final season directing RVB and that hes handing the reigns off to someone new?"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,OtakuMecha,2,Tue Mar 31 23:35:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm pretty sure this is Miles last season as the showrunner. I seem to recall it being mentioned somewhere officially but I may be wrong. While I do enjoy what Miles has done with it I think rotating out showrunners might be a good way to keep it fresh. So every new storyline gets its own style rather than just falling into a rut. Each new head writer will have something different they want to bring to the show and a new direction to take it.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,KristophGavin,2,Wed Apr 1 22:32:36 2015 UTC,"So... The Councilor, Agent Maine (At least I think that was him), Felix, Locus, and an army of prisoners.  Welllll the Blood Gulch crew is screwed.  edit: okay I get it its not maine"
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,OtakuMecha,5,Tue Mar 31 22:15:40 2015 UTC,Not Agent Maine. He didn't have the Meta Tattoo.
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,6,Tue Mar 31 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"That wasn't Maine.  Someone posted this over in the thread on /r/RoosterTeeth, and I'm inclined to agree."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,TodtheT1000,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:19:40 2015 UTC,That guys neck looked okay tho and Maine was shot in the neck? Not to mention he didnt seem to have marks on his back of his neck from the AI chips? That could be covered with the tattoo tho. He seemed to have his eye hurt and a bit of his jaw almost like york  heres an image http://i.imgur.com/0nWBihM.png

RedvsBlue,30vsmz,QuillyWonka,2,Wed Apr 1 02:30:29 2015 UTC,"Uh, Doc would most certainly not hang on the bars and would be dead even if he was there, which I doubt."
RedvsBlue,30vsmz,ilivetofly,2,Wed Apr 1 22:16:52 2015 UTC,Last time we checked Doc was MIA via Future Cube so i doubt docs in the prison hes ethier dead or lost to space and time until they get a convient time for him to pop up

RedvsBlue,30vsmz,Animated95,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:23:57 2015 UTC,A few grunts walking along a prison with several inmates yelling at them. The camera seems to oddly linger on one guy who is mostly bald with a bit of hair coming off the side and a tattoo on the back of his neck. The guards finally reach a Pelican with the bay doors down and draw their weapons in suprise as they see what's inside (we don't see it).

RedvsBlue,30nf3k,Dan_Of_Time,3,Sun Mar 29 10:22:53 2015 UTC,"Even so it wouldn't explain how he could be alive, just an alternative view on what happened. Most recently he was shot by a random sniper.  As far as problems with your theory, it would be a really weird way for him to try and monitor Alpha, it would have made much more sense to just go into the caves and tell them he was shipping out for a while. Also I doubt he would leave Alpha's side. He has VIC monitoring the canyon, so he can keep a personal watch on him."
RedvsBlue,30nf3k,forrestib,2,Sun Mar 29 10:23:24 2015 UTC,"Who the heck shot Flowers anyway? I've watched that finale a few times now and I can't remember anyone having a sniper rifle at the time.

RedvsBlue,30nf3k,ilivetofly,2,Mon Mar 30 22:01:31 2015 UTC,wouldnt recovery have been sent to him tho even with no AI if the defender of the alpha dies you at least send someone as replacement perhaps this was tex but i doubt it
RedvsBlue,30nf3k,Forikorder,2,Sun Mar 29 00:52:46 2015 UTC,he was probably removed from the recovery system so noone could track him to the alpha like if Maine got Washs gear
RedvsBlue,30nf3k,ilivetofly,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:52:45 2015 UTC,I thought the recovery beacons where built into the armour? Perhaps though
RedvsBlue,30nf3k,Forikorder,3,Sun Mar 29 13:15:01 2015 UTC,"we dont know for certain, but he was probably given standard armour, at the very least its different from what he wore in the field"
RedvsBlue,30nf3k,ilivetofly,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:07:35 2015 UTC,I guess but you would think the armour that was there would have a lo more surveillance.   Pretty suspicous that they have spare armour suits (since Tex seemed to think that wasn't standard) and that sarge was able to make them into robots. Its like they knew church/alpha might need a new body but I guess thats a different topic.
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,Firebat12,20,Sat Mar 28 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's fully posessing Maine but more like heavily influencing him. Like a little devil on his shoulder. Then when he assimilated other AI, that infkuence grew as it became several voices all telling Maine what to do."
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,OtakuMecha,15,Sat Mar 28 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it, Sigma was subtly influencing Maine initially, breaking him down mentally and reducing him to very simplistic base instincts to the point where his only drive is to gather all the AI's. After the EMP causing him to lose Sigma and the rest of the AI's his mind was already destroyed so he simply continued following the same basic commands Sigma had instilled in him. He was effectively a trained dog just following orders when Sigma was around and just kept doing the same thing after losing him because Sigma had reduced him to nothing but that drive.  So yeah Maine is the one in control but his mind is so screwed up he can only do what Sigma trained him to do because its essentially all he knows."
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,todd360,3,Sat Mar 28 15:58:37 2015 UTC,Woah thats deep. But sounds really right.
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,PrinceCheddar,8,Sat Mar 28 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"I pretty much fully agree with you.  First you have the fact we've already seen an A.I. completely overwhelm its host, with Omega, and Sigma is.. well.. more creative than just making people act angry.  Then you have the fact that Maine was later sharing its mind with half a dozen distinct entities. Whatever Maine was when it was just Sigma, it must have gotten severely warped by that.

RedvsBlue,30lnpp,chimney3,4,Sat Mar 28 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"I don't  think we're let to understand the difference since Maine doesn't talk.  Also, man, your typing is all over the place!"
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,ConfuzzledKoala,3,Sat Mar 28 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Maine does talk, briefly in Season 9, before getting his throat shot out. Before Sigma's influence, Maine was no more evil than any of the other Freelancer agents like Wash or York."
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,chimney3,2,Sun Mar 29 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"Very valid point, yes he does. He always seemed very ambitious to me, though not unlike the others. I could easily see him deciding that Sigma's vague hints that maybe we should collect the AIs is the best idea ever."
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,jordan_bar,3,Sun Mar 29 01:15:02 2015 UTC,"Sigma and Maine are pretty much the evil duo that works together. Sigma does all the talking and AI work while Maine is the brute, physically the strongest and most resiliant of all the freelancers."
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,ilivetofly,3,Sat Mar 28 15:56:52 2015 UTC,I think that Maine was in a pretty pissy place after losing his voice and needing an AI and even more so when carolina got 2 AI and Sigma was influencal in that I think Maine was just easily led down the evil path but I think say of Sigma made Maine kill himself he would resist but I don't think he wants to I think he is/was happy following maines orders
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,Forikorder,2,Sat Mar 28 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"Sigma wanted the AIs, Maine wanted power it was a partnership, proof is shown that even without Sigma he still went after AIs and equipment"
RedvsBlue,30lnpp,The_MAZZTer,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"It's surprising Maine is able to be functional after his experience with all the AI in his head (Carolina was said to have gone nuts with only 2 fragments), but after the EMP goes off in the following seasons we see him being pretty much OK with being under Wash's command (despite his anger problems).  Carolina might have been right about being able to handle more AI fragments as they are not full AIs. After all, she was said to have issues with two, but from what we see it's only when the director says Alison's name do ALL the AIs present react and their owners are affected (Carolina the worst). It's possible the director swept that incident under the rug and officially claimed Carolina collapsed due to the multiple fragments.  Anyway, when Maine DOES have AIs... he's clearly helping Sigma try to attain metastability by collecting all the fragments. Sigma talked him into it, at least in the beginning, as then there was only one fragment. It's hard to say if he took over at some point, but when the Director is trying to talk the Meta into killing Washington before the EMP, it's the AIs who are speaking to the Director, not Maine! So I think they are in control to some degree. Sigma may also be controlling or coordinating them somehow. Or perhaps they are close to Metastability and are acting close to one AI. Maybe this is why Maine seems to at least mostly recover after the EMP.  When the Alpha merges with him though, it clearly debilitates them. Likely the Alpha, being a full AI, is able to overpower the individual fragments or at least hold his ground and fight them, as well as keeping Maine from doing anything (remember, he can possess armor as he does throughout the series!)"

Nico wanted a name that would rhyme with ""death"" in the last stanza.

RedvsBlue,30645r,ThQmas,9,Wed Mar 25 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"I first watched Seasons 8, 9, and 10 all at once after forgetting about RvB for many years. It was my catch-up session, and after a long night of watching Freelancers do their emotionally-draining thing, the Season 10 finale killed me. I still get emotional when watching it, which is why I haven't done it for Two Four One Ten yet.  But at least on par with that one, and probably beating it, is Season 6. Yes, the twist is amazing, but that whole last monologue is a rollercoaster."
RedvsBlue,30645r,JspangRD,3,Tue Mar 24 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Season 6 is my favorite, probably due to the narrative being so woven into the usual hijinks. Loved the ending. That twist made me lose it the first time i heard it.   10 is also great, but so much sadder. I mean, i loved how he hinted at what he was doing ag the end of 6, and he just couldnt stop beating himself up."
RedvsBlue,30645r,JspangRD,9,Wed Mar 25 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"I really loved the end of season 10, because it echoed the tear-jerking previous episode (might be wrong on where it was) when Tex desperately tries to make Church remember her. When Church had basically the same conversation, I actually did cry. And then Carolina finally killing her father, who turned out to be a sad old man in the end, was just icing on the cake.  The runner-up for me is Church's letter at the end of season 12. Miles did an excellent job of calling back to season 6's letter correspondences. It was an awesome Fuck You moment.  Then comes the end of Season 5, another one that brought the feels, but even managed to add a legitimate moral in a web-series about space soldiers yelling at each other.  The others aren't really fresh enough in my mind to rank them."
RedvsBlue,30645r,ominousdeathheart,3,Tue Mar 24 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"For season 10, the real teary part was The Director's (implied) suicide.  Reed voiced that scene amazingly.  The whole ""would you be so kind as to leave me behind your pistol"" and the ""let me try again, I know I can bring her back"" are immensely sad.  I'd be lying if I said that these scenes didn't leave me crying."
RedvsBlue,30645r,x-soldierside-x,6,Tue Mar 24 20:40:23 2015 UTC,"I mistyped when I said her killing him. You're right, but for some reason it was Church and Tex who affected me more. It probably had something to do with knowing the characters for longer."
RedvsBlue,30645r,tr00perman567,2,Tue Mar 24 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with you though, it is sad.  I feel like I wasn't as upset because eventually Tex will show up again."
RedvsBlue,30645r,TodtheT1000,6,Wed Mar 25 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"Season 8 really hit me hard. At the time, I thought the series could have ended beautifully with Epsilon living out his days in the memory unit. Obviously I'm glad it didn't end there, but if it had, I would have been satisfied.  Season 10 also got me. From season 1-10, everything had been connected to Project Freelancer, and it was now time for it to come to an end. Season 11-12 are still connected to it, but at the time it was like wow. Our journey has ended and a new door has opened. Where are we to go from here?  Season 12 was really great as well. Piecing together all the strands and figuring out what was really going on with the civil war was amazing. Miles really outdid himself there. And the whole ""Dear Chairman..."" speech by Epsilon was hilariously empowering. ""PS. Suck our balls"". Classic."
RedvsBlue,30645r,heyhey922,3,Tue Mar 24 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"When I saw the end of Season 8, I truly thought it was the end of RvB. I would have accepted it. It just ended on such a good note.  ""And I mean, Hell. If you have to live the rest of your life in a memory, you might as well make it a good one.""    Don't get me wrong. I love the fact that it's still going."
RedvsBlue,30645r,UltimaNylocke,4,Tue Mar 24 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'm only really putting this here because nobody's mentioned it yet, but I really liked the ending to season 11. Tucker, Caboose, Grif, and Simmons are stuck without the only competent people around (Washington, Carolina, and Epsilon) and have to lead an army on their own. You get that feeling that they're pretty damn screwed, and the Trocadero music helps bring out the emotions."
RedvsBlue,305434,fdsfgs71,14,Tue Mar 24 15:43:50 2015 UTC,You are missing a lot.  Seasons 9 and 10 are like Revelations where it is a mix of action animation badassery and comedy. Season 10 wraps up the storyline that has spanned from the first season to the tenth.   Season 11 has the same characters but begins a new story arc and is more comedic like the first 5 seasons with no animation.  Season 12 continues S11's story but adds in more drama and a bit of animation.
RedvsBlue,305434,OtakuMecha,3,Tue Mar 24 15:53:50 2015 UTC,Excellent writeup. I think you mean action for animation since there are always visuals and almost never live-action.
RedvsBlue,305434,chimney3,10,Wed Mar 25 04:51:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Season 10 I think is easily the best season of RvB in general. Watching the Blood Gulch Chronicles as a kid, I never would've imagined that story about dudes in a box canyon could've turned into a compelling emotional narrative"
RedvsBlue,305434,TheEliteNub,6,Tue Mar 24 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"YES, ABSOLUTELY. I may have an unpopular opinion here, but I like Miles' writing more than I liked Burnie's, (Not that his was bad, the plot twist of Season 6 is still one of the most bone chilling revelations ever), but Seasons 11 and 12 kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entirety of my viewing. Seasons 9 and 10 focus mainly on Project Freelancer, which isn't completely necessary to watch, but I'd watch it anyway as they reference it a lot. The present-day stuff is good too, as it advances the plot to tie into seasons 11 and 12. So yes, watch it."
RedvsBlue,305434,iiJakexD123,3,Tue Mar 24 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"Oh thank god somebody else who prefers Miles. Like, don't get me wrong, Burnie is good at writing and he made the characters who they were, but I've always felt he's had trouble developing dramatic characters, which caused a lot of Seasons 9-10 to suffer. There were great emotional beats, but they didn't necessarily make sense in terms of building up to those beats. Miles nails the original characters and fleshes out the new ones to the point that their emotional beats are more effective, which has been a nice breath of fresh air."

RedvsBlue,305434,JacksonSX35,2,Wed Mar 25 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not say there was never any, but Burnie did say that he tried to avoid them several times."
RedvsBlue,305434,TodtheT1000,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:57:14 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I still think the references are slightly more leaning towards older or well-established icons in the newer seasons, rather than fleeting icons that quickly fade from the public conscience."

Just some filler that feels more like an epilogue to the recollection than a standalone story. Now seasons 11 and 12 are, in my eyes, the best seasons ever made. They really blend the comedy of the BGC and the drama of the recollection. I'd say watch them all for story's sake. It really is difficult to understand the story without Seasons 9 and 10."
RedvsBlue,305434,JacksonSX35,3,Tue Mar 24 17:45:35 2015 UTC,You are missing every season since Revelation. Go watch them now before I shoot you for being a dirty blue.

RedvsBlue,2zxvj1,Asscreditt,12,Sun Mar 22 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"The original Tex was the beta AI. However, as we saw in S8, the Director tried to re-make that AI, because it was based on the woman he loved, just as the alpha AI was based on him. The S8 version of Tex was (still is?) trapped in the memory unit. After that whole ordeal, the Director kept trying to remake the beta AI, and kept failing, leading to the army of Tex's. Epsilon talking to them is up to interpretation, because it wasn't explained, but I saw it as Epsilon  talking to all of them as a whole, because they were all flawed versions. They appeared to him as one entity. How he was able to do this, I have no idea. I'm sure I'm not the only one with a theory on this, though.    Maybe I missed something that explained it differently, but that's how I saw it."

RedvsBlue,2zxvj1,Forikorder,2,Sun Mar 22 21:49:44 2015 UTC,"Having recently made a chart about both Texas and Church, I will refer you to it here, but the gist of it is that Beta was taken by the meta, and then wiped by the emp. The next Tex we meet is made by Epsilon because he's an obsessive idiot. She gets trapped in the Epsilon unit and eventually ""let go."" As for the Texes of the 100 Tex battle, their origin is more unclear but implied to have been programmed by The Director. Their level of ""smart"" is debatable but I'd say it's somewhere between that of the average fragment and a static AI like Shelia."

It's just the Alisons that were created didn't work very well (at least, not how the Director wanted them to), so they were rejected and made into fighting machines, that Epsilon was then able to interact with to make them shut down."

RedvsBlue,2zr50k,Simusar,3,Sat Mar 21 05:59:02 2015 UTC,"A) Yes, it very well can be, Epsilon is Alpha's memory, meaning he has all of Alpha's memories.  According to the timeline, Epsilon was created well before Alpha went to Blood Gultch, and when Alpha and Washington took the Epsilon unit, Epsilon was flashing memories to Alpha; it is reasonable that Epsilon would also absorb memories from Alpha.  B) No, he gave him the entire story, but told him to pay attension to seasons 11-13, because they pertain to Chorus.  But he is sending all of it, because the new Chairman is investigating all of Hargrove's actions, that includes the time before Chorus.  C) Many trailers have very little/nothing to do with what they are previewing.  Go back and look at the origional trailers for season 1 of Red vs Blue.  Go rewatch the trailer, and pay attension."
RedvsBlue,2zr50k,Forikorder,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"A) that has absolutely nothing at all to do with the current conversation, it makes no sense for epsilon to beam his biography to the chairman, and even if he did he wouldnt include other peoples actions in it (like season 11) hes sending a report theres no reason to tell his entire (and mostly irrelevant) life story and if hes going to tell his and alphas life story might as well throw in every other AIs life story too and get even more irrelevant  B) again S1-5 have nothing to do with chorus, S6-10 have little to do with Chorus and even S11 has little to actually do with chorus aside from the fight at the end  C) we call trailers like that ""shit"""
RedvsBlue,2zr50k,Simusar,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:33:45 2015 UTC,"A) To our conversation, yes it does.  Epsilon is including everything related to PFL and Malcom Hargrove, which includes the simulation bases and the soldiers stationed at them.  B) True, they don't have anything to do with Chorus, but they do have to do with the ""friends"" that Epsilon was speaking of in the message.  If 11 had so little to do with Chorus, then why did Epsilon say ""Pay special attension to chapters 11-13""?  If 11 was so pointless, why didn't he say 12-13?  C) You can call the trailers whatever you like, but the same people that made the Season 13 trailer, are the ones that made the Season 1 trailer, who, in your words, are apparantly retarded."

Tank isn't a color. At least I don't think it is... The O'Malley thing starts out weird. I don't know what season you're on, but it looks like the first? It'll get less weird as it goes on. Relatively, anyways."
RedvsBlue,2znld9,chimney3,9,Fri Mar 20 02:04:44 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Also... tank is a colour now. I just made it a colour. Shh... no questions.
RedvsBlue,2znld9,Simusar,11,Fri Mar 20 02:07:59 2015 UTC,It shall be a color somewhere between Blue and 7.
RedvsBlue,2znld9,aerodanger,7,Fri Mar 20 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"Tucker's color depends on what color the ladies are looking for. Sometimes she's into teal, others are into aqua. He just aims to please. He's a lover, not a fighter!"

Anyways, you got them almost right, I'll fix it for you. •Grif is orange. Not yellow. Nor gold. Fucking orange.  •Donut is lightish red.  •Tucker's a sort of...greenish-blue? Aqua-marine? Maybe turquoise? Fuck it, I don't know myself.  •Tex is a Freelancer, not a merc... you'll see the difference later on... seriously.  If the jokes don't make sense they will by the time you finish RvB."

RedvsBlue,2zkfts,x-soldierside-x,14,Thu Mar 19 10:51:10 2015 UTC,OP watched 12 hours of RvB each day.
RedvsBlue,2zkfts,hypoferramia,7,Thu Mar 19 17:29:02 2015 UTC,[sighs] you’re gonna want to sit down for this story. its about 20 hours long. and i only like telling it in 5 minute intervals.   This is a joke made by lopez to lopez dos.0 in season 11 reffering to the length of the whole RvB story so far and that each episode is roughly 5 minutes (obviously they get longer later on). So add whatever the length of season 12 is to 20 hours and thats a pretty good estimate of how long the whole thing is.

RedvsBlue,2zkfts,Tman972,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:16:10 2015 UTC,Here's a question for you OP. What kept you from watching it sooner? Are you a fan of other Rooster teeth productions? We're other productions brought to you attention by a post video subscription announcement?    Just wondering since I'm having constant conversations about these types of things.
RedvsBlue,2zkfts,ilivetofly,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"Im in the same boat as this dude, I got sick maybe half a week ago and have been marathoning RvB through my awake hours and finished s12 maybe 20 min ago. Since I'm in the same boat I think I will just go answer your questions :P  I wanted to watch RvB for a while, it has been on my list for a long time but I wanted to get shorter things out of the way first, once I watched all of RWBY I knew I had to watch it soon but just didn't have enough time to put aside for it. Then boom illness.   Im a pretty big fan of Rooster Teeth productions I have watched at least one thing of each of there productions I am aware of (even including X-Ray and Vav, I'm not proud)  Last question I'm fuzzy on so imma just going to leave it there."

RedvsBlue,2zjl4r,Tman972,6,Thu Mar 19 13:51:16 2015 UTC,I don't love it either but it is proven that people subscribe more when you remind them at the end.

RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,Forikorder,5,Thu Mar 19 03:34:58 2015 UTC,I'm going to choose option A.
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,complexevil,2,Thu Mar 19 11:54:54 2015 UTC,I've always thought it was C
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,TheJofisean,16,Wed Mar 25 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"It's a robot body and Church just thought he was human. No one else noticed he wasn't human because they're all in heavy duty Armour and never take it off. The reason it's a robot body is because Blood Gulch was sent the materials to make another robot body if something happened to Churches one.  That became Lopez, Washington previously said that it wasn't standard equipment."
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,TodtheT1000,3,Thu Mar 19 10:43:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is the most likely answer
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,danklurker109,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:16:56 2015 UTC,This is a good answer but the fact Tucker says his body is starting to stink and scavenger birds are flying above.. and the blood. Makes me doubt it. I mean it makes sense but I just feel it was a loophole in the story and that's how they fixed it.
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,LaughingCTron,6,Fri May 22 00:41:54 2015 UTC,It was a gay robot.
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,Tman972,3,Thu Mar 19 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"Probably the same thing that Texas was, some kinda super advanced android. My personal theory is that the body had programmed ""memories"" where it would remember eating other human stuff even if he didn't do it. I saw a fanfic where Church was told his suit ""absorbed nutrients through the air,"" but it's really up in the air. Best not to breath too hard on the early seasons, they tend to fall apart under pressure. Fun, but not much substance."
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,boxesofboxes,3,Thu Mar 19 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"My guess would be some unlucky, weak willed, expendable soldier that they allowed Alpha to possess and take over, and giving him false memories to believe that he was the person inside the armor."
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,Simusar,2,Thu Mar 19 04:54:40 2015 UTC,"Probably human, or some semi-robotic body that mimics humanity well enough for not to notice.  Like, IIRC, all Project Freelancer people had implants, hence why Omega was able to jump from host to host. Maybe Church just looked like he had a lot more than average."
RedvsBlue,2zjlmb,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Thu Mar 19 10:38:43 2015 UTC,"It was trauma, he literally couldn't believe he was an AI so I can imagine a lot of denial about stuff like that."
RedvsBlue,2zkvhe,JooJoona,10,Thu Mar 19 12:49:11 2015 UTC,The official statement is that they'll make Red Vs Blue for aslong as people want to watch it. So unless Season 13 is terrible and makes everyone hate the show (not gonna happen). There's going to be a Season 14.  There's normally 1 season per year.
RedvsBlue,2zkvhe,TodtheT1000,2,Thu Mar 19 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"i hope that changes, i dont want to see Red VS Blue get overused until its shit"
RedvsBlue,2zkvhe,Forikorder,3,Thu Mar 19 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's a tricky question of when to end a show. Theyve had multiple points where they could have ended, like 5, 8, 10, and 13(at least from what it sounds on the trailer). One theory a friend of mine mention was how this season could lead to a changing of the guard. Theres only so long you can keep the same bumbling soldiers in crazy scenarios defying death, but you could start a new era so to speak with some of the protegees of the main cast. Im not sure how well that would be received though."

There's no way to know whats in store for sure, but the ante has slowly been uped that there isn't much further they can go without it being absurd even by RvB standards. I mean as Kimbal said ""you've recovered alien artifacts, brought corrupt men to justice, and bested the most dangerous war criminal the galaxy has ever known"", there isnt much left. Maybe I am wrong, but only time will tell."
RedvsBlue,2zkvhe,God_Given_Talent,0,Sat Mar 21 06:40:43 2015 UTC,"well they could always jsut have them interfere in another war or have even more corupt-er villains to face the main problem is theyve already teased S13 with EPSILON DIES and hinted at Grif dieing too, so for S14 to be even more hype we need more deaths, but if Epsilon and Grif survive then someone would have to die S14 or noone would care if someones death gets hinted again  honestly with Donut not dieing i already doubt epsilon will die and if he survives and RvB continues on to S14 then that will officially be the fall of RvB"
RedvsBlue,2zkvhe,Forikorder,0,Sat Mar 21 06:44:54 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""unless Season 13 is terrible""? The season is finished already. And it was good. EDIT: never mind"

I've been checking on RT's website every now and then, but since the site is quite heavy I've just searched with Google to see that there's a thing called ""Season 13"" there.

RedvsBlue,2zk02w,ilivetofly,1 point,Thu Mar 19 07:01:17 2015 UTC,We don't even know if he had a time distortion unit at the time as all the equipment he was carrying was taken from the remnants of Freelancer after being set out to hunt the Reds and Blues. The rest of his equipment would've been destroyed back in the EMP because they are technically run on electricity too.

In season twelve, it shows that Charon and the chairman are making new weapons from repurposed Freelancer technology. Agent Maine, the meta, had all sorts of stuff the freelancers used. Including the the AI. In season 6, the ai were destroyed by the EMP, but I think that the chairman has a way to recover that data. I think he is going to revive the alpha and repurpose him to be a weapon."
RedvsBlue,2z9qq0,piemonke,2,Mon Mar 16 21:32:45 2015 UTC,Maybe that's why epsilon church dies? He gets absorbed into weaponised alpha?
RedvsBlue,2z9qq0,bomdidibom,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Although going into that, Sigma's whole idea of recreating the alpha was based on taking the ""dumb"" AI and fixing them together. But technically Epsilon, being the memories, should be a ""smart"" AI and I've never seen Epsilon take any orders or function commands. Technically, the memories aren't (or shouldn't) be necessary for the AI to function."
RedvsBlue,2z9qq0,piemonke,2,Mon Mar 16 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"I think if the chairman wanted the A.I.s restored somehow, Epsilon would better way of going about it. He's got ""memories"" of all the A.I.s. With the memories of Church being treated as Church rather than some pretender using Church's memories, plus Beta being able to operate independently from the rest, makes me think they're all more than just simple simulations.  The way I see it, for all intents and purposes they're copies of the A.I.s. (already a feat thought impossible) Technically, the memory of Delta is not Delta, because Delta existed at the same time as this copy. Had the EMP never gone off, this ""copy"" of Delta and the original Delta would exist simultaneously. Therefore, the memory of Delta is not Delta, but you might as well think of him as Delta since Delta prime got wiped. Since D is the logic one, he's the only one who cares about the distinction.  I think the helmet really was just a trophy, its role in the story is to hint at this greater interest in the Meta of the chairman's. It also kinda shows us that he's pretty arrogant, willing to go through so much effort for something that's fundamentally useless. Him wasting time and taking risks for something that's just a trophy shows how he thinks he's untouchable. No-one can stop him, so why not get a trophy or two?  Him liking trophies would explain why he's using F.I.L.S.S (maybe Sheila from the ship) even when she sounds so depressing. She is another trophy, of his ""victory"" over the Director. This wouldn't be the first time he had an interest in trophies, seeing how the vault owned by Charon Industries, that Project Freelancer raided in season 9, was filled with alien artifacts that didn't seem to be used except as a display."

Taking a 50 caliber round through the chest, followed by 12 pistol shots in his neck at point blank range, getting hit by a truck going probably at least 60 mph, and THEN falling off the freeway which was probably at least 10 stories up. There's no way a fall from a cliff could have killed him. Maybe he hit the ground, barely survived, and was rescued.

And I think that the Chairman just wanted Maine's helmet since Charon Industries was producing guns and armor that could use freelancer equipment  without the use of AI. Maine had collected a bunch of that equipment but couldn't use it because he lacked an AI. So the helmet probably means that the Chairman now has all of Maine's equipment and plains to produce it so that it can be used without an AI.

Season 12 had one talented guy from the community (subtle actions), then another half-way through (fighting), then another towards the end (character/environment artist). 1-3 people.  (They were really hurting for help, with lead animator Chris Dike being very new to this sort of production.)  Season 13 looks to have an even larger team from the start than any RvB season prior. And with the character posters released, I can only assume it's going to look fantastic. Source  Monty was a great animator and will be missed severely, but it's worth mentioning that he worked with plenty of other talented folks. And Chris Dike did a fantastic job on S12 (in a very short amount of time), I'd argue that he understands subtle actions (like grasping a grenade) better than any RT animator thus far.

RedvsBlue,2yyxe5,PrinceCheddar,5,Sun Mar 15 11:17:39 2015 UTC,"Slight problem, Beta was never shown as a part of Meta's group of A.I.s.  Omega is there, but Beta was not.  While I agree about the possibility of the Chairman bringing the other A.I.s back, I think Epsilon's ""death"" would be more about him sacrificing himself, to restore Alpha to completion; sending out his message beforehand, because he doesn't know if his sacrifice will cause Alpha to side with Hargrove, or the Reds and Blues.  Death is not just the end of a life, it can also be the end of individuality.  So Epsilon using his 'powers' to restore Alpha, by recombining all of the fragments, would be the end of his individuality."
RedvsBlue,2yyxe5,Simusar,3,Sat Mar 14 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Beta actually was a part of the Meta, though; if you look at the group of AIs when the Meta captures Delta and when the AI appear around Maine to see Alpha, you can see Beta amongst Omega, Sigma, Theta, Delta, Gamma, and Eta/Iota.

Considering that Tex, Maine, and Wash were the only Freelancers present, this is how it is assumed the Meta is dead--although it seems that nobody checked for the body, as it is never shown.  Carolina, in fact, did survive with the use of equipment--you can see her whip out her grappling gun just before it cuts back to Maine and Tex.  Since the end of Season 8, it's been assumed that Maine is dead--however I personally don't believe it.

RedvsBlue,2yo71d,jkeyc,10,Wed Mar 11 12:40:31 2015 UTC,"Seems.. unlikely. The Meta is more what the A.I.s became, screwing up Maine's mind until he became little more than a puppet the A.I.s used to get more fragments. Hence why Wash didn't stop calling him Meta after the EMP. Maine was permanently changed.  Unless someone else got some A.I., specifically Sigma, I doubt they'd be considered the Meta, nor would they want to be known as the Meta.. let alone be willing to shoot himself in the throat. That seems a bit contrived.  I think you're right that the Chairman is interested in the Meta and may wish to use Epsilon to try and recreate the Meta, potentially completing the metastability stage, but he probably wouldn't need a new ""Maine,"" nor would he use the Meta's old helmet.  IIRC, the helmet was sent to a trophy room or something, rather than, say, a lab, so I doubt the helmet is to be used aside from being a trophy."
RedvsBlue,2yo71d,PrinceCheddar,4,Wed Mar 11 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"sounds like pure speculation IMO even after losing his AIs his actions remained the same so i dont see why he would start calling him Maine again  the trophy room could simply be his biggest strongest vault that its temporarily being confined until such a time that hes ready to use it for something, Wyoming had his time device stored in his helmet, so we know at least one piece of freelancer tech is inside the Metas helmet"
RedvsBlue,2yo71d,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"sounds like pure speculation IMO   What I said or OP's theory?  The point I was making is that the helmet and the shooting of the throat aren't what made the Meta the Meta. It was the A.I., specifically Sigma, and their influence over their host that were inportant. Without them, the helmet and throat injury are meaningless. Even with the A.I., they're inconsequential.   the trophy room could simply be his biggest strongest vault that its temporarily being confined until such a time that hes ready to use it for something, Wyoming had his time device stored in his helmet, so we know at least one piece of freelancer tech is inside the Metas helmet   Seems unlikely. Project Freelancer's tech came from the military, IIRC. The Chairman should have all the resources he wants to get replacement tech, without needing Maine's helmet.  The only truly valuable aspect to Project Freelancer were the A.I. fragments. They were experimental, created using methods since deemed unlawful, all done by a genius in the field of artifical intelligence. They were unique and irreplaceable, and after the EMP they're all gone expect for Epsilon.  I think it's a safe bet the reason the chairman wants the helmet is because of its connection to the A.I.s, and there aren't any A.I.s in it, so it's unlikely to be anything other then a trophy.  Although,  Tex memory was in the helmet for a short while, so perhaps there's something useful to be gained from that. Perhaps a clue as to separating more A.I. memories from Espilon.."
RedvsBlue,2yo71d,PrinceCheddar,2,Wed Mar 11 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"saying the meta was a puppet, his actions didnt change after the AIs all died, puppets generally stop moving with no puppetmaster  the directer was working way outside the law with his own team, whatever thigns he invented the military never got there hands on so all the special armour enhancements are things that existed only in PFL  it was why Wash was confused when Locus cloaked and why Carolina thought it was worthwhile to hunt down old PFL tech  and besides the helmet could also contain important logs"
RedvsBlue,2yo71d,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"I used ""puppet"" as a metaphor, but perhaps it was a bit misleading. Subservient seems more accurate.  Pre-Sigma Maine was different from the Meta, and the Meta without the A.I.s was different from the Meta with the A.I.s. Without the A.I.s the Meta worked under Wash. Did as he was told, generally. Seemed almost like a petulant child at times. You're not really saying that the loss of the A.I. wouldn't severely effect what the entity we call ""The Meta"" was?   it was why Wash was confused when Locus cloaked and why Carolina thought it was worthwhile to hunt down old PFL tech   IIRC, Wash was confused because he was out of the loop. In the years after the war, technology like the kind Project Freelancer had became more commonplace. Not so commonplace as to make the cache of said technology not worth a huge amount on the backwater planet of Chorus, worth tracking down by Carolina, but not limited to only highly classified research programs.   and besides the helmet could also contain important logs   Then why isn't it taken to a lab rather than the trophy room? What reason do we have to question the trophy room being anything other than a literal trophy room?"
RedvsBlue,2yo71d,PrinceCheddar,2,Wed Mar 11 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"no i wouldnt, the Meta didnt have any depth, he was just like a train barreling towards power working under wash got him to the power he needed in the form of AI he needed wash for tracking and things and would acknowledge that wash would know how to find epsilon best so he did what he was told.... more or less  Wash wasnt out of the loop, if anything he was far more in the loop then pretty much everyone the only time he was out of the loop was during the crash  Wash would know as well as anyone exactly where technology actually is, his job was to go out and recover there tech after all, yet he was still surprised to find such technology outside of PFL  and if such technology was so commonplace why was Carolina so suprised to see it being mass produced?]  im not saying the trophy room is anything other then a literal trophy room, im also saying his ship isnt the likely place to have bleeding edge lab so the helmet would be put somewhere safe until they were actually ready to use it for whatever they want, they specifically attacked the crash site so Locus could get the crate that contained the helmet, Malcolm is a very careful person who does not seem the type to take a risk to obtain a trophy  and why would he even want the Metas helmet as a trophy? they were completely unrelated"

Washington: It's just that I've never seen that kind of equipment outside of Project Freelancer.  Felix: Welcome to the future, Wash. Technology is incredible, and everyone uses it to kill each other.  Washington: Does that mean your guys have the same equipment?  Felix: I wish. The New Republic's barely getting by with what they can. You wouldn't happen to have any high-tech armor aboard that wreck, do you?   The technology exists and is out there, it's just not common.   and if such technology was so commonplace why was Carolina so suprised to see it being mass produced?   Because they're space pirates. The Chairman can't just send them a bunch of shiny armor augmentations straight off the production line and not look suspicious. He did what he could, organizing the Freelancer equipment to be all on the same ship, and allowing that ship to then crash on the planet, for the pirates to then mass produce.   why would he even want the Metas helmet as a trophy? they were completely unrelated   Like I said, the A.I. fragments of Project Freelancer were unique, priceless. That helmet was probably valuable to anyone who actually knew what it was, something the chairman did know.   im not saying the trophy room is anything other then a literal trophy room, im also saying his ship isnt the likely place to have bleeding edge lab so the helmet would be put somewhere safe until they were actually ready to use it for whatever they want   Occam's Razor.

I don't think The Meta even used the temporal manipulation augmentation after the EMP.

I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I think the dialogue and quotable material has kind of declined in the later seasons. While I enjoy the show and have watched it all multiple times, I think it has become too plot-driven and the comedy has been overridden a little."
RedvsBlue,2ykxaa,Rhombus_O_Terror,11,Wed Mar 11 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"I think part of that might be because the early episodes just got re-posted to youtube.

And as far as good new quotes, I was going to include Caboose's motivational speech in my post, but I figured it was too long. That speech is full of great lines though.  Caboose: Okay Tucker, I'm gonna tell you this only because you respect my opinion so much.  Tucker: I actually don't listen to anything you say. Ever.  Grif: Classic lazy one.  Caboose: If you keep being mean to Church, Church will just keep being mean to you. And then everyone will be mean to everyone, all the time, and everything will be bad, and no one will have fun.  Tucker: Is this... are you trying to give a motivational speech right now?  Donut: Shh, I wanna see where he's going.  Caboose: I mean, come on! Is this really what you want? You just, you just wanna be angry and mean all the time? Because that is dumb. And you know what? You are dumb for thinking that.  Grif: Did Caboose just call someone dumb?  Sarge: Well that's calling the kettle blue.  Caboose: So Church left, and maybe some of us were sad. But you know what?

RedvsBlue,2yf47j,TaylorCulosis,5,Mon Mar 9 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, I enjoyed it myself though. Even if there were some..issues. One being, there was a scene with Caboose, getting Freckles back, from Wash.(What was left of him), the scene was in the shade, but part of it was bright, then back to shade.  (If I'm remembering the right scene)"

RedvsBlue,2yelso,Stateless573,34,Mon Mar 9 11:22:19 2015 UTC,"Easy answer is that RvB was never meant to be longer than 6 episodes so there are some errors.  A real answer is, that she did know everything, she knew Church was the Alpha, that's why she didn't react when she found out that he was a ""ghost"". Alpha had no memory of all of it so why would she remind him of everything he'd gone through. She was rogue and intercepted Vic's radio call for a freelancer in order to be close to Alpha and make sure he was okay."
RedvsBlue,2yelso,TodtheT1000,10,Mon Mar 9 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"I like this answer the most so far, it makes the most sense. Protect Alpha from whatever is happening at Blood Gulch, and protect him from his past by playing along with with his false memories"
RedvsBlue,2yelso,Simusar,8,Mon Mar 9 05:19:56 2015 UTC,"It could be that she was watching over Alpha, in order to protect him."
RedvsBlue,2yelso,FollowThePact,4,Mon Mar 9 14:08:05 2015 UTC,I thought they were calling for mercenaries and it just so happened for Tex to show up? Could be wrong though.  As for her not getting caught while being a pretty public mercenary she could be going by a different name and be using her voice changer to hide her identidy.  Could be those things or /u/TodtheT1000 is correct that they just didn't plan for the show to go this far.
RedvsBlue,2yelso,TodtheT1000,5,Mon Mar 9 09:27:59 2015 UTC,"It was mentioned in the past how RvB was never meant to be this long, was originally only supposed to be 6 episodes.  I just hate the excuse of ""they didn't plan this far ahead so there's some errors"".   Mercenaries and Freelancers are the same thing but they just didn't have the name Freelancer yet."
RedvsBlue,2yelso,FollowThePact,4,Mon Mar 9 06:30:42 2015 UTC,I'm sure they also used the word freelancer too. Church said something about her being a freelancer separate from her being a mercenary.
RedvsBlue,2yelso,Melk73,4,Mon Mar 9 07:14:07 2015 UTC,Really there was never supposed to be an answer to that (As stated in every thread about this) but I assume she was checking in on him.
RedvsBlue,2yelso,JrYo13,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:40:25 2015 UTC,"Because Vic didn't know she was rogue. My personal theory is that Tex was still looking for Church or Alpha if you like. BGC takes place towards the fall of the freelancer project, after Tex staged a coup to free the Alpha. My beat guess is that she was still monitoring freelancer communications when she was on the run. Now Vic being a computer monitoring a simulation encampment probably never knew of Tex's betrayel of project freelancer. So when the call went out for the nearest freelancer she intercepted it thinking it must be Alpha. The reason she thinks this is because as far as a i can tell freelancer is already done, it's just the Director hasn't been caught yet and everyone still with him believes they are on the ""right"" side of the war. So the only reason there are still simulation troopers around are suspicscious. After she arrives and finds Church she doesn't even faze when he tells her he has died. She already knew he was an AI. She just decided to help him out and be there, because he was what she was looking for the whole time."
RedvsBlue,2yelso,ray2128,1 point,Mon Mar 9 12:20:20 2015 UTC,i thought she was hunting for AI's and essentially went for the Alpha

RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,clairesmac,30,Sun Mar 8 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"Technically, this is an example of retcon. At that point in the show, they had just decided to expand the show to around 12 or 13 episodes. They just looked back and wrote more to fill this in."
RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,JacksonSX35,18,Sun Mar 8 22:57:32 2015 UTC,Burnie has said it's not them planning in advance. They just go back and look at what they can expand upon. Not really uncommon in popular shows

RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,RyderHiME,2,Sun Mar 8 23:00:47 2015 UTC,That is a really cool theory. I always just thought it was a memory from the original church of the original Tex.    Alpha did say he had memories of being a child.
RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,TodtheT1000,2,Mon Mar 9 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"except Tex never broke into a base on an ice planet, she broke into the ship that then crashed on a random ice planet that was nearby then Tex escaped and they put alpha in blood gulch"
RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,Forikorder,-6,Sun Mar 8 23:21:56 2015 UTC,Also blood gulch happens before season eight and even if you could find proof that season 8 happens before season 1 then that just raises more questions then answers.

RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,TheJuda2112,3,Tue Mar 10 08:20:03 2015 UTC,You think season 10 happens after season 1? Or you think the season fight on the ice planet is relevant to the one in season 10?  I'm confused as to what you're saying.

RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,BlueBlazeMV,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"But wait, a few episodes after the Blue team saved Tex in season one, Tex mentions not owing Church any favors because she didn't kill him at Sidewinder. How does Tex even know about this memory if  it didn't happened?"
RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,ShiroiTora,2,Tue Mar 17 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realized that when I saw the episode. While it's possible Tex is playing along with it (since she knows Church is the Alpha), it's more likely Burnie just went back and reincorporated the Sidewinder story to the story of Tex trying to free Alpha. Even he admits that some of the BGC doesn't make sense canonically with the rest of the story."
RedvsBlue,2ydh8m,ShiroiTora,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:56:15 2015 UTC,I can understand her playing along. I don't understand how would she knows of the memory in the first place (since she is the one that brought it up).  I get the second reason though.

RedvsBlue,2yahd7,todd360,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:01:59 2015 UTC,Kinda useful in campaign in some instances with groups of grunts/crawlers since they can cluster and are less likely to dodge. Bit less useful against the bigger guys but I did learn that they actually work well against Knights if you bonk them directly with them. It stuns them momentarily so the grenade drops directly in front of them and expands around them doing at least considerable damage to their shield if not killing them outright. Elites I found were just fat too good at dodging/rolling out of the way.  Multiplayer they're only as useful as the other players are good. So if you're against people with even half a brain stem then yeah they're useless.
RedvsBlue,2yahd7,RTAustinLaCour,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:34:39 2015 UTC,I actually really enjoyed them. I found them efficient. I've definitely had some bad existences with them though.

RedvsBlue,2y6tb1,TaylorCulosis,4,Sat Mar 7 14:04:31 2015 UTC,That's the version on the DVDs. And Netflix.
RedvsBlue,2y6tb1,OtakuMecha,2,Sat Mar 7 15:38:53 2015 UTC,Those are the film versions. They're cut together differently.
RedvsBlue,2y6tb1,TaylorCulosis,2,Sat Mar 7 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah. I was referring to the ""HD"" part."
RedvsBlue,2y6tb1,OtakuMecha,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:45:35 2015 UTC,So the remastered version of the DVD's which I have are going to have less content on it per epsiode than the youtube uploads
RedvsBlue,2y6tb1,TheJuda2112,2,Sat Mar 7 20:00:20 2015 UTC,Not really. It's like a second or so at the end of some episodes and the DVDs actually do include them sometimes with added visuals.   Plus the DVDs have commentary.
RedvsBlue,2y6tb1,OtakuMecha,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:01:50 2015 UTC,Ok that's helps   The reason I don't understand the hype is because why would it be beneficial to click on a playlist and wait for each video to load and so on and so forth for 12 two hour movies it seems inefficient to me anyway

RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,professionalecho,7,Fri Mar 6 19:56:55 2015 UTC,That thing is so damn pretty. I hope the animation looks even half as good as that.
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,FPSGamer48,2,Fri Mar 6 20:22:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully it's a lot more like the season 10 animation and less like the season 12 animation. For some reason the season 12 animation felt WAY slower.
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,professionalecho,4,Mon Mar 9 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"It did, but that's probably 'cause it was two guys and not a dozen. I did like aspects of the Season 12 animation; the fight scenes weren't much, but they did a lot of cool comedy things. I really like Grif walking through the rest stop with a slurpee, for example. Miles has said there's a bigger team on this one, and I hope we get a cool mix of the best of the show's previous animation styles."
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,FPSGamer48,2,Mon Mar 9 23:13:57 2015 UTC,"I was fine with the comedy scenes, it was the action scenes that suffered, but I agree in thinking most animators went to work on RWBY. But right now, we know nothing of what is going to happen to RWBY in the post-Monty era. We've had no info whatsoever. We don't even know if there's an RTX this year! Tickets still haven't gone on sale!"
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,professionalecho,2,Mon Mar 9 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, we know there's an RTX. They've picked Guardians. And they announced at PAX that RWBY 3 would be going ahead.  In any case, I think most of the animators RT hires are on contract rather than permanent employees."
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,FPSGamer48,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are on contract. And I didn't know they got Guardians! Great! Went to the last 2 years, want to go this year! Also, I know RWBY Volume 3 is happening, Monty was supposedly halfway through animating it, and Shane knew Monty's style very well so I have faith in him leading the animation. I just don't know if we can expect a RWBY volume after 3. I hope we do, it's an amazing show, but so far we've had no confirmation from Miles or Kerry that it would continue beyond 3."

It would be hard to think of how to end the series, too, so maybe this is actually the beginning of the end, as in, Red vs Blue will be very different after this, or maybe it won't be called ""Red vs Blue"" after this, and they'll make a new series with the same characters, but different feel and setting.  I might also be thinking too deeply about this. Again, we'll just have to wait and see."
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,professionalecho,5,Fri Mar 6 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"No such thing as thinking too deeply. But I think if this trilogy has proven anything, it's that you can transplant these characters into a variety of situations and they'll shine."
RedvsBlue,2y5vuy,Simusar,0,Fri Mar 6 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"While it does feel ""final"" Epsilon doesn't say anything about part 13 as being the final part.

The Alpha and the rest will be restored, more or less, the same way Tex was in season 8, but it will pull Epsilon apart, leaving it an empty shell, AKA dead.  At least, that's what I hope..  （Ｔ-Ｔ）"
RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,PrinceCheddar,3,Sat Mar 7 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think Epsilon will die in the traditional sense. I believe he'll achieve Metastability, effectively being reborn and can be considered a human being and dying as a fragment."
RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,TodtheT1000,2,Sat Mar 7 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"If Church/Epsilon does die for good then that would mean Burnie is done with being in RvB right? I recall he said a few times that they have the last words of all of the main cast.   Based on what was said in the trailer, it looks like he (and possibly Carolina?) will be for some reason fighting against the Reds and Blues. (Or it just could be referencing something in the previous seasons that I missed) That will be very interesting to see.    Going off of that, he keeps using past tenses when talking about them. That sounds like some-if not all-of them will die.  The trailer establishes that Hargove (sp) isn't Chairman anymore. I predict that he was killed. I really hope he was."
RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,Fezman92,5,Sat Mar 7 00:24:26 2015 UTC,I really hope we don't see them fight the Reds and Blues. Carolina finally turned a new leaf and is a good person to see her and Church fight their friends and possibly erase all the good they have done would be a real downer.

RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,God_Given_Talent,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:40:40 2015 UTC,I really don't think they're ending the series. Burnie has mentioned that they'll keep making RvB as long as people keep wanting it. There's also the fact that there's a book in the works. I don't see it ending any time soon.

RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,Dan_Of_Time,2,Mon Mar 9 05:28:04 2015 UTC,"This is what I said over on the RT subreddit:  Epsilon was based off the Alpha and gained his memories after having brief contact with him. He of course now lives on as the Alpha's replacement, except he can use his AI abilities and seems far more skilled than the Alpha (Mainly since he can utilize other characteristics such as logic etc).   The last time we saw the Alpha is when he entered the Meta's head/helmet. Then the EMP went off supposedly deleting him. I would have believed this if it wasnt for the surprise return of the Meta's helmet at the end of last season. For this reason I believe that SOMEHOW the Alpha survived, and in some extremely peculiar way he will return.   This could explain why Epsilon ""dies"". He may sacrifice himself for the Alpha or die beforehand. Now the reason I believe this is simple, Epsilon provides them with too much power. I noticed this recently when re-watching season 12. As a crew they now have 2 Freelancers for the action and an AI for all the working out. I don't see RT wanting to retain this so to speak. By cutting Epsilon out they would somewhat hamper this power they have. Another reason is purely narrative, Church has always insulted his other versions, calling them dicks. I couldn't think of anything funnier than 2 Church's at the same time. I think that would be a great subplot for season 13.  Anyway, this is all my personal theory and has too many problems for me to even hope they do it. Maybe I just won't accept any more Church deaths, What can I say, I hate goodbyes."
RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,God_Given_Talent,0,Sun Mar 8 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend formatting your comment better. It's a wall of text.  Otherwise.   Epsilon was based off the Alpha and gained his memories after having brief contact with him.   I've always been against this because Epsilon has always been different from Alpha in terms of their more detailed personalities. Alpha was more of an asshole that was earnestly trying to lead the Blue team and do the right thing.  Epsilon has always been a little more arrogant and doesn't exactly treat the Blue Team the same way. I'd say that Alpha was a Blue Team Soldier while Epsilon is a Freelancer AI.    For this reason I believe that SOMEHOW the Alpha survived, and in some extremely peculiar way he will return   I would probably rage hard if this happened because the Alpha had one of the best moments in the entire series and the idea that he magically survived something that is specifically designed to kill him is just too ludicrous. It would completely undermine a lot of stuff.   I couldn't think of anything funnier than 2 Church's at the same time.   I think this would be funny as well. Except I think it'd fit more as a non-canon PSA.   Otherwise, I can understand how killing off Epsilon Church would drastically change the power balance. I can really see the next seasons/arcs excluding the freelancers or showing off a powerless Reds and Blues. I think Wash can stay though. He did pretty well last season as he switched positions with Tucker from season 11 in that now he's able to make jokes and have fun."
RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,God_Given_Talent,2,Sun Mar 8 19:19:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't notice the formatting when I posted that, It was copy/pasted from the RT sub and it seems to have messed up the paragraphs. I agree it would undermine his entire exit, sort of make season 7 less ""impacting"" on the crew. Personally I think it would be worth it for the sake of bringing back the funnier Church.  I think Wash fits in great, noticeably in season 11 he was the one to have a plan and put everyone in place, similar thing he did in Season 6 and a somewhat similar thing Tex did in Blood Gulch."
RedvsBlue,2y6g3p,UnfeelingRug,0,Sun Mar 8 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's a little too farfetched that everything from before was a story in the files. It seems way too much like a cop out in a way."

The reference is only a small thing and played out as such on RvB.  Simmons: Hey, that's not exactly what happened.  Grif: Yes, it is.

RedvsBlue,2y412s,DaylightDarkle,7,Fri Mar 6 06:03:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Alpha died, I believe, but may not be correct, that Epsilon has Alpha's memories or something like that? It doesn't sound right to me, someone else might be able to explain it better."
RedvsBlue,2y412s,Agent_A,3,Fri Mar 6 06:02:40 2015 UTC,"Epsilon was the memory fragment of the Alpha. However the fragmentation happened before the Blood Gulch, so Epsilon should not have the memories of those events. This is counteracted by Caboose telling epsilon stories. It is also possible that before the escape at the end of season 6 that the Alpha and Epsilon had some level of contact and allowed some memory transfer. Both of those explain why season 9 is all ""off"" memories of the events of the past."
RedvsBlue,2y412s,God_Given_Talent,3,Fri Mar 6 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"Alpha died, but the time Alpha and Epsilon spent together, when Epsilon was sending flashes of memory at Alpha, was a two way transfer of information.   So, practically all Alpha's memories and personality was recorded to Epsilon, making the Church in Epsilon kinda like a backup version of Alpha, and potentially all the A.I.s. in there as are similarly ""backed up."""

RedvsBlue,2y2zlo,shisno636,3,Fri Mar 6 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"So best I can guess Wyoming didn't see a point to loop, seeing as it was useless against Tucker and he had several copies of him self at his disposal. Essentially he would loop and Tucker would just foil him again, so the brute force of one hundred Wyomings made a better option (It also thinned out the copies). Looking at the situation he would have eventually won had Gerry (Gamma Here) not been captured before he was finally defeated.  That's how I see it, but then again the end of season 5 they just threw it out the window story wise and just said, ""Time travel it makes sense, whatever."""

RedvsBlue,2y2zlo,boxesofboxes,0,Fri Mar 6 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"It basically boils down to this: season 1-5 we're made for fun. When RT started RvB they didn't expect it to get so huge, and it was just basically just them screwing around in halo. As it got a bigger following the story evolved, and originally season 5 had like, 6 different endings. They decided they wanted to take a more story based approach starting in season 6, like in ""out of mind,"" but some of the silly stuff that happened in the Blood Gulch Chronicles didn't quite fit with the tone they were aiming for. I mean, BGC omega? is a cartoon villain! Anyway, it's all ""Sort of canon"" but the story we saw is the ones the BG Crew experienced, not what ACTUALLY happened. What that may be, we'll probably never know. Anyway this is just my understanding on it, grain of salt recommended."

They reference things that happen in the BGC and they even ended season 10 talking about sending the alpha AI to a secure location to be protected by Captain Flowers. It seems like canon to me.  Edit: plus you mentioned out of mind, which takes place during the events of the BGC and York dies then, which is then brought up in season 10. They even go to where he died."

(S6, E19)  Dear Chairman,  I am disappointed by your decision to press charges, but I am not surprised. My only hope is that the courts will see the matters differently than you have. You see; I never had the chance to serve in battle. Nor did fate provide me the opportunity to sacrifice myself for humanity as it did for so many others in the Great War. Someone extremely dear to me was lost very early in my life. My mind has always plagued me with the question: If the choice had been placed in my hands, could I have saved her? The memory of her has haunted me my entire life, and more so in these last few years than I could ever have imagined. But, given the events of these past few weeks, I feel confident that had I been given the chance, I would have made those sacrifices myself…had I only the chance. I know that you disagreed with my methods and that others will as well. This is beyond my control. However, I cannot imagine that any court would be able to convict me no matter how low their opinion of my actions might be. You must understand one basic fact for all this to make sense, my dear Chairman: These AI, they all come from somewhere. They are all based on a person. Our ALPHA was no exception.  And while the law has many penalties for the atrocities we inflict on others, there are no punishments for the terrors that we inflict on ourselves.  So you send your men. They won’t find themselves a fight. They’ll only find an old man. An old man tired, but satisfied he did his duty. An old man weary from a mind more filled with memory than it is with hope.  Sincerely yours,  the former Director of Project Freelancer,  Dr. Leonard Church."

Imagine if Omega or Sigma tried to fight Alpha for control, or the other fragments end up effecting Church's mind in ways without meaning to.  I could see them removing the other A.I. in a situation where they threaten Church's health, and seeing how shedding the Tex memories had little negative effects, it might not be so bad.

Besides, if they had used Omega's voice, it's easier to say, ""Church didn't mean it, that was Omega talking."" But Church himself was angry. He wasn't possessed or anything.

This... this shadow!?""  Epsilon: ""He needs to pay.""    Both scenes were tough, both were meant to cut deeply.  The first, with the Reds and Blues, was to show that the ones closest to you, are the ones you can hurt the most.  The second, with Carolina and the Director was Epsilon bleeding out the betrayal the Director had inflicted on him.  For all intents and purposes, Alpha was the Director's son; the Director made him, brought him into being, essentially, gave him life.

From my original comment:   he wasn't possessed or anything   Originally when the Reds and Blues were infected by Omega, they were the ones who were possessed and taken over. That never happened to Alpha, because it couldn't have. Then they all got deleted except for Epsilon, who remembers Omega enough to convincingly act like him when he wants to. He wanted to act like Omega in the Director scene, and so he did. He didn't want to act like Omega when he was mad at the guys, and so he didn't."
RedvsBlue,2x9cj1,Karthinator,9,Sat Feb 28 15:54:01 2015 UTC,"When confronting the Reds and Blues, he was just pissed at them.  When he confronted the Director, he wanted to prove a point, that of all the things that had happened to him, none of them compared to what the Director had done to him."
RedvsBlue,2x9cj1,Simusar,2,Thu Feb 26 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that that scene was probably a side effect of the memories of the A.I.s in his mind.

RedvsBlue,2wvoxc,Haersh,5,Mon Feb 23 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to do this is say that they proceeded abnormally for their simulation. Like, there's no way that Tex was supposed to be in Blood Gulch, since she parted ways with PFL at the end of Season 10, meaning that Tex And Omega were not supposed to be in the simulation. So, onto why the scenario in blood gulch was different. The normal scenario involves a crazy AI and an alien impregnating a soldier. As part of this, VIC is instructed to call for Agent Wyoming at the appropriate time. However, Omega realizes that Church is the Alpha, and he gets Wyoming and Gamma onboard with producing new fragments, leading to the misadventures in blood gulch being markedly different. At he end, we can presume Tex is tricked into helping Wyoming and Gamma, who are still trying to cause Alpha to fragment, so she goes along with their plan to leave in the ship, since Tex being taken away was able to cause a fragmentation before. However, Tex's bomb, Andy, isn't supposed to be on the ship in Omega and Gamma's plan. This leads to the pelican crashing after Season 5, when originally Gamma and Omega would have returned to collect the fragment they were trying to create.   TL;DR: Tex and Omega weren't supposed to be there, and they fucked up what was otherwise a normal simulation."

I figure she's going after Wyoming because he's still with PF and working for the Director, at least as far as she knows. And whether or not he is, he's got answers she's looking for. Answers about the project since her departure, answers about the Director's plans and location.  And the alien thing?

RedvsBlue,2wgnrc,TodtheT1000,2,Fri Feb 20 04:30:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's Church. Wait, on second thought it's Tucker. No, might be Wyoming. No, I think it's Sarge. No, it's Lopez. No, it's Dos Point Oh. No, it's Grif. No, it's Simmons. I think. Maybe it's Epsilon?"
RedvsBlue,2wgnrc,sesni345,3,Sat Feb 21 23:02:57 2015 UTC,Best doodle ever. Of all time.
RedvsBlue,2wgnrc,ElskeFryst,2,Thu Feb 19 21:00:50 2015 UTC,thank(s)! :)  edit. i hate my brain!
RedvsBlue,2wgnrc,x-soldierside-x,2,Thu Feb 19 21:25:00 2015 UTC,Thank.
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,Luey_99,6,Thu Feb 19 20:11:24 2015 UTC,It's a season and you should watch it
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,Tman972,7,Fri Feb 20 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"Reconstruction has always been the favorite among the more discussive RvB fans, but Season 12 very well might be the new one. It's well written, full of detail, littered with developments, and the stakes are higher than ever. (Additionally, the new external animation is slick, and used appropriately. Just don't expect the over-the-top action of the PFL Saga.)  As of now, it's my new favorite, and this fourth saga is looking to be the strongest and most well-assembled yet."
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,TaylorCulosis,5,Thu Feb 19 20:52:34 2015 UTC,Pretty much what everyone else as said. It's a great season lot of fun moments and a fantastic plot.  I believe every franchise/series comes to a point where the quality drops. Red vs Blue hasn't hit that yet.
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,TodtheT1000,3,Fri Feb 20 04:32:13 2015 UTC,By far my favorite season. So much character development and had a TON of really well done twists! Highly recommend
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,RoseHearth,2,Thu Feb 19 21:57:29 2015 UTC,Most people love it.
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,OtakuMecha,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:34:30 2015 UTC,I think it's fucking awesome!
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,BlueBlazeMV,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:17:56 2015 UTC,"I think Season 12 really breaks way from the PFL saga, without actually doing so. The former arc provided the gateway into what the current scenarios are, and I think it was really mind boggling the way they tackled the story's twists. Definitely one of my favorite seasons, which I didn't think would happen."
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,ominousdeathheart,1 point,Sat Feb 21 22:03:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's GREAT! Like everyone else thinks. Though does anyone think they nerfed Carolina and wash a bit too much compared to Felix and Locus? I thought they were actually good fighters. I mean the fighting in this is more realistic, but still I thought they went too far,"
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,Melk73,5,Sun Feb 22 13:10:33 2015 UTC,"I see a way for this to make sense. Washington is easier, since we've never actually seen him kick much ass and he's constantly made fun of for being the shittiest Freelancer. Afterwards, he undergoes two near-death experiences at the hands of the Meta in a relatively short time frame. As a result, Wash hasn't actually been shown as 'hyper-competent' like the other Freelancers, and thus his power level seems fairly consistent. Carolina, on the other hand, is normally a hyper-competent badass, so explaining her lack of ability involves details from Season 12. The big thing is that Carolina got stabbed in the leg, which explains why she doesn't beat the everliving shit out of Locus and Felix in episode 18. Before that, in Episode 11(?) we see Epsilon's analysis shows that Carolina is having 'bad dreams' and is not fighting at peak capacity anyways. That along with Epsilon failing to account for the knife from Felix can account for her much slower, less insane fighting."
RedvsBlue,2wgspg,theYOLOdoctor,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think that Season 12 does a very good job of keeping the stakes high and the plot interesting without having to use the over-the-top action sequences of the Project Freelancer era. The animated segments are evenly dispersed and used appropriately. If you weren't satisfied with S11, S12 is a very pleasant surprise in contrast. I'm hyped for S13."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,UsagiTaicho,16,Tue Feb 17 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"Sarge is human. The time as a ""ghost"" was Church interacting with Sarge's unconscious mind similar to the armor lock seen in series.. 8.. I think. The armor lock was a bit of a retcon I believe."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,PrinceCheddar,9,Wed Feb 18 08:46:26 2015 UTC,"This. ^  It was confirmed that Sarge was in armor lock via one of the DVD commentaries. (The one for Revelation/8, I believe)  Very similar to when Donut was shot at the end of Recreation then we see him in S10 claiming that his armor locked up on him."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,TaylorCulosis,1 point,Wed Feb 18 10:46:04 2015 UTC,Oh ok. Thanks for clearing that up. I must have missed that. I need to rematch the series from season six and onward.
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Simusar,4,Thu Feb 19 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"Except that Florida was never shown to be given an AI.  Not all of the Freelancers were given AIs, CT never got one, South never got one, she stole York's, and tried to steal North's."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Simusar,2,Tue Feb 17 23:48:22 2015 UTC,"True, but he is never shown to not get an AI either."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,chimney3,7,Wed Feb 18 00:29:42 2015 UTC,Except that PFL made a point to show who had an AI.  Florida didn't even attend the AI class the rest of the agents did.
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Simusar,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:53:58 2015 UTC,It does seem unlikely but then Florida was easily the least shown agent... Who knows what we're missing about Flowers?
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,chimney3,4,Wed Feb 18 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"Georgia and Utah were shown less, they only made it into the after credits scene on the dvd.  But seeing as how we, the viewers are made aware each time a new AI fragment is harvested, with the exception of Omega, but we are shown Omega after he enters into the story in Season 10.  Also, if Florida had an AI, then Epsilon would remember it, and Church is not shown to have any memory of an AI assigned to Florida."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Simusar,2,Wed Feb 18 03:52:19 2015 UTC,"Trusting Epsilon's memory as a sort of reliable narrator at this point is premature. He only just realized he's a computer. How can we trust the memory of a being who is memory incarnate, yet has taken so long to come to grips with his abiotic nature?  I could easily see Rooster Teeth pull a Yoda style ""there is another"" moment.  Highly, highly unlikely but far from impossible."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,emPtysp4ce,2,Wed Feb 18 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"Except that Epsilon stated ""I just remembered... everything.""  Does that mean everything PFL ever did?  Or just everything about the Director?  Even still, if it is just about the Director, that would include a list of all Agents who were given AIs.  Another explanation for ""Sarge as a 'ghost'"" thing is that Church was in Sarge's head at the time of the shot, so that could explain their ability to see each other as ""ghosts""."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,chimney3,3,Wed Feb 18 07:46:24 2015 UTC,I think Burnie confirmed everyone from Blood Gulch is human.
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,ibbolia,4,Wed Feb 18 02:26:55 2015 UTC,Even... Church? O'Malley? The alien? ANDY???  ANDY!!!!! YOU'RE DEAD!!!!!
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Feb 18 03:43:18 2015 UTC,Oh really? So Sarge was really a ghost then?
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"Even if Sarge wasn't human, he wouldn't be a part of the Alpha. His name doesn't match up with the others in any way (The Sigma character is taken, and none of the other letters really work), and at one point all the named AI are at least mentioned (on a screen or something during Project Freelancer), and lastly it's explicitly stated that PFL only got to use one AI (that was split). So the only AI Freelancers get to use are all a part of the same base.  Other than that, we see him in the ""ghost world"" again with Simmons and Grif (when it's revealed the effect is from Armor Lock), and we know both of them are human. Or Humanish, anyways. So outside word of god, there is precedent fro Sarge to be human."
RedvsBlue,2w90c4,Ifonlyihadausername,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:45:55 2015 UTC,Sarge was shot in the head  Tucker was killed by the rocket  Donut was killed by Wash  Grif was run over by the tank  Simmons gave him all his organs  Doc was killed by the Alien  Caboose died of blood loss  THERE ALL AI'S

(Might be worth checking Hulu as well)  My best advice is the RvB Wikia. They have full transcripts for all the episodes at the bottom of each page."
RedvsBlue,2w8868,TaylorCulosis,2,Tue Feb 17 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"Why Are We Here?:       The episode begins with Grif and Simmons standing on top of Red Base, seemingly on sentry duty. Simmons asks Grif if he knows why they are in Blood Gulch, but Grif misinterprets the question and assumes Simmons is talking about why they exist in the universe and their purpose in it and gives a long winded answer regarding whether there is a God or not. Simmons informs Grif of the mistake and asks if Grif would like to talk about it, but Grif refuses. Meanwhile, Church and Tucker are spying on the two Reds via the scope of Church's sniper rifle. Tucker asks what the two are doing, and Church says they are just talking and that Tucker is being annoying for continually asking that question. Tucker then says he's not able to see anything because he doesn't have the sniper rifle, to which Church replies that he hates him. Back at Red base, Grif and Simmons continue their conversation, talking about finding aliens to fight, when Sarge orders them down.

RedvsBlue,2w5npi,hoppynsc,7,Tue Feb 17 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"My guess would be because Carolina got two AI, so she was kind of North and South in one."
RedvsBlue,2w5npi,Aghan,6,Tue Feb 17 05:02:39 2015 UTC,"The freelancers got designations before they got AI, and Carolina especially was never supposed to have 2 AI.  They used North and South Dakota as twins for testing, I believe that's why they had North and South and Carolina was on it's own. Having an easily identifiable name would probably very important."
RedvsBlue,2w5npi,TodtheT1000,2,Tue Feb 17 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"That is the official reason as stated numerous times by the crew. My question is, I know the freelancer storyline is pretty much over, but will we ever get information about Virginia and west Virginia? Perhaps an AI fragment that was itself further fragmented, or a cloning experiment?"
RedvsBlue,2w5npi,Donbuster,5,Tue Feb 17 05:14:34 2015 UTC,"that cant be the reason because they were named before the directer even managed to split the AIs  imo the only answer taht makes sense is they simply didnt have 50 freelancers and theres a north and south dekota because there siblings, if they werent siblings one would be dakota and the other would be some other state"

RedvsBlue,2w5npi,ThatSlyDevlin,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"It's probably just because North and South are twins, and Carolina has no twin."

I still love the show, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't complain if the Reds and Blues just shat around for a season or two."
RedvsBlue,2w4dim,DrSoap,5,Tue Feb 17 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"To me, Season 11 was some of the best shitting around in recent memory. It was just plot-driven enough to keep people happy, especially in the last few episodes, but before then it was mostly just the Reds & Blues doing their thing.

How does Tex an expert in combat, being able to defeat both the Reds and Tucker, by defeat I mean kick the living shit out of them. I don't understand how she was captured by them.

Well, there's a ship floating in the atmosphere—this ship has the exact same shape and rocket booster configuration as the Staff of Charon. I'm thinking that since both the Rebels and the Army of Chorus had no potential way of bringing in ships safely into the Chorus atmosphere without Locus and Felix destroying it, that this ship was indeed the Staff of Charon dropping off PFL cargo or other alien tech that we saw scattered across the Charon Industries facilities during the PFL saga.

The other AI aren't just multiple personalities, but are fragments from the Alpha. Sounds similar, but I believe there is an important distinction that will make more sense as you watch the following seasons. Without going into spoilers, in the coming seasons, you'll learn that the original Alpha and Church-Alpha are 'different'. (Same 'person', but different.)  The meta is basically just a rogue freelancer that wanted to achieve [REDACTED] by obtaining other AI / armor enhancements. You'll learn more details / back story about it later.

I don't know why exactly RoosterTeeth used that instead of another CGI of a person like they did for Command, but it is not the director himself.

Even if you didn't love the early stuff, you'll probably enjoy it from there."
RedvsBlue,2uogbi,Danobc,5,Wed Feb 4 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"so i got into it last week so here from the perspective from a newcomer:  i dont think its really that important to watch S1-5 if you want to jump into the story/plot right away, coz it really picks up with S6. Before S6 the plot is delivered very slowly and most of the episodes are ""just"" one joke after the other with very little plot.  Watch the two mini series Out of Mind and Recovery One and just start with S6 after that if you want to get into it as fast as you can. All your questions will be answered in just a few episodes and you can pick up on most of the character traits pretty fast and even if you dont pick up on some callback jokes it wont hamper your enjoyment at all.  Also another great answer form an older thread by /u/Sypilus:   There are three basic stories in this series  Seasons 1-5: The blood gulch chronicles Not serious at all, these seasons are just meant to be funny. If you want some laughs, start here.  Seasons 6-10: Recovery A more serious (and darker) plot. If you want a story-driven show, start here. I heavily recommend watching the miniseries Out of Mind and Recovery One if you start here.  Seasons 11+: The beginning of a new story arc. Is sort of a cross between the first two story arcs, and as a result takes a little time to develop the story. start here if you only plan on knowing enough of the story to watch season 12.  Basically, seasons 1-5 don't have a serious plot (and are character driven) and are just meant to be funny, while seasons 6 onward are much more story driven. And if you end up starting with season 6, I'd heavily recommend watching the out of mind and recovery one miniseries first."

RedvsBlue,2ujkpk,MarshallMelon,16,Mon Feb 2 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"Monty Oum was an incredibly hardworking man who brought us countless hours of entertainment. As seen through many comments from other employees, Monty devoted his entire life into his work, staying late at the office and even sleeping over. Starting from humble beginnings, Monty worked his heart out and made his way to Roosterteeth, where he first started animating in Red vs Blue: Recreation. When I first saw that Warthog jump through the gate at Washington, I was hooked. He impressed me more and more throughout the series, and when I thought the fight scenes in Revelation were impressive, he just blew me away in Seasons 9 and 10.   RWBY was his brainchild, his dream come true. The amount of love and passion he had for the show was showed. His imagination and creativity added something to the world that we will never forget. I think it's important that we remember his accomplishments and be inspired by them. As said, go out and create. Be imaginative. Make things. Add to the world, no matter how good or bad you might think you are. It's the best way to remember him. As long as we keep thinking of him, he never truly dies. After all, memory is the key."

When he escaped, Wyoming's equipment sent him back in time so that the loop wouldn't be unbroken."
RedvsBlue,2u75tt,montezumasleeping,3,Sun Feb 1 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"the official story for Yellow Church, as stated by Yellow Church, started off as ""you don't wanna know"" but we later learned that it was Caboose mixing Sister with Church in his head, something that happened because his previous mental image of Church was killed and took awhile to regenerate as Caboose was taking his time figuring out Church's personality again, which is why he seemed particularly more stupid during those seasons than he does now.  As for why they merged, it's because Caboose's image of Church showed up again at the same time Caboose first saw Sister."

Its existence was similar to that of an A.I., but not nearly as advanced. The yellow church ""A.I."" unintentionally interacted with the equipment of Wyoming, which due to its time manipulating equipment, transferred the yellow church back in time to past Gamma.  At the time, Gamma was running a simulation, making Alpha believe he was repeatedly timetraveling. In reality, Gamma was just screwing with his head like he was ordered to back when The Director was forcing Alpha to split into the A.I. fragments. Gamma either decided to throw the Yellow Church into the simulation, or more likely, was to busy to notice it and it became a part of the simulation accidentally."

RedvsBlue,2u75tt,unknownchild,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure anyone understands.  I think, maybe, he's another Alpha fragment. But it wouldn't make much sense if it was in Caboose's head.  There's two possibilities:   He was left in there the last time Church left Caboose's head. I want to say that was when he went in with Tex to kill Omega, but I could be wrong. If that was the case, the strain of four intelligences in Caboose's head (his own, Alpha, Beta, and Omega) could have created some corruption of one or all of them. YC is possibly then a bastardized version of Caboose's image of Church. Remember how in episode 100 we don't see Church's doppelgänger?  Potentially, the pressure of the simulation that Gamma ran that Church escaped from to get to the Halo 2 engine combined with the stress he was likely under in the time leading up to his re-entry into Caboose's mind might have been enough to break something away. Once he gets into an environment where Alpha can lose that piece of him, he does and ejects the new AI into Caboose, manifesting itself as Yellow Church.    Both of these account for why he was ejected from Caboose by the grenade as Alpha was.  How he was sent to Sidewinder in the CE engine is unknown. It's seems due to Wyoming's time distortion unit, but since we know all that time warping shit due to the explosion never happened and was Gamma attempting to break Alpha again that isn't likely, and Gamma was in the ship at the time anyway. Wyoming's armor may have automatically absorbed a free AI like how Alpha was able to pick up armor around him. The CE environment could have been YC's perception of the storage area.  Maybe."

RedvsBlue,2tq8tj,DARKDevastat0r,11,Mon Jan 26 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Mine would have to be Tucker. He seems like the most relatable character out of the cast (Wash is a close second). He may be an all around badass for the most part(at least in his mind), but his plans seem to almost always fail or backfire in some way. He doesn't really get that everything he has done really is the root of a large percent of the groups problems and because of that he seems the most normal. He is the only one who seemed to genuinely care about Church (when he was going through the moodswings of anger and sadness after the whole team ordeal in s9-10) despite covering it up as happiness. Whenever he gets mad at people he always manages to forgive them (such as Church and Carolina in s12) even if he really doesn't want to, showing he can't really hold a grudge as it's just the human thing to do. Grif was angry but never really cared to begin with, Simmons felt his superior intelligence gave him a reason to not care, Sarge was, well, Sarge, Caboose felt mainly sadness, not anger, separating him from the others, but only Wash and Tucker felt genuine anger, and both show human qualities by not being able to stay mad after being apologized to. The only reason Tucker trumps Wash is that Wash knows so much and has so many experiences to guide him on the right path whereas Tucker doesn't. Tucker still has to learn that what he does actually effects more than just him, making him a very likeable and relatable character as most people spend their whole lives doing so just as he has."

RedvsBlue,2tq8tj,BoneArrowInfinity,2,Wed Jan 28 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"Favorite Red: Sarge. He's taken being ""a part of a military unit"" so far that it is just plain funny. As someone who watches for more for the comedy than the plot (Seasons 1-5 and 7 best ever) he really provides that for me, and his speeches even get me into the mood for the mission they are about to undertake.  Favorite Blue: Caboose. Memory is the key. Also apparently comedy. He is the source of most of the laughs and also the source of the plot holes. I like the idea that's been thrown around that he's the only character that ""knows they're in a video game.""  Favorite Freelancer: Washington. From his inception, I always thought he was cool. I love how he is developed into a man without a mission in his life in Seasons 9-10, and kind of ""hangs it cool"" with the other Freelancers, despite all of the seriousness they seem to exude. I also like how in later seasons he takes responsibility for the Reds and Blues, standing up for them where he previously would have just let them go. His character has excellently evolved throughout the series, and I'm hoping he still changes.  Favorite AI: Four-way tie between Alpha-Church, Beta (Tex), Epsilon-Church, and Epsilon-Tex. Tex has always been a very iconic character for the ""Freelancer"" archetype, and I think she served her role well as the epic-style character that she was set up to be. Church is just Church, with all of his quirks (sniper rifle much). Also, he manages to be incredibly funny in Season Seven with his new ""floating bowling ball"" body."

Only a full AI can go Rampant, after a AI goes rampant there are VERY few examples of AIs coming out the other end alive but it does happen, When Sigma found out about Rampancy he wanted experience it by collecting ALL the other AIs so he would form a full AI and go through rampancy and come go through the final stage METAstability, which is how he got his name"

RedvsBlue,2t6x5h,MLP_lucas,23,Wed Jan 21 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"Tex and Church wonder the same thing in season 5, and Tex says something along the lines of ""There's a lot of people telling us lies.""    The only people who really confirm that they're that far into the future are Vic (whose job it seems is to lie to the characters) and Gary (who is made of deceit).   It's heavily implied that the explosion in season 3 only sent them a few years into the future - long enough for Sheila to fix up the bases and go a little screwy, not long enough for the ""war"" to end. Also consider how, when Tex meets up with York, neither he nor Delta find anything strange about her reappearance. If they really had time-jumped 1000+ years, you'd think someone would have said ""Holy crap, where have you been for the last 1000 years?"" Wash says that Command was behind everything that has happened to the Blood Gulch teams all along, so the timeskip might have been completely fake. In Chapter 4 of Recreation, when Donut mentions to the Counselor that the reason they were at that base where they fought O'Malley was because they were sent to the future, the Counselor is extremely confused. We then learn that Sarge's conclusion that they were several thousand years into the future was based on very shaky logic. Said 'logic' was that the place they were in had an intact base and a lot of ice. After the explosion, wrecked base and no ice. Sarge takes this to mean an ice age has ended and they are now in the future. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't heat melt ice? And, y'know, explosions blow buildings up? Sarge is a master of the Bavarian Fire Drill. According to Freelancer records, that is training scenario 3.     http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/RedVsBlue"
RedvsBlue,2t6x5h,vicfire,8,Wed Jan 21 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"The theory that makes the most sense to me is that the bomb didn't send anyone into the future or the past. The ""bomb"" inside Church was essentially a really powerful concussive/flash grenade, which knocked everyone out. While they were all unconscious, freelancer agents moved them to the desert, and possibly altered their armor, which is why they thought they had traveled into the future past the ice age and Tucker didn't recognize anyone when he woke up. (This also explains why there guns change.)  Church wasn't sent back into time when the bomb went off, he was captured by Gary (GAMA) who provided him with more scenarios that he couldn't succeed in.  While the gang wasn't at Blood Gulch, freelancer forces went in and upgraded the bases. After which, they programmed Sheila to think that it had been a long time and that she had upgraded the bases herself.  Them NOT traveling in time explains why Kaikaina (Grif's sister) and the Freelancers are still alive/around when the gang gets back into the action.  Everything that happened had been planned out by Project Freelancer in advance, but not told to the Reds, Blues, or Tex. Everyone else was in on it. Even Washington confirmed it when he told them everything that happened to them was scenario #3.  Somebody let me know if I missed anything."
RedvsBlue,2t6x5h,flipcarroll,0,Wed Jan 21 22:43:58 2015 UTC,Church literally effected things by being sent back though so he at least did literally travel through time

It was to give him the illusion that he could change things, just not affect the overall outcome of major events. I still think that flowers just died from a heart attack, or faked his own death. Same with the Sheila/F.i.l.s.s. name change. The tank's OS was already named Sheila, but Gary recognized the similar voice between the tank and the main Project Freelance AI and faked the name change just to add to the illusion that Church had some control."

RedvsBlue,2t6x5h,Forikorder,2,Sun Jan 25 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"The ghost shooting a rocket is just because, technically, the show doesn't have to follow the rules of the normal Halo canon. For all we know, the ghost could have been altered by Project Freelancer. Similar to how the Fuel Rod Cannon, Brute Shot, and Plasma Rifles are all in possession of Project Freelancer and Charon Industries and are modified. The Sniper Rifle could have just been destroyed when Church got shot with the tank and left out in the open for Caboose to find (Project Freelancer's doing).  And if we were to go off of the time travel theory, how is Gary back in ""the past"" with Church to send him to Blood Gulch, and how are the Freelancers and the Insurrectionist's leater still around in ""the future"" during seasons 6, 7, and 8?"

RedvsBlue,2t6x5h,TaylorCulosis,4,Thu Jan 22 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"Easy Answer is the show wasn't supposed to last as long as it did so there's bound to be errors.  What I like to think though is that everything church ""experienced"" in the past was part of a computer simulation ran by Garry. Garry or Gamma has done this in the past in torturing Alpha.  The reds and blues later on find out everything was a simulation exercise. So the whole explosion I believe was an exercise for Wyoming, who conveniently disappears after the explosion.   The explosion was in fact some of device that incapacitated the reds and blue, at which point project freelancer put them somewhere else in order to start the next simulation ""in the future"".  Of course everything I just said is pure speculation."

RedvsBlue,2szh3y,SchrodingersShrink,5,Mon Jan 19 23:33:01 2015 UTC,How did Wash help him become Church again?
RedvsBlue,2szh3y,OptionK,8,Mon Jan 19 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the Epsilon ""A.I."" itself is a blank slate, devoid of its own personality, but it contains copies of all the A.I. personalities. When it was first given to Wash, there was no order, all the personalities were out of control, all of them suffering from reliving the torture Alpha went through.  Caboose's stories gave the memories of Church something to latch onto, something positive for it to focus on, making it stronger until it became the dominate personality.   Essentially, the character we call as Epsilon is more or less a copy of the original Alpha that exists within Epsilon, along with the copies of the other A.I. It's just he's the one in charge internally. Since copying A.I. is supposed to be impossible, it's kind of a big deal that this has happened. Something the Chairman probably wants to get his hands on."
RedvsBlue,2szh3y,PrinceCheddar,4,Tue Jan 20 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"Well, that one episode from season 12 clearly showed he was schizo.   That's my thoughts on Epsilon."

RedvsBlue,2szh3y,Forikorder,2,Tue Jan 20 06:27:10 2015 UTC,"Alpha was the fragmented one. Epsilon was one of those fragments. Those were his memories of the other fragments, but the fact that they inhabit more or less complete personalities in his head indicates some kind of mental illness. I said schizophrenia because that's most easily recognized."

RedvsBlue,2szh3y,Forikorder,3,Tue Jan 20 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really say he's schizophrenic. He's not hallucinating the voices in his head and he's not under some delusion. The way I understand it, he literally has copies of the other A.I.s within his mind that he can run.   Are you perhaps thinking of dissociative identity disorder; AKA: multiple personality disorder?  Even then, I wouldn't say it's a disorder (at least not yet). Epsilon is the memory, it's just doing what it does, remembering how Alpha and the other A.I. and how they act and what they know.  Either way, Epsilon is a product of an unusual experiment on a technology that is fictional. It's hard to say if what Epsilon is doing should be considered ""abnormal"" when we don't really understand what should be considered normal in that situation. Hence why I don't think you should refer to.. whatever it is Epsilon is doing as a form of mental disorder.   Although personally, I kinda hope he does start to go crazy and they're forced to extract the other personalities from him. This means the Blood Gultch crew gets new A.I. helpers, Locus and Felix can somehow get a hold of Omega and Sigma for their own usage, and Church starts feeling lonely without them, which leads to melancholia which is the first stage of rampancy."

And if you think about it, he could be hallucinating them. Their programs don't actially exist on Epsilon's...hard drive? Dunno. Anyway, it's really jusr E there, which means all the other AIs aren't real. Since memories don't go into hat muh detail, likely even for a computer built around memories, it's entirely possible if you ask me."

RedvsBlue,2svojm,Simusar,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:30:19 2015 UTC,"When Church takes control the other person can't even speak.  Simmons sees Sarge as a father figure, and also has repressed feelings about his own father(several hints leading to Simmons's father leaving early in his life).  Sarge also, while respecting Simmons more than Grif, doesn't treat Simmons particularly well.  Each person Omega possessed, retained aspects of their personality while under its control.  Epsilon and Alpha take complete control, supplanting Church's personality over their own."
RedvsBlue,2svojm,Forikorder,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:04:22 2015 UTC,"the people he posses dont generally have the opportunity too, he usually either posseses someone for an extremely short amount of time like Griff or something without will like the brainless robots  also remember Lopez was able to fight Churchs possesion so you are overestimating his ability  also again Epsilon and Alpha do not posess sentient beings long enough for us to say for certain how concious the person is underneath, also Omega has not possessed people under the same conditions as Alpha/Epsilon did so a perfect comparison is impossible, the only comparable situation was with Sarge, and since Church was possesing him as a stealth operation he would have been very careful to allow no actual Sarge-ism from leaking through unlike Omega who doesnt really care that someone knows if hes inside someone  if anything that Omegas personality can leak into the person being posessed hints at a stronger ability from him then Alpha/Epsilon, or at least possesion of a different form (Omega having more powerful but less control while Alpha retaining weaker possesion with more control)  also since Church was a ghost back in S1-5 the difference between them is because of that and should not be analyzed any further  also keep in mind that Captain flowers displayed none of the dual personality Doc exhibited so it could be that Omega simply didnt care if Doc crept through a bit during there time together"
RedvsBlue,2svojm,Simusar,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"Well, Alpha being the origional, and Omega being the fragment, means that Omega gets his abilities from Alpha.  By that reasoning, Alpha should be better at everything than any of the individual fragments because they are pieces of him.  They are incomplete parts of him, so anything they are capable of doing, is inherent to him.  When Church possessed someone, his voice took over theirs.  When Omega possessed someone his voice augmented theirs.  That shows the level of control/dominance that each has over the people they've controlled."

RedvsBlue,2svojm,Simusar,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"But Alpha isn't shown to have lost any capability even after the fragments are removed, they're emotional cores after all.  They don't remove his abilities, only certain aspects of his personality, such as his logic, and ability to trust.  There is nothing to suggest that the emotional cores are able to perform any action that Alpha is not, even devided as he is."
RedvsBlue,2svojm,Forikorder,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:08:26 2015 UTC,"presumably? who else would be able to   I always assumed that he learned it from the memories of Alpha. I mean, if the memories of Omega could teach Epsilon how to jump bodies, why wouldn't his own memories do the same? Once Epsilon got its memories all in order, it was able to relearned it from those memories.  But I might be wrong. If Epsilon did interact with Omega to learn how to jump bodies, it was probably a one time thing. Church obviously doesn't like him to interact with him in normal situations."

RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,AmethystWind,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:10:46 2015 UTC,"Well that really depends on which Tex was the original Beta and not a clone. Was it the Tex who died in the Pelican explosion over Blood Gulch? Or the Tex that beat the shit out of the Reds and Tucker after they woke her up and ""died"" in the A.I. unit? Or was Beta the A.I. that the Director still had in his bunker that he made all of the clones from?"
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,ibbolia,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:49:30 2015 UTC,"The one in the Pelican Crash, we're led to believe, is the real Tex/Beta.  The one that beat up Tucker and the Reds is Epsilon Tex.  Church's ""Oh no, he kept trying to get her right"" implies that the Tex Army is not the real Tex/Beta either, that they are copies.  So far, all we know is that the real Tex/Beta fled away on the ice planet(possibly Sidewinder) after The Mother of Invention crashed.  Even if Tex ""died"" on the pelican that crashed in Valhala, when Meta was confronted by Church/Alpha, and Washington, Tex/Beta was nowhere to be found in the group of AIs he'd amassed.  So, did she escape?  Was she recovered by someone else, someone we may not have met yet?"
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,Forikorder,3,Mon Jan 26 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"Plus Church says they ""aren't done"", to which Tex replies ""Well then let's get started."""
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,ibbolia,1 point,Tue Jan 13 20:40:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say it was non-canon.  I'd also say that Kathleen has a very attractive voice in the trailer."
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,Forikorder,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"The official explanation is that the trailer is non-canon. But that's not as fun, so I rather think it's something more like this:  UNSC AIs, being commonly used in war scenarios, have to have some form of basic EMP shielding. Wikipedia tells me this is also a pretty basic concept, and likely one that would have been improved upon by the time Halo and RvB take place. Probably not strong enough to stay active when the emp goes off, but enough that they can and do recover over time. Especially since at the end of the last season Maine's armor and equipment seem to have been recovered, which would coincide with them not being done, could be a possible way that Alpha Church, Tex, and even the other AI fragments hang around."
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,autowikibot,3,Tue Jan 13 23:53:04 2015 UTC,"so the PFL had a final failsafe, then built there AIs to survive the final failsafe that they made to destroy the AIs?"
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,Forikorder,2,Wed Jan 14 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"Anything they would have built that could fry an AI chip remotely would also fry their own computers and equipment, so totally destroying it wouldn't really be helpful. The logic was probably to make it strong enough to disable them, they send a person out to get the AI, and break it's drive manually before it can reboot entirely.  Or, I just don't really remember much about what the Emp was actually doing in the plot."
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,Forikorder,3,Wed Jan 14 05:41:06 2015 UTC,"i think its more that AIs are not supposed to be turned ""off"" and if you shut it down with an EMP then it cant be turned on again  or maybe there just like ""fuck it"" and didnt really care that it would fry there computers, i mean if there destroying there AIs they probably dont care about them anyway"
RedvsBlue,2sbiyt,Forikorder,2,Wed Jan 14 05:48:28 2015 UTC,"Electromagnetic shielding:       Electromagnetic shielding is the practice of reducing the electromagnetic field in a space by blocking the field with barriers made of conductive or magnetic materials. Shielding is typically applied to enclosures to isolate electrical devices from the 'outside world', and to cables to isolate wires from the environment through which the cable runs. Electromagnetic shielding that blocks radio frequency electromagnetic radiation is also known as RF shielding.  The shielding can reduce the coupling of radio waves, electromagnetic fields and electrostatic fields. A conductive enclosure used to block electrostatic fields is also known as a Faraday cage. The amount of reduction depends very much upon the material used, its thickness, the size of the shielded volume and the frequency of the fields of interest and the size, shape and orientation of apertures in a shield to an incident electromagnetic field.

My favorite moment of the season is when Donut is taken prisoner and possessed by Church. Specifically when Church is negotiating as Donut with the Reds and just cant lie for shit. There is no such thing as a bad season in RvB, but this is one of my least favorite seasons which speaks volumes to how great the series is. Season 2 does a great job of really getting the story rolling by setting up the great season 3 perfectly. Can't wait for season 3 recap!!"

RedvsBlue,2rsenr,Hilgy17,7,Fri Jan 9 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like any choice has to be split up into the major arcs. Favorite of the Blood Gulch Chronicles, favorite of the Freelancer arc, and now favorite of the Chorus arc. Each 5-season arc is too different from the rest to really compare beyond itself.  My favorite of the BGC was probably season 4 with the ""great"" quest that the Blues went on. The Alien, the return of the Grunts, and the introduction of Tucker's badass sword are definitely highlights from this time.  Once focus shifted to the Meta and the Freelancers, things definitely got more action oriented, especially once Monty gave us the glorious cg battle scenes. While I love the Freelancer cg footage enough to have the entire set saved on it's own, I gotta go with either season 8 and how the Simulation Troopers proved themselves just as capable of handling themselves in a pinch. It wasn't some super soldier or another Freelancer that took out the Meta once and for all. It was the quick thinking of the Red army in perhaps their most glorious moment ever.  As for the two Chorus seasons thus far, I have to lean more towards 12. 11 was pretty funny and a welcome return to the classic style of the Blood Gulch days, but 12 had a more interesting story and situations, most notably the development of Tucker as a legit leader. On the inside, Tucker is still the same old pervert cracking jokes we knew back in the day, but he has probably developed the most out of all of the original 10 next to Church and Tex. I can't wait to see what Season 13 and beyond holds for him and possibly having him finally earn the mantle of Blue Team Leader."

Then one day my sister's boyfriend left his game case at my house. One of the discs inside was RvB Season 4, the most recent season at that time.  I had no idea what it was, but I knew it was related to Halo. So I started watching and I immediately realized that it was an adult thing, not meant for kids my age. But I turned the volume down and kept watching, and I loved it. I thought it was hilarious and I loved that it was made using Halo. For about a year I just watched that over and over, not even considering the fact that there was more. I was satisfied. But then I started going to the Library to get on the internet, and I realized I could watch the rest of it. Season 5 was already finished by that point, so I decided to watch from the beginning.  Now, 8 years later, I'm 17 and I still watch RvB every time a new episode comes out. And I watch that Season 4 DVD every night to fall asleep. That's why it's my favorite.  I also love Reconstruction though. The shift in direction, the fantastically narrated correspondence between The Director and The Chairman, the introduction of Washington, the awesome plot twist, the fact that it was the first season filmed in Halo 3, etc. And it retained a sizable element of the humor that made The Blood Gulch Chronicles so great. From a production standpoint, Season 6 probably is my favorite. But Season 4 will always have that sentimental value that gives it the edge."

RedvsBlue,2rsenr,Yustyn,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"While I really enjoy he freelancer backstory of seasons 9 and 10 I was a little disappointed by how it was handled... Project Freelancer seemed like it was only around for a few months, Wash had Epsilon implanted and taken out within a day or two, Elijah Wood was hyped up a lot but only had like 4 lines, and Carolina's A.I weren't given distinctive personalities like all the others, and North and York just kind of team up with Tex at the end because they had one conversation with her. We don't meet any new Freelancers except for Carolina (who is suddenly important in the modern story... We also meet C.T but she was already mentioned before, we don't meet anyone else NEW. We also finally get to see what Maine was like before he became the silent brutish Meta that we know... He was a silent brutish guy... That to me was the biggest missed opportunity.  Don't get me wrong I liked Seasons 9 and 10, but I just have some problems with it, and I  honk that the things they showed us worked better as somthing we heard about, seeing it unfold it didn't seem as grande or as cool as we were lead to believe. Does anyone else agree or am I just a jackass?"
RedvsBlue,2rsenr,ShadyShaun23,1 point,Fri Jan 9 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"This is probably one of the hardest questions ever of all time. For the longest time it was a toss up between 6 and 8. I loved 6 because I enjoyed the series getting a but more of a serious story while keeping the humor, not to mention the introduction of the most bad ass villain. The reveal of Church being the Alpha blew my mind and hooked me even more. Season 8 was amazing for the action of course and wrapping up the trilogy with the awesome Meta battle and Wash joining the team for good.  All that being said 10 has be my favorite. It just wrapped up so many things from the first 9 seasons it was mind blowing. The freelancer saga always had me on the edge of my seat and the fight scenes were masterful. I could go on for days about 10 but it has to be my favorite. I have to admit though season 12 may be one of my top 3 favorite seasons because of how much the reds and blues have grown but still stay true to their characters. Geez I could go on for days so I guess I will stop it here lol."
RedvsBlue,2rsenr,TodtheT1000,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"It would be between season 6 and 10.   Season 6 brought back all the characters and introduced them again so there was a couple minutes or so which focused on exactly what's great about character or relationship dynamic like Cabooses team killing and unfathomable stupidity, grif's lazyness, and simmon's uh... anal retentiveness.  Season 10 was probably the best story wise due to the way it developed the plot and ended the story arc."

RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,Grrrr_Cam,6,Wed Jan 7 20:43:39 2015 UTC,I always thought of it like this: sarge wasn't actually a ghost but went into armor lock mode. That's why shelia and church were there. They are AIs and thusly can be seen in Sarges helemt. Its kinda like what happened to ***** in season 8. I don't know how to do the black out text. Does that theory sound plausible or am I just silly?
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,cag0001,2,Thu Jan 8 02:36:01 2015 UTC,"There's a tip on how to do spoilers on the right side of the page labeled ""How to mark spoilers."" It's just hiding in plain sight.  OT: Yes, that's exactly what happened. It's in the commentary for Revelation (Season 8) that Sarge went into a sort of armor lock during S01E15."
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,Tailsmiles249,11,Thu Jan 8 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of stuff in the BG Chronicles were later mentioned as being not canon. I think is was the Season 5 audio commentary where Burnie stated that the multiple endings were a way to really mess with people on the fact that there were many ridiculous events that occurred in the previous seasons. Also, you realize that back then, they didn't even know they'd go past a single season, let alone 12.   When Reconstruction, or maybe even when Out Of Mind/S5/Recovery One came out, I think that's when they wanted to create a proper storyline."
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,x-soldierside-x,6,Wed Jan 7 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"This is extremely true, but they sort of explained it in season 8, where the reds are trapped in armor lock. Since they're in black and white like sarge was, so some people theorized that he didn't die but was in armor lock."
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,Tolkienreadsmymind,7,Wed Jan 7 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is basically what we thought was ""limbo"" or some kind of afterlife in that scene is actually AI Church interacting with Sarge's unconscious mind through some kind of lucid dream. Having an AI is seemingly implied to be like having two voices in your head as opposed to just one so it was pretty much just both of the voices in Sarge's head having a conversation. Bit thin I know but it at least keeps things moderately consistent between the BGC and later seasons."
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,todd360,2,Wed Jan 7 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"If by ""non-canon"" you mean the explanation in Revelation 17 then yes you are correct. Other than that, everything that has happened since Season 1 has happened canonically. Even Season 9 though only in the Epsilon unit."

RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,Forikorder,3,Sun Jan 11 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"Loose memories from the Alpha after suffering yet another traumatic event. He had trouble accepting what had occurred and he kept running through it again and again in his mind, a quality we've seen from all iterations of Church. As a result, when he stepped into Sarge's armor, Sarge encountered this memory of Sheila."
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,theYOLOdoctor,-2,Sun Jan 11 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"...  really? thats the answer your going with? are you really trying to say that everything that happened in S1-5 makes sense?  and even assuming that what you said makes sense, how would Sarge getting shot in the head make him think of Sheila enough to subconciously make her apear in Sarges fantasy armor lock world?"
RedvsBlue,2rnzbv,Forikorder,2,Sun Jan 11 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, I'm well aware that it doesn't make sense nor was it intended to, but I find pleasure in finding ways to keep both the absurdity and continuity in Red vs Blue. And I was more trying to say that the Alpha was still fairly recently 'dead' and without a body, so when he jumped into Sarge's armor, he brought the memory of Sheila 'killing' him. This is consistent with the idea of traumatic events inducing fragmentation in the Alpha as well as being consistent with Season 3 depicting that the Alpha still continues to fragment in near-death scenarios. if we're to try and induce continuity into early Red vs Blue, which is something I like to do, this explanation covers why Sarge 'died' and interacted with Church and Sheila."

It was all a game and we see a Halo 2 post game carnage report (where the Caboose -1 comes from).

I don't recommend basing it off RvB but it'll give you an idea on how to write the script. Use it as a base for the jokes. Swearing is not mandatory as indicated by Season 2. Your series can still be funny without it. NEVER use overly used pop-culture references.  Keep dialogue quick. Compare the dialogue between Season 1 and Season 5, you'll notice a difference in how fast the lines go. Have others read your script before going through with it. Just because you find something funny doesn't necessarily mean everyone has the same sense of humor. Critiques are important. Have fun!"

If all of the Tex robots were fragments of Beta, I feel as though that would have been brought up by Church or Washington while they were fighting them. (I say Church or Wash simply because they have more of a history with Project Freelancer.)

Church: You know, Caboose, I used to not care. I just went along with orders and hoped that everything would work out for me. But after all that has happened, you know what I learned? It's not about hating the guy on the other side because someone told you to. I mean, you should hate someone because they're an asshole, or pervert, or snob, or they're lazy, or arrogant, or an idiot, or a know-it-all. Those are reasons to dislike somebody. You don't hate a person because someone told you to. You have to learn to despise them on a personal level.

Everything is so much slower and less snappy. That said, this season really is still hilarious for the most part, I forgot how enjoyable the Reds and Blues just dicking around without any purpose or hidden organizations getting in the way. Questions to everybody else: Where the fuck is the command that Sarge was at, there's no way it was PF Command from Season 6. And why do they never call in an airstrike again?"
RedvsBlue,2nvnjp,CyberFreq,5,Mon Dec 1 05:23:31 2014 UTC,"I guess that's one of the many things that happened before the plot shift to ""there is no red vs blue"" that I guess could be a plot hole? Of course he could have just been visiting a fake base or something."

It's commonly used in English due to its feminine hygiene applications (a small bottle that is used to squirt liquid into private places in order to clean them, hence ""shower""), which in turn made it an insult.  I imagine Lopez' interactions with English speakers gave him access to their repertoire of insults, but not that of native Spanish speakers, and would therefore utilize the correct words but with limited effect due to translation error.  And now, I'm gonna go back to repressing my inner Simmons/Gus. >.>"

However, a new improvement I was happy to see was that they added SUBTITLES! XD  The bonus footage including the making of season 12 was really good and very entertaining.   Edit - Something that annoyed me with Season 11 was the chapter selection was pretty useless. There were no chapter titles and it only loaded everything from that chapter on so I couldn't find exactly where I left off.   The chapter selection is a little better considering the thumbnail/clips are a little more discernible for each episode. Still kind of wish they included chapter titles. The entire thing loads though so it's easier to go back and forth.   Edit 2 - Something interesting is the menu buttons are different on the main menu between the DVD & the Blu-Ray."
RedvsBlue,2n5baz,Aruseus493,1 point,Sun Nov 23 19:23:33 2014 UTC,I would pretty much be purchasing it for the support and the bonus footage.  So im glad to hear it was good.
RedvsBlue,2n5baz,EzioSC5,1 point,Mon Nov 24 01:37:48 2014 UTC,"It's good, same as just about every other RvB DVD/Blu-ray if you've ever had one. Full feature film style, can still watch in episodes if you want to for some reason, commentary is always enjoyable, PSAs and outtakes included, some behind the scenes stuff. As has been (sadly) true for a little while now, seemingly no easter eggs like they used to have all over the DVDs.

The audio mix is great, especially if you have a Sound Bar/Home Theater set-up. (It's 5.1 and whatnot) Only real gripe is that the audio commentary is way out of sync with what's on screen.  Also, there's a really bad cut from the end of then second episode to the third.   (SPOILERS)  It hard cuts from Rogers getting blown up to Grif starting his retelling of the Meta fight. Really jarring, and something that could've been avoided with just a few seconds of black.  (SPOILERS)"

RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,leadhound,22,Thu Nov 13 06:09:14 2014 UTC,"I always figured Tex and Church were set up to not know. When Church hears that he's an AI, he just kind of rejects the idea out-of-hand. In the face of all the proof presented to him, his response is basically ""....?? Nah.""  Tex and Church are both given full sized bodies for their protection. They've been heavily influenced by training- by which I mean mental conditioning- designed to keep them in their places.  We saw it happen to Delta, too. He woke up thinking his name was Alpha and that he had a past... but it didn't take long for him to accept that he was Delta and it was his birthday."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,chimney3,9,Thu Nov 13 14:34:23 2014 UTC,Yeah this was my first thought. Some sort of built in mental block.  Also plot convenience.
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,graywolfe42,26,Thu Nov 13 16:45:16 2014 UTC,Red vs Blue started as a comedy that wasn't planned for more than 7 episodes. All the Freelancer stuff was added in later so there are some continuity errors.
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,TheEliteNub,16,Thu Nov 13 08:22:08 2014 UTC,"Avoiding the easy answer of ""continuity errors"" (no offense), it doesn't seem like they ever took their armor off in front of each other. That's why people act surprised when Tucker says he's black and why Simmons has to keep reiterating that he's Dutch Irish. I assume there's some kind of feeding/cleaning/medical mechanisms in place. This would also explain why Carolina has nightmares involving the AIs.   So, Church not taking his armor off wouldn't shock anyone since NO one does. His lack of food intake can easily be attributed to some kind of code where the AI doesn't realize he HASNT eaten or disposed of waste. Then the two ""died"" and they didn't have to eat cause they were ghosts in robot shells. As far as Tex goes, she knew. She completely knew. Even if the FP didn't explicitly TELL her, she was informed by CT, accepted Church being a ""ghost"" really well, and didn't really need explanations."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,madamfray,2,Thu Nov 13 17:46:50 2014 UTC,"or they kidnapped some dude and put Alpha in him so the Alpha just thinks thats his body and never realises hes actually controlling someone elses  maybe a clone or something  also Wash has to constantly tell Tucker not to sleep nakes, and Donut has been known to not like his armour touch bare skin and walk around naked so they do take it off at times"
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,Forikorder,2,Tue Nov 18 05:40:50 2014 UTC,Same with church! Wouldn't they know they weren't human? Everyone else can take their armor off but they can't. Wouldn't they notice something like that?
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,RoseHearth,2,Thu Nov 13 07:00:52 2014 UTC,I figured the robot body just looks perfectly human under the armor. Like synthetic skin and such.
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,OtakuMecha,1 point,Thu Nov 13 20:12:28 2014 UTC,"Alpha, however, in a sense merged with the Director. He took on his name and believed himself to be human. He wouldn't do human things because he is still an AI. My guess as to why he never realized it was mainly due to the fact that this was his ""normal"" behavior. He never had to do certain things as a knowledgeable AI and it's just instinct to not do them. Alpha was probably so damaged in the mind he couldn't concieve anything other than him being Church, he blocked out all parts of himself while retaining AI instinct . Personally, I feel this matter can be taken multiple ways. One can say it's a plot hole another can prove an elaborate theory it's really up for interpretation. Just my two cents.   Yea I've decided Tex worked out that Alpha had been sent to Blood Gulch after the Mother of Invention crashed and went there to be with him. I'm just not too sure why she teamed up with Wyoming in Episode 100 though, had the war against the aliens/insurrection not finished? Maybe she realised that the Meta was coming and tried to escape as she knew what he was and that he was hunting for AI's?"
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,PiratedeSkull,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:03:11 2014 UTC,"I like the idea that Tex knew the Meta would be coming for the AIs in Blood Gulch. She knew about Maine taking Carolina's implants after the Mother of Invention crashed. She probably learned the Meta was coming back after she took Wyoming's helmet and looked at his logs (Wyoming fought Washington back on Relic in Recovery 1).  Then she took Omega (in her head) and Gamma (in Shelia), and left Blood Gulch at the end of Season 5 in order to lure the Meta away from Church/Alpha."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,mevans2401,2,Tue Nov 25 20:01:52 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, I really like that theory that she was leaving to try and protect the Alpha. Even though it would be sensible to prevent the Meta from finding Alpha its still kinda cute"
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,PiratedeSkull,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"And the reason Tex wouldn't tell Church/Alpha where she was going, was to keep him from following her."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,mevans2401,2,Thu Feb 26 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure she did, Carolina called Tex a shadow (to which she took offence, implying she knew) in Project Freelancer, which is set before season 1.   Plus when Church revealed himself as a ""ghost"" to her, she didn't flinch. She knew Church was an AI and that he didn't know that."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,TodtheT1000,2,Fri Feb 27 03:01:38 2015 UTC,It's possible she was implanted into an organic body somehow. One that was a clone or some coma patient or something.  *edit* or some kind of techno-organic body that was explained as an effect of Freelancer implants.
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,PrinceCheddar,3,Fri Nov 14 03:05:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah but wouldn't Church think ""Wow this Tucker guy sure talks about penis alot""  And realize he doesn't have one? Wouldn't Tex be curious what the basis behind alot of the crude humor spewed around her is?  I think it's just a good old fashioned plot hole. A forgivable one, but still a hole."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,PrinceCheddar,2,Thu Nov 13 18:04:59 2014 UTC,"By techno-organic, I mean something like an android. An artificial body that's designed to mimic one that's normal. Any inconsistencies between it and a proper human body could be explained by it being a side effect of the implants."
RedvsBlue,2m5p1l,mrhairybolo,1 point,Thu Nov 13 21:58:11 2014 UTC,I thought they started off in human bodies that the director like made or something.
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,1maduck,11,Thu Nov 13 01:15:59 2014 UTC,"Monty wasn't animating them, and they fit much better with this story than the way over-the-top Freelancer fights would have."
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,dcresistance,5,Thu Nov 13 01:19:32 2014 UTC,"Ahh, that would explain things. But still, I thought the fight between Carolina and Felix could have been better. Either way I hope to see minty back!"
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,Ahmrael,3,Thu Nov 13 01:31:52 2014 UTC,Ever since RWBY started Monty has had very little to do with RvB. He's too busy.
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,JacksonSX35,3,Thu Nov 13 02:58:32 2014 UTC,"I don't think Monty will ever return to RvB, unfortunately (can't guarantee this, but RWBY and all...). However, I would like to petition the sub to start calling him Minty. Though I actually doubt it would happen."
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,rasmysryan,1 point,Thu Nov 13 03:50:23 2014 UTC,"IIRC in one video, Burnie said that Monty is taking a break from RvB to focus on RWBY and that they would just have to wait and see if Monty comes back to RvB in the future. They're not sure."
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,rasmysryan,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:24:38 2014 UTC,"I know that season 11 had zero animation, and o believe that the animation for season 12 is done either by a small group led by a new guy with a different animation style, or just the new guy by himself. I don't remember where they introduced him, but his first work for them was animating the creeper and Master Chief Minecraft guys in the ""RT Animated Recap"". But the basic answer to your question is that it's done by fewer people who have a animation style that is different from Monty's"
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,Forikorder,3,Fri Dec 12 01:22:04 2014 UTC,compared to carolina VS felix i feel that Carolina and Wash tag team was much better so seems like whoever did animate them did better
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,dcresistance,2,Thu Nov 13 04:36:25 2014 UTC,"Chris Dike did all the RvB animation, so it was probably him getting used to it, as evidenced by how much better the later fights are."
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,cr4zym4ax10,2,Thu Nov 13 12:49:40 2014 UTC,"Also quick question, does monty animate RWBY aswell? It has a similar feel to it"
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,graywolfe42,6,Thu Nov 13 01:33:12 2014 UTC,He created RWBY. Pretty sure the reason he's not doing the rvb fight scenes is because RWBY keeps him too busy.
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,KrimsonM,2,Thu Nov 13 01:56:08 2014 UTC,"Something needs to be said about his talent, definitely one of the best animators I've ever has the pleasure to watch"
RedvsBlue,2m4v01,BlueBishop,2,Thu Nov 13 01:58:29 2014 UTC,Even his pre-Rooster Teeth stuff was great. People have been clamoring for another Dead Fantasy for awhile now(and I can't say I blame them). And Haloid was also pretty great.

RedvsBlue,2m107w,TodtheT1000,6,Wed Nov 12 02:11:29 2014 UTC,"That's pretty much my argument for why I don't want Maine/the Meta to come back. Both him and Tex had a proper end, I believe.
