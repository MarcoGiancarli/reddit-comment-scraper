I go through and drag all the dwellers that hit 10 into storage rooms and respective Male/Female barracks. Then I drop them back into rooms that they need training in. I'm usually left with a few stragglers, but I'm still able to shift things around and maintain efficiency. The end goal is to send 50 maxed out dwellers into the wasteland at the same time armed to the teeth. Jesus christ I need a fucking job.  And Three God is great, but how about Ten Dog?"

foshelter,3e20fs,deadbeef4,6,Tue Jul 21 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"Negative time bug =\ The point is, the more you are in the wasteland, the more chance to find rare and legendary items. For example, if you have 100 hrs chance to find legend is about 20%. But you have -05 seconds, so game thinks you spent unlimited time in wasteland, so chance to find legendary is 100%.  P.S. Oh, and funny thing is, this armour not that good for exploing at all =) The best for exploring is luck outfits. You need 10 luck + outfit luck, then you'll find cool items even without this bug! I fould rusty plasma rifle in less them 8 hrs with 13 luck!"
foshelter,3e20fs,ScienceDiscoverer,8,Tue Jul 21 12:54:43 2015 UTC,How much proof of the luck thing do you have other than the one example?  Every guy I've sent out has 10 luck and the rate of return on Legendaries seems to be about 10-15%.  You certainly aren't guaranteed any legendary in 8 hours because of better luck.  Almost all of the ones I've found have popped up at the 60 hour mark.  The only thing one can be certain of is that Luck is good for more caps.  The amount of caps you find ramps up linearly depending on how much luck you have.

foshelter,3e2pfn,theurbanwaffle,9,Tue Jul 21 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Here’s a write-up I made on the subject. Some ideas still need testing, but this is what we've seen so far.   Level – Higher Level => More Health  Strength – Increased damage for all weapons and success in defeating strong enemies  Perception – Increased success rate when picking locks to acquire loot. Testing Increased Energy Weapon damage (Alien Blaster, Laser Rifle etc.)  Endurance – Decreased radiation accumulation rate and damage from enemies. Endurance of 10 or more means no radiation damage. Testing Increased damage with Big Guns (Flamers, Miniguns, MIRVs etc.)  Charisma – Increased success rate handling diplomacy events  Intelligence – Increased success rate of healing wounded explorers  Agility – Increase success rate of sneaking past Raider Camps. Testing Increased damage with small guns (pistols, rifles, shotguns etc.)  Luck – Increased amount of Caps accumulation per Caps drop. No examined effect on loot drop rate or quality   Here's some more information on the Wasteland if you're interested."

foshelter,3e3yit,havek23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:41 2015 UTC,"There seems to be some type of prerequisite that a dweller must be unassigned before it can satisfy the requirement of correct assignment. And while new dwellers always start out unassigned, the question is, can this status be reset? Simply moving them to some other/incorrect room certainly doesn't do it.  Sometimes I feel like a dweller returning from the wastes is unassigned, but it may simply be that he was never assigned correctly before exploring.  You can always finish the quest using new dwellers, but that's pretty difficult once you're under population control."
foshelter,3e3yit,redscull,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"New dwellers from the radio room are easiest - put them in the production room or training room that fits their highest stat.   For other dwellers, I'll move them, eventually, when they get their stat maxed, to the appropriate room (or from the Game Room, to the appropriate production room). This will usually work. I think I finished a smaller one of these goals that way - from maxed luck back to the appropriate resource room.

foshelter,3e1szz,Foaddict,7,Tue Jul 21 08:24:03 2015 UTC,"The best way I've found is to sell when they come in. Before you hit 'Collect' when a dweller is at the door, you can hit an item once to mark it to be sold. It turns into a cap symbol and will be converted to caps when the dweller comes into the vault.  With this method you can sort through 50+ items in 30 seconds or so while also being able to find out what they picked up.  For objectives this WILL count as weapons/outfits sold but WILL NOT count as weapons/outfits collected."
foshelter,3e1szz,Jamistheman,2,Tue Jul 21 09:55:31 2015 UTC,"Once you have high volumes of explorers in the waste, this is a less efficient way of doing it compared to the OP. Once you have 50+ explorers, doing anything in the wastes view is not nice, including scrolling loot.   Considering the abundance of caps at this point in the game (my 100 pop vault produces a million every 5 days). Using the OPs method is currently the best, whilst adding/subtracting extra storage as you wish.   The game still needs a ""sell all normal"" button or perhaps something more granular where a checklist of weapons/outfits for your auto-sell button can be calibrated."

foshelter,3e425m,havek23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:19 2015 UTC,The late game goals are fairly rough; they don't make getting those LB's easy that's for sure!!! Maybe they are sticking it to us for the lunchbox exploit that some people did.
foshelter,3e425m,DrD0ak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"Sending dwellers into the wastes is easy and fast since you can recall them almost immediately. The only challenge is remembering what rooms you had them in (and that's really only a challenge if they were training; their outfit likely suggests their workplace).  You can dance without making babies if you break them up (send one to another room) quickly enough after the dancing starts. It can be tedious, though, for sure. And hectic when a fire starts and zooms you to the other end of your vault right when they start grooving. I made the same couple dance 27 times for a lunchbox that yielded a crappy 500 caps. :(  I think anything that require birthing babies should yield a lunchbox. It's not exactly hard to get a bunch of pregnancies, but the ramifications of unwanted children is a pain.. certainly not worth mere caps.  My favorite is the wasteland exploration time because that actually feels like a challenge. I have to train up and equip a dweller such that he can survive. I wish there were more skill based challenges instead of just tallying up things I'd do regardless. Like going undefeated for X monsters, or collecting X caps on one dweller, or X consecutive rushes without a failure, or 0 pregnancies in X days (pointless late-game), or breed a X hair color Y skin color baby, or survive X hours in wastes starting with no gear, weapon, or stims."

foshelter,3e2ra0,Thisbymaster,0,Tue Jul 21 18:25:45 2015 UTC,So yes it does. The timer is affected by the C of each person but luck determines if a person comes at all.  But the radio station is more important as a happiness booster which is all C.

I'll make an imgur link later.   As for method? Wasteland Explorers. Now, I will say I did skip time using the device settings, but other than that it was legit.   I had a team of 4 souped up wasteland dwellers with max SPECIAL, 7+ stats gear (power armour for example) and very high damage weapons (Fat Men and Vengeances with 20+ damage). These guys can survive between 3+/5+ days depending on gear (the one with most endurance seems to last the longest by far). A new explorer manage to break the 7 day limit(!). But these Wasteland Explorers will bring in around 12-15,000 in caps each (already factoring in revives) and so you can quickly rack up a LOT of caps.   EDIT - Here is me pushing past the cap (http://imgur.com/CSdUFmW). Now, there have been other users saying that they have graphical glitches that display Caps as over 1 million, but what you see here was my Cap stores after opening 10 lunch boxes and receiving numerous cap rewards (like you always get), so there is reason to believe you can go over 999,999 without it being a display error"

While they are outside they don't drain resources and don't take up space so you are free to scale back production rooms and delete everything you want to move. Then slowly collect your outside dwellers as you rebuild the production rooms and you are all set."

foshelter,3dzipi,davvblack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:05 2015 UTC,Why is 160 important?  Is that the limit to how many you can send questing?
foshelter,3dzipi,ramsrgood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:48 2015 UTC,you can't move around your living quarters of you have more than that. you can't destroy the rooms because it would put you over capacity. I think that's the only kind of room where the 160 cap matters.
foshelter,3dzipi,shiftplusone,4,Tue Jul 21 07:08:29 2015 UTC,"I've re-designed all 3 of my vaults and the biggest hassle are the Living Quarters... Many a sacrifice was made at the alter of the vault door to reduce my number of Dwellers.    It's helpful to build one side down while redesigning. That way you can make changes and adjustments. Once you have one side of your vault the way you want it, build the other side from the top down to the bottom.    Don't discount the Radio Room. Happiness is tied to the length of time it takes to train Dwellers and production. Having multiple Radio Rooms with high Charisma Dwellers gives your vault a significant boost to Happiness.    To maximize caps from production, invest in Game rooms. Level of the Luck stats of each of your Dwellers. Between Happiness and Luck, you can raise a large stash of caps relatively quickly. Caps are important when you start moving your Living Quarters around.    Build enough rooms to keep everyone working and producing caps."
foshelter,3dzipi,gentrfam,3,Mon Jul 20 22:37:16 2015 UTC,Yeh I e noticed that Luck works well with every stat so gonna prioritise Games Rooms amongst other things. I might try to just build the bulk of my new design down the ways and then start replacing old rooms instead of building further.
foshelter,3dzipi,yakatuus,4,Tue Jul 21 01:12:06 2015 UTC,"If you design with elevators between the rooms (i.e. 3-e-3-e-2, or 3-e-2-e-3) then you can destroy the middle room later without first destroying an outer room.   I'd recommend making the bottom right corner (2 levels) either storage or barracks. The pop-ups congratulating you on advancing on a goal show up there, making it difficult to clear or rush those rooms."
foshelter,3dzipi,voideng,3,Mon Jul 20 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"First thing to do is tunnel down.  My bottom levels are storage rooms and living quarters, separated to prevent roach/fire spreading.  Then I started at the top and worked my way down with what I wanted.  Three wide Nuka Cola, two wide power.  Nuka Cola, Nuka cola, power.  Basically anything with a short timer is at the top so I can click through them all fast.  Then training rooms.  Near the bottom my Radio Station so I don't click it."
foshelter,3dzipi,voideng,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"Although there is a strong preference for 3-2-3, I have found that 3-3-2 is better for some design considerations.  Isolating living and storage with a fire break is essential to a late game vault, but does require you to clear the field and dig down.  All of my production levels use the 3-3 section for production and the remaining 2 for a training room. I have some dedicated training areas for luck and whatever else I might need. Just be sure to not have two Athletics rooms top to bottom, there is an annoying bug that comes up when you do it."
foshelter,3dzipi,TunderProsum,2,Mon Jul 20 23:03:36 2015 UTC,I've accepted I'm gonna stick with 3-3-2 and tbh I don't really think it matters that much apart from aesthetic.

It's not too hard to ensure everyone has one of those so anything lower is junk I sell without a second thought. But those I try to keep some supply of for new dwellers.   For the record, explorers consider that shotgun better than the pistol due to higher max potential.  Better weapons than that are definitely going to take a lot longer to stockpile. Explorers get dibs, of course. And I sometimes dictate how many explorers I'll send out based on how many rare weapons I have."

foshelter,3dy7qj,havek23,5,Mon Jul 20 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"I believe that one elevator spans one half one third the width of a standard room.  So, technically, each floor (below the vault door ofc) has enough space for three maximum-size eight individual rooms side-by-side, with an additional space two thirds the size of a normal room.  Since you need at least one elevator to get to any floor, you're guaranteed to have another ""half-room"" of space, and because elevators are the only rooms which can fit in those spaces you're basically going to have either two elevators on every floor, or one elevator and an empty, useless space.  Edited to reflect /u/CrossedZebra's corrections"
foshelter,3dy7qj,partisparti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"Close. But each elevator is actually a third the size of a standard room. So the number of max rooms remains the same, ie you can only have a maximum of 8 rooms in whatever configuration, below the top floor. It is physically impossible to fit in 3 full sized facilities or 9 rooms. You'll be short by 1/3 of room space even without any elevators."

foshelter,3dy7qj,CrossedZebra,3,Tue Jul 21 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"Two elevators per floor is a perfect fit. But any more shafts you from potential rooms.  That said, the mountain is really big. There is more total space to build than you'll ever need if you keep everything maximally compacted and efficient. So feel free to have some fun with your design if you want.  And for the record, single cell rooms equal three elevator shafts in width. Every floor but the top is 26 shafts wide, enough for 2 elevators, 2x three-cell rooms, and 1x two-cell room (or any other combo of eight cells)."

foshelter,3dwk1f,user0verkiller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:49 2015 UTC,What does strength do for you in the wastes? My assumption would be that it causes the wearer to do more damage.

foshelter,3dwk1f,partisparti,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"Strength definitely augments weapon damage so a higher S explorer can get by with a lesser weapon. Which is great when you have not found the best weapons yet. It's my understanding from other posters that once you train a dweller to 10 strength and equip a top-tier weapon, it's enough to kill the hardest monsters making additional +S over 10 unnecessary.  P is widely speculated as necessary for loot rolls, especially on most of the static-time events in the wasteland, like the national guard depot. So it's good for helping you find more rares and legendaries. I haven't seen compelling evidence that it aids combat encounters, but maybe it does."

foshelter,3dxwrh,MrLegilimens,4,Mon Jul 20 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what Bethesda does or does not do for FOShelter, has no impact on FO4. A lack of focus or effort to improve or fix FOShelter is a business decision, not reflective of capabilities. Besides, iOS games and Console games are so different, that even if they were incapable of fixing minor bugs on iOS, doesn't mean they are equally unskilled on Consoles.  This was their first stab at a mobile game, so considering that, the games turned out quite well. As for device issues and other bugs, I personally hope they fix it, and even invest to expand the game a little. But if they dont, it just means they are most likely diverting resources internally to FO4. Either way gamers win! =)  Also, I have played my vault since launch on an iphone 6 with only a hand full of crashes. I ignore them and keep playing without issue.  Some tips might help if you aren't doing them already:   Maybe try shutting down all other apps while you play?  Play with a lower brightness to your screen? Play with the sound off. Turn off Bluetooth Turn off Background app refresh for any non-essential apps.   These little things could open up processing power on your phone."

foshelter,3dvtzw,missdilettante,4,Sun Jul 19 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"Your water level probably dropped below critical for a while which will irradiate your whole population. Even worse if your food was below critical as well. Your dwellers will recover if you restore water/food and maintain it above critical, but a few might need boosting with stims/rads - ie defenders etc.   If you're frequently dropping below critical levels, you're expanding too fast for your pop. You need more resource rooms fully staffed with high stat dwellers before you can expand. Big birthing booms are a usual cause for this."
foshelter,3dvtzw,CrossedZebra,3,Sun Jul 19 23:49:02 2015 UTC,Are you sure you just dont have enough water?
foshelter,3dvtzw,bligx,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:56 2015 UTC,Hm... It was probably below the bar before I rushed the room a few times. Would that be all it takes to cure everyone or would they still need the radaway?
foshelter,3dvtzw,bligx,3,Sun Jul 19 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can just wait. Giving them radaway only makes them happy faster."
foshelter,3dvtzw,havek23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, radiation can't spread... even mother/fathers can be irradiated when making a baby and the partner and child are alright.  Radiation is strictly just lowering the max health of someone and is only caused while out in the wasteland (based on endurance) and if you don't have enough water."
foshelter,3dvtzw,hoticehunter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"Radiation isn't a disease that infects people, it's based on exploring and not having clean water."
foshelter,3dtsdr,Elevas,6,Sun Jul 19 11:37:26 2015 UTC,"Anything over 10 E will make them immune to radiation. Beyond that, it isn't certain. Luck over 10 will increase the caps, but otherwise we're speculating."
foshelter,3dtsdr,rein00,3,Sun Jul 19 11:45:38 2015 UTC,"Ok... So, maybe if I can find something with a significant boost to other stats with at least 1 in E, that'd be beneficial to +4 E and +1 (anything)."
foshelter,3dtsdr,rein00,4,Sun Jul 19 12:07:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a fan of the rares with +2 E, +2 X, +1 Y. Soldier uniform or Wrestler Outfit are good examples. I'm not certain if 14 E makes a huge difference compared to 11 or 12 E, so I usually try to spread out the >10 stats in the hopes it breaks something else in my favor like with E."
foshelter,3dtsdr,PhoecesBrown,2,Sun Jul 19 15:42:47 2015 UTC,Yeah. Perhaps even the merc outfits would be a good value here. Only need to be over 10 E by 1.
foshelter,3dtsdr,MrBleah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:09 2015 UTC,I've seen some explorers take negative radiation damage at high E levels. Should theoretically reduce enemy damage. I'd wager it's worth having as much E as possible
foshelter,3dtsdr,redscull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter beyond 11 IMO except you might get additional health, but it's tough to say whether that is the case.  You take basically 0 rad damage at 11 and then it shows negative beyond 11, but you don't seem to gain health via the negative rad damage otherwise dwellers that left with extra high endurance would survive a lot longer and that doesn't seem to be the case from what I have seen.  If anything extra perception seems to get them farther from my testing."
foshelter,3dtsdr,HobKing,4,Mon Jul 20 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like +S is important, maybe even critical depending on your gun. I know I can send a high Strength explorer out with a weaker weapon, and he'll perform similar to a better weapon'd explorer with less strength. But I don't know what gun+S combo is needed for the biggest monsters. Maybe 10S is plenty with the best guns.  I constantly see claims that Perception is needed for the fixed event rare/legendary loot. And if that's true, it's almost assuredly the case that more is better. I feel like this theory is well supported by the +5P +1S +1E power armor. Just enough E for rad immunity, probably just enough S to kill all monsters assuming a top-tier weapon, and rest in P for loot rolls.  I don't feel like more than 10C is ever that important. Luck is harder to say. More L is always more caps (17 is awesome profit), but eventually caps become less important, and then +L becomes debatable.  I don't ever bother with E over 11 any more. I've felt no meaningful difference from having more. +A and +I are unknown. I'm sure they matter, but more than S or P? Likely not. Again, I feel like the S and P focused power armors support this."
foshelter,3dtsdr,redscull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:33 2015 UTC,Do we know yet what C does in the wasteland? Perhaps improve odds of better outcomes of interactions with other people?
foshelter,3dtsdr,-Loopdan-,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:46 2015 UTC,"There is at least one encounter that is a charisma check to ""beat"" it. I don't think that charisma-based encounters are as plentiful as others, thus +C isn't as important as others.  And to be clear, nothing wrong with training up charisma to 10. That's probably prudent since we don't know everything. But when it comes to which 1-3 stats you'll boost higher than 10 using gear, +C isn't going to be in that top 3 based on anything I've ever seen or read about."
foshelter,3dtsdr,iczyg,4,Sun Jul 19 22:58:34 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with +S or +E outfits if you have an elite dweller with a good weapon.   Yes, they will take rad damage, but at 10E it barely registers.  An all 10 SPECIAL lvl50 with a MIRV or Fatman can take out the Super Mutant Behemoths that become regular opposition after three days out. I don't think the extra +S is necessary.  Go for +L for caps (proven), or +P for rare items (speculating)."
foshelter,3dtsdr,TheCiotti,2,Sun Jul 19 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"I have neither of those weapons, alas. Just a laser Gatling gun (22-25)."
foshelter,3dtsdr,k0te21,4,Mon Jul 20 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see why people use E outfits for exploration.  You can't glitch more stims anymore, so 0 to 1 radaways will last an explorer at 10 E their entire stay in the wasteland.  I'd rather use a +7 L or +7 P (the latter which I haven't had proof works to increase rare drop chance, though...), or I just use an outfit that fits the dweller's persona.  17 L basically gives ~45% more caps than a 10 L."

I like to imagine they're in groups by sending 3 or 4 dwellers out at the same time.

Edit: Oh btw, you should NEVER have unmanned room in your vault, it costs you a lot of power and they all have a chance of getting an accident happening in them so yeah."
foshelter,3dtowf,Da_Piano_Smasher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:02:25 2015 UTC,"Rushing with high luck reduces the risk of failure and by extension the caps gained.

I dropped 80k on this today, though... So, even then, it might be months before I can afford this.

So in short, yes you can destroy the middle room just by itself. It's not really an issue in a 3/2/3 setup as you follow the path of first original elevator, so there is no chance of disconnecting if you destroy the middle room - as you have two elevator paths going from the top, all the way straight down on each side.  In a 2/3/3 setup for example, if you only had two floors. You would be building from the right to the left and offsetting the 2nd floor elevator further left of the first floor elevator. You can't destroy the middle room then, as it would cut off access to the left side elevator. However, once you build floors further down and rooms all the way across, you can then destroy the middle room on the second floor, as dwellers will be able to use the rooms below to get across to the right side and up to the top.  Hope that was clear-ish. XD"

Build the second floor all the way across 3/2/3 - now you can delete either the top middle room, or 2nd floor middle room by itself, but not both. Build a third 3/2/3 floor below, and now you can delete both 1 and 2nd floor middle rooms."
foshelter,3dtx09,PhoecesBrown,2,Sun Jul 19 13:40:45 2015 UTC,I don't think /u/dportela understood the question.  You can destroy the middle room without unless it's the first floor and you haven't connected the second floor. No issue here.

foshelter,3drsfj,ols17697,4,Sat Jul 18 22:09:47 2015 UTC,Is there a better method for unlocking legendary dwellers than getting lunch boxes and praying?
foshelter,3drsfj,dirtyLizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:43 2015 UTC,"This seemed like a much more feasible goal before lunch boxes were nerfed. Now, with 200 dwellers, every daily quest is hugely demanding (last one was 'put out 26 vault fires') and lunch boxes rarely hold anything uncommon. Not sure how long I'll have to play to collect all the unique dwellers, but a year sounds plausible."
foshelter,3drsfj,Vanbone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"This is the first I've heard of a lunch box nerf.  Do you mean that drop rates in the lunch boxes were nerfed, or are you just referring to the glitch that was patched out?  Wouldn't really be surprised if the former were true, though.  I started a new vault a few days ago, and like with my first vault I just bought 15 boxes at the start and that was it.  First time through I got two legendary dwellers and a handful of rare dwellers/weapons as well as a legendary weapon I believe.  This time...I didn't count the exact number, but I'm pretty sure 11 of the 15 boxes I opened just gave me resources, BB guns, Rad-Aways and the infinitely useful and totally-not-at-all-disappointing 500 credits.  I was pretty bummed."
foshelter,3drsfj,partisparti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't find the thread but a few of us were talked about how lunchboxes seem a lot worse since the last update. This has definitely been my experience. Maybe I've just had back luck, but I think I've earned something like 8 lunchboxes since the last update, and none of them have had special dwellers or rare weapons. What I HAVE been seeing a ton of, and what I virtually never used to get, was the 500caps as the final card. Which sucks, because I have plenty of caps, and when that happens, it generally means that I didn't get anything of value from that box.   Hoping maybe it's bad luck. But 500 caps, a common outfit, and 50 electricity are not worth starting 36 vault fires or pumping out 22 babies for."
foshelter,3drsfj,Vanbone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Something that has really bugged me all along is that I really think there should be some more kind of internal logic implemented for boxes so that you won't get resource cards if you're already full on that resource (or alternatively, if you're above the green line for that resource).  Between those and the Stimpaks/Radaways (which can be easily generated in 4x that quantity by rushing the respective facilities) there seem to be a whole lot of cards that are basically worthless.    That wouldn't matter to me in the least if legendaries/rares were more common, but as it is is currently, it's really frustrating to pull three of those underwhelming cards only to top it off with an equally underwhelming rare.  More so when it happens several times in a row."

foshelter,3drsfj,Bologna_Ponie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:31:09 2015 UTC,Upgrade to nuclear reactors. A lot more capacity. And make sure your power rooms are only two wide because they produce more power per minute than 3 wide

foshelter,3dnffw,redscull,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:14 2015 UTC,It would be an awesome idea!
foshelter,3dnffw,dany4president,2,Fri Jul 17 18:28:46 2015 UTC,Alternatively it would be nice if inventory items would 'upgrade' when over the 100 item cap. Replace that BB gun with a higher quality weapon. If someone were hunting for a lower quality item to complete their collection could simply return adventuring dwellers back home early.
foshelter,3dnffw,decrementsf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"This is the best solution. As vault overseer, you have no way to communicate with the person in the wasteland (if you want get immersive about it) so giving them instructions on what to drop or keep is not possible."

I was under the impression that the ""live narrative"" that I was reading on the explorer's pip boy was a feed coming back to the vault.   Maybe it's one way, but for some reason I assumed that it was 2 - thus allowing me to recall them using the recall button.   I agree that I'd rather that they take the initiative to drop the .32 pistols and BB guns then come back with a dozen of them."
foshelter,3dnffw,Hogs-o-War,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Much like your dweller will equip the best gear they find (assuming it's better than their starter gear, of course), it makes total sense that they drop the BB gun to bring back the Miss Launcher, etc."

foshelter,3dohhy,redscull,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:00 2015 UTC,This isn't actually showing us the wasteland as it would eventually be. This game is actually the training simulator that overseers used while Vault-Tec built shelters.
foshelter,3dohhy,horseradish1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"Realistically probably around the same time setting as the games. But the good thing about is that you can use your own imagination for the setting.  Time doesn't really function normally anyway in the game, 3 hours to give birth, 3 hours to grow up etc. It's just mechanics of the game, everything else can be left up to the imagination.  Perhaps the Vault was populated in 2077, and in game time was compressed until you put your first room down, so that it's decades later and mutants and raiders etc have all flourished.  Perhaps it's 2100 and you're an overseer from a previous vault that got destroyed and you survived and somehow came across an abandoned vault and took on the role of building it back up.  Probabilities are endless!"
foshelter,3dmbg6,TunderProsum,6,Fri Jul 17 12:52:02 2015 UTC,Do dwellers in the wastelands still contribute the same amount of resource drains as they do when they are in the vault?
foshelter,3dmbg6,midasisking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:30 2015 UTC,As far as I'm aware they don't drain any resources.
foshelter,3dmbg6,HalfFallenAngel,2,Fri Jul 17 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"That is interesting. I thought that they did so there wasnt a huge advantage to sending alot out once you have a decent set of weapons and supplies. I currently have 74 and I have all of my training rooms full so once my army is ready, they will be set free."
foshelter,3dmbg6,midasisking,4,Fri Jul 17 14:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'm at 125 and I have already started sending the random dwellers I get from the Radio straight to the Wasteland with nothing but 5 stims and their vault suit.   Either they find enough caps or loot to make them worth the revive, or they don't.  It's interesting though because this method has actually earned me a fair amount of legendaries for some reason."
foshelter,3dmbg6,dsebulsk,2,Fri Jul 17 17:24:46 2015 UTC,New vaults have felt like they get a few legendaries pretty quick. I wonder if this could be a bonus intended to give new vaults a boost with a couple legendaries to help get started. If that's the case the bonus should probably stop working after population size grows beyond a couple dozen.
foshelter,3dmbg6,decrementsf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:34:59 2015 UTC,I haven't noticed a different in the rate depending on the age of the vault. My first vault gets just as many as the others. Though my third is lunchbox glitched so I think it might get less. It's possible it takes into account the amount of legendaries you already have.
foshelter,3dmbg6,dsebulsk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:47 2015 UTC,"It's possible it takes into account the amount of legendaries you already have.   Would be interesting if so and may be the case. Since discussing 3 days ago I have been sending out level 1's to die. No legendary discoveries to report from them.   I do already have a fair number of legendaries owned, and have found a few in that time from explorers hitting 60 hours out in the wild.   Would be interesting to test whether coding similar to what is use in Diablo 3 to promote legendary finds is in place. Something where if its been a long period of time since the last legendary found, the probability of finding a legendary goes up until the next success.  Edit: May have spoke too soon. Just had a sacrifice find a survival suit and flamer before death. Worth ramping up the radio room staff and further testing."

foshelter,3dmbg6,faikwansuen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"The game is just a power hog because of all the effects and excel spreadsheets it effectively must keep track of. It sucks the battery out of my 6 + kind of fast, I have to watch it even if I disable other things to save power."
foshelter,3dmbg6,MSG1000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:50:48 2015 UTC,"To avoid this, I play until I've accomplished immediate goals and my resources are topped up, then I quit out of the app entirely until I'm ready to play some more."
foshelter,3dmbg6,sarasmirks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"OK, I think the problem is having so many in the wastes honestly. I used to have terrible problems with anywhere from 150 to 200 dwellers. Even if I only had a couple in the wasteland the dweller would be slow to load and the game would often crash afterwards. After the update the list loads fine and haven't suffered pop crash related issues since on my iPhone 6 +!  So now comes my question, with only 20 dwellers in the vault is it safe to assume that you don't have science labs or med bays? Or at the very least only a few?   The most efficient thing previously was to have a dweller survive for 60 hours so they can get the National Guard Depot event which gives a high chance of a legendary. While this event happens every 60 hours and chances of rare items increases every hour, previously a bug would cause dwellers not to pick up anything past 100 items/hours or something so the conventional wisdom was to bring them back after 60 so they can try again.  In order to survive 60 hours the dwellers will at least need some stimpacks and maybe a few radaways.  I can't see your vault sustaining that with the numbers you stated. Even if you have lots of hospitals and Science labs for storage you won't have dwellers running them meaning the production of Stimpacks and radaways is very slow and would put a big drain on your power stations.  Not saying that the game couldn't use more optimization but your method is a little extreme.  Are you having success with this method? How many hours do your dwellers last? There's nothing wrong with going against conventional wisdom if you have a working method, just saying you may have troubles because the game now loads a long list of just working dwellers fine but 80 dwellers worth of loot is quite a lot of memory when you add everything up."
foshelter,3dmbg6,MSG1000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"The new updates seem to have sorted this out. I was getting the same slow downs on my 5s, but now with 200 dwellers is nippppppy as owt"
foshelter,3dmbg6,kelvinmead,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"I've updated the post with some extra details to answer your questions :) I'd probably be bringing them back after 60 hours too, but flicking through the waste view often enough to do that is pretty painful right now. I just pass through a couple times a day, reviving the dead and bringing them home.   Everyone one of my 80 wastelanders has full special at level 50, so they don't need rad-away to make it to 60 hours. They all go out with 25 stims however.   Stims are produced by just 3 triple med bays staffed with 2 dwellers wearing +5 int and max stats (so one room is always empty). Whenever I log on I can collect 24 from their finished rooms then insta rush all three rooms twice with 0% chance to fail. That's 90 stims in a few seconds. If I happen to have had a lot of wastelanders come back and needing to be resent, I can rush a little further.  Making it to 60 hours however, is a lot easier at end game. All the dwellers have rare weapons by now and weapons damage seems to scale a lot in the waste. They'll all go past 100 hours easily.   I'm pretty well acquainted with the conventional wisdom, I wrote it :P Nothing has changed in the strategy, it's just how a vault changes as it approaches end game and everyone is fully trained."

It takes longer, but they don't consume resources whilst exploring and it's actually less hands on then the production room method if you need to get rid of a lot of people.

Would love to see a portion of that re-invested in more end-game activities, events for the waste, and new events for the vault.   As insane as Dwarf Fortress can get the learning curve puts off most people. I suspect there are some good ideas that can be poached from there that would work well for Fallout Shelter and haven't been seen by most players.    Unhappy dwellers snapping and going on a murderous rampage? Dig too deep and have a chance of the super radroach queen, big enough to fill a whole room, is unearthed? Could see it take over a room spawning smaller radroaches, and take multiple waves of dweller defenders to drive back out.  Explorer in the wasteland comes back a ghoul?  Explorer comes back too popular and the rest of the dwellers try to promote him to overseer in your place, leading to a battle for control over who goes where? (Playing off Fallout 1) Maybe some interesting drops when raiders come through.  Positive events from the radio room? Possibly traders instead of raiders come for a visit? Surgical or genetic augmentations for our dwellers, care of the Brotherhood of Steel? Discover other vaults locations while exploring the wastes, and send your own raiding party to loot it?"

Published 06/15/2015 11:10 AM   |    Updated 06/19/2015 01:29 PM  Fallout Shelter is for the iPhone 5 and up, the iPad 3 and up, and the iPad Mini 2 and up. It is optimized for the iPhone 6, 6+, and iPad Air 2. The game runs on iOS 7 and up.  Devices with 512 MB of RAM are not supported. This includes the iPhone 4s, iPod Touch Gen 5, iPad 2, iPad Mini Gen 1.   Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation), your iPad has 256 MB of RAM, and was discontinued on Mar 2, 2011.   That's a quarter of the processing storage for the devices it is optimized for.  Granted, buying a new device isn't always economically feasible, but we're talking about a game that came out about month ago on a device that stopped being supported over 4 years ago."
foshelter,3dji5e,DSimmon,2,Thu Jul 16 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"On top of that, I do own an iPad 1 and had basically converted that to an alarm clock as Spotify kept crashing on that thing. Even the 3rd party clock apps crash on that device all the time, the RAM is totally insufficient."
foshelter,3dji5e,happyfriend20,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:51:53 2015 UTC,Insufficient for current apps of course.  At the time it was enough.
foshelter,3dji5e,DSimmon,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"Bethesda are lying. They are REQUIRED as per their deal with Apple to even be allowed to publish it on the appstore, they MUST support iPhone 4 and up since they're publishing against iOS8. When iOS9 is released, they can set that as requirement to stop iPhone4, but that would still leave iPhone4S. So once iOS10 is released, THEN they can limit their support to not include those devices, but currently, they're technically in violation of their developer agreement.  As for the device stopped being supported 4 years ago. The first generation ipad only has iOS5 as the newest iOS, and FO requires iOS8, so that's obviously not what OP has, and probably means the iPad mini first gen, which was discontinued just a month ago, after FO was released. And does take iOS8 and hence, should be supported by bethesda in this case."
foshelter,3dji5e,EtherMan,2,Fri Jul 17 09:30:37 2015 UTC,"A. You appear to have a bit of anger in you.  B. If you look at the app store, in Compatibility it says:   Compatibility: Requires iOS 7.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. This app is optimized for iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.   If you look at the description, it says:   Fallout Shelter requires at least an iPhone 5, iPad 3, or iPad mini 2.   From what I see, when a developer builds an app and submits it to the store, Apple then reviews that app and approves it.  If it was breaking any type of ""deal with Apple"", then I assume Apple would say they need to fix that shit before they'll release it.   But then again, I'm aware of any ""deal"" Bethesda has with Apple.  C. You may be right, OP may be using an iPad mini 1 gen, but the key word ""mini"" was missing from their post, so taking it for what was posted until an update from OP, it is an old school original first gen iPad.  But even then, according to the Bethesda help document, and the game description in the App Store, a first gen iPad mini doesn't meet the specs.   Does it run?  Yes, I've heard it does.  Does it run great?  Not from what I've read around here."
foshelter,3dji5e,DSimmon,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"A. No anger no. Annoyance that two weeks worth of gameplay can be destroyed by an untimely crash of the game.  B. Right I was even under the impression that it was iOS8 but well, same thing. Same phones as iOS8 so.  And yes. As you can read, the requirements specifically says that the requirements are based on the OS. It is then OPTIMIZED for newer devices. But see, optimized and completely broken for all other devices, are two very different things. And yes, the description is what it is. And no, Apple does not actually review apps for stability issues or similar. They only verify that it starts, and it does. And the ""deal"" they have, is the developer license. Apple has numerous times pointed out that all devs are under the same license, regardless of the size of the dev.  C. He CANNOT be using a first gen iPad because that does not have iOS7 and thus cannot even install FO, let alone actually run it. And yes, according to description, a first gen iPad mini, is the same spot as iPhone 4 and 4S in that Bethesda wants to claim it's not supported. And it's not about it running great or not. The game actually does run great, ONCE IT'S LOADED."
foshelter,3dji5e,EtherMan,0,Fri Jul 17 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"A. But that has nothing to do with device support.  If it's an untimely crash, then having a proper backup to restore should fix it.  Either that, or if the developer set it up to back to the iCloud, or allow multiple device support, then it would work.  As it is, with the exception of purchasing lunch boxes, they made this game as a completely offline capable game.  That's a design decision the developers took, and it sucks, but it's what is.  B. But is it completely broken?  Based on your comment, it sounds like it worked fine for 2 weeks.  I'm guessing there was a memory threshold that was hit and exceeded what the device has available.  Now, according to Wikipedia the 4s was discontinued on Sept 9, 2014.  It has since been succeeded by the 5, the 5s and 5c, and the 6 and 6+.  While carriers may still carry it, and support it, it is now 4 generations old and 10 months out of date.  I understand, money doesn't grow on trees, and staying up with technology is not cheap, but I also can't play Crysis on my Windows XP laptop at home.  Should I complain to Microsoft for making the game unsupportive?  EA for publishing a game that doesn't support my laptop?  Or should I just pass on playing this game until I get a device that can support it?  C. I agree, a first gen iPad doesn't have the min OS requirement for the game.  But by stating it was a mini you are making an assumption on what OP meant, and not what he said.   My assumption would be that once the vault gets so large, when the game tries to load it into memory it can't address all the people, equipped weapons/armor, rooms, events, etc.  I've heard of people playing the game fine on iPad 2's when they zoom all the way out and it reverts to a 2D texture map, so rendering all the elements in 3D may have an element to what is causing the problems too.  But then again, I'm not a Bethesda developer, I don't have access to the source, and so I've made the above assumption.  But as I stated in B, a 1st gen iPad Mini is now 3 generations old.  According to it's wikipedia it was discontinued on June 19, 2015.  While that was less than a month ago, with two successors it is still what I would consider an aged/out dated device."
foshelter,3dji5e,DSimmon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"A. A backup that also removes any purchased items since the restore. Are you saying we should be backing up every 5 minutes just to make sure the game does not crash at an untimely place? And yes, the devs COULD make it back up to iCloud... But you know FO does not do that so why even bring that up? You know that there's none of that in FO. The only way to back it up is to back up the entire phone.  B. No. I can at will ""corrupt"" the save at any time. It's just a matter of getting someone pregnant, exit the game, and wait for the notification that she's given birth. Game is now unable to launch. So it's not related to resources being used up like that. The game is perfectly fluent even with those 150 dwellers. Had it been a problem of it being laggy all the time, that's ok. That really is about optimizations. But this extreme instability, is a coding problem, not resource issue. As for comparison to Crysis, you can play it on your XP laptop if you wanted to. You can install a newer OS on it and it'll install and run. It'll lag like hell, but you can play it and it won't be crashing on you every couple of min, nor will it make your saves impossible to load after doing so. Even then, both MS and EA support the game on low performance hardware. There's just not much they can do about your comp being slow. Support does not mean that they do whatever, it just means that they do what they're required to for the product to do what it promised... Also, your comparison is faulty since Crysis actually has a requirement for the hardware as well. The thing I'm pointing out about, is that the hardware said to be required, does not match up with what is supported. For the comparison to hold, it would be EA refusing to support Crysis on a comp that fullfills the requirements, but not the recommended specs.  C. Except you can consistently do it with 10 dwellers, or 150 dwellers. The game runs perfectly smooth either way, except trying to do that very animation right after loading. Unless you want to claim that that animation for some reason takes up the memory of more than 150 dwellers alone, and only right after loading, then that's simply not the issue. And if that is the issue, then there's a issue in the code with how it loads assets because there's just no valid reason for why an asset should take up that much more right after loading as compared to any other time. Also, that bug happens even on my iphone6, which is even ""supported"". And as I've stated before. What you consider to be dated and not, is irrelevant. We have contracts for a reason, and the contract says that bethesda must support it for those devices. It does not have to be optimal, but they must support it."

foshelter,3dji5e,EtherMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"And it apparently runs on those devices.  It just doesn't run well, and from what I've read usually after so many rooms or dwellers have started to occupy the vault.  This makes sense, as those are probably items that take up more RAM, and you start hitting the threshold of what the device has.  But until another version of iOS comes out, and support those devices don't get the upgrade, and the app can be updated to no longer support those versions, the if you choose to play the game on an older, potentially sketchy device, then that's on you.  The warnings are listed in the compatibility for optimizations, and in the description."
foshelter,3dji5e,DSimmon,0,Fri Jul 17 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"No. The bugs are not related to that. Even my old phone, a 4S has a vault that has 150 dwellers and it still runs just fine. The ONLY moment it has a problem, apart from it crashing from time to time which happens on the new devices as well, is that on a 4 and 4S, it does not like the transition from loading screen, to vault view. Any animations waiting such as those related to children, and it can no longer be loaded. So it's not about the capacity of the device, it's about the way the app is programmed to load the assets. As for older and sketchy devices, that YOU consider it to be old and sketchy does not make it so. The developer agreement is the same. If you make an app that targets iOS7+, you support all iOS7 devices of the type you specify, which in this case, includes iPhones. You can't sell something that does not work within what you've set as requirements, and refer to that it's not optimized for it when it doesn't. Would you accept that if you buy say a safety door to your house that says ""fits all doorframes of size 220-240x90-100"", and then when someone picks the lock, refer to that well it it was only optimized for 220x90 frames.

Next I'll redesign my vault so it's one full column of electricity and another of Nuka-Cola (food/water). The third can be all the other junk.  My hope is that this game will get a good addition when the android version comes out. Maybe more goals or objectives when you send people out to the wasteland? More vault drama... something.  Of course, this awesome tap game is probably just a mini hype-man for F4. Nonetheless, it was a fun ride."

foshelter,3dinos,mr_tran,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:29 2015 UTC,I've just been renaming my females with the last name of the male that impregnates them.  That way you don't have the awkward father /daughter barracks conversations because the kid will definitely have the right last name.
foshelter,3dinos,jetjordan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:11 2015 UTC,What about son and mom?
foshelter,3dinos,jetjordan,2,Thu Jul 16 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"uh, that should be obvious as well since they too will have the same last name with this method.  The game randomly picks (so far as I can tell) the last name for a kid from one of the two parents.  If you rename the mother to the same name as the father, then you won't try and breed either with their offspring."
foshelter,3dinos,DrD0ak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if you only use the last name, then it becomes hard to manage 2nd generation and onwards couple pairings.  For example,  Lucas Simms and Moira Brown pair up so you change Moira's last name to Simms as well.  They have a son, let's call him Brandon Simms.  Who hooks up with Wendy Baker.  Now you change Wendy's last name to also match Brandon's last name.  Brandon Simms and Wendy Simms now have a 2nd generation vault child, which they name John Simms.  John Simms goes on to partner with Kathy Rogers and you like wise change her name as well.  At this point, your vault will have the following Simms family,  Brandon Simms, Moira Simms, Wendy Simms, John Simms, Lucas Simms, and Kathy Simms.  A few days past in the vault and now you want to breed more Simms.  If you have a good memory you may be able to recall all the original pairings.  If not, then do you just randomly pair up Brandon Simms with Moira Simms, Wendy Simms, and Kathy Simms or pick a new female partner?  One is his mother, one will be his original partner, one will be an adulterous relationship with his sons partner, and the last one will be a case of alzheimer's.  Granted, the game won't let you pair up the son with his mother but that's not going to stop him from having an adulterous relation with his sons partner.  And as you reach closer to 200 dwellers with multi-generational children, it will be really difficult to keep up who's with who.  All that above could have been avoided by having their partner's take their spouses initials as a middle name.  Thus, Brandon W Simms hooks up with Wendy B Simms regardless of how many other Simms are in the vault.  If you also make sure to only use one alphabet for each first name, there will be no confusion.  I know it's only a game and a lot of people won't take this realism as far as I have but the above situation has happened for me and it annoys the heck out of me.  So much so that I will literally spend hours with paper and pen trying to figure out who is related to who before I can figure out who should be with who when all I really wanted to do was check-in, tap a few resources, and check-out."
foshelter,3dgzvo,InedibleFood,2,Thu Jul 16 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"Depends more on what your stats are on your dwellers.  My best vault so far is 81ish people, 4 nuka cola triples, and enough nuclear stations to have 7200 max energy.  I make around 200 food + water every 41 seconds, more than enough to sustain 200, hell even 300 dwellers.  I have wayyy too much power, but there's no real other use for the dwellers except to explore or generate power + stimpaks.

foshelter,3dfbcj,ensignfluke,6,Wed Jul 15 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"Because you don't have enough power rooms. Also, if your dwellers don't have high enough strength or you don't have enough dwellers in your power rooms, the rooms take longer to finish. So if your rooms aren't finishing fast enough, you're using more power than you are making.  Edit: It looks like two of your reactors aren't fully staffed. Take care of that first."

If you don't have enough high strength dwellers, you'll quickly find yourself short of power.  Get all your best strength dwellers out of training and into the rooms.

foshelter,3dfbcj,Thisbymaster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"The difference between a fully upgraded nuclear and a fully upgraded power station is only 10 units of power (59 to 49). If your power stations were refilling every minute while your nuclears took 3-6 minutes, it's better to go with power stations until you can get the nuclear time down to one to two minutes."
foshelter,3dfbcj,highasamf,2,Wed Jul 15 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"According to that fancy spreadsheet I'm too lazy to track down the link for, power and nuke stations have exact same production efficiency per man assigned.   The nuke stations hold more in reserve, but generate power at the exact same speed, so they feel like they take longer to fill.   That's because there's more to fill."

You may not have Miss Launcher or missile launcher variants, but if you level dweller SPECIALS up properly, and send them out somewhere between level ...i dont know...37? and 50 (free heals from level up), a dweller has a good chance of making it to 60 hours.  And even if they don't, revival is cheap and a high level dweller will get a good number of hours more from that.  I've even had explorers go out with mid-tier weapons (like flamethrower) and still make it with 1 or 2 stims to spare.  Managing 3 vaults, with at least 6 explorers out on each at any given time, I can say that I've never not hit 60+ hours on each with 25 stims.    If you're sending out low level, lower than optimal stat dwellers with shit tier weapons, and not making it to 60, it's not the game's fault.  Your dwellers obviously aren't expected to make it to 60 hours at that point."

foshelter,3dfsyb,Illini0639,9,Wed Jul 15 22:51:48 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/irMXqJv.png  Power based in the top section; not overly concerned with the double power rooms being more efficient than the triples.  It's easier to organize this way, and it makes sure the more critical rooms (food/water) are still powered in the event of low power. Also, I like the stacked look for power plants (it makes it seem like the shaft of the generator is all one continuation down the floors).  Food and Water grouped next, nothing special here; one level of each type of room.  Consumables in the next group; distribute as needed.  At max level endurance, explorers don't have much need for Rad-Aways.  The training section!  This is my favorite part of the layout.  SPECIAL training rooms on either side in descending order. The storage rooms in between are for temporary holding rooms when re-organizing your dwellers as they hit max stats for their current training room.  Living quarters are also a viable option here, but storage rooms prevent the need to be concerned about unplanned baby making while moving people around.  Also, the storage rooms  all skip a level so that in the event of a fire or infestation, the incident would spread sideways into an occupied room rather than continuing to spread through unoccupied storage.  Radio studios down towards the bottom and out of the way so you don't accidentally call in more dwellers if you're not ready.  And lastly, the barracks down in the deepest part of the vault protecting expectant mothers from pending raider attacks and the nuclear fallout from the wastelands."

foshelter,3dfsyb,k0te21,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"I... don't actually know.  Here is my very unscientific approximation for arriving at that total:   Currently my vault has 5x double power plants: 5 x 2 = 10 net power rooms My vault as 9 full levels of rooms that I am able to support with power: 9 levels x 8 rooms/level = 72 total rooms - 10 power rooms - 3 vault door & entry = 59 net rooms to be powered Each double power plant has 2/4 workers at 13 strength (10 + military fatigues) So at half staff, each power room in my current vault is supporting ~6 other rooms   My end game plan has 21 power rooms and 130 other rooms to be powered, 21 x 5.9 = 124 rooms.  I'm banking on full staffing of each power room and the increased output of the nuclear reactors to make up that 6 room difference.  Alternatively, there is vacancy on the 4th level that I could fill with more power that wouldn't really detract from the overall theme or I could hold off on building that 2nd set of training rooms.  If anyone has a more thoroughly accurate method of project power needs, I would be very interested in that feedback."
foshelter,3dfsyb,k0te21,2,Thu Jul 16 03:42:05 2015 UTC,It's more than enough with dwellers having 10-13+ str. 6-7 reactors of 2 cells each is enough for a complete vault with 200 dwellers. You will just need a bit more if you fill every section on the map for some reason.

foshelter,3dfsyb,RevRay,2,Thu Jul 16 05:40:59 2015 UTC,Looks pretty good... One quick observation on the storage rooms is why not put them with the barracks? Or at least on the side instead of the middle. Then your spillover from radroaches either won't bother anyone or will only bother a single training room instead of 2.
foshelter,3dfsyb,RevRay,2,Thu Jul 16 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"I wanted the storage rooms near the training room so that I could have an available empty room to throw dwellers that hit max level for their current training room and figure out where to redistribute them.

I do really like the idea of having them on the side though, rather than the middle, to minimize the spread. I hadn't thought about that one."

Also, I just wanted them buried fairly deep so that I don't unintentionally call in new dwellers as I mass harvest all my resource rooms.   As far as role playing, my favorite entrance is having a bar at the front door. All newcomers get a beer on the way in, returning explorers can stop and get a drink before returning to the waste, and raider bar fights.

I looked at log and found the glitch happened.  The vault is currently with 15 dwellers and struggling with medbay's power suction.  Maybe the glitch is caused by iOS time sync error.   I'm now repeating sending and returning, to see what happens.  ADD: Failed to reproduce the glitch. Well I had to go on with glitches, not taking a screenshot."

It seemed to happen when I sent out multiple dwellers to the wastes at the same time, but it does not occur consistently. Wasteland explorers find an item every hour, at a random time during each hour - and everyone in the wastes finds it at the same time.  This seems to be an error of the game giving the item before it recognized the dweller as having left the vault - the result is a negative time for finding the item and getting a Legendary.  Each time this happened, I had more than one dweller pick up a legendary."

After you complete that quest, the Sell One Weapon or Outfit quest will return to your quest list.

foshelter,3dd9l0,FlakCat,9,Wed Jul 15 10:49:20 2015 UTC,"Great tips!   The only thing I don't totally agree with:    Vault door guards are not entirely useless if the guards are adequately leveled and equipped. Raiders will just pass the door room when a certain amount of time is passed so the guards won't be dead.    The thing about the raiders is that, once they get through the vault door, they are constantly draining resources until they are killed.  For a long time, I kept two heavily equipped dwellers in the vault room for raiders but at least one always got through. Once I had a good stock of strong dwellers and equipment in reserve, I switched to six in the first triple room after the vault door. Now the raiders are killed in half the time as before, meaning far fewer resources being wasted during a raider attack.   Ultimately I think that, if you have dwellers to do it and a patch doesn't change the raiders behavior, leaving your vault room empty and putting your muscle in the first triple room after the door is far more effective."
foshelter,3dd9l0,anon_smithsonian,4,Wed Jul 15 13:52:25 2015 UTC,I just drag two high level dwellers to the door and put flamers on them.  None of the raiders make it past the entrance.
foshelter,3dd9l0,Nebling4,3,Wed Jul 15 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... what are their SPECIALs?   When I was doing the two-dwellers-in-the-vault-room technique, I had a very high-level dweller (40+) and a mid-level (mid 20's) in there, one with an enhanced gatling laser and the other with a plasma rifle (I think? ~17-18 dmg, I believe) but they still usually managed to take out one or two of the raiders before they moved on.  It might have been because I think I was still operating on the assumption that it was Strength that determined weapon damage--both of them had really high Strength--but I recently read on this sub that it's actually Endurance which determines weapon damage? Not sure, but if that is true, then that may have been a big reason why: the 2nd dweller--the mid-level one--had pretty low SPECIAL stats, apart from strength. I was still working on having enough vault dwellers freed up from production rooms so I could just be cycling them through training rooms to build up a strong group of wasteland explorers.   I might have to go back and give this a try with my particularly high END dwellers to see if I have better luck."
foshelter,3dd9l0,anon_smithsonian,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"I wait till my dwellers hit level 20 and then throw them into the training rooms.

foshelter,3dd9l0,Nebling4,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"I have 2 in the doorway with one plasma rifle (17-18) and one with a missile launcher (20-21). I can, basically, rotate any of my mid- to high-level dwellers into the room and people won't get past them. Right now, it's a 31 w/ 10-S, 5-L (3s and 2s in the other stats) and a 34 w/ 9-S, 10-C, 10-L (2-4 in other stats) respectively.   I'm now at the point where they send 4 raiders against my vault. I'll toss them a stimpak midway through the fight, but just for my peace-of-mind - they always survive.   Edit - I'll have them take the elevator up from the room below - I ended up with a 2-zone barracks next to the door that I now cannot move because I've capped my population. I don't like leaving them in the doorway, because I want them to be productive in between fights."
foshelter,3dd9l0,gentrfam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"I had that problem, so I culled a lot of my low SPECIAL dwellers by stripping them of gear and kicking them out to the wastelands to die. I eventually got my dweller count back down to about 140 or so, which dramatically cut down on crashes and glitches (iPad Air 2). I rename culled dwellers to Culled so I can easily differentiate then from legitimate explorers I want to revive. This will allow you to delete and move the residential rooms."
foshelter,3dd9l0,MadMageMC,2,Wed Jul 15 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind feedback. I think keeping the door guards is a matter of choice: 1) more firepower; or 2) less stolen resource. In the case of 1, an overseer may find her/his defense is not enough and is worried about allowing raiders inside the perimeter (the 3-node room which is an actual garrison). Then the overseer may seek more time-spending (so more resource consuming) but also safer solution.   Usually I don't use door guards; however, sometimes I see a level 1 death squad with +7 STR outfit and a decent weapon does his/their job well. I also don't care about water or food, because stolen amount of them is quite small. (150 each at most, I guess? The amount of storage of mine is 900.)"
foshelter,3dd9l0,anon_smithsonian,2,Wed Jul 15 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"I also don't care about water or food, because stolen amount of them is quite small. (150 each at most, I guess? The amount of storage of mine is 900.)   Yeah, I guess that the amount of resources stolen in either case was never enough to make or break--I usually have the bars pretty close to maxed--but it still annoyed me to see the larger dents they took out in my resource bars.   But it's also worth noting that rate of resource loss during a raider attack is based upon total storage capacity: the more resources you can hold, the more resources per second are lost. If your vault has significantly greater production and storage capacities than the minimum resource level lines, then the difference in having the raiders living an extra 3 or 4 seconds will be pretty minimal.  Still, I think the difference that this can make can be significant enough for some people and at certain points in the game and that it was at least worth pointing out or making a note of."
foshelter,3dd9l0,decrementsf,4,Wed Jul 15 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Sharing some additional thoughts on vault design from my experiences so far.  Dweller Count 50-99  Production Rooms  Lower Levels   Defending raiders by allowing them to run right into a power room. By the time raiders get through the front door having six high-strength workers ready to defend feels much smoother than two defenders at the front.  There's an argument to be made for a 'less-is-more' theory to production rooms. We can squeeze out more efficiency from 2-room power rooms but there is value in having less things to click on, and not having to scroll very far to get them all.  Upgraded to more productive rooms as they become available in order to further reduce number of things to click on, and focus more dwellers over to training or exploration.  Sticking auxiliary rooms over along the right hand side felt convenient. Rads/Meds quickly available to keep explorers in the field. Just kept adding more training rooms as needed. Shifting dwellers along the vertical stack was easy.  Air-gapped non-productive rooms in the lower levels to not have to defend them. If an emergency breaks out they all just burn until the event goes away on its own.    Dweller Count 100+  Production Rooms  Training Stack  Lower Levels   In the production rooms I read somewhere that 4 Nuka-Cola plants can support up to 200 dwellers. Assumed an equal number of power, plus a few extra to power the rest of the base, should be sufficient as I upgraded worker stats.  It's cheaper to maintain some of the lower tier production rooms, plus you can get bonus caps when harvesting power so an argument can be made that it's more profitable to do so as well. The downside is you have more dwellers tied up to staff them. Also, as the Luck of workers goes up it looks like getting extra caps on harvesting a room happens more often. Personally I like freeing up dwellers for training and clicking over one small area to harvest everything so keeping things condensed.  Expanded on training rooms. Set up a block of full SPECIAL so I can focus my attention on one area. Rotating dwellers through training rooms seems to be where I've spent a lot of my time in game. Right now I'm only using new dwellers from the wild to increase population. I bring them in in groups of 6 and rotate them through a training cycle up to a minimum of about 7 of each stat.  Dweller happiness will not change while in a training room. Rushing a dweller up to 100% in a production room before sending them off to training makes it easy to maintain 100% happiness in the vault. Apparently the highest that can display is 99% overall happiness.  Lower levels are still air-gapped. Emergencies down there can run wild without fear of damaging the rest of the vault.  Currently in the process of moving the second elevator all the way to the outside. It's a small change, but when sending dwellers from the auxiliary rooms to help in an emergency I wanted them to run right into the neighboring room rather than having to run through an elevator first. Plus, sometimes the pathing when taking elevators seemed less than efficient. Thought maybe that would improve if moving the second elevator further away from center."

foshelter,3dj0ba,CaptainAlaska,7,Thu Jul 16 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"You are aware that male characters cannot be soldiers, surgeons, or engineers right?  The gender specific outfits are kinda dumb from a design aspect, but it's a choice they made.  In practice, this argument to me is weak.  Nearly all of my best explorers are women because they get Soldier's Uniforms (and I have a lot of them).    I agree the gender specific outfits are stupid and annoying.  In their universe, there are more strictly defined gender roles than in ours.  Maybe they are implying that they are stupid and annoying.  The outfits are a pain in the ass for my male and female dwellers (by a 23 to 7 ratio, more of a pain for my females).  It's most likely just RNG, but it forced me to use females in a more egalitarian way.  All my gardeners were male ninjas while the females put Battle Armor on and headed for the waste.   My first five or so explorers were all male because the females were pregnant.  So I had to make it a priority to develop female explorers.  It enforced diversity in some areas and other times prioritizes females over males.    I agree that the gender based outfit system is stupid; perhaps that was part of their intent to illustrate.  The pregnancy bug pissed me off because it didn't allow me to use my female dwellers the way I needed to, as explorers.  Honestly, I think they put it in so you wouldn't have all male explorers and all females staying in the base; the most efficient designs will require a diverse gender allocation."
foshelter,3dj0ba,yakatuus,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"Mostly agreed, but about soldier, engineer and surgeon part, I feel like it's a decision from mitigating or mechanically balanced approach.

foshelter,3dj0ba,FlakCat,-7,Fri Jul 17 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughtful response, but I think the criticism stands.  I am glad to hear the game mechanics constructed a narrative in your game that could be interpreted  positively.  I still do not believe that is the default narrative created by these mechanics.   Assigning dwellers to the wastes results in 3 reward types: XP, Caps, and Gear  Loot is determined by 4 things.  Dweller Level, Luck, Perception, and Duration of time spent in the wastes.    The most significant loot drop comes at 60 hours.    Endurance, Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Luck all contribute to duration of survival in the waste.  The soldier uniform is not necessarily the best outfit for exploration.  The most important thing is getting dwellers to the 60 hour mark which can by done by maximizing a number of stats.    It makes sense that some of the female only outfits are pretty good.  They very well should be as there are so few of them.  If their limited options were not good the problem would be even worse than it is now.   As for personal experience, I only have one soldier uniform and 2 movie fan outfits.  The vast majority of my schwag is male only and it sucks.  MORE TO THE POINT, the outfits that specifically denote social status (Mayor, Nobility, Medieval Ruler, Cleric) are all male only.  This is a problem."
foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,13,Thu Jul 16 22:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go ahead and say it's because the 1950s were heavy on gender roles and nuclear families, and in a world where you control a vault that is separated from the new rules on the outside, the old rules continue on the inside.  I'm also gonna play the satire card because everything in the game is really silly thanks to dwellers stupidly grinning while gunning down raiders, people dying with dumb tongue-hanging-out faces, and every conversation in the vault being so out of touch to reality outside the vault like a closed community would."
foshelter,3dj0ba,FlakCat,0,Thu Jul 16 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"Soldiers, engineers and surgeons were mostly male in 1950s, I guess. The '1950s sexist satire' argument is not pretty accurate."
foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,2,Fri Jul 17 04:17:28 2015 UTC,Bethesda probably figured they couldn't keep it all the way accurate because then men would have even more of the outfits and that wouldn't make for the most interesting gameplay.  Artistic license and all that stuff.
foshelter,3dj0ba,FlakCat,0,Fri Jul 17 11:10:35 2015 UTC,"I agree they decided to make it more interesting. If they were going to make more satisfying gameplay than more artistic accuracy, then why would they keep some more powerful outfits like Sheriff's Duster or Minuteman Outfit only for male?"
foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,3,Fri Jul 17 11:39:18 2015 UTC,I'd say they wanted a balance instead of going all-in on one category.

foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,-8,Fri Jul 17 12:29:27 2015 UTC,"1) The presence of 3 Dog and other characters indicates that this game takes place after 2280.  In the beginning the vault has one room, no power, no food, and no dwellers.  It is being built new and you populate it yourself by dragging wastelanders inside.  So no, the culture of the vault in fallout shelter is not one preserved from the 1950s, it is one introduced from 200 years of developing in the wasteland.  2)  Satire is ""the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices.""  What satirical message do you think Bethesda is sending by prohibiting women from using advantageous gear?"
foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,4,Thu Jul 16 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"1) You know how people in today's society create these gated communities to get away from the ""undesirables?""  Think of it like that.  These people wanted things to stay the same and didn't want the ""undesirable"" new rules to poison their lives, so they went and lived in a vault.  2) You have to look at the entire game.  You have situations where people are so happy that they'll grin as they slaughter raiders, people die with some of the goofiest faces I've ever seen, and people have conversations that are out of touch with the outside world.  One of these conversations involves someone asking for help with a crossword where they need a word for ""lives in the wasteland.""  People are dying outside, and these guys are worried about a freaking crossword.  I would consider these features an example of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule.  The gender specific clothing isn't satirical on its own, but the entire vault society is being satirized, so ""clothing roles"" are satirized by extension."
foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,-6,Thu Jul 16 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"Either Bethesda is using gendered restrictions to make the point that ""Things shouldn't be this way.""  In which case, they are right, things shouldn't be that way and the mechanic should be changed.  Encouraging players to enact damaging gender hierarchy, indefinitely, in an ongoing simulation with no endpoint in order to teach them that they shouldn't enact a gender hierarchy makes no sense.  It's not a clever move.  It is your most dramatic friend talking about how much they hate drama.  Or, Bethesda didn't notice it was building a totally imbalanced gendered hierarchy into their game, in which case they should just patch it and fix the problem."
foshelter,3dj0ba,Redd500,3,Thu Jul 16 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"I'd like them to change it from a gameplay perspective so I can use all equipment on anybody, but censoring its satire so impressionable people don't get the wrong idea?  That sounds like an awful idea."
foshelter,3dj0ba,Reddisaurusrekts,-4,Thu Jul 16 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"If you believe that it satire, you must understand it in a way that others do not.  Please explain the joke."
foshelter,3dj0ba,w4lt3r_s0bch4k,3,Fri Jul 17 00:03:16 2015 UTC,"I've explained it twice already, so I'll just quote myself real fast.   You have situations where people are so happy that they'll grin as they slaughter raiders, people die with some of the goofiest faces I've ever seen, and people have conversations that are out of touch with the outside world. One of these conversations involves someone asking for help with a crossword where they need a word for ""lives in the wasteland."" People are dying outside, and these guys are worried about a freaking crossword.   The fact that the vault society is so stereotypically '50s, cartoony, and oblivious to the awfulness just outside the door is what makes it a satire."
foshelter,3dj0ba,w4lt3r_s0bch4k,-4,Fri Jul 17 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have explained other jokes that exist in the game.  We all understand that the game has jokes in it.  Many of us here do not believe that the thing we are talking about was intended as a joke.  For example, I don't believe it is a joke because there is no trigger point that is designed to illicit a humor response, and that is how jokes work.  You are arguing that the game preventing the player from equipping good gear to female characters is a conscious design choice intended as a joke.  Please explain that joke."
foshelter,3dj0ba,zero_mistakes,3,Fri Jul 17 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"Every joke in this game is mocking the vault's society at large by pointing out how ridiculous it is, and by doing that, it shows every value held by the society as ridiculous.  The clothing doesn't need to be directly mocked because all the jokes are mocking it by proxy."
foshelter,3dj0ba,mypneumonia,-3,Fri Jul 17 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"So you think there was a conversation had between developers at Bethesda where someone said, ""My idea is to give male vault dwellers substantially more access to good equipment.""  And someone else said, ""Yes, that's a great idea, let's do that."" And they had this conversation with the implicit understanding that they were making a this decision as an effort to skewer the morals of sexist social hierarchies.  Which is to say that their decision to include gender inequality in the game was motivated by a sense of social justice.  And, if that is the case then it goes without saying that they also believed the majority of players would understand their subtle progressive message or at least be positively effected by it.  Because, of course, if players didn't understand that message the whole game would be tragically and ironically functionally reinforcing and replicating the exact thing it is intended to critique in the real minds of actual human players.  Is that really what's happening here?"

Most tended to be more like the 50's assignment of gender roles, with some exceptions like Reilly and Sunny Smiles.

foshelter,3dj0ba,Ultrace-7,5,Thu Jul 16 19:11:20 2015 UTC,Read my other comment.  :)
foshelter,3dj0ba,Ultrace-7,2,Thu Jul 16 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed. This game is a contemporary game for everyone, not a history book.   I never felt female NPCs from FO series had 'weaker' than their male counterparts from the start. First Citizen Lynette, Veronica, Cass, President Tandi, Reilly, Star Paladin Cross, Red Lucy, Christine, Red (Big Town),  and Lily Bowen. Even in NPC Rangers and soldiers, BoS Paladins, Enclave, Boomers, Great Khans, Jackals, Junk gang, New Canaan tribes and prospectors the women does same, role as the men. The notable exception is Caesar's Legion, San Francisco guards and Powder Gangers who can't accept women into their society for their own reason. Also a notable exception is Vault 101; as I remember all of guard officers were man.  The fact that male NPCs were many more itself does not justify that 23:7 inequality."
foshelter,3dj0ba,OscarMiguelRamirez,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:56 2015 UTC,IMO a video game is comparable to art and I really don't think people should change their art because it's not to your personal taste.   On the other side Bethesda is a business and I'm sure they would like to make as much money as possible and this small detail really doesn't affect anything related to the game and could easily be changed and no one would bat an eye.  Let the doods dress in drag damn it!
foshelter,3dj0ba,Ultrace-7,0,Thu Jul 16 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"Art is respected because it shouldn't be prohibited, but it is never free from criticism. If it is built to be controversial, it should be controversial, open to any criticism. And what OP doing is the criticism part, not prohibition part. Maybe the devs will never update the outfits gender-free, and may declare it as their prerogative as a creator; but the blame for it is also theirs.  BTW, I'd love to see cross-dressed dwellers in my vault. That's an idea!"
foshelter,3dj0ba,Zipo29,3,Fri Jul 17 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"A alreternate 1950's that is not our world, many things happened very differently In comparison. I think the game is being taken way too seriously then what it was meant to be. Maybe they could not get the code right to allow the female to wear the male without the male wearing the female which would open another can of worms all together? Or that they wanted to release the game in its current state to get money from the game they released for free to get the funding to fix that? Hurting a companies reputation by labeling them sexist over speculation is completely irresponsible, untill the company can defend themselves  how about putting the pitchforks down."
foshelter,3dj0ba,Ultrace-7,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:54 2015 UTC,Games are art and art is open to critique.  The game's developers made a choice to exclude female characters to access to high quality gear. This thread was started as a call asking the company to defend its artistic choice.
foshelter,3dj0ba,Itsmyredditbirthday,2,Fri Jul 17 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"Then you should be writing them directly (they love twiter and the do have their own forums that is not reddit, I am sure they pay people to monitor their own forums and not a 3rd parties forum) rather then spreading your agenda on here. to my knowledge reddit has not seen a Bethesda employee in here (on official business) so I see it as you just wanted to speak nonsense and not get your speculation crushed by said employees.  Art is up for critique and criticism, think of it like the justice system, innocent untill proven guilty, and speculation will not hold up in court as a argument, so let the defendants speak before you cast judgment."

In order to grow your vault you pretty much have to have a focus on getting women pregnant so they can pop out children. From a pragmatic standpoint, that makes sense, but there's really no call to say they can't be sports fans, sci-fi fans, ninjas and whatever else in the process."

foshelter,3da2k7,ArtistWolf,24,Tue Jul 14 17:55:42 2015 UTC,"I figured I'd share some tips on redesigning your vault, if you ever choose to do so. The following took me somewhere between 1-2 weeks, and I'm still making constant upgrades.  This vault is still my first and original vault. After slowly expanding, building up my population, arming everyone and training them up, I wound up with a bunched up mess that looked like this: http://imgur.com/1Ar4zmD  Upon speaking with some friends about their designs, I decided to expand my vault and section off everything according to room type, as well as leave some gaps to allow radroach and fire breakouts to simply fade away in areas of the vault I eventually intend not to use. I counted 25 total available floors, and set about creating a design in Excel. The goal was to have the connecting 2-block rooms be the training rooms that associated with the 3-block rooms to the left and right of the training room, with 1 minor exception. Here's my initial blueprint: http://imgur.com/rUKbdl0  While it might not be the most efficient, it certainly had everything grouped together. The toughest part would be going from a 3-3-2 design to a 3-2-3 design, and how to efficiently move everything. My first step was to remove all of the rocks from the entire map. This took quite a bit of time. The next step was to extend my left elevator shaft all the way to the bottom of the map, and start building up.  What I discovered is you couldn't build an elevator on floor 25 if it only connected to the room at the very bottom. This lead me to discover that if you build an elevator on say floor 24 off or a room, and there isn't an existing elevator attached to the one you are trying to place, the game will give you a 2-for-1 elevator and automatically place the one below it. Through time and expansion, the next step looked like this: http://imgur.com/FcO7Iw8  The next goal was to get the right elevator done, and make sure that my resource gathering was still enough to keep the base functional while I was redesigning. The second elevator was just about finished at this point: http://imgur.com/dxuVJVU  Another thing I learned was that 6, level 2 residential rooms will get you to the 200 residential cap. Since fire and roach strength is based on room level, I had to remove the level 3 residential rooms and juggle doing that with my current population in order to get all 6 of the rooms at level 2. I finally fished that around this point: http://imgur.com/2TzrHir  The last step was to get level 1 rooms placed in all of the spots I had set up in my blueprint. My resources were still holding at max, and I completed this a few days ago. The only major adjustment I did was move the power rooms to the center of the vault: http://imgur.com/LC5Qu3Z  From here, everything is just going to get upgraded to level 2 or 3 as needed, and people are training up like crazy. Some of the rooms have been upgraded from the final photo, and I recently completed training on 2 super dwellers (10s in all 7 stats) and sent them out to explore. It's taken quite a bit of time, but I'm enjoying the new layout.  Has anyone else done any major redesigns using an existing vault? Did you come across and tricks or trouble while doing it? I'm curious to see what everyone else has done. Feel free to share your stories and vault designs!"
foshelter,3da2k7,drumther,11,Tue Jul 14 18:10:50 2015 UTC,I found that I can faster find my rooms If you order your floors to spell SPECIAL from top to bottom :D
foshelter,3da2k7,b_oarder,6,Tue Jul 14 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"I actually had that with my training rooms in the pre-redesign image. I tried to keep that up in the new design, but I wanted to keep eventual empty rooms (living and storage) at the bottom of the map.  What not doing that allowed me to do was have a bar as the first room past the vault door. ""Welcome in from the wasteland, stranger! Have a beer!"""
foshelter,3da2k7,FeelJAkir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:51:45 2015 UTC,I was thinking of putting a game room for my first floor. It would be a nice welcome to new dwellers from the wasteland. Also I can have guys train on them for Luck and then send em to explore for money :)
foshelter,3da2k7,SaintNickPR,2,Wed Jul 15 20:18:30 2015 UTC,thats how my vault is.
foshelter,3da2k7,dutchposer,3,Wed Jul 15 06:35:11 2015 UTC,You dont have problems with the power being so far away from rooms? Maybe make a generator cluster on the bottom and another on the top
foshelter,3da2k7,Grig_,5,Wed Jul 15 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"No problems with power at all. Even with only 5 of the 8 power rooms actually staffed with people, I can still generate enough power to keep the vault running, keep it capped at maximum, and I don't have to rush anything to stay ahead.  I thought I heard something about diminishing returns on power rooms and distance from other rooms, but that might only pertain to rooms shutting down in the event of available supply of power dropping below the vault's demand for it. I figured I would try and design a vault that wouldn't have a problem with power and not have to worry about it."
foshelter,3da2k7,b_oarder,3,Wed Jul 15 02:59:20 2015 UTC,A room's distance from a generator only matters when you go into the red on your power bar.
foshelter,3da2k7,b_oarder,2,Wed Jul 15 07:05:19 2015 UTC,My hero! :D
foshelter,3da2k7,b_oarder,2,Wed Jul 15 11:28:26 2015 UTC,How did you earn a lot of money for the redesign? I bought 20 boxes and have aroundo 7-10k coins out of it... not enough
foshelter,3da2k7,b_oarder,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"It was all patience and having resource rooms that came up quickly in order to increase the odds of getting bonus caps over a period of time.  Prior to the redesign, most of my resource rooms were fully staffed with people that had 10s in their primary stat for that room. Most were also wearing +3 primary stat armor. Some of them also had 10s in luck as well.  Since bonus caps are based on the luck of the people in the rooms, and I was collecting quite often (about every 60 seconds), the odds of getting bonus caps was pretty good. Sometimes I would only get a few caps, sometimes 200 or more. It would add up pretty quickly if I was diligent enough about playing continuously and collecting whenever resource rooms would pop.  One thing I will say though, is that it was hell on my phone's battery. I would only continuously play when I could have the phone plugged in."
foshelter,3da2k7,nick2k23,2,Wed Jul 15 19:06:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Do you think a dweller with 10 luck is going to make more money in a room vs if i had just sent him out in the wastes (with full stims/+10 endurance)?
foshelter,3da2k7,Tikikala,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  That would probably depend on how often you play, how often your resource rooms come up, and how much luck those rooms have, versus how many people you have out in the wastes and their survivability. My personal feeling is that if you have time to sit and play continuously, and you are able to get a pretty good income from cap bonuses on resource room collections, that's the faster way to go. Sending someone out into the wastes certainly can bring in a bunch chunk of caps all at once, but the time needed to not only send them out but get them back can be pretty long.  For example, right now I have 17 total rooms I can collect from. One full collection of all 17 netted me 342 caps. The next round was 472 caps. The third round was only 268. The fourth round was 508. In about 5 minutes, I racked up a little over 1.5k in caps.  On the flip side, I currently only have 2 people exploring the wastes. Both have 10s in all SPECIAL stats and each left with 25 stims. They have been out for 30 hours. One has 5,112 caps, and the other has 5,466 caps. It would take me an additional 15 hour to recall them. That's a total of 45 hours to collect the 10k in caps they have, versus the 1.5k in caps in 5 minutes from collections.  Everyone's vault will be different, but in my case, it was way faster for me to just sit and play continuously for 30 minutes than it was to have people wandering the wastes. If you can do both though, that would work even better! The only reason I didn't have people in the wastes during the remodeling was I was trying to train them to have all 10s."
foshelter,3da2k7,Richard_Fist,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. And man your vault looks sexy as fuck. I want to redo mine to look like yours but my 20 lunchbox purchases... haha. Oh well i'll just start a new one.
foshelter,3da2k7,Killscare,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I would honestly say keep the vault you have and work on moving things around. Outside of the vault door and the first elevator after it, you can move everything via destruction and rebuilding. Sure it takes a lot of time and caps to do, but at least you have the rooms already unlocked, hopefully some people trained up and a cache of weapons and armor. It might take longer to start over from scratch.  Don't get discouraged and good luck! Feel free to ask any other questions you might have and I'll do my best to answer them."
foshelter,3da2k7,scantron3000,2,Wed Jul 15 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"None extremely important right now. You answered all of em. On an unrelated note, I love these simulation games since I try to play them with some ""lore/background/logic(?)"" behind my designs. My first vault already had a similar layout to yours --- the same production rooms stacked on top of each other. But then I thought I wanted a vault that made ""some"" sense. Like when I enter this vault for the first time and stepping out the elevator I wanted to see an entire power plant floor, gardening floor and cafeteria hall, huge levels dedicated to one production/theme/purpose. So I scrapped that vault, now working on a new one and then impulse bought 20 lunchboxes.   (>_<.."
foshelter,3da2k7,DrD0ak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, I do the same thing. It's all about logic (for my need for things to be in order), throw in a little lore/RP (for the geek in me), and try to make it all aesthetic pleasing (for the artist in me).  Part of what has appealed so much to me about Fallout Shelter is the ability to move things around after the fact. That's one thing that always bothered me about the base building in XCOM, which has the similar ant farm look to it, was that I almost felt locked into building certain things at certain times. Trying to make a logical layout decisions became difficult or near impossible due to the time it would take to do so. Back in the original X-COM, my bases were very specifically laid out from start to finish.  I get way too anal and worked up over how things look. It has to have a system that makes sense, and yet looks good, or else it drives me crazy."

foshelter,3da2k7,Ewh1t3,2,Tue Jul 14 20:10:32 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/IHLpYXr  That's my setup right now... Very similar to your picture. I just haven't bothered getting rid of the last 2 food / water and moving the last power station over to the right side.  I could use maybe 1 more power and a little less food / water but I'm also overbuilt right now on training rooms just for fun.

foshelter,3da2k7,Openworldgamer47,0,Tue Jul 14 20:49:17 2015 UTC,If it’s causing your anxiety and your obsessing about it then compulsively changing it to stop the obsessing then it is OCD.

foshelter,3da2k7,quartercow,3,Wed Jul 15 11:24:14 2015 UTC,Aren't training rooms better as 3s so you get the bonus time off? and Power rooms are better as twos because three twos for power are better than two three rooms.
foshelter,3da2k7,k0te21,2,Wed Jul 15 00:28:44 2015 UTC,"At the time I created this design, I didn't know this about the power working better in twos. I also didn't know that training rooms would work better in blocks of three. It's only after coming here and browsing the boards for an hour did I see it, but too much work had gone into the current design. I would love to see the times to train up stats based on room size and room level, and see how much time you really save. In my current design, it really only shaves off about 2 hours in a two block room between level 2 and level 3 when training form a 9 to a 10 in a stat.  I will probably work out a completely optimal design that still creates a tidy look sometime in the future when this vault maxes out and the only way to make the game fresh is to start over."

foshelter,3da2k7,k0te21,2,Wed Jul 15 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, could you explain this? I'm currently working on a redesign and I'm curious if there was some math done to support this."
foshelter,3da2k7,iczyg,2,Mon Jul 20 13:12:53 2015 UTC,I don't know the exact math because I've seen it stated so frequently that I took it as fact there's a efficiency sheet somewhere on the sub ether studied or a top post just search efficiency sheet on this sub and you should find it. I know the training rooms work better as threes because you get a small bonus for having 6 people in training rooms.

foshelter,3da2k7,FeelJAkir,3,Wed Jul 15 00:47:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I would advise moving your living quarters around before you hit the population cap. Once you can have 200 people able to live in your vault, you can't build any more living quarters. This makes it impossible to move the rooms around without killing off some of your population first."
foshelter,3da2k7,FeelJAkir,3,Wed Jul 15 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"You could actually send your dwellers into the wasteland temporarily to empty out the rooms, then call them back when you're done rearranging the vault.

S: 3 - Is significantly stronger than the others. Started off as lvl 1 and rarely takes damage. P: 3 - No noticeable difference E: 4 - Has yet to obtain radiation. None whatsoever. C: 3 - No noticeable difference I: 6  - No noticeable difference A: 3 - No noticeable difference L: 4 - Generates more caps. Currently is about 125% of the others despite less time.   I theorize that the stat boosts become more visible the further you get. Perhaps once I hit the three day mark I can isolate each stat's power first hand.

foshelter,3d9tzf,Killscare,5,Tue Jul 14 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"My mind is Crazy. JK. Really, when i started to redesign, I picked areas to focus my Training area vs my Production area based on where I already have the largest centralization of those two already, so i'd have less rooms to move/create. I deleted a lot of rooms so I could build rooms specific to the area it was in. It sort of just ended up like this. As for the space between rooms, I like white space. It is aesthetically pleasing to me to not have everything side by side. also helps manage fires and roach attacks..."

foshelter,3d9tzf,DjKorrosiv,2,Tue Jul 14 20:37:14 2015 UTC,Nicely done. Did you have a point where you had to completely redesign the vault or did you just go with it from start to present day?
foshelter,3d9tzf,DrD0ak,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"Total redesign. The Bedrooms were the hardest, because i had to kill off 30 dwellers in order to move  them one by one, and fully upgrade them before i could start to move the next one. Also the reactors and Nuka-cola rooms get EXPENSIVE when you have a few, so it was hard to compensate production levels. Per my other comments, It really added a way to extend the end-game for me on a single Vault. rather than restarting a new vault with role-playing, i opted to do a combination of strategy/puzzle management to organize my vault! Glad you like it!"

Vault1.sav (Top Vault n the game Vault list),  Vault2.sav (Middle Vault n the game Vault list), Vault3.sav (Bottom Vault n the game Vault list). Export the vault you want to backup.    Reinstall FOShelter app and then repeat the steps above, but instead of export, just import the file back in and then do a sync in iTunes. Your device with reset.

She had maxed out stats though.  She is still going with 3 stims at 4d 25m at this point.  She only started with 25 too.  I'm pretty sure she is at the item limit as new items in the dialogue don't seem to be appearing below, but I'm letting her keep going to see how far she gets.

foshelter,3dby1f,ickeruno,3,Wed Jul 15 04:10:47 2015 UTC,This happened to me. I deleted extra rooms and revived the dwellers I could.  Put at least one person  in food and water and the rest in power. Save up without rushing and slowly revive everyone else.  Revive low level (cheap) people first. Once your vault is somewhat stable you can focus on getting your good dwellers back.
foshelter,3dby1f,thecomplainian,2,Wed Jul 15 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"My first vault was very poorly designed and horribly inefficient and then my 2nd one had way too many people getting radiation poisoning from lack of water and they were all upset which caused the speed of power generation to also go down, then I wasn't able to get much money to upgrade anything and I gave up on that vault.  Vault 3 is going strong!"
foshelter,3dby1f,havek23,2,Wed Jul 15 16:14:22 2015 UTC,I would revive a power room first since rooms can't produce without power. Then food and water. Finally med and science bays. Don't revive all your population yet. Just the necessary ones to save on food and water until they are all healthy and you have full stimpaks and radaways.

I used to make elaborate mazes for raiders to run through.

With these I'll let them get to ~8 in a production stat – for me Strength or Endurance – and decently high Luck, then send them to that production room...equipped with the correct outfit. I'll then swap in another dweller, from that room and continue raising their stat.  It's playing the long game, but at this rate I'll soon be able to send lots of top stat / top level dwellers to explore the wastelands...at the moment it's just over 15% of my vault."

BUT If you reach endgame where all your workers got 10 luck plus 10 of the specific required skill, you can just rush rooms to get any resource you need thus those +special clothings become useless beyond the aesthetic point, and the raised luck will help you getting more caps per room.

I started with just having the training rooms as singles, so I stuck 7 pairs in each and began rotating them. Rebuilt them a few times until most training rooms are triples and the timelines started getting messed up which is why my team of 14 isn't fully maxed together. My only question was what to have them wear... I started them with formal wear / fancy formal wear, but I have 6-7 Power Armors so I was considering having half of them in Power Armor. But if they're all maxed, does it matter what they wear?"
foshelter,3d96k1,rein00,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:10:07 2015 UTC,Stats above 10 count. E above 10 will make them immune to radiation from the wastes.
foshelter,3d96k1,redscull,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"11 endurance makes them fully rad immune, but 10 endurance is virtually immune. I honestly think that endurance is one of the lamest stats to have on gear since it's easy enough to train an explorer up to 10, and the benefit after that is so minuscule (as best I can tell). Radaways do an ok job making up for low endurance early on, but you definitely want your pros at 10 endurance eventually instead of relying on radaways because you get more efficiency out of your stims (best I can tell).  You definitely want +7 stats gear on your top explorers, and I personally wouldn't use gear with +endurance unless it's just +1 and the other +6 is non-endurance. +luck is great for extra caps, all the way up to the full 17, but only if you still need caps. Otherwise, +strength helps kill bigger monsters thus longer survivability thus ever-increasing roll chances on loot. +perception supposedly makes a difference in getting good loot from the special static events like the National Guard Depot at 60 hours. +agility is also theorized to help mitigate damage fighting monster thus survivability thus increasing more loot opportunities. +intelligence may function similarly to agility in making fight outcomes more favorable, but neither is as important as strength and nothing is more important than the weapon equipped. +charisma has minimal use as far as I'm aware (one special encounter).  So I'd focus on strength and perception for best overall loot acquisition."

foshelter,3d6bbh,yakatuus,5,Mon Jul 13 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"If there are, I haven't really found them.  Right now I'm trying to get a baseline of what the minimum Strength + End would be.  I found that 7s in all wasn't cutting it, but 8s + Battle Armor + 15 dmg gun is fine.  The Super Mutant Masters are the real bottleneck IMO, but trying to pin down if you need 24 or 25 has been tough.  I used to think they might be 23 minimum but I have a 10 Str, 10 End level 47 using a 11-15 gun and he's getting hammered.  Like everyone who has 24+ is in the mid 10s for Stimpaks at the 50 hour FTE and he's at 3 and half health with 10 hours to go. Edit: Now that I look, I have a 13 Str, 10 End, 12-14 Weapon explorer who isn't going to make hour 51.  This seems to indicate that your Str isn't as effective as I thought.  Maybe its 2 Str = 1 point of dmg? You can make it there with all sevens with your best weapons, but for combat shotguns I'd say they need 8 Strength (and the Battle Armor) at least.  The Endurance is pretty variable.  Higher is better but 7 was a good baseline.    Bottom line, when my explorers were min 7 S/E, about 15-20% got through the 50-60 hour gauntlet.  At min 8 S/E, I'm predicting about 90%.  I'd think 8 S/7 E would be maybe 60-65%."

A +/- means that the room is already at capacity, but assigning the dweller you are dragging will add or subtract from the total stats for that room. For example, a +2 means that the dweller you are dragging has a stat is is 2 better than someone else in that room. Releasing the dweller into that room will replace the dweller with the lower stat. A -1 would mean that the dweller you are dragging has a stat that's 1 less than the worst person in the room.  Sending people with higher stats out into the wasteland will generally give them better results from the wasteland. A single stimpack and radaway won't last too long, but the more levels that person gets, the better they will do. The other thing you could do with them is train up their stats where they have less than 10.  Dwellers can be brought back to life, for a price. The cost in caps varies from person to person. Even ones in the wasteland can be brought back.  If you get raided, try and kill them as fast as you can. You can assign 2 people to the vault door as permanent guards. Your other option is to put well-armed people in the first room past the vault door and initial elevator. Kill raiders as fast as you can, since they steal your resources as long as they are active in your base. Finally, you can drag help to rooms when you get attacked. Anyone dragged into help will return to their former rooms when the raid is over. Remember though, pregnant women and children won't fight, so keep them out of rooms that are most likely going to be attacked in a raid.  Good luck!"
foshelter,3d9v4g,ArtistWolf,3,Tue Jul 14 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"When you drag someone over a room, if you see a number without a +/-, it means there is an available spot in that room and it shows you the stat that dweller has that's associated with that room.   Small addendum - If you replace someone with equal stats the number will be zero."
foshelter,3d9v4g,oddsonicitch,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response :D  Preston's level 27 compared to the other dwellers' 4 and only took 1 damage so far in 40 minutes... Though I don't trust him for 7 hours if I go to sleep, and I found out I accidentally gave him 2 stimpacks and 0 radaways. I called him back :T  I'll deal with the rest tomorrow morning I guess."
foshelter,3d9v4g,ArtistWolf,2,Tue Jul 14 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  You can give someone up to 25 each of stims and rads. I'd load him up with as many as you can when you send him back out next time. The early on stuff isn't too difficult, but he will definitely encounter tougher enemies the longer he's out there, but he will also bring back better loot too.  One more thing about sending someone out is that if they level up while they are out there, they will heal back to full health. A low level character with high stats can stay out there and survive pretty well."
foshelter,3d9v4g,DrD0ak,2,Tue Jul 14 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"If a room is full it will compare the dweller you want to put in vs who is already in there. So for example in your power plant if you have 6 people in that room the game will compare who you're dropping in vs the current lowest person in there.  When a room is not full it will just display their number for the respective stat of the room.  As for Preston he is likely of the most use to you running outside and shagging down new gear for your other people. You should give him as many stim packs as you have and send him out. Longer trips = better gear.  All dwellers can be revived, whether they die in the vault or outside.  You may want to think about putting a couple dwellers at the door to fight raiders. Generally speaking give them the better/best armor and weapons you have. Aside from the people you send outside of course."

foshelter,3d7rnu,Itsmyredditbirthday,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"the X is just extra, it help me visualize the map, could be 0 if you want. I had layout that where not efficient to me. Specially when raiders come and attack you, notice the 1st elevator is not connected. I force the raiders to go through the first 2 power rooms and then take the elevator to the dinner room on the left. All personal on the power room are armed to the teeth and being productive at the same time.  For most of the time, raiders die off on the 1st room and struggles are taken care off on the 2nd power room. No need to waste 2 people at the vault door. All main resources are concentrated at the top and can easily keep build going down with out saturating the top and middle part.  Plus you can use the map to rearrange your own layouts."

foshelter,3d2tzm,SatansHairyNutsack,3,Mon Jul 13 05:25:45 2015 UTC,"Text from original thread, it's in the top thirty or so posts.  Hi guys I found an exploit to earn lunch boxes! It does require a new game however. I haven't fully tested if it works with all combinations but I'll tell you what I know Step one complete tutorial Objectives at the beginning are prefixed to give you lunch boxes. For an example: collect food 50 gives one lunch box.  Step two you can complete any objectives except for (sell weapon or outfit and equit dweller with outfit) even if the reward is to give lunch box.)  Note: ignoring those two will loop whatever objective you already completed. For an example it will give you an objective to collect 50 food or water for 50 caps. Once completed it will tell you to collect with a another resource for a lunch box. After completing it will loop to a different resource for 50 caps again. Once completed you'll get the same mission for a lunch box. (Or other lunch box mission such as level up dweller). So to sum it up. Leave controllable objectives alone like Selling or equipping for lunch box You can do that later once you mass lunch boxes. Seems like the first few objectives are tutorial objectives. Completing all that gives you lunch box will trigger to the normal random objective. Things to note: you can build bases Send out dwellers Rush rooms Skip objectives using x (leave the two like I said) Level up dwellers Unlock buildings. http://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/3aar4o/unlimited_lunch_box_glitch_without/"

If you kept two objectives (sell 1 outfit/gun, equip 1 dweller with an outfit - both of these are very early on) then the third objective will loop between level up 1 dweller, get 50 food, and get 50 water; about 3 out of every 5 times this third objective would be for a lunchbox."

This nuclear garden housed 3 pregnant CHUD's and was not adjacent to anything. A new male dweller would be accepted to the vault, and immediately ride the elevator all the way down to the darkest depths of vault triple eight. His joy of being accepted rapidly turned to terror as the preggo chud's would sacrifice him to their many-faced radroach gods, throwing up their hands and wailing and chanting. After he was dead, they would till his body into the soil, the fruit of which was fed to those on higher levels."

Conversely by sending them off into the wasteland, you let the wasteland claim them!

foshelter,3d3x1i,demifool,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"Best method is wastelanding.  When a dweller dies in the wasteland, and you don't remove them, they still add to your dweller count  -- if you're still in the process of getting 100 population for cola.  You also get a chance (albeit a very slim one) that they'll end up finding a legendary/rare, in which case you can just return them and make them suicide again.  If you use dweller list -> explorers instead of tapping outside and scrolling for explorers, you also won't experience any real lag from having all these dead dwellers in the wasteland.  Absolutely no reason to have a 'kill room' unless you really need a dweller to die quickly.  A kill room adds more energy cost, and you can't use the room for production (if you don't remove the dead dwellers, you'll kill happiness for anyone trying to work there. ...assuming you want to raise population count.)

It's been announced that Fallout 4 is set in 2277.  So there's plenty of time for a disaster where everyone dies.  Then the protagonist of F4 can wander into our vault, collect all the caps and weapons we had, and be armed to the teeth at the beginning of the game.

foshelter,3d0tdw,iceberg_sweats,4,Mon Jul 13 02:29:30 2015 UTC,Depends on what you want. Endurance = less radiation and more health while luck = more caps.  IMO endurance is more important at first. Once your dweller can survive for 60 hours (to get to the national guard depot/chance at legendary) then luck becomes more important

foshelter,3d1szn,Atlatas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:55:40 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. Saying it's perfect is just factually incorrect. The average walk time to get to an elevator is higher with that build, even if it's marginal. The only thing about this that is slightly ""better"" is that the raiders can't take an elevator down until they've gone through the vault entrance and then 2 storage rooms. But once you have some decent weapons and skilled dwellers you should be able to deal with a raid before they even go past a single room.   I suppose it does look nicer, but that isn't as big of a factor for me, since efficiency is one of the main goals of running the vault."

It doesn't matter how many rooms you need to get there. 60str from 6 maxed dwellers in a single room is equal to 10 rooms full of 60 guys with 1 str each.  For a full vault with far too many rooms I have 5 power rooms that are 2-wide and 1 full 3-wide room. It's more than enough.

Any time I would send a dweller from one training room, it would walk through the floor to the other one, and then occasionally walk (through the floors) back and forth between them.  I'll call these rooms From and To. From usually looked empty, because all the dwellers were visiting To.  Since it looked like From was the broken room, I deleted it and recreated it at another location. This became AlsoFrom... it was just as glitched. In fact, it suffered a radroach attack, and the roaches also showed up on To!  As soon as that attack was done, I moved everyone out of To, deleted the room, and recreated it (I think in another location as well). This finally broke the curse, and everyone went back to working where they were supposed to.  So, if I had to do it again, I'd put all the dwellers from both rooms into a storage room, delete both buggy rooms, and recreate them. Expensive, but quick to fix.  Good luck!"

I was able to move dwellers successfully into the new ""to"" room, but attempting to move dwellers into the ""from"" room didn't do anything (like, they actually wouldn't attempt to move at all). So I had to delete and rebuild the ""from"" room as well, and that worked.  tl;dr yes, replace both buggy rooms.  It was also two agility rooms for me.  edit* - I lied; the ""from"" location remains cursed."
foshelter,3d3cdj,RibsNGibs,2,Sat Jul 18 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"I just encountered this bug for the first time when I upgraded an Agility training room from level 2 to level 3. I could assign the infected dwellers to others rooms, and they would eventually make it there. Assigning them to another room after that one worked, but every time I tried to assign them back to the infected agility room, they would start floating again.  Like atteSmythe said above here, my only solution was to delete the infected Agility room and recreate it. Upon completing the replacement room, I tried the infected dwellers back in the new room, and the functioned normally. I then upgraded the room to level 2 and tried again, and everything is still working.  At some point I will try upgrading the room to level 3 to see what happens. I know I recently upgraded a Strength training room from level 2 to level 3 with people inside it and didn't encounter any problems."

foshelter,3d2wv3,marshull,2,Mon Jul 13 02:33:39 2015 UTC,What's the best way to level up a dweller though? thanks for replying.
foshelter,3d2wv3,Skittle_Juice,3,Mon Jul 13 02:36:10 2015 UTC,Having them exploring the wastes is the fastest that I know of. They'll get the most xp from killing harder enemies they encounter after being out long enough.
foshelter,3d2wv3,Alex_Duos,3,Mon Jul 13 02:46:08 2015 UTC,Not to mention they level up without you having to open up the game to tap on them.
foshelter,3d2wv3,Flashdancer405,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"They should level up over time simply by working in a room. Also, training their stats supposedly increases survivability."
foshelter,3d2wv3,HabeQuiddum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"A stronger weapon if you have one.  Also, a 33 won't make it to the 60th hour when you have a shot at a legendary item.  A 35 might if he has a powerful weapon (20 dmg or more).  Otherwise, you'll want to wait until about 42 or later."
foshelter,3d2wv3,TheSheepAreOnStrike,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:03:47 2015 UTC,"Your dweller has great stats so that isnt the problem. You should be using gear that boosts endurance by a lot over anything else. Wasteland gear (+3) or even better, heavy wasteland gear (+7) is optimal.  Give him the best weapon you have and he should last at least 2 days  My level 20 guy has 7 endurance/luck and mediocre other stats but i send him out with heavy wasteland gear and the vengeance gun 21-26 damage and he lasts 2+ days"
foshelter,3d2wv3,HabeQuiddum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:15:44 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned his S, P, E and L stats are at 10. He's wearing power armour and carries a 19 damage flamer. He's never made it to two days though."
foshelter,3d2wv3,rein00,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:35:05 2015 UTC,"To give you some hard data, I just had a dweller make it to the 60 hour mark who had 8/10/8/10/8/10/11 SPECIAL.  She had on Sturdy Merc Gear - stats bonuses already included above - and was wielding an Enhanced Railway Rifle which does 14-16 damage.  I sent her out with 25 Stimpaks and 10 RadAways of which she used 20 and 5 respectively.    I have wrote down that she left as a level 12 but that strikes me a bit low.  In any case, she returns as a level 48.  Assuming that the 12 was a typo, the lowest level dweller I've personally had make it to the 60 hour mark is 30 and she was equipped with a Wazer Wifle which does 14 to 17 damage."
foshelter,3d2wv3,HabeQuiddum,2,Mon Jul 13 15:06:00 2015 UTC,12 is likely correct. Over 10 they can go out fresh and basically complete challenges often enough to level up to full health before they need a stim pack. They often make it from 10 to 50 without using one if their stats/gear are good enough.
foshelter,3d2wv3,rein00,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:07 2015 UTC,Have you found a minimum weapon damage that prevents a dweller from making it to hour 60?  I try to send them out with 16 or more but I'm running out of those types of weapons (or I've handed them out to the general population not realizing I'd need them for my explorers).

It's a neat little mobile game made by Bethesda, who normally makes big triple A titles like The Elder Scrolls series and Fallout.  They didn't intend for it to get big, and didn't need the money from it, so they kept freemium stuff, pay-to-win and advertisements out completely.  It's pretty cool.  Of course, even with that tiny amount of monetization, it became more profitable than Candy Crush the week after it was released.  It's fun."

No adds, no required wifi, rushing production is completely free, but has a chance of failing and causing an incident in your vault (for instance, a room can catch on fire, and the fire needs to be put out by the people in it).  The only thing you can pay for, like OP said, are basically a pack of four items from in-game currency to special people for your vault, and you earn those through natural progression, and they're relatively common too, so it never feels like you need to buy them."

foshelter,3d1xnt,Zoijja,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:31:00 2015 UTC,"Did he get the Fat Man from a national guard depot? They have a much higher chance of dropping legendary items, and as far as we know, are the last big event that lets you do so. However, the longer you go, the higher chance you have for better loot. Warning though: Your dweller will not pick up items after the 100th item, even if you find something fantastic. Good luck!"

foshelter,3d1xnt,Archardy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:08:33 2015 UTC,"Afaik you can't get more than 100 items, so have him come back at that point. It usually happens around four days out.  I had a guy with 125 stimpaks with the exploit and had him out 9-10 days and he still didn't get more than 100 items. Sure you might get more bottle caps if you have him out longer, but 4 days covers all the random chances to get legendary gear and anything beyond that is wasting time on him coming back so he can go out again."

foshelter,3d1xnt,Archardy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:10:17 2015 UTC,I haven't figured out one. If you don't want to count them I suppose you could remember the first couple items and the last couple items (in case it reverses) and see if new ones stop replacing those

Over the last few days I'm barely getting any caps from production rooms now.  I guess we're suppose to get caps from wastelands instead of production rooms?
foshelter,3d2trl,Vilath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it is Luck. However, all my ""working"" dwellers have 10 of whatever room they're working in and 10 luck. Not sure If the room's main stat does matter too. But in any case, luck does matter for sure."

It's completely unrelated to your loot storage capacity which is tied to your storage rooms. So it's impossible for them to take up too much room.  But if you really want to get rid of them, send them out on exporters, or room rush to trigger roaches and fires repeatedly so your dwellers get hurt and need stims. For radaways, you could stop collecting water so all your dwellers get radiation."

foshelter,3czxtr,mystery_stain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:23:15 2015 UTC,Yes - exactly. Can't build any new ones and can't destroy the old ones without reducing the population first. Are you at 200 dweller capacity?

foshelter,3czxtr,Grig_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:25:35 2015 UTC,You won't need to rearrange everything for a long while! Once you get some nuke cola up and running and you max out your dwellers the only thing left is to reorganize the rooms. At that point you may want to move your barracks.

All IOS7 devices and later, are supported, and must be to be published on appstore. Even when IOS9 is released, they will have to keep supporting iphone4s because that too, is compatible with it. The license to publish on appstore, requires that you must support all devices that runs the OS you set as the requirement, which for FOS is iOS7. So any device that runs iOS7, must be supported. That's not the same as it running well on those devices, but the constant crashing must be fixed even on those devices."

foshelter,3cyfrd,Itsmyredditbirthday,0,Mon Jul 13 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"The Soldier's Uniform is female only, the male equivalent is the Wrestler's Outfit.  I've found a lot of them; around 8 compared to only 4 Wrestler's Outfits.  Really the only legendary outfit a female can't wear other than the Minuteman Uniform is Autumn's Outfit.  All the others lack Strength which might be a requirement to get past Behemoths.    Your first tier of explorers is going to be all male because of the need to breed early in the game.  But as soon as you can get some females exploring, it is useful to have them precisely for the soldier's outfit IMO."
foshelter,3cyfrd,yakatuus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:54:43 2015 UTC,"I want to point out you're assuming Soldier Uniforms are commonly found across all vaults? I don't have any Soldier Uniforms, but I have 2 Wrestler Outfits.  Additionally, the situation where you have a surplus of Soldier Uniforms works out for you, but overall it's two same rarity classed items who have the same stats and fit both genders, which balance out, so what you're doing isn't for everyone as some might have a surplus of Wrestler outfits instead of Soldier Uniforms, or an even number of both. Again, this is assuming people want to buff the Strength stat for any reason and not anything else.   Whilst it's unconfirmed that strength is the stat required to get past Behemoths, I will agree that your statement where all the other outfits that are male only do not have strength. If we actually need the strength stat for getting past them. So in the event that other stats are needed out more in the wasteland, such as Perception, Enduranec or Agility, the Strength thing isn't going to work out too well."

That way you can assign them there without worrying about females getting pregnant. Or if you have high luck and charisma, they have a rare chance to get pregnant.

foshelter,3czqhc,KingRainbow,2,Sun Jul 12 06:41:20 2015 UTC,"If you checked and have plenty of living space, then that's not the problem.

Makes for a different approach to things.   Another one I like that reminds me of classic Fallout's vault full of blue-suited dwellers is that no one can wear an outfit unless it's at least +5 stats (i.e. rare or legendary).  I think my next vault is going to focus more on genetics. Like only blondes allowed. Or only the darkest skinned people. Or maybe only wild hair colors (though I think I've only seen pink hair on females). Kind of a variation of the ""Gary"" vault with cloning (definitely not meant to be racist)."

foshelter,3cwo8l,Murdock07,8,Sat Jul 11 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"I think a reasonable way for this to be done would be by slot. So if you bought lunch boxes on the first slot, only after destroying and restarting a new vault in slot one would you be entitled to re-acquiring those boxes. Your slot two and three vaults would never get boxes you'd bought in slot one.  But honestly, I discovered they kind of take the fun out. Did for me anyway. I had a vault that I'd bought $24 of boxes on. Eventually deleted it. Had another where I did the lunch box bug (since fixed) to get tons of boxes. Also don't really play it now. My favorite vault is the one that's been the most challenging, and too many lunch boxes, especially ones acquired too easily, takes away a lot of the challenge.  I wish they'd give us other things to spend money on. Like, I'd love to be able to unlock additional vault slots so that I can keep more than just three at a time. Or unlock cosmetic-style content, like different mountain types/layouts. Things that don't really make the game easier, just more interesting, more variety."

I think you could be right about pre-text. I feel like I've seen different text for the same enemy, but I've never recorded anything.   I would doubt it's an indication of chance sets, e.g. one set of text means you have 20%, another means you have 50% chance of success etc. Everything in this game to date is a smooth linear function that we slide along. The text could help us figure out the special stats tests of various enemies though.   I'll add column to the table at sections 7.6 so we can investigate further."

Not sure the reasoning behind not getting mention notifications from posts (I'm guessing it would be a lot more work to get self posts to show up in your inbox, while the framework for having comment replies show up there already existed), but just something to be aware of.

foshelter,3cy12m,yakatuus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what the rooms are, because I've had raiders go down the elevator."
foshelter,3cy12m,redscull,3,Sat Jul 11 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"Raiders do not go down the elevator unless there are no dwellers in any rooms on your top floor.  Also, you'll lose less resources to raiders if the room next to the entrance has sufficient dweller firepower to kill them quickly. You mentioned putting a storage room there. I like the logic/roleplay of that choice, but unless you plan to staff it with dwellers (who won't be passively gaining exp like they would in a production room), it's not the most efficient option."
foshelter,3cy12m,redscull,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"Aesthetics and logic both have utility to me, and so I am going to redesign with a central double-elevator beneath severa layers of storage on the top level.  I am not actually using nuka cola at all right now, but I would rather free up more of my dwellers for exploration and so I will have to figure out what to do about that.  Probably have 1-1-1 ratio of nuka-garden-water.  Makes more sense aesthetically than having my whole vault run on soda."
foshelter,3cy12m,amateur_simian,2,Sat Jul 11 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm totally on board with aesthetic. I only mentioned the efficiency in case you were numbers focused. My vaults are terrible on efficiency but way more fun to me than a clustered perfect efficiency layout. I put bars by diners because it makes sense. Game rooms next to barracks. Gardens under diners. One vault had storage on the very bottom level of the mountain even though my other rooms barely reached halfway (spent a fortune in elevators); that's where I held prisoners and top-secret supplies. ;)  And you don't need all nukas to keep the populace fed. I have a 150+ vault that is more than plenty fed/watered using 1 diner, 1 garden, 1 water treatment, 1 purification, and 1 nuka. I like not doubling up. Those are all three-sized, upgraded, and perfectly staffed (10/10 +3-5 gear in primary/luck)."
foshelter,3cy12m,akselmonrose,2,Sun Jul 12 04:48:27 2015 UTC,"I started one vault by destroying the elevator.  Touch and go for awhile, but it's now at full functionality (not at 200 yet as I stopped breeding at ~110 and am just getting dwellers from the radio station, in hopes of attracting some legendary dwellers.  No luck, so far.)  http://s23.postimg.org/neis5ywfu/IMG_0532.jpg  [edit: I think I'm going to swap those 2 storage rooms out for residences, the other storage rooms take up the right column after residences will be at 200.  Left column is all training (and the radio station) and middle column is all production, all grouped by attribute.]"
foshelter,3cy12m,amateur_simian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:21:41 2015 UTC,could you share how to do it? I can't seem to do it with a new vault. Everytime I do that it says it's connected to 2 rooms
foshelter,3cy12m,travelphotomoto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:27:52 2015 UTC,"The only real rule is that you can't isolate any part of the vault from the surface.  Deleting the only room connected to the entrance would isolate all other rooms… so you'll need to have destroyed all other rooms.  The real tricky part is that means you're destroying all living quarters, which means that you can't have any dwellers in your vault (even if they're in the wastelands).  So you need to save up enough money to build everything before your first branching (unless you want to do it all over again), and also residences.  You'll also want to save up some ""Waiting"" dwellers, who can come in the vault after you've rebuilt it.  So for my vault I saved up enough cash to build that first floor of 3x power reactor, 2x residence, 4x elevators and then a dinner and water treatment that were later replaced.  I had something like 7 dwellers waiting outside.  Then I sent all my dwellers to the wastelands to die, and then chose to dismiss them rather than revive them.  Then you have 0 dwellers, and can destroy all the existing rooms, build up your new rooms, and then let everyone waiting in line in the new vault.  Be really careful in that first run of rooms though, as you can't replace anything before your first elevator repeating the above process."
foshelter,3cy12m,HabeQuiddum,2,Sun Jul 12 22:35:25 2015 UTC,I did that right off the bat.

foshelter,3cwzx9,Brazzled,2,Sat Jul 11 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"It's technically more efficient, but you lose out on utilizing that one block space, having more energy capacity, having better ""burst"" energy gain if you check in only for short periods and such."
foshelter,3cwzx9,faikwansuen,2,Sat Jul 11 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"The burst difference is pretty slim though. Three doubles get you 99 while two triples gets you 100 (1.01% difference) which is easily made up if you play for more than a few minutes, as doubles produce much more quickly than triples.  Bottom line: go with double power rooms. If you're not down with doubles, singles are better than triples.   For some reason, Bethesda decided to make some rooms worse as triples."
foshelter,3cwzx9,PhoecesBrown,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:07:29 2015 UTC,"Here's some guidelines for room efficiency   (Note: these numbers reflect fully upgraded rooms. If your curious about other levels, I can provide some info about that)  Rooms that are most efficient in triples   Food Water Nuka Cola Training Rooms   Rooms that work best in doubles   Power Med Rooms   Rooms where size does not matter   Storage   Needs testing   Radio Room"
foshelter,3cwzx9,PhoecesBrown,2,Sat Jul 11 15:54:12 2015 UTC,Why are med and power best in doubles?
foshelter,3cwzx9,iceberg_sweats,2,Sat Jul 11 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"They generate more power/meds per 60 minute per size. So three doubles produce more than two triples in the long run.  The trade off is that you have to collect more frequently, but it's not really close in total production (about 38% more)  (Triple Power rooms when fully upgradedproduce 39ish per Strength per hour, whereas Double produce 54ish per Strength per hour.)  So, essentially, using triples costs more, is less versatile and produces less overall once fully upgraded. Would not recommend.  All of the above applies to meds as well, but they're not that important unless you love exploring the wastes."

foshelter,3cx7oe,Osama-bin-sexy,3,Sat Jul 11 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the general consensus is that Luck only plays a smaller part in finding legendary or rare items, and instead affects how much Caps you find. Perception is the stat for finding good items, Strength affects how much bonus weapon damage you have, and other stats are used as well."
foshelter,3cx7oe,faikwansuen,5,Sat Jul 11 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"It's really tough to say. I've been running explorers out constantly, but the lack of backlog makes it difficult to tell which stat affects what.  Luck definitely increases cap totals.  Agility seems to increases success against fast enemies, dodging attacks  I'm guessing intelligence helps with healing events (injured traveller on the path)  Charisma helps with encountering other explorers (maybe?)  Endurance definitely reduces radiation damage and enemy damage (probably?)  Perception helps with successfully opening locks/entering buildings  Strength definitely helps with defeating enemies  Level increases HP  Is there a sheet where we can report our findings? Could definitely crowd-source this info"
foshelter,3cx7oe,PhoecesBrown,4,Sat Jul 11 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"I always was assuming other stats like Agility, Charisma and Int were checked to see if an explorer would ""pass"" that event. Whether it be unlock a fridge, jump across the gap, heal the slave and get rewarded or something."
foshelter,3cx7oe,faikwansuen,3,Sat Jul 11 17:47:38 2015 UTC,You can check out this sheet which has all sorts of useful data for the game. Including events that give loot and the possible special stat that might be required for it.
foshelter,3cx7oe,Skittle_Juice,2,Sat Jul 11 17:48:56 2015 UTC,Damn! You're probably right! But idk I've seen slot of ppl posting on this sub saying they found insane stuff by increasing their luck. I've found some good stuff in the waste but never anything legendary.
foshelter,3cx7oe,FQQLISH,2,Sat Jul 11 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure Strength also affects how much damage you take. Had one guy out in a Sheriff's Duster (P +2  E + 5), but his Strength was like a 3 so he didnt even get close to the 60 hour mark before he burned through all his stimpaks and i had to bring him back. He was just taking too much damage."
foshelter,3cx7oe,faikwansuen,2,Sun Jul 12 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that it gave you a set damage boost to your weapon and allowed you to defeat enemies easier, hence lessening the damage you took.  But really, no one can confirm anything and I'm fucking clueless."
foshelter,3cx7oe,FQQLISH,2,Sun Jul 12 00:24:40 2015 UTC,"Ya I'm going off what I'm reading here and there as well.  From what I gather the most important stats for sending someone out to the wasteland is S, P, and E. Maybe L as well, but if it only affects caps then I don't care about that..but no confirmation on anything so who knows."

I even told them I've tried everything short of uninstalling/reinstalling just because I don't want to lose my vault data.  Then, in true tier-1 tech support fashion, I got an email telling me they released a patch this morning to fix my issue!  You know. The one I already told them I installed.

Of course they were having the same problem, but it's clearly something only another patch will fix, so I emailed ""Arthur"" back telling him he was doing a terrible job, to which a ""Greg"" replied that I should turn my iPad off for 5 minutes and try again.

I think if you don't currently have an item in your inventory somewhere, it will not show up as discovered, post-update - even if you'd discovered it prior to the update.   Before the update, I had 81/90 outfits discovered. I had to sell off some of the common outfits in their entirety to make room for a returning dweller. Post-update, I had 73/90. Many of the holes appear to be common outfits - probably the ones I sold off. For example, Wasteland Gear just appeared as a ""New"" item after it came out of a lunchbox.   This may just apply to the outfits. I also sold off any weapon with damage lower than 7, and I doubt any of my dwellers are wielding the Rusty BB Gun."

It took about 15 minutes but eventually loaded. (It appeared to be frozen. The load animations and hint messages had completely stopped.)  Hopefully there was some kind of a conversion going on in the background, because I don't want to wait 15 minutes every time I go to load this vault.  I'll try loading my 53 Dweller vault now.    By comparison, my 117 Dweller vault loaded in the normal amount of time. No more than a couple of minutes at the most.

Secondly a bit of explanation. I installed the update today and logged back in to find every dweller I'd assigned to an Athletics Centre all gathered in the original Athletics Centre I'd built (I've got multiple one room training rooms dotted around my shelter).  When I try to assign the dwellers back to the now empty Athletics Centres they just head straight back to that original one and stand around like they're on a coffee break, however the dweller list says they're in an Athletics Centre.  The funniest bit is if I assign them to a different room then they just float through the floors to that room, like the lady in red is doing in the screenshot.  So...yeah. Interesting bug. Anyone else experiencing this? How do I send in a bug report to Bethesda?  I'm going to try demolishing the other Athletics Centres and rebuilding them to see if that makes a difference. So far it's only the Athletics Centre that's been affected, all the other training rooms are working fine."

I have a group of 7 all 10s rolling out soon with all legendary armors; I will let you know if one makes it beyond 100 hrs. I would think itll be more difficult now that they fixed the 50/50 glitch too. Perhaps fixing the 50/50 was their way of also correcting the 100 item glitch. Since a level 50 with max stats will only make about 3.5-4 days max with 25 Stim packs.

Suffice to say I have a fair amount of rooms.  v1.03 has just sped up the game immensely. Animations are smooth and panning around, selecting rooms no longer takes 1-3 seconds.

No radiation dmg at all! I'm thinking of using Official suits for them, cos its biggest luck boost I have. 13 luck should help me get weapons, right?"
foshelter,3ctb11,thisnameisnot,14,Fri Jul 10 16:33:31 2015 UTC,Of course they fixed the glitch.  Lunch boxes are the way they make money on the game so it was probably their highest priority to fix that issue.
foshelter,3ctb11,anillop,3,Fri Jul 10 18:09:14 2015 UTC,I'm just surprised there wasn't a hotfix like a week ago just to patch that.
foshelter,3ctb11,SystemThreat,4,Fri Jul 10 20:52:36 2015 UTC,I honestly think the popularity of the game caught them off guard and they didn't have a lot of resources assigned to it.
foshelter,3ctb11,anillop,3,Fri Jul 10 21:02:16 2015 UTC,Totally agree they didn't have a lot of resources assigned to it pre launch but I think that was the plan.  They pushed it out at E3 to get the cash influx to finish anything they needed.  Its a safer bet.  They were hoping it would be popular but they probably made the smallest financial commitment they could in case it wasn't.  I'm just really blown away at the performance increase and my hypothesis is that money is there now that wasn't before.
foshelter,3ctb11,yakatuus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:11:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunatelly for them, it takes a few days to push an update in the App Store. Even weeks some time.

I stopped birthing at 65 dwellers, and my radio has brought in 100 common dwellers.   If there is a chance (unlikely that there is) then it is so low with respect to cycle time and max dweller count. I would think they could make the chance much much smaller but add better probability (a luck roll perhaps) to bring in high quality and people like me would be happy."

foshelter,3ctxe4,DrD0ak,4,Fri Jul 10 19:24:11 2015 UTC,Especially since it holds to logic that legendary/rare dwellers would be far more likely to be surviving in the waste. They could also add a Charisma check for explorers to send rare/legendary people they meet back to your vault.  I think they should reduce the chance of calling dwellers in with the radio but jack up the percentage of rare/legendary and reduce or eliminate chance of a common.

foshelter,3csci9,MrBleah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"When a new dweller enters my vault, it starts a promotion cascade.

New dweller replaces trainee in the S/E training room.    I just don't see a reason to try to power level a 1 when I have perfectly good 15-20s in my rooms who already have high skill in necessary stats.  The other benefit to this method is you're always going to be able to do the ""level up x dwellers"" pretty quickly because a lot of workers will be between levels 1 and 15."

It makes the game boring as shit anyway. 90% of the thrill is training up a good runner and getting a legendary from the Nation Guard Depot. Or getting lucky on the limited lunchboxes you can actually earn.  It makes the game much more stable on my 5S with 162 dwellers.

foshelter,3cr0k7,TyranZ,6,Fri Jul 10 02:16:14 2015 UTC,"Yikes. Our priority here is to get power production under control by reducing load and adding workers, then shift dwellers over to food and water production to get those sufficient as well.    Move your highest strength dwellers into power until these are fully staffed. Make sure the dwellers are moved out of the science lab. Destroy the science lab to reduce load. If you can destroy any residences, destroy these as well to reduce load.   Staff the diners and water treatment as best you can. Highest agility workers on the diner, highest perception on the water treatment.  I see credits are tight, but if you can upgrade level of your power facilities. As they become more efficient move dwellers out of power into the diners and water treatment until you have a net positive in these again as well.   Once production is back under control you should be safe slowly building up your dwellers again. It's easy to over-extend and have things go south building too many buildings before sufficient power to cover them is in place, or popping out too many kids before food/water is up to snuff."
foshelter,3cr0k7,decrementsf,2,Fri Jul 10 03:15:04 2015 UTC,Match your dwellers highest SPECIAL stat with the corresponding room. That'll help with hapiness and production rates.

foshelter,3cr0k7,decrementsf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:05:12 2015 UTC,Water is really important because all your dwellers start taking radiation damage and getting super unhappy if your water level is low.

Recall them when things are back in order.  Remove unnecessary buildings, staff resource buildings and rush single room ones.  I would go as far as removing the triple diner; it's not necessary yet and having low A stat (I assume they're quite low) dwellers run them means slow production and inability to spam rushes (rad roaches might end up killing them, fires take too long to put out).   Also, pleasantly surprised noone told you to just quit and restart a new vault.  Those are never helpful and have such a quitter mentality."

Then once I got training good dwellers, it was just a matter of sending a bunch out to explore -- 10 +7 luck skill.  I've found that having 17 L over 10 L gives around 45% more caps during wasteland explorations.    Also, I admittingly do use the stimpak glitch when I'm not being lazy (I send the explorer to the bottom of the vault, rush until fail, and I'm insured to have the incident resolved before vault door opens.), so I end up with explorers that bring home quite a bit of bacon."

I had 40ish dwellers exploring and I couldnt even get through the list without it crashing numerous times.    I have no idea how this made it out of bug testing.  Needs an update ASAP.

foshelter,3cr588,masterzeus2,2,Fri Jul 10 03:34:13 2015 UTC,1.0.3 and everything is MUCH smoother!
foshelter,3cp9ic,redscull,4,Thu Jul 9 17:54:37 2015 UTC,I think that explorers should also have a chance to encounter wandering merchants.  The merchants would have various items and your explorer could purchase rare/legendary items with caps they have found.  This would add incentive to longer journeys; 60+ hrs. If a legendary cost say 10k caps you would need to have a dweller out for 100+ hrs to be able to buy them.  Hard code the explorer to purchase the best rarity they can afford.
foshelter,3cp9ic,DrD0ak,3,Thu Jul 9 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"But what if you actually wanted the caps, not a random rare item? I often send high luck (but otherwise mediocre) dwellers out on caps runs. Maybe this caravan is too far out to be run into except by long-running explorers (not my caps runners), but with the auto-buy approach, it's just a National Guard Depo that steals your caps.  A caravan event is a neat idea, but it either halts your explorer's progress so you can actively interact with it (also a lot of new UI for that experience). And halting progress would be counter to the explore mechanic. Or if it auto-buys, it's not really that different from any other loot event. Except you lose caps.  It could always be the case that the explorer encounters the caravan, and with sufficient charisma roll, encourages the caravan to visit the vault, represented by a little dude waiting at the entrance. You could then click that little guy to open a list much like the Collect view of returned and waiting explorers. Tap-toggle the caravan guy's items to see cost and flag for purchase. Press Purchase (in lieu of Collect) to buy all flagged items and then the caravan guy runs back into the wastes. Or press Purchase with nothing flagged to just send him away (you only get to purchase once, but he otherwise hangs around until you do, or maybe up to some time limit like 24 hours so you can't save caps forever).  That's how I'd implement the caravan, using basically existing views and mechanics."
foshelter,3cp9ic,Zoijja,2,Thu Jul 9 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea, but would progress halt if a dweller ran into a merchant when you weren't looking? I'd rather have them keep exploring."
foshelter,3cp9ic,zoidbug,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:10:07 2015 UTC,What if they encounter him and y ou shop when you check on the game again and if found when play I ng you get a notification.
foshelter,3cp9ic,yakatuus,2,Fri Jul 10 03:54:18 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea.  The twist I'd do is that I'd make it a hourly event, with probability being your Charisma (i.e. 10 Charisma would hit 10% of the time).  Caps are next to useless;  I have over 300k at this point and nothing to spend it on.  I'm literally worried about the size of that integer.  I'd use the tap toggle as it is;  then when you do encounter the Wandering Trader, you sell everything you toggled.  This would give you more to do in game, incentivize and reward monitoring your explorers, and maybe most importantly, decrease performance problems.    As a pipe dream addendum, I'd love to toggle auto sell status on every item on the already in-game listings!  You wouldn't even need to create anything more than a toggle in an already existing interface.  Auto-sell toggle and a wandering merchant in the wastes would do a lot to improve quality of life."

I might be able to run some tests with a few level 1s, I'm thinking let them get to about 50% between 1 and 2, send them back and see if their exp bar moves.  Seems really, really hard to test.  If it's like 1 XP per minute, that would sound about right.  /u/Sihplak    I think xp is earned slowly just by being out there. I had an incident where between about 5 and 15 minutes after calling one of my dwellers back whose xp bar looked full, he leveled up.   I'd really love to hear from someone who saw a line of black on their XP bar when they sent them back, only to subsequently see that black line get filled, and THEN level up.  Not one of my dwellers who died, got revived and leveled up had ANY XP remaining in their bar.

My only advice is to try send him so you aren't asleep for the fixed time events. Not knowing if a rare came from a fixed time event or regular loot event doesn't help. Try be awake and available at 2:30, 5:00, 15:00, 20:00, 30:00 and of course 60:00.  By 100 hours, we currently expect him to have 8.4 rares from Regular Loot Events.

foshelter,3clyet,Ewh1t3,10,Wed Jul 8 23:59:43 2015 UTC,The merc gear is a recolored version of the NCR Elite Ranger armor. The Wasteland gear is the ghost people's hazmat suit from Dead Money.

To cut things short, Interplay was going bankrupt, a lot of employees of Black Isle left to found Obsidian and Van Buren was cancelled.

They seem organized, they have ranks and stay/attack in groups. Rumor has it, they take entire vaults and turn them into more super mutants...that is if they survive. So far, my troopers have been able to kill most of the abominations that aren't in packs while on patrol. God I hope they don't find the vault...  (TL;DR: I would like super mutants, have them rank up, maybe start with boards/rebar clubs and evolve by bringing rocket launchers and mini guns. BUT instead of resources, and they get far enough into the vault (Let's say, fourth or third room). They'll take a vault dweller each(If they can) And you'll have to kill them before they get out the door. If they die, the vault dweller is saved and not hurt. If they do??? We'll let's just say, when they come back...You might recognize a certain torn vault suit on one or two of them.(Of course armor and weapon would most likely be dropped)."

foshelter,3ck14y,yakatuus,3,Wed Jul 8 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"This is hugely helpful, so I wanted to contribute some information I've gathered.  The Eternal Quest: I currently have Jericho out in the wastes for approximately 82 days (accomplished by manually adjusting the time/date on my phone many times over).  All of his SPECIAL stats are maxed out, he is wearing a Wrestler's Outfit (+2S, +2E, +1L), using a Vengeance (dmg 21-26) and was equipped with 25 stimpaks. He can survive for about 104 hours with those provisions, after which I repeated a cycle of him dying, being revived, surviving for another ~7 hours, and repeat.  However, around 18 days in, he stopped encountering enemies/mobs, and since his endurance level allows him to avoid radiation damage (he actually takes negative damage), he can survive indefinitely and it is much easier for me to track the loot he ""receives"" (he doesn't actually keep any of it since he hit the 100 item limit long ago and I haven't figured out a way for him to shed the crappy items he accumulated early on).  Here are some thoughts I have at this point:   I believe I've seen a screencap of someone exploring for 19 days with about 70 stimpaks left (through hacking I assume) and still encountering enemies, but it seems as though the enemy generation algorithm in the non-hacked game may stop sending even Super Mutant Behemoths and Overlords after about 18 days. My data is consistent with your assumption on the chance of finding rare items in the hourly regular loot event.  Starting at 20 days (28,800 minutes, which should yield an 80% chance of rare loot) surveyed the loot received for each 10-hour period until I hit 25 days (which should yield a 100% chance of rare).  In those periods I only received rare and common items (no legendary, more on that later) at rates of 70%, 90%, 100%, 90%, 90%, 80%, 100%, 90%, 90%, 100%, 100%, and 100%.  After 25 days, I have only found rare items. As mentioned above, I have not received any legendary items after I started tracking all loot at 20 days in.  I also do not have any legendary loot in the 100 items he is carrying.  I can think of three possible reasons for this: 1. legendary items cannot be obtained from the hourly regular loot events (the negative time glitch suggests this is not the case), 2. only one legendary item can be obtained per exploration, and Jericho obtained it sometime between when he hit the 100 item limit and day 20, or 3. there is a modifier in the legendary item algorithm that prevents you from receiving one after a certain number of minutes have elapsed (perhaps to protect against journeys like mine, though it would be a little strange, but not implausible, to do this and not do the same with rare items).  My best guess is explanation #2. I have not seen any fixed time events in the late stages of his quest, but I only checked every hour between 20 days and 25 days and have only seen one out of every seven days since (I'm skipping in 7 day increments so I can pick up lunchboxes that will actually give legendary items during this odyssey).  I plan to do the next 10 days in daily skips so I can track every event, but I suspect I will not see any new fixed time events at this point.   I am thinking of continuing this journey until it hits 250 days (to see if any magic happens when I cross the minute threshold that should lead to 100% legendary items by your formula).  Let me know if there is any data I can gather for people before heading back.  After this quest is done I will be sending him back out for a shorter (hopefully less than 20 days) journey where I see whether you can get a legendary item even after the 100 item cap is reached if your dweller automatically equips that item (i.e. it is better than the weapon or outfit they currently have)."
foshelter,3ck14y,Shaxinater,2,Fri Jul 10 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"Fantastic post, very interesting.  I'm actually a little amazed, I drew the 36,000 denominator from a sample of just two dwellers running out to 4 days. Each dweller was sampled once every 24 hours. That's a total of 8 dots on an x-y axis to draw a line with. Technically each dot was itself an average of 24 samples that day, but still, the fact it looks like remotely accurate is stunning.  The post is little crushing too, I'd have hoped you were swimming in legendaries by 25 days. Indeed if the formula was accurate, we'd expect you to have 30.05 by now. If it wern't for the negative time glitch, I'd discard the idea of legendaries from the hourly loot event altogether.   The options you pose do sound logical. The idea of a maximum of 1 legendary per expedition strikes me as fair and simple to code. It's the kind of safety valve a programmer might put in to prevent unforseen stat boosting/glitching from watering down the value of a legendary.  Additionally, the chance for rare may be rolled before legendary, or perhaps they're rolled simultaneously. In either case rare would squeeze out legendary. But both options seem daft to program in.  Thank you for running out there and testing this with the time glitch, it's data I never could have obtained.   My fear is that the 100 item maximum isn't a glitch but intended. That would give a <=40 hour time limit to proc a legendary after the 60:00 event IFF legendaries can be awarded at all from the hourly event.  I wouldn't put too much weight in the 360,000 number for legendaries. Whilst I drew a line with 8 dots for rare,  I have zero dots for legendary. That was as simple as ""10 times as rarer than rare"" felt like a round number developers might program in.   I'll be interested to see if the 100 item cap is removed come patch. If not, it's going to be hard to argue staying past the 60:00 event."

But at higher levels, my lvl50 guys will fail/succeed against the same mob. Seems there is some chance at play.   My guess is that every mob has a stat test that if you make it, you have a CHANCE at beating it, but you can still fail.

foshelter,3cjpt2,DrD0ak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"That's really strange. I stopped my dwellers from having children for the most part since even though most were born with a stat at 3 and the rest at 1's and 2's it's still much, much quicker to train a dweller from the wastelands to a 3 than it is to wait for a child to grow up. Also I didn't want to keep track of who was related to who anymore. So even though you weren't lucky in that regard you probably saved some time if you get a lot of people over the radio (if that's what you're aiming for)."
foshelter,3cjpt2,atomic_cake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:58:13 2015 UTC,It seems that the child will have a 3 in whatever the parents are best at. Max Stat dwellers are too balanced.  Two dwellers with 5+ in the same Stat with 1/2 in others seem to always give me a child with 3 in that Stat.

foshelter,3clc7f,Boondoge,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"Nope. It just says compatible with ipad, ipod, etc.. optimized for (specific model numbers)"
foshelter,3clc7f,CrossedZebra,3,Wed Jul 8 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"lonecnislupus is right, read the first line of the Description - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fallout-shelter/id991153141?mt=8  It's the RAM that seems to be the big issue atm with older devices, the game requires at least 1GB of RAM to run properly especially as your vault size increases. Older devices than the ones in the requirement will have only 512 MB and under of RAM."

foshelter,3clc7f,CrossedZebra,2,Thu Jul 9 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"Compatibility and requirement are different things. Some programs say compatible with x86 processors, doesn't mean you should try and install Windows 10 on a 1st gen pentium or pentium II for example.  Plus the first line describing the app is literally -   ""Fallout Shelter requires at least an iPhone 5, iPad 3, or iPad mini 2."" So it's fairly clear IMHO.  But fair point, maybe they should list the requirements as well down the sidebar near compatibility info. I don't think it's necessary but more clarity never hurts and it will be less confusing for some people as you say."

foshelter,3ckphr,sensibletunic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:59 2015 UTC,Higher level dwellers have more HP. High level Endurance will keep them alive longer as well. Equip gear that boosts endurance.
foshelter,3ckphr,slimjim72384,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:52:01 2015 UTC,It also helps if the other special stats are high since they help the dweller win encounters with enemies. Which causes them to take less damage thus they can stay out longer.
foshelter,3ckphr,Skittle_Juice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people discount Strength for whatever reason in this sub.  What happens is that explorers generally hit a wall of enemies.  Basically Centaurs, Mirelurk Hunters and above require a good weapon and good Strength.  Your journey only lasts until you run into the group of mobs that you can't kill.  You hit the wall, your explorer starts dropping health and churning stimpacks.  I really notice it when my explorer unequips his/her Battle Armor and puts on their new crappy +5 outfit.  They stop being able to kill the enemies they were fighting, burn through their stimpacks and die.  Remember, we're all limited to 25 stimpacks per explorer.  Once you get to 42+ or so, your explorers level slower so you don't get that free health from leveling.  Once your explorers hit 50, you actually see a drop off in how long they can stay out because they lose those free heals."
foshelter,3ckphr,yakatuus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:50:29 2015 UTC,Well you can get more than 25 stimpacks/radaway easy enough if you're okay with using the glitch.

foshelter,3ckphr,yakatuus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:20:04 2015 UTC,I don't even know what the negative time bug is. The way I see it is doing something like the lunchbox exploit is blatantly cheating. But getting past a weak 25 stimpack cap when I have over 200 is understandable. Especially when more stimpacks doesn't even guarantee you'll even get decent loot.

This is equivalent to 70 food/water per minute.  A lot of ugly math boils down to you really only need three Nuka Cola plants.  I did four to cycle/level newbies faster; plus my playstyle is log in, tap everything, log out.  Power is an entirely other story.  We have a ton of unanswered power questions because consumption is hard to gauge.  I have five regular power plants and two nukes.  One nuclear is all that's needed, maybe not even then.  I really don't expect to expand my power consumption much more in the future, maybe a few new training rooms.    Basically once my layout is finalized, I will use trial and error to try to cut to peak efficiency.  My setup is probably overkill, but I think six total power plants is right around the cutoff.  Two Nuka Cola plants is too few, three might be just about cutting it."

You're welcome to look at the data yourself.  Feel free to copy it into a new spreadsheet and manipulate it.  Anything with a ""Time Out"" 60 or greater had a chance at the National Guard Depot.

You have to have a dweller in the wasteland for 60 hours before they encounter an event that might give them a legendary item.

It's likely legendary does the same but is at least 10 times rarer.  I believe someone will get a legendary reward from the hourly event. Just waiting on someone to get the screen shot.

foshelter,3cgf5k,Kammon,3,Tue Jul 7 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"I suspect it's something in the way the hourly loot event is randomly assigned within the hour combined with how duration is calculated and the probability of the loot event being legendary:  Probability of legendary = Duration (mins) / 360,000   Where duration is calculated in game by taking your phone's time:  Duration = Current Time - Expedition start time   Finally, the hourly loot event is randomly assigned a point of occurring within the hour:  Hourly Loot Event Time = Rand (0-59)   I beleive these three different functions trip up when the hourly loot event is randomly and mistakenly able to asign a time that occured in the past. The duration of the mission is then calculated, which is negative for that event. The negative duration spits out negative probability, which throws errors, in this case, resulting in 100% probability of rolling legendary.   Some set of functions like this would explain why playing with phone time won't generate the error and that it seems to happen randomly."

The glitch that allows you to give double stim packs and radaways to explorers occurs when you send an explorer out during an event which ends before the explorer gets to the vault door.

foshelter,3cfycg,Grei-man,10,Tue Jul 7 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest ""end game"" issue I have is that the game scales really badly. Honestly it's horribly optimized since it really doesn't deal with large data. It can barely handle a 100 dweller list, and 200 is horrible. As an iOS developer I can say that they need a good profiling pass with instruments and/or some iOS development classes.   Not being rude here, but it's trivial to handle hundreds of items in a list. Even thousands or tens of thousands isn't hard. iOS has awesome technologies available for that."

In fact it's especially surprising how bad it is considering the entirety of the dataset in a 200 person vault probably could fit in-memory (in fact we had a more naive implementation that did just that that worked perfectly fine with 3-4k entries and in fact worked with 35k entries but with a significant one time loading time).  Add to this that it doesn't work on lower memory devices at all.  Fallout Shelters start having noticeable performance degradation with only 30-50 people which just shouldn't happen.  The rendering of the vault is great. Nice and smooth, cool 3D and so on. It's the handing of dweller lists specifically which is oddly sluggish.   This being their first mobile game isn't an excuse. The tools for profiling for iOS is by far the best I've personally used.   It wouldn't surprise me if they used a non-native framework for development of the game to make cross platform with Android ""easy"". That's probably the easiest way of making a sub-performing product.   Still even such a framework should have zero issues dealing with 200 entities."

foshelter,3cfycg,InedibleFood,2,Wed Jul 8 04:14:33 2015 UTC,I think they did PRETTY bad considering they're an AAA game studio and should be attract at least a couple good iOS devs.  Not being able to sort and scroll a 200 item list is just embarrassing. So is crashing just trying to load a 200 person vault from the start screen. (iPhone 6 here.)

foshelter,3cgard,charlie1337,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:19:13 2015 UTC,Believe he's talking about the exploit where a dweller on his way out of the vault headed to the wasteland will come back to the original room if an incident occurs and is completed. If they do come back in they keep their stims and rads and can be sent out again with another set of stims/rads.
foshelter,3cgard,TunderProsum,2,Wed Jul 8 15:58:32 2015 UTC,Leveling up resets dweller health to 100%  .  Send them into the waste with 25 stims and forget about them. The stims will be enough to get them to a point that the xp and healing rewarded from killing stuff far outweighs the damage and it becomes self sustaining to a point.  They'll level from 1 to 40 in one go with zero rushing or messing about.

Later in the game, when you already have 100+ dwellers, it actually gets pretty annoying to have to constantly collect the new low SPECIAL dwellers, then send them out to die. Happiness isn't that hard to manage, I'm at 94% with 130 dwellers and only one radio station. The only ones that aren't at 100% are the guys that I've just had shuffling between SPECIAL rooms for days.

foshelter,3cfaa1,Stoogenuge,2,Tue Jul 7 13:38:40 2015 UTC,I'm new to the game but I read that Strength impacts your attack. It's generally a good idea to have the Power plant plant at the first/second level of your fault so your high-Strength workers can attack and defend first.

foshelter,3ccc99,drumther,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, the game has many memory leaks issues (meaning doing the same thing a few times will start eating memory and not freeing up any). Unfortunatelly the only way around this, as a user, is to do what your repetitive thing (as in move your dwellers around to whatever you need to), and then close and restart the app when you're done moving them."

foshelter,3ce2ay,Maffs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"Several questions;  How many people do you have alive right now?  Are you in the green in all of your resources?  How many people do you have exploring right now?  How many rooms do you have?  Your order for resources is Power, Water, Food in that order;   The other rooms start shutting down without power, if this is not in the green, then you need to get this working to capacity ASAP and have reserves. If you need to, destroy buildings to get the other producing buildings into the green. Water - If you don't have this your people will take radiation and slowly lose their health making it easier for radroaches to invade, or raiders. Food, the least important actually, but still important.    A couple comments, I never equiped all of my people with armor and guns, instead only whatever is appropriate for that room, and normally the +3s, sometimes the +2s for that room only.   It's not always wise to upgrade your buildings to level 3, as that increases the strength of the radroaches invading, so keep that in mind.   It's ok to have to destroy some buildings to get power back.   The biggest problem I see people fall for is the ""pregency explosion"", where there are a bunch of unproductive kids who come around and suck all your resources, but it doesn't appear that you fell for that at 20 people but in the future don't do that.   So respond to me and i'll walk you through it. I'm sitting at 190 people with like 12 waiting to get in."
foshelter,3ce2ay,DaTaco,3,Tue Jul 7 05:08:49 2015 UTC,"Just another tip for keeping power in the green: build more generators. I have one generator with all 13-14S people, and one empty 3bay gen and an empty 3bay reactor, and am constantly full. Just needed to build the empties to keep the line down."
foshelter,3ce2ay,shadowman3001,2,Tue Jul 7 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is more about how often you play, if you play a lot, then having one building full makes more sense, but if you log in, get your resource then log out, it actually makes more sense to have more buildings (with less people), so you can collect a ""full buildings"" worth from every person and building.   So it very much depends on ""how"" you play, if that makes sense but great tip!"
foshelter,3ce2ay,DaTaco,2,Tue Jul 7 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"True. Also a heads up, even if you quit to home screen and kill the app, the resource depletion keeps running for some amount of time (seems like about two minutes)."
foshelter,3ce2ay,shadowman3001,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend sending out a couple people and coming off game, then coming on just to return them and come off. If you have a job or something you can do this during sleep/wake up. This brings in a lot of items and reward and the begining. Then equip 2-4-6 people with your best weapons and put them in a room just after the vault door, they should be killed almost instantly with raiders and that stops deaths/supplies.  Rush when you can, it adds credits. A failure is still rewarding in that sometimes you get quests for it, but you also get EXP, so its worth it if you can handle it, best room is probably medbay as I seems to affect it (my medbay put out fires in 2-3 seconds) and you get medkits to heal people up.  This helped my gf who now has around 50, i'd recommend building up some good resources and at least equipping everyone in appropriate armour and a good weapon before going higher than 50 as it will begin to lag, a lot, and be very difficult to ""act quick"" to anything so you have to rely on them to handle it themselves."

foshelter,3cdjas,robotsteak,2,Tue Jul 7 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"I did this for my first vault but on my 2nd I decided to put the 2nd elevator between my 3x and 2x on the right. It's basically the same but allows for a little faster maneuvering between the middle rooms as dwellers on the far left or right of a room usually have shorter distances to travel to get to any elevator. I don't think it has made a huge difference from putting the elevator all the way on the right, but it is another option. Sorry no pic.  Edited to add: One other note (that should perhaps be its own thread), but if you space out your elevator building correctly, you can get 2 for the price of one. If you build an elevator that is 'freestanding', which means that it's not attached to an elevator above it, you will get an elevator at the level you select and one will be created below it. I believe the 'additional' elevator is free in regards to caps, but I think it does count toward your count of elevators in regards to how much the next elevator would cost. Sorry, no pic/vid of this in action either. Let me know if you want a more detailed description of what I'm talking about. Ultimately, the only gain is caps, but it can add up a bit."

foshelter,3caxfw,Kammon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:59:47 2015 UTC,yeah i know. the glitch happens when you upgrade or delete the room she got pregnant in.  She wants to have the baby in that same room.  I got around it by making a room exactly like the one she got pregnant in and it worked for me.
foshelter,3caxfw,ZeusThunder369,3,Mon Jul 6 21:56:01 2015 UTC,I'd like it if it remembered that I don't want to receive notifications. At this point it turns itself back on every time I start the game and I have to manually turn it off.

I'm at 144 dwellers and I just experienced a crash so bad I had to reboot my phone for the game to even boot to the main menu.  Bugfixes like the invincible rad-roach, perma-pregnant women, and raider-explorer game-erasing bug would be great too.  And I wouldn't complain if maybe they tweaked the training times to not take an eternity."

foshelter,3caxfw,gniknosmirceht,3,Mon Jul 6 17:12:27 2015 UTC,Same for me. It lags like hell at ~150 though
foshelter,3caxfw,iamaretpally,4,Mon Jul 6 17:13:08 2015 UTC,I didn't know there was a dweller limit until I reached it. HOW DO I GET RID OF ALL THE PREGO WOMEN NOW?!
foshelter,3caxfw,Kammon,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"As much as I enjoy playing my legit vault over my Lunchbox exploit vault as I feel I've accomplished more through sheer work, why exactly does that need to be patched? It's something very easy to avoid doing, so you're only going to wind up with it if you want to do it, and you can only get legendary people from Lunchboxes AFAIK. Moreover, they're too rare in the vanilla game and Bethesda charges a hefty premium for the packs.  Let people play the game how they choose. Fixing that only benefits Bethesda."
foshelter,3caxfw,iamaretpally,4,Mon Jul 6 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"I think Bethesda has a right to make money off of the gave development. If everyone used the lunchbox exploit, no one would spend any money on the game, and Bethesda would have no reason to further develop it.  I want new features and more stuff; I want the game to grow. To think that Bethesda should just do this for free and take a loss on it out of the goodness of their heart is silly."
foshelter,3caxfw,Lostxprophit,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"well, yeah. we want them to see benefit. Bethesda is one of the very few developers who haven't fucked over their users. i want them to not be fucked over by us."
foshelter,3caxfw,alwilfysavy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"I don't want to sound nasty or anything, but are you serious? I can't tell if you're trolling or not.  Why would they want to benefit themselves? What a joke, its not like they are in this for the money, right? I was under the impression that they were a non profit organization just there to help us out with some cool games.   Don't be foolish, you want video game companies to succeed and make bigger and better things for the future.   As for being too rare in the vanilla game, you get plenty of lunch boxes if you actually play the game. Legendary followers are by no means necessary and the fact that the entire game can be played and enjoyable without the benefit of lunch boxes, or at least having to pay for them, is great. The micro transactions in this game are some of the better ones, although maybe the pricing for lunch boxes are a little steep, its not that big of a deal."
foshelter,3caxfw,alwilfysavy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like you've misread my reply. The post title asks what is at the top of your wishlist for fixes. I never said Bethesda wouldn't want to fix it. I was questioning why an end user would want it fixed as it only occurs if you choose to use it. Obviously it is in Bethesda's best interest to patch it out, but speaking from personal experience, they're already making money hand over fist on the Lunchboxes even with the exploit. I've spent $50 on them so far for my normal vaults. And the pricing and rarity is a concern for a lot of people. Saying that it's not doesn't make it so. A large part of the fun of this game is collecting all the things. Restricting a large part of that behind a paywall would be more understandable if they paywall was smaller or the chance to earn boxes through consistent play was higher.  Nowhere did I say I expected Bethesda to be non-profit or work for free. There's no need to be hostile."
foshelter,3caxfw,alwilfysavy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:31:11 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. Wasn't trying to be hostile, just sarcastic. Sometimes they can be construed as the same thing, but don't do that in this instance, not my intentions I assure you.  You did ask 'why exactly does it need to be patched' and the short answer is because for some people it entirely negates the reason to buy lunch boxes to begin with, thereby costing Bethesda potential profits. This is bad for everybody involved. Also the only legendaries limited to lunch boxes are dwellers, outfits and weapons can be found in the wastes.   I haven't done the lunch box glitch personally, it feels too cheaty and when I do things in games that makes it feel that way I get bored, but I can see why people would. There are A LOT of things to collect, but I feel like it sort of adds to the longevity of the game. The price of boxes is pretty significant and I've gotten some myself (just because I wanted to support the game, not because I wanted anything in particular from the box) but I think that taking out the exploit and making legendary dwellers available from the radio shack, albeit with a very low chance, would make the game more fun and interesting for everybody.   As a side note, I've gotten a rare dweller from the radio shack before, not sure if people are still wondering if its possible or not. No pictures, because I am too lazy and it was a long time ago, so take it as you will."

foshelter,3caxfw,HabeQuiddum,2,Mon Jul 6 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"Luckily I haven't run into any glitches so far but my only real complaint is the lack of rare loot found in the wasteland. I send 2-3 maxed out in luck and perception dwellers and come back with bb guns, rusty 10mm, and the like. Recently I had bought some lunchboxes because of the sale and to help support Bethesda; I noticed how easy it was to get good guns. I got about 6 rare weapons, many rare outfits, and 2 legendary guns, just 30 lunchboxes (bought 15 but it got duplicated with the glitch). Not to mention the multiple legendary dwellers with their rare/legendary weapons. Yet, when I put the effort and time into training and maxing stats for my dwellers, and then waiting days for them to explore and days for them to get back, they have nothing worth that time and effort. The mechanic doesn't seem to incentivize its usage unless you are in the early stages of your vault and you're desperate for it."
foshelter,3caxfw,SunnyChow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"You get a lot of rares if you send dwellers out in the wilderness for long periods of time.  Rares are the mid-range items just to be clear.  You do not get a lot of legendary items.  These are the super-rare high end items.  There are a few times during the wasteland runs that you have a chance to get legendary items, but you have to get them up to 60 hours in the wasteland IIRC before you get your first shot at one and the chance is around 1 in 10 from what people have deduced.  One of the guys on here has detailed the wasteland runs pretty well.  https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/3bn3s6/legendary_success_rate_1_in_10_from_national/"

Yea i started sending a lot more high-level dwellers with perception and luck at 10, for at least a day or so and i am getting a few more rares than originally stated. I still think Bethesda needs to spice that mechanic up a little more though."
foshelter,3caxfw,firebird357,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"Apparently there is an extremely small chance to get legendary items earlier that increases as time goes on, so I was wrong to say that you need to get to 60 hours."
foshelter,3caxfw,firebird357,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:27:03 2015 UTC,Is it exponential? Like does it increase by 5 or 10% each day--along with perception/luck maxed?
foshelter,3caxfw,Mandoade,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's speculation, but since some people have found legendaries randomly early there seems to be some base chance to find them, though very low and the theory is that it goes up slowly over time since at 60 hours people have observed a 1:10 chance of finding one."

foshelter,3caxfw,sarasmirks,2,Tue Jul 7 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"My thing is that if the game exits and you have to go back in it seems to assign a fixed penalty to resources for going back into the vault.  So, if I stop playing and the game exits and I go back in after five minutes I'll end up taking some fixed percentage penalty to resources.  If this happens say three times suddenly I'm in the red for resources even though I have only been playing for 30 minutes off and on.  Am I wrong about how this is working?"
foshelter,3caxfw,two2teps,2,Mon Jul 6 14:10:12 2015 UTC,I play of and on like that all the time and I've never been in the red.
foshelter,3caxfw,Jyiiga,2,Mon Jul 6 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Does your game restart though?  IE, if you exit and then go back in does it go back to the title screen?

foshelter,3caxfw,Archijslv,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:17:36 2015 UTC,I always log out first. I never let it go to sleep while I'm playing. I think that might be your problem.
foshelter,3caxfw,elizabethcb,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem is that I would be forced to log out and then back in multiple times and then you, I think, get the same effect.  It pushes a resource penalty on you."
foshelter,3caxfw,Shaxinater,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:30:21 2015 UTC,I know the game take resources for a small amount of time after you logout but only for a few minutes. A percentage cut?

foshelter,3caxfw,Shaxinater,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:36:45 2015 UTC,It depends on your capacity too. I used to be BARELY in the red every time I closed a game. I increased my resource capacity and it never happened again.
foshelter,3caxfw,HellsNels,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"FYI, the vault I'm talking about has a 5900 power capacity.  So, losing 20% of that bar is quite a bit of power.  Granted, it's quite a large vault though."

Every tick on the power scale for me uses around 18-19 power.  The only reason I have that much capacity though is because the top level Super Reactor gives you 1200 versus the top level Power Plant gives you 300 and I have three Reactors."

I had to send him again a second time after the raiders were dead as he'd returned to his room.  It seems a lot like the double stimpacks exploit except not caused by an intentionally failed rush.  Looks like the negative timestamp is because the timer starts from the first time you tried to send your explorer out.  I too found  legendary from a metal box at -minutes timestamp.

foshelter,3cczq4,JoshFromNZ,2,Mon Jul 6 23:15:30 2015 UTC,"The game is initially in a tutorial mode. The idea is to not exit the tutorial mode.    Do not claim the lunchbox for Equip 1 Dweller with an Outfit. Alternatively, this objective can be expressed as Equip 1 Dweller with a weapon. In the latter case, do not claim the 25 caps. You will receive one objective or the other.    You will also receive the objective, Sell 1 Weapon or Outfit. Do not claim the 25 caps for the completion of this objective.    That will leave you with one remaining objective slot. Complete these objectives and claim your prize. The objective will continually cycle between Level up 1 Dweller, Collect 50 Water, and Collect 50 Food.    Once you've claimed the prize for either of the of the two above objectives, you cannot use this exploit.    If at the beginning, you get an objective like Get 6 Dwellers Pregnant or Collect 100 Power, you'll have to start the game over."
foshelter,3cczq4,shiftplusone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"You went too far for the exploit. It relies on you not completing the very first ""sell weapons"" task or ""equip"" task. Since your tasks ask for 6 each, I'm guessing you've most likely already done the first one. If you want to do the exploit, you have to start the game over."

foshelter,3cczq4,dsebulsk,0,Tue Jul 7 06:40:28 2015 UTC,The lunchbox glitch is worth deleting a vault and starting fresh for. I have/opened 200+ lunchboxes and all my dwellers had 12+ weapons by the time I unlocked the nuclear reactor. Limitless supply of CAPS and Legendaries. I have equip an outfit and sell weapon/outfit as my objectives that I kept. I completed them but didn't collect the reward so I could freely play the game without restricting myself.   If I accidentally collect the objectives to keep I will still be content with what I have by far.
foshelter,3cczq4,dsebulsk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:06:03 2015 UTC,"yes of course, but i will not be deleting my current one! i have found in the past that hacking games like this means that it is no longer a challenge to grind and hope for good items. game loses its purpose and it doesnt seem fun anymore"
foshelter,3cb8be,GoofAloof,7,Mon Jul 6 15:37:57 2015 UTC,Raider strength is based on average dweller level.  I had a bunch of new level 1 dwellers through births and the raiders started attacking with machetes again.
foshelter,3cb8be,Redd500,2,Mon Jul 6 16:47:24 2015 UTC,So one could potentially keep several level 1 dwellers hanging out in the storage rooms to keep the level of raiders balanced?  You've given me quite the idea.

I focused on replacing food and water production with 3-wide tier 3 Nuka Cola plants before jumping on to nuclear power. But that's just me.

The nuclear reactor brings 48 per turn when upgraded once. The second upgrade costs 18,000. You could set up many fully upgraded generators for the price of one upgraded nuclear reactor. I'm only at 60 dwellers so I've learned this the hard way but I can see how useful it will be near the end of the game"

The Nuclear Reactor works, but feels like it's more beneficial for its storage capacity than actual production. So you buy a few of them, leave your app open and collect / rush your other Power Plants...so the ""lack of power"" threshold is low on your power gauge."

foshelter,3capb3,foxsable,3,Mon Jul 6 12:50:16 2015 UTC,10 is the max that you can train for. But clothing does boost you above that.

foshelter,3capb3,firebird357,2,Mon Jul 6 13:29:21 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain with out looking it up that it reduces the time and when rushing it reduces the risk. And yes it'll be 14 with max Stat and armor that's +4.

If you drag a dweller into a room, it shows a number for what stat they'd bring, e.g. a lv5 strength into a power plant would show a +5, or if he was replacing someone with Lv2 it would show +3.  Now if I move a Lv10 str into a room (wearing a +3 str gear) to replace a Lv10 with no gear, it just says ""0"" rather than ""+3"" - therefore I think there is a cap of 10 and you might as well wear some +luck or something (once you hit Lv10)."
foshelter,3capb3,adamrammers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:57:51 2015 UTC,To test armor boosting past 10 put a dweller in a room they're maxed out in and take note of the production time. Then put on the armor that boosts past 10 and note the reduction in time. But it's already been confirmed which is why everyone says it does boost past 10.

It won't let me build an elevator in it and I can't demo the living space to adjust because I'm at the maximum.  They should let you have space for more than 200 just not let you HAVE more than 200.

foshelter,3c7yn9,GuiKa,64,Sun Jul 5 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"It's a lose-lose. Either pregnant women flee danger to ensure the safety of their unborn children (pretty important in a post-apocalyptic world). Or they fight and potentially die and you have an outrage that the game murders pregnant women.  The lesser evil, and honestly more logical action, is for them to flee.  The non-pregnant women in this game are every bit as combat capable as the men. And pregnant or not, the women are always as good at production and training.  There simply is no offense to be taken unless you are a terrible person who must be offended in some way by everything. And if it bothers you that much, play a vault that abstains from sex/pregnancy. Boost your population solely via lunch boxes and radio rooms."
foshelter,3c7yn9,redscull,7,Sun Jul 5 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, I had a vault that practiced abstinence because I was tired of tracking the gene pool. After the first 16 dwellers on day one, the next two weeks saw literally no new dwellers, despite opening 10+ lunchboxes. After that I rage quit the vault. Earlier this morning, really. So I surmise that without increasing population via breeding, new dwellers will not arrive at the vault.   This was only one case, and I will admit I did not document it. This should replicated to see if others have the same results."
foshelter,3c7yn9,SkippyDude420,2,Mon Jul 6 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"I actually have an abstinence vault. No sex. No lunch box exploit. No bought lunch boxes. I'm at 19 dwellers (I haven't bothered counting how many lunch box missions I've suffered through, but it's been a lot). I just need to get lucky on one more lunch box and the radio room will be unlocked. I'm going to persist until it happens or raiders kill my 19 dwellers (and that's also very possible; we had some bad casualty counts earlier on)."
foshelter,3c7yn9,redscull,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:16:18 2015 UTC,"Makes sense in the FO universe. Why would a vault let anyone in and, if they didn't let people in in addition to not breeding, how would they maintain any sort of population?"
foshelter,3c7yn9,ZarathustraEck,6,Mon Jul 6 01:13:24 2015 UTC,the game murders pregnant women   That's the key. Can you imagine the fabricated uproar?
foshelter,3c7yn9,welchblvd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"It could have worked thusly:   For every M-F couple in the Vault there is a 5% chance of a baby per hour (or something like that), such that kids just appear occasionally, no pregnancy per se, and certainly no ""breeding"" of your dwellers.  Would definitely feel a bit less creepy that way."
foshelter,3c7yn9,redscull,3,Mon Jul 6 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"You're right. That would have made for a plausible and non-creepy solution.

At most you can breed for hair and skin, which is purely cosmetic."
foshelter,3c7yn9,blndcavefsh,23,Mon Jul 6 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"She's right, she's just completely missed the point.  The idea that women are babymakers is also mocked in the Fallout 3 trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZpR51XgW0 (It's also made pretty clear that the girl is made pretty uncomfortable by that expectation.)  The entire point of fallout is to mock the social and political norms of the 1950s.  The game is supposed to be sexist. It's a darkly humorous look at how the potential of vault life might be presented by the dominant ideology."
foshelter,3c7yn9,relaxing,2,Sun Jul 5 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"She did address that -- what about it makes it a satire, rather than just a recreation of the same shitty ideas that exist in the real world?  I'm geniunely unsure."
foshelter,3c7yn9,blndcavefsh,11,Mon Jul 6 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"The fact that they're so clearly poking fun. The baby making scene, where babies are literally shooting out of her vagina into a great big tub of babies is obviously supposed to be funny. Fallout Shelter does the same thing but with mechanics. It's ridiculous that one woman could be expected to have so many children for the good of the society, so it's supposed to be funny.  Even the ant farm way of displaying the vault ties into the idea of putting the dominant ideology of the hivemind before your own personal desires.  It's not easy to make a mechanical joke. So far, games like The Stanley Parable and Portal 2 have been able to make spoken/visual jokes interactive, but this is one of the first games I've seen where the mechanic itself is the joke.   I know I went off on a tangent there and it's not all relevant, but analysing this app is actually pretty interesting."
foshelter,3c7yn9,relaxing,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"Oh yes it is entirely ridiculous that one woman could have so many children that is so hilarious  Look I'm not saying you're wrong.

foshelter,3c7yn9,linaatir,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:20:05 2015 UTC,I am a woman and I found it funny and it's a mechanic in a game big deal. Maybe the men doesn't want to be forced into being the fathers of said children in the game etc or MAYBE its just goddamned pixels that doesn't have feelings motives or opinions.
foshelter,3c7yn9,lipsyncforyourlife,22,Tue Jul 7 08:57:50 2015 UTC,Is she Mr. Fantastic because that was a huge reach
foshelter,3c7yn9,SRS-SRSLY,10,Sun Jul 5 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a dyed-in-the-wool internet feminist, I noticed that as well. I also noticed that I'd be upset if any of my dwellers were like, ""um, excuse me. I'm actually not a breeder,"" or ""can I not? I had a child very recently"". VAULT 270 NEEDS BABIES!  I settled on the observation that in a survival-focused autocratic society where breeding is regulated and demanded, a patriarchy (along with other oppressive systems) was inevitable. Before you hit a critical mass of dwellers, it's more valuable to impregnate women and arm men and distribute the men to more accident prone positions so that when you decide to expand your numbers you can allow the women to hide. What do you call a society where men have all the jobs and all the guns?   Fortunately, once you have plenty of people, it starts making more sense to empower women, but in my own vault, I'm still in an equalizing phase. It's kind of nice to think of a more progressive society growing from a sketchy autocratic ruin.   I think it would benefit the game to assign personalities, friendships/loves, objections and rebellions to the dwellers. Not only would that generally help add depth to the game, it would help aleve AS's objection, since there may be dwellers who may express their preferences. The player can act as a good cop overseer and make sure that people's wishes are respected or can act as a bad cop overseer and make demands for the good of the many that rolls over the wishes of the few.  (post-thought: they would need to think very carefully about whether the overseer player could coerce unwilling women into having babies, since that gets into rape territory really quick. They might want to have a spectrum of baby-wanting, where there's a minimum of 50% under which the woman simply will not have babies, and if it's low it takes a long time and provides no happiness bonus because she's only a little bit into being a mother, while if it's high it happens very quickly and provides a high happiness bonus because she wants herself some babies)"
foshelter,3c7yn9,anillop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:24:42 2015 UTC,If the overseer was a woman shouldn't it be a matriarchy?
foshelter,3c7yn9,SRS-SRSLY,3,Mon Jul 6 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"Not really. I think if you were to want to establish a vault society that favored the women dwellers over the men, that might look like a vault at population limit where new and weak men are sent into the wasteland to die, since men and women are equal except that women can make babies. That would make women greatly privileged over men, since being a man might cost a person their life!  In the early days of my vault, women were valued primarily for their ability to have babies, while men were valued primarily for their individual stats and level. Soon, men had higher stats, higher levels, and better weapons than women. I didn't intend to do that, but the way the game is set up that's where I ended up. That's what makes a patriarchy, not my own gender."
foshelter,3c7yn9,foxtrot1_1,3,Mon Jul 6 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"No, patriarchy is a certain form of order rather than simply a man being in charge."
foshelter,3c7yn9,anillop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:39:36 2015 UTC,Ah so its just named after men because equality or something.  Well what ever it is it should never be used to show inherent biases of feminisim against men.
foshelter,3c7yn9,foxtrot1_1,7,Mon Jul 6 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"Your post seems confused. Think of the Catholic Church, which reflects the governing ideas of a lot of hierarchies throughout history until around a century ago. It's run entirely by men and ordered around that - the entire system is based on men. It's a patriarchy. A female pope wouldn't change that the whole system is based around men.   It has nothing to do with equality? I think you're bringing your own issues into it."
foshelter,3c7yn9,bjt23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"That's a bad example- a woman pope could easily allow for woman priests, which would allow for woman cardinals and bishops as well.  What makes it a patriarchy is that a woman would never become pope in the first place (and we're unlikely to see either woman or married priests until the church gets far more desperate for priests)."
foshelter,3c7yn9,anillop,0,Tue Jul 7 02:44:03 2015 UTC,Frankly I think the fact that anyone thinks this game has anything to do with sexism is just them bringing their own issues into it.
foshelter,3c7yn9,blndcavefsh,3,Mon Jul 6 16:32:12 2015 UTC,All of fallout is a tightly crafted parody of the 1950s. Of course there are references to sexism. Picking up on them doesn't mean you're an extreme feminist.
foshelter,3c7yn9,anillop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:14:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess if your job is to be insulted and offended for a living you can find sexism everywhere if you look hard enough.
foshelter,3c7yn9,blndcavefsh,4,Mon Jul 6 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"Who's offended? Sexism is in the game because the 1950s were sexist. Fallout is poking fun at the 1950s, and thus also pokes fun at their sexist attitudes.   Another example: racism is in Schindler's List, but the film itself is not racist.  I'm not saying Fallout has ever been sexist, but there's plenty of sexism to be found in the world."
foshelter,3c7yn9,SRS-SRSLY,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"Well, think of what AS and the blogger's complaints were outside of sexism and feminism.   The Vault is an autocracy and the dwellers are extremely simple models of human beings. Everybody is always happy unless their basic needs are not met, and everybody is made extremely happy when they reproduce. These people are more akin to carpenter bees than human beings! The game would be more interesting and more deep if the human beings modeled in the game had a diverse set of personalities, interests and wants.   Bringing things back to feminism and sexism, this change would massively reduce the patriarchal complaint. Some women would want to have babies and other women will want jobs and if the player meets their wants the player will be rewarded with extra happiness in the vault. By adding depth to the dweller's personalities, we can both improve the game and remind the player that not all people are alike."
foshelter,3c7yn9,Derrythe,13,Mon Jul 6 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Surprise surprise, someone who makes hundreds of thousands of dollars finding sexism everywhere and reporting it managed to find sexism somewhere so she could report it.  In other news, Doom and Fallout are violent games."

How much is that worth?  Suggesting that criticism of games from a feminist perspective is ignorant is really bizarre because it's literally the opposite of ignorance. She's looking at gaming through a new lens, bringing a new perspective on the medium. You can disagree with it, but it's certainly something new and different than most of the mainstream coverage.

In this game, women get paid as much as the men, pregnant women can work throughout their pregnancy, and they get to keep their job after giving birth without any hitch in productivity. These women have more rights and equality than American women do currently.   I have a badass chick explorer who doesn't want babies at this time. She's getting friendly with this one guy though, so who knows. Maybe she'll give up the exploring life for a ""year"" [read: 3 hrs] to have a family.   The thing that's most annoying about the whole thing is the f@&$ing yellow mumu shirts. Ugh.   Tl;dr I am a feminist woman who actually has children. I think the portrayal is fine. And actually, the mothers in this game are afforded more equality than the average American mother."
foshelter,3c7yn9,Morty_And_Rick,4,Mon Jul 6 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"A pregnant woman firing a combat shotgun can not be good for the baby. If you can't drink too much caffeine then the adrenaline from fire or fighting would be harmful to it as well. Living in a vault in the year 2077+ should imply that women are knowledgeable of these things, as most are today. Guess all women today don't know proper child carrying safety, though."
foshelter,3c7yn9,gentrfam,2,Sun Jul 5 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"The adrenaline response is called ""fight or flight."" The pregnant women run around in terror. That's the flight part of adrenaline."
foshelter,3c7yn9,Morty_And_Rick,-1,Tue Jul 7 07:07:42 2015 UTC,"I understand the fight or flight thing, but the adrenaline from a fight would last longer than from running away. Running away is quicker than fighting and you'll calm down quicker. It's also probably more natural for a pregnant woman's instinct to flight rather than to fight, as this is an evolutionary advantage."
foshelter,3c7yn9,gentrfam,2,Sun Jul 5 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"But, the physical exertion is greater in flight. And combat training allows men and women to recognize and cope with the adrenaline dump. The chronic stress from being constantly helpless is likely worse for the baby. Most studies show that chronic stress is much worse than acute stress."

My 'fix' would be along the lines of having them fight the event (fire, intruders, radroaches) as normal until their health drops below a certain amount. Maybe 1/4 of the full bar, and then they make a tactical (non-panicked) retreat in until they are recovered. This has the benefit of being able to breed as normal without having to find a replacement each time someone is pregnant.  I don't think it's much to ask and I feel a solution like that would work for everyone."

I'm serious! :)  I noticed this as well when I started my vault and felt it was a bit odd considering Fallout's otherwise fairly progressive stance.   Why wouldn't a pregnant woman be able to use the shotgun I just gave her? it should just matter if the vault dwellers have a weapon or not.   Or they could make it random so that sometimes even though some vault dwellers have weapons they flee in terror anyway, no matter the gender. Maybe their SPECIAL stats could have something to do with that, if they have really low Strength, Intelligence or Charisma they might have a bigger chance of fleeing the room in case of incident."
foshelter,3c7yn9,wyldcat,14,Thu Jul 9 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"It's not that she'd be unable to fight, it's that if she does fight then that means there's a chance of her dying and if she dies whilst pregnant then I think that would be considered even worse, otherwise if she were to fight but not die well, I think you get the picture."
foshelter,3c7yn9,PartyTimeMentats,-11,Mon Jul 6 10:13:54 2015 UTC,"I can totally understand the need to protect a child and a childbearing mother. But what surprised me was how backwards it was implemented in the game:  The pregnant mother reacts by screaming, arms raised and fleeing the room like she would only be a damsel in distress.   Women are usually pretty bad ass in the Fallout universe so this came as a surprise to me.   It's not that I'm offended, just surprised how it was implemented in the game, it's just unnecessary and a bit lazy if you ask me. They could've just made it so a pregnant woman would pop off a few rounds, and left the room to take cover. Or like in my other examples above, to make it random so everyone can flee a scene.  An example of how this was treated better was in Mad Max Fury Road and how the movie showed how Splendid helped out even though she was pregnant.    And of course there's a vast difference between the two, a small mobile game and a big movie, but according to me, FOS sets a bad example of how it shows the capabilities of a pregnant woman."

So men have to always be perfect and nothing bad happen to them?   It's just a simple matter of equality. I know I will get downvoted by saying this but showing ALL pregnant women screaming in panic, arms raised and fleeing the room is making it look like all pregnant women are worthless damsels in distress. Which of course they aren't.  EDIT: And also, about your question, like in Mad Max, they showed Splendid not being able to reload a gun, and later on she died. So that again showed a good example of how to be balanced.   This is just a small detail that annoyed me a bit, in an otherwise perfect game."

It can be annoying.   But one can of course argue that it fits the Fallout narrative that makes fun of how it was in the 50s, a time when equality wasn't a thing in most places."

Which of course they aren't.   What would you do to make it represent the situation better? It's already been established that they cannot be put in the position to attack or put out fires.  Would you have them calmly leave the room? They cannot physically remain in the room as that would disallow other able dwellers to assist in resolving the situation."
foshelter,3c7yn9,ohaitharr,5,Mon Jul 6 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"I would have made it so that the player chooses what to do with them.    If I give them a weapon they should stay and fight. But just to show that there's a bigger risk involved they could've made it so they have less HP and can die a bit easier, but it still up to me, the overseer, to assess the situation. There's obviously a timer set to the pregnancy in the game, so there could be a bigger risk of them dying later on in the pregnancy than right in the beginning of pregnancy. If a fire breaks out they stay and help to put it out (If I'm a caring overseer I would of course get her out of the room to protect her and the baby and get someone else in there). If they don't have a weapon they leave the room, but not the damsel-in-distress-mode they are shown to act like in the game now, as I described above.   I think that this would make me care more about them and might be a bigger challenge for me as a player. Instead of them automatically running out in every situation I would need to assess each situation and think about the risks involved of the woman and the baby she's carrying.  I would also make it so that everyone even though carrying a weapon would have a certain chance of panicking and running out of the room in case of incident. Maybe if the dweller has a low level of Strength, Charisma or Intelligence they might have a bigger chance of getting panic. Just to spice up the gameplay a bit."
foshelter,3c7yn9,wyldcat,2,Mon Jul 6 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, is that if they allow a pregnant woman to fight, there's a chance she'll die, therefore people will freak out that Bethesda is baby killers."

She could've used a shot of a non-pregnant woman in that position instead but then it wouldn't look as sexist. Plus it's not like the women are a little bit pregnant, they're like 9 months pregnant over the course of a few hours. I think of not making a pregnant women fight a radroach infestation or put out a fire as the equivalent of not making a 9 months pregnant woman stand on a bus (or fight an actual fire when there are other people around).

foshelter,3c7f2w,HappyZombies,7,Sun Jul 5 16:16:24 2015 UTC,FWIW the raiders start with the first production room on the first floor every time.  I leave the vault room and the adjacent bunker empty.  The next room is a diner with six people armed to the teeth.  Haven't worried about raiders since.
foshelter,3c7f2w,_rgx,2,Sun Jul 5 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. The raiders do not target rooms randomly. They will always run straight to the same room (closest room with people in it). Normally this is the room directly right of the entrance,  whether it's a training room or production. If it's empty (barracks or storage), and the only elevator you have connected to the top floor is the original one at the entrance, they'll head back to it, go down one floor, then exit to the right. Every time.  The easiest way to deal with them is just to put a size 3 production room directly to the right of the entrance, and arm the 6 workers in that room with good weapons (your best ""common"" weapons like enhanced sawed-off shotguns - your very few most awesome guns should be on your top explorers). I recommend a production room instead of a training room so that those dwellers in it will be earning level ups; higher level dwellers survive better vs. ever-stronger raiders. Training room dwellers aren't gaining levels, and I'm not sure any specials matter that much vs. raiders, not compared to levels or guns.   I normally build my early power room there, eventually bulldozing that starting barracks so that I can make the size 3 power room adjacent to the entrance elevator. Just be careful you have no pregnant dwellers that copulated in that barracks when you demolish it or they'll stay preggo forever."

Too much room for abuse if that button existed. Raiders get in significantly slower if you upgrade it. Usually I have enough time to send my two strongest dwellers from anywhere in my 10 floor vault to the door and equip them with the best weapons with some 10 seconds to spare. That preparation time is worth the money spent. Have two high level/stat dwellers wait for them in the vault room with your best weapons. They usually can deal with all three before they get any further. If they do run through after a minute or so, they are usually weak enough for the next room to defeat quickly. I tend to give that room (a diner for me) higher quality weapons just to be safe.   Also yeah, everyone here is asking for that same thing. They should at the very least give you caps/exp."

foshelter,3c7f2w,isiasob,2,Sun Jul 5 17:48:08 2015 UTC,"Getting people pregnant is the best until you can get the lounge, I think. Don't use the same guy for every kid otherwise none of his kids can have more kids because the game stops incest from happening. Once you unlock the lounge, boost up the charisma of 6 dwellers and put them in a 3 wide fully upgraded radio station. I get a new dweller 9/10 times in there. I'm actually at a point where I'm getting too many dwellers to keep up and have stopped anyone from having sex.  After you get to a decent point, lunch boxes are only just nice surprises, honestly. The only thing they're really great for is getting legendary characters and loot. If you're into that, buying wouldn't be bad as I barely ever get lunch boxes anymore this late in the game (115 dwellers)."

foshelter,3c7f2w,robotsteak,3,Sun Jul 5 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"Another way to get caps is when dwellers level up, so having lots of dwellers working can add up adds up. Also caps for dwellers who level up SPECIAL stats in training rooms.  Also, you randomly/occasionally get caps from collecting production resources, and the chance for this occurring goes up if the dwellers in that room have higher Luck.

If you send a dweller out with 25 stimpaks and then rush a room while s/he's leaving the vault and there's an emergency, the dweller stays in the vault after the emergency is dealt with and you can send them out again, adding 25 stimpaks like usual, with the result being the dweller having 50 paks to use in the wasteland.

foshelter,3c7o3m,spoonymoonchair,7,Sun Jul 5 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"Nuclear plants are definitely the way to go due to their much larger storage capacity and the fact that the requisite skill (strength) is the same as for the basic power plants. I build one or two as soon as I can afford them and then go back and retrofit the old plants.  I recommend passing on the gardens and water purification plants. They are too expensive and become available too late to be useful. Instead, make enough regular food and water plants to get your population to 100 and use the caps you saved to make Nuka Cola plants with one upgrade, which is comparable to having both a food and water plant at level two. As your population grows and caps start to flow in you can then go back and make the costly upgrade to level two. Also, be sure to start training people in endurance and luck as early as possible so that these plants are both efficient and profitable. The same skills are also useful for explorers, so build your training facilities accordingly.  Another tip: plan your final layout, particularly with regards to living space, well before you reach 200 dwellers. Once your vault has space for 200 you can no longer build more living spaces nor delete existing ones once they start to occupy them."
foshelter,3c7o3m,caseyweb,4,Sun Jul 5 21:25:19 2015 UTC,Consider only using as many nuclear plants as necessary to give sufficient storage. They are expensive and produce no more per minute than the cheaper plants.   Remember that raiders steal portions of your capacity. Being full nuclear plants will give you a huge capacity/production ratio and a simple raider invasion will cripple your power resources and take a long time to recover from. I find a 2-3 ratio of nuclear to normal just right.  Gardens and Water Purifiers are rubbish and should be skipped for Nuka-Cola.  Author: Foshelter Efficiency Sheet
foshelter,3c7o3m,TunderProsum,2,Sun Jul 5 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"Expense shouldn't be a strategic criterion; If caps are an ongoing issue in the late game then there is something wrong. Raiders stealing excess resource capacity also shouldn't be an issue; they steal at a fixed rate but shouldn't survive past the first room, and as long as available power exceeds required power everything is fine. I have never seen my late-game power drop more than ~10% from a raid. Yes, it takes longer to recover to maximum power, but that is due to the much larger capacity (4x normal power plants), and with 10/10 dwellers you can safely rush every nuke station three or four times. And nuclear plants are more efficient when you factor in rushing.  Resource stations manned with 10/10 dwellers also produce a lot of caps and with 150+ dwellers there is no reason not to have 20 or more explorers out at all times farming more caps. I say go with 100% nuclear plants simply for the storage capacity and esthetics."
foshelter,3c7o3m,caseyweb,2,Sun Jul 5 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"I agree Casey, caps aren't an issue late in the game but the OP asked  after replacing plants in the early game when Nuclear had just been unlocked. There are better things to be doing with caps at that point.  I think what you're saying is right for your preferences. But I don't want to have to rush my rooms and sit tapping after each raid to restore my power."

foshelter,3c7o3m,travelphotomoto,2,Mon Jul 6 03:26:35 2015 UTC,"Nuclear plants  put out more power per cycle, but the length of the cycle is longer assuming the same dweller stats. So production/time is roughly equivalent. Rushing (successfully) always produces the full amount, giving nuclear plants the edge. And the storage capacity is much larger."
foshelter,3c7o3m,caseyweb,3,Mon Jul 6 04:14:56 2015 UTC,"The nuclear generator has enhanced storage capacity over the conventional ones.

foshelter,3c7o3m,akarpend6,2,Sun Jul 5 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"it's like:  1) rebuild vault to an optimal form - 10 or so nuclear reactors (all 2-cell) - 3~5 nuka-cola plants (all 3-cell) - 0 water/food plants - 0~12 radio operators - all plants are filled with stat 10+ - 5 barracks, isolated (preventing incident spread to other rooms)  - 12~16 training places for each SPECIAL - ~65 stimpaks and ~35 radaways - the first room from the vault door should be 3-cell size and filled with enough firepower - for convenience, all resource gathering rooms better be together in upper side of the vault, spread within a display screen size (e.g. for my iPhone 5, 8~9 floors) - warehouses as many as you like, preferably isolated as barracks - 199~200 dwellers (reserve 1 if you occasionally feel like to kill someone waiting in line) - pregnancy is bad when incidents happen; so just ban all procreation activities or make a gender vault in the first place (the Rainbow wins this case!)  2) train and switch dwellers - might have some 45~50 level dwellers so train them hard - and send low level dwellers with enough SPECIAL to trainees' initial working position - keep just enough firepower (level - weapon - SPECIAL) for each room, preparing for ever-level-rising  radroaches / at the same time send exploration and train dwellers as MANY as you can - once rebuilding the vault is done, you have too many caps to spend; so do not care explorers dying in their boots (anyway they're just 1000 caps each soul)  ...Then you may win (slightly more) weapons and outfits. Feeling lazy? Go buy some serious loads of lunch-boxes.  3) go crazy as you want - kill all male dwellers because you like women - make a loyal squad, give them a family name as you like and just love them (hmm, names... how about Officer Mack?) - make stories with your dwellers - make a novella with them - leave your vault nothing: 0 dwellers, 0 rooms and 0 caps  TL;DR: go buy some trucks of  lunchboxes. They're in half price now, or I've heard so.  EDIT, for OP: oh what's this mess. go build nuclear reactors (2-cell)."

My lore answer is that Vault-Tec has set varying amounts of dwellers depending on each experiment. Plus, they aren't exactly honest. They'd like you to believe you've got the best Vault possible, and set their own parameters for you, not necessarily telling you that other vaults have it better like, say, equipped with a GECK. So it's only natural they make it sound like it's part of the rules, fits the corporation-stabbing-you-in-the-back theme.

foshelter,3c6b6l,drumther,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:57:10 2015 UTC,"This one is quite different to most freemium games. In most of them you either spend money on ""resources"" and ""acelerate"" progress, or you always get to a point where you get stuck. Here, you don't really need any of the things you're trying to get out of launchboxes. The only thing you cannot game get ingame without launchboxes are Legendary dwelleres and they just have higher stats base, that's all. By training your dwellers you could turn any into a 10-in-all one. You could even rename them if you want to. Everything else you could find it in the wasteland."

Yes Rad roaches can hold a major problem, but that is if you aren't focusing on getting your dwellers the right amount of equipment to defend themselves. For example the medical block of Vault 99 has each and every member armed at least with at worst, a rusty poorly repaired laser pistol. Not one rad roach has killed a member of that block. Even if your telling the truth of this for what I will call ""King roach"" a small arms pistol and bb gun wouldn't help very much. Even if the causalities are high, retreat and deal with it's underlings in the rooms that they spread into.  Tl;dr. Get better weapons, arm all your dwellers and if you can't kill it, the dwellers in the other rooms should be able to handle any roaches that go into the other rooms so just let it de-spawn.(Bugs will be bugs, sorry.)"

foshelter,3c5e7b,artofsushi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:15:16 2015 UTC,Probably some small changes can be made without requiring a full update. I'm pretty sure they patched Luck cap gains from production buildings. It's also how they could push through the new dweller and weapon for lunchboxes.
foshelter,3c5e7b,Daend,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:32:00 2015 UTC,Did they fix it? :O:O
foshelter,3c5e7b,drumther,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:33:11 2015 UTC,"they might have fixed it, my game no longer loads. It won't even get to the main menu before it crashes. will re installing it make me lose my progress?"
foshelter,3c3l7d,Slash3d,12,Sat Jul 4 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that dwellers with endurance will be happier working there, and it gives you a way to have happy endurance dwellers before you make it to nukacola rooms."
foshelter,3c3l7d,jowshie,0,Sat Jul 4 13:07:08 2015 UTC,Storage rooms also help late game with population control. If you have no were to put anyone it helps to put them in the storage rooms instead of the barracks as they will create more population in the barracks  Edit: the endurance trait is mainly an oversight. It doesn't do anything besides make the person whose highest trait endurance happy. It's also a good buffer early on for raider attacks. As dwellers with high endurance take less damage. Good room for right after the vault entrance.
foshelter,3c3l7d,Killscare,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you want power generators closer to the vault door because the dwellers in the power generators have higher strength, thus should be better for raider attacks?"
foshelter,3c3l7d,particletheory,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:12:55 2015 UTC,I don't think it's tested that strength helps for combat against raiders. The safest bet would be to put whatever room and have there people with good weapons and high level (level affects HP). Though for me I have put two dwellers lvl 35 with 20+ weapons and nothing passes.
foshelter,3c3l7d,Mattnet,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, High level matters a lot. I have noticed that dwellers with high endurance take less damage from raider attacks."
foshelter,3c3l7d,Killscare,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, endurance=HP"
foshelter,3c3l7d,thenbmeade,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"the endurance trait is mainly an oversight.   Except that it also helps when sending them out of your shelter, and on Nuka-Cola rooms."
foshelter,3c3l7d,pliers_agario,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:00:58 2015 UTC,Nuke cola rooms are very helpful but also a late game room. Only really helpful for people going out in the wastes by the reduced radiation damage.

foshelter,3c2uad,Murdock07,2,Sat Jul 4 16:20:39 2015 UTC,"There also appears to be a bug with the transfer of items from dweller inventory to vault storage.  In collecting items from an explorer who had been out for more than 100 hours, I lost about 70 items of the expected 98.  This included five of the eight found Rares (Double-Barrel Sawed-Off Shotgun, Nobility Outfit, Hardened Hunting Rifle, Double-Barrel Shotgun, Shotgun).  Kind of takes the point out of exploring if you're not even going to get all the items you found."

foshelter,3c54az,pliers_agario,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"In my experience exploration works the fastest, especially if you let them out for long as the EXP gained from monster raises over time. But you need to give them a good weapon (at least 10+ damage), a lot of stimpacks and radaways (no need for radaways if the dweller has 10 of endurance) and ideally not too low SPECIALs so they can stay out for at least a day and a half."
foshelter,3c54az,Mattnet,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:05:35 2015 UTC,Depends on what you have. If you have strong weapons and legendary dwellers send those guys out. Your normal guys will level faster if you get their SPECIAL to like 5-7 of the specific stat then sticking them in a production building for a while.
foshelter,3c16is,heevko411,47,Fri Jul 3 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"The longer your high level, high stat dweller stays out in the wasteland the better loot they'll return with... my ass."
foshelter,3c16is,Med_Power,16,Fri Jul 3 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"First, click through all of them.  All common items have more than one rare and legendary version.  Second, you have to send more than one maxed out dweller.  This morning I dispatched 35 dwellers almost all of whom will make it to the National Guard Depot for a shot at a Legendary.  Between them, I'm hoping to bring back 3 or 4 Legendaries and somewhere north of 100 rares.  It just takes time."
foshelter,3c16is,HabeQuiddum,8,Fri Jul 3 21:54:42 2015 UTC,How do you have enough stims to send that many out for that long
foshelter,3c16is,BMorg1,5,Fri Jul 3 22:17:36 2015 UTC,Probably the lunchbox bug. I have a 200 dweller vault filled with legendary and rare dwellers and one to two of each training room maxed and I can churn out stims with several maxed out rooms.  Also there is another bug that lets you give them more than 25 stims
foshelter,3c16is,MrBleah,3,Fri Jul 3 23:24:51 2015 UTC,"His stats were S-8+2, P-10, E-8+3, C-5, I-10, A-6, L-10.  I sent him out with 20 stims (I have a 3 wide Hospital) and 10 rad away (2 wide Science center). No bugs, but no National Guard with this one"
foshelter,3c16is,HabeQuiddum,5,Fri Jul 3 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"All I can tell at this point is throwing lots of people at the problem produces results.  In the twelve hours since I sent out those 35 dwellers, they've gotten 16 rares.  One has collected three while 22 have none:    Wasteland Doctor  Enhanced Combat Shotgun  Soldier Uniform  Naughty Nightwear  Sci-Fi Fan Outfit  Officer Fatigues  Sturdy Wasteland Gear  Officer Uniform  Hardened BB Gun  Advanced Jumpsuit  Hardened Shotgun, Horror Fan Outfit, AP 10mm Pistol  AP Hunting Rifle  Plasma Pistol  Engineer Outfit   I'm keeping track of how many Rares were gotten before the 30 hour mark and between the 30 and 60 hour mark.  We'll see if the rate of Rare of acquisition and the quality of Rares changes over time."
foshelter,3c16is,MrBleah,2,Sat Jul 4 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"I see quite a few rares after a 60 hour run on the two guys I have out there. They both have pretty high stats with one having only around a 5 in luck and the other having a 9. The 9 has more money, but overall they both seem to have a decent spread of rare items."
foshelter,3c16is,MrBleah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:50:55 2015 UTC,He shouldn't need the rads with his end boosted over 10. Give him 25 stims next time.
foshelter,3c16is,HabeQuiddum,2,Sat Jul 4 19:34:05 2015 UTC,"You can make it to the 60 hour mark on a well-armed, well-trained character on 25 stims.  I actually did use the stim bug on this wave but mostly so I could send them out one right after the other.  My first major wave, they were spread out over a two hour period and I had to spend too much time waiting for each person to reach each fixed encounter.  This time I pre-loaded them with stims over the same two-hour period - to manufacture them all - but was able to dispatch 35 dwellers within 30 minutes start to finish."
foshelter,3c16is,MrBleah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"I just made it past 60 hours with a couple of high level guys that were also well trained. 8-10 in all stats, except one guy had a lower end and luck than the other. The guys with the high end took no rad damage and lasted longer, he is still going actually with one stim left. They both went out with 25 stims. One guy had an enhanced Gatling laser and the other has a MIRV (guy with higher stats has the MIRV so that could be helping his survivability as well).  The high end really seems to help, but then again they had high everything.  I'm working on a group of dwellers with 10s in every stat. In a few days the first one should be done. Then I have to decide what outfit to send him out in."

foshelter,3c3rnh,TunderProsum,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:15:11 2015 UTC,"You could build them because they look cool. And eventually the caps cost difference isn't really that big of a deal. But if you're a min/maxer, go nuka cola. I personally like an interesting vault that I can kind of imagine my dwellers living in. Not all hopped up on cola 24/7.  And really the only concerning production room is power; I have tons of those.  I keep my vault around 150 people, and I get enough food and water with just one nuka, one diner, one garden, one water, and one purification (all size three with 10-13 stat workers). 5 unique rooms is more interesting and fun to me than saving space by using all nuka. And the mountain has way more space in it that you'll ever actually need for rooms even if you go to 200 dwellers."
foshelter,3c4p5z,Daend,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that luck (+ the requisite stat) decreases the likelihood of failure, and the less the chance of failure the less the reward.

I found they couldnt handle supermutants and deathclaws until they've gotten 15+ damage. Even then, they would fail at them, but less likely. Now one of them has a 21-23 weapon, and barely ever misses a fight.  I can't say for sure which one is important, but weapon damage matters for sure if you're aiming for 60+ hours explorations."
foshelter,3c1wl0,drumther,2,Sat Jul 4 01:52:01 2015 UTC,"I send everyone out with a shitty weapon so that I can save the good stuff for the dwellers in the shelter. My reasoning is that the explorers have a reasonable chance of finding something better for themselves, whereas my homebodies are stuck with whatever is on hand. So far every single explorer I've ever sent out has returned with better weapons than they left with.  All of the above said, I tend to send my explorers out for around 6 hours per go, not the multi-day marathon sessions other people are doing. For me, shorter expeditions mean quicker turnaround to collect loot. I'm also able to send out my more mediocre dwellers, that way.  In fact, I'll admit that when I get frustrated with a particular dweller I'll often send them into the wilderness in formalwear, packing a 10mm, and see if they're worthy of coming back."
foshelter,3c1wl0,sarasmirks,2,Sat Jul 4 02:38:18 2015 UTC,This is one way to do Wasteland exploration though the chance of getting rares is lower with lower expeditions. One way to do this more efficiently is to send all explorers at once and hope to trigger the negative time bug which will give ALL your explorers a rare (search on this subreddit for more info on the bug). But if you want to have a longer run (over 24 hours) then you definitely need to give them a strong weapon.
foshelter,3c1wl0,Mattnet,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:27:39 2015 UTC,"Your best explorer should have your best weapon.  That way they have the highest chance of getting to the fixed time events.  They might not replace their original weapon or armor, but they'll get something better for the next guy in line.  Once everyone in your shelter is equipped, start collecting weapons that are only better than 1, then 3, then 5, 6, 7 etc.  You vendor a lot of trash in this game.  It is not long, just a few days before you have to start triaging your inventory.  Edit:  Best explorer should generally be your highest level who has the best combinations of S/E/L or so.  Those specific combinations are pretty debatable, but I do believe when you start the game, you get someone with high strength.  He/she would be your best explorer.  Most of my early explorers were either a lunchbox legendary or someone with high strength.  You also unlock the strength training room relatively quickly which helps your power room workers as well (which also leads to turning high level power operators into explorers).  High level is much more important than stats; I won't start cross training workers into explorers until level 15 or so.  (Radio room operators won't level and as such, when you make the ""extras"" into explorers, they are a huge pain in the butt.  Very high special stats + level 1 and they still get chewed up.  They just don't have the hit points)."

The only logical conclusion is that the dwellers are kinky and want you to watch. That's why the camera pans in on that room right before they get it on. You can't see all the action though.

My Inflight patters so far has been to build the advanced triple (i.e. Nuka Cola, Nuclear), migrate all the workers from the normal P/f/w plant, then backfill only if surplus P/W/F goes down.

foshelter,3bwmfj,jetjordan,4,Thu Jul 2 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"We aren't sure at the moment:   All evidence points to the regular, hourly loot event increasing the chance of dropping rare and legendary the longer you stay out.  We haven't found another fixed time loot drop event past the 60 hour mark yet.   Those two facts are fighting out for what's best to do, return after 60:00 fixed event, or stay out for ever increasing chances at loot from the hourly events.  Given that we're still unsure, I'd argue for staying out and recording your expeditions. We need to know what's out there to make an informed decision."

foshelter,3bwpw7,g00sefrabaaaa,2,Thu Jul 2 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"They also do the same with armor. If they are wearing combat armor and find something with better stats, like naughty nightwear, they will wear the naughty nightwear."
foshelter,3bvi3n,AreYouReadyToReddit,3,Thu Jul 2 14:17:21 2015 UTC,I'd like to know the answer to this. I don't even know whether stats stack above 10. Haven't been able to find consistent/concrete answers there.
foshelter,3bvi3n,Elevas,3,Thu Jul 2 14:41:19 2015 UTC,The stats go above 10 for sure. At over 10 endurance you take negative radiation damage while exploring.  Also you can see the difference in room performance if you stack above 10 for the appropriate stat
foshelter,3bvi3n,MrBleah,5,Thu Jul 2 15:20:32 2015 UTC,Does that mean radiation HEALS them?
foshelter,3bvi3n,001337,4,Thu Jul 2 15:32:44 2015 UTC,Yes
foshelter,3bvi3n,shadowman3001,4,Thu Jul 2 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"It's not helpful to the community to announce something as fact when it isn't, especially something that's probably incorrect."
foshelter,3bvi3n,TunderProsum,2,Thu Jul 2 20:05:49 2015 UTC,WHAT?
foshelter,3bvi3n,Gatineau,2,Thu Jul 2 19:36:17 2015 UTC,That has not been proved.
foshelter,3bvi3n,TunderProsum,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"This is not been proven and indeed, is likely false. Rad-away takes away radiation damage without healing the character, this is likely exactly what excess endurance does."
foshelter,3bvi3n,TunderProsum,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure myself. They definitely don't take any radiation damage, so no need for radaway."
foshelter,3bvi3n,MrBleah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:40:08 2015 UTC,Sweet. Shall have to get a few of those 8s and 9s back into training rooms then!
foshelter,3bvi3n,Elevas,3,Thu Jul 2 15:31:33 2015 UTC,"Until we get proof of any other stat scaling well in the wastes above 10, the answer for now is Luck:   It's proven to increase caps drops above 10.  It's hypothesised to increase rare/legendary drops but we're still collecting data.    Foshelter Efficiency Sheet  Replies here about being healed from excess endurance are unfounded. Whilst the pip-boy will read ""took -3 radiation damage"", it's beleived that this isn't healing the character, just attempting to reduce the radiation damage that doesn't exist. Just like a rad-away, it reduces the red bar, but doesn't heal you."
foshelter,3bvi3n,TunderProsum,2,Thu Jul 2 20:02:23 2015 UTC,"Luck is the way to go for sure here is one of my runs (http://imgur.com/6yEZNhE) with a 10(+7) luck dweller, a long with the 11k caps he also got a plasma pistol and flame thrower. He didn't get very far as his other stats were low but still came back with a mountain of loot."
foshelter,3bvi3n,TheGentlemenPancake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:55:15 2015 UTC,Actually according to the community here at Reddit it seems perception is the stat for weapons and luck for caps. Also you need to keep into consideration the fixed events in the wasteland (search on Reddit) that gives you access to Rares and Legendary gear. So I would suggest having an armor that spread the SPECIAL or one that upps the stat needed to pass the more useful fixed events like the military base for the legendary weapon.
foshelter,3bvi3n,Mattnet,2,Thu Jul 2 15:28:57 2015 UTC,I thought the crazy statistic guy discovered the National Guard Outpost was a 1/10 regardless of stats?
foshelter,3bvi3n,TheGentlemenPancake,2,Thu Jul 2 15:41:06 2015 UTC,"Might be that knowledge on that fixed event was changed, where did you read that? Last time I read about fixed events on Reddit my understanding was that all fixed events depend on a stat that affects the success chance but as everything related to fixed event it's not confirmed. Can you link the post you read about the 1/10 probability for the National Guard Outpost?"
foshelter,3bvi3n,Mattnet,3,Thu Jul 2 16:01:08 2015 UTC,Found it https://www.reddit.com/r/foshelter/comments/3bn3s6/legendary_success_rate_1_in_10_from_national/
foshelter,3bvi3n,TheGentlemenPancake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"If you've maxed out endurance and perception with the rest of the stats around 4 or so, I'd do anything to max out luck. The majority of the events that we know of which can provide rare items are perception based, and the only one that can provide legendaries is also perception based.  At an endurance of 10 you basically don't take radiation anymore (on top of more HP).  The rest is luck.  S, C, I, and A all impact the combat events (and IIRC, A impacts one rare item event), so having enough to pass those will minimize the amount of damage you take."
foshelter,3bwmvt,ResidentYam,3,Thu Jul 2 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"I just started playing and bought 5 last night to get me started and it gave me 10. Saw your post and bought 5 today to test and, sure enough, it gave me 10.  On iPad, not iPhone, if it matters?"
