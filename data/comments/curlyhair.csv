curlyhair,3e3kkd,Midnafold,6,Tue Jul 21 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"I just stopped straightening it. If you have a good length, you will probably be able to get some good curl back, and style easily enough. Your hair will need moisture. Lots of it after all the drying and frying. Find some good leave in products, conditioners and a gel to help manage frizz and shape your curls, invest in a good curl enhancing spray, this helped me cut back on washing it every day. I'm not sure if you want to go the CG route, but take a look at the sidebar for the Overview. It personally saved my hair.   If you're hair isn't in a place to style curly, look for some good up-dos and invest in some headbands until it gets healthier. Good luck!"

I've never cared much for the style of my hair, but this time round I'm looking to get a decent hair style.  It's been growing for almost a year now, so it's quite long, and I'm getting a haircut tomorrow. I'm not really sure what to do with it, or where to start looking, and a friend suggested I post here for advice.  If clearer pictures are needed just let me know."
curlyhair,3e26ib,SuperiorCoconut,5,Tue Jul 21 11:32:05 2015 UTC,"My first comment is that your hair is glorious and you have fantastic curl definition! Make sure they cut your hair DRY, not wet! As you know yourself, the curl is different when wet. I'd personally suggest a tight afro. I used to have one for years (female, btw) and they can frame your face really well. Also easy to maintain and everyone loves a good 'fro, especially since you've good curl definition to show it off. Some hairdressers would be more skilled with curly hair, and if so, I'd recommend they shave the sides in quite tight (not bald though!), getting gradually longer to the top. Easy maintenance, I'd say, and Jesus would it look cool. I'm not a hairdresser, so there could be more options, I just don't know of them :)"
curlyhair,3e26ib,spaxejam,3,Tue Jul 21 11:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say get it short (2.5in at the longest point) and use a different kind of shampoo.  It looks like your hair is quite frizzy and all over the place right now, also make sure to keep your facial hair and back of the neck hair neat because it's easier to look like a mess with curly hair.  I'd suggest Organix and use the conditioner every day and the shampoo every other day.  Also make sure to brush it after showering twice; once while it's wet then again when its dried.  All of this combined with slightly straighten and define your curls."
curlyhair,3e26ib,thepufferfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree with /u/SuperiorCoconut. I don't think your curl definition is that great, it looks frizzy and dry. My hair looked very similar to yours before I learned to take care of it (more or less with the curly-girl method).  I posted this in response to your thread in /r/malehairadvice, too, but don't get an undercut unless you have very strong facial features (jaw, cheekbones). It looks really bad otherwise.   Sorry I don't have much advice in terms of a way to style your hair. Like I said, mine is similar, and I have a hard time finding styles for men with it, too. I just know what NOT to do."

In the shower I flip my head upside down, use a wide-tooth comb to comb my hair over my head, squish to condish, lightly rinse, scrunch water out with microfiber towel until lightly damp, apply curl serum, flip my head over, shake gently, and allow to air dry.  I'm fully dry in under two hours and I've got great curl definition and root lift."
curlyhair,3e26qk,homicidalunicorns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:16 2015 UTC,Sometimes I plop my hair into a very loose knit sweater (almost like a jersey or fish net type material) and then normal blow dry it for about five minutes.  It won't dry it completely but it helps speed it along without blowing out the curls.

Think Claudio Sanchez (The band, Coheed and Cambria) with his hair up. just very curly haha.  whats the name of that gel you have? im gonna have to look up that product/ similar ones. does your hair get hard? easily disturbed by wind? and how long has it been lasting you throughout the day? sorry for all these questions lol."

But it wasn't so stiff that it kept my hair from moving around. And as far as I can remember it made my hair resistant to wind damage. Hope that answers your questions :) Also, I only used this gel bc it was laying around the house and I'm probably going to buy something different after a bit of research."

I started growing out my hair 32 months ago. I had been getting fades for about 5 years, and I wanted to try something new. I had waves for around a year, and then decided to grow it all out. Had I known I could do all the things that I know I can do now, I would've grown it out, and kept it, LONG ago.  The timeline is a little bit on the simplified side, at least in my eyes, and there are a few pictures missing (I'm a perfectionist >_>), but I'll be happy to add more, and say more, as interested people comment.  edit: Added more pictures, like I said. It was about a 50% increase, around 25 more pictures. A number of them involve my styling processes, along the way, and a few different styles. The perfectionist inside me is now satisfied."

curlyhair,3du6i5,__Shadynasty_,7,Sun Jul 19 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. It was coconut milk and some honey mixed together. I used to take upwards of 30 minutes to detangle. I think part of it was because my hair was so frizzy. Once a lot of the frizz was taken care of, there were very few snags I had to deal with.  I apply that treatment after conditioning. Then I stretch my hair into bantu knots. One on the right side of my head. One on the left side of my head. My hair is parted in the middle. Then I put a plastic bag over my hair, and tie it. I usually do this at night (or for a few hours). The next day, I stick my head under a shower with warm water. I run a hand throw my hair to make sure the water is penetrating everywhere, and this also helps define. Then I hit it with cold water to shock and seal things up."
curlyhair,3du6i5,__Shadynasty_,5,Mon Jul 20 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"Sweet!!!  Any idea what the ratio of coconut milk to honey is, and do you only use organic honey or can I just use the cheapest stuff possible."
curlyhair,3du6i5,Zombie-Process,10,Mon Jul 20 00:36:32 2015 UTC,"All you really have to do is go to the grocery store and get pure coconut milk (usually in the international foods aisle, not the stuff that comes in that small carton), and get a regular bottle of honey from the baking aisle, or wherever they have it.  Put the coconut milk in a container, add about 10 squeezes of honey.  You may also add other things to it, if you want. For example, some lime juice for enhanced shine. It's also said to lighten your hair a bit, if you care for that."

curlyhair,3du6i5,sphealwithit,8,Sun Jul 19 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"It's coconut milk and honey. It's all about protein. I noticed that certain curls on my head would always be frizzy. No matter how much conditioner I shingled in, they'd be pretty broken up. Other parts of my hair always had so much volume too, but I found out a good amount of that was from root frizz.  Hair is protein, so when you do a protein treatment, you're restoring structure. Coconut milk promotes that structure, and the humectants in the honey make things bouncy.

I kept thinking my hair was soft already, but the way it left things always surprised me. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AoKXzzplL.jpg  Vitamin E oil is also something I use. I massage some into my scalp after just about every wash.   As for the conditioners, I mess with the V05's, because they're natural. If I need something heavier, I like Aussie Moisture conditioner. Tresame Naturals is good too (big white bottle), but the smell started getting to me after a while, for some reason. I also started messing with some of the Herbal Essences line.

There's an explanation in the link. I don't really do it anymore, not because it didn't work, but because I decided that it would best, for me, to do that when I have longer hair.  So, while I don't use the method anymore, that book has a comprehensive list of natural conditioners and shampoos. It even tells you what ingredients to look for, and avoid, so you know how to pick your own products too. There's also the most scientific explanation of what hair is, and how it works, in that book, that I have ever seen.  There's other stuff, but those things alone justified the purchase to me."

curlyhair,3dyq5s,LongHairDontCareCzar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"I know it says ""shoulder length"", but I'm wondering if your hair is around as long as mine. Why does it look like a mess? I know I had the problem with trying pineapples, in the fall, because my hair would stick to the side when I took it out, instead of hanging downward.   That's definitely got something to do with the hair not being heavy enough to overwhelm the root spring.  As for the twistouts and braidouts, I'm not sure why your hair would have a problem, unless your technique was off (like many was, soooo many times).  Any pictures of your hair?"
curlyhair,3dyq5s,LongHairDontCareCzar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:13:35 2015 UTC,"When I pull it it goes to about armpit length, it's just shoulder length without any stretching. My hair does the same thing when I pineapple, it does this side mohawk thingy.  I'm pretty sure my technique is off, i'm so so so bad at braiding its unreal.  I'm at work now, but I should be able to get pictures when I get home though."
curlyhair,3dyq5s,LongHairDontCareCzar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. It does sound like the weight is probably the issue. Pineapple is as easy as things can get.

Hopefully I'll now have access to a lot of these crazy braided styles."

curlyhair,3dyc4l,givemeajetpack,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"I'm my experience and ESPECIALLY with pixie cuts,  there is no avoiding the awkwardness.  Your hair eventually turns into an inverted pyramid,  because the top layers get too long before the bottom grows out. The curls end up being cut blunt at one length  or razored (don't let them use a razor on your hair,  please!) and when they grow out,  things get funky.  That being said,  I LOVED my pixie cuts so much. I felt much more cute,  felt like I could pull off more makeup looks,  ect."
curlyhair,3dyc4l,wake_and_vape,2,Mon Jul 20 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"I really like getting longer pixie cuts or short Bob haircuts. With a long pixie, if it's long on top it kinda can grow into a Bob type style. This site has some good examples short curly hair"
curlyhair,3dyc4l,lichenberry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:53 2015 UTC,"A bob would probably be your best bet.  Pixie cuts generally require lots of maintenance due to awkward grow-out.  If you want low-maintenance hair for the next year, it's most likely best to go no shorter than chin length.  That way it can grow out and maintain pretty much the same look.  Also, that way you can put it in a ponytail or a bun on bad hair days, which is not an option if the hair is too short.  :-)"

curlyhair,3dv4n6,polish_addict,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:22 2015 UTC,"So basically, my hair is fairly curly. On the first day, I will wash and condition my hair, then when it dries a bit add either coconut oil conditioner or this super gro stuff with little green things in it, an argon  oil spray, some mousse, and then scrunch it up. It then dries extremely naturally curly.   But then the next day, it gets a little limp at the top and curly at the bottom, and by the third day it's pretty much wavy/straight with curls only at the bottom. This doesn't happen if I don't have anything in my hair though, because then it's just frizzy and a mass of curls/ turns into a nest of hair.   I'm not doing anything to make my hair more curly than it naturally is, but I would like it to last for more than a day so I don't have to wash my hair every time I want it to look nice."
curlyhair,3dv4n6,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"Mousse doesn't offer a whole lot of hold. A stronger hold gel will get you to second and third day hair. Don't worry! Gel doesn't make it super crunchy, especially if you layer it with a leave-in conditioner."

curlyhair,3dv4n6,curlyhair_pandabear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"It's totally fine if you wash your hair often, that's not against CG. I wash every single day or my hair is a limp, lifeless, tangled mess! The main thing with CG is cutting out sulfates and silicones in your shampoo and conditioner.     I would agree with our Cheese moderator that you need a stronger hold gel. I think those of us in the high 2/low 3 range need some extra help to hold the shape. I just started using EcoStyler and really like it - others I've liked are the curling custards from either MopTop or Kinky Curly.    You can also try spritzing your 2nd/3rd day hair with a mixture of water and conditioner, then scrunching a little bit. That doesn't work for me personally, but I know other curlies in this sub do it and it works for them to revive their curls."
curlyhair,3dvgei,Mollicle,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"Hey I can absolutely relate to your problem. I got nearly the same hair: 3A to 3B curls absolutely thick, shoulder length. After using one kind of cg conditioner for max. 2 months my curls are starting to hang out and stop reacting to the moisture. In this situations I switch to one conditioner I am pretty sure my hair likes. My only solution so far is switching between 3 to 4 conditoners during a year, but in order to find out which conditioner my curls liked I had to spend an insane amount of money to find out.  So I am sorry, but I don't have a solution for you."

I use L'Oreal EverCurl shampoo and conditioner. I detangle in the shower and leave a little conditioner in it since my hair dries out easily. I wrap it up in an old tshirt and get ready for the day. While it's still damp, I add a light layer of Creme of Nature's Milk Masque (proceed with caution, too much weights down hair), then I add Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Gel to the ends so they don't separate. If I don't, my hair looks like a Christmas Tree. I just air dry and separate some of the curls if they dry too clumped up. Then I pineapple at night :)"

For those who are protein-sensitive, or simply use too much, it can cause the opposite effect - dry, brittle strands, and possibly increase breakage.    My hair loves-loves-loves protein, and I use Kerastase at home. Works great! I've also heard good things about Joico K-Pak, but haven't tried it myself. I immediately follow it up protein treatments with deep conditioning. Deep conditioners are designed to provide moisture (which helps combat frizz), and are essential after a protein treatment since they can be drying."

curlyhair,3dtw3v,LuFRport,2,Sun Jul 19 12:32:38 2015 UTC,"The fact that your hair is shorter on the sides and back will actually help you a lot - my immediate reaction when I saw your ""now"" picture was that you have the perfect style of pixie cut to help you grow it out.  The reason for this is that the worst parts about growing out a pixie are: (1) the dreaded mullet effect which results from the fact that our back hairline goes down lower than the front hairline, obviously, and (2) if you have a lot of hair/thick hair, the density of it all concentrated in such a small area which leads to ""puffiness.""   Having an undercut the way you have it will prevent both, as the top, long section will look like it's growing faster than everywhere else simply because it is longer than the rest of your hair. This means that you could end up looking like you have a bob when the top part is grown out when in reality, the rest of your hair still needs to grow out. And it will prevent your burgeoning bob from taking on the ""triangle"" shape.   I'm currently growing out a pixie myself and trust me when I say it's much harder to grow it out all uniformly. If I wasn't in a conservative profession, I would totally get an undercut similar to yours."
curlyhair,3dtw3v,HuntyBooBoo,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I didn't even think about the fact that it would turn into a Bob eventually. That helps so much. When I was growing it out a few years ago uniformly, it was a nightmare and I looked like a brillo pad.   And I really hope that the fact that much hair is SO dense helps me rather than hurts me. I just need to figure out how to style it throughout the process so I don't go insane. I've tried to Google styles for the different stages but it's such a niche thing I can't find much. Knowing its better to have length on top is definitely comforting though.   And ugh, I'm so sorry that you don't have the freedom to do what you want with your hair.

My first round of blood tests came back normal even though I feel something's wrong. I have more tests coming up this week. I lost about half of my hair as well, most people wouldn't notice but it is heartbreaking. Last week my grandma told me she can see it's thinner because my scalp came through a bit and it destroyed me. It's been like this for years now. I keep my hair in a braid, it's very long. I'm trying to keep it as healthy as possible by never wearing it down, that way, when they find out what's wrong with me, I'll hopefully just get a fuller head of hair again rather than having to worry about length as well. It's so thin my curls fall out anyway. I just try to stay positive even though it's hard as I lose at least 70 hairs every time I wash it. (And that's what I was able to count, it's more in reality) It's all I can do for now. Hopefully they can figure it out and help me.   I feel your pain. You're not alone in your struggle. They tell us not to stress about it, but it's easier said than done. Doctors don't really care as long as your blood is healthy. Your friends and family tell you you're imagining it and then one day all of a sudden they ask where your hair went in a very harsh way. Washing hair is something you try to avoid....

I recognize the way they look from me being bored and twisting my curls during idle times.  What helps is if you notice which way your curls are curling. Work WITH the direction they are going. If you don't, you end up unwinding the natural curl and forcing them into an unnatural shape.  Think of your curls like the coil of a slinky. You tighten the slinky, in the same direction it's coiled not much happens. You tighten the slinky in the opposite direction of the coil you end up with that weird twist that doesn't seem to go away. The curls get that same twist in them, which is what happened here."

curlyhair,3do32i,AtomicPenny,5,Sat Jul 18 03:51:26 2015 UTC,I've had this happen too... What helps for me is to try to think of it more like the pincurl method. You want to coil the curl in the same sort of shape it's already making instead of twisting it.   Coiling my curls a little tighter than they naturally coil makes pretty ringlets. Extra twist tends to make my hair do exactly this.

I definitely notice results when it's mixed with bleach though - less breakage and stronger-feeling hair afterwards. So that's where I buy into the hype... great for coloring, not so great by itself.   Based on your experience with it, I suspect that the standalone treatment has a (super top secret) ingredient in it that's pulling your curls out. I haven't used it in quite some time, and when I did, my hair was being straightened, so I don't know how my curls were impacted.

curlyhair,3dpq7s,schfiftyfivedubloons,3,Sat Jul 18 06:34:18 2015 UTC,"when you say ""break your hair"" what do you mean exactly, like what is your hair texture like with these conditioners? is it too dry and brittle, or is it too soft and not strong enough?   I've had both happen to me. lots of conditioners that other curly girls swore by were way too full of oils and waxes — my hair doesn't play well with those. they weighed my hair down and destroyed all definition, making it feel greasy and lank. too much moisture can be a bad thing!   on the flip side, if your hair feels like straw, you probably have too much protein going on. anything that contains keratin or a similar ingredient could make your hair feel dry.   my personal holy grail conditioner right now is Tresemme Naturals. it's pretty cheap, no silicones, and has (for me anyway) the perfect balance of moisture and strength.   what's your hair type? how thick/coarse is it? my hair is 3a-3b, very thick, and mildly coarse in its top layer and more fine underneath. if your hair is similar at all to mine, I definitely recommend giving Tresemme Naturals a try."

curlyhair,3dn3s3,sassycatmeow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't meant to imply that the cause of your looser top-layer was dryness. However, it does look like the canopy is drier, not just looser. It's a really common problem, especially for wavies, because your top layers get the most abuse being exposed to the elements. My canopy is also the driest part of my hair. I have to add extra conditioner to it in the shower and I make sure to spray some diluted curl creme over the top before I use my other products.  Do you leave your conditioner in a bit when you shower? The key to frizz-free curls is moisturizing and sealing. So you want a product, like leave-in conditioner, to hydrate and a gel or mousse to seal in the moisture. Wavies usually need a curl activator in the mix too, for more bounce."

Deva Curl products I use for maintenance: Mist-er Right curl revitalizer (smells amazing!), Spray Gel, and Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam. Deva Curl can be expensive. For a cheaper alternative, try Garnier's curl shaping spray gel. I don't necessarily use all three products at the same time. I used the mist when I just need a quick touch up (maybe I tossed and turned a lot). The spray gel I use on my top canopy if I actually need to reshape any of the curls. The Volumizer works wonders on my under layer which is usually what loses its frizz. It also works great for fixing frizzing ends."

I did that until I totally grew out my dyed bits (I lost interest in dyeing my hair, I don't know if you still love to dye but either way, the Herbal Essences is what worked for me) and now that I have all ""virgin hair"" I'm going cone free and it's great so far. never experienced any buildup with Herbal Essences, me and my hair were happy."
curlyhair,3dlf37,backseatredditor,2,Sat Jul 18 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"Silicones in products (but not conditioner or shampoo) actually seem to agree with my hair.  I notice more of a benefit when it's humid and/or hot outside, so I'll probably discontinue in the winter. I use a sulfate-free shampoo about 2 times per week, and co-wash about every other day, and haven't had problems with build up.  Maybe give it a couple weeks before revisiting the silicones, to establish a baseline and let your hair & scalp equilibrate before trying something new."
curlyhair,3dlf37,AGhostLP,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've done it for 2 months. Hair just looks awful :( mushy when it's wet, tangled straw when it's dry."

curlyhair,3dlf37,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:03 2015 UTC,I don't know whether i need protein or moisture but I haven't used that product yet so it's not that.
curlyhair,3dlf37,hashtagphag,2,Fri Jul 17 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"Yikes, read a couple other comments you posted before replying.     mushy when it's wet, tangled straw when it's dry Bleach/color damage     Mushy when wet... are you talking about a soft, almost gummy feeling, like overcooked noodles or wet pumpkin innards? Or is it more squishy, like an old wet kitchen sponge? Either way, your hair is fried, I'm just asking to determine exactly how much.      I'm in the same boat, I'm afraid. Hair is dead, and once we've blown open and destroyed the cuticle like this, nothing will restore it to health except for cutting it off. For damage control in the meantime, here's what I do:    2-3 times a week, use a protein/keratin treatment on the bleached parts. Use the treatment as-directed, don't overdo it or you'll get worse with the tangled-straw feeling. The protein is to help give our hair some resemblance of strength and integrity so it doesn't break off in our hands. Afterwards, use a deep conditioning treatment for as long as humanly possible. If I'm using it on the weekends, I sleep with it in, otherwise I leave it on 2-3 hours. This is to help give our hair some resemblance of moisture and softness.    After a while, you can cut down the protein treatments to once a week, and deep conditioning to 1-2 times a week. I gauge when to do so based on my hair feeling a bit stronger, and losing the sickening gummy feeling. Most recently, that took me three solid weeks, and I was alternating treatments every other day!     To your other question though, about your hair seeming worse after cutting out silicones... yup, I'm right there with you. My theory is that the silicones were just masking the damage, almost like plastic wrap around the strands. Once they were gone, the true nature of our hair was revealed. I'm of the belief that time (ie haircuts) will heal all wounds though. We just gotta wait it out and stop damaging our hair. I dunno about you, but after this last round of bleaching, I'm done. No more fancy follicles for me."

I recently got a short haircut which has caused small waves to sort of start to exist, but because I have never styles curls all my life, I have no idea what I am doing! I use Carols Daughter shampoo and conditioner as well as their leave in conditioner. What else to use is the issue. I tried scrunching with mousse after a shower but the curls get kind of clumpy and fall as my hair dries. I also tried Marc Anthony's strictly curls defining lotion and I found it did NOTHING. I really don't want to use heat, but does anyone have any suggestions for any way my curls can be wearable? Are they just destined to be loose and frizzy and maybe my haircut isn't working out? Please help!"
curlyhair,3dfq5i,humblebwonderful,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like you need to lay off the shampoo and just do conditioner washes. Maybe one shampoo a week or even two. Also no brush and in my personal experience dying it messes up the curls. Plopping tends to create a mess of weird not quite curly but messy and bent waves. I never cared for plopping. Also mousse is bad and just separates curls and makes it dry and crunchy. Try this: use conditioner only in the shower. Scrub up your scalp with it, just because it doesn't lather doesn't mean it's not getting clean. Squeeze most of the water out with hands. Then finger comb/rake it out with a small amount of conditioner ( dime size or nickel?). Get out of the shower and don't touch it at all until it dries. Try this method every day and after a few days to a week I think you'll really notice a difference. If you find the conditioner too heavy, use less or try a tiny amount of coconut oil, same method. If you go for the coconut oil, get a dime size amount and apply it while soaking wet, during squeezing out the water in the shower. Then do a gentle finger rake. Most important? Don't brush or mess with it while it's wet and don't dry it with a towel. And don't shampoo every time you shower. Any Q's feel free to ask!"

We rarely put shampoo in his hair(only after beach days or when he gets sticky stuff in his hair, and then it's no-poo). We use Suave Naturals for conditioner- my husband is also a curly and we go through that stuff like water.   We do baths every other night and what we do is get his hair good and wet and then put conditioner on it and comb it through with a wide tooth comb. I leave it in while I wash him and he plays, and rinse it out last. He sleeps on his wet hair, but I wish we did bathtime in the morning because the back gets dry sometimes.   If it needs refreshed I have a spray bottle with a conditioner/water solution in it that I douse his hair in and then comb through.   If you do nothing else, please don't brush her hair! I saw a little curly girl the other day whose mom had quite obviously brushed out her gorgeous curls and left them a mess. Only comb it, and only when it is really wet(preferably with conditioner).   And ignore your family- my husband's family is constantly nagging me to cut our son's hair military short and I refuse to give in!!

I don't know if you use shampoo currently but I do use a teeny amount, about a tablespoon, any more than that and my hair gets frizzy and angry. Your hair will dry a lot faster now so you'll have less time to tame it with product before it starts to do its own wacky thing; I hop out of the shower, squeeze my hair with a t-shirt for a sec, then use a large pea sized dollop of Bumble & Bumble's Curl Conscious gel. Once it's dried a little I use pomade to shape it, staying away from my roots. If you want to play up your curls without frizziness, try a diffuser for a minute or two.  Lastly I use and LOVE Awapuhi texturizing spray, it has a little hold without being greasy.  I also used to wear headbands or cute decorative bobby pins when I was feeling fancy!"

curlyhair,3deqcx,zensquared,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, how long did you try CG? Also what were a couple of the conditioners you tried? I had similar issues when I first started so maybe I can help out.   On to the when to shampoo question: before I went full CG, I'd co wash with dimethicone, but I tended to get very oily at the sides of my head after a week. So every week I'd shampoo with a regular shampoo only on the edge of my face, sides, and nape of my neck. Then the next week I would need a full shampoo. Every time I shampooed I would deep condition that night."
curlyhair,3deqcx,ShortWide,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:22 2015 UTC,"I've been on CG exclusively for about a month, and I've only tried a couple conditioners so far (vo5 Herbal Escapes Clarifying, Shea Moisture Restorative, and every so often I'd deep condition with Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque). At first it wasn't too bad but the longer I did the same routine, the worse my canopy got. The curls pretty much fell apart and started frizzing as soon as I got out of theshower. So a little fed up I went back to Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner and I really like the results.  My main problem is that 2nd day curls just aren't working for me so I've had to cowash every day. Even if I have a great hair day, the day after everything falls apart and gets stringy and frizzy even using a pineapple. This ends up getting very expensive with the higher end conditioners so I haven't been able to experiment as much.  Thanks for your help!"
curlyhair,3deqcx,ShortWide,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"I got stringy results with VO5 but my favorite is Suave naturals. I'm 3a now that I've been mostly CG since December. I say mostly because I've found I get a little stringy and limp when I don't wash with a sulfate shampoo once a month. I started as 2b then I started co washing with dimethicone conditioner and used the routine I described briefly earlier. It took about two months (one month cowash dimethicone and one month all CG) but I went from 2b to 3a.  I don't know your type or porosity so I can't give more specifics though.   2nd day curls -  I've managed to be successful when I use L'Oreal curl gel (I can't recall the name but it has a blue/white swirl pattern in it) and lots of conditioner (Suave Naturals Coconut). The first day I pile on the conditioner and then enough gel to cover most of my hair. I turban my hair with a mircofiber until I'm dressed and makeup is on. After, I diffuse on Med heat and low speed. This gives me optimal curls and least amount of frizz. The diffuser is key for me to keep my curls more than a day. Then I sleep pineapple-d after a day of wear and the next day I spritz my hair and squish a bit some with 40/60 conditioner and water mix. If I wake up and they look too bad, I spritz more and diffuse again."
curlyhair,3deqcx,ShortWide,2,Wed Jul 15 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I will definitely try out the products you mentioned. I've been trying to avoid heat styling but if it will help me achieve the best results, I'm ready to give it a shot.   I originally thought I was 2b/2c, but I'm actually starting to see some definite 3a curls form. I also think I'm med or high porosity, but that part is kind of lost on me. The level of science involved in this curl business is overwhelming."
curlyhair,3deqcx,vanewho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:06:13 2015 UTC,"Well I'm medium porosity and I can still kind of use gobs of conditioner without greasiness/oiliness. Also if you want to avoid heat, diffuse on cool with like a medium speed. I usually do that in the summer just because I'm too hot otherwise."
curlyhair,3deqcx,backseatredditor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:04 2015 UTC,It really is overwhelming! I just started this myself and I have no idea what I'm doing.
curlyhair,3deqcx,vonlowe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"Me too.  Lately, with all the humidity, I tried Ouidad climate control heat & humidity gel, which contains a couple different 'cones, and Garnier Fructis anti frizz serum (which is basically straight up dimethicone), and it's been very nice.  I use the silicone containing gel as the last product to go on right after washing (or co-washing), and the anti-frizz serum only occasionally, and only on dry hair.  And I still only shampoo (with sulfate-free shampoo, like Shea Moisture, or KC Come Clean) like 2x a week, and co-wash about every other day.  I think for me, as long as the silicone isn't in the conditioner it's fine.  And if your hair has low porosity (like mine seems to be), you can probably get away with never needing the sulfate shampoo to clarify.  So maybe for you, 'cones in your conditioner is no problem.  When you start to notice build up on your scalp or limp, heavy hair, try a sulfate shampoo to see if it resets everything."
curlyhair,3dg8yv,Talima,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"None of those are a gel, though I've read that the Smoothie pairs excellently with the Gel Souffle of the same line, so it probably has a bit more hold on its own than the other products.  You could use them all at once, but it's up to you. If used together, I'd say do the Milk before the Smoothie, following the LOC method (liquid, oil, cream) but without any oil. The Mist would be used last, yeah, though you might also/alternatively use it as a second/third/etc. day refresher.   As for how dry your hair is when applying, that's really up to you. You can experiment with the dampness of your hair- personally, I put all my product in when my hair is soaking wet, and that works well for me."

Anyways to keep my hair moisturized I leave a lot of conditioner in my hair, I just just rinse my scalp and the runoff from that usually rinses out some conditioner, I usually put another squirt of it in after I've squished out excess water.  I then spritz a little oil in there (Shea Moisture's kind with the brownish label), then add LA Looks gel to lock everything in.    I've heard breakage can occur from really tight hair styles, but I can totally relate to wanting to keep your hair up and off you in the hot sun!  What I've been doing lately is a really high bun, that way it isn't pulling the hair at the top of my head back so much.  French braids sound good, but just maybe not too tight?  Idk, I don't really French braid my hair because it's too layered and the curls always pop out of the braids!  I honestly don't use any UV protection on my hair.  My hair isn't colored, and it is much lighter in the summer than in the winter, but as long as I keep lots of moisture in it with leave in and a teeny bit of oil (oh and weekly deep conditioning masques again from Shea Moisture, again with the brownish label), it does fine!"
curlyhair,3dgeot,vonlowe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"I second the French plait! I love it for getting hair off my neck, although I live in a more humid environment. If you want to switch it up you can try a Dutch plait which is the same as a French plait but you take the strands under each other rather than over. Also you can do it loosely, I have fine hair so it falls easily, if you don't use a brush when making it, that'll help with keeping it looser. Or you could experiment with different ways of clipping it with clips!"

I can get away with leaving my hair for 6 days between washings with this stuff. And the conditioner is perfect for squish to condish if you use that method.  I've also used the No Frizz Leave in Conditioner and that works well too. The No Frizz line seems to be popular with curlies (at least according to the Sephora reviews).  They also have a new line of curl products but there aren't too many reviews yet. I have a few of those products too that I need to try out and review still.

curlyhair,3dcb2q,ElectricTessla,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:55 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like you may have buildup, but since you're early into CG, I could be mistaken.     What was your prior routine? Did you use a clarifying and/or sulfate shampoo before going CG? What's your current routine?   Also, I notice your flair says you're color-treated. Can you explain more about that? Are you bleaching, dyeing, or both, and how often?"
curlyhair,3dcb2q,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:04:39 2015 UTC,"Before CG I used Bed Head Shampoo and Conditioner or Marc Anthony Shampoo and Conditioner. My final wash before CG was with the Marc Anthony Shampoo (with the sulfates) and with Shea Moisture Restorative Conditioner.   My current routine is:   Biotin (1000 mcg) supplement 1x daily Coconut Oil left in hair overnight the night before I shower (This once a week, I shower about twice a week. The two pictures with the pink top are taken on Day 1 after a shower with a coconut oil treatment the night before) Wash with Shea Moisture Moisture Retention Shampoo Use wide toothed comb to comb out my hair in the shower, then Condition with Shea Moisture Restorative Conditioner Apply Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Milk after showers where I haven't done the coconut oil the night before Plopping for ~20 min, then let hair air dry   I no longer bleach or dye my hair, but you can see the slight Orange tinge from where I bleached a small part of the underside last summer. A lot of it had major breakage and fell off, so it's no where near the majority of my hair, but I figured I should include that some of it was color treated before."
curlyhair,3dcb2q,hashtagphag,2,Wed Jul 15 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"Even though you've color-treated, I don't think it's that, considering how much is your normal hair. I suspect you may be using products that are too heavy for you. That's definitely a danger zone with long-hair curlies who have thinner strands and/or less density.   My first guess is the direct coconut oil, especially since your hair is so straight in the 2 ""pink top"" pictures. Coconut oil is fine, but maybe you should leave it in for a few hours rather than overnight. Also, regarding conditioner/products, those may be a little too heavy. I haven't tried the SheaMo Milk, just the Smoothie. I have to be very careful with it though... it gives me fantastic bounce and volume, but it's very easy to overdo it and get product-heavy. Perhaps you could continue with the SheaMo conditioners, but switch to a lightweight gel or a mousse instead of the SheaMo Milk?    Whatever you end up doing, change up just one thing at a time so you can see what product is giving which effect. I really do suspect the coconut oil though. Your third picture looks way better and curlier than your day one hair from the first/second photos."
curlyhair,3dcb2q,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the third one was after the Milk as opposed to the Coconut Oil. Thanks so much for the advice! I think (at least while I'm starting) I'll try and not use it and see if that helps, then use it again if my hair starts to dry out again once it's used to CG!"
curlyhair,3dcb2q,Curly_Alice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Also, if you want to try changing out the coconut oil, I'm a huge fan of SheaMo's Raw Shea Butter Deep Conditioner. I've tried a couple other lines of their DC, but that one is my favorite so far. My hair feels super soft and hydrated afterwards, even with all the damage I've done to it ;)"

My hair was fine two Sunday's ago, I washed my hair with the products I have been using for months, but my curls separated and straightened.

curlyhair,3dbuyo,PinkleopardPJ,6,Wed Jul 15 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'd bet on hormone-related. When I went through puberty my hair went from probably 2C/3A curls to frizzy, oily 2B waves... They got even straighter when I got pregnant. My hair also goes through phases where it seems to ""behave"" better, and then sometimes it gets ridiculous. But hormones can play a role in all kinds of things. And since you mention acne too, that sounds like it could be related as well."

curlyhair,3dbuyo,hashtagphag,3,Wed Jul 15 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"My first guess is ambient temperature and humidity. My second guess is hormones, like /u/PinkleapoardPJ says.  My third guess is vitamins.       Any changes with any of these in the past month? No matter how short-term, even a matter of days, any changes?   In any case, I would recommend that you stop clarifying... you've already done it a few times, there's no need to do it any further. Extra efforts with it will cause more drying and curl-separation."
curlyhair,3dbuyo,ImaCheeseMonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:10:40 2015 UTC,I'm not washing my hair for quite a few days just to give it a break. My face is starting to break out out of nowhere.

For dryness, you could do a coconut oil treatment once a week- it REALLY helps hydrate my hair and make it less dead. Apply it to your hair before bed, cover with a shirt, and wash out in your morning shower!  I also take biotin supplements and I find they've been helping.

I hadn’t had it above my shoulders in over 10 years, so I went in for a chop a couple weeks ago. I’m still adjusting; and I miss putting up my crazy pineapple, but I’m wearing it down more often now & the length is great for summer. Note: I color-adjusted two of the pictures, because my hair is dark & you couldn’t see the curls in the originals.  Now on to routine. My method from the before pic to the after pics hasn’t changed dramatically, but I am trying some new things out. So I will just give you guys the routine for the After pictures, which is my hair today & is technically  3rd day hair. I wash twice a week at night except on weekends.    Cleanse scalp with Nizoral (only non-CG product, but it’s a must). Coat ends & length with Suave Naturals Coconut. Rinse everything out after a few minutes. Pile on gobs of Tresemme Perfectly Undone Conditioner (first time using it, new HG) Detangle, removing loose hair. Give everything a good shake when tangles are gone. S2C, leaving in lots of the conditioner. (This is what I wasn’t doing in the Before pic. I hardly left any in)  Get out of the shower, press hair up to scalp with a microfiber towel, removing a bit of water. Arrange part, then flip everything over. Scrunch in a quarter size dollop of SM Curl Enhancing Smoothie.  Plop with microfiber towel for about an hour. Remove plop. Clips in front. Air dry completely.   Freshen up 2nd & 3rd day curls with SM Hold & Shine spray and Tresemme Radiant Volume diluted in a squirt bottle.   I don’t always have time to air dry completely. On a week night, I have to diffuse dry so I can put it up in a pineapple & sleep, because air drying takes pretty much all day.  I like to try different products. In the Before pic I styled with SM Curl & Style Milk & Curls Curl Goddess gel, and I like both of those products. I also have tried both Tresemme Naturals conditioners & like them; but after using Undone, I’ll probably stick with that. I am reassessing my judgment of the SM Smoothie, which I haven’t really liked but used on a whim this last time & now I like it."

curlyhair,3d2t06,missfarthing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Assateague. It's a barrier island off the coasts of VA and MD. The extra fun part is that it's a national park so you can camp,  there are wild ponies,  and you can have campfires and such   They have different sections so you can have different levels of mother nature bonding time.  Some areas let you drive up your car and have indoor bathrooms and power.   Others have Porta potties and outdoor shower stalls.    Great beach,  though.  Beautiful white sand.  So dark at night you can see the stars and constellations clear as anything.  We went during the full moon and it lit the beach up for late night walks when it was out. You could go for miles if you wanted. The ponies would come down and chill on the beach at night. So amazing.    Only downside -  muggy and lots of bugs,  including horse flies that hurt when they bite."

When I went for my devacut it was something I mentioned, and he was able to cut accordingly so it's less of an issue now. My hair looked a lot like yours before I had a cut, this is it pre and post"

In very humid conditions, you might do better with an antihumectant gel to keep the humidity out of your hair(frizz). There are two cheap CG gels in the drugstore: Aussie Instant Freeze gel and Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel. Give it a try! :)"

I did that all the time when I had really long hair - making one big braid and then coiling it up into a bun takes way less hairpins and is way less damaging then just making a bun with a rubber band! and braid are super in right now so you can find loads of tutorials for fancier styles.

It's probably the products and having someone brush trough your hair.    My hairdresser uses Redken and it just completely destroys my curls. Even when using their curly products they fall apart, it could be something like that. I don't think it's the Olaplex. Give it a few washes, it'll go back to normal.  Give the conditioning treatment a go with your own products after it's gone back to normal. I've seen a few cases where it's made the curls stand out more. Worth a try."

curlyhair,3cwval,Frose91,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Olaplex works by reconstructing the bonds in your hair, similar to but definitely not exactly like say, a Brazilian blowout.  You might need to wait a week or so for your hair to ""relax"" back into its normal curl pattern.  And a small side note: I use Redken on my hair pretty frequently, and have noticed no ill effects.  A hair stylist isn't going to be styling your hair the same way you do at home, so it may just be the way the stylist manipulated your strands.  EDIT: A Brazilian blowout works by essentially breaking the bonds, and then rehardening in them in the new, straight pattern.  Olaplex rehardens/recontructs the bonds, making the hair stronger and less likely to break."
curlyhair,3cwval,catcatherine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:07:28 2015 UTC,"Redken just doesn't work with my hair. I'm definitely not saying it's a bad brand as I do love their dye, I guess their products are just too heavy for my very thin hair, or maybe there's another reason. I tried using them at home as well (with my own way of styling my hair) but it's a disaster. Normally I have about 10 to 12 clumps that form curls, and they stay that way. With Reken those clumps fall apart and it becomes a complete unruly mess. Oh well, I know what works for me and that's the only thing that matters in the end."

curlyhair,3culmd,Shinsforthewins,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"Basically just grab a small section of wet hair starting along your part, push it up so that it makes a rainbow from the root, and slide a clip into it. You want to make sure the clip is standing up on its side and only partially opened so that you don't create weird dents in your hair. You can add a clip wherever you want volume. Just remove them once your hair is dry.   You can also use clips to mask cowlicks. I have a couple at the back of my head that make my scalp show. So, my stylist told me to take small pieces of hair from both sides of the cowlick and clip them together. It works great!"

She then scrunched while holding the scrunch for 5 seconds. She did this to my entire head until no water came out. Then we did an air-hood dry.   Side note: I don't think I will be trying the rake and shake again until I get the hang of a good product routine.  As for styling I still round brushed my bangs today - they went a little wacky last night. But I generally wear my hair completely down or half up as seen in the photos. It looked a lot better twisting the sides that I pulled up which you can see in the last photo. Other then that I am still trying to figure it out! haha. Anything on youtube is either non-CG friendly advice (ex: combing while dry, really nasty products,etc.) or is how to get wavy hair for straight haired peoples; so the options for tutorials are pretty limited."
curlyhair,3cu4uk,MarianneDashwood,4,Fri Jul 10 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"I agree about rake and shake-- I just don't think it's a great option for 2's! I did it for a while because I liked the evenness of the gel distribution and the volume, but the ends looked weird and the curl pattern looked off. I think I basically looked like I was always about to film an 80's step aerobics video."

curlyhair,3cu4uk,monstres,3,Sat Jul 11 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"Ah I've been applying gel wrong apparently! I usually just take gobs of it, rub my palms together and scrunch it in. Probably why it's never applied evenly. This makes a lot of sense! And yeah I completely get what you mean about the lack of tutorials on youtube for wavies. I get really frustrated when I think I've found a good video and then it turns out that the youtuber isn't CG friendly  at all, or doesn't even have a curl pattern. Ugh so frustrating to find CG videos of type 2!"

It has a huge amount of helpful information, especially for beginners.  Curly Girl Method, the method many subscribers (myself included) here use, actually discourages the use of shampoo entirely due to the harshness of sulfates, and instead focuses on cleansing with conditioner (silicone-free or else you will actually need a sulfate cleanser), which is far gentler. If you do shampoo, it's suggested you use a sulfate-free one.  As for oils, that really depends on what you want it for. Some oils penetrate hair (coconut), but most don't and will instead seal the cuticle, if I remember correctly."

I'm around a 2c/3a if I really bothered to encourage my curl (pretty healthy, medium thickness, lowish porosity). She spent a lot of time shaping my hair and making cut adjustments and making sure the curls lay properly after she washed it and styled it curly. Also very collaborative and great about asking what I wanted and listening to me! Not afraid to do conventional or unconventional/more creative cuts! Didn't push product on me or anything.

And that's how I thought you were posing to show off your arms :D"
curlyhair,3cwsqw,harowkun,3,Sat Jul 11 13:29:44 2015 UTC,"Try putting some coconut oil in your ends. I have a spray of coconut oil and water I put in my hair when it's still wet, then I add some extra pure oil in my ends. I don't wash it out, it stays in and doesn't look greasy. Prevents split ends and keeps it moisturised.  Nizoral is very drying. If you use it for medical reasons, there isn't much you can do. Talk to your derm/doctor about it. If it's just for dandruff, try adding pure tea tree oil to your regular shampoo instead."
curlyhair,3cwsqw,Frose91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"Nizoral is for seborrheic dermatitis. I only use it once a week and try concentrating on the scalp, but could it still be damaging the hair?  Checked again twice and also asked my mom's opinion; she doesn't think the ends are split either. She says I should trim them, but then it'll set back my hair growth in like 3 months..."
curlyhair,3cwsqw,Frose91,2,Sat Jul 11 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can definitely still be making your hair dry. When rinsing, the Nizoral still runs over the length of your hair along with the water. It's unavoidable. If your hair is naturally dry, the Nizoral probably is making it worse. The ingredients in Nizoral are great for skin conditions and things like that, but they're not that good for the health of your hair. If you need the Nizoral, keep using it though. An unhealthy scalp results in unhealthy hair, so it's definitely important to take care of your scalp before anything else. That's why Nizoral is considered so good, if the benefits of a healthy scalp are bigger than the negatives like Nizoral making your hair dry, it is definitely worth it for most people.  Try the coconut oil spray! Just put some coconut oil and water in a spray bottle and spray it in after rinsing out the conditioner. It has helped me loads! Maybe also do a hair mask once a week. See what it says after giving that a go. If it stays that bad, maybe your doctor has some suggestions. You never know, maybe they have something else that can help with the seborrheic dermatitis that doesn't dry out your scalp and hair, or maybe they have seen this before and know how to balance it out a bit better."
curlyhair,3cwsqw,Frose91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about using coconut oil for some time now, but always decided to delay it until my hair got longer. I guess now is the time to try it out, though. Is using it as a weekly deep conditioner + spray too much?  Well, Nizoral does suck the oil out of my hair, but it saved my scalp. Before Nizoral I had dandruff scales all over my head, itching like crazy and shedding like a Christmas night.  Do you think the wax can have anything to do with it? I remember someone saying in a forum elsewhere that the L'Oreal Txt Wax made their hair feel like straw.  Anywho, thanks a bunch. I got a little worried that my hair could get really worse (and I hope not), and I want to avoid trimming it until at least I'm able to tie it up. I'll be sure to try out the coconut oil."
curlyhair,3cwsqw,Unicorn_Specialist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"I don't use it as a conditioning treatment as my hair is very fine and it just doesn't work at all. It dries it out even more and I can't make it look good for days after doing a conditioning with coconut oil. Too much protein I guess. Spraying it in every time I've washed it gives it just enough protection and moisture to keep it healthy. It really depends on your hair though, give it a go and see how it reacts to it. If your hair needs more protein than mine, it may just be what you need. Just don't overdo it. If you overdo something good, it tends to become something bad. Start out slow and if it isn't enough, build it up.  As for the wax, to know if the wax is causing it, simply wash your hair and don't put it in. If it stops feeling like that after one or two washes, it was the wax causing it. You'll notice it straight away. One wash should do, but test it for two just to be sure."
curlyhair,3cwsqw,suite-dee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:59:59 2015 UTC,I would just go for a trim. I know you're trying to grow out your hair but getting a trim will make it look considerably healthier. My ends get dry and thin like yours every once in a while and a haircut really helps.
curlyhair,3cwsqw,backseatredditor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:35:14 2015 UTC,Thing is I think the trim would set me back some 3 months of growth. Then what if it happened again 3 months later?
curlyhair,3cstdz,janetplanet,5,Fri Jul 10 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"This is three days after having it done at the salon, so it's not my usual routine or products. The stylist used the Color Proof TruCurl line. She used the shampoo, conditioner, instant detangler, anti-frizz oil, curl perfecting creme, and HumidityRx anti-frizz hair spray. All she did after washing was finger curl a few bits, stick me under a dryer hood, and scunch it a little. I've dampened it in the mornings, and twisted any curls flattened during sleep. I clip the bangs at the roots to give a bit of lift, other wise they fall in my eyes. The routine is really easy."

curlyhair,3cthra,Liakada,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:02:25 2015 UTC,"Plopping too long can flatten some wavy hair. Basically whatever shape your hair is put in into the plop, it will keep and it's hard to make sure everything is positioned correctly especially when sleeping on it.   Try plopping for less than half an hour, take the plop out, and give your hair the freedom to find its shape and curl pattern while air drying. This might require you to wash hair in the morning instead."

It works just as well for most. If not for you, maybe a low-sulfate shampoo? Tresseme makes one and it's pretty cheap). I use cheap conditioner. Like, I use Suave or V05. V05 is under a dollar.  They're both sulfate- and silicone-free.  Add lots more conditioner. looots. Again, I use cheap (tresseme naturals). LOTS LOTS LOTS. I do not wash it out, but I have very dry hair. Some people wash out and then add leave-in. Rake in gel. (You can use your mousse instead; I use gel 'cause I attempt to tame my halo of frizz). Rake rake rake. Comb with shower comb. Then I scrunch to make the curls. Lots of scrunching. Air dry or plop (if you don't know what plopping is, I can find a pic online or explain) DO NOT TOUCH UNTIL 100% DRY. Some people have luck using a diffuser, but it makes my hair frizzy. :(   Then when I sleep, I either use a satin cap or pineapple (I can also post pictures or explain if you don't know what this is)  Not sure if any of this will help, but hope it helps some :)"

After I plop and diffuse it as dry as possible with my head upside down, I clip the roots up to keep drying during my hour commute. I think the volume has to do with letting it completely dry with the clips in. Then I flip it over to fluff it up and part it on whatever side looks the best/biggest.

As for routine, I am still experimenting to find what consistently work. S2C with suave naturals coconut, comb in the shower, apply Ouidad mousse at the roots, squish boots curl cream into the length, and squish Eco styler gel into the length. (Also playing around with Eco curl cream and diva curl gel.) I use lots of gel. So much I start to think it's too much gel. Then plop in a shirt for about 20 minutes. Next diffuse the length and roots upside down. Then clip the roots up during my commute -  it is an hour of driving with the fans pointed to my head. It is pretty dry by the time I get to work. I get out of the car flip my hair over, kind of ""fluff"" the roots and part it to the side that makes it look the biggest."

curlyhair,3cpb0d,Teddybeaar,7,Thu Jul 9 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"I find a lot of the products and recommendations for curly hair are not that great for wavy hair. They're too heavy and thick.  I live in Atlanta, so you can imagine it's hot and humid and a terrible place for wavy hair.   I like Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Finishing Paste. It takes a lot of the frizz out of my hair.  I also make a hair oil with sunflower oil. It's lighter than a lot of other oils, and I only use a few drops each day. I just got ISO Bouncy Creme, because I see it recommended by a number of wavies. It's not supposed to make your hair crunchy. It just came today, so I haven't tried it yet.  There's a blogger on Youtube called Polished Curl who has wavy/wurly hair, and she gives a lot of product recommendations and tutorials."
curlyhair,3cpb0d,lynnb496,3,Thu Jul 9 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"Check out these links from the sidebar; they're good starting places to figure out what your hair type is, and how to introduce changes in your routine:   The Wiki Curl Type     In general though, wash your hair one last time with a shampoo that contains sulfates, then change your products. Get a sulfate-free shampoo, a silicone-free conditioner, and styling products (leave-in conditioner, and a gel/mousse/cream). The styling products should also be silicone-free.    Here's a list of products that other curlies have had success with. Not all of them are 100% CG-approved though."
curlyhair,3cpb0d,hashtagphag,3,Thu Jul 9 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"One thing i'd add to the great advice you've already gotten: don't be afraid of crunchy hair. Gel helps curls and waves clump together as hair dries, and once it's dry, you  can gently scrunch it. This breaks the gel cast so your hair won't feel crunchy."

curlyhair,3co7f9,JavaPig,4,Tue Jul 14 23:58:34 2015 UTC,Yes question here! I've been reading some product reviews and a common description is slip/no slip. What does this mean??   Edit for autocorrect failure
curlyhair,3co7f9,homicidalunicorns,3,Fri Jul 10 00:08:14 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, a product with slip will easily distribute through your hair and help with detangling by making the strands, well, ""slippery"". You'll be able to easily run your fingers through your hair, and it may also feel softer.  Kinky Curly Knot Today, for example, is a detangler/leave in that' known for having lots and lots of slip."
curlyhair,3co7f9,backseatredditor,2,Fri Jul 10 00:49:11 2015 UTC,"And to add to what /u/homicidalunicorns writes, an example of a conditioner with very little slip (I think) is SheaMoisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner.  A good product, but impossible to cowash with for this reason."
curlyhair,3co7f9,JavaPig,2,Fri Jul 10 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Ha, funny. I bought this product before researching and that's where I saw the adjective! I like the product well enough but found it works better if you leave it in for half hour, rinse thoroughly and then do S2C with your usual conditioner. I get the no-slip vibe though. Very liquidy!"
curlyhair,3co7f9,onlykindagreen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I just got SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner. I used it once, but along with the shampoo. I was hoping to transition to cowashing with it, but I do understand because it was hard to comb my hair with it in, it was thicker than I anticipated. I also bought Sauve Naturals Ocean Breeze so I guess I'll use that. What would I use a product very little slip like the SheaMoisture for? As a leave-in?"
curlyhair,3co7f9,Wintersoulstice,3,Tue Jul 14 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"So my hair is 2a/2b and over the last 6 months of doing CG pretty consistently I have seen a lot of progress, it's much closer to a consistent 2b now and my waves are a lot more defined. I haven't used a blow dryer in 5 months. The thing is, I get kind of get bored with wearing my hair the same every day, and I want to start blow drying it straight once a week or so, just to change it up. Will this erase my progress, if I'm still following CG on my wavy days? This strikes me as a really dumb question, hence why it's here."
curlyhair,3co7f9,Lanalen,4,Sun Jul 12 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"I've been doing the CG method for a year and à half, and I still straighten my hair from time to time, for the same reasons you mentioned.  When it's just for one wash, my curls aren't affected at all, I just make sure to use heat protection, and I use a regular shampoo afterwards because of the silicones, and then deep condition.  YMMV, just try it!"

curlyhair,3co7f9,femtobarn-1,2,Sun Jul 12 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"It was about a week for me, but I had been using a shampoo with low sulfates for years before going CG, so my hair didn't take too long to adjust to no sulfates. I also really scrubbed my scalp with conditioner, especially at my part. Not sure if that helped my hair adjust faster, but it at least made me feel like my hair was as clean as possible."
curlyhair,3co7f9,arcella12,2,Sun Jul 12 05:34:42 2015 UTC,"It took me about 4-6 weeks before I REALLY noticed a difference in my hair and curls. I did a pretty drastic change as I was using shampoos and conditioners that I can only assume were high in sulfates and silicones, and I would exclusively wear my hair in ponytails, buns, or braids. I was pretty brutal to my curly hair before I discovered CG, so that might be why it took so long for my hair to adjust.  EDIT: Typing on a phone is hard."

curlyhair,3co7f9,arcella12,2,Sun Jul 12 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"Many people plop their hair overnight, whether it's wet or dry. I actually tried plopping my dry hair recently and found it to be very effective in preventing the frizz I'd normally get if I tried pineappling. My hair is long as well (though not as long as yours!) and I find pineappling to be of little help for me because it ends up under my head one way or another.  Also, I'd recommend getting a bottle of cheap conditioner (I got Suave Naturals Ocean Breeze at Target for $1.57) and mix it into a spray bottle with equal parts water, then just spray it on your hair and scrunch it through in the morning."
curlyhair,3co7f9,kellybean510,2,Mon Jul 13 20:09:59 2015 UTC,I would never have thought to plop my dry hair! That's a good idea :-)  50/50 conditioner and water has to be better than salt spray I currently use to revive my slept in hair! Haha thank you :-)

My summer go-tos have been: depending on what I feel like doing, co-wash occasionally with Suave Naturals coconut conditioner doctored with a couple tbsp fresh-squeezed lemon juice and like 20 drops of tea tree oil per bottle, or just dunk it in water with enough sea salt in it to taste a little salty, or wash with Kinky Curly Come Clean followed by letting Shea Moisture African black soap hair purification mask sit in it for at least 5 minutes (been doing this last 1-2 times a week for a couple weeks, it does seem to be helping). I'm considering trying raw honey, but it seems like a lot of effort and expense... Anybody else have products to recommend that won't wreck my 3-year-ish no-sulfates streak?"

curlyhair,3co7f9,backseatredditor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:08:22 2015 UTC,Indeed.  I usually use it as a rinse out and as leave-in (though I rotate through like a dozen different conditioners on account of my product addiction).
curlyhair,3co7f9,trufflecheese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"2A fine hair currently using Suave naturals coconut conditioner for cowashing. But I am finding it hard to stick to my routine, due to the greasy build-up and lots of falling hair.   I found this product called Tress Tamer in my country. Ingredients listed: Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Tocopherols, Virgin Coconut Oil, Fragrance, FD&C Color. They have a hair mask variant which has the same ingredients, but a bit thicker. Which would be more appropriate for cowashing, a more watery or thicker conditioner? Are the ingredients CG?"
curlyhair,3co7f9,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jul 14 08:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a more watery conditioner for cowashing - it's easier to work your fingers into your scalp and really loosen up the oils and buildup. For S2C (Squish to Condish), a thicker conditioner is usually what people use, although it's not a requirement by any means. If you're getting enough hydration with a thinner conditioner, keep it up!    And yes, the ingredients in Tress Tamer are CG-approved. The hair mask looks to me like it's intended as a deep conditioner though, not a regular shower conditioner."

curlyhair,3co7f9,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jul 14 13:05:26 2015 UTC,"People have recommended that you soak your hair in coconut oil prior to bleaching. I haven't done it myself, but the theory behind it (soaking it into your strands offers core protection against the bleach) makes sense.    Your curls may be lackluster afterwards... by that I mean, not as tight, and dry-looking. Once you're OK to wash your hair (usually 2-4 days), make sure you give yourself a protein treatment, and do some extra deep conditioning for a couple weeks.   How dark is your hair currently? I ask because if you're really dark, doing an ombre may be better to help maintain the integrity of your strands. I experienced quite a bit of breakage with balayage, not so much with ombre. Also, do you know if your stylist uses Olaplex? Hopefully so, it's pretty much a magic potion that gets put into bleach and dye (and applied as a treatment afterwards) to help strengthen your hair structure."
curlyhair,3co7f9,what_the_deckle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! I had read about the coconut oil deep condition so I'll go ahead and do that.  My hair is kind of a dark blonde at this point and I'm hoping they won't really need to do much in the way of bleach. I'm totally unschooled in the world of dye though so I have no clue. I don't know if the stylist uses Olaplex but I will ask!
curlyhair,3co7f9,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"Oh OK, since you're already blonde, it shouldn't be too bad, even if the stylist doesn't use Olaplex. I went from deep brown to pale yellow (for fun-colors) and it wrecked me. I think you'll be just fine though =)   Oh! Another thing you'll wanna check on also... I've found that most stylists use sulfate-free shampoos, but still use conditioning products with silicones. You might be able to bring in your own products, but if not, just be sure to ask to see the ingredients so you know if you'll need to clarify afterwards."

curlyhair,3cjwsa,Luckydiaz,11,Wed Jul 8 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say 3A, though ultimately curl type isn't as important as other traits such as hair porosity and width (fine, medium, or coarse). Figuring those out really helps with product choice. Fine and/or low porosity hair, for example, tends to do better with lighter products.   That said, you can experiment with whatever product you like! I personally do a combo of leave in for moisture, oil to seal and for shine, and medium hold gel for curl definition and hold. My hair absorbs anything I throw at it and is perfectly happy with heavy products.  Your curls are already solidly defined, so I don't think you'd need a huge amount of product to achieve further definition!"

curlyhair,3cm25o,panyedelnik,2,Wed Jul 8 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"My hair abuse sounds exactly the same as yours!  I've been straightening my hair for nearly 10 years, and dyeing every couple of months, including hard bleaches. To be honest, the only real reason I've started on CGM is because of a terrible hair cut that left my hair in messy layers that just didn't look good straightened.  I've only recently started on the CGM, about a month ago, I may not have great advice and I haven't experimented with too many products... but...  I'm currently using Naked 'Rescue' conditioner for damaged hair you can buy it from Boots, it's working pretty well and I've seen some improvements over the last 2 weeks, but it's not really enough time to know. Although it is leaving my hair nice and silky. I'm not confident enough to go no-poo just yet, so I'm also using Naked Curly hair shampoo.  I deal with clients face to face quite often, having unwashed hair just comes across as completely unprofessional. However I don't wash it as much as I used to, and put it up in updos quite a lot. (pintrest is your friend here)  However it has been highly recommended to use Boots Essentials Curl Cream I picked some up when I first started and my curls are really tight and tend to stay alot longer than normal leave in conditioner, it's fantastic stuff! (for someone who hasn't used many other products haha)  I also went and got as much of the dead ends cut off, which seriously made a difference on the frizz!"
curlyhair,3cm25o,Shubeans,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Hey hey - thank you so much for your reply!  I'm going to pop into Boots at the weekend and splurge! Also, bonus that their Curl Cream and the Naked stuff seems to be way cheaper than the Deva stuff that I was looking at!   I get you on the clients thing - I have to look professional for work too but I usually wear it in an up-do anyway so hopefully I can get away with it if it turns out like a rats nest to start off with. My main worry is that I run a lot and I'm worried that no-poo isn't going to cut it when my hair is plastered to my face with sweat!  Urgh- why did I do this to my hair? I've chopped off the worst of the damage by now but I just wish I could fast forward to looking like the gorgeous ""good curl day"" pictures I keep seeing here!"

curlyhair,3clep5,mirandolin,3,Wed Jul 8 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Hiya, welcome! I understand, it can be really overwhleming to get started. It took me a few weeks of research before I finally took the plunge!   1) Some people use sulfate-free shampoos, some people cowash, some people alternate the two, and some people water-wash. It's up to what works for you and your hair.    2) Yes. I cowash with a lightweight runny conditioner, VO5 Strawberry Cream. For detangling and regular conditioner, I use thicker ones with more slip. So far I like DevaCurl One mixed another. DevaCurl has tons of slip, but is expensive, so I try out tons of different conditioners with it to help stretch it out.     3) I have fine hair that picks up oil from my face, and used to have an oily scalp. I personally began by alternating sulfate-free shampoo with cowashing, and am working into more and more cowashing. I still use the shampoo on my bangs/right around my hairline though, to get rid of the face oil. How often is again up to what works for you. I sweat a lot, especially when I work out, so I wash every day.      4) I don't have any dry shampoo recommendations, as they never worked well for me. If you don't want to wash every day, you could use them though. Lots of curlies will revive their curls on the second/third/etc day by lightly spraying their hair with a mixture of water and conditioner, then scrunching a little bit. That helps bring the curls back, tame the frizz, and re-activate the products from the earlier days.     5) Frizz usually means you're not getting enough moisture from the product, although it could also be that you're in a humid area and are pulling in too much water from the environment. Weighed down, well, yeah, the product is too heavy. Crunchiness from products is normal - products are meant to form a cast around our curls, drying them in-place. After your hair is completely dry, you ""scrunch out the crunch"". Since your hair already dried in-place, you won't lose the definition, just the hard cast.     For leave-in recommendations, I really like Kinky Curly Knot Today and MopTop Citrus Bamboo Leave-In. They both have lightweight curling custards (gel) to compliment them as well."

curlyhair,3clep5,lynnb496,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"1) I use a sulfate-free shampoo several times a week before using a conditioner. My skin is very oily, and I found my hair was too oily only cowashing. I tried cowashing for almost a year, and it really weighed down my hair.  3) It's probably something you just have to try for yourself. My hair is pretty short, so I don't have a problem with dry ends.  4) When I did cowashing, I did it every day. If I didn't, my hair would start dreadlocking.  5) I use Aveeno sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner, AsIAm Leave-In conditioner, Garnier Fructis Finishing Paste, ISO Bouncy Creme, and a few drops of sunflower oil"
curlyhair,3clep5,moe-money,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"I do both! I shampoo once every 3-4 days depending on how my hair is looking/feeling and cowash every other day. I use 2 separate products. I use Shea Moisure's Coconut and Hibiscus co-wash/cleansing conditioner on my scalp and cheap VO5 on the rest of my hair to detangle (I have long hair and go through a LOT of conditioner) It may at first due to an adjustment period. Your hair might end up liking it better and becoming less oily in the long run. One of those things that is different for everyone. I went sulfate-free, then added in cowashing every other day, and gradually am extending the time period between shampoo washes. I wash my hair every day so Im afraid I wont be much help here! I use Shea Moisture's Jamaican castor oil iirc, but my hair is thick, long, 2b-c so Im not sure if it will work for fine hair"
curlyhair,3clep5,cuddlefish333,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:14:53 2015 UTC,"A little late but it sounds like we have really similar hair - mine's also 2Cish, very fine, and used to get really greasy.    I can't give up shampoo entirely which seems to be the case with most fine curls. I co-wash with Suave Naturals coconut conditioner every 2-3 days, making sure I lather and massage into the scalp to lift any dirt. About once a week I'll use Shea Moisture: Moisture Retention shampoo which is sulfate free and the night before I'll do an overnight deep condition with a mix of my usual conditioner, olive oil, and honey which makes my hair so soft and frizz-free!  I typically use the same conditioner for both.  Every hair is different, but in general going 2 or more days without washing will help reduce the greasiness. Washing everyday strips your hair of a lot of oils it needs so your scalp is over producing to try to keep up. If you switch to washing less often, your scalp won't produce as much though it takes a little while for your hair to catch up to a new routine so at first your hair may seem super greasy. How often you wash depends on your hair, some can go a whole week, others like me go 2-3 days. Try starting just washing every other day and gradually lengthening the days between washes.  Between washes, I just spray my hair in the morning with a mix of water and Suave conditioner, add a bit of gel, and that does a decent job of perking up and reforming curls. I don't use dry shampoo so no help there.  I have the same problems with my hair and leave-ins, but I've found some good products that work: After I shower I use Shea Moisture Restorative conditioner on my hair when it's still soaking wet, after I let my hair air dry and diffuse a bit I add just a little Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Gel and just those two are usually enough. I occasionally also use Jessicurl's Gelebration Spray and Confident Coils together which are designed for fine curls and they are amazing but I've heard they can dry out hair sometimes so I'm careful not to use them all the time to keep that from happening. In general, look for products that will help add/retain moisture and are silicone free as silicones weigh hair down, especially fine curls."

curlyhair,3cjiks,confuzzled_me,4,Wed Jul 8 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"A photo would help, but here's my two cents without that. My hair is also kind of thin and very fine. DevaCurl products are really good for this hair type IMO, and that's an easy place to start. Start using low-poo or no-poo (or co-washing) if you haven't already, and look for styling products that won't weigh down your hair. One favorite combo of mine was the DevaCurl Arc AnGel plus some of the DevaCurl Frizz Free Volumizing Foam. Now I use Kinky Curly Curling Custard because  the Deva stuff made my scalp dry but I still use DevaCurl low-poo and conditioner. Never use heat styling of any kind, and get a bob or shorter haircut to make it look thicker, but don't let them put layers in your hair, this will make it look thinner again. Dry shampoo or texturizing spray will also help, just make sure it's silicone-free or else it won't wash out without normal (e.g. damaging!) shampoo."

curlyhair,3ck7vp,Talima,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Every curly/wavy hair is different. Even people with the same curl type won't get on with your routine and you might not get on with theirs, it's a case of try and see. Possibly getting samples would be a cheaper option.  I don't tie my hair up when wet as hair is more prone to breakage - it can stretch more so it can damage it.  I only plop for 20/30mins and I don't use product before plopping. Have you tried squish to condish? It's helped my hair a lot. I use pure argan oil to hydrate my hair after plopping but before diffusing. I very rarely use styling products and when I do it's Sea Spray from Lush as it has a light gel in it so it doesn't feel crispy or heavy.  I hope at least something in what I've typed helps!"

I appreciate your reply; I am not sure what squish to condish is but I will find out with a little googling :) I do like the products from Lush, anything more on the natural side makes me a happy girl.

I straightened it and dyed it and everything else to get rid of my curls and I've only been embracing them for 3 years or so. I'm still learning :)  Squish to condish, just incase you hadn't looked it up yet and I've always used a fairly heavy conditioner (American Cream, Lush) but I'm a 3A and it's fine but I have a lot of it so I don't use anything too heavy or it can make it look ratty.  Most hairdryers have a diffuser with them. I dry my hair upside down (bending forward) put the hair dryer into my hair, turn it on (medium heat) for 20 seconds, turn it off, take it out then put it onto the next bit. All in all this usually takes 5 mins. Another redditor recommended this and it's fantastic. I dry my hair so it's about 60% dry then leave it and occasionally flip it to get more volume at the roots.   This all might sound a lot but honestly, it's super easy and quick to do.  Have fun :)"
curlyhair,3ck7vp,evancalous,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"Not really, as long as it's CG-approved and provides the moisture and hydration you're looking for. I personally prefer thick conditioners for S2C."
curlyhair,3ck7vp,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:13:25 2015 UTC,It sounds like we have the same hair type so this is what has given me the best results. I use a clarifying shampoo occasionally if my hair looks dull or I used hairspray and other than that I alternate between cowashing and using a sulfate free shampoo. I squish to condish but I have to rinse out 95% of the conditioner. Once my curls are formed I gently scrunch the water out with a t-shirt and then I put a few sprays of a silicone free heat protectant in and a dime sized amount of gel and scrunch. Then I bust out my diffuser and dry my hair most of the way on low heat with my head upside down. Once it's almost dry I flip my hair right side up and kinda shake my head until my hair is out of my face. Then I let it air dry completely and scrunch it to break up the gel cast.  I don't do this all the time because I don't want to damage my hair by blow drying it every day but it looks curly and amazing when I do vs flippy and slightly wavy. The most important part is not touching it until it's fully dry. I've tried a few leave in conditioners but they tend to weigh fine hair down too much but I'm still looking. I also do a coconut oil mask once a week to keep it moisturized. I would also recommend using sea salt spray less often because it can be super drying and cause damage. Hope this helps.
curlyhair,3ck7vp,evancalous,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the reply :) It sounds like the next step is definitely to try the S2C method - I should probably be brought up on charges for my hair care routine until recently...I didn't even condition at ALL and washed every day...bad girl.  I think I will probably have to end up rinsing out most of the conditioner as well, since I do fear the dreaded oily hair. But, it sounds like it's time for some experimenting!  Not touching it is VERY hard, I notoriously like to feel it and run my fingers through it as it dries, this is a great tip to remember.  I did not know that about the salt spray...I guess it makes sense...I agree sometimes it leaves my hair feeling almost brittle...  Thank you again, I appreciate it! :)"

After showering, I do my best to dry my hair as little as possible, still having drops of water coming out and my hair still over my face.

I straightened my hair chemically (perm) from age 7 - 22. My final year in college I finally started to grow out my natural hair, and cutting my straight hair off bit by bit until I had a short fro. My straight hair wasn't overly unhealthy or anything, I just got tired of the constant straightening and wanted to see what my REAL hair was like.  I can't believe it's been five years! My goal is to grow my hair out, in its curly state, until it's about to my armpit level, though I keep cutting it so who knows how long it'll take!"

curlyhair,3cjn9p,Frose91,2,Thu Jul 9 06:41:32 2015 UTC,"Straightening too often will keep destroying the texture of your hair. Try to limit it, limit hair dryers as well. You can dye it and keep it healthy as long as you avoid box dye. I have some damaged dyed hair and use Yes To Cucumbers. The conditioner has a lot of slip to detangle your hair without breaking it. Shampoo is sulfate free. I use a homemade coconut oil spray after washing to protect my hair from further damage. If you go for curls, detangle with the conditioner in the shower. I only use my fingers but you can comb it in if you feel you have to. Don't brush your hair when dry. After a while it'll start to look better. It may need some time after so much straightening. (Mine tends to need a few weeks/washes after dyeing before the curl goes back to normal)"

curlyhair,3ckbkm,MermaidMermaid,2,Wed Jul 8 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"I've heard that BC pills can change your hair chemistry due to the additional hormones, but don't have any solid evidence. Just rumor.    Not sure if you're 100% CG-method, but your shampoo contains sulfates, and all of your products contain silicones. I find that when I use products with 'cones, it pulls my curls into waves (hence why I use them the rare occasions when I'm straightening).   I'd recommend switching out to CG-approved products (check this list in the sidebar to get started), and then experimenting with S2C and plopping again. Note, before switching to CG, you'll want to wash your hair with a sulfate shampoo to get rid of 'cones. Your current OGX won't work, as even the shampoo has Dimethicone in it."
curlyhair,3ckbkm,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:48:40 2015 UTC,"Okay great, this is exactly the kind of help I'm looking for.   I've looked at the product list before and I could have sworn the shampoo I bought is on there. A lot of the brands are out of my price range or harder to come by, but I'll keep looking.  What product would you recommend instead of the curl cream? A gel or a spray or a cream?   I'm currently doing CG in everything but products, I guess (although like I said, the shampoo I bought because I thought it was on the list). I don't brush my hair, just comb it with my fingers and conditioner in the shower. I don't use any heat on it. I scrunch the product into it when it's wet and gently towel it as specified in CG.   Thanks a ton for your help."
curlyhair,3ckbkm,hashtagphag,3,Wed Jul 8 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"The HG product list isn't 100% CG-approved... think of it more like ""these work awesome for curlies, but be sure to read the ingredients"". It should state if there are silicones or sulfates present though. Shampoos without sulfates can be a little hard to come by. All SheaMoisture products are silicone and sulfate free, but they're a little more expensive than OGX. They can be found in pretty much any store where you buy OGX though.   It's hard to recommend gel over cream over mousse because it's really about what works well for your hair type. It's trial-and-error for us all. It looks like your hair is probably fine, but thick... is that right? I've personally never been a fan of mousse, I prefer gels or creams, even with my fine and thin hair. I'm still experimenting with what works best, but common ones that I've either used or others recommend are:   LA Looks Sport Gel Eco Styler Kinky Curly SheaMoisture DevaCurl (pricey)"

There are a ton of how to vids on how to use the curl sponge and it's pretty great! The only thing to worry about is not rubbing your hair too hard, cause it might damage the shaft, but other than that it works like a charm!"
curlyhair,3cd9un,djcarlos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:20:24 2015 UTC,How do you use it?

curlyhair,3cd9un,gypsywhisperer,4,Tue Jul 7 15:51:39 2015 UTC,I never knew those existed! My boyfriend is mixed (mostly black though) so I'd love to see how his hair would look with that!
curlyhair,3cd9un,Sparxfly,2,Tue Jul 7 04:28:17 2015 UTC,Is it reccommended for all curly hair?
curlyhair,3cd9un,thisismeER,2,Tue Jul 7 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"It's best recommended for coarse, curly hair, but yes it is possible to use on other curly types, but mostly the curler and coarser the better."
curlyhair,3cd9un,turboladle,4,Tue Jul 7 03:14:38 2015 UTC,"So um, when I looked this up it only showed pictures of black men. Do you think it would work for my long, white girl hair?"
curlyhair,3cd9un,reijn,9,Tue Jul 7 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it. Even searching ""curl sponge white girl"" or ""long hair"" comes up with zero videos of white people trying to use it."
curlyhair,3cd9un,thisismeER,6,Tue Jul 7 03:26:26 2015 UTC,"No, if you look up videos on YouTube (sorry I'm on mobile, no link) to see how it's used, you rub it on your short coarse hair, often using some kind of styling n product like shea or something,  in a circular pattern. I've mostly seen women use it on YouTube but if you have natural black hair it would work.  On long white hair it would do nothing for you at all."

curlyhair,3chmn9,twobrothersinavan,0,Wed Jul 8 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"No, it's a styling method that's supposed to decrease frizz and encourage curl formation. I second the suggestion that you read the sidebar.  If you want the wet and soft look, try using both mousse and a gel."
curlyhair,3chmn9,ImaCheeseMonkey,3,Wed Jul 8 07:08:24 2015 UTC,"what type of gel? i'll get one.  i dont think he uses that styling method, and i have no plans to use it myself.  i didnt find any info in the sidebar about that styling method, i just found a video similar to the one you sent me."

curlyhair,3cft1e,Thee_Zohan,4,Tue Jul 7 16:04:19 2015 UTC,"My hair is 2b and it doesn't respond well to plopping for more than 5-10 minutes. I usually plop straight out of the shower to get the excess water out, leave my hair up while applying deodorant and moisturizer, and then take it down.   I'd try leaving a little more conditioner in after your shower - scrunch it in just to the dyed part, squish to condish it out and leave some behind. I can't S2C if I apply conditioner anywhere above my ears, so I'll often do one round where it all gets conditioned and rinsed, and another round where it only goes in the ends (usually with a heavier conditioner).   How does your hair do if you let it dry in the french braid? When my hair was long enough for braids, I found this a pretty good way to get some nice uniform waves."

curlyhair,3cgmjd,Hennydowntheroad,2,Tue Jul 7 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"Rake-and-Shake on it's own didn't work well for me, the ""shake"" part seems to separate my curls too much. I've modified it to:   Section my hair into three parts (canopy is one, underneath is two). Rake the product in, thoroughly saturating each section. Twist the sections together (like I'm prepping for dreads), then plop. After plopping, clip my roots, and scrunch my lengths up a little bit (3-6 times, depending on how my hair is behaving).   With short hair, you can probably skip the clipping and possibly even the sectioning. Or perhaps try squishing your products in, rather than R&S?"

curlyhair,3cgmjd,TheShotgunBetty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling! Here's my advice: Do the rake and squish! Rake and scrunch! I think rake + shake was invented for people whose curls are typically large, springy, and not so loose. If your hair doesn't fall that way naturally, it separates your curls, and you may also find yourself weighing down your hair with heavy product as you try to make it work. Instead, rub your curl cream between your hands, rake it through your wet hair, and then squish and scrunch your curls from the ends to the roots. Be careful not to rake too much, or you'll pull out the natural clumps forming in your wet locks (I do this ALL THE TIME!). Afterwards, you can do finger curls to encourage them to clump together. Clipping your roots might help encourage clumping, too.  And don't touch your hair while it dries!!"

curlyhair,3ce7ei,mszum,6,Tue Jul 7 05:37:44 2015 UTC,"Time to get some different hair products. My daughter is a bit older (2) and has short hair, but I use the same sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner on her that I do on myself. I also use my wide-tooth comb while the conditioner is in, which feels silly because she has so little hair, but it's a little more comb action than just my fingers. After a bath/shower, I smooth some leave-in conditioner over her hair and scrunch it a little to give her a nice baby afro. On days when her hair is weird, I spray my water+gel combo on it and scrunch it back into the afro.  Since your daughter's hair is longer, you should get a spray-in conditioner and only comb it while generously spraying with that. Get a hairbrush or comb with wider bristles, because you don't want a fine comb or brush - it'll disrupt the curl pattern. I've heard good things about the WetBrush.   Try reading the stuff in the sidebar about the CG method. I've been using it on myself and haven't found it particularly hard to adapt to use on my daughter. There's also a section on kids in the Curly Girl Handbook that you may find useful.  The carseat is a problem for my daughter, because she sits there and rubs her head back and forth on the velour. I'm not sure what the best thing to do will be when that gets to be a bigger issue, but I have a feeling it involves more leave-in conditioner.  Bonus: my curly girl"
curlyhair,3cb4og,PastelWater,25,Mon Jul 6 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"I find that the only thing that can help me in the mornings is using a spritz bottle with part conditioner and part water in it, spraying that into my palms, and scrunching/twirling curls and smoothing it over frizzy areas. It does take a bit to dry, though, how much time do you have in mornings? :)"
curlyhair,3cb4og,Luckydiaz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"If you have even 15 minutes to run around in the am, do a spritz and then re-plop while doing makeup + getting ready.   If my hair was washed the night before, I spin it up in a bun straight out the shower and use one of those telephone cord style hair ties. When I wake it's still wet enough that a light spritz, plop, scrunch with curl cream does the job.  Edit: Just kind of building on your comment, your strategy is what I used for a long time too before I heard of plopping in am."
curlyhair,3cb4og,PPUni,19,Tue Jul 7 12:25:13 2015 UTC,"Have you tried plopping overnight? I have a ton of long wavy hair (somewhere between a 2B and 2C) that takes a loooong time to dry, like yours. A couple nights ago I tried plopping it overnight and it looked fantastic in the morning! My hair was still a bit damp in the morning, but I prefer it that way so it can air dry the way I want it to (not sure if that makes sense). I didn't have bedhead, my pillow didn't get damp (hate that feeling), and it was way more comfortable than I thought it would be!"

curlyhair,3cb4og,Samanthawv19,6,Mon Jul 6 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"I bought a 'magic turban' towel wrap similar to this from Primark to put my hair in over night. I basically do the same as plopping, then button it at the back and go to sleep. It's really comfy, preserves my curls, and dries my hair while I sleep.  I'd definitely recommend it if you want to try it out overnight, as they're pretty cheap and hold your hair just secure enough to do the job. (Pro tip: sometimes if I want tighter ringlets I put it on backwards by bending forward and brushing my hair into the buttoned wider part of the turban, then I pull it up and secure it tightly around my head so my curls are pressed tightly together at the front of my head, then twist the fabric at my nape to secure it and button at the front. This way you can avoid sleeping with a button sticking into your head and you wake up with gorgeous ringlets the next day.)"

The only thing is making sure my ears aren't in the towel, cause that can give me earaches if the water is caught in them overnight.   Edit: I don't let my hair go down in the twist part of the towel when I use it. I pile all my hair in the fullest part of the towel and let it pile on top of my head in the natural curl clumps."

I'm picky about having weird stuff on when I sleep but the plop t shirt was no problem for me. I have a lot of hair and a pretty big head to begin with (seriously, hats don't fit me very well!) so I use a size large short sleeve t shirt. Long sleeves are better for tying I think, but I don't have a size large long sleeve t shirt.   I fold the hem a few times on the bottom so the extra fabric is used up so I don't have that extra 6 inches of fabric on top of my head; rather, it's folded around my hair line, making the plop neater and more secure, I think. When I pull the neck of the shirt to the nape of my neck, I have maybe a spare 1.5 inches. I tie the sleeves around my head snugly, but that's because of my large head and the short sleeves of the t shirt...they kind of work against each other, but somehow it works :)  My best plops began when I started folding the bottom hem of the shirt, so I would start playing around with that :) I hope this helps!"

My routine (that is working for me) is to cowash then condition my hair in the shower. Put in leave-in conditioner and plop with a microfiber towel while I get ready for bed (maybe like 30 mins to an hour, maybe less). Then I scrunch in my gel (like...a lot of it) and put my hair up in a bun on my head and sleep on it wet. When I wake up, my hair is still wet enough to play with or add more product/style as needed, and it air dries as I get ready for work. By the time I'm at work (6:30) it's usually all the way dry or close enough so I can scrunch out the remaining gel cast before I walk in."

I can not plop, pineapple, or put my hair in a bun overnight without looking like a rat tried to nest in my hair while I was sleeping. For all of you it works for, I'm jealous!  I shower at night. I'm always at the barn in the evenings so end up disgusting, and there's no way I'm going to sleep like that!  I shampoo in the shower, and rinse it all out, apply conditioner, finger comb/detangle hair and let it sit about 4-5 minutes, and then rinse for like 2 seconds max. Whatever doesn't want to be friends with my hair gets rinsed right off and the majority of the conditioner does not get rinsed out. I squeeze excess water out with my hands and then get out of the shower.  Turn head upside down and scrunch in a whole lot of Africa's Best oil. It's like $3 at Target, a bottle lasts forever, and it's the absolute best shit around. I love it. I squeeze it all up in those curls, load up the ends, and even right up at my scalp it won't get greasy.  Then with my head still upside down I kind of just palm my hair and plop it against my head and then use a big claw hair clip to hold all up there. A t-shirt, microfiber, etc all up on my hair to plop with separates my curls, which starts setting in the frizz, and makes it all awful. Clip is where it's at for my pain in the ass follicles.  How long I leave it up in the clip depends when I showered and when I went to bed. A minimum of 2-3 hours works best for me. I put the clip right up on the top of my head so I can still easily sleep with it in, but my hair will still be damp in the morning if I do that which I'm not a fan of, especially in the winter when it'll freeze in the walk between the house and car. So when I go to bed I just remove the clip and leave it loose up there. I'm usually up at least once during the night, so I sometimes will go to bed with it and just yank it out at that point.  I toss and turn A LOT, and in the morning I usually have one or two curls near my face that got flattened out and frizzed, but recurling it with a damp hand with a drop of the oil helps set it back to right. If I've gone too long without a trim the ends will suffer that same dry flat fate, but that's more of a lazy maintenance issue on my end."

curlyhair,3cb4og,landica_33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:03:43 2015 UTC,Yeah my hair can't stand diffusers no matter what. It HAS to air-dry or it turns into a fuzz ball. I've used the Organix line before and wasn't too impressed by it. The cream I use is Shea-Butter Leave in Conditioner (from organic stores). Maybe you could try switching to oils instead? Your hair might just need some more moisture.
curlyhair,3cb4og,landica_33,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:12:10 2015 UTC,Yeah you'd be surprised! After years of using relaxer and then growing my hair out I didn't think it could curl without mouse or cream. Then one day I just put oil and it was magnificent.
curlyhair,3cb4og,landica_33,2,Mon Jul 6 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"What if you just sleep in the plop? It takes a bit of trial and error to tie it in a way that works (I sleep on my sides and back, so mine needs to be flat-ish and tight!), but it helps the curls be less disturbed overnight. Depending on how thick your hair is, you might find that's it's at the perfect ""almost dry"" stage where you can spritz and style for a wash-and-go routine. Mine is usually slightly damp, but it's pretty thick. YMMV."

curlyhair,3cb4og,Engineerbarbie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"Do you have a space heater? If not, you can just ignore this lol...but (since I'm too lazy to buy a diffuser) I just hang my head so my hair is right in front of my space heater, until it dries enough that I'm comfortable sleeping on it. I use a silk bonnet at night so I just need it dry enough that it's not soaking wet, making my pillow and bonnet uncomfortably damp. To get it to that level of dryness I only need to be by the space heater for a few minutes. But theoretically if I wanted it completely dry I could stay there longer. I do that sometimes if I shower in the morning and it's winter, and I don't want hypothermia when I go outside.   You say you don't like to use diffusers, and if that's because of the heat, then my suggestion of a space heater doesn't really work. But I do still recommend using a silk bonnet at night!"
curlyhair,3cb4og,maaarie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"I never use gel in my hair, but a leave-in conditioner. Instead of a scrunch, I grab strands of hair and twist them a few times (5-8 times for super curly, but usually twice for a bit of curl) Let my hair air dry for a few hours. I can do a loose bun and the next morning it looks fab. If I don't sleep with a bun it looks pretty frizzy. I also use a loose clothe scrunchy so it doesn't make an ugly imprint in my hair."
curlyhair,3cb4og,dannygreenscousin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:41 2015 UTC,I use a Moroccan oil after showering. Wrap in a bun on top of my head without a hair tie. Leave it that way for like thirty minutes before bed. When I go to bed I undo the bun and lay my hair up the pillow. Magic! Gotta try to not roll around too much though.

I would have bet my life savings I could never shower in the mornings. Then I got the DevaCurl defuser, and it changed my life. If you could borrow one from someone to see if it worked for you, I'd recommend that. It's the only difuser that has ever worked for me. Good luck. I feel your pain :("
curlyhair,3ce38f,lacust,4,Tue Jul 7 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, there are definitely different types of CG products for different hair. What works well for a 3B coarse thick curly likely won't work well for a 2B fine thin curly. See if you can figure out these things about your hair, and then look for people who have similar flair in their names or descriptions in their posts:    curl type: 2A/B for you density: thin, medium, thick strand type: fine, medium, coarse porosity: low, medium, high   There's some links over in the sidebar that can help with figuring those out.    When I first started CG, I experienced more breakage than normal also... I don't have anything scientific backing this up, but my theory is that all those silicone-laden products were just holding the unhealthy broken ends together. They would have broken off eventually anyway, especially since I bleach/dye regularly. Going CG just made it happen all at once instead of slow-and-gradual. It settled down after a week or two.     It's looking like your hair needs some moisturizing products to help combat the frizz. That usually comes in the form of a good shower conditioner, and a good leave-in conditioner. Also, deep conditioning treatments are our best friend =) Do you know if your hair is sensitive to protein? Signs of it are that after using products with protein, your hair is left feeling even more dry, strawlike and maybe even brittle. Breakage can occur for those especially sensitive as well. That might even be the cause of your breakage and tangling, come to think of it. Anyway, I ask because I can share what's worked for me and my thin hair, but the majority of my products contain protein.   To get more curl definition, a gel/mousse/curl creme will be needed. As /u/-redditistheworst- mentioned, it's really gonna be trial-and-error to find what works the best. I'd say just pick one and experiment for a few days or a week, and see if you like or dislike what it does for your hair. Some things I noticed that I disliked:     my ends broke apart into strings/wisps my hair felt coated, like the product was just sitting on top I had to use handfuls, literally, in order to get any noticeable results nice smell in the jar, weird chemically smell once it dried on my hair   Oh, and for the crunchy look/feeling you mentioned... gels and the like will dry in your hair that way. They do that so that your curl pattern holds. Once your hair is fully dry, tilt your head to the side (or upside down), and scrunch out the scrunch. Basically, gather your curls in your palm and squeeze them up towards your crown. That will release the crunchy hold of the dry gel, but since your hair dried in shape, the curl should still remain."

My family and I are moving out of state in a couple weeks, so I've been really busy.  Anyway, I was so overwhelmed by all the information and different products that I decided to take a leap of faith and went on a mini shopping spree for new hair products! I got Shea Moisture Tahitian Noni & Monoi Smooth & Repair Nourishing Masque, Shea Moisutre Raw Retention Shampoo, Suave Naturals Conditioner-Tropical Cocunut, Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Gel, and a comb and spray bottle (for leave-in conditioner). I used all of my new products last night, and then plopped while sleeping, and then woke up this morning to beautiful curls! It's crazy how I can already see results. The only thing that I would like to improve upon at this point is how straight the top of my hair is (since I'm a 2a/b), and it also seems like some parts of the back of my hair didn't curl as well as the rest of it for some reason. Any other critique or suggestions you may have on my routine (since I've actually attempted the process now) would be great!

In addition to that: use antihumectants as a leave in (bees wax is one, but there are many other natural ingredients that are antihumectants) or a styling product that contain antihumectants. They combat the process where the hair strands move away from each other.  Also, use LOADS of thin, runny conditioner that doesn't contain any heavy butters or oils in addition to your regular conditioner - it will change the electrical charge of your hair, making it frizz less. Be on the lookout for the ingredient ""cetrimonium chloride"" or ""behentrimonium chloride"": they help do that in conditioners.  Also, get a Devacut."

And to save money, I just get one per year or every six months to get the shape I want, and then I use the curly girl handbook to do my own between professional cuts. I have gone to traditional salons who say they know curly hair, but so far I haven't found that to be true. If you do want to go that way, though, your best bet would be to check the Curltalk message boards for reviews of curly stylists who may not necessarily be Devachan or Ouidad but know curls.   If Devachan is at all possible and you can justify it by doing your own next two cuts, I would recommend finding a well reviewed devachan stylist."
curlyhair,3ccmt3,MarianneDashwood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:04:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I do not trust myself to cut my hair ever, so that is unlikely to happen, but I can go longer between cuts when my hair is longer and my bangs are more grown out. That could mitigate the cost somewhat.  There does also seem to be a stylist near me who has a lot of positive reviews on Yelp for curly hair. I could maybe try her, too, or see if there are any reviews on Curltalk."

It's always bothered me but since it was buzzed short nobody really noticed the frizz except me. I grew out my curls in high school but I had no idea how to manage it back then. I shampooed every day, never used conditioner and always towel dried my hair. Basically, I was doing everything you should NOT do to treat curly hair. It looked like a birds nest afro of nappy/frizzy split curls. Real bad.

curlyhair,3c6rop,weaselbeef,3,Tue Jul 7 01:56:32 2015 UTC,I think it's curly. It looks like your hair is weighted down by it being thick. With a good haircut and proper hydration you could have some great curls

It's very thick and wavy but after doing the curly girl method I've coaxed out some wonderful curls!

curlyhair,3c6rop,Eyger,0,Sun Jul 5 23:07:50 2015 UTC,I would say curly as it spirals round...
curlyhair,3c88ff,riffdex,7,Sun Jul 5 20:41:27 2015 UTC,"It depends. Some people cut down on the frequency they wash their hair to begin with so they end up using less shampoo, some replace their shampoo with a gentler one, or they cut shampoo out completely. Those who cut it out completely typically use a cleansing conditioner or something similar in lieu of shampoo. I personally use Shea Moisture's cleansing conditioner because I found shampoos, even those without sulfates, still made my hair very dry and frizzy. I only wash my hair once a week, no more than twice if I'm swimming or sweating profusely."
curlyhair,3c88ff,meowie_wowie,3,Sun Jul 5 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"My deva stylist told me that if your products are CG friendly and adding moisture to your hair then build up should not be a concern. Make of that what you will , though, as you know your hair best!!"
curlyhair,3c88ff,Skipthebeans,2,Mon Jul 6 01:26:39 2015 UTC,I've been doing some kind of CGM since I was gifted Lorraine Massey's book when I was a teenager. The only time shampoo has touched my hair since then is when I get my hair colored and my deva stylist uses the DevaCurl no poo or low poo. I never have problems with build up or my hair looking greasy. I just make sure I rub the pads of my fingers against my scalp while I have the conditioner in. Going on almost a decade of no shampoo and I would never look back.
curlyhair,3c88ff,lynnb496,2,Mon Jul 6 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"I did it for about a year, and I wouldn't say I got build up, but my hair was kinda greasy and limp some days. I have really oily skin and really fine hair, though. I think if you had thicker hair, and/or normal to dry skin it would be fine.  I still do not use silicones, and I use a sulfate-free shampoo a few times a week. This works better for me than only co-washing."
curlyhair,3c88ff,ronniejean1,2,Mon Jul 6 12:00:51 2015 UTC,I shampoo with paraben/sulfate free shampoo once a week and cowash the other days.  If you scrub your scalp (vigorously but gentle) you can remove all buildup with your shampoo or conditioner.
curlyhair,3c88ff,atheologist,2,Mon Jul 6 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"I'm finding that I can cut down shampooing to 2-3 times per week and use a cleansing conditioner on the in between days. My hair is 2c/3a + fairly fine and thin and I've been using sulfate-free shampoo for years anyway due to dyeing and otherwise processing it. I'd always thought I needed to wash with shampoo daily because of how oily it can get, but I'm realizing that the ends are actually fairly dry, too, and cowashing seems to be helping with that."
curlyhair,3c88ff,phoenix_green,2,Mon Jul 6 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not a professional but from experience I can say you do not eventually get buildup or gunk. I use a sulfate free shampoo (deva curl low poo) plus sulfate free conditioner (one condish but there are cheaper options) plus leave in conditioner and deva curls ultimate defining gel and I never have build up issues. I think silicone based products cause the buildup. Silicone is not water soluble. CG products should be.  I really don't feel like I need sulfates at all. I do need a sulfate free shampoo, co-washing isn't enough for how thick my hair is. Several companies make CG friendly shampoos. I would look into them if co-washing isn't getting the results you need. If you just started the method give it a few weeks. You need time to let you hair adjust to not using sulfates and using its natural oils to moisturize."

I would recommend adding a rinse out conditioner to this list as well.  If you're going to buy a SM Masque, I really like the Jamaican Black Castor Oil one. It smells awesome and has Keratin in it.  Kinky Curly Knot Today is well loved for a reason, just saying. You can't go wrong there.  I don't know what you would get out of the oil with this line up. Is your hair on the coarse side? I'd definitely recommend adding a gel or mousse for clumping, frizz control, and holding your curl for multiple days."

I use it as a leave in rather than as a detangler in the shower and have noticed far fewer tangles in my next shower whenever it's used like that.  If you want to buy oils, it may be cheaper to go straight to a supplier rather than a name brand. Garden of Wisdom, for example, sells macadamia oil, and are known for selling high quality oils with no added fillers. They also have sampler packs available. That said, you might also be able to find bottles of pure oil on Amazon!"

curlyhair,3c8j6u,phoenix_green,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:29:24 2015 UTC,I don't know how tight your curls are or what pattern they have so I don't know how well it would look on you but you could always go shorter on the sides and longer in the front. Something like this or this or this. It always helps to talk to a stylist and show them a few pictures of what your kind of going for in order to get their opinion. The sidebar has some information on finding a hairdresser that understands curly hair.
curlyhair,3c6d4v,keiramarie,3,Sun Jul 5 06:51:13 2015 UTC,"Been following the curly girl method for about two weeks now and I'm seeing so much improvement in the softness of my hair and definition of my curls! Sorry it's hard to get good photos of curls because my hair is so black! Hard to find some products because in in Australia. I've done my best :)   Here's my new routine in case you're interested, open to any constructive criticism also :)   Cowash - Tresemme perfectly undone weightless moisturising conditioner  Squish to condish leave in conditioner - palmer's repairing conditioner (no surfaces or parabens) and a tiny bit of Tony & Guy creative texturising glue scrunched into the ends  Plop with the leave in moisturiser and texturising glue for one to two hours"
curlyhair,3c5alx,Miwwies,8,Sat Jul 4 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"After years of straightening my hair, 4 keratin treatments and a bad breakup, I had enough of all this nonsense and needed a change. I decided to embrace my curls and went CG. It wasn't easy at first and my hair was pretty bad in the beginning. But I put my straightener aside, and changed my hair care routine. There were many bad hair days down the road but it was worth it.   I no longer user hot tools, aside from a diffuser during winter. Going out with wet hair when it's -20C outside is a big no-no.   Basically, I co-wash my hair with conditioner, banned shampoo from my life, use coconut oil, squish to condish and plop for about 15 minutes. I wash my hair every 3 days and sleep with a sexy pineapple mess on top of my head.   Sometimes pieces of my hair will look funny and won't behave. To fix that, I run a finger under water and slightly wet the strand of hair that aims to misbehave. Then, I curl said strand of hair around a finger and secure the curl in place with a bobby pin. I leave it like that to air dry for about 15 minutes while I do my makeup, then take out the bobby pins. This leaves me with natural looking curls that blend in with my curl pattern.   Products that I use:   Either TRESemé Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner or Garnier  Fructis Pure Clean Fortifying Conditioner to cowash, squish to condish and as a leave in (whatever is on sale) Coconut oil on my ends. I got a 1L bottle of liquid (fractionated) coconut oil online from New Directions with a drop bottle. It's easier to apply the oil on the dry patches of my scalp this way. I guess the solid coconut would also work, but for me liquid is best. Garnier Fructis Style Pure Clean Styling Gel   That's it. I used to spend tons of money on salon products in hopes of having soft, shiny hair. I have that hair now, thanks to the CG method. Sometimes there's still frizz when the weather is particularly humid, but I'm really satisfied with my curls now :)"

If you don't like the stiff, crunchy feeling, you can scrunch the hair once its dry to break the cast of the gel.  Your hair will feel softer, but won't sustain a wet look, so experiment and see which way you like it.  I'm not sure why you were down voted.... Maybe lack of routine and pictures?

I've noticed quite a few international folks can get things from that site.  As far as your frizz goes, have you tried leaving most of your conditioner in your hair and applying your products in the shower before removing any water? Do you squish your conditioner in?  If you were able to achieve tighter waves before, then you can do it again. It's all about proper technique and using the right products for your hair type and weather."

curlyhair,3c612a,sassycatmeow,2,Mon Jul 6 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :)  Make sure you squish your conditioner in, you want it to really penetrate the cuticle. Properly hydrating your hair will make it look a little darker, but it will feel and behave a lot better. I just had my first curly cut and my stylist recommended that I work the conditioner in starting at the ends, squish the conditioner into the hair, let it sit for a while, and then do a quick rinse to distribute. Literally like 5 seconds of rinsing. This technique seems to work well for me, but you might have to adjust how much you rinse out depending on how fine your hair is."

I've never seen it recommended here, but I actually use a concentrator attachment with the dryer on the low speed (I alternate between low and high heat before finishing with cool air), with great results.   Just make sure you have the concentrator oriented vertically, your hair will barely move at all (protecting your fragile curls) and the concentrated airflow will ensure your roots dry first instead of your ends. Hope this helps!"
curlyhair,3c4sld,riotkitty,5,Mon Jul 13 21:21:57 2015 UTC,I sometimes plop my hair into a very loosely woven sweater and then blow dry it with a normal blow dryer.  I haven't bought a diffuser yet because this works pretty well actually!

curlyhair,3c382w,dee_marie,6,Sat Jul 4 09:26:30 2015 UTC,"You're going to love it. I lived in NY with frizzy hair until I was 27, then came out to Denver and my hair has looked great since! It's so dry here and barely ever rains. I feel shallow but it's honestly one of the reasons I'd never go back. Bad hair days for years and years makes me appreciate the good ones.   Only thing I'd say is that my hair has gotten less curly over the years. It's wavier and almost straight in the winter now. Not sure if that's from the weather changing it over time or hormones or aging or something else? My hair looked great when I first got out here because it was really curly and not frizzy at all, now I kind of miss the tighter curls ironically. I think it may be producing more oil. My hair really hasn't dried out at all, but I have heard that can happen. In NY I could get away with washing my hair every three days, but now I have to do it every other day. I use way less product though, and it dries way faster. No waiting for your hair to dry all day."
curlyhair,3c382w,sarasander,2,Sat Jul 4 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"Out west with less humidity (Colorado, northern Texas, OK) I still had some frizz. But definitely less frizz. But my hair was also definitely less curly - more wavy. And I don't recall having a problem with dry hair, I feel like my hair might have been softer out there because in past photos it looks smoother and shinier, but I was also younger and the whole frizz thing.  As soon as I came out east to southern Ohio, my curls perked up and are bouncy. I control the frizz with a hefty amount of conditioner."
curlyhair,3c382w,reijn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"Huh, funny, all of us are having different experiences completely.   I found dry climates (used to live in Nevada) were HELL on my curls. My hair would air dry to 1C/2A consistency, and no amount of curling irons/rods/etc would bring them back for more than an hour or two. I'd also have to load up on leave-in to make sure I wouldn't frizz into static (literally, individual strands standing up and out!). I need more humidity to perk them up and pull in moisture. That said, I have low-porosity hair, which could certainly be part of the issue.   Deep conditioner will be your new best friend, no matter what. Don't underestimate the lack of humidity in the desert."

curlyhair,3c3aif,tamara135,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:09:00 2015 UTC,"Not all alcohols are bad. Some contain fatty acids which are super good for your hair. So, if you're not having an adverse effect from the products(s) you're using with it, don't worry!    The way I work around the product-on-scalp issue is to make sure I rinse my scalp of conditioner (in the shower) before applying products. It's fine to leave it on my lengths and ends, but my scalp should be wet and clean.   When I apply leave-in, I go up to my ears only, nowhere near the roots. When I apply curl creme, that can go all the way to my roots, but I focus on my ends and lengths first, so that whatever is going on the roots is minimal.   When I plop, I lay my lengths out as much as possible on the t-shirt. Then, I fold the t-shirt in over the lengths, about halfway towards my scalp. My lengths are now half-covered and also half-folded. That way less of the product on my lengths and ends is going back onto my scalp, it's instead being absorbed by the layer of t-shirt in between. After that first half-fold, then I fold the remainder so I can start twisting the arms into the turban shape.   I hope that makes sense. It's hard to describe without showing you, but I also don't do videos =/    For protein treatments, are you looking for at-home remedies or commercial/retail? I don't do at-home, but if you're willing to shell out the cash, I highly recommend Kerastase."
curlyhair,3c3aif,hashtagphag,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:10:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for answering! I think you're  absolutely right. If I'm not seeing any adverse effects, why would I stop using a product which leaves my hair looking and feeling wonderful. This alcohol is, though, a bad alcohol. I looked up the ingredient list. It contains two bad ingredients: isopropyl alcohol and  citric acid. But, as I've said.. This is the ONLY silicone free leave in I was able to find where I live. In my country's market in general. I won't stop looking, of course. Maybe the day will come when I find a good leave in without silicone, bad alcohols, and similar bad ingredients. I, too, do not apply any  product onto my scalp, my only problem was that all of the product that I apply to my length gets transferred to my scalp during plopping. But, I think I somewhat understand your way of plopping and I will definitely try it and see how it works. I have researched online and the only at home protein treatments with protein small enough to penetrate the hair is gelatin. I've yet to try it because it just send so messy. As far as Kerastase goes, I have heard excellent things about it, but I've yet to find it."
curlyhair,3c3yx5,whoMe83,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly the difference doesn't matter. You may have a range of curl types like many do.

Porosity and density will probably matter more, especially in terms of what products work for you."

curlyhair,3c1yz2,zensquared,2,Sat Jul 4 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"Anything by SheaMoisture is 100% CG-approved. I'm not familiar with Honest Company, but I just reviewed the ingredients I wasn't familiar with and it looks good.     If you're ever concerned, check out this site where you can look up the ingredients. Her recommendation of Good/Okay/Caution/Avoid isn't always 100% CG (she's basing it upon common usage PLUS what works for her), but she does a good job explaining what all of the ingredients are regardless.   If you find your baby's hair starts getting brittle or strawlike, you may want to look into other shampoos or conditioners. Both of those have a good amount of proteins and/or polyquats, which some people can have an adverse reaction to. FWIW, I'm not a cherub curly but I do have really fine/thin hair, and don't have any problems with either."

curlyhair,3c0ogb,animousity692,4,Fri Jul 3 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"Dry/frizzy/strawklike sounds like protein overload. A lot of SheaMo products have proteins, so that might be it. What I'd really suspect though is that your Aussie Moist and Carol's Daughter conditioners have silicones (Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone and Amodimethicone). Those are gonna coat your strands artificially, giving an appearance of moisture, but actually prevent your hair from taking it in."
curlyhair,3c0ogb,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! Didn't realize all three of my options were problematic. That makes sense because SheaMoisture always starts working great and then after a week or so seems to be less effective. And I have no idea Carol's Daughter conditioners would have silicones, I guess I didn't check because it's marketed so specifically for natural curly hair (so I thought).  Do you have any recommendations for affordable, low protein conditioners?"
curlyhair,3c0ogb,hashtagphag,2,Sat Jul 4 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"The SheaMo may be working, but the silicones would be negating any effect by effectively sealing everything in, not letting any other moisturizers penetrate. Try switching to other conditioners for a bit and see if that helps.   Alas, for low-protein, I've pretty much got nuthin'. My hair craves protein so my conditioners are loaded with them. The only one that's protein-free is a leave-in: Kinky Curly Knot Today. Try checking this site though, I've filtered the search results to protein-free for ya =)"

curlyhair,3c1dgc,unfunnypun,3,Sat Jul 4 04:58:29 2015 UTC,"I'm  not able to get the link now, but look up super soaker on youtube. It's basically like the squish to condish method, but over the sink, and I think if you fill the sink after getting out of the shower (soaking wet) you can use a sink full of water to squish into your hair."
curlyhair,3c1dgc,Curly_Alice,3,Fri Jul 3 22:10:18 2015 UTC,oooh! that's a pretty good idea. thanks for the info!
curlyhair,3c1dgc,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"I fried my hair recently (a different story, I'll post once I have a resolution) and found I needed to modify my S2C method a bit. I have long hair, but I think my modification may help?      After shampooing/cowashing, I thoroughly wet my hair (standing upright like normal). I then pile conditioner in from root to tip, making it slimy like S2C recommends. I leave it like that while I finish the rest of my shower. When I'm ready to S2C, I splash a little water onto the top of my head only, just enough to rinse the conditioner from my roots and scalp. Then I squish... with all the loads of conditioner that's been sitting there, and very little rinsing since I only splashed a little bit of water in up at the top.     Once I feel like I'm not getting much of anything squishing out anymore, I splash a little more water on, and squish some more. During all of this, I'm upright, well maybe a teensy bit bent at the waist - but I'm not upside down at all. Doing this modified version allows even the squished-out conditioner to travel back into my hair, allowing for further moisturizing. I do this until my hair feels like most of the conditioner has been rinsed and squished out.    FWIW, my hair has never stopped dripping water after S2C. Most curlies recommend applying products while your hair is still sopping wet. I always end up needing to wring my hair out before applying products though, or I don't get good coverage."
curlyhair,3c1dgc,hashtagphag,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:26:26 2015 UTC,so you're not adding anymore water when you squish - just what you splashed on your head at the start? definitely seems like it would work better for the back of my head. i'll give it a whirl.
curlyhair,3c1s5m,plinthe,2,Fri Jul 3 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"I never got on the baking soda/ACV trend, but I washed my hair water only for a year, and my scalp and hair became super dry. I would recommend it if you're able to really massage your scalp and distribute the natural oils, but I think a boars hair type brush would be damaging (I didn't know it at the time). The first few months of water only was the healthiest my hair had ever been at the time, before it became very dry. I would occasionally use ACV or lemon juice rinses when my hair felt super dirty, and they were helpful, but didn't help with moisturizing my hair. That being said, I still struggle with keeping my hair moisturized and I've been using the CG method for over a year now, so water only might work better for you.  Your hair might have met it's terminal length, but it might also be dry due to your simple routine. You might need to find a leave-in to use along with or instead of argon or coconut oil if you're wanting your hair to be healthier (sleeker, grow longer).   I would recommend you try looking for a natural leave-in conditioner. I just purchased this conditioner from Sally's. I do want to warn you that there are many other ingredients included that aren't listed here, but I appreciate that the first ingredients listed are natural and moisturizing. This As I am leave in I've read good reviews about and it has fewer ingredients. Kinky Curly Knot Today is highly recommended and has fewer ingredients, but isn't moisturizing enough on it's own for me. If you're inclined, you might want to try to make your own conditioner, but I cannot advise you on that.  For now, I recommend that you use a harsher sulfate shampoo to remove the buildup from the leave-in product you tried. This wouldn't harm your hair (if done occasionally) and would hopefully make your hair feel normal."

Might be worth a try.  Alternatively since it's summer (and I hear you're getting one this year!) you might try a sea salt spray, which will give you a beachy controlled ""frizz"" instead of the contrast between styled and ""help what happened"".

curlyhair,3bys1x,yourhaploidheart,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Thinking back to what I struggled with when I moved from Virginia to the ""Beach Cities"" in SoCal...is the water harder where you are now? You can usually look up municipality water reports and compare the hardness between your old home and your new.   You can also look at whether the sink fixtures/shower glass have hard water stains. If the water is harder, then the minerals are building up on your hair too. Shower filters don't really affect hard minerals. I think a house water-softener is the only full solution. I'm a renter, so I know what a crappy/untenable solution that is.  If you want to test this, you can try either just rinsing your hair with distilled water at the end of your shower, or go all-out and do your whole wash/condition/rinse routine with distilled water once or twice. If it does make a difference, you will want to look into using a chelating shampoo occasionally (Ion Hard Water Shampoo gets recommended a lot; I think you can find it at Sally Beauty). Supposedly, an apple-cider vinegar rinse can help with hard water too, but I've never had much success."

Right now I cowash with SheaMoisture African black soap balancing conditioner, though I use SheaMoisture Smooth + Repair conditioning shampoo  about once every week and a half (not my FAVORITE, but I wanna use up the bottle). I always pre-poo with coconut oil, letting it sit on my head for 20 minutes or so before washing. I use a smidge of this L'Oreal deep conditioner as a leave in, then rake and shake with argan oil and SheaMoisture curl and style milk. I kinda play deep conditioning by how dry my hair feels, but it usually ends up being about once a week. For that I use my own mixture of virgin coconut oil, a little honey, some macha if I've got it, and a generous helping of the L'Oreal conditioner I mentioned above. I stick it under a shower cap and let it soak for about 45 minutes before rising out.  I'm still working on consistent volume, but I'm pretty happy with the definition and spring I get from this method.  PS: No, he's an African grey parrot! But I'll tell him you think he's a pigeon.

curlyhair,3bwfhc,mokro,3,Thu Jul 2 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"So, the point of a dry cut is to cut with your curls.  So instead of a stylist saying, ""If I cut off this much your curls will shrink up to 'here'"",  They can actually cut your curls to the length/layers you want without having to make that estimate of how much it will curl up.  So with that being said, having a dry cut with your hair blown out straight is almost identical to having a wet cut with your hair combed out straight.  There are also likely parts of your hair that are curvier than others.  When your hair is cut straight (wet or dry), there's no accounting for that, and your hair will look uneven when you wear it curly."
curlyhair,3bwfhc,brattylilduck,7,Fri Jul 3 02:49:53 2015 UTC,"The curly girl method is very much against blowing hair straight. Its very damaging to porous, curly hair. However, your hair is not as curly as many girls on this forum, so a blowout might not be as damaging as it would be for a 3 or 4 curl.

So everything is nice and even when it's straight, but as soon as it dries, my bottom layers (which are much curlier than the top layers) shrink and it looks ridiculous. There's a difference of 1-2 inches between the bottom and top layers because my stylist doesn't cut the curls individually.  This wasn't something I noticed until starting CG, but I'm definitely going to get my hair cut dry and curly from now on.

I use a hair band to keep my plopping-shirt together too... nothing wrong with that! I'll try to describe what I do to get it tight on the first try, not sure if I can explain it well though. First I twist the arms/ends 2 or 3 times, which isn't nearly tight enough. But now that I have these 2 twists, I at least have enough leverage to hold them both in one hand. With my other hand now free, I grab the end or arm of one of the twists and start twisting more - the remaining end/arm of the twist I'm working on is gripped in my palm that's holding the other still-loose twist. Once that one is tight, I work on the other one."

curlyhair,3bva2p,hashtagphag,2,Fri Jul 3 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"Second day hair means they aren't washing their hair on the second day. They're encouraging the dry style they had from the first day without redoing everything.   They may still be showering, but are avoiding wetting their hair either by using a shower cap or other methods. The hair should remain as dry as possible during the shower. They sometimes do use a little bit of product on second day hair though. The most common, from what I've seen, is mixing a conditioner with water in a spray bottle. They spray their curls to revive moisture, and perhaps scrunch a bit to revive with the products left in their hair from the first day."

The only thing that seems to calm it down is to use a sulfate shampoo every few days.  My question is: if I deep condition my hair on the regular, use coconut oil on the ends, and use a leave-in after that, will I be ok? Should I keep trying different sulfate-free shampoos until I find one that doesn't react? Anyone else had this experience?"
curlyhair,3bva2p,TunicSongForKaren,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have pre-existing buildup on your scalp, that -when using CG products- causes breakouts.  Clarify really thoroughly with a clarifying shampoo that does contain sulfates but doesn't contain silicones/parabens/petroleum/glycerin/polyquaternium/oils/butters.  Then, clarify further using a paste made from lukewarm water and bentonite clay, leave it on for half an hour with a shower cap on, and then rinse out with copious amount of CG conditioner.  use (diluted with water) tea tree oil on your scalp if that doesn't work, or lather your hair with honey. Both ingredients are clarifying, antifungal, antimicrobial and reduce dandruff, acne, and other scalp problems.   You could even use baking soda if that doesn't work either, but don't use it regularly, as it is very drying and damaging when used over extended periods.  If you keep having problems after that, look out for CG products that don't contain coconut oil, butter and polyquats. One of these three could make your scalp break out. Try to find out which one by a process of elimination.  If it STILL persists after that, see a dermatologist and let him proscribe a good medicinal shampoo to use for a couple of weeks."

The main issue with sulfates is that they're drying, and it's definitely possible to combat that.   I'm wondering if you may be having an allergic reaction to some of the 'poos you've been trying, or if you're getting product buildup on your scalp and it's clogging your pores. What's your routine like normally? Do you plop?"

I also have lots of allergies! I'm just a mess haha.  My routine before I started adding in sulfates again was washing daily with conditioner (Shea Moisture or DevaCurl No-Poo), conditioning after washing with Shea Moisture, every third day washing with a sulfate-free shampoo (usually Shea Moisture), and every sunday I'd completely coat my hair in coconut oil and wash it out after an hour.   My hair looked AMAZING but my scalp was an itchy, rashy, horrible mess.   I don't plop or use styling products (I use CG approved ones) unless I'm going out somewhere nice (I'd say maybe once every couple months). I usually gather all my hair and twist it into a long rope, secured at the back of my head with a hair tie."
curlyhair,3bva2p,hashtagphag,2,Fri Jul 3 16:53:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I wonder if you may need a more lightweight cowash. Maybe the DC or SM lines are a little too heavy? Are you making sure to really scrub your scalp hard with your fingers? Since there's no foam action happening, our fingers have to loosen any grime or build-up instead, and we have to rinse it all out fully.   Do you think that coconut oil might be a problem? Almost all of the SM lines have that, so maybe the combo of the ingredient plus the actual oiling you're doing is causing build-up. Or maybe something else in the SM line is causing you to break out... there's lots of oils/extracts in them, so maybe you're having a mild allergic reaction.   Oh wait, I just thought of something right before I was about to submit this. You said you would coat your hair completely with coconut oil, but you were also using sulfate-free shampoo. I'll bet the oil hasn't been getting fully washed out, and has been building up on your scalp and clogging your pores. You don't need sulfates to wash out coconut oil, but you do need to thoroughly shampoo afterwards. Doing some looking around on other sites, most people recommend shampooing at least twice to get it all out."
curlyhair,3bva2p,Curly_Alice,2,Fri Jul 3 17:18:39 2015 UTC,"This doesn't apply to OP's question, but I want to comment in case someone else is reading this and thinks they need to use  a shampoo after coconut oil.  Not everyone needs to use a shampoo to get coconut out. It's often recommended because it can be difficult to cowash or rinse out. I can personally rinse coconut oil out with water, and can have a good hair day without using a cowash or another conditioner. It's not consistent, so I wouldn't rely on this though.   If someone is sensitive to coconut oil or has problems rinsing it out, they should try a shampoo, but for many people with curly or wavy hair, just a cowash or conditioner wash will remove the coconut oil from the hair and can be less harsh."

curlyhair,3bva2p,hashtagphag,2,Mon Jul 6 10:59:33 2015 UTC,"Co-washing is using conditioner to wash your hair, rather than shampoo. Most of us prefer to use a lightweight runny/watery conditioner so it's easier to rinse. We still add our regular moisturizing conditioner to our hair afterwards... the runny conditioner is just meant to be a substitute for shampoo.   A clarifying conditioner... honestly, I haven't heard of this. Maybe it's the compliment to a clarifying shampoo? I'd check out the ingredients in clarifying conditioners thoroughly to make sure there aren't sulfates or silicones.   Sulfate-free shampoo is just that. A shampoo that doesn't have sulfates. Sulfates tend to be harsher on our hair because they strip all product residue out. While that's a good thing if we're experiencing build-up, regular stripping causes our hair to be more dry.   How often you wash, with any of these, is up to you and how your hair feels. When I first went CG, I alternated sulfate-free shampoo with co-washing. I didn't want to experience the ""transition"" period where your scalp can sometimes be a little greasy. As time has gone on, I've been able to introduce more and more co-washing. Some curlies are able to skip washing for a few days, allowing for 2nd/3rd/4th day curls. I myself can't though =)   You know if your hair needs extra cleaning if it's looking lank and lifeless and/or greasy - that usually means there's product build-up. It's recommended that you shampoo with sulfates prior to going CG, to make sure products and silicones are stripped off your hair. Every now and again though, it may be necessary to do it again."

Curl Junkie products are on their way to me from CurlMart- deep conditioners to combat some dryness and one of their gels to hopefully better combat humidity (the Shea Moisture has humectants, CJ also but less so).  If you do find a more expensive product that works really well or just want to try some, CurlMart occasionally has 20% off sales that stack with a 15% off coupon (WELCOME or CM15).

Shake curls off of scalp by sliding your fingers in close to scalp and shaking back and forth while still upside down. Blow dry with diffuser upside down while squishing. Focus on the length.

I don't like your red hair dye, I think  black would suit you much better. maybe use pantene shampoo + conditioner, or a mousse to soften your hair a bit.  don't get me wrong i think your hair looks good as it is but it has so much potential... >_>  btw how old are you? you look very young"

It's fading out anyways and then I just leave it alone for months. I do use that Pantene 2 in 1 conditioner and shampoo stuff, but because I dyed it in using 2 in 1 color shine.

curlyhair,3btqy7,Leafeon013,4,Thu Jul 2 02:04:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the curly girl community thinks curl activators are ok, but you should check out Long Aid Curl Activator gel (it's like 4 bucks at walmart) or Smooth N Shine Curl activator gel (same at walmart for like 3 bucks).  During your shower, condition your hair and use a wide toothed comb to comb out your hair of knots and what have you. Before you get out of the shower, flip your hair upside down and use a tiny bit of conditioner and scrunch your hair upside down to get some curls going, squeezing any excess water and conditioner out, it will keep your curl pattern.  When you get out of the shower, don't dry your hair and use a good dollop of curl activator gel (don't worry, curl activator gel isn't an actual gel, it is mainly used for frizz/moisture control and curl definer. Most curl activator gels have water and a humescent i.e. aloe vera), flip your hair upside down while wet and scrunch your hair with the gel. You're going to want to experiment on how much to use, but I recommend using like 3 dollops total. Scrunch your hair till it feels like it's evenly distributed, and flip it back to normal.   You can now plop it (youtube has videos on how to plop) or blow-dry it using a defuser. Honestly, it's the best stuff I've ever used and I just can't go full curly girl because I have to wash my hair, it's been way too hot to not.   Edit - This is my hair with curl activator gel. I literally use nothing but suave naturals shampoo and conditioner, along with the Long Aid Curl Activator Gel. I've used the Smooth N Shine and that stuff works great as well. Leaves my hair very soft to the touch, no hardness at all.   http://i.imgur.com/731osjw.jpg"

Since you don't mind purchasing online, you could use this site: http://shop.britishcurlies.co.uk/. Or Amazon, of course. From an old thread I found, other UK curlies have recommended Naked, L'Oreal Eversleek, and Boots (not just anything found in the shop, literally their brand).   There's TONS of products out there for us curlies with fine hair. For a leave-in conditioner, I've been loving Kinky Curly Knot Today as well as MopTop. I use a curl cream for thick/coarse curlies instead of fine/thin curlies and really like it, but others may not... if you want to check it out, SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Really, I'd recommend anything from SheaMoisture though.   I think you'll find once you switch to CG, your hair will react way differently to products. When I was straightening every day, my hair was weighed down easily and I would get greasy at the roots. Once I washed out all the silicones and started alternating cowashing with sulfate free shampoo, all the grease went away (except for right around my hairline, since I have an oily face). Since you mentioned dry/brittle ends, I'd highly recommend S2C (Squish To Condish). It really helps lock more moisture in."

Blow-drying instead of diffusing. Both of these will totally pull out the curls.

curlyhair,3bqslf,hashtagphag,8,Wed Jul 1 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're using some CG methods, like scrunching and plopping, but not CG products, which is a major major part of being CG. Most of the change in people's hair when going CG can probably be attributed to not shampooing with sulfates, which it seems you're still doing multiple times per week/daily (as far as I know most of not all herbal essences shampoos have sulfates, and all the conditioners have silicones). I would suggest you start over the ""right"" way, maybe get the actual book Curly Girl which explains the method fully and in detail...where I live it's actually available in the library, but if not it's pretty inexpensive on Amazon as well."

Also let us know what products you're currently using and what routine you follow. :)"
curlyhair,3bqslf,alana_r_dray,3,Wed Jul 1 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"I had to try a zillion different things before it really worked for me, and it took WAY longer than 6 months to grow out all the damage I'd done from bleaching, dying, and straightening my hair.  Probably well over a year before I really could get into real curly girl methods and be somewhat pleased (lots of ponytails in the interim, and side braids) but it was worth it.  I can only speak from my routine but:  Skipping shampoo entirely (co-washing) doesn't work for me.  I use a gentle sulfate free shampoo pretty much every time I wash my hair.  Co-washing just caused horrible grease with no relief, my hair gets oily quickly.  I then soak my hair in silicone free conditioner while I body wash and shave if it's shaving day.  I finger comb and/or wide tooth comb my hair with the conditioner in.  I rinse pretty much all the conditioner out, then flip my hair upside down, comb it out with my fingers.  Then I add conditioner back in (modified squish to condish).  I then get out of the shower (head still upside down) and squish in some curly girl friendly mousse.  I waddle to my bedroom (head still upside down, hence the waddling) and then plop my hair in a t-shirt.  Then I get ready for the morning (cook breakfast, make my bed, feed/water the pets, do my makeup).  I take my hair out of the plop and it's still very wet.  I squish in some curly girl friendly gel after getting my part set out I want it.  I diffuse on medium heat and on low speed for about 20-30 seconds for each section of hair.  I don't really get my hair all that dry.  Then I dress and leave for the day.  On the way to work my air conditioner in my car and/or heater is usually running full blast and continues to finish drying my hair.  My hair is usually only damp when I get to work.  After it's fully dry I scrunch out the stiffness and BAM, curls set for several days.  I sleep with my hair loosely pineappled at night and my hair can go at least 2 more days before washing, sometimes more, but I usually do a messy bun or ponytail or braid on the last day.  When I take it out of the pineapple, I readjust the part and then sometimes add a bit of water on my hands and brush it on the roots to get the frizzies down, and then I'm fine to go.  For reference, my hair is really long (like halfway down my back, covers my nipples, long).  I get some sections that really spiral and some that are still wavier than they are actual spirals, but I'm still working on that.  I think a good ouidad or deva cut will help fix that issue, but I'm broke at the moment, and those cuts are expensive.  I don't dye my hair anymore (it's still dyed at the ends but basically my natural color, though a little lighter at the ends), and the only heat I use is the minimal diffusing in sections.  Once in a blue moon (like 1x every 6 months) I'll straighten my hair, but it takes forever so it's rare.  I tried plopping overnight and HATED it.  My hair does a lot better with 30-60 minutes in a plop and light diffusing after.  I think the diffusing mostly helps solidify the ringlets and set the roots as curlier.  I tried about 1007 different variations before I got this routine.  It's probably been 3 years since I cut out straightening and about 2 since I got my first curly girl specific cut, and I'm still a work in progress to improve the rest of my hair to ringlets."

curlyhair,3br36k,shedgum,3,Wed Jul 1 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"This isn't a good co-wash conditioner. It has silicones in it, which will likely build up in your hair in time.    I have a few suggestions for a co-washing conditioner: Suave naturals makes a load of nice scents, SUPER cheap, and they are silicone free. I currently use Tresemme's Perfectly Undone conditioner as my co-wash- it has a lot of slip, smells good, is still relatively cheap and silicone free.  Now we may have to work a little harder to find a leave-in conditioner, but I think that your hair needs it. With a little moisture, I bet your curls will look fantastic. :)  Oh god, thinning shears...shudder. Don't let her do that ever again.  Curly hair, when thinned out at the ends, looks super stringy. It looks like you have enough have to work with that you'll probably be fine, but I wouldn't let her near my head again with anything thinning.   To get slightly looser curls, you'll want to smooth your leave-in conditioner and gel/styling product on your hair between ""praying hands"". Meaning coat the inside of both of your hands with product, then put your hair in between and smooth your hands down your hair like you're praying.  It's not going to take you from a 4c to a 2a by any means, but it won't encourage the curl or encourage shrinkage to style this way.    It's really hard to see your curl pattern in that photo, but judging by a few of your bigger ringlets underneath, it looks like your curl is about the size of a sharpie marker in width, would you agree?  Sharpie Marker width is 3B, sidewalk chalk size width is 3A( just to clarify). :)"

curlyhair,3br36k,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Wed Jul 1 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"tresemme moisture rich conditioner   This one is also not CG- it has silicones.   Every product you use, rinse out or leave in, should avoid silicones if you are not using sulfates.  Co-wash your scalp and hair every time you wet your hair. If my hair looks great at the end of the day, I will cover it with a shower cap and not get it wet at all while I clean the rest of me.  Just a note: When you do co-wash, REALLY work that conditioner into your scalp with the pads of your fingers to help loosen up dead skin cells(dandruff, etc) and then make sure to rinse it off your scalp really well also.  I use a separate co-wash conditioner that is cheap(because you go through it pretty fast), and my other conditioner is also my leave-in.  I use Tresemme naturals Radiant Volume conditioner as my leave-in. After I rinse my co-wash, I gently squeeze out a bit of the water just so it's not dripping wet(but I don't ruffle the curls at all). Then I put a half dollar sized amount of the Tresemme Naturals conditioner in my palm, rub my hands together, then smooth it over my hair.  I like to coat my hair at this point with gel to help seal the moisture in. My favorite gels are LA Looks Sport Gel and Aussie Instant Freeze gel. Both of these are silicone free.   I'm not a good person to ask about bangs- I've never had them. Sorry! :) Have you searched the subreddit for posts on bangs? i'm sure there are some out there. Good luck!"

I ALWAYS do a deep condition afterward and usually I'll only have dryness for about a day after."
curlyhair,3briw2,drmephesto,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"Before you get in, soak your hair with tap water! If your hair is already saturated, it won't be soaking in as much chlorine and/or seawater. You can add a moisturizer or curl cream afterwards to further seal off the hair from chlorine and seawater. If it's long enough to tip in a bun at the nape of your neck or something, that's helpful, too. Afterwards, I'm usually fine with my no sulfate shampoo, but if there's really a lot of chlorine in your hair (and you can feel it!), you can use a gentle sulfate shampoo.  If you're gonna  be in the sun, bring a hat! UV damage is real."

Then I use L'Oreal's EverCurl Hydracharge conditioner, and sometimes I follow that up with the Creme of Nature Intense Conditioning Treatment for about 15-30 minutes. I drymy hair with a tshirt, scrunching it with the shirt in a sort of plopping motion up to the scalp and I just continue until it's damp. i then spray a bit of Not Your Mother's Beach Babe texturizing sea salt spray to define my hair slightly, then go in and use Styliste Ultîme's Elastin Curls & Moisture soft tousle spray which is honestly a life changing product for me, that helps my hair look the best. Then i set the blowdryer on cool and high and dry my hair, focusing on my roots, flipping my hair to each side and forward to add volume because I love my hair to be big and beautiful. I spray a bit of Not Your Mothers's Plump for Joy Thickening Hair Lifter at my roots and blow dry again and thats it! I bought all of the products at walmart and they were all very affordable, each under $10"

After run a tiny bit of the 'Schwarzkopf Extra Care BB' through my hair and spray with the 'Herbal Essences Tousle Me Softly Spray Gel', then plop for as long as I can.

curlyhair,3bncjc,cuddlefish333,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:30:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like we have similar hair. When I was little I had straight hair but around puberty it started to get wavier and frizzier and it took way too long for me to realize it had actually gotten quite curly since I always brushed it out everyday.   My hair is also pretty fine and here's how I care for it:   I shower every other day (most curlies go longer but I can't or I get itchy and greasy) and co-wash with Suave Naturals coconut conditioner or Jessicurl's Aloeba Daily Conditioner.  Once a week I use a sulfate free shampoo, currently using Jessicurl's Gentle Lather, and also deep condition with Jessicurl's Too-Sea Extra Moisturizing Conditioner.  After I shower I lightly dry it with an old cotton shirt and use products, I used to use Jessicurl's Gelebration Spray and Conident Coils which are designed for fine curls but I think they've been drying out my hair so I just switched to using Shea Moisture Restorative Leave-In Conditioner with a little bit of Garnier Fructis Marvelous Oil on the ends which is working well.  Other things for fine hair: I can't use a hair band on it, like ever. I recently got my first deva cut and the stylist had noticed I had a ton of breakage in my hair where I'd tie it up in a pony tail on off days and apparently even when I'd loosely put it up on a scrunchie at night it caused breakage so now I'm just using claws and bobby pins i I want it up or out of my face. It also seems to get tangled really easily and frizzes a lot but my stylist said if I can moisturize my hair better the frizz and tangles will reduce."

curlyhair,3blhy6,rlcute,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:45:24 2015 UTC,I'm assuming the dye job won't go over so well without brushing. There's probably little tangles and such so the dye won't distribute evenly.

curlyhair,3blhy6,moe-money,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:00:56 2015 UTC,"I dye my hair at home usually without brushing it first. I'll put the dye on my 2nd day hair, and just work on getting my hair coated with the dye. Once it's on then I'll take a wide toothed comb to try and detangle/comb through what I can. Be very careful though, your hair will probably be pretty prone to breakage at this point, so be gentle, and go section by section. So I avoid dry-brushing my hair, but still detangles and evenly distributes the hair dye."

The trick is to massage and scrub your head and really get the oils washed away when you're cleaning your scalp with either shampoo or conditioner. I also use the leave in conditioner and curling lotion from the loreal evercurl line. Sometimes when my hair is still damp I put some coconut oil on my ends to ensure a frizz free day.  I have to shower every day due to the gym, but if you can, I'd go a few days between washes (as long as your hair will let you). If I don't shower, my hair can now go 3-4 days without appearing greasy because my scalp for the first time ever, isn't completely dried out and over producing oil to compensate."

curlyhair,3birjl,ladieaupair,7,Mon Jun 29 15:49:47 2015 UTC,I use the VO5 tea therapy Blackberry Sage conditioner as my shampoo.  It doesn't lather but its thin and cheap enough to be able to really get in there and scrub your scalp and get whatever leftover product is on your hair out.  I tried using a thicker (Shea Moisture Coconut cowash) as my cowash shampoo and found it was too thick and greasy.  Plus it smelled to strong.  Honestly I didn't even notice no shampoo once I switched to the lighter conditioner.  Maybe try a lighter cowash product?  Like I said the VO5 is cheap! .99 cents a bottle.  Good luck.

Check the holy grail list for the SheaMoisture shampoos--they're very gentle but really help out with the greasy look.  Another thing to think about is using less condish on your scalp. You only need a very little to wash your scalp, and if you use too much you'll weigh down your roots. Don't despair! Experiment!"

You might try alternating cowashing and shampooing for a few weeks, then gradually introducing more and more cowashing.   I noticed in a comment below that you're still using sulfate shampoo, you might try switching to a sulfate-free one so your scalp isn't overcompensating with oil production on your ""off"" days. Are you close to a Walgreens or a CVS? I'm sure there's more, but I know they have these brands that you can use instead of TJs:    Suave Naturals (condish only) Tresemme Naturals (condish only) VO5 (Moisture Milks or Vanilla Mint condish only) SheaMoisture (shampoo and condish)    All the ""condish only"" ones are pretty lightweight, so you shouldn't get that heavy feeling after cowashing.

Over-moisturizing your hair is called ""Hygral Fatigue"". Based on what I've read about it, it refers to solely using deep conditioners when what your hair actually needs is protein. It tends to affect those with high porosity hair the most.   NOTE: for anyone who regularly bleaches/lightens their hair, regardless of your natural porosity, hygral fatigue can mimic the symptoms of extreme protein loss from over-processing (gummy hair, lost elasticity). Check with a stylist or other color-treated folks with knowledge in this area if you suspect you're experiencing this."

I use a spray bottle and get my hands wet, sometimes with a little product, and I smooth out my hair by lightly ""petting"" my hair towards the ends.  This seems to reactivate the product and any portions that were flattened or frizzed rejoin the ranks."

Also you can try putting it into french or dutch braids while it dries and then take out the braids and it's still pretty tame. I tend to like it getting poofy, so I generally wash and go and then refresh it by spritzing it with water mixed with conditioner and some oil to seal in the moisture.

When you make the appointment, say that you've gone sulfate and silicate free and ask if you can bring your own products. If they say no, it's a red flag. Also, one thing I've seen on here a few times is that you need to be prepared to get out of the chair and walk away if they start doing something that makes you uncomfortable.

curlyhair,3bb3l9,Paddysdaisy,5,Sat Jun 27 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"Certainly! Let me start by saying I live in a very dry desert climate, so my hair requires a lot of oil because it dries very fast. I don't recommend this method for people who tend to get oily hair or live in more humid climates... I wash my hair 1-2 times per-week with only VO5 conditioner. While the conditioner is in my hair, I comb it with a wide tooth comb and let the conditioner sit while I bathe the rest of myself. I finally rinse with cold or luke-warm water (I get cold easy so it just depends on how I feel.) I dry my hair with a soft t-shirt until it's damp but not dripping. This is when I apply my argan oil. Then after a little more drying, I apply just a little bit of R & B (not everytime, but when I want my hair to look and smell really nice. This product is expensive but I adore it and it has done wonders.) Right before it's dry I spritz a little CG friendly gel in. I tend to form my curls by gently squeezing my hair as it dries either with my hand or with a t-shirt. On non-wash days, I'll just wet my hair to reset my curls and put argan oil in it again. I never brush it or comb it except for that moment in the shower with the conditioner in. A couple times a month, I'll do a deep conditioner with all-natural coconut oil, but when I do this I have to put clean my hair a couple times since I'm only using conditioner. However the aftermath is fabulous. Hope this helps a little!"

I co wash and get all the knots and tangles out with treseme naturals conditioner. Then I use about half the amount of Shea moisture condition and squish it into my hair and let it sit either in a bun on top of my head or small braid as I finish my other shower duties. I rinse out about 80% with lukewarm water. I squeeze the water out to the best of my ability and plop with a cotton wrap thing for about 20 minutes. I use grainier leave in and I'm all set!

curlyhair,3bawm4,istorical,17,Sat Jun 27 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"You can experiment with shampooing less often (some people have best results with only shampooing once every 2-3 days, others once a week, others everyday), experiment with co-washing (only using conditioner most of the time and maybe using shampoo like once a week or once every 2-3 days or whatever), or experiment with different lengths.  I think you might look nice with a bit of the length removed on the sides and back to give it less of afro feel. See this post for an example of what I mean: http://i.imgur.com/Rc8OxDD.png"

As for the haircut, I've tried going to different hair stylers, trying to get a less afro-ish haircut, but no one has ever pulled off a good result so far.  In the past months I just tell them to cut it short (but not as short as in my first picture of the open post), usually getting results similar to this: http://imgur.com/dEf5ztq  I hope I will find a good balance between keeping long curls and having a good haircut."
curlyhair,3bawm4,janetplanet,2,Sun Jun 28 09:53:59 2015 UTC,"I recommend shampooing less or rarely. I only use shampoo after I do a deep conditioning with coconut oil every couple weeks. A low sulphate shampoo (or no sulphate). Dont be surprised if your scalp gets oily for a few weeks. It will take a couple of weeks for your body to realize your not stripping the oil anymore. You can still use water and conditioner all you want. Get a conditioner without silicone or the silicone will build up and you'll need a sulphate to get rid of it which will strip and dry out your hair. Mind you this is what works for me, you'll have to do some trial and error to find what works for you. I've found recently that my hair does even better if after rinsing I had a small amount of conditioner and don't rinse that out. Fun side note some scientists have found that using soap can get ride of the good microbes that live on our skin and scalp and may be leading us to get sick more often."

Link Her hair is lighter than yours, but more people have things like that going on, I don't think anyone is really bothered by your hairline except for you tbh.

That's very, very harsh on your hair, and turning a hairdryer on it without even silicone to protect the shaft a little is gonna create mad breakage and frizz. Overtime, I bet it's been very hard on your curl! Your hair looks fine, so I would suggest starting slow: A gentle shampoo, a light, silicone-free conditioner, and air drying! You can work from there."
curlyhair,3bd6v8,jellyajam,2,Sun Jun 28 04:53:41 2015 UTC,"Brushing and blow drying kills your texture. If you poke around the sidebar you can find some good info.

If I did what you do, the texture would look the same."
curlyhair,3bd6v8,yourhaploidheart,2,Sun Jun 28 04:37:07 2015 UTC,"NOTE: I'm writing all of this assuming you want to switch over to the CG-method.    I'd recommend alternating between shampooing and cowashing. I'm 100% there with you about greasy hair. Every time I get my hair done, my stylist recommends I don't wash for 4 days, and I laugh in her face. I wash every day, and found that alternating between cowash/shampoo has been totally fine with keeping the grease at bay.    You would need to change up your shampoo to a CG-approved one, which will be a little more expensive. But if you're alternating with cowashing, you'll use waaaaayyyyy less and it will last a long time. I spent about $10 on a shampoo 2 months ago, and am not even halfway through the bottle. You can definitely stick with less expensive conditioners if they work for you: VO5 Moisture Milk or Vanilla Mint are CG-approved, as are Tresemme Naturals and Suave Naturals. My hair is crazy dry from processing, so I use a cheap conditioner for cowash, and more expensive and hearty ones for regular conditioning.    You'll want to stop brushing and blow-drying, and instead comb out your hair in the shower while your conditioner is in. After you're out of the shower, air-drying is recommended... ditch the terry cloth towels, and instead use a t-shirt or a microfiber tower to get rid of some of the moisture (either plopping or scrunching). If you don't have time/ability to air-dry, use a diffuser, it's gentler on your curls. I dunno if there's any difference in brands and types of diffusers, my hair dryer came with an attachment.   Your moisture level looks pretty nice as of now, but once you switch to CG, it's pretty normal for dryness to appear overnight. That's because non-water-soluble silicones are heavy in most products, and silicones create the appearance of moisture by artificially coating the hair strand. Once they're gone, boom!, real hair underneath.   You'll also want to start using a leave-in conditioner after your shower (or simply leaving in some of your shower conditioner). It will really make a world of difference in helping your curls maintain their moisture throughout the day. Is your hair fine/medium/coarse? Looks ""fine"" to me from the pics, but I'm not touching it of course. And what about density, are you thin/medium/thick? Looks ""thin/medium"" to me. Asking so we can recommend products =)"

But, that's just me.  Since you're not a fan of dying hair, I would suggest looking into highlights which will make the greys less noticeable, and your stylist should be able to place them so that you don't have to get them done as often.  The grey hair is coarser, and might need more moisture to behave."

If I do it at home, I use Natural Instincts (semi-permanent), if at a salon I request they use a demi or semi permanent color. Don't pull out the greys! That's your hair! You don't want to inadvertently end up with a bald spot.  So, I guess what I'm trying to say is coloring does not necessarily equal damage. There are gentle options out there.  Has your curl pattern returned after the straightening? I can't really tell from the pictures. It looks mostly straight."

I don't think my hair is as curly as it used to be before straighteners but I'm working on it, feels like its taking a long time though and I'm always so tempted to back as I feel my hair looks tatty curly but lifeless straight, damned if I do, damned if I don't lol"

curlyhair,3bb268,APsychedelicMermaid,3,Sat Jun 27 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to color your hair, don't!  It takes money, time, and commitment.  If you don't want to do these things, you'll hate it and if you use permanent dye on your hair even once - you'll need years to grow it all out as long as your hair is.  There are ways to blend them in if you get to the point you want to.  Read up on the differences between semi and demi permanent dyes - I forget which one (I think drug store semi) does actually have the potential to lighten your hair a tiny bit.  Basically, you want to look for things like washes and glazes that only deposit color- but have ZERO lifting ability.  Highlighting sometimes works - but only if your grays are coming in evenly.  I have a streak at my temple, so highlights just looked weird, hehe.  I'm in my early 40's now and have been dying my hair forever.  Really want to stop, but man with roughly 30% white hair it just looks soooo bad in the transition that I've never managed to do it."
curlyhair,3bb268,Frose91,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:58:07 2015 UTC,I think a professional hair stylist would be able to dye your dyed hair the same(ish) tones as your natural hair or at least make the transition less harsh.

curlyhair,3bb268,resetrequired,2,Sun Jun 28 02:14:13 2015 UTC,"I zoomed in on your pics here and I don't see a single grey hair... I'm not saying you don't have them, but really they are not noticeable or even visible in pictures.  You should definitely rock it.  At least for now.  I'm 32 and I have a grey streak that I get compliments on all the time.  Grey seems to be ""in"" right now anyway.  Also because you have a baby face like me, we can get away with it.  Maybe we will change our minds later on in life, but while we're young let's not let this bring us down!  :-)"
curlyhair,3bb268,nati691810,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:11:59 2015 UTC,"Go to a salon! Don't dye it at home. Salon dye has other ingredients than box dye and won't destroy your hair/curls the way box dye does. If done professionally, you can easily dye it without damage. If you're really scared of damage, look into finding a salon that has Olaplex. Not that you'd need it unless you start dyeing every month or bleach it. There was a post a while ago from a girl who used Olaplex without dye and it helped her damaged curl texture immensely. Worth a try if it's hard to manage because of the years of straightening you did? (It's easy to find using search. I'm on mobile at the moment so I can't link)   You either go grey or you dye it, there's no other option unfortunately. It's not that bad though, going to the salon every 3 to 4 months for a dye. Sounds like less work and a lot better than pulling it out for 30 minutes each day."

curlyhair,3bb0g0,stenciloverdose,3,Sat Jun 27 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is one year of growth since then. Got undercuts for probably six to eight months of that year and since then just been getting the ends trimmed all over, but to be honest probably only had like 4 haircuts since that post.  Trying to document growth half for my own satisfaction and so I can just ""decide"" what length I prefer and not have to struggle to remember what stuff looked like, and also for the benefit of any dudes out there who have similar curl-type and want to know what would happen if they let things grow.  Still not sure if I actually like having long hair and have thought about shaving my head at least once a month but I'm going through an experimental phase of my life (also changing country + city every 3 months) to determine what's possible so trying to stick to it."

Plus the wind screws up long hair so much more than it does short hair. It's kinda funny I will walk down the beach for an hour and the wind will be blowing my hair backwards and then I turn around to head back and realize I'm gonna have my hair blowing in my face for an hour and go a bit crazy. No idea how longhairfolk deal with this problem besides I guess headbands or ties but I don't think I'm really at a length where that's a good solution yet. And I think that looks a bit strange on men.  I'd have to assume that lightening is due to sun exposure as its summer now and also I've been on the beach for the last couple weeks. Also possibly differences in lighting? My beard is definitely partially red / partially brown though. You can see that a lot in the second pic.  Quite frustratingly, whenever I ask for opinions on Reddit on long vs short hair and beard vs stubble, I always get even split in opinions."

I was there from November to February, and turned 18 while out there.  There are different intensities of wilderness therapy, and my program was on the extreme side of the spectrum.  A key part of the program is hiking - we would move sites ever couple of days.  No buildings, bathrooms, benches, just a clearing in the desert.  We would pick up food at the road twice a week. Stuff like beans and rice, trail mix, and tuna.  Unless you have a physical disability, I would recommend wilderness to just about anyone.  It's insanely different and challenging, but I never would have made progress without it."

She also said to put the product in as your hair lays, so flip it over and scrunch at the base of your neck, turn to the sides and do the sides, etc. Tbh I usually just flip and scrunch with a blob spread out in my hands and that seems to do the trick!

This picture was taken after I slept on my wet hair, with no product in it! My hair is severely damaged because i straighten it every day. I want to learn to love my curls, but I don't know what to do!! I just recently stopped using shampoo, because I learned it's not very healthy for your hair. I was an avid hair washer because the idea of having my hair greasy grossed me out. Anyways, I guess I just need some help in finding what products to use, and the best way to get my hair healthy and to have the best curls my hair can give."
curlyhair,3b9xoi,milkchalk,5,Sat Jun 27 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"You will find a ton of fantastic tips and suggestions in the new user's wiki found here! But here's my hair care routine that I use once a week, and it might work for you, too:  Products   SheaMoisture's Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo Suave Naturals conditioner Aussie Instant Freeze Sculpting Gel   Routine   In the shower before going to bed, I lather my scalp and roots in the shampoo. Wash out shampoo. Lather my hair (excluding my roots/scalp) in the conditioner. I mean, I just pour it on. I use A TON, and since I only wash my hair once a week, it never feels like I'm constantly buying more. De-tangle hair with fingers and remove excess hair that's totally falling out at this point. Leave the conditioner in and do other shower fun stuff. When ready, flip hair over and comb through it with fingers again, and add even more conditioner. Squish hair a bit to encourage natural curl, then squish to condish! My secret is I don't actually wait until it stops dripping. My back/neck can't handle that position very long, so I do it long enough to feel like my curls are in a good place and aren't totally soaked. Leave shower still bent over, and sqiush in about a 50 cent piece's worth of gel. I think this is one of the most important parts. Do NOT be afraid to use a dollop of gel, because you will squish out the gross-looking cast in the morning. Once I started using more gel, my curls started looking SO much more sculpted and healthy and bouncy and all-around more lovely. Plop for as long as I can before I need to sleep. This can be between 30 minutes and two hours. I haven't noticed a significant difference with timing. Once ready for bed, I flip my head over, take out the plop, then gently fan my hair out behind my head on the pillow and sleep. In the morning, I flip that hair over again and squish out the icky gel cast, and voila! Healthy happy curls!   That's my whole routine! Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll be happy to answer. <3"

If possible, could you post one of the ""behaved"" version and one of the ""poofy"" version?   For routine, what I mean is:   How often do you wash your hair? When you wash, are you using shampoo, and if so, which one? Do you use conditioner, and if so, which one? Any preferred styling products after you shower, or are you constantly rotating trying to find something that works? Do you towel dry, air dry, or blow dry?   I have thin hair too, so I can probably recommend some products that work with that. Is your hair fine, medium, or coarse textured? Do you know what your porosity is? Hair porosity can impact how well products are received by your hair. If you're not sure how to check for that, here's a few links that can help:    Link 1 Link 2 Link 3"

curlyhair,3b5n9n,Almathecool,20,Fri Jun 26 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"So first I got rid of sulfates and silicones ingredients within my shampoos and conditioners. I really like Shea Moisture's products for shampoo and conditioners because it specializes in curly hair and keeping moisture in.  My routine: I deep condition my hair once a week using organic coconut oil from trader joes. I heat in the microwave, section my hair off, and apply. I massage my scalp and add to my ends generously.  Next I shower. I always use conditioner (about 3/4 of my hair), then shampoo (only the scalp), and reapply conditioner. I then use a tooth comb to brush through my hair and reapply conditioner AGAIN. It's really important for your hair to contain a lot of moisture. I get out of the shower and use a 100% cotton t-shirt and to dry my hair. I flip my hair to one side, scrunch it with the t-shirt, then to the other and scrunch it. I then flip my hair upside down  and then scrunch with the t-shirt again. I then use Mixed Chicks leave-in-conditioner (about a quarter sized) and scrunch. Finally I let my hair just air dry.   To preserve the curls, I wrap my hair in what is known as a pineapple bun, and sleep on a satin pillow case.   Tl;dr It is WORK to have curly hair! Look up curlypenny on YouTube :)"
curlyhair,3b5n9n,Almathecool,3,Fri Jun 26 05:54:41 2015 UTC,I believe it is work but so worth it to have your beautiful curls. Still learning to love this hair.  Will check out curlypenny and thank you so much for your awesome response! :)

Also there's something else I like to do for wavy hair with no heat. I'm gonna sound like a weirdo but it works. Once I get out of the shower, instead of scrunching, I part my hair vertically to get 6 equal lengths. I then twist my hair all in one direction. After that, I put a beanie on my head. I let it air dry for two hours if I'm not going anywhere, or blow dry a bit if I need to go out somewhere. After it's dry, I take the beanie off, and just tease my hair with fingers. I then separate the twists and run my fingers through it just slightly. Gives me big waves throughout the day without too much volume and baby hairs flying everywhere from air drying."

curlyhair,3b8svy,1mprovement,3,Fri Jun 26 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, getting perfect curls is a lot of trial/error and messing with a lot of different products. The sidebar has some good products you might want to look for to begin with and see if they work for you.   Curly hair usually shouldn't be touched when drying, or that much even when dry, because if I touch my hair when it's wet, it usually becomes super frizzy. I also have a bad habit of playing with my hair even when it's dry and that does tend to frizz it also. So generally just not messing with it too much will help with frizz and curl definition.   Short or long hair is usually a personal preference but usually longer hair tends to elongate and stretch out curls because of the weight."

curlyhair,3ba2dv,sassycatmeow,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:54:35 2015 UTC,You should really try the CG method. Co-washing will be much more soothing on your scalp than any shampoo.
curlyhair,3ba2dv,yourhaploidheart,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"My hair does that (minus the itching) when I use silicone products, first, lovely softness, then horrible dry frizz. You could look on Amazon for Pure Argan Oil, should not be more than $20 for 120 ml, which will last you for months.   In alternative, you can be a bit more frugal and try unrefined coconut oil from the grocery store. If that doesn't work out you can use it for moisturizing or cooking (best popcorn ever!).  Another option is Jojoba oil from Trader Joes or Whole Foods, which also makes a nice moisturizer. Lastly, you can try Sweet Almond oil, also from the grocery store, which you can put on your hair before washing it, and makes nice and soft."

curlyhair,3ba2dv,hashtagphag,2,Sun Jun 28 19:52:10 2015 UTC,"You can get the soft hair from using straight up organic argan oil itself. Like hashtagphag said, it may be one of the ingredients in OGX since their products are usually blends with argania spinosa (organic argan oil). But I definitely recommend trying ORGANIC argan oil if you like the effect on your hair. The organic distinction makes a big difference (and is why name brands like Josie Maran charge a premium for them) because it is non-irritating to sensitive skin types. OGX's products are blended with argan oil but the other ingredients may irritate your skin and also are cheaper than pure argan oil, which lowers their manufacturing costs but still sort of provides the benefits of a premium oil like argan oil."

That being said, the sidebar contains a load of information that will help with the general curly stuff. I think you could do with changing your products.  Specifically about your Seb Derm and curly hair, your main issue will probably be that the medicated shampoos contain a heap of sulphates, which strip all the moisture out of your hair. A couple of things I've seen on here that might help; - coat your hair in conditioner/coconut oil before you apply the shampoo, to minimise the drying effect.  - if you feel comfortable changing your products, Shea Moisture do an African Black Soap shampoo, which is curly-friendly (sulphate free) and is designed for people with scalp issues. I've been using it at the moment because I've had a flair-up, and it's cleared it up in about 6 weeks."

curlyhair,3b4nm0,SheepWonderland,5,Thu Jun 25 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Typically the first thing you'll want to do is shampoo your hair a final time (or two) with a sulfate shampoo, to get rid of any buildup from non-CG products. Then you'll want to switch to CG products:    sulfate-free shampoo, should you feel the need for shampoo at all.  silicone-free conditioner, for co-washing if you want to ditch shampoo, and for regularly conditioning your hair in the shower. Oh yeah, and don't brush your hair... get yourself a wide-tooth comb, and only comb your hair while it's loaded up with conditioner in the shower.  silicone-free styling products: leave-in conditioner, and some sort of hold product like gel/mousse/curl cream.  deep conditioning treatments (also silicone-free).    You may go through a period where your hair looks and feels worse; this is normal as your hair and scalp adjust to being treated more kindly. Things will even out after a few weeks, and then you'll be on track.   Take a look at a couple links from the sidebar, and see if you can identify more about what type of hair you have and what types of products to look out for. I'd say you're a 2B/C due to your damage, but will likely curl up into the 3s as time goes on. You'll want to find out though if you have fine/medium/coarse strands, if your density is thin/medium/thick, and if you have low/medium/high porosity.   All of those things will make a difference in suggestions from all of us here for what's worked for us and what hasn't. Right off the bat though, I'd highly recommend deep conditioning treatments. I can tell your hair is dry from the picture.   This guide from a fellow curly is what helped inspire me to take the plunge into CG. Hope it helps you as well =)"

Some first steps, use cooler temperatures on your hair. Even if you want to use the straightener, you don't need it on the highest setting. This is what causes it to fry and for the ends to look like zig zaggy messes. When blow drying, use the low or medium setting.   Argon oil. For shampoo/conditioner/leave in/whatever.   If you want springy curls, get a diffuser. If you can't/whatever, dry your hair by flipping your head upside down and scrunching your curls as you dry them.   Products I love: biosilk hair therapy, deva curls-any of it, argon oil, Paul Mitchell sculpting foam (medium strength).  Hope this helps!"

curlyhair,3b4vix,sorrynancy,6,Fri Jun 26 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"Our curl pattern is very similar! I struggled with bangs for YEARS and finally gave up. I have thick hair, but straight bangs gave me a little weird scalp exposure too. Based on my experience, I think there are several options for keeping them but making your hair look thicker: 1. Cutting them thicker. I could be wrong, but I think it would help with the overall appearance of thickness. I can't really tell how much hair you have without looking at your scalp in person, though, so make this call yourself. 2. Transitioning them to a side swept bang a la this picture of Kiera Knightly. If they're a little more integrated with the rest of your hair, I think it would be easier to control how much of your scalp is showing through your hair, and a texturing spray or some other styling product might help, too. 3. And finally, though it sounds a little weird, a lot of people put a dark powder on their scalp to make the hair look thicker. There are powders you can buy for this purpose, but I've seen people just use eye shadow.   You could definitely do a combination of the three!  On that note, it doesn't look nearly as bad as you think it does! Your darker hair creates more of a contrast, which is probably why you think it's so striking. And the bangs frame your face nicely. :) Good luck!  PS: Your aunt is a weeeeiiiiird person, who does that???"
curlyhair,3b4vix,jellyajam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"I second numbers 1 and 2.   As someone with curly hair AND a hairline that starts waaaaay back on my head, I have to have bangs, but it's taken me a long time to get them right.   I resisted cutting my bangs thicker -- e.g. going farther back on my head -- for years, thinking that would make my hairline look even higher, but the opposite is actually true. In your case, I think it would fade your scalp showing through, simply because your bangs would be beginning at a place where your hair is naturally thicker and heavier.  A side-swept bang and/or a longer bang tends to look more natural with curly hair, if natural's what you're after. In my own experience, longer bangs seem more versatile; I can let them be sort of fringe-y, like you style yours, do them side-swept, wear them curly (when Jupiter aligns with Mars, lol). I wear my hair up a lot, in buns, twists, or my own interpretation of a Grecian style, and when my bangs are longer, I can play with them more when I wear my hair up."

curlyhair,3b0ayq,ohchameleons,5,Wed Jun 24 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"I will post my routine when I get home and actually remember what I do to my hair.   If you wanna know what I was doing to my hair back in 2009, it was probably wash with like suave shampoo or some other chemical ridden $1 crap, condition with the matching conditioner, twirl it in a towel and put like half of the can of tressemé mousse (but it's for curly hairrr) just to make sure it's extra crunchy. Dassit   ➰➰Routine:➰➰  Daily:  I usually try not to style my hair daily, but if I have to touch up some of the curls I spray them with a diy refresher spray made of aloe Vera juice, a little bit of honey (not too much or it'll get crunchy, like maybe 1/2 tsp per cup) conditioner and coconut oil  2x week:  I really like to try out new deep conditioners, so what I'm using in my hair fluctuates a lot when it comes to that, but I usually use SheaMoisture Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment at least once a week. I add tea tree oil, rosemary oil, and castor oil to it.   Lately I've been doing this deep conditioner that I really really like, it's just coconut creme (trader joes) , honey and castor oil. I would recommend using a processing cap and a towel, either around your neck or your head, cause once the coconut creme warms up it kind of melts. After each deep condition I do the LOC method.  Weekly:   Cowash with Decacurl No Poo cleansing conditioner  Condition with Carols Daughter Sacred Tiare   Conditioner  LOC with Carols Daughter Black Vanilla leave in, cold pressed coconut oil, SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie*. Then I plop until I can feel it's like 75% dry. Sometimes I'll scrunch in some more of the smoothie/butter on the ends if I feel they need it    either the curl enhancing smoothie or Carols Daughter Healthy Hair Butter when it's really humid. Those are holy grail; I've never loved any products more than I love them 🙏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼👌🏼10/10 would recommend.   Monthly:  Protein treatment w Hask keratin treatment & Helmanns lol.   Sometimes if I feel like I have too much product buildup or my scalp has been extra itchy I do an acv rinse, extra diluted, like 1/8 tsp: 1 gal. No joke don't use high concentrations of acv it's not good for your hair. Also if any of you do apple cider vinegar and baking soda stop it it's stripping your hair and will make it fall out.   Either that or I wash with diluted Castile soap. Same goes for that, don't wash with pure Castille soap."

curlyhair,3b2heq,RedheadAblaze,2,Thu Jun 25 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, it's because all of our dead hair (ew) gets caught in the curls and doesn't come out until it's washed. Straight hair apparently comes out in similar amounts but it just falls right off.  That said, I think we have some increase in shedding as well because combing curly hair is always a challenge.

Is it breakage, like your hair is damaged, or is it coming out at the root?   And finally (sorry for all the questions), what products are you using?

And then throughout the day it falls out without me touching it and gets on my clothes. If I play with my hair it comes out too. Since it's been the norm for me my entire life, I'm not sure if it's the products I'm using, but I use Aussie conditioner and Herbal Essence mouse. That's all!  I'm a redhead, if that matters at all.

curlyhair,3b2heq,YoureJustOkay,3,Sun Jun 28 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"So many of you guys seem to put product in/wash/condition with your head upside down and your results are great. How?????  I normally do all of my stuff standing straight up but wanted to try upside down to see if it would improve anything. While it gave me much more volume up top, everything looked and felt like a tangled mess and the next day it was knot city. If I flip my head back to normal after working with it upside down, it tries to stay as it was upside down, making the curls separate and creating massive tangles.    For reference, my routine involves co-washing every now and then (once every week or two), conditioning w/o rinsing out (sometimes s2c), put in product (usually gel) and then plop. My hair is between 3a and 3b and past my shoulders. I use a wide-tooth comb while in the shower to help de-tangle and style my hair."

curlyhair,3b2heq,Noraart,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:00:39 2015 UTC,I have to get my roots done every three weeks so I have a bit of experience!  After my hair color is done processing (and washed)  I have my stylist put in a leave in mask.  I rinse out the next day and do my routine as usual.  That day my curls may be a bit dryer but they bounce back pretty quickly.  One thing to note is that if you spend a lot of time outside in the sun your processed hair will get dry.  Try to keep a hat on or tie the ends up in a bun to avoid sun damage.  good luck!
curlyhair,3b2heq,hashtagphag,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"I bleach/color regularly. After I do, I need to ramp up my hair maintenance routine for a few weeks afterwards. Bleaching is extremely damaging - I found balayage to be worse than ombre, and experienced far more breakage. Anyway, your stylist will likely recommend you don't wash your hair for a few days afterwards, so your hair can get back to it's proper acid/ph/etc balance. Since you typically wash every 3 days, that should be just fine. After that, deep-condition and protein the hell out of your hair. Also, handle your curls with even more care than normal. They'll be fragile, and you'll probably get some additional breakage from the ends, so be as gentle as possible for the first few weeks. If need be, just gently S2C, apply leave-in, then throw your hair in a bun or braid until it's back to normal.    Your hair may feel soft and gummy the first time you get it wet; that's a sign that you need protein (pretty normal after bleaching). I use Kerastase for mine; it's a bit pricey, but has done wonders for repairing my hair. I put it in for 15 minutes, twice a week, for at least the first week - I'll do it the second week as well if my hair needs it. After that, I step down to once a week. If this is your first time bleaching, you can probably get away with once a week treatments for the first 2 weeks, then step down to once a month. Ask your stylist to be sure though, since he/she will be able to feel your hair afterwards.   I use deep conditioners daily for the first 1-2 weeks. I try to sleep with them in my hair and rinse them out in the morning. Then I step down to once a week. During this period, I'd recommend going stronger than the SheaMo 10-in-1. That one works fine for me after my hair gets back to normal, but early on, I need way more moisture replenishing. I just had my hair done this weekend, and I'm using SheaMo Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Mask. I feel like it's left my hair much softer and more manageable than the 10-in-1."

curlyhair,3b2heq,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:48:39 2015 UTC,"It might... everyone's hair reacts differently.

I started a CG routine over a month ago and my hair has honestly never looked worse. I know it takes some time to adjust, but if I can't get my hair under control soon I'm going to have some probz.  Current routine: Shampoo with L'Oreal EverPure Volumizing Shampoo (tried doing this every few days, but had to go back to almost daily because my hair was unbearable, frequent washings seem to be okay though, definite improvement) Tressemme Naturals Volumizing Conditioner, Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, wrap in a tshirt/towel for about 15-20 mins, Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls, scrunch and go.  My problems are no volume at the root - my hair is literally straight and flat at the top - I've been trying out various root boosting sprays and diffusing and it helps a TON with the volume, but everytime I do this my hair is so unbearably frizzy and my curls are just... crinkly blahs. I don't even know how to describe it, I've never seen a human with hair as wonky as mine gets when I do this. And, just that my hair doesn't hold its curl very well? I guess? My hair is more wavy than curly, which I'm okay with, but just as the day goes on it just starts to fall and look stringy.  Hair type is 2A, Fine, Thinning, Medium Porosity? Before switching to CG I blowdried and straightened my hair everyday M-F (let it rest on weekends as much as possible just so it would have a slight break) so I know there is a ton of damage from doing that even though for the most part hair is visibly healthy (very few split ends, not horribly dry, etc.)  Any info or suggestions or anything you can offer would be super appreciated.

curlyhair,3b2heq,hashtagphag,4,Sun Jun 28 17:28:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need to get some clips for your roots. Common clipping methods are with duckbill clips or roller jaw clamps. You'll need to check out videos for how to use them, it would get confusing trying to type it out =)   As far as your curls falling apart and looking stringy, I'd recommend a stronger hold curl cream/mousse/gel. Don't be afraid of it weighing down fine/thin hair, I've got the same and stronger hold is definitely needed. Since we lack strength and density in our strands, it's super easy for our curls to fall out, and we need to use artificial means to pull them back together. If you're a fan of the Miss Jessies line, I'd recommend stepping up to the Jelly Soft Curls (medium hold). If that doesn't do it, go even further into their Meringue or Pudding (firm hold).   Also, you may want to apply that prior to plopping. I put all my products in before plopping, and only touch my hair post-plop in order to clip. If I mess with my hair post-plop, while it's still wet, my curls fall apart."

curlyhair,3b2heq,TunicSongForKaren,3,Fri Jun 26 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"No, that is kept a secret by the manufacturers as part of their research secrets. Otherwise people would copy their recipes 1:1.  However, because the ingredients are exactly in order of their quantity in the product, it gives a pretty good indicator how much of an ingredient there is in a product. The first ingredient in the list is present in the highest quantity, the last ingredient in the list is present in the lowest quantity. Thus, if something is closer to the beginning of the ingredient list, it is present in a higher quantity.  A product where, say, ""silk protein"" is the 2nd ingredient out of 30 ingredients in the list, it contains a lot of protein, whereas if it would be, say, the 23rd ingredient in a list of 30 ingredients, it isn't present in that high of a quantity.

The goal of CG is to use shampoo as little as possible because it strips the natural oils from the hair. You're just into your CG journey, and  you'll figure out what works for you. If only your scalp feels dirty, I would try to use rinse-out conditioner on my ends (or cowash) then apply the shampoo to the scalp. If your hair has buildup, use shampoo everywhere.

I recently ran out of the Extreme hold gel (I swear one bottle lasted me nearly a year, but I did alternate and try other products) and I'm currently trying the mega hold that my roommate gave to me, but I'm not liking it. When I replace this LA Looks gel, I want it to be with a cruelty free gel.  Any suggestions?"
curlyhair,3b2heq,kamraym,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:58:16 2015 UTC,I started to go sulfate free about a year ago and had horrible results during the initial transition. I tried multiple different products and even switched salons. After finding /r/curlyhair I came to the realization that I have wavy hair and have been killing it via straightener every day. I have been CG for about a month now using Desert Essence Coconut shampoo and Shea Moisture conditioners. As a 2A/B wavy I am trying to give my curl as much oomph as possible and am wondering about the shampoo. The holy grail list has it labeled thusly:   Desert Essence Coconut shampoo(Mild coconut sulfate)   What does mild sulfate mean? Is this CG approved (as all the other sulfate containing shampoos are not)? Could this be hindering my curl oomph?
curlyhair,3b2heq,SheepWonderland,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:44:27 2015 UTC,I have SUPER THICK 2B/C curls and I'm enjoying them after a wash and applying some mousse and gel. But I'm afraid after a night of moving around my hair's just gonna be a mess when I get up in the morning. Is there anyone who has any advice for this? I had someone from my family recommend just putting gel in again in the morning. Will this work?
curlyhair,3b14dj,llamabooks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, those curls are lovely :3   I would suggest giving a bit more moister to the ends though! That's usually what guarantees me having a good hair day too. Maybe sealing the tips with coconut oil after washing?"

curlyhair,3ay90f,unlampi,30,Wed Jun 24 15:29:41 2015 UTC,they are curlformers!  You slide them on your wet hair and let them air dry (or blow dry). These are the extra long and extra wide but they come in different curl sizes/styles.  I'll post an after pic when I take them out in a few hours!

curlyhair,3ay90f,bewareofunicorn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:01:21 2015 UTC,I'm generally not a fan of my natural hair.  I usually use these or use curling iron to get it looser.  They make my hair smoother and more manageable - day 2/3 hair is basically wavy.  It should be noted that I work from home so I don't ever put effort into making my natural hair look nice and haven't in over a year.

Just in general I feel like my hair can hold most anything pretty well when I style it... except for being totally straightened in humid weather.

curlyhair,3b1fom,Frose91,3,Thu Jun 25 22:44:46 2015 UTC,My hair actually curls more the longer it gets. If I cut it I don't have a single wave or curl.  Do you use any products at all at the moment?
curlyhair,3b1fom,Frose91,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"My hair is weird. If it's too short it doesn't curl well and if it's too long my hair is weighed down. But shoulder length to shoulder blade length seems to be perfect for holding a curl.  I have currently been switching between products. I pretty consistently use a few different beach sprays because I find my hair is more manageable with salt water for some reason. Victoria's Secret, Lush, and John Frieda all have beach sprays I have used before (I am currently using the VS one). I also try different pomades, gels, hairsprays, etc.   The best product I used was a Garnier Frutis sculpting gel/pomade a while ago. I've been trying to find something similar that holds my natural curls. Their hair spray also seems to work best on my hair."
curlyhair,3b1fom,Frose91,2,Fri Jun 26 00:17:27 2015 UTC,"My hair is halfway down my back and still growing. It only curls from shoulder length. I used to have above shoulder length hair as a kid and I always wanted curls, only to find out fifteen years later I already had hem. Mom always cut my hair too short so there wasn't even a single wave in it.   Have you tried plopping with one of the pomades/gels in it? (It probably doesn't work as well with the beach sprays.) When the conditioner is rinsing out I run my hands trough my hair in such a way that it divides my hair in different smaller sections, those will become my curls. I make sure the conditioner is out, spray some coconut spray to protect it (made it myself, just water and coconut oil), then add any products I'd like. Then I cup my hair to squeeze the water out, which also helps create tighter curls. Then I plop for an hour or so. That usually does the trick. I have really thin hair, so if your hair is thicker maybe you need to experiment a bit with how long you plop, or depending on your curls and the length of your hair maybe pinning them down would be a better option.  Also make sure your products (especially shampoo if you use it) are sulfate/silicone free if you've not already done that. There's a great list in the sidebar. I personally use the yes to cucumbers line."

It's not as soft as I would like it to be and the ends feel like straw. I've tried a few things like serum just out of the shower, but I never noticed a difference so I stopped.

Here is information on which ingredients to look for to determine if your products have proteins in them. If they do, I would try using protein-free products for a while and see if your hair texture changes.   If your products do not contain protein, your hair might need more moisture. You could try weekly deep conditioning masques, leave-in conditioners, or a different rinse out conditioner. It's possible that the dry ends might be too damaged and need trimmed off."

curlyhair,3ay8p5,YogiKakumaraj,3,Wed Jun 24 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"I think your hair looks good! Maybe just experiment with your routine a little? Not sure what you're going for but my curls are on the looser side too and how loose or curly really depends on which products I use and how I dry my hair. A little curl creme and air drying = hair that is straight and sleek at the crown with loose spirals and waves at the ends. Plopping, gel, and diffuse drying all give me tighter curls that start at my scalp and more volume especially up top. Clipping at the scalp enhances this effect. I almost always cowash and squish to condish- my hair really seems to need that extra moisture to curl instead of frizz. You also might want to avoid the hairspray- I feel like it doesn't do much for curly hair besides dry it out.   Edited to make clearer: if you are having crazy flyaway hair at your scalp that you are controlling in the short term with hairspray and a flat iron it's likely that these methods are actually drying out and damaging your hair and making the problem worse in the long run. Moisture is really the thing that makes curly hair behave/take shape so you'd likely have more success in shaping these areas of your hair (after it recovers a bit) with leave in conditioner, gel or curl creme, and a strict no-touchy policy after styling."

I've tried them separately and together; the better result is with just gel, but neither's that great. When I put product in it, I always diffuse it.  I think my ends are okay. I had a trim about three months ago, and I read something online about curlies maybe only needing a trim every six months or so? They do feel a little crispy compared to the rest of my hair though.  Today I tried putting a little conditioner in and using it like a leave-in, then finger-combing it back from my face and clipping it up at the scalp with bobby pins to air-dry. Those are the best results I've seen in ages.   I wish I could get gel or oils to work! Thank you for your help :)  Edit: Sorry for all the edits! It took me a while to work out texture/porosity/density. I'd say it's 2C, medium-porosity and high-density. It's got fine strands and can't handle thick oils at all, it just clumps like crazy. Thanks lovelies :)"

curlyhair,3az7ph,skoshii,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not sure! Would a clarifying shampoo need to have sulphates in it, or would the Naked product be okay?"
curlyhair,3az7ph,nati691810,2,Wed Jun 24 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"A clarifying shampoo is used only once in awhile to remove product buildup that cannot be removed from a low-shampoo or co-wash routine. This buildup causes dullness, frizziness, a coating on the hair, loss of shape/volume, etc.   I know people have had really good success with the KCCC clarifying shampoo which is sulfate free but still removes all of the junk that might be impairing your curl structure (http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlproducts/view/3593/Kinky-Curly-Come-Clean-Moisturizing-Shampoo).  For the most part, your products look like they aren't doing much damage. I would definitely look into replacing the tresemme conditioner...it's got some unpleasant ingredients that your hair may not agree with like Brassica family oils, benzyl/ethyl/isopropyl alcohol.   My hair texture and curl structure are similar to yours. I've had a lot of luck with the SheaMoisture products and use Aussie Moisture conditioner for my co-wash. My hair needed a lot more cream/leave-in conditioner type product than I initially thought, and plopping has helped a lot too.   My routine has turned into co-wash with Aussie Moisture, condition with SheaMoisture conditioner, squish in SheaMoisture curl milk, light application of SheaMoisture honey manuka restorative oil, then plop for 15 minutes, finger comb in SheaMoisture gel souffle, then clip and diffuse. It's a pain, but my hair has been appreciating it."

After a couple months I realized my scalp had become incredibly dry and that's when I knew it was time to try Co-Washing again. Now I only shampoo once a month to clarify.

curlyhair,3azs3k,brinana_629,3,Wed Jun 24 23:02:27 2015 UTC,"Based on your question, I'm assuming the conditioner contains silicones and the new shampoo is sulfate-free. If so, then it will depend on the types of silicones.  From what I understand (I'm a beginner at this curly stuff), there are different types of silicones--water soluble, non-water soluble, etc. Using the sidebar links on silicones, I would look to see what kinds your conditioner contains. If they are all water soluble, then it should be fine to use. If they are not water soluble then they will need some sulfates to be removed so they do not cause buildup.  If I'm wrong I hope someone will correct me so that you are informed properly, but this is my understanding from what I've read over the past couple months."

curlyhair,3awmjo,natalieoctopus,3,Wed Jun 24 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"This is my daughters hair. I'm currently using mixed chicks for kids products.  It's beautiful, and I'm trying to treat it right.  She's 3, and really didn't grow much hair until she was 2, so I've had about a year of trying to figure this out. (My hair is only a touch wavy, nothing like this.) My problem is every morning she wakes up and the hair on the back of her head is incredibly dried out, like straw, and has started to knot. I'd like to know how to prevent this, or if there is a quicker way of fixing it than wetting it and combing through each morning. Now what I usually do is use water and a wide tooth comb and if there's a problem some detangler, and add some leave in conditioner. Too much leave in conditioner makes her hair look darker, and I'd rather not put so much product in that it changes her hair color.   So, do I stick with what I'm doing or change it up? What about when she grows and is in school and her hair is longer and takes longer to dry? Wet hair every school morning? It gets freezing cold in winter here, I wouldn't want to send her out with hair that could freeze.   Eta: sorry, I can't figure out posting a thread from alien blue."

curlyhair,3auz2s,toastshrine,6,Tue Jun 23 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Unless you're going for a large afro-type look, avoid brushing or combing dry hair. If you find you're prone to tangles, use a wide tooth comb in the shower.  The tighter the curl, the more you need to condition! Deep conditioning treatments are vital to curl health.  Every few weeks, dampen your hair, slather it in deep conditioner, then cover with a plastic cap and a warm towel. Steam that conditioner in there for up to 45 minutes then rinse! Don't be afraid to switch up your products depending on your hair's needs.  During the winter and super humid spring months, I switch to an Anti-humectant gel.  When the humidity isn't too terrible, I like the slight added ""oomph"" I get from a gel with humectants."

curlyhair,3awps3,Liakada,2,Wed Jun 24 02:53:22 2015 UTC,"I have pretty fine and thin hair. I let my hairstylist have her way with my hair, and she cut it in a way to make it look thicker. Basically, she left it overall one length (really with small layering), but still with layers throughout the thickness of the hair. They layers aren't stacked. I think the technique she used is slicing described here.   It's more difficult to style, but it looks super thick and my ends don't look sparse.   I actually would prefer the more stacked layers (and will ask for that next time) since it's easier for me to style and it's curlier."
curlyhair,3awps3,Curly_Alice,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:26:42 2015 UTC,Are you sure you mean slicing? The way this article describes it is that slicing tapers he ends and removes bulk. That's the opposite of what I need. In the article it says that graduated layers are best for thin wavy hair to create volume.
curlyhair,3awps3,Curly_Alice,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"The description matches up. Basically, my stylist cut my layers out by  cutting the long length to match the shortest layers (in the back, I also have face-framing layers) so that it was very close to one length. Then, she took sections throughout the hair (where it would clump) and twisted the hair and cut small amounts while moving down the length.  Basically, this lightened the weight throughout the thickness of my hair and allows waves to form in the top, middle, and underneath section without having long graduated layers. She would only cut a very small amount of hair as she moved down the length, so my hair didn't look thinner at the ends.  Edit: She did add a little bit of layering at the ends. I went from long layers (6+ inches from shortest to longest) to short (mostly less than 2-3 inches from shortest to longest) but some of the sliced layers show up in clumps.   My hair type used to be ""poufy"" which may be why this works well for me. The problem with the cut is that it's not typically layered, and it took me a long time to figure out how to style it to make it look good. My hair is also at bra band length and she chose this cut to have me grow my hair longer since it was very thin/stringy at the ends.  I guess I wouldn't ask this unless you have a trusted stylist that knows your hair already, but it could be something to discuss."

curlyhair,3awyx0,NurseMiserable,3,Wed Jun 24 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"Bleaching doesn't just do some damage. It catastrophically ruins your hair, from the follicle, down the entire shaft. Bleach eats away at most of the fatty acids in your hair drastically weakening it and loosening if not compeletly ruining curl pattern. Bleach damage is obviously cumulative, so really nothing but letting it grow out, leaving heat off of it and not bleaching it again will help. Using products with ceramides (similar to the fatty acids you drained with bleaching) will temporarily help a little."

curlyhair,3au2vr,cuccomino,6,Tue Jun 23 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"It may have something to do with the fact that your conditioner has silicones in it. Once you start shampooing more infrequently, conditioner-washing alone won't strip that gunk out of your hair. This leads to heavy and frizzy hair with less definition.  If you want to wean yourself off shampoo, make sure you aren't using any silicones. Also, don't sleep with your hair wet or damp. I saw you mention it in another comment, but it will lead to  nothing but more frizz and a lot of breakage. Try plopping for only 10 minutes instead of a half hour, and make sure the fabric is smooth so it doesn't disturb the hair cuticle.   When using a diffuser, don't turn your hair upside down or ""flip"" at all. Find your natural part, tip your head to the side, and direct the diffuser at your head at a perpendicular angle for four minutes on each side. Then, come at the curls from below for 5 seconds at a time. This will also reduce frizz while giving you some volume."

curlyhair,3au2vr,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 23 18:43:41 2015 UTC,That's entirely possible! Just be conscious of how flipping can cause your clumps to split and be gentle with the movement!

For soft definition that doesn't weigh down your hair, try making flax gel.  1/4 cup flax seeds boiled for half an hour with 4 cups water.  Strain the seeds and store in fridge.  Lasts a few weeks.  It will smell off (a bit like sour milk) when it has gone bad.  Use a ton of it on wet hair, let hair dry completely, then scrunch out any crunchiness."

Although I just looked up that collection under Tresemme and it says that it is a ""lower sulfate"" alternative...do you think that it having sulfates makes any difference? About the flax gel--does that keep your curls in for a few days? I definitely notice my curls fading and I don't want that to happen! And you don't see major grease with that, do you?"
curlyhair,3av8x5,APsychedelicMermaid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"I only use Tresemme Naturals for conditioner, so I'm not sure about sulfates in the shampoo.  For shampoo I use Andalou Naturals, but it is not cheap.  As for the flax gel, it just depends on your hair.  My hair keeps its curl overnight and doesn't get greasy, but I couldn't say for sure that yours will be the same since everyone is different.  Unfortunately there's really no getting around the trial and error thing.  Best of luck to ya.  PS.  From your picture, I don't think your hair looks greasy, btw.  It's very pretty.  How long have you been CG?  It took my hair a few months to adjust to no sulfates.  In the interim, it had a tendency to get greasy, but that goes away once the hair adjusts.  If you don't feel that it's just an adjustment phase, a lower sulfate shampoo (like tresemme) might work for you.  Just watch for dryness and frizziness if you go that route.  If that happens, then even a small amt of sulfates is too much for your hair.  Its tough to find the right balance, but if you stay vigilant you'll find a routine that works, and that hopefully won't break the bank.  :-)"

I've only been CG for 2 or 3 weeks, but I've always had the greasiness and it's not necessarily worse now but I've never been able to make it go away.

curlyhair,3av8x5,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Thu Jun 25 00:05:40 2015 UTC,You're welcome!  Hope you find something that works.  You may find that CG will fix the grease problem once your hair realizes its not being stripped and dried out by sulfates anymore.  Give it a few more weeks.  ;-)
curlyhair,3av8x5,sassycatmeow,2,Thu Jun 25 02:50:38 2015 UTC,"I love the Shea Moisture conditioners.   When I first started taking care of my hair, they did leave my hair greasy if I applied too much (as a leave-in). Now, they don't. I'm not sure if it's due to the technique of applying them, or due to my hair becoming healthier.  I do apply all products to dripping wet hair, which I know helps with it distributing and not becoming greasy.   Like /u/APsychedelicMermaid suggested, Tresemme Naturals is cheap and CG, and it might be better to start with to see how your hair reacts to CG conditioners. It can give you an idea of whether you need something more moisturizing before trying out the heavier conditioners. Suave Naturals is also CG and cheap, but might be better as a cowash instead of a moisturizing conditioner."

curlyhair,3av8x5,ratherbesleeping,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"I have similar hair texture to you and personally, I use a mix of inexpensive and expensive products. I only wash every 3-7 days, so most of my stuff lasts a long time. I feel like shampoos and conditioners are easier to skimp on and buy inexpensive options that way I can save the splurging for some nice stylers.   The shampoo you're using is probably fine for clarifying every once in a while. I only clarify once a month. However, definitely put down the Wen products, they're full of silicones. There are a lot of good and inexpensive products at target and sally's that are CG aprroved. Kinky Curly Knot Today is an amazing leave in, only $11.99, and lasts forever!!! A little bit goes a long way, I highly recommend it. Everyone loves Shea Moisture, but the only SM products I've tried and really liked are the Masques. Everything else has been too heavy and the scents are so strong and overwhelming! If you're going to buy something for Devacurl, I recommend the Ultra Defining Gel. Great smell and great hold."

I'm using Tresemme Perfectly Undone right now, but I mix protein into it because my hair loves it. It's another cheap CG conditioner option. If you see anything on a list of ingredients ending in ""xane"" or ""cone"", google it, it's probably a silicone. Some of the more common silicones used in hair products are dimethicone, cyclomethicone, and amodimethicone, but there are a ton of different ones.   Just so you know, ""leave in"" usually refers to a conditioner or conditioning cream you put on your hair before your gel to soften your hair and maintain moisture. The Kinky Curly leave-in I have will probably last me multiple years at the rate I use it, ha. I know Kinky Curly makes a CG shampoo that people like too. Good luck!"

I've never really put more than one product in my hair afterwards, usually I would just put in a cream or conditioner and not put in any sort of gel after.

Yes! Gel will not ruin you hair, it's actually seals in the moisture. The key is to scrunch the crunch out of your hair after it's completely dry. This will remove the hard gel cast and reveal soft locks! Don't be afraid to play with different products and techniques.

Humectants are substances that promote moisture retention- but in humid conditions, it can also promote frizz(since it's allowing that moisture constantly into the hair).  Would you be opposed to adding a product? I would keep your leave-in conditioner, but add an anti-humectant gel on top to keep all of that moisture in.  Aussie Instant Freeze gel or Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel are both antihumectants, CG friendly(no sulfates or silicones) and cheap. :)"
curlyhair,3atv06,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Tue Jun 23 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"I just put in John Master's Hair Pomade, which contajns no drying alcohols, no silicones (and obviously no sulfates, I have to find the first hair styling product with a detergent ingredient in it still), but it does contain beeswax as second ingredient which is supposedly a very good anti-humectant.  Seems to work quite well know a few minutes after applying. Fingers crossed!"

curlyhair,3as4ze,AGhostLP,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:55:02 2015 UTC,"When I had a Devacurl cut, I was not put under a dryer. My stylist used a handheld blow dryer with diffuser. My hair is fine and at the time it was just past my shoulders.  She also used the Devacurl conditioner and gel. I washed my hair with a different shampoo after the second day because the smell from the Devacurl products did not go away and I'm not a fan of their scent.  Try washing, conditioning and styling your hair again. If it still seems frizzy, contact the salon and speak with the manager about your hair and what all happened when you were there for a Devacut. See what they say.  Also look up the Devacurl hair products that the stylist used. Is it possible your hair products have less protein in them and Deva's has more? Could your products have some silicone in them that you didn't realize was there? (I had that happen with a hair mask. I was so annoyed that I hadn't noticed it when I purchased it.)"

I'm too lazy to diffuse myself, so I usually shower and plop for a little while at night and then let my hair dry overnight with it up on the pillow.  I was told I had three weeks to go back if I didn't like how it looked. I'll try giving them a call up to see what they say. I was planning on going back to see if they could ""fix"" in the next week if I can manage it. :(     Would that long under the dryer have damaged my hair?   And the smell. Ohgawd, it was awful. I can still smell it and it's been nearly three days."
curlyhair,3as4ze,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think sitting under the dryer once would cause that much damage. Did they have it cranked? Was it super hot?

Those who are OK with 'cones and don't mind washing them out with sulfates occasionally are fine.   Anyway, yeah, it may or may not cause build-up for you, depends on your hair.

curlyhair,3alwb6,tthershey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:18:03 2015 UTC,It's good especially if you have build up from other silicone products you use.. What you are making is a detox fro the hair.. And make sure you really hydrate after vinegar with your conditioner..
curlyhair,3alwb6,Wherecurlsbegin,3,Tue Jun 23 01:26:41 2015 UTC,Diffusing makes my hair frizzy and air drying takes too long. How can I sped up drying time without disturbing my curls?
curlyhair,3alwb6,byebyebitchez,7,Sun Jun 21 23:43:07 2015 UTC,Well the way you diffuse is why you are frizzy.. Blow the air down and don't touch the hair until the hair and gel create a hard cast.. Then you can apply head directly to curl.. If you start immediately with hot hair directly on the hair and continue to scrunch you will open the curl cluster.. The hair grows down do diffuse down.. That should help

When done combing you put comb down and use hands to form wave or curl clumps.. Do not not rinse the conditioner out of the hair.. That's everyone's mistake.. That hydrated the hair..

curlyhair,3aniqs,hashtagphag,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:34:58 2015 UTC,"Looking good, much improved! Looks like your ends are really dry though (likely from the bleaching), mine do that same splitting effect. If you're not doing so already, get started on protein treatments (to replenish what the bleach has stripped) and deep conditioning treatments. To give some context, I bleach/color/dye my hair roughly every 3 months and I do both treatments once a week. You didn't mention if you're using a leave-in conditioner, but I would absolutely recommend that... curlies have dry hair already, and we're just adding to it with the chemical processing. MOAR CONDISH PLZ!  I'd say you're a 2B/C right now, but will totally jump up as your hair improves. You're already going beyond S-curls and into spirals in the back. How else is your hair classified? Are you thin/medium/thick? Are you fine/medium/coarse? And do you know what your porosity is?    For volume, 2 things:    Check the ingredients on those Cantu products. Some of them contain non-water-soluble silicones, which will eventually build up and weigh down your hair (unless washed out with sulfates).  Look into clipping at the roots. The most common methods are using duckbill clips or roller jaw clamps. You put them in after you release the plop, and take them out once your hair is fully dry (pre-scrunch)."
curlyhair,3aniqs,hashtagphag,3,Sun Jun 21 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for the reply!  I have some questions though, such as what should I be looking for in regards to protein treatments? I've heard that used around the subreddit a few times but I don't know if it's an actual product or more of like a at home treatment like with egg whites or something.  I think I have somewhat medium to low porosity as my hair takes absolutely FOREVER to get saturated with water in the shower and often I have to put a tiny amount of shampoo, get it wet, put some more in, and repeat these steps until my hair is clean. That may be the damage though. I would say my hair is medium and somewhat  fine, although with the shorter length it feels much thicker.  I picked these products specifically because they say ""No sulfates or silicones!"" In about 3 different places on the labeling and with my somewhat untrained eye I couldn't find any in the ingredients list.  And I absolutely know what you mean about the splitting at the bottom. I work at a salon as a receptionist and I've had about 3 stylists offer to cut off some of that damaged length. I haven't used any leave in condish, as I'm worried it will weigh me down and possibly make my hair look greasy. I don't squish out all of my condish though so I thought that the small amount I leave in would do fine.  I'm excited to see how my curls will evolve once they're properly hydrated and not so damaged anymore! Although I do have like one more bleach session coming up to fix those gnarly roots and get the yellow tones out. How should I pamper it after the bleaching?"
curlyhair,3aniqs,hashtagphag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"For protein treatments, it can be either! I'm far too lazy to create my own at-home treatments, so I buy them retail. If you want to go that route, I highly recommend Kerastase. I know there are plenty of curlies in this sub who can recommend at-home concoctions though.    For porosity, have you done the strand test? I found that to be the most reliable... descriptions sometimes can be misleading, especially since they vary a bit amongst sites. For example, I'm definitely lo-por - I floated for half an hour, haha, products don't absorb well, and chemical processing takes forever to do anything on my hair. However, my hair loves-loves-loves protein and it takes absolutely nothing to get wet.   I have fine hair too... I squish out about 95% during S2C, and then rely on my products for the rest. I focus on rinsing off my scalp 100% though, that's a danger zone of build-up and grease. I just got 2 new leave-ins that I really like, only day 1 trying each, but you might like them: Kinky Curly Knot Today and Mop Top. Both are nice and lightweight, and my hair has been soft and shiny.     After bleaching, definitely do protein and DC. What my stylist recommends is using a protein spray of some sort, something light but can stay on your hair all day, and ramping up the DC. I don't have a protein spray, so I use my Kerastase twice during the week afterwards, and sleep with my DC in every night (I shower in the mornings).    Also, ask your stylist about Olaplex. It's a much gentler way of bleaching, and the (super top secret) ingredients are formulated to help repair the bonds of your hair both during and after the bleaching. My stylist and I experimented with so many different methods and volumes, but once she found that, it became our Holy Grail. Far less breakage and shedding, and my hair actually feels stronger now than it ever did."

curlyhair,3ao71h,GuiltyBunny,2,Mon Jun 22 03:16:55 2015 UTC,"This product works wonders. I'm not 100% sure it's CG, but you'll need to use a shampoo afterwards regardless. I used it after bleaching my hair and was SHOCKED by how much life it put back into it. My curls sprang right back! It is INCREDIBLE, once you get over the nasty smell. You can also buy this in bulk sized bottles if you decide you like it and use it, oh, once a month or so. It's on my shopping list!  Deep conditioning with coconut oil before any shampoo is also really helpful. Or even just before a co-wash! Bleaching my hair FORCED me to learn how to shock some life back into it. You can't undo damage completely, but moisturizing the heck out of your hair can come close."

curlyhair,3ao71h,curlyprince,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:24:27 2015 UTC,"After coloring, your hair is stripped of its natural protein, as well as very very dry. I'd recommend protein treatments at least twice this current week, and deep conditioning as often as you can tolerate it. I typically sleep with DC in my hair (wash it out in the morning) for a week after I color/bleach.     Also, check to see if your hairdresser used silicones during your styling. They're pretty common, and will need to be washed out with a sulfate shampoo. Which adds to the drying, but at least the 'cones are gone so you can focus more on moisture replenishing afterwards."
curlyhair,3ao6tb,No_Imagination12345,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:14:40 2015 UTC,"It looks like your shampoo has sulphates in it, which will be stripping a lot of your moisture out your hair. The conditioner should be fine. The are limited sulphate/free options in the UK, but the Naked range (which is in boots) does some.   Regarding your dislike of crunchy hair, can you not stand it at all? I love using gel because it gives me the best hold. However, for it to be effective, it needs to totally dry before you touch it. That means it needs to get crunchy (also known as the gel cast). Once it's gone crunchy, you can scrunch your hair to remove the crunch, leaving lovely, soft curls! Alternatively, curl creams might be the answer. Boots do a great gel and curl cream in their essentials line. The cream is pink and it's in the general hair products, and the gel is purple and is in the men's area. They're both pretty cheap, so might be worth a try?"
curlyhair,3ao6tb,SimoneDeBroccolah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'll have a look into the Naked range and hopefully that will help.  I'm just not a fan of the texture and look, I guess I just want a more natural look to my hair. I've tried several times before but have  never been able to remove the crunch by scrunching. I'll definitely give the gel a try though as well as the curl creme and see if that helps. Also, is curl creme applied the same way as you said to apply the gel? Thanks for your help!"
curlyhair,3ao6tb,SimoneDeBroccolah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"The way I apply leave-in products is; - make sure your hair is still quite wet & bend right over, so your hair is hanging down - grab a decent glob of leave-in (exactly how much you'll need is trial and error)  - spread it across your fingers - cup your hair at the tip, bring it to your scalp and scrunch (it should sounds squelchy) -when you feel like you've distributed it around your whole head by squelching, either leave it to air dry, or plop with a t-shirt or microfibre towel (not a normal one - these are too rough and will cause frizz).  Then I just let it air dry. If I've used gel, I'll need to crunch the cast off. My hair takes a long time to dry naturally. If I'm driving, I'll blast my hair with the radiator, as the heat ends up very diffuse and doesn't whip my hair up into a frizz ball!"
curlyhair,3anfts,kellyfish22,2,Sun Jun 21 23:00:08 2015 UTC,"Shea Moisture makes 2 lines for hair growth/health: Raw Shea Butter and Jamaican Black Castor Oil.      ""Thinning lately"" does have me a bit concerned though. Abnormal hair loss is... well, abnormal. Are you under a lot of stress? Is your hair reacting poorly to an ingredient in one of your products? Are you vitamin-deficient? Are you noticing extra shedding (from the roots) or breakage (at the ends) when you shower?      BTW, not sure if you're 100% CG-method, but the Aveeno Shampoo you're using has a non-water-soluble silicone in it. You'll need sulfates to wash it out. If you're not ready to go no-poo, you could try swapping that out for a non-sulfate/non-silicone shampoo in the meantime. My hair has definitely improved since I started doing that, and I just alternate with co-washing so I ease into the transition."
curlyhair,3anfts,hashtagphag,2,Sun Jun 21 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"Sort of, I mean it's thinned a lot through the last couple years. I use box dye, so that may be it.

curlyhair,3anfts,hashtagphag,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:53:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, OK. My hair has been thinning as I've gotten older... damn genetics, happens to all the women in my family =(   But yeah, breakage from the ends means that your hair is damaged, likely from the processing... the box dye could definitely be the culprit, I used them for years before finally breaking down and going to a stylist. It's been several years now that I've been seeing her, but as soon as I went CG, I had TONS of breakage. I think all those 'cones were just barely holding the poor strands together =\     Protein treatments can help repair the hair that remains - just be sure to follow the directions to a tee, as too much protein causes brittleness (and more breaking). And definitely look into deep conditioning as well, it's recommended that you follow up protein with DC afterwards.   Since you color your hair, you may want to try alternating shampooing and cowashing, especially if you're timid about jumping into no-poo completely. That way you can at least get more moisture back into your hair in the meantime. For cowash, most of us use an inexpensive and/or watery conditioner - you can use your existing Tresemme actually, that's a popular one around here. Just be sure to really scrub it into your scalp so you break up any oils and build-up.    For CG-shampoos, where are you located? There's different product availabilities in each country."

Once you do it, you're in it for the long run or you have to just cut it all off. Definitely research that one =)   I think your protein treatments once a week are good, that's how often I do them as well. Just double-check that you're not leaving them in for too long.    Oh, USA?

You only use it 3-4 days, and once you get the problem under control, you use it even less than that. It does contain sulfates, but it's like the last ingredient on the list.  Some tips I have, though, for washing with dandruff shampoos. First, coat your length with conditioner, or even coconut oil, so when you rinse, your curls are protected. Lather the shampoo ONLY on your scalp. I have patchy dandruff, so I'll massage the Nizoral in the worst spots & leave it on for a few minutes. Then I'll clean my entire scalp with a no-sulfate cleanser (usually something Shea Moisture), then I rinse everything out. Finally, I go through with my rinse-out conditioner, being careful not to rub any into my scalp. (Unfortunately, I've found that co-washing exacerbates my dandruff)."

If that's your problem, one way I've combated this is scrunching my wet hair sans product (having rinsed my conditioner 90% out) either after a cleansing or a co-wash, then plopping for 10-15 minutes.

I'll bet the snarl has to do with all the movement you're doing during S2C and product application.   Instead of doing it upside down, you might try sectioning off your hair and leaning side-to-side to apply. That's what I do, to ensure more regular distribution and to finger detangle while I'm at it. After I'm finished applying product, I twist those sections (like I'm making dreadlocks) and then plop. I find that helps my curls clump together better, rather than splitting apart and frizzing in the plop."

This might make it all look more balanced. Any kind of chemical relaxing will just damage your hair, but it's possible that if you use sulfate shampoo that the curl will ""back down"" into waves? I know my curls were basically just waves back when I used normal shampoo."

curlyhair,3afiyb,bartel1460,5,Fri Jun 19 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"I got to be honest: your curl definition and volume is great, as is the absense of frizz. However, and that is mainly due to the fluorescent lighting, I can see that there is a lot of buildup on your hair. Pretty much all conditoners contain cationic surfactants (such as for example ceteimonium chloride), and due to the heads of these molecules being positively charged, they bind extremely tight to hair (which is negatively charged).  Oddly enough, you don't need a shampoo to rinse out that buildup. In fact, sulfate shampoos contain anionic surfactants (such as SLS and SLES, our curlies' mortal enemies) that tend to make cationic surfactants stick even tigher to our hair.  Thus, I can recommend two things: rinse with Apple Cider Vinegar to remove both surfactant buildup and the mineral buildup caused by hard water, and use a cleansing conditioner with nonionic surfactants every once in a while. (Jessicurl, SheaMoisture and DevaCurl all make cleansing conditioners that are good, and -even though I haven't personally tried it- As I Am also makes it, and I am sure there are loads more brands).  Also, going a week between co-washes is too long. You need to remove sebum every once in a while, nopoo or not. Some people manage with just hot water rinsing and abrasion (=using the mechanical force of your fingers to remove dirt and oil), but honestly I think those people just don't realize how greasy their hair gets.  To sum it up, your frizz-control, volume, shape, definition and shine are pretty good, but I can spot the film caused by buildup quite easily."

When your hair is freshly dried, you'll be able to clearly see the ""good"" curls (ends that are about the same length, and generally pretty together) versus the ""bad"" curls (thin, tapered, frizzy, uneven). The bad curls will stand out pretty well. Isolate them, then find the very last bend on that curl, and snip it right in the middle of the C shape. Just a little bit at a time. Soon you will notice the ""bad"" curls are few and far between! If you're nervous, just do one or two curls in a week. Make sure you have a good mirror with good lighting.

curlyhair,3ag2yb,brownbee,3,Wed Jun 24 15:31:07 2015 UTC,"I think I might win this one. I went to a certified Devacurl stylist and it was around $140. I got it done about 9 months ago and I think I might get it trimmed in a couple months as a birthday present to myself...it's easily the most expensive present I've ever gotten for myself. I don't ever use heat tools other than a blow dryer with a diffuser a couple times a week. My hair still looks great, I don't see any damage to it. I would just go back to get my layers touched up. The only reason I would invest in it again is because it grows out nicely. Out of the 6 haircuts I've had in my life it was probably the best. Stylists never believe me when I tell them I have curly hair so the cuts usually come out pretty awful."
curlyhair,3ag2yb,Musicly2343,2,Sat Jun 20 08:28:15 2015 UTC,How ambiguously curly can your hair look? Or is it more wavy? Mines wavy but used to just get treated like straight hair by hairdressers.
curlyhair,3ag2yb,brownbee,3,Sat Jun 20 09:31:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the wall of text, I'm on mobile. TL;DR at the bottom.   It's fine and mostly 3A with a little 3B thrown in. I've only been trying to care for it and embrace the curl for the last year, before that I would flat iron it, which would damage it extremely quickly. Before my appointment with a stylist I'd usually wash it then brush it while it was wet, wrap it in a towel and eventually pull it back in a tight ponytail. By this point my hair would just look vaguely wavy since I had abused it so much, not to mention it would be damaged from constantly flat ironing it. But I always had little curly/frizzy bits framing my face and at the nape of my neck. I'd tell the stylist what I wanted and warn them that my hair was ""kind of"" curly. But I guess they wouldn't believe me because they probably thought of the more extreme 3C type curls. Without fail they would wash my hair, start cutting and as they saw it start drying in ringlets say ""oh, your hair's curly!""  I know now that I should have gone in with my hair in its natural state, but I figured since I was asking for a style I could flat iron every day it didn't matter.  I can't say I blame them for not believing me because I've spent most of my life thinking that there were 3 types of hair; straight, frizzy waves, and tight corkscrew curls. It wasn't til the last couple years that I've realized that curls come in more than one size and I think some stylists are still figuring that out.   TL;DR it was damaged and I'd pull it back in a tight ponytail while it dried."
curlyhair,3ag2yb,imjustafangirl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:36:47 2015 UTC,I'm going to a salon that's like 60-80$ for curly cuts tomorrow. Eep. We'll see how that goes. Before I used to go 40-50ish at a stylist my mom also goes to (though my mom's hair is straight.)  I'd say don't do any kind of heat styling if you can avoid it. It's the root cause of so many kinds of hair damage.

curlyhair,3ag2yb,all_u_need_is_cheese,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"The place I usually go charges $80 for a Deva cut with the owner, and $60 for a Deva cut from one of the stylists. I've seen the owner thus far, she's really good, and I only go once or twice a year which works out because my hair grows pretty slow, the cuts grow out great, and I trim it myself in between if I feel it needs it. After stopping heat styling I don't need to trim it at all to keep it healthy. My last cut was in December, I haven't trimmed it myself since, and I have no sign of split ends yet.  Plus where I live haircuts are insanely expensive, so it's easy to convince myself that I'm technically saving money by getting an $80 Deva cut on trips to visit my parents in the USA. :) I live in Oslo, Norway, and I've never seen anything under $100 for a women's cut, and $150 is maybe average. Plus I do NOT trust any salon I've seen here with curly hair anyway, these Nordic girls mostly have straight hair, the only curly salons I've seen tend to be aimed at african hair so I don't know if they'd know what to do with my fine curls."

I've had some hair loss problems that aren't noticeable yet but the growing process is just so frustrating! I want to grow my hair out as long as I can before my PhD graduation in about two years but at the same time... I want a curly mohawk or to completely buzz my head!"
curlyhair,3agur6,IronTitan12345,2,Sat Jun 20 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Have you checked out the sidebar? It's got loads of useful information that might help. The first thing I would say it that you probably shouldn't comb your hair when it's dry. I think that breaks up the curl pattern, and can lead to quite a lot of breakage, which will increase your frizz. I only finger-comb my hair when it's got loads of conditioner in it.  It would be useful to know what products you're using as well"
curlyhair,3agur6,SimoneDeBroccolah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:27:42 2015 UTC,"I use Dove Men +Care shampoo, and Garnier Fructis Pure Clean conditioner, but I haven't really experimented with various products (this is the first time I actually grow out my hair curly)"
curlyhair,3agur6,SimoneDeBroccolah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:50:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, if you're new to all of it, then I definitely recommend having a read though the sidebar, it's full of information!   As a basic overview, the idea of the Curly Girl (often referred to on here as CG) method is that we curlies (male or female) shouldn't be using sulphates in our shampoos, because they strip the moisture/oils from your hair. Because we shouldn't be using sulphates, it's generally a good idea to stay away from silicones in your conditioners, because they cause build up on your hair/scalp, which can't be cleared without a harsh, sulphate shampoo.  Your conditioner looks fine, it hasn't got any silicones in it, but your shampoo looks to have sulphates in it, so I'd think about changing that. The products you can use will depend on which country you live in, but there's loads of advice about that on here.  So if you decide to go CG, you have two options; wash with sulphate-free shampoo and follow with a silicone-free conditioner, or only use the conditioner to both cleanse and moisturise. The second is referred to co-washing, and I'd definitely direct you to the sidebar/search function, as I don't do that.   Other things to consider are leave-in products, such as leave-in conditioner, curl creams or gels. These help to reduce your frizz and define your curls.   That's a basic overview, hopefully I haven't overwhelmed you! There's a lot of information to process, but following a curly girl routine has really helped my curls to become healthier and look so much better."
curlyhair,3agur6,SimoneDeBroccolah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot to process! I'm just starting to realize the amount of care is required for long hair. My problem is that the only shampoos I can find seem to be very fruity and targeted towards women, and all shampoos for men are 2-in-1 body wash/shampoo combos. Are there any good places to find shampoos without sulphates for men?"

curlyhair,3agur6,Wherecurlsbegin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"If you want a good sulfate free shampoo try Shea Moisture. You can find it at CVS and, I believe, Wal Mart and the prices are fairly reasonable. You should also get some of their conditioner as well because it's silicone free.   My problem is that the only shampoos I can find seem to be very fruity and targeted towards women   Don't worry about this. Really the only difference between shampoos targeted towards men and women are the fragrances. For the most part they all use the same ingredients at pretty much the same ratios. People generally don't notice the fragrance anyway, nor do they care if you smell like fruit."

curlyhair,3ab1ln,cycguy,3,Thu Jun 18 18:48:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It was really hard for me to find a picture of someone who had curly hair like mine, I couldn't at all, but I just went for it! Very happy with it! Feels refreshing, I would say go for it! You don't see a lot of people with curly hair with it, get lots of compliments :D   I definitely don't mind responding to your question! I actually use OGX Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo and Conditioner(Pic for reference http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod11731437)  Not only does it smell great, it hydrates your hair and makes it feel great! When I wash my hair I do it every other day, and let the shampoo and conditioner both soak for 5 minutes after scrubbing and then rinse. When I style it I use either TRESemme Flawless Curl Mousse or the Garnier Fructis Curl Construct Mousse. I found that the Garnier one works better though, because it leaves my hair softer than the Tresemme one :) Good luck!"
curlyhair,3ab1ln,mommas_going_mental,2,Thu Jun 18 19:02:03 2015 UTC,Thanks!   Do when you let the conditioner soak do you use a wide-tooth comb/water to style it or do you just use your hands? Also for styling do you use a comb?
curlyhair,3ab1ln,plinthe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:15:10 2015 UTC,I just run my fingers through my hair with the conditioner :) When I style my hair I do use a comb and it works wonders! I put the mousse in and then comb it through and it tames it and defines it. :)

curlyhair,3ab1ln,KatherineSour,3,Fri Jun 19 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness. It has been the best haircut decision of my life. It makes the back much more manageable and much less Hermione Granger. It only shows when I want it to, because the texture and remaining volume covers for any gaps. The stylist, when I asked for it, told me that she wouldn't normally recommend undercuts like mine to people with straight hair solely because they can't hide them as well, but she had no hesitation with me. Have I mentioned I love my undercut? :) it also makes my head much less heavy. No more ponytail-induced headaches for this girl!"

So I'm in Chicago, and the weather is tricky here, but it definitely beats the heat! The only warning I have is that if you never shaved your head before, your scalp is probably sensitive now from hiding away in your hair, so when the sun hits my head, it burns sometimes!

Also, /u/kallimabutterfly is right, those are very protein-y products. Furthermore- you might want to drop the Smoothie. It's really heavy.

curlyhair,3abxqe,TunicSongForKaren,3,Thu Jun 18 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sucks hunting for things you found on reddit in the EU, I live in Norway. I usually just google ""product name, country"" which you could try. Of course sometimes it just doesn't work. You could also try using Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.de, they might have a wide enough range of products to carry it, and then hopefully customs will be OK with it since it won't be coming in from the US (assuming you used Amazon.com before).  But anyway, you could also try to find something that's available locally. I found something similar to Suave Naturals just by reading the ingredients of some conditioners in my local grocery store. Most without silicone will say ""silicone free"" (or, ""siliconenvrij""? thanks google translate) on the front, then go in and see what else is in the product to make sure it's curl-friendly. You might discover something you love. I'm sorry but I forget the name of the one I found (it made my head itch!) but it worked really well as a co-wash and I remember thinking it was really similar to Suave Naturals (it was also suuuper cheap, and I think even coconut scented?)."
curlyhair,3adc5i,Crayon_Dragon,3,Fri Jun 19 04:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think we're hair sisters, except for the length. I highly recommend ditching drying your hair with a regular towel. Hair gets caught in the little loops of bath towels and can damage it. Get yourself a microfiber towel or even a pillow case or tshirt to kind of squish your hair dry. My other recommendation is plopping! It does wonders for my 2a/2b hair when it's below shoulder length. I plop for a while (like, hours), otherwise they just fall out. Oh, and try some gel! Lightweight gel is recommended for wavy gals instead of a heavy curl cream. And watch lots of YouTube videos."

curlyhair,3ad8na,usernameequalstress,2,Fri Jun 19 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, definitely try gel! Get a really REALLY firm hold gel. If I put nothing in mine it's also flat by the end of the day, basically just slightly wavy (with the bonus of being frizzy!). You can mix the gel with the mousse if you want, or add the mousse once everything is dry to add volume, but it's probably just not enough to hold your curls all day.

I (male) have extremely thick, frizzy, dry, coarse hair, if I press down on my hair right now, it makes the same sound as squeezing a plastic wool thingy (slight exaggeration, but its in the ballpark). I used to try to capitalize on the curliness of my hair, but that just left me with like a jew fro, my current plan of attack is keep it short so no one really takes notice of it. Ive tried argan oil shampoos and argan oil conditioners, coconut oil shampoos, stay in conditioners; they all work for about 30 minutes after the shower when my hair is still moist, but then it dries out and goes back to normal. Do I have a place in this sub? Can my hare be salvaged? I can post pictures if needed."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,ImaCheeseMonkey,3,Thu Jun 18 14:17:11 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you reeeeally need some moisture BAD.  Curly hair is so much more dry than straight hair. What products do you currently use? I would switch to a sulfate-free and silicone free shampoo, get a deep conditioner and mix it with some coconut oil, apply to damp hair and let sit for at least 45(try to do a deep treatment like this once a week until your hair condition improves), and generally try to just add constant moisture.  What stylers do you use?"

This cream keeps my hair hydrated for all of 30 minutes. If I wear a cap, it lasts longer, but as it airs out, my hair turns back to normal.  I actually have some coconut oil on hand that I can use, but im assuming it would not be the best idea to combine it with the conditioner with sulfates?"
curlyhair,3aa4qt,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Thu Jun 18 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Have you read the sidebar? The Curly Girl(guy in this case) method centers around 2 things: Sulfates are drying and should be eliminated, and silicones can only be washed out with sulfates, so they must be eliminated too.  If you plan on switching to a sulfate/silicone free shampoo, then you should eliminate silicones from all products- leavein or rinse out(they just build up rapidly on most people without a sulfate to rinse them out... but your results may vary).    There are people in here that use sulfate shampoos and silicones regularly- so it's up to you whether you want to make the switch or not. From how you're describing your hair, it could be a game changer."

Once your hair is dry, you can either leave it as-is (if you like a more ""wet"" look to your curls), or you can scrunch a bit to release the hard cast (making the curls look more natural)."

Maybe even if you still want to pineapple you could dampen it and possibly add leave in conditioner and comb thru a little using a wide tooth comb? A comb would cause less frizz and keep curls bound together more.

We suggest not brushing because it can rip and tear fragile waves/curls/coils.    Try a few different suggestions on here to see what works. Instead of brushing, try using a wide toothed comb. Instead of pineappling, try either braiding at night or using a silk bonnet/pillowcase.  What works great for some won't work for all. My hair is super fine and really doesn't react well to Pineappling. It's okay if yours doesn't either. :)"

curlyhair,3aa4qt,lemoncatparty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"I think straightening hair is generally looked down upon here, but how do you guys keep your hair straight? If you curly girls can pull it off, then my loose waves should be able to handle it, right? My hair fits the category of 2A, so I don't have so much curl as I do waviness. It holds a curl like a dream, lasting as long as I don't wash my hair. But the minute I straighten my hair, the bottom goes right back to wavy. I just want some diversity in my hair styles since my hair doesn't look nice enough on its' own to wear natural. Thanks."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,4,Tue Jun 23 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I don't look down on it =) Variety is fun! Here's my routine:   I wash my hair and blow it dry (not diffuse, regular blow-dry) with my head upside down. That adds volume, and also helps with pulling the curl out more consistently all over my head. Once it's 90% dry, I flip rightside up and section off my hair. Then I use a round brush on each section to finish straightening and pull out any extra waves. Once I'm all done, I usually have to use a straightening iron on my cowlick, it's always the trickiest part that likes to woosh in different directions.   For products, I load up on silicones. I of course have to wash them out with sulfates once I want to go back to curly, but since I do this so rarely, I don't care. I use a deep conditioner as my shower conditioner ('cones), a protein-based leave-in ('cones), and a lightweight heat protection oil ('cones). All of this prior to blow-drying. After blow-drying, I apply just a tad more leave-in (raked throughout the lengths of my hair), and then I smooth a small dollop of anti-frizz serum ('cones) along the top/outside edges to calm the flyaways."

curlyhair,3aa4qt,atmoag06,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:32:07 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that about the condition ers so thanks for letting me know. Will try some of your suggestions though!
curlyhair,3aa4qt,Phoencopterus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"So, would anyone be willing to give me a ballpark estimate of how much product they use on a regular basis?  I'm just starting out with the CG method, and I'm doing some trial and error with different products. Is there an easy way to tell if I'm not using enough product, or too much, or if it's just not a good match for my hair?  Thanks!"
curlyhair,3aa4qt,Noraart,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:53:27 2015 UTC,I seem to be using quite a bit of the VO5 Conditioner when I cowash (like maybe a 1/2 cup) and my hair is just past shoulder length and pretty thick.  For my leave in cream I separate my hair into two halves and do four pumps on each side of the curl cream.  then about 1 tablespoon of scrunchy gel (currently herbal essence) on each side.  Honestly it takes A LOT of product to define my curls.  If after I plop the curls look a little off I may scrunch a bit more gel into the ends while still wet.  Now I understand why curly girls want the cheaper versions of products!  We use a lot!  Next gel up for me to try is the LA Looks.  Good luck!
curlyhair,3aa4qt,Phoencopterus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:07:43 2015 UTC,Thank you! That helps a lot!  I hope the LA Looks works out for you - I just tried it myself and I've been really happy with it so far. And the price is a bonus!
curlyhair,3aa4qt,Noraart,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:37:50 2015 UTC,First day of LA Looks!  Man this stuff holds the curl!  It's just about completely dry (after a few hours) so I can go do a scrunch to get out some of the crunchiness!  Hope your routine settles in!
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"I have long hair that's thin and fine. It's super-processed (regular bleaching/dying), so it's definitely dry, and is low-porosity (products don't absorb very well).     CONDITIONER: There's never too much for me - I go through conditioner the most, roughly once a month I'm buying a  32oz bottle. I pile it in my hair until it's slick and slippery, like seaweed. Too little means that I can't finger- or comb-detangle in the shower.    LEAVE-IN: Too much leaves my hair feeling coated, almost waxy. Too little leaves my hair dry and tangly. It's trial-and-error with exactly how much to use, depending on the specific product. I use a whole handful of DevaCurl B'Leave In to get that perfect amount. I use a quarter-size drop of Giovanni Weightless to get that perfect amount. Etc etc. I just got 2 new leave-ins that I'm going to try, wish me luck!      STYLER: Too much leaves my hair feeling coated/waxy, and also weighs down the curls, pulling them out into waves. Too little and I'm a frizzball, with stringy ends and kinda poofy, undefined curls. Like the leave-in, it's trial and error to find the perfect amount, which depends on the brand.     NOT A GOOD MATCH: No amount of trial-and-error ever gives you the perfect amount. Your curls separate into strings instead of clumping. Your hair is tangly and matted. You start losing hair/shedding profusely. Your hair feels crunchy and brittle (protein sensitive or protein overload)."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,Phoencopterus,2,Wed Jun 24 19:41:49 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! That is really helpful. I think I am not using enough conditioner and too much leave-in. I'll have to switch that up and see how it works.
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:51:23 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!     BTW, first day using Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in. I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE how my hair feels, super soft and moisturized, very natural. I used about a quarter-size dollop for each section of my hair (I section into 3-4).     I did notice a bit of extra shedding, like the KCCC... it may be because I did my protein and deep conditioning treatments today, or it may be that my hair just doesn't like the product. I'm going to continue for a few more days just to be sure, but I wanted to update you on another one I've tried =)"
curlyhair,3aa4qt,expulsus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how to word this question. My hair gets so greasy so fast in the summer because I live in a very humid climate. I have to wash it every day or it gets so gross. In the winter, I can wash it about every 4th day or so with cowashing and dry shampoo in between and it's cool. But now, ugh. Any ideas?  Routine for those of you who want it: Wash with Ogx biotin and collagen shampoo. Condition the ever living shit out of it with Suave Naturals Ocean Breeze conditioner and twist it up for a few minutes, s2c (once a week I use ShaeMoisture Restorative Conditioner). Get out, plop for a few minutes while I brush my teeth and put in my eyeballs, unplop and scrunch 2-3 pumps of L'oreal Paris EverCurl Sculpting Gel and then a quarter of LA Looks Styling Gel (the yellow stuff), maybe a pump of the Shae Moisture stuff if I'm feeling fancy. Replop with a different t-shirt for 30-60 minutes."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"Since you're getting greasy this time of year, I'd basically recommend co-washing more often. No need to feel gross and sticky. Most curlies who live in areas with climates that vary throughout the year have to change up their routines for the seasons.   BTW, not sure if you're 100% CG-method, but the OGX Biotin/Collagen shampoo and conditioner have a non-water-soluble silicone in them (most of the OGX lines do). So you'll need sulfates to wash it out."

What can I use from around the house that can help? Is baby oil okay? My hair is beginning to frizz and dry up :/  Got thick wavy hair. Has always been set and frizzy but now its somewhat worse.
curlyhair,3aa4qt,0118999_,2,Mon Jun 22 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"Idk about baby oil but coconut oil works as an overnight treatment for me. Olive oil, avocado oil, or jojoba oil could work too, but I haven't tried them.  Alternatively you can do a quick hair mask with avocados or bananas or whatever people recommend, but that could get messy."

curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to be 100% CG, no. It has Amodimethicone, which is a non-water-soluble silicone. That means you'll need to use sulfate shampoos to wash it out.    That said, some curlies do respond well to silicones, even those that don't wash out. So it's really about what works for your hair."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,RevolcFael4,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I know some silicones are okay to use and wasn't sure about amodimethicone. I might experiment around with it later."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,RevolcFael4,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:54:23 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a maske and deep conditioner? Do you treat them the same? Thanks!
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:02:08 2015 UTC,"A deep conditioner is a type of masque. Masques can be used for different purposes: deep conditioning, protein, bond restructuring, etc. No, you don't treat them the same. I find that protein and restructuring masques need to have the instructions followed to the letter, whereas deep conditioning can be played with (left in longer, combined with other products, etc)."
curlyhair,3aa4qt,PastelWater,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm so late, but it's worth a shot! How long should I plop? Today, I plopped for 45 minutes but my hair was still soaking wet after I took it down. Is it meant to still be wet, or should I plop for a longer amount of time?"
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"My hair is still pretty wet after a 45 minute plop also... it's not dripping or anything, but yeah, it's wet. How long you do it for depends on your hair type and what you're doing afterwards, really. I wash/plop in the morning, then air-dry. Some curlies wash in the evening and plop overnight. And others wash/plop at night, then pineapple while they sleep.   Do you plop with a t-shirt or a microfiber towel? If you're using a shirt, you might try a towel instead, I found that absorbed far more water during the plop. My hair is too fine for even that though, microfiber gives me frizz =("
curlyhair,3aa4qt,frizzfrazz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:23:18 2015 UTC,"Hi! I asked this elsewhere, but perhaps it belongs here. I'm new to r/curlyhair! I have 3A type curly hair down to my waist and it's incredibly long and damaged. I'm getting it cut above my shoulders tomorrow and thought that this would be a great time to try taking better care of my hair. A friend told me about Deva Curl products, so I just purchased their NoPoo, OneConditiner, and a Defining Gel. The only problem is that these products won't arrive for a few days! What should I do to keep my hair clean and styled until the products arrive? I'd really like to use this haircut as a fresh start, so no shampoo if possible. What should I expect to happen to my hair during this process? Does anyone have any helpful advice for me? The links on the sidebar have been quite helpful so far!"
curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 23 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to wash after your cut, you could try using a dry shampoo until your products arrive. Just be sure to double-check the ingredients for silicones, I've found that most of them have them.   If you do want to wash, pick up some cheap conditioners to use in the meantime. VO5 Moisture Milks or Vanilla Mint are CG-friendly, as are Tresemme Naturals and Suave Naturals. When you use conditioner to wash your hair, make sure you really scrub it into your scalp. Since conditioners aren't sudsy, your fingers need to do the work of breaking up and residue or buildup.   Before beginning the DevaCurl products, you'll want to do a final shampoo with sulfates. That will strip any silicone and/or product buildup from your hair, so that your CG-products will be more effective. Expect a few weeks of transition once you go CG. Many curlies end up with a slightly greasier look to their hair at first, but it will balance itself out. Oh yeah, you might need a leave-in conditioner as well. You can try leaving some of the OneCondition in your hair instead of rinsing it all out, but I find a real leave-in to be more effective."

I found that certain gels made my hair do that stringy splitting thing. Have you tried any other gels or cremes? These are two that have worked well for me to get clumping:   Kinky Curly Curling Custard Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie    Or, you might need a stronger leave-in conditioner.

curlyhair,3aa4qt,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 23 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I see... too short for twist outs, and the curls definitely aren't clumping. I'd recommend changing up your routine.   The Jessicurl Curl Cream you're using is this one? That's intended as a substitute for shampoo, not as a conditioner or a leave-in. If that's what you're using, it could definitely be contributing to dryness since it's not getting rinsed out.   If you're a fan of the Jessicurl line, how about this as a leave-in, and this as a styler?   Also, keep an eye on this thread. The mod is trying to encourage tips and tricks for specific hair types, so maybe some of the other type 3s can offer more help =)"
curlyhair,3aa4qt,VerseForYou,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:55:01 2015 UTC,I honestly just went to target and picked up the first thing I saw.  The Jessicurl is definitely a curl cream for styling.

It felt like I could never use too much of the Deva gel! I loved it but my scalp hated it, so I switched the KCCC which is trickier to use, but doesn't make my scalp itch and also gives great results once you get the hang of it. Also I tend to dry it with a microfiber towel (scrunching it upside down) before I put in the KCCC, which I do by coating my hands and smoothing/scrunching it in, although I think that might encourage the ""separation"" as opposed to big clumps. I prefer more clumps since I have thinner hair, so I do that on purpose. :)"

curlyhair,3a72rl,FullColorPenguin,4,Wed Jun 17 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're probably using too much conditioner, so instead of it all soaking in, it's leaving a coating and then flaking off once it's dry.   Or is the flaking only happening at your scalp? If that's the case, you may have a dry scalp and need a more moisturizing conditioner."

I don't have any problems with build up and I don't rinse all the conditioner out. I think it depends on your curl type. The tighter the curl, the farther id stay away from shampoo. My deva stylist has a looser curl and she tells me all the time she could never just cowash. I have very healthy hair because I never hear treat, no shampoo. I almost never get rough ends. Two trims a year keeps my curls on tip top shape. I color every six weeks or so though but my hair has no problems bouncing back."

curlyhair,3a2tax,ladymegbeth1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:46:48 2015 UTC,What is plopping?
curlyhair,3a2tax,QuacksMeUp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:28:24 2015 UTC,It's a technique of wrapping your hair when it's wet.  YouTube has a lot of tutorials.
curlyhair,3a2tax,crazy_brain_lady,4,Mon Jul 6 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"I MUST ask about your haircare routine! Your hair is my dream/goal-hair. I have the same texture & curls....I would be in heaven if I could just get it to your length (while keeping it healthy). Can you share any tips/advice on how you got it to this length, along with your current routine?"
curlyhair,3a2tax,crazy_brain_lady,7,Wed Jun 17 02:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yes!  I trim it about once a quarter.   It's in layers,  and I have it dry cut ONLY.  You don't have to have a deva certified person, but it helps if the person has curly hair or ethnic hair experience.  I use Nexus shampoo and conditioniner for dry hair.  When I'm out of the shower I towel it off with a shirt.   I use John Frieda dream curls leave in spray, followed by smooth and shine mousse, and some argan oil.  Lastly I give it a good spray with big sexy hair spray.  Then I plop it and go to bed.  When I get up I take it down and if I'm going to work I just make sure and add a little mousse to the ends if they need it.  Then I let it air dey.  If I want it to be a little bigger,  I flip my head upside down, spray it really well with hairspray,  and use the diffuser to dry it.  I also make sure to scrunch the ends really well.  Also, I only wash it once a week or so because it's bone dry.  Hope that helps!"

I figure you tried the unscented products out there?

It can be tough to find 100% aloe vera-- I found it at a health food store. The smell is kind of funky cucumber. Most aloe vera products will have perfumes to cover and some have hardly any aloe, so read labels/beware."

I use the regular one as my everyday conditioner and leave-in and the Thinning Hair one as my protein treatment. I buy them from Amazon. To make them more moisturizing, I mix in oils and agave nectar or honey.  Free and Clear makes a conditioner that is specifically for very sensitive skin. I didn't find it as moisturizing as the Magick Botanicals, but it would be better than no conditioner at all."

Theres another brand called Curelle from Canada that is fragrance and irritant-free and from what I've heard they are up there with high-quality salon products but I live in the US so the shipping on them is a bit steep.

Not sure if any of the ingredients will negatively impact you, but at least they're very short lists to look at.

curlyhair,3a42mm,hannahjoy33,5,Wed Jun 17 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the products may be running down out of your hair, onto your scalp and then your forehead. Perhaps try wringing out as much water as possible from your hair post-shower, before applying products? Alternately... do you need to wash the T-shirt you're using for plopping? Maybe you have too much product built up on that and it's transferring to your skin.   I break out really easily on my face (sensitive skin), these are two other things I do to help combat it:    1) After plopping, hop back in the shower for 30-ish seconds to wash off residual products left on my face and body. This is actually when I wash my face normally with my scrub. 2) Pre-plopping, fold over the end of the shirt where my forehead will be, so it's double-thick there. Products and water are absorbed by the first layer, and the second layer keeps my forehead/hairline protected from them."
curlyhair,3a42mm,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"I typically plop overnight because just doing it for an hour or two doesn't do anything for me. I use a clean shirt every time, but I will try washing my face in the morning. I typically put coconut oil on my face after my shower. I didn't consider it, but that probably affects it a lot. Thanks!"
curlyhair,3a42mm,hashtagphag,2,Wed Jun 17 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that could definitely be part of the issue. Most curlies here who use coconut oil do it 2 very specific ways:   1) A dab on their ends, to seal them up (usually type 4s, sometimes 3s). 2) Leave it in their hair overnight, and shampoo it out the next morning.     If you're putting it on your face, then covering part, it's basically just pushing it all right into your skin and not letting your skin naturally absorb it and breathe. Maybe avoid your forehead/hairline with the coconut oil? You could also try using toner on your face in the morning, maybe that will help clear things up after the overnight plop. I use a witchhazel-based toner so it's not so drying. They're becoming more and more common above the alcohol-based. CVS sells one of their own brand, as does Oil of Olay (I prefer OOO)."

Anyway, I'd suspect that you should minimize it on your forehead/hairline area then, the plopping is probably sealing it all in and clogging the pores up there. Or try face-washing in the morning. Maybe both, depends on how your skin reacts... too much washing can also cause breakouts =("

curlyhair,3a2vft,pizzainacan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"The conditioner works well but the shampoo has sulfates and is very drying. I would recommend only using it if you need to clarify your hair. Otherwise, I would try to find a sulfate free shampoo. The L'Oreal ones are nice, so are the OGX brand.  If you are worried about a greasy scalp, do a slow transition. If you use sulfates now I would try switching to a sulfate free shampoo for every other wash. When your hair is ok with that, step it up to 2 sulfate free washes then one sulfate wash... repeat. Just keep adding sulfate free washes between sulfate washes and before you know it, you are only using sulfates once a month or so. I used to have greasy head too... I currently only wash my hair once a week and very rarely need to clarify."
curlyhair,3a2vft,DraftingJunkie,2,Tue Jun 16 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"Just a bit of a warning... the L'Oreal and OGX brands aren't completely free of sulfates, they just contain less harsh ones. I just recently found this out. This may be good for OP with greasy hair wanting a slow transition. I unknowingly did a slow transition by using them.  As for a drugstore sulfate-free find, just the other day I bought Shea Moisture shampoo. I have only used it about 3 times so far, but from my understanding it is CG friendly! I got it for about $10.00 at Target, which is a little expensive but not much more than L'Oreal and OGX. My last bottle of OGX lasted me about 5 1/2 months. So while the shampoos can be expensive, washing your hair less often (thanks to the low/no sulfates) will make your shampoo last longer."
curlyhair,3a2vft,brinana_629,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Good advice here, I'm doing the slow transition. Once I clarified, I was able to switch immediately to alternating non-sulfate shampoo and cowashing, without noticing any greasiness or build-up. Now I'm working on increasing the days I cowash. Hopefully one day I'll get to the point where I can actually skip washing and have 2nd day hair (oh, the dream!)  For those with bangs (I have them), I wash those every day with shampoo regardless. There's just too much oil transfer from my face to leave them alone."

curlyhair,39wx3i,HipstaMomma,14,Mon Jun 15 18:16:51 2015 UTC,Haha thank you! I'm pleasantly caffeinated now and beginning to recognize where I am and what day it is.
curlyhair,39wx3i,HipstaMomma,7,Mon Jun 15 18:56:06 2015 UTC,I actually found a solution to this problem and i started using http://www.scunci.com/nodamage-flatelastics They don't have the glue in the center or the metal. My scrunchies never break and my hair stays in place.
curlyhair,39wx3i,xNotMagicx,2,Tue Jun 16 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"Ha, that's much cheaper than my solution: braids!!!!    But those are wonderful for anyone trying to get their hair up out of their faces!!"
curlyhair,39wx3i,Bulbysaur123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:22:43 2015 UTC,I have tons and tons and tons of these because i would always lose them. So whenever i'd go to the store I'd buy like two or three packs of the scrunchies. So now i have a bunch. You can also wash them and they never get worn out!
curlyhair,39wx3i,HipstaMomma,2,Tue Jun 16 00:31:41 2015 UTC,"My favorite (when I can resist chopping my hair long enough to need them) are ""Flexi8""s. They're metal, so they don't break, and they've got a bit more personality to them than regular bands. The drawback is that you can't just snap 'em around your wrist for easy access, though. (I haven't bought any in years, and they've seriously expanded the variety of styles. Some of these are so cute they make me not want to chop my locks.)"
curlyhair,39wx3i,coldvault,2,Tue Jun 16 00:51:20 2015 UTC,I always thought these had glue so I never bought them. It's just one whole piece of elastic? amazing.

I have corkscrew curly hair and my mother's, sister's, father's and brother's are all perfectly straight.  My mother just detested my hair when I was little, she had no idea what to do with it. She used to attack it with a brush in the most jaw-clenchingly painful way, and when it would fray and rip she'd mutter that my hair was fucked up because of antibiotics I took as a baby. Eventually she gave up and chopped it off, which constantly got me mistaken for a boy. Bleh."

curlyhair,39wx3i,imjustafangirl,2,Mon Jun 15 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"That happened to me the other day. My hair is extremely long, was past my butt then I cut off 5 inches and no one noticed because it's still really long, and it's super curly. So my hair elastic tends to snap under the weight of my hair. Like it's become an issue. I can't leave it down all the time either because I live in Phoenix and tomorrow is supposed to be over 110 degrees. I'm almost ready to just cut it all off."

I typically just use a pen (with NO rubber grip-ouch!) but have some bona fide hair sticks I use too."
curlyhair,3a1jae,AwkwardBalloonMan,2,Tue Jun 16 14:35:00 2015 UTC,Yes! I randomly grabbed it from Target last month and I fucking love it. The mint conditioner feels tingly and cool on my head (awesome for summer) and i also use it as a leave-in since it's so smooth and not too thick. I highly recommend!
curlyhair,3a1jae,BabyFlower,2,Tue Jun 16 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"I really liked it as a co-wash, but I found that after a while it stopped working for me as well. I eventually figured out that it was because Renpure has a high amount of protein, and I have protein-sensitive hair. So I would suggest using it unless you are protein-sensitive. Until the protein build-up was too much I loved it!"
curlyhair,3a1jae,youre_a_baboon,2,Tue Jun 16 18:53:38 2015 UTC,How do you know if your hair needs protein or not?
curlyhair,3a1jae,BabyFlower,2,Wed Jun 17 02:52:58 2015 UTC,"I only figured it out because my hair eventually reacted badly to high protein products. Basically my hair started to become straw-like, regardless of how much conditioner I put in it. Also, I read some of the side bar links to find out more and did the porosity test, and my hair didn't sink in a bowl of water (even overnight!). This helped me to realize my hair is very low porosity and is more prone to protein buildup."

curlyhair,3a1jae,naina9290,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"I've used a few of their different products and quite like them. Co-washing just isn't for me, so I wanted to pick up a gentler shampoo that I could use a few times a week.   The shampoo still lathers, but doesn't dry my hair out and it leaves my hair cleaner and less oily than traditional sulfate shampoo. I also really, really like the conditioners which have taken to doubling as conditioner for my makeup brushes.  I like their Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner, which had been the first one I tried and I have repurchased them. I find their Coconut Cream products are more moisturizing than the Argan ones. Their apple products are nice too, but I keep those on hand more so for my little sisters because I do not like the scent of apple anything."

Shampooing only when you get split ends?   There's not a whole lot you can do to change your hair growth cycle. You could start taking vitamins to encourage overall better body health, which supposedly has an effect on hair growth (vitamins B, D, and E, specifically, as well as Biotin) ... but there's a lot of claims against that theory as well.    I'd actually recommend you re-introduce masques to your hair again... you're getting some frizz, which is usually a sign of being under-hydrated.

curlyhair,39zu3s,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 16 08:40:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I found a post somewhere on here (which I can no longer find) it was for mixed hair, but since my hair is insane in general I was like ""why not give it a shot!"" So I bought OGX argan oil and shea butter shampoo, Garnier sleek and shine conditioner, VO5 herbal escapes kiwi lime conditioner, L'Oreal Paris eversleek reparative smoothing conditioner, and ORS curls unleashed leave-in conditioner.   I normally wash my hair 2x a week (sometimes 3 if i feel like my hair feels really gross) and once a week I use shampoo (I have dry scalp, so I use tea tree shampoo, and then the OGX shampoo)  I wet my hair off completely, and comb it out to the front of my  face (horror movie The Ring style) I then use the VO5 to cover everything (but the scalp) very well, to the point where there's even an excess amounts of it. I make sure the tips are very very very covered. I leave it in for a few minutes. Rinse it out completely, then use the Garnier conditioner, and do the same thing, but keep it in longer. Once I rinse it out, I leave some of still in my hair, and get of the shower like that. Once I'm out, I use the ORS in my hair (I used them mostly on the tips). I air dry my hair completely, and then if there's still a little more frizz in it, I use the L'Oreal in my hair.  Once bed time comes around I use a satin cap to cover my hair, and it keeps it nice and soft for the next few days.   I hope this helped at all. (:"

Basically, here is how my routine goes: I shower every night, though I hardly ever shampoo my hair - maybe once every three weeks. I condition my hair very heavily with TreSemme conditioner, then ""finger comb"" it in the shower. After that, I flip my hair forward and put around 5 pumps of the Deva ""b-leave in"" in my palm. I then ""squish"" that up so it moves into the bottom of my curls - none of it goes by the scalp. I then get out of the shower, dry my hair with a microfiber towel and then put the deva gel in - I actually use quite a bit of it. I clip up my wet hair with ""deva clips"" and then let it air dry for an hour or two. I go to bed with it slightly wet."

You mentioned coarse, but is it thin, thick, or medium? That will also matter for product recommendations.     As far as lift at the roots, the most common method are clipping up the roots (typically air-dried), or blow-drying (with a diffuser). Once your hair is fully dry, you scrunch your curls to release the hard cast from the styling products."

The curl is obviously there in the 3rd picture, since it starts at the roots.  Have you moved? A change in humidity or hard/soft water might contribute. What was your previous routine? Have you tried a strand test for a protein treatment? My strands ""test"" as low-porosity, but my hair is very fine and LOVES protein treatments (and they always make my hair curlier).   If all else fails, like /u/Fire-Kissed suggested, your hair might have just changed. In that case, a deva-cut and lots of products might make it look similar."
curlyhair,39v6mh,Curly_Alice,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"Hey guys! So I could use any advice right now on how to get my hair as curly as it used to be. Two years ago, all I used was some tresemme mousse and biosilk and my hair was super curly. However, I began to slowly lose my curls and eventually it became very limp and lifeless. For the past few months, I’ve discovered the curly hair method and that I have low porosity hair. I’ve also read up that I should avoid proteins and I’ve been following that mostly with my hair regime. The routine I currently follow is first; I cowash my hair twice with VO5 moisture milk (strawberries and cream). Then I use the same conditioner to condition my hair for five minutes and I wash it all out with hot water at the end of my shower. I plop my hair for about half an hour after. Then I apply some pantene mousse to my hair and la looks gel second. I flip my hair upside down and diffuse it maybe for five minutes until I get lazy. It usually doesn’t dry my hair even halfway through but it gives it some defining shape.   I've been thinking that maybe I should try a deva cut or getting better/more layers cut in my hair."
curlyhair,39v6mh,Fire-Kissed,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"Do you use heat on your hair at all? Anything else that has changed since then? Did you move to another climate? Do you brush your hair?   Hair does change over time, you may just have a different pattern now.  I get a lot more defined curls when I scrunch upward while diffusing!   edit: by heat, what I really meant was, do you straighten your hair or do any other kind of heat styling besides diffusing? I know I've got some heat damage that has loosened my curls up a lot."
curlyhair,39v6mh,Liakada,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:33:48 2015 UTC,"My hair was much curlier (but also more frizzy) when I didn't condition it as much. A few years ago I didn't use any conditioner at all and my hair would just suck up the humidity in the air and get super curly.   Now that my hair is smoother and more saturated with moisture, it doesn't curl as much, but overall looks better."

curlyhair,39sxgy,ludecknight,3,Sun Jun 14 18:03:02 2015 UTC,It's microfiber and it twists into an easy turban type shape instead of trying to do it with a towel.

curlyhair,39sxgy,ludecknight,2,Sun Jun 14 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like a hood and the top part of the hood goes on the back of your head.

curlyhair,39uq7z,-PaperbackWriter-,8,Sun Jun 14 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"I just saw you over on another sub, I'll post what I do for my kiddo here. Maybe it's something to start with?  Firstly, no sulfates or silicones. Secondly, I do not use shampoo on my daughter's hair. At all. Thirdly, no brushes, but ESPECIALLY not when dry. Damage city. I use Tressemme Perfectly Undone to co-wash, finger comb through the knots (be patient, it's worth it), massage into scalp, rinse thoroughly, and then leave in some Suave Naturals. Air dry. Those two products are working wonderfully for her (and my hair, too).  Now, for every day management, if I do not wet her hair and add in a little bit of conditioner, her hair turns into a tangled web in the back when she sleeps. She sleeps like a maniac and her hair shows it. It's a LOT of work, and yes there are days where she has a pony tail because I do not have the time or patience to do all the other stuff, and sometimes, neither does she. That's okay.  The biggest difference that I have seen in her hair and mine, is no shampoo, and daily leave in conditioning. Condition, condition, condition. Hope you figure it out!"

curlyhair,39u2o4,ronniejean1,2,Sun Jun 14 19:53:18 2015 UTC,Cutting your hair and adding in layers usually helps. Whenever my hair gets too long it weighs my curls down. Plopping helps a lot too if you aren't already using it in your routine.   I used to clip my hair at the roots (just grab little sections and place the clip close to the scalp) and it helped a bit. But it wouldn't last too long and looked awkward as some spots had more volume than others. Oh and I've also left the house with forgetting one in my hair a few times lol. I found switching to a diffuser gave me much better results but the clips are worth a try. The ones deva curl sells are the type of clips you should look for but try to find a cheaper brand if you can. Here's there video explaining it better.  https://youtu.be/LFLCD12RKbw  Hope that helps.
curlyhair,39u2o4,youaintbad,4,Sun Jun 14 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Sally's has pin curl clips that are totally the same (at least imo) as the Devacurl ones, and way less expensive."

curlyhair,39rfhs,NothingWithoutHouse,7,Sun Jun 14 05:37:50 2015 UTC,"Sure! I don't adhere to a particular routine, I just kind of go with the flow (or get really frustrated and upset). I break all of the traditional DevaCurl rules: I use a flat iron, I brush my hair when it's dry and when it's wet in the shower, I haven't used a deep conditioner in months, and I need some sort of shampoo to keep my scalp from getting too much build-up. However, I still try to make these things as minimally damaging as possible: I buy natural products where I know every ingredient, I only use a wetbrush to brush my hair, I use some sort of heat protector when I style it, and I use this shampoo bar on my scalp only and let it rinse through the end of my hair.  The key to less frizz is to not rinse all of your conditioner out. I like to put conditioner all over and then rinse that out and then put more conditioner on only the length of my hair. Then I just flip my head over and scrunch my curls and let most, but not all of the conditioner rinse out. After I get out of the shower I don't touch it with a towel. I just try to squeeze as much of the water out as possible and clip a towel over my shoulders so I don't have to feel the icky wet hair. Today I doubled up and also scrunched in a little smoother product and ended up being super pleased with the results.   Sorry for the information overload! I hope this helps, and let me know if you want to know any specifics about the products or anything! :)"

curlyhair,39sx1u,DVazquez810,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:27:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe try a higher hold gel. When you use gel, your hair should dry and feel crunchy. This is your hair drying into that shape, so when you scrunch out the crunch, your hair should stay in that shape. So if your hair isn't doing that now, maybe a higher hold gel would help achieve that."
curlyhair,39sx1u,littleotterpop,2,Sun Jun 14 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say that while I agree on the higher-hold gel, not everyone's hair will dry crunchy, depending on how it's styled. For example, I can apply any amount of super hold gel to my dripping wet hair, and it doesn't get crunchy, but I easily get 3-4 day hair. If I apply it to soaking-wet hair that's not still dripping, It might get crunchy, but not always."

curlyhair,39qbca,NayaJY,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. Oyin Handmade's ""juices"" are good for leave-in, refresher, as well as detangling.   Plain aloe vera juice in a spray bottle can also be used as a leave in and moisturizer.   https://www.oyinhandmade.com/hair/need/refresh/the-juices.html You can find them at Target and some Whole Foods if you don't want to order online."
curlyhair,39rfxa,cabbage_patch_pooch,4,Sun Jun 14 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"I have two satin night caps. I got them on Amazon for $5 ish each (not much of a splurge). I like my second day curls much better with a cap compared with pineapple-ing. Occasionally they fall off at night, but more often then just slide back a little. Sometimes my curls have weird shapes when I take the cap off. I spray them a bit with DevaCurl Mist-er Right and clip them down with the rest of my hair while I do my make up and get dressed."
curlyhair,39rfxa,AlizarinQ,3,Sun Jun 14 05:36:08 2015 UTC,Maybe I should try out a satin cap before going for a silk one. Do you find sleeping with the satin cap makes your head heat up?  Thanks for sharing :)
curlyhair,39rfxa,breckerx,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:19:20 2015 UTC,"I bought a satin night cap from Sally's for about $4, it's been working wonders for me. Pineappling would kill my curls every night and braiding was a hassle. I'd say to try out the satin before the silk since it's cheaper and it should still be able to maintain your curls."
curlyhair,39qyky,MarvinHubert,2,Sat Jun 13 22:09:20 2015 UTC,"What works for some doesn't work for all.  I have fine hair(3a/b) and absolutely cannot use any leave-in products of SheaMoisture's. They weigh my hair down like nothing else. My leave-in is Tresemme naturals Radiant Volume conditioner and then I use a gel on top(LA Looks sport gel). I do use SheaMoisture's 10in 1 shampoo, but only once every few weeks. I co-wash the rest of the time with Tresemme's Perfectly Undone conditioner ."
curlyhair,39qyky,ImaCheeseMonkey,2,Sat Jun 13 23:49:46 2015 UTC,"My hair is also fine, it's 2C and easily falls flat. I don't use any leave-in conditioner at all, only gel (the harder hold the better! right now I use Kinky Curly Curling Custard, I have used LA Looks sport gel in the past, which is also good, I also love the Deva Curl gel and mousse mixed together). I definitely don't plop (this flattens my hair even more!). To wash I use Deva Curl LowPoo and then One Condition. When I get out of the shower I scrunch upside down with a microfiber towel, then scrunch in some gel, then I flip right side up and clip the roots up to volumize (like this or this - these are youtube videos) and then air dry. The more dry it is when I take the clips out, the more volume I get. I also find the more I dry it with the towel the more volume I get. Adding gel and THEN using the towel gives me fewer, bigger clumps, but I want more, smaller clumps for more volume. It can get a little frizzy to dry it so much before adding product, but the volume is worth it (for me)."
curlyhair,39qyky,all_u_need_is_cheese,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:59:34 2015 UTC,This is great advice!  I will definitely be trying it out.  Thanks!
curlyhair,39qyky,Curly_Alice,2,Mon Jun 15 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"You mention that your hair used to be curly with traditional shampoo and conditioner. Does this not work anymore? Hair types change throughout a person's life, so it might be less curly, or just require different treatment.   The curly girl method was started because many curlies have dry or super dry hair. If your hair is not dry, it might not be for you. Maybe a regular shampoo and a hydrating conditioner might work? Or, if you're wanting to try the CG method still, grab Volumizing conditioner (I'm pretty sure Tressemme has a CG friendly volumizing conditioner). You can use this as a cowash and to squish to condish.   I definitely third the gel recommendations. How dry is your hair in those pictures? It looks like it's still not quite dry, and it looks a little wispy, not quite frizzy, but those wisps might turn into frizz. I think this means you don't have enough product, or the right type of product.   I'll also suggest you trying a protein treatment too, but search for recommended protein treatments for your hair type. These always make my hair curlier, but my hair is VERY fine.   In conclusion, I'll suggest trying a protein treatment (strand test first, just in case), grab a volumizing conditioner, and using gel (I use lots, you might need less, it's trial and error here). Oh, and if it's volume you're after, clipping is great, but diffusing is what works for me."

curlyhair,39pq79,vonlowe,5,Sat Jun 13 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would definitely think about trying out a gel. After I s2c in the shower I rake in a good amount L.A. Looks Gel into my hair while it is upside down. I then add a little more gel onto my hands and slide my hands down my hair shaft from root to tip to promote clumping(while still upside down). I then add a little more gel to my hands and scrunch. I know that sounds like a lot of product, but i have thick, long curls. Also because your hair is sopping wet a lot of the product gets squeezed out when you scrunch. At this point I'm trying to scrunch most of the water out because I do not dry with any kind of towel. I have just found that it just causes way to much frizz for me. Lastly, once I step out of the shower I go straight into plopping for about 15 min. Then air dry. If I feel like i need to scrunch more after I'm out of the shower I only touch my hair with gel on my hands. My hair is so prone to frizz and tangling it's the only way I can avoid it.  It took my a long time of experimenting and trying different techniques and products to finally find out what works for me. You should definitely give gel a chance."

curlyhair,39nedy,atheologist,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:42:41 2015 UTC,Frizz will happen the more porous your hair is. Check out porosity of your own hair.... helps determine what products work best for you.  I'm 3a low porosity so my hair tends to keep it's shape (straight or curly) - I use leave in conditioner and a gel to help define curls and scrunch the gel out when it's fully dry. I prefer soft feel to my curls.
curlyhair,39nedy,swotty,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"My hair actually seems to be low porosity, I did the test to see if it floats or sinks in water and it floats, but it does not keep its shape very well. I mean, if I straighten it in humid weather it's not going to be curly by the time I get to work, but it will definitely expand and become wavy.  I was going by the description on Naturally Curly with the frizz thing, but I'm also still trying to figure out a lot about my hair's behavior."
curlyhair,39m7he,moe-money,2,Fri Jun 12 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"My routine:  1.Just started limiting this step to 1-2x a week. Use Yes To Carrots shampoo only on my scalp, rubbing my scalp with my fingerpads. On days I don't use shampoo I cowash my scalp with Shea Moisture's Coconut & Hibiscus Cowash Conditioning Cleanser.  2.Use Tresemme naturals liberally throughout my hair, detangling with fingers.  3.Rinse out 3/4 of the conditioner in cold water. Leave my hair soaking wet, I don't S2C, it makes my hair frizzier.  4.Comb in Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner with fingers  5.Scrunch in Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Smoothie and the Styling Milk. I still haven't standardized how much of each. I think for this after picture I did about 50-50.  6.Spray with the Shea Moisture Yucca & Plantain frizz control spray  7.Scrunch in Garnier Fructis gel, I think its the curl sculpting but not positive  8.Use a microfiber towel and scrunch my hair more to take out extra water   9.Flip my hair over my head and plop using a cotton t shirt overnight  10.Spray with a tiny bit of water, spray in some more of the frizz spray, scrunch a little bit to redefine and let it air dry the rest of the way.   Edited because of formatting, also I have dyed the hair color 1x since I started CG, trying to get from red to my natural brown again!"

curlyhair,39mksw,wenchytiem,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"Hi again! The other day I posted pictures from before and after my first Deva Cut (found here), and some were concerned that my post-Deva hair was less curly, and wanted to know how my curls looked when I styled them myself. Well, here they are! I love them, because they feel like a more uniform and lighter version of my previous locks. I'm especially thrilled that the giant mass of curls by my face on my left side have now been tamed and don't overtake my face as much.  Here is my routine!  Products   SheaMoisture's Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo Suave Naturals conditioner Aussie Instant Freeze Sculpting Gel   Routine   In the shower before going to bed, I lather my whole hair in the shampoo, paying special attention to my roots and scalp. Wash out shampoo. Lather my hair (excluding my roots) in the conditioner. I mean, I just pour it on. I use A TON, and since I only wash my hair once a week, it never feels like I'm constantly buying more. De-tangle hair with fingers and remove excess hair that's totally falling out at this point. Sometimes I start the de-tangling process with the shampoo, but I don't think it makes much of a difference either way. Leave the conditioner in and do other shower fun stuff. When ready, flip hair over and comb through it with fingers again, and add even more conditioner. Squish hair a bit to encourage natural curl, then squish to condish! My secret is I don't actually wait until it stops dripping. My back/neck can't handle that position very long, so I do it long enough to feel like my curls are in a good place and aren't totally soaked. Leave shower still bent over, and sqiush about a 50 cent piece's worth of gel. I think this is one of the most important parts. Do NOT be afraid to use a lot of gel, because you will squish out the gross-looking cast in the morning. Once I started using more gel, my curls started looking SO much more sculpted and healthy and bouncy and all-around more lovely. Plop for as long as I can before I need to sleep. This can be between 30 minutes and two hours. I haven't noticed a significant difference with timing. Once ready for bed, I flip my head over, take out the plop, then gently fan my hair out behind my head on the pillow and sleep. In the morning, I flip that hair over again and squish out the icky gel cast, and voila! Healthy happy curls!   That's my whole routine! Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll be happy to answer. <3"

curlyhair,39m3im,OliveWildly,3,Fri Jun 12 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yikes, pink irritated spots???? That sounds like an allergic reaction, try changing shampoos and see if they go away. If they don't, change conditioners to see if that's the culprit. If you still have them after that, go see a dermatologist... that's definitely not normal. What shampoo is it? Maybe we can look at the ingredients and see if we can find a culprit.      Oh yeah, plopping will totally do that, the hair at my scalp is all smooshed down when I release it too. What I do is shake my head around a bit to release the smoosh, arrange my curls/part how I want them, then use clips to hold their position and encourage volume. I use pin curl clips since my hair is so thin/fine, but other recommendations are duck bill clips and roller jaw clamps. I can go to work with my hair wet, and sit in a cubicle where it doesn't matter that I have all these random clips. If you're facing the public, you may need to diffuse your hair dry instead. Diffusing will definitely add volume, especially if you have your head upside down while you do it.       Regarding your earlier journey that wasn't working... what were you cowashing with, and how often? I have to wash my hair every single day or I get oily - no second day hair for me. I didn't jump right into only cowashing, I refuse to deal with a greasy transition period, LOL. I shampoo 3x a week, and cowash the other 4. I'm going to try stretching that out as time goes on, see if I can cut down the shampooing to even less, but the second I see grease, the shampoo is coming back in. For cowashing, I use a really lightweight runny conditioner (VO5), and scrub in into my scalp. I don't let it sit on my head, I treat the same way I would shampoo, and fully rinse it out before applying my normal conditioners."
curlyhair,39m3im,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"sigh I am worried it might be an allergic reaction. I'm not technically allergic to anything in the shampoo, but I am allergic to tons of stuff (mostly food and outdoors and life).   Products I'm Using:  - SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo  - TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner - Herbal Essences Set Me Up Mousse (rarely, bc it seems to weigh down my hair)  When I was cowashing, I used Tresemme Naturals - same conditioner as now. (Maybe that's part of the problem?) I was cowashing my hair about 2x a week. I try not to wash it often because I have a very bright blue color, and I don't want it to fade too much."
curlyhair,39m3im,hashtagphag,2,Fri Jun 12 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"Allergic to food and outdoors, you say? Any of these things trigger your allergies?     Aloe Vera Rosemary Honeysuckle Neem/Melia Azadirachta (there's no easy way to describe it)   Those are all in the SheaMo shampoo you're using. You could try switching to the SM 10-in-1 Renewal System instead... it has Aloe, but none of other 3, and it's color-safe as well. It has lots of fruit extracts though, I dunno if any of those would set you off.   Hmmm, I thought Tresemme Naturals was supposed to be lightweight, and I know plenty of curlies around this sub use it. But they may have different hair texture and porosity than you. Since you're using it as your normal shower conditioner, that implies to me that it's been really hydrating and moisturizing, so it's very possible that it could be too heavy as a cowash for you."

curlyhair,39h316,VerdePatate,4,Thu Jun 11 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"The most important thing for my hair is water. I run water through my hair then twirl sections in a ringlet shape to fix any frizz.

curlyhair,39h316,empress-of-blandings,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not OP, but it helps me to do a modified squish to condish method.   I flood my hair with conditioner, keeping the most on the tips. By flood, I mean make it slippery like seaweed. I let that sit, then rinse the top of my head like I would with shampoo (getting conditioner out of the roots). Then, I cup water in my hands, turn my head upside down and start squishing the tips with that water.   Sometimes rinsing it that way makes my hair dry, but you can always add a drop of conditioner in the bottom and squish again.  Best of luck!"

It depends on the day and if my hair decides to cooperate. I use water and occasionally use more conditioner for touch ups. I usually just cup my hands under the running water and then scrunch it into my hair. That way it doesn't get soaked, but it's enough to be able to reshape any disheveled curls."

I took a huge risk getting my hair cut as I didn't know the stylist super well, but I saw photos of cuts she had done before and she had mildly curly hair herself. I definitely recommend going to someone with similar hair to you - that way they understand how it works when cut.   I got my hair cut when I was 13 and it turned out so awful that I never got it cut again until about a year ago. Look up reviews for salons, ESPECIALLY reviews from other people with curly hair. If the stylist thinks they can just cut it how they'd cut straight hair - run far away. It was mostly a lot of asking around until I got a lot of good reviews about the stylist I went to.   Good luck! I hope you find the right stylist for you!"

curlyhair,39lvu7,lionessinbloom,2,Fri Jun 12 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"Are you getting split ends or breakage? If your hair is so damaged it's doing that, it will impact your rate of growth.If you're not already doing so, I'd recommend protein treatments (to replace what was stripped out with bleaching) and deep conditioning (to add moisture and softness back in after the protein treatment).   I've got ombre bleaching on my hair currently. My bangs grow fast, but they're also trimmed regularly, removing damage before it has a chance to travel up the hair shaft. My length grows more slowly because it's been processed, and eventually the ends will split and/or break. That means it's time for a haircut to remove the dead hair.   You can start small and work your way into cutting off the damage, so it's not so drastic. Start with a small trim, 1/2 to 1 inch, and see how your hair reacts. As you treat your hair better and it gets healthier, you can time full haircuts so they won't impact your length. I get a cut every 3-4 months, which maintains my mid-back length. If I want to grow it longer, I'd probably change that to every 6 months, with a maintenance trim halfway through."

Mine also looks best the first day, but I have a trick for making it curly again 2nd and sometimes 3rd day... I style with Kinky Curly Curling Custard the first day, and 2nd/3rd day I take a shower and get my hair damp but not wet by scrunching it with wet hands (first right side up, then upside down). The humidty and scrunching really re-awakens my curls and sort of re-activates the KCCC. It dries in only a few minutes because it only gets a bit damp, and doesn't get really ""crunchy"" again. This does result in some frizz, but otherwise my hair is FLAT so if I want it curly again I just go with the frizz and maybe smooth down the outer layer with more water or a little argan oil when I get out of the shower. :)  If I don't do this, then I have waves by 2nd day and almost straight hair by 3rd day. I have also been trying just going with that. I think I've said before on this sub that it's kind of like having Transformer hair. :)"

I used to wet my hair to redefine my curls but eventually it would dry out, I didn't realize you need the oil part. I prefer coconut oil to argan oil (it's lighter) but it depends on your hair.

curlyhair,39ek4g,girl_of_bat,3,Thu Jun 11 20:08:58 2015 UTC,Well I have a similar curl to yours and I have the same issue. So far I haven't found anything that hydrates my curls right for summer weather BUT using gel while it's wet helps them keep their shape for longer (though you can't run your fingers through it.) I totally get what you're saying about hats and laying down or putting it up. I sometimes keep a small spray bottle of water in my purse and spray down my curls and rescrunch them when they get crushed. That helps occasionally.
curlyhair,39ek4g,Prinsessa,7,Thu Jun 11 08:51:39 2015 UTC,Spray bottle in your purse is an amazing idea to in between touch ups!  I usually use my hair to dry my hands after I wash them to help reset fly aways.

curlyhair,39ek4g,msmnstr,7,Thu Jun 11 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"Your hair is magnificent! I might be a little jealous. I agree with others that gel will help your curls last longer. Washing your hair with a light conditioner instead of shampoo most days and leaving some in should help keep your hair hydrated and lessen frizz but I don't have hard water so I'm not sure if that would be an issue. Curl creme helps with frizz and hydration too. Wetting your hair with a spray bottle of water mixed with a little conditioner can help your curls reform if they get frizzy or messy. Also totally rewetting but not rewashing and reapplying products is a possibility if your hair is not dirty but a real mess.   Lastly, I wouldn't say this to many men but you...you can totally pull off a scrunchy bun. Pile all your hair on top of your head in a loose scrunchy before bed or doing activities that mess your hair up and your curls should be better preserved when you take it down.  You will have even more volume when you first take it down but your hair will settle."
curlyhair,39ek4g,debronair,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:05:33 2015 UTC,"How/when do you use curl cream? Also is there one that you would recommend? My hair is 2C/3A, and super thin, so I have to be careful not to use products that are too heavy or my hair will be weighed down."
curlyhair,39ek4g,msmnstr,2,Thu Jun 11 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"I have fine hair and I can only use a little bit of curl creme! I usually work it through my hair after I wash it but before I use gel. It's a softer hold than gel (no crunch) and I use it mostly for its anti-frizz and moisturizing properties. You can use it on its own too but I think if I did that it would be too heavy/oily with not enough hold for my hair type and length so that's why I use both. You can also use a teensy tiny bit and a little water to redefine individual dry curls that have frizzed out but careful! Too much does weigh down thin or fine hair.   I've been using DevaCurl's styling creme but I hesitate to recommend it because it's expensive and that would be a waste if it didn't work for you. Plus there might be something much better for fine hair out there- I'm pretty new to cremes and still experimenting. But I will say it's the best smelling hair product I own- not overwhelming or perfumey, just the most clean and delicious orange smell ever. For that reason alone I'm determined to make it work for my head!  I did see this slideshow that has some instructions on creme use and recommendations of products for different hair types, maybe it will be helpful?  Not sure why it mentions wavy hair in the link-it does cover other types. http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/wavy-hair-type-2/how-to-use-curl-creams/#!slide1  Edited to add: more curl creme recommendations in the Holy Grail Product list on the sidebar!"

Oops, I meant fine hair not thin lol, I couldn't think of the correct word.  I'm currently using DevaC No-Poo, Condish, and the Styling Gel, but I've read that using all three in combination can lead to dry, limp hair ( which I am starting to experience ).

I've tried going longer without washing but it only gets worse.   What is a scrunchy bun? I usually do a loose big poofy bun when I'm working out or doing something. I shower at night often so I'll usually try to do a good job of detangling my hair, and then do a tight top knot to keep it that way, and then in the morning it's usually still fairly wet anyways so that when I let it down it gets a chance to dry.

And here I thought that men had it easier when it comes to grooming.  A scrunchy is one of these, a fabric covered elastic. Maybe I should have spelled it scrunchie? They come in lots of different sizes and colors, many but not all of them super girly. You can find them anywhere where hair stuff is sold and they're super cheap.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B008AYLAP2/ref=pd_aw_sim_121_23?refRID=0C2X30K60SC046M0FQ4P  You just loop it around your bun like an elastic band but unlike an elastic band it won't get tangled and pull and frizz your hair. It will keep your hair up without needing to be super tight which can give you weird crimps in your curls and headaches. You'd probably want the biggest one you can find (bigger than the one pictured) because you have a lot of hair and you'd want it to be loose enough to loop around your hair a few times and keep it up without squishing it out of shape."

curlyhair,39ek4g,dior_show,3,Thu Jun 11 07:05:25 2015 UTC,"Love that Malibu stuff. Smells so good and feels clean! Like others have suggested, adding a gel might help hold things together.   Also, it could be that your hair is protein sensitive. Over abundance of protein might be causing some of the chaos."
curlyhair,39ek4g,undueinfluence,2,Thu Jun 11 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"Yes!  And I think Natures Gate has protein in it.  My hair is protein sensitive (low porosity) and NG makes my hair feel like straw.  OP you may want to use a different conditioner, something more hydrating with no protein in the ingredients.  Tresemme Naturals is cheap and protein and silicone free.  If you want something in the all-natural, cruelty free realm, I'm not sure what's best.  I've yet to find a truly all-natural conditioner that hydrates well enough.  Also, gel is a good idea.  If you put it in when hair is wet, let it dry, and then scrunch out the crunch, your hair will be soft but maintain good curl definition.  Its all about scrunching once its dry if you don't like that stiff feeling the gel creates.  This will break the cast and soften it up in look and feel.  I use Boo Bamboo Frizz Control Curl Defining Gel.  For gel, its very soft and light."

I'm mostly happy with my hair, and after trying a lot of different products I'm currently using Herbal Essence paraben and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and moisturizing mousse. However I've noticed with any products I use the back of my hair always seems to be frizzy and dry and doesn't curl, and I can't figure it out! I try to make sure I get product through all of my hair, and this happens after I shower in the morning and go out so I'm not laying on my hair or anything.   Anyone have any advice? Thanks! :)"

curlyhair,39gpap,Coostabo,3,Thu Jun 11 16:31:19 2015 UTC,I have very thin hair due to it falling out (still trying to figure out why) and usually you wouldn't notice due to the huge amount of frizz. Now that I've gone CG the frizz is gone and my hair looks nicer/healthier but the thinning is way more apparent.  I wash it once/twice a week with a mild sulfate-free shampoo and use Desert Essence Fragrance Free Conditioner as a leave in. Deep condition with coconut oil once a week.  I'm not 100% sure about porosity and curl type but I've put down what I think I have in my flair :)
curlyhair,39gpap,Luckydiaz,3,Thu Jun 11 16:39:49 2015 UTC,Try layers or maybe clipping your roots for a bit more volume? :) That helps me. I hope you figure out what's causing the hair loss! Looks gorgeous!

I also love volume in my hair and I understand the confusion in how to get volume, but also have great curly hair.   I have long layers in my hair and it really does help the curls out.  The layers prevent the hair from being weighed down."
curlyhair,39gpap,dragonfox,2,Thu Jun 11 22:01:21 2015 UTC,"""If you want volume, you're going to have to deal with some frizz"" <- Said directly by my Deva-trained hair stylist.    Your hair is finally hydrated, which will weigh it down.  If you want more volume, try leaving a little less conditioner in and/or you could try using a gel.  You didn't list what styling product you use (creme, gel, etc), so try a gel which weighs it down less."

There are lots of options out there to try out I've been  loving the kinky curly products (found at target or online) I use the knot today leave in with the curling custard.

I fill my hand with it and lather it all over my hair.  Roots to tips.  Then I do my other shower stuff, and before I rinse it out I comb through my hair to remove the handful or so of loose hairs hanging out. -L'Oreal EverCurl Hydracharge Conditioner:  After the Suave, I use this conditioner on the lower half of my hair.  Let it soak for a minute or so, then rinse just a bit out.  Not fully, I leave a lot of it in my hair.  This is waxy and I think this step is the key to my separated curls.  I wasn't happy with my hair at all until I tried this!    Post shower:  -I wring out as much water as possible with my hands, then turn my head over and scrunch in LA Looks Mega Mega hair gel in the ends, and L'Oreal Everstyle Curl Activating Mousse in the roots.  Then I plop in a microfiber shirt for awhile (at least 30 min, but if I can do it for a couple hours the curls look that much better). -After plopping, I usually go to bed, and I'll put my wet hair up in a pineapple until I get up. -In the morning, I scrunch out the gel and then follow with Fekkai Brillant Glossing Styling Cream.  I also keep a little tube of this in my purse, it revives my curls during the day and also helps keep them separated."

Not shampooing everyday is only okay if you're using products that are okay with that method!  I'd suggest keeping your hair soaking wet when adding product.  Then squeezing out the water and product with your hair/t shirt.  Then plopping/wrapping if needed!  That's helped me :)"

curlyhair,39igb3,TunicSongForKaren,2,Thu Jun 11 23:01:23 2015 UTC,Refresher sprays might help :) if smell is all you're worried about maybe you can make your own with just water and some drops of a nice smelling essential oil.

It would work very well against sweat probably.  Which essential oil do you use?"
curlyhair,39igb3,CallipygianCannotLie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:23:22 2015 UTC,Maybe a dry shampoo will help :) I'm not sure of any good brands that are CG friendly but they're pretty helpful with oily roots and usually smell great!   I use a lavender essential oil because I just love the smell!

I am a true 2a, hair texture is fine but there is a lot of it, so I can get some body but days 2/3 start to look a little sketchy. Not all CG holy grails are working in my hair as it needs a certain lightness to have any curl whatsoever. I'm okay with there being a bit of uneven texture and that kinda grungey worn in hair look, but after day 2 it starts to hang and look gross.   Are there refresher sprays that won't just weigh down my hair with more oils? I want something that will revive a bit of the wave and possibly even help with body.

I also have a lot of frizz that I believe is due to me straightening my hair 3x a week for 3 years with no protection. If I got a dry cut would my hair get affected that much even though I probably only have 2a curls? Would it help with the frizz I have around nearly every curl? Considering going to the curl ambassadors in Toronto for the $100 cut.

I've tried (once) applying a leave-in, then combing this through my soaking wet hair (I used about a quarter sized amount), plopped for a little while, then slept with it above my head (not plopped). It looked awesome, I got lots of compliments.   What I typically do, since I know it's consistent, is apply it the same way, then apply a curl enhancing gel (kinky curly curling custard) and a hard hold gel. I rake all of this through my hair (still soaking wet), scrunch, plop, and diffuse. I don't get frizz if I do this, it's awesome!  Yesterday I tried applying the leave-in, the AG recoil, and then diffusing. It didn't look great, but it didn't look terrible.   I have not tried just scrunching it in, but I have issues with halo frizz, and raking is helping."

curlyhair,39ftxt,moe-money,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"I just dyed my hair after starting the CG method so I'll tell you what I did! I took the night as an opportunity to do a deep treatment with coconut oil, which also made my hair behave while dying to the point where I didn't even have to touch it with a brush to separate it! I put in the dye (I use the john freida foam dye because I feel like i'd royally screw up regular dye and get patchy hair idk if that makes a difference to you). And then got in the shower, rinsed it all out, and did my normal CG routine which seemed to work really well!"
curlyhair,39ftxt,dcredditgirl,2,Fri Jun 12 19:24:02 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I use the foam too! Still managed to shoot some into the wall. :)

Unfortunately, I don't want to die so I have to wear a helmet when riding it. Does anyone have any experience with wearing a helmet and salvaging their hair at the end of their commute?

curlyhair,39ftxt,kaitlynx6,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"So I've started experimenting with the CG method and am super in need of a haircut. I've been browsing around for Devacut stylists but am somewhat hesitant to get one.. Might not be popular opinion here but although I love wearing my hair with its natural curls, I still like to straighten or curl it with a curling iron from time to time depending on the day. Does anyone else do this? Has anyone gotten a Devacut that wears their hair straight from time to time? Does the cut look totally weird once the hair is straightened?  I really want to get fab looking natural curls but am afraid of spending $100+ on a cut that will only look good when wearing it with natural curls. Anyone have any input on this?"

(he could have been lying, i asked about it because i don't live near a devchan, just happened to be near one recently). he felt that some stylists don't do it often enough to do it well."

curlyhair,39ftxt,hashtagphag,4,Fri Jun 12 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all gels leave your hair crunchy. After your hair is dry, you ""scrunch out the crunch""... that releases the hard cast of the gel, while still maintaining the control the gel gives your hair.    Or do you mean that the gels you've been trying are leaving your hair feeling dry, brittle, and/or coated even after scrunching?"
curlyhair,39ftxt,Noraart,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:42:01 2015 UTC,Second this!  Make sure it's completely dry before a final scrunch.

My question is that I normally have to tie up my hair as it is extremely thick, and I've resorted to using satin ribbons instead of bobbins as I heard they are less damaging to your hair (plus, they look absolutely adorable!) is that true?   Also, I can only ever get a hairbrush through my hair when it is straight out of the shower as it is so thick, is this damaging my hair to brush it then or is there any way I can make it easier to brush when dry? I only brush my hair when I get out of the shower, which is every 2/3 days."
curlyhair,39ftxt,kallimabutterfly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure about bobbins, but satin ribbons won't damage your hair.  Brushing your hair dry can cause frizz and breakage, so it's best to detangle while your hair is wet. Many people on this sub detangle with their fingers or a wide-toothed comb in the shower with conditioner in their hair."
curlyhair,39ftxt,nosniboD,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:28:35 2015 UTC,"Will CG work for me? http://i.imgur.com/bm3WXCU.jpg I always assumed it was meant for longer, at least below the shoulder hair. My current regimen is wash every day (sometimes, sometimes every other day, with water,) shampoo every 3rd day, use a curl cream thing (a Lee Stafford one,) scrunch a little and try to air dry. It very rarely ends up looking as 'good' as that picture, not least because I usually have to leave for work before it's fully dry and the wind absolutely destroys any style I had been going for.    It used to look like this, about 6 years ago http://i.imgur.com/ErgFp4S.jpg, and my routine was pretty much the same - my hair was less forgiving in the morning so it was definitely every day that it got rinsed, and I didn't use any after care products on it, and I towelled it dry to fuck. No scrunching, just towelled until slightly damp.    Why was it so much nicer then than now? The way it was cut? I used to sail regularly so it got plenty of salt, was that a factor? Does the sun have much influence on it? Looking back, I was obviously catching way more rays back then and it's kind of annoying that I can't do that so much anymore.    Edit: I should probably clarify that if I can't get my hair in check then I'm getting it cut and going for a different style. I know this is lots of questions, but any recommendations? For hair type/face type whatever. I've tried malehairadvice but they're pretty quiet"
curlyhair,39ftxt,ImaCheeseMonkey,3,Mon Jun 15 10:07:31 2015 UTC,"Saltwater can make hair much curlier, yes. If you want to replicate that feeling, make yourself a ""seasalt"" spray with epsom salts and water. Be careful- this can be drying to your hair if you do it every day.    Yes, CG works for all lengths. I think with a little more conditioning, your hair would look fantastic!"

curlyhair,39ftxt,hashtagno,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"What type of styling products do you use? I honestly think that experimenting with different mousses and gels would be your best bet, but in my opinion gel is better for thicker hair because it gives more of a hold for me!   Typically, if your hair is crunchy and hard after using gel, you're supposed to sorta scrunch/shake the hard coating out and I normally just super lightly run my fingers through it and that works pretty well."
curlyhair,39ftxt,daintydoe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"I use a Redken Outshine 01 dupe that I found at Target (it seriously even smells the exact same), SheaMoisture's Curl Enhancing Smoothie, and then a Marc Anthony Detangler to keep from knotting up so badly. In that order. Needless to say my hair is quite shiny! I'll be running out of the first two shortly, though, and want to switch to something CG approved and that would make more sense than having three leave-in conditioners in my hair ;) Thank you for the tip!

I wash my hair 2 times a week max and my hair, I think, looks pretty good the day I wash it but the next day it's super tangled and gross looking. That, plus my hair is so long and thick I always end up just putting it into a loose bun. And here's the part where I'm sure you guys will kick me but I always feel the need to brush my hair before I put it into a bun. My hair looks better in a bun if I brush it but when I do that obviously it looks like a frizzy mess down. So begins a never ending cycle of wash hair, hair looks good, next day hair looks gross, brush hair, put in bun, repeat for a few days until I wash my hair again. Do you guys put your hair up before bed? What products keep your curls looking good? Ect? I'm so clueless as to what to do with my hair. Help a newbie out?   Also, sorry for the wall of text, I'm at work on my phone right now.   Thanks in advance for any help!"

But it definitely was an improvement! So that's nice at least :)   Also, the way I do a bun is wrap my hair tie around twice and then on the third time I do a half loop, if that makes sense? Maybe I just need to find better buns haha. I am totally and completely oblivious when it comes to hair, as you can probably tell!"
curlyhair,39ftxt,SelfConsciousBunny,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:37:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, that certainly makes a difference! Um, maybe you could try to, instead of making the pineapple in the form of a ponytail, you can not pull all your hair through the scrunchie/hair tie, and make it into a kind of bun (did that made sense?), it should work better. There is a youtuber who does that, her channel is curlypenny if you want to take a look, she has many other good videos.  But you also could try something which I saw quite some time ago in this sub, it was a girl with very long hair and she got a long sock, cut a hole in it and put her hair inside to protect all of it. Sadly I don't remember much about it, but you could try the search bar and see if you can find it.  I think I got it. I usually use bobby pins to do a bun, just kinda roll my hair into the bun shape and pin it all down, but lately I've been using spin pins, they're great. I'm learning too, I haven't exactly got the hang of all of this yet, I know it's not easy!"

Routine for those of you who want it: Wash with Ogx biotin and collagen shampoo. Condition the ever living shit out of it with Suave Naturals Ocean Breeze conditioner and twist it up for a few minutes, s2c (once a week I use ShaeMoisture Restorative Conditioner). Get out, plop for a few minutes while I brush my teeth and put in my eyeballs, unplop and scrunch 2-3 pumps of L'oreal Paris EverCurl Sculpting Gel and then a quarter of LA Looks Styling Gel (the yellow stuff), maybe a pump of the Shae Moisture stuff if I'm feeling fancy.

curlyhair,39d3qn,downtown_gal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:27:55 2015 UTC,I find that the blowdrying gives it a bit of lift at the roots. I always do it upside down. Otherwise the weight of my hair flattens it and I get weird stretched curls on top and nice ringlets further down. The biggest tip for reducing frizz is to touch it as little as humanly possible! My mom has this same hair but keeps it quite short. She wraps it in a tshirt in spite of that. The cotton material is just less disruptive to the curl pattern so you should still be able to do it.

I experimented with just dabbing with a towel for an air dry after my shower instead of rubbing and brushing and I found out there was still curly hair underneath it all!

curlyhair,39aivt,suite-dee,6,Wed Jun 10 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Here's my routine, copy/pasted from a previous post I made.  Products   SheaMoisture's Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Shampoo Suave Naturals conditioner Aussie Instant Freeze Sculpting Gel   Routine   In the shower before going to bed, I lather my whole hair in the shampoo, paying special attention to my roots and scalp. Wash out shampoo. Lather my hair (excluding my roots) in the conditioner. I mean, I just pour it on. I use A TON, and since I only wash my hair once a week, it never feels like I'm constantly buying more. De-tangle hair with fingers and remove excess hair that's totally falling out at this point. Sometimes I start the de-tangling process with the shampoo, but I don't think it makes much of a difference either way. Leave the conditioner in and do other shower fun stuff. When ready, flip hair over and comb through it with fingers again, and add even more conditioner. Squish hair a bit to encourage natural curl, then squish to condish! My secret is I don't actually wait until it stops dripping. My back/neck can't handle that position very long, so I do it long enough to feel like my curls are in a good place and aren't totally soaked. Leave shower still bent over, and sqiush about a 50 cent piece's worth of gel. I think this is one of the most important parts. Do NOT be afraid to use a lot of gel, because you will squish out the gross-looking cast in the morning. Once I started using more gel, my curls started looking SO much more sculpted and healthy and bouncy and all-around more lovely. Plop for as long as I can before I need to sleep. This can be between 30 minutes and two hours. I haven't noticed a significant difference with timing. Once ready for bed, I flip my head over, take out the plop, then gently fan my hair out behind my head on the pillow and sleep. In the morning, I flip that hair over again and squish out the icky gel cast, and voila! Healthy happy curls!   That's my whole routine! Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll be happy to answer. <3"

I'd know that I have the rest of my life to rectify my anti-curl habits.   I'll also add that one thing that helped me was to make sure everything was SUPER rinsed out of my hair. Like, way way way more than ""traditional"" conditioner. Good luck!"
curlyhair,39d4m5,richinsunnyhours,3,Thu Jun 11 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"Did you clarify (sulfate shampoo) prior to using the new CG shampoo/conditioner? You might be looking lank and greasy because the silicones are still on your hair. Or, the coconut oil may be doing you an injustice... it's meant to help seal in moisture that's already there, not necessarily add more. Most curlies use it to seal their ends after applying products (usually type 3 and 4), or they leave it in their hair overnight and shampoo it out the next day.   My hair is fine also, and doesn't look lank and greasy on my cowash days, even when I first started CG. I use a lightweight and runny conditioner for my cowash, and make sure to really scrub it into my scalp before rinsing and applying my regular conditioners. Maybe the Everyday Coconut line is a little to heavy for your cowashing? I use VO5 (Strawberry Cream or Vanilla Mint only, the rest have 'cones). Others around here also recommend Tresemme Naturals and Suave Naturals. BTW, do you have bangs? I find that my bangs always look terrible on day 2, they soak up all the oil on my face. It's a necessity for me to shampoo them specifically, even if I'm cowashing the rest of my hair.   Worse comes to worse, yeah, just put it up for the interview. At least that will take one bit of stress away for the day - a messy bun, and done!"
curlyhair,39d4m5,hashtagphag,2,Thu Jun 11 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"I did not clarify- is there a good shampoo for that I can find in a drugstore or whatever? I don't have bangs. Also leave in moisture suggestions? I'm a little overwhelmed by all of the the stuff I have to learn, but I want to take good care of my hair! For a while the coconut oil was working for me- just a couple of drops, most of which my hands absorbed to help tame it, and I was using aveeno shampoo and conditioner, but I know my hair can look better."
curlyhair,39d4m5,hashtagphag,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can be super overwhelming when you're first searching for products!    For cheap drugstore shampoos, I'd recommend Suave or VO5 or Tresemme. Pretty much any of them will do since they have sulfates, and that will clear the 'cones out. I'm pretty sure Suave makes a ""gentle clarifying"" one also, in case you need to use it more than once.    Ahhh... leave-ins. I'm still trying to find something good AND affordable. I tried leaving some of my various shower conditioners in, but didn't get the results I want. DevaCurl B'Leave In was awesome, but my hair is too long to make it worthwhile (I had to use a ton, so I'd be buying it far too regularly). I'm using Giovanni Weightless right now and like it, but I'm not totally loving it - it's nice and light, but I suspect my hair needs something more moisturizing since it's so processed.   I'm gonna try Kinky Curly Knot Today next, although I'm a little afraid since the KCCC didn't play so nicely in my hair. Also MopTop Leave-In... separately of course. Eh, it's all a learning process."

curlyhair,39cok7,Hennydowntheroad,2,Wed Jun 10 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"Oils are occlusives, NOT humectants- meaning, they can only seal in existing moisture. Kind of like silicones. Basically, you're not actively moisturizing your hair at all, it just won't get any drier."
curlyhair,39cok7,unfunnypun,2,Wed Jun 10 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"And because oils are like silicones, they can actually lock out moisture when overused.  I would not use coconut oil more than once or twice a month."

When I shower I flip my head over and cowash with Aveda scalp benefits and then I squish more of it in my hair to condition it, rinsing out only a little. I grab a cotton shirt and wrap it around my head to keep my hair out of the way as I finish up the rest of my shower stuffs. When I get out of the shower I immediately let my hair down and rake it with my fingers to wherever I want my part to go, then I pour a decent amount of jojoba oil on my hands and rake that through my hair, mostly focusing on the ends. Then I scrunch in not your mother's plump for joy thickening hair lifter and LA looks extreme sport gel. I finger shape my curls, mainly the ones surrounding my face, I let them air dry 90% of the way and then I separate my curls and place them where they look good,  after that I blow dry my hair on medium heat and high and scrunch and stretch wherever is necessary for my hair to be whatever shape I want. I'm not the best curly girl, but my hair has never looked better and it has actually been behaving.  Also once a week I saturate my hair with coconut oil, leave it in for a few hours. To get it out I wash my roots with Aveda scalp benefits shampoo once and then I cowash with the conditioner. That's my attempt at a conditioning treatment haha."

curlyhair,395xov,psylentt,6,Tue Jun 9 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"Decided to splurge and try out Ouidad products. I've tried many other brands in the past, but this one has been my favorite so far. I was using Shea Moisture with Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls as my styling product, but I felt like I was having to use so much of the gel that it was becoming cost ineffective. I feel like Shea Moisture changed their formula on the conditioner I was using cause my hair was not feeling moisturized at all.   With Ouidad, I chose the curl quencher system for tight and dehydrated curls.   Wash: Curl Quencher Moisturizing Shampoo Condition: Curl Quencher Moisturizing Conditioner - let sit for 3 minutes, comb through with wide tooth comb.  Remove excess water Style: Curl Quencher Moisturizing Styling Gel - rake and shake with fingers Finish: Finishing Mist Setting & Holding Spray  Air dry   Pretty simple routine. I really like that the ""styling gel"" is not sticky and it's runnier than most gels, so I feel like I don't have to use as much product since I can disperse it better through my hair. I have very thick hair."
curlyhair,395xov,queenatstormsend,2,Tue Jun 9 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you said that about Shea Moisture -- after months of using one of their conditioners with the happiest hair ever, I bought a new bottle and my curls were suddenly miserable. I thought I was going mental. Your curls look incredible. I've never used ouidad products, but now I think I'd better give them a go!"

curlyhair,397tlh,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"I used Natural Instincts. I used to use Garnier permanent color, but switched to ammonia free to, hopefully, lessen the damage. My hair is very fine textured and highly porous even without coloring it. /r/curlyhair has taught me that i need to pile on the protein. I was afraid that Shea Moisture stuff would be too heavy for fine hair, but  my hair seems to love it. Once my hair is grown out to it's natural color, maybe i'll try Special Effects. Is it fairly gentle?    Just checked the color selection for Special Effects - purple smoke looks nice."
curlyhair,397tlh,nati691810,2,Thu Jun 11 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Oh hey! When I was dying at home, I used to use Natural Instincts too! *fistbump* My favorites were Rosewood, Malaysian Cherry, or Egyptian Plum.    Special Effects has been totally fine for me, but I have low-porosity hair and expect it will feel different post-dye. I leave it in for at least 2 hours when I do my touch-ups, and my hair is slightly dry the next day, but nothing that extra conditioner for a day or two can't fix. If your hair is high-porosity, it may react differently though. I've used Manic Panic and Pravana in the past as well, and found that those aren't as drying, but the color hasn't lasted as long. But again, low-porosity... my hair doesn't exactly embrace change =)   Shea Moisture is AWESOME, I'm loving them. I'm cycling through practically every single one of their deep conditioners right now, haha, and am experimenting with their shampoos and regular conditioners. I've  been using their Coconut/Hibiscus Smoothie as my styler, and even though it's geared towards thick hair, I feel like it's been really great on my fine hair... plenty of bounce and shine, without weighing it down.    If your hair needs protein, I highly recommend Kerastase - you can't buy it in stores though, it's salon or online-only. I get it on Amazon for far less than the retail price. Anyway, I've tried various products over the years, but that brand has truly helped restore my locks after all the dying/bleaching/coloring. I've been using it for about a year, and my hair is sooooo much better. I literally just grabbed a strand and yanked the ends between my fingers... it didn't stretch, break, or feel gummy, a total 180 from this time last year. I'm using the Résistance Masque Force Architecte line because my hair has been super-processed for years, but I believe any of them will work great. If you try it, follow the directions to a tee... 10-20 minutes max. I left it on for an hour once, and totally over-proteined myself =/"

curlyhair,396g9w,ronniejean1,2,Thu Jun 11 13:41:45 2015 UTC,"I see you shampoo every day but you don't always follow with conditioner? Always use conditioner, especially because your hair looks so dry. Try to shampoo less - you can still take a shower and scrub your scalp, just don't strip it, or you can wash exclusively with your conditioner.   I think you would benefit from a serum and some gel to hold your overall look.  Like I said before, deep conditioning mask. You can use coconut or olive oil over night and shower in the morning to help with the dryness."
curlyhair,396g9w,unfunnypun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:49:56 2015 UTC,Oh. My friends told me not to use conditioner everyday because it will actually lead to dryness. I thought it wasnt also ok to just use conditioner.  Also I could use serum and gel together?
curlyhair,396g9w,vonlowe,2,Thu Jun 11 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"No, using shampoo every day leads to dryness. People on here cowash frequently, you should look the method up. Always use conditioner following shampoo.  I use an anti frizz serum and gel together. I generally just put the serum on my ends though but since your hair is short, you may want to stick to just gel and see how that works for you. Unfortunately, everyone's hair is different so it might take some trial and error to figure out what works best for your hair."
curlyhair,396g9w,unfunnypun,4,Thu Jun 11 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"Do a stretch test to see if your hair needs moisture or protein! Take a strand of shed hair, and pull on either end. Is it stretching forever? Weird, gooey, ew? You need protein, ASAP. Brittle, snaps quickly, hard, crunchy? You need moisture right away.   As a girl who grew out hair shorter than yours right now- deep breaths. It gets better. Luckily, you can slick back your hair if you need to and it'll look suave. I would probably look like a sad animal.   Also, a trim to shape it up a bit might ease the process."
curlyhair,396g9w,vonlowe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:41:53 2015 UTC,Does it mean anything if it doesn't stretch? Pulling pretty hard?

curlyhair,3979it,hellohaley,3,Tue Jun 9 19:36:56 2015 UTC,"Info: light wave to curly hair, depending on how I handle it or what area on the head. Extremely fine, dense, and porous hair. Anything I do to it either makes it look extremely dry and poufy or just down right grease-money.  I don't use shampoo or conditioner in the shower last night since they both have sulfates, and I used an apple cider vinegar rinse with cool water instead. After that I finger-combed in some argan oil and thermal protection in while it was dripping wet. I scrunched out some of the water and plopped with a tshirt for bed.  My issues are that it just looks greasy on my light hair color, and the curls around my face don't plop nicely. I don't know how to manage the grease out how to set the curls around my face. I also have a severe cowlick in the very front center of my forehead that further complicates things.  I don't really like my curly hair and prefer light waves or straight, but after trying to grow it out for years and making little pictures die to damage, I want to get it healthier. Is there a way to keep my hair healthy without going full curly grease monkey? Can I use leave in big rollers to get a smooth wave over night, or should I try other products to get rid of the grease?   Any help appreciated. I do not feel pretty at all right now. Didn't help that my boss was accidentally being pretty insulting  (""the curls are too tight and kinky, but I'll probably like it when it loosens up a bit. Normally it's flat and sticks to your head. This has more volume to it so it frames your long face better."" :<"
curlyhair,3979it,unfunnypun,3,Tue Jun 9 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was pretty rude/unprofessional on your boss' behalf. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. But anyway-  Your conditioner should not have sulfates. Also, if your hair is super fine, cowashing might weigh your hair down. Have you considered using a sulfate free shampoo, then conditioning?  Did you clarify prior to starting this? The greasiness could be a result of buildup. Additionally, your heat protectant most likely has silicones, which contribute to buildup.   Furthermore, plopping overnight is a feat most can't get quite right. I never could, I toss and turn too much. Plus, plopping too long gives me greasy roots and frizzy ends. Have you considered plopping for a shorter amount of time, and then diffusing/air drying?  If you're against going full-on curly, you could definitely try using large curlformers, or other heatless waving methods."
curlyhair,3979it,Lanalen,3,Tue Jun 9 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"In addition to these great advices, what do you think about maybe skipping the argan oil next time?  Perhaps it's a little bit too much for your hair, considering your new routine.  And why do you need thermal protection, since you don't seem to be using heat?"
curlyhair,3979it,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:48:03 2015 UTC,"Normally I do use heat, either a blowdryer or a flat iron. I hate my cowlick and random curls around my face and it's been the only way to keep my sanity and confidence up hair wise. So normally, I do use heat. I just didn't this one time I tried following CG advice.  And are you saying argan is too much for now while I transition or should I just return it all together?"

Unfortunately my mom had pin straight hair until her early 20s when it started to wave slightly but the trend back then was big hair so she got it permed and teased it to get that poodle thing that was popular, and after that she just straightens her hair. I had soft wavey hair then soft loose curls from a very young age and she never knew what to do with it, when it really started to curl as I got older I never knew its really state or texture because she would just brush it  out and thats what i learned and did for school or anything, brush it out and put it in a pony tail, by the time I was in highschool I assume it got even curlier because I could not longer do ""half up/ half down"" because brushing it no longer made it wavy and dry now it brushing it made it big and bushy a la princess diaries before  picture. Needless to say by 19 my hair was thin, brittle and damaged with lots of split ends, even though I only on occasion had it blown out and straightened at the salon. Then I started CG and was like wth? I have curly hair? Who new? I just thought I had a big bushy mess. Anyway I rambled. Your son's hair is adorable."
curlyhair,393p4a,MyOtherShadow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"My son and daughter both had curly hair as babies. They are both in grade school now and their hair is pin-straight. Mine was at their age too; it didn't become curly until I was in my teens, only I didn't know it was curly. I thought it was just a mess of frizz until my mom gave me the book Curly Girl and I changed my hair routine. Nice and curly now!  All this to say, his hair may change, and then change again."
curlyhair,393vm5,bluemo0n,2,Tue Jun 9 01:57:29 2015 UTC,"Your hair is gorgeous! What's your routine?   I'd say a solid 2b, but it might turn into a 2C if it's in need of moisture or protein."

curlyhair,396xh7,WhiteGirlBlackName,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"How dark is ""dark""? Are we talking dark blonde, or black here? Either way, I find the less you need to process the hair, the better. L'Oreal Excellence has a high-lift color that should take you to golden blonde, which you can then tone with something like Wella. The high volume of developer in the Excellence isn't the best for hair, but I would avoid bleach as much as you can. I would also consider Olaplex, but it is hella pricy, so it probably won't fit your budget."
curlyhair,396xh7,unfunnypun,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"I would say it's a little darker than dark-blonde. Maybe medium brunette. And my curls are loose, and vary in size. Length is bottom of shoulder blades.  What is Wella?   Thank you for your recommendations!"

curlyhair,393joo,tvvat_waffle,9,Tue Jun 9 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"Get a good heat protector. Go in with dry hair, a couple days out of washing - right after you wash and you'll wind up with crazy frizz / too long after washing and it'll be greasy and sticky. I usually go with 3 or 4 days.   Have someone help you, like a roommate or sibling, maybe who straightens their hair so they kinda have more experience. Pin it all up on top of your head (the GIANT octopus type clips are great) and go slowly, section by section.   When you're done with the straightness, do a hair masque treatment. I like coconut oil or the Shea moisture green tub stuff.   My curls tend to be extra springy after a day or two of straight. Have fun running your fingers through your hair the entire time it's straight!"
curlyhair,393joo,hazelnox,2,Tue Jun 9 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great advice! I have just regular coconut oil (in it's pure form). Do you think I could put some on my tips after straightening? Also, would you recommend that I have my normal products in my hair before straightening (ex: washing and styling my hair as I normally do, and then waiting two days and straightening it)?  I'm kind of excited to see how long it is :3"
curlyhair,393joo,hazelnox,3,Tue Jun 9 02:13:45 2015 UTC,"I'd advise against oiling it up after straightening, as ANY moisture will have it curl back up. Style with a paste, if you have some. Garnier has a good natural styling paste that I love!   My routine involves daily showers, so the day of straightening, I do my normal conditioner stuff, and put in de-frizz serum and stuff, just not any of the curl enhancers. The curls still look good, not as great, but it's just a day. Then I straighten from there!  Not sure if it's allowed here, but I'd be super curious to see your curly vs straight! It's always so interesting :) good luck!"
curlyhair,393joo,MyOtherShadow,2,Tue Jun 9 04:15:39 2015 UTC,I agree don't add oil. My hairdresser used just a bit of hairspray afterward and that started to turn it back.

I know I'm not going to destroy my hair, but my ends tend to get really frizzy because of my tight curls and Missouri weather."
curlyhair,393joo,APsychedelicMermaid,5,Tue Jun 9 23:12:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, straightening your hair once in awhile won't ruin your hair. I generally straighten mine once every couple of months when I'm feeling bored with my waves. I just shower the night before and put in some frizz serum then let it air dry. Then I'll pin it up in sections and go in with heat protectant spray (mine has some cones in it but it was expensive so I'm not throwing it out) and I straighten it and put some three day straight in it and it lasts a few days looking perfect. Then I wash my hair with a regular shampoo to wash out the cones, deep condition, and continue with my CG method. My waves don't look any different the day after washing with the regular shampoo, I just don't make it a habit."
curlyhair,393joo,curlsandcollege,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:23:53 2015 UTC,I mostly just worry about my ends- they're still a little damaged from bleaching it  3 years ago.
curlyhair,393joo,MyOtherShadow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:20:47 2015 UTC,Often times when I'm in for the night I'll just stick coconut oil on my ends for a few hours before I shower. It keeps my ends well hydrated.
curlyhair,393joo,Noraart,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:44:33 2015 UTC,I coconut oil my hair once a week :) it helped me finally get touchably soft curls!
curlyhair,393joo,Curly_Alice,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:23:20 2015 UTC,I agree.  I actually straighten my hair once or twice a month and it hasnt really messed up my hair.  I think its when you start straightening every few days that it becomes a real problem.  But everyone's hair is different.  You likely won't get much damage from one straighten.  Just deep condition afterwards.
curlyhair,393joo,bccdeff,5,Thu Jun 11 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, not sure if it's an option but going to a professional usually costs about $20, and it will save you so much stress. Go in pre-washed and wet (to avoid them using a super harsh sulfate shampoo) and just let a pro do it.   I occasionally home straighten and this is my routine. Be warned, there's a lot of silicone, because that's what keeps it straight:   If I want it to be straight for several days I wash with a gentle low-sulfate day-of to prolong the time before I'd need to wash it.   HEAT PROTECTOR. It's must be silicone.  Straightening balm of some kind (I use John Freida Three Day Straight). Silicone up the wazoo   Then blow-dry straight (if you have a more experienced friend let them do it). It probably won't be anything resembling straight from blow drying.   Flat iron it piece by piece, starting from the bottom layers and moving up.   Eventually you'll want to go curly again (woo!). Wash with a full on sulfate shampoo to get out all of the silicone.  Then condition.  Then deep condition after the shower. Then expect a few days of frizzy dry-ness and a short adjustment period back into a curly girl sulfate/silicone free routine. It usually takes about a week until my hair isn't frizzy."
curlyhair,393joo,acertaingestault,2,Tue Jun 9 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"I also agree with this advice, usually I'm really busy and don't have a choice about this. But from now on I won't have them wash my hair. There are no curly specific salons where I am, so I just go to who Ive found does the best at straightening. One thing they do not know how to do in addition to washing is how to detangle your hair and will just start brushing through it so crazy, Ive had to try so many different places. Once before I went CG and knew more about my hair, this lady when her method of blow drying wasn't working whipped out some kind of comb/flat iron combo and proceeded to rip and burn my hair into submission that didnt work so she sprayed this awful smelling olive oil spray in it and fryed my hair with a iron heavy flat iron. When my hair was shredded and ripped and edges brutalized and burned but straight she smiled looking so proud and everyone in the salon was like oooh and ahhh. It looks so nice now. I was furious, but I was young and afraid to speak up. Never again, I don't care how rude I come off- I will tell you how to do your job if you don't know how to yourself. It was that day that I went home did research and discovered curly girl method. I feel like we need a hairdresser horror story thread. This was not the place, lol sry."
curlyhair,393joo,acertaingestault,2,Tue Jun 9 18:08:05 2015 UTC,I seriously haven't been to a hair dresser since I was twelve. I am way to scared to even go back for a cut since they butchered my hair. We should have a Horror Story Day every week or something. I bet there's loads to tell!

curlyhair,393joo,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 9 16:20:33 2015 UTC,"My roommate (who has worn her hair curly pretty much her entire life) said to wash your hair and put product in it as you normally would (except without gel or curl creme or anything to define your curls) and DON'T BRUSH IT. Just comb through it with a wide-toothed comb. Use a ton of heat protectant and let it air dry before you straighten it, combing through occasionally as it dries. Even after you straighten it, use the comb instead of a brush.  I'm recently transitioning out of straightening my hair all the time into wearing it in its natural state, so I can't attest to this method, but it seems to work really well for her!"

curlyhair,3942fa,SarahWantsHam,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"as you use the CG method more and more you'll be able to feel out your routine - everyone's is a little different and almost everyone has really specific quirks that their hair needs, unique to their own head of hair.   One thing I want to point out that I noticed, is that the low-poo you got is going to be more drying than the no-poo. So if your hair is dry I would ease up on how often you use it. Personally I find I can cowashing just as well with a cheap bottle of suave clarifying conditioner from the dollar store as most expensive cleansing conditioners.   To address your questions   1) I try to only wash my hair when it has build up, looks bad, is frizzy or dry, or if my scalp is itchy. If it looks and feels fine I leave it alone. On days I don't wash it I just put it up in a clip so it won't get too wet. also when I say wash, I generally mean cowashing as I try to only shampoo once every couple of weeks.   2) you can find most oils like that in health food stores. Sometimes dedicated beauty supply stores (as opposed to pharmacies) will have them. Just check the ingredients to make sure it's pure oil. For coconut oil you'll find it in grocery stores along with other oils. It should be solid and melts when you heat  it up.  3) diffusing might help in that it will dry your hair faster, so there's less time for them to be weighed down (which is what flattens the roots). Other methods include clipping your roots as they dry so they have volume, pineappling you hair on top of your head, and plopping.   3) For me devacuts are definitely worth the peace of mind of knowing my hair will be cut correctly. I pay about a hundred for a cut, which is pricey but then I only get it cut once a year."
curlyhair,3942fa,empress-of-blandings,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:06:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I definitely don't wash to over wash and dry out my hair. I didn't realize before reading about the curly girl method that curls are so prone to dryness. Before when I was using normal shampoo and conditioner, I felt like my hair looked oily & weighed down a lot, but I think that was the silicones building up. And the ends were always so dry & frizzy. It's definitely looking better, even after 2 weeks! I'll probably try to limit using the low-poo to just like 2 times a week."
curlyhair,3942fa,weelittlesailor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of curls! I will try and answer your questions as best I can:  Days that I don't wash my hair (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday), I put my hair up in a high pony tail and use bobby pins to keep the shorter ends underneath in place.  I can't use any coconut/jojoba/olive oils in my hair because they ALL will make my hair greasy and nasty.  As for your sporatic frizz days, well, I think that's part of the struggle! You might want to play around with some different products. While DevaCurl products are great, they never worked well for me. After some trial and error, I now use the SheaMoisture co-wash with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle S2C. Then I style with about a malt-ball sized glob of Carol's Daughter Hair Milk and plop for 30 minutes, and air dry after, doing my best to NOT TOUCH MY HAIR WHILE IT IS DRYING! It may look like it's going to frizz and have no definition and I might be tempted to load up on product, but if I power through the temptation I am rewarded with absolutely perfect curls. If you need a little extra shine once your hair is dry, I love Carol's Daughter Sacre Tiare serum.  As for the DevaCut, if you read Larraine Massey's book, she teaches you the basics if you ever feel so bold and want to try it yourself. I have been trimming my hair this way for about six months. Once your hair is dry and you can piece out your curls, hold them out one by one. If the ends look frayed and thin, trim that curl right on the bend of the last curl on that piece.  It's a difficult and rewarding process and I'm happy you've joined our ranks!"
curlyhair,3942fa,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 9 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the advice and for telling me which products you use. It's always nice to hear what's worked well for people. I haven't read the book yet, but I likely will soon. I'm glad to be here! :)"
curlyhair,3942fa,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"My answers are a tad different than the others so far, but I'm a fine 2C/3A also =)    1) I can't get 2nd day curls to save my life. I wash every day. 3x a week I use Shea Moisture shampoo (I have oily skin, which transfers to my hair), and the other days I cowash with VO5. That means I'm styling my hair every single day.   2) I've found the occasional pure oils online, and usually 100% coconut oil in just about any store. But more commonly, I find them in dedicated health food/organic stores. NOTE: Whole Foods is ""natural"", not ""organic"". They have good stuff, but be sure to read your labels.   3) For me, diffusing does 1 of 2 things. It either frizzes and splits my hair into strings, or gives me great volume but takes forever to get there (at least an hour). I think the difference depends on which products I've applied prior to diffusing. I find that heavier products work better for curl clumping and bounciness, despite seeming like they would work against it. My hair is damaged though, so maybe that's why - I need something stronger. I don't believe the brand of diffuser matters, it's just an attachment you add to your hair dryer. If it fits, it works. People recommend lower heat or the cool setting, if possible.    4) Haven't had a DevaCut yet, but am considering it since my regular stylist is out of commission for the next few months. When I was non-CG, I had both cheap cuts and expensive cuts... the cheap cuts weren't ever worth it. I'd rather pay more for someone trained in a specific method who coordinates the whole experience with me, than go home and have my clumsy partner try to fix up my terrible layers with whatever scissors we have laying around."
curlyhair,393bod,badamoop_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"Do you use any products at all? Some gel or even just a leave in conditioner might help to tame the frizz.  I think my hair definitely looks better when it's damp than after it's dry, but I use LA Sports gel and it looks so much better than when I use no products after I shower. It really helps to define my curls, rather than have all the individual hairs trying to curl by themselves.   EDIT: LA Looks Extreme Sports gel. Sorry, I was a little tired yesterday and I guess I forgot half the product name."

Sorry for all the questions!"
curlyhair,393bod,PlayGoFish,4,Tue Jun 9 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"We have similar routines.  I had an issue with 'crunchy/wet' gel hair too but I've kinda figured it out.  Right out of the shower I flip my head over and run gel through my hair, scrunching it as I go.  I also use a tiny bit of moroccan oil to help the frizz issue.  Plop, let air dry.  Then to get rid of the crunch, once it's completely dry, I flip my head again and do the whole scrunching thing again until the crunchiness is out.  You must wait until it's totally dry, otherwise it gets frizzy.  Good luck!"
curlyhair,393bod,PlayGoFish,2,Tue Jun 9 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"thank you! i will definitely try that tonight.  one more question....  my hair is basically straight when wet/out of the shower though.  it doesn't curl until i plop.  (and if i don't plop, it doesn't curl at all.. just frizzes).  should i put gel before i plop when it's really wet (still straight)?  or should i wait until after i plop (and the curls form)?"
curlyhair,393bod,PlayGoFish,3,Tue Jun 9 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"Forgive me, might be kinda long, I'm in a talkative mood but I hope it helps some. :)  I totally hear you.  My hair is in between wavy and curly and if I do nothing it all it's just a weird frizz thing on top and cute curlies on bottom (my hair is 2 types of curls, it's frustrating).  Here's my routine:  shampoo once/twice a week with sulfate free shampoo.  I condition every night (I've tried a few, the Tressemee Naturals works well).  When I don't shampoo I (cowash) and take extra time to rub the conditioner into my scalp with the palms of my fingers for a long time.  I also use a very wide toothed comb and comb it with conditioner in.  Rinse completely.  My hair is super thin, I just have a lot of it which is why I don't use the S2C method as leaving that stuff in weighs it down.  Immediately after shower I gently towel dry (going to buy a microfiber soon) but no matter what I use, it's gentle gentle gentle.  I then (and this goes against a lot of folks here but for those of us with just 2 A/B wavy/some curl I find it useful) comb it with that large tooth comb again.  This helps get all the product get distributed evenly, IMO.  Touch of moroccan oil and about a quarter of gel on wet hands.  Flip my head.  Run my fingers through the underside of my hair, scrunching once I'm sure product is in.  Take a tiny bit of oil, a quarter size of gel on wet hands (head still flipped) and run it through the front, scrunching once product is in.  Now flip head back to normal.  Quarter size gel, scrunch up the back real good.  Quarter size gel, scrunch up the top and sides, maybe doing that one more time if I feel like it needs a bit more.  Depending on gel brand and mood I leave alone, or if I have time, plop for a while and then let air dry.   When it's completely dry I flip my head over and ""scrunch the crunch"" out.  Few things:  Sometimes when I scrunch I use my hands, sometimes a soft tshirt.  I do it pretty hardcare though, I mean, I scrunch the hell out of it.  Also, try different gels.  DevaCurl B'Leave'In is great for me.  It gives me a bit more natural look but not as curly.  The Jessicurl products are awesome and if I do my normal routine can make my hair SUPER CURLY (like 3A curls), but the crunch just never fully gets out which is frustrating.  So depends on my mood on what I want to look like.  I've had some of those famous ""second day curls"" and the trick is to spritz your hair with water and scrunch it all up again.  I don't do that much though, because I work late and sometimes it will eventually start to look heavy.  No matter what look you're going for, I think the key is flip/scrunch the hell out of it let it do it's thing.  Next is to try the product the gel that works best for you.  Hope this was informative.  Cheers!"

curlyhair,393bod,PlayGoFish,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:31:59 2015 UTC,"/u/PlayGoFish pretty much answered your question. One of the things I noticed that helped to keep gelled hair look and feel normal is if you apply it when it's really wet, then it distributes better and you can kinda scrunch/squeeze/plop out the water with some extra gel if you've used too much. And for some reason plopping seems to make gel less crunchy, if you apply the gel to wet hair before plopping."

Squeeze moisture out with my hands, apply products, then plop for an hour with a T-shirt. Where we vary is that I squeeze extra moisture out with the T-shirt post-plop instead of pre-plop. I tried micro-fiber towels  a couple of times instead of a T-shirt, but they actually took out TOO MUCH moisture. Maybe they were even too rough... my hair was noticeably frizzy post-plop, even while wet.   I clip up my hair at the roots and air-dry also - luckily, my work is OK with me coming in with wet hair. It takes about 2 hours for my hair to dry fully so I can scrunch. The amount of clips I use varies each day depending on how well my curls have clumped... sometimes it's 4, sometimes it's 10. Since my hair is fine and thin, I use pin-curl clips instead of the larger duckbills."
curlyhair,3921tu,hashtagphag,2,Mon Jun 8 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"I'll be trying the moisture squeeze post plop! I started using T-shirts because I was too lazy to look for/buy a special towel, but honestly I'm totally happy with a T-shirt!"
curlyhair,3921tu,suite-dee,2,Mon Jun 8 20:48:26 2015 UTC,I'm switching to tshirts because I'm so bad at twisting my microfiber towel haha. Tshirts are much more pliable and reliable.
curlyhair,3921tu,hashtagphag,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"With the pin-curl clips do you use them normally, right at the roots? or do you do any extra twists/curls with them?"
curlyhair,3921tu,suite-dee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"If I try to clip using the conventional ""at the roots"" method, it pulls my curls apart either during the process itself, or when I try to remove them (they snag no matter how careful I am). I think that method probably works well for curlies with shorter hair, or thicker hair... but I've got neither. Seems like just about everything ""pulls my curls apart"" =/    I don't create extra twists/curls, although now that you mention it, I may give it a shot tomorrow and see what happens =)  What I do is basically pinch a couple curl clumps together, an inch or two down the strands, then I lift them up and out and bring my fingers in to my scalp. Then I pin where my fingers meet my head. This allows me to strategically re-arrange where they're going to fall once dry - cover my cowlick, blend in the growing-out bangs, etc - as well as ensuring the curls at my crown don't pull out so much from the weight of my wet hair."
curlyhair,3921tu,unfunnypun,2,Mon Jun 8 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"I squeeze the moisture out with my hands first, then a T-shirt. It's still pretty drippy, so I plop for an hour with that same T-shirt...you can try using a dry one instead. Then I take my plop out. My hair is still very wet, but it's not dripping. I air dry it after, it takes a few hours at least.   My hair dries much faster during the day than overnight. Maybe try drying it outside if it's nice and not too hot, or else your scalp will sweat. I have a diffuser, but I don't use it often."
curlyhair,3921tu,BabyFlower,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:02:08 2015 UTC,"After squishing out the conditioner in the shower (well, most of it), I scrunch in my gel (currently using Olive Oil Ecostyler). Then, I use a cotton tshirt to scrunch out most of the water. My hair is around chin length, so plopping is very hit or miss for me. I've found scrunching with the shirt gives me more bouncy, reliable results. Then, I diffuse until about 80-90% dry (my hair takes forever to dry, so I diffuse as much as possible). I imagine that if my hair was thinner, the tshirt method would work alone. Honestly, it might work for me now, I just haven't experimented with it (saving time)."

curlyhair,38ytgw,janetplanet,3,Mon Jun 8 14:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you. I really just hate it when I'm called adorable when I'm trying to be another adjective. Like being called adorable for a job interview is kind of insulting."

A lot of places aren't allowed to use products that they don't sell in the store, so that might be an issue with bringing your own. I would say that it's best to talk to them and explore what products they have available that could work or be the least damaging."
curlyhair,3923hx,bccdeff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"Most places don't allow outside products. Your best option would be to go without the conditioner and go home and use your own products.

curlyhair,392mku,CurlyDuder,3,Mon Jun 8 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"If you like your hair the most during the drying stage, I'd recommend looking for cremes as your styling product. In my experience, gels and mousses tend to scrunch out more lightweight and with less control, while cremes scrunch out a little heavier, but with more shine. I'm currently using Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie and really like it. It's targeted towards thick curlies as well.   Gels/cremes/mousse are different than leave-ins... those are stylers. Leave-ins are conditioners to help moisturize your hair, and should be applied prior to the stylers. Your hair doesn't look super-dry, so you could likely get away with using a lightweight leave-in, with a heavier/more controlled styler."
curlyhair,38zx7w,Kman3291,2,Mon Jun 8 06:06:57 2015 UTC,You could try Curls passion fruit control paste.  It is available at Target.

I leave the conditioner in, although some will have disappeared with the water as it got squeezed. Then I add some curl creme and styling milk, and throw it in an overnight plop. Voila!"

When I was in high school I never ever wore it curly, I straightened it all the time.   That and dying it, when I finally decided I wanted my curls back, my hair wouldn't cooperate. It's utterly depressing too because I went from perfect curls (if I took care of them, soft ringlets) to wavyish poof.

If you keep you hair short, it might not be a problem, but if you have longer hair you might have to find a way to add or keep moisture in there.   I recommend using the boar-hair-type bristle brush every night to distribute the oils. Are you planning to wash daily? I found that brushing at nigh made my hair healthier and shinier in the morning, and not greasy."

I do wash daily usually, but at night - I exercise a lot and usually in the afternoons after work so I get my whole head sweaty... so the problem I am encountering is that before my shower my hair is already all sweaty and therefore wet (and it's way hard to brush wet or damp hair). I guess I could wait for my hair to dry, and then brush, and then shower...  Curly_Alice does your hair frizz all to hell when you brush at night, and then you reset your curls with a shower?

So lately I've just been leaving them curly and pinning them to the side, or on top of my head. I find leaving them curly and pinning it actually looks good, since the curls give it a more textured look.

Like others have said, I twist mine back or to the side, sometimes I french braid them to the side as well.  Now that they're long enough though, when it's still wet/has styling product, I use clips to place the curly bangs to the side, usually they just dry in place and stay put after I take the clips out, maybe it'd work for you?   Another thing I used to do, so they weren't crazy curly, was straighten them and then use my flat iron/curling iron to incorporate a bit of wave, so it blended into the rest of my hair."

Some people get amazing curls with silicones and sulfates, and a lot of people modify the CG method to better suit their needs and curls.

curlyhair,38se5y,unfunnypun,3,Sat Jun 6 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"She does great with what she has and does seem to occasionally wear it curly as Prenomen pointed out, so odds are good she may already know about CG method but it might not mesh with her current routine. So, I'm with you... there's no need for an intervention for the lady in the video. Maybe for OP though, trying to rally strangers to bombard someone else to their way of thinking. Seems heavy-handed to antagonize someone because they wear their hair a certain way. :/"

curlyhair,38u5t5,owlvsdove,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"I get really sweaty in my workouts too and I only co wash after them.  I do shampoo with a CG friendly shampoo once, sometimes twice a week, but I think I could get away without it.  You just have to be sure to really scrub your entire scalp with the pads of your fingers, then add a little more of your co wash conditioner and then scrub out towards your ends.  And when you're rinsing, keep scrubbing with your finger pads.  You will not only be able to feel when your co wash is out, but you're also working out as much of that as possible so none of that sweat is sticking around.  You want to be sure to rinse out your co wash conditioner completely, just like you would with shampoo."
curlyhair,38u5t5,owlvsdove,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:26:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! Hmm maybe it's a problem with the way I co-wash then - I probably don't scrub out the conditioner as much as I should. Do you leave the co-wash in for a couple of minutes (like you would with conditioner in the rest of your hair)? Or do you scrub it in and wash it out right away, like with shampoo?"

So much for posting in a tiny little safe community.... Blerg.  Routine:  1) Let your depression consume you. Never leave the house. Never bathe. Lie in your bed and watch all of Criminal Minds for some reason even though it makes you feel worse.  2) Decide it's probably time to shower. Realize your hair is a rat's nest and it would take way too much energy to wash it. Shower, but give up on washing hair.  3) Undo hair from weird permabun and spray with water. Detangle with Ouidad Double Detangler Brush and cry over clumps of hair that come out while chiding yourself that you aren't doing this in the proper CG way (to wet, conditioner-filled hair in the shower).   4) Spray hair with water again. Rub coconut oil into hands and rub them into your gross and crispy split ends. Twist hair into a bun at the very top of your head and secure it with an elastic. Go back to bed for 1-5 days.  5) Decide it's probably time to leave the house because you are dangerously close to becoming a mole person. Smell your pits and decide you don't stink enough to shower, because you don't exercise ever anyway and it hasn't been hot out for some reason. Yell at yourself to put on a full face, but compromise with yourself that eyeliner, mascara and lipstick is enough.  6) Undo hair from bun in step 4. Brush out bangs. Wonder how you managed to look like a human being. Post results to internet.  Thanks, internet."
curlyhair,38oqnc,HMS_Pathicus,54,Fri Jun 5 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"OK, I have to tell you this. Part of your routine is shitty, because depression is a bitch. But the ""actually taking care of your hair"" bit is clearly amazing.  Just so you know, we shed hair all the time. If you keep your hair up for a week, a week's worth of shedded hair will stay there, tangled, until you wash it or brush it out. So don't worry about it.  And finally, I believe several people have found /r/makeupaddiction to be effective at motivating them to feel good and leave the house. You clearly know your way around brushes and lipstick, so you can probably find some fun and motivation over there. Lots of nice people and tempting tutorials!  Best wishes, you're strong if you've been able to kick depression in the ass long enough to take care of your hair and makeup like that!"

I actually avoid posting in that subreddit (although I def read it for tips) because I find the people there to be extremely and unnecessarily rude and unsupportive. I may post to /r/TrollMUA though, because those ladies (and perhaps gents too) are sassy and fun and nice and won't downvote you for not having a fancy camera or not being classically beautiful.   In any case, that was not a very pertinent rant. The point is that my ""routine"", though true, was meant to bring a little levity/sarcasm to a grim situation, and after going out with my curls and bit of makeup, I definitely do feel pretty and semi-confident for the first time in months.

curlyhair,38oqnc,plinthe,4,Sat Jun 6 06:42:42 2015 UTC,Make-up and a good hair day are definitely a form of anti-depressant. I get so much out of the simple ritual of it all.

I'm getting better and I hope the same is true for you! Just know that you're worth something and you DO make a difference. I appreciate your post and am happy that you took the time to make it! You look great. You're a natural beauty and I'm sure you look great when you're not 'made up' too. Thanks for 'sharing your struggle' and making my day brighter :)"
curlyhair,38oqnc,Laatikkopilvia,2,Sat Jun 6 07:24:40 2015 UTC,"You look amazing. Good look with the depression. I know it's a bitch to deal with. Please consider speaking with someone who is educated about depression, even if you don't go the route of psychiatry or medication. Your hair looks amazing and your makeup does too, especially the lipstick. Thanks for having the courage to post and I'm sorry about the idiots :)  If you ever need to talk I am glad to speak with you anytime."
curlyhair,38oqnc,greenhearted,8,Sat Jun 6 13:24:08 2015 UTC,Thank you! The one good thing about not being a stranger to depression is that I have a solid mental health team/plan and I'm well researched about it (and not ashamed -- at least not about this).  I'll deal with this post inexplicably blowing up and tons of people thinking I'm a man who looks ridiculous. It's a good exercise for learning how not to focus on the negative in a sea of positivity.

The downside is that they're a pain to sleep in (I haven't tried using them with a heat tool) and they make very tight, Shirley Temple-esque ringlets.   Edit: there are cheaper options out there that provide a similar level of curl. Try searching Amazon or eBay for them, but beware that they might not be of equal quality."

Then you can just scrunch through whatever you generally use as a leave in, and let it air dry. The festival ends up becoming this microclimate, because there are so many people, and it's really hot most of the time, so it should dry quickly if it's not raining.   And you can look on the bright side if it starts raining, it's a great way to refresh your curls!"

curlyhair,38sbo7,MyOtherShadow,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"I don't do it often but when I do, my hairdresser washes my hair - lots of conditioner. Dries it a bit, uses heat protection spray,then she blow dries it with the round brush in sections, starting with lower back sections and ending with front top sections that frame face. Then repeats with flat iron. I know a lot of heat lol. So She finishes with a shine serum like garnier sleek and shine and I think she just runs a brush or comb through it. Once she used a bit of hair spray but then did a ""touch up"" hair spray might have done something i dont know.  Yeah but Im a girl  with long hair. I think it really depends on the haircut you have prior to straightening. Your ends look sort of static like its just stick straight out. Try a bit of shine serum and a brushing it. Maybe your hair is too short and not even length to look gd straight at the moment. When I had thinning ends due to hairdresser cutting my hair in ""steps"" or ""layers"" my very ends looked just like that, but the following day it all softened up and looked less ""freshly ironed"" maybe just see how it looks the next day. But yeah try some shine serum."
curlyhair,38sbo7,hashtagphag,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure what type of climate you're in, but my hair does that same static-y thing when I straighten it in more humid environments. I have to use extra leave-in conditioner, like double my normal amount, prior to the heat protection. I use a round brush and a hair dryer to pull out all the curl. Once it's all dry, I run a shine/defrizz serum through the length of my strands, and then smooth an extra layer over the top to calm the flyaways.    I'm afraid I can't recommend ""approved"" products for this, as all of my straightening products are laden with silicones. I don't really care about that since I do it so rarely, and wash with a sulfate shampoo afterwards. If you do the same though, I can share my product list."

I can now manage three day hair - although my scalp gets really itchy so I should stop at two days lol.  I put up on my head in a high pony with scrunchy before bed and then in the morning take it out.  I let it fall while I brush my teeth and stuff and then I spray with water and scrunch it through.  The gel reactivates and when it's dry I break the gel cast.  I bought my spray bottle in the garden section of the $ store"

curlyhair,38lj12,AGhostLP,3,Fri Jun 5 01:15:34 2015 UTC,"I wash every 3ish days using either trader joes tea trea tingle conditioner or tresseme naturals conditioner (depending on how angry my dandruff is), putting extra on the ends afterwards like normal conditioner.   I say ""modified"" because I still use styling products that have silicones in them, I haven't been able to find anything that can hold a candle to miss jessie's pillow soft curls, and every once in a while I use the macadamia whatever deep conditioner.   My dandruff is too angry to ignore, so I use T-gel every 3 washes or so (once every week or two or more, basically whenever I'm about ready to rip my scalp off haha), which strips the silicone buildup as well.   My hair only looks this good for the first day, in between washes I'll clip half of it up or dunk my head in the sink and let it re-dry."

I've been using the Shea Moisture African Black Soap shampoo and conditioner and it does a good job, but I still reach for the head and shoulders about once a month and it is HELL on my colored hair (bright red) but I'd rather add color sooner than deal with itchy dandruff. Especially since I end up wearing my hair up to try to get another day or two out of my wash cycle. It's really noticeable above my ears."
curlyhair,38lj12,lnikole,2,Fri Jun 5 15:00:07 2015 UTC,"My dandruff is worse in certain places too, so I'll just lather the Nizoral on those areas & leave it on in the shower for several minutes before lathering my whole scalp. I also coat my length/ ends in conditioner while the Nizoral is on my scalp, so when I rinse it out it doesn't dry out my curls too much.   I started using the Nizoral because while you have to use for several weeks continuously in the beginning, after the dandruff is under control, you can use less often."

Maybe two quarter sized blobs as I get concerned about the whole no-lathering situation. Rinse. Then I Deva Curl One Condition, mainly just focusing on the ends as I am dealing with my greasy problem. Rinse. Leave the shower feeling great. After I let it drip dry for a few I Deva Curl gel (can't remember what it is called) and let it dry for a few before I plop for an hour or so. Then I follow up with a defuser until I get bored. I shower every 3 days or so depending on what my workout schedule is that week.  I'm just not sure what to do. I think I remember reading about this tough transition period going from sulfates to sulfate free, but I don't know how much longer I can hold on with being the dirty looking one when I go through all this effort to fix it."
curlyhair,38pamj,ImaCheeseMonkey,3,Fri Jun 5 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"Two questions:   When using the No-Poo, you are sure to really work it into your scalp with the pads of your fingers, right? Then do you spend a huge amount of time rinsing everything out, especially scalp area?"
curlyhair,38pamj,ImaCheeseMonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:46:09 2015 UTC,I feel like I do at least… from the scalp to the ends and rinse thoroughly after no-poo and conditioning.

curlyhair,38pamj,empress-of-blandings,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:59:35 2015 UTC,So you think it would be worth potentially going back to my sulfate shampoo for a bit? In all honesty I didn't use conditioner at all before so I'm not sure which one would be better to cut out for the meantime.

Locally, it's found at organic/natural stores or Whole Foods, where prices can vary.   As far as using too much, it depends on how your hair is feeling. If it's limp or weighed down or feels coated, then yeah, you may want to fully rinse out your shower conditioner. If you're lightweight and bouncy, then you're probably just fine =)"
curlyhair,38q3i3,nesdroc,4,Fri Jun 5 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"I think the surfer look can definitely hit the mark in business wear! It's all about making it sharp and professional, rather than casual and beach-tousled. It looks to me like you're actually really close to your target style already. You just need some volume at your hairline (in front), and something to help control that maddening lock of hair that keeps falling in your face.  For volume, you can try clipping it while drying. Some people use duck bill clips, while others use roller jaw clamps. I'll bet with your thick hair, the clamps would work great. Or, since you're using a hair dryer anyway, you can try flipping your head upside down while you're doing it. That definitely helps add volume.   For the hair falling in your face, you may need a mousse or gel with a stronger hold, at least on that area. Style and dry your hair like normal (assuming you're always using the hair dryer), then re-wet that section of your hair lightly. Apply a bit more product on just that spot, and use it to sorta sculp your hair together into the exact position you want it. Then try not to shake your head around or touch it until it's completely dry again. After that, you can scrunch out the crunch and it should still keep its placement. Keep in mind though that the guy rockin' the style you're going for does have his hair falling over his forehead... so you may just need to get used to the feel of it being there."
curlyhair,38q3i3,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your elaborate reply and sorry for not replying sooner. Didn't get any notification :/   You're right about the hair in the front. I think what makes a difference is that target style has his side hair curling backwards where mine just curls downwards (if it makes sense) (https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1_P6QblnRi-6SX5OubtWtwqc9Nk1lvJro-JFF-s-SEJta3otubgAx2R2mLj8FlZS5BxfUg=s190). Not sure if my sides are too long...?   I will try out the 're-sculping' procedure and see how it works. Though from video of target style it seems that his hair sits more in place, but it doesn't look like it's filled with gel or wax, so not sure how he does it :D   Seems like it's pretty much the style his rocking most of the time, so I doubt he's using a lot of time each day getting there. Kinda what I would like to be able to as well, not having to use an hour or so setting the style."

curlyhair,38oals,Smills09,7,Fri Jun 5 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"My hair is insanely tight coils, and likes to frizz as well. I'm black, so my hair care routine is a little different, but it might work for you.   When you get your hair wet in the shower, do you put conditioner in as well? I condition my hair daily -- it would be impossible to detangle otherwise. And I mean a LOT of conditioner, until I get some good slip action going. I then use my fingers to get through the worst of the tangles. This allows me to feel out the mini dreadlocks and pull them apart slowly (thanks to the conditioner) without yanking on the hair and tearing it out. I then follow up with a wide tooth detangling comb, like this one. The thing is, every time I get snagged with the comb, I reach in with my fingers, find the snag and detangle with my hands, again, keeping me from ripping it out.   Once I feel thoroughly detangled, I leave the conditioner in and attend to the rest of my shower. At the end, I rinse my hair thoroughly and put in my leave-in conditioner. No towels, no drying at all. I then put a dollop of coconut oil to help seal in the moisture, and I'm done."
curlyhair,38oals,iownakeytar,5,Fri Jun 5 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add, when I comb in the shower with conditioner I comb from tips to roots.

What I can't get my head round is why this is happening and why now... Since the Curly Girl Method 8 weeks ago this has become such a big problem! I don't think they are connected but I just can't imagine what else would cause this... I had a baby this year but unlike other parents my hair did not change one bitb- so there was no thickening etc which also means I'm not like shedding all the excess hair out now.

curlyhair,38i6q1,beerandedamame,5,Thu Jun 4 12:59:24 2015 UTC,"Looks great! Can I ask why it is a goal to not use gel? Or rather, using conditioner instead of gel (as you mentioned in the comments)? Are gels just supposed to be an aid for curls until your hair is back to ""normal""?"
curlyhair,38i6q1,helliswaiting,7,Thu Jun 4 15:25:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there is an ""official"" reason, but for me personally.. I don't like the feeling of gel in my hair. It makes my curls crunchy or greasy and instead of being able to wear my curls for a few days, I have to wash sooner. If I can get away with just a little gel while wet and then styling with hair oil, then I'd rather do that then a lot of gel."
curlyhair,38i6q1,_z0ra,4,Thu Jun 4 15:54:44 2015 UTC,Have you tried making flax gel?  Its great.  If it feels crunchy you can just scrunch it once its dry and it feels soft again.  I find it gives definition without weighing my hair down or making it feel dirty.
curlyhair,38i6q1,APsychedelicMermaid,3,Thu Jun 4 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"No, I never tried! I'll look into this. Usually as soon as I get out of the shower, I will squeeze out excess water, part my hair where I want it and scrunch some girls with curls hair gel into it. Once it's fully dry, it's not frizzy and there isn't crunch. If I put gel in my hair once it starts drying, it's too much. My hair hates it."
curlyhair,38i6q1,_z0ra,2,Fri Jun 5 18:07:24 2015 UTC,"If your going no-poo, leave-in conditioner and natural hair oil is the gold standard.  But even at that you still gotta shampoo after a while to remove excess oil build up.    If you were using gel you'd have to shampoo more frequently I feel."
curlyhair,38i6q1,gonesquatchin85,8,Fri Jun 5 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, it is kind of arbitrary. It's not like OP isn't using a product at all. She is just using a product designed to be rinsed out as a leave-in. I don't see that as substantially different from using a product designed to be used as a leave-in as a leave-in. I don't think whether or not you do that is actually a sign of how healthy your hair is. It's just a variation."
curlyhair,38i6q1,ljuvlig,5,Thu Jun 4 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people require gels to maintain styles, even if their hair is healthy.   Unless I'm in the desert, I need either a gel or a heavy product to keep my hair manageable. But, my hair is wavy and fine, and to keep it healthy, I typically need heavy products made for coarse hair (leave-ins and styling products) which requires me to wear a gel over. Otherwise, it frizzes and poufs up."
curlyhair,38i6q1,Curly_Alice,2,Thu Jun 4 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"Dang it, I'm in the desert and I still need gel!  At least my hair dries pretty fast this time of year..."

curlyhair,38i6q1,Curly_Alice,5,Fri Jun 5 02:42:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here but this question has been bugging me for days now (I'm new to this so please bear with my stupid questions)... Do you really use conditioner after washing your hair and just leave it in?? Conditioner that's supposed to be washed out of your hair?   If that's how it is I shall try and regain all of my curls!  BTW your hair looks so great!!! Really healthy and soft, just awesome :)"
curlyhair,38i6q1,_meep_,9,Thu Jun 4 15:53:53 2015 UTC,it works for some people. if you haven't tried it before I recommend filling a small spray bottle with water and conditioner and using that to revive your curls in the morning.  it is generally better to leave some conditioner in vs. rinsing it all out during your s2c (if that's your method) but for some people it can make your hair oily if you leave too much.
curlyhair,38i6q1,shikaaboom,8,Thu Jun 4 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"I don't go the whole way, but it's worked for me.  I condition my hair and rinse like normal, then put a nickel to quarter size portion of conditioner in my palm and run through my hair without rinsing.  It helps keep my hair soft and I think the weight gives my hair a bit of definition."
curlyhair,38ohzh,empress-of-blandings,2,Fri Jun 5 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"I have fine hair, here's what I do.  I let my hair dry a bit, but not totally dry. Damp hair works best.  I put a pea sized amount of oil in my palms and rub them together.  I gently use my hands to spread the oil throughout my hair. I only do my midlengths and ends. I never oil my roots, they get weighed down with any product and look and feel greasy after.  Try not to separate each curl when you run your hands through. Try to keep the curls intact.  I personally use oil OR styling product, not both. My hair is fine and soft. Product makes it gross. I'm still perfecting my routine.  How about argan oil? I used to use buriti oil, not sure if either are CG friendly- I just started last week but I am loving it. I haven't applied oil yet. If argan oil is CG friendly that's what I recommend."
curlyhair,38ohzh,suite-dee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:20:46 2015 UTC,"Even when I had long hair, I applied castor oil prior to washing, on dry hair. It really improves shine and softness! I have thick hair, though, and if your hair is finer/thin, it might be better to dilute it with another oil (like almond).  I also use a tiny bit of grapeseed oil to add shine to my hair as I scrunch out the crunch! I also use it to oil cleanse! Just the slightest bit, rubbed between my palms, and scrunched in.  I used to do heavy oilings with olive oil, as well, but it made my shower smell like pasta.  *I never liked coconut oil, it breaks me out. But, if/when you buy it, make sure it is NOT liquid (unless you live in a VERY hot area). Coconut oil is solid at room temperature because of the saturated fat."
curlyhair,38ltd0,sophieneveu,2,Fri Jun 5 01:28:46 2015 UTC,"This is my hair after I wash it.  In a few hours after that it gets super frizzy and dry. I use argan oil on my hair after washing and squeezing out the water. I plop my hair on a cotton tee for as long as I can then just let it air dry. I basically just use a sulphate free shampoo and conditioner I found at the store (Timotei). I'm from Malaysia so it's hard for me to find most CG products. Don't even get me started on getting haircuts.  It is so hard being a curly in SE Asia where all the girls are expected to have straight hair.   But basically guys, what should I be doing different? I want to be the curly goddess that I know I can. Thank you!"
curlyhair,38ltd0,hashtagphag,2,Fri Jun 5 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"Your curls aren't clumping, they're splitting, which is part of what's causing the frizz. Have you tried S2C (squish-to-condish)? How often are you shampooing, have you tried alternating with co-washing? Definitely looks like you need a leave-in conditioner and some sort of styler (gel, creme, etc). Possibly some deep conditioning treatments as well. Would you define your hair as fine, medium, or coarse? And as far as density goes, is it thin, medium, or thick? All of these things will make a difference in recommendations from us all.     I'm not sure what all is available in your country... can you check out the ""Ultimate Holy Grail Product List"" on the sidebar, and let us know which brands you've seen in your stores? That can help with recommendations as well."
curlyhair,38ltd0,hashtagphag,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"Hello! I shampoo once a week or twice if my hair is super dirty feeling. Other days i just co-wash.I live in a tropical area so I sweat a lot. It's hard to not shampoo. I've tried a Redken deep conditioner. It works alright and my hair is less frizzy but after a week from deep conditioning.. I'm back to square 1 again. I checked out the Holy Grail list. The only thing ive seen before is the Garnier Fructis. I'll make a trip to a hair saloon supply store soon to check out what they have. Most of the products I find easily would be Asian brands from Korea, Taiwan etc but ill check out what I can find and get back to you. My hair is fine in texture.   Im just wondering, when you mean gel, wouldn't it make the hair hard?"
curlyhair,38ltd0,suite-dee,2,Fri Jun 5 09:48:12 2015 UTC,"You'll wanna double-check the ingredients in the Redken product your using... a lot of them contain silicone. 'Cones aren't necessarily a bad thing if your hair can handle them, but most need to be washed out with a sulfate shampoo, which starts the cycle of dryness all over again.     If your hair is especially dry, you may need to deep condition regularly. Some CGs can get away with once a month, but many of us deep condition several times a month. I do it once a week!   Gels make your hair hard once they're dry, yes. But then you ""scrunch out the crunch""... basically, you cup your curls into your palms and squeeze them up towards your crown. That releases the hard cast of the gel, without breaking the curls apart. Your hair needs to be completely dry before your scrunch though. Gels can have differing consistency, so it's going to take some experimentation to find one that holds your curls without weighing your hair down... especially with fine hair in such a humid environment. Here's some favorites of people in this sub:   Kinky Curly Curling Custard Eco Styler DevaCurl LA Looks Aloe Vera gel (as close to 100% as you can get) Flax Seed gel (hard to find in-stores, but very easy to make at home)    I did some Googling to see if I could find any good Korean products, as hopefully you could find them locally. These are a couple brands that sound promising, although I'm having a tough time finding full ingredient lists online: Karasys, Beyond, Skin Food, Innisfree. You could also try ordering online at iherb.com, you can get pretty much any product in the world on there and they deliver to Malaysia."

curlyhair,38ltd0,maw-maw,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:59:26 2015 UTC,"Try e v coconut oil/ olive oil treatment.  Use moisturizing products like leave in conditioners. Or when you wash your hair dont rinse out all the conditioner. Plus dont always use shampoo when you wash your hair, just use it to clarify when you need it.  Always use shower cap between washes to prevent hair from getting wet and dried out.  If you have damaged hair from processing -ironing, dying relaxing , it might take a while to recover."

curlyhair,38ltd0,Hoteyez,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:39:38 2015 UTC,"water robs the hair of moisture. I read that not all silicones are bad, I think there are some that are fine. Keratin is also supposed to be ok I think. As for the damage, a lot of people do a Big Chop, and start the regrowth process. I didn't do anything that drastic myself but it all depends on the level of damage. And don't underestimate the power of coconut/olive oil."

curlyhair,38ihgl,ahnahnah,3,Thu Jun 4 13:02:26 2015 UTC,How do I make the best of sulfate shampoo and silicone conditioner? I'm currently stuck using them for a while. So far I wet and condition my hair everyday which leads me to wanting to shampoo it every other day. I fear if I stop conditioning every day it'll be a matted nest. I'm very new to trying to take care of my hair and I've never done CG so I'd like to know what you guys think.
curlyhair,38ihgl,hashtagphag,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm so late to answering, been away from Reddit for a few days here.     If you're stuck using them for a while, shampoo and condition as you feel necessary. The main thing is just knowing that the silicones won't wash out without the sulfates, and the sulfates can be drying. If our hair and scalp gets too dry, our scalp over-produces oils to try to balance it out, leading to a vicious cycle. You'll want to extra-condition as much as possible to help restore moisture into your hair. Some people do go with a modified-CG routine, and include sulfates and silicones... it's all about what works best for your hair. If you're concerned about new products, see if you can pick up smaller sizes to experiment with. That way you won't be shelling out a ton of money for something that may or may not work well. If you have a Sally Beauty Supply nearby, I believe they'll accept returns even if you've used a little bit, so you could even pick up regular size products.    If or when you go CG, don't stop conditioning... you should actually condition as much as humanly possible. Every single shower, for sure, and then some leave-in on top of that! Once you're rid of the silicones, you'll find that conditioner acts totally differently in your hair - nowhere near so much weighing down or greasiness. If you're able to skip days and get 2nd/3rd/4th day hair, what some curlies do is spray a mixture of water/conditioner into their hair to help revive the moisture, then scrunch a little bit to reactive the styling products.    So yeah, long story short: condition, condition, condition!    When you're conditioning in the shower, are you applying it all over your head, or just to your lengths? Are you rinsing any of it out or leaving some of it in? It's recommended to comb out your hair in the shower with all your conditioner in it, that really helps with the matting/tangling since your hair is already slick. If you're finding that the conditioner is sticking to your scalp and causing greasiness, you can hold your hair off to the side and rinse off just your scalp, so the length stays moisturized throughout.    Also, if you haven't started already... S2C aka ""Squish To Condish""! Totally helped my poor hair start regaining life."

I've tried s2c and  I just find it awkward to do as most of the water is out of my hand by the time it get to my hair, I just wash it out slightly and then squish it. Also in the UK there's not as much sulphate free stuff, there's organix I can't justify £14 a month on conditioner and shampoo, but boots has some sulphate free stuff which is £8 for conditioner&shampoo.

curlyhair,38ihgl,hashtagphag,2,Sun Jun 14 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Cowashing is applying conditioner to your scalp, and then you scrub it in vigorously before rinsing fully. On the days you shampoo, you don't need to apply conditioner to your scalp... unless your hair is extremely dry at the roots, that's overdoing it, and can lead to more build-up, especially since you're still using silicones. Just apply conditioner to your ends and the rest of your lengths, and avoid your scalp except during your S2C.    For S2C, I apply a ton of conditioner, my hair is white and goopy with it. From what I've noticed, more conditioner is key. Then squish your water in by making a bowl with the palm of your hands, and scrunching it into your curls. The method acts as a way to squish more hydration into your hair while rinsing at the same time.    Here's 2 videos I found helpful... slightly different applications though:    Vid 1 Vid 2"

I wet my hair, applied the masque, then some coconut oil and finger combed it all through my hair.  Then I wrapped my hair in a plastic bag (classy, I know), and put on a head wrap that I had soaked in very hot water.

Can I use my normal conditioner (Suave sleek and shine) to S2C? If I do, will the silicone build up in my hair make it unmanageable?   There's probably more, but I can't think of it now."
curlyhair,38ihgl,unfunnypun,3,Sun Jun 7 09:02:49 2015 UTC,"Tresemme naturals is nice, but since you have dense hair like me, you would probably use it up fast.

I go through a bottle every two or three months (I generally wash my hair once a week). I don't fare well with silicones, my hair gets limp."
curlyhair,38ihgl,BaroquenRecorder,2,Sun Jun 7 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"Tresemme Naturals. About $5 for a litre and silicone free. Shower every day. If you don't mind having wet hair, do a co-wash. If you want to skip that, then wear a shower cap. I think that the silicone buildup will just make your hair feel gross/heavy rather than unmanageable but we have different hair types so YMMV."

I find styling products don't make a lot of difference I use like hair gels and anti-frizz sprays I found in the sidebar recommendations and they don't leech any of the colour from my hair, but also that my colour tends to last a lot better when I'm not constantly taking heat tools to it which is nice.

If you want a really DEEP conditioning, then try wetting your hair, applying the oil, then steaming it in. You can use your natural body heat to slowly steam it in(cover your hair with a plastic shower cap, then cover that with a warm towel), or you can speed up the process with a bonnet dryer over your plastic covered hair."

curlyhair,38ihgl,hashtagphag,2,Tue Jun 9 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Co-washing is washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo. You have to scrub it in a bit more vigorously to remove product buildup from your scalp, but it still cleanses all of your hair and helps add additional moisture back in.   Plopping is placing your post-shower/wet hair into a t-shirt or big microfiber towel, and wrapping it around your head like a turban. Your hair is ""plopped"" into the material. You then leave the turban on as long as you feel is necessary (varies person-to-person) to help draw some of the water out of your hair."

I also have an extreme cowlick and uneven areas of curl and wave all over.   Last night was the first night I tried any curly girl suggestions. I showered without shampoo, scrubbed my scalp with my finger tips, put some argan oil in and thermal protection on with my fingers while it was wet, then plopped over night to dry it.

I have to shower in the morning, or I end up with greasy and lanky hair by midday. I think there's two reasons for this:   1) I have naturally oily skin on my face, and it transfers into my hair. 2) The products in my hair are smooshed into my scalp for 8 hours, causing buildup there rather than being absorbed into my hair.   You mentioned your hair is thick, but how long is is also? You might try showering/plopping in the morning, and using a combo of pin curl and duck bill clips to bring out volume and get those face-wispies to behave. Or, if you want to keep showering at night, make sure you're not applying too much product before you plop. You can always spray/rake on a little more in the morning, and diffuse a bit.    Don't get discouraged... there's a learning curve to going CG with your hair, at least a couple weeks. Hell, I'm a few months in and still experimenting to find exactly what works!

curlyhair,38j7z6,gimmedacashhhh,2,Thu Jun 4 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"Is she actively thinning (acute shedding and/or Alopecia) or does she just have thin/not dense hair? For now, I'm gonna assume she's actively thinning. Help depends on the cause of the thinning.   If it's age/genetics, short of hair-loss treatments (Rogaine, Propecia, etc), nothing's gonna change it. All the women in my family have thinning hair as they get older, and I'm already beginning to experience it (in my 30s). I'm taking vitamins and trying to take care of my hair, but it's really just delaying the inevitable.    There could be underlying medical issues causing thinning, such as thyroid issues or hormone/chemical imbalance. If that's the case, it can only be diagnosed by a doctor after blood tests, and treatments vary. It's also pretty common for pre- and post-menopausal women to experience hair thinning as hormones change up quite a bit.    If it's just damage though, that can definitely be helped by coaching her into better hair care. It won't hurt to give it a try!"

I also have the smoothie, and I'm using it up by mixing a tablespoon or two in with my ""protein treatments"" (two beaten eggs). Finally, protein treatments that don't leave my hair brittle/are super hard to rinse! ;)"
curlyhair,38ebat,gglacia,2,Wed Jun 3 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"The products I'm using right now are Shea Moisture shampoo and Tresemme Naturals conditioner. I'm actually not using any leave in or product because my hair is fine and product always weighs it down and makes it feel greasy.   For my second day curls, I do rewet them just a bit (I don't get frizz unless it's very very humid, so rewetting helps the curls I do have bounce a bit more) and I scrunch them up a bit. I'm only 2a though...I barely have curls anyway.  I'm just starting out, but hopefully this helps a little."
curlyhair,38ebat,suite-dee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's definitely great insight to see what other people are doing with their hair and the products they use. I've used Shea Moisture and I love it, but I stopped using it because of money. But I think I might go back!   I never rewetted my hair before because I had no idea if it was an okay thing to do :P I've read a lot of stuff but like, a lot of what people say and articles don't really go into depth with that information."
curlyhair,38ebat,suite-dee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"I agree! I don't know if rewetting is an advisable thing to do with the CG method, but I feel like as long as you're not using harsh chemicals on your hair and scalp you can practice with different things until you find what's ideal for your own hair. Rewetting works for me, but I'm not prone to frizz. If you are, a light product that won't weigh your curls down will probably work better.  Just keep the curls intact, whatever you do. Don't do anything rough enough to separate them."
curlyhair,38ebat,onerandomday,2,Wed Jun 3 19:33:04 2015 UTC,I put my hair up in a high pony (I can't really pull off a pineapple) at night and then in the morning I spray my hair with water from a spray bottle.  That seems to activate the gel again and once it's dry I de-crunchify it.  For Gel I bought the Deva Ultra defining gel but I don't find it any better than my Herbal Essence Totally Twisted gel which is a lot cheaper.

I surprisingly still have the Deva Ultra Defining Gel! I stopped using it because of the way my hair felt with different products, but I think now that I'm using different stuff, I might get a different outcome."
curlyhair,38ebat,all_u_need_is_cheese,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:04:56 2015 UTC,I use a scrunchy because it's pretty gentle but I don't put it on super tight.  When I first take it out my hair has a lot of volume lol.  But I let it fall down while I do other things and then I spray it with water.  I know some people put conditioner in their water to help with frizz.  If it's super frizzy I'll put a small amount of gel in my hands and just gently stroke my hands down the sides of my hair - without raking or anything.
curlyhair,38ebat,all_u_need_is_cheese,2,Wed Jun 3 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"2nd/3rd day can be a challenge for less curly hair (mine is also 2C). I style with a bit of Kinky Curly Curling Custard the first day, which I recommend trying, and what I basically do 2nd/3rd day is take a shower but don't wet my hair. The humidty really re-awakens my curls and re-activates the KCCC. I know this is kind of anathema, and it does result in some frizz, but otherwise my hair is FLAT so I just go with the frizz. :)   If I don't do this, then I basically have waves by 2nd day and almost straight hair by 3rd day. I have also been trying just going with that. It's kind of like having Transformer hair. On 2nd day I do a style that works better with waves (half back, etc.) and 3rd day I do something that works with straightish hair (french braids, side pony, etc).   But I can get it to bounce back pretty well with the shower method, especially if I flip upside down and scrunch with damp hands to get the underneath as well (with the water pointed elsewhere). This is great if you really want texture again."
curlyhair,38ebat,empress-of-blandings,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Haha omg transformer hair is great. Yea my hair used to be suuupppperrr curly and then i kinda relaxed it too much with straightening it so much so now I'm trying to get my curls back :(I've been doing the curly girl method for around a year now, and I've only used a curling iron once for a wedding I went to. I think I have 2c/3a hair as of right now, but it's so hard to tell for me. I think I used to have like 3b hair when my hair was curly, but sigh that was so long ago. But for now, my hair is pretty curly on the first day, the second day it's kinda a sad excuse for curly hair, and then the third it's kinda really relaxed beachy waves.   But maybe I'll have to try getting my hair curly again through taking a shower but not getting my hair wet.   Do you only use the KCCC as a leave in? Or do you use other products?"
curlyhair,38ebat,empress-of-blandings,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, they'll come back. Mine also took a while to get back to their real curl after I stopped straightening. But I have 2C at max, ah well. The shower thing really works, I usually try ""smoothing"" my hair with wet hands to tame the frizz when I get out of the shower, which works oddly well unless it's humid out. A little dab of oil will also work to smooth the resulting frizz if it's being aggressive, I use argan or coconut but I think almost anything is OK.  I usually only leave in KCCC, sometimes also a little of the DevaCurl One Conditioner with it if it's being really tangley. I used to use a combo of the Deva Ultra Defining Gel and their volumizing foam, I think that worked SUPER well, but it made my scalp too dry. :( I also get good results with homemade flaxseed gel, it just takes forever to dry so I usually only use it in summer, and it hasn't warmed up yet where I live (Oslo)!"
curlyhair,38ebat,devacurl,4,Fri Jun 5 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"Do you use a styling product or just conditioner? Without gel, I don't even get first day hair...more like first hour!   I cowash with suave or VO5, condition with tresseme naturals, which I wash out, and then use gel. I'm trying to spend less money so Im using either LA looks sport, or Garnier Pure Clean  gel. When Im in a mood to treat myself I use CurlJunkie Aloe fix gel.   For two or three day hair I don't really anything; I just make sure the hair doesn't get messed at night by putting it in a satin nightcap, then fluff it a bit the next day. I don't bother with rewetting, if it's to that point I just wash it again."

I haven't really touched any styling product because I'm still trying to figure everything out and I'm already a year into this transition :( my hair can hold half of the curls for second day sometimes but other times it falls flat. My hair also gets matted ridiculously easily (not sure if it's because I live in such a dry climate, I live in a desert for the most part).   Do you s2c? I try like once in a while but I've never been able to get the water to stay in my curls, idk if I'm doing it wrong or if my hair is just that dry. i'll wet my hair in warm water (sometimes hot, trying to get color out of my hair) and i'll coat the ends of my hair with the Treseme and then and then squish water up into my head for a couple rounds then repeat."

I smaller/tighter curls (4a) so without something to keep the curls intact they frizz, tangle, may up, and dry out...I think experimenting with some gentle styling products might be really helpful for you.   I don't s2c because (a) I don't really get it (b) when I have tried it, it pushed product onto my scalp and made it itchy (c) I'm not really looking for curlier hair, which is the point of s2c I think?   All I do is take some of the gel while in the shower, squish it into the hair and run it down the length (hair is soaking wet in the shower when I do this), and then I clip it up to get it off my shoulders, or sometimes put it up un a microfiber towel.

curlyhair,38fcu0,MarvinHubert,2,Wed Jun 3 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say you're a combo of 2A/2B right now... you'll probably be a solid 2B, maybe even curlier, once you find your rhythm and routine. Your hair is looking nice and healthy, so that's good. I'm thinking you need to find the right combo of styling products.   Is your hair fine, medium, or coarse? Is your density thin, average, or thick? That will help those of us with similar hair types offer advice. Any idea of your porosity?  That Suave conditioner you're using has silicones. Since you're not shampooing, they might be building up on your hair and weighing it down. I'd recommend ditching that no matter what, and using a clarifying shampoo this one time to get out any residual build up. Check out the Suave Naturals line instead, I believe all of their conditioners are 'cone-free.  You mentioned that the Garnier left your hair crunchy-feeling. I did some Googling and have been finding mixed reviews online about it. Several people said exactly the same thing, and that it acted more like a light gel in their hair than a leave-in. So yeah, no conditioning effect at all.  Have you tried out S2C (squish-to-condish) in the shower? That may help you get a little more bounce and life in your curls. Plopping isn't necessarily going to give you curls that you don't already have, it's more of a way to help you get your hair to dry... but it might work out better once you have some styling products to help your curls form and hold. Are you using any gels or cremes after your leave-in?"
curlyhair,38fcu0,hashtagphag,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:23:14 2015 UTC,My hair is definitely fine and very thin.  I have no idea about porosity; how would I determine that?  Thanks for the heads up about Suave!  I'm going to the store tomorrow and definitely will look for Suave Naturals.  Is S2C just putting conditioner in my hands and squishing it into wet hair in the shower?  I'm not entirely sure if that's what you mean.  But I can try that!  I'm not using any gels or creams after the leave-in; do you have any recommendations?  Thanks so much for the help!!!
curlyhair,38fcu0,hashtagphag,2,Thu Jun 4 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!   For porosity, check out the instructions and descriptions here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/texture-typing/hair-porosity. Basically, if you're low, your hair tends to repel products and moisture, and if your high, your hair sucks them all right up and then some.   S2C is pretty much that, yes. It's a way pushing water and conditioner more fully into your hair while rinsing, and encourages natural curl clumping. These 2 videos I found really helpful... slightly different methods, but easy to understand starting points:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMW0ZsYXAjE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDi0OvYSgSA   For gels/cremes, you'll definitely need to experiment to find what works best and gives you the results you're looking for. Products are gonna act differently for all of us. Aloe Vera gel was lightweight, but my curls would always break apart once I scrunched out the crunch. Kinky Curly Curling Custard gave me good definition, but I was shedding quite a lot of hair every time I used it, so there's just something in it my hair doesn't agree with. DevaCurl styling creme didn't provide much hold unless I used a TON of it, and it's too expensive for me to be doing that. Right now I'm using Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie (wow, that's a mouthful) and really like it. I'm getting bouncier curls, more volume, good hold, and even though it's marketed towards thick hair, I'm not finding it weighs my hair down or anything like that. Others that I've heard people recommend (although I haven't tried them myself):    Eco Styler gel DevaCurl (light defining, ultra defining, Arc Angel) LA Looks  (sports gel, IIRC)    Finding a new leave-in is gonna be tricky also... there's so many out there, and with fine/thin hair, it can be difficult to find the right balance. I really liked DevaCurl B'Leave In, but like their creme, I had to use a ton of it (long hair), so it's not worth the cost. I played around with using regular shower conditioners as a leave-in, but didn't feel like my hair was getting enough moisture. I'm using Giovanni Direct Weightless Leave-In right now and really like it, it's definitely lightweight and I don't need to use much at all. People here also rave about Kinky Curly Knot Today and the Yes To Carrots/Coconuts/etc line. I think I've heard others mention GVP's leave-in as well."

I've been wanting to post a pic + routine, but yours looks almost exactly like mine, so I'll piggy back on your post and put my routine here (also please post yours! I wonder how ours differ):   I never shampoo. I use L'Oreal Paris EverCurl Hydracharge Cleansing Conditioner once a week or so, mainly on my scalp. I always condition with L'Oreal Paris EverSleek Sulfate Free Smoothing System Intense Smoothing Conditioner A couple times a week, I also add extra virgin coconut oil before I condition (so it gets semi-rinsed out with the conditioner) After I shower, I wrap my hair in a towel for a few minutes. Then I add a small amount of the Eversleek Conditioner mentioned above through my hair (and I leave it in) I also saturate my hair with Paul Mitchell The Conditioner and organic pure argan oil. A lot of people say never to brush curly hair, but my hair HAS to be brushed or else it turns out crazy. So I gently brush all the product through. Then I grab small locks of my hair and twist them into curls. Then I air dry, and it comes out looking pretty similar to OP!   For background, I'm not sure what my curl pattern is, probably whatever OP's is. My hair is extremely dry and prone to frizz, so I have to make sure I saturate it with all the products I use. It's taken me years to find a routine that works, but now I can finally wear my hair down confidently (I used to always wear it in a pony tail)."

curlyhair,38eeuz,empress-of-blandings,3,Wed Jun 3 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks! Some people use it to mean transitioning to CG method, or transitioning from chemically straightened hair to natural curls. Just clarifying.   In the strictest sense of the word, true no-poo would mean purely co-washing (washing only with conditioner). So you would avoid using the low-poo. However, lots of people find they still need to occasionally use a gentle cleanser here and there, so IMO it's not that bad. The product you're using doesn't have any sulfates, so its not going to be as drying. If I were you I would just not use it every day; alternate it with co-washing and try limiting the shampoo to when you feel the cowashing isn't enough.   The main thing about stoppibg shampoos and sulfates is to make sure NONE of your conditioners or styling products has any silicones...even the low-poo will not be able to get them out and they will just stay on your hair. As long as you follow the basics of ""no sulfates"", ""no cones"", ""limit drying out the hair (with shampoo, alcohol, etc)"" you should be good."

It's really about the drying ingredients of harsh shampoos that makes washing so bad!"
curlyhair,3899xp,minniesnowtah,2,Wed Jun 3 00:20:37 2015 UTC,Have you tried co-washing? You can wash more often without harming your hair and scalp with harsh shampoos.

curlyhair,3899xp,Tingiie,2,Tue Jun 2 19:12:00 2015 UTC,"It means that you can wash your scalp with conditioner instead. That way, you won't damage your hair as much as you would with a shampoo :) there's really good information in the sidebar about this. Good luck!"
curlyhair,3899xp,suite-dee,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, what Tingiie said. Also, you can still use your regular shampoos if you want once or twice a week, and anytime you want to wash more often, just co wash instead. There are specific methods for cowashing, they involve working your conditioner coated fingers into your scalp to cleanse it.   If you prefer using shampoo, look into getting a sulfate free shampoo. Make sure it's completely sulfate free, there is an ingredients list and a product list on the sidebar so you can be sure. And we can help, of course. I personally use the Shea Moisture line."
curlyhair,3899xp,suite-dee,2,Tue Jun 2 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"This is great guys, thanks.   EDIT: I just realized..I co wash already!!! I didn't know it had a name ^  So by doing this, I can wash more regularly? This entire time I could have just been running around washing my hair?!?!?!? WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE?!!??"
curlyhair,3899xp,Frose91,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:11:32 2015 UTC,"For people who have been washing with sulfate shampoo and then start cowashing, they will probably notice some added scalp greasiness for the first few days/week/weeks depending. That's just their scalp overproducing oil because they've been stripping it out with sulfates- the scalp thinks it has to produce more oil. This is normal and the scalp ""learns"" after a little bit that it doesn't need all the oil anymore.  For you, since you've only been washing 2x/week, I don't know if you'll see a difference. If you went with cowashing ONLY, then probably a bit of greasiness at first. If you just do your regular routine and add cowashing in on other days, you probably won't have any problems or issues to get used to.  You can do it as often as you want, as far as I know. Many people start cowashing because they want to stretch the time between washes, and their scalp is too oily to do so with regular shampoo. But since you want to wash MORE often, I really don't think water and a little bit of conditioner would hurt every other day or so."
curlyhair,38ag5g,curlyhairlurker123,6,Tue Jun 2 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"Hi friend! So, I lose a tooonnnn of hair every time I shower (once a week). I mean, like, I could probably make a little fur baby out of how much comes out. I catch most of it and put it on the shower wall for safe keeping, then throw it out when I'm done. But I do this, and STILL clog up my drain.  I also have thick hair like yours, and I'm pretty sure curlies like you and me just shed a little more than the average-thickness curlies. Additionally, I am 100% positive the amount of ""hair-loss"" (I put it in quotes, because it's not actually scary hair-loss) has to do with the fact that we don't brush/comb and we wash our hair a lot less often. Bonus points if you have long-ish hair! Then it REALLY seems like a ton.  TL;DR: You are totally fine, and I lose a massive amount of hair in the shower, too, and I only notice it in the shower (ie my hair doesn't look thinner or anything). No worries! Don't panic!"
curlyhair,38ag5g,milkchalk,2,Tue Jun 2 23:21:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly, since we don't brush, it doesn't have the opportunity to shed a lot during the day. So it kind of just hangs out on our heads for awhile and all comes out at once when we shower."
curlyhair,38ag5g,suite-dee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it unless you see actual thinning. CG methods, like cowashing, involve a lot of scalp stimulation, so you're probably kicking up more shed hairs than you're used to seeing!"
curlyhair,38ag5g,unfunnypun,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"I lost a fair amount of hair co-washing with a thick conditioner. But if you're losing large portions of your hair in clumps, or in spots like the crown of your head, your part, or your hairline, I would go see an immunologist or dermatologist.  But just to reassure you, people lose an average of 50-100 strands in a day."

curlyhair,38a6ko,jgonz85,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"Aussie's Instant Freeze gel has been my favorite gel so far - good for more humid days and doesn't leave my hair crunchy, but it can feel sticky if I have a lot in. I also use LA Looks gel, which doesn't work super great on humid days but is fine on other days. My hair does get crunchy if I use it on wash day but within a few hours of it drying it crunches out.  For creams, my two favorites have been the GVP conditioning balm and the Care Free Curl Gold Instant Activator (not CG). The GVP works best on a wash day, and I use the Activator on other days after I spritz my hair with water and conditioner. It makes my curls so shiny, defined, and bouncy!"

Personally, it gets my hair too defined because I like a bit of volume. I found that by brushing underneath the hair and away from my head, it would give more volume. Overall I like it, though I usually only use it when I'm trying to get super defined curls or something. It's worth a try if you're curious!"
curlyhair,38apyj,Prenomen,2,Wed Jun 3 04:29:48 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love my denman! I was hesitant at first because /r/curlyhair is all about the wide tooth combs, but switching over has really made all the difference in cutting down detangling time, reducing frizz, and giving me great clumping.

I washed it this morning with Tresseme curl hydrating shampoo (just the tiniest bit), and then squished and finger combed tons of Tresseme curl hydrating conditioner through it. I squished and rinsed some of the conditioner out and when I got out of the shower I parted it with my fingers and put in Herbal Essences curl sculpting gel and sprayed it with my Victoria Secret ocean wave spray.  After I pinned the front back with some bobby pins and let it air dry. I should note that non of this is CG approved... it works in my hair and I haven't decided if I want to go down another road atm, since I like what my hair does now."
curlyhair,387zgx,AugustAnna,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I think you are on the right track. My fav was the pic with your hair pinned up/back/ponytailed? and the curly pieces framing your face, so my suggestions are for a cut that moves you to those proportions. I've been wearing my hair that way for months while I grow it out.  Our hair type does well with diy cuts if you are adventurous... a basic ponytail cut would add in some layers and give you an easier shape to wear down. If your shortest layers from the crown hit mid cheek... you could also get it cut professionally and ask for a steeply angled bob with layers. Don't let them thin your hair, stylists see 2b/2c and want to thin it until it submits. It won't. :)"
curlyhair,387zgx,radixmalorumest,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:21:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I do like the way it looks pulled back into a ponytail like that. It is how I did it today also.  I am likely going to get an asymmetrical bob when I get it cut next. I am trying to grow it out so really don't want to get it cut but probably should. I will have to ask my stylist how she is with curly hair, I hope she is good with it because I really like her."
curlyhair,387zgx,minniesnowtah,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of the thought that there are two parts of dealing with curly hair -- choosing products and how you handle it.  For products, you're certainly using all CG things but may be weighing it down a little bit with so many things that aren't being washed out when you leave the shower (leave in, gel, frizz control). I'd consider going without the leave-in and frizz control. Leave in is quite heavy, and pastes like the frizz control can sometimes create more frizz in fine/wavy hair when applying it.  For how you handle your hair, there is a bit of trial and error, but the gist is to avoid touching/moving it as much as humanly possible before drying. For example, if you take your hair out of a plop and flip it around a little, you could easily lose curl definition. Also, when you come out of the shower, are your curls well-defined and nicely clumped? Because this is the most defined it'll ever be in the process of washing. You may want to experiment with flipping upside down to rinse, applying product while super wet, combing it through upside down, etc, to see if you can improve the definition there.   Hopefully this has been helpful! I don't want to be a massive wall of text but feel free to ask if you have any questions!"
curlyhair,387zgx,gonesquatchin85,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"Looks like your hair is saturated with a bit too much product.  It looks damp and weighed down.  Your products are good, but since you have very loose curls, I feel you don't need an intense application of product.  Maybe just a combination of leave-in and mousse out of the shower, or going semi no-poo might work."
curlyhair,3897mf,ohheyitsathroaway,2,Tue Jun 2 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"What's your goal, do you want defined waves? Lots of body? I can help you more with the former, though I have chin-length hair. Anyway, stop towel-drying. Instead, run some light gel through your hair, scrunch/fluff it with your fingers, and if needed pat dry with a t-shirt or microfiber towel. This will (theoretically) give you more of a touseled wavy look. After it dries, pat/gently rub to break up the gel and keep you from having the wet/gel look.  As for the rest, if your shampoo has sulfates it's no wonder your hair is dry. Make sure your conditioner also has no silicates in it. When you were using sulfate-free shampoo or co-washing, were you sure to scrub your scalp really well? I find it takes a lot more work to get my scalp clean with that stuff. I also have to make sure I don't get products right in the roots, or I'll get an itchy scalp."
curlyhair,3897mf,KegelFairy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what body is in regards to hair, but that messy wavy look I would absolutely go for. When my hair dries I usually end up having some form of helmet hair. Can I use mousse instead of gel? I like the lightness of it.   As far as the cowashing I didn't spend too much time on washing my scalp. And I'll try out the shirt thing. Are there any conditioners/products that work well for you?"
curlyhair,3897mf,KegelFairy,2,Tue Jun 2 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"Body=volume, what you called ""poof.""   For co-washing and detangling (not a problem for you, probably) I have had success with Suave's coconut conditioner and Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle. I think they perform the same but I like the TJ smell better. I also use JoJoba deep conditioner from Sally's, but have to be careful not to get it too close to the root or it weighs my hair down.  The best gel I've used for my hair is DevaCurl's Light Defining Gel but it's a bit pricy. You'll want to experiment a little with whatever product you use to get just the right amount. I use kind of a lot of gel, let it dry as much as I can before touching it, then run my fingers around the crown and scrunch the rest to get rid of that hard gel look. You might be able to run your fingers along the scalp to break up the helmet effect, or that might make you frizz up, in which case you'll want to kind of... aggressively pat your head to break it up. You might be able to get the same effect with mousse. I mostly hear that it doesn't have the kind of hold that gel does, but with shorter hair that might be less of an issue."
curlyhair,3897mf,crp07,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:48:21 2015 UTC,H&S has a co-washing product that seems good (http://www.headandshoulders.com/en-US/hair-products/moisture-care-co-wash). I'm currently using it now so the jury's still out. That should help with the itchies.
curlyhair,3897mf,devacurl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"Have you tried using a microfiber towel or cotton t-shirt to dry your hair? This will help reduce frizz.  The key is to flip your hair over and scrunch up. Another tip is to make sure to work in One Condition (I think you have tried it, right?) in the shower, using 4 fingers over 4 fingers until hair is silky. You can also leave some in for extra hydration. Hope this is helpful."

Doing this should get you  closer to defined hair. finish up by scrunching in more conditionor(the tresseme is an amazing leave in or me) or a real leave in. you can end with gel, but its not necessary. You can try plopping, but it doesnt work well for me. let your hair airdry. itll take awhile, so i usually shower at night. good luck!"

curlyhair,3835v2,NextNeedsUp,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:27:47 2015 UTC,Coconut oil doesn't really do much by itself.  If you're trying to calm it down they make curl creams.  I've been using Jessicurl as my first experiment with putting things in my hair and people can tell the difference.  The thing that works best for me is the leave in conditioner though.  That stuff is the truth.
curlyhair,3835v2,NextNeedsUp,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"I disagree. coconut oil on its own will help exponentially as long as you give it time.   most products contain ingredients that temporarily smooth your hair at the expense of locking moisture out, meaning your hair will at best maintain its level of frizz (without the product) and at worst get frizzier.  with only coconut oil you're purely moisturizing. so at first your hair may look worse, as you're no longer synthetically closing the follicles, but over time, you'll see marked improvement.   I have 3c-ish hair and don't use any other products, except for one or two shampooings a week. my hair is strong, shiny, and very low frizz even immediately after one box dye and one hydrogen/baking soda bleach. I've been doing this for about 4 months (towel drying post shower, applying coconut oil, and brushing while still damp) and my hair has never been healthier except for a week ago (before my first lightening treatment).  My suggestion is to exclusively use the oil, and if you shower at night, to spray water on in the morning and brush again. at first, put lots of oil on in a hot shower, rinse it out after about 10 minutes as best you can, and if necessary add more after you get out. then give it a few weeks before deciding it doesn't work. you may also benefit from more frequent shampoos than I do, but definitely not more than every other day."
curlyhair,3835v2,yourhaploidheart,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"This is my hair after a day of school. No products other than some coconut oil the day before, I find that my hair is pretty dry, after a shower it's manageable but some sections of my hair still separate and are frizzy even when wet. I use a lot of coconut oil as well as a leave in conditioner sometimes."

curlyhair,381dwi,expulsus,2,Mon Jun 1 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Okay so I wash my hair every other day because it makes me feel uncomfortable if I go longer than that. When I wash it I use Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner (I use shampoo only when I feel like it's necessary which is probably every three washes). Afterwards, I squeeze out all the water from my hair and plop with a cotton t-shirt for like 3 minutes to absorb the excess water. I then scrunch my hair and apply about a nickel size of tresseme hair gel, scrunching my hair afterwards to absorb the excess product. I apply tresseme hair mousse right after and use the t-shirt again. I let it sit for about 3-5 mins then I use the diffuser.   I posted my routine about a year ago I think but I went more in depth time and some of the steps are different :)"

curlyhair,385vxv,missjlynne,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"Plopping doesn't work for me. I do it for about 5-10 minutes just to get out the excess moisture and then I dry my hair with a diffuser. I use the low air, low heat setting or else it gets to be a frizzy mess. Any other method makes my hair wild.... plopping and air drying especially.   Also, be sure that you are getting enough moisture in your hair when you condition. I know you said you squish to condish, but it really is outrageous the amount you need to properly moisturize these poor curlies."
curlyhair,385vxv,unfunnypun,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"Don't mean to shamelessly self-promote, but check out my imgur album @unfunnypuns. My hair looked like ass the first few weeks, too. It gets better, I promise. It's always a work in progress; you don't really see the improvement until you look back at how far you've come. CG doesn't work for everyone. Try experimenting with water soluble cones! Also, you might be plopping a bit too long. I've found that I can't let my hair dry too much, or all the way in a plop, or it gets really puffy (from the friction, maybe)? I only plop for about 15 minutes when I'm fresh out of the shower so diffusing doesn't take painfully long.   Stay strong! :)"

curlyhair,3822v6,juliaplayspiano,2,Thu Jun 4 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not very god at describing stuff like this but I'll try... I lay the shirt out flat with the bottom end towards me. I lower my head onto it about 2/3ds of the way down the top, so that the bottom of the shirt will be level with my hairline when folded up. Then I pull the top of the shirt towards me, so it covers the back of my head. Pull the front sides up past my ears, tucking each side under the overlap from the back. This is the part where you need to make sure it's pulled tight to your head! Bring the sleeves round to the front one at a time, I usually roll my head to one side, pull the sleeve around tightly, then roll my head back into it to keep it in place while I do the other side. So now the shirt should be firmly in place, with the sleeves half wrapped around. Grab hold of each of the sleeves and pull from the opposite sides, so they are crossed at the front, then lift your head and pull the ends round, to tie them together at the back of your head.  Does that make any sort of sense??"

curlyhair,3835o4,cinnamonsnap,2,Mon Jun 1 14:54:22 2015 UTC,I just cowash inbetween (normally on a Wednesday).
curlyhair,3835o4,dandue,2,Mon Jun 1 16:48:51 2015 UTC,"I would suggest cowashing it somewhere in between. I cowash frequently because my hair tends to tangle at the ends to no avail. Use whatever conditioner you have. Shea moisture makes a great coconut and hibiscus cowash that you can get at rite aide usually on sale. Conditioner contains the same cleaning property that shampoo does, it's just diluted and filled with moisturizing entities. Also try massaging your scalp once a day to break up some of the build-up, definitely before washing or cowaching. And I love cowashing because moisturizing your hair isn't as much of a process as after washing it."
curlyhair,3835o4,mixedcurlsnyc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's a careful balance, most days I just leave conditioner throughout my whole shower session which is about 10 mins.  It usually cleans up smells.  The few times when smell is overwhelming, usually oils are too, I use a really small amount of sulfate free shampoo and spread in small sections on my scalp.  Probably shampoo 1/3 of scalp.  For me my hair is very fine and hugely dependent on natural scalp oil.  I shampoo too much, even with sulfate free shampoo, my hair gets very frizzy and loses body."

A few months ago (the ""Before"" pic) I had frizzy hair every. single. day. I've always hated my hair and I used to straighten it all the time. So I gave myself an ultimatum. Either I would straighten my hair everyday/relax my curls or I would chop it off. Luckily, I came across this subreddit before it was too late. I picked up the scissors and experimented a bit (DevaCut). It was such a relief <3  Back then I still used shampoo (Lush shampoo) but now I only use conditioners when I shower. One that is a bit thinner (DermOrganic Conditioner) for co-washing so that my scalp won't get greasy and one heavier (Maria Nila True Soft Conditioner) for rinsing. I air dry my hair when I can and ""pineapple"" it. After that I use argan oil to give it some shine.  If you'd like some clarification just ask!  Edit: I live in Sweden (born and raised here) but since I have Lebanese roots my hair has always been in conflict with the cold harsh weather here. So I'm super happy that I've found a way (thanks to this subreddit <3) for my hair to be comfortable in any country no matter the environment :)"

curlyhair,380v0m,Leigh_Cheri,2,Mon Jun 1 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"First. Stop washing your hair daily. At first it will be oily at the roots, but give it a couple weeks for your scalp to acclimate.  Second. In my opinion, it looks like you need a new cut. All of your curls are accumulated at the base ( is this from pulling it back in a ponytail when your hair is wet?). Those of us in the business (having curly hair) call that triangle head.  I would recommend more layers.   Third. Your hair appears to be really fine.

curlyhair,380v0m,ImaCheeseMonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:56:52 2015 UTC,"Well I have been denying the curls!   The picture is of my hair just completely air dried, no product.   I use soy renewal and really like it.  Today I tried cowashing and my hair straightened really nice!  I think my cut is more for a straightened bob, not curls.  I have a hair cut scheduled for June 10, what should I be asking for?  I looked at the sidebar and I think I am the first set of wavy curl style.  I do find that if I do air dry my hair and let the curls happen I think its super messy."
curlyhair,381dio,notanotherjohnson,2,Mon Jun 1 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"I have very fine hair, and it will not dry at all if it's plopped, but plopping is required for defintion. I'll usually plop for 30 minutes to ""set"" my waves/curls, and if I plop longer, it does not decrease unplopped drying time.  But, I do recommed swapping your plopping medium. I'll plop with one t-shirt in the shower, then swap it for a dry t-shirt after a few minutes, this actually helps a bit."

Their website said so and the lady on the phone said they specialise in it. Worst mistake. Still paying for it. My hair was cut wet, shrunk so bad and it's taken me almost a year to grow out to same length. The worst thing was that the cut was uneven once dry and she put at least half of a bottle of morrocon oil curl defining cream in to somehow try to make it look half decent.   That was the first time and last time I went for a 'curly hair cut'.   Also, I just found this after a quick google, might be worth having a look into? (Haven't used them myself.)  Good luck!"

It's not quite a devacut, but she knows a lot about how to manipulate curls. AND she listens very closely to what you want done and asks really specific questions to get your hair where you want it. She got out the last of the damage from some thinning shears from 3 years ago, made sure to get my layers just where I wanted them, and worked with what my hair wanted to do (as in, knew how to blend the two different curl types my head sprouts).   Currently, booking online gets you a 20% discount. A ""long"" haircut is £60, with the discount was £48. My hair is shoulder blade length.  She works in a salon in soho by Tottenham Court Road.   Here's her facebook page with before/after photos."

They did a good cut but chopped off way more than I wanted. I went back to a different stylist next time I wanted a cut and the same thing happened. So unless you're looking for a drastic cut,  I wouldn't recommend them.   I go to a hairdresser in Wimbledon now and have been going for a while (almost 3 years now).  It's very expensive, but I honestly think it's worth it at this point. It's called Essente hair and go to a stylist called Antonio. He also has a tendency to cut off too much, but if you're firm and it hasn't been too long since the last cut he gets it right.  I take my own products and they use them for me.  The only thing is that I don't like is the way he dries it, but that's not really a problem because I can wash it out the next day and style it as I like."

Don't remember her name unfortunately, I think she was the salon manager and I really do hope she still works there because I kind of need a trim too. I say it's worth phoning them or something.

Second, you don't need to buy an expensive little jar. My favorite ""deep conditioner"" is an SMT. I got it off LHC, back when I had long hair. It's a mix of aloe gel, conditioner, and honey!

Try to avoid conditioners with protein or lots of silicones, it could get clumpy. (ALWAYS test the mix on the back of your hand!)

curlyhair,37stv2,bananawhat,5,Sun May 31 07:23:00 2015 UTC,Have you washed and restyled it since? sometimes it takes a few cycles for hair to sort itself our after a cut;. I often don't quite like the way my hair looks after a devacut but once I've styled it myself a few times it chills out :)

I got the carrot sealing oil which I liked to use in the winter to moisturize my hair and I mainly just use it on my ends throughout the rest of the year. It's a very good blend of oils as it soaks into my hair and doesn't leave it feeling greasy. And it smells like cookies! My only issue is that it takes a long time to receive your shipment and since it isn't sold in stores it is very inconvenient for me to regularly purchase. Overall, I had a positive experience and it looks like many other people do as well."

All of my products were argan oil / shea butter intensive. My swap-in routing is coconut milk based. It leaves no buildup in my hair, but it does have sulfates. Hm. Also, their website says they may cancel my appointment or charge me for a product removal if there is oil biuldup in my hair. I don't mind the extra charge, but if they're busy, they might cancel my appt, and that'd suck."

I find that those few stubborn curls that cannot be tamed have a certain rakish quality to them, particularly on guys.  That said, can you tell us what, if anything, you are using on your hair? Do you use any sort of curl definer post shower? Are those curls well-defined? (It's hard to tell in this photo.) Is your hair long enough to wrap in a tee shirt? This is what I do after a shower and it helps the curls on the back/top of my head to maintain their ringlet-esque shape."
curlyhair,37oz4x,MisoPlas,2,Fri May 29 14:08:57 2015 UTC,I don't use anything in my hair. I just wash thoroughly with water. And for length they're about 3.5in

curlyhair,37l7g6,brattylilduck,9,Thu May 28 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm mid DevaCut right at this very moment, please tell me it will get better?  While cutting the guy basically finger combed out all my curls while he was cutting and my hair was super fluffy.  He did cut small chunks at a time, but rather than cutting individual curl clumps it was just small pieces with multiple curls, but it was hard to tell since they got pretty well separated as he was separating the pieces.  Please, someone tell me if this is normal?   I'm sitting in the dryer right now, after he cleansed my hair and clipped it I was really disappointed with how my curls looked, not as curly because there was no squishing.  He just raked the gel in and squished a little with his hands.  I'm so anxious right now, and this isn't cheap.  He also kinda scolded me for using a comb rather than just my fingers, I told him it was just too painful and took too much time.  Then when I get back in the chair he basically used a clip to kinda comb the front of my head which made my bags just swoop, barely any curl.  Then he commented that those don't really curl and I told him I get more curl than that usually and he seemed surprised.  I will update with a picture, and I'm hoping this gets better...  EDIT:  I was still feeling underwhelmed after, but I just put my hair up in a pineapple and noticed how much more even it is.  So, it wasn't a life changing haircut, but cutting it dry didn't leave everything as uneven as it normally is.  I don't think I'm going back to the salon though, I just didn't feel comfortable with the stylist..."
curlyhair,37l7g6,rebarex,7,Thu May 28 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"Kinda like any other haircut, not all DevaCuts are created equal, even though they are often expensive.   I live on Long Island, NY, and the first time I got a DevaCut, it was at a place that actually got good reviews! I was very underwhelmed. I felt the cut was mediocre at best and I was truly not impressed. I gave up on them for a while, and then decided to try stylist #2 at a different place, also receiving great reviews. My reaction? Again, it was meh. My curls looked limp and lacked volume after styling, and even after restyling at home, the cut just didn't make any real improvements.  But.. my current stylist, who has been my stylist for the last few years, is AMAZING. And, she has a great rate. She just does a fantastic job and is such a sweet woman. I wouldn't go to anyone else, and if she ever moved, I might actually cry.  So, it's kinda hit or miss. But I will say, that while I love my stylist so much, I don't love the way she actually styles my hair post-haircut. If you didn't feel comfortable at the salon then definitely don't feel liek you have to go back! But keep searching! Reading reviews, on both yelp and naturallycurly. Good luck!"
curlyhair,37l7g6,brattylilduck,1 point,Fri May 29 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"That is so good to hear!  I think there were a lot of things that just built into me having a disappointing experience.  There is one salon way on the other side of town that is well reviewed on naturallycurly, so I might check them out, especially since it is a curly only salon (well, I mean they might do others but it is called Curls Gone Wild, sooo...).  The one I went to was a large salon, there was a straight haired stylist (not the one who did my hair), who was telling me that I wasn't putting in enough condition of it hurt and took me a long time to finger comb my hair in the shower.  And the product pushing was overwhelming.  At one point I finally just was blatant and said I can't justify the cost when I have another product that works well for me and is $4 instead of $40."
curlyhair,37l7g6,rebarex,2,Fri May 29 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"Ahhh I HATE product pushing! My current salon uses only Deva products on their curly clients, but I've never been asked to buy anything. So I don't blame you for being turned off by that.  Definietly don't give up! :) It's hard to find a good stylist. My salon actually renamed itself to ""Curl Evolution"" because its curly clientele exploded after my stylist started getting good reviews on NaturallyCurly. A lot of the stylists in there are now ""trained"" to give Deva cuts - and its STILL hit or miss. I've left there with a badddd haircut when I couldn't get a last minute appointment with my regular girl.  You'll find someone :)"

She doesn't get it as curly as I do, and she also kind of ""fluffs it out"" when she cuts it and cuts bigger chunks and not necessarily individual curls. I guess it's to really see how much hair is there, to get it more even...? I don't know. Anyway I never like it so much on the way home (she also just kind of cleans it, throws in some gel, scrunches it a liiittle with a microfiber towel, then clipps it and drys it, then scrunches out the crunch a bit - or as she calls it, ""releases the curls"" lol). So it's underwhelming when she's done with it, but I always end up going back there because it grows out SO much better than cuts from normal salons that cut it wet, and when I style it myself it looks great. But yeah, just try a new stylist if you live somewhere with multiple people who advertise cutting curly hair dry!"

curlyhair,37l7g6,BecauseCaveCrickets2,2,Thu May 28 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"My hair is very thick but fine textured. I don't shampoo every time I work out, I just get it wet and scrub my scalp with my fingertips, and add conditioner as needed.  Your hair being thinner and oil being an issue, maybe try a very diluted shampoo, so you get clean without stripping so much moisture that it's damaging? If water alone isn't sufficient, I mean.  Edit to add: I'm down to shampooing about one every week and a half, cowashing every 2-3 days, so YMMV."
curlyhair,37l7g6,brattylilduck,1 point,Fri May 29 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"Your hair is probably oily because you're shampooing too much.  It's drying your hair out so you're scalp is trying to overcompensate by producing more oil.  I work out 5 days a week and I co-wash on workout days.  I use a very thin conditioner (Vo5) and scrub with my fingertips, then it's essential to fully rinse out this conditioner.  I use a different conditioner next as a ""rinse out"" but I rinse out about half, then squish to condish and put product in.    There is a transition period to no poo, and you can ease into it!  Get yourself a silicone free/sulfate free shampoo (Shea moisture is great and pretty easily available in the U.S.), and use that less and less.  I'm down to once a week.  Just give it a try for at least a few weeks and you will get there!"

For some reason I like the one with the brown label better than the one with the pink label (I can't remember their respective names), because I feel like the pink label one is a little heavier on the Shea.  That might just be me though!  I also want you to know that what to do with my hair after a workout was the first thing I furiously searched in this sub, because I had the same issue!  A lot of it was people saying they still didn't wet it, but I live in a darn desert and I sweat through any headband I'm wearing when I workout so I know my hair just gets full of sweat!"

I've been co-washing for 5 years, so that's a big help in transitioning to this method.  My question is this--how can I get a clean part without brushing? I used to brush my hair after showering, define my part, and then let it air dry. This left my hair wavy but not curly. Today I tried plopping, and I have some great curls, but my part is messy! I'm afraid I'll mess up my great new curls if I touch them too much.  I'm definitely going to buy some products today. Oh, another question! I don't have a car so I ride my bike everywhere. Tips for maintaining curls in spite of helmet and/or wind?"
curlyhair,37l7g6,brattylilduck,3,Thu May 28 20:42:29 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of just separate my curls into a part based on their curl clumps, so it ends up being a a zig zaggy part, but I think it really works for curly hair.  Your hair isn't straight, so your part doesn't need to be either!  But if you want a really straight part, part prior to plopping, and it will kinda stay that way.  Someone posted on here recently about helmet hair.  The verdict seemed to be that there's not a lot you can do about it, but someone had decent results with putting their hair in a silk scarf before the helmet."
curlyhair,37l7g6,BecauseCaveCrickets2,2,Fri May 29 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"I would part my hair in the shower with the showercomb, before squishing in conditioner. Then get out, add whatever gel I'm using and plop. The part will stay if you're careful when you bend over to tie the plop.  No idea on the helmet hair prevention, sorry. Maybe if you twist bits back, pin them, and then your helmet on top? But that won't keep the longer loose hair from frizzing. How long is it?"

curlyhair,37l7g6,mmm_cake,1 point,Fri May 29 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"my ends are the bane of my curly existence.  I had a devacut in Feb, I have trimmed them myself several times since, coat them in coconut oil once a week, S2C, CGM for washing no shampoo, slather them in leave in(shea mo), curl cream(devacurl), and gel(aussi instant freeze)..and yet still have this.  I know the bottom portion of my hair is very thin from some severe post parteum hairloss, but surely there is something I can do to get definition in the ends while I wait for my new growth?"
curlyhair,37l7g6,all_u_need_is_cheese,2,Fri May 29 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"I would just go for a shorter cut - bobs and long bobs are in right now anyway, and if you're treating it so well it's probably just damaged from before. :( It sucks but it'll probably feel good to just chop it off and have the whole length be healthy!  And on the plus side, shorter hair is harder for little fingers to grab? :)"
curlyhair,37l7g6,mmm_cake,1 point,Sat May 30 15:20:31 2015 UTC,"You are probably right. A few more inches off the ends would help, ive always been paranoid about going short because i have an apple head"

I think a lot of people actually do the wrong thing to my hair and cut it as though it were thicker just because it's curly. Layers totally destroy my hair!"

I've seen a lot of people mention it works great as a co-wash, but I was wondering if it was okay/safe to use as a leave-in. The whole ""tingle"" aspect makes me nervous with extended exposure."
curlyhair,37l7g6,unfunnypun,3,Sat May 30 16:25:45 2015 UTC,It should be totally safe. I think the tingle in products like that actually comes from peppermint oil....

curlyhair,37l7g6,71011,2,Sun May 31 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"Cowash like you would normally shampoo. I have a hard time getting conditioner to the middle of my scalp, so I'll push product in both from the forhead and the back of my neck. I'll also sometimes section out my hair, if I feel like I'm not actually distributing the conditioner to my entire scalp. Then you rinse everything out and you can condition or style as you normally would.  I think that it shouldn't wreck your curls any more than wetting in the shower or conditioning normally would."
curlyhair,37l7g6,unfunnypun,1 point,Sun May 31 00:47:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks! I've seen videos where people squish in their conditioner (even for cowashing, not S2C), and that's why I was wondering if I was doing something wrong."

But I just try to massage conditioner into my head so that I get a full coverage, leave it for a little (like half a minute sometimes) and then rinse it out. Sometimes I'll just add conditioner to the rest of my head all at once and then I only have to rinse it all once. My head usually feels pretty clean for a few days. But you'll find something that works for you, it's not always the same for everyone."
curlyhair,37l7g6,notrelatedtoamelia,1 point,Sun May 31 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"I looked for suggestions for lightweight products, but can't really find any on this sub, so here goes:  I'm not having problems with my hair in my current routine, but I feel like the products I use weigh it down too much if I just let it air dry and don't diffuse it. I don't always have access to my blow dryer or a diffuser, and even with clips, it falls down a lot.  I'm currently using:   VO5 moisture milk strawberries and cream for cowash Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Cowash Garnier fructis curl scrunch controlling gel   Also, is there a product swap somewhere? I got a deal on 2 for 1 shea moisture products a few weeks ago and bought the Shea Gel Souffle after reading somewhere that it's good for lightweight hair. I hate it, it never dries on my hair and leaves it feeling tacky and gummy and wet all day. If someone has used it and loves it, I can totally send it to them. They are like $10 each, afterall, and I don't want my money to go to waste.  Or a suggestion on how to use Shea Moisture Gel Souffle would be welcome as well!  If there isn't a product swap subreddit for curly hair, there definitely should be. I feel like we all have to experiment so much with products before finding the one that works for us, that it would be really really helpful on our wallets.  EDIT: I forgot to include my routine:    cowash with VO5,  S2C with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus,  squish out while rinsing, add more VO5, turn off water,  squeeze out excess water/conditioner in old tee,  plop for a bit with another old tee,  put in a dollop of garnier fructis curl scrunch controlling gel,  clip the part and some random spots for lift,  diffuse until damp, air dry the rest of the way"

My hair is only 2a so I don't know how I'll be able to really separate my curls in the shower and squish to condish. Any fellow 2as have any advice for me?

I heard coconut oil was a wonder product as a deep conditioner so I bought it and put it on my hair and slept with it in a shower cap and in the morning it felt dry and straw like! I thought maybe it was the one off so 2 weeks later I tried it again and it still felt very dry and didn't make my hair feel good. It's pure coconut oil. Am I doing something wrong?
curlyhair,37jy41,banananagirl,3,Thu May 28 04:16:24 2015 UTC,what's your routine?!
curlyhair,37jy41,super_tr00per,1 point,Thu May 28 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, after much trial and error, here is my exact routine:  I have fine, light hair that is prone to frizz, and it loses its curl by the end of the day, turning into a soft blob, if I don't follow these steps.   Shampoo and condition as normal with Trader Joe's tea tree shampoo and conditioner. After putting in conditioner, comb through hair with a pick to detangle. Rinse out as normal, squeeze out most of the water in my hair. Combine a tiny amount of AG Fast Food Leave-In Conditioner and a half-dollar sized glop of LA Natural Styling Gel in my hands, and flip hair upside down. Run product through my hair, combing with my fingers. Scrunch at the ends, squeezing out as much water as possible. With head still upside down, plop my hair into a long t-shirt (look up what plopping is online- SUPER easy, and this is coming from someone clueless with hair). Plop for as long as I can. Then take hair out of t-shirt and scrunch the crunchiness out of my hair.    I know this sounds like a lot of work, but it REALLY isn't, and I get great results from it every single day!"
curlyhair,37my3h,SiriusMatter,6,Thu May 28 20:29:26 2015 UTC,"Overnight coconut treatments are fine, but you may be using too much as you shouldn't need to shampoo twice. Coconut oil gets absorbed by the hair, but you still have so much left over you have to wash twice - that is over kill.   Eggs are a protein treatment. If it is off, your hair might not like so much protein."
curlyhair,37my3h,chocomax,1 point,Thu May 28 22:18:26 2015 UTC,"eggs work more as a protien treatment, which can make your hair more dry/crunchy. shampooing twice to get rid of oil is fine, as long as you dont do it everyday"
curlyhair,37lg2t,onerandomday,2,Thu May 28 14:09:11 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right to me. When I think back to all the websites that showcase haircuts/styles, ""Long"" is typically past the shoulder--it would make sense that ""Extra long"" is considered mid-back, aka bra strap length.  I did a quick google search and found this.  While I doubt there are any hard and fast rules for this sort of thing, it does give validity to your stylist's determination."
curlyhair,37lg2t,jgonz85,1 point,Thu May 28 19:26:30 2015 UTC,That's funny - I just never think of myself having long hair lol
curlyhair,37lg2t,empress-of-blandings,1 point,Thu May 28 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"I would call back and ask for clarification. Maybe somehow she came away thinking bra strap was your curly legnth somehow? If it turns out everything is accurate just say ""oh okay, thank you I just wanted to make sure"" no one will think twice about it."
curlyhair,37k5xz,agentsmudge724,4,Thu May 28 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"You hair is greasy because you shampoo. Your scalp over produces oil  because the shampoo is too harsh and over drys out your scalp.   There might be 2-4 week adjustment period, but after you adjust you will have less grease - not more.   Edit to add: You can slowly ease into it. Use the lowpoo/nopoo (you could have either without brand or ingredients I don't know.) shampoo you have and use the regular shampoo only when you absolutely must. Then slowly stop the regular shampoo (but do try to stop as soon as you can) then slowly add in co washing and reduce the lowpoo/nopoo."
curlyhair,37k5xz,oe_leiderhosen,3,Thu May 28 06:54:10 2015 UTC,"You could try co-washing at least once just to see how you do, but you can totally go with a sulfate-free shampoo no probnlem.  I have fine hair and I don't want to overload it with moisture, so I just use this shampoo on my scalp and let the act of rinsing run the shampoo over the length of my hair.  Keeps my locks clean and moisturized. :D"
curlyhair,37k5xz,lll___lll,3,Thu May 28 05:55:58 2015 UTC,"I recommend using the summer to transition to co-washing. It can take a while, and you may not want to leave the house if you're really self-conscious. By the time school starts back up your hair will be normal and look better just from ditching shampoo."
curlyhair,37k5xz,slewov,2,Thu May 28 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"I use shampoo about twice a week.  The days in between, I cowash.  It's because I have hard water and need to cleanse my hair from the mineral build up.  Just try out cowashing, and if it doesn't work, go back to shampooing until you figure something out.  No harm in experimenting!"

Go out and get Shimmering Lights shampoo (I know, I know) by Clairol. It's a toning shampoo that will get rid of any brass and yellow in the hair and lightens it perfectly. Seriously. My tips are like beachy blonde. This stuff is magic.  However, word of warning, never leave it on for too long (more than 45 min) as it will actually deposit a bit of colour.

curlyhair,37h1ow,thisisallme,3,Thu May 28 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"Sure! I cut out straightening and blow drying cold turkey so that may help you if you still use heat to style. I take my showers at night because my hair is very long and takes ages to dry.  My routine:   Use Yes To Carrots shampoo only on my scalp, rubbing my scalp with my fingerpads. I shampoo daily because Im not ready to go without shampooing yet and it reduces product buildup, I havent found a routine that reduces frizz/gives me the definition I want so I like to start fresh every day. (Also I don't want to have greasy scalp in case I mess up my routine because I wont have time to fix it before work in the morning) Use Tresemme naturals liberally throughout my hair, detangling with fingers. Rinse out 3/4 of the conditioner in cold water. I was doing S2C for a few days, but I have been going without the past few to see if it reduces frizz, so for now I just leave my hair sopping wet. Comb in Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner with fingers Scrunch in Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Smoothie and the Styling Milk (I've been playing around with 50-50, just one and just the other, 75-25 split, etc to see what gives the best results) Spray with Jamacian Black Castor Oil frizz control spray Scrunch in gel (I think it's Garnier Fructis but I'm not positive - I can give you the name when I get home) All of the above were done while my hair is sopping wet, so now I use a microfiber towel and scrunch my hair more to take out extra water (Ive been doing this instead of S2C to see if it reduces frizz, it seems to reduce some but Im not sure if that's because of applying in this order or if I'm just getting better at using the products) Flip my hair over my head and plop using a cotton t shirt overnight Today was my first morning using a spray bottle with water to dampen my hair some (my hair is usually still damp but air dries omw to work) to reapply more product in the morning. Today I sprayed my hair, used the styling milk to redefine some areas, and then used a bit more gel on my scalp to try to contain frizz and scrunched a bit more in the bottoms of my curls (it doesnt seem crunchy yet but im not sure as I havent looked in the mirror since it dried)   I'm including an imgur album with my first week or so on CG (there's only a few pictures, each is spaced a few days apart). The first was no heat styling, no products, just S2C with the conditioner I had before throwing everything out and starting fresh. The second is about 2-3 days in, and the last one is a day or two after the middle one. Here's the album. If you have any other questions about my routine feel free to ask!  Edited for formatting."

curlyhair,37de31,_Personage,2,Wed May 27 05:38:30 2015 UTC,"For the products I don't wash out: I tend to use quite a lot of the Fructis, but my hair just drinks that stuff and I don't put it near the roots. I probably use about a tablespoon of the Curl Creme, maybe a little less. It only tends to get crunchy if you put too much on one curl, but that stuff is great because you can just squish the afflicted curl and it goes away, but keeps the shape. The Frizz Ease can be a little bit heavy and greasy, but I'll use one pump, rub it between my hands for about 30 seconds, scrunch it into the left hand side and back of the upside down hair then repeat for the right and front bit.  I do have quite a lot of hair though, as you can see."

curlyhair,37jqw2,is2gstop,1 point,Thu May 28 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"My routine is pretty random and haphazard, to be honest. I brush my hair out before getting in the shower. I shampoo once or twice a week with Renpure Argan Oil shampoo. When I shampoo I use an OGX deep conditioner as well as the matching Renpure conditioner. I comb through the conditioner with a wide toothed comb while in the shower and then rinse. Afterwards, I apply Argan oil and flax seed gel and plop. When I don't shampoo, I do everything the same just without washing.  I know many people say not to brush or even comb, but I feel like my hair is just too tangly to get away with it. Any modifications you think I should make would be much appreciated!"
curlyhair,37jqw2,is2gstop,2,Thu May 28 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing the squish to condish method with the deep conditioner after the renpure one, that might help. It'll also get the curls off your head so you can massage the gel closer towards the roots without breaking the clumping. Also, what are you plopping with?"
curlyhair,37jqw2,is2gstop,1 point,Fri May 29 07:23:14 2015 UTC,I am plopping with a cotton long sleeved shirt. I'll try squish to condish! Thanks!

curlyhair,37i2dt,last_fartbender,6,Wed May 27 20:08:38 2015 UTC,"Try doing a deep treatment and coating the length of your hair with conditioner (not on your scalp) before you shampoo. This should help protect your hair while cleaning your scalp. Alternatively, use coconut oil on your hair and then shampoo - the oil will help protect your hair from the drying shampoo. Look up ""pre-pooing"" for more info. Also make sure you are scrubbing your scalp with shampoo, but NOT running it into the legnth of your hair. The run off from your scalp is enough to clean your hair, it doesn't have to be massages in."

The amount of info can be overwhelming when you need a very specific answer, and don't even know what to look for.   Good luck, my deep conditioner of choice is CurlJunkie Curl Rehab, or the same brands Repair Me if you need protein. A couple deep treatments in the following days after you shampoo should make it spring right back into shape quicker is it's still dry despite pre-pooing."
curlyhair,37i2dt,BaroquenRecorder,3,Wed May 27 23:45:38 2015 UTC,"Your post rang a bell with me when you said ""it takes up to a week for it to regain its true curliness"". That's me when I shampoo. So, maybe your scalp is ""insanely dry"" because of the shampooing. Try co-washing daily. That is what does the trick for me. I've been on here for about 6 months now and have experimented with different products and techniques. But what has become pretty clear is that:   my hair would rather not be washed  my hair LOVES conditioner (I don't even wash it out any more)   Get some good silicone free conditioner. I use Tresseme Naturals. It's easy to find and it's cheap. Co-wash every day, giving your scalp a good massage. Try squish-to-condish (don't rinse all the conditioner out) and ditch the towel for a t-shirt.  It takes a week or so for your hair and scalp to adjust but then it's all up from there! Good luck!"

curlyhair,37h47h,pennypenny22,8,Wed May 27 16:20:22 2015 UTC,100 hairs a day is the average. You're noticing more in the shower because it isn't coming out through brushing or combing. Unless you're noticing thinning patches (meaning that replacement hair isn't coming through) you're fine. :)

curlyhair,37h47h,crowshow,5,Thu May 28 01:16:42 2015 UTC,"I think the average is 100 hairs per day, but it can also look like more if your hair is long due to the hairs doubling over on each other. If you notice it starts to feel thinner or look more limp that may be a sign something is awry since its really difficult to keep track of how much hair your shedding each day."
curlyhair,37h47h,081890,1 point,Wed May 27 16:56:36 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. My hair is down past the bottom of my rib cage and I didn't take that into account. I haven't noticed any thinning patches or anything so I'm probably good.

It's mostly because I started using a wide-tooth comb to detangle my hair in the shower, and then no brushing or combing once I'm out. It's made a huge difference in the touchability of my hair, and my curls stay more defined. I haven't noticed my hair getting thinner, but I know that I'm snapping it off all over the place because the knots get so bad they just rip out.  But yeah, you're fine :)"

curlyhair,37gnm4,philosotea,3,Wed May 27 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"My hair canopy gets frizzy and dry, unless i use ton's of leave-in and product.   My hair is wavy and very fine, so I have to be careful applying heavy products, but it's super dry so I need heavy products.  I rinse out most of my conditiner in the shower, then apply a heavy leave-in while my hair is soaking wet, but i try to avoid the roots. I next apply a moisturizing curl cream along the length of my hair. If I stop here, I will look like a grease-ball. My hair is still soaking wet, and if it's not I spray more water on it, and I then apply a hard-hold gel. The gel helps define the waves and curls, but most of all keeps the leave-in and curl cream from looking greasy.  I also have to apply these products to soaking wet hair or it will get frizzy.   When do you brush your hair? I detangle with the wide tooth comb while my hair is covered in conditioner in the shower."
curlyhair,37gnm4,Curly_Alice,1 point,Wed May 27 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"I brush it as soon as I get out of the shower, while it's still sopping wet."
curlyhair,37gnm4,imonfirex727,3,Wed May 27 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"If you're doing that, then you'd be breaking up the curl clumps and not letting them form as well. But, this is akin to using the ""rake and shake"" method for prepping your curls (see Youtube tutorials) because with rake and shake you end up finger combing (raking) through your hair with gel and then shaking it to have the curl come out.  But if you've got nothing else in your hair after your shower aside from any left over conditioner after rinsing it out or leave in conditioner, then you probably don't have a lot of product in your curls after you get out of the shower to prevent them from frizzing up (conditioners help with moisture, gel helps keep form/prevent frizz).   You can try a different curl shaping/forming method in the shower like ""squish to condish"" (also see Youtube, plenty of tutorials available - sorry I'm at work on my lunch break and can't link) that doesn't break up your curls after your shower.   But I would definitely suggest a gel to try and keep the curl-form and prevent frizz. Try a different gel than the one you have if you don't like it.   Like /u/Curly_Alice said for her hair, my hair also misbehaves when I don't have any product in it. The curls turn to waves that won't stick together and oh the frizz! Same for me on detangling too - I shampoo, then detangle with plenty of conditioner (a cheaper kind than my leave-in because I'm just going to rinse most of it out - Suave Naturals), then rinse that out and put in my leave in conditioner and gel while I'm still in the shower and my hair is sopping wet and squish both into my hair (I do squish to condish, aka S2C). Then I get out and use a cotton t-shirt to squish the extra water out and plop for 15 minutes then air dry or plop overnight. I hope this helped a bit! Good luck!"

I know that it is very thick, very long but I don't know what the curl pattern is. It never gets greasy but it does get very matted easily if not dealt with and it frizzes up quite easily without proper management too.  Current routine: garnier ultimate blends sleek restorer shampoo  and conditioner once a week (never washed my hair more often than this). Coconut oil when my hair as air dried (otherwise it looks weird) and when necessary. Often every few days I'll put a blob in my hair.  Never blow dry or straighten it.

curlyhair,37c1rd,BootyfullUnicorns,11,Tue May 26 14:58:53 2015 UTC,"Co-wash! Switching from sulfate free shampoo to no shampoo was the best decision ever. The frizz has finally been tamed! I'm now washing with Suave Naturals conditioner, conditioning with and leaving in Tresemme Perfectly Undone, then adding LA Looks Extreme Sport gel. Working pretty well for me! The biggest difference was when I ditched the shampoo and started leaving in gobs and gobs of the Tresemme. My hair has never been this soft, and put together looking in its natural state."
curlyhair,37c1rd,Fire-Kissed,5,Tue May 26 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the tip! I'm so ready to ditch my shampoo out of the window, and I'm glad to hear that it has worked for you. I'm still pretty nervous, but I guess you'll never know before you try...!"
curlyhair,37c1rd,Fire-Kissed,3,Tue May 26 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I was too. I was so afraid of grease-ball city on my scalp. I was so incredibly happy when that never happened. YMMV, obviously, but making sure I rinsed all the conditioner from my scalp was what made sure my roots stayed looking fresh and clean. Best decision everrrrr."
curlyhair,37c1rd,defectivepopsicle,6,Wed May 27 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"Good lord we are hair sisters! A lot of people are suggesting co-wash, which I definitely suggest you try. However, I switch between the two, using a sulfate-free shampoo every four days. My hair gets gross up by the roots if I completely ditch my shampoo.   I've been using Jessicurl Cleansing Cream as my “shampoo"" because it's more of a mix between shampoo and conditioner. It won't strip the oils from your hair like most lathering shampoos. Then I completely cover my hair with their Too-Shea conditioner, let sit for 5 minutes, rinse. Then ALL the leave in conditioners! I start with Biolage ExquisiteOil which gives my hair shine and controls frizz and humidity (I have suuuuper porous hair), then I use Jessicurl Rockin Ringlets, followed by a mixture of Brocato Curl Cream, Jessicurl Confident Coils, and just a tad bit of my conditioner for extra humid days. I put all this in with my head upside down before I get out of the shower (water is turned off). The wetter your hair the better. Then I use gel (Biolage Blue Agave) to form and pin curls on top of my head instead of plopping. Then I just let them air dry.   This works for me, but it took YEARS to find products that my hair likes. I'm pretty religious about Jessicurl. I tried less expensive alternatives, but my curls didn't look as good. Currently I have spiral curls, which NEVER happened before Jessicurl. It took two months of it, but now I'll never leave. My advice is to try everything at least twice, and you'll find the perfect routine for you."
curlyhair,37c1rd,all_u_need_is_cheese,3,Tue May 26 17:55:09 2015 UTC,pin curls on top of my head   Please explain! :)
curlyhair,37c1rd,fortunatevoice,3,Tue May 26 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP but I do this sometimes so I googled a pic of what I do to show you. Sort of like this but I do mine far more loose because sometimes I'd rather have manageable waves than massive curls. :)  edit: I guess I should write an explanation too lol. I wrap my hair around my finger in a spiral and pin. I can't explain it without sounding obvious, though it is pretty easy! The problem I have with it is that it takes forever to dry sometimes."
curlyhair,37c1rd,defectivepopsicle,2,Wed May 27 00:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah! So basically rub the gel into my palms, run my hands down a section of my hair, twist the section around my finger really tightly all the way up to the roots, slide it off my finger being sure to keep them coiled, then take a bobby pin and attach them flat to the top of my head.   I'm basically mirroring this (sorry on mobile and can't hyperlink): http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/images/CRW_8640_SBS3_250h.jpg      Then I let sit for an hour or two and take them down. Plus if you make a headwrap they can actually look super cute, which beats wearing a shirt in your head in public. It gives me more control than plopping, but still lifts the roots and prevents me from touching it and breaking the curls up."
curlyhair,37c1rd,all_u_need_is_cheese,1 point,Wed May 27 04:20:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah I was wondering if you meant all together or separately. This might be really good for my hair, plopping gives me absolutely no root volume and weirdly flattens my curls, especially the ones on the bottom. At first I thought my hair was too short to plop, but it's past my shoulders now so I don't think that's the issue. I have very fine hair so maybe it just crushes it too much. Usually I prop up my roots with little duckbill clips while it air dries to get some root volume, but I'll try this too, it sounds great for days when I have more time!"
curlyhair,37c1rd,_ChipSkylark,6,Wed May 27 09:08:06 2015 UTC,"Gel helped me a lót.  I co-wash, comb through my hair upside down, shake it loose so you have slightly thick clusters of hair, then comb through some ge all over when it's still soaking wet. Plop until it's still a bit clustered and then air dry."

I wash her hair twice a week at night with baby shampoo, then a CG friendly conditioner that I use, air dry. I do some shea moisture leave in, wet with a water and comb to style in the mornings.  Thats it. This is the result.  She has hair at birth that would curl up when wet, but the true ringlets started when it was long enough to show, past the bottom of her skull.

Once it twice a week a quick shampoo with baby shampoo, once or twice a month my daughter gets an overnight coconut oil scalp treatment for her dandruff (I've started doing this for myself too and it wipes the dandruff out quick!). After shampooing they get a good spray of my homemade leave in conditioner/detangler (VO5 conditioner $. 99 stuff, nothing special, and not measured exactly with warm water in a bottle for spraying). We use a boars hair brush which my daughter calls the gentle brush, combs cause tears with my two. Let air dry and go!"
curlyhair,37c8ew,PreposterousMurmur,1 point,Tue May 26 22:51:00 2015 UTC,"this is my daughter (she will be 2 in a few months).  http://imgur.com/ONmeTKr once her ringlets appeared i started ""caring"" for them.  i got my advice from this sub actually.  i just wash her as usual with baby shampoo (maybe twice a week).  i condition her hair after her bath and comb it through with a wide toothed comb.  i spray her with water and re-condition her hair every morning.  she absolutely destroys her hair when she is sleeping, so she wakes up from her nap looking like a crazy person.  i just leave it.  sometimes i spray it with water and comb it out again...but usually i just let her look like einstein.  as she gets older i'll add more elements to her ""routine"" as seems reasonable.  but i am VERY conscious of not ever (ever) saying to her ""don't do that you'll wreck your hair!"" (she loves to put on hats, and it does wreck her hair).  i want her to be a kid.  when she's older she can decide what she wants to do. my son has the same hair, but we shave his head.  he has been allowed to grow it out (he's not yet 4) and then i have cared for his hair in the same way...but inevitably it just gets a bit much and he gives up (last time he grew it it was because he wanted pig tails like his sister, but he never made it, it annoyed him too much).  he really hates having his hair combed out and sprayed, where his sister will sit pretty well."

I lob for 5-15 minutes to get all of the extra water out that weighs down my curls. After then I put in some organ oil curl creme. I take a dime size drop, flip my head upside down and massage it into my hair. I really focus on coating the top of my head, the face framing curls and the tips. Once the product is all in I scrunch for 2-3 minutes, cupping the curls to my crown, then scrunching at the root 5-6 times. This last part is what has made the biggest difference for me.

curlyhair,37dhv6,jgonz85,2,Tue May 26 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"First, your cut looks great! :)  So, your hair looks quite different to mine, but I'll tell you what I would try. So definitely stick with the no-poo/co-wash, then detangle with conditioner in. I wouldn't bother with sectioning, I would just flip my head over and scrunch in the shower with super wet hair to make the curls form. I sometimes do this with conditioner still in my hair, you can try scrunching with handfulls of water to get most of the conditioner out, this will really make the curls form. Then apply product and squeeze gently with a t-shirt or microfiber towel (head still upside down this whole time), finally flip gently right-side up and put in the clips for root volume and let it air dry. I usually dry mine quite a bit with the t-shirt, I think this gives me more volume although it does give a bit of frizz which I try to tame by smoothing a little argan oil over my crown when it's mostly dry. You could also diffuse the whole thing upside down instead of air drying with clips after squeezing with the t-shirt if you really need to make the whole routine faster. I can't do this because my scalp is quite dry and it'll give me a flaky scalp (yuck!) but usually I take out the clips before my hair is TOTALLY dry and just leave the house and let it finish drying on my way to work, and scrunch out the crunch at work. :) You could also plop instead of diffusing/air drying with clips in (this doesn't work for my hair at ALL but it does for many people!). You'll find something that works, just keep testing things! :)"
curlyhair,37dhv6,all_u_need_is_cheese,1 point,Wed May 27 09:27:43 2015 UTC,WOW! Looks great!!
curlyhair,37dhv6,081890,1 point,Thu May 28 00:21:36 2015 UTC,"The frizz you're getting at the crown is likely due to lack of product. It takes some experimenting to get the amount right, but it's a combo of leave-in conditioner plus styler (gel or creme, your choice). I find that the upside-down product applying doesn't work for me because of exactly that... my lengths are OK, but my crown and canopy end up lacking and then frizz out.      Your hair looks similar to mine, although I have thin rather than average thickness... do you have fine hair also? Here's my routine, if it helps - or even can give you something to play around with.    Shower: Shampoo or co-wash, and comb/detangle with conditioner in my hair. Rinse excess conditioner from my scalp, then squish-to-condish (S2C). Ring as much water out of my hair as I can... my hair is still wet of course, just no longer sopping wet. Products: Part my hair in two, over each shoulder. Lean to one side and apply leave-in liberally, raking it through my hair. Yes, this separates the curl clumps (more on this later). I apply it from ends to just above my ears, and after that, give a small dab up at the crown. Next, apply styler (I'm still experimenting whether gels, cremes, or custards work best). Again, rake it through my hair. Preparation: Section my hair into a few pieces, and twist them thoroughly. Imagine I now have a couple dreadlocks. This helps my hair get back its curl formation, despite having broken it up with all the product application. Plop in a shirt for 45 minutes while I'm doing my other morning routine. Which now includes hopping back in the shower for a few seconds to rinse off product that hit my face/shoulders while applying =) Finish: The last thing I do is release the plop, right before I leave. I scrunch maybe 3 times with the t-shirt afterwards, to get a bit more water out and mimic the effect of S2C, and clip my hair up at the roots. My hair takes about 2 hours to dry, then I scrunch-out-the-crunch with some defrizzer on my hands.    PS - excellent cut, you look great!"

For the first month or two I would towel dry, brush, and comb on occasion if I thought it was needed. At the time I didn't know my hair was curly (thought it was still just wavy like when I was in grade school because that's what it looked like) and it was ridiculously dry. I didn't know how to take care of it.  It's been about ten months since then. I stopped brushing after I noticed it made my hair frizzy, which was probably about 3 months in. My hair is healthy now. It retains moisture, it's softer, and it's a lot less prone to breakage.  If your hair is damaged stop brushing, towel drying, and use the right products and your hair will repair itself."

You might also try a leave in conditioner as well, either alone or in conjunction with another cream. A leave-in will make your curls softer and less frizzy, but doesn't usually have any hold...so it may work for you. A lot of curly hair is trial and error because no two curls are alike."

curlyhair,3783h8,owlvsdove,9,Mon May 25 17:28:30 2015 UTC,"TL;DR I bought AG Recoil Curl Activator and it's the bees knees. Please ignore my stupid crown cowlick that makes it look like a weird bald spot  I recently worked for seven months at a store that sold professional haircare, including AG. Before going CG (as much as possible) I had used AG's Details cream and then stopped when I realized the silicone content... for some reason I got confused and thought that the Curl Activator had 'cones too. A few days before my last shift, I noticed someone on here say that the curl activator was okay to use so I checked asap. Lo and behold, I bought it, and I am in love.   I should add that this is what my hair looks like after I slept on it, and went to class and back on a rainy humid 25 degree day. There isn't perfect clumping and there is some frizz but to be honest I kind of prefer it that way. My hair is so fine that if it clumped perfectly I'd have like five curls on my whole head, so!  My routine for anyone that cares: * Shampoo: Either Tres Emme Naturals Radiant Volume Shampoo, or Live Clean (Fresh Water) Moisturizing Shampoo * Conditioner: Tres Emme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner, sometimes mixed with Live Clean Coconut Milk Moisturizing Conditioner (I usually use the latter as a leave-in as it is on the thin side consistency-wise). * Product: Either AG Recoil Curl Activator, Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Scrunching Gel, or Ion Curl Spray Gel from Sally's. * Method: Comb through conditioner in the shower. Part hair and S2C rather lazily. My hair is not dripping, but it still squishes when I then scrunch in my product du jour. It's not always the same, but now that I'm loving the Recoil I think it may stay more the same... I plop with a tshirt for as long as convenient and then diffuse til 80% dry, sometimes all the way as dry as possible if I really have somewhere to be where I don't want wet or crunchy hair.

curlyhair,3783h8,eraser-dust,1 point,Mon May 25 21:51:21 2015 UTC,I think maybe I just suck at evenly distributing any product that isn't sprayed. Mousse is a disaster for me. Maybe some of the problem is I can't run my fingers through my hair at all or else it straightens completely? I have to scrunch it all in and then I feel like just the pieces around my face (even though I flip my hair upside down to do it) and the ends get all crunchy and no other hair gets product. :-/

If I do ""rake"" the product through, I have to be super diligent about scrunching with my hands and my tshirt before I plop. The tshirt really makes a difference."

I wonder if  I can find the AG curl activator around where I live.  I'm almost out of my Shea Moisture gel and want to try something new."
curlyhair,378s2t,gothicpretzel,16,Mon May 25 20:22:40 2015 UTC,I have yet to see a hair stylist who even knew what plopping or the CG method was- sorely disappointed in the level of knowledge out there among supposed professionals :-/
curlyhair,378s2t,la_capitana,11,Tue May 26 01:08:59 2015 UTC,"Everything I know about curls I had to seek out on my own, outside of school. I was in school just at the very end of the ""everything must be sleek and straight"" trend that can die in hell forever. I immediately pursued Deva training, and it gave me a huge leg up on handling curls over anything I'd ever had in school. A lot of schools are run by or have exclusive contracts with brands that are anti-CG (Redken, Sebastian, Paul Mitchell, etc.) so it's not in their best interest to train students to go against the company chemists' formulation. There are also incredibly few professional brands that are CG friendly, I have trouble finding products that I would be comfortable retailing that available exclusively to salons (for quality control, to prevent diversion) that aren't DevaCurl. It's seriously hard to find education that isn't ""Slap some silicone on it and call it a day."" because there just aren't very many professional resources for CG training."
curlyhair,378s2t,hurrdresser,2,Tue May 26 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"Is Deva training very expensive?  I have a friend who is a great stylist, but I'm going in to someone else for my first DevaCut.  I was considering suggesting this friend get Deva trained because I would much rather pay him than someone else, plus, the salon I'm going to is very high prices because of its location and I think he could charge slightly less and get some of their business.  I know he has travelled for other training, his salon is B.B. mostly and he has gone to NYC for training there.  Would it be rude for me to suggest this to him?  I already have referred many clients to him, my dad is now a regular for him, and my brother in law goes to him whenever his regular stylist is out of town.  What's the best way for me to suggest he check out Deva Training?"
curlyhair,378s2t,brattylilduck,3,Tue May 26 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"It is pretty expensive, especially for independent stylists because we're paying for all our own stuff. If he's an employee of the salon, he may be able to ask the salon and they may even pay for his education because it's in their best interest. Though, depending on their contracts, they may not be allowed to do that. I live in a big city so Deva came through with an all day class that I took. It was seven hours of hands-on with two instructors. I would kill to go to the NYC training at the academy, there are several different training options like highlighting and session styling (styling for photography/modeling/film). I don't get my hair cut in my salon by the other stylists there because the Deva style is how I get my hair cut and I like you but this particular method works best for my needs. I would just propose it to him that way, like, hey I've found this amazing method that meets my needs, and if you had this training I would come to you, too. Any good stylist should be seeking out education regularly, I don't think it would be at all rude or poorly received to recommend the training."
curlyhair,378s2t,hurrdresser,8,Tue May 26 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"There are two reasons for this: We're taught to be cautious and scared of curly hair. Also with the time frame you're in school and a big, broad- not everyone is the same- subject of curly hair, it's hard to teach. Along with not many curly haired people come into a cosmetology school for services. So even if you were taught everything there is to know about curls, you couldn't put into practice without the experience."
curlyhair,378s2t,Dyingsanart,2,Tue May 26 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"A while back, I went to a training salon, and I remember that while the student was quite composed (she said she was nearly through her program), the teacher spent more time with her/me than with others.    It wasn't until the end that she let out a huge sign of relief and told me I was the first curly head she's worked on.  edit- punctuation"
curlyhair,378s2t,Arya_Ready,3,Tue May 26 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"The stylists who know about these things are going to be only in high end salons. Curly education is something a stylists puts him or herself through after cosmetology school. Just because you pay a lot doesn't mean that the stylist uses that money for education either. Some stylists feel entitled to money even though their level of education doesn't quite fit what they are charging. But don't be rude and call them ""so-called professionals"" because they don't cut curly hair. I work with a stylist who makes between 150 and 200 thousand dollars a year. She cuts curly hair the conventional way. That doesn't make her a bad professional because curly hair isn't her forte. Long story short: research any stylist you plan to go to before you go and you'll end up with less disappointment."

So I would reccomend no because it would ruin all natural curl you have going. Your best bet would be to get a haircut and go hard with the curly girl method! I highly highly reccomend pure argan oil as a light daily leave in conditioner as well as a leave in."

curlyhair,379n5g,brattylilduck,3,Tue May 26 14:47:25 2015 UTC,"Search Amazon for organic Argan oil or pure Argan oil. They are expensive, so I would just mix a few drops into your leave-in conditioner."

I have hair that goes mid-back, and I usually use about a tsp (6 pumps or so?) After every shower, and a few pumps throughout the day/week as I feel is needed."
curlyhair,3791qz,brinana_629,4,Mon May 25 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on the stylist/salon you go to. If you find a salon or stylist who specialize in curly hair they will cut your hair dry, curl by curl (this technique is often called a Deva Cut on this sub, but there are stylists who dry cut that aren't affiliated with Deva). Of course, your hair would need to be its natural curly self and not straightened for a dry cut. The salon near me wants the hair to be washed/co-washed that day and completely dry for the appointment (no second-day hair, no towel turban drying, not pulled back or tucked behind the ears).  A dry cut is great because the stylist can see how your hair falls naturally, so they can cut the curls in a way that looks good for each curl structure. Just call around the salons in your area and ask them if they specialize in cutting curly hair and if they do dry cuts. A dry cut is anywhere from $40-$80, depending on the stylist, area, and if the hair is matted (as a 2c/3a you shouldn't worry about that last bit).  After the dry cut, the stylist will wash your hair and then style it how you want. If they ask about round brushing or blow out, tell them no (although I doubt they would do those if they are curly friendly). It's your hair and you are paying them a large chunk of money. You should leave with happy hair. Try requesting a hood dryer (the ones from the '50s) and/or ask them to use a diffuser to help dry your hair.  Also, it's not bad to cut your own hair. There are tutorials online on how to dry cut your own curly hair."
curlyhair,3791qz,what_the_foxhat,1 point,Tue May 26 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advice! I have heard of the Deva Cut salons before and honestly just assumed that there wouldn't be one in my city.. however, I just happened to find one online. If I made an appointment for there, they would surely give me proper instructions on how to wear my hair I assume.  What if I went to a regular salon, though? Sounds like $40-$80 just for a cut is a bit too pricey for me at this point."
curlyhair,3791qz,what_the_foxhat,1 point,Tue May 26 00:18:57 2015 UTC,"You'd have to call the regular salon to see if they'd do a dry cut. I'm assuming you're thinking of a $20 haircut salon (Great Clips, Fantastic Sams?). A place like that might not know how to do it, but it wouldn't hurt to call and ask. If they don't seem to know what you're talking about when you mention a dry cut, then I wouldn't go.  The local salon I go to charges $45 for a dry cut. They are NOT a Deva salon, but they DO specialize in curly hair and advocate the Curly Girl method seen in this sub. Deva salons usually charge closer to $60-$80 because they are a branded salon, focused on selling their brand.  Paying the extra money for a dry cut is worth it IMO. A cheap salon is going to give you a cheap cut because most likely they have been trained to do cheaper cut meant for straight hair.  If you really can't spare the extra money for a dry cut, I highly suggest looking up some tutorials online on doing it yourself. Here is a video to get you started. (Note: I have never done this! Do some research--watch a bunch of videos. And remember: if you make a mistake, it WILL grow back)"

I'm trying my best to make good decisions about my hair, but there is only so much I can interpret from the confusing online descriptions of my hair/curl type. I also don't want to ask too many dumb questions on reddit :P Thank you for your help and I'll use videos until I can get to a curl-friendly salon."

curlyhair,377ovb,CB007,3,Mon May 25 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"Silicones do help with shine, yes, but it's artificial. Basically they add a coating to your hair, which seals out other products from penetrating your strands. Some 'cones are water-soluble and can wash right out, but the most common ones in conditioners don't, and require sulfate shampoos to get rid of them.  The only time I use cones now is if I'm straightening, since it takes a lot to control the frizz and I'll be washing all the products out afterwards anyway.

curlyhair,373xuk,thoroughbred_ofsin,7,Sun May 24 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And I'm keeping it simple since I just started out with CG but: - Shampoo every other day with Shea Moisture Moisture Retention - Condition with Tresemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner (I like to let the conditioner sit in my hair for around 5 minutes, then comb it out and rinse like 3/4 of it out of my hair) - Apply Kinky Curly Curling Custard while my hair is still dripping wet and squish upwards to enhance my curls and remove some water - Remove any excess water with a cotton tshirt, and let it air dry (I tried plopping for a few weeks and I prefer this method a lot more.)"
curlyhair,373xuk,dragonscantfly,13,Sun May 24 18:59:26 2015 UTC,Kinky Curly Curling Custard   I hope whoever named this product got a raise for it. So good.
curlyhair,373xuk,thoroughbred_ofsin,2,Mon May 25 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"Dude I do almost the same thing! I shampoo with Shea Conditioning Shampoo, condition with Tresemme Naturals and comb through with my hands, then plop in a microfiber towel and air dry. I've considered getting some products to put in after but I have very fine hair and am scared it'll weigh my hair down. Already on the second day my hair feels weighed down and slightly greasy."
curlyhair,373xuk,kaitlynx6,2,Sun May 24 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"How do you like the Tresemme Naturals? I've been browsing for a new conditioner and after looking at reviews of this on Target.com, a lot of people said the formula was changed and left their hair super dry, but before they LOVED it. Made me hesitant to buy"
curlyhair,373xuk,Bredul,1 point,Mon May 25 03:28:12 2015 UTC,"I remember buying a bottle probably 3 years ago but all I remembered was that I really liked the scent. After I used up that bottle I never repurchased until about a month ago when I started following CG (saw it on the list of CG-approved products in the sidebar) and it seems to be working well for me! It's not very thick, and I know a lot of people use it to cowash but I've just been letting it sit in my hair while I shave, wash my body, etc. and it seems to be working well! Haven't had any problems with my hair feeling dry at all. Hope that if you try it out you like it!"
curlyhair,373xuk,Bredul,10,Mon May 25 04:04:10 2015 UTC,"I agree in loving the before picture for its volume, but your after has better definition and hold with the curls. Mostly, in the second picture the problem is really only where it frames your face.   How are you drying it? It could be as simple of a fix as that! If you're using a blow dryer, just flip your head over and come at it from below (R.I.P. Your Lower Back, I know). I mostly air dry and to ensure that it doesn't just stick down flat to my head, I do what I call going ""full Becky.""   Full Becky means that I flip all of my hair to one side for maybe 10 minutes and then switch off with it on the other side. I do this back and forth until it's dry and it results in volume. Pieces fall down and over, but I just try not to touch them and let them do whatever they want in the drying process. Just sit back and watch T.V.  Of course, this sacrifices a bit of my curls' hold and perfect ringlets, but I prefer a slightly wilder look myself.   I hope this helps!"
curlyhair,373xuk,alohakush,3,Mon May 25 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"Right now, I'm 100% air drying and just using a tshirt so its not dripping wet, but I really want to look into diffusing! Seems like a great way to get some volume up at my roots (can't really air dry upside down for 5 hours :) but I definitely think that flipping it from side to side will probably help too. Thanks for the tips!"
curlyhair,373xuk,kimjongunf,3,Mon May 25 03:59:19 2015 UTC,"Diffusing is the best! I somehow lost the dryer that met with my diffusing attachment, so I've been stuck with going full Becky for a while. However, it is a tired, but true method.  Embrace your inner Becky. I've never been a big fan of air drying, especially with product, because it makes my skin feel gross, but being Becky helps take my mind off of it. You'll know you're doing the Becky right when you walk past a mirror and the only thing separating you and a 1992 yearbook photo is a row of scrunchies on your wrist."
curlyhair,373xuk,Bredul,2,Mon May 25 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"You could try letting it dry in a ""pineapple"".  What I like to do is after I wash and whatnot (I don't follow CG totally, maybe about 40%?) is to plop it in a sarong for about 15-20 minutes, and then throw it in a scrunchie in a pineapple and let it finish drying.  If I don't do at least one of those I get absolutely no volume at all, and I need all the volume I can get."
curlyhair,373xuk,alohakush,2,Mon May 25 04:51:56 2015 UTC,Is your hair still pretty wet after your plop? I'd be curious to try drying my hair in a pineapple but from previous experience I'm not convinced my hair knows how to air dry when I tie it up haha
curlyhair,373xuk,Bredul,1 point,Tue May 26 08:35:30 2015 UTC,Could you please further describe this pineapple method you speak of?
curlyhair,373xuk,alohakush,3,Mon May 25 05:11:20 2015 UTC,"Essentially it's a really high ponytail, right at the top of your head.  Keep the ponytail somewhat loose and kind of split the hair in half and let them hang on each side (if long enough).  I think it's actually supposed to be a protective hairstyle, but I adapted it to work with my hair."
curlyhair,373xuk,Bredul,3,Mon May 25 05:26:47 2015 UTC,"I gotcha!! That never works with my hair, because it's so heavy.   If I have to put my hair up to dry, I do a loose twist with my hair starting from the temples and secure it in the back with a snapping barrette... From the front it would look like a half-ponytail. Then I'll take the extra bits of my hair (the ""mullet"") and bring it together in a barrette right above the other.   It's been my go-to hairstyle ever since I watched Little Women and wanted a good up-do, but it does wonders for keeping hair hydrated when you want to style it on the go!"
curlyhair,373xuk,alohakush,2,Mon May 25 05:37:03 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I might try that!  It sounds easy and pretty!  I have fine and thin hair that's pretty long, so it works well for me.  Plus it makes me feel like I'm in an '80s/'90s aerobic video which is awesome."

curlyhair,373xuk,coolprince,2,Sun May 24 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing for me was avoiding towels at all costs and using gel while my hair is dripping wet.

I'm going to keep experimenting with different products until I find my holy grails but that seems to be working wonders for me!"

curlyhair,3749v5,AGhostLP,1 point,Tue May 26 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"Same. A deva cuts definitely helps, and I also trim the underneath straighter pieces myself in between cuts to keep them from getting TOO much longer from the curly part, which looks terrible. Usually I stick to bobs to keep the wavy pieces relatively short, then it's not so noticeable, but I'm trying now to grow it a bit longer... It still looks OK I think, maybe 3-4 inches below my shoulder, but I'm not sure how much longer I can go before it just looks bizarre.  I think if the wavy bits were on top I'd just use a curling wand to make them match the rest of my hair, but when it's the underneath it's harder to keep them from getting flattened again."

I've only been finger coming my hair in the shower with lots of conditioner. Sure, it still falls out but at a much slower rate. When you brush your hair dry it rips through the knots and causes split ends. When I finger comb, I gently pull hairs out of tangles to keep them healthy.

curlyhair,3751ri,Shiraio,3,Sun May 24 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"Another guy here, and I also have short/medium hair. Give Shea Moisture a try. I use the Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo and Conditioner. Generally I have little to no issue with frizz compared to before I started using SheaMo.  I'm thinking about adding the Style Milk to my routine too since my hair has been a little frizzier than normal because of the weather. So if you don't want to completely change the products you're using just add this to your routine.  Also Walgreens is having a buy one get one free sale on all SheaMo products so now wouldn't be a bad time to try it out.  The conditioner you're currently using as a leave-in has Isopropanol, so it's actually drying out your hair. Which is why your hair is frizzy and feels stiff. What shampoo are you currently using?"

The sulphate shampoo isn't terrible. Typically people use them if they're experiencing product buildup or scalp issues. The main reason it's looked down upon is because sulphates are heavier cleansers, and can cause dryness when used regularly. It's all about what works for you and your hair though.   Your hair looks much healthier in the plop/S2C pic, so I'd say keep doing it. Your curls are a little looser than the ""did nothing"" pic though, so if you do want them to be more pronounced, you'll need to use a gel, mousse, or creme also."

At the moment I use some of the lush shampoo bar, I like it because I can wash it out fully (shower at home is a bit weak, when I had thicker hair it was hard to wash the sides underneath!) At first my hair felt a little drier, but now after doing s2c more of the conditioner stays in, so it doesn't matter!  I use a mousse normally the VO5 smoothing one but sometimes since I've started plopping I've forgotten to do it before plopping, but that's for mainly frizz not making it curlier, maybe I could something more substantial when its warmer...Like a gel or cream? I have some hair serum at home I might give that a whirl next time! (I'm back home til late September, so I can't really go out and get anything til then...) Today the curls are more even on both sides, I think I'm find a s2c method I like! As I'm a student and living in UK, there isn't loads that I can buy in store...we aren't so curl friendly yet!

My hair is kind of fine (like yours), so I have to be quite careful not to use too much, but it's really helped to define my curls."

Then I just shampoo my bangs, get the excess water out with a small face towel, comb them through and blowdry them straight. Then I use a hair straightner to fix up any kinks :)"
curlyhair,372bfr,kimjongunf,1 point,Sun May 24 07:16:26 2015 UTC,Do you find it easier to do this over time? I suppose I'll have to commit to having this as a part of  a daily routine. Thanks for the feedback btw :)
curlyhair,372bfr,kimjongunf,1 point,Sun May 24 07:28:17 2015 UTC,"No problem! :) Honestly I find it pretty easy and it doesn't take up much time at all, plus sometimes I can get away with doing it every second day if I'm too tired in the morning to do it or if I'm not going anywhere special.   Also, (this may be overkill), but to guarantee my bangs stay straight during the day I bring a small comb in my bag so I can fix them up when need be."
curlyhair,372bfr,hashtagphag,1 point,Sun May 24 07:32:14 2015 UTC,"My hair straightens up quite a bit when it's short, so pulling off straight (sideswept) bangs is fairly easy for me. Like /u/kimjongunf, I wash my bangs every morning. If I've shampood or cowashed that day, I make sure to leave the bangs out of my plop to air dry on their own. I use a fine tooth comb to sweep them off to the side during that time, which helps encourage the swoop as well as pulling out residual waviness. Once they're dry, I either give them a quick blast with a hair dryer or run a small barrel curling iron over them to get them straighter. And that's it!   If you find your bangs want to keep curling up throughout the day, you could give them a spray with a heat protector (usually have silicones) or run a bit of gel through them before manipulating them with a dryer/iron. Make sure they're dry from the product before you do though, or they may singe."

curlyhair,372bfr,purplekites,1 point,Sun May 24 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"I used to straighten once per wash, which was about every 4-5 days at that time. I'd usually comb them out with a fine tooth comb as I got out of the shower, put a little heat protectant in, and either blow them dry straight or keep combing them straight with my fingers as they air dried. I'd then use a mini travel straightener to finish up. Didn't really take that much outside my routine, and loved having bangs!"
curlyhair,372nzd,VideoKilledRadioGaga,3,Sun May 24 08:08:25 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it's almost impossible to achieve both curl definition and volume. You can ideally find a balance between the two, but more volume means less definition and vice-versa.   Plopping helps get a lot more definition, as well as some extra ""volume"" at the roots (it would call it ""lift"" rather than volume), but no overall volume. KCCC also helps getting more defined curls, so I would expect less volume.  Sometimes I manage to get the ideal (well, perfect for me at least; we may all have different preferences) volume-definition balance when I use a bit less leave-in (usually KCKT) and still a very tiny amount of KCCC, plop for about an hour (at which point my hair is still pretty damp; it takes forever to dry), diffuse with very low heat (almost no heat to keep frizz at bay), then finally flop my hair to different sides for a bit, scrunch here and there and sliding my fingers from underneath to shake the roots and get some more lift.  ... I hope that last paragraph made sense! It's all trial and error with this stuff, we all have different hair and it all behaves differently. Good luck!"
curlyhair,372nzd,themadcattermad,2,Sun May 24 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"I have low-porosity, thin, and fine hair. A bit different than you, but still 2C/3A t least. Personally, I think my curls are very well-defined while using KCCC, but I've been shedding more since using it. I clip my hair at the roots for volume, but I'm noticing quote a bit of hair on my hands after applying KCCC while it's wet. I'm gonna try other gels and see if I get different results."
curlyhair,3726v7,CauseImKayla,2,Sun May 24 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"If I want some more length, after its dry or close to it I run a blow dryer on low air/high heat, while stretching big sections of my hair straight, up and down the length a few times - remember only for about 20 seconds though, otherwise you lose too much curl definition and just have awkward flat waves"
curlyhair,3726v7,Meeno722,1 point,Sun May 24 05:50:52 2015 UTC,"If you have hair clips, deva clips work the best due to their weight, but if you just throw some heavier clips at the ends of your hair while it dries it will help elongate your hair!"
curlyhair,3726v7,kellykell,1 point,Mon May 25 12:11:13 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing as Meeno722, but after its completely dry after diffusing, I'll run my flat iron though section of it (WITHOUT BRUSHING). Mostly on the ends, because they're the curliest. This method gives me a looser curl, more like a tight wave! Also, while in the shower, I'll rinse out my conditioner, and then shake my head to separate my curls (kind of like dreadlocks) so they're sticking together in bigger sections."
curlyhair,36xdis,uhhidontcare,5,Fri May 22 22:17:26 2015 UTC,That clump action though! What's your routine like?!
curlyhair,36xdis,unfunnypun,7,Fri May 22 23:47:02 2015 UTC,This was right after I took my clips out. I usually shake it out because I like my hair a bit messier.   I use as I am cowash every couple of days and once/twice a week shampoo with sulfate free. Condition with suave naturals. Then I tip my head upside down and comb all my hair forward to rinse/squish to condish. I leave it dripping wet and add catwalk curls rock amplifier (the best stuff ever!) and then aveda confixor. If I'm diffusing or want second day curls then I'll add a little herbal essences totally twisted gel. I put all my products in by gently gliding my palms over my hair and then squishing it in while squeezing extra water out. Then I plop for a few and clip my roots. Shake out when dry. Hope for the best or really just a decent hair day.   Here's a photo of what it really looks like. I have a combination of everything in between tight curls to waves.

Here's my before and after, I'm so happy with the results! Also sorry for the potato quality of the before! lol My hair wasn't totally dry from my shower and it was super humid that day in Manhattan, so I think the frizz monster might have taken control for a little while there, haha. It feels so much healthier and actually has a shape instead of the triangle head, tangled mess that I'm used to. I haven't even washed it yet and I'm rocking great 3rd day curls!   I had master stylist Robert cut my hair and he was absolutely amazing, so I definitely recommend him! He took off a little more than I wanted initially but I know I definitely needed to take off those last 3 inches or so of damage (where I was getting all my knotting). He used ArcAngel on my hair after the No-Poo and One Condition that I always use when I use my DevaCurl products. I've never tried ArcAngel, but I do like it better than the light hold gel that I have in my collection. I want one of those dryers! haha I'm hoping my drying time will be like cut in half, but I'm not sure yet! Gotta start a new routine! haha  I also filmed my entire haircut for my YouTube channel and that should be up in a few days!

I use medium-weight for regular conditioning and S2C: DevaCurl combined with Darcy Botanicals.    I'd say the biggest thing is finding the right leave-in conditioner and gel/mousse/whatever, because those will make or break the weighing-down effect your hair will be prone to. I really liked DC B'Leave In, but I had to use A TON because my hair is so long. Wasn't worth the cost for the amount of product I needed. With shorter hair, it'll probably work better for you, and it will play nicely with other DC products.

Explain your situation and try to emphasize that while it may look ""messy"" you are in fact hygienic. Also if you contact HR about the issue and your boss still feels the need to tell you to ""get it taken care of"" you can state you have already talked to HR and they can go through that avenue.

That's what I'd suggest to help control it. Even though I use gel every day, I still get frizzies all over when my hair is down considering my long hair does not play well when it brushes across my shoulders all day when I turn my head (I think I just need a better gel, too).   Is your hair too short to pull back? I know workplaces have dress codes against ""unkempt"" hair, but maybe you could try talking to your boss about how you are transitioning it to your natural waves/curls and get them to understand that's why it looks how it does right now and that you are working on it. I do think you should add in a gel/mousse/other frizz control agent if you don't have anything, because that can help at least a little bit if not solve your problem.  I know there have been lawsuits from black women against former employers because they were terminated for ""unprofessional""/unkempt hair or hair not following company dress code, but I really don't know if that could help you much at all.   Honestly, I keep my long hair pulled back 95% of the time because 1. it gets in the way of me working and 2. I'm not completely comfortable with the frizziness right now. But frizz tolerance is a part of loving your curls because you're likely to always have some sort of frizz.  Pulled up/back hairstyles could be your best bet for making it look more ""presentable"" for work (I hate to say that! :| ), but I'm not sure how long your hair is for what styles to suggest. www.hairromance.com is great for medium/longer styles.

Hair texture varies from straight hair to the curlier, kinkier hair. Curly hair also has its own variation ranging from very loose curls to the very tightly packed afro textured hair. Straight hair enjoys a higher prestige and is more widely accepted in both professional settings and everyday settings.

For instance, some curls respond well to mousse, and some don't, etc, depending on your scalp/hair dryness, curl type, and so on. As a 2b, I'd stay away from heavier gels, but try out a few mousses/creams with a bit of lighter gel at your ends to help maintain the curl over the course of the day. My all time favourite is DevaCurl's Styling Cream - it's paraben/sulfate/silicone free, has a good bottle design, and makes soft curls a reality...unfortunately, it's also expensive.

curlyhair,36txbx,Kstau24,5,Fri May 22 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"hey friend!  I'm not a dude and I'm not a pro at this but I have been doing this long enough to hopefully help a bit.  First off, you're using the wrong products.  The Keratin products aren't going to work, they're for straightening and smoothing hair.  Which you think helps with frizz, and it does, on straight hair.  This is different than trying to smooth out curly hair.  You have a 3a/b type so look those up and see what you should be using.  I would first off recommend conditioning WAY more, especially if you want to grow it out.  That will help with the frizz.  Try cowashing (washing with conditioner only).  The key there is to massage it really well in with your fingertips.  One you may have good results with is AsIAm CoWash Cleaning Conditioner.  I cowash and then if I start to get build up from products I use a sulfate free shampoo (but you may not need that extra step depending on your hair and products).   Another thing that may help is a little moroccan oil (just a little goes a long way!!).  Simply put, start conditioning the heck out of your hair and look up how to care for 3a/b hair.    Now product wise, I prefer DevaCurl and Jessicurl.  Look those 2 up, do research, and see what you think.      I can't help with the haircut question, but I hope I helped with the rest of it."
curlyhair,36txbx,PlayGoFish,1 point,Fri May 22 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"Your hair looks dry, so I would minimize the keratin/protein in your routine. Too much of it will dry out your hair and screw up the curl, which is why it's used as a straightening treatment in salons. I think that's probably what's making your curl pattern so unpredictable. Some protein isn't a bad thing, it helps restore your hair health, especially if your hair is damaged... for those who need it, we use a deep conditioning treatment immediately afterwards. But if your hair is healthy, you really won't need much of it in your life.     Be careful of the Redken products. Oh, I love me some Redken, was their biggest fan for YEARS... until I went CG. Then I read the ingredients and realized how harsh they are for curlies. Totally fine for straightening if you ever wanna do it, and they do have some excellent deep conditioners. But the majority of their products have tons of silicones, and you'll need sulfate shampoos to strip out buildup, which will dry your hair when used regularly. Bad for curlies =(     I'd recommend a gentle, moisturizing shampoo if/when you use it - most curlies don't shampoo every day. Some shampoo once a month or even less! Personally, I get oily/greasy, so I shampoo 3x a week and cowash the other 4 days. Your routine with this will depend on how your scalp reacts - buildup, dry, rash, flaking, or totally normal.    Your hair actually looks thick to me, but fine... so you'll want to find lightweight and moisturizing shampoos/conditioners, but strong defining gels. For shampoo/conditioner, I believe some folks here recommend Tresemme Naturals and Suave Naturals. I use VO5 myself (Strawberry Cream primarily, or Mint/Tee Tree), but I only use it for cowashing. I use more expensive brands for shampoo and for my regular everyday conditioning. If you don't mind spending more, there's definitely a whole slew of suggestions I and others can make, but it really depends on your budget. My shampoo costs about $10, my conditioners between $10 and $20 (I have multiple).   I think pastes and waxes might be your enemy... I think they'll weigh your hair down too much and will work against the style you want. I'd recommend either a gel or a creme. Someone else will have to recommend mousses, I gave them up decades ago =) Cremes I find give me softer curls, but my hair feels texturized, which I personally don't like. Gels give me stronger definition, but it's hit-or-miss finding the right one (some give me stringy hair, some take forever to dry, some make my hair coarse and cause shedding, etc). Between the two, it's really a matter of preference. For gels, you know what I think might work? There's these ""wet gel""s out there... Sebastian was discontinued I think but GVP is supposed to make a good, cheap replacement. I personally like the wet look for men, and think that might give you some really nice curl definition, especially when your hair is shorter. If you don't like the wet look, that's OK... once your hair is dry, do a couple scrunches to break up the hard cast. It should leave your hair shiny still, and with good hold, but get rid of the ""wet"" sheen."

You can get it at CVS, Walgreens, Target, Walmart, Sephora... just about anywhere, plus online retailers.     The description of that product recommends it for several different purposes.

None of those purposes really apply tbh (besides non-drying I guess). I mainly look for something light on fragrance, focuses on cleansing more than moisturizing, and non-creamy. The YTC is somewhat creamy but it works. Transparent shampoos strangely seem to work the best. Those are typically ones that tout clarifying.  That was a bit long-winded lol."
curlyhair,36txuo,hashtagphag,1 point,Sun May 24 08:33:18 2015 UTC,"With curly hair we typically do need extra moisturizing, but it can be a balance depending on our hair/scalp/skin. If you like cleansing and non-creamy, my guess guess is you feel like you have an oily scalp? Is that right, do you think your hair tends to be lanky and stringy and greasy if you don't wash it regularly?   How does it feel after you wash it, regardless of the before. I'm sure it feels clean, but... afterwards, is it dry? Frizzy? Stringy? Lank? Ends dry but scalp clean? Vice-versa? Clarifying should typically be used very rarely... just enough to strip product buildup, so roughly once a month. If you're using them more often, you may actually be causing excess dryness to your scalp, and excess dryness means our scalps over-compensates by getting even oiler.    I was petrified to try co-washing because I get buildup and oiliness myself, every single day... but I found a gentle shampoo to use plus a light cowash, which I alternate every other day, and it's been pretty good on my hair.

curlyhair,36rfpd,rosegrim,2,Thu May 21 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"To answer the question in the comment you responded to: because the fact of the matter is that if you're using a non water soluble silicone and not using a cleanser to remove it, you will get build up over time. Silicones aren't actually a problem—in fact they protect your hair and can help dry hair lock in moisture—but the problem as far as CG is concerned is the cleansers necessary to remove silicones from hair. Those cleansers tend to be harsh and drying when used on a regular basis. Some people use silicones and wash with a sulfate cleanser occasionally to remove build up, which is what you would need to do if you don't wish to give up the silicones.   Otherwise, if you're in the market for a cleansing conditioner, I would recommend Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle. It's been my cowash for quite a while and I love it."
curlyhair,36rfpd,maeEast,1 point,Thu May 21 18:47:19 2015 UTC,I haven't noticed any build-up. Actually I don't even know what build-up would look like or feel like.

I'm going to the salon next week so I'm sure they'll give me a nice shampoo so maybe that will clear some of it up. As for trader joe's...I don't have one where I live. Wish I did because it sounds like an awesome store.

curlyhair,36r0nt,hashtagphag,3,Thu May 21 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"There's lots of videos out there that can help, here's a couple that I liked:   Vid 1 Vid 2    However, I tried the method using the different approaches in those videos, and found they didn't work out quite as well for me. Using V1, I found I was losing too much conditioner from my ends and they were dry. Using V2, my hair would take FOREVER to dry. I also don't like the upside-down method, as I found that conditioner runs back down onto my scalp while plopping, making my scalp greasy and itchy the rest of the day.    After some experimentation, I've modified it like this:    Do my normal shower routine, including regular conditioning. Do not rinse the conditioner.  Once I'm ready, pull my hair off to the side, like a ponytail, and rinse excess conditioner off my scalp. Don't worry if some conditioner gets removed from the lengths as well, we'll be reapplying anyway - just get the scalp clean.  Split my hair into 2 parts (over each shoulder). Apply a liberal amount of conditioner from ends to just above my ears. As V1 mentioned, my hair feeling like seaweed is vital.  Lean to one side, and palm bowls of water into my hair to get the squish (more like V2). I have long hair, but it's fine and thin, and I do it 3-4 times for each side of my hair.    I used to leave my hair dripping while applying products afterwards, but wasn't getting good results - my hair was still soaked post-plopping, the dreaded conditioner-on-the-scalp continued, and my hair would dry sorta stringy at the ends. I found a blog of another curly who recommended wringing out as much water as possible post-S2C. That actually worked really well for me, as we have similar hair types (both long and fine).    Your clumps breaking up might also be due to applying mouse/gel/cream post-plopping. I put all my products in before plopping to encourage the curl clumps again, since I just broke them up running my fingers all through them.    After S2C and wringing, I apply a shitton of leave-in, and a mild amount of gel/cream/whatever (still trying to find what works best). I apply products using the same side-to-side method, as I found that upside-down doesn't allow me even distribution. After I apply, I twirl my hair into a couple sections - imagine I now have thick dreadlocks - then plop with a t-shirt. I've tried micro-fiber towels, but they only work for soaking up a little excess water; using them to plop makes me frizz. After I plop, I jump back in the shower for a few seconds to rinse off any residue left on my face/shoulders from my side-to-side method.     If I touch my curls at all post-plop, they will break apart no matter what. I can't diffuse because of that =( I only touch my hair during the drying stage in order to clip up my roots. After it's dry, I scrunch-out-the-crunch with a de-frizzer sprayed on my hands.   Hope any of this can help!"

curlyhair,36r0nt,miss-pam,2,Sun May 24 08:28:55 2015 UTC,Quick update. That made such a big difference. Thank you so much for the advice. I think previously I was separating the curls by scrunching with product after I plop whereas I should put the product in straight away and do not touch. Also tried your conditioner technique. I still have a stubborn top layer but I just pin that back and voila - soft curls :)
curlyhair,36r0nt,dinnerjam,1 point,Sun May 24 11:08:45 2015 UTC,Maybe try the Rake and Shake method? It's a little more customizable compared to S2C which can be a little more unpredictable.
curlyhair,36r0nt,Curly_Alice,3,Thu May 21 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Has anyone made rake and shake work on thin hair?  I mean, the definition is amazing, and my hair would look fabulous if it was double the thickness, and I've seriously never had definition at my roots before, but I don't think this is a great look on fine hair.

I haven't used the As I Am leave-in, but could it be that it's a little too lightweight? I've run into that problem for sure. Or, you may need to apply a light coat of extra leave-in to your canopy after the KCCC. I dunno if you're like me, but the diffuser might be a problem too.

I've heard good things about Kinky Curly Knot Today, so I'll give that a try. I'm excited to try that protein treatment!

I can't use too many products without causing build-up, so I'm using KCCC without any additional gel over it. KCCC is protein-free I believe, but my shampoo and conditioners do all have proteins in them.   The products you're using now are either low- or no-protein.

It's my favorite deep-conditioning treatment but I've been alternating it with stuff that doesn't work as well because I don't want to damage my hair from too much protein."
curlyhair,36r0nt,hashtagphag,1 point,Thu May 28 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"Based on what I'm reading online, it does have keratin in it but it sounds like it's geared towards being a combo of strengthening/conditioning. So it does count, but only ""sorta"". You'll know if you're having issues with protein imbalance if your hair feels dry and strawlike, and is tangling easily. That could mean you're using too much protein-based products, or that you're protein-sensitive. You and your hair will know best though =)  Since you're alternating it with other products, you should be safe. What you could do instead of alternating with lesser-quality stuff is get one good-quality deep conditioner instead. After you do this treatment, follow it up with the other conditioning-only. If you're only doing this once a week (or even less often), you should be just fine."

curlyhair,36rcz5,wildhairman,2,Thu May 21 14:44:36 2015 UTC,Haven't read everything but what I'll say is DON'T comb your hair! Combs are the bane of curlies/wavies. Just detangle in the shower with conditioner and a wide tooth comb as gently as possible!
curlyhair,36rcz5,SolitaryRS,1 point,Thu May 21 18:20:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I meant wide tooth comb my bad.
curlyhair,36rcz5,SolitaryRS,1 point,Thu May 21 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough pal  Also, don't rinse all the conditioner off, that usually helps me. I just squeeze the excess water out of my hair, pat dry it a bit with a cotton t shirt and let it air dry. Try using some gel after the leave-in? Scruch some into your hair and see how that goes. Might help. Make sure it's free of sodium laureth sulphate and other baddies like silicones and drying alcohols ect  Hope this helps!"
curlyhair,36rcz5,blazindowntheriver,1 point,Thu May 21 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"Nonono! Wide tooth combs are ok, but my advice would be to wait until the conditioner's sat in your hair for at least a few minutes before you comb it out. Combing before it's wet and conditioned can put a lot of stress on your hair and scalp.   Also, chances are if your shampoo is lathering, it has sulfates...try to avoid those. :)  You don't necessarily need to dry your hair between shampooing and conditioning, either, scrunching should get rid of most excess water. The commenter before is also correct in that not rinsing out all the conditioner can help - I almost never wash out mine, and I also agree with the comment about the gel. A light gel or a light cream on your mid-length to ends should help a bit!"
curlyhair,36rzpl,Umbreontest,1 point,Thu May 21 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"If you get sufficient cleaning from just massaging your scalp with water, then probably not. What gels have you tried and why didn't you like them? I totally love the LA Looks Sport Gel, but it's not ""light"" when it comes to hold, but is light on the hair. I have very fine hair and it doesn't weigh it down. A serum, to me, is like a watery oil. It can serve lots of functions, but I think mostly it's used to smooth down frizzies. I would add a gel to help get enough hold. Thin, fine hair typically needs protein, not humectants. Where did you read that??"

Have fun experimenting and trying new things.  Nothing wrong with that. Your boyfriend should be allowed his opinion but shouldn't dictate how you wear your hair (or how you do anything in your life, for that matter).  My husband prefers me with long hair but certainly isn't going to divorce me if I get a pixie cut."
curlyhair,36mcmr,all_u_need_is_cheese,13,Wed May 20 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely check out http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/transitioning/ - there are TONS of people going through the same thing there, the top thread is specifically about supporting each other through transitioning. You'll also get good tips for which products and things to use, since your routine will probably have to change a bit as you transition - curly hair just needs different things! :) So if your family isn't supportive right now, use the internet for that support until they come around. And if they don't, tell them that it's your hair and your decision. Period!!  My hair is 2C so I haven't gone through this myself (I think my hair would literally fall out if I chemically straightened it, although I did use a flat iron for several years which I have now kicked to the curb), but I have definitely gotten sucked into watching an embarrassing amount of youtube videos of people documenting their transitions from chemically straightened to natural hair. It's addictive!! Definitely look for Youtubers whose videos you can watch to get inspiration.  Also, I personally LOVE the way naturally curly hair looks, sometimes I actually want to comment to people on the bus or whatever but I always decide it would probably be creepy and don't! :) So I'm 100% positive you will look gorgeous with natural hair."

curlyhair,36mcmr,megszzz,6,Wed May 20 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"I'm actually proud that you are ready to embrace your natural curls. I have 2b hair (but looked more like 3a when i first started due to the amount of damage I had), but it took me 3 attempts to fully embrace my curls. The first time I was 20, second at 22, and the time it actually stuck as about a year ago, at 25, to make my curls stick. It probably wouldn't have stuck without this sub, since I finally learned how to take care of them.   I would say just try it for a while. Learn your hair, figure out how to handle your bangs (there are plenty of curlies here that will be happy to help), and get comfortable with a routine. As for your mom and boyfriend, just say that it's a trial period. This isn't a decision that you have to stick with forever and all you want is their support while you're trying to figure things out. What's the worse that can happen? You decide to go back to straightening your hair? At least you tried and now you know.   If your boyfriend still isn't to the curly hair, you can have that discussion after you try it. I would personally be worried if my SO had that strong of feelings on whether my my hair is curly or straight.  To me, that should be my opinion."
curlyhair,36mcmr,BunnyCurls,3,Wed May 20 20:04:35 2015 UTC,"It's hard to find support when people you know all like straight hair. I'm always sad to hear a mother tell her daughter she is ugly the way she was made. I'm not saying disrespect her or kick her in the knee or anything, but you do have to take her opinion as opinion. YOU need to love yourself as you were made in order to feel beautiful. Your mother is your mother, not you. Boyfriends are nice and all, but think of the long term. If you plan to keep a partner for life, you want one that accepts all of you, even if you want to change it up. I'm not saying just straight up dump him, but explain to him that you weren't made with straight hair and you don't want to spend your life forced to look that way. He'll either love you anyway, or you'll both move on and be better for it. We're internet strangers, but we're support. Please make yourself happy, whatever you decide to do!"

However, in addition to that, my density is thin (thin/medium/thick) and my texture is fine (fine/medium/coarse).    Before I went CG, I loved my Redken styling products. Number one fan here. They always did exactly what they claimed, and I have zero doubt that this cream would control frizz and wild strands as-promised. That said, Redken is for the most part not CG-friendly. Most of their products contain silicones which are not water-soluble, and many of their mens products contain waxes which act similarly. You would need to use a sulfate shampoo to get rid of any build-up that occurs, and sulfates contribute to dryness when used regularly.   If you're OK will all of that, go for it. I used them for years when I was working on wavy/straight, and had no problems with what I was trying to achieve or my hair health. Now that I'm going curly though, I have been forced to ditch them.

Here's what I got. “Our efforts to constantly deliver the best possible results for every individual curl type leads to changes in the costs of our products.  It has been a long time since we adjusted our pricing to reflect those changing costs. In some cases, you will actually see that prices for some of our items have been reduced. In some cases, prices for some of our items have been increased. We have reformulated and improved those products.  You will only notice changes in two products   – Vitla Curl Tress Effects Styling Gel and Botanical Boost® Moisture Infusing & Refreshing Spray.   -VitalCurl Tress Effects® Styling Gel is a maximum hold styling gel containing our unique Memory Lock feature, which can retain and reactivate your desired curl formation. We have reformulated this system to simultaneously provide the highest level of curl memory possible and deliver a softer, more natural finish. This increased Memory Lock will improve curl manageability and retention for next-day style without stiffness or stickiness. Note that the formula still includes a blend of Hydrolyzed Collagen and Pectin to smooth out the cuticle, prevent frizz and tame flyways. The formula is also infused with Shea Butter to keep curls hydrated and moisturized.  -Botanical Boost® Moisture Infusing & Refreshing Spray formula has also been improved by raising the extract levels for increased hydration and rebalancing the essential proteins. This allows the proteins to bind more hydration to the curl, so curls are softer with more frizz control. The increased extract levels also produce better curl definition when Botanical Boost® is used as a refreshing spray, which is why we have renamed the product as Botanical Boost® Curl Energizing & Refreshing Spray.  We are committed to ensuring that every Ouidad product cleanses, conditions, treats, styles and finishes your curls beyond your expectations. We constantly evaluate our formulations to ensure that we use the best ingredients to deliver the results you expect.”"

curlyhair,36pbi3,portisslave,3,Thu May 21 01:30:02 2015 UTC,"Co-washing: You can use the same type of conditioner, just make sure you completely rinse out after the co wash before you condition.  Personally, I use two different ones because I like to co wash with a very thin conditioner (V05), because it's easy to rinse out, and a thicker conditioner after (Tresemme Naturals) because it stays thick in my hair while I'm doing other shower things and helps make my hair easier to comb.  Comb in the shower: Do this with all the conditioner in your hair, start from the ends and work your way up to the scalp.  Maybe it would help if you told us more about how your hair was worse from this?  No Brushing:  Scroll through this sub from the past few days.  There have been a lot of posts where people show what their hair looks like brushed out.  Curls form clumps, and brushing your hair dry separates them, so your curls turn into fluff, they lose their shape.  I have actually found that having my curl clumps separated makes my hair even more tangly.  I don't know why exactly, but it does.  I don't know what types of curls pineapple does or does not work with, but it's worth a try.  I like sleeping with a pineapple because I'm not laying on my hair so it doesn't get tangled.  Product: From what I gather here, product over your leave in kind of locks in the moisture of the leave in.  Gel or mousse is just whatever works best for you.  Mousse tends to be lighter, but can be drying for some people.  Gels can be crunchy and heavier, but may reduce frizz more than a mousse.  Styling creams are also an option, but most of them vary in how heavy they are, effectiveness, etc.  Its a good idea to try some travel/sample sizes of products you think might work for you if they're available, you can find what works best for you without going through a full size bottle."
curlyhair,36pbi3,brattylilduck,2,Thu May 21 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"I also have 2A hair and co wash with shea moisture every 3 days. I do not use any shampoo whatsoever. After I co wash I plop for ~30 minutes.  Regarding combing, I found my hair hates it when I comb or brush it, wet or not. I haven't combed it in 3 weeks! Personally, the shea moisture is just not enough for my hair in the shower...it makes my hair gum together, so I go non-GC and use some silicone-containing conditioner as well :). Then I comb out tangles with my fingers in the shower, squish to condish and rinse.   Product-wise, I use oyin handmade's hair dew, squish to condish it in my hair after plopping, maybe pat some on the top, and I'm good to go. I believe this is a CG friendly product. This is a personal preference-I don't ever see myself using gel because I like the wild/crazy waves instead of the wet/clean waves."

curlyhair,36n6yn,OlieB,3,Wed May 20 16:44:25 2015 UTC,50% of your hair sounds like a lot...is it possible there is a medical reason for your hair loss?
curlyhair,36n6yn,maymila,1 point,Wed May 20 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"Shoot... I found your post and was hoping for tons of advice. Instead I can only share my experience =(    I've also noticed hair loss since going CG, and I believe it's due to the styler I'm using. Not 100% so I will continue experimenting, but I'm noticing a significant amount of hair coming off on my hands, much more than before. It's not breakage from my color-treating, that's always normal and has actually decreased... it's literally full strands. I feel like my hair itself is stronger, but perhaps my follicles are weaker.      I can talk about protein masques though, I use them regularly. This is a nice article that touches on the subject. In short, there are (1) people who are sensitive to protein, (2) people who are OK with it, and (3) people who need it.   #2 is the best place to be. You can make at-home protein treatments, use commercial products, or have various proteins in your stylers without seeing adverse negativity, and some occasional positive effects. I think many of us are not in this crowd though.   #1 and #3 experience a similar initial effect, but for different reasons. Both will have hair that is dry, strawlike, and subject to breakage. It gets tangled easily, and will likely shed like crazy. How to tell the difference? Don't change anything about your deep or regular conditioning, but decrease your strong protein and see what happens.    #1 will experience nicer and softer hair. It will feel stronger, break less, and overall seem much healthier. This means that the amount of protein you've been using (whether as a masque or in your products) has been too much. You'll need to experiment to find the right balance. A good starting place is ditching your most protein-laden product. If you have bad results after 2-3 days, put the product back in, and get rid of another one. Rinse and repeat. If your protein-laden product is a deep conditioner, ditch it for 2 weeks - seriously. Your hair will recover if this is wrong, but if it's right, you really need to get rid of it.    I am #3, I need protein. I damage my hair regularly, which destroys the natural protein/keratin in the core of the strands. I need to replace it, as my hair is dry and breaks and sheds like mad while it's damaged and protein-defunct. However, like everyone, my hair reacts the same way to too much protein as it does to too little - breakage, dry, etc. For #3s, we need to figure out ""how much is too much"".      I did it a bad way before, so I'll tell you a good way instead. Begin with a protein-based treatment and apply it exactly as directed. Immediately afterwards, apply a deep conditioning treatment. PS, check the ingredients, lots of DC have proteins, which just doubles up and negates the effect we're going for here. Leave the deep conditioner in as directed, or apply it overnight, I don't care. Either way, your hair should feel soft and buttery and non-tangly and restored once you wash it out. If it does not, you may be protein-overloaded and have to refer to #1... check your other products. Or... you may also be mistaking your dryness and tangliness as ""lacking protein"" when it's actually ""lacking moisture"". Again, check your other products. If you have a good amount of protein in them already, you probably don't need the protein treatments, and instead just need deep conditioning or a better leave in conditioner."
curlyhair,36ktwo,BaroquenRecorder,3,Wed May 20 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"UPDATE:  Step by step pics now added!  Sorry that there are no step-by-step pics. I was alone when I did this and I needed both hands. Anyway, here is what you do:  Supplies:  one spin pin, one small claw clip (for help styling - optional)   Take a 3-4 inch section from each side of your head and bring them both to the back (optional) If your hair is layered (as mine is) you may want to twist the sides a bit to keep the ends in. Use the small claw clip to hold one side while you work on the other side. Now, where were we? Oh yes!... Bring both sections to the back but DO NOT cross them. Lay them one on top of the other so they are like an = sign (parallel).  (assuming you are right handed) Use your left fingers to squish the sections together and press them to your head. With your right hand, and beginning at the right side of the parallel sections, aim the spin pin directly at your head and twist until you feel the ends on your scalp. Turn the pin so that the points are now facing left. Continue to pinch with your left hand and make sure the tails of the sections don't get caught up in the pin, but stay above it. Make sure that you continue to feel the ends of the pin touching your scalp as you spin. This will ensure a secure hold. When the pin is fully spun in, arrange the tails over top to create a waterfall effect and hide any visible part of the pin. If the front ended up to severe/tight, just pull a little on the side sections to loosen them.   I like this one. It's pretty, easy, you only need one thing, and it's secure and comfortable. I'll be doing this a lot this summer."

I looked up a quick how-to-cut-your-own-hair image in Google after a shower and went to town. It turned out okay, I haven't straightened it so I have no idea what it looks like straight, and I don't imagine the layers exactly ""blending"" but I feel like that contributes to the definition of my curls. From the placement of the ponytail, you can imagine the shortest layers being right at the top of my head, I love all this volume!  A few days after the haircut, I learned about the rake and shake method! It's made a world of difference, it's crazy!

If you think about it, the outside of my hair saw the most shampoo, and having thick hair, the shampoo didnt touch the under layers as much. Add the terry towl for drying (outer layers seeing the brunt of it), heat from dryers, brushing, and straighteners, and then times that by 20+ years...hello frizzy not so pretty hair on the outside. All this time the outer layers have been playing big hero and shielding those pretty underlayers. Hopefully sticking it out with CG and growing out/cutting off the pre-CG growth will help!!"

I have had a lot of luck moving to sulfate free shampoos. I still use small amounts of dimethicones (in my curling creme and my heat protector) but the low-poo shampoo seems to get it all out. I've also had good luck with a mix of squish to condish and the Ice Queen method (if you do a search you should find both). When my hair was your length I had really good results from plopping with a strong hold gel and diffusing. I would even get decent 2nd and 3rd day hair if I kept my hair out of the way while I slept. The frizz is an issue that I still deal with, but for me I sort of need the dimethicone to tame it. I live in a really humid area.

curlyhair,36irw5,iheartzombiecats,1 point,Tue May 19 18:29:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I hate using it because it leaves my hair really off-feeling, but the only other kind I tried burned. I just shower the next night instead of waiting a day in between. I just really started getting my hair to curl/wave and I love it so I don't want to ruin it.  I do color my hair, but it's not drastic - my hair is an ashy-looking dark brown-blonde and it makes me look paler than I am already, which is winter-white all year. I color it a nice coppery dark auburn, which makes it look like I'm not sickly-pale. I just hope that it won't leech the color out.  Also, don't even MENTION conditioner around my hair. My hair is oily and only lasts to the end of the second day before getting limp and stringy. No matter how much or little conditioner is used any hair I put conditioner in will only last a half-day. The salon I go to knows not to use it because it actually looks like my hair is still wet until I wash it again. I wish conditioner and my hair got along. :("

curlyhair,36i79y,deucekanouse,2,Tue May 19 19:03:26 2015 UTC,I think that I've read contradictory information about it. The last thing that I read said higher porosity it takes a longer time. But I don't know. I doubt that my hair is low porosity. My hair absorbs whatever I put on it without getting greasy. I can even style it with coconut oil without any issues. And it really does like some protein.  I don't know what's up with my hair porosity then. I hate doing the strand test.

curlyhair,36fphe,Totally_Not_LAWRENCE,3,Tue May 19 00:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'll start you off with the basics. Remember, its all personal preference and you can do what you want. * Modern hairstyle is short on sides, long on top. There are a wide variety of different styles. With a somewhat oval-ish head shape, it could suit you.  However, this isn't for everyone. My hair looks better when its longer than an inch all around but no longer than 3 on the top.  * Go over to /r/curlyhair. Find out how to treat your hair; methods, what not to do, and a products list. Healthy hair is always better than well styled hair. Personally, my hair doesn't want to get healthy so don't give up if you don't succeed easily! Also check out /r/haircarescience. * Clean up your beard. If you like it long, you might need to treat is similarly to head hair. I have never had a beard so I cannot tell you what is truly needed. Maybe /r/beards has something. Personally, I would just settle for a stubble or long stubble/short beard. Just make sure its well cut! YouTube might have some things.

Is it gummy, and too stretchy? You need protein. The perfect balance of moisture and protein results in hair with slight stretch, and strength.

I'm probably just not doing it right.  In the end my hair is just very dry looking.   Currently I'm not using anything big; I only wash my hair every other day using L'Oreal Eversleek shampoo with Bumble to Bumble Surf conditioner. I sometimes deep condition with the Aussie 3-minute miracle, and then I used this BaoBab oil  I was given as a gift (Haken Natural Baobab Oil). I mostly air dry, but that's basically it!"

curlyhair,36e20f,tamara135,1 point,Tue May 19 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"Some people plop overnight, and some people plop for 15 minutes before they diffuse. It can really help define your curls- AND cut back on drying time!"
curlyhair,36e20f,tamara135,1 point,Wed May 20 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"Hello, my brethren! We share the same struggles. I also have 2a/2b hair, but get this-the underside of my hair, a third of my hair is curly. Like, really adorable 3a curls. And it's not heat or dye damage or anything like that, it's just been that way since puberty. And here's the funny part- I can get my curls to look gorgeous and defined and make it last for days, but I CANNOT do anything with my waves. Who would ever think curly hair to be easier to deal with than wavy hair Here's my routine. I wash it every Sunday and nothing in the days between, just because I'm lazy and it literally takes 3 hours from washing to it being dry, using a diffuser. To you, I'd recommend a co-wash ( which is basically washing your hair with conditioner ) if you are using silicone free products  otherwise you'll get product build up. Another build up culprit is dry shampoo, which is why I'm not too keen on using. If your hair gets really greasy,you can use, for example, if you co-wash you hair on Wednesday and shampoo on Sunday, dry shampoo in the days prior to shampooing since that will get rid of the dry shampoo as opposed to co-wash. Now, two things, washing hair as infrequently as possible is crucial since the act of shampooing your hair is stripping your hair of its precious sebum. The scalp doesn't produce it just for kicks, it does it because the hair needs that oil- yes, that oil that makes your hair look disgusting is actually GOOD. Because we're stripping the hair of its natural oil and all moisture, that's why you need to condition and deep condition it afterward, to infuse in it the lost moisture. Also, the biggest culprit in drying your hair that's in your shampoo are sulfates. That's why is suggest a sulfate(and of course silicone ( which coats the hair stand and doesn't let moisture in nor out and especially if it's in your shampoo which you use on your roots, it will clog your pores)). Also, when it comes to co-washing, conditioner is a great way to wash your hair which will rid it off excess sebum, but not completely strip it. And worry not, conditioner WILL clean your hair. It has cleaning agents to do so. But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. One thing to keep in mind is that it will not look like shampooed hair since shampoo strips the hair of the oils completely, while the conditioner will get rid of about 90 % of oil. Don't shy away because of the 10%. It will look completely clean, just not that frizzy like when shampooed, but more like smooth and sleek, which I love. But while co-washing can be great I would only advise between shampoo washing since it,too, can cause build up. While curly hair needs all that moisture, our 2a/2b hair will be weighed down if only washed with conditioner. But, as I said, if you co-wash it for example on Wednesday your hair will look great on between washes and since you'd be shampooing it for example on Sunday, you don't need to worry about build up. And on 3rd day hair ( or 2nd day hair if it's really oily) you can put it in a ponytail, braid it, bun it, play with it. I have an album on my phone gallery with more than 250 hairstyles if I ever need inspiration. And these not only hide your oily roots, but also protect the hair ( well, except for ponytails, because if you just ponytail it, it's still exposed to the elements and it's still rubbing on your clothes and all that is harmful to the hair). Granted, damage to hair is inevitable due to regular wear and tear , but the hair is resilient and if you treat it right, it will age gracefully ;) Just think about it. My hair is to my butt and my ends are like 4 years old which is why they are more fragile and deserve more love By putting it in a bun your ends are tucked in and protected. The same with braids, which is why these are great protective styles. Not only that, they also style your hair at the same time. When you let your hate down, you will have gorgeous braid waves or loose bun waves. Also, there are many, many variations of the styles. And protective styles are not limited to only braids or buns, I'm just naming the two which are most widely used and easy to do. If you want ideas I'll suggest you search two of my pinterest boards ( yes, I realize this sounds like I'm promoting my boards, but I'm honestly doing this in hopes it will help you as much as it helped me and I'm not really gaining anything if you just look at my pins). My board for overnight protective styles (  overnight styling is a must! It protects the hair from your turning and tumbling which can matt your hair, dry it out and damage it because-friction. That's another thing, if you want to minimize the frizz and prevent your hair from drying out since cotton pillowcases actually absorb the oils from your hair and hence-bed head, you want to but a satin pillowcase or wrap a satin scarf over your overnight style. Now, since the satin pillowcase doesn't dry it your hair, you can let it down and sleep with it like that, but, unless you never turn in your sleep your waves will not be the same as they were before you went to sleep, which is why I still recommend overnight styles which can give you different waves and curls every day, which depends for example, how many buns you do or how tight you braid it or how big a sections you are using. So, the board for overnight styling is Curls -^ which has about 35 overnight styles which can give like a hundred different curls and waves for reasons I already listed (how many buns, for example, you do, how big a sections you use, how tight you braid it, etc) and there are also a couple of tips and links for curly hair care ( which is what are hair is, the difference being that our curls are looser and our hair needs less moisture ). The board for styles which range from casual to elegant which you can do for special occasions and 2nd,3rd, 4th day hair or simply because you want to have a pretty hair style is called Love it <3"

He was fresh out of beauty school and I was 18 looking for something...heck anything to work (I had actually been cutting my own hair because expensive cuts seemed pointless).  Eventually we decided to cut my hair ""bonsai style"".  Yes, I mean like the tree.   He would cut it dry where it needed it.  Years later he's a platform artist and he's known for his curly cuts (his is the Open Curl System) and travels all over doing conventions and teaching the technique.    Anyway...the TL;DR version a master stylist can pull well over $150.00 for a cut.  But the stylists in his salon start at $50.00 and are all trained in the OCS.  Call around in your area and see if you can find someone who is willing to work with you.  If you are willing to start with someone new or inexperienced you can figure it out together.  I did."

curlyhair,36bqa6,Curly_Alice,2,Mon May 18 03:31:32 2015 UTC,I used half a pump per side of my head last night (and I have an undercut and my hair is really short) and I think it May have been too much. I plop overnight and still have the towel on my head (it's 3:36am..Damn you bladder....). I will update in the morning in how it looks :)

curlyhair,369w6e,CortneyElin,20,Sun May 17 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"It's easiest and gentlest to comb curls (with a wide-toothed comb) in the bath/shower. Saturate the hair with conditioner and let it sit for a few minutes. THEN comb it.   Then you can rinse out the conditioner, but perhaps not all of it. Many curly-haired people on this sub use the ""squish-to-condish"" method which involves squishing the conditioner in and then using handfuls of water to rinse only a tad bit out."
curlyhair,369w6e,dandue,2,Sun May 17 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"Squish to consish - never heard of that before, but definitely gonna give it a try!"
curlyhair,369w6e,MirandaPriestlyy,11,Mon May 18 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"Like other comments here, don't brush her hair, and detangle with a wide tooth comb. I used to hate having my hair washed as a kid by my mother, because my mother didn't really have the patience to comb my hair out, and would run through it quickly with a regular comb :(. On top of that, she would just brush it up into a tight pony tail or puff every morning for school. From my experience with my hair now, that contributes to extra frizz and matted hair.   It was only till my aunt who has type 4 hair, started washing my hair (when I went to visit) that I began to enjoy the process. She took her time detangling my hair, and would put it into simple braids. By not letting my hair out (to be touched and tangled by little fingers) the braids helped to reduce tangles and matting. Plus my aunt used shea butter to help with shine and frizziness, but coconut oil might be a better choice for your daughter as it is lighter, and more easily absorbed.   My aunt also used to promise to use pretty ribbons and hair ties for my hair, so I got pretty excited whenever we went to stay with her. Maybe you could do the same to incentivise your daughter, and make hair day a fun day.  tl;dr: Wide tooth comb, Coconut oil, Braids, Cute hair ties (to add on to all the other great advice posted here :) )"
curlyhair,369w6e,decidedlyindecisive,17,Sun May 17 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"Even though my Mum has curly hair, when I was young, she was rubbish at handling my hair. First things first: Don't brush it! Curly hair is not to be brushed, ever. Comb it with a wide tooth comb when wet. This will help with the knotting and control the frizz/curls, but should also reduce the pull on her hair.   From my own experience, I remember 'no tears' not really doing much to help my hair (mine was super long, frizzy curly mess), so it might be worth combing her hair with conditioner in, and that should help with the knotting.   For daily touch-ups, look into a spritz of some variety, products that are good for curly hair can be found here. Also, I'm not a parent or anything, but see if there's a way to involve her in her hair management/styling, especially if she's prone to tantrums about it. Is there a way you can let her comb her hair and maybe guide her? I honestly don't know what the ability of a two/three year old is to do things, but I do know I have vivid memories of the pain induced by my own Mum forcing a brush through my hair and not being able to do anything about it. Maybe passing a little of that control to her might make it easier with her to deal with, and at least she'll get a good head-start on managing those beautiful curls as she gets older.   Good luck! :)"

Or online. http://www.thewetbrush.com/ I don't know what makes them magical but they are magical. I tease my hair in the back and have very curly hair, and in the shower with conditioner in it the tangles come out no problem.  I know curly haired people are usually against brushing out their curls, but I would suggest sticking with the leave in conditioner, running the WetBrush through after applying it, and then to re-separate her curls since the teeth on the WetBrush are so fine, use kind of a wide tooth comb and let it dry. It'll help to define her curls and waves. It kind of depends on her curl type though. You may just prefer to shake it out and go."

curlyhair,369w6e,poptart88,4,Sun May 17 17:52:55 2015 UTC,My daughter is 8 months old and her hair texture sounds like your daughter's (although if it's anything like mine it's going to get a lot curlier). Her hair also gets really matted down as well without brushing. I've found that I can put a bit of coconut oil on my fingers and smooth it over areas that get tangled in her hair right after her bath. It helps to keep her hair smooth and pevents it from getting dry and in turn matted and tangled.
curlyhair,369w6e,chair_ee,1 point,Sun May 17 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"For my son's hair I use Curly Kids shampoo and conditioner. It works great! Hardly any tangles, adorable curls. Also pretty cheap at wal-mart in the ""ethnic hair"" section. I comb it in the bath, and avoid using a towel to dry it.  Make sure you keep it trimmed appropriately as not getting regular haircuts really contributes a lot to tangles. That is usually my first clue I need a trim."

I really love the Jamaican Black Castor Oil masque, and I'm interested in trying more of the line--like the shampoo and the serum. I wash my hair between 1-2 times a week, depending on how it's feeling and looking. I'll usually shampoo (with either Dr. Bronner's or the SheaMoisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo), then use the JBCO masque as a kind of second co-wash, massage a handful or two into my scalp, then down through the ends, and then let it sit for anywhere from 5-20 minutes."

I don't know if it's really making a huge difference though, and I don't love the smell out of the bottle.    The smell doesn't linger though.

The only thing is I have to use it under a gel, or it ends up making my hair look stringy after one day.  I've used the Raw Shea masque and conditioner, which both work well for my hair, but no longer give me exceptional results since they've done their job in helping make my hair healthy.   The Yucca and Plantain styling milk is AMAZING in my hair for a wash and go, when I have a haircut with lots of layers (which I do not now). It leaves my hair so soft and full of body and it doesn't feel like anything is in my hair!   I just bought the 10 in 1 renewal masque, and I think it left my hair really soft, and it absorbed into my hair! It's the first masque to absorb into my hair.  I also just bought the Jamaican castor oil leave-in, and I'm surprised, but I think I Love it. My hair is not heavy! I even didn't use enough because my canopy was still a little dry. We'll see after a few washes if it washes out, but I think my hair works well with castor oil."

It didn't define my 3a curls (I just got into embracing my hair about three months ago, so this type isn't definite) at all.  I would suggest either for a leave-in, the smoothie if you need more moisture, but definitely use a defining product on top (like gel).   As a puffball, I wasn't worried, but if you have fine hair, I could see this taking you straight into spaghetti territory. And it won't be tasty."

curlyhair,36bt8g,Itsmarimar,2,Mon May 18 02:52:35 2015 UTC,You could try the squish2condish method to try and retain maximum moisture. Also make sure you are using stylers with a good hold to held prevent tangles and also moisturize with a mix of water and leave-in in a spray bottle daily. If this still doesn't work your hair could be craving protein. Try a protein treatment before you deep condish to see if it improves.

Also, sleeping with a 'pineapple' ponytail (on the very top of your head) can help a lot, it gets the curls up off your pillow so they don't get squished during the night.  If you are going to put your hair in a bun I would recommend Goody Spin Pins so you don't get kinks from elastics. Good Luck!"

The difference is after no poo, leave in I will use a styling cream (deva styling cream say two pumps) and spread it over the top then onto gel.  So upside down for conditioner, quick flip spread a bit of extra moisture on canopy back over for gel.  You can also try a deep condition on that area only.  Try coconut oil and place only on the canopy, leave it in overnight (put your hair in a bun or pony), then do your routine in the AM.  Once you put in the deep conditioner you can just twist up that section to keep it from ""softening"" the rest of your hair."
curlyhair,369yae,mohrme,1 point,Sun May 17 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"I suppose the deep conditioning on the top only is a great idea for maybe once a week, but my hair is so healthy now! I'd hate to leave out the underside...  When you flip over and add the cream on top, does it add frizz? I think I've tried this before, but maybe with only gel or something. Cream might make work better. I'll try it!"
curlyhair,369yae,antsy_pantsy,1 point,Sun May 17 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"The only thing that has worked for me is to squish to condish with palm-fulls of a super heavy conditioner. With Yes-to-carrots, I used 1-2 palmfulls while my hair was soaking wet, but was careful to leave most of the conditioner in, and really only used water to help distribute the conditioner. Then, 30 minutes to an hour later after I've plopped, I'd add another 1/2-1 palm full of conditioner, squishing throughout my hair, and 2-3 hours later the same amount.  This only worked for my fine/thin hair when it was close to shoulder length since it would cause super clumping, and my hair started to look super thin and stringy. This also only gave me up to 2 day hair, then I had to wear it in a bun. Oh, and the biggest issue was that when I washed it at 7 am, my hair was reasonably dry by 3 pm, fully dry by night. So, I would go into work looking like a wet dog twice a week...  My hair was very well hydrated, had nice ringlets, but was quite heavy and limp. I only had two styles... curly and bun.   Edit: I really recommend this method for people with very dry hair that's shorter or thicker (amount) than mine is now. I do not use this method anymore because my hair is too thick, but when it was shoulder-length and had many layers, my hair looked and felt amazing and healthy!"

curlyhair,366wyx,gonesquatchin85,4,Sat May 16 19:22:04 2015 UTC,Sounds like I need to find this Cantu stuff.  My hair just goes maximum frizz all the time.  Sick curls man.
curlyhair,368vll,kahiggins84,3,Sun May 17 08:23:35 2015 UTC,Organix Coconut Water shampoo has been the best shampoo I've ever used for my curls. It smells like you just opened a fresh coconut and keeps my curls smooth and silky without that crappy sulfates. There's not much in the bottle but I only use a bit on my scalp so it lasts a long time
curlyhair,368vll,alleyreddit,1 point,Sun May 17 13:35:43 2015 UTC,Thank you!
curlyhair,368vll,genlovesmusic09,1 point,Sun May 17 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"I'm new to CG and trying to find the right products. Organix Coconut Water shampoo is on the product master list, but says it isn't CG. If it doesn't have sulfates, do you know what makes it not CG? Also, do you use the paired conditioner as well? Thanks!"
curlyhair,368vll,alleyreddit,1 point,Wed May 20 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what doesn't make it CG but I can tell you its really light weight and makes my curls really bouncy and clean. I couldn't afford to splurge on the conditioner so I purchased Aussie's Moist Conditioner and never looked back. Honestly the best conditioner I've ever tried. It smells like a piña colada and leaves my curls moisturized without being heavy. I'm pretty sure it has some silicones but I read somewhere that they can be washed out with most sulfate free shampoos. Honestly, I used to obsess over being completely CG and I always found my curls to be kinda sticky or dirty looking. I tried gels, mousse, different conditioners, shampoos, plopping, scrunching, all of that and it was way too much for me. I don't use any products aside from my shampoo and conditioner and I swear by air drying. Try out some things and do what works for you! CG isn't for anyone and its your hair. Sometimes I straighten the ends out so its wavy. Recently I've been putting cornrows in and waking up with a huge mane. Play around with it! As long as you use a good shampoo and conditioner and use some sort of heat protection when you use heat on your hair you'll be okay"
curlyhair,368vll,Curly_Alice,2,Fri May 22 01:01:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think cowashing is out. I had the same thing happen to my hair when I was using the same conditioner. I avoided protein and ended up over-moisturizing my hair (it was super straight and felt like cotton candy). A year later, I do at least one protein treatment a week.   Make sure you are moisturizing your hair enough. The coconut conditioner is just not moisturizing enough for your hair. You can try one of the other protein-free versions of suave, but I'd recommend following it with a more moisturizing rinse out or leave in conditioner. Don't think I'm telling you not to use shampoo, but don't give up on cowashing or protein because of the Suave Naturals Coconut conditioner or the curl and shine shampoo.  If you used the product and have a super moisturizing leave-in conditioner and your hair became brittle after the first use, forget what I said, but if it became brittle over time, I think moisturizing may help!"
curlyhair,368vll,Curly_Alice,2,Sun May 17 17:04:34 2015 UTC,Ok that's helpful. I picked up a bottle of suave strawberry conditioner- no protien in this one. I'll try co washing with that and follow with my tressemme naturals for leave in.

If I don't there's nothing left of it. Fairy knots, breakage, hair all over the house,...  I wear it down only on special occasions. There's thin hair, and then there's extremely thin hair I guess.

curlyhair,36713l,ScovilleMC,4,Sun May 17 07:35:57 2015 UTC,A stylist I went to once used a really wide toothed metal pick to separate the clumps.  The teeth on the pick are metal and thin so they don't frizz it out like your fingers would but they do separate the clumps. Something like that might help?

I scrunch conditioner (KCKT actually!) into it. Rinse hands, then scrunch gel (LA Looks). Then diffuse upside down.  It's not perfect, but it's what I've got so far. Good luck!"

curlyhair,36713l,fragilehearted,2,Mon May 18 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yep! I think others might use special towels (microfiber? I forget), but a tee works fine too - better than your standard terry cloth towel to absorb the moisture without causing frizz. Usually I tie the sleeves in a loose knot to keep it in place. :)"

You might be able to find a stylist that specialized in cutting curly hair. Most curly cuts are dry cut. I attempted one my myself yesterday because I am living overseas and desperate and it did not go well, but if you are only doing a trim it might be ok. I took several inches of previously bleached hair off my length, so it was much more chancy in retrospect, lol. It's not too bad, though. The curls hide some of it. Maybe you could find someone to watch some Deva cut videos with you who you trust enough to help. Best of luck!"
curlyhair,3678j1,diiizzzzoooo,4,Sat May 16 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"It probably needs tons of moisture - conditioner and leave-in conditioner. Try shampooing only every so often too, since dry hairs lack their natural oils and shampoo basically washes it all off. Either way, if you wair is naturally very curly and thick it will probably always have a tendency to grow ""upwards"" and resist styling. If you plan on growing it, as it grows it should eventually colapse on its own weight.  Hope that helped somehow."

Then I'm going to apply it before I go to bed,  wrap it with saran wrap and then an old tshirt and wash it out in the morning.   Last time I did henna I got pretty good results.  My hair is almost black and I get lovely red undertones.  This time I added hibiscus flower in addition to the amla I used last time.  Maybe I'll make a post later."

They just nailed the formula. I'm happy with the yellow one now but only because I'm paying more attention to my hair I guess. It was just easier using a gel made specifically for curly hair that actually worked. Plus I think it hurts more that it's gone because they just kinda took it from us with no warning and didn't offer a suitable replacement. The one in the green bottle makes my hair too soft (in a bad way), my curls too flat, no definition, no shape. My hair was just.. there. It wasn't me."

curlyhair,35ylbw,MostlyALurkerBefore,11,Thu May 14 16:25:43 2015 UTC,My left side has twice the volume. My right side always seems so flat in comparison :( I guess it's because of the way I part my hair. But if I part it down the middle it looks stupid!
curlyhair,35ylbw,littleotterpop,8,Thu May 14 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"That's the downfall of side-parting. Especially since I air-dry my hair, one side takes longer to dry and is curlier than the other side."

curlyhair,35ylbw,littleotterpop,1 point,Thu May 14 20:23:01 2015 UTC,sometimes I part in the middle while its drying and then when its ~50% dry I'll flop some over to one side. It gives the denser side a little more umph on top too.

curlyhair,35xwp7,shikaaboom,1 point,Fri May 15 03:23:04 2015 UTC,no it's not damaging at all...the only thing is that if you shampoo two days in a row of strips your natural oils and dries your hair out. but generally it's helpful to at least rewet your hair every morning to sort of revive your curls.  hope this helps
curlyhair,35xwp7,Foreveress,1 point,Sat May 16 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same thing. I washed my hair last night, plopped, dried, tried to do magic curl stuff...and failed. Is it terrible to wet the whole head (not co-wash/shampoo) and redo the styling?"
curlyhair,35xwp7,Noraart,1 point,Tue May 19 21:50:04 2015 UTC,I tried the refresh the second day curl trick today and it came out OK.  Spray bottle with water with a bit of light conditioner in it (just the top and front sides) then scrunched in a bit more gel.  This is definitely a learning process.
curlyhair,35xwp7,Foreveress,1 point,Tue May 19 23:00:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Every time I think I've learned something that works, the next time I try it things go wrong. It's awful to have a ""bad style day"" that lasts 3-5 days until the next round of trial-and-error in the shower."
curlyhair,35xwp7,xoleah25,3,Wed May 20 17:42:14 2015 UTC,I've been braiding my hair overnight after I get out of the shower and use gel. It looks alright... Should I be doing something different?
curlyhair,35xwp7,oe_leiderhosen,1 point,Fri May 15 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what you're going for?  I haven't done the braiding thing, but from what I've seen that's really good for producing smooth consistent waves.  Whereas if you styled and let it air-dry without touching it, your curls will be a lot less ""consistent"" but you'll be letting your hair do whatever it wants to do.  I prefer this, but plenty of people don't and that's fine."
curlyhair,35xwp7,ItIsSkinDeep,1 point,Sun May 17 14:41:34 2015 UTC,I assume that you want to keep on showering at night and letting your hair dry overnight.   One thing that you could try is twists instead of braids. Look up twist outs on youtube and you will find plenty of good tutorials. I've had good results from them. I've done both 2 stand and 3 strand twists and didn't notice much of a difference. But I would take my twists out before they fully dry.  Right now I'm getting good results by putting my wet hair into a pineapple (a high ponytail on the top of my head). I sleep on that and I have nice curls in the morning.

What do you do with your hair when you shower but don't wash your hair? I normally wear a shower cap, but I always seem to end up getting my hair a bit wet around the hairline, and I feel like my hair still gets frizzy from the humidity of the shower.  Also, what do you do if your scalp gets a bit oily? It always seems like my scalp gets kind of oily by the end of day 2. I know there are dry shampoos, but the ones I've looked at say to brush them into your hair, which we all know is a no-no for curly hair."

I do get water on my hairline and it does seem that humidity can be an issue, but re-wetting your hair helps. You can spray it down after your shower (and plop overnight if your hair likes that), or in the morning. I don't often do this though:   I never go past day 2 hair because I tend to have an oily scalp as well. I don't really have a solution, other than my preference is to get my hair wet every evening when I shower. Even if I'm not doing a whole scalp scrubbing and S2C, I like to get it wet, detangle and apply a bit of conditioner that I just barely squeeze out and don't rinse. It makes styling easier for me and takes the guesswork out of multiple-day hair since I pretty much always know what the situation is going to be after I remove the plop in the morning."

curlyhair,35xwp7,Prinsessa,1 point,Tue May 19 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"My routine - brush my hair before getting in the shower. Wash with clarifying argan oil shampoo (I'm trying to remove a demi permanent dye I put in awhile ago.) Condition with suave naturals coconut conditioner. Squish it out. Then I apply a mixture of whatever deep conditioner I want to try that day. So far using a mix of oils (argan & jojoba) with my morroccanoil conditioner has been too heavy. I tried just using straight herbal essence but that left me way too dry. I feel like the balance lies somewhere in between but I'm not sure what ingredients to look for. Obviously dimethicone helps a lot but I'm not sure how healthy it is to just saturate my hair with a dimethicone heavy product.  So anyway, then I squish the conditioner out and I apply Garnier defrizzing cream, it's supposed to protect against humidity but I think I may be using too much or something because it really weighs down my hair. I've been hesitant to try a gel because in the past it's made my hair sticky but the texture I see many girls get using it here is exactly what I want! Any suggestions on a good (and affordable) gel to try? I have tried garniers spray gel because it's what we have. Frizzease serum has worked for me in the past but I don't have any right now and it's been a few years. Maybe I will try it again."

I need heavier products but I've heard good things about the tresemme naturals radiant volume conditioner. It's lighter weight but also moisturizes. Plus it's silicone free, which might be good if you want to wean yourself off of the silicones.  Shampooing your hair every time isn't doing yourself any favors. It's drying out your hair. Maybe you could try alternating co-washing and using the shampoo?  The suave coconut conditioner has protein in it. Some people can't handle that much protein and it can make their hair feel dry.

They deposit very, very little color. There are ways to soften the red of henna. If you want more info on my process, shoot me a PM. I'd be happy to help."

I have light brown/ blonde hair naturally, but I wanted stronger color payoff because I have a lot of grays. My hair just also does not like to take color well for whatever reason. Even if the color worked better, I still prefer the ease of just mixing up the fine powder with some tea, lemon juice, and sugar and calling it a day. It's so much less hassle. Plus, I find it is easier to work through my hair. Way less gritty for me. I dunno. If it works for you, awesome, but for me the cost is too high for something I could achieve better results (for me) for less much less hassle. To each his own, I suppose :)"
curlyhair,35xwp7,ArrowsUp,1 point,Sun May 17 23:51:16 2015 UTC,"Male, I m not sure what type of curly hair I have. I am using I As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner and shampoo. I have been using the organic stuff for about 6 weeks now.   When I wash with the shampoo my hair becomes clean but it also becomes very flat which I dont like so I began to co-wash. If my hair feels dirty then I use the shampoo, otherwise it's only conditioner. MY problem is that now every time my hair dries, be it naturally, without using a towel, or with, it becomes very frizzy. I tried to co-wash everyday to see what happens but same problem, and then I changed it up and co-washed every three days and nothing changed. My hairs sometimes interlock as well which become even more annoying. Can anyone tell me if I am doing anything wrong or if I can change something to make the frizzy go away. My hair wasnt like this before going the organic route. The front of my hair is affected the most."

It's interesting that I can apply lots of the heaviest leave-in or creme to my hair when it's soaking wet, and it will take what it wants, but if I apply it to my damp or dry hair, I look like a greaseball.

curlyhair,35xwp7,Foreveress,1 point,Wed May 20 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"Here's a question I kinda feel silly asking: How important is it to add moisturizing products (leave-ins, milks, conditioners, etc) on days 2-4+ (or however long you go between full washes) of your hair? Am I damaging/drying out my hair by not adding more products on non-wash days?"
curlyhair,35xwp7,dinnerjam,1 point,Wed May 20 17:49:18 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No, not necessarily. Unless it's supper dry and cold where you are or you're putting heat to your hair I see no reason why not putting more product in on non-wash days.  Adding more products on non-wash days can create product build-up, leaving your hair less voluminous and/or stringy, all depending on the products of course. This happens to me, and it just makes me wash my hair more frequently.  Honestly, when it come down to it, if you feel like your hair if fine without extra moisturizing products then there's no need to use them. If not, maybe experiment with leave-ins and conditioners or whatever else. If you don't like the results of those, cut back on them or just don't use them."

This product was the best and most awesome product for my hair before I dumped all silicones/sulfates and went CG completely. I'm pretty sure it had silicones, but that was over a year ago and it's possible they changed the ingredients.    I think the last time I bought it was December 2013 and I used to buy 5-6 at a time because it was very hard to find at its normal price of approx $5.99/bottle.

The only cautionary one I found was more due to usage, not the ingredient itself:   PVP: It's water-soluble, so that's good. But it might cause build-up, as it's a fixative/binding agent. Not very likely in gels/mousses, but highly likely in shampoo/conditioner. It could also show poor results in certain types of weather. It tends to absorb moisture, so it may cause some sticky frizzies in extreme humidity, or flakiness in very dry weather."

curlyhair,35wek4,mermur,21,Thu May 14 01:53:09 2015 UTC,"It's going to be okay. I promise. I lived as a complete triangle-head during my awkward pixie grow out. You can handle this.  Keep up with the routine you have going if that's what works best for you. Don't give up now, or your curls will only go downhill from here.  Cute headbands will change your world. You don't need to look like a tweenager in them, either! They have fancy metal ones, and they make your messy hair look intentional and trendy. Roll with it. They can also amp up any hair style a few notches on the ~fancy scale~.  Another thing, BOBBY PINS are EVERYTHING! I ended up twisting a section near my face towards the back of my head a lot on the opposite side of my part. It made my style look more asymmetrical and voluminous.  A last resort for formal events: blow dry your hair straight on the cool setting. I know. Cold water sucks. But hey, no damage. Low heat won't mess up your hair either, but this isn't as refreshing in the summer heat...haha. I use a cheap Remington dryer and run a wide toothed comb through my hair as I dry it; its normally my shower comb. Use a little gel to slick it back into a super tight ponytail. You should be able to manage a tiny little stub ponytail. You might need to get bobby pins involved to secure runaway bits.  Then, attach a DRAWSTRING PONYTAIL. I know, it sounds weird. But its awesome. They're super cheap at places like Sally's and usually come curly (I guess because it looks more formal?), but you could go for straight if you want to feel like you want to change up your look a little more. These things are legit, mine was about nine dollars and definitely worth it, just make sure you get a color close enough to your own. I got one that matches my own color, but has lighter highlights, so my styles are more defined.  They come with these weird looking comb attachments inside that you secure to your hair, and a long stretchy thin hairtie inside that acts as the drawstring. I'm not the best with words, but there are plenty of YouTube tutorials.  Once you have tightened the ponytail around your own tiny ponytail, wrap the drawstring (that hairtie part) around your new ""ponytail"", giving the illusion of an actual hairtie. Then, you can style it into a cute bun if you want, or leave it as is. I like to divide my ponytail into a few sections and braid it, then wrap it around into a topknot, for a look that's put-together but still laid back enough that I don't feel overdone. Hell of a lot less permanent and expensive than extensions!!  Remember, it's just hair. Every time it grows back, you'll value it even more! I'm so sorry you got a bad cut, but just keep pampering your hair. You'll get back to where you want soon enough. :)"

The shape might not be the best right now but wait to see what it looks like when the curls regain their true shape, and if it looks really bad after that you can dry trim some pieces to make it into a more pleasant shape. Now might even be a good time to try some different products that you've been interested in as your hair might be more likely to soak it all up.

This may not be your style, but I'd recommend calling the salon and asking to speak to a manager. Relate your experience and the fact that the stylist ignored your clearly articulated wants and needs for your hair; if you don't trust this place, ask for a refund, but if you're willing to let them try and fix it, ask for a fix (free of charge). When this happened to my sister and she called to discuss, the manager immediately offered a redo at her convenience.  Regardless, I'm so sorry you had a bad haircut experience. As others have said, it isn't the end of the world! Keep up with your routine so your hair is healthy and will grow out as quickly as possible. There's cute styling options at every length.

curlyhair,35ui1l,diagetic_getdown,6,Wed May 13 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a solid 2b, but can get 2c if I use products in the right way.  First, I think your hair thickness is similar to mine, and with your length, it will be more difficult to get 2nd+ day hair that's not stringy.  I regularly get 3-4 day hair, but my technique and products change based on the cut and the length of my hair.   I'll make a few suggestions:    Make sure you do deep conditioning. Healthy hair behaves much better. This could help with the frizz. If I want to use gel and have 2nd+ day hair, I have to use a TON. Make sure your hair is coated in product.  *Technique: How do you apply your products. Squish to condish is very popular here because it works really well for some people.  Try switching the turbie twist for a t-shirt and plop. If it doesn't work, no harm, but plopping helps me out a bit. Diffusing: My hair takes 4+ hours to dry with any product, and 6+ if I use gel. I can't leave the apartment with it wet because it looks bad, and it will get messed up if I accidentally touch it. My hair lasts much longer when I diffuse it 80% dry.  Products: Make sure your products are working for your hair. I have to use heavy products to keep my hair moisturized, but if I want to wash and go, I use light products that end up leaving my hair dry if I do it too much. Does your hair love/hate glycerin? Protein? There are products that are just made for your hair, you just have to find them. And, since you are using sulfates, you might need something just a bit more moisturizing that you're using.  Do you need a trim? This makes my hair behave much better!   Of course, all of these tips might not work for you, but I hope they're of some help!"
curlyhair,35ui1l,Curly_Alice,1 point,Wed May 13 19:30:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the advise! I do plop just usually after drying a little because I've found that when I don't I get really big clumps that don't like to break apart and make me look like I have bald spots. Also it seems like the product gets left in the tshirt if I don't dry my hair beforehand. I don't usually diffuse because it always seems to do weird things to my hair. Plus I tend to wake up in the morning a little too late to have enough time to blow dry.  I really don't know if my hair likes protein or not. Is there any way to test that out? What kind of results should I get if a protein treatment is actually working? I also don't really have a deep conditioner that doesn't leave my hair greasy or weighed down. Do you have any recommendations?  I have a hair cut scheduled for a week from today! My current cut is an angled Bob that's grown out over about 9 months from chin length to this so it's definitely the wrong shape and cut for this length. I'm hoping to add some layers and to make the front the same length as the back.
curlyhair,35ui1l,uhhidontcare,2,Wed May 13 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything they've said but I'll add my but. In addition to using the right amount of gel, so a ton, I clip my roots so it's not weighed down. Then I use hairspray. My hair isn't soft anymore, but no one touches it, including me, so I'm okay with that. Second day curls I just touch up a couple if I care enough but always add a bit more hairspray. It's been the game changer for me."
curlyhair,35ui1l,Curly_Alice,1 point,Thu May 14 03:19:35 2015 UTC,What kind of hairspray do you use? I used to use hairspray way back in the day but haven't since I've started trying to care for my hair
curlyhair,35ui1l,Curly_Alice,1 point,Thu May 14 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"As for the deep conditioner, I've tried a few different products/methods. What worked for me when I first started taking care of my hair is way different from what works now. My scalp is also not very oily anymore, and using gel helps keep my roots from looking oily. At first, I had to avoid the scalp or my hair would look oily. I don't do this anymore.   Deep conditioners I've used:    Shea Moisture Raw Shea masque Yes to Carrots Pampering conditioner Generic Value Products Conditioning Balm   For these to make my hair really moisturized, I need to leave it on at least 1/2 hour, and heat helps, so sometimes I'll blow it with the blow dryer for a few minutes and let it cool. I've tried applying them dry or wet. If I apply one dry, I'll throw in some oil because my hair loves oil treatments. After I do the deep conditioner, I'll also cowash my scalp to make sure it's free of heavy conditioner/ oils.  My hair is very fine, and loves protein. I think if you have fine hair or porous hair, it might like protein. I discovered through trial and error that my just looks curlier after a good protein treatment. At first, I avoided protein because I thought my hair was sensitive to it, but it slowly became straight and bland, so I tried an overnight protein treatment. The thing with protein is, that if you go overboard or your hair doesn't like it, a good moisturizing deep conditioner will help. I would recommend finding a deep conditioner first. If you use too much protein, you hair feels like straw, but it's easily remedied. I usually leave it on overnight, but initially I would recommend leaving it on 1/2 hour to 1 hour to see how your hair reacts.   Protein treatments I've tried:   Coconut oil. This isn't actually a protein, it's a fat, but it works to seal in protein. I use this with any protein treatment because my hair loves it Generic Value Products (Sally's) Reconstructor: This is okay with my hair, but I haven't tried my favorite since I purchased this an my hair might have changed Avalon Organics Thickening Biotin-B complex Conditioner: This has wheat protein listed to the end, but my hair loved this last year and I'm gong to repurchase Aubrey Organics GPB Conditioner is also recommended, but I haven't tried it.    Layers always make my hair behave much better! Good luck with the cut!"
curlyhair,35ui1l,poler_bear,1 point,Fri May 15 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for long responses! I have tried a deep conditioner but I've never let it stay on my hair for more than 15 minutes and I've never added heat so I think that might be my first step. I already have the Shea Moisture one so I'll have to test that out.  For the protein treatments, do you just put the products you mentioned in your hair and let it sit over night? I'm assuming you wear a cap or something."
curlyhair,35ui1l,Curly_Alice,1 point,Fri May 15 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I usually wear a cap at night, but sometimes just throw a towel over my pillow. I'd recommed that you don't start overnight in case your hair doesn't like the protein so much."

curlyhair,35ui1l,iusedtohave,1 point,Thu May 14 07:05:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on my hair. Right now my hair is healthy, but my stylist wanted to try ""something new"" and my hair is NOT behaving. I have lots of layers, but they were cut in a way that my hair looks super thick and one length... I have to use heavy products in my hair for now to weigh it down so I don't look like a poufball with long hair.   For a ""good haircut,"" I'll use    At least once a week: Coconut oil over night with protein/keratin treatment (GVB Hair Reconstructor, avalon organics biotin b-complex therapy thickening conditioner,) or sometimes just coconut oil, or if my hair is dry, with a moisturizing mask/conditioner (GVB conditioning balm or shea moisture raw shea mask) Trader Joes Tea tree tingle for cowash Shea Moisture raw shea conditioner (rinse out) Leave-in? GVP Conditioning balm, Kinky Curly Knot Today Cantu Shea Butter curl activating cream Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie Eco styler Krystal Gel or LA Looks Sport Gel   For Wavy hair, I use the same products in the shower, but use the following stylers:   Cantu Shea Butter curl activating cream Kinky Curly Knot Today Shea Moisture Yucca and Plantain Styling Milk. The curl and style milk is usually too heavy for my hair.   Now, I'm trying out different gels/creams/stylers. I'm looking at heavier stuff to weigh my hair down. I've tried Eden Bodyworks Curl creme, which is too heavy unless I use it while my hair is dripping wet and apply gel over. I'm loving kinky Curly Curling Custard as a lightweight gel, but still use a heavier gel."
curlyhair,35ui1l,sirhelix,2,Fri May 15 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"My routine (disclaimer, I'm a Lush junkie and I think I have hard water so I use some sulfates).  1) Wash with Seanik shampoo bar  2) Condition with Jungle solid conditioner bar  3) If my hair needs a little extra conditioning, spritz on some It's a 10 leave in after getting out of the shower (I'm still working on a sample from Ulta, not sure if I would rebuy)  4) Dry my hair for a few minutes in a turbie towel (micro fiber towel, I still put it up and do the ""twist"" because it's the only thing that seems to work)  5) Add my product. This time I used Lush's Sea Spray followed by Zeste. The Zeste was just a sample, but it's seriously extra hold gel, which I like, so I think I will purchase this  6) Plop on my way to work (~20 min) and remove  7) Let it air dry the rest of the way, then scrunch out the crunch (zeste is pretty damn crunchy)  I did that yesterday. For my second day routine:  1) Before bed I put in some of Lush's dry shampoo that I can't remember the name of. I don't put my hair up in a pineapple or anything because I feel like it flattens my curls even more...  2) Wake up and spray some more Sea Spray and add some Zeste.   This is definitely the best my hair has ever looked on a second day. I think it's because I let my hair dry a little before adding product and plopping. Also the serious super hold from the Zeste. I still have quite a bit of frizz and don't know how to tame that. I feel like adding more product on the second day doesn't help much. I do have more volume on the second day, which I like. I wish I could even it out more though."

curlyhair,35ui1l,himisscas,1 point,Thu May 14 00:28:23 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I can't use Deva products because I have some kind of allergic reaction to some ingredient in their fragrance. I'll have to check out the Aveeno Naturals.  I'm a 90% ponytail girl too. I've been trying to get away from it though because I have a bunch of breakage about halfway up my hair without having a ton of split ends so I think it's from all the ponytail holders. The only way I can think to keep that from happening is to wear it down as often as possible.

curlyhair,35vfmj,suite-dee,3,Wed May 13 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"Since you have color treated hair your situation is more complicated. What the other poster said about the sulfate in your purple shampoo is correct, but I'm guessing that you're using it because otherwise your color would turn brassy? I mean, using a harsh cleanser isn't ideal, but neither is that! You might have a look at the sidebar and do a subreddit search to see if you can find some info about product recommendations for color treated hair. I would be wary of going cold turkey on your special shampoo until you know how to maintain your color.   Also keep in mind that color treating your hair can change its texture and curl pattern, so you might have different (curlier?) results if you aren't dying it. If you choose to grow it out, maybe you could hang on to your purple shampoo for a while and get yourself a really good creamy, moisturizing conditioner.   Since you're looking for gels: Eco Styler's Olive oil gel is what I use. I know it says ""maximum hold"" but it's really not heavy or sticky at all. I have to use quite a lot for my thick and long hair, but I think just a bit of it could work for you. It dries very soft and non-sticky. Although if your hair really gets weighed down easily, you could try a mousse instead of a gel or cream. I think Herbal Essences has one that's CG."
curlyhair,35vfmj,rosegrim,1 point,Thu May 14 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! I don't have to use the purple shampoo, it just makes my hair look a lot whiter as opposed to just regular cool blonde once my roots grow out. I think a mousse is a great idea! I'll check the Herbal Essences one out to see if it's soft enough for my hair!   I'm also going to research and see if there's a group or blog about people who use the CG method with color treated hair. I only have the new root growth colored, not the whole thing, and my stylist is great at making sure it stays in the best condition possible for bleached hair. Hopefully I can have the best of both worlds- blonde and curly."

I find that my curls are more defined when I air dry it as opposed to using a diffuser.   As soon as I brush my hair, if I do at all, the curls are pretty much gone.  Any advice? I've tried plopping when my hair was longer, I can definitely try it again.  The only product I use is It's A 10 Miracle Leave In Conditioner, and only when my hair is wet.

curlyhair,35r9ep,veganxxx,3,Wed May 13 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"I think you will get a more feminizing effect if you don't skim your hair back but allow it to fall to the side and forward, in order to break up your hairline.

This will amp up the texture! You're so cute just with the headband, though, so don't sweat it!

curlyhair,35owli,i_like_the_broccoli,27,Tue May 12 08:52:15 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, thought I’d share my hair/routine/products with you all!!!   Everywhere I’ve lived in Aus has been crazy humid and I’ve always battled with my curls. When I was younger it was more because I didn’t know how to handle them, but I’ve really got a routine and products down now that works year round (even in these crazy humid QLD summers!) I’ve spend thousands of dollars on products over the years too, and have actually settled on pretty much the cheapest ones I’ve ever used too. Haha.  Products- I use Tresemme Naturals conditioner which you can buy from Priceline and sometimes Chemist Warehouse/ other pharmacies, and I use this Taft gel which you can get from both places mentioned above, and also Coles. They’re almost always on special too, I can usually get the large conditioner for around $6 a bottle and the gel between $3-5.   That’s all the product I use- my hair gets shampooed every 6-8 weeks when I get my hair coloured and that’s it! My routine on hair washing day- wash my hair really thoroughly with hot water, then get a HUGE palm of conditioner and comb it through with my fingers, then my wide-tooth comb. (I use HEAPS of conditioner, but I have long hair). Leave it in for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly. I squeeze as much moisture out as I can before stepping out the shower.   I put my hair up in a plop immediately with one of my husbands shirts, then I deodorise/moisturise/sunscreen and get dressed.   When that’s all done, I take down the plop and get the gel- using about a 20c piece worth at a time, I smooth it over the top of my head, then scrunch it to each side (a new bit of gel for each section), then I tip my head upside down and scrunch from underneath. I use a far bit of product, it goes fairly ‘crunchy’ when it’s dry. I have a huge amount of hair so drying naturally takes all day, so I diffuse. I actually have it worked out and timed so I know exactly how long to dry my hair for- I set a timer for 4 minutes and dry with my head upside down, then 4 minutes to one side, then 4 minutes to the other, then I repeat. My hair is about 80% dry by the time I finish and I like to leave it about an hour of air drying before scrunching out all the gel (if I’m going out immediately I’ll dry it a little more).   I wash my hair like this twice a week usually and my 2nd/3rd/4th day curls still look good enough to wear down! I put it up in a pineapple when I sleep, then the next day I’ll let it down, dampen my hands a little and put a tiny bit of gel in my hands and rub them together, then smooth down any crazy bits… and that’s it.  Edit Here is a pic to demonstrate my hair pre CG. This is shampooing/conditioning, usually with something that was $30 a bottle, and using some kind of curl cream and letting it dry naturally."
curlyhair,35owli,teagang,4,Tue May 12 08:52:21 2015 UTC,"That's great advice!   I just wanna ask, how do you pineapple? I have long hair too, and I feel like when I try to pineapple it, it just becomes a high ponytail and the curls are destroyed overnight. Am I doing it wrong?"
curlyhair,35owli,Lysalla,6,Tue May 12 11:11:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's right! I don't do a ponytail as my husband would suffocate in my hair, I do a really high messy bun-type thing. I do get a bit of a kink in the morning where my hair band was sitting, but my hair just stays where I put it- so after dampening my hands with water/gel and smoothing it over, the kink disappears."
curlyhair,35owli,Lysalla,3,Tue May 12 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"You have gorgeous hair and your routine is very similar to mine except that I don't diffuse (I should though, mine also takes a day to dry and my sinuses kill me by the end :/). I also dye my hair so I am on the same boat as you. Having said all that, my curls are nowhere near as defined as yours. So I have a few questions!  Do you condition your hair only once? I don't know if this is whats wrong with my hair but I wet my hair, then use a palm-full of the same conditioner as you use! Then I massage my scalp. I do this perhaps twice-three times before I leave a hair mask in. Then one final (and less) conditioning which I don't wash out completely. And like yourself, I try to squeeze out as much water as I can before stepping out. Anyway, my question is, do you really just condition your hair once, or did you use to condition it more than once but realised it didnt work?. I guess I am really doubting my routine in the shower and I just wanted your previous routine (if there is one) vs the one you've described here!  My second question is the hair dye. Are you using a special 'curly friendly' type hair colourant (I dont even know if there is any?) or is it the one you have been using before going CG? And my final question is (I am sorry about this!): Have you ever not shampooed your hair after dying it? Just wondering as I dye mine every 6-8 weeks as well but I dont use the shampoo that regularly (I just wash the dye out with the conditioner which may actually be pretty daft but I am honestly just experimenting at this point).   Thanks in advance, your hair is absolutely gorgeous!"
curlyhair,35owli,crazy_brain_lady,3,Tue May 12 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"I do only condition my hair once. If it's been several days since I've washed it then there's a fair bit of gel in there, so I'll put my hair under the shower and just scrub with hot water for 30 secs to a minute so it's completely wet, then I load it up with conditioner. If it's super tangled, I'll finger comb my entire head before using my wide-tooth comb, then let it sit for a few minutes. I actually don't use any kind of hair mask, I have issues with putting extra protein in my hair... It goes coarse and stringy, so I really put nothing else in my hair besides the 2 products listed.   My previous routine was really just shampoo/condition (I used to use the Nak silver shampoo and conditioner), towel dry, then I used a curl cream (I've tried several brands). Honestly cream doesn't hold up against the humidity at ALL, don't get quite as much definition, and my curls were ruined by the time I woke up in the morning.  As for the hair colour- I'm not even sure which brand my hairdresser uses. Because I go blonde, it is quite harsh on my hair. I usually get either a half or full head of blonde foils and then a full head of toner. Between having my curls brushed out/ colour applied/ shampooing/ then having it cut, my hair is usually pretty mental the first wash after the hairdresser and then it goes back to normal. I've never not shampooed it after colour, I'd hate to have peroxide left on my scalp. Hairdresser actually shampoos it 3 times then puts a treatment in.  Honestly, the 2 really big things that gave me definition were switching to gel instead of a cream, and diffusing. I think because my hair is long as well, leaving it to dry for hours on end would make my curls drop a lot... kind of flatten against my head. Diffusing causes all kinds of magic to happen, and you don't really need to wait for it!!!! Definitely wait as long as you can after diffusing to scrunch out the gel though, I try to leave mine an hour or two even AFTER diffusing so my hair is completely dry before scrunching again. If I do it before, it can go a bit flat or a little bit fluffy. If I'm leaving the house straight away I'll diffuse it longer."

This is one of those rare posts where OP actually explains their routine before being asked for it, and also answers others' questions in detail!

curlyhair,35owli,Eurycerus,2,Tue May 12 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"It can get pretty tangled after day 3, it still looks good enough to wear down but where the hair band goes when I pineapple overnight, or if I wear it up, it can get pretty hard to even finger comb through.

When I was shampooing my hair regularly and using products that weren't great for my hair it would be greasy and horrible, and I'd have to wash my hair every 2nd day (or every day!) I go to the gym and work out most days too, if I've had a particularly sweaty workout I'll wash my hair that day but it usually doesn't affect it at all."

I just stopped using shampoo cold turkey, honestly my hair was weird and flat for a few weeks then it started to look and feel so nice. It's always soft and shiny, whereas before it looked dull and kind of flat. Also it almost always felt dry, yet my roots were oily. Was really weird.   The colour pictured is about as 'brassy' as it gets too, I thought my hair would go orange without using a silver shampoo/conditioner but I really love the colour and it holds up really well."

curlyhair,35s8ez,masona23,1 point,Wed May 13 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"It looks like she needs a little more moisture maybe?  That will probably help with the tangling.  I have fine hair as well, and I Suave naturals never really had enough oomph for me.  I would try Tresemme Naturals or Yes to Carrots and see if you get less frizz.    Also, I don't think Frizz Ease is CG, so if you notice some buildup on her hair after multiple uses of it, you might need to shampoo."

curlyhair,35s31k,devvy_downer,1 point,Wed May 13 01:13:58 2015 UTC,When I have used dry shampoo in the past I would end up drying my hair and my scalp would over compensate and get super oily. Maybe you could try spreading the oils around with a boar bristle brush at night since it seems like your hair is more wavy than curly. It takes a shit ton of time but it really does help spread the oils and keep hair clean.
curlyhair,35s31k,maw-maw,1 point,Wed May 13 01:52:43 2015 UTC,Shampoo isn't bad. Try an organic baby shampoo. Condition with a small amount of coconut oil.
curlyhair,35s31k,aquasharp,1 point,Wed May 13 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, oh, me!  I actually have really similar hours to you, too!  I work out 6-7am, and have to be at work at 8, usually I'm there at about 7:40 though because my gym is super close to my work.  I shower and get ready at the gym.  I shower there, co wash with V05 because it's so thin that it's really easy to scrub around with your fingertips and get your sweaty scalp clean fast!  I then apply my Tressemme conditioner (Perfectly Undone or Naturals) and comb it out with a detangling comb (makes it go fast, it's not a wide tooth comb but its soft so it detangles more than brushes), and partially rinse out the conditioner, and do a little S2C.  I scrunch with a t shirt (a technical tee actually and I feel like it does a better job than a regular cotton shirt), then put it up in a hair wrap.  I wear the hair wrap while I do my makeup, get dressed, etc, a total of about 10-15 min.  Then I scrunch with the tech tee again, wave my hair around a little to dry a bit more, and tada!  I usually put no product in before work because I work in a medical lab where I often have to put my hair in a scrub cap, so product is a waste on work days for me.  However, the extra conditioner I left in keeps the curly fairly well when I get to wear my hair down all day!  I guess it all kinda depends on your timing.  If you're concerned about having wet hair when you go into work you can add some diffusing, but that will add a little more time..."

I feel like that doesn't make sense, but it's like a loose unfinished ponytail/bun thing? As long as the headband is loose (I tend to use actual stretchy headbands and not just hair ties for this reason) then your hair doesn't crease over ight and stays out of your face.

I was sick of having to clarify every other day to get rid of the white flakes.   I guess I am confused, do you want to go CG? You say co-washing makes you nervous because of the silicones, but you can choose products without them.  What works for me: Tresemme Naturals or Suave Naturals Coconut for co-washing, using a sulfate free shampoo from Shea Moisture and having to supplement with Neutrogena T-Sal for dandruff at least once a week, SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk & Curls Goddess Curls gel for styling (the former smells amazing, the latter has absolutely no smell, which is kinda why I like it-- it just WORKS, no frills).

curlyhair,35s8k1,hashtagphag,1 point,Thu May 14 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"I use VO5 Moisture Milk Strawberries and Cream for co-washing... cheap, lightweight, and CG-friendly.     For my shampoo days, I use Shea Moisture Superfruit 10-in-1 Shampoo. It's pricier than what you're using now, but to put it in context - I use it 3x a week, washing just the roots as well, and am maybe halfway through the bottle I bought a month ago. Maybe even a third of the way through, I can't recall exactly from my shower this morning. A little goes a long way with that brand.     If I find myself in need of clarifying, I use Shea Moisture African Black Soap Deep Cleansing Shampoo. I only used it once this month, and it was for experimentation purposes, not due to actual product buildup.   All of these are available at Walgreens, CVS, Target, Walmart, etc.   That said, ""curl defining"" will come more from your after-shower routines - the way you dry your hair, products used, etc. Since you mentioned getting good results with leave-in-plus-mousse, then there's part of your answer... use them both. You could try braiding and then plopping your hair at night - you saw that braiding helps encourage the curls the next morning, and plopping can help keep it all together for either air-drying or diffusing the next day. I would definitely recommend ditching the straightener routine though, that's going to cause damage.   BTW, your Tresemme mousse contains Cyclopentasiloxane, which is a non-water-soluble silicone. It sounds like it's not a super-heavy 'cone, but I'm concerned by the description I've found of ""acts a mild water repellent by forming a protective barrier"". I believe your Herbal Essences mousse is fine though."

I never noticed it giving me silicone build up issues, but I am pretty good with using the vinegar water mixture at least once a week, maybe once every two weeks, so that could be why. And I don't do the braiding/straightening very often, in fact I barely straighten my hair at all. The last time my hair was cut I was told it didn't even need to be cut because of damage, just cut to style. Anyways, how much is the Shea Moisture etcetc? And it is available at walmart? I mean I don't mind spending a little bit extra, and I only wash maybe 2-3 times a week, I generally was my hair every three to four days and I have a small bottle of shampoo that lasts over a month or two."

curlyhair,35nh50,BlackbirdSinging,6,Tue May 12 00:35:38 2015 UTC,"I have a carols daughter refresher spray and for the most part I like it, it's almost gone but I won't be buying it again. It smells SO strong. Like it doesn't smell bad, but it's extremely strong and I'm not a fan of that. But it did make me discover that refresher sprays are amazing."
curlyhair,35nh50,HobbitLass,3,Tue May 12 08:08:57 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but of all the products I've tried, it's the best. I use the cupacu anti-frizz shampoo and conditioner and marula cleanser and they leave my hair softer and more manageable than any other similarly-priced product I've tried."
curlyhair,35nh50,calibear09,3,Tue May 12 04:02:57 2015 UTC,I love Shea moisture! Although recently I got the Cantu curl cream because it was way cheaper and I like that too. It's nice finder less expensive stuff for my hair.

curlyhair,35nh50,bikesboozeandbacon,2,Tue May 12 05:03:44 2015 UTC,Ooh! Can we have list of your products with reviews?! And your hair type..? Too much to ask... Sorry! Lol
curlyhair,35qmum,ellekay789,2,Tue May 12 18:33:16 2015 UTC,I think it looks awesome! I wish I had the courage to do something similar. Awkward is the last word I would use.
curlyhair,35qmum,hashtagphag,1 point,Tue May 12 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"I think it looks pretty cute, I wish I had the courage to go short like that! What do you feel is awkward about it or is making you unhappy?"
curlyhair,35qmum,dannygreenscousin,1 point,Tue May 12 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"I think it looks great. Only cut your hair short if you can rock it, and I think you totally rock it."
curlyhair,35o8c6,skeptic26,11,Tue May 12 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"Me!  Whenever people ask me if I straighten my hair ever I usually tell them, ""I have a few times but when I look in the mirror it's like I'm looking at a stranger with the same face as me, and I don't like it."""
curlyhair,35o8c6,brattylilduck,4,Tue May 12 04:02:14 2015 UTC,I look totally different with straight hair.  It's weird how much it can change your outward demeanor unintentionally.
curlyhair,35o8c6,eraser-dust,3,Tue May 12 06:23:12 2015 UTC,"I go from intimidating face to resting bitch face when I straighten my hair, it's really weird"
curlyhair,35o8c6,imjustafangirl,1 point,Tue May 12 23:05:21 2015 UTC,I go from eccentric artist (which I am) to awkward fashionista.  It's a weird transition.
curlyhair,35o8c6,eraser-dust,5,Tue May 12 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie my alter ego is a party girl cause if I'm spending all that time to ""look good"" I better have a damn good time with it."
curlyhair,35o8c6,Throwaway1_618,3,Tue May 12 14:57:25 2015 UTC,Definitely! Sadly a lot of people I know prefer my alter ego. lol
curlyhair,35o8c6,BunnyCurls,6,Tue May 12 09:09:38 2015 UTC,I feel you there ): MY HAIR IS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS CURLY MASS
curlyhair,35o8c6,is2gstop,2,Tue May 12 16:38:34 2015 UTC,Preach!
curlyhair,35o8c6,BunnyCurls,2,Thu May 14 12:44:50 2015 UTC,"My alter ego is like my evil twin,  that's why I don't do it"
curlyhair,35o8c6,DiegoFuego,2,Tue May 12 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I straightened my hair recently and my roommate was upset the whole time. ""You just don't look like you!"""
curlyhair,35o8c6,lizthelizars,1 point,Tue May 12 18:12:23 2015 UTC,I look like my cousin. It's the only time I see the family resemblance.
curlyhair,35o8c6,ILeaveMarks,1 point,Tue May 12 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"does your hair hold the straightness? i don't even have very curly hair, just a wavy frizzy mess, but i can't get my hair to stay straight for anything. curls with a wand will last all week without any product if i didn't wash my hair, however."
curlyhair,35o8c6,lemoncatparty,1 point,Wed May 13 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"My hair will hold straight basically until I get it wet. Mine is extremely thin though, and I use heat protection products, hairspray, etc. and I bought a rather expensive straightener so it can get to an extremely high heat."
curlyhair,35o8c6,ironranger88,1 point,Wed May 13 03:25:08 2015 UTC,Your curly hair is gorgeous!
curlyhair,35pv5u,CaitlinMichelle,3,Tue May 12 15:09:18 2015 UTC,"Based on that recent picture, it looks to me like you might need more moisture (deep conditioning), and are getting product build-up. Your hair looks like it's weighed down and your curls are separating instead of clumping.   Can you provide more detail about the exact products you're using? Cheap doesn't necessarily mean bad, we all have our budgets. It may be that you're using products that aren't right for your hair type though. You mentioned long hair, and thin density... is your hair fine, medium, or coarse? That'll make a difference too. Any idea if you're low porosity, medium, or high?"
curlyhair,35pv5u,hashtagphag,3,Tue May 12 20:48:40 2015 UTC,My girlfriend does this. Not sure if that helps or not.
