HSPulls,3e2obp,Qwad35,5,Tue Jul 21 14:21:27 2015 UTC,Omg. Dual legendaries is one thing...but two golden legendaries...holy shit man that is some luck you've got.
HSPulls,3e2obp,Qwad35,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"I shat my pants, my pack luck is usally shit. 40 dust per pack for days, but today was diffrent."
HSPulls,3e2obp,Arisalis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"I won't even lie, I am so fucking jealous. I have gotten 6 legendaries in the 200 packs or so I have opened, including Nat Pagle, Tinkmaster, Cho, and Mukla. The fact that you got two amazing legendaries, as well as in golden, is making me so salty lol.  On another note, congrats on your reddit cakeday."

HSPulls,3e1ryo,spriteguy113,3,Tue Jul 21 08:08:51 2015 UTC,U opened a gvg pack what did you expect?
HSPulls,3dtk77,DonkiesX,3,Sun Jul 19 09:06:05 2015 UTC,Congrats on the 1600 dust
HSPulls,3dtk77,howtohowz,2,Sun Jul 19 10:24:49 2015 UTC,"Although it's not golden, I just got this card in the last pack I opened.  The funny thing about it though, was that the match before (this last Tavern Brawl) I had played it and won using that legend. One of the other cards I found in the pack, was also on the board with the legend in game."
HSPulls,3dtk77,AshantiClan,2,Mon Jul 20 06:37:14 2015 UTC,Nice Dr. Boom
HSPulls,3dtfwp,gimiCv2,2,Sun Jul 19 07:48:18 2015 UTC,Wow! Those have to be some of the best packs I have ever seen opened consecutively!
HSPulls,3dsbgu,jglolz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:55:13 2015 UTC,Nice. My second was King Mukla.
