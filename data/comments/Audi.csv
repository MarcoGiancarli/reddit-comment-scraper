Audi,3e3hkt,Ajgajlic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:32 2015 UTC,Just my two cents but I don't like the styling. It looks like it went backwards in terms of aggressive styling and tried to be more luxury instead but got designer's block.
Audi,3e3hkt,audiberry,2,Tue Jul 21 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"lol at making the TT ""more masculine"". at least they know its target audience, as made apparent later in the article when they say ""If the driver is feeling up for a brisk, fun drive, she or he can bring the speedo and rev counter.."". I have literally never heard someone use the phrasing ""she or he"" before (specifically, in that order), but it totally fits in this context."

I had already gone to a VW dealer that also determined it was not the gas cap and wanted to do a smoke test to check for leaks.  That is when I took it to LotR.  After replacing a few parts and not having any luck clearing the code, I decided to just keep the new parts anyways and he didn't charge me labor.   Ended up going to a second VW dealer.  They replaced the gas cap for like 30 bucks or something and it was fine.  Just a bit of a frustrating experience."

Audi,3e2nvb,mrwobblez,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:54 2015 UTC,"Owner of a Q5 TDI here. I love the engine - it has torque for days. We drove the Q3 and it felt small and underpowered - even though the engine should have enough oomph for a car that size.   The Q5 2.0 feels completely underpowered. We're expecting our first, so the extra room in the cabin + extra storage room was kind of the deal breaker in the Q3 for us. The Q3 feels a bit cheaper on the inside in terms of touch and feel.  If you can swing it, I'd go Q5."
Audi,3e2nvb,rattygloves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"I've drive the Q3 2.0T and Q5 3.0T, so I can kind of answer some questions.  I'm sure many people will disagree with me, but here are my thoughts.  Both have plenty of space for four adults, I thought the the Q3 back seats were only slightly smaller, but the cargo space is much smaller.  Both have very pleasant interiors, but I'm not a fan of the permanently-popped-up-even-though-it-looks-like-it-should-fold-down screen in the Q3.  Other small features (like the climate control knobs) felt slightly cheaper in the Q3 than the Q5.  Both are smooth and quiet.  The steering in the Q3 felt a bit more precise than the Q5, but both were great.  My biggest complain with the Q3 is that 2.0T engine.  It feels slow.  Slower than smaller engines you can get in economy brands (both the Mazda CX-5 and Ford Escape felt more peppy to me).  I haven't driven the Q5 2.0T, but I would imagine the extra weight of the Q5 would negate much of the power increase in the engine.  For what it's worth, I think the 3.0T is fantastic."

The  q5 2.0 does not feel any different than our q3 2.0  The interior finish is nicer in the 5. The room is bigger in the 5 and it also looks nicer. There is no comparison.  The 5 is another level  but ONLY if you get the 3.0. If you can afford it. We also tested the vw tiguan.....not even close to the finish and quality of an Audi q3, but then again you are paying more. We simply couldn't afford the q5  3.0 .....next time, but my wife is super happy with her q3. No regrets. Our second Audi."

Audi,3e232z,jasonlitka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:57 2015 UTC,"I'm just using the language the Audi tech used.  He said something like ""the brake rotor is warped, both brake pads and the both discs now need to be replaced.""  I took it on the first only highway run starting yesterday.  Drove maybe 100km of the trip before noticed a subtle braking judder effect.  At first I thought I was braking on a bad road surface - a gentle thud-thud-thud noticeable when braking.  Over the next 200km the effect got worse and was by the end sending vibrations through the steering and making me wonder if the brakes were going to suddenly malfunction - scary.  Called the nearest Audi dealer, he was only 40km away.  He diagnosed as described. I turned back and drove back approx 330km to home.  So I would guess it did approx 1000km of generally low-speed driving before this trip began.  Had one trip into Vermont in the snow in January (400km maybe?) and then it has been things like a few grocery runs, going to the cinema (once!) and taking the car for Swedish inspection.     The effect MAY have been present before, but the effect only began being really noticeable when at highway speeds.  Before that, would have been driving at Sweden's low speed limits (usually 50kmh to 70kmh)."
Audi,3e232z,jasonlitka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"I will add that the tech said that there may have been debris in between the brake components during the install as that can cause what he described as ""warping"".  Maybe not the same ""race driver"" reference point you describe.  I certainly haven't driven this thing fast here, nor braked hard - Swedish speed limits are very low."
Audi,3e232z,fridgetarian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, and to answer the ""sitting"" question - sorry! - shipping took approx 5-6 weeks, car was immobile during that - car sat idle other than inspection related trips for maybe 2 weeks at a time, over about 8 weeks?  Took me a while to get insurance at a decent price. - car has seen very light use as described above - I've been using an older motorcycle as main mode of transportation since late April.

They are clearly similar to my A8l wheels which are obviously for a much larger car. As I mentioned best measured guess is 18x8.5 for what is on there with a 35mm offset. I don't think they are 18x8 or anything else, BUT I am certain the measurement of 35mm offset is right.  I think OEM is 17x7.5 at 57mm or 18x8 at 57mm but I can't find reliable info about the that (two local Audi dealers gave me different offset. One 57mm the other 45mm.) But tons of people seem to use 45mm offset too. Tyre size according to manual was 225/40 for 17 or 18 inch. What I have as an extra set I could install is 18x8 at 45mm offset and 245/40 r18. Seems very very close UNLESS someone knows more about that.  I am in the states. New York myself.  edit.... I might be mixing up 57mm and 53mm offset. I know it was a 50 number for what the dealer said and a few other sources said. I also know 45mm is mentioned elsewhere and another local Audi dealer said that was correct."

Audi,3dvxsc,imjustsomeucsdkid,4,Mon Jul 20 02:45:51 2015 UTC,This is the horrifying truth that made me laugh my ass off.
Audi,3dvxsc,atheism_101,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:21 2015 UTC,What problems do the 2.7t's generally have? I'm just curious because I have one and haven't run into any major problems as of yet. Other than my front bags needing to be replaced shortly after I got it. But that was only about $300 to fix.

Audi,3dz607,taxcheat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:44 2015 UTC,Yup. Just make sure the one you get has the ipod connector since there's also a usb version. Pretty sure that at least half of all Audis have this thing. Mine has worked on both KitKat and Lollipop.

Audi,3dzst5,DTLAsmellslikepee,4,Mon Jul 20 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"They are hands down worth it. However, for you it wouldn't kick in for another 41K miles. Your new car warranty will cover everything and more that an extended warranty will cover. Reevaluate at 40K miles. It would be required to go through a certification inspection, but it would still be eligible for coverage. If the vehicle was stolen or totaled you wouldn't get your money back. At this point in time you would be paying for nothing, other than padding your dealers pocket."
Audi,3dzst5,AudiandVW,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you can get the tire and wheel coverage separate from the extended warranty.  Depending on where you drive the Wheel/Tire package can quickly pay for itself.  I've had 4 tires replaced and 3 rims repaired in just over a year due to pot holes.  Out of pocket cost $150 for an alignment, but would have been several thousand dollars out of pocket without the coverage."

Audi,3dzst5,abrown82345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"Like the previous commenter said, should I wait to get it until the factory warranty expires, or should I get it now when it is cheaper?

Audi,3dvj3b,emptyvoices,4,Sun Jul 19 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"I had the same POS SUV for 12 years. It died and I didn't feel like spending $1,500 for repairs on it. Found a used low miles CPO with Audi Care an hour from me. Done and done. Best decision I've made in a while. It's a great combination of looks and power plus I can easily fit the family with 2 little kids for a weekend trip. Wife took it out on Saturday to run her errands and loved the drive (even though she couldn't figure out how to work the AC ha)"
Audi,3dvj3b,dangerousminority,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"There is a button, it says Auto. I understand how confusing that must have been.  Joking!

Audi,3dvj3b,BradGroux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Congrats, I've had my 2013 S6 for about three months... warning, the speed and acceleration are addicting."
Audi,3dvj3b,BradGroux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:57:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you good sir!  I'm guessing the drive and feel are quite similar. Do you drive around in comfort? I haven't tried dynamic yet.. Yes, I do enjoy getting on the gas quite often.  After I decided on an Audi (vs BMW or MB), I was going through the range of A6, S6, A7, S7. All things equal, A6 is cheapest obviously, A7 with the right look I felt gave the best 'bang for your buck' + could get in a 5 seat configuration (in case my wife wanted to squeeze between 2 car seats on a road trip). At the end, I got lucky and found a used one that fit."
Audi,3dvj3b,BradGroux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"I try to stick with comfort when I have passengers, because Dynamic is melt your face off acceleration... you can actually feel the car making the transition, it is addicting. Tesla has their Insane and Ludicrous mode, I call Dynamic ""Oh Shit"" mode.  I personally drive in Dynamic whenever possible, because I am a silly man. The paddle shifters are great fun too. Nothing like downshifting to overtake a slowpoke.   I did the same when shopping, I would have been happy with either the S6 and S7 as they are basically the same drive train. I shopped for a few months and pounced on the first great deal I saw, which took a while because they are quite rare - especially in lower miles and still under warranty. I actually had mine shipped across country."
Audi,3dvj3b,kr0wb4r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"You make me want to go out right now to test dynamic. I think my infant will enjoy his car ride home today. Ha.  I got lucky. I saw this car pop up on a Friday, my car died on Saturday, I was on the phone with them on Monday ready to make a deposit as they are about an hour away. CPO, < 20K miles with Audi Care, new A/S tires. I keep it under 3 years and I won't have to pay for scheduled maintenance. Plus it was cheaper as its a bare bones S7 with just the summer 20's package."
Audi,3dvj3b,etm124,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"Make sure you give it a whirl with launch control too. Turn on Dynamic, put it in park and turn off traction control. Then back to drive and punch it. 0-60 in 3.7 seconds is good fun!  The most impressive thing about Dynamic is the instant response. Since the twin turbos sit inside of the V of the cylinders, the air has less distance to travel - so it is instantaneous results. The response time actually saved me from being side-swiped on just the second day of owning it. A woman was texting while driving and drifted into my lane going about 70, I gunned it and was up to 90 and out of harms way in a jiffy.  I used to have a 500HP supercharged Mustang with a .410 rear-end, and this thing would blow it away in torque and launch... the AWD helps with that of course."

Audi,3dujbw,aid689,12,Sun Jul 19 18:35:34 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah, I'm not too worried about them.  If I'm honest, the DCT was my biggest worry before I test drove it, since all of my cars before this one were manuals.   However, once I felt how quickly and smoothly it ran, I was sold.   And that little throttle blip it does to rev-match the downshifts is amazing.   Anyone against the engine/tranny pair in this car has never driven one."
Audi,3dujbw,aid689,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:32 2015 UTC,I'm happy you're satisfied with it! At my local church there's a single guy in his 50's who owns a V10 R8 and he will sometimes do a launch because the littler kids gather around his car. Those exhaust blips are AMAZING. 10/10.
Audi,3dujbw,nelisan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"Do you find yourself using the paddle shifters mostly or just letting the automatic do its thing? Curious because even though I have paddle shifters, I rarely seem to use them since the auto just takes over when necessary anyways. But it may be a different with DCT."
Audi,3dujbw,swordlord357,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Around town, I just let it do its thing in comfort mode, unless I want to pass someone, then I kick it down a gear or two manually, since it really like to get to 7th gear as quickly as possible.  In the mountains in dynamic mode, it's mostly the same.   It likes to stay in a lot lower gear to keep the revs high, and I usually agree with its decisions.   However, if I'll kick it up or down a gear if I need a little more power, or know I can't pass the person in front of me for a little bit.  I'm still enjoying the novelty of having the paddle shifters too though, so part of using them is just because it's fun."

Sadly I find it even more commonly at /r/bmw more than here. IMO, a good manual is nice, yes, but a good automatic can be just as nice.

Audi,3dujbw,Porsche_Curves,2,Sun Jul 19 20:54:32 2015 UTC,I've done both now for some time. I bought a B8.5 S4 with a 6 speed manual and drove it for a couple years (around 40K miles) until I changed jobs closer to Boston which comes with more traffic.  I ended up selling it and got another S4 with a DCT and I've put about 9K miles on it so far.  I've driven manual for most of my life but the DCT is so much nicer than any other auto I've ever driven that I don't feel like ive made a bad choice.    I do feel like it's changed how I drive because with a manual I spent more time calculating shifts and gaps based on traffic.  Now I don't think about it anymore.  I'd like to get another manual in the future but the DCT is fantastic.  The upshift fart noise gets addicting.  :-)
Audi,3dz0uh,Hatfeeld,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"Your Certified pre owned extended warranty should cover the diagnosis, parts and labor for the repair, minus your deductible. The engine in your vehicle would be useful information. I think the two most common causes would be an ignition coil or fuel delivery issue. An ignition coil failure would usually cause a very noticeable rough idle, not just a problem during acceleration. Even if your Check Engine Light is not on there are most likely fault codes stored. Specific codes would be more helpful if you have a way to access them."
Audi,3dz0uh,AudiandVW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"Might be a vacuum leak. Which would be covered under your CPO. Or it might be your coil packs which would be under maintenance so not covered under your CPO.   Source: had the same problem, first it was the vacuum leak, then it was the coil packs."
Audi,3dz0uh,edrawwrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:25 2015 UTC,Is it shuddering in 2nd gear? I think there may be a sw update for the transmission that fixes this.
Audi,3dz0uh,brp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:55 2015 UTC,not so much in second. only 4th or 5th when i try to accelerate kind of fast
Audi,3dxhyz,CitizenFord,4,Mon Jul 20 10:13:14 2015 UTC,"Block heaters really aren't necessary. if you're really worried, go with an Oil pan heater (but make sure to put it on a timer!) but really, you should be fine. I live in Alberta and our winters are fairly similar and I don't use either a block heater nor a oil pan heater. Never had any issues  Buy a decent set of winter tires. Yeah all seasons will do you, but nothing beats a decent set of winter tires on ice and snow  Also build a kit to keep in your trunk with a blanket, hand warmers, cloves, small shovel and med kit. As a just in case"
Audi,3dxhyz,TheRealKozi,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"The only fluid you really need to be concerned about is your coolant. The percentage of coolant determines the level of freeze protection. A 50/50 mix of coolant/antifreeze and distilled water would give you freeze protection of -35F. Some technicians keep a jug of premixed coolant for top offs during regular services and repairs, some just use water. It is possible that over the years your percentage has dropped below 50% coolant. I would recommend a complete cooling system flush and refill with at least a 50/50 mix. A 60/40 mix would lower the freeze protection to -62F, not really justified in my experience. Info is from Audi P# G013A8J1G. As far as a block heater, I'm not sure what owners in that area are using, if anything. I would have a hard time recommending anything that would have to be integrated into your vehicles wiring harness. I have seen heating mats that have been mounted to the lower oil pan, however, I cannot comment on their effectiveness. A new battery wouldn't be a bad idea. Extreme conditions of either hot or cold are going to strain a weak battery that functioning ok in milder climates. The last thing would be the condition of your tires. Either a really good set of all season tires or preferably a set of snow tires mounted on a spare set of rims. And remember, Quattro is great for the go in the snow, but doesn't do $hit when you have to stop."
Audi,3dxhyz,AudiandVW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"It's North Dakota... Snow tires are a mandatory item, long before you would worry about a block heater, not something to be debated.  The majority of the state is rural, and some roads just won't be plowed in a timely manner. All season tires turn to solid rock bricks long before your coolant will solidify."
Audi,3dxhyz,antariusz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:18 2015 UTC,Make sure your battery is up to par and definitely look into getting a set of winter tires. You can usually find a pretty decent cheap set of slightly used winter tires already mounted on a spare set of wheels for a good price.

Do yourself a favor and look at what some basic maintenance will cost. An oil change, brake pads and rotors, a set of tires... That's just the stuff every vehicle will need. Where are you going to take it when it needs a repair? What is the labor rate at your closest authorized dealer? 04 was also the first year for that model. Do your homework and really know what you are getting into. I know how to work on those vehicles and would not own that car. Just sayin."

Gold....Looked just like this one :D    Anyways, one of my favorite moments was when I was at Electric Forest Music Festival. It was a shitty year for weather....Huge thunderstorms and heavy rain (made for awesome pictures though I must say). Well, at said festival, which had essentially become a mud festival, trucks like Ford F-150's were getting stuck in the mud when it was time to pack up and go home. Needless to say, I decided to give it a go in my little A4. To everyones surprise, my little A4 chugged through, leaving all the big trucks behind lol. I still remember the look on their faces when I passed them. It was that moment that I said to myself, ""I think i'm going to stick with these cars""."
