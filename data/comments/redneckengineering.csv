redneckengineering,3cpb2z,Gigathulu,3,Thu Jul 9 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"This is the connection to my subwoofer. There are two resistors connecting the positive channels to the common output to reduce current flow between the left and right channels if they are out of phase. The coil is a small isolation transformer that I am using one side of as a low-pass filter, because the bass was sounding rather muddy without it. This whole setup is then connected to the positive side of the subwoofer.  The negative channels are wired together and connected to the negative side of the subwoofer.  The subwoofer connection is the split-open coax cable. The two sets of speaker wire below that go to the tweeters.  The whole thing is there because I have a single voice coil passive subwoofer and a stereo amplifier with two outputs. I wish it would let you use one set of outputs in bridge mode and one set in stereo, because then I could get more power out of the subwoofer.  Schematic"

The piece of rope on the handle would have to be rigged so that if it loses tension it releases and just like letting go with your hands it would turn off.

Maybe our pump wasn't strong enough or the pipes too long.  We fixed it by passing the water through a second barrel filled with boiling water on top of the fire. It worked pretty well but took forever, like 6-7 hours before the tub was actually warm."

The full sink is the upper reservoir (it's in a flat approximately 4 m from the ground) and the water flowed down the hose to the ground. The water flowing from the tap ensured that the reservoir was not depleted. I got the siphon started by holding the hose against the tap outlet and holding it on tightly, once the water was flowing I quickly placed the end of the hose in the full sink and placed a glass over the end of it to hold it under the water."

I always have peroxide around because I keep it for my tooth brushes.  On a side note: I used to work at a job where we cleaned things with 100% Ethanol and one day decided to pour some on a razor blade cut.  It stings way more than 3% hydrogen peroxide.

redneckengineering,31hdry,segaudette,10,Sun Apr 5 13:47:54 2015 UTC,I am going to disagree with the other explanation.  Considering how blacked out the other windows is I think this is someone living in their car. The blue foam insulation helps keep the car warm without it running but obstructs the view so he cut the holes to be legal without having to pull all the blue foam out each time. I'd guess he has the pieces he cut out and plugs the hole when he is parked.
redneckengineering,31hdry,p90xeto,2,Sun Apr 5 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"Looks like the window won't go up so he made a piece of foam with cutouts for the sideview and to look out, then glued plexiglass to the foam"

redneckengineering,31dx8v,unclevernamehere,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I am totally going to build one of those, I figure a 11' canoe can carry about 800 lbs safely. So with four of them will get you to 3200lbs, I would be very surprised it this weighed more than that. So basically have the thing pictured with two canoes directly on the sides of it, its pretty much a dock with a second deck so not too hard to build. Lash on two canoes, then connect those canoes to the two other canoes with 2x4s at the front and the back. If you give your self about 6 feet on each side the whole thing will be about 20-25 feet wide so it won't be terribly maneuverable. Then put a 25 hp motor on the back and put along nicely.   I figure I could find some used canoes for around $150 a piece for shitty ones. So that's 600$ add in the 500$ for the shitty camper and about that much again for the wood. Then add in 150$ for a used outboard motor and the total price would be around 2000$. Kind of expensive but it might be worth it.   e: also the dock would probably have some kind of flotation foam as well."

redneckengineering,2yba1z,tangozeroseven,5,Sun Mar 8 08:33:27 2015 UTC,"Gasification:       Gasification is a process that converts organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (>700 °C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas or synthetic gas) or producer gas and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas is considered to be a source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.

The term usually refers to using either a digital single-lens reflex camera with lens attached or, more often, a fixed lens point and shoot digital camera to obtain photos through the eyepiece of a birdwatcher's spotting scope  using a technique called afocal photography. It has also been associated with using a digital camera and spotting scope equipped for prime focus photography.  The word ""digiscoping"" was coined in 1999 by French birdwatcher Alain Fossé. Less notable neologisms for this activity are digiscope birding, digiscopy birding, digi-birding, digibinning (using digital camera with binoculars), and phonescoping  (using a digital camera phone with a spotting scope or binoculars).

redneckengineering,2m8ozf,Treereme,2,Sun Nov 16 01:04:14 2014 UTC,"To be honest, do not know. I would assume that since radiators are designed to heat large spaces, they are optimized to do so, and that since ovens are not designed for such a purpose that they are less efficient. But I never really questioned it when it happened, I was too busy questioning what made them think it was a good idea in the first place haha  Edit - when I say ""efficient"" I do not mean that one yields more heat than the other.

redneckengineering,2m8ozf,supergnawer,1 point,Mon Nov 17 07:17:16 2014 UTC,"Gas heater is more efficient. It usually heats water, which then transfers the heat to the radiators. So the energy goes in the right places. A stove heats air, which mostly goes straight out in the ventilation. You need to store heat in something more permanent to heat air continuously, not just when the burner works. That's why wood burners are brick, not metal.

Or if you're leally lazy, you just leave burners on and that's that (then sometimes you die, but if your apartment is so cold you use these techniques, you probably welcome that). The fan is unnecessary and you'll have to pay for electricity."

redneckengineering,29ev0h,FrankieSucks,5,Mon Jun 30 13:16:30 2014 UTC,"if he built it the same way i built mine, it definitely works, only i used a natural gas bbq and overbore the orfaces from 12000btu per burner to 20000btu, x 4 burners to create a heat output of 80000btu. Cut a 3/4in  x 12 in slit in the top of the lid to get a decent draft going then i riveted on a hinged door for when im grilling.  Essentially you make a copper heat exchanger out of 3/4 copper pipe, type L works best, that weaves back and forth on multiple layers. im not sure if plumbing solder would have worked due to the lower melting point vs the heat output of my bbq, so i brazed all my joints using silphos filler material that i had laying around, which melts at 1200 degrees.  On the inlet of the bbq heater i used a pump that would draw water from the pool and on the outlet the water dumps right in front of the jet for my pool pump for circulation. on a cool night i can raise the temperature of the pool from 65 to 80+ by morning, and it costs me only a few bucks to run. Make sure you feed the cold water in at the top of the bbq for the best heat transfer.  Take the heat exchanger out of the bbq, resume grill."

This throws the balance and alignment off.  If you can figure out which prop arm is off balanced or bent positioning this very minor weight and drag (air friction) in the right spot can correct the imbalance.  Honestly seems like it would be pretty hard to do accurately though. I'm curious as to how they figured out where exactly to put it without hours of trial and error."

Positioned the phone inside, and went from not being able to hear it at all, to being able to hear it clearly even at a low volume setting. There are even a number of companies selling overpriced ""battery-less amplifiers"" for phones.  The enclosure doesn't have to be anywhere close to acoustically perfect; most of the gain comes simply from the fact that the media speaker is facing away from you, and the enclosure will reflect the sound in the correct direction. Even cupping your hand behind the speaker as you hold it will work in a pinch.  However, as /u/PeppersMagik pointed out, cans, drinking cups, and other thin objects will vibrate, which would cause significant distortion and it'll sound awful."
