The number of octathorpes determines the titles ""level"".  Think of it like an outline format.  If the sub's CSS doesn't define how to display the title, I think most sub's display it as bold by default.  I'm guessing he typed in ""#1 Anything"" and it made it into a title (hence why it just shows 1, because the # is hidden by the markup language).  Title 1  Title 2  Title 3  Title 4  Title 5  (I think 5 is the limit)."

holdmybeer,3da81y,Berg426,247,Wed Jul 15 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"This fire extinguisher doesn't do that.  There's 3 parts to a fire: fuel, oxygen, and heat.  You only need to stop the triangle between one pair of those three to stop a fire.  A CO2 extinguisher is what you're thinking about, which will displace oxygen and cool the area.  This is a dry chemical fire extinguisher.  The idea is to cover the fuel with the chemical to separate it from the oxygen, rather than displacing the oxygen.  It has a consistency of baking soda (or can literally contain baking soda) but is absolutely disgusting to get in your mouth or breath in.  Source: have my OSHA cards and on a safety committee.  Regularly do fire safety training."

holdmybeer,3da81y,OhBlackWater,4,Tue Jul 14 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"Which standards?  If I remember correctly, lifting injuries are the second most common injuries behind the slips, trips and falls category.    Plus so many lifting injuries are solely because people unnecessarily strain  themselves from improper lifting of overexertion and can easily be avoided with proper training and following the guidelines."

holdmybeer,3da81y,OhBlackWater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"That's just a statistics number.  NIOSH said that most lifting injuries caused by lifting too much weight start to happen at 50 pounds so OSHA suggests that limit.  They have been talking about lowering it to a depressing 35 pounds.  Again, it's just a suggestion number for risk analysis.  We have guys regularly lifting 65 pounds over their head.  We're not going to put a 5'4"" 130 pound guy in that position.  From my view point we would have someone that can actually handle the job do it and make sure they are lifting properly.  If no one can do it, buy the tools to help them because workers' comp premiums can get fucking expensive."

The pressure and severely alkaline powder caused horrific injuries and we had to remove part of his colon. It took almost three years before we could re-attach the distal end of his colon to his anus. The short of this is that setting a fire extinguisher into your mouth can cause rupture of lungs, stomach, oesophagus, ear drums....and a seriously unpleasant sheer barotrauma that literally causes skin, muscle and bone in the whole head to separate from each other. I can almost guarantee that this idiot will have chemical injuries throughout his neck, lungs and stomach.....the only first aid is to give him acidic lemon juice or orange, then do a lung lavage...then transfer to ICU.

holdmybeer,3da81y,badgrafxghost,25,Tue Jul 14 21:49:26 2015 UTC,"lung lavage  Start with the most diseased lung. The anesthesia team separates the lungs using a device called a double lumen breathing tube. Basically, they ask the healthier lung to breathe for the whole body while they clean the sicker one.  Use gravity.  Using special tubing, the team flushes saline solution through the lung with the help of gravity. They circulate around 10–20 liters of fluid through each lung on average — but severe cases may require up to 50 liters. The liquid starts out very dark but becomes clearer as the process continues.  Add shaking and suction. Doctors wrap a vest around the patient’s chest. This vest shakes the body to help agitate the abnormal protein, mix it up with the washing liquid and help remove it. Afterward, the team uses suction devices to remove liquid that gravity and shaking left behind.  Test and switch. After a break, the team attempts to repeat the process for the other lung. But first, they must test and make sure the newly cleaned lung is functioning well enough to breathe for the body.   So yeah. They basically drown you one lung at a time to pressure wash your insides."

So, based on what I was taught when passing you want to pull up behind the vehicle in front and turn on your blinker so the driver in front knows  you are about to pass. I do this, but instead of allowing me to pass he slams on his brakes and attempts to out accelerate me. My car was faster and I got in front of him, he followed me with his brights on all the way to a stop light, at which point he pulls into the shoulder rolls down his window and unleashes a wave of obscenities in my direction.  ""Dont you ever fucking tailgate me again you son of a bitch!""  ""Dude, the speed limit was 55"" ""I'll kick the shit out of you, you little fucking shit, dont you fucking tailgate me again!""

holdmybeer,3d9o1f,fastlerner,4,Tue Jul 14 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"The trick is to go down straight like a toothpick and begin bending at the hip as soon as your feet touch the water.  If you do it right, you'll make an abrupt 90 degree turn underwater and have plenty of room to decelerate.  We used to climb a leaning tree to jump from the top into a rock bottomed river that was  only about 4 foot deep.  Definitely not the smartest thing to do, but it is doable."

The water was definitely more than 4' deep, but you'd hit the bottom if you didn't do this.  Sitting down when you hit is the second best trick for jumping from high places, second only to wearing an old pair of tennis shoes."

The bubble is hot as hell but fun as it looks. You learn to plant your feet and lean into the hit but if you get blindsided you're going flying. The younger guys can get back up by rolling onto their feet but I'm an old guy and it takes a little more effort so I made sure I wasn't getting blindsided again.fun time for sure."

holdmybeer,3d3kvo,shepdozejr,3,Mon Jul 13 18:06:52 2015 UTC,I don't know why they even bother with the pretense of the soccer ball.  They seem to be more interested in slamming into each other than paying any attention to the ball between them.
holdmybeer,3d3kvo,amaturelawyer,3,Mon Jul 13 18:08:19 2015 UTC,I'd watch sports if it looked like this.
holdmybeer,3d3kvo,Eats_Flies,16,Mon Jul 13 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"Probably not, it's not that rapid. But this does look like a great way to tear an ACL"
holdmybeer,3d3kvo,gaedikus,4,Mon Jul 13 10:26:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say yes, because all you need for a concussion is to have your brain traveling forward at some non-trivial speed and then suddenly have your skull stop moving(or, in this case, reverse course) while the inertia of your brain continues to carry it in the direction it was going in the first place.   So, it's probably pretty safe in general, but there is a non-zero probability of getting a concussion doing that. They're running at each other at football player speeds and slamming into each other, and that is absolutely proven to cause concussions. It's not the impact that gets them, it's the speed and sudden stop."
holdmybeer,3d3kvo,Nutritionisawesome,5,Mon Jul 13 10:40:17 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: This is also why gloved boxing is so dangerous.

holdmybeer,3cx1w8,MilitantNarwhal,2,Sun Jul 12 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"I poured 9 cubic feet of concrete in last week  with 1 worker of mine in two different locations.  I was forming sidewalks and pads at 7 in the morning and didn't stop sweating till the last broom stroke on the concrete at 3 in the afternoon and thought, I'm getting old, I'm tired!  Then I drove home and counted 16 town workers pouring about 50' of sidewalk.   I bought my first house when I was 19.  I built my dream home (footings to shingles) when I was 28.  I rebuilt every engine in my fleet.  I designed and manufactured voice recorders that attach to tape measures (in stores soon) and have worked every day I could since I was 14. I know what hard work is and there are only a few guys I have had the privilege to work with that can keep up with me.   I also know that when there is a union involved, it is an excuse for lazy people not to get fired.  There is nothing you can say to convince me that town workers are motivated in any shape or form.  Maybe they are different where you are from but an orange vest is an excuse to do as little as possible"
holdmybeer,3cx1w8,tornato7,2,Sun Jul 12 01:38:33 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Work for unionized road commission. Almost everyone is lazy as hell.
holdmybeer,3cx1w8,TheRealFilthyRich,2,Sun Jul 12 05:05:11 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way: if they were as motivated as you, they wouldn't be city road workers. That's why you don't get the best employees for manual labor."
holdmybeer,3cx1w8,TheRealFilthyRich,5,Sun Jul 12 01:44:19 2015 UTC,"You just drove my point home.  Unmotivated people get to work for the city where you get in trouble for working hard because you make everyone else look bad.  I don't have employees because I end up babysitting.  I have multiple contractors I sub out to that work hard.  We make a fair living and share by also going to third world countries and working and teaching just as hard there.  I have zero sympathy for anyone slacking behind a union.  If you don't like your conditions, quit and be the master of your own destiny, but why would you do that? It would mean sweating and not having the time to hit yourself in the head with your hardhat, or videotaping other idiots trying it."
holdmybeer,3cx1w8,Xer0day,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:58:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the crews. My crew was the one that the bigwigs would send the people they were trying weeding out. After we voluteered to fix the 6th water leak in a day, the lazy guys would usually be ready to quit.  There were other crews that were absolutely useless, but we worked them into the ground eventually as well. By the time I left, the water department in my city was the most efficient it had been in decades. But holy hell it was difficult.  Props for all your hard work and success though. I think we would get along well out on the jobsite."

The spectator was standing at the edge of a motocross jump at the Wildwood Lake Raceway near Little Hocking, Ohio.  As an earlier motocross rider cancels his jump attempt when seeing the spectator, he yells: ""Dude, I thought you were trying to tell me to stop.""  The spectator yells after the motocross rider: ""Oh, no!""  As another motorcyclist attempts the jump, the spectator holds out his hand again.  This time, the motorcyclist does not slow down and instead of looking in the direction of the oncoming bike, the spectator is seen smiling at the camera.  ""My cousin races pro motocross, he told me to stand on the edge of the jump,"" said the selfie-taker.  ""He said give him a high five and take a selfie in mid air.""  However, his smile would not have last long, as the motorcycle and its driver land on the man's right side and the pair are thrown down to the ground.  He was left with head trauma, bruising and swelling of the head, and ""my arm was pretty ripped up""."

holdmybeer,3cnzcs,RoscoeMG,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:18:26 2015 UTC,"It was a hell of a toss, considering it didn't seem practiced. He had to not only calculate the distance between the boats, but also the speed they were traveling and how much added distance that equaled and he put it on his chest. Nice underhand, that."
holdmybeer,3cnzcs,eXX0n,2,Thu Jul 9 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"Actually calculating the speed of the boats would cause him to greatly overthrow. Since they were both in the same relative system, i.e. the beer, the thrower and the catcher were all moving at the same speed, the only reasons he would have to add more distance to the throw would be if they were changing direction, or if the air would slow the can down enough to be significant.  The second case might have been slightly true, but it would still only require a slight amount of added distance."

holdmybeer,3cjl7w,Theonetrue,5,Wed Jul 8 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"ugh my friend did this at his pool once. Tried to jump over, only made one leg and did a split.

holdmybeer,3cjl7w,Obvious0ne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:23:27 2015 UTC,Um. The lesson was not that you should not do it if it is slippery?  I mean with both legs you don't hurt your nuts but you probably hit the back of your head. If you are unlucky right on the edge of the [pool]

Approach the jump at an angle with your strong foot on the inside of the jump. Not a full 90degree angle, but something closer to 40-30 degrees. You want your strong foot to be the last foot that you plant before you jump, as you turn parallel to your jump. This allows you to create a rebounding effect with your strong foot, which will give you more loft and distance.  Also, on the landing, don't split your legs if it's a great distance. Tuck your knees. It'll allow you to get further before you hit the ground. First dude is what not to do, second dude is what to do.  source: basketball. only way I can dunk."

holdmybeer,3cg5oz,Electrorocket,136,Wed Jul 8 01:40:44 2015 UTC,I said this on Facebook a few weeks ago and I'll say it again here: don't do a double-foot take off! Plantin' both feet stops you pretty much completely. Gotta measure them steps out so your dominant foot is the take off foot and hit that shit in striiiiiide.

holdmybeer,3cg5oz,SpinkickFolly,7,Tue Jul 7 20:40:17 2015 UTC,And actually having his toes over the edge would have given him much more leverage.

holdmybeer,3cg5oz,puterTDI,56,Tue Jul 7 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's less because you are ""jumping"" off of that foot, but rather it is your plant foot.

For triple jump, yes you lead with your non dominant, follow with the same, but then always finish with the dominant for the ""power"" kick. It's fairly easy to google Olympic long jumpers to see the majority use their dominant foot. This is done not only for power but for smoothness of stride.

Either foot led, just was how I felt."
holdmybeer,3cg5oz,TakeItToTheMax,0,Wed Jul 8 01:00:50 2015 UTC,That's unusual though. Usually you should be using one foot or the other every time.
holdmybeer,3cg5oz,Savage9645,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely was unusual. I wasn't the best jumper, I only cleared 5'6"" at my best haha."
holdmybeer,3cg5oz,TakeItToTheMax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:45 2015 UTC,I think he was deliberately trying to clear the gap from a two footed take off.  He got damn close. And held on to the bitter end.   WITNESSED!
holdmybeer,3cg5oz,Meatchris,-1,Wed Jul 8 02:34:53 2015 UTC,I think a great number of parkour athletes would disagree. A double foot take off is more stable and provides more power. If you do it right you don't lose much speed.
holdmybeer,3cg5oz,corvustock,22,Wed Jul 8 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"I think everyone will agree this man's form was terrible. He sidles up to the edge of the platform, nearly cancelling all the momentum he built up by running. He next reaches vertically upward like he's trying to do a vertical jump instead of what's mostly a horizontal one. And THEN halfway through the jump stretches out so his body mass is all over the place, totally fucking up any momentum carrying him forward. And, surprise, surprise! Drops like a fucking stone."

holdmybeer,3cg5oz,Milkgunner,0,Tue Jul 7 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"One of the abovementioned parkour athletes here. I agree, a two foot takeoff is more stable and can provide a much more precise landing, this is however only if done correctly.  It is possible that this guy was scared of slipping when he landed, so he opted for the two foot takeoff, but he had far too little speed in the runup and his takeoff was so poorly timed and poorly placed that he actually slipped as he was jumping, removing his speed even further.  If I was the one doing this jump, I would probably have done the one-foot take off, from my non-dominant foot (As I get almost all of my momentum from my dominant foot kicking, personal preference), and land it either on the edge, making it impossible to slip, or land it with a step or two if I managed to jump far enough to go over the edge."
holdmybeer,3cg5oz,GrapeMousse,0,Wed Jul 8 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"I would do a hybrid jump I think. I would keep running but the jump would start off my poor foot, which is the step before my good foot comes in, and then I could keep my velocity up, and use the power from both legs to propel me."

Also, the government tells people to evacuate and they refuse sometimes e.g. Hurricane Katrina. Anywho, if the gov't says to evacuate, perhaps its a good idea. California has earthquakes, fires, mudslides, and homeless people. It's like our dangerous attempt at Australia."
holdmybeer,3ciilq,THCarlisle,-2,Thu Jul 9 05:12:09 2015 UTC,"You obviously were not looking at the license plates if you think that's in the US. Also California is not nearly as crazy and dangerous as you make it sound. You watch too much sensationalized news. In the last 20+ years only 20 people have died in California wildfires, and that includes firefighters, who are really the main people at danger. Only 2 people have died from California earthquakes in that time. And there has only been one landslide that caused deaths (that I can find), killed 10 people in 2005. That's a total of 32 people from all the shit you just listed, in 20 years.  Compare that to tornadoes in other parts of the country and suddenly California is looking like the safest state, not the most dangerous. In that same 20 year time period about 1,700 people have been killed by tornadoes in the US (none of those in California obviously), and thousands more by hurricanes, floods, and lightning. California doesn't get tornadoes or hurricanes, and rarely gets flooding or lightning."

Even after just dropping a compound bow on the ground it's recommended to take it to a shop to get looked at. Factor in all the moving parts (pulleys, cams) and the fact that this guy threw it, I don't think anyone who has experience with archery would go anywhere near that bow without a very thorough lookover."

holdmybeer,3cdhka,QuickStopRandal,4,Tue Jul 7 16:22:59 2015 UTC,One with lots of alcohol.
holdmybeer,3cdhka,theoriginalviking,0,Tue Jul 7 17:36:23 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who saw at first sight that this ramp was to flat? Which obviously is just one of the problems...
holdmybeer,3cdhka,Janus96Approx,2,Tue Jul 7 12:54:35 2015 UTC,I don't see enough landing space on the other side so the pool probably saved his life.

I say yoga mat because it is the best way to describe it, but really it's just a mat to throw down on to the concrete to sleep on behind your door. The water and baloney sandwich actually came towards the end of my lovely stay (which in my case was breakfast) and I also had a water fountain with brown ass water coming out.
