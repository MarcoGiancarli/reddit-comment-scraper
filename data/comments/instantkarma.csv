instantkarma,3cd068,juscallmesteve,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:21:47 2015 UTC,In terms of karma...  Illegal U-Turn  !=  wheel coming off  ...but maybe there's more to the story.
instantkarma,3cd068,IceUck,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but it's also likely that u-turn isn't actually illegal. I don't see any no u-turn signs, and they'd likely be posted within the camera's field of view.   So unless there's a local ordinance banning all u-turns (which isn't unheard-of, but not particularly common), there's nothing illegal about that u-turn"
instantkarma,3cd068,Randolpho,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:03:44 2015 UTC,There is not a posted sign that says no U-Turns but the markings on the road make it illegal. I do not have it memorized to explain in detail but I am certain it is against the law to make a U-Turn right there.
instantkarma,3cd068,juscallmesteve,2,Tue Jul 7 06:28:26 2015 UTC,"About 90% of the time anyone uses the phrase ""illegal U-turn,"" they're wrong and it's actually not illegal. In most places there are only a handful of instances where U-turns are illegal:   When there's a sign explicitly forbidding U-turns When you can't easily see oncoming traffic When you are on a divided highway that has a curb or unpaved median between you and the other side When you're at a railroad crossing or in front of a fire station."
instantkarma,3cd068,wilfoy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:18:14 2015 UTC,Can you explain the last two for me please?
instantkarma,3cd068,SraBelle,2,Tue Jul 7 18:11:49 2015 UTC,If I'm thinking correctly I think he means the divided highway being on an interstate that has a little paved area for official use only. Not sure about the last one though.

instantkarma,3au599,Rapist_Winston,-8,Tue Jul 21 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"Neither the cyclist nor the motorist look good from this video. Cyclist probably should've given a check over his shoulder, car driver shouldn't have been passing with so little room. Pedestrian islands cause little pinch points without enough room for bike and car. I wouldn't have been in the cycle lane at that point but instead have taken the lane early on (after a shoulder check) if it was me."
instantkarma,3au599,heavymetalengineer,7,Tue Jun 23 16:03:53 2015 UTC,Definitely the cyclists fault. He went right around that other biker without even looking or caring. Your bike can't match up to the car that weighs hundreds more.
instantkarma,3au599,JarekBloodDragon,-11,Mon Jun 29 06:20:01 2015 UTC,"The cyclist wasn't completely faultless but the car driver should have been further out. Also, that wasn't a ""wow, I'm right here buddy"" horn, that was an unnecessary ""you fucking cyclist idiot"" horn. Horns are loud and if you're not expecting them can really scare the shit out of you and make things like this happen."
instantkarma,3au599,heavymetalengineer,8,Mon Jun 29 08:48:14 2015 UTC,"When a cyclist cuts right in front of your car in the lane because he's too impatient to wait for the bike lane to get wider to allow him to pass another cyclist, makes that horn a pretty necessary ""you fucking cyclist idiot"" horn."
instantkarma,3au599,JarekBloodDragon,5,Mon Jun 29 11:30:41 2015 UTC,No point in arguing this seems like a cyclist that can do whatever he wants because he is a cyclist.
instantkarma,3au599,Wsweg,-2,Tue Jun 30 02:40:34 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand me. I am not absolving the cyclist of any guilt. I am saying the car shouldn't have used his angry ""fuck you"" horn nor should they have been so close.   Remove the cyclist who's POV we are viewing this from and there still isn't enough room for a car and cyclist at that point as if the cyclist needs to avoid something in the road he will not have anywhere to go with a car that close."
instantkarma,3au599,heavymetalengineer,-6,Fri Jul 10 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"There wasn't room for both car and single cyclist at that point though. The car should have waited for the road to become wider. I blame poor road design for this too. The ""cycle lane"" lulls the driver into thinking they are safe in passing the cyclist when they are far too close."
instantkarma,3au599,heavymetalengineer,2,Mon Jun 29 12:11:47 2015 UTC,"The road was wide enough for a car to pass,  if the biker had stayed in his lane it would have been fine, but he didn't."
instantkarma,3au599,poorguthan,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"Its hard to tell but let's say it is wide enough for one car to safely pass one cyclist riding in the gutter. Watch the video again. The cyclist is level with the other cyclist when the driver blares his horn. This leads me to believe that the driver had a lot of time to react and was just using his ""fuck you"" horn.   As I have said I do think the cyclist behaved improperly here. If it were me I would have been no where near that other cyclist as I would have given a shoulder check, signaled with my arm and proceeded to take the lane long before even passing him. I just think the car driver shouldn't have been so close and any driver worth his or her salt should have been able to anticipate this happening. And the loud angry horn was completely unnecessary."
instantkarma,3au599,heavymetalengineer,0,Fri Jul 10 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"I've just realised that this is on my commute to work. That section of the road, for about a quarter of a mile, is much narrower than the parts before. If I'm driving I tend to piss off all the drivers behind me because there's generally no way I'll overtake a bike there. Assuming the driver that beeped was pissed off because he/she was about to overtake the cyclist then I question their driving skills: they were about to overtake two cyclists who were both going at some speed at this point.  That link shows the pedestrian island/pinch point where the motorist started beeping. Pretty inattentive driver if he/she assumed they could overtake just after particularly when the road is busy. Shortly after it curves to the right and goes downhill: you can't see very far ahead there at all.  To sum up: Dick head driver trying to pull a dangerous overtake."
instantkarma,3au599,widgetas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:29:58 2015 UTC,Try convincing all the motorists who disagree with me. UK infrastructure can be downright dangerous.
instantkarma,3au599,heavymetalengineer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:48:11 2015 UTC,"Going through that section again this morning I had proper look: it's even narrower and 'blind' than I thought, due to the fact that a car has to come from the 'right' after going through the dual car/bus traffic lights. No wonder the cyclist told the sports car to fuck off!"

instantkarma,345whm,Zaxthran,10,Tue Apr 28 15:35:18 2015 UTC,"That is not instant karma. Not for the truck driver. Maybe for both left lane drivers though. The van isn't better than the canal IMO for purposefully going to the truck's speed this blocking the camaro.   Don't exert justice yourself on the road, if someone drives like a maniac they are like an epileptic kid during an episode. Let them do their thing and try to minimize the damages."
instantkarma,345whm,avidsoul,2,Wed Apr 29 11:52:37 2015 UTC,Agreed but if the semi was smart he/she should have seen what was going on and backed off enough to allow more room and forcing the pickups actions. Pickup and Camaro were both in the wrong and unfortunately the Semi played for their stupidity.

instantkarma,345whm,murfeee,2,Tue Apr 28 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/avidsoul. Not exactly instant karma. Not truly anyway. He doesn't get instant karma from his first attempt to cut off the pickup (other than being stuck behind the pickup for an inordinately long time), and his second attempt to cut off the pickup truck knocks the pickup and the semi off the road. The Camaro just caused a big accident that hopefully no one else was hurt in.  That said, what a shitty driver. Wow. In the first incident, he tries to change lanes almost DIRECTLY into the truck... there's no way he couldn't see the truck was still right next to him.  Then, the second time, he does an incredibly dangerous maneuver going into the shoulder ditch, and I don't know if he loses control because he's such a bad driver, or if he decided he wanted to cutoff the truck as revenge, but he has a mile of open space ahead to go properly come back into the lane. Instead he comes right back into the truck again.  All that said, I would guess from watching this that the pickup driver got pissed and intentionally decided to box the Camaro in by not passing the semi. After the first incident, I would probably have pulled in front of the semi first chance I got to avoid driving anywhere near such a reckless person."
