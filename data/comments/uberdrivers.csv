uberdrivers,3e5108,monsto,2,Wed Jul 22 00:31:22 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I'd not thought of that.  Probably because I suck at using Tasker.  What kinds of things are you thinking you could do?
uberdrivers,3e5108,UnCounted36244,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure.  I'd liek to be able to call pax automagically after touching ""arrived"". As it stands: touch arrive, touch home, touch the contact (on the home screen), touch speakerphone. It's an unchanging series, and it'd be nice to make it one string of events.  But i'm betting that doing an overlay of some sort on the uber app will be a pain in the ass.   Mainly, tho, i wish there was a 'voice nav only' option. I have the phone in a driving cradle and it's a break in concentration to try to touch the phone while it's bouncin around."

All I use it for is a widget on my home screen that auto-texts ""hi this is /me with Uber, I'm outside, honda civic."" or something along those lines. I tap it right after I tap arrive (because uber and my phone are on 2 different devices - SO much easier), so it also works as a five-minute-timer."

I was picking up a female passenger at around 2:30am on a Friday night/Saturday morning. It was a shadier part of town and immediately after arriving I have trouble finding the place. The GPS takes me to a neighborhood side street off a main thoroughfare. It's dark - no street lights (pretty normal for Florida residential streets) and I'm parked in the middle of the street right where the pin drop is trying to figure out which house is hers. I'm thinking there must be a party letting out if its a neighborhood at this hour but don't see any houses with lots of cars out front.   Suddenly out of nowhere my passenger door opens and a middle aged woman peers in. ""Are you Cindy, my Uber passenger?"" I asked. ""Yes!"" She replies and hops in the front seat. I slowly start driving and ask, ""where to?"" To which she replies, ""I just wanna go somewhere fun!"" It's well after last call and the bars are closed. ""I'm going to need an address... The bars are closed.""   She seems drunk and I assume she's just another belligerent partier looking for a ride home. ""I want to go somewhere with drinks!"" She demands. And I proceed to explain to her that unless she means a non alcoholic drink from a beverage she's out of luck. ""Where would you like me to take you?"" I ask.   ""Well where do you live?"" She  asks. I'm starting to get frustrated and we've only made it to the end of the street. I reply, ""I live here and unless you  have an address or can give me the name of where you're going I'm going to need to end the ride.""   Then she starts asking me weird personal questions... ""What are you doing out so late and why are you dressed so nice?""   ""I'm just driving for Uber - trying to make some extra money."" At this point I'm starting to wonder what the hell's going on.   ""What the hell is Uber?"" She asks.   The rest happened pretty quickly. I started to reply and as I start to turn towards her she pulls her left breast up out of her shirt. ""Do you wanna suck on this?"" She asks.   In complete shock and still not realizing quite what was going on I replied ""absolutely not!""   As we turned the corner she started panicking. ""Oh my God you have to turn around I left my purse on the porch.""  She also mumbled something about me being a cop and as I pulled back around to where I picked her up hurriedly exited the car before I could even come to a complete stop.   I quickly logged out and drove off to find a well lit parking lot to stop and reflect on what had just happened. It wasn't until then that I realized I had accidentally picked up a hooker and in the span of less than three minutes and a trip around the block saw her topless and rejected her advances. As I exited the parking lot to go home I noticed a darkly lit bar at the end of the street I was just on and saw a girl standing outside next to a guy texting on her phone. Just then I got a text, ""Where are you?""  When I got home it was almost 4 and my wife woke to find me wide eyed and out of it. ""What's wrong, is everything OK?"" She asked.   To which I replied, ""I inadvertently picked up a hooker tonight...""  TLDR: I accidentally picked up the wrong passenger that turned out to be a hooker. We were both confused, she exposed herself to me and then rushed out of the car when I denied her advances."

uberdrivers,3e11jo,DIYDuder,-15,Tue Jul 21 12:02:42 2015 UTC,"As a rider I completely disagree.  Do you want to be seen as a taxi driver?  Because that's how you get seen as a taxi driver.  Riders like the cheaper rates and not having to tip.  We're don't have to feel like the driver is swindling us on anything.    If you're upset about how much you're making then your advice should to have uber raise their rates to riders so that you earn more.  It's as simple as that.    They likely won't do that because there are so many drivers willing to drive for them.  So you have two options then.  Suggest to uber a more strict driver rating system to remove other drivers for bad performance, or somehow prove that you are actually employees and deserve a minimum wage.  The second option obviously has severe downsides and challenges to you.  EDIT: Figures, downvotes with no replies.  I sometimes wonder if it's the vocal minority on here that are more like taxi drivers than the friendly uber drivers I get."

I'm not saying increase the fare to the cost of a cab, I'm saying its already a third of the price, they can increase it by 50 cents and it would still be 27% cheaper than a cab, shit EVEN IF IT WERE the price of a cab and riders WERE ENCOURAGED TO TIP, it's still worth the experience of an UBER over a CAB. You're saying that the only thing that seperates the uber experience from a taxi is the price? You're ungrateful. I wish I never get a rider like you."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,DIYDuder,0,Tue Jul 21 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"Your incentive to be a good uber partner is that you get to earn income you previously had no access to.

I want you people and uber to succeed.  Im sorry for coming off as a cunt with my comments, but you need to realize why you and uber have such a growing popularity.  Not having a tip system is such a large part of it.  It honestly ruins the model if you try to introduce tipping into it."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,scsibusfault,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, you need to realize that probably > 75% of uber drivers drive under 15 hours a week, they sign up and drive because they are under the conception they can make decent money doing so, by decent I mean averaging 15 dollars or more an hour after expenses. You yourself just admitted that you wouldn't stop using uber if it were to increase by 50% a mile, because it's so convenient, it's such a safer and better experience as opposed to a taxi. Tipping does not equate to loss in wages, this isn't the food/beverage service industry. You said my incentive is basically the opportunity itself, Well, I could maintain a 4.7 rating and still keep my job, so when I'm getting hundreds of 5 star ratings and people tell me I'm the best uber they've had, it's reasonable to expect something out of it, more than a pat on the back. Riders are under the assumption that ""we make bank"" it's bullshit dude, TIP YOUR DRIVER. PEACE."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,DIYDuder,0,Wed Jul 22 02:52:40 2015 UTC,"No, you're wrong.  First off I never said why I hate taxis and like uber.  So fuck you for putting words into my mouth.  I never said I would pay 50% more because it's more convenient.  Again, fuck off.  Tipping can and will equate to loss wages because then uber will pay you less when they can say that's how society views you   Guess what, society doesn't.  We want flat rates andante end routes.  Don't talk like a fucking cabbie.  You agreed to what you'd be paid WITHOUT TIPS EXPECTED.  So don't fucking expect the tipping system to change.  If you're not making enough then fight uber, not the riders who use the service.  Don't be an asshat."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,scsibusfault,5,Wed Jul 22 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think when you state people don't deserve tips and they should prove they are employees in order to receive a bump in pay with the goal of ""receiving minimum wage"" it won't be received well. Your point of asking uber to raise the rates is valid, but uber won't do that's I long as it has enough desperate, underemployed people to take advantage of. The law of supply and demand."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,DIYDuder,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"An option to tip would be exactly that. An option.   Do all lyft riders tip? No. But most drivers say it's a reasonably high percentage.   It doesn't cost Uber anything to implement a tipping option, and fuck, they could even skim 20% off the top for all I care. But when 80% of my riders comment on the fact that they would tip if the app accepted it, I'd say your in the minority in your feeling that it'll make us ""seem like taxi drivers"".  Taxis require tips, otherwise you get irate foreign men yelling at you. Make it optional and make it after the fact, and we wouldn't even know until we check our pay statements later."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,Iagospeare,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:21:56 2015 UTC,"And you honestly think that wouldn't change the relationship between driver and rider at all?  Uber is much more popular than lyft for many reasons.    I'm in a major city and I have NEVER heard of any of my friends or acquaintances asking to tip an uber driver.  It's about get in, get out, and knowing the fare.  Tipping would absolutely ruin that experience.  Have uber raise the rates if you're that upset.  Good luck with that for reasons I've already stated."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,scsibusfault,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I honestly don't think it would.  Uber/Lyft riders are very brand loyal. Lyft riders have no problem paying higher rates AND tipping. Uber drivers are continually surprised at the low rates, and like I said - if I give an exceptionally good ride, I often either get tipped, or they tell me they want to tip (but have no cash).   Maybe you're a negative person, or maybe you just have asshole friends that don't buy into the tipping economy?"
uberdrivers,3e11jo,Iagospeare,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"No, I live where the uber model of a flat rate once the ride is over is accepted.   My rating as a rider on uber is over 4.8 last I checked.  Also, lyft is nearly non existent because it can't compete with uber.  I live in Boston; an absolutely major city.  What I'm telling you is that you do not want to enter a business of tipping economy.  Then uber will pay you even less.  Look at how much waiters make from their employer.  If it's a socially 'optional' payment from the rider then you're fucked.   it will then have to become a socially 'required' option and you'll just be like the taxis.  I am honestly so far on your side to make a living it's pathetic.  I'm sorry for being such a cunt, but you need to get slapped in the face with reality on how this all works."
uberdrivers,3e11jo,banin0351,3,Wed Jul 22 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, tip-based service is just a way for companies to lower service pay. Other countries avoid tipping in the service industry because it generally hurts the employee more than the employer. If tipping was allowed, and became common, then drivers start making more money. Uber might try to get away with lowering fares more or taking a larger share, and then you're expecting a tip just to make the money you were making before. Now if someone doesn't tip well, like in the restaurant industry, you're not making as much money as you should and you blame the customer instead of the employer."

uberdrivers,3e11jo,405freeway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:29:35 2015 UTC,The point is that it's not a tip system.  That's why it's so popular.  The rider knows the rate and there is no awkwardness about expecting a tip.

uberdrivers,3e391u,uberotown,8,Tue Jul 21 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend buying a car specifically for uber. Having come from pizza delivery, uber is an order of magnitude step up.   Uber is nice and all, but it's a unsteady balance. There's a ton of factors that are completely out of your control that will affect how much you make. Company policy change (from $$ cut to number of drivers), demand changes (I can't imagine that winter will be nice to ohio uber), and municipalities change (here in kc we still can't pick up at the major airport and half the metro is still kinda in flux (kansas side)).  But if you're going to do it anyway, I would say to get as old a car as would get you thru 2 yrs of uber and something the size of an altima or camry."

If it's so small that 4 large people feel cramped, you might get hurt if you have 4 large people to pick up.  But you never know.  Because there is no rubric for rating drivers or passengers and Uber wants to keep it that way, you are always in danger of getting lower ratings for any reason the passenger feels like."

You will pay it off in no time if you're doing Uber full time and will still have a good amount of miles on it.   Don't make the mistake of putting your ego or personal preference into your car buying decision, you will just end up spending more and later regretting when you realize how much miles you're putting on it, plus all the quirks wear off anyway.   This is the car for the job. Buy it and thank me later"

If you don't look at the .57/mile cost (estimated for taxes) it averages out to be $15-$20/hour.   The PAX here are great. I've not had a bad experience between 250 rides on Lyft+Uber combined.

uberdrivers,3dzeba,tanisthemanis,8,Mon Jul 20 19:42:15 2015 UTC,How many trips did you take? account for the safe rider fee as well.
uberdrivers,3dzeba,sloppy-jugs,5,Mon Jul 20 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right.  If you gave 32 rides, they would deduct 32 dollars + 20% of whatever was left. (I assume you gave more, see math below.)  For example, if you have a short $5 fare, they take $1 for the safe rides fee, leaving you $4, and then they take 20% of that, leaving you with $3.20.  In that situation you only clear 64% instead of the 80% you were probably expecting."
uberdrivers,3dzeba,doctorkoala,6,Mon Jul 20 20:37:43 2015 UTC,"gotcha. yeah I gave 47 rides. I thought the $1 fee was passed to the consumer, not the driver. That, in addition to the 15% price drop they just instituted here in Richmond, VA, may make it not worth it to drive here..."
uberdrivers,3dzeba,n2hvywght,5,Mon Jul 20 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"I thought the $1 fee was passed to the consumer, not the driver.    It is, but it still shows up as in the total."
uberdrivers,3dzeba,UnCounted36244,5,Mon Jul 20 22:56:41 2015 UTC,It is paid by the customer.  It is not part of the earned part of the fare.
uberdrivers,3dzeba,KiotaKahn,4,Mon Jul 20 23:06:11 2015 UTC,so the money is really in longer trips then? percentage-wise at least. you keep more the longer you drive.
uberdrivers,3dzeba,Lifeguard2012,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the base fare. Here in South Florida, the base fare is $1, so every ride has a dollar added on to the mileage/time fare, and a dollar taken off for the safe rider fee. In areas where the base fare is less than a dollar, it's advantageous to take longer rides because Uber takes more off the top than they add at the bottom. In areas where it's over a dollar (if there even are any) it's the other way around."
uberdrivers,3dzeba,kikowatzy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"Here it's a $5 minimum. Which is good, because around the university/bar area I don't get over $5 for trips often."
uberdrivers,3dzeba,3raser,6,Tue Jul 21 02:52:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. That's actually the reason why I stopped driving for Uber. That $1 fee makes me actually lose money on the short rides.

uberdrivers,3dyq56,guber8,10,Mon Jul 20 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"Jesus fucking Christ. This is, without a doubt, the dumbest thing I've ever read about Uber. I'd almost think this was supposed to be a joke, except there doesn't seem to be any sort of punchline to it.   First, let's deconstruct the title alone. Richard Griffiths said in 2005 that ""fascism"" is the ""most misused, and over-used word, of our times"". And this is the best example of that I've ever read.   Also,   Literally.   No. Absolutely not. That's the exact opposite word of what you meant. Goddamnit.   You don’t find such environments outside of dystopian films, the vampire hotels in the TV series “Trueblood,” and goth bars, if those still exist.  If Voldemort founded a taxi company, its logo would look something like Uber’s.   Lets name some more evil things next to the word Uber so that Uber looks bad by association, even thought it has nothing to do with it. At all.    When you think “Uber,” what do you think of? Awesome?  If you are of a certain age, or like to watch World War II movies, there’s no way to avoid the association with “Deutschland Uber Alles,” the German national anthem.   This guy knows that Nazis aren't Facists, right? Oh, no, of course he doesn't.   The trains ran on time in Germany under Hitler and in Italy under Mussolini. Any Uber user will tell you that one of the things that they love about the service is its remarkable on-time performance.   Holy fuck. Is the grocery store also Nazi/Facist/Dark Wizard because they open up on time every day?   Yellow-cab drivers and Uber drivers alike complain that Uber is decimating their incomes and treating them “like slaves.” Slave labor: No one did it better than the fascists.   I can't say I'm thrilled with the money from Uber, but fuck you if you compare it to slavery. Seriously.    For Uber, it’s 1939 in Nazi years. Founded in 2009, the company has, much like Chancellor Hitler, gone from nothing to the verge of world domination.    Yeah, compared to every other company in the world who doesn't want to expand.   Someone please tell me this is a cheap, humorless rip off version of The Onion.   Please."

uberdrivers,3dzqr5,monsto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"First of all this is kinda how it works with phone info . . .  your ph# > your uber ph# >< riders uber ph# < riders ph#  You both get an assigned number so that your real number is anonymized.  Because of this, your contact to a rider will always be the same number. So save that number in your contacts.  NOW you can ""ok google . . . call UBER PICKUP"" (that's my contact name) and it will dial them. I haven't tried ""send text"" but I'm betting that would work as well.  I would further bet that you could setup canned messages for it.  Anyway, I don't bother with texting them. I always call when I get there.   ""Hi this is monsto from uber, I am out front."" If they don't answer the call, then I'll text that same thing and start the 5 min timer."
uberdrivers,3dynfg,Flippy1,8,Mon Jul 20 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"Research, Research, Research.    Learn your way around town, especially around the bars, airport, train station and hotels.  Learn the best shortcuts around traffic if you're planning on driving rush hours.  Learn where you can pick up and where you can't and when.  If you're planning on doing bar closing hours go out with the app off at bar closing time to learn what the scene is like in your town.  Learn where the hotspots are, and what nickname locals give them that won't pop up in the GPS.  Other new drivers will not have done any of this and will make mistakes.    I drove Portland, ME when it launched last year and passengers were so impressed that I knew what I was doing and said other drivers were getting lost and stuck on closed streets at bar closing time.  Many asked for my number and I got some repeat business out of it."
uberdrivers,3dynfg,nova828,4,Mon Jul 20 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"This. There's a sweet spot in the beginning where demand picks up and driver supply lags slightly behind. This is where you'll get the most out of driving. Before that happens, bring an iPad or book - lots of downtime. But you'll probably get incentives and guarantees to drive, and may get paid just for staying online for those reading hours. Take it from most folks around this sub - that window closes quickly in most places...  The standard advice applies. If you know where people eat, drink, and hang out, position yourself. Sporting events? Concerts? Put your promotion-code card in the hands of doormen/concierges if you're feeling entrepreneural. Get ahead of everyone else.  In my own experience: mid-2014 was good in Denver. I got a cash bonus just for signing up, there were no iPhone rental fees, they paid for inspections and physicals, and Boulder was on fire largely because no one was driving up there. Fast forward to today, and hundreds of drivers sign up every week to drive. The Denver airport is absolutely soaked with drivers.  Uber onboards very rapidly, so you have to capitalize on on that edge quickly. One weekend, it'll feel a whole ton slower than it's been, or the passenger app will be swarming with cars, and that's when you'll know it's time to move on."
uberdrivers,3dynfg,elcanon,5,Mon Jul 20 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"sink or swim.  if it wasn't for bonus requirements, a big minority of new drivers would drop out before hitting 30 rides.  a majority stop after 6 months for both uber and lyft.  and if you're in a small market, cut your losses now.  oh ya, most important part.  buy a brand new toyota avalon or max optioned Altima.  UberX passengers will love the ride and tip accordingly."
uberdrivers,3dynfg,didcotton,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"Brand new market?  Make your money with referrals for new drivers and promo cards for new riders, and take advantage of guarantees where you don't have to meet minimum requirements (if available).  My biggest regret is not just staying online 24/7 when they launched in Orlando, because it was $15-20/hr and no minimum trips, and no one was using it yet!"

uberdrivers,3dw1xf,TxChampagneMassacre,4,Tue Jul 21 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Some drivers will insist that you do two separate trips, but I had a similar situation this weekend. PAX asked me immediately upon getting in my car if i would mind two separate drop-offs and the destinations were fairly close to each other. It wasn't really a big deal so I did it, and got a tip out of it. I have had PAX tell me that if they were made to re-request, they would probably rate the driver a lot lower. It's basically a trade-off: the higher rating or an additional pickup (and ""safe rider"") fee,"
uberdrivers,3dw1xf,TheManDapperDan,7,Mon Jul 20 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"What does the additional pickup get you though? Nothing... The safe rider fee goes to uber, not the driver and you don't get a per ride bonus or anything so I don't see what trade off could be in your favor."
uberdrivers,3dw1xf,TxChampagneMassacre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:27 2015 UTC,basically just the base fare. Like mine would be another $2.76

You will also see multiple stops before final drop off, maybe to a store or to pick up more passengers. It should all be the same to you as long as you are making money! Don't be surprised if you have someone else summon an Uber for their friend and not even get in the car, they might say ""This is my friend Mark, he's drunk just make sure he gets home safe.""! I've also been summoned to a location by a person who isn't even at the location and gotten a call telling explaining that you are picking up my Grandmother, please take care of her and take her home she knows how to get there.

The driver realizes he forgot at the end of the trip, starts the trip, immediately ends the trip, resulting in a minimum fare ride.  Then he contacts support and they adjust the trip.  So do you get two receipts?  One right away for $4-$5 then another receipt later for the full fare?  Do they explain the driver fucked up?"
uberdrivers,3dwlr0,djsekani,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"For your first question, yeah. Is it better to give directions or to put in the address?  For your second, it depends. Sometimes they correct the fare, sometimes they don't. But it'll always be the minimum fare plus 5-10 cents"
uberdrivers,3dwlr0,monsto,6,Mon Jul 20 04:35:22 2015 UTC,PLEASE put in the address. Taking turn-by-turn directions from a passenger can be a safety hazard (i.e. you want me to make a right turn in two blocks and I'm cruising at 50 MPH in the left lane) or an annoyance (i.e. you want me to make a right in two blocks and at the last second you realize you miscounted and I actually need to go two more blocks).

There might be higher demand but those messages just flood the area with more drivers.  Major concerts or sporting events? You'll get one pickup at the venue after being stuck in traffic and then that'll be it."

uberdrivers,3duh8f,sexymugglehealer,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"There's of course no proof for artificial surges, however I totally experienced what you did multiple times.   About a year ago when I got started doing this, for the most part, whenever there was an area with surge, if I was there, I'd almost always get a ping. Compared to how it was the last few times I went out, well, I'd be driving up and down the area with surge and I wouldn't get lucky.   Idk how much uber pays in your area, but if there's anything else you can do for extra money, do that. Don't do uber. It's not worth it if the rates are anything like how they are in LA now. Best of luck to you."

I even put on about 60 mi last night just cruising around trying different locations, but every time I checked the pax app I saw the same cars siting in the same spot all night, so I'm pretty sure they weren't getting calls either."
uberdrivers,3duh8f,slingstone,2,Sun Jul 19 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind; drivers looking at pax app artificial inflate demand.  So, if a bunch of drivers are in an area with little demand, but they are all looking at the pax app, it could cause a surge with no actual pax."

uberdrivers,3duh8f,BramasoleATX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"UberX has been operating in my market for 9 months.  In my experience pax are now getting wise to how it works.  They wait out the surge period and request immediately after it ends.  They only request during a surge if the journey is very short.  And as others have said, the big increase in driver numbers may artificially create a surge due to them checking other drivers locations in the rider app.   When I started driving 7 months ago I would nearly always get a surge fare when I drove into a surging area.  Now I hardly do - surge fares rarely account for more than 5% of my weekly pay statement.  Also, in my market anyways, some of the surge areas are quite large.  You need a bit of local knowledge to suss out where the pax are likely to be within each surge area - if you're located in the wrong part of the surge area you won't get any pings.  I'd leave the fake surge theories for the conspiracists."

Probably came about from shitty drivers taking drunks the long way home or not ending the trip after dropping off.  They will confirm legit and pay you next week.

I have heard from other posts that, depending on which insurance you have, if they find out that you are using the car for uber they will drop your insurance. It's something to do with using your vehicle for commercial instead of personal use. The way I understand it, if I get rear ended with a pax in my car, uber will cover it, but if I get into an accident when I'm on the way to pick up a pax, then I've never heard of uber. I'll deny ever working for something like that, just to make sure I'me covered. I know I checked with mine before I started driving and I wouldn't have coverage if they found out I was using my car for commercial use. They wouldn't cover me If i was a pizza delivery guy either.

Eventually, people are going to get used to it and they won't be able to hang their hat on that alone anymore.  At that point, I think is when you'll see them start to make the effort into improving quality.    The unregulated nature of it is exactly what's going to allow it to do well, I think.

That way it can be removed and washed so it will not get into your seat.   Since you are in the seat that is smelly it can be seeped in. At worst case scenario see if you can get a shampooing of that seat (hopefully not leather) which should resolve your issue.

uberdrivers,3dq2ah,walkersm,4,Sat Jul 18 18:11:48 2015 UTC,Interesting. Rates have lowered and drivers have increased. Again the pax were drunk and pretty rude. I have the right to drop them off. I just looked at my trip reports and I didn't even get paid for the 3 minute $4 trip. So fuck them. Now I complain to uber. So the fact that uber can take away the money we earned without notifying us are we employees or subcontractors???? I'm really pissed off now.
uberdrivers,3dq2ah,walkersm,3,Sat Jul 18 18:21:22 2015 UTC,Yea isn't that something? No notification or appeal process for taking wages away from you.  That's the lawsuit that needs to be happening.  Sadly it goes unnoticed because drivers are not keeping their own ride log and matching it up to what uber says you earned.
uberdrivers,3dq2ah,Won_Doe,3,Sat Jul 18 19:11:15 2015 UTC,Let's get it started. This happened before for absolutely no reason at all. So uber must be the employer if we have zero notification or recourse.

The correct protocol is take them to their destination and drop them off, not stop off at 5 different places and wait which is sorta what they wanted. I'm not a god damn limo or chauffeur.

uberdrivers,3dlw2n,FellintoOblivion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:23 2015 UTC,Noticed this myself last night. Kept getting requests in surge areas and noticed the request screen didn't show the multiplier. I figured they requested right before the surge or right after since the map doesn't update in real time. When I did pick up a passenger who I knew had a surge price despite it not showing on the request screen it didn't display it on the info or waybill screen either.   I wonder if this was intentional on Uber's part to stop drivers from not accepting rides when they know the surge is about to go up. I'm sure drivers are causing an artificially high multiplier during certain times by not accepting rides in anticipation of a surge.
uberdrivers,3dlw2n,OhVeryClever,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:17:18 2015 UTC,That's my guess as well. The problem I was having was being in a surge area and getting a ride request just outside of it. I wouldn't accept those. Now I have no way to tell.
uberdrivers,3dlw2n,jjs2424,0,Sun Jul 19 17:26:50 2015 UTC,This has happened to me in a newly surging area - I believe it's only when someone requests right before the surge. That was my assumption at least. I usually pass on them.
uberdrivers,3dlvtb,SoCal_UberX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:25:16 2015 UTC,"I had the strangest experience yesterday.  I had waited in the queue for over an hour with nary a ping. Then I got a ping from near Rosecrans and Nimitz, obviously not at the airport. I accepted since I had had it with the queue anyway. As soon as I accepted that ride I got an ""extended ride"" ping. since I had never had one I wasn't sure what was happening. I accepted it though. Then I got another, then another. I accepted a couple of them - not knowing what to do - then finally let them roll.  I picked up my off airport pax and lo and behold she was going to the airport a whole 6 blocks away.  Whatever.  Then more ""extended ride"" pings as I was going to the airport. Dropped off the pax and hit ""accept Alice"" on the Uber phone. Alice was at terminal 2 but I wasn't sure which zone. I tried to contact Alice but ended up texting Rachael down at Hornblower Cruises on Harbor Drive. WTF?.. Then Alice calls me and informs me she is at zone P. (I have an airport permit so no problem picking up curbside) I pick up Alice all the while receiving ping after ping after ping. WTF?  Alice tells me she has been waiting an hour and had several cancellations. BTW, she was going to 500 W Broadway... whoopee...  Logged off and went up to the Pyramid to report all this. After waiting an hour and a half while Uber onboarded another 50 drones to further saturate the market, I said to hell with it and went home. I had a butt load of cancellations showing and who know what my acceptance rate is with all the pings I ignored.  If it happens again, I will accept every ping and hope I can make contact with which ever person is on the screen.  Anybody else have any such experiences? Especially at SAN?"

I use to drive for uber and I still think it's a cool company. But they're not really creating jobs, they're replacing them. They're giving work to people that already work and make an extra 40 dollars after work. Is that really creating a job? Besides all these jobs will be eliminated once self driving cars come to be. So they're creating minimum wage temporary jobs."
uberdrivers,3dl1id,wfish,4,Fri Jul 17 03:19:05 2015 UTC,Nothing - your average is still 5 stars.  No rating left (0.0) = does not form part of Uber's averaging calculations.
uberdrivers,3dl1id,truewheels,0,Fri Jul 17 06:21:22 2015 UTC,"It seems too.  That's how I noticed, my rating went from a 5 to a 4.88.  The summary for the past day only shows the one ride with a 0 rating.  I haven't noticed unrated rides changing my average before, so maybe it's something with the latest software release.  Shows the same 4.88 rating in the app and the website.  I know you can't give a zero star in the driver app.  I don't have any experience with giving ratings in the rider app.  Doing the math, it really seems like they rated me 1 star, ((31*5)+1)/32=4.875, and the summary is just showing zero.  I'm not really worried about it.  Just thought it was worth bitching about and hoped to get a few other stories out of it.  I mean, in my area driving is literally a minimum wage gig.  Can't take it too seriously."

uberdrivers,3dl1id,uberati,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:42:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems to jibe with what I'm seeing.  I haven't driven in several days and the previous rides all averaged five stars.

uberdrivers,3dim3e,elcanon,3,Fri Jul 17 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're in North Jersey. Although I don't drive here, I grew up here and spend a lot of time in the area, especially in jersey city. I've taken a bunch of Uber rides in the area and spoken to the drivers (UberX, UberBlack, and VIP.) So I have a mini non-scientific meta-analysis of what they have to say.  Hoboken is still pretty hostile to Uber, although I've heard that their crackdown isn't quite as bad as it once was. Most NJ drivers are hesitant to pick up at EWR, because the Port Authority is very conscientious at ticketing and possibly impounding Uber drivers.  I'd be super careful at the Hudson River crossings, especially the Holland Tunnel. Port Authority cops like to stand around the tollbooths and look into people's vehicles, especially when there is heavy traffic. If it's evident that you're driving for hire with regular plates, they might give you heat. There's a video out there (I think it was linked on uberpeople.net) of a driver who had this happen to him.  Almost all of the drivers around here complain that it's slow because of saturation; one driver said he'd been sitting around for over an hour for a request, right in downtown Jersey City. (This was a weekday afternoon, to be sure.) They say Hudson County, Montclair and Morristown can all be good on weekends. Although you don't like Jersey City, it seems there is good action there.  According to some drivers, the shore used to be good, but they lowered the rates this year to closely match the rest of NJ. It gets flooded with drivers. At the really popular spots, be sure to pick up and drop off where it's designated.  A lot of drivers don't mind driving into Manhattan and coming back empty, well, because $20. I learned from a driver that if you have 2 or more passengers, you can qualify for the carpool rate at the bridge/tunnels by going into a staffed lane, and it's only $5.75 for the toll. (You might need to register your E-ZPass for that deal.)  Some drivers complain that North Jersey gets infiltrated with NYC drivers. Anecdotally they may be right, I see tons of TLC-registered cars around, especially on the weekends.  Have fun and enjoy! I've heard that NJ is considering new regulations for drivers, so keep your ears open for any changes..."

Uber was ordered to produce information (along with all the other TNCs operating in CA).  They refused, and made a bunch of highly questionable arguments when they could have just as easily complied.  Bigger than the fine is this:  unless Uber files an appeal or complies with the order to produce information, UberX will be illegal in CA until they either comply or win on appeal.  It's telling that Lyft ran into some similar issues, but they quickly got with the program and settled with the PUC.  If Lyft can produce the information, there's no reason Uber can't."
uberdrivers,3dfo6q,jjs2424,3,Thu Jul 16 00:20:46 2015 UTC,Uber will appeal. And keep it locked in appeals. They don't want to release that info for competitive reasons which is total BS.

uberdrivers,3dfo6q,scottevil110,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"on the flip side: unregulated taxi drivers with little oversight who are committing fraud with their insurance carriers since they are operating their vehicle commercially despite signing a policy saying that they won't.   That would be the insurance company's concern, not yours or Uber's.  I didn't carry commercial insurance when I was working for a pizza delivery place, either.   The business model is to lower prices at the expense of the drivers because they mislead drivers on insurance risk and the net pay is at or below minimum wage once depreciation, gas and expenses are taken into account.   And that's up to individuals to decide if they feel it's worth driving for Uber or not.  The fact that thousands of people are still doing it would suggest that plenty of people are fine with how it's set up.   The taxi industry needs to change, but that doesn't legitimize this shitty company.   This is how the taxi industry changes.  This is what I don't get about reddit (I know you're not representative of all of reddit).  People bitch and complain about a company like Comcast because ""They have no competition.  It's a monopoly!"".  But then in this case, what you have is exactly that.  Competition.  A company doing it a different way, and weakening the monopoly that cab companies have...and everyone still bitches about it.    What the hell does everyone want?

As for exploitation, Google says:   exploitation, n. the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.   Uber definitely does this routinely.

At least in San Diego Uber was committing insurance fraud continuously between May 2013 and July 1, 2015 by telling people that their personal policies would cover them in between Uber trips while online.

I feel like this has nothing to do with your opposition.   Actually it just shows that plenty of people are willing to accept low pay due to a shitty economy   Yes, that's what a shitty economy means.  High supply, low demand equals lower wages.

Unless it says they can refuse to pay you if you make a technical error, you're still owed the money.  Try pointing that out to them and that if they don't pay you, they're in breach of contract and you'll sue them.  You may want to tone it down if you're afraid of being canned, but I wouldn't."

If you go this route, you may get much more than the fare you are owed because they will likely rule you are an employee (other rulings have gone this way).

uberdrivers,3dbsns,lolerblades,8,Wed Jul 15 05:43:21 2015 UTC,"UberPOOL is bad for Uber drivers. Here's why:   More supply = Less surge. When more pax use UberPOOL, more pax fit into fewer ubers, this means surging is less likely.  Slow routing. UberPOOL means that drivers spend more time on rides, and less time waiting in between rides. True. But it also means that routes are often plagued by a lower average speed. A $15 ride that could be completed in 15 minutes using the freeway might take 45 minutes when a 2nd passenger's destination or pickup location requires a slower route along side streets. As you all know, Uber drivers are best compensated for mileage, not time. Lower ratings. Some passengers don't know what they are getting into with UberPOOL. There isn't enough passenger education. When a naive passenger requests UberPOOL, and realizes they have to go out of their way to pick up another passenger, or worse, if one passenger is rude to the other, your rating WILL suffer. There is a caveat: You get rated twice in a 2-passenger UberPOOL ride so your rating might improve faster if you get a double 5-star. However, double 1-star will wreck your rating.  Surge dilution. Example: pick up passenger #1 in an uber pool at 2x surge, if your second passenger pings with a lower surge, you lose most of the bonus pay. How uber calculates this is anyones guess. Again, documentation on this is non existent as far as I'm aware. More work, same pay. Most drivers agree, picking up a passenger is often the hardest/most intensive part of the uber driving experience. You get to do this twice for what is essentially the same pay (or worse).   In a city like Los Angeles, which has very little downtime anyway, UberPOOL is just not worth it to the driver. Just treat UberPOOL requests as regular uber requests and ignore/cancel the 2nd request unless it's surging higher than your first one. My two cents."
uberdrivers,3dbsns,driveby40,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:26:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for that great write up! I don't like accepting Pool rides just because I feel like I'm losing out on money since I know it takes much longer to get the 2nd pax as you stated above. Now it's in my city(South Bay) and I know itll take even longer to complete rides
uberdrivers,3dbsns,CChunk,2,Wed Jul 15 07:33:12 2015 UTC,"No problem! I think it's important for drivers to realize UberPOOL is not in their best interest, but I don't think I have to worry... drivers who do a few UberPOOL rides will see very quickly how it's just an inferior experience with inferior pay. The real reason UberPOOL isn't a great deal for LA drivers, is, you guessed it, low base rates. If Uber paid a bit more for time and added a $1 pickup fee, UberPOOL would be much more attractive. Also if Uber added the ability to tip in app, then drivers could enjoy the possibility of a double tip with each successful UberPOOL ride. Won't hold my breath.  Also, take a hint from the Lyft Line feature, Uber! Since pax have to enter their destination, allow drivers to set a destination filter and receive UberPOOL requests headed in their direction. This would greatly improve the utility of the UberPOOL feature for drivers without requiring any change in fare structure."

I haven't received this text but I find most of my requests are NOT UberPOOL anyway. If they end up restricting my ability to accept UberPOOL I won't care. I seem to make the same amount or very close to it whether I pick up a 2nd passenger or not, so why should I bother? If they want me to pick up a 2nd passenger they need to pay me more.  Here is how I think it works, I have emailed Uber Support they have not responded:   1 pax UberPOOL: priced same as uberX  2 pax UberPOOL: sum of flat rates paid by each pax (-20%)  This means when you pick up 2 pax you aren't paid based on ACTUAL mileage and time, rather estimated time and milage.

You're going to be grossed out, your clothes will have wet spots when you get to your destination, you'll rate the driver poorly, and your perception of Uber will be tarnished.  So basically that car is out of commission until it's completely dry. The driver has lost a day's wages. He can't even park and call it a day, because if he doesn't dry it thoroughly it'll mildew. So regardless of whether it was urine or water, damage has been done and compensation should be expected."

uberdrivers,3daatz,amdnivram,5,Tue Jul 14 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with how Uber operates, I've only used it a few times. I probably should have worded my question differently and I'm not condemning the driver for charging a fee. But I'm glad I asked the question because I understand now that he probably lost wages from it, thanks to the comments I'm reading here. I'm not looking for sympathy or to screw the driver over. I'm just wondering under what circumstances a driver is entitled to make a claim and how that claim is calculated. There isn't much online about how these charges are calculated on Uber's website, just a tiny paragraph discussing bodily fluids.   Another question I have is; does the driver have to prove that he/she lost wages to be entitled to the fee? If cleaning is necessary, does the driver have to prove receipts that the car was cleaned? This is also for future reference. My friends incident was just what got me thinking about it. My town just got Uber last week and I'm curious as to how this whole thing operates."
uberdrivers,3daatz,sampiggy,11,Tue Jul 14 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"The driver submits a report and copies of the receipts for cleaning to Uber. Uber corporate then assesses the situation and decides how much to charge, taking into consideration not only the actual cleaning fee, but also the driver's lost earnings and Uber's take on their earnings. If this happened during a surge or just a busy time of day they'll charge more than they might in a slow period. If the driver is a full time driver and he just started his usual 8-hour stint, they'll charge more than they would for an occasional ""hobbyist"" driver. The driver himself is NOT deciding how much you will be charged.   Uber says the fee is usually between $100-$200.  Edit : I also want to point out that it doesn't matter one bit if it was water or pee. Driver goes to tidy the back seat before his next ride - his hand gets wet - welp, time to go get a complete upholstery cleaning for the back half of the car. You can't expect him to sniff his hand or taste it to try to figure out what it is! It's liquid, therefore it's disgusting. The end.  Your friend should have said something before he got in. It's entirely possible the driver had a towel in the trunk or something. Or maybe he'd let him get in, but make him sit in the front seat. This was a totally avoidable situation, as I'm sure you're well aware by now!"
uberdrivers,3daatz,Khtkiller5302,3,Tue Jul 14 22:12:34 2015 UTC,"well if the driver felt like they didnt want to deal with whatever your friend was dripping then its her fault regardless of what she has to pay.

Being unaware of the consequences should not excuse her from having to pay, ignorance should never mean a free pass.

uberdrivers,3daatz,FellintoOblivion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"Legitimately curious... As a blind person with a guide dog who encounters similar resistance from Uber drivers on occasion, what is your opinion on where to draw that line? Your perception of a rider's impact on your subsequent fares is highly speculative, no? I've been left in pouring rain before because I've had drivers cancel rides within 10 feet of me regardless of the fact that my dog is clean, well-behaved, and would lay quietly in the back. I have a lot of sympathy for a bartender that has to clean up someone's last call drunken mess. But they generally consider it part of doing business though, and this seems sort of similar, you can always give the passenger a low rating if they cause you considerable inconvenience that effects your subsequent fares, just like a rider can if you do something like take an obviously round-about route. I realize I'm in a very driver-friendly sub, but if y'all want your industry to continue expanding you're going to have to accommodate the unanticipated obstacle here and there just like any other industry needs to do. If you're going to drive daytime during the summer, how can you not anticipate a factor like someone that just got out of a pool calling an Uber to get home?"
uberdrivers,3daatz,technicalogical,2,Thu Jul 16 07:43:58 2015 UTC,"My feelings about service dogs are exceedingly positive.   I don't want you to think I'm some Uber passenger hate monster. I get excited about new and interesting situations in my car.  The service dog is neccesity. It's as important to the person using it as the insulin I keep in my glove compartment or the glasses I wear everyday.  Bring on the service dogs,  bring on the wheel chairs,  bring on the colostomy bags.  But if someone thinks for one second that bringing their white toy poodle into my car because he likes to go for rides is acceptable they can dance, not ride right on through their dumb happy lives. Also bars have the right to turn down normal animals as they please.  But service animals is a different story.  If someone gives anyone gruff for needing a dog to live a life closer to what is considered normal,  that person is sick and probably needs to go back through their childhoods and learn sympathy,  empathy, or how to just be a flipping decent human being.    That being said,  it's nice to get a call to let me know there's going to be a dog so I can get my beach towel out of my trunk so I can make the car ride equally beneficial to both of us.     If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.  Sincerely  Khtkiller5302"

As someone who just is, well, a little different from most passengers I just urge drivers to try to give people the benefit of the doubt when you encounter something out of the ordinary. And I always call ahead to let drivers know I have a service dog. Appreciate the positivity on that front! I'd say about 90% of drivers are similarly supportive and it's one reason why I have no sympathy for the taxi industry which was often much more confrontational."

If you bring a wet dog into my car, my car is going to smell like wet dog. Most people don't find the smell of wet dog enjoyable. Will this affect my rating? Maybe and I'm not willing to take that chance.   Giving a low rating to a passenger is not equatable to receiving one as a driver. Having a low rating as a passenger (speculatively) may lead to a longer wait for a ride but having a low rating as a driver impacts my ability to make money.  I understand disabled people are a protected class but just as we as drivers have to deal with unexpected obstacles so do disabled people. I will refuse to pick up someone with a wet dog 100% of the time whether it's a service animal or not and not to seem like a jerk but you have absolutely zero recourse in the matter."

uberdrivers,3daatz,chase001,5,Wed Jul 15 21:54:14 2015 UTC,In a subreddit for Uber drivers you're going to have a hard time finding sympathy.
uberdrivers,3daatz,logarath,4,Tue Jul 14 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking for sympathy, I'm looking for information from people that know best. This happened to a friend and I was curious about Uber's rules/regulations. I didn't see much online. I have used Uber three times in my life so I'm unfamiliar with how they operate and didn't even know they would charge people for clean-up fees until my friend told me about it . I'm looking for good info because my town go Uber last week, finally, and I want to be a good customer and not be surprised when things happen or if there is a situation in which I can get charged extra without knowing.   Definitely didn't come here to get gilded!"
uberdrivers,3daatz,chase001,6,Tue Jul 14 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"Your friend's actions took the Uber driver offline for the rest of that day / night.  $200 is easily achievable in the right times, and your friend quite possibly cheated them out of it by being inconsiderate.  Fuck, I keep a towel in my car for the off chances that it's raining when I'm out picking people up... Or if I have to pick up a person with a service dog.  The driver might have been a bit more understanding and helpful had your friend fucking said something.  IMO, your friend should learn a lesson here and never do that shit again."

She called him a name and he dumped his bottle of water on her.  I reported this to Uber exactly as it happened.  Customer Service responded (promptly) with an ""oh, poor you.""  My seats were soaked and I couldn't drive for the rest of the night.  It was 10pm and I expected to drive until 2 or 3am.  I lost 5 of my most profitable hours.  Uber should have a provision for making a car undriveable.  I've driven two heavy smokers who stunk up my car for over an hour after I dropped them off.  My next passengers were EXTREMELY put off by the smell and I believe they rated me poorly because of it.  My air freshener didn't help.  The only smell worse than smoky cougar is smoky cougar crossed with citrus breeze."

If you're still not sure after this thread, you can always call/text your driver once you're connected to make sure it's OK with them.

Do what others say and get there, hit arrived, start your timer. Text at 2 minutes that you are out front. Leave at 5 minutes.   Of course a few times I have waited longer it turned into decent rides. So if you are in an area of possible longer rides you might not want to be as strict. YMMV I do not start the ride until I am ready to start. What if the PAX says start the clock and then takes 20 minutes coming out the door? What if they show up with more than 4 after you started the trip? Well when you end the trip they are going to be able to rate you. 18 cents a minute for a few  minutes is not worth it to me to give up control whether I want the riders in my car or not."
uberdrivers,3d9itb,KmyJelly,4,Tue Jul 14 19:18:15 2015 UTC,It takes on average 3 minutes from the time I hit arrive to the time they get in my car. I take 50 trips a week. So 2.5 hours wasted waiting for riders not getting paid. Uber should start the trip like lyft does when we arrive.

(Since, in my city, no one is ever exactly where they drop the pin)  I also have a hotkey autocomplete (or canned message depending on the app) set to zz on my phone so that as soon as I get the trip I shoot off a semi-automated text that says,    ""Hi, this is your uber driver Bob! I'll be in a Blue Scion XB. Omw! :)""  That gets people thinking and aware of my time before I even head that way.

uberdrivers,3d9itb,bing281,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:41 2015 UTC,Correct look at your watch or clock right when you hit arrive button.  Then just cancel after 5 minutes usually means closer to 6 minutes if you don't have a clock with a seconds hand.
uberdrivers,3d9itb,BramasoleATX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:21:40 2015 UTC,Correct
uberdrivers,3d9itb,manwith4names,2,Wed Jul 15 10:28:26 2015 UTC,"My most recent trip was 3 miles with a duration of 8 min and cost the pax $6.47. The cost per min for that trip was ~$.81/min. The cost per min for waiting 5 minutes is a solid $1/min and that's without having to use 3 miles worth of gas (for the trip at least). Cancelling a trip after 5 minutes is the most profitable way to drive.  In terms of clicking start, you're supposed to click start when they get in the car. That way they can cancel when they realize they drunk requested an Uber. Also your pay per minute is abysmal and getting an extra $.13 isn't going to do much besides possibly anger the pax that you started the fare early."
uberdrivers,3d9itb,spectacle13,2,Tue Jul 14 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna play devils advocate here.  I'm an Uber user who has no other choice, I work as a truck driver and my time off in random places around the country leave me without a vehicle to get where I want to go.   I spend so much time working that I rarely get to spend what I make, and have very few bills.  Since discovering uber, if my trip is less than $10, I ALWAYS tip $5 in cash because I know uber hits you for a percentage of what is taken from my card.   I try to be downstairs when you arrive, and I don't agree with wasting your time, but cancelling my trip after 5 mins is a little excessive."
uberdrivers,3d9itb,sound_defect,4,Wed Jul 15 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"That's the standard though. After 5 minutes it's assumed the passenger isn't coming, it feels like a long time when you're just sitting there waiting. If you're going to be slow just text or call and most people will wait. If you're a truck driver you should understand somewhat. You're not making money unless you're moving, sitting there idling is just costing someone money."

uberdrivers,3d9itb,bing281,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:34 2015 UTC,As a rider I always make sure to tell the driver to start the clock if I'm going to take more than a couple seconds (i.e. Wife still getting ready usually).   I don't think there's anything wrong with starting the fare from when you arrive (as that is your time you are spending as a result of the customer not being ready).  But I had one driver tell me that pretty much no one does that.
uberdrivers,3d9itb,bing281,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:57 2015 UTC,No one does that because if you start the fair you can't cancel without being able to get rated or get no money.  It is better to wait for 5 min then cancel so you get $5 for canceling then to start the trip and accidentally get stuck their waiting 10 minutes then having to cancel with either less then $5 and the ability to get a 1 star rating or no money at all for your time.
uberdrivers,3d9itb,AnnArchist,3,Wed Jul 15 04:07:48 2015 UTC,I however just keep Lyft on and if I get a Lyft request I don't worry if I have waited 1 or 5 minutes I just cancel and leave.  People making you wait is the bane of Uber driving.  I also rate people like this if you make me wait you are auto 4 stars.  However if you get in my car apologetic I bring that back up.  If you act like its your entitlement for me to wait definitely 4 stars possibly lower at that point depending on the rest of the ride.

If you did get scammed, the driver will receive nothing. Regardless, if you weren't in the car (which you can prove since your phone's gps was not following the same route as the driver), you will get your money back"
uberdrivers,3d9wqh,daisrael,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:17 2015 UTC,It's likely that they picked up the wrong passenger.  In heavy bar areas or college areas it happens more. It can happen by accident or by a passenger being shady. I've had both when I was new. Uber will reverse the charges for you.

If it ever happens again, cancel the ride when it goes to in route.  The trip will cancel on the drivers phone and he will know he got the wrong people.  I have a stripper that loves to scam Uber ride at 2am out to the strip club.  She knows a few of the cars and will just jump in when she sees them.  She than makes some excuse that Jeff told me to take the Uber.  I confirm my destinations before I leave the bar so if I got the wrong rider I will know before I leave and drive them around for free."

I received an email ~10 mins later asking for pics and a description of the problem...which I had already submitted in the app.  I responded to that email with photos and information, then didn't hear anything for ~2.5 days.  I sent a total of 6 emails asking for ANY info; nothing.    I finally took to twitter, pissed off, and blasted uber, uber support, and my local MI uber support. I received one call on my pax # and a call on some other number that's apparently outgoing only.  They said they would expedite the process, and I could expect $50 for my trouble.  I was ok with $50, because I had cleaned it up no problem & it was 1:30a anyway, so going offline wasn't an issue & it ended up going towards home.

Once you lie, you will be so totally hosed regarding car insurance that you will hate the words Uber and Lyft.  If you don't lie, claim denied for using your car for commercial purposes.

uberdrivers,3d9cxq,konawayne,4,Wed Jul 15 11:47:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is why I haven't taken the driver plunge yet... Just for CHECKING for a ride-share quote from my (existing) Geico when it was right in the drop down on their web site, I was peppered with letters and forms to fill out to certify that I haven't ever done any ride-share driving... So, I did more research and because Uber's policy only kicks in when you accept a ride, you are technically not covered by your personal insurance while you have the app on driving around waiting to accept a ride. This is called the insurance gap and is a huge controversy... I pay VERY good rates through Geico and with the pay I would make driving part time, there is no way I'm going to pay like $300 a month for commercial insurance.  TL;DR: If you are a driver without specific commercial/rideshare insurance you can either be dropped for fraud if your insurance finds out, or totally financially screwed if you get in a wreck and they find out, especially if you have the app on and are available."

uberdrivers,3d9jwn,techpenguin16,14,Tue Jul 14 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"There is so much horseshit in that video it's hard to quantify, but what the hell, let's give it a shot:   Taking a cab keeps the money in the local economy.   Fair point.  Granted, Uber only takes a small percentage of a fare, and the rest stays in the local economy just as much as a cabbie's pay does.     Cabbies have worked hard, and it's not fair to ""threaten"" them like this.   Wait for it...   Uber is going to have a monopoly and prices will go up.   This is the ironic bullshit I keep hearing from everyone else bitching about Uber.  ""Boo hoo, we hate monopolies...""  But the last point, that he made not 15 fucking seconds ago, is how terrible that it is for another company to be competing with taxi drivers.  So we're going to whine about there being competition....and then whine when there's no competition.   Tax-evaders like Amazon, Starbucks, Tesco are unavoidable.   We have no choice because we're only human.   Yes, you fucking do.  You just like cheap shit, so you keep buying it from Tesco and then complaining about it.  Shop literally anywhere else.  Support a local coffee shop or grocery store instead of shopping at a huge chain.     Uber's fares went up during the tube strike   Supply and demand...holy shit.  What's next?  The price of petrol is going to go up when there's an oil shortage?  The nerve...   £150 for a 4-mile journey with Uber - is that what you want?   If it's not...then I won't take the fucking ride, will I?  If the cabbies are cheaper and providing better service, as seems to be the claim here, then the prices won't be staying that high for very long, will they?  Tell me, if Uber is charging £150 for a 4-mile journey...how is that going to put black cabs out of business?    This pains me, because I know that Russell Brand is smarter than this.  I admire his intellect, but this is absurd.    How fucking complicated is the concept of ""If you don't like it, then don't use it""?"
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,scottevil110,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"As a cab owner/driver in a market that Uber is starting in soon, the missing point of your argument is legal regulations. Competition is not a fair descriptor of Uber's entry to any market anywhere in the world. It's always easier to make money if you ignore the law."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,devonhex,6,Tue Jul 14 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"Uber isn't ignoring the law.  They're not subject to those laws.  I agree that everyone should be on a level playing field, but I believe the answer to that is to decrease the regulations on taxis, not increase them on everyone else.    Uber is doing just fine without being buried in red tape, and I would argue that it'd be far better for cab drivers to operate in much the same way.  Which begs the question...why not just go drive for Uber?"
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,scottevil110,3,Tue Jul 14 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"Oh - I'll happily drive for Uber when they start up here if it's better than what I'm currently doing.

uberdrivers,3d9jwn,devonhex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't pay much mind.  I genuinely like it, and a lot of us do.  But clearly there are plenty of people who hate the shit out of it for whatever reason.  I'd certainly give it a try and see how you like it.    If you're used to the ""security"" of having an actual company behind you, I can see why it'd be frightening, because I, too, have heard the stories of Uber kinda hanging people out to dry when something goes wrong.  But for just making some money on the side, it's been pretty great for me."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,scottevil110,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"I don't get any security at all from operating under a company - I'm required to do so by law. But the company is also required to offer a 24hr call service, use a GPS based dispatch system, police its drivers and car signage, and comply with a lot of other stuff.   But they can't reduce my rates anytime they like either. They can take me off the road in response to customer complaints - which all get handed on to the transport authority.   In New Zealand the taxi industry has been deregulated for over 20 years insofar as the number of cabs on the road is not regulated - it's left to the discipline of the market. Fleet sizes reduce or increase over time in response to the market pressures. Also, anybody can start a company if they meet the requirements. Which means that if you offer a shitty service your customers will end up calling another company."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,devonhex,0,Tue Jul 14 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"That really isn't much different than Uber, except for the constantly changing rates, but that's basically what makes it awesome, in my opinion.  Sometimes the base rates go down, but we also have the surge for times of super-high demand.  Apart from that, it all sounds fairly similar, really."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,scottevil110,2,Tue Jul 14 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"Here is what I don't understand about Uber. why doesn't uber reverse their system? in california we will soon be considered ""employees"" of uber, which creates all sorts of problems for them. and then of course there is this whole taxi regulation nonsense.  so flip it. make Uber into a driver app that the drivers pay a fee to use and make the riders pay via credit card directly into a driver's business, llc, whatev. i don't see how this won't fix problems. because all you're doing is using an app to connect with a dude who is willing to drive you somewhere and then pay you some money. it's like if my buddy offers me $20 to drive him to the airport I will take it and drive him. but this isn't ""ride sharing"" this is me being his friend and driving him. uber would then charge drivers a fee based on their fares to use the app on a daily/weekly/monthly basis whatever."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,cheeseburgerwaffles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:19:49 2015 UTC,"because it increases the burden of entry for drivers, and they have enough trouble keeping them right now"
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,thunderkitty600,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea, but I think you'd lose a lot of people that way.  If Uber becomes some kind of subscription service where I have to pay regularly, then it's lost a lot of its appeal to me.  It means that if I don't drive one week, I'm losing money.  It means that I've gotta take X rides in a week in order to break even.  I'm sure I'd make more in the long run, but the flexibility is what appeals to me.  I'm guessing you'd lose a lot of people that way, and if Uber just becomes a bunch of people that are treating it like a full-time job, then it really is no different than a taxi service.  I guess what you're saying is that it'd be better if you could set your own rates, which I don't disagree with, but there's no reason that Uber couldn't integrate that and keep the ""free app, 20% fee"" structure.    Honestly, I like them deciding the rates.  Because they have a lot more information regarding supply and demand than I do.  If I were to go out right now and try to get some rides, I have no idea what I'd set my rate at.  Because I don't have any information on how many riders are asking for rides, how many other drivers there are, how much other drivers are charging, etc.  I guess they could supply me all of that information, but at the end of the day, the fact that Uber's only income is that 20% of my fare, it's in their best interest to be maximizing profit for BOTH of us.  They have every incentive to optimize the # of rides and the price per ride.  And a constantly updating computer algorithm and a couple of economists are going to do a much better job of that than I can."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,scottevil110,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"my point was that Uber would still take the same cut. except they aren't a middle man paying you out. they're now getting paid by you for using the app. so instead of taking 25% out of each ride, you now get a bill from Uber saying ""here's all the rides you did this month. you owe us $xx.xx which is 25% of what you made from using our app""  by them being the middle man and you being the payee, they are technically and legally your employer in some states, which is the current litigation. and on top of that they're basically a taxi service because of this (i think). but if you are ""running a business"" where you pay every time you use their app, then you're not employed by them. it's like me paying for my netflix subscrpition. but the equivalent would be i pay per each movie/show I watch.   edit: also what is up with people saying that Uber takes 20%? they take 25%. is this different per territory?"
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,cheeseburgerwaffles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's different by which service you're doing.  For UberX it's 20%, at least here.  I think like UberSUV is higher, maybe.  What would really be the difference in your idea vs. the current system?  Just the legal technicality of what service they're providing?  Could they not just claim that that's what they're doing now, except that they're handling the money for you?"
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,scottevil110,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:47:11 2015 UTC,Dang. 25% here in bay.  Lyft is only 20 plus they don't touch the tips so I've been driving them a lot
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,cheeseburgerwaffles,0,Wed Jul 15 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't uber, it's cities exploiting what was once a taxicab monopoly for profit, in the form of strong restriction and expensive medallions. Cities should act to reduce the regulatory and financial burden of taxicab operators. And cab companies need to step up to the changing times by lowering fares."
uberdrivers,3d9jwn,driveby40,2,Tue Jul 14 21:10:03 2015 UTC,There's no medallions where I live. The regulations on taxicabs in NZ have evolved to protect passengers - not drivers or their business. Even the surveillance cameras ($900 plus installation) that every cab must have by law are used overwhelmingly to police drivers rather than give them protection from passengers.

uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,2,Tue Jul 14 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"Wages, benefits, labor laws."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,LegoMovieExtra,0,Tue Jul 14 05:49:41 2015 UTC,"Ok so you're not entitled to benefits so being an employee would not guarantee that, the drivers are already being paid but if they start paying an hourly wage they will expect you to work a certain schedule ruining the flexibility that draws most drivers to the job in the first place. Many, if not most, of the drivers would not be able to do the job if they had to work a schedule so they would have to quit. And what are the labor laws that would be a benefit to the drivers?"
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,3,Tue Jul 14 06:22:10 2015 UTC,"And what are the labor laws that would be a benefit to the drivers?   Worker's Comp, if they're in an accident and cannot continue to work, including hospital bills.  Disability. (SDI in California)  Social Security contributed to by employer.    Medicare.  EDD contributions.  Protections for overtime pay & meal breaks.  These are all benefits whose costs Uber is outsourcing to it's drivers.  There are many other industries that do this, Uber being the most visible. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/worker_misclassification.html   the drivers are already being paid but if they start paying an hourly wage they will expect you to work a certain schedule ruining the flexibility that draws most drivers to the job in the first place.   There's a way to cover the drivers while maintaining flexibilty.  Lots of industries have temp or piece work employees with random schedules that still adhere to labor laws.  If ""most drivers would not be able to do the job if they had to work a schedule"", then wouldn't capitalism take over and incentivize the drivers that are able to fill in the gaps?"
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,supermegafauna,0,Tue Jul 14 14:49:11 2015 UTC,So fuck the current drivers then. Yeah that's really labor friendly.  And I absolutely love that you are invoking capitalist principles. Capitalism would dictate that the current drivers will stop working for uber if the conditions are so poor and uber will adjust their model accordingly. Your example is much closer to socialism.
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"You claimed that ""most drivers would not be able to do the job if they had to work a schedule""  (which is conjecture)  And I pointed out that, if this indeed the case, capitalism dictates that there would be an increased demand for those positions, which would be filled as supply dictates."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,supermegafauna,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:16:47 2015 UTC,"Ok first I'll address the lie at the beginning of your comment. I said ""many if not most drivers"" It is an indisputable fact that many drivers do it because they can work whenever they want however long they want. If uber has to pay them an hourly wage then uber is going to want to dictate when they work as there is no way they are going to pay someone to sit on their ass during down times. And you are right other drivers would probably fill the void, I never disputed that. What you are saying though is that the current drivers for whom a set schedule is not workable can get fucked. And drivers who can't work a fixed schedule would be forced out when the fixed schedule goes into place. My original comment stands strong. Somehow you think these labor polices are helping people even though thousands of drivers would be losing income. Why don't they matter to you?"
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,0,Tue Jul 14 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"It's currently not labor, remember.  They're partners and contractors.    Can't have it both ways."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,supermegafauna,0,Tue Jul 14 17:20:51 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to have it both ways. The argument is that making them employees is labor friendly. I just don't understand how you are helping people by forcing them to abandon a stream of income.
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,0,Tue Jul 14 17:39:13 2015 UTC,By the way labor classification and employee classification are not the same thing. You can be labor without being an employee.
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,0,Tue Jul 14 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"Also every one of those ""outsourced costs"" are agreed to by the drivers. Did you know that they don't have to drive for uber?"

uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"I have to say I agree with her as much as I hate to admit it.  The Uber structure is really nice for picking your own hours, but by classifying everyone as contractors, Uber can really get away with not providing the benefits that come with a normal job.  I've seen lots of posts on here discussing how Uber will change rates or provide little communication when they fire you or reprimand you. You still have rights and, though the title comes off as a bit sensationalist, her statements are in support of better labor protections for all workers."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,PM_ME_UR_RACIST_JOKE,5,Tue Jul 14 09:01:25 2015 UTC,"a normal job   It's not a 'normal job'.  Uber is successful because of their business model.  If drivers are employees, the model instantly breaks down and their business fails.    Uber's original model was designed for people to earn some extra cash in their spare time, and its still great for that, even with millions of drivers now on the system.  Yes - early on, drivers were making shit tons of cash, enough to live on even,  but thats not what it was designed for.  Uber doesn't want people to rely on Uber to put food on the table, they want you to drive so you can save up for your next vacation.  That is why they continue to make such a push for more and more drivers.   The ""problem"" they're having right now is that they've been too successful and they're obliterating the long established Taxi business.  Taxi drivers finding themselves under employed are now turning to Uber under a ""can't beat 'um, join 'um"" mentality, and they're making a huge mistake.  Uber can not maintain high profitability for drivers in the long run - its simply not part of their business model.    So - drivers are pissed about not making the boat loads of cash they thought they were promised (they  never were but they heard it from other drivers so as far as they're concerned - Uber promised them they'd be rich).  Unemployed people are turning to Uber in droves to try to ""make a living"",  its not working out, so they want more.  They want to be employees so uber has to pay benefits, and pay into social security and all the other benefits that go along with that.  However, the majority of drivers don't want that.  The majority of drivers like uber for what it is.  An extremely flexible, super easy way to make some extra beer money, or save for a vacation or new thingy they want, or even just an escape from the boredom of sitting at home alone surfing reddit every night.  They don't want to be employees - they don't want a set schedule and an overlord breathing down their back.   TLDR: Uber is not a job, its a way to earn some extra cash.  Anyone who is trying to ""make a living"" with uber, and only uber, really needs to wake up,  they're not being smart."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,drwuzer,2,Tue Jul 14 12:16:26 2015 UTC,Uber's original model was never for people to make some extra cash in their spare time.   This is how the advertisements went:   Make 90k per year driving UberX in SF Make 60k per year driving UberX in SF Make 800 per weekend driving UberX in SF Currently: Earn extra cash by driving for UberX
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,konawayne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, but I think that even small part time jobs have more regulations for labor protection than the current setup for Uber. I agree with you, but I also agree that there is probably benefits and requirements for any other employer that Uber is skirting by considering their employees as contractors."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,PM_ME_UR_RACIST_JOKE,3,Tue Jul 14 12:39:49 2015 UTC,"Again - Job = Employees.  Employees have bosses, employees have schedules,  employees can be fired for not showing up to work.  We're contractors.  Whatever Uber is trying to ""skirt"" is fine by me because I like being a contractor.   I signed up for uber in June.   I just got back from a 10 day vacation,  I'll probably drive a few nights this week and then I'll be leaving for another 10 days this Sunday.  If I were an ""employee""  there is no job on the planet that would allow me to do that."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,drwuzer,2,Tue Jul 14 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"If I were an ""employee"" there is no job on the planet that would allow me to do that.    This is a totally fallacy.  You're conflating freelance with contractor.  You can have the benefits of an employee and keep the flexibility. Tons of freelancers are treated as employees, even unionized.  Film industry, garment workers, temps, seasonal employees are all examples.     Edited to add:   If uber can put money into r/d on driverless cars & poach tech talent from Carnagie Mellon, they surely have the brainpower to figure out how to take care of their partners.  Until then, it's just a business decision to cut corners at people's expense.  See:  Walmart."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,supermegafauna,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:46 2015 UTC,It's your opinion that they are not taking care of their drivers. I've yet to meet a driver that would agree with you. And here's then beauty of the free market uber drivers are enjoying right now THEY CAN STOP DRIVING ANY TIME THEY WANT. If the conditions are so awful then why are so many drivers still doing it???
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,Odz2427,0,Tue Jul 14 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"It's your opinion that they are not taking care of their drivers.   You're right, but I'm not the only one, there is much criticism of the 1099 economy. California has recently actively pursued employers trying to save a buck my misclassifying employees.   I've yet to meet a driver that would agree with you.   Of course you haven't, but that doesn't make it right or wrong.   And here's then beauty of the free market uber drivers are enjoying right now THEY CAN STOP DRIVING ANY TIME THEY WANT.   Of course they can.  An employee's perception of their situation being acceptable, doesn't make it right.  Check out Karen Silkwood.   If the conditions are so awful then why are so many drivers still doing it???   Again this is a poor rationalization of existing labor laws that a company valued in the billions is skirting.  I'm sure you could find someone that would find it totally acceptable to take jobs that have unfair conditions and/or illegal.  Look in front of a Home Depot for an example."
uberdrivers,3d6v8i,supermegafauna,2,Tue Jul 14 18:49:57 2015 UTC,"My argument is that those labor laws are bullshit in the first place. The fact that other companies have to do it is poor rationalization against Uber. If California(horrible example of economic policy by the way) says any person seeking to open a new business must give their left arm in order to operate and Uber finds a way to ""skirt"" that law, pointing the finger at uber and claiming they are the problem does not make sense.   Here is the difference between my line of reasoning and yours. In my line of reasoning the worker has the choice to do the job uber is offering under their terms or they can reject those terms if enough people reject the terms and uber is unable to have enough of a workforce then they will be forced to adjust to the demands of the marketplace. Your line of reasoning says Uber can only offer what an all powerful overbearing group of government assholes says they can. If the workers like the way that uber is doing things now, they can all go fuck themselves because you should only be allowed to earn money the way the government says you can.  In other words I choose individual liberties over government safety nets that only keep us safe from prosperity."

uberdrivers,3d864s,CChunk,2,Tue Jul 14 06:58:20 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, a little of both, is it noticeable?, doubt it.   Prius (50 mpg) cost about 8 cents per mile to operation considering gas given current gas prices, average Uberx car probably gets between 30-35 mpg so about 15 cents per mile for just gas. So, maybe  there will be more riders and less drivers as gas cost alone will be close to Uber's commission in this market (20%)."
uberdrivers,3d864s,konawayne,2,Tue Jul 14 07:44:02 2015 UTC,"This makes no sense.  Using the IRS calculation for car expenses, it ""costs"" $0.57/mile to drive a personal vehicle and that number is high for many people.  Also, most people don't ""feel"" the cost of depreciation, so the perceived costs are probably about $0.20/mile.  Gas prices would have to at least quadruple to even get close to the cost of using Uber."
uberdrivers,3d864s,jjs2424,3,Tue Jul 14 07:17:24 2015 UTC,I think the perception is bigger aide than simple math. Most people are stupid and therefore will most likely think Uber to be the cheaper option.

I said, ""Sorry sir, but that's not allowed."" He almost seemed relieved that I said no: ""Ok man, I understand."" Pretty sure he was an undercover. He walked away around the corner.

The only problem is if they jump in and say I'll give you such such money to give me a ride. Free rides with no mention of money is OKAY. Nothing in that article of them claiming entrapment says money was mentioned. If no money mentioned they would NOT be arrested or car impounded.  Really, its kinda of silly to ever claim entrapment.

I don't get discouraged by small trips and I don't get over-excited by big ones. It's a mind game really. Great/funny/interesting chat makes it so much better too.

uberdrivers,3d6zl2,Jaw709,3,Tue Jul 14 00:35:43 2015 UTC,That's actually been happening to be since the last update. I thought it would have been fixed by this one since I just downloaded the update. Uber takes too long to switch to the gps and will sometimes just shut down after I open the gps. It'll also shut itself down right after I hit accept pick and other things meaning im stuck not knowing where Im going or where to pickup the pax. I found out this morning that you can restart your phone and the ride would still be there. I did it after i hit arrived but I couldnt hit begin trip because it decided to close and when I tried to reopen it it gave me unble to determine location for a good two minutes even if I try to open apps that require location like waze and then open uber. I drove a few blocks and restarted my phone. It seems to work better after restarting it after every ride. What I foud to is even when you close uber it'll still crash and exit out of anything I open on my phone unless I restart it on numerous occasions.
uberdrivers,3d6zl2,cerebrus21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:24:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough account of events. Is it still happening with the new update for you? Do you restart your phone after each trip and it fixes it? I am so frustrated right now..

Some drivers give everyone a 4, some drivers don't give a 5 unless they get a tip.  We can say that these ratings are either ""right"" or ""wrong"", but there have been no instructions from Uber on how to rate, and 95% of Uber drivers don't come to message boards or reddit to learn what this community thinks are best practices.

Once you arrive at your destination, your fare is automatically charged to your credit card on file — there’s no need to tip.  Personally, I wish they would change the wording to ""Tips are appreciated by your driver. Tip at your discretion if you liked the service provided."""

uberdrivers,3d4d0j,uber2016,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:18:12 2015 UTC,"Every rider who asks about tipping and I say that when they launched they said, ""tip is included"" has responded with, ""that's stupid"" and tipped anyway.   Signing up as a rider, I have never once seen anything about ""tip is included"" but I know they said it at one point. It pisses me off when a pax goes to tip and their friend actively stops them and says, ""don't tip, it's uber"". Well Fuck You. It's not your money and the actual rider, not the tag along, wanted to show appreciation.  I keep change to break larger bills and a card reader in my car for those without cash. I get tips about 10-20% of the time. It's always appreciated."

From personal experience, in a one on one meeting with an uber manager, I learned they can do anything to the customer's account, but not your rating. They will make notes on the customer, put the customer on probation, or can deactivate the customer.  But everybody I've ever talked to said there is absolutely nothing that can be done about a bad rating.  I've learned to live with it. I have also found that if you get dozens of 5 ratings in a row, and one night tiy get a 1, it's not really going to affect you.  So I've learned not sweat it.  In your situation you could have called the police. I picked up the phone to do that and the drunk assholes who couldn't move a second ago sprinted out of the car and around the corner."

uberdrivers,3d21by,RokBo67,2,Sun Jul 12 22:57:28 2015 UTC,When I started I got my $100 for ten rides on my first check. Is this a different process?
uberdrivers,3d21by,kurokeh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"When I started there was some  10 trip, 100 dollar bonus thing. My first night out I completed 9 trips and had two cancels. I was pretty busy for a couple of weeks, so I didn't sign on. Didn't get a bonus at that point. (neither one of the cancels were no shows, they cancelled within a few seconds of acceptance).  After the two weeks I took like 2 more trips on Uber (and a bunch with Lyft since they had a much better sign-on bonus but it was time-limited) and I got the 100 bucks.   tl:dr, cancels don't seem to count toward your trip totals for bonuses."
uberdrivers,3czizi,UberMCO,10,Sun Jul 12 05:05:47 2015 UTC,I do the same thing.  I drive only when I am bored or just want to save a bit of money.  I play a game that goes like this.    I want in and out burger start driving to in and out burger with both Lyft and Uber on.    If I get a fare I go do it and then continue to drive to same in and out burger I was driving to no matter where I am after the fare.    I continue to do this until I get in the parking lot my day is over and I enjoy my food.    Most of the time my food is paid for by my fares.
uberdrivers,3czizi,bing281,4,Sun Jul 12 07:26:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly this with exactly In N Out.  2 HAMburgers with extra veggies + water, thanks no fries today.  Your total today comes to 2 minimum fares, second window please."
uberdrivers,3czizi,springbreakbox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:01:15 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I do now. I don't strictly need the money it's just fun for me.   Usually it's because I need to go to a store across town or something. I'll leave the app running on my way and hopefully pick up a fare on the way there. Then I do the same hoping I get a fare on the way home. Then I can with good conscience write off my miles that I was theoretically using for personal business!
uberdrivers,3czizi,Tumeric98,3,Sun Jul 12 07:32:24 2015 UTC,"This describes me.  I did it from April-December of last year, and stopped driving when it stopped being fun.  Granted, part of the fun was seeing how much I could earn in a given day or on a given trip, but the pay at the time was far above what I would have been willing to drive for.  I loved the social interaction...mostly.  After about 1 AM it became a crapshoot if the next group of riders would be fun drunks or just plan hassles.  When more and more people started driving, I would spend most of the night waiting for fares (maybe getting one every 75 minutes or so) and would have to wait until 1 AM to see any real business.  So in conclusion, driving, say, 10 trips over 6 hours and having 1 of them be bad was fun, but driving 4 trips in 6 hours and having 1 of those be bad was not worth it for me.  Driving people around was fun, waiting forever to get a ride request was not."
uberdrivers,3czizi,SOGorman35,2,Mon Jul 13 00:04:40 2015 UTC,"I like the money and it's my main motivator. But I would honestly rather drive than sit at home watching Netflix after the fam is in bed. I'm the kind of guy who would just go on random, aimless drives anyway when I was bored. Now those aimless drives are free and I get paid for them and get to see a bit of the night life I don't go out to."
uberdrivers,3czizi,eyemadeanaccount,2,Sun Jul 12 17:33:56 2015 UTC,Yep
uberdrivers,3czizi,pr0tosynnerg,3,Sun Jul 12 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"I would say ""fun"" is the main motivator, as the money's never been great. 4/5th of the time, I go online just because I've got the extra time and want a couple bucks.   For example in Portland, I was waiting for a friend to be out of work, so I signed on, picked up two riders on a Friday afternoon in about a hour and a half span. Both nice, fun rides, signed off and started my weekend. However, once I got paid, I saw Uber gave me 9.74, far less than any guarantee. Still, I enjoyed doing the rides, so who cares?   It's almost as though the driving itself was fine, but getting paid was the insulting part."
uberdrivers,3czizi,VanceFerguson,2,Sun Jul 12 11:08:49 2015 UTC,That last sentence is spot on.
uberdrivers,3czizi,baconlion,4,Sun Jul 12 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"I have to admit,  while I was a cab driver (now retired), I do miss the interaction between people who I normally wouldn't meet.   Would I do it for fun? Not a chance, but then again,  and I mean no insult to anyone on here,  I don't have the anxieties that sine of you guys have.   In fact.

uberdrivers,3czizi,iwreckshop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm depending on Uber Select while I'm between jobs but I totally agree. If money did not exist in this world, I'd still drive uber and lyft just for the social interaction. I'm pretty introverted but I enjoy chatting with  all walks of life, and there's much less pressure than just talking to random people at a bar or at the store.  UberX is not profitable unless you're driving a prius, but uber select makes it a little more worth it.  I relate it to the single serving friends described in Fight Club. This interaction helps me to be comfortable with holding conversations with complete strangers while I go from interview to interview, and occasionally pays for my drive home after one.  TL;DR: I love meeting people, but I rarely want to see them again."

uberdrivers,3d09d3,LegoMovieExtra,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was trying not to cancel as I was working on the guaranteed rate which requires 90% acceptance.  I'm lucky if I swing 6-8 so cancelling one screws me all the way around."

Also, don't start the fare until you make physical contact. If they come out and say they're paying their tab or they're waiting for someone else, then start it. But don't start it when you get there and they might not even be there."

I'm in Australia.  I told him it would be at least a month before I could get there :)  Weird thing was when I checked London time after it was 10am Sat morning (I was expecting 3am), though subsequently I have been reliably informed that in London peeps can often heading home after a big Fri night out at 10am heheh.

Whatever, one more.  He calls me on my way to the pin, asks if I can pick him up where he's at. ""Yup, I'm headed straight to the GPS location you put in, I'll be there in 5.""  I get there, super shady dead end road with a junkyard across the street. Oh great, this is some kind of a setup. I position the car to make a quick exit and call the guy. He says he's on the curb, there are no curbs on this street. I ask him for land marks, gas station, 7-11, etc. Things around me, thinking he may have just dropped the pin a block or so off. Nothing. He gives me cross streets, GPS says 10 minutes away. I already drove 10 to the first pin.   Guy sounds desperate and I know from the rider app, there are zero available cars, everyone is in for the night, it's 1:45 on a Tuesday. I figure I'll throw the guy a bone and head over there.  I get there, sure enough, on the curb. Guy looks like a frat boy that graduated 20 years ago, but never left the frat. He gets in the front seat, well falls in the front seat. He had already put in the destination, cool. He apologized and tells me to take him to a supermarket parking lot and proceeds to say how he got drunk after a really shitty day and hates his life. I ask if I should take him to the GPS location. No, the parking lot. I figure he has his car there and was gonna sleep it off there or was meeting someone. Get there, nada. ""Dude, can you take me five miles from here?"" Ya where? ""The GPS location"" ok. The entire drive, the guy is falling on me on every turn and waking up after each time and apologizing. He declines water and mints, I'm thinking he's gonna puke. Finally get him home, he stumbles out, gives me a $20 and says thanks for putting up with his shit and saving his night. $25 fare too.   Guy went from a 2 star rating to a 4 star rating with that tip."

uberdrivers,3d07na,LegoMovieExtra,3,Mon Jul 13 04:30:31 2015 UTC,The only reason I'm opposed to other drivers offering water and mints is because it conditions passengers to expect it.

uberdrivers,3czrxi,uberotown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:36:43 2015 UTC,"The Orlando VFH division has done stings every single week since Uber started last year.  I mean, you have an entire small department whose sole purpose is to give out tickets to illegal taxis, and you have a service that literally brings those ""illegal taxis"" to their front door.  They don't do it every day, but it happens the most near the Airport on Semoran by the hotels, on I-Drive northof Kirkman, downtown by Lynx, and by ORMC.  Usually a place where they have enough room for the tow truck and can pull you over and search your car without causing a traffic backup."

uberdrivers,3cxann,jjs2424,2,Sun Jul 12 17:16:42 2015 UTC,I don't know what you've been told or by whom.  The reality is that neither you nor I know how the surge algorithm works.  What I can say is that there have been plenty of times I've seen no cars available and no surge.  And plenty of surges with plenty of cars.
uberdrivers,3cxann,BigBaldZ,6,Sun Jul 12 18:43:48 2015 UTC,Uber is dead. It's a minimum wage job now at most. I was a top 10% driver and now I can't even get fairs. Uber is dead for drivers. At least ones that like to eat.

uberdrivers,3cxann,jjs2424,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"Given Uber's stated rationale, surges reduce demand to maximize the number of riders who want a ride able to get one.  Think about it.  If people aren't desperate they'll wait out a surge, resulting in you sitting in the middle of a surge area but not getting any calls."
uberdrivers,3cxann,Sirefly,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"This happened in Tucson once on a Saturday.   The previous 3 weeks had seen predictable surges on and off all night on Saturdays. That Saturday had none.  Cars would pop up and disappear in seconds, then ""No UberX Available"".  Riders were complaining about having difficulty getting rides. One group said every time a car popped up all four of them were tapping their apps trying to get it and it still took 30 minutes for them to get a car.  Lyft was up to 200% Primetime in the same area.  It just goes to show you that Surge pricing really works to bring down demand and keep cars available.  BTW, the glitch happened right after a Partner app push update."

uberdrivers,3cxlzp,scottevil110,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's like rent to own places. You get the great deal of that new 65"" Smart TV (retail of $1,500), for the low price of $20/wk. Well for that to be paid off, you have to pay that for 5 years. By the time you've paid it off, you've paid $4,800. The terms were laid out for you up front. $20/wk for 5 years, but you just paid the cost of 3 tvs instead out the one. This is predatory and the same type of deal that the car is through those types of programs."

uberdrivers,3cxlzp,iiznoodles,2,Sun Jul 12 00:35:32 2015 UTC,Well the other option is if you are in the market for a new car and a Prius fits what you want to get and have decent credit you can get a loan payment of ~$250-300 (that's what I'm guessing a 60 month loan would run).  Or you could do 36 month and be around 500-600. And then it's your car and you can do with it what you like.

uberdrivers,3czrm4,Evaunit01berser,0,Sun Jul 12 07:22:33 2015 UTC,Take a look at my edit and then judge me
uberdrivers,3czrm4,eyemadeanaccount,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:00:51 2015 UTC,Dude here is your main problem:   Telling them you want their code when you don't is lying if you want to start out a conversation with someone by lying to them you need to turn the table and think how you would think if this happened to you. I can't imagine you are going to find many people that drive for Uber that don't know about Lyft.   You are still wasting the time of someone that is working.  And you are using a system meant for drivers and passengers to communicate if there are issues in order to try and sell them something.  This is exactly like me friending you on Facebook then messaging you and your friends to sell you things.  I don't think you would like it and neither will the people you call after getting their work numbers without even taking a ride with them.     Listen man you need to do this in a different way here are some other ideas that are not so bad   Get a billboard share your code on billboard for riders  Get a Craigslist for your driver code Know how to drive and teach a free class on the ins and outs of Uber and Lyft and sign people up at your class    All if these do not have you calling someone while they are working.    Just try to think of how you would feel if someone did what you are proposing to you.
uberdrivers,3czrm4,eyemadeanaccount,0,Tue Jul 14 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"This is the most appropriate response yet and it completely exposed the moral consequences of this technique. You are completely right about the immorality of wasting another's time but I have had an extremely poor experience using the other methods you described. With all the flyers and business cards carrying my promo codes that I have posted at events, train stations, bus stops, college bulletin boards, etc I feel that Lyft and Uber are cheating me by not giving me credit for users entering my code entered at the bottom in multiples like this:  https://www.google.com/search?q=flyers&espv=2&biw=911&bih=429&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMIlOi0h-3ZxgIViA-SCh1JMwxw#tbm=isch&q=college+flyers&imgrc=Q1ngSuDO7QGv3M%3A  I have gone back the next day and seen ppl tearing off 3/4ths of these flyers and I have received no credit. I have even seen friends type in my promo codes and they have not worked at all. I feel like the whole system is fucked up and I resent lyft and uber for encouraging me to spend so much time for nothing"
uberdrivers,3czrm4,bing281,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:11:48 2015 UTC,Nowadays the promo codes for riders are only for people who are making brand new accounts they don't work at all for people that already have accounts on top of that they need to take a ride for you to get paid.  I give out my code and have had 20 people punch it in and 11 actually take a ride giving me a total of $110.    For the driver codes I can personally fell you getting 50 rides in 30 days on lift is hard you would have to be driving 20+ hours a week to do this.  On a given day if I drive strictly for Lyft I tend to do 5 rides before I just don't care anymore.  That is 10 days of driving for Lyft to make 50 rides it just isn't going to happen.    Also it probably works like they sign up and need to get a mentor ride and background check that takes like a week so really there is one week gone now they have 3 weeks to do 50 rides good luck.
uberdrivers,3czrm4,bing281,0,Tue Jul 14 05:29:19 2015 UTC,"And obviously I'm not assuming they don't know about lyft, I'm simply trying to attract them with a $500 bonus for doing 50 rides in 30 days"

Check the declaration page,  if you not listed you may have to change the insurance to get you listed on the policy.  Any other questions I can help with?"

uberdrivers,3cvabe,Uberdriverphilly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"Why not tell them?   So when you get in an accident while driving Uber, if they weren't going to cover you before, they sure won't then. They will drop you and you just got into an accident with no insurance, get sued, have a ticket, a judgement to lose your license, and then when you get it back have to file a SR22 for a few years? Ya, that's a good plan!   If they have a problem covering you for the fact you drive Uber, you need new insurance. If they have an rideshare option, get it. If they'll cover you already (state farm), awesome, but if they aren't going to cover you, why would you want to stay with them and roll the dice hoping you will never have an accident while driving Uber? If you do and your company isn't going to cover you , you're fucked. It's best to make sure you're covered, and get covered if not.  To answer your question though, your name would be on the binder page or the renewal bill they send every 6 months. It will list everyone who is covered. This is the proof you will need to upload."

uberdrivers,3cv0qb,DJMikeyB,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:28:36 2015 UTC,"Keeping one phone data dedicated for Uber/Lyft is ideal. The second phone for making calls/texts whatever else you want to do, knowing you'll never interfere with an order coming in.  I'm all about the contract-fee startups. FreedomPop 500MB is OK if that's all the data you use, but it's not enough for my usage. Another I think has some good plans is RingPlus. And Cricket on AT&T at $35 per month or less is pretty darn good, too. Also check out Consumer Cellular.  But my personal favorite is Ting. You don't select a pre-fixed plan, it is flexible, meaning if you have low usage you pay low, high usage you pay no more than others. Overall it averages out way lower than when you settle on a fixed amount of usage you project you'll need based on a maximum. With Ting, you never pay for data/minutes/messages you don't use!  Ting also allows access to T-Mobile (GSM) or Sprint. Both work well enough while driving. It's nice to have a choice, since these are the two spottiest networks, but I also make sure one phone is T-Mobile and one is Sprint so I can have backup if one network craps out.  Finally, and this is pretty huge, when you call Ting a friendly Canadian answers the phone. No phone tree, usually no hold. If they're busy they'll call you back."

One thing uber and the riders don't want drivers to do is cancel trips based on the distance and location of drop offs. One I do is text the rider this. (Hi, this is your driver, Peq17. Please confirm your location. Thanks!) If I get no response then I go to the location provided on the app. If I do get a confirmation or address update then I change accordingly and respond with. (Great! I'll be there shortly. If you haven't already done so please enter the drop-off location in the app. See you soon!) Both are macros on my keyboard so I can quickly plug them in or use voice commands to input them. I use tasker for that."
uberdrivers,3ctacf,Peq17,3,Fri Jul 10 17:15:51 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right! Having the auto-correct on the keyboard is awesome for that!

The acknowledgement now a part of the app is meant to clarify what is covered, however. Liability to others is covered at all times.  If you want collision coverage during Phase 1 (for incidents that would be your fault while you're online but without a ride request) Farmers and USAA offer special riders atop your personal insurance (which obviously must be through them.) The cost will vary from a few dollars extra a month to perhaps much more. You can get a quote from either (USAA requires a military relationship.)"

uberdrivers,3ckcxm,Sirefly,2,Sat Jul 11 07:13:09 2015 UTC,Why even have a minimum? This was less than a quarter of a mile and it was 95 cents over the minimum. It's almost impossible to have a fair under $2. It would literally have to be 200 hundred feet down the road.
uberdrivers,3ckcxm,ttownfeen,2,Thu Jul 9 00:44:54 2015 UTC,I don't know.  Even waiting 1 minute without moving would take it over the $2 mark.

uberdrivers,3ckcxm,fuckafuck,0,Wed Jul 8 20:24:51 2015 UTC,I do hope you rated appropriately. 2 star? 1 star?  Low rating is the only tool we have to warn others of customers like this.
uberdrivers,3ckcxm,UnCounted36244,2,Thu Jul 9 11:18:44 2015 UTC,"But why are you blaming the customer? How would she know how far you traveled to pick her up? The Uber system sets the cost including the minimum. It doesn't say no trips shorter than five blocks, etc. You agreed to play by these rules and now you're arbitrarily ""downvoting"" a customer who also plays by the rules?"
uberdrivers,3ckcxm,pleasejason,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"And there's nothing to say this customer won't want to go on a long trip some time in the future.

It might be a blunt instrument, and not incredibly useful, and I probably wouldn't use it....but it's literally the only tool available, of that much he's absolutely correct.  What else can you possibly do?"
uberdrivers,3cjr9l,ness839,10,Wed Jul 8 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"If it's a very long ride, you have a right to reject it and ask them to re-request.  It happens all the time.  Some passengers don't realize that a longer trip is anything different than a shorter one.  No reason to get upset with the requester, just cancel.  No harm, no foul."
uberdrivers,3cjr9l,uberotown,5,Wed Jul 8 13:48:33 2015 UTC,I think I was having a hard time because the actual pax wasn't the requester. He didn't seem to really know what was going on (apparently he was on vacation and had to be transported to the hospital near me) and dumping him back out on the street seemed harsh.   Then the dollar signs clicked in and I decided to do it...it was the dead time coming back that alone that bothered me most.

uberdrivers,3cjr9l,kvakvs,3,Wed Jul 8 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for asking. Uber will allow us to adjust the fare down, but not up.  You are always welcome to tip, just not in the app, and can certainly offer to compensate for all or part of the dead head. If you don't have cash, many drivers have Square readers, or you can PayPal or Venmo the extra payment.  You should mention the destination before the driver starts the trip because it is easier to cancel a trip that hasn't started. Some drivers simply can't be gone for, say, 4 hours, and even if you've put the destination in the app we don't see it until we start the trip.   NYC cab drivers going to CT, for example, charge 2x the meter. I think many Uber drivers would be very happy with a 50% bonus on top of the fare. I think it will make for a smooth trip if you discuss the destination and payment when you first meet your driver.  Again, thanks for thinking about the extra time and expense the driver incurs."
uberdrivers,3cjr9l,NotAModBro,3,Thu Jul 9 01:00:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely you had right to cancel, but money is money.  You probably earned handsome $ on that ride."
uberdrivers,3cjr9l,Mines_of_Moria,3,Wed Jul 8 14:15:32 2015 UTC,I guess the issue is that my return trip was basically dead time. If I think about it one-way it wasn't too bad...but I had to make the trip again for free. It's hard to decide if I struck the right balance or not. It was a $130 fare which is not bad for a weekday afternoon.

uberdrivers,3ck5xj,Uberdriverphilly,2,Wed Jul 8 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"No business licence required. those are your 2 options for coverage in CA at this time.  It's a good idea to do it as you will not have to worry about coverage.  and for the small increase in costs I think it's a prudent move.  But it is not required.  you just risk not getting your own car repairs covered in the event of an accident.  Liabilty wise you are covered at all times now but your own collision is what the extra insurance would cover you.  The training is just a video, they will send you a link.  should have already got that??   it's a nice idea many driver start with but they soon realize the money that are making does not justify the expense.  a majority of customers do not expect anything more than a ride.  It's just nice to have some water if they really need it.  Kleenex is good also for the ladies.  big thing is to always confirm your passenger.  nothing will get you a 1 star quicker than picking up the wrong passenger.  never give your name out in the confirmation process.  always make them say their name to confirm it matches the name on your screen."
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,walkersm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:58:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, to clarify question 1. As far as I'm concerned, it largely depends on the city you live in. In Los Angeles, if you file your income taxes that have any business deductions or forms (Schedule C, etc.), they will often find you and charge you for a business tax if you don't have a business license in the city. That's what happened to me for an unrelated business and I had to go to City Hall and fight the bill. Eventually I had to register my business to the city.  Again, it largely depends on which city you live in. Most cities do require a business license, but many cities don't have the resources to find you like Los Angeles. Remember this before you file your taxes next year."
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,strictmachines,2,Sun Jul 12 18:05:53 2015 UTC,Yes very true.  Many cites require any contractor doing business in the city to get that cities business licence.  Hard to enforce with transportation companies but the limo companies have had to get an LA city licence if they wanted to do business at LAX. Even though their business may be based in Pasadena.   If they really wanted to enforce it it would be a mess having tho get a city business licence for every city in La county where you waned to pick up passengers.    Since not a lot of profit is being made wont really be a tax windfall for the cited to go after it.
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,walkersm,2,Mon Jul 13 09:24:48 2015 UTC,"California Farmers Insurance Agent here! Yes we will cover you for all of your ridesharing needs. Here is a memo that was sent to all the agents regarding our new endorsement:  Rideshare providers like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar have gained in popularity in dozens of U.S. cities over the past few years. Unlike taxis or limousines, rideshare drivers use their own personal vehicles to transport riders. Rideshare companies typically provide some level of insurance coverage during the time a driver has accepted a trip from the app until the driver has dropped the passenger off. This leaves the driver on the hook for insurance when the app is on and the driver is seeking riders - referred to as Period 1 in the rideshare business.  Starting July 1, 2015 rideshare drivers are legally required to be covered from the moment they turn on their app. And on May 28, 2015, Farmers will be the first major carrier in California to begin offering a new Rideshare Endorsement through Farmers Specialty Insurance Company.  With this endorsement, rideshare drivers can avoid a potential gap in coverage by extending their personal auto policy coverage when they are logged in and waiting for the next ride. This new offering is not specific to a rideshare company - the endorsement can be purchased by drivers that belong to any rideshare company.   The additional coverage provided by this endorsement will add, on average, 8 percent to a customer’s premium or about $6 to $8 per month.   In order to qualify for this endorsement and meet legal requirements, the underlying Farmers Specialty auto policy must have Bodily Injury (BI) limits of at least $50,000 per person/$100,000 per accident and Property Damage (PD) limits of $50,000.   Unless specifically added with this new endorsement, the Farmers Specialty/Farmers Auto/Bristol West policy excludes rideshare activity.   For current Farmers Auto/Bristol West policyholders, adding the endorsement will require the rideshare vehicle to be re-written into Farmers Specialty Insurance Company  Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions."
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,BAinBS,-2,Wed Jul 8 18:54:44 2015 UTC,No insurance will cover you for Uber. Its up to Uber to cover you. So it doesn't matter what kind of insurance you have.
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,NotAModBro,3,Wed Jul 8 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"That is not a useful reply and one that may leave people with a mistaken impression.  The vast majority of personal policies have language that will allow the insurer to deny coverage if you are engaged in TNC (it's not ridesharing, so let's stop calling it that) activity.  This means that if you are online, but have not yet accepted a request, you have no collision, comprehensive, or medical coverage UNLESS you have a policy that explicitly deals with Uber, Lyft, etc.  You will have some ($50k, I believe) liability coverage.    This may or may not be likely to happen, but most personal policies allow the insurer to completely invalidate your policy if you use the vehicle for commercial purposes at any time during the policy period.  Short answer: if you can get a policy that explicitly permits Uber as an acceptable use, go for it.  If you can get one that provides coverage during the ""gap"" between going online and getting a request, you'd be foolish not to get that coverage."

uberdrivers,3ck5xj,NotAModBro,2,Wed Jul 8 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"On the off-chance that you're not simply trolling:  When you are on an active trip, Uber/Lyft insurance takes over.  If you want comprehensive and collision while on a trip, you must have a personal policy.  If you are online, but not on a trip the following insurers (and maybe others) offer coverage in some states, but not others:   Farmer's (CA, AR) USAA (CO, TX, WA) GEICO (VA, MD, TX, And GA) Metromile (CA, WA) Progressive (PA, ?)   USAA is the only carrier I am aware of that explicitly permits TNC driving as an acceptable personal use under a standard policy (you still need to purchase a special policy for full coverage, though).  That means that USAA is on record that they will not drop customers or deny unrelated claims because they are using their cars (partially) for TNC purposes."
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,jjs2424,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"My original comment said no insurance covers you, Uber would take over, as I said, and you have now said."
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,NotAModBro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"You also said it doesn't matter which insurer he uses.  Choosing the wrong policy could have disastrous consequences.  I assume you have comprehensive and collision coverage.    Whether you have that coverage during the period when you're online but in between fares depends entirely on which personal policy you have in place.  In CA the law now forbids insurers from paying claims during this period unless the policy specifically authorizes it.  The other thing you seem to fail to understand is that doing Uber can also cause your personal policy to be invalidated.  That means you drive your car around for personal use, you get into an accident, and the insurer has the right to tell you to get stuffed because you did Uber dRiving in the last six months (or whatever the policy term is"
uberdrivers,3ck5xj,jjs2424,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:26:02 2015 UTC,There are a few or maybe one company that insures drivers in california specifically for ridesharing. I believe it's farmer's.

The victim is Uber, and they would sue the hell out of anyone caught steeling an UberAuto (that's my guess for the name).

uberdrivers,3cgifg,jjs2424,5,Tue Jul 7 22:19:33 2015 UTC,"Precisely.  I agree with the courts that the employee/contractor argument doesn't have a clean answer, but it certainly seems that the right thing would be for worker's compensation or a similar system to apply here."
uberdrivers,3cgifg,supermegafauna,3,Tue Jul 7 23:47:53 2015 UTC,Which begs the questions why Uber fights so very hard to have IC classification.

uberdrivers,3cgifg,MisterUber,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:01:56 2015 UTC,The driver is hosed unless he/she can recover from the other party. If the other driver is uninsured Uber does have UI/UIM coverage for the driver   You wrote two contradictory things. UI/UIM is for when one party cannot recover from the other party or the other party's insurance company.
uberdrivers,3cgifg,jjs2424,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:03:56 2015 UTC,Edited original comment to clarify.
uberdrivers,3cgifg,MisterUber,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"It varies state by state because some states have more stringent requirements. For example in Virginia the minimum insurance requirements are higher than in Delaware. (https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2015/sb1025/fulltext/) But the national minimum coverage Uber extends to drivers is $1M 3rd party & $1M uninsured/underinsured coverage (https://www.uber.com/driver-jobs). This means that if the 19 year old mentioned in this article has no insurance, or let's say $50k worth of 3rd party insurance, and the injuries the Uber driver sustains require $250k worth of medical treatment, Uber's insurance pays the amount the 19 year old's insurance doesn't up to $1M."
uberdrivers,3cgifg,RutD0g,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"Uber extends to drivers is $1M 3rd party & $1M uninsured/underinsured coverage    To clarify, this is either/or, for a total of total $1M per incident regardless of the number of victims.  In cases where the Uber driver is at fault (unlike this accident) there is $1M total incident coverage for everyone but the driver. So if there are three victims, that's only $333,000 each. The driver's car is covered after $1,000 deductible, but no coverage for the driver's medical, lost wages, rehabilitation, etc.  The Uber driver is covered only when the other driver is at fault and is unable to pay, either because they are uninsured or underinsured (don't have enough to compensate you). But again this coverage is for all victims up to $1M total for the incident (same math as above).  Most likely, the BMW has good insurance, and will pay for all of this, as well as the driver being sentenced.   But drivers need to know that injuries they sustain while driving are not usually covered by Uber's insurance. This is the heart of u/BigBitFan's question."

I've been monitoring the rider app and seen cars pop up during a busy period, and then the estimate will say ""no UberX available"" so the cars have accepted rides, but the cars will still be on the screen for a few minutes.   So sometimes there is a lag in the app updating the car sprites.  You might want to close the app and open it again to see if they're still there or maybe check two different phones to see if they both show the same phantom cars.

I keep one behind each of the two front seats, one in the door compartment of the passenger front seat, and one with me just in case a rider is too drunk to grab one by themselves.

I explain that the ride will proceed more smoothly if I can enter an address.  He gives me the street name only.  I explain that the GPS may take me to the wrong end of the street; he says that's ok he'll give directions.  You can guess where this is headed - everyone in the back is being loud n obnoxious; he is so pissed he forgets to give me directions and the GPS takes me to the wrong end of his street, which is long enough to be a few blocks away from his place.  He then blames me for the mistake; gets pissed off when I ignore his instructions to head the wrong way down a one way street then make an illegal U-turn in a dangerous spot and complains bitterly about how much the detour is costing him (I calc'd it later at $1-2).  All the while his mates in the back are egging him on re the injustice of how I'm ""fuckin ripping him off"".  Eventually drop them off to an abusive final round of parting shots and door slamming.

Only Uber knows for sure, and since they don't record ethnicity data, this can only be approximated crudely by looking at names.  I think the early demographic of the uber driver was the nerdier tablet wielder (not necessarily white.) It seems like in any given city, there is still a number of ""pioneer drivers"" who may fit this description and are very part time, holiday and likely surge drivers. This was due mostly to information asymmetry than anything else.   Of course word has spread in two years - some obvious (like radio ads and Craigslist) and some less so (some other Denver drivers tell me that the Indonesian community, for example, has embraced Lyft.) Plus, it's a no brainer that a full-time taxi driver would ditch weekly leasing a cab in most cities in favor of a late-model Prius, Camry, etc. that they can own (This is the demographic that Uber attempted to latch with their horrible subprime leases.)  I can't speak to everywhere, but in Denver, Austin, and NJ/NYC, places I've been a passenger a lot, the great majority of my drivers over the last 24 months have been new Americans, immigrants from all over.

That being said, I'm about to enter the nursing program at my school so the flexibility thing is making me want to continue.. I don't think I will though.

uberdrivers,3c3aag,guber8,4,Sat Jul 4 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"1:45 AM in the crazy bar district.   I sized them up, they seemed coherent and friendly, including her. She was walking, smiled, responded immediately when I first saw them with a friendly smile and she buckled up in seconds -- usually a good sign.  One block down the road, no turns, and she starts regurgitating onto herself. I pulled over and told her friends to get her out of the car. She was out cold!   So the best they could do was lean her out the door but they were afraid she was going to fall on the street. That's how the vomit got all over the door.  Her friends were so embarrassed. They were very polite, and they kept apologizing.   I stopped by a gas station right by my house with really good vacuums. It did a nice job of extracting liquid from the door upholstery. Then I went home, changed,  and sprayed it down with disinfectant pet stain cleaner. Then back to the gas station for extraction of the cleaner.  It's been 12 hours and I haven't heard back from Uber. No surprise there.   And I have to admit I was cracking up while I was just typing the narrative of the whole thing. And it helps greatly  that the passengers were respectful, apologetic, and as bothered by it as I was.   Now that it is all cleaned up I'm almost ready to shrug it off. As long as I get paid well. ;)  I'm confident I'll get a decent fee and the car is just fine."

uberdrivers,3bwjcr,TheManDapperDan,2,Thu Jul 2 20:29:03 2015 UTC,On iOS you would have to open the Waze app and re type the passenger's address.

uberdrivers,3btqw1,rnbwpnt,3,Thu Jul 2 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"Still no personal injury protection or medical, though.   Every driver needs to understand this: if you as the driver are ruled at fault  the $1,000,000 gets shared between all the victims, but not the driver. If you are left in a wheel chair for life, you receive $0.  That's because you don't have personal injury protection or medical coverage from Uber."
uberdrivers,3btqw1,RutD0g,0,Thu Jul 2 07:03:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The only coverage for that you'd have is if your policy covered you or if the other driver was at fault, then theirs would cover you IF they were insured.  This is more like a, ""at least you won't get sued"" policy."
uberdrivers,3btqw1,benk016,0,Thu Jul 2 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"Update: I just called my insurance agent to clarify this.

Those are you still active regardless of driving Uber or not. The only thing that stops being effective is liability coverage.""  So ya, State Farm ftw. I called to add on the rideshare addendum. They said they didn't have one and this is why. They already provide the coverage."

uberdrivers,3bu4sc,goeatsomesoup,9,Thu Jul 2 04:16:18 2015 UTC,Well now you have to get additional insurance on your own in California.  It's hard to be supplemental now with so many drivers..  The costs to operate are high with the rates its kind of not worth it if you're doing it part time.. Even worse if your doing it full time.. Market is too saturated to make any money
uberdrivers,3bu4sc,techpenguin16,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:32:13 2015 UTC,since when do you need additional insurance?
uberdrivers,3bu4sc,logarath,2,Thu Jul 2 07:10:52 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily need additional insurance, but you need to make sure your insurance company will at last provide you with PiP, collision, and comp while driving for Uber. Some won't cover you at all and cancel your policy, some already cover it, and some you have to buy additional protection to extend that coverage when driving. Check with your agent. I've heard geico cancels you, farmers has additional coverage to buy, and know that state farm already covers you. Metro mile is an option as well."
uberdrivers,3bu4sc,eyemadeanaccount,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:34:22 2015 UTC,So this is the tricky part on the new law that was passed. Uber supposedly covers you from the time you logon to the time you log off. NOT THE CASE. On paper they do. Your Insurance company will still drop you if you are found to be driving for uber or Lyft.  So now they have an endorsement which is just additional coverage that doesn't add anything to your policy but that only says the insurance company will not drop your coverage if you have an accident. But they don't cover you for ride share activities.  The moment you file a claim they still force you to go through your insurance first. Get denied. Then file with their insurance co. which you have no contact with and you have to communicate through uber's email...  So because of this stupid law that did nothing to protect drivers you will have to pay commercial rates for personal insurance that doesn't add any additional protections aside from not getting your coverage dropped..

I work a full time job and I drive for Uber for the extra bucks so I can pay off my roommate for covering the rent for three months. I use the rest as pocket money or to pay towards a bill.   Working for Uber is straight forward. You are your own boss and if you have any issues you can email them for assistance. Be nice to your passengers, keep a clean good smelling car, and don't look like you are seeping in smegma, raw ass juice, and Halitosis.   Passengers will not give you 5 stars all the time and some days you may not make as much as the others, but once you know your area you can work towards your goal."

uberdrivers,3bu4sc,Smart_Dumb,3,Thu Jul 2 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to lie. The definition of 'life changing money' is vague. Is it going to get you $60,000/year solely from driving Uber? No. But in all honesty, having ""fun/extra cash"" for a change IS pretty life-changing, especially considering it's coming from something as relatively easy and brainless as driving my car around while following a GPS."

Uber is a bit easier than working at mcdonalds though. You can drive around, meet people, explore your city/area, listen to music/audiobooks and choose your own hours.

However, in my market, my name didn't need to be on the actual card (it isn't), I just had to send Uber the actual policy (which included my name as the primary driver of the vehicle) and I was quickly approved.     I wish there was more standardization between markets...  I will say this though... If I had been in benk016's exact situation, I would have forged an insurance card with my name on it, without even blinking an eye, and I'd say you'd have about a 99% chance of being approved.  I would only do it in the case that I WAS ACTUALLY LEGALLY INSURED.  No chance that I would give up on being an Uber driver because of illogical semantics... nor would I be interested in begging my insurance company to make a special card for me.  Copy...Paste...Upload...Drive."

uberdrivers,3bq8u5,donutgabe,3,Wed Jul 1 13:18:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on your area, but generally its just a slight upturn.

Uber wasn't advertising as hard for drivers last year (at least in my market).  And you got the huge reserve pool of inactive/semi-active/part-time drivers.

Or, at least, the ones that don't do it full-time. Strictly speaking, Uber is ride-sharing, not a taxi service (Not that I agree, but that's beside the point).   ...but as a reflection on their training.   What training?   Please fix this immediately.   What exactly do you expect random uber drivers on reddit to do here?  Look, I get that you want to be left alone, and I'm sorry you got some overly chatty drivers. That's what the rating system is for. I wouldn't have given them a five, but nor would I have gone with something harsh (lower than a three). If you feel a driver is unsafe, won't leave you alone, your rating should reflect that. We, as drivers, are doing our best to be friendly and courteous in order to get a five-star rating. Personally, I always gauge whether my passengers want to talk and act accordingly, but I find that the majority want to talk. It wouldn't surprise me if other drivers picked up on that and just talked to everyone, because that works for most people."

It is at capacity no new cars may register and my other friends that do do this. Get 1/ride /2 hours of waiting.  Steps to start.  Pay the PUC for your TCP license. (Car has to be registered commercial to begin)  Wait the time to receive paper work Perform the drug test for PUC.  Show uber all these papers. Then show these papers to the airport.

It is not available in Dallas and when I inquired at the office they indicated that it most likely will never open up again.  The reason is mostly that they know that all service levels will be cleared to pick up at DFW airport soon, which is the only real advantage to using Black.  Most people will take X or XL and people who want luxury will take Select.  Apparently Select has already taken a large chunk of the Black business."

I guess I will try to talk to some black suv drivers out here to see what the demand is like, as it probably varies by city, but with 1 ride every 2 hours, that seems like it may not be worth it.   In regards to the money split and gas situation, I thought that driver paying for gas and splitting 50/50 was a pretty standard thing, am I wrong in thinking that?   Lastly, has anyone heard of, or know about, black drivers basically soliciting their personal driving for someone? Like a private driver situation? Is that frowned upon, or somewhat common?"

However in many (maybe even most) locations Uber barely pays minimum wage. And when you consider the costs to their vehicle and gas it is not that easy to make a living with Uber.  So you should always tip your driver unless they are assholes.

uberdrivers,3bj2ru,RutD0g,7,Mon Jun 29 21:40:06 2015 UTC,"Because everyone knows to tip taxi drivers, while Uber tells customers not to."
uberdrivers,3bj2ru,RutD0g,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:57:03 2015 UTC,And the customers don't have enough sense to turn around and ask...   If you tip the taxi driver why wouldn't you tip your uber driver?   OP is asking!
uberdrivers,3bj2ru,manbergur,2,Tue Jun 30 02:05:53 2015 UTC,"I think you quoted the wrong person. In any sense, in my experience, a lot of people do ask, and when I tell them tipping is allowed they act surprised because they were under the impression (because Uber told them) they're not supposed to tip.   I've had customers who pulled out money to tip me and then their friend says ""don't tip. It's already included.""   What am I supposed to do, correct them? ""No please tip me!"""
uberdrivers,3bj2ru,RutD0g,2,Tue Jun 30 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"Correct quote, meant for it to be read it inline as one sentence with my words. Basically, you say the customers listen to Uber, and I say they have enough sense to ask the right questions.  And yes, I do think we need to correct our customers. This is full of potential pitfalls, but I did it last night when a customer said she was happy a tip was included.   Luckily I patiently, humorously, and gently re-educated her. I wasn't certain I had pulled it off without offending her. After all, I was basically violating rule 1 of customer service by telling the customer she was wrong, and I picked up on some defensiveness.   Eventually she told me she felt bad, that she had had some excellent drivers that should have been tipped, and she had been duped by Uber's no tip propaganda.   And then she tipped me $10 on a $30 fare. Totally worth it and a triple win: for me, for her, and for the rest of you, because there is one more tipper out there, and she'll tell her friends."
uberdrivers,3bj2ru,manbergur,-6,Tue Jun 30 10:12:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a driver. When I ride, I pre-tip. That's right, I get in the car and give the driver $5. They always are so appreciative, and it makes for some very pleasant rides.   When I'm driving, you have to tip to get a five star rating, and many drivers now use this standard.   Four stars is a perfectly good non-tipping customer. You will get serviced, but you will be known as a non-tipper and may find drivers are a little reticent if you have special requests.  I picked up a 5.0 rider last night who told me had used Uber 100 times or more, so so I knew right away he was a tipper. He gave me $5 and his buddy gave me $10.  I did 7 rides last night (Sunday), mostly long runs. I got tipped on 3 of the trips. The above noted $15 on a $20 fare, $10 on a $30 fare, and $5 on a $10 fare.   All of these tipping customers received five stars and a business card with my personal number. If they ever need a special service, I will happily provide it.   One guy calls me when he's ate mushrooms and heading out. He says it is worth tipping me $100 for the night cuz I don't harsh his buzz. :)  Uber on!"
uberdrivers,3bj2ru,RutD0g,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:58:47 2015 UTC,"i still dont understand why Uber wont show riders their ratings or maybe even anonymous notes from drivers. if i saw i had 3 stars i would go out of my way to tip higher and be a better rider, just like drivers go out of their way to keep their 5 star rating. i also dont understand why Uber wont put an option to add a tip within the app.. many people just dont have spare cash on them when they are out and about and need a lift from an Uber. sometimes i would love to tip but i have no cash and i feel bad.  that all being said, why do so many drivers continue to refuse tips when i offer them? do they think they are being watched or i am a secret rider working for Uber trying to catch them taking tips?"
uberdrivers,3bj2ru,manbergur,0,Wed Jul 1 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"I really respect and appreciate what you are saying.   Any driver can tell you your rating (if you currently riding with them) and customer service can tell you, too, if you email them.  We also totally understand the lack of cash issue! Options:   many of us carry Square readers Once I gave a guy my email and he PayPal'ed the tip to me Email support, tell them Lyft and Sidecar have in app tips and Uber should, too. (If you haven't signed up with Lyft I've PM'ed you my referral code.)   Drivers refuse tips because they are new and afraid of being fired. Old hands know better. But few last in this gig. It is a very, very high turnover business.   The drivers in this sub have a leg up, are more likely to last if nothing else because they don't feel so isolated. And we will most certainly happily and gratefully accept your tip."
uberdrivers,3bikm8,abnorml1,5,Mon Jun 29 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"Well here's the thing - at its core Uber's business is running an unlicensed taxi service. Now they've managed to expand fast enough to have leverage over many state and local governments who try to enforce the current law, and so have managed to wrangle a certain amount of regulatory reform in many places. But running a business that fundamentally operates in at best a grey area of the law, and at worst is outright illegal, is always a risky prospect. Not every government in the world is as easily bought off or intimidated as American governments, so when you try that bullshit sometimes it's going to backfire.   I'm not saying Uber should be illegal, just that it is illegal. I absolutely agree that the taxi industry pretty much world wide is the beneficiary of protectionist laws that they have pushed for decades, and I definitely agree competition is healthy. But just because you disagree with a law, does that give you a right to ignore it? I live in California, and there are only so many liquor licenses to go around, and so they end up re-selling on the secondary market for tens of thousands of dollars. Well shit I don't like that law, so should I be allowed to operate my own unlicensed speakeasy and then piss and moan when I get shut down?  There's a right way and a wrong way to go about regulatory reform. The one thing that pisses me off the most about Uber as a company, above screwing the drivers and their dodgy media tactics, is that when they are successful they are reinforcing the idea that if a company doesn't like a law it is free to ignore it, and that the way to create change is by intimidating and ignoring the rule of government. As much as Americans have a deep distrust of everything government, at the end of the day a government is there to enforce the will of the people, to be a bulwark against the powerful few ruling over the many.  You want taxi reform? Great, so do I. Do it through the democratic process, not corporate thuggery.  From day one Uber's strategy has been to beg forgiveness rather than ask permission. It's why they pay the fines cities dole out to drivers for operating illegally etc. It's a calculated bet that the cost of doing so will be outweighed by the benefit of taking a decent chunk of the taxi cartels business in the long run when they have managed to build a big enough presence that there will be public pressure on politicians to amend regulations to suit Uber, rather than enforce the old regulations. The people who work for Uber (just to be clear, I am NOT talking about the drivers), especially the upper management, know this. When you take a job with Uber you should factor in the risk that this company may ask you to commit criminal acts for them, and that sometimes those acts will have personal consequences."

uberdrivers,3bj227,scsibusfault,7,Mon Jun 29 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"My friend with a prius does 90-100 hours per week in SF and nets about $2,000/ week on uberx. The trick is that you need to be in or near a major city. Work weekdays 4am-10am, 12pm to 1pm, and 5pm - 8pm, Fridays and Saturdays additional 8pm - 3am. Saturdays and Sundays 9am to 12pm and 8pm to midnight. Hours may vary depending on your city. The only way to find demand is to put in the hours in your city.   That said, uberx is only good as a part time gig, working only surge hours (i.e: morning rush hour every day, and then Friday and Saturday nights). You're better off having a different significant part-time job at a good employer that pays benefits, vacation etc and combine this with uber, as opposed to doing uber alone. I'd only recommend doing uber as a full time gig if you get on UBERSUV, and can make friends with hotel concierges or pay them to refer you clients so that your dead time is filled. Also, get a buddy driver so that the UBERSUV can be driven 24/7."

We are a small UberX only city of about 60,000 and all the drivers tend to cluster around the Old Port for fares.  Also there are craft beer festivals just about every weekend around here.  Us Portlanders LOVE our local beer!  If this is Portland let me know and I'm happy to hang around the festival for fares and help get the word out.    Another thing you could do is check the cities section of www.uberpeople.net and see if there is a forum for your city and post it there.  Does the festival have any food or drinks that are not alcoholic available?  If so you could designate a Uber parking/pickup area and offer drivers free food and drinks for the time they will be waiting for fares."

uberdrivers,3bj662,100292,3,Mon Jun 29 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"It's a minimum fares guarantee, NOT a wage guarantee. Your GROSS FARES have to be below an average amount for the given time.  For instance  Guarantee is $15/hr between 6pm-10pm. Your minimum pay for that 4 hours will actually only be $48 total ($15 X 4 hours - Uber 20% fee = $48)  So really, you need to take 20% (or whatever your applicable uber fee % is) off of whatever the guarantee is to calculate this accurately.   Another thing to note is that Uber calculates these things in ""buckets""... meaning: if you make $3 in one hour but $26 the next hour, that's $14.50/hr in gross earnings for those 2 hours. Assuming those were the only 2 hours in that ""bucket"" you drove, and the guarantee was $15/hr, then Uber only owes you $1."

uberdrivers,3bj7aq,samphy,3,Mon Jun 29 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yes you should be getting them. The problem is that you have to get them yourself. Since you are an independent contractor and not an employee it is not Lyft/Uber's responsibility to withhold earnings nor provide you with income tax information.  Think of it this way... assume you had full carrier insurance and local taxi laws etc weren't an issue. So you decide that as well as operating as an Uber/Lyft partner you start taking personal orders. You give out business cards at bars or whatever so riders call you directly. When they pay you for the ride, would you expect them to withhold a portion of your payment and submit it along with the paperwork to the IRS? The answer should be no. Uber/Lyft are basically just another customer of yours, they just happen to have a bunch of friends and you agreed you'd give them ~20%."

Fares may only be collected through a digital platform. A TNC may not authorize the collection of fares in any other manner.

I probably handle it pretty well because i was that drunk guy once upon a time, and i've also been sober amongst friends who where that drunk guy.. so maybe some that could have been bad were turned into less bad experiences..  in the end of the day, as long as they don't puke, and you don't feel threatened safety wise, all you have to do is put up with them for an average of 10-15 minutes.   once they're out of your car it's as if the trip never happened, excelt you get paid for it.   but be very wary of pukers. i've had half a dozen of those - though only one has been in the car, he did well enough (relatively speaking) to only get it on himself and nothing on the actual car. wasn't the most pleasant thing i'd smelt though."

uberdrivers,3bhq9u,Stuntsheep,6,Mon Jun 29 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"It's clearly been done with numbers intended to illustrate a particular point, and they're not really characteristic of most peoples' experiences while driving.  For example:  Very seldom is one of my pick-ups 3 miles away.  Very seldom does it take me 20 minutes to drive 5 miles.  And it certainly does not cost me 55 cents a mile to drive my car, even while factoring in ALL of the expenses that come with owning a car.  My typical experience driving is more like this:  This past Saturday I went out and drove for 1.5 hours.  I took 5 rides in that amount of time.  My total revenue for those 5 rides (after Uber fees) was about $23.  Over those 5 trips, I drove about 20 miles or so.  That's $1.40 in gas in my car.    So my net profit for the day was about $23 - $1.40 = $21.60 in 1.5 hours = $14.40/hr.  Yeah, there are other minor expenses that I could factor in, but I sure as hell made more than $4.50/hr, and that was on a Saturday morning.  The bottom line is that each person gets to decide if this is worth it for them to keep doing.  If it's not, then just stop doing it."

Either way, I find people are dickheads. They will give you a poor rating for something that's of no fault of your own. Happens all the time. Be perfect and get a 4. God forbid you get any feedback for why. Make an honest mistake and you're completely screwed. Then because of the system itself, you need like 30 - 5 star ratings to make up for 1 bad rating. Even then, 30 -5 start ratings and 1 - 1 star rating equals a 4.87. It's so fucked you're better off just not worrying about it, seriously. I just try to not think about it and be happy with a 4.8. I also find uber riders are way more critical than Lyft. On Lyft I have a 4.91. Same car, same driver, same everything, What gives asshole uber passengers?"
uberdrivers,3bgm0i,BroadStreet_Bully3,3,Mon Jun 29 02:29:59 2015 UTC,"I really think the rating system needs to change.

They find it annoying if they are peppered with questions about the route, the music, if they want a mint, etc, etc, etc.  Try just driving.  Play a 70's Classic Rock station (Classic Rewind or Classic Vinyl if you have XM).  If you use GPS and there are a number of ways to get there just say something like ""GPS likes 25 to Colfax to Sheridan, make sense to you?""  If they want another route then they will suggest it.  Keep in mind, ultimately these people just want a goddamned ride.  They are going from A to B.  If they want to chat, they will chat, but mostly they just want you to drive the damned car.  The preferred route thing, the water thing, the music thing were all aspects of Uber Black that got ported into X.  They were created for a different clientele.   That being said, if you can't keep the rating up, maybe this kind of work just isn't for you.  It may be you just don't have the personality for it.  Or, at least, not the right one for your market.  Maybe try something like this.  You know those candies called Smarties? Buy a bag of those.  Whenever anyone pre-enters their destination address, give them one and say ""You get a Smartie for putting in your destination address.""  I did it accidentally once and the girl fucking loved it so I do it all the time now.  It's a great ice breaker and makes people chatty.

uberdrivers,3bhnfq,mcmellawatt,2,Mon Jun 29 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to tell your insurance company and your policy isn't void.  Example: Insurance policies written in the U.S. almost always exclude coverage for driving in Mexico.  If you drove your car to Mexico and spent a week there in, say, April, that doesn't mean that if you have an accident tomorrow, they would deny a claim on that basis.  Any coverage denial that an insurance company would choose to make because of Uber driving is based on the fact that you are putting more miles on the road than they anticipated when determining your level of risk and premium.  If you're no longer doing that work, then your risk factor went back to the way it was before.  Source: I am an insurance adjuster."

uberdrivers,3bf561,eyemadeanaccount,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"I have state farm. I asked my agent and she had to check with their under writer. She told me that my policy wasn't in effect when I was working AND covered by their commercial policy, but I was covered otherwise.   I made sure to spell out the period 1 time as well. I asked if I needed to go to commercial coverage or add any endorsement or additional coverage. They said I was fine and they would cover me any time I was not actively working, including period 1 time.   They did remind me that I had a low yearly mileage discount and that would have to be removed and go to standard mileage if I went above it. I just told them to raise it to standard mileage as I'm sure I'm gonna go over their low mileage discount limit. My premium went up about $100/yr to go to regular mileage. So $0 change if I had regular mileage anyway.  EDIT: It's kinda like a pizza delivery driver. They use their personal car to deliver pizzas, not a pizza company car. They are covered by their personal insurance when they aren't delivering pizzas and covered by the commercial coverage the pizza place has when they are. I would definitely bring that argument up to any insurance agent who tries to say they won't cover a personal vehicle that gets used part time for business with business coverage. It applies to A LOT of people and has for years before rideshare even existed. The only difference is that you have passengers during the commercial coverage, not pizza."
