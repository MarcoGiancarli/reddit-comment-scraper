Everything seemed to happen at once then; Sandor lurched to his feet, Polliver drew his longsword, and the Tickler’s hand whipped around in a blur to send something silver flashing across the common room. If the Hound had not been moving, the knife might have cored the apple of his throat; instead it only grazed his ribs, and wound up quivering in the wall near the door.

Martin. This one particularly is connected to the fifth book of the series, A Dance with Dragons. In this illustration I combine two events from the book, ascension of Daenerys Targaryen with her dragon Drogon and an episode that succeeds the previous one which is mainly focused on Ser Baristan Selmy, first of her Kingsguard.   The title of the piece comes from the following passage:   ""Tonight,"" said Skahaz mo Kandaq. The brass face of a blood bat peered out from beneath the hood of his patchwork cloak. ""All my men will be in place. The word is Groleo.""  ""Groleo."" That is fitting, I suppose.  -an excerpt from A Dance with Dragons by George R. R. Martin (Chapter 67, The Kingbreaker)"

I was rereading A Game of Thrones, and in one of his chapter Jon remembers back how he used to listen Old Nan's stories with Robb, Bran and Arya. He didn't mention Sansa, and I don't think she listened her that much anyway, but I felt a little bad to not including her, so I added a (kind of weird) portrait of her in the background. (Where she was 5 or so)  This scene is about 3-4 years before A Game of Thrones, so Jon and Robb is ~11, Arya is ~6 and Bran is ~5, but I always had a problem to depict the characters accurate to their ages, it is known."

ImaginaryWesteros,3cso9r,KingKasey,16,Sat Jul 11 01:17:56 2015 UTC,What's the context of this? Is there a theory about littlefinger bringing down the wall?
ImaginaryWesteros,3cso9r,TheMagicFlight,38,Fri Jul 10 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm the painter of this one. Well, the thing I was thinking while working on this, (These are some fantasies I concoct:)) that LF is seeking some trouble for Boltons. He obtains huge amount of wildfire from Cercei -I don't know if they left any:P- then he brings it with horses and carts to the wall. He announces good news to Sir Allisor that kingslanding is sending their regards to the wall. And amongst barrels&crates full of bows, weapons, tools and supplies (which are supplied from Riverrun), he ordered his men to carry the crates with wildfire up to the wall. When it is set up as half of wildfire is on top, and half of it is on the bottom in crates; they set the last party of barrels which is leaking wildfire along the wall with elevator going up. I mean they used the elevator just like Tyrion used a single ship leaking wildfire. After two group of explosives are connected by that wildfire line from bottom to top... a fire arrow comes out of nowhere, and BAM! Hahaha, LF used the elevator to bless the ""ladder""! XD In long story short... This doesn't seem likely. I mean crows are not blind. And I wonder how many barrels needed to wash that loooong way to the top etc etc... but if LF and his men reach the nightswatch at midnight; who knows? Maybe Sir Allisor was so desperate&starved to check all barrels.  And I really didn't think as Littlefinger was working with Night's King. The idea of my piece was mostly about bringing wildlings to the south to create a conflict between Boltons and wildlings. You know, no one in Kings Landing gives a sh.t ( including LittleFinger if he wasn't working with Night's King)  for whitewalkers or giant spiders or any supernatural being to exist. ;)  Anyway, thank you all for your kind words. I'm so happy to meet with many fans here! And I'll create more GoT fanarts in my spare time, for sure. So , if you are interested in my art, please stay tuned! All the Best Ertaç"

Still, it looks to me that people in Westeros is too much stubborn to the things happening beyond the wall. I drew this piece with the conjecture of him ""not"" aware of the issue with the wildlings before himself reach the wall. I don't know if he is capable of reaching the information on how many people is beyond the wall or how many passed by... Or the massacre at Hardhome? If he'd known it, I highly doubt him to ever attempt to bring down the wall.  Working with Night's King is a different approach, though. :))) To me, he is just trying to bring chaos to the northeners; especially to Boltons."

He was removed from the family tree after season 2 so it looks like even that early they were planning to cut him.

ImaginaryWesteros,3bxa4t,afdc92,7,Thu Jul 2 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how long you've been browsing this subreddit, but the kind of art you mentioned is posted here on a regular basis. In fact, it is frequently the very art you specify which garners the greatest appreciation from the community.   Some recent examples are:   /u/VALAR_M0RGHUL1S's current (top post) image of Khal Drogo My own recent submission depicting the Baratheon/Lannister visit to Winterfell /u/hotpieswolfbread's self submission of their own gorgeous portrait of Ashara Dayne (who has never even appeared in the show) Another of my submissions depicting Jon Snow and Ghost   Each of those images is taken from the top 20 upvoted submissions of the past month and none of them are based off their respective counterparts on HBO.  In terms of locating artwork yourself, it tends to be best to use search terms which refer to the books and not the show. So on deviantart, search for 'asoiaf' or 'stormofswords' etc rather than 'gameofthrones'  There's no question that the bulk of ASOIAF/GOT submissions to DeviantArt are depictions of the show characters. In many cases, they're little more than tracings of screenshots that are recoloured or even just screenshots that have been airbrushed a bit to look more 'arty'. This is an unavoidable consequence of most aspiring artists being talentless hacks. That may sound harsh, but it's true of pretty much any creative industry - those with true talent are the exception rather than the rule.  Which is why you are far more likely to find the quality pieces in a curated forum like this one. If you go back and look through our historical top posts, you will find countless pieces of original artwork in no way related to the show.  I should say, that not every piece based off the show is devoid of artistic merit or talent. One of my most recent submissions of Margaery Tyrell was clearly inspired by Natalie Dormer but is still a gorgeous piece of art produced by an obviously very talented artist.  EDIT: Forgot to link to the Ashara Dayne pic"
ImaginaryWesteros,3bxa4t,m1dn1ght5un,3,Fri Jul 3 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"I was going to use your Dormer/Margaery post of a good example of artwork based off an actor, that was definitely a good one. What you said is true though, the majority of the top posts in this sub are based off the books. I pretty much restrict myself to posting that kind of stuff. I already have a picture of the actors, what I'm looking for is different depictions of the book characters to help imagine them."
ImaginaryWesteros,3bxa4t,VALAR_M0RGHUL1S,2,Fri Jul 3 02:38:01 2015 UTC,"Amok is a good artist to start with. He's done portraits for almost every character in the series. They're based off the book descriptions and were started before the show was even out.  http://en.amokanet.ru/gallery/martin/martin.html  As for other artists that do stuff based off the books off the top of my head I can think of Magali Villeneuve, Marc Simonetti, Michael Komarck, Britt Martin. Lots more out there, I recommend just browsing this sub's top posts for book inspired stuff and visiting the artists' deviantart pages where the rest of their work is.  Also, if you just google The World of Ice and Fire art you'll see bunch from that book, all of which is official artwork. Here's Robert from that book for example:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWesteros/comments/2tq8ts/robert_baratheon_by_magali_villeneuve/  Edit: And if you'd like to picture how the castles look take a look at Ted Nasmith's site:  http://www.tednasmith.com/site-map/george-r-r-martin/"
ImaginaryWesteros,3bxa4t,VALAR_M0RGHUL1S,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"The asoiaf wiki generally uses artist's renditions that are based on the books and not the show. For example, Tywin's page shows this image and this, both clearly based on the book description (see baldness and sideburns). So if you want to look at book-based character art, just search for their page in the wiki. Same goes for events and locations - the page about the Battle of the Trident for example has several pictures."
ImaginaryWesteros,3busb1,m1dn1ght5un,7,Thu Jul 2 09:17:07 2015 UTC,"Before anyone mentions garbage like ""Tywin is supposed to be bald!"" I remind you, this is a artist's interpretation.  If we don't allow the painters and some creative license, we will end up with the same pictures over and over again. And r/ImaginaryWesteros just becomes r/Westeros. By deviating slightly from source material, we are able to open new aspects, concepts of fear and beauty, insight into a character that might have otherwise remained hidden. Love these paintings for how they've altered your view of a character as much as you love them for staying true to the books."

ImaginaryWesteros,3b34aw,ReluctantRedditor275,47,Thu Jun 25 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"Nice. I (mostly) like what the show has done with the story, but I think something was lost by having characters of Brienne and Tyrion played by normal-looking/attractive actors.   Brienne's character is supposed to be a homely semi-giant, Tyrion is supposed to be a hideous, misshapen and...  imp. Changing these characters into beautiful but slightly too large/small people really distracts from the character's internal motivation.   But anyway, this rendition of Brienne is much more in line with how I pictured her in the books. I dig."
ImaginaryWesteros,3b34aw,sandusky_hohoho,40,Thu Jun 25 16:55:47 2015 UTC,"eh, i have to disagree. it doesn't really distract from their internal motivations all that much at all, while going a more book-accurate route would undoubtedly distract the audience.  Most people are familiar enough with 'TV' versions of attractive and unattractive that we can immediately distinguish between the two after all."
ImaginaryWesteros,3b34aw,Jimm607,5,Thu Jun 25 17:36:17 2015 UTC,spot on.
ImaginaryWesteros,3b34aw,bensawn,5,Thu Jun 25 23:50:44 2015 UTC,I think at least with tyrion it would just be too expensive and just all around pain in the ass to do a true to book Tyrion.
ImaginaryWesteros,3b34aw,Pepperyfish,-5,Fri Jun 26 04:13:18 2015 UTC,That album sucks. It's all petty cherry picking by butthurt fans which could've been done just as well the other way around.

ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,weirdsisters,28,Wed Jun 24 05:03:13 2015 UTC,I guess it isn't all that weird that Robert never realized his kids weren't legitimate. Most of Eddard's kids had red hair. Which is also a pretty recessive color.
ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,delirium98,23,Wed Jun 24 04:43:29 2015 UTC,I swear there was something mythical about the Baratheon black though. As someone mentioned that it was unbroken from the first of the lineage.

ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,libbykino,24,Wed Jun 24 13:00:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, all of Ned's trueborn children (except Arya) had the Tully colors.  Jon also undeniably has the Stark look.  It's mentioned more than once.  Part of the reason Sansa and Jeyne kinda bullied Arya was because she was so different."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,EricWB,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:12:18 2015 UTC,"I think Sansa had fully Tully colours, so red hair. Jon and Arya looked more like Stark's with dark brown hair. Robb, Bran and Rickon had a mix, more reddish brown so it may have looked different depending on the light."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,libbykino,4,Thu Jun 25 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"Robb, Bran and Rickon had a mix, more reddish brown so it may have looked different depending on the light.   This is not stated anywhere in the books and is a figment of your imagination.  It's said several times that Sansa looks like a young version of her mother (which means they have more in common than just the color of their hair), but Robb, Bran, Rickon and Sansa all have the typical Tully look."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,EricWB,4,Thu Jun 25 03:43:36 2015 UTC,"Just looked on the wiki. Rickon and Bran are described as having auburn hair so you're correct there. Robb is described as having red brown hair, so I'm correct there."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aw3we,libbykino,7,Thu Jun 25 12:06:55 2015 UTC,"The wiki describes Robb's hair as both ""red-brown"" and ""auburn.""  Probably because that's what auburn means.   Robb's appearance favours his Tully side, with a stocky build, blue eyes and thick red-brown hair.  His is clean shaven but his auburn hair falls uncut to his shoulders.    Don't rely on the wiki.  Here's some direct quotes from the actual books:   Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes.   -Catelyn III (Chapter 14, AGOT)   His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt, and a reddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his fifteen years.   -Bran V (Chapter 37, AGOT)   Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair, so like her own, and wondered when her son had grown so big.   -Catelyn X (Chapter 63, AGOT)   He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair.   -Jon IX, (Chapter 70, AGOT)  And those are just a few of the references from a few different characters from the first book.  Your perception of Robb is colored by his depiction in the show.  In the books, he has the Tully look just like his brothers and Sansa.  Catelyn thinks he looks very much like herself, and she's not biased because other characters describe his hair in the same way.  And there's more to the Tully look than just hair.  The Tullys have blue eyes, and are stockier with paler skin than the Starks."

Mulan as Brienne because she is really the best candidate especially because she's the only Disney woman to disguise herself as a man which is kind of what Brienne does but not really disguised, just dressed/same profession. Other options were Merida but she suits Ygritte much better, and Helga from Atlantis but she can be alluring which Brienne really can't.   Podrick Payne is Alfredo Linguini from Ratatouille. They're both a bit awkward, clumsy, well meaning, and young. My other considerations were young Hercules, Thomas (Pocahontas), an Kristoff.

Don't get me wrong - this is not a piece of fine art...but I don't want a budding artist to see one this sub's mods promote their work on a place dedicated to ""shitty"" art."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,VALAR_M0RGHUL1S,7,Mon Jun 22 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"I love the vibrant colors!  The TV show often looks too muddy,  but that is perfect."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,augustelantier,4,Mon Jun 22 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I enjoy the show, but this is the style I always pictured the world in, probably because this was the cover of my original copy of ASOS.  I am still bummed sometimes that the show doesn't depict things like Renly's green armor or some of Cersei's crazier dresses as described in the books."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,meh_whatevers,7,Tue Jun 23 03:10:30 2015 UTC,Stephen Youll is the artist for the covers of the older editions of the books published by Bantam Books. This one was for the cover of A Storm of Swords. You may recognize some of the other ones on his website where he sells them as prints:  http://www.stephenyoull.com/stephenyoull.com/PRINTS.html
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,targaryen3,5,Mon Jun 22 17:16:58 2015 UTC,Who is that standing behind Catelyn? That's not Robb right? Seems way too old.
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,targaryen3,8,Mon Jun 22 19:09:00 2015 UTC,"I think it is supposed to be Robb due to the crown he's wearing. I know what you mean though, he looks a bit old."
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,showers_with_grandpa,3,Mon Jun 22 20:21:37 2015 UTC,He also kind of looks like a cross between Sean Bean and Kyle Machlachlan.
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,Kungfufuman,2,Mon Jun 22 21:27:24 2015 UTC,And what's with the red surcoat if it is Robb?
ImaginaryWesteros,3aqaw0,bfisher91,2,Mon Jun 22 22:18:36 2015 UTC,In the books they describe him as looking a lot older than his age after he went to war. So I guess this could be depicting him a bit old but it's cool the artist tried to capture that image of him too.

ImaginaryWesteros,3arszj,m1dn1ght5un,6,Wed Jun 24 00:00:49 2015 UTC,Well shit - I guess I DO look like a bit of a dick now ;-)  It really is a very good reproduction. I do maintain that there's not necessarily a lot of artistic value is simply reproducing an existing picture...but you have to give credit to someone who actually did it from scratch rather than just re-touching a screencap or working from tracing paper.
ImaginaryWesteros,3arszj,m1dn1ght5un,5,Wed Jun 24 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yeh haha, it is kinda hard to tell at first glance with that one. They did a couple of GoT studies.

ImaginaryWesteros,3arszj,Pinworm45,3,Wed Jun 24 02:15:59 2015 UTC,That's very impressive. The Daario pic is another one I probably would have just assumed was an altered screenshot - although on second glance it's just the faces that are photo-realistic.

ImaginaryWesteros,3a5yxd,erondites,14,Thu Jun 18 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, they followed that pretty much exactly in the show. The other screenshots look very similar to Stannis' camp as well. In this moment, you knew Stannis was doomed and wanted to feel bad, but couldn't really. He lost himself in his quest for kingdom.    I couldn't tell if the Boltons suffered many casualties or if Ramsay was just out there finishing dead members of Stannis' army. The Boltons basically have the north though, aside from what Littlefinger owns. Also, adding to the complexity is a runaway bride in Sansa. Will be interesting to see how the North plays out next season."
ImaginaryWesteros,3a5yxd,MrWinklestein,27,Wed Jun 17 17:27:20 2015 UTC,I don't know about this. I didn't like how Stannis was portrayed in this battle. Sure he might have done a lot of things a lot of us thought are wrong. But he is still one of the best commanders in Westeros. This picture right here is telling me that he basically can't see or hear tens of thousands of troops marching towards him? Does he have no scout? Why is he expecting a siege? Why are they still in marching formation when the enemy have the time to set up a proper attack? I have too many questions.  Edited for grammar.

Roose's first wife was a Ryswell, she died of pneumonia. So he has the backing of the Ryswells who control the Rills, a large area on the western coast. They also have the second most horses in the north after White Harbor.  Lady Barbery Dustin, current Lady of Barrowtown, is a Ryswell by birth and hates the Starks because Lord Dustin was among those killed at the two of joy. Ned never returned his bones to the north for proper burial.  In addition to house Ryswell and house Dustin as allies, houses Whitehill and Burley both swear fealty directly to bolton.  And on top of this they have their Frey reinforcements."

ImaginaryWesteros,3a1ntw,bensawn,5,Tue Jun 16 22:34:23 2015 UTC,This is a fantastic image of my favorite moment from the entire series. I really hope we will get to see DD & DD's interpretation of it in season 6.
ImaginaryWesteros,3a1ntw,Jakereddits,8,Tue Jun 16 23:02:35 2015 UTC,victarion doesnt look nearly enough like a caveman
ImaginaryWesteros,3a1ntw,prinzjay,10,Tue Jun 16 22:53:58 2015 UTC,One of those is Daario right? ;)

ImaginaryWesteros,3a1ntw,Vercify,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:57:56 2015 UTC,According to Asha both victarion and Euron are handsome. According to Victarion Aeron was handsome in his youth before his Drowned status
ImaginaryWesteros,3a1ntw,tevert,2,Fri Jun 19 09:47:04 2015 UTC,"Euron looks exactly like Daario and Victarion looks like fucking Thorin Oakenshield, lol.   Love the blue lips though, that was a nice touch on Euron."

ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,BlackfyreNL,40,Mon Jun 15 23:41:22 2015 UTC,It's still hard to believe they decided to throw away this character that would've at least given us a bit of vengeance for all the wrongs done to good characters.. The show now seems to be focused on having good things happen to the bad guys (to the point of being ridiculous) and bad things happen to the good guys (because it creates forced 'drama')..
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,Jay-El,5,Tue Jun 16 09:36:46 2015 UTC,"I can hardly believe that they threw away what is effectively a vengeful zombie character when there's nothing that screams ""moneymaker"" quite like zombies.  not technically a zombie but still"
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,dcatalystm,13,Tue Jun 16 18:23:31 2015 UTC,Since when were there good guys and bad guys
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,BlackfyreNL,15,Tue Jun 16 12:29:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much since day one. The characters in the books are nuanced, grey characters who do despicable things on one occassion and positive things on another. Tyrion in the books is not the completely good guy that he is on the show.  The Freys have nobody to hurt them with Stoneheart missing, the Boltons have nobody to hurt them with Manderly missing and so the 'bad guys' get away with pretty much everything they inflict on the 'good guys'."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,BojanglesTheCrazed,7,Tue Jun 16 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know I think there are still evil characters in the books. Ramsay, the Mountain etc. I can't think of one description that portrays them as morally grey."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,BlackfyreNL,2,Fri Jun 19 23:27:37 2015 UTC,"You are correct: I should have said 'most' characters. Although I do like how the Mountain's behavior is sometimes attributed to his headaches. I've never had any, but I can assume that severe migraines can make anyone pretty aggressive.. As for Ramsay, I think he might be the only genuine psychopath in the series.."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,starlinguk,3,Sat Jun 20 09:09:15 2015 UTC,The problem is that she takes revenge on people who are on her side.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,Khal_Pogo,0,Tue Jun 16 13:09:06 2015 UTC,"She might not be lost forever... I'm holding onto my hope that they will roll this story line into another character, like Sansa. There were so many nods to Cat in Sansa's clothing and actions, I want to believeeee"
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,howisaraven,3,Tue Jun 16 19:02:09 2015 UTC,But that would mean Sansa has to die! D: The poor child has been through enough.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,ApathyPyramid,24,Wed Jun 17 06:30:08 2015 UTC,What a missed opportunity.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,McBurger,3,Tue Jun 16 07:29:13 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll keep saying it.  I think the show could still write her in.  I have hope!  The logic: this is a HUGE reveal. A true WTF. People would lose their shit. If she was revealed in S3 - 5, the writers probably felt they couldn't just leave the audience hanging. Reveal one of the most major twists then just not address it for three seasons?  I do believe Brienne (not so sure about Podrick) may still encounter her. The show could still work it in there with the current state of things! Maybe when they have solid plans for what her role will be."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,afdc92,23,Thu Jul 2 04:19:44 2015 UTC,What's even sadder about her exclusion from the show is the fact that Michelle Fairley could have rocked the Lady Stoneheart role out of the park.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,Spiralyst,14,Tue Jun 16 15:10:26 2015 UTC,I really hope she finds her way back to The Twins.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,howisaraven,9,Tue Jun 16 02:37:57 2015 UTC,"I know she's not an actual zombie, but I would still like her to rip out Walder Frey's still beating heart and eat it."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,fossilhunter,8,Tue Jun 16 12:45:58 2015 UTC,Perfect.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,kris10amanda,10,Tue Jun 16 01:37:34 2015 UTC,cat? Can someone give me the story on lady stoneheart? Im only a show watcher
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,SwordsmithBrewCo,32,Tue Jun 16 08:59:28 2015 UTC,"Cat was resurrected by Beric Dondarrion (who you might remember from when Arya was in westeros, he was the knight that challenged The Hound to a trial by combat and lit his sword on fire) after the events of the red wedding. Cat had been floating in the water down stream for a couple days before Beric got there, which is why she looks the way she does. Beric gave up his life to save Cat's.   Lady Stoneheart also takes over the brotherhood without banners, Beric's group, and seeks out vengeance for her family. She is also a bit crazy."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,kris10amanda,14,Tue Jun 16 09:10:11 2015 UTC,she sounds fucking awesome! They should have included this in the show!
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,howisaraven,19,Tue Jun 16 10:47:30 2015 UTC,"And since her throat was cut she can't really speak but does this groaning, death-rattle voice."
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,MyUncleIsBlack,29,Tue Jun 16 12:44:49 2015 UTC,But she remembers.
ImaginaryWesteros,39z5ud,Sweepy_time,8,Tue Jun 16 14:07:37 2015 UTC,Her omission from the television show is one of my biggest disappointments. Not only do show viewers not get to see her but as a book reader it basically tells me that her character isnt that important in the grand scheme of the plot.

ImaginaryWesteros,39xgj9,Direlion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:00:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for an honest critique! (: I know the proportions are off! Lol. I believe in a true freehand, you'd be surprised how many artists trace for the outline and proportions, then just shade. I've got some other works that are much better (proportionally) and some that aren't, but I really enjoyed doing this one, and Tyrion is my favorite character on Game of Thrones/ASOIAF. So I thought I'd share, more for fandom's sake then art's. I've been drawing seriously for about 3 years, so I know the progress you can make just from practice! Thanks again! :)"

ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,recreational,7,Sun Jun 14 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"Targs straight up aren't immune to fire. It's probably the most ubiquitous misconception about GoT, just because of how it was presented in the show. I've included an explanatory link!"
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,CountedCrow,3,Sun Jun 14 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I can be equally pedantic and say that quote doesn't prove that some Targs aren't always resistant (with dragon fire and maybe wildfire being the things that can burn them).  To me it says that not all Targs are ""dragons"" but some are, and I'd guess if that's the case, those are the ones who can tame dragons, and Tyrion is likely one (if he is a Targ at all which I don't entirely buy)"
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,zgrove,2,Sun Jun 14 04:12:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I think we might be on different pages here. To what ""quote"" are you referring?"
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,CountedCrow,3,Sun Jun 14 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"I assumed you meant this quote   Lastly, some fans are reading too much into the scene in GAME OF THRONES where the dragons are born- which is to say, it was never the case that all Targaryens are immune to all fire at all times.   Or am I wrong"
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,zgrove,10,Sun Jun 14 04:48:20 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but I also meant this one:   No Targaryans are immune to fire. The thing with Dany and the dragons, that was just a one-time magical event, very special and unique. The Targaryans can tolerate a bit more heat than most ordinary people, they like really hot baths and things like that, but that doesn't mean they're totally immune to fire, no. Dragons, on the other hand, are pretty much immune to fire.   And this one:   [This Q&amp;A] gives me a chance to clear up a common misconception. TARGARYENS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO FIRE! The birth of Dany's dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle. She is called The Unburnt because she walked into the flames and lived. But her brother sure as hell wasn't immune to that molten gold.   For further support, should you need it, I recommend reading into the Tragedy of Summerhall, the death of Aerion Targaryen, chapter Daenerys X in A Dance with Dragons, traditional Targaryen burial rites of being cremated, or the video I linked elsewhere in the thread.   All said, though, in context of this picture, who gives a grumpkin's ass if Targs are immune or not, it'd be a cool reveal if A+J=T were true and the visual composition is friggin rad."
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,CountedCrow,2,Sun Jun 14 05:13:28 2015 UTC,Wasn't she also burned by Drogon and not killed in Daznak's pit though?
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,jufakrn,3,Sun Jun 14 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but she wasn't directly hit by his fire, if memory serves. I think she ducked under his flames. She still got pretty burnt, of course, but it's not like she survived a direct, full-frontal assault of dragon fire."
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,CountedCrow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:44:27 2015 UTC,I just checked the chapter and you're right. I know Targs aren't immune to fire I just thought that Dany survived Drogon's flames in that chapter.
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,jufakrn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:00:57 2015 UTC,"Of course, it's very easy to remember it that way, I had to double check myself."
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,CountedCrow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:04:20 2015 UTC,Oh I hadn't seen those. I guess I just don't get why she was just burned and not killed by Drogon in the pit :/  It makes sense with everything else though! I feel kinda stupid that I've been arguing my point when it was clearly wrong
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,zgrove,3,Sun Jun 14 06:44:44 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it. Like I said, very common misconception, and they definitely make you think the opposite in the show."
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,CountedCrow,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:32:22 2015 UTC,And in the books too I'd say
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,zgrove,4,Sun Jun 14 14:52:26 2015 UTC,Drogon didn't specifically burn her. The heat from his flames was so hot she was burned as collatoral damage.
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,Tasadar,7,Sun Jun 14 07:34:06 2015 UTC,Awesome! This implies that Tyrion is a Targaryen. It would be crazy if that was revealed.
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,VALAR_M0RGHUL1S,8,Sun Jun 14 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"that's a popular theory, not sure if you've heard it.  The Mad King took a liking to Twywin's wife on their wedding day, and kings can demand the first night. Tyrion also is mentioned to have dragon dreams.   It would explain a lot and fits pretty good.  Jon is also apparently Rhaegar's  son.   Song of Ice (Jon) and Fire (Dany)"
ImaginaryWesteros,39ql57,Justin620,6,Sun Jun 14 04:31:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's about prima nocta, since Tyrion is the YOUNGER brother. The Lannisters spent plenty of time at court."

ImaginaryWesteros,39g9kb,InLoveWithMusic,3,Fri Jun 12 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"It's possible that it's not Stannis but as far as I know there's no other ""blue-eyed king"". Also so far in the books Stannis is the only one with a glowing sword."
ImaginaryWesteros,39g9kb,Squggy,13,Thu Jun 11 23:55:04 2015 UTC,I thought it might be the nights king? Because wights have blue eyes and since only fire and dragonsteel can kill them they would be the opposite of the lord of the light hence have no shadows?
ImaginaryWesteros,39g9kb,rebeleagle,7,Fri Jun 12 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"Night's King is a possibility for sure, though the ""red sword, glowing like sunset"" seems like the opposite of what the Walkers' weapons are usually described as. This is my interpretation of it but GRRM could still hold some surprises up his sleeve here."
ImaginaryWesteros,39g9kb,andrewsaccount,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:03:51 2015 UTC,Then why would it have a red glowing sword?

ImaginaryWesteros,38su5k,Merker6,14,Sat Jun 6 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, he's a very conflicted character. I'm actually a bit annoyed that we'll never get to meet him. I would have loved to get a look inside his head. There's just so much mystery surrounding him."

That is probably Elia even though she should almost technically be with Rhaegar and the Targaryens, but I guess you don't get to change your name when marrying into a Royal family.

ImaginaryWesteros,37ukdz,Gogkti,-9,Sat May 30 16:14:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. After 5 seasons it's time to accept that any project gets ripped

ImaginaryWesteros,37ukdz,barandor,2,Sun May 31 12:06:02 2015 UTC,But then why did they get kicked out? Wouldn't the Martells be sheltering them? Also didn't Doran say Oberyn went to Braavos and sign a deal in front of the Sealord?
ImaginaryWesteros,37ukdz,jakec2025,4,Sun May 31 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"True, Dany clearly spent some time in Braavos. But that doesn't mean that's the only place she was raised."

ImaginaryWesteros,37ukdz,jakec2025,5,Sun May 31 13:29:29 2015 UTC,that's nice but slightly different from how i've pictured the red keep in my mind from the books. shouldn't it be on a cliff?  what's the church on the back? baelor temple?
ImaginaryWesteros,37ukdz,venom02,3,Sat May 30 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"The Red Keep is built atop Aegons hill, which is the tallest hill in the city. The other building would be the Great sept of Baelor."

ImaginaryWesteros,37ukdz,dangerphone,14,Sat May 30 17:04:10 2015 UTC,Peasants can't read. It's for the merchants maybe.

Link to buy is in the link of the YouTube video -- I charge $20 for them mostly for the cost of the bamboo material. Thanks for watching!

All the other elements of the picture - Bran, his cloak, the trees, the raven, the snow - are blended together very nicely, but that extra face looks kinda copy/pasted in, with a sharp, straight, delineation, like when you have an expanded-section in a diagram.  The art would, IMHO, be better without that extra close-up, or if it were faded/feathered into the rest of the picture."

The crew are apprehensive as they can see stone men shuffling around the glowing lamps and hear a faint, high wail coming through the fog just as they are about to pass underneath. However, most of the stone men take no notice and the pole-boat passes without incident.  Once they are clear of the bridge Tyrion Lannister reveals that he knows who Young Griff really is. Tyrion also reveals his true identity to Young Griff. Just as Tyrion is puzzling out who Griff is and Varys's involvement, the crew realise that due to inexplicable circumstances the Bridge of Dream is up ahead yet again.  The pole-boat passes under the bridge again shortly afterwards. This time three stone men jump and land on the boat. The crew fights them off, but as Tyrion knocks the last one off, it grabs him and pulls him down into the Rhoyne as well.  http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bridge_of_Dream   Illustration source:  http://www.fadingray.com/illustration.html"

Someone made a comparison with this scene to the mythos about Hades tricking his wife Persephone into staying in the underworld with him nine months out of the year. I also know that pomegranates in literature often represent fertility, and most people only care about Sansa producing their heir. I hope this answer was somewhat satisfying. Sorry if it seems a bit rambly, I'm on pain meds as I type."
ImaginaryWesteros,35ymf8,itspellsyoudidit,6,Thu May 14 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"I just read it again this morning, but it still baffles me that he is shy of 30 at the start of AGOT."
ImaginaryWesteros,35ymf8,JNile,6,Thu May 14 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"So I'm new to this subreddit and am kinda confused about what the purpose is. Is it really imaginary if its a painting of the actors depiction of the character? I kinda thought this place was about what was imagined when reading the books. Like I said, I'm pretty new to this place so forgive me if I'm being ignorant."
ImaginaryWesteros,35ymf8,acromantulus,3,Thu May 14 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"While pieces that do not depict the actors are often the most popular around here,  that is not the purpose of the ""Imaginary"" part of the sub name. Imaginary is just the naming scheme that ties the Imaginary Network Expanded (INE) together. So ""imaginary"" in our case refers to all artistic renderings.   No worries, we get this question a lot. :)  /r/ImaginaryFood people like to point out that apples are real and /r/ImaginaryMerfolk people like to point out that all merfolk are imaginary, lol."

ImaginaryWesteros,35z7ok,urbangeneticist,1 point,Fri May 15 04:33:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the show was gentler on a lot of the characters - I mean the Hound alone had near-oozing permanent wounds on his face.    I like this interpretation of Brienne though. Very Joan of Ark-like. I think the show is doing fine with its own thing.
ImaginaryWesteros,35z7ok,PookieChang,2,Fri May 15 12:23:59 2015 UTC,I love the armor work. :)
ImaginaryWesteros,35z7ok,JustOkCaiters,4,Fri May 15 01:41:50 2015 UTC,I wish that more fan art would be fan art and not portraits of actors and actress in character
ImaginaryWesteros,35z7ok,PookieChang,5,Fri May 15 01:40:01 2015 UTC,I have to admit I was introduced to the books because of the show.(please don't hate me!) But now I'm really enjoying listen to the audiobooks when I'm commuting and working. I must admit it's tough now to picture the characters differently from the actors. In the future would the subreddit appreciate less actor resemblance?
ImaginaryWesteros,35z7ok,DingoScallion,1 point,Fri May 15 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"I most certainly would. The book descriptions are much different than how the actors look, so seeing an artists view on how the characters look would be a breath of fresh air, rather than just seeing drawn versions of the tv show"
ImaginaryWesteros,35u3hl,bearfry,24,Wed May 13 14:57:02 2015 UTC,I think you captured the regret that he must've felt about his part in Renly's death perfectly. The facial expression is nice but my favorite bit is the clenched hand on the table.   That's a man in some pain.

ImaginaryWesteros,35u3hl,sandusky_hohoho,43,Wed May 13 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"It's meant to be Stannis mourning his own actions that killed Renly. Stannis says something to the effect of ""I'll go to my grave thinking of Renly's peach"".  You can keep your upvote, if that's the only thing you got hung up on.  Edit: ""Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?” [The king gave a shake of the head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck.] “Only Renly could vex me with a piece of fruit. He brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother’s peach.” - Stannis Baratheon"

ImaginaryWesteros,35mfnc,dsanta123,7,Mon May 11 18:30:07 2015 UTC,Can you post some proof that this is OC? I only ask because it's a stock image being used as a background with the artwork on the canvas being added on. Many others have used the same stock photo just with a different image on the canvas.   http://imgs.abduzeedo.com/files/tutorials/Poster_Mockups_in_Photoshop/media_1370213370647.jpg  http://www.tineye.com/search/6d4f149a713673dd5970b4232de00735aca8e391/?pluginver=chrome-1.1.4  If you have a personal art page or gallery online that you could link that would work fine.  Edit: Looking at your other posts refreshed my memory of your posts with GoT playing cards. You're good to go disregard what I said earlier. Though it would be nice to get to see the full image without it being on that stock photo :)
