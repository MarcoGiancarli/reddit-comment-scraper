I know that the users here often mock that sub by being more extreme than the posters, I do that myself sometimes. Point is, this is a sub set up and designed to do little more than mock a different sub.  When delving into arcon however, I find that it can be nearly impossible to tell the difference between sarcasm or satire and between someone who is 100% sincere, but is simply that extreme. I deal with this problem by assuming that everyone over there is sincere all of the time, or at least wants their post to be taken that way.  But I'd agree with you that Obama probably has other things to deal with. Like organizing the downfall of western civilization at the hands of Big Gay and ISIS. (See?

We are a couple trillion in debt so anyway we can raise money I'm all for it.   The premise of your argument is that it's acceptable to disregard moral principle for monetary gain.   No, he didn't say it's a moral issue.   My one hope is that this abominable ruling becomes something like Roe v. Wade has. Many folks don't remember that prior to that ruling, abortion enjoyed a fair amount of support. Most Americans simply didn't realise that fœtuses are human beings (heck, IIRC the Southern Baptists supported it back then). Opposition to abortion was lumped in with opposition to contraception.  As a result of Roe v. Wade, the pro-life movement was forced to examine its philosophical, legal and ethical arguments, and it is (slowly, but surely) persuading the nation.   If by ""slowly but surely persuading the nation,"" you mean, ""staying staying relatively stagnant since the late 90s, barring a couple blips in 2009 and 2012.'""    Alternative explanation: the previous polls were using fake data. It wouldn't be the first time that the Gay Mafia has used fake data to advance their agenda.   Gay mafia? Gay agenda? Is it the 50's?   This guy gets it.   that's this current generation, they want something instantly, and now then when they do get it, they toss it aside and move on to the next thing. I feel bad for the legit gay couples that saw this as a beacon to actually get legally married but it was ruined by SJWs.   The fuck is this joker even on about?   Yep I figured after the ruling this would become a non issue and fade into obscurity. Glad I am right. In the end no one cares and this did nothing for the culture of the United States nor did it convince anyone of anything.

The pussification of America is out of control.   From what I've read, Jenner is attracted to women, not men, and the people calling it courage are a sports network you shouldn't be giving anywhere near this much of a shit about. This says nothing about America, you moron. You guys are way too obsessed with this Jenner person. I'm still not entirely sure who she is, I only know her as some former athlete transgender person who arcon cannot shut the fuck up about."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,savois-faire,8,Sun Jul 19 11:44:32 2015 UTC,Masculinity is such a fragile thing.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,jiandersonzer0,5,Sun Jul 19 15:28:18 2015 UTC,Dude I wouldn't know who Caitlyn Jenner was were it not for conservatives.  And they say we're the perpetually offended ones.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,LeChuckly,4,Sun Jul 19 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a conservative myself, I just don't really follow popular culture. Or at least not stuff like reality TV, which is where I'm told she made herself famous. After whatever sports thing, anyway (I don't even know which sport it was she practiced)."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,savois-faire,4,Sun Jul 19 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"She's famous for being an Olympic athlete.   She was also a part of the Kardashian reality show, and most kids know her from that. If that's any indication."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,jiandersonzer0,4,Sun Jul 19 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, she's with that whole Kardashian clan, then. I've been actively ignoring them for years, and their show doesn't air in my country as far as I'm aware, so that does explain a few things regarding my ignorance of her."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,savois-faire,5,Sun Jul 19 15:33:49 2015 UTC,It also explains why she's so important to teenagers.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,jiandersonzer0,6,Sun Jul 19 15:40:48 2015 UTC,Is it bad if I think Lauren deserved the award more and that ESPN is a trash network that is only about ratings
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,5,Sun Jul 19 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"No, that's a perfectly reasonable opinion to have. ESPN has definitely shifted towards sensationalism in their reporting in the last few years. I agree with them that this is obviously a case of ""Caitlin Jenner is in the news right now and if we give her an award it'll generate tons of publicity for the ESPYs.""  The problem is that /r/conservative doesn't seem to recognize that Caitlin Jenner, in her own way, is courageous. Trans hate has not gone the way of gay hate in that it is still relatively okay to call them freaks or trannies. It takes bravery to look at yourself honestly and finally come to terms with who you are, even if who you are is not someone easy to be.   Maybe Lauren deserved the award more than Jenner, but honestly the award isn't even about who's courageous. None of these awards are ever about that. It's about finding someone who's story reaches a lot of people in an emotional way. At a crucial time for transgendered peopled, Jenner's story is important to them and their friends and family."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,4,Sun Jul 19 18:41:00 2015 UTC,Your penultimate sentence gives ESPN way too much credit. Ratings first!
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:45 2015 UTC,I would say a story that reaches a lot of people goes hand in hand with a story that is likely to generate good ratings. Or a story that angers a lot of people lol.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,BbCortazan,3,Sun Jul 19 18:59:57 2015 UTC,I'm an avid sports fan and I've really come to hate ESPN. So there's that.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,BbCortazan,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:35 2015 UTC,The worst part is the zero sum idea of courage. The comparisons to soldiers and really any other form of courage as if the two are mutually exclusive is truly absurd. It's an insignificant award from an even more insignificant award show. The obsession some people have with it is very telling.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"Awards are political especially one so vague as ""courage"" so your opinion of her getting the award doesn't really have anything to do with transgenders. But I bet the people who are upset about her getting it (and misgender her when they discuss it) can't name anyone else who's gotten that award. Or watch the Espy's for that matter. It's the obsessive outrage that's telling."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,BbCortazan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:01:09 2015 UTC,I never said I was outraged. I just thought a sports award show giving a courage award should've given it to the athlete Lauren. My two cents.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,2,Sun Jul 19 22:21:19 2015 UTC,Oh I wasn't attacking you and I'm sorry if it came off that way. I used your comment as a jumping off point for the people that are the real problem but made the mistake of not making it clear that I didn't consider you among them.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,BbCortazan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:24:56 2015 UTC,"It is interesting that she is the first trans celebrity. My crackpot theory is that get marriage became accepted one gay people become tv characters (sitcoms, reality shows, etc.). Could the same thing happen guys trans people? A sitcom with a trans character that makes gender jokes somehow?"
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,3,Sun Jul 19 22:34:48 2015 UTC,Transparent is a comedy that doesn't make jokes at the expense of the transgender character but uses people's reaction to that as the basis for the conflict. So that's a start.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Rhys345,2,Sun Jul 19 22:42:05 2015 UTC,Good comedians don't make jokes at the expense of others. They satirize.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:56 2015 UTC,Gender jokes would only further trivialize the social hurdles trans people have to go through.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Rhys345,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:46 2015 UTC,I disagree. It would signal acceptance. In the future there will be gender jokes just like there are gay jokes now. How do you know there's a gay guy in the mafia? When the crime is a little too organized.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,BbCortazan,2,Sun Jul 19 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it reinforces stereotypes. This goes the same for token gay characters. It doesn't add much substance to the show, when they could just be normal characters. I think it's a sign of lazy writing if they have to force minorities into a show like that."
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,Pardonme23,2,Sun Jul 19 22:42:49 2015 UTC,I agree. A truly progressive message would be an exploration of gender as a social construct.
ShitRConservativeSays,3dtke3,blackgold161,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:58 2015 UTC,Or we could have smart comedy like Clayton Bigsby and Borat.
