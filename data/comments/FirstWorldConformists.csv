So that means first of all, we don't have to go dark because of /u/dudekid2060's post. But should we go dark? The post continues by giving a hierarchy to follow, and I have not heard from ""admins"" or higher that we should (or should not!) go dark. Paradoxically (or perhaps my need for authoritative guidance is showing), ""People on the internet"" (e.g. /u/dudekid2060) are in this hierarchy, but they are below ""Mods"".  Mods have not gone dark and are clear authorities on this subject. Attempts, and clamoring for us, to go dark by ""people on the internet"" are therefore clearly non-conformal. Please reconsider your positions accordingly, unless I am corrected by a higher figure in the hierarchy (mods, admins, shadow governments, etc.).  That said, I am not attempting to accuse anyone of nonconformity, I just think this is a very confusing time for us all."

FirstWorldConformists,37y7uy,ireter294,6,Sun May 31 23:06:14 2015 UTC,HANDSTANDS   Handstanding is not standing just because you ignore half the word.  Semantics is fun like that.

FirstWorldConformists,37y7uy,ireter294,8,Mon Jun 1 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"""using limbs"" is not what ""standing"" or ""handstanding"" mean.  A competent speaker of the English language would look at you funny if you said, ""John is doing a handstand"" or ""John is handstanding"" when John was balancing himself upright with his feet being the only part of himself touching the floor. Likewise, if Mary is a gymnast, she does not look very lovely when she holds ""a very nice stand.""  Note that they're not even used the same grammatically;  one does not simply handstand, one ""does a handstand"" or ""holds a handstand"".  I used the word ""handstanding"" to make them comparable in this thread, but that's not a regular usage.  Source:  Circus artist."

FirstWorldConformists,37y7uy,Snoah-Yopie,3,Mon Jun 8 07:37:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, for fuck's sake, you're just admitting my point.   If we admit that ""handstand"" is defined as ""standing on your hands"", it doesn't reduce to ""standing.""  Nor is it a type of ""standing,"" unless ""standing"" is strictly a category, which it's not.  Unless you're going to start referring to people that are holding themselves upright on their feet as ""foot standing"".   etymology trumps semantics   No, it doesn't.  The usage of words is always more important than the etymology; etymology is where a word comes from, which is almost never sufficient to tell you what it means.

This is commonly used at commuter train stations.  Back many years ago, and often in a one car family, where the wife did not work a job outside the home, the wife would drop off her husband at the train station.  While he commuted to the city to work, she would have the use of the car during the day, before returning to pick him up at the train station, at the end of the day.  With this sign, they are referring to a ticket holder drop off point at the venue."

Possibly I saved it as too low quality, but I'm guessing it's more likely that Imgur has a maximum file size for a single picture, and rescales images until they fit the correct size.

I think it was because people on Reddit probably wouldn't be bothered flicking through an album, especially if it was just all the same thing over and over.  I wanted to give a sense of the scale in a single picture, and also I wanted to put at least a bit of effort for you guys, into stitching them together so it wasn't just a screenshot."

I had similar thoughts to you, but reversed. I was like, ""yeah sure I'll make one long post"" and then I thought, ""it's just a post on reddit. Not going to put that much effort into it.""

FirstWorldConformists,2zbyye,Battletooth,69,Tue Mar 17 11:54:50 2015 UTC,Especially when adding complexity also increases the chance for an error to slip in.
FirstWorldConformists,2zbyye,kaasmaniac,38,Tue Mar 17 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"When my wife was learning French, I told her to always be simple.   If a question asks, ""use the following words in French to make at least 2 sentences: Dog, cat, house, walk""   And she would make a 6 sentence paragraph that has grammatical and spelling errors and verbs in the wrong tense and words in the wrong order. Those would all get marked down. But her use of the words that were asked were correct. If she wrote, ""I like to walk with my dog. My cat is in my house."" (in French) then it would have been full points.   That's exactly how this math problem would work out. There isn't much room for failure if you simplify."

FirstWorldConformists,2zbyye,Kaibakura,3,Wed May 20 17:49:04 2015 UTC,This is a logical fallacy. Argumentum ad populum (argument or appeal to the public). This is the fallacy of trying to prove something by showing that the public agrees with you.

FirstWorldConformists,2zbyye,Kaibakura,6,Wed May 20 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, this is but two more fallacies!  The first one is Argumentum ad nauseam. This is the fallacy of trying to prove something by saying it again and again. But no matter how many times you repeat something, it will not become any more or less true than it was in the first place. Of course, it is not a fallacy to state the truth again and again; what is fallacious is to expect the repitition alone to substitute for real arguments.  The second one is Argumentum ad hominem. This is the error of attacking the character or motives of a person who has stated an idea, rather than the idea itself."

Eventually, even our sun will fade into a white dwarf, a superdense ball of inert matter, slowly bleeding its remaining heat into space.

Weed => Ents => Trees. That became the new name of the subreddit after the drama with /r/marijuana (as posted by /u/fritzly)
FirstWorldConformists,2r1st4,fritzly,4,Thu Jan 15 22:22:12 2015 UTC,people were calling weed trees in the 70s.  Ents came from LOTR but trees has been around for a long time.

And I was kinda happy with that decision. Later I received a letter with an ear of wheat and a picture of a legless kid asking for more money, trying to use the same kind of guilt manipulation on my 7 year old ass. That's when I decided it's sometimes ok to say ""fuck you"" to NGOs.    I mean, not only it was unfair but it must have costed a lot to send the letter, the A4 color pic and the wheat and my first thought was ""why the hell don't they use that money for the kid?""  edit : what the fuck is wrong with reddit/res nowadays?

It's pretty clear on what it wants to advertise (/r/bitcoin) and the call-to-action (""Join us"") simply pops. Good use of contrasting colors (orange vs. the wizard's blue robe). I'd give the ad about 7.5/10.   What do you guys think? Let's discuss!  PS: I joined /r/bitcoin solely because of this ad. Coz, you know, that's how we conformists do."
FirstWorldConformists,2f7kw7,Xhihou,15,Mon Sep 1 23:37:19 2014 UTC,"I actually like it better with the hand-done MSPaint art! It's not crappy by any means, but it's silly casual, which fits the silly message. If it was really pro art I would think it was just spam, like those online RPG ads one sees with the amazing (and boob-laden) art for a shitty, shitty browser game.  I also enjoy the tongue-in-cheek reference to the common misconception about digital monies, which, while easily abused, is not common enough in daily speech to be tiresome."
FirstWorldConformists,2f7kw7,Cookiedrengen,8,Mon Sep 1 23:53:22 2014 UTC,"And the fact that a subreddit actually buys an ad on reddit show us that there is something about their ""Magical Internet Money"" - which is in a strong contrast to the MSPaint art."

FirstWorldConformists,1klbpb,Adarashilo,2,Mon Sep 23 17:29:21 2013 UTC,Pshh everyone knows you go the speed of everyone else on the road to be true conformist. Dae realize it's about the other people?!
FirstWorldConformists,1klbpb,Eversharp,7,Tue Oct 15 21:06:04 2013 UTC,I choose one car per trip and decide to mirror its every action. No matter what.

FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,Rhode,22,Thu Aug 1 13:45:15 2013 UTC,Yes you should do what he says.
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,Vadersays,15,Thu Aug 1 20:36:57 2013 UTC,And do what this guy says
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,CoCo26,20,Fri Aug 2 05:45:32 2013 UTC,I'm not sure if I like these questions. Or any questions. Conformists shouldn't need to ask questions in order to conform.
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,Votskomitt,-13,Thu Aug 1 23:53:35 2013 UTC,Don't tell him what to do
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,attentiveness,10,Mon Sep 2 21:18:41 2013 UTC,"You just got yourself Commented, Shared, Saved, Hidden, and Reported, buddy.  I even checked your comment source, too."
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,t3yrn,12,Thu Aug 1 21:13:05 2013 UTC,"And replied. But that means every single comment I make, you are required to reply.  This'll be fun!  edit: and edit your comment  So you have to permalink, save, view the source, report, give gold, save-RES, reply, and hide the child comments"
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,t3yrn,7,Thu Aug 1 21:18:42 2013 UTC,Aw crap.  This isn't good.
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,t3yrn,9,Thu Aug 1 21:23:38 2013 UTC,"Look on the bright side, since you don't have gold,  you don't have to save it twice."
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,ReadsSmallTextBot,5,Thu Aug 1 21:26:40 2013 UTC,Hmm excellent point.
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,t3yrn,3,Thu Aug 1 21:30:20 2013 UTC,I  saw  that.
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,t3yrn,5,Thu Aug 1 21:31:02 2013 UTC,why the fuck did it reply to you and not to me  racist
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,ReadsSmallTextBot,5,Thu Aug 1 21:31:51 2013 UTC,I have no idea but I'm dyin' over here!
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,t3yrn,3,Thu Aug 1 21:36:45 2013 UTC,"I would be giving gold to everyone to commented, if i wasn't broke and the last person who did that got shadowbanned"
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,UnluckyLuke,4,Thu Aug 1 21:38:50 2013 UTC,"That's a pretty silly thing to get shadowbanned for!  I'm broke too, or I might consider conforming better to this thread!  At least we've both kept up on the replying bit.  We must both be very lonely..."
FirstWorldConformists,1jhkr5,darkfred,9,Thu Aug 1 21:48:32 2013 UTC,"Sorry for not repling, I was busy.  I just noticed that there are some buttons above the editing panel, I'm using RES  I think we should [start](using)    them   in    future comments   reddiquette  ಠ_ಠ Reddit Enhancement Suite"

FirstWorldConformists,1j0rw0,MissMaris21,5,Thu Aug 15 04:21:40 2013 UTC,It is is not even a link.

FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,aaronm109246,26,Mon Jul 8 15:11:29 2013 UTC,Why would someone put a stop sign there?
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,1spartan95,31,Mon Jul 8 16:18:16 2013 UTC,I'm not sure haha. This game has some other flaws  Edit: Heres another
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,CoCo26,11,Mon Jul 8 16:21:08 2013 UTC,Well did you go straight or turn left?
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,Antrikshy,18,Tue Jul 9 20:01:06 2013 UTC,I Tried to go straight but you can see how that worked
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,Hubley,5,Wed Jul 10 05:47:09 2013 UTC,"Late comment, but you also cannot turn right from there."
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,dabockster,0,Thu Oct 3 00:34:05 2013 UTC,What game is this?
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,shart_master,13,Mon Jul 8 18:26:43 2013 UTC,Forza Horizon
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,Harold_Spoomanndorf,34,Mon Jul 8 18:58:33 2013 UTC,"Dude, really?"
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,darkfred,16,Mon Jul 8 18:50:20 2013 UTC,There are only 2 rules of the road that I will always follow:  1) NEVER cross a double yellow line.  2) ALWAYS stop at red lights and stop signs.  Everything else can be dealt with on a situational basis...  You did the right thing.
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,vtor67,1 point,Mon Jul 8 18:06:11 2013 UTC,"C'mon, it's a video game.....live a little.  /r/firstworldanarchists"
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,shillbert,13,Fri Aug 16 12:10:44 2013 UTC,"Good for you. Virtual conformance unlike real world conformance, with it's rewards and consequences, is the truest form of conformance.    Virtual conformance is the platonic ideal of conformance, conformance for the sake of conformance rather than the light hand of our shared social bargain.  A true conformist conforms when no one is watching, nay even when no one else is conforming."
FirstWorldConformists,1hv8g5,zandrexia,7,Tue Jul 9 00:38:50 2013 UTC,How do we know you stopped if this is just a screenshot?  I'm suspicious that you might be hiding your anarchy.

FirstWorldConformists,1hmi3d,MarkDrees,18,Thu Jul 4 09:02:09 2013 UTC,Wait are you the one on the left because you make a v convincing ad.
FirstWorldConformists,1hmi3d,Travie6492,8,Thu Jul 4 19:21:31 2013 UTC,"Yep, that's me on the left. I think the soup is the only giveaway :/"
FirstWorldConformists,1hmi3d,yParticle,5,Thu Jul 4 22:08:40 2013 UTC,"Frankly, your soup looks tastier than the one in the picture, which is a bit of a reversal.  The only giveaway is that your cup isn't full."

FirstWorldConformists,1hmi3d,davidd00,4,Sun Nov 10 16:26:35 2013 UTC,Success!

FirstWorldConformists,1hbd8f,kettesi,5,Sun Jun 30 18:06:29 2013 UTC,I guess that I am being a bit mean. He does appear to be doing the best that he can in order to conform. I stand corrected.
