asexuality,3e4qcp,Coroxn,18,Tue Jul 21 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's why labeling can be dangerous. Sexuality can be fluid and changes over time. I usually discourage younger kids from labeling themselves because so much can change as you grow up and even once you're grown up. Go with what you feel is right (not what others do) and don't corner yourself under a label."

asexuality,3e4qcp,LadyTintagel,2,Wed Jul 22 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"Sexuality is certainly fluid.  Honestly I've always been somewhere in the grey area but I have gone through periods when I'm more sexual than others.  As I've grown I find myself far more sex-positive than I used to be, and almost hand-in-hand with that I find that I'm more and more indifferent about sex for myself.  I wish I were more sexual, today, but I'm happy being grey.  Don't feel guilty.  Sexuality is always evolving for many of us.  Gender identity is always evolving for many of us.  The important thing is to find a place where you fit.  Where you're satisfied and happy and feel valid.  And.. I'm a relative newcomer here, but I certainly don't mind if sexual people contribute to the discussions here, if you'd like to continue to participate in the community.  From my experience in the asexual community in general thus far, I doubt anybody'd judge ya for being a turncoat ;)"

I haven't been here in a long time, and in that time frame a lot has happened to me. For the longest time the idea of doing anything sexual to a woman apart from giving oral sex seemed too much pressure for me to accomplish. I assumed I was asexual due me believing being gay or barely bisexual was so impossible for me, so I just assumed I was either odd as hell or an asexual lost in a fog of messy sexualities. And then I met the best person I could have ever graced my life with, and sex and sex topics have been huge for my boyfriend and I. I may be gay, or bisexual with a 90% being gay, but I've learned that all that matters is how happy I am, and how happy he makes me."

I know of asexualitic and acebook, but haven't had much luck.  You could try the AVEN forums, I know they have location-specific boards, but I'm not sure how accepted it is to seek relationships out on there.  Sometimes I feel like I'll have to move to a large city to ever get a chance at finding another ace to spend my life with, but even then I imagine it's tough.

Like asexuality is a disease that needs to be cured, or a result of some psychological trauma, instead of a legitimate sexual orientation. It just gets a little depressing seeing the same things over and over again, and constantly being accused of being broken or confused or sick.   If the same questions were posed in the context of ""My husband admitted he wants to have sex with men,"" instead of ""My husband admitted he doesn't want to have sex with anyone,"" then there would be a totally different reaction.   ""A relationship between two men is just a friendship.""  ""He wants to have sex with a man? He needs to get his testosterone levels checked.""

Usually if a loss of sex drive occurs due to health/social issues, the person feels some distress. Not always, but many times. And so if the husband was distressed about his lack of sex drive, those would be valid concerns. If he has told her that he is asexual, they are not. (The OP didn't make clear whether he claimed to be asexual of she thinks that based off what he has told her).  However, I do not agree that a sexless relationship is not a relationship.

You cheated--your feelings on this don't matter to the relationship; if he's not okay with it then you can't really make a relationship work.""  Second comment is a little less feelings-oriented and more needs-based, but since they're talking to the coercer, it's far more productive to focus on the basis for the desperation than on the acts borne out of desperation.

I read that thread when it was posted, stuff at the top is just what's popular and part of that norm. I joined this subreddit to learn about asexuality. I mostly learned that asexuality is very misunderstood, and asexuals are just normal people, too. I don't think I will ever comprehend the ability to not have sex. It's about orgasm, it's about the drive to procreate; I just won't understand the mental or evolutionary benefits from being asexual. And that's the vast majority of people. Don't blame her for being on that side of the fence. Thinking about my last relationship with an ace infuriated me because of my lack comprehension.   I feel sorry for those two, he got married on false principles, and so did she. You all will never understand that drive, that urge, or maybe some of you will. I know sexuality is fluid and dynamic, but that part of the sexual people's lives is what makes life fulfilling. It can drive you to depression, anxiety, insanity without it. Especially when your spouse or SO wildly led you to believe that you were something you're not.   It's an argument most of us won't ever fully understand. Sorry you guys feel oppressed by being in the minority. Don't use a false sense of superiority to judge us normies. We will just never understand each other."

For the record, I'm part of the norm (and I know that will make me unpopular here)   First off, calling yourself ""normal"" is kind of insulting to us because it makes the assumption that we're abnormal or something is wrong with us. Secondly, assuming that just because you're an outsider to our group that we'll hate you is dumb. We're pretty accepting I think.   It's about orgasm, it's about the drive to procreate; I just won't understand the mental or evolutionary benefits from being asexual.   Even though you preface this with ""you won't understand"" it still kind of implies that we have no reason to exist which is frankly insulting. Homosexuality also leaves out procreation so do you say the same about them? Not to mention that some Aces do have sex drives and might enjoy sex   that part of the sexual people's lives is what makes life fulfilling. It can drive you to depression, anxiety, insanity without it.   I think this a negative stereotype that has bad consequences for both Aces and sexuals as well. Sex doesn't have to be the most fulfilling thing in life and I know many sexuals who are virgins (either by choice or circumstance) that would find offense at this statement. Not to mention by saying that, you're saying that 99% of the population only finds life fulfilling through sex which carries the direct implication that if an Ace chooses not to have sex they can't have a fulfilling life.   Especially when your spouse or SO wildly led you to believe that you were something you're not.   I might be misinterpreting this one, but it seems like you're faulting the man for ""leading on"" his wife by making her think he was more sexual than he was. Before I found out about asexuality I thought I was heterosexual and had the same sex drive as everyone else. It wasn't until I was 18 or so that I realized most people actually wanted to have sex. This man might not have realized that he was asexual until years into the relationship and in the beginning was having more sex with his wife because he just assumed that's how it was. I don't think he was necessarily leading her on, but we don't know the full story either way.   Don't use a false sense of superiority to judge us normies.   Um most Aces don't have a false sense of superiority as far as I know. And again calling yourself a ""normie"" implies that there's something wrong with us.    We will just never understand each other.   I 100% disagree. I think if we have meaningful dialogues we can help each other see life from the other's point of view. I don't think it helps anyone to just say ""We're different at a fundamental level that prevents us from knowing how each other feels"" and frankly it marginalises us more by saying that."

So, if you meet a random asexual, assuming that they're sex-repulsed, (and thus that they probably don't enjoy sex all that much,) seems safer than assuming that they're not sex-repulsed and that they do enjoy sex.  Of course, assuming neither would be the safest, but AugurAuger does say ""maybe some of you will [understand]"", so they're not necessarily saying it's impossible... and it seems likely that most asexuals probably would have some difficulty empathizing with a lack of sexual intimacy driving someone ""to depression, anxiety, [or] insanity"", doesn't it?"

asexuality,3e2r4m,akinoriv,3,Wed Jul 22 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"For the record I am part of the norm (and I know that will make me unpopular here).   Okay, so you are a sexual person. That doesn't make you unpopular here by default. This sub isn't a ""lets all hate on sexual people"" sub. It is a place where people (sexual or asexual) can come to get more information about asexuality, where asexuals can bond with other asexuals in ways that we can't in real life, where asexuals can come to terms with their experiences because they are never talked about in the mainstream anything.  So no, by being sexual you are not automatically unpopular here. In fact, you are welcome here.   I don't think I will ever comprehend the ability to not have sex   Asexuality isn't the inability to have sex, it is the lack of sexual attraction. There are many asexuals who do have sex. But there are also many that do not feel the need to have sex.  Not having sex is not special to asexuality, there are people of all sexualities that decide to be celibate.   It's about orgasm, it's about the drive to procreate; I just won't understand the mental or evolutionary benefits from being asexual.   But there are many people who have sex and either can't procreate or don't want to (there is a sub call r/childfree). So that drive is not the only factor.  Examples of possible evolutionary benefits...more people to care for the young, a way to help make sure that you don't over-populate.  As for mental benefits...well I don't know. I don't understand the need for sexual attraction, so how am I supposed to know the benefits of not having it?   but that part of the sexual people's lives is what makes life fulfilling.   See, that I can't understand. How can a single action make all of life fulfilling? There are so many other things to do, to pursue, to experience...that to say without this one experience life is not fulfilling is doing a disservice to the life that was actually lived.   Don't use a false sense of superiority to judge us normies.   First of all, most asexual people I know do not have any sense superiority over people that are sexual. In fact, for most of my life I have been told I am inferior because I don't worship sex.  Second of all, you tell us not to judge, but the statement ""us normies"" implies that you are judging us.  edit: Words. They sometimes don't like me."

asexuality,3dy2lb,BringOutYaThrowaway,4,Tue Jul 21 01:09:44 2015 UTC,"Except that in a world where everyone expects everyone else to be sexually attracted to somebody, it's natural that people who don't feel sexual attraction would see that they're different and that it would influence how they view the world.  It's fine to ignore sexual things if you want, but a person's sexuality (whether that's hetero, homo, bi, pan, ace, or anything else) is part of their identity.  It doesn't seem right to tell people to deny that part of themselves, or that they shouldn't seek support from people with similar experiences or be open about their experiences with people who don't share them.   I hope that makes sense.  Not really sure if I interpreted your meaning correctly.  I'm tired, so sorry if I didn't.  Now to sleep! :)"

Thing is, the party has seen an awful lot of members saying some pretty reprehensible things like the ""gays cause floods"" line and ""our money going to bongo bongo land"" in reference to British foreign aid.  The party leader has being playing the surprised victim card at every accusation that his party is racist, stating that the members who say these things are removed from their position in the party and each one is an isolated incident. But there have been a lot of isolated incidents, and voting for UKIP is now largely seen as a pretty good detector of racists in the populace.  UKIP also want to repeal various pieces of legislation like the goods and services act from a few years back that bans people from refusing service to LGBT+ people, hate crime legislation, etc. This may have been in the party manifesto or just ""let slip"" by the party leader at one point, I forget.  All this adds up to UKIP being seen largely as a bunch of ne'erdowells who no one should want to be associated with. This isn't even covering the party's LGBT youth leader who quit his position in the run up to the recent election stating ""I couldn't defend the party any more"" or the current headlines about a UKIP MEP being jailed for fraudulently claiming £500,000 in expenses."

I support their rights and their movement fully, of course. I'm not a monster. But I feel like the asexual recognition struggle is a very different one and in many ways diametrically opposed to what Pride and such is about. Including us feels respectless and like a cheapening of LGBT issues to me. And I do know that probably most people in the LGBT movement don't agree with me and don't feel that way and have no problems including us, but that doesn't make it right to me. I'm not saying we can't be allies, but I don't think we belong in the same movement and I always feel extremely uneasy about it, sort of like I'm inadvertently being used to set back LGBT rights by being included.  But anyway, that's only tangentially related to this. I may suspect, knowing what I do about UKIP, that their alleged LGBT rights section probably agree with me and that's the precise reason they did this in the first place, but regardless staying away from those guys is probably always the right decision to make. Even people who agree with the party must realise that being associated with them is bad for PR and thus very much impractical, if nothing else."

Being blunt, their attitude (IMHE) is very much ""We're fighting for acceptance of the right to have sex with whomever we chose.  You don't even have sex. You're not us.  Go away.""   I've seen that people will accept LGBT quicker than they'll accept ACE.  In their eyes, not wanting sex is much weirder than wanting sex with different genders/orientations.  In the eyes of bigots, being gay is wrong and weird, but being ACE is inhuman.     So I do think that our fight is different to that of our LGBT friends."

So aside from being a woman, my risk factor for asexuality is quite low. I know quite a few asexuals with advanced degrees, good health, solid income, and reasonable height.   The paper and the study are a pure form of science. We observe asexuality in some but not others. Why? Is the cause biological? Is it social? Studies like this have been going on for homosexuality for a long while, and have proven ultimately fruitless. The cause of sexuality remains one of the great questions in biology.   I think the disservice that an article like this will do is that it will tie asexuality to negative life circumstances - the ultimate ""she's just asexual because she can't get laid."" I don't have a subscription to this journal, but the abstract should have related their study to similar studies done on homosexuality and done comparable samples of all sexualities simultaneously to see if biases appeared. Given that homosexuality doesn't show a measurable bias on any of these things, it should put forth a hypothesis as to why asexuality would. You can show the correlation between global warming and the number of pirates in the world, but can you reasonably explain it?"
asexuality,3dksw9,astrobean,8,Fri Jul 17 03:59:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! The biggest issue I have with this study is that the author assumes that everyone is naturally born with sexual attraction, and anyone who doesn't experience sexual attraction must have some mental disease or have experienced some traumatic event. While some people with mental diseases and other unfortunate issues may be asexual, the author's assumption is very ignorant.  While correlation does not imply causation, someone else pointed out that asexual people may be depressed or in poor health because of the misunderstanding and mistreatment that sometimes accompanies asexuality.  Although this is completely unrelated, what is your profession?"
asexuality,3dksw9,astrobean,6,Fri Jul 17 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"So the author is beginning with the assumption that asexuality is a disease? That is the same belief that motivated early studies of causes of homosexuality.   I don't think that mistreatment/misunderstanding of asexuality would be a dominant factor in socioeconomic circumstances, health, education, height, or gender. I would guess that many asexuals did not know about their asexuality early enough for it to influence development to that degree. Maybe the next generation will, because they'll know that asexuality is an option.  For me, the assumption that I was heterosexual for the first 30 years of my life did not provide significant additional stress. Relationship stress is not exclusive to asexuals. Socioeconomic conditions are often inherited. Unless the authors show that the condition came about after the person identified as asexual, it seems incidental. Maybe those in lower socioeconomic classes have experienced more pressure to identify/express their sexuality and those hot higher class have more control over when/whether they marry, so do not adopt the label. (I have a number of single friends who I would suspect as asexual based on behavior but who still identify as heterosexual.)  Health is also strongly tied to socioeconomic class, so I wouldn't consider that an independent factor. Lower class people often don't have the access to healthcare that upper class people do. (Although this is a British study, so that correlation may not be as valid.)  I'm a scientist. Can you tell?"

He's one of the most prominent researchers on the topic of asexuality, and the author of ""Understanding Asexuality"".  This paper was a landmark in the recognition of asexuality as a sexual orientation.  There are a number of problems with that ""1%"" statistic, and even Dr. Bogaert himself admits that it's not perfect.   It didn't actually ask about asexuality.  He used responses to other questions as a proxy. Most people don't know what asexuality is, especially back when that survey was done. It's hard to assert an identity when you don't know that identity is a possibility. People often conflate romantic attraction or sexual arousal with sexual attraction and could have answered based on that. Ditto sexual activity/behavior. It was a sex survey.  Aces are probably less likely to be interested in responding to a sex survey than other people are.   Dr. Bogaert devoted a chapter in his book to this subject.  Many people believe the actual number is higher than 1%, which is why I use (as do others) the phrase ""at least 1%"" when talking about prevalence.  The topic of getting a better number and the difficulties around that came up in one of the sessions at the recent asexuality conference.  Beyond that, I can absolutely assure you that Dr. Bogaert does not hold the view that ""something must've happened to make you asexual"".  I've read many things he has written, and although some of them may be a bit speculative and weird (In his book, he talked about the possibility that no asexual people would have eating disorders, which was a total WTF moment), I've never seen him say that."

As for you - I'm glad you're so supportive of her.  To be quite honest I don't think it's really a good place to be coming from to say that part of the reason you want sex is because she had sex with her exes, but I know emotions aren't that simple.  If she is ace, you may need to consider couple's counselling to try and figure out how you can make your conflicting orientations work together."
asexuality,3d4nki,PalatableNourishment,2,Wed Jul 15 02:48:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your advice.  Actually, I thought being ace means to experience no sexual attraction, or only in very particular circumstances if you are in the gray zone.  But the way you put it, well, she never even felt the need to masturbate. It does bother her, but not in that way I suppose. She feels weird, unnormal she said it has always been like that. Also she feels like she is not able to have a relationship. She made this small remark that she got help, in my frustration i said maybe she should get professional help. In case she still doesn't feel like a normal lovable human being, who she totaly is, I would like to tell her about asexuality. Would you recommend that?  Then again she wants to try it with me, to see if it works. She actually made some progress getting more intimate. Which sounds a little contracdictory if she was asexual, but sexual preferences can also change over time I read so who knows.  Yeah, as for me, I am aware of how ridiculous one of my reasons sounds, but the point is I am encountering her first ex, who totaly fucked her life over, even in situations outside the bed room. But in the bed it hurts most. She is clinging to the past, that is for sure. But that is not supposed to be an excuse for bad reasons on my side. I am simply jealous, which I am in no other case though.  Couples counselling will be impossible for at least another year, and she has other issues for which she is getting help currently. Maybe everything is connected and as soon as she gets a better self image things will change.  Okay, I will look at the good sides and what we already have, kind of working out.

Which sounds a little contracdictory if she was asexual   It's not actually contradictory. Asexuality is just not experiencing sexual attraction. We can still experience romantic attraction or sexual desire (though it sounds like your girlfriend has a somewhat low libido?), and can still want to have sex, whether it's because it feels good or because we want to have that intimacy, or for our partner's enjoyment or any other number of reasons.  Basically, my suggestion is that you talk with her, and make sure to not pass judgement. Feel free to ask clarifying questions, but saying ""You should do X,Y, or Z,"" won't be particularly helpful for your understanding, and questions that are phrased like ""Why don't you just [do thing that seems obvious to you]"" can put her on the defensive.   We can't determine if she's asexual. Only she can. And if she feels like ""asexual"" or ""grey-asexual"" or any other variant is a useful label, you should respect it. Asexuality that seems to be ""caused"" by trauma is just as legitimate as asexuality that has no obvious trigger."

It'll give both of you the chance to collect your thoughts, and if she has something extra she finds she needs to say, it'll give her the chance to do that, too.    And keep in mind that she may not understand all of this herself.  If she says, ""I don't know,"" don't try to push her.  Just say ""okay,"" and sit there, and let her talk or be quiet.

In some sense, Kickstarter might be the best way to make this happen if at all...  When you're dealing with a subsection of an already small group you need enthusiastic and dedicated users.

asexuality,3d1swg,starm4nn,5,Mon Jul 13 00:22:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I think we need an open source dating application similar to diaspora. We could allow people to host their own mirrors. People who host mirrors would get the mathematically more optimized picks picks. This would ensure that we could at least mirror have enough mirrors. You could mirror a small part of the site (say profiles whos last name starts with A-C) if you don't have a beefy computer. Allowing sexuals who are not looking for a sexual relationship in particular would also allow the potential for more optimized search and ensure the users are more likely to be happy with the matches. Eventually we could monetize the project via ads or donations. We could split off into specific sites dedicated to certain demographics. If open source technologies can develop the most successful kernel, most popular compiler, and the most successful unix based OS, we can develop a successful dating website."
asexuality,3d1swg,alter_id,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need an open source one, but I disagree that it should be decentralized like Diaspora.  The whole point of an online dating software is the match algorithm, not the profile.  As someone who has done some work on other decentralized social networking platforms, it is MUCH more difficult than you think.  Even the simple profile system is difficult enough.  Ads also wouldn't work since it is decentralized, because the revenue would naturally go to the person who owns the node.  The payoff isn't worth the effort.  I think making a plugin for something like Elgg would be the way to do it.  A simple Google search implies that there are already some Elgg plugins out there, but they don't seem very good."

I'm very much in a similar situation. I'm not repulsed by sex. But sex for me...is pretty much a 'take it or leave it' deal. I get frustrated, because I'm very sex positive. I realize how important it is in relationships, and have seen relationships disintegrate by sex - less by sex and more from lack of communication.   I think the best policy...cliched as it is ... is honesty. I'm hoping your boyfriend is a super cool guy who will be supportive of you. I eventually had to just have a full 'let the chips fall where they may' conversation with my bf. I have no problem satisfying him - but a ""physical"" reaction is never achieved by me.   I would never advocate a ""try changing your sexuality"" approach. I would seriously just continue to figure this out. Go on discussion boards. Even consider finding someone to talk to professionally (but I can't stress this enough - someone who would not demonize asexuality or treat it as an ailment) - and tell your bf what you're going through ."
asexuality,3d1sg0,idkmanwhatever,3,Sun Jul 12 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"The short version is if the asexual (or graysexual) label feels right for you, then it's right for you. Labels are really just a starting point, when it comes to interacting with others, an explanation is usually required, since many people have slightly different definitions.  With that said, asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction. You can have romantic attraction, kink attraction, etc. that isn't always sexual. Romantic love is definitely possible without sexual desire.  I'm kinky - when I see someone who is attractive to me, I don't think ""I would like to have sex with them"" I think about how happy it would make me to spank them or whatever. I don't get sexually aroused.   I should also point out that when I say attractive, it's not totally based on looks, usually it has a lot more to do with energy. I will see someone playing at a party (kink) and see how much they are enjoying submission or bottoming, for me, that's attractive.   You will also find that in the BDSM world there are many people who do not combine sex and kink. For a lot of people, it's non-sexual.   I don't know if that helps at all. What it comes down to though, is that you get to define you."
asexuality,3d1sg0,Nymphetamean,2,Tue Jul 14 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"The only real ""requirement"" for being asexual is not experiencing sexual attraction, so if you only occasionally feel sexual attraction, you definitely fit the description of grey-ace.  Kinks are different from that, but I don't really have the understanding of them to explain coherently, so I'll just leave this image of some types of attraction here.  Just keep in mind, whatever you feel, it's up to you to decide if a label is right or not."

I don't want to date them or anything, but I say that I want to paint them. I only have really deep friendships. That said, BDSM has its own appeal also. I like interacting with people in a non-romantic or sexual way, to make them happy, if they wish. I also enjoy the feelings for myself which are associated with BDSM (holding another's desires in your hands, etc.) If I can do it and stll identify the way I do, so can you."

I think you can be asexual or grey-ace and still have interests in dom/sub stuff.  I do, and I've known other aces who do as well. D/s doesn't always have to be about sex. I've also known allosexual people into bdsm who said that their bdsm activities and their sex lives were totally separate. So I don't think having an interest in the dom/sub thing disqualifies you from being asexual.  It's my understanding that if you are asexual then you don't experience sexual attraction, if you are grey-asexual then only rarely will you experience sexual attraction. Only you can really decide what term suits you best, if you find it useful to do so."

asexuality,3d1sg0,chuckawoodchuck,-7,Thu Jul 16 10:53:32 2015 UTC,"Part of romance is love. Romance generates emotional feelings of passion and connection with someone of the opposite or same gender. How and why Romance and sexual attraction has been split is beyond me. They are essentially one in the same. One is more about emotion and the other physical but, they both intertwine. The movie Titanic is very romantic. Its something that arouses both men and women Sexually. It arouses couples etc etc. The story behind the romance is what creates that sexual energy. To separate the two (as many asexual's do) is nonsense. There is no reason to deconstruct it mechanically.  My answer to your question is this. Perhaps you are not as asexual as you believe to be. Asexual is defined as this:  is the lack of sexual attraction to anyone, or low or absent interest in sexual activity. Of course you can still be asexual, but perhaps you are not altogether. There are numerous other psychological factors that can be considered that can explain your aversion to sexual contact.  It sounds to me, that you need a different type of simulated sex, that does not include genital to genital penetration. And that would not be exactly considered asexuality."

asexuality,3cy2ib,symmetrygear,10,Sat Jul 11 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"I was really open about my asexuality, so when my boyfriend asked me out, he already knew what he was getting into. We also have really open communication, so there weren't any misunderstandings.  I doubt bars and clubs are a good choice for you. I think it's probably better to ask out someone once you're already friends with them (or at least acquaintances). That way, you can casually bring up asexuality / the fact that you're asexual at some point before you ask them out. Also, make sure they actually understand what asexuality is. That way there's no awkward ""Do you want to go out sometime? BTW I'm asexual,"" and there's no getting into a doomed relationship because they don't know you're ace beforehand.   Also, you're only 20. I was 18 when I had my first kiss, and I'm in a great relationship now. Don't be too sad about not having found a good relationship yet."

asexuality,3cy2ib,intheshape,4,Sat Jul 11 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"As several others have stated here, there has to be communication and a mutual understanding. As an asexual who wants to date, you'll need to become comfortable with talking openly about your feelings and your relationship if you don't want to run into any major pitfalls. Don't just assume that since it feels to you like you're dating that the other person agrees. At some point there needs to be a conversation about mutual exclusivity, if that's something you want, and definitely a conversation about establishing boundaries that each of you is comfortable with."
asexuality,3cy2ib,Daelys,3,Sat Jul 11 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else I recommend communication, and specifically, aim for finding good conversations. Usually it does not take a lot of communication to start something, it's just the hurdle of saying something like ""are you available,"" ""would you like to talk more,"" etc. Besides ""dating venues,"" go to clubs, events, etc., even if your interest is very slight. Apply to jobs that intrigue you even if you're unqualified or unable to take them. Doing these sorts of things eventually brings you into a Good Conversation, and it is in the conversation that you learn something about yourself, the other person, and the world - the important part is NOT the surface aspect of ""I love this hobby"" or ""I am going to find a great partner"" or ""I am going to earn a living"" or other ""agenda myths"" that our culture accepts as appropriate, logical premises. Everyone is more complicated than that - and when you come in with those sorts of agendas it often rings false, because there isn't substance to them. Either they fit you and you embody it, or you are trying very hard to act it out. It's way easier to do the first.  The other part to this is that in the teen/young adult years, everyone is either trying to figure these things out, or are actively burying their true feelings underneath such storytelling. That creates an identity problem. I'm almost 30, and have lately been going through a period where I realized what's held me back from exploring relationships in the way I described above was, in fact, the identity problem; in a lot of situations, I was holding back on what I wanted to do or say because it didn't fit the role I thought I was playing. I felt awkward about myself, constantly, and got unnecessarily angry or annoyed about things. The relationships I was in I would tend to kind of run away from, or allowed to blow up.  Over time, and especially in recent weeks, I started more intensively questioning gender identity, and specifically those male gender roles I had been assuming, and whether they were fitting me well. What's changed as a result of that was not really the labels I'm using(although I am playing with those as anchoring points, the same way that I played with asexuality labels when I discovered them) - because for me it isn't really a problem of feeling dysmorphic or needing to adopt a different name or pronoun - so much as how well I am achieving those internal thought patterns and modes of behavior that I'm naturally inclined towards. In turn, that's made me much less anxious about how I present and communicate, and it's gradually building into stronger friendships and potentially romantic relationships over time. So for me, in that case, gender was important, but it's only just one piece of the identity puzzle. And on this point I'm really certain: The more of it you can solve about yourself, the more natural it'll feel to make connections.  tl;dr - talk to everyone; know thyself"
asexuality,3cy2ib,3fox,3,Sun Jul 12 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Well, my thoughts on this may or may not count to you guys, because it just so happens that I'm in an imaginary romantic relationship with a cartoon character that I have a doll of right now, but, because it counts to me, I'm putting it here, just in case. I think it is dating when you go out on dates (in my case, I imagine that he and I are going on dates and I take my doll with me places just me and him and call it a date sometimes and such.) Take it from an Aspie, a.k.a. someone who thinks logically and literally: it's dating if you're going on dates. Doesn't matter where you're going on dates (a restaurant, a bowling alley, a movie theater, a mall, a library, a basketball game, a play, each other's living rooms, a flower garden - whatever, wherever you both want to go on a date, it works). Obviously, if you're dating a real person, you can't just imagine a date and have it count, but it counts if you are dating a fictional character. Not everyone expects sex. I'm sure there's plenty of real people out there who are also asexual and willing to date you. As for starting a relationship, well, it tends to always start with friendship, in my experience (I have dated real people before, and before I started going out with my current cartoon boyfriend, I thought of him as being ""like a friend"" before thinking of him as ""like a boyfriend""), and then, eventually, if it's going to happen, it will turn into something more. If you don't want to go around carrying a toy with you and going on imaginary dates and such, I've heard that OkCupid is a good site for asexuals looking for real people to date, and you can have lots of settings on there (heck, there are even settings for friends, if that were all you're looking for). How do I know this? SwankIvy on YouTube. I've watched a couple of her videos (some of them before I even truly realized I was asexual), and she's an ace girl, I think in her 30's or similar, super nice and fun, and she once, in one of her videos, showed a screencap of OkCupid to help her explain that it's not just a dating site. I saw, in that screencapture, all kinds of settings - ""casual friends"", ""casual sex only"", ""casual dating only"", etc. I have thought about going there just to make friends, maybe, but I don't think I'm old enough yet.

You're now dating, in a relationship, etc. I don't understand how else this is done? By updating your facebook relationship status and hoping for the best? That's idiotic.   Get a hobby and fall for someone who you find interesting and have things in common with. Don't go around bars to find your SO. Horny drunk people lie to get in bed with you.  Also don't date someone who expects you to have sex with them. Just don't. They're not worth your time and will make you feel ever more depressed.

It may seem like everyone out there wants sex, but there are other asexuals out there, as well as sexuals who don't want/need sex. You've just gotta keep trying and being open about who you are. If someone doesn't want to be in a relationship with you because you're asexual, they're not the right one for you. It's better to get that conversation over with sooner than later.  As far as meeting people, some larger schools have aro/ace clubs, and you could always start one. You may also want to try online dating.

I am of the belief that more people believe or think they are asexual and aren't.  Many people that avert sex or are anxious about sex claim that they are asexual and are not. Its easier to just say you are asexual, when there are other underlying problems, especially unconscious problems psychologically. Now these are some of the things that can cause asexuality in a person beside from it being a genetic thing.  Severe Depression, and loneliness, trauma, Attachment disorders and something called Sexual Avoidance disorder. Many of those who have these in bad cases can have asexuality because of their lack of interest in anything pleasurable. But they are not asexual in any way. Their experiences have made them asexual. Besides from these factors its is quite possible you could be asexual, or it could be that you have little experience and have become disinterested in sex situations. -_- asexuality is considered to effect 1% or less of the population. That is not very many considering we have a population of 310 million or more. Not many at all. So its worth researching and perhaps seeing a psychologist about. Don't just assume you are asexual because you are averted from sex. Something else could be occurring psychologically."
asexuality,3cy2ib,jewishjerky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"At what point does seeing someone become dating when no sex is involved?   At the same point where people who don't have to fuck before they'll commit to a pair-bond transition from going on dates to being a couple.  Which is to say, whenever both parties want to become a couple.   I can't imagine many people, myself included, have a lot of luck in bars and clubs, because often the other person will be looking for a one night stand.   Those aren't places where one goes to look for a relationship partner, no.  If one happens to meet someone and form a lasting association at a bar, that's not unheard of and can lead to a relationship, but it's very much the exception, all the same.  Although more likely in the kinds of bars that aren't meat markets where people engage in seeking out others for casual sex, so, there's some nuance and variance of venues.   I'm a student, M/20, and it's becoming increasingly depressing. Any advice?   Have you looked into student organizations and community groups?   I also don't want to have a situation where I think I'm dating someone and they're not aware of it   That's, uh, that's why there's a thing called defining the relationship.   or invalidate it due to a lack of sex.    Well, either you're upfront about being asexual and they understand this or they don't.  And there's really no way to guarantee that someone is always going to be content with a romantic relationship that doesn't and will never include sex, since there's some chance, no matter how slim, even when dating another asexual that they're actually gray or demi."

asexuality,3cvmja,osteopath17,14,Sat Jul 11 03:45:35 2015 UTC,"YES!  Sexual attraction, Romantic attraction, Platonic Attraction and Aesthetic Attraction are all separate components of human sexuality and identity that each have their own spectrum of ""who"" and ""how"".  You can be an asexual grey-heteromantic who is demi-hetero-platonic. you could be a homo-romantic asexual who is also demi-biromantic and bi-platonic, You could be a heterosexual allosexual who is grey-hetero-romantic and pan-platonic.... The possibilities are endless and because some people have a fluid sexuality, you may feel your complex identity changes several times, It can be difficult to understand who you are, so don't stress too much about labeling the fine details of your sexuality, If you are getting stressed by all the grey, demi and so on, relax, don't stress, very few people seek to label themselves with so much detail and if it's upsetting you, you don't have to. Human sexuality is infinite and social language isn't."
asexuality,3cvmja,mundabit,5,Sat Jul 11 04:07:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's just important to realize that you don't have to label something just because it can be labeled. Occasionally on AVEN I'll see someone describe themself as ""gray-heteroromantic demi-homo-sensual pan-aesthetic asexual"" or something like that. All of those things may be well and true, and if someone prefers identifying that way, I'm not going to stand in their way. But is it necessary, or useful? I don't know..."
asexuality,3cvmja,falling2geeses,5,Sat Jul 11 04:50:49 2015 UTC,"I think at some level, knowing how to label yourself helps, even if you don't go around telling everyone all the specifics of how you label yourself."

asexuality,3cvmja,minnie1008897,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:41:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response!  I was asking more for my own general knowledge and understanding rather than to find my own label.
asexuality,3cvmja,signora-spugna,5,Sat Jul 11 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"As others have responded, there are.  I think any term that you want to describe your sexuality, attractions, and romantic (or lack of) tendencies are valid.  I've been struggling with a label to describe my very selective attraction to women and demi-romantic has been the closest I could find.  But to most people? I just say I'm a heterosexual woman who has found two women in her life attractive.   But I like to label things.  Many people experience these attractions and romantic feelings and don't label themselves either."
asexuality,3cvmja,minnie1008897,2,Sat Jul 11 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I have always been confused about the different types of attraction, and so learning even this little bit (that all of these types of attractions are a spectrum, not just a have or have not) helps me understand my own experiences a little bit more."
asexuality,3cvmja,dragonzflyte,2,Sat Jul 11 05:28:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the pattern if attraction you described with women (I don't know the full depth of it, so if I get something wrong, I apologize) sounds more like heteroflexibility, as on the Kinsey scale. That definition permits selectivity of partners who are same sex, while the subject maintains a general attraction to the opposite sex, which sounds like your case.  Of course, that's just my take. Generally hetero with having found two women attractive in your life works well too. It's just a matter of what communicates what best, and I haven't the faintest clue of how many people are familiar with the Kinsey scale (though it's actually kinda helpful, despite its restrictions).   Personally, I identify as bi, but score on the Kinsey scale as heteroflexible. (Which does match my behaviour.) Bi is just a more convenient term in daily parlance.   But yeah, kudos on the self-exploration!"
asexuality,3cvmja,dragonzflyte,2,Sat Jul 11 13:33:28 2015 UTC,Would it count as heteroflexibility if I require romantic feelings to be sexually attracted though? I think the Kinsey scale is the simplest means of explaining these sorts of things. I'm definitely like a 1.5/2.
asexuality,3cvmja,johannawaves,3,Sat Jul 11 14:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well, speaking for myself, I don't feel romantic attraction at all until I get to know a person, so I'm likely demi-romantic. On the other hand, as mundabit mentioned, I don't have to use that label, and I don't; a general level of specificity is good enough, in my mind."
asexuality,3cvmja,DisneyRulesMyWorld3,2,Sat Jul 11 04:14:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I agree, I think a general level of specificity is good enough, especially if talking to others. But to understand my own experiences, and to understand the experiences of others, being able to know how to correctly label things helps.  I'm not trying to say that everyone should use the most detailed label, but I know that for me, understanding that all of these labels apply to the different types of attractions helps me understand the attractions a little bit more. And it helps me understand myself a little bit better."
asexuality,3cwaf6,ExternalCenter,3,Sat Jul 11 08:48:21 2015 UTC,"The only way to be sure if you are asexual is to ask yourself ""Have I ever experienced sexual attraction?"" If the answer is ""no"" then you are asexual.   Alternatively you may be grey-asexual if you only rarely experience sexual attraction, or demisexual if you experience sexual attraction after an emotional bond has been formed.  From what you say it does sound to me like you are on the asexual spectrum somewhere at least, but you have to decide for yourself what definition suits you best.    Hope that helps."
asexuality,3ctd5o,throw_me_out_again,2,Fri Jul 10 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"Well you know the situation better than any stranger on the internet could. From my perspective, I would never want to be in a relationship with an allosexual -- I've tried it before and has never ended well. I think if you have a fundamental sexual desire which cannot be freely expressed in a relationship, no matter how close you are, eventually it will cause tension and perhaps some heartache.   I'm not saying you two can't make it work. The fact that she said she would probably consent to sex is promising, but not a guarantee, and it might be one time only. The way I would approach the situation is to ask myself, ""Could I be happy in a completely sex less relationship?"" (well, specifically for me as an asexual the question would be ""Would I be willing to fulfil my partner's sexual needs within reason?"" - the answer to which is no -  but your friend's answer might be yes). If you are not comfortable with a sex less relationship then at some point along the line you will probably be upset by having a girlfriend who never initiates sex, or doesn't enjoy it like you do.   Anyway, my opinion on the matter is probably uncommon. I'm strong-willed, and maybe a bit too closed off, but I've made some mistakes in the past which I don't care to repeat."
asexuality,3ctd5o,kevind23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:50:20 2015 UTC,"Welcome! I'm glad people like you exist, it gives me a bit of hope for the countless romantic asexuals like me who are single, haha.   Unlike /u/kevind23, I think an asexual-sexual relationship can work out just fine. Neither of you, however, should sacrifice their desires completely. I don't think having a fully sexual or asexual relationship would work out in the long rong. You have to reach a compromise where you have less sex than you'd like and she has more. This can work if sex is not the most important thing for you and/or the worst possible thing for her.   Also, communicate: talk talk talk. Do you want something? Talk about it. Don't you like something else? Talk about it. Communicating is important to understand what's going on in your SO's mind. And since you two are so different, at least when it comes to sex, talking is the main way to understand each other. You should incite her to speak her mind, too.  You've written she's virgin and she is probably open to the idea of having sex. She may enjoy things she has yet to discover. Many asexuals have kinks that can get them going. It would be good because it would let her enjoy sex more. So experiment various things, not necessarily practically. You can also talk about it and see if she's particularly interested in something. However, don't get your hopes up. She may as well not be into anything.   That's it for now. Nothing else came to mind."

asexuality,3cquc7,kdk13,9,Fri Jul 10 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that my asexuality and aromanticism are at least partly connected to my schizoid personality disorder, so sometimes asexuality can be relevant to a psychiatric diagnosis.  I was misdiagnosed as autism spectrum for years until my therapist (who was knowledgeable about and accepting of asexuality) made the connection - one of the main diagnostic criteria for SPD is a lack of interest in sexual relationships.  I've met several other ace/aro people who have SPD so it's probably something that our community should be aware of.  Both I and my therapist felt that this ""disorder"" is just a natural, mostly harmless variation in human personalities, though, and he never treated my asexuality as something in need of fixing.  So some therapists are cool!"
asexuality,3cquc7,shinkouhyou,4,Fri Jul 10 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, a lot of autistic people are also ace/aro.  I'm autistic and ace.  Not trying to invalidate you or say you're autistic btw."
asexuality,3cquc7,choirsofcacophony,8,Fri Jul 10 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"I definitely have been through very similar experiences with having issues in relationships because of ace erasure. Fortunately I had an LGBTQ-friendly therapist by the time I was ready to be publicly be out. But I still had to educate her - the person who was meant to be guiding me through my conflict stemming from being ace - about literally EVERYTHING to do with my sexual orientation. She had literally never heard of asexuality before. At least, unlike yours, she was willing to listen and actually read the research materials I sent her. I have had much less accepting attitudes with family and friends."
asexuality,3cquc7,mr_fishy,8,Fri Jul 10 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen 6 therapists so far, every single one has attributed my asexuality to depression, even though I am clear to explain that I have a sex drive and as a Grey-A I have felt attraction once and it wasn't a lack of depression that made that possible.  I really struggled to find an ace-friendly gynaecologist to help me with my vulvodynia, a lot of the treatments and resources have a focus on ""enjoying sex once again"" or ""enabling regular intimacy"" which is great for people who are sexually active, But at the time that wasn't me and I was happy about that. Each time a new Doctor would ask ""are you having sex"" and I would say ""No, not at the moment?"" thet would ask ""Why not? because of the pain"" tow hich I would reply ""No, because I don't need sex to make my relationship fulfilling and satisfying, We do as we please as our affection suggests, and at the moment that doesn't include sex"" and 100% of the time my Doctor would say ""I'm glad you and your partner have a healthy relationship despite being unable to have sex, But we'll get that pain managed so you can start having sex again""  That always bothered me. No, How about we treat my pain so that I'm not in pain every day! and how about you accept that I don't need sex, and pain has nothing to do with it.  This is only the beginning of my problems. I've been asexual since birth, But I was raped when I was 22 and everyone I have told about it says ""No wonder you are asexual"" as though the 22 years of asexuality pre-assault never existed, and this asexuality is a new development as a direct result of sexual trauma.  I got an IUD as emergency contraception after the rape, and I've kept it, because why not, and several doctors have taken that as some kind of sub-text ""read between the lines"" for me subconsciously wanting to ""cure"" my asexuality. Because I want to be prepared for sex? I'm not celibate, I just don't feel sexual attraction.  Likewise, when I tell my doctor/therapist about sex i've had, they leap to say ""I'm so glad, I knew this asexual thing was a phase"" again, NO, I am still asexual, I am just a sexually active asexual! Like a lesbian woman who has sex with a man, It doesn't stop her being a lesbian, it just means she has heterosexual behaviour and experiences, while having lesbian attractions and desires."

asexuality,3cquc7,tinycatsays,2,Fri Jul 10 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"I've had to work with therapists before.  Most picked their ""pet problem"" and projected it on me. One was really good; she treated me like an adult, listened to see what my issues really were, and helped me with mental exercises to improve.  I still never worked up the nerve to tell her I was ace. It's something that sometimes contributes to a sense of isolation, but it's neither cause nor symptom. The response in the article is exactly why I didn't say anything. It doesn't need to be fixed, but it shouldn't just be dismissed: it should be acknowledged, and then only addressed if there's something I need to do to help cope with the isolation it can sometimes bring."

But she seems to think that my asexuality stems from childhood trauma, when really it kind of just added to it. I'm like, none of my other ace friends have been though significant hell.  I went to her to talk about the shit that happened to me during the first 18 years of my life and to learn how to deal with it. I'm not interested in trying to change my sexuality. I tried when I was 16. It ended really badly.  But considering she's the most LGBTQetc friendly, trauma specialist in the area, I think she's my best bet. I've only had three sessions with her so far, and I do hope I can educate her enough to work with her."
asexuality,3crtvb,actually_mike,10,Fri Jul 10 06:57:20 2015 UTC,"I would change the language from ""High/Low Sex drive"" To ""Increased Libido"" and ""decreased Libido"" They essentially mean the same thing, But ""sex drive"" Implies a drive to have sex, while ""Libido"" will also cover general increased arousal and drive to masturbate or seek release/distraction.  That's genuinely the only thing I can think of that would make Clue more ace-friendly. I already love that Clue is fairly gender nueteral as far as a menstrual tracking app goes.  The difficulty is in remembering that Asexual=/=Celibate, and I think a lot of celibate ace's also forget that and think that to make something ace-friendly you need to remove sex from it. It' hard because some people identify as ace due to a lack of attraction, others identify as ace due to a lack of desire, some people confuse hypo-sexuality (low libido) with asexuality, and feel comfortable using ""asexual"" to describe their hypo-sexuality. So to make something truly cater to asexuals, you need to consider a lot of different types of asexuals.  Not to mention people who are aromantic who may or may not be asexual."
asexuality,3crtvb,mundabit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"This is extremely informative, thank you. Some follow-ups...  We are making a distinction between arousal (physical) and sex-drive/libido (mental). Do you agree with that separation?  I get most of the rest, i.e. that asexual≠celibate and confusion between asexual and hypo-sexuality.   We have some ways to go to become more gender neutral, and otherwise inclusive to the entire spectrum of LGBTQIAP (and beyond). We are actively working on it.  If you're interested, this article I wrote is getting a bit stale, but it describes some of our early thinking as we started moving towards inclusivity. It doesn't go nearly far enough though, and we can see that now that we're further into the topic."
asexuality,3crtvb,mundabit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"For me libido is also physical, just like arousal, Libido is a craving for sexual pleasure in the general way while arousal is a physical readiness to engage in that pleasure (eg: Erect clitoral tissue, being wet etc) Horniness is a mental craving, as is sexual desire.  But I think that's all just personal interpretation, so its bound to vary person from person. I think the most important part is having options to turn off unwanted features, I know I can't be bothered tracking my libido at all i'd rather not have it clutter up my screen, other may love that they can track it."

I'm not personally interested in tracking things like masturbation, but I like that you're adding the option for others to use.  This isn't related to asexuality, but I would like to be able to track how severe my cramps are.

I like the word ""Libido"" better than sex drive. It's a little more asexual friendly.  I really like the idea of being able to differentiate into different intensities of cramps. That would be fantastic because some months my cramps are almost cripplingly bad and other months they are tolerable. It would be nice to get some sort of idea as to if there is a pattern there.  One thing that might be nice is the option to remove the visibility of some of the tracking options. I""m not particularly sex-repulsed, but I wouldn't mind getting rid of the big ""SEX"" circle when I go into clue to put down any info I have for that day.

Deep meaningful relationships matter and are what I'm pursuing and sex plays not part in it even if I do pleasure myself.  Now I'm struggling to find out if I want more from a romantic side. I don't think monogamy is for me and would be interested in a large relationship group because then I would feel the most comfortable with my partners getting their sexual needs fulfilled by someone we both mutually know and love.
asexuality,3cnu1s,cobylockkills,7,Thu Jul 9 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you looking for help in dealing with? Is it acceptance of yourself?  I'm not sure how many therapists and such are actually knowledgable on asexuality. When I first brought it up with mine, they didn't really know anything. It wasn't really a problem for me though and it's not something I need to talk to anyone about much. I know who I am and that helped me the most. My guess is a A sex therapist type person wouldn't be best, but more so a regular therapist that understands asexuality and can help work through the personal issues that it's giving you? I Hope that make sense."
asexuality,3cnu1s,Terracorner,2,Thu Jul 9 11:02:49 2015 UTC,I've got a troubled past with sexual abuse and molestation when I was young.  I'm not sure if this attributed to my current feelings and sexuality.  I just feel like a failure.  Every relationship I've had has failed due to my lack of wanting to have sex.  I know I'm not gay and there is an attraction to some extent in the women I've been involved in.  I just don't know if there's a resolve by talking it out with a therapist that would help marriage.  I just feel so alone in this and I feel broken.  It's progressed to self harm and suicidal tendencies.  I hate who I am.  I hate the way I make my wife feel.  It's an ongoing battle.
asexuality,3cnu1s,Terracorner,6,Thu Jul 9 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"This may be obvious, but I feel obliged to say it: Asexuality is current fighting for the right to be seen as a legitimate orientation, and it is highly disrespectful to insinuate it is due to mental health; that much is true.  However, I have discovered as a by-product of debating strangers on the internet that oftentimes the only differentiating point between certain aspects related to asexuality and some named sexual disorders is rather or not the individual suffers for it.  It sounds like you are under duress, and wish to be heterosexual instead. In this case, a sex therapist might help. Sure, many of us would loathe the idea of being taken to a sex doctor to be ""cured,"" but for you it would be a happy outcome if you found that you really are heterosexual and abuse or other factors are masking that. Of course, trying to ""cure"" yourself may fail, and you might be asexual regardless of your past. This may not be the best outcome for you, but if you get to that point you can at least hope to silence the voice that might say your past has broken you.  tl;dr I'm not encouraging you to suppress your orientation, but in your case if it's useful/empowering to you, you can take the attitude that your asexuality is a disorder when seeking help; however, it would definitely be ideal to find someone who respects that asexuality is a valid orientation, so they won't try to force you into being something you may not be."

It was I who was saying something possibly controversial, so I was bending over backwards to make it clear that I was not speaking in general when saying you could/should seek treatment for it.  For a lot of us, asexuality is a label that helps us better understand ourselves, and we may take pride in that fact. But if it is, to you, that damn thing that is undermining a wonderful relationship, then you can own the label in your own way and approach it as a problem.   As long as you appreciate that everyone's situation is different here, then you need not fear to share your experience."
asexuality,3cnu1s,derpamine420,3,Sat Jul 11 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"Man, that sucks. I'm sorry you're going through that. I think a regular therapist would be your best bet. You may have to shop around a bit to find one who recognizes asexuality. You may want to have a few academic papers about it on hand to give them, just to show them that asexuality is legit.  Good luck!"
asexuality,3cnu1s,cobylockkills,3,Thu Jul 9 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"You're not a failure, and you're not broken. And you don't have to feel alone. :( Have some pictures of cute animals to cheer you up! Or have some calming music, or try visiting the dawn room. :)  Psychology Today has an online tool for finding therapists that might help you find someone in your area that can help. If you look through the pages for different therapists you might be able to find some that look like they would understand what you're going through, and you can email most of them through the site to test the waters, as others here have suggested doing. (I have depression and was able to find a therapist through this site who knew about asexuality. They didn't list anything about asexuality on their page, but they listed that they could help with ""Gay Issues"", so maybe if you find someone who has experience helping other sexual minorities they might also be more likely to know about asexuality, or to be open to learning about it?)  There's also a site called Asexual Survivors which may help you find someone to talk to who is ace-spectrum and who has also experienced sexual abuse. And here's an awesome metamasterpost of self-help resources that you might find useful, too. :)  I really hope you're able to find someone who can help! And I'm sure everyone here will support you in any way we can. Best of luck!"
asexuality,3cnu1s,Pezman97,2,Thu Jul 9 17:06:55 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I was able to find a therapist and have an appt set for tomorrow.  I'll also be trying another therapist in a few weeks as they seem to take a different approach to things.  Thanks for your kind words and resources.
asexuality,3cnu1s,glilimith,3,Fri Jul 10 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"I noticed you mentioned self harm, suicidal ideation, early childhood trauma, and intense feelings of shame. Based on these points I think dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) could be a good fit and really helpful for your issues. I wouldn't expect your therapist to be well versed in asexuality, but learning how to manage your feelings, process the trauma, and reduce your feelings of shame will likely help you come to understand yourself much better, whether you end up identifying as asexual or hetero underneath all that pain."

asexuality,3cnfmj,falling2geeses,2,Thu Jul 9 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Welcome! The most common definition of asexuality is lack of sexual attraction. Behavior doesn't matter; just like someone can be heterosexual without having/liking sex, someone can be asexual if they have/like sex. Many aces do not have much interest in sex or kissing like you, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're asexual. What matters is how you feel. Are you sexually atttacted to anyone?  One thing I learned when I found the asexual community is that there's more than one type of attraction. There's sexual attraction, romantic attraction (wanting a romantic relationship, but not necessarily a sexual one), aesthetic attraction (liking how someone looks, but not in a sexual way), and sensual attraction (touch). These can all be easily confused, so it can take some time and research to figure out what you're feeling.  To me, it sounds like you could very well be asexual, but that's something only you can decide. Feel free to hang around here, read up, ask questions. I also highly recoomend checking out asexuality.org. There's some great info there and a very active forum.  And remember, while it can be really nice to have a label for yourself, it's okay not to be sure. You are still you, no matter what labels you do or don't use."

A lot of asexuals feel that way. I think you would fit in well here if you choose to identify as asexual.   Also what are Aces? Is that a term for Asexual people?   Whoops, sorry about that. You are exactly right. Ace is a casual term for an asexual person. Sometimes it's an umbrella term for anyone on the asexual spectrum (including gray-asexuals, who rarely experience sexual attraction, demisexuals, who only experience sexual attraction after a close emotional bond is formed, etc)."

I feel like if I had more libido, I might not be asexual anymore, and I do have a little bit of interest in sexual activities. I feel disappointed when looking at pornographic material and feeling little to no arousal.  In fact, it's not just looking at sexual things that makes me disappointed at my low sex drive. Nipple stimulation used to make me feel really good and sexually aroused, but now it's subsided a lot and I don't feel that much arousal. Masturbation isn't that much better.

To not have a partner in life because I don't have a romantic one. Often I feel that I would be perfectly happy with a best friend who just wanted another best friend to spend life with even if we didn't spend time together all the time and it was literally just two good friends. But I feel they are all fated to leave me for an SO and a family.   I've made peace with it while also not closing the door on the possibility of finding ""the one"" for me whether it be someone I actually want to have a romantic relationship with or just a good friend who doesn't put me obviously second to an SO and would still feel like a person who would drop everything to help me.

I guess my gf is asexual I have know she was different for a long time and have had some difficulty figuring it out. she dated but never fell in love in her life and if the dating had any kind of fight she ran. I am a stubborn guy and I love her. so wen we had a fight I did not let her run I said it was not  relationship ending event and she agreed but she was out of her element. she had sex but not love. and she would jut as well please herself as be please by me. she never starts sex I have to. and it is good. but she may never feel that love for me I am not sure how this will all work out. but she is willing to work on it with me and I am willing to be understanding. men generally like sex if we have good sex lives with our spouse we feel fulfilled I like romance but it does not happen so I learned to see romance in different ways. like when she askes when am I coming home. the word home has meaning to me it means we are in a relationship. she has said I need to teach her how to be in a relationship and it was true. we have been together for 15 months and it is going well but we had lots of issues. most of them we in learning how to communicate.  you might have more success with a guy older than you he might be more patient and emotionally stable himself and be able to devote a bit more time to learning about you

My family certainly weren't homophobic picketers-- but, from a young age, I grew up with the belief that gay relationships are bad.  I've mostly broken out of that, but not to the extent that I'd be comfortable entering one, even if it didn't involve sex."

asexuality,3cgcui,floydgonzo,3,Wed Jul 8 02:58:20 2015 UTC,"Gender doesn't really matter to me, I wouldn't mind at all having a same sex ""life mate,"" but I feel like I look for women when looking for a partner because most of my friends are heterosexual and wouldn't want to enter into into a some kind of life mate relationship, even if it didn't involve sex. I also think conditioning plays a role, as said before. I could deal with having sex with a woman, but if I was in a relationship with another man it couldn't involve sex just because of the way I've been brought up, I don't think I could do something like that.  So yeah I feel like I look for a partner of the opposite gender because I find it easier than trying to find a same sex partner who wants a sexless and minimally romantic relationship."

In fact, one of my best friends, a guy, and I regularly refer to ourselves as heterosexual life mates.  I do think a formal life partner would be different than a friend, though, so I would tend towards a strong female.  Masculine and feminine personality traits tend to be complementary, so this makes logical sense for me.  Though I'm not looking for a life partner, and feel no need for one, if it ever came to that, the type of woman I would seek is a very androgynous, strong, handsome woman.

Honestly, I can't explain it. As said by comments above, conditioning could play a part. Probably it has to do with growing up in a town where not being straight was welcomed and accepted but just never talked about, like some code of silence. When I was younger, I had no concept that I could be in a relationship with anyone except the opposite gender.  Even now, at a much greater age and with much more worldly experience, I just have never found someone of the opposite sex who I desire romantically. I wouldn't be surprised if I was one day romantically attracted to someone of a different gender, its just never happened to me."

Asexuality is just the lack of sexual attraction, i.e. never having the ""hots"" for anybody or no desire to bang anyone. Romantic attraction is the desire to date someone. For many people, these go hand-in-hand. For example, someone identifying as straight is usually sexually and romantically attracted to the opposite gender, though not always. Also, everything is a spectrum - some may experience attraction towards one person in his/her lifetime or never at all.  For me, I identify as asexual and aromantic. Until recently, I just thought I was a lesbian. Though being sexual and dating a girl never crossed my mind. I do feel more comfortable being around women and do feel some attraction towards women, in a platonic way. It's possible you may be asexual and be romantically attracted to girls. I don't know, only you can decide how to identify. Again welcome, and feel free to explore."

Queer is an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual or cisgender. Originally meaning strange or peculiar, queer came to be deployed pejoratively against those with same-sex desires or relationships in the late-19th century. Beginning in the late-1980s, queer scholars and activists began to reclaim the word to establish community and assert a politicized identity distinct from the gay political identity. Queer may be used by those who reject traditional gender identities as a broader, less conformist, and deliberately ambiguous alternative to LGBT."

asexuality,3c94oj,sadasexual,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"Your story sounds almost exactly like mine except it was me that came across the term asexual approximately six years into our marriage (quite recent) . I have brought it up with him but we haven't exactly had a long conversation about it. And my lack of interest in initiating sex has always been a very sore spot. We also have one child and I'm currently pregnant with our second.   It sounds like you are not opposed to or repulsed by sex and enjoy the romantic (non sexual affection) part of your relationship, so maybe something that helps me can help you too. Whenever I get the feeling we are getting distant or lacking in quality time together (easy to feel this way with little ones taking up all your time and energy), I use that as a trigger to remind myself to initiate sex. It satisfies his desire to feel wanted and usually leads to greater quality time which satisfies my loneliness. From an asexual perspective I never feel like I actually need or desire the act of sex itself but I can engage in it because it leads to more of the romantic and friendship side of things which I value much more. We haven't had a fight about sex in quite a while now so I think my strategy is working to satisfy both our needs.  Some other ideas :  I've given serious thought to setting a reminder on my phone to initiate sex. Haven't actually done that yet though.   Also, I have no idea how open the two of you are but you could consider allowing an open relationship on his side just for sex. But I've had bad experiences with that sort of stuff in the past so I'm probably not the best to advise you there.  Overall it sounds like he's very open (eager even) to working this out with you which is great so I wouldn't be too worried about your relationship falling apart over this. Also welcome to the community :)   Edit: one thing to keep in mind, not sure if it applies to you, is getting pregnant and being new parents can significantly temporarily kill your sex drive. However if this is something that's been for the whole marriage and not just recently then it probably doesn't have much relevance."
asexuality,3c94oj,HCSarise,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry in advance for the life story! I came to the realisation about 2 years ago, about 6 months before we were due to be married. Like you, we met at 14, and were together 10 years when I realised I was asexual. Up to that point, our relationship was perfect aside from the sex issues. It was always one of those topics that would keep coming up and we kept trying different things to see if there was anything that would get me in the mood etc. While we would still have sex (plus foreplay), most of the time it felt like a chore to me, and definitely something I did for him. Sometimes we would go months between sessions, purely because I didn't realise or think about it. Obviously this was a problem for him, as he's got a high libido, plus he could tell I wasn't into it and wondered why. Despite me telling him over and over again that it wasn't him, I just didn't feel anything for anyone, he still felt like it was him, like I didn't find him attractive/sexy. Anyway, 2 years ago, I came across something that mentioned an animal or something being asexual. The sex topic had recently come up again so I was in a bit of a mood anyway, and thought (in a sarcastic kind of way) 'yeah, that sounds like me'. Despite it being a sarcastic thought, it stuck with me and when I got home, I googled it, and was surprised to find that this was actually the problem. Personally, I'd never heard about it in this context, so I was pretty surprised to suddenly have the reason after so long. Like you, I felt relieved, to finally know and be able to have a name for it, but also incredibly sad, knowing that it's never going to change. This is something that 2 years on hasn't changed. I've sort of accepted it, but I still feel like I'm broken and I'm still sad that it won't change. I might get down voted for saying this as it isn't exactly... motivational... but I don't think I'm ever going to accept that this is normal, I feel like I'm always going to view this as something that should be there but is missing. What has helped me recently to accept it in general, is viewing it as a medical problem that just can't be fixed. I actually have another (real) medical problem that has no cure, so I guess I'm used to that idea, but this has helped me to accept it as something that can't be changed, but I can do things to manage it. I don't know why, but viewing it this way helped me to come to terms with it and, while I'm not happy about it, I have accepted it now and feel better about it. Don't take this the wrong way - this is just how I personally feel, and I know there are plenty out there that are fine with their asexuality, so you may feel differently in time. Anyway, onto the good stuff. We did stay together, and despite some difficulties, we did get married as planned, on our 10th anniversary and we're still together now. I think knowing what it is has helped, because it made us talk about things we didn't think about before. For example, now that we know I actually have no idea how he feels when he's really horny (kind of like explaining what a colour looks like to a blind person, I guess), he's started explaining how it feels, in terms that I can relate to, so I feel like I understand him and his needs more. Similarly, he now knows for sure that it has nothing to do with him, and so he feels better in and of himself. As well as that, we've come to various agreements. For example, because the way I feel changes (sometimes I don't mind sex so much, other times I'm really uncomfortable about it), so we have an agreement that I always initiate, but I know I need to make an effort to keep track of it, so we don't go too long. What I've found personally has helped has been getting a Fleshlight. On the days that I'm uncomfortable about sex and him touching me, I can use that on him and he enjoys it as I'm still involved. I think the important thing is that you both understand and accept how each other feel, and try to find compromises. At the end of the day, I don't necessarily want to match his drive, but he still has needs and it isn't fair on him if I'm not willing to try. It sounds like you have an understanding partner that wants to make the relationship work even after finding out, so I'm sure you'll both find a way of making it work, like we have.  TL;DR: Together since 14, found out in 2013 after being together 10 years, now married and still together. Feel like the key is finding your own compromises that work for both of you."

Proximal stressors among sexual minorities of article  Minority stress:       A growing body of research indicates that exposure to distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in LGBT populations. For example, LGBT youth and adults who have experienced prejudice about their sexual orientation sometimes choose to conceal their sexual identity from others.    Concealing such personal information causes significant psychological distress, including intrusive thoughts about the secret, shame and guilt, anxiety, and isolation from other members of the minority group.     Internalized homophobia is another proximal stressor prevalent among LGBT individuals. It refers to the internalization of negative social views about homosexuality, which leads to self-hatred and poor self-regard.   As predicted by minority stress theory, internalized homophobia is associated with exposure to distal stressors, insofar as it only occurs because LGBT individuals are exposed to negative societal attitudes toward homosexuality and transgender.  Rejection sensitivity represents a third proximal stress among sexual minority individuals. Rejection sensitivity refers to chronic, anxious expectations of rejection based on one's stigmatized status. Among sexual minority individuals, rejection sensitivity emerges from experiences of rejection from parents and is associated with internalized homophobia, unassertiveness, depression, and anxiety.   Thus, previous experiences with prejudice are associated with proximal stress among LGBT individuals, including concealment of their sexual identity, internalized homophobia, and rejection sensitivity.

That being said, it certainly doesn't mean that you have to go to a therapist. Like you, I'm sure many people are able to come to grips with it. There are, however, others who may not be able to and would require that external help due to other factors that may not exist in your particular equation (e.g. race, socioeconomic standings, age, gender, past events, etc.).

My first kiss was such a disappointment - 18 year old me expected it to some sort of dulled orgasm feeling. Nope...  The only kissing I find pleasurable is neck kisses done a certain way."
asexuality,3c2uv1,Hanjobsolo1,3,Sat Jul 4 17:25:41 2015 UTC,I don't really like it. Its just boring and awkward to me. I used to like it when I was a young teen when kissing was still exciting and new. But now at 25 its just a bore.

(I think a lot of this is also curiosity,  as I've had sex with him which was 1000x better than sex with other partners and I want to know if kissing is the same)   I've been romantically attracted to everyone I've kissed,  and quick pecks on the lips and cheek,  kissing their neck and so on feels good,  but anything more than a closed mouth pash for 5 seconds feels really strange and uncomfortable.   I get about as much pleasure from kissing my partners as I do from licking my own lips, only it's more awkward."

Please feel free to ask questions here, we are a pretty accepting sub, and most people here give some pretty good advice IMO.  I have not come out to my family. I don't plan on coming out to my family. I know that they will not understand, will think I am being ""childish"" or something else like that.  I had a couple of bad experiences when I first came out, and since then I have always been hesitant to come out.  My family is important to me, but I feel like this is something that I don't need to tell them about. Every time I talk with my mom, she starts out by asking if I have found ""someone special."" I just tell her no and move on.  Many of the arguments I see here are valid, I would even use them against friends, but I could never use them with my family.   Is it worth it?   That depends completely on you. How important is it to you that your family knows? Is them accepting this part of you worth the risk of having to argue with them, having them dismiss this part of your identity because ""you haven't experienced it?"" Or would you rather keep them in the dark about this, and let them accept you based on who they know you to be?  I say that, but it could be that you tell them and they accept you without question. I'm not trying to say that coming out to them will end up with them not believing you, but it is possible. But, as some other people here can tell you, there are a lot of people that can surprise you. You can tell people, and they will accept you without any questions.  In the end, only you can decide whether telling your parents is worth it."
asexuality,3c26hn,osteopath17,5,Sat Jul 4 02:10:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful reply.  Part of me struggles because I am a very honest and open person, and I really don't have many secrets from anyone (for better or for worse!).  So far, it has worked to just say, ""I'm not interested in dating"" and then move the conversation along when it has come up.  Honestly, part of what prompted this is that I am bringing a male friend/neighbor that I've mentioned to my family several times along to 4th of July festivities tomorrow, and I am sure I am going to get a wealth of new questions about it.  As long as they are willing to accept ""not interested"" again, I really see your point about not risking them dismissing something that feels so right and natural to me for the first time in a long time."
asexuality,3c26hn,osteopath17,2,Sat Jul 4 02:33:48 2015 UTC,"I understand being like that, and I can see why this would be a struggle. If it comes to it, you can probably pass it off with ""I'm not interested,"" but depending on your family, they may start to question you deeper.  I will say this. Sometimes I wish I could tell my family. That I could have them understand. But I know that they won't understand. So I don't talk to them about it.  What I would do if I was in your situation (take it as nothing more than that. I don't know you or your family, so I can't honestly give you ""advice""):   Bring your friend for the festivities. Just because your family may question your relationship, doesn't mean you shouldn't have a fun time. If your family does question you, say that you are not interested in your friend in that way. If they keep questioning, tell them that you are not ready for that kind of relationship with this person.   Of course, there will probably be people who will want more explanation. How you deal with that is up to you. I personally would tell them that I am too busy to consider that kind of relationship (a lie, but a believable lie).  I wish you the best in dealing with this. I hope everything works out for you. I hope you don't have to reveal this to your family, but also that if you do, they accept you.  edit: changed should to shouldn't. Because I think you should have a good time, even if people will ask questions"
asexuality,3c26hn,redneckgymrat,3,Sat Jul 4 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the kind advice!  I know that compared to many people, this is a part of my identity that I can easily hide and not risk being misunderstood or ostracized, so I am at least lucky in that regard.  I am not someone who likes hiding who I am, but if I keep relying on the, ""I'm not interesting in dating, I'm perfectly happy being alone"", that isn't untrue.  Thank you again!"
asexuality,3c26hn,redneckgymrat,5,Sat Jul 4 11:55:48 2015 UTC,"What sort of personality do you have?  44M aro-ace.  I have told my mother, but I did not sit her down and have a serious discussion.  Instead I hinted at it, broached the subject, joked about it, and gradually mentioned it in more serious tones.  It is a game, and one very similar to the preparation techniques used by most of my gay friends.  Said in joking tones, ""You know, mom, I've never been that interested in dating or sex.  Well, you're not gonna believe this one.  I found this group online that actually thinks of it as a sexual orientation!  Like homo-sexual.  They call it A-sexual.  People who don't even want sex.  Yeah, (snicker) they even made a flag...you should see the silly thing.""  Then, when the subject is broached again, slightly less joking.  Etc.  That was a few years ago.  Last week I reminded her, on the day that gay marriage was forced on the states, that I am a member of a sexual minority and we should put out a flag!  You see, before you know it, you've mentioned it enough times that it's in her head, and you were gentle enough that it wasn't a horrible shock."
asexuality,3c26hn,ThunderEcho,2,Sat Jul 4 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is what I have sort of been trying to do - reminding her how much happier I have been since I decided that I don't necessarily need to get married and have kids.  She generally responds that she would hate for me to close myself off to something so beautiful etc.  I have generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia, so I was generally just regarded as dramatic with a lack of a filter (still am, but at least there is some foundation in mental health).  Plus I am just different than most of my family in terms of likes and interests, and the only one who was really similar to me is my dad who passed away - something I was working through in therapy.  Thanks for the advice - I am still not sure I will plan on saying anything, but it can't hurt to keep testing the waters like you recommend!"
asexuality,3c26hn,NullificationX,2,Sat Jul 4 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"Well, she's right!  Don't let a label define you.    As we so often say around here, sexuality can be fluid, so there is no reason to let something like a label ""cut you off to something so beautiful.""    Even if you have zero desire for it, and never have.  ;)  All you can do is decide whether or not to tell her.  It's up to her to accept you, and that part is out of your control."
asexuality,3c26hn,iamthelowercase,3,Sat Jul 4 12:03:00 2015 UTC,"I personally haven't told my family so I can't offer any experience on that regard,  but if you're unsure could you maybe try testing the waters to see how they react? Maybe throw out some increasingly related questions and see what their answers are,  especially when it starts to turn more personal.  Back when I was thinking about telling my parents,  I asked my mom what she would think if I never got married. She looked like she was about to cry.  Since I don't consider my sexuality to be a large part of who I am or really anyone else's business, I decided to keep quiet as long as my parents are alive. That's my personal situation though,  your parents may be a lot more open to it,  or you may feel your sexuality is a bigger part of you than I do. I guess all I can really recommend is try to figure out what things are most important to you,  and then feel out the situation. Best wishes."
asexuality,3c26hn,ThunderEcho,5,Sat Jul 4 03:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am lucky at least that I have a sister who my mom can pin marriage/grandchildren hopes on and not get that type of pressure.  I know that my mom worries that I am closing myself off to something beautiful and wonderful etc, and not all of my family even understands why I have to take medicine for my dysthymia for the rest of my life in order to function like a normal human being.  Testing the waters is a great approach, and while part of me wants to just blurt it out, I also know that I can easily just keep saying that I am not interested and shut it down and still live my life the way I want.  Thanks for the advice!"

(Why yes, there have been changes since we last talked, why do you ask?)  New normal perhaps.  I've been...  Yes.  I've been.  You ever had a moment where you go ""oh.  Shit.  How did I not notice that before?""  I just realized that ""I've been okay"" might be overstating things too positive.

asexuality,3c26hn,yellowcake0,2,Thu Jul 9 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Have done this; the result, probably because of my timing (I was trying to put the kibosh on an argument of trying new things/meeting new people), was poor. My family, like yours it seems, has always been very open to whatever lifestyles my sister and I end up being; it doesn't matter if we're gay or straight, my mom would say, so long as our partner is Jewish. Also as seems to apply to you, my mom has said that she doesn't want me missing out on something or doing a disservice to myself by not being with someone.  I went through many hurdles to ""prove"" that my claim of asexuality was not a result of something else: therapy, hormone blood test, discussions about my levels of interest in people of the opposite sex when I was younger... At the conclusion of all that (~9 months), my parents have both just kind of nodded, like, ""Thanks for indulging us."" Recently, when helping my parents move, I had to help my dad move my old crib (which we still had, apparently???) down from the rafters in the garage; I asked why we had it, and my mom said, ""For if you or your sister ever have kids.""  If. Prior to this, it was always ""you'll understand when you have kids."" I think (hope) perhaps that this is my mom's way of accepting that I'm asexual; we've never had a conversation about it following the results of all my hurdles, and I'm uninterested in bringing it up again.  My recommendation? Unless you think it'll add something to the table, or unless you're really really tired of being asked by your parents/family about why you're not with someone, just hold off for the moment. If/when you do decide to tell them, make sure to be prepared for their skepticism and questions; have some sources ready for them to check out so they can understand your asexuality, be ready to struggle with trying to explain to someone something that they don't understand...keep in mind that, for people who are allosexual, comprehending the reverse is very similar to people like us trying to understand why people would want to have sex or be in relationships.  Ultimately, no one can judge how your family will take the news better than you can, so make your decision based on whether or not you're comfortable with them (not) knowing."

The thought of having to do an actual blood test is shocking to me, but I again can understand how the majority of the world cannot comprehend having no sexual attraction when the normal issue is who you are attracted to.  I've at least been trying to ease my mom into it by adding my own ""if""s into the equation just like you and the crib, but after all of the advice here I am definitely not going to rush into anything.  I have a book on Amazon saved that I already read through the previews for and loved - once it comes out on paperback in the fall I think I will buy a copy to read/have around just in case.

We're fighting to have our platonic or romantic partnerships recognised,  because phrases like ""but if you're not having sex what makes that any different from being just friends""  invalidate the love we have for our significant others.   We're fighting to have the risk of sexual assault and corrective rape for asexual individuals recognised.   And we're fighting for support for asexuals who have been a victim of trauma (sexual or otherwise)  to receive psychological and medical treatment without their asexuality being brought into question,  without their practitioner's trying to ""fix that too""   We are fighting the misconception that we are broken,  that we are freaks or robots.   We are fighting the myth that we are emotionless and incapable of love (platonic,  romantic and otherwise)   We are fighting to show that we are no different,  what we do or don't do in the bedroom is no one's business,  just as what gay and lesbian and straight couples do in the bedroom is not the business of others.

asexuality,3c1qbk,NinjaButler,5,Fri Jul 3 23:58:25 2015 UTC,"We're only a protected class in 2 states, so discrimination against asexuals  (not giving us jobs, not renting homes to us, not letting us adopt children etc.) is legal in most of the US (not sure if we're protected in any other country, so most of the world too). Once asexuality is well known in the mainstream, this could be a problem.

asexuality,3c1qbk,NinjaButler,10,Sat Jul 4 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"[I'm not a lawyer, this is just my impression of how things are. Correct me if I'm wrong]  Orientation as a protected class. Laws that protect against discrimination because of sexual orientation either specify heterosexual, homosexual, transsexual (which is really a gender thing, but whatever), and bisexual or are open to individual interpretation. Asexuality is sometimes seen as 'lack of sexuality', so without a supreme court decision that specifically says we are or are not included, we're effectively not included.  Vermont and New York, however, specifically mention asexuality in their anti-discrimination laws."

asexuality,3c1qbk,ZeroDagger,6,Fri Jul 3 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"I think we are a good 50 years behind gay community when it comes to recognition and acceptance. The average person recognizes that homosexuality is real and not a disease or even a choice. A gay person can go to the doctor without fear. Conversion therapy is recognized as unethical for homosexuality, but not for asexuality. So many of us say we don't ""need"" to come out, but when you read between the lines, what we are really saying is that we are afraid to live our lives openly.   We have a lot of catching up to do, and that's why asexuality awareness is so important. Even posting here on reddit is beneficial if it shows one more person that we are real."

Maybe they won't give up, maybe they will give up and then just go talk behind your back.  Then you start to approach and pass 30 - such a pretty woman - such a shame, what a loss, wish they could find happiness, etc etc.  Then you hit your 40's and your coworkers are gossiping being your back ""wondering why you never married or had kids"", and they're ""pretty sure you live alone"".   It is what it is, it's the story it looks like. I'm not going to try to convince people being asexual aromantic is a real thing. What's it going to change?

Where the problem with gays is the response ""Eww... that's so gross."", the problem with asexuals is the response ""Lol, that doesn't exist"". People being grossed out vs people being ignorant. I think we don't have it hard at all.  Another thing is that we could go through our lives without ever telling anyone about it. If you're gay and get a boyfriend, well that needs some explaining. But as an asexual, if people are like ""Why don't you have a partner yet?"", you can simply say ""I haven't found the one yet  ¯\(ツ)/¯"".  At highschool, if you're gay, you might think ""I wish I could walk hand in hand with my boyfriend. But then they'll harass us for sure."" But If you're asexual, it might go like this: ""I wish I could not have sex... wait, I totally can. And for that to happen I need to do.. totally nothing"".  Also in appearance, clothing, hair, asexuals don't change after coming out (at least not for me). We don't look asexual, we don't act asexual.   So again, I think compared to the whole LGBT community, we have the least problems. That said, we have our color on that flag. We have a different sexual orientation than normal people. Not queer enough? That's bullshit. Prides aren't about being the most special unicorn. It's about being treated equally. And it's about time that girl treats you like an equal."

I have a friend who mentioned once or twice in the past that he might be on the LGBT spectrum. And I completely blew his mind by mentioning that I was asexual. He had no idea that orientation existed. And what was his first reaction? He asked me ""have you ever gone to the doctor and gotten a hormone panel done? Maybe your hormones are messed up and it's killing your sex drive.""  Basically, my sexuality was reduced to a chemical imbalance in his mind. He has since accepted that I am asexual and brain chemicals have nothing to do with it, but it was still upsetting."

We get a lot of ""that's not real"" and ""human beings can't be asexual it's against nature"" and those kinds of things really contribute to the whole ""lesser known and therefore not as queer/real"" dynamic. The op said that being asexual definitely isn't something you quite tell people like you do when you are gay/trans*/lesbian and I agree. However, coming out is just as hard but not nearly as supported and talked about. I'm not here to do the whole ""my life/experiences are worse and therefore more valid than yours"" thing, but I do think it's worth mentioning that because being asexual is a lot more low key in some aspects, it makes it a lot harder to find the community that others who are queer can find instantly.   edit: formatting/spelling errors."

Growing up with lesbian parents, I was raised to understand that the LGBTQwhateverotherlettersthey'veadded movement was meant to be something to support and uplift those of us who do not belong to the standardized normal sexuality/orienation/identity of the rest of the people.   The fact that a lesbian is willing, jokingly or not, to say that people who are definitely queer(which literally just means to be strange or an oddity) in terms of sexuality are not queer enough is complete bullshit.  Granted, people who are demisexual, asexual, or gray-ace might not be quite the same ""kind"" of queer as homosexual men or lesbian women, but they are still queer by comparison to heterosexual people."
asexuality,3bkaou,Mulatto_Fury,12,Fri Jul 3 12:24:48 2015 UTC,"Pride doesn't really mean the same thing for homosexuals and bisexuals and pansexuals (etc) as it means in the common vernacular. Queer pride is about the freedom to act the way you feel, to gaze upon the bodies that enamor you without someone screaming violence upon you, to engage in bodily displays of affection and attraction in the way straight people do without punishment or retribution. It's not about being proud, it's about being the opposite of constrained.   We asexuals don't really know that fight. We don't have to 'hold back.' Straight people act like us when they are being polite, or discreet, or tasteful. Straight people never act like gays except as a joke.  And we can't really 'cut loose' into our asexual nature. There's no characteristically asexual action that we normally have to withhold ourselves from doing.   Both of our fights are about the right to exist as we are. But ours is about being perceived as really existing, and their fight is about escaping harm in retribution for their existence. It's not the same, and a lot of people recognize that. There are some similar battles in our wars--people just realizing their orientation and needing support, for instance--but the campaigns are not comparable.  It's hard to be told you aren't part of a group that includes people you love. But sometimes that's the way things are. You can still be an ally, but you can't carry the flag for them."
asexuality,3bkaou,Kaisharga,30,Tue Jun 30 01:37:42 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree that we're not also fighting to escape harm in retribution to our existence. I think being told ""Being gay is a choice"" is fairly similar to ""Asexuality doesn't exist"". Both groups are told they don't exist, their identity isn't valid. Asexuals today get told the same thing the gays of forty years ago get told. It's a symptom of a disease, we just haven't found the right one yet, it's unnatural. Putting yourself out there as an asexual today runs the risk of corrective rape, another thing that other members of the queer community should be able to emphasize with.   Dan Savage once said that an asexual marching at pride was them marching for their right to not do anything, and yes, that is exactly correct. I go to pride and wear my ace identity so that I can tell people I do exist, I'm no less valid, I'm not the symptom of a disease, and I shouldn't have to give consent sooner or later. I go for many of the same reasons other members of the queer community have gone in the past. No, our fights are not identical, but I believe they are similar enough that we need to take our space in the queer community before we can start to get the general population to notice us."

Did she say who fell into which group? Maybe the asexual is queer, the bisexual is sorta queer, and the lesbian is not queer enough?  I would definitely question your friend about what she meant. Make her think about what she said. When one of my friends tells a racist joke, I don't laugh. I pretend I don't get it and ask them to explain it. Maybe your friend has enough privilege that she can find lesbian jokes funny, but I don't feel that we're there yet with asexuality. Explain to her that we are fifty years behind where she is when it comes to recognition and acceptance.   So to answer your question, we absolutely do belong at queer events.

But it is also the case that there may be more groups than ""straight"" and ""queer,"" and we may occupy some yet-unfounded space in that regard. Hence the OP's encounter with being ""not queer enough"" and also not being straight.  What the current queer movement can do (and must do, and does) is tell people they're not in it. A lot of the arguments in here sound like white people trying to join black advocacy groups, because it's a good cause and they can help. But....it's just not their group. Now, there are obvious differences between that situation and ours, but the idea of some people being 'in' to the group and some being 'out' is still important and necessary. The group decides who's which of its purported members are in, and which are out.   OP's friend's vote is that we're out. I'm not really in touch with the general sentiment among the general feeling (of those who are informed) in the movement, but it's clear that our membership, so to speak, is contentious.  Not that that stops us from having our own movement which can work with theirs. Or being their allies even without our own movement."

But people should always take into consideration that being pretty much invsisibly bi (or gay) means you're safe in situations out and visible gay and bi people are not. So, taking this into account, I don't think you should take your lesbian friend's joke to heart.   Also, there are lots of homopbic aces out there (I mean, look at this thread, even! jfc), so I don't blame them for being in general wary of any asexual proudly iding as queer.

Admittedly we do not have the problem of acebashing (to my knowledge), but 'special snowflake syndrome' is something that we are labelled with, along with erasure and such things. No, we aren't oppressed but we are ignored.   Pride is a great opportunity for us to interact with others in the LGBT at large - the actual people who live in that umbrella. By the by, stating that 'heteroromantics are hetero' is idiotic. Yes, we are romantically attracted to the opposite sex, but do you not see the problem there? We do not desire sex with them. For a male (and I can only speak for my own experience as a male) that can lead to homophobic bullying - a 'you are not having sex with a girl, so you must be gay' mentality, if you will. This obviously means that to certain heterosexuals heteroromantics are not hetero in the slightest."

An odd question to be asked about a group that is thought to be accepting and welcoming.  I view them as exclusionary, but since society accepts their version of exclusionary behavior, they're labeled an advocacy group.  Queer space is not a welcoming place for all, and those who believe it is are sadly misinformed.  In theory it should be, but it really isn't.  Instead, look at the LGBT group the same as any other advocacy group, realize they have their own agenda, which is to push the best interests of their own members (as you would expect from any advocacy group), and stop thinking of them as a welcoming umbrella for everybody non-straight.

An asexual guy who only wants to cuddle with females has nothing to worry about and nothing to share with us.  Corrective rape is used on EVERYONE, kids. Not just sexual minorities.

For a decade, the sexual partner was probably pushing for sex, becoming increasingly shrill, and creating a very hostile environment for the asexual partner, too.  It goes both ways.  When the libidos are SO mismatched as you describe, it would not be a pleasant environment for EITHER person.  That they did not break up for a decade actually speaks to the strength and commitment, and frankly the love, each had towards the other.    It's rather beautiful, if you look at it that way."

Romantic attraction, but not sexual...I know it can be confusing for those unfamiliar with the split and that might be why you are having so much trouble understanding the difference.  I'm an aromantic asexual.  No attraction, of any type, to either gender.  Yet in our previous encounter you referred to me as a white hetero-normative Christian male.  (And judging from contextual clues, you used the phrase as an insult, which is a whole different discussion.)  In what way do you justify calling me hetero anything?  It's not like I'm attracted to women."

She made good points, seemed open minded, and even went straight to the source, mentioning asexuality.org and interviewing David.  And she kept it short, concise, and didn't overwhelm the viewer.  Good video.  As for the comments, the negative ones seem to stem from only a handful of small minded bigots.  The belief that they know better implies to me that they think they are open minded, and progressive, and that asexuals should submit to them because of their superior knowledge.  Basically the liberal mindset.  I view them as pathetic, and unworthy of attention, as is true for all bullies."

They dont realize that causes the exact same effect as before the movement (and the sex-negative thought before), ie what they think random people they dont know should do with their bodies. Those who actually take time to actually think about what the movement entails, as lacy green does, understand that the movement should focus on making sexuality a safer and less problematic part of society, not pressure people to have sex or ""change"" them."

Or just take some drugs that make you really horny...   No.   Btw Caitlyn Jenner is asexual!!!   No?   ASEXUALITY IS BULLSHIIIIT......people who claim their asexual are either one of two things:  1.They are akward lonely losers with poor social skills.....who as children did not fit in to social surroundings like school...........they cannot start a proper relationship.....thus they come up with an excuse for it by calling themselfs asexual.....its pretty pathetic but its not their fault.....its the enviroment they grew up in.  2.They are a bunch of wannabe hipsters aka attention whores.........they jump on the band wagon as soon as they think it sounds cool......they try to tell as many people as the can that their asexual so that people will think their interesting.........they think their entiteld to shit....because their a part of a new crowd.....these kind of people are truly disgusting.....pathetic.   No. No no no. No.   asexual doesnt exist unless you are a plant. if you arent attracted to things, you should see a doctor.   Move over fungi, protists, animals, archaea and bacteria! Only plants are allowed to be (technically or socially) asexual!    Biologically Asexual means that an organism is able to reproduce with themselves, it's got nothing to do with not having the desire to reproduce...   Close, but no cigar. You get a D+.    I didn't know what asexuality was, 2 years ago. But then I realized that I can ""heal"" asexual women. My success rate is 30%. That sounds like a small number, but it is much better than other means.

I always took comfort in the fact that being asexual was pretty benign. I'd always thought that no sex at all would probably be safer (when it came to incurring the hatred of ignorant people) than ""depraved"" or ""sinful"" sex. Jesus...

asexuality,3biv9v,bejouled,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that she isn't focused on sexuality at the moment because there is so much going on in her life and she wants to focus on other things.  From what I understood she is not asexual by orientation, she is just not sex-focused at the moment, is choosing to remain celibate for the meantime.   From what I gather, Caitlyn Uses the term ""asexual"" to refer to biological sex, in that she is not looking to change her physical body with surgery.   [A sex change] is so far down the road… I want a free soul, and a lot of great friends. I just want a great life, it’s that simple… Let’s go with asexual for now.   Lets not argue over the fact that this makes zero sense.  In regards to sexual orientation, The interview with 20/20 is unclear   Bruce:I am not gay. I am as far as I know, I am heterosexual. I’ve never been with a guy. Sexuality is who you’re personally attracted to, who turns you on, male or female But gender identity has to do with who you are as a person and your soul and who you identify with inside.  Diane: Are you a lesbian?  Bruce: You keep going back to the sex thing and it’s apples and oranges.   It seems that she simply did not want to comment on her sexual orientation and wanted to keep the focus of the conversation on her gender identity. I'm not sure if she says she is heterosexual as a woman (Ie: She likes men) or if she is saying she is heterosexual as a man (Ie: she likes women) but she later says she is not a lesbian. It's very unclear so we can't assume anything until she wants to let us know. What's important is that she is happy and able to be herself now."

asexuality,3bcrl6,chancebeloud,9,Sun Jun 28 16:55:01 2015 UTC,"This is probably an extreme case, but I think most people here have had someone tell them at some point that there is something wrong with them. Most of my friends were very accepting, but one insisted that it was just a symptom of one of my medical conditions and it would change after treatment. For the record, yes I am sick, but there is no evidence that it effects my libido or sexual preferences. I've also been accused of lying for attention or told that finding the right person would ""cure"" me, one guy even threatening to ""cure"" me against my will when I wouldn't go out with him. I think this is a fairly common experience in LGBT circles as well.   The main problem is that I think since asexuality doesn't have much visibility in the media that many asexuals don't realize that it is a possibility. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was some sort of sociopath or dismissing my (lack of) sexuality as shyness or depression. I was very relieved to find AVEN because it meant there wasn't something wrong with me. But even with a community, even with people who support you, the naysayers stick out in your mind. The one person out of ten who says that I'm sick or lying can bring back all that doubt and fear that I felt about my own identity."

I can happily say that I really don't think I've contributed to any negativity in ways like the comic, hopefully all forms of sexuality can get some more media coverage so it becomes taboo to down talk someone sexuality, regardless of the kind.

I had the same thing happen to me, only it was a threat he carried through with. The event left me homeless (as he was my landlord) and too mentally unwell to work for several weeks.   Even though I was an asexual before I was raped, whenever I mention the rape to a therapist they always say ""ah, no wonder you are asexual, well, we will have to focus on that then, so that you can have a healthy sex life"". Its incredibly frustrating, I want to talk about how the rape has made me distrustful of people who look and act the way my landlord did, I don't care if I panic during sex because I don't want sex, never have, so lets focus on what the rape actually did to me, and not try and fix something that has always been like that, and isn't actually broken."

The Comment Section:  A dissection and rebuttal of negative comments on the Huffington Post asexuality series.  This topic also came up at the conference last weekend:  There was an entire session on the topic.  We also talked about anon hate and dealing with negative comments that are directed at asexuals:   Use the block feature.  Most social platforms have them. You do not have to respond.  You can simply delete.  Responding to anon hate has to be done publically, which gives them the attention that they’re looking for. It may be sent to you, but it’s not directed at you.  These people typically do not know who you are.  Although it’s painful, they’re just recycling the same, tired nonsense they use against everyone else. Much of it’s not even specific to asexuality:  You’ll hear the same comments against gay people and trans people and virtually any other group.  Sometimes they’ll blame politics or a lack of religion or something else completely irrelevant. It can start to lose its sting and its power once you start to see through it."

It's also important to realize that sexual and romantic attraction can exist independently of each other. For most people, they are in sync and treated as one in the same, but here, it's often very useful to consider them separately. Forgive me if you've heard this already, but it's one of the most useful things to take away from this subreddit.  I'm not you, but from what I can glean from your post, it sounds like you might be trying to reconcile your interest in men with your lack of desire for sex. It may be that your interest is purely romantic.  Edit: forgot the last line."

Good luck, and hope you find a label that suits you!"

asexuality,3b8dk7,osteopath17,6,Sat Jun 27 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"I've found something on TVTropes regarding that topic. It's about the video game series Dragon Age:   While the romances aren't obligatory, and thus all three protagonists can be portrayed this way, The Inquisitor can actually be played as being asexual but not aromantic, depending on who they romance. While many of the romances are very obviously sexual in nature - Sera and The Iron Bull in particular - there are romances that subvert that and can therefore be interpreted as non-sexual relationships, for players who would prefer this. No sex scenes are depicted with Josephine or Solas (leading some people to believe that they could be asexual as well), and when propositioned by Dorian, there is the option to insist that things are going too fast and the Inquisitor would prefer to romantically commit himself to Dorian first. Fem!Hawke can also be played like this if she romances Sebastian Vale, due to him being a Chaste Hero.   Another video game example, also from TVTropes:   Suggested with Virginia in Magical Diary - she repeatedly insists she's not interested that way in anyone, male or female. Even if you manage to enter into a romantic relationship with her (which isn't easy), at the end it comes out that she'd really rather just cuddle.   Still, the other examples there are mostly people who aren't interested in the first place (or not human at all)."

Any of the moirail relationships in Homestuck, (it's a faux game webcomic,) could arguably be thought of as asexual romances. They hug and calm each other down and cuddle in piles of bicycle horns and talk about feelings, (you'd have to read it it's great,) and are just all around adorable best friends to each other. In the comic there's a race of trolls that have four different kinds of romance, with matespriteship being like ""normal"" human romance and being generally sexual in nature, and then with moirallegience being treated by trolls as a type of romantic relationship, (they generally only have one moirail, and they have breakups and stuff it's sad,) even though to us uncultured humans moirails just look like somewhere between best friends and, maybe, siblings, since they're platonic relationships. Or they may look a bit like romance without sex or kissing to humans who have a concept of such a thing.  Anywho, I really like Homestuck, so. :) And I love the idea of moirallegience! I write fiction sometimes too, and it will definitely serve as inspiration for how asexual couples might act if I write any stories about that. Or just friends who aren't romantically or sexually involved but who still share a special bond they don't have with anyone else. The comic is insanely long, but if you read it I think you may enjoy it. :)"

Am I just some cis guy who had some bad experiences and needs to get over it or could I accurately be described as ""asexual""?

Their nuances and inner workings aren't relevant to my life.  Words are artificial constructs used for communicating for practical reasons, but ultimately they don't define us, they can't because words are static simple things, while a person is complex, nuanced, and dynamic.  But it sounds like you are second-guessing your preferences, you see them as evidence you are ""broken"" and it's all ""just a phase"".  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, so what?  Just be you, right now.  Changing your mind is okay.  It's not a failure if you define yourself now and then change later.

Presumably there are other possible combinations, besides just adding the ""celibate"" modifier.

asexuality,3b8w4f,claireiseva,2,Fri Jun 26 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"The most common definition of ""asexuality"" is ""lack of sexual attraction"". Behavior doesn't matter--some asexuals have lots of sex, some are repulsed by the thought. Some masturbate, some don't. Some pursue relationships (sexual, romantic, or otherwise), some don't. What matters is how you feel. Are you sexually attracted to anyone?  You may want to look into gray-asexuality, which includes occasional sexual attraction. Many people who feel ""sort of"" asexual use this label if full asexuality doesn't seem to fit. People who experience sexual attraction but don't want sex may find this label helpful.   Remember, only you can choose to label yourself. And while labels are useful in some ways, it's okay not to be sure.

If you've never seen a stranger and desired them carnally, that's usually an indicator. You may not need this clarification, but this is the only type of attraction asexuality, on its own, refers to.  I'm no expert on demisexuality, but what you described does resemble it. For instance, I've heard some demis describe a growing attraction to a character in a t.v. show, but not the actor, after ""spending time"" with them.  When you say, you are attracted to people after learning their personalities, does this refer to getting to know people personally on an emotional level, or is it just a matter of just learning their personality, like a celebrity for instance?  If it's the former that's another hint at demisexuality. If it's the latter, I'd guess at some kind of sapiosexuality, since I've always though of demisexuality as a more emotional connection.  Oh, and aesthetic attraction seems to be the norm at times around here; it doesn't subtract from asexuality."

However, some LGBT people do discrimimate against aces, often because they are not well-informed about us and/or think we're not ""queer enough"".  If the term ""queer"" is helpful to you, I say use it.

To me, the term ""queer"" captures the sense of alienation I felt growing up, particularly in high school, and which I guess I still feel today to an extent.

However, I do see queer as being a reclaimed slur that specifically refers to people who are attracted to the same gender or who are gender non-conforming so I'd feel weird about cisgender heteroromantic asexuals using it. As someone else has said there isn't really any discrimination against asexual people, just a degree of invisibility, ignorance of what it is, and social pressure to be in a relationship/have kids (which many 100% straight people experience too).

Its the same issue that people have with bisexuals with opposite sex partners or gold star gay elitism, I assume.  ie visibility for asexuality is low, but never has been higher, so people dont realize that ace people have been in the community for a long time. However, since theyve already been there, people dont think they need or deserve their own place.  Especially since that would include heteroromantic people who arent attracted to the same sex, which colloquially isnt very gay.  queer still is a slur so people will still get defensive about you calling yourself that."
asexuality,3b4nbu,PrimaDonne,2,Mon Jun 29 15:30:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! How do you know asexuals have been in the community for a long time, though?"
asexuality,3b4nbu,ace_detective,2,Tue Jun 30 02:42:30 2015 UTC,"I've been in the community for a little while, since before the -romantic distinction became a concept. Once that happened there were a few people questioning or changing how they identified. Before that, someone who dated both men and woman would just be bisexual, and for simplicity's sake they might still say they're bisexual, but they would feel now that they're an asexual biromantic. So people see that people like this already have a space, why are they entitled to a different one?"
asexuality,3b4nbu,maiqthetrue,2,Tue Jun 30 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"I am a grey-asexual, hetero romantic, cisgender woman. I found out about asexuality just over a year ago.   Personally, I feel mostly straight. In my head, and to other people, I explain it as ""straight but asexual."" I don't really feel like the label ""queer"" fits me personally. I do feel like I'm part of the LGBTQ+ community.  I don't think that being only attracted to the opposite gender automatically makes you straight. If I were grey-aromantic, but only towards guys, I don't know if I'd still consider myself straight.   I can understand people being frustrated with hetero (romantic/sexual) or aro-aces using the term queer. At the same time, I've been seeing it more and more used as a general term for people who aren't cisgender, heterosexual, and heteroromantic. In a couple years, it may be more generally accepted in the LGBTQ+ community for aces and aros of any type to identify as queer.  I know three people who are on the ace-spectrum. One is aromantic, two are homoromantic, and I'm heteroromantic. Two of those were in my friend group by coincidence (none of us knew the others were ace, and I didn't even know I was before we became friends).  I went to pride, and I watched the pride parade, the opening ceremony kind of disappointed me. They had several pride flags up, including a few pride flags for various kink groups, but not the ace or aro flag. I was happier with the parade. Most of it, I was watching, and happy for the people having fun, and enjoying the atmosphere, but feeling a bit out of place because all of these people were proudly showing off their sexualities, and I felt invisible. But once the asexual/aromantic group came by, I was so happy.   Asexual and aromantic people need some sort of inclusive space. We don't experience dating or  sexuality in the ""typical"" way. We have some amount of disconnect from how they are portrayed in the media, and how people as a whole talk about them. We don't have the visible oppression, but we still have threats of and completed corrective rape, claims that our identity doesn't exist or is unnatural, and overall feelings of alienation from the cis-het community.  We have a place in the LGBTQ+/GSM/MOGAI community. I don't know if it's appropriate for cisgender, hetero(romantic/sexual) aces or aros to use the label ""queer,"" but if someone feels it's appropriate for them specifically, I don't think we should bar them from that."
asexuality,3b4nbu,annabelgoddard,2,Thu Jul 2 04:10:06 2015 UTC,"I'm asexual, but I am GSM, not LGBT.  To me, the latter implies that I'm oppressed in some way, that I can be discriminated against, or that society looks down on me.  It's not really true of asexuals, and therefore I think for us to claim that label and those symbols is as rediculous as an Italian claiming the NAACP as his identity.  The Italian experience of being an immigrant is worlds away from a black guys experience of being followed in stores, harassed by cops, and denied economic opportunities that most whites take for granted."

You can rent an apartment and no one will kick you out for not having a partner.  In short, you are as queer as a regular old allosexual cis guy. As in, not.

I'm not sure ""heteroromantic privilege"" is completely accurate either, though? We're talking about privileges that heteroromantic aces, heterosexual aros, and aromantic asexuals all enjoy, I think, and which heteroromantic and heterosexual trans and some non-binary people lack, right? So some non-straight people have the privilege, and some straight people lack it, so either label seems somewhat off to me.  But none of that really has anything to do with ExtraWingyScapula's main point, which is that I am, (and other non-LGBT aces and aros are,) privileged. I don't have any problem acknowledging my own privilege, so, I'm not sure I have anything to take issue with there. I guess I could say I do think some aro/het-romantic asexuals face similar problems to many LGB individuals which I'm not sure ExtraWingyScapula knows they face? But it seems probable that we're often safer, and I haven't personally faced any of the stuff that comes to mind, so I'm not sure it's my place to bring it up, at least in the context of the present discussion."

How much time is spent on this forum helping new aces get a label? At least 5 threads a day.   Exactly. As I said above, these are people who have experiences different from the norm and are looking for a community to share their experiences and a label to reflect that. Many of them end up identifying as ace. Some of them find ""queer"" to be a meaningful and useful label for them, either instead of ""asexual"" or in addition to it. Identifying this way doesn't detract from the queer community. On the contrary, it adds new perspectives and diversity."

I wonder if this would hold true for all asexuals, or if the oil is simply providing something in which you were personally lacking?  There is no single identified cause of asexuality, so I question if there could be a single cure?  And, do be careful with your word choices.  Cure implies it is a problem needing to be fixed.  As some of the other guys said, cure is a rather offensive word.  It carries some very negative connotations around here.

I'm a horseback rider AND a librarian and the jokes about being a ""sexy librarian"" and the sexual jokes about horseback riding -- that turns me off immediately. I get really uncomfortable when there's a romantic or sexual expectation right away, if that makes sense.  Otherwise... I don't feel like it's that different. I need someone who can be a friend as well as a romantic partner."
asexuality,3az3bj,juniwolf,7,Wed Jun 24 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"For me, it's all about personality. Since sexual attraction isn't a factor, I'm not really concerned with looks. Cleanliness and taking care of oneself is important still, but it doesn't matter to me if he's attractive or overweight or anything.   What really matters is if he can make me laugh, if we can have intelligent conversations about things, and that we can comfortably lounge in the living room doing our own things - him playing video games, me reading a book, or whatever."

I'm upfront with them about where I draw the line and most men I've been with were happy I told them before things got serious. Then I look for a man I can grow as a person with. I want someone who I don't have to pretend for, and I want them to feel the same way. There are not many more frustrating things in a relationship than being upfront and honest, having the guy say he is totally fine with it and then a couple months down the road they start pressuring me physically and suddenly don't understand why I don't want to go to the next physical level. I love romance, but romance doesn't equal sex, and if men don't understand that it makes big problems for my relationship with them. They also struggle to understand that if I decide to kiss or even make out, that may not happen again for a long time and won't happen consistently, which is a truth I make sure a man knows before I go there. Other than that, I look for the classics: common interest, similar life goals, life style, financial responsibility and ambition, how well they get along with my family, and looks (to a point). That's just me tho, not sure about my fellow aces.   Edit: for clarification, when I said ""looks"" I am thinking about our future children (which will almost definitely be achieved via a lab and not sex) and not so much wether I'm attracted to them. I'm sorry if that's confusing, I'm mobile and it's late here."

He has to understand that no only will I probably not have sex with him, but that I will date other people (and I expect that he will too, and of course would be free to have as much sex with others as he wants).  He pretty much has to be kinky, bonus if he's a sub/bottom (but I am open to switches or dominants who understand that I don't sub/bottom - we can always co-top).   He should have a sense of adventure, because while I love solo travel, it might be fun to have a companion. He needs to either have a strong personality or understand that I'm in charge. I need someone who is politically aware, if not active. Left wing only. I'm into metal, punk and industrial, he should be too. I'm going to echo others who said no sexist BS, I'll add no racists. Good sense of humour, I love sarcasm and I have a bit of an odd/dark sense of humour.

That said, I do have a bit of a checklist to cover minimum requirements/non-negotiables for me to even consider someone romantically:  If not also asexual, his sex-drive needs to be almost non-existent.  Must never want kids, ever.  Similar level of intelligence to myself.  And capable of giving me alone time without freaking out. It doesn't take long for me to tire of social interaction, and constant clinginess is going to make me resent someone, not fall in love.

He has to be open to trying different foods, because I love to experiment in the kitchen. He has to have good hygiene (that includes washing hands after using the washroom...) and be fairly tidy. He has to be willing to help out with things and open to talk about any subject, since my mouth has no real filter. I prefer men who are fairly calm (low levels of aggression), but at the same time fairly dominant.  One more difficult thing... he has to enjoy cuddles and kisses. I'm pretty needy when it comes to that stuff. I love cuddling, kissing, fooling around... as long as it doesn't lead to sex 99% of the time.

The AVENwiki is great, but giving people those two links is like handing them an encyclopedia about a topic they know very little about and showing them the glossary. It would be much better to link the the asexuality page since it contains links to topics people might not have known about (e.g. different types of attractions, romantic orientations, gray, demi, sex-positive/neutral/repulsed) and send them down the rabbit hole.  It feels like the sidebar at its current state is for people who already know enough about asexuality (linking to related subreddits, some ace terms explained, and a few links for people who already know that they are ace). That's great for aces, but there are people who come here and want to learn what asexuality is (to understand their partner, friend, family, or themselves better). The first thing they'll read is probably the sidebar.   I mean, the sidebar doesn't even include the definition of asexuality. I've seen ""am I asexual"" posters who might not know the definition of asexuality or they have their own definition (e.g. not wanting any kind of relationship). If they're lucky, someone will comment the definition. If not, the commenters will assume OP knows the definition already.  Honestly, I think the sidebar needs some major changes.  TL;DR This subreddit is for people who know what asexuality is and assumes so. The sidebar has many problems so let's change it.

My friend who is demisexual has behaviour that's very similar to mine. But our attraction is completely different. I feel sexual attraction in passing several times a day. If I'm in a crowded festival with lots of people, I could feel it a hundred times a day. The fact that, so far, I only have sex  within a relationship doesn't stop this attraction from occurring. My friend also only has sex inside a relationship. But she literally only has sexual attraction to the one person she's in love with.  Since sexual orientation is about attraction, I  think it's fair to distinguish demisexual as its own identity. It really is very different from somebody who's fully sexual. And obviously, it's different from somebody who's asexual."
asexuality,3ao9vx,BlueBerryJazz,4,Sat Jun 27 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when people describe demisexuality it sounds pretty similar to having a responsive desire style.  Many people don't know about spontaneous vs. responsive desire, and assume that sexual desire ""should"" be spontaneous, so then when they don't feel that, it seems like a big deal. I get the impression that some people find the term demisexual and latch onto it because it's a form of vocabulary that normalizes their desire style.  However, since I've never considered myself to be demisexual and I haven't conducted research into the desire styles of people identifying as demisexual, I can't speak on the matter with any authority.  People should be free to use whatever labels help them to process their own experiences."

I experienced the same confusion as you because I'm very very strongly heteroaesthetic (i'm a woman that is very attracted to men aesthetically...NOT romantically or sexually).  I can find beauty in both genders (and even in non-binary genders...hey, beautiful folks are beautiful folks to me!) but I have a particular attraction aesthetically to certain striking men....I worked as a freelance artist in college and i have an art minor...so I assume that's where that comes from.  If you are familiar with AVEN you'll see that there are many different levels of attraction.  Sexual, romantic, aesthetic, platonic and probably more I cannot think of, and all of us consist of a happy fun mix of all those attractions or an absence of any of those attractions at once.  I cannot tell you what you are, no ne can...you have to know thyself and call yourself what you are comfortable.  but it's good to begin to break down your own psyche and evaluate yourself on all those different attraction levels and you'll understand yourself a lot more and you'll know where to place yourself on the spectrum.  Also, your sexual drive is a whole other thing separate from sexual attraction.

Similar to your situation, my friend planted in my mind that I might be asexual; I'd heard of it before, but I had never really considered it applied to myself before.  I was enthusiastic about it, but also doubtful because I was wondering if I was unconsciously trying to find something that made me stand out from the crowd I was in when I went to high school, but lots of research, careful thinking, and a month later, I was eighteen and asexual.    I masturbate as well, because it's fun, and I wouldn't be opposed to sex, but it's pretty intimidating to me.  I'm nineteen now with a boyfriend; he has no problem with me being asexual, and he doesn't mind that we don't do anything of a sexual nature more than make out.  Unfortunately, when we do he becomes very sexually attracted to me and has to stop the activity because he's worried about going further than I want to.  This roadblock is pretty unavoidable if you find yourself dating a sexual girl, but it's not a huge deal if she's willing to work it out with you (and if she's not, is she really worth dating anyway?).  I think ultimately, it's all about what label you want to use for yourself, if you even want to use a label.  You're the ultimate decision maker for yourself."

Also included a Wikipedia link, which helps with their immediate questions and gives a bit of credibility to the notion. They took it all quite nicely, they were mostly glad that I spoke to them for once.  One thing I also did say was that I did not particularly felt that concerned them, it's my sexuality after all, and that I was comfortable with it and not struggling.

Around 1% (and possibly more) of the population is asexual.  Asexuality =/= celibacy. Some asexuals have sex.  Some asexuals masturbate.  It's not ""just a phase"".  We are not incapable of love. Many of us are romantic, and the aromantics are capable of platonic love.  We're not secretly gay and afraid to admit it.  We're not all socially inept.  We haven't just ""not met the right person yet"".  We're not trying to be ""special snowflakes"".  Being asexual doesn't mean your life is any less complicated or easier than a sexual's.

'Could asexuals be harmful to the LGBT community?', and there's more nonsense under the 'asexual' tag on her blog. It's two years old but she's fighting people about it as recently as March. I'll try sum it up in case others don't want to click, basically;  Eligibility for membership to the LGBT club is based on you being attracted to the same sex and/or having a gender identity that does not match your biological sex. If you fit into at least one of these boxes then you're already in the LGBT community, so you can stop complaining and forget the 'A' word. Cis hetero asexuals need not apply, and can stay at home with the bisexuals' opposite-sex partners during Pride.   Personal suffering is something of an entry requirement too but because asexuals aren't oppressed, they have to 'appropriate' queer oppression. Since gays and lesbians have 'fought and died' so gay sex can be considered 'normal', welcoming asexuals is granting them a platform to preach their repressed, sexless agenda and confuse impressionable homosexual children.  Finally, asexuality doesn't count as a queer identity or 'legit' sexual orientation because it can be explained by: either an untreated medical issue that's affecting your sex drive, or - more likely - the subconscious repression of your natural sexual desires out of internalized homophobia. I.E. you're not really asexual, you're just a unhealthy person in need of Viagra, or a gay person who refuses to see the closet."

asexuality,3aejq3,Malzair,7,Sat Jun 20 08:38:29 2015 UTC,"YUP. And the bit where she suggests there's a underlying medical reason that explains asexuality just reminds me of corrective therapy.   Even though her and others' opposition seems to be against cis hetero (and, for some reason, male) people joining the community, it's clear that asexuality isn't queer or different 'enough' to warrant inclusion for them anyway. I wouldn't feel comfortable in a community that didn't consider such a that part of some one's sexual orientation to be important or relevant.   I really don't get how anyone could consider some one like me - a bisexual woman in a sexual and romantic monogamous relationship with a straight man - to be 'more queer' or more deserving of inclusion than some one who is asexual and/or aromantic.  Like, I'm included because although I'm in a 'hetero' relationship, I have homosexual ""potential"", but they would be excluded even despite their non-____sexual ""guarantee""? Makes no sense  edit: I'm trying to find a bright side and all I'm coming up with is that at least it took as long as 22 years for me to come across some one like this. :/"

asexuality,3ae36g,millank24,6,Fri Jun 19 11:02:06 2015 UTC,"I don't really feel any attraction to anyone   It sounds like you could be asexual. The most common definition of asexuality is not experiencing sexual attraction. Some asexuals feel the way you do about sex, while some are repulsed by it, and others enjoy it. Many asexuals still experience aesthetic attraction (finding people nice to look at, but not in a sexual way), and some experience romantic attraction (wanting to have a romantic relationship with someone).  You may want to take some time and read people's stories here and at places like the Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (asexuality.org) to see if you can relate to them. Only you can decide if you're asexual. Even if you decide you're not, though, it sounds like you still have a lot in common with many of us, and you're welcome to hang out in our community if you find it helpful.  In the long run, the label itself doesn't really matter. What matters is how you feel. Have you tried talking to your boyfriend about this? Communication is super important in all relationships, but especially ones with a mismatch of sexual desire."

A lot of movies have romance plots that don't have any real purpose, they're just there so that there can be a romance plot. That bugs the hell out of me.  But I don't mind the existence of romance plots, or even their prevalence, if they're worked into the story well. It is a big part of many people's lives. It just glares when it's shoehorned in without regard to the importance, or lack thereof, of romance to the story in question."

I love the build up of the romance, the back and forth maybe-maybenot tension between two people, but I get bored whenever sexual attraction enters the picture. Like if I'm reading a book and Protagonist looks at Romantic Interest and starts thinking about how lovely her legs look, or how sexy he smells when he's sweaty, or the size of her breasts, or his muscle-y chest when he loses his shirt for whatever reason, I just drop out of the story.  My favorite romance is of the Jane Austen sort, where you have these two characters gradually learning about each other and developing a relationship that grows deeper as time goes on. And sometimes there are misunderstandings and mistakes and miscommunication, but eventually they sort their shit out and realize ""Oh wait, I guess I like this person."" It just feels more believable to me, but I guess that's just because I find it more relatable. ""Love/lust at first sight"" is so strange to me, I can't imagine falling for someone without knowing them first."

Haha, I even read LotR as a sort of romance because I shipped Aragorn/Eowyn and it was bittersweet for me that they ended up with different people.   And yes, I read period romance novels. Georgette Heyer, Jane Austen, Barbara Cartland (the earlier ones), even recent ones like Julia Quinn which has the obligatory sizzling romance parts in modern novels. Julia Quinn's writing, the way her characters develop are convincing enough that it makes the sex have some sincere emotional depth... Perhaps I am demi after all. ¯(°_o)/¯"

I don't mind romantic sub plots, as long as it works with the story. If it's more realistic, I can even enjoy it.  I tend to fast forward through the sex scenes, as it seems that most of the time I'm sex repulsed. They just make me feel uncomfortable, in a ""I just ate something bad"" kind of way."

That one just makes me happy for some reason. They lie, snark and deceive, but they always work it out. They know their own faults. It also took a while for them to get together, despite initial attraction. Am I wrong or is that just a way more healthy relationship than most other TV and movie couples?  Most other times I just skip the romance stuff and don't really watch sitcoms where it's all about dating."

asexuality,3aby7m,Terracorner,3,Thu Jun 18 21:27:08 2015 UTC,"Sexual attraction in media plays out to me like an irritating mechanic in a video game: the interesting part of the plot puts on the brakes because the two attractive actors recognize both their characters are played by attractive actors, and that takes priority over anything else they might think of each other.    I think it's even worse for me when it isn't filler and starts being a plot point. I'd imagine it's like my view of violence in media: I won't censure something for being too explicit, but when a story that could rely on it doesn't, I'm impressed.     Similarly, if it can write character motivators and relationships without playing romance as the, presumably universally relatable, wildcard, that makes a very good impression."
asexuality,3aby7m,dragonzflyte,2,Thu Jun 18 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, the romance itself doesn't irritate me, but it's super annoying when romance is used as a sloppy reason for stuff happening, or when there's no depth beyond that."

What I understand even less is shipping in fandoms. Why are some people so obsessed over what fictional character should form a couple with  another?   These 2 seem related,  so maybe romance is that important?"

I especially get annoyed when it's a book filming and they make one very insignificant character one of the main characters just so that there can be a love interest.

Some romantic attraction, a subplot that shoehorns in nicely, yes.  Sex scenes, and especially gratuitous ones?  No.  Jurassic Park had decent sexual tension that made sense.  In Star Wars, the years long growing romance between Anakin and Amidallah provided context.  And, I must admit that I have a fondness for the almost psychopathic detachment of James Bond and his skillful use of sex as a tool/weapon.  It's a common weakness and seems as if it could be easily exploited.  I recognize and accept that sex is a primary motivator for most people.  It should be present in movies.  Thanks to TiVo, hallelujah, I am not forced to watch it."

I totally followed the casting for season 1 and was so excited about the show but then stopped watching after the first season because I felt like there were just too many unnecessary and blatant sex scenes. They even added that Ross character for the show, idk, for more boob airtime. Up until season 5 they pair characters up that was not in the original books, that make me feel the same as OP in the sense that the story seems to have to meet a quota for romance or something.  The books contains a lot of sexual content too, but these don't bother me because it fits the context. I even read historical romance novels, and as long as the characters are portrayed, and there are semi-logical events that lead the characters into the sexual situations it's even interesting to me. As long as it adds to the story or character, and it's not just slapped on as if it's to meet some quota for sex or some sexual tension scene, it doesn't bother me."

My ex-housemate once argued with me about my asexuality,  telling me that he could fix it,  if I just gave him one hour he could fix it.  I laughed it off,  told him there's nothing he could do in an hour that my ex husband and I didn't try in 5 years,  I'm not broken,  I'm just not attracted to people.  He later assaulted me,  attempting to ""prove""  that I like sex by forcing himself on me,  causing bodily harm and traumatising me. I still have panic attacks when my boyfriend leans in too quickly to kiss me, and I can't have sex standing up because it triggers me.  I've always enjoyed sex for reasons other than attraction,  but not so much anymore."

Not much of a story, no conflict, no resolution, just a shrug and a 'huh, sounds about right'.  I discovered the term through a webcomic, I think. Might have been somewhere else first, don't really remember, but the webcomic sticks in my mind. Girls with Slingshots, specifically around the time Erin was introduced. The word wasn't said in the comic for a long time, but was used in discussion about the character much earlier, by the comic's creator."

When I was 14 I discovered AVEN and discovered romantic orientation. I pretty much decided I was aro ace because dating was something I couldn't grasp. Like why the hell can't I do that stuff with my friends?   Nowadays, I identify as demi-homo-romantic asexual. I've only had 1 crushes my entire life. I'm still not sure what brought it on. I def don't identify as aro ace anymore because I do want some kind of romantic relationship, even if i'm not sure what that even means, or even how I develop such a connection.  So yeah, I suppose the moment I realized I was asexual was when I came out as bisexual hahaha. And the fact I kept procrastinating my love life. People started asking me about crushes when I was 11/12, hence me coming out as bi and being like ""i'm waiting until i'm a teenager because that's a teenage thing"" then I became 13/14 and people asked again, and I said ""Nah i'm waiting until i'm 16. 16 sounds good"" Age 16 rolls around and i'm like ""you know what. why rush things. I'll date someone when i'm 18.""  I developed my first and only crush at age 18/19 hahaha."

Next time it comes up, then, or if you want to bring it up yourself, ask her why it is that she thinks that. A blatant 'And what makes you say that?' in response to her denial that you can be ace. And if she has any actual arguments, from there it shouldn't be difficult to address them.  I think that would be a lot easier than just giving her lots of information. Perhaps linking to things to support your arguments against her 'arguments' could work, though."

I like the intimacy and the physicality of sex, for sure, but there are portions of sex that gross me out (while others are great), and the the idea that people are so obsessed with it is beyond me. Plus I like the idea of sex as two people coming together as one, like it's a kind of dance or sporting event where you have physical contact in a way that's fun and sweat-inducing.  So anyway, yeah, I think it's kind of neat that aces (others too, probably) can view sex as a bunch of different activities rather than purely SEX as a need or whatever."

asexuality,3a2bo9,soyuki,6,Tue Jun 16 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"First, let's start at the beginning.  You've found a loving and supportive place.  Hello.  And welcome.  It's very nice to make your acquaintance.  And now, let's get to your questions.  We seem to be different flavors of asexual, I'm aromantic, so my answers will be a bit biased by my own experiences.  But...here goes.  1, I have never tried to couple, so I'll defer to someone who has.  2, Asexuality is valid, whether it is inherent, the result of a trauma, or even a medicinal side effect.  It matters, more, how you feel about it and whether you accept yourself.  That is the ultimate question.  3, I would suggest you simply not allow them to engage you.  Arguments take two...deny them the second person.  I usually engage them, educate them, but I'm not so timid as most and I tend to not back down.  If you are the type, there are any number of snarky comebacks which would be appropriate, but I get the impression that you are not asking about that sort of argument.  4, This is remarkably common to hear.  And there is a reason why.  The belief that LGBT groups are about love and tolerance for all is a common misconception.  They have their own agenda, as does any other advocacy group.  Ultimately they are about forcing (not promoting) acceptance for them, and them alone, regardless of what anybody else thinks.  They behave more like any other militant group of bigots, judgmental and quite exclusionary.    Now, to be fair, this isn't true for all of them.  It varies from group to group, but some (too many) seem to be the gay equivalent to a supremacist group, attacking and marginalizing anyone who does not conform to their own narrow world view.  Which, considering that individually their members are usually sweet, loving, wonderful people, becomes even more baffling.  5, I would be happy in a room, alone, with an internet connection.  But that's less an issue of asexuality and more an issue of extreme introversion.   Again, I've no desire to couple, so I'll defer to someone who does."
asexuality,3a2bo9,redneckgymrat,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Honestly, I'd be happy with someone who would sit in the same room and play video games separately most days xD    It is interesting hearing from asexuals and thankfully you all have been very nice.     I used to fight and try and explain but being repeatedly told that I've got some sort of mental disorder if I don't want sex wears me down. I've stopped having the article, I just like having a concise response so I can just walk away. Often I don't admit what I am unless someone is pushy or flirting (I don't want to lead anyone on who thinks there will be sex in the future :P)    I ask the LGBT question because lately it's become an issue. The last thing said to me when we were all talking (a group of my friends LGBT folk) was ""Oh, I mean it's one thing to be a lesbian but everyone wants sex honey."" and they were so dismissive and rather mean after that. It was just... people I didn't think would be that way when they are fighting for acceptance themselves!"
asexuality,3a2bo9,redneckgymrat,4,Tue Jun 16 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"I have been known to make a joke out of it.  ""There are good reasons that my friends have nicknamed me Sheldon...and it's not just cuz I'm smart.""  When I want to explain it to someone, with a proper but non-medical explanation, I use a script of this sort.  ""OK, we both know Barney.  Barney likes girls, and is a total horn-dog.  Way high sex drive.  Seriously, I swear it's all he ever talks about, thinks about...there are days I wonder how he gets any work done.  And you, Jim.  You like girls, too, but you seem to be able to control yourself.  I mean, you have that urge, that drive, but it doesn't seem to consume your every thought.  In other words you don't have quite as strong a sex drive as Barney.  It's a scale.  Some people want more sex than others.  Well, keep going down the scale.  Barney is one extreme...I'm the other.  No urge at all.  And it all balances out.  (Giggle)  He has enough for both of us!  Funny how life works out, isn't it?"""

asexuality,3a2bo9,narrativedilettante,7,Tue Jun 16 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe this will help you.  Straight and gay are more alike than different.  They have exactly the same urges, the same feelings, and the same desires.  In fact there is only one difference between them...the object of their affection.  Consequently, even if (let's say) a straight person doesn't want to approve of a gay lifestyle, they can still understand at some level, where they're coming from.  The gay guy wants love, wants sex...he just does it ""wrong.""  To be a tad more analytical, they're on the same continuum, the Kinsey Scale.  Just on opposite ends.  We, on the other hand, are completely off the chart.  On a NUMERICAL scale, Kinsey had to introduce a LETTER, just for us."

asexuality,3a2bo9,osteopath17,3,Wed Jun 17 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"The way I see things:  A) To the best of my knowledge, trauma and/or mental health issues don't ""make"" someone asexual.  B) Even trauma did make someone asexual, it wouldn't matter.  If someone is comfortable with their orientation, I see no reason to treat that orientation as a problem, regardless of what ""caused"" them to have that orientation. Therapy is great, and I'm all in favor of people addressing anxiety and other mental health issues, but that should be done for its own sake, not because someone views it as a stepping stone to change some other aspect of themselves.  Personally, I'm aromantic as well as asexual, so I don't relate well to the desire for a non-sexual partnership. But I've heard of other people forming romantic non-sexual relationships, so as far as I know it's totally possible. I can't advice you on how to find someone to be with, though.  As long as I'm comfortable with who I am, I don't consider myself broken. As for whether other people think I'm broken... who gives a damn what they think? The only one who gets to judge me is me.  There is a tendency to assume that everyone naturally wants sex and there's something wrong with not wanting sex. I think LGBT spaces can be particularly vulnerable to that attitude because they've had to fight so hard for their sexual desires to be acknowledged as healthy and acceptable. It's hard for some people to jump from championing the idea that everyone can have whatever kind of sex they want to championing the idea that people can choose not to have sex if they don't want to. But really, sexual liberation needs to include the freedom not to have sex. A truly supportive and accepting group will make room for everyone to live out their sexuality in whatever way they deem fit, whether that means having tons of sex with tons of people, or never having sex at all. It just might take a while for everyone to catch on."
asexuality,3a39vt,floydgonzo,6,Tue Jun 16 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have.  But I did it when it seemed appropriate, and on my own terms, and even then only with a select few.  My sexuality, frankly, just isn't relevant enough to be anyone's business.  There is certainly no requirement to come out.  So, this begs the question, what is your motivating factor?  Why are you asking this question, and what do you hope to achieve by coming out?   I'm wondering if it might be a good idea to tell my parents and some close friends, because I feel like just saying it matter-of-factly when it comes up might throw those people who I'm close with and have known me for a number of years off a little bit, and I don't just want to drop it on them.>   This depends on your relationship with each of these people.  I've seen stories, here and elsewhere, of reactions ranging from simple disbelief, to heartfelt acceptance...and a few that turned extremely negative. I'm not trying to scare you, quite the opposite in fact.  But coming out, for anyone non heteronormative, means taking a chance.  And, unlike let's say a homosexual who wants to openly pursue gay relationships, our disinterest places us in a unique position.  We are naturally stealthy.  And, consequently there is certainly no requirement, and no lifestyle-benefit to our openly coming out.  Weigh your options.  Consider your plan.  And, if coming out is important to you, do it...but do it for you."
asexuality,3a39vt,redneckgymrat,2,Tue Jun 16 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't. I'm grey-ace rather than asexual but I don't see a need to make a splash about it. I do not think it will be a particularly hard conversation for me. What prevents me is that I ask myself two questions 1) What exactly do I gain from telling them? And, 2) Are their minds large enough to understand? If I don't think answers to 1 & 2 are going to be positive then why bother?  I like redneckgymrat's comment:   My sexuality, frankly, just isn't relevant enough to be anyone's business."
asexuality,3a39vt,Noneerror,2,Tue Jun 16 22:54:44 2015 UTC,"When I first started identifying as asexual, I felt obligated to tell people, like I owed it to them, and it caused me a great deal of stress. The other posters are right--if you come out, it should be for you. I finally decided to come out--first to close friends and family, then to everyone via facebook--because keeping it to myself was eating at me. I wanted to be able to talk to people about it and raise awareness. As I am (maybe?) romantic, it was for dating purposes, too--if most people know I'm asexual, it'll be easier to find other asexuals or people who are comfortable dating one. Some people like to come out when it comes up naturally in conversation, but I didn't want to wait for that with each person I wanted to tell--I wanted to get it all done with at once.  I was very lucky, though, because my friends and family are overwhelmingly liberal, so the response was very positive. Only come out if you know you'll be safe and have a support system in place, just in case. And you don't have to come out to everyone like I did. You can come out to whoever you want--including nobody--whenever you want. One of the best pieces of advice I heard about coming out is that there's no time limit."

As someone who occasionally does enjoy sex... the idea of having sex in my new house BEFORE I had it cleaned and got stuff moved in is just eurgh.  No.  Ew.  I was showering something like 3 times a day during the cleanup/move-in phase.  It was hot and it was dirty and I felt disgusting.  I think the idea is that you're claiming the space, like when people talk about ""deflowering the toilet"" in a new apartment (I don't know why they use sex terminology for that, again, ew).    It's like a dog pissing on a fence.  But you know what? I've got this giant stack of fancy paperwork that says I own the house, and the bank owns me for the next 30 years.

asexuality,39zbcj,Canterbury_Fails,2,Tue Jun 16 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"I've heard of successful relationships between sexuals and asexuals. I don't do romance myself, though, so I don't have any personal experience in that area.  It may be that you can find things he's open to doing that will fulfill your sexual needs. It may be that you will have to accept that sex just won't be part of your relationship with him. The most important thing is that you are honest, open, and nonjudgmental. Regardless of how the relationship goes, honest communication is a vital part of being with another person."
asexuality,39zlaj,lavalampdick,3,Tue Jun 16 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you experience sex repulsion. That's okay. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.  My advice would be to set up clear boundaries, and communicate that you doubt you will ever be comfortable with sex. Being in a relationship in which you're expected to have sex at some point is likely to be stressful, and having that expectation hanging over you will likely exacerbate the repulsion.  There are other people out there who are romantically oriented but asexual, and a relationship with one of them might suit you well. Or a relationship with someone who is not asexual but who is comfortable being in a purely romantic relationship with you and not having sex could be your thing. It might be hard to find someone who fits that criteria, but it may well be worth it in the end."
asexuality,39wcb3,orionic,8,Mon Jun 15 09:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think you don't really need to come out, especially if you don't feel like to. Your parents (and probably your friends too) wouldn't be part of your sexual/romantic life anyway, so they have nothing to do with your sexual orientation.  However, I can see why you would want to come out. If you often talk about sex with your friends, it must be annoying to stay in the closet. I'd suggest talking about it with your closest friend. Take them aside and make it clear you're going to have a serious talk, so they get in the right state of mind. They probably won't understand what it means to be asexual straight away, but that's okay, they're not asexual after all. What really matters is that they are willing to understand. I think they should be, since they are a friend and are supposed to care about you.   After even one person has acknowledged your identity, you can try with another friend. And so on. I'd say don't come out with everyone at the same time, people can be jerks when they're in a group. And being submerged by questions is not easy at all."

If you just view these problems as just annoyances and you'd rather put up with them than risk coming out, that is entirely valid. A lot of us agree that coming out isn't too important in many cases, potential partners being the exception.  On the other hand, if it is eating away at you, and you feel you're denying yourself in these interactions, then it is a good decision for you to explain it as best you can to them. You should probably do your homework and make sure you have the right kinds of explanation for each person you come out to for each of the typical ""bingo"" responses.   You can also go the softball approach: don't use the label asexual at all and just explain the ramifications of your asexuality one by one as they come up. e.g. ""I'm not interested in anyone right now,"" or that the sexual joking is just that. I'm afraid to come out to my dad myself, but I told him that I wasn't interested in either gender at the moment, and he was perfectly accepting of that.   This may buy you temporary understanding if you are okay about them thinking that you're a late-bloomer in the back of their minds. If they think labels are stupid, this may work best."
asexuality,39wcb3,geeked_outHyperbagel,2,Mon Jun 15 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"This. All of this. You may want to wait a while on your friends--they may mature over the next few years and become more accepting or at least willing to listen.  As far as telling parents, I understand that it can be awkward. I came out to mine maybe 3-4 months ago (I'm 17), and it was absolutely terrifying, even though I thought they'd be cool with it. I ended up writing them a note, which was much less stressful for me. We had a great conversation about it later, when they'd had some time to soak it all in. If you really feel the desire to come out, like I did, you might consider something like this if it's too hard doing it face-to-face.  At least in my experience, people's responses were usually underwhelming, and it wasn't a big deal at all. But you know your friends and family, and I don't. You can come out to some of them, or all of them, or none of them for now. There's no time limit on coming out, and you're not required to tell everyone. If you decide to tell people, just make sure you're prepared to deal with any possible repercussions."

I'm also a naturally tactile person, so that is a factor as well. I feel that spending time with people who really understand you will naturally veer towards the type of relationship you want it to.   And as others have said in previous comments, romantic relationships can really only be defined by those within the relationship. It's different for everyone!

Before discovering my asexuality, I used to think that once you are in a relationship you have to have sex, sooner or later. I was glad to be a woman because I knew this gave me some more time. It's socially acceptable for a woman to postpone sex at the start of a relationship. So I relied on that. But I knew I'd have had to give in sooner or later and that troubled me.   Now I know that I don't owe sex to anyone. As long as I make myself clear at the start of a relationship, it's my right not to have sex. Thus, I know if I'll ever have sex it will be because I really like my partner and I want to try it with him. Not because I feel forced by social norms or my partner."
asexuality,39u97f,ver_sacrum,2,Sun Jun 14 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. No one should ever feel obligated to have sex in a relationship if he/she is uncomfortable doing it nor should he/she feel guilty. Relationships are about trade offs, not sacrifices."

At first I didn't want to accept it and it troubled me, but later something bad happened and it became such a lame problem in my eyes. Kinda like ""I don't like sex, there are worse things in life so who gives a shit about that"". Now I'm fine with it!

I was scared I might need to go to a doctor for a hormone problem or a psychological one, and after reading about asexuality it was like ""huh, so it might be a thing from birth"". It was a relief in some way knowing it can't be fixed or changed, I didn't need to worry anymore about being someone I am not.  I also think I might miss out on the whole love thing.

Fast forward the couple years and I suddenly realise I'm asexual as well and that what I dismissed as ""irrelevant and unimportant"" is really an orientation just like any other. No minority is irrelevant, no minority is unimportant.  But it has also taught me that people really do want sex so much and don't say it just to appear alpha. It taught me that I'm not broken if I am repulsed by sex.

Like suddenly the importance of the emotional bond between partners, something I never experienced or even thought about, became a reality. Between that time and when I realized I was asexual, more and more I felt like I really wanted that someone to cuddle with and be intimate. When I learned asexuality was a thing I realized I could have that bond and stop worrying about the sex part.  Not sure if that answers your questions, but eh…"

Asexuality told me I'm not broken, rf taught me I don't owe men access to my body (OR mind) either way. Both together have made me realise that it's totally fine to not be in a (het) relationship. Coming to terms with my asexuality ended a relationship and I feel so much better since then, I didn't even see how much energy it had required of me.

I get the feeling that you might be young, which means all your peers are probably pretty focused on hooking up and finding sexual partners. Most people's teens and twenties are all about developing relationships and learning to make more intimate (not in a sexual way) connections with people.

I asked, since both people were in the relationship, whether it was reasonable to think that both could and should make concessions...you'd think I had just proposed something horribly offensive, and I was actually told that my manipulative and psychopathic nature led me to play with the emotions of others.  Yes, they called me a psychopath for positing that in a relationship involving two people, that both should be considered.  And a sociopath, too, as if they were interchangeable.

She takes care of everything she needs herself and it's been going great for us. She's happy, I'm happy, it's a good time. Our relationship has been this way for probably a year or so at this point. Early dating was not so light on the sex, but back then I was more into it too."
asexuality,39tktz,mundabit,2,Mon Jun 15 20:33:21 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about two and a half years, and it's a completely sex less relationship. It's great for me, being the asexual one, because I get the companionship and everything, and love her very much. It stinks a lot of times though, because she isn't asexual, and I can tell a lot of times she gets upset, and even though she knows I am, she can't help but feel like she isn't attractive, or untrue things like that."

asexuality,39tktz,mundabit,2,Sun Jun 14 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"Mostly the first one, but since I haven't seen those around too often, the second works too. To be honest, I'd dream of the first option, but be perfectly fine with the second.   So, yes both answers are welcome."

Like you, I feel like it doesn't quite seem to fit sometimes, but I also have days that I feel more sexual than usual, so it throws me for a loop sometimes. In the meantime however, grey ace seems to fit me as best as any umbrella-term can. Welcome to the club!"
asexuality,39q7kl,zatan130,24,Sat Jun 13 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm conflicted about having so many labels. On one hand, they can help people describe their experiences and feel validated, and I'm all for that. But many of them are not well-known or well-undetstood, so it's often easier just to describe your experience without them (""I lose attraction when my feelings are reciprocated"" rather than ""I'm lithromantic""). Yes, they're not hurting anyone, but it does seem excessive.  Then again, I could understand being defensive about it if I identified with one of the less-known labels and someone told me it was unnecessary.  I'm interested to hear what other people think."
asexuality,39q7kl,falling2geeses,6,Sat Jun 13 18:32:35 2015 UTC,There is a certain point with these labels where people will just think you are making shit up. I still dislike to use my 'proper labels' because I a) don't feel like my sexuality or lack there-of is important and b) people might think I am making shit up because they probably never heard about it before.

Aromantic or queerplatonic are still terms requiring definitions where I live, much less some of the lesser known ones. Not saying they don't serve a purpose as peoples identities, just that they may not be too useful for communicating to others what you are."
asexuality,39q7kl,weirdo_octh3,53,Sun Jun 14 07:27:13 2015 UTC,"I understand the confusion, but I once heard a great argument in favor of them.

asexuality,39q7kl,falling2geeses,7,Sat Jun 13 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"Having multiple words is helpful to know what exactly type of pants one prefers. While some people may prefer dresses or skirts. When one gets to know someone, they may say they prefer dresses. As you get to know that person, you may then find out what kind of dresses this person prefers."
asexuality,39q7kl,VibrantGoo,17,Sat Jun 13 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think they just fragment an already too-small community. Even with these ""specific"" labels there is still a lot of ambiguity so it makes more sense to me to have much broader labels, as you'll have to explain them anyway. Once you're refining below 1% of the population...it just seems a bit pointless."
asexuality,39q7kl,kevind23,12,Sun Jun 14 00:27:37 2015 UTC,"You could make an easy parallel with colors. A illustrator could probably name you dozens of variants of blue that seem ridiculous to the layman. Who the hell needs so much names for one color when they're only subtly different? Well illustrators need it so who are we to deny it to them?  It's important that the illustrator uses appropriate names when talking to the general population though, and not use obscure names only them and fellow professionals know. They have to adapt to be understandable and not expect everyone to know every variant.  It's reasonable for them to expect people to know some blues though, like sky blue or navy blue. They are popular enough that everyone should know about them and not get upset if someone wants to teach you."
asexuality,39q7kl,BreakTheLoop,68,Sat Jun 13 22:23:37 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion time: No. We don't need to label every detail and facet of our identity. What happened to actually getting to know someone instead of just listing off a dozen labels?
asexuality,39q7kl,NinjaButler,16,Sat Jun 13 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"Labels shouldn't be used to describe yourself to others. They should be used to help us talk about particular things. I don't want to have to say, ""who doesn't feel romantic attraction"" instead of ""aromantic"". It is just easier."
asexuality,39q7kl,mailmanq,23,Sat Jun 13 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"The label ''aromatic"" is good because it's not overly specific. Aromantics can be asexual or sexual, they can have tons of different kinds of relationships. It leaves room for individual personalities, preferences and behaviors. The problem comes when, for an example, people start using 'cupioromanticism' which is overly specific and describes a behavior/personality instead of a broad attraction (aromantic, but still has romantic relationships). Aromantic is your label, the fact you still get into romantic relationships is something people should find out about you over time."
asexuality,39q7kl,NinjaButler,12,Sat Jun 13 20:22:32 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Giving a name to prefferences is like calling straight people blondsexual or redheadsexual just because of the hair colour they like in their partner. Stuff like that is just preferences and differs from person to person.
asexuality,39q7kl,SpinningNipples,16,Sun Jun 14 01:32:10 2015 UTC,"The label ''aromatic"" is good because    ...it indicates to me which person is worth eating and which is just bland!"

asexuality,39q7kl,Malzair,3,Sat Jun 13 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that they are not needed, just that they should be used when relevant.

asexuality,39q7kl,dragon-storyteller,3,Sun Jun 14 09:36:57 2015 UTC,"I'm 33 and I agree. I think the need to label everything is very much a ""secondary school / college student"" thing. Or to put it another way, it is something people who are not financially independent tend to want to do.  When you're independent and can support yourself, it's easier to find peace of mind with who you are and not need any labels. At least that has been my personal experience."
asexuality,39q7kl,geeked_outHyperbagel,2,Mon Jun 15 12:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, I go to high school and college simultaneously. I've never met an adult who was anything either than hetero/homo/bi/a-sexual or romantic and man/woman trans or otherwise, but a lot of my school-aged friends have labels that I've never even heard of before.  As asexuals we do need to make up some new labels, since asexual visibility is a new thing, but I think the addition of a label for every little thing hurts our legitimacy."
asexuality,39q7kl,NinjaButler,2,Mon Jun 15 13:03:36 2015 UTC,"One bit of grown-up wisdom regarding self-identity I've realized as I've gotten older is this: Identify yourself by what you are or what you do... not by what you aren't or what you don't do.  The list of things that don't apply to you is infinite and you can waste lots of productive time trying to compile it. :)  It sounds so trite (and I hated when adults said it to me when I was a teen) but ""be yourself, do what makes you happy, and the rest will follow"".  Example - You probably want to complete your education, so focus on that. You probably also have hobbies or things you enjoy doing in your spare time (this is healthy and good, it gives the mind a break). Do those things too. Dive into them, embrace them.  Then after a few years you'll realize ""Oh dang, I'm a chem/bio major who loves to cycle and read biographies in my spare time, and I'm happy with that.""

I also don't think it's necessarily to do with being independent and supporting yourself.    High school and college is when people are figuring out who the hell they are, what they want out of a relationship.  Having all of these words is validation that other people feel like this.  It helps us find other people who feel the same way, other people to compare experiences with.    As I've figured out me, I've adjusted how I talk about being ace.  When I was explaining it, both to myself and to close friends, I'd say how I was a cis-gendered, grey-asexual, heteroromantic woman.  Now, I've gotten more comfortable with myself, and I just say how I'm straight-but-grey-ace, and still figuring out what that means to me."
asexuality,39q7kl,ace_detective,10,Mon Jun 15 21:56:28 2015 UTC,"I assume Gynoromantic means attracted to women and Androromantic means attracted to men, but why are those labels necessary?"
asexuality,39q7kl,falling2geeses,18,Sat Jun 13 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"They're meant to break out of the idea that there are only two genders. ""Heterotomantic"" is used if you're attracted to the ""opposite"" gender, but what's that mean if you identify as agender or neutrois or genderfluid (etc)? Using ""androromantic"" makes it very clear that you are attracted to men or masculinity, regardless of your own gender."
asexuality,39q7kl,falling2geeses,4,Sat Jun 13 18:26:29 2015 UTC,So they also have Monoromantic and Polyromantic because they don't want people to assume that having one partner is the norm?
asexuality,39q7kl,mundabit,8,Sat Jun 13 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"No, that's still about breaking out of the idea that there are only two genders. ""Monoromantic"" means you're only attracted to one gender (although it's not specified which), and ""polyromantic"" means you're attracted to two or more genders. Might be male and female, might be male and neutrois, or any other combination."
asexuality,39q7kl,Double_R55,3,Sat Jun 13 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"Spot on, Though this can get confusing because people like myself use ""Biromantic"" to refer to liking two categories of gender. ""My own gender and Other genders"" which essentially makes me poly-romantic.  Other people use Bi-Romantic to mean ""two genders"" and that may be ""male and female"" or it could be ""Female and agender"" or any combiation of two.  Why do I do this when it's not necessarily the norm? Because ""I'm bi"" is the fastest way to let people know I am open to dating different genders, It's faster than saying ""I'm pan/poly romantic"" because that usually requires an explanation on what pan means. I'm already having to explain asexuality. It gets tedious.  Also, There are too many poly's in my identity, I'm polyamorous, I really don't feel comfortable with the label polyromantic too.  I think of it this way: I have labels that I use everyday, In this case ""queer asexual"" because that's how I  feel when I interact with the world. But I have labels I will use when discussing the very specific nuances of sexuality in forums specifically designed to discuss that In this case, I'm a cis-female, sex-postive, autochorissexual, demi/grey-heterosexual, bi-romantic, sex-willing, polyamorous asexual."
asexuality,39q7kl,leavesamark,2,Sun Jun 14 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"I use polyromantic because I'm attracted to pretty much any gender that doesn't present overtly masculinely. Androgyny is great, attracted to women, my ex was genderfluid. I'm a guy so I didn't feel comfortable with using bisexuality for the implication I'm attracted to the same gender, which I'm not. So polyromantic is more accurate."
asexuality,39q7kl,falling2geeses,6,Sun Jun 14 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"geese is spot on. another example: unlike it's use these days, bisexual does not actually mean attracted to males and females. but attracted to two (any) genders.   and when pan covers them all, poly is there to say many. some, but not all. what you mean is being polyamorous!"

It creates an us vs. them mentality where 'us' consists of a tiny in-group of people who feel the need to add weirdly specific labels to themselves and are dismissive of anybody who doesn't get it, and 'them', which are all other people - including the majority of demi-/asexual people in the world!

Just from my own wild unresearched speculation I'd say that the church probably has had a historical respect for asexuality. Since they practice and encourage abstinence and the use of sex only for reproduction, most kinds of asexuality mesh perfectly with their views on sex. Additionally one of the things catholic monks and nuns had to overcome (historically, not sure about now) is their own sexuality. They considered the only true way of accomplishing this is try and force themselves into becoming Aces. Not sure how I feel about that, but it's good to know I'm living someones dream."

Self proclaimed ""liberals"" and LGBT groups are, by far, the worst offenders, as I've said repeatedly on this sub.  Duplicitous bigots, almost (I have to be fair) every time.  So, when they invariably misbehave, I invite them to my church.  Offer to let them see a loving and supportive environment, quite unlike their own.  Now...let's turn the tables.  You broached this subject for a reason, and asked about Christians, specifically.  Please, tell us your story."
asexuality,39faos,redneckgymrat,6,Fri Jun 12 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"Not any more so than other religions or belief models.   If anything the real devout Christians frown upon my asexuality because they mistakenly think it's linked to my childfree status.  There is a strong culture among Christians to raise families,  especially if you are a woman.  Lots of asexuals want to be parents,  but I'm not one of them.  It probably doesn't help that I am queer and have had girlfriends,  my asexuality is secondary to my biromantism."
asexuality,39faos,mundabit,4,Fri Jun 12 07:34:10 2015 UTC,"My family is Catholic. My parents and siblings are less so and they just brushed it off like everyone else did, ""you just need to find the right woman"" and other stereotypical comments. The more devout relatives of mine were considerably worse, since for them not being heterosexual is a sin. (I guess I should have told them I was saving myself for marriage...)"
asexuality,39faos,dragon-storyteller,4,Fri Jun 12 14:28:23 2015 UTC,"My family is devout Catholic, and they actually enjoy that I don't have the risk of being sexually deviant/pregnant. They don't have to worry about my choices, and the church is super supportive. However,  the queer community is really rude to me when they find out that I'm an asexual drag king. I get hate by a lot of lesbians and other performers about not being ""queer enough..."" Fuck them,  I'm not gay and i'm proud of it. Don't have to worry about  AIDS and shit."
asexuality,39faos,gannondalf,2,Sun Jun 14 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"It's about 50/50 for me.  I grew up very evangelical Lutheran, and still have ties to the church. Some people are perfectly accepting, and quote passages about everyone having different gifts and that sort of thing.  They might get a bit condescending and start in on the whole ""you haven't found the right person yet"" bingo, but that's about it.  But since the Bible does put a good spin on celibacy and possibly asexuality, they are ok with it.  I've actually had a couple of very positive conversations with a really cool pastor on asexuality.  Other people act like it completely blows their mind.  Like, they can conceive of LGBTQ relationships/sex/etc. (if only just to condemn them or ""just"" their sinful lifestyle), but to not want to have sex is completely out of their ability to conceptualize. Apparently because of the ""be fruitful and multiply"" command.  Especially as a woman, my highest goal is to sex up my husband and pop out some kids.  Not wanting that is just not something they can handle, and I'm obviously horribly broken because of it.  Or that I'm actually sinning by refusing to carry out my ordained role.  Or something....  I've generally avoided LGBTQ groups since a couple negative experiences in high school.  Sort of like the second half of Christians, they can't conceptualize of not wanting sex.  Since sex as an act is such a big part of their identity, not wanting it apparently means I can't identify with their struggles and challenges.  Whatever.  I'm friends with a lot of people in the community, but I don't actually want to be part of it."

We even had World Pride here last year and the Asexual conference as well (which I did attend). In short no issues in general - but ya have run into a few people over the years who are twits but those are the minority not the majority.

asexuality,392eqp,i_am_hathor,6,Mon Jun 8 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not crazy, and possibly asexual, although only you can decide if you are comfortable with that label. You're not a huge fan of sex, but do you get sexually attracted to people? From what I gather, most non-asexuals experience sexual attraction quite often, so I doubt you just haven't met the right person yet at 36.  Romantic attraction is different from sexual attraction, and you can experience one but not the other, although it can be hard to tell the difference at first. I recommend looking around here and on AVEN (the Asexuality and Visibility Network). Even if you are not asexual, it sounds like you have a lot in common with many of us."

There's a local ace group, but I've been unable to make it to a meeting.   The issue, of course, is that because its so sex-positive, everyone else is talking about their sex life all the time, and everyone is constantly encouraged to do what they want and have the sex that they want. Thus, if you don't have sex (even if you're not asexual) you feel pretty left out. Its actually a pretty big issue here: Sex is accepted as good and natural (which is great!), but now not having it has become kind of unnatural, and is confusing for people. Heck, everyone I know just assumes I'm having sex and hooking up with others, because they can't think of another option."

asexuality,390diz,Third_Party_Opinion,15,Mon Jun 8 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Growing up, it simply was not a thing. Even in middle school and high school, never heard of it. My community seemed fairly progressive. Friendly towards lgbt, even acknowledging pansexuality.  But I had to bear this weight on my own. Everyone was going through puberty, gossiping about crushes, exploring the sexual side of life.  I was okay for a few years, but when I reached 15-16 it began to really get to me. That feeling of being broken, that self loathing, that hope that if I just try it I might enjoy...  Things got bad for me in high school. I do know that if I had known about asexuality I could have easily prevented these things from happening, but as it was, I was too afraid and ashamed to say ""no"".  Summer between high school and uni, browsing the internet, come across a horribly misogynistic facebook post. A screenshot of an article about an ace girl and her boyfriend, captioned with a nasty comment about ""the ultimate friend zone.""  But it got me googling. But I still felt alone.   Getting to uni changed things. I moved to a larger city for it. I joined the Rainbow Alliance within the first week. Not only had they heard of it, but there were one or two that identified as such as well.  I feel like awareness and visibility is most important. And that community acceptance is a very close second. Coming out to my old high school friends, some of them required a link to the wikipedia page. There are still a few people who are incredibly confused, like, say, my therapist. But I think my change of location provided a huge improvement in discovering myself."
asexuality,390diz,romaniwolf,7,Mon Jun 8 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"/facepalm.  Your therapist? I don't know which is more depressing; your encounter in this situation or the fact that it doesn't surprise me in the least.   I'm so sorry - but you really do need to educate them, if possible, and if not possible, you need to find a therapist with some basis for common understanding. And brace yourself - you may find yourself doing this sort of thing a lot for the rest of your life. You may find yourself wondering if any of it does any good at all, especially since it seems terribly unfair that the answers you need don't seem to exist anywhere.   It is unfair. And it's still worth doing. And you will have an effect. Bear with me.   Core dump coming; feel free to skip to the end.  I'm non-neurotypical (I'd say neurodiverse - but I want to emphasis the ""not default"" or ""uncommon"" aspect) and I have had to explain how it all works for me when it actually does more than once. Far too many people in the mental health community seem to feel that mental health can be defined by how close you come to appearing and functioning ""normally.""  Well, I'd like to function normally too - normally for me. And being poked about the things you do or do not do that ""everyone else does"" interferes with that. There are some aspects of normalcy that I can emulate for a period of time. It's stressful and I can't do it as well as others. Not well enough to compete, just well enough to not alert others that I'm different.   But then, if you see xenophobia as a normal human response to difference, it makes all sorts of horrible things make sense - like ""normalizing"" people's genitals, for instance, or helping them conform to social expectations, even when that doesn't help them in the least. (ABA training for autistic children.) Mental health professionals grew up in a very conformist context and were educated by even more conformist people, referring to texts written by people who viewed any nonconformity as pathological.)  Things are getting better - socially, in general. It's difficult to imagine having this conversation at all even... well, certainly not 20 years ago. For some here, that sounds like ancient history, which makes me feel all wrinkly. But in social time, it's the blink of an eye. The span of one activist's career. It's huge. It's a great thing and it's also a huge fucking mess - and y'all get to clean it up and organize it so it makes sense in some way. :}  The only people permitted to talk about variance (and get any media attention) were those who were unable to avoid flaming in some way. Nobody had even heard the word ""intersectionality,"" so it was usually in competition and at cross-purposes. Anyone who could fly under the radar did as much as possible. If they couldn't - they picked up some obvious damage along the way, if they survived, that is. It's not all that surprising that being gay was considered a mental disorder. It was a very common correlation - you'd have to be crazy enough to come to the attention of a mental health professional - and they simply assumed that being gay was the problem. (See also Oppositional Defiant Disorder - seriously?)  Bringing up ANY other sexuality or the idea that there were normal variations marked you as queer and shit would rain down on your head. ACEs - well, there's nothing about being ACE that compels notice unless people know you very well, and the idea itself is just so alien that it's pretty simple to dissemble. Especially when you have no idea that it's even a thing that happens. Ten years ago, roughly, I became aware that low sex drive was a common comorbidity of Asperger's Autism.   ""Comorbidity.* What a lovely word that is - oh, look, another axis of brokenness!   And if I mention it - at best I am pitied for what I'm ""missing out"" on. I'd call it an ""abilist"" perspective, but it's not even that. I'm not disabled in that sense, not on balance. It means I do some things better, some things worse. We don't consider people who are unusually short or tall to be ""disabled."" And for me, it should be about the same. I'm disadvantaged by people who react to my nature as alien and threatening.   Look, I'm not whining here. I have done a lot of it in the past and I'm recounting why I did. But I think I would have done less of it if I hadn't automatically thought of myself as being less of a real person because I wasn't able to pass as ""normal."" Let's just ask ourselves if there's one good reason why that idea exists in the first place?   Now I see it as their problem; aggression arising out of insecurity coming from the inability of anyone to conform to the collective delusion about ""normalcy."" By breathing, we invalidate a whole set of social facades, conventions and assumptions. Sex drives vary. A lot. Those with different sex drives will behave differently - and as a related matter, they will have to evolve an ethical system that meets their needs, because the default won't work. And people do, because ""what God expects of us"" rapidly becomes less urgent than ""how can I avoid fucking things up again?"" If you believe in god, it's not difficult to imagine they would not want you to fuck up and harm others, or yourself.   Anyway, after I got that idea sorted, I was a lot easier on myself. If people argue with me about my own motives or how things work for me, I stop talking to them. But being ACE never really came up in this, because I thought it was the least of my problems.   I was still thinking of it as a side-effect of being on the Autistic Spectrum. And I was still thinking of that as what had caused my brokenness. Now, I tend to attribute it to abuse. We really have little idea what a ""normal"" neurodiverse person would look like because of the sheer amount of abuse sustained.   By comparison, we are right now seeing what  normal gay and lesbian kids look like when they grow up. We are seeing hints of normal transpersons. Some intersex people have had normal childhoods and nothing terrible has happened. And at some point, maybe we will stop thinking of ""normal"" as a useful concept, much less some sort of moral ideal.   But all of this has come about because people not very different than you or I were forced to consider things they knew to be desperately wrong and unfair, who knew they did not fit but could not express why. They had to figure out how to express those things, create the terminology and then start spreading them around. You need to have the words to think about something. I've helped do a lot of that over the years. Tiny little contributions, here and there; I can't pick out anything I personally did and hold it up as being particularly influential - but I can say that communities I have been involved in have had some obvious impacts on how we think about things.   But I'm kind of tired of coming out of closets only to find myself in a larger closet in a condominium complex made entirely of the closets of other people. And the next person to ask me why I can't just be normal... well, I'll just snub them. I burnt out my adrenal glands a long time ago, it seems.   TL;dr - sorry, it sucks. But in a good way that matters. :)"
asexuality,390diz,graphictruth,-5,Mon Jun 8 16:54:42 2015 UTC,ABA is more for the autistic kids who try to pull out their own eyes and who are non-verbal. Remember you're actually not the norm. Most autism is not a dorky guy with no social skills. Most is a self-abusing teen who can't feed himself and will never live independently.  Remember this when you start whining about normalcy. Pity the parents who will always be caregivers for a perpetual toddler.

asexuality,390diz,graphictruth,9,Tue Jun 9 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a major city.  Never heard about asexuality, or any flavor aside from hetero and homo, really.  And, obviously, everyone had to shoehorn into one of those two options.  Since I'm not attracted to guys, I must be straight!  Of course, being a good Christian boy I ""saved myself for marriage'"" which avoided all the stupid questions about sex.  My virginity was a conscious choice, perhaps a tad quaint but certainly not shameful.  And while I'm sex averse for myself, I have no issues with others having it...I'm quite open to the idea for anyone else and am quite willing to discuss it frankly and openly.  So while my friends were laying and screwing and whatever other charming words they use to describe it, I was abstaining.  No big deal.  I didn't hide the fact, either.  When my friends started pairing up in their twenties and thirties, I had a few offer to find me someone ,too.  I thanked them, refused, and that was the end of it.  I have also maintained life long friendships with quite a few gay men and women.  And I'm a lifelong supporter of each of my friends,regardless of race, creed, color, or persuasion,  Curiously, any time I've had to deal with LGBT groups, I'm immediately met with hatred and bigotry.  Ironically, those who preach tolerance and acceptance, who demand it from everyone else, are the most intolerant bigots I've ever had the misfortune to encounter.  Individually they're lovely, but as a group they are up there with Westboro.  Hatemongers, every time.  Personally, I always had the ""broken"" feeling until recently, but it never bothered me enough to do anything about it.  And, since I genuinely like the person who I am, it's caused me no long term distress anyway.  Thank you for this question.  It never occurred to me to consider asexuality from a geographical view.  It must be terrible to live in a sex positive area, if you're repulsed by sex."

Much of the LGBT community seems to believe that having frequent and indiscriminate sex with many partners is their birthright, and that abstaining for any reason is a personal attack on their right to screw anything that moves whenever they have the urge.  That we don't have that urge, and have no issues abstaining, is a rude reminder that their views are not a birthright...their seeming inability to abstain or show anything resembling self control is displayed in stark contrast to us, and they are revealed as weak, since they are just indulging their own urges."

People are generally LGBT-positive/neutral and sex-positive... but asexuality is not known nor accepted by most (heterosexuals) who hear of it. Why? Because its not ""normal"" and everyone should want to have sex. There is also a general sceptical attitude to such ""newfangled ideas"". Not to mention the people don't want you to shout your ""weird"" sexuality from the rooftops, because sexuality (and religion) is considered private matters anyway, so why would go around telling people about this? It's complicated. There are also very few resources and articles in my language.   It makes it really, really hard for me to come out of the closet. I have tried, but been rebuffed a few times with lots of ""are you mentally/physical ill?""-responses.

Last year, when I first realized, I was in a pretty small town in Western MA. I didn't exactly broadcast it, but the few people I spoke to about it hadn't heard of it - could I blame them? Neither had I until then - but were perfectly supportive and encouraging when they understood what I was saying. Even my ex, who opted to end things when he realized I was going to ""get better"" from whatever was killing my interest in sex, did so amiably and on good terms.   Now I'm in Phoenix, and I'd expected with the population size to find more of us. My brother took me to Pride this year with his family, and while I didn't feel spurned at all, I watched the parade for close to two hours before I saw an ace group. But none of the booths had anything in our colors, and I didn't run into anyone else that was wearing the purple flag or anything. So I felt very alone overall.   I had zero luck whatsoever trying to find a non-sexual romantic relationship online. I'd go so far as to say that many people around here either don't know what asexual is, or just don't care. No real skin off my back, but definitely weird to feel so lonely in such a large area. I did connect with the group that was in the parade, and they're such nice people, but I live so far away from where most of the meetups are. :/   ... well that kinda turned into a rant. Sorry."

asexuality,390diz,dragon-storyteller,6,Wed Jun 10 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"I used to live in a town that was pretty liberal. I was pretty open about my asexuality, although I didn't run around shouting it from the rooftops or anything. A lot of people thought it was weird, but most of them seemed to get used to the idea pretty quickly.   Now I live in a tiny southern town where a lot of people still have a problem or confusion about gay people. When I was in high school, I told a few classmates in high school that I wasn't interested in sex and they seemed confused, but weren't rude about it. I don't know if it's just because they're young and more open to ""weird"" stuff than their parents, or because most of them were very Christian and thought that sex before marriage was bad anyways, or just because I was sort of ""nerdy"" and most people would have assumed I was more into reading than sex anyways. Maybe it was a completely different reason altogether. I think some of them thought I was secretly a lesbian, too."

I can't reveal I'm asexual to anyone in person. The absolute majority of spreading asexual awareness is done over the internet in English, which means it has almost zero reach in my area. So despite the country scoring as the 4th most LGBT friendly in the world, coming out as an ace will get you ridiculed and ignored. There's very few resources in the native language about asexuality and most of them have gaping inaccuracies (""asexual people have no desire to date or hold hands"") or have rather unfortunate wording (comparing asexuals to rats, without malicious intent), and that makes it rather hard to try to educate other people on the matter too.  I have come out to almost all my English and German-speaking friends, and they accepted it without hesitation. If this is not the language barrier in action, I have no idea what could it be."

asexuality,38zd0j,Dolphman,43,Mon Jun 8 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"Maddening. I find it really easy to see the misery of relationships, but it is difficult to understand the benefit. People seriously put up with a lot of shit just to have that one person they can do stuff with. I don't understand why the misery has to go hand in hand with the friendship. But then, maybe my friendships aren't as deep either.  People get all bent out of shape over being single and not having sex. They talk about how nobody will ever love them. (Got so tired of this in college. Seriously, just because I don't want to date you doesn't mean no one does.) They complain about how long a dry spell they've had. (OMG, you haven't had sex in two years? I haven't had sex ever!) They talk about the stress of the 'interview' period, where you're desperate to bang someone, but you want to make sure it's the right someone.   Then there's ""baggage."" Everyone brings baggage into a relationship. Apparently. What is it? How do they get it? It's stirred up from the emotional drama of being in a relationship that didn't work out. So... I have no baggage?  And the most maddening thing of all is when people talk about the things that ""make life worth living,"" implying that if you are never in a relationship, you've never lived.  Apparently, as a single, child free, asexual, my life isn't worth living. I'll never truly understand life, love, happiness, whatever... I'll never accumulate that 'baggage' that people wear as a badge of honor. I'm not just an ""outsider looking in."" I'm not even considered human, because I'm missing out on the basic human experience.  I feel like an alien in this culture. I've lived in it my whole life and I still don't understand it."

I don't get people, I don't get relationships and the ones telling me that without love (romantic or the love you'll feel for your child) you aren't really living, can fuck off.

asexuality,38zd0j,CoolTom,4,Mon Jun 8 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"It really does madden me how people can be offensive at just the mention/idea that you never had a sexual/romantic relationship with anyone else. And they get somewhat offended and start to try to show off their relationships to you as something you ""absolutely need to do""... argh. (And don't even get me started on fiction characters that are bended to do this stuff because being single is ""bad"")   Really... I can sorta see the benefits, and I really say ""sorta"", because it has so many unseen downsides of being in a relationship that are brushed under the carpet, because they live in denial. For example, the most basic one, the possession over the other person. Most romantic parters not only impose that your opinion and acts have to be somewhat aligned and approved by them but they also expect you to rule and impose your views on them. Other issues being how lots of them also want to be ""the only one truly close"" to you and might get jealous of even family members. Some are so madly deeply dependent that they can't function without having constant contact with their SO requesting at least some mailing daily.  What I sadly begun to realize is that society never intended to make humans who can be independent and live feeling complete by their own. Almost everything and everyone will try or even say it clearly how ""people are not supposed to live without a significant other"", or ""how they are incomplete without it"".  Now look how laughable it is that ""Let it go"" is that much of a hit with almost half a billion views in a single youtube video and  also how many people love the character Elsa, even if (or more so because) she is on her own, I mean, this should be a topic of its own, but I laughed at some comments on the music video with older people stating they were sad that the children liked Elsa more than Anna because this was a sign they were valuing being on their own more than romantic relationships. How that is a bad thing? xDDD  I would then say that, at least, people should really think about fixing their own issues and learning how to deal with themselves instead of thinking that it's their partner obligation to live and complete those problems. It makes no sense at all and it is a great part of why we are dealing with so many children badly raised by mad and broken parents.   Anyway, I can really keep ranting about the subject all day long xD. I agree with you Astrobean, and I also agree that the most maddening thing is the ""make life worth living"" ! People should really learn to not impose their own ""happiness theory"" on others."
asexuality,38zd0j,WokgranX,4,Wed Jun 10 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"I used to identify as aromantic (now I identify as panromantic, still ace). Definitely wouldn't say that being in a relationship is the thing that makes life worth living. I'm actually, for reasons completely unrelated to dating, much more depressed now than back when I thought I was aromantic. I also don't understand the desperate need to date; why would you actively seek out an SO, even picking among strangers? Nor do I understand the idea of ""love at first sight."" I've never been romantically attracted to anyone without having been friends with them for at least half a year first (though I only have a sample size of two).  I can shed some light on the understanding misery but not benefit thing. A lot of people won't talk much about the good parts of their relationships for various reasons; it may seem like bragging, some parts may seem too intimate, or they may guess that you aren't interested in hearing about it. But, they're happy to complain about the problems they're having. It's kind of like reddit it that respect (you see people on here complaining much more than you see them giving thanks for good things).  IMO, the benefits are:  Cuddles - It is often awkward or difficult to develop a cuddling relationship with someone without being in a romantic relationship. I realized I liked cuddling about the same time I first developed romantic attraction, in fact. Headscratches, hugs, massages, spooning, resting your head on someone, etc can all feel very nice.  Having someone you can open up to about things - I've heard this is especially the case for guys, who society encourages to bottle up their feelings, even with friends. For many guys, their SO is the only one they can really share their emotions with. I'm generally good at opening up to people and friends in general, but it's still really nice to have someone who you can always count on to support you when you're sad and share your joy at when you're happy.  You have someone who is your #1 fan - When my boyfriend sees me after we've been apart for a while (sometimes this is only a few hours), his eyes will light up, then he'll drop what he's doing, run towards me, and tackle-hug me while shouting ""DARKFIIIIRRRRE!!!!!!"" (insert my actual name). More generally, I think it's really nice to have someone who loves you. Yes, many people also have family who loves them a lot, but it's special when someone has fallen in love with you without any influence of familial obligation, and they love you purely for you.  Having someone you can always count on - Your SO will care of you when you're sick, help you when you're busy, help you with jobs that require two people, etc. Friends, especially very good friends, will often do this too, but there's a certain type of commitment pre-associated with a dating relationship that has to be more uniquely developed with friends.  Always having a companion to do things with - This is more of a long-term thing, but I think a big idea of having spouse / long-term SO is having someone who will always be with you, even when you drift apart from friends and sometimes move across the country. A lot of people fear being alone / the stress of if they will make new friends, and having an SO makes that less of an issue.  Sometimes people's relationships don't incorporate all of these things, and people are merely hopeful that they can change the other person to get these things or that they'll happen eventually. Some people also are in relationships for things like sex or because they feel like society says they should be in one. So, your mileage may vary, but the above reasons are at least what I get out of a relationship.  Note: I'm not exactly sure how precisely some of these things are different from what happens in aromantic, queer-platonic relationships. I suspect that they're very similar long-term, and that a lot of perceived difference isn't really there. At least for me, the thing that made me decide that my first romantic feelings were a crush (versus a squish) was the unique sense of obsession that came with it, but people in queer-romantic relationships have said they've felt the same thing, so I don't know."
asexuality,38zd0j,Darkfire359,8,Wed Jun 10 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"My general problem: I love cuddling. I know I do. I don't get to cuddle, though, because whenever I get close, there's always that expectation that I'll give more. I'm sorry. Why isn't cuddling enough? Why is subsequent fondling necessary? Can't we just be friends who cuddle?  I wouldn't mind having the things that you mention, but I don't want someone around all the time and I'd feel bad acquiring a SO just to fill those temporary wants. I'd feel like I was using them and abusing their love for me because I don't reciprocate it. Because I just as often want to be alone. I want everyone to go away. I don't even want my cat cuddling me.   I attempted dating before I knew I was ace, and I always wound up breaking up with the person because they were so in love with me so quickly, and I was just meh. I don't really feel attachment to people. But I want cuddles. It's frustrating. My sister says that sometimes you make sacrifices to be with someone and to have that, but I'd still feel like I was taking advantage, because I get what I want easily, and they're left wanting."

Cuddle buddies are definitely a thing (we even have a web link in the side!)   Also, if you're around more open-minded people, you can just ask (although it is kind of a nervous/awkward thing in a similar way to asking someone out). I know several people who have / have had cuddle-buddy type relationships that developed without any app/website stuff.  Additionally, if your main worry is your SO feeling alone when you aren't feeling as interested, you can consider polyamorous relationships / setups. Polyamory also is useful if the other person involved isn't ace, because then they can satisfy their sexual cravings elsewhere.  I've found that there are actually a lot of people interested in unorthodox relationship types, if you know where to look (big, liberal cities, at LGBT / Ace events, liberal colleges, and/or online)."

These things are certainly the selling point and primary motivators, but if there are contrasts in the less exciting stuff (financial values, temperaments, conflict strategies, etc.), that's just misery.

You are right that there is no other way of figuring this stuff out without spending time with the other person.  I guess that reveals the underlying problem: everyone approaches dating with their best face on. By the time you're in the position to figure out that the other person is a slob, can't manage their money, won't accept their share of responsibilities, etc., you'll be pretty deep in the relationship. I'd imagine many people at this point can convince themselves to overlook these problems because they're in love.   tl;dr: I'm echoing a common criticism that you have to usually have to commit fairly far in a romantic relationship to learn how someone is outside of a date."

Being introduced to friends-of-friends is not - that's a time-honoured tradition, and more importantly, the people you're introduced to aren't random.   The first question you have to ask yourself is, what's the point of you dating? I can think of a few. Sex and relationship are the most common. The best way to not waste time in dating someone who turns out to have a different goal from you is simply to communicate right from the start and figure out what each of you wants out of a relationship. Which is why it's completely baffling to me that having that conversation with a first date over coffee is frowned upon, and asking it as a response to ""can I have your number"" is so far off limits that I've never even seen the concept come up.   There is, of course, a case that isn't covered by the above: one party wants a serious relationship, and the other wants sex or a casual relationship and isn't above lying. There's also the case where one party is simply toying with the other party's emotions. Presumably for fun. This differs from the above in that toying with them is the goal, rather than sex.   Then there's the case where one party's intentions change. But eh, this was never going to be news.    Another case is where a motive is hidden: most commonly, this is due to someone needing to be in a relationship in order to feel good about oneself, thus opening them up to all manner of exploitation. This isn't really a dating culture problem, though."

Even when I was in a relationship (if it could be called that, before I realized I was ace), I never really understood it.  I think the problem for me is that I don't want my life connected so totally to someone else's in that way. If you're in a relationship, you're kind of at the beck-and-call of your SO. You have to make the right gestures, plan the right getaways, carve out time to spend with them that might be because of their schedule rather than your own, especially if you want to just hang out with your buds (have had friends cancel on me a ridiculous amount of times because of this). Granted, that may not necessarily be how the generic allosexual in a relationship thinks, but to me, it just seems like a burden.  You know what I want? Freedom. The ability to do as I damn well please without worrying about some other human being getting offended that I don't want to spend time with them, that I'd rather play computer games, or watch TV, or write, or do whatever.  I'm also rather asocial and tend to thrive a bit better in solitude than in a group, especially with strangers, so this isn't a catch-all, but I'm also able to comfort myself with the fact that I'm okay being alone. And you know what? That isn't even all that true anymore.  One of my high school friends, quite coincidentally, is an aro-ace, and now we're roommates. There's no romance, no expectations, and we both lead our own lives. But if there's something we want to watch (binged FMA: Brotherhood, and I've gotten her into The Flash), we do, and when Jeopardy comes on, she'll sit on the couch next to me and sweep the arts and literature categories that I freaking suck at, and the companionship of just having someone there is nice.

There's this strange idea that there are people who are so different from us (asexual or not, just everyday folks) that they are totally fine with random strangers, many of them unappealing in different ways, renting their bodies to essentially jerk off in. This kind of lie of course needs to be backed up somehow, and since there are not enough volunteers, sex trafficking is necessary to keep this up.   It's strange, asexuals should be able to have a more objective view about it (with most asexuals not wanting sex, not knowing sexual desire etc), but I often see the same sort of mentality as with everyday people. ""Oh some women love doing it."" Or my favourite: ""If it prevents men from raping women, it's ok."" Implying that, if there is no subset of ""lower"" women where sexually aggressive men have an outlet, they will turn to rape the ""good"", ""normal"" women instead. Idk, it's just some shit we repeat like ""broken bones grow back stronger"" or ""drink no milk when you're on antibiotics"".  Also you can probably google ""PTSD + prostitution"" yourself. It's really not a secret how destructive this all is, it's just something we ignore and accept. The Invisible Man Project is also important to read, even though it's just anecdotal, it gives a good glimpe into the mind of men who use prostituted women as sexual outlet, and how they ignore obvious signs of pain etc or even like it.  Knowing all this, perhaps it is understandable that I get pissed off when people I should feel some kind of solidarity with or something, endorse prostitution as alternative to casual dating/one night stands/etc."
asexuality,38zd0j,redneckgymrat,2,Tue Jun 9 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"Some women enjoy sex. That's not propaganda. I personally don't care for it, but I'm very aware that I'm in the minority.  Do you think prostitution takes place in seedy little bars where their pimp will beat them if they don't perform well enough? There's not even a reason to go to a red light district anymore, with the Internet and all. A lot don't even want to be named a prostitute but an escort.   The way I see it, why not get paid to have sex if you wanted to have sex anyways. Getting paid for it or having a one night stand isn't that different. Only difference is the money. And if the prostitute doesn't want to have sex with their customer? Well, they're free to refuse. Nobody is forcing them.  I'm not denying that force doesn't happen. But in countries where it's regulated and legal, the majority isn't forced and fucks men and women for money because of their own free will.  I might be asexual, but I'm very open minded. Why the hell not let people sell their body for sex if that's what they want."

Go to /r/feminism or tumblr or something if you think women must be forced or have ptsd from prostitution. Because a woman surely can't actually want to make a quick buck by having sex with a man."

Did you enjoy making your very judgmental little jab?    We aromantics were asked to analyze dating, and by extension pairing up, as outsiders.  Coming at it from that perspective, I am quite capable of considering the arrangement dispassionately.  Un-emotionally.  You, for whatever reason, seemingly can not.  If the goal is merely sex, it is an efficient and cost effective solution, a business arrangement entered into, freely, between two adults.  And, by the way, there are male prostitutes too, so no it is not an issue of simple misogyny, as you seem to think.  Many people are also very loose, willing to jump into bed with anyone, if the opportunity is presented.  That would be even more cost effective and efficient.  The term is one-night-stand.  Conversely, if the goal is a relationship, that's a more complicated issue.  And with that goal in mind, random dating still remains a bizarre concept to me.  Yes, pre-vetting someone, whether by the use of a matchmaking service or, less formally, by being introduced by friends because of common interests, makes more sense to me.  In what way is that condoning the oppressive history of marriages?  Jumping to extreme conclusions and attempting to shut down communication is not a good idea, generally.  Consider your replies, instead of posting kneejerk reactions.  Oh, gasp, he disagrees with me!  Guess what?  Disagreements, presented in good faith, can make for a spirited discussion if both parties are willing.  I'm willing."

You, for whatever reason, seeming can not.   Perhaps because I'm a woman myself and I'm capable of of empathy.

It's documented fact that women are more emotionally in-touch than men, on average, so I'm willing to accept that premise.  As for the rest, and I'll say this as clearly as possible...  If the goal is ONLY sex, why not skip the foreplay and just jump straight to sex?  I've had friends who were moping around, lamenting the fact that they hadn't had sex...it's their own fault.  If someone wants to have sex, it's not difficult to find a willing partner, whether for free or whether you have to pay them.  Notice, I said nothing about male dominance, human trafficking, historical patriarchies, or anything of the sort.  Re-reading your responses, it seems to be the fact that a male said it that offends you.  And, frankly, the rest appears to be your attempt at reductio ad absurdum.  I also said, and you conveniently ignored, that if the goal is coupling, pairing, a relationship...that would and should involve more, and getting to know each other makes sense.  But I also said that targeting the process either through a matchmaker, arranged marriage, or well meaning friends, based on common interests, made more sense to me than random pairings.

asexuality,38zd0j,redneckgymrat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"The idea of dating and marrying for love is a fairly new concept. Matchmakers and arranged marriages have been the norm throughout human history, and it must have worked, since our species hasn't gone extinct.   I've written ""many men"", not ""all men"". And ""can't really enjoy sex"", not ""can't physically have it"". I think nobody in their right mind would ever imply someone can't physically have sex if they don't love their partner.   Also, old generations were taught that love follows marriage. Which is not always true, I know, but it can be. So love was still part of marriage, for some at least.    As for prostitution, if that was an accurate assessment, prostitution would not be a viable business. In fact, it's viable even in the USA, just outside of Las Vegas, where is legal. It is viable, and seemingly profitable. And it has endured since the dawn of time.   I don't really get what you mean here. I don't think there's much to argue over the fact that having sex with someone who is being exploited is immoral."

Another sometimes but not always overlapping thing is sex aversion, which it also sounds like you have.  I would definitely try and look into getting some therapy to talk about this and your depression.  There is nothing wrong with being asexual or sex averse, but having someone to discuss it with might be helpful.    Suicidal feelings really suck so I hope you can find a health way to deal with all that.  Good luck."
asexuality,38yoxm,monstertrucktoadette,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:16:51 2015 UTC,"If you're attracted to women, you're heterosexual, not asexual. You appear to be somewhat sex-averse, however. This is totally fine, although I've heard therapy can help. Many asexuals have been sex-averse, but so are many heterosexuals, bisexuals, et cetera. It's kinda tough, but there are ways to work around it, especially you being 16, though I realize it feels a bit disastrous now. My advice if you're in a partnership with a non-sex-averse girl is be honest about this, and say you're in it for the intimacy. Many girls in high school will really like this- they're often looking for a romantic counterpart to experiment with who isn't going to be sexually aggressive. That sounds like something that could be good for you, if that's something you're interested in. In any case, we'd still love to have you in the group, as many can relate. I'm putting my money on ""Not Asexual"" tho."
asexuality,38yoxm,ATiredCliche,3,Fri Jun 12 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"If you're attracted to women, you're heterosexual, not asexual.   Not necessarily true. If he's sexually attracted to women, he's heterosexual, but OP specifically said he was not attracted to them sexually. There are many more kinds of attraction, like romantic, aesthetic (appreciating appearance, but not sexually), and sensual (touch). OP, it sounds to me like you are asexual heteroromantic, but only you can choose what label is right for you. Definitely look around here and at asexuality.org for more perspectives and information.  u/aTiredCliche/ does give good relationship advice--whether you're asexual or not, be honest with your partner, and only do what you are comfortable with. It may seem like everyone out there is sexual, but there are many women--asexual and not--who will accept you as you are, whatever your sexuality or comfort level.  I'm with /u/monstertrucktoadette on therapy. Please take care of yourself and get some help. You are valid and you matter. Some therapists treat asexuality or sex-repulsion as ailments to be cured, so you may need to shop around a bit if you want to discuss these things with them.

Yes, most people are approaching sexual maturity by your age,  but no, not all.  It really is possible that you are just a late bloomer.  I was, so I know it is definitely possible.  Next, let's look at what you said.  You get a squishy feeling towards women, and none towards men.  That means you have a preference for women, and implies that you lean hetero.  But you also said you don't feel sexual towards them.  That means there is an attraction, but not a sexual attraction.  There are many types of attraction, romantic and aesthetic being two of the big ones.  You may just be sex averse.  That would certainly fit much of what you wrote.  But not all...so I'll continue.  The bit about swearing is just odd.  I'm not sure what that would even have to do with sexuality.  What was your purpose for including it?  The bit about the sex jokes actually implies a discomfort and much as I hate to even bring up the term, repression.  I question if you are just a bit repressed.  I don't care for sex jokes, probably because I honestly don't understand many of them.  But I don't dislike the people just because they told a joke I didn't care for.    Further, the part about not being willing to look at yourself in the mirror also reinforces the bit about repression.  How do you feel ABOUT sex?"

In the end, the only one who can—or rather, should—label you is yourself.  Regardless, you really should talk about your feelings and comfort levels with your partner(s), and never do anything you're not absolutely comfortable with.   Most importantly, I agree with other posters that YOU NEED TO GET THERAPY IMMEDIATELY. Suicidal thoughts should never be kept to yourself and if you're not able to be consistently happy, you need to find help. You're more than worth it. You matter."

asexuality,38ogad,zoechan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:45:14 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to look at it from the perspective of reproductive strategy. The behaviors that result in the most offspring (who survive long enough to reproduce as well) are the ones that are most likely to be successfully passed on through the generations to become an ingrained part of the genetic makeup of our species. This goal of passing on genetics doesn't have to be a conscious or willful thing - it doesn't even have to be a subconscious thing - it's just a pattern of behaviors that are successful for reproduction and as such end up getting passed on.  For a female, the process of reproduction takes, at minimum, nine months. That's a LONG time - especially considering that for the vast majority of our history, the average life expectancy was often less than half of what it is today. For a female, the pattern of behaviors that results in the best chance of a person's genetics getting passed on to future generations is to be choosy, to take one's time in selecting the best possible mate, and to be liberal in dismissing options that are for any reason considered (consciously or subconsciously) sub-standard (so long as a better option is available).  For males, on the other hand, reproduction can take as little as two to three minutes. Given the extremely small investment of time, the pattern of behaviors most likely resulting in their genetics being passed forward to future generations is to engage in sexual intercouse with as many people as they possibly can.  As you can imagine, the end result of this is that it's genetically advantageous for a male to view all members of the opposite sex as potential sexual partners, but at the same time it's genetically advantageous for a female to only view a small subset of members of the opposite sex as such.  The problem here is that society has evolved away from a model where the ""attempt to have sex with everyone"" strategy is viable or acceptable, but genetic evolution has yet to catch up."

Evolution produced micropenises, vaginismus, menopause, bearded ladies, dwarfs, infertility, homosexuality, all kind of non sexual behaviors counterintuitively socially useful, and because we're in this sub, asexuality. It also produced people that think about sex and nothing but sex, just because why not. We don't need to justify this behavior in a supposed primal need to put your semen in anything with a vagina. It appeared and survived, it's all that matters.  If you can point me to a source that's serious and doesn't consists of pure speculation I'll be happy to revise my judgement."

I guess being asexual it's extremely hard to empathize with them, so maybe I'm at fault here, but I also know what it's like to be objectified, and I don't think it's fair that 50% of the population is looked at in this manner just because of ""biology.""

No matter how instinctual or ingrained a behavior might be, in order for an individual to function within a society, they have to have the ability for their conscious choices to take priority over their instincts.

So, saying ""from an evolutionary perspective"" is the same as saying ""scientifically speaking"". What's wrong with that?    Everything you say is classic sexist justification.    I can't understand why /u/sporks5000 is getting downvotes. I don't think it's sexist to say that men and women are different in regards to some aspects if they actually are. Everything /u/sporks5000 said is not only logical, but also true. Or at least it is what evolutionary psychology, a branch of science, states.    Sexual-strategies theory (...) predicts that when men are actively seeking short-term mates, they should tend to seek larger numbers of sexual partners than women should when they are actively seeking short-term mates. It is because of the psychological shifts that occur within men and within women when they choose to pursue a short-term mating strategy (as opposed to a long-term mating strategy) that researchers can compare the sexes and expect overall differences across their distributions of desired number of sex partners. When examined in this proper context, repeated cross-cultural tests have shown that men’s and women’s desired number of sex partners are not the same; for example, Schmitt et al. (2003) found that about 25% of men but only 5% of women want “more than one” sexual partner in the next month. Sex differences in permissive sociosexuality (e.g., agreeing with the statement, “Sex without love is OK”) were universally observed across 53 nations (Lippa, 2009). A meta-analysis of sex differences in sexuality (Petersen & Hyde, 2010) concluded “evolutionary psychology proposes that short-term mating strategies are associated with significant gender differences. . . . Results from the current study support this theory”.    From: http://www.bradley.edu/dotAsset/196920.pdf"

I did not like how they acted like testosterone is some crazy thing that is what makes men animals. It is such an old gender stereotype. Sure, maybe it changes your level of horniness but it doesn't mean women aren't horny also. I mean they are basically comparing adult women to teenage men. I don't know, I do feel uncomfortable with this insistence that men alone are controlled by their sexual desire. But it is not really objectively quantifiable. I mean we can't disconnect people from society and the already pervasive idea that women need to control sex and men can't whether that is the want to have it or the actual act itself.  Besides that it was also interesting personally since testosterone definitely didn't make me relate any better to what they are talking about and I would say my horniness level is about equal to when I was a teen. Even then though I was asexual which is why I felt so left out when people would talk about sexual attraction.  Which brings me back to why it seems such a cop out to blame it all on hormones. No need to shame people for their sexual attraction either, but the competition over who has less control over their sexual attraction makes me feel highly uncomfortable."

In France we have high far right scores in elections, a consistent 20% of voters and in progression as reasonable people stop voting. If I take into account turnout rate and age you can vote, that's roughly 10% of the population voting for xenophobic fascists. I remember quite clearly, in 2007 on Monday after the first round of the presidential election in the tramway going to school, looking at people around me and telling to myself: ""One in ten. One in ten of these people around me voted for the extreme right. One in ten that have values and a perception of the world so different from me. That given the chance would inflict so much hate and pain on the rest of us. That I could never trust to have my back if for some reason I needed help from strangers. One in ten and they walk among us as if it's the most normal thing in the world. And I don't know who it is in those that surround me.""  The people in this thread kind of give me the same ""they're among us"" feeling. I know some of the people I cross in the street or in a bar will have a perception of the world that I find somewhat disturbing but that is so intense to them and I can only hope keep these intense feelings in check and behave in a socially acceptable way.  I mean, if I snap, I'll throw a mild tantrum or find a safe place to escape and cry, probably both. If my perception of the world or my values becomes universally accepted, it's rainbows and love for everyone. But what if they snap? What if their perception of the world becomes the norm (and I say that considering objectification of women already shaped the world for thousands of years)? Those people that I maybe interact with everyday (if I actually went outside...)? That's what scares me.  I also know that while they show a facade of ""it's so hard sexualizing everything but I behave"" on reddit, a lot of people don't care in real life and are repeatedly offensive or threatening or simply dangerous. That doesn't scare me as much as it angers me deeply."
asexuality,38ogad,square0,3,Sun Jun 7 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for explaining exhaustively. I think now I can understand better why it is so disturbing. I'm a girl and each time I'm alone in the streets I have to constantly think about the possibility of being attacked by someone. It's not even a conscious thing anymore now. I automatically check my surroundings to make sure everything's okay. It's like the thought of being raped is following me around whenever it's night and/or I'm alone. So knowing that men can think like that makes me worried, what if I met someone like that while I'm alone?  However I think we shouldn't exaggerate things, even if fear would drive us to do so. For example:    it makes them appear so different and not in a good way, and they describe it as if it's so normal.   Perhaps they appear so different because you think of men (or people in general) as way less sexual than they actually are. Not being able to understand their point of view is normal if you have a low sex drive or are asexual. I was a little surprised too! However I don't think they are not normal. There's nothing wrong with having a high sex drive. You should expect that: since sexuality is a spectrum there are people with no sex drive and people who are all about it.    But what if they snap? What if their perception of the world becomes the norm (and I say that considering objectification of women already shaped the world for thousands of years)? Those people that I maybe interact with everyday (if I actually went outside...)? That's what scares me.   I don't think their perception of the world is necessarily different from ours. If they snapped, most of them would probably throw a tantrum like you, or swear maybe. I think it's wrong to assume that every person who has a high sex drive is a potential raper. Would you think that of a woman? Yet men are not the only ones who have a high sex drive or who rape.   Also, I don't think that being sexually attracted to someone equals objectifying them. Sexual attraction is normal, it's what you do with it that defines whether you're objectifying someone.   TL;DR it's okay and normal to be scared of rape but we shouldn't exaggerate things."
asexuality,38ogad,BreakTheLoop,5,Mon Jun 8 09:26:30 2015 UTC,"You're right. My wording is probably not the best and all I said here is if I make a conscious effort to think about it, maybe over-analyzing.  I do know it's just part of the spectrum and people with high sex drive are not inherently potential rapists and are as caring as the next person.  When I say ""they describe it as if it's so normal"", it's not so much to mean that they are not normal, because they are, but because they give the impression that it's something all men experience and that not experiencing it is what is not normal. It gives me the impression they are the ones not aware of the spectrum and variations and that they think everyone around them thinks the same. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but it's the vibe I think they give.  Guess I went overboard again with my other post..."

You might want to give it some time, read up on asexuality and ace experiences to reassure yourself that you fit.  If you really want to tell them and you are still not 100% sure, that's okay. You could bring it up without using the word ""asexual,"" like, ""I don't think I get sexually attracted to people"" or ""I'm not interested in sex"" (if that's the case). But, really, it's okay to not be sure. It's okay to say you're asexual and then later find a different label. It's not that you'd be wrong, necessarily, you'll just get more right over time as you gain experiences and perspectives on yourself. Labels are tools to describe your experiences; it's always okay to change yours to a better one, and it doesn't mean the first was entirely wrong.  If you're worried about misrepresenting the asexual community, don't be. Making people aware of asexuality and educating them is always helpful, whether you're ace or not. And word is spreading; I have a feeling your friends will meet other ace people at some point. Just focus on yourself, and whether it would benefit you to be open about this part of yourself, whether you're sure or not."

asexuality,38nn0a,CoolTom,2,Tue Jun 9 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"Same for me. But I hope you're not too bitter about it :). Sex is just a part of life, one of many."
asexuality,38nn0a,intheshape,9,Tue Jun 9 02:42:18 2015 UTC,"Despite identifying as an asexual for such a long time, I still feel moments where I feel like I'm missing out. But then at some point I realize that I would 100% force myself to be in a sexual situation with another person (like having to do a chore I don't want to) and that really just sounds terrible for all parties involved. I feel like I get enough out of other aspects of life mostly."
asexuality,38nn0a,ariannemartell,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"This is the exact same feeling I get. When I think of the logistics of it, time, person, etc. Seems like more effort than its worth for maybe 30 of actual activity. Not to sound too harsh about it, but I've got other things to do that have a higher reward :P"
asexuality,38nn0a,TXTCLA55,9,Tue Jun 9 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"I have always felt the exact opposite. When I see how much time and effort some people spend acting on their sexual desires, I always feel relieved I don't have to go through that."
asexuality,38nn0a,dragon-storyteller,7,Fri Jun 5 11:56:38 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like I'm missing out in terms of sex and the apparent joy it brings to allosexuals, but more in terms of life experiences. Sex seems to be such an important driving force, leading people to meet others, put themselves in situations they otherwise wouldn't be in, being confronted to confusion and emotions that makes them grow as a person.  I never had this driving force nor any other that could help me grow like that. I'm 26 and I feel like I have so much to do and experience in terms of basic human interaction to not feel permanently inadequate and that having another sexuality would have helped me greatly in that regard. I know some sexual people feel perpetually awkward as well and maybe it wouldn't have changed anything for me, but that's how I feel.  I don't dwell on it though, I know it's how it is and that you can't rewrite history. I'm grateful for having understood I'm asexual and dissipated the confusion. I now know what I have to do to lead a more fulfilling life and have the intimacy I desire."
asexuality,38nn0a,BreakTheLoop,8,Fri Jun 5 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's weird to know that a woman or a man is ""hot,"" but to not really ""get"" it.   I feel like the hypothetical blind man who can, somehow, make accurate color judgments. He knows the object is blue, but still can't see the blueness.   In the same way, I can make judgments about someone's appearance or mannerisms along with my sexual friends, but they're not real sexual judgments. It's just an odd realization."
asexuality,38nn0a,gortonsfiJr,5,Sat Jun 6 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  Yes, there's a big part of life that everyone else experiences that I can't relate to, which makes me feel kind of blind. On the other hand, a big portion of their lives are consumed by their sexuality, which could be used for more productive things."
asexuality,38nn0a,raubana,7,Fri Jun 5 14:20:03 2015 UTC,"Sort of? Though probably not in the sense you've alluded to - I could remain a virgin until the day I die and not have any regrets about ""missing out"" on this thing that everyone makes such a big deal out of.  I do however, feel that I'm missing out on being able to have romantic relationships. I'm certain I'm not aromantic fictional character crushes suck >_>; , but I've never been able to have a relationship because:  1) I haven't yet developed feelings for anyone and therefore never had motivation to pursue someone, and  2) Anyone who's ever shown interest in me has made it pretty clear that they think sex is the main part of a relationship, and while I'm not averse to the idea of sex in itself, the idea of sex with someone freaks me out (and for all I know, that might never change)."
asexuality,38nn0a,Randomixx,3,Sat Jun 6 01:10:19 2015 UTC,I'm definitely objectively missing out on something.   Does that bother me? No. I'm happy with the way I am. I like that I think with my head and not my penis.
asexuality,38nn0a,21stPilot,3,Fri Jun 5 13:39:03 2015 UTC,"Have I ever had those thoughts go through my mind?  Yes.  Yes I have.  Is it something that has happened often enough to give me pause?  No.  No it hasn't.  I used to sit, worried I was broken, and concern myself with what was wrong with me.  Once I came to grips with the fact that this is me, and regardless, it's how I'm wired...it's simply a non issue.  Finding out there is a word for it made it even better."
asexuality,38nn0a,redneckgymrat,4,Fri Jun 5 19:56:43 2015 UTC,I feel like people around me are missing in. :)
asexuality,38nn0a,VanMerwan,4,Fri Jun 5 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"So much is made of sex, culturally speaking, that it's hard not to feel like I'm missing out on something. Through my early 20s, I kept trying to figure out how to enter the dating scene, how to find a way to have sex... and eventually I realized that the reason I wasn't having sex wasn't that there was some secret I hadn't deduced yet, but that I just didn't put any effort into it. That's what made me start pondering asexuality, and ultimately accepting that I'm missing out on this thing not because I'm fundamentally incapable of making it happen, but because it's not one of my personal priorities."
asexuality,38nn0a,narrativedilettante,3,Fri Jun 5 23:57:33 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything really. But, where I feel worried about being asexual is being able to maintain a long-term relationship. Not only just because I will, most likely, have much less interest in sex than if I were with an allosexual person or potentially more interested if with another asexual (as I do think I want to have sex sometime at least), but because I feel that it has played a part in hindering my ability to form strong relationships with family and friends."

Most of my friends are in relationships or at least have been and I have no idea about the topic. Would be nice to experience some kind of romantic bond with someone but sex is such a major part of relationships that it would close to impossible to form one. It's a little alienating. If anything, that's the saddest part - I couldn't care less about having sex but I do feel like I'm missing out on this major life experience. But I'll deal."
asexuality,38nn0a,calltehshots,2,Sat Jun 6 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Nope! I don't feel like I'm missing out since it's not something I enjoy. Hearing that I'm 'missing out' has the same smug ring to it as people who are just so, so sorry that you don't like The Beatles.  The only downside is that I feel like I'm from the outside looking in when it comes to my own culture. Sure you can relate, but it's only abstractly. So much of advertising, movies, music, etc revolves around sex or mentions it in some way that it's hard not to feel alienated.  I'm also kind of relieved, though. I feel like sex isn't just a cornerstone for people's lives, but it's what their lives revolve around. It gives me the creeps, like when you see zombies moaning about brains. It's so single minded that I have to imagine that if I weren't asexual, I'd feel a little dehumanized."
asexuality,38nn0a,WeenJacker420,2,Sun Jun 7 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Not really. I have never wanted a sexual relationship and most likely never will, and thinking about other people's sex lives is honestly kind of draining because I feel like I have to invest all this energy to relate to something I don't care about."
asexuality,38nn0a,mahogany1101,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:14:46 2015 UTC,"No.  Granted, I hear about the closeness an intimacy sex an bring to relationships, and I do wonder what it's like to experience that, but it's a abstract concept to me."
asexuality,38nn0a,KirinG,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:20:50 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm missing out on the romance part of being sexual. All my friends are in relationships that started out with sexual attraction. I don't mind not having sex but not having a significant other weighs on me a bit. Part of it is being in a small city where dating options is limited. I just really need to get a pet.

Are you proposing something constructive, or are you the one trivializing real problems by using them as a ""tu quoque"" shield from discussing other problems you deem less important?"
asexuality,38tvqv,ATiredCliche,22,Sat Jun 13 08:59:39 2015 UTC,..... I think that the women that are doing that are horrible people and not at all representative of what feminism is about...
asexuality,38tvqv,monstertrucktoadette,-2,Sun Jun 14 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"But containing/removing people that assume they are part of a movement and act against it also part of said movement responsibility?  I mean, this is not even ""rare"" its way too common, is the same problem with the male version of it (MGTOW), when you are out to actually read what people that identify as feminist or mgtow, almost all you see is rage and gender wars. With both sides calling each other the ""scum of the earth"" or worse.  It is a fact that many self-claimed feminists (that have the support of many other self-claimed feminists) claim that males are ""potential rapists"" ignoring woman that might also be and those who are not. It is also a fact that lots of MGTOW state that woman are better off just shutting up and living as a jobless wife because its in her best interest to do so. Or even saying that woman are there to please their sexual needs...  This war makes no absolute sense at all, it only makes people go aggressive on each other and not hear what the arguments are. Imagine if us asexuals started to take similar actions with sexuals. Saying they are all sex-driven animals and so on. What would that accomplish? And wouldn't be on our best interest to make clear that the person that say this is in no right to represent the asexual community? (And ban the person from AVEN like it is usually done when it happens there?)  So, sure, ""feminism is not this"", ""religion is not about that"", but regardless of what the initial idea or movement is, the fact remains that the movement is made by the people who join it, and if there are tons of visible and representative sexist feminists and mgtow, both movements will be just a justification to act in a sexist way. Regardless of what the original concept was. (Again, isn't the same with religion? Who follow the bible 100%?)  And, needless to say, it excludes non-binary and genderfluid people. Because it become to be all about men x woman, versus. I'm really glad when the person shows empathy for all genders, but this is the ""rare"" stance when we look to the big picture, or at least to those who act upon it on the internet and so on.  tl;dr: If you think, as you probably should, that this person is not representative of feminist, don't just say ""she is not truly feminist"" but act in order to preserve your own movement core and make clear to all people involved that this is not what feminism is about. Because she is not the only one, there are tons of others acting just like she acted."
asexuality,38tvqv,WokgranX,3,Fri Jun 12 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"I guess my point was not very clear. Let me summon it up. The feminism (or any other movement) is what the people who identify as feminist (or said movement) make out of it. [dot].  This should be obvious since ideas and groups change their priorities and essence over time and keep the same name (or not). Therefore I used the analogy of religious groups who also don't follow what their core/essence definition is.   I intended to make people who usually say ""those are not real feminists"" to stand up and take actions to correct their own movement, otherwise, I will feel in my total right to call feminism a sexist movement that can be observed by such actions as those highlighted by you and many others.   True enough, MRA is more of an opposing movement to feminism, but I guess you can see my point when I say that MGTOW movement is also full of people that are just sour of relationships/woman and more often than not also spout some sexist or generalist nonsense. One wrong action should not justify another one. Even more so when we are talking about somewhat large groups with lots of rational people in it. (It should be a movement about going your own way, not caring about others, shouldn't it?)  (And sure, I consulted the links and indeed I agree to some point with the claims being made. Could even say I agree with most of them, but usually the anger and ""preparing to war"" tone and stance is what does not please me that much, but that is a separate issue.)"

You seem to have a very strong opinion already made and not open to listening. Finding an echo to your thoughts? Probably not the best place. Making us see the truth? Still not the best audience.  You throw around that link about how feminism is so hurtful to men. I could build the same kind of list explaining how any group is hurtful to another if I wanted. Gay Japanese are hurtful to spiders? Done. Short people are the main cause for global warming? Done. The 1% richer people and the egoist middle class are responsible for global inequalities? Sorry, that one's too easy. It's really not that hard to compile articles and statistics and quotes and make them say whatever you want. Find an impressionable audience that has a prior bias and they will eat your shit and ask for more. /r/conspiracy lives for that kind of content. All your link proves is that you're gullible and have a problem with women, nothing else.  The day you're tired blaming women for your problem, you might want to shut up and educate yourself. Every feminist thought feminists were exaggerating before educating themselves. Every.  As for the matter at hand, feminists are generally sex-positive. That means a healthy and open attitude towards sex and anything goes between consenting adults, without pressure to do anything anyone is uncomfortable with and without shaming other's sexuality. Feminists are also in general for a better recognition and visibility of sexual minorities.  There are conflicts between feminists in almost every subject, because feminism is a living matter constantly evolving, but there's no doubt as a whole it's an ally to asexuals."

Also, in the loves category, that one of seeing the angry driver get stuck in traffic and you getting to go forward, mine is so satisfying and related I feel I should say it. A lot of people HATE cyclists, to the point where people think I have a death wish just because I choose that form of transportation. That said, there is little else that is as satisfying as when some jerk has been riding your tail for a while when they could have gone around you, honking and some of them even throwing things to try to get you off the road you have every legal right to use, and then there's a traffic light and they get stuck, but as a cyclist you get to go to the gutter area and turn right during the red light and then just before you get out of range the light turns red again and they're still stuck. Nothing quite like it."

asexuality,38l48f,ExtraWingyScapula,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm sorry you've only run into that kind of cyclist. One thing to consider, though of course not always applicable, is that most lights are triggered by magnetic sensors in the road. The problem with that is that cyclists and those riding small motorcycles simply haven't got enough metal mass in their vehicles to trip the sensor. Sometimes we would literally be waiting all day if a car didn't come and get the light changed. One time, as an experiment, I waited. I timed it. I was sitting there for ten minutes. The only two things I could have done to get going were to press the crosswalk button (illegal because that's for pedestrians) or go through the red light once I made sure it was safe as I could (not only legal but the method suggested by law enforcement) I know that it doesn't excuse everything, but there are a lot of situations those that never ride don't understand which necessitate cyclists doing something that if a car did it would be illegal. Sometimes I have personally been forced to do something technically illegal just so I didn't get hit by a car, or worse a few times a semi truck. If I were a stickler for the letter of the law I would be dead right now. In some cases, people have gotten used to doing certain things in a certain way because it is necessary and then in other similar situations they just go ahead and do it out of habit, even though it is less safe that time because it isn't the same situation. That's when the person looks like a jerk. I mean, there are also some cyclists that just don't care, of course. There are people like that with any group. (and to be perfectly fair there are a whole lot more douchebag drivers than cyclists, even just proportionately)  Once again, not to excuse anyone for anything, but there are a lot of situations you may not have considered that force a cyclist to take certain actions in order to stay alive."
asexuality,38l48f,Super_Dork_42,-1,Mon Jun 8 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I know all of the situations. I have lived in two of the largest cities in the US, some of which lack any sort of smart triggers in their streets that I can see. No bikers obey traffic, which is why we have monthly ""cyclist killed by running a red light right into a car/truck/train"". Last night I was visiting NYC and I saw two bikes riding in opposite directions on a one way street...and they both ran the red light.   So no, he wasn't afraid of getting stuck at an unchanging red light. He just thought he could beat me through an intersection."
asexuality,38l48f,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Tue Jun 9 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Living in a big city does not equal knowing all the situations a cyclist would be familiar with. And if Topeka Kansas has them then they are definitely in your city. They just aren't obvious. It's just some grooves in the road. And saying that no cyclists obey the laws is just showing that you aren't paying attention. And once again, I wasn't saying what you think I said. I was pointing out that in a lot of situations cyclists have to do things that might technically not be in accord with the law so they don't die, and those things can have a tendency to become patterns. Those patterns take hold, so don't judge them too hard for using those in situations elsewhere.

I'm not really concerned with other people's sexuality and never ask since I hate when people start prying about mine. I very much keep the aromatic/asexual thing to myself outside of the internet since I get enough flack from people as is once they realize I don't date. I knew one guy in high school who claimed to be asexual but he was very much an immature, edgy try-hard who told everyone he was an ""apathetic atheist asexual"". Spoiler alert: his dick eventually overcame his ego."

asexuality,38jyzf,prewarpotato,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:46:35 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I guess it came to mind for me because I just recently identified as asexual so now my head is abuzz with it.

asexuality,38jyzf,Nihil_,2,Thu Jun 4 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"the most prominent example that keeps coming to my mind is my ex-boyfriend, who I now think might be an aromantic asexual.   Haha, that's something I'd expect my ex-girlfriend to say about me.   Anyway I guess I do that sometimes. It certainly isn't very often, though. The last example I can think of was with respect to a girl I went to middle school and high school with who happened to go to the same college as me. I talked to her a good bit in 8th grade in science class, and I found myself thinking about her one day and wondering if she was asexual. She dated one of my good friends in high school and something seemed different about her.  Anyway, right after I graduated college I happened to meet one of her roommates at a party I went to before I left for home. Her roommate was drunk and started talking about her, and said that at one point the girl I've been talking about told her roommate she was asexual. And that just made perfect sense to me for some reason."
asexuality,38jyzf,chiisaihimitsu,2,Thu Jun 4 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's really weird to think about, but I've started noticing it in TV shows. Lord Varys in Game of Thrones, Sheldon Cooper in Big Bang Theory, and Sherlock Holmes.  As for the people around me, it's especially difficult to tell. I had a suspicion that perhaps my one professor is asexual, mostly due to him expressing his lack of desire to find a mate and procreate (hehe, rhymes). Interest in sex varies in people, as does the expression of those desires. I sort of gush when I talk about my favorite male characters in movies and literature, but my enthusiasm stems from my heteroromanticity. In the end, I think it's difficult to tell unless someone is specifically talking about their interests when it comes to sexual activity."
asexuality,38jyzf,CoolTom,3,Thu Jun 4 19:47:10 2015 UTC,but my enthusiasm stems from my heteroromanticity    This right here is why I believe some people would be very surprised to hear that I now identify as asexual.

Three (2M 1F) people I lived with at separate times I thought might be either closeted gay or asexual with asexual being more likely. They never dated nor expressed interest in anyone over multiple years. I would have liked to talk to them about it as I was curious especially with the girl. I could have, but more-so I felt it was none of my business and probably rude. Their sexualities didn't matter to me. I have a general policy of not asking questions I do not want the answers to, especially accidentally. There is a difference between thinking something might be true and knowing something is true. I did not want to start thinking of them differently."
asexuality,38jyzf,3fox,2,Fri Jun 5 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why do you think you would think of them differently if you knew their sexuality? And how do you think of people differently knowing that information?"
asexuality,38jyzf,prysmyr,2,Fri Jun 5 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I would think of them differently. I have no idea. I just don't think about other people's sex lives. I know they have them. It does not occur to me to contemplate specifics that other people engage in. It is not a mental image I particularly want. It is the difference between knowing someone is pregnant (yay cool, congratulations) and knowing where, when, and how that child was conceived (umm, ya ok, awkward.)  ""Think of them differently"" was probably the wrong phrase to begin with though I don't really have a better way of saying it. I don't want to imagine scenarios involving my friends and sex. For example do you want to know your parent's favorite sex acts? I don't. You cannot un-know certain information. A friend making a simple statement like, ""Oh man my feet are killing me!"" has a completely different connotation if you know they gets off on having their feet burned with candles. That's the sort of thing I was talking about except there are also worse versions of that."

Doesn't. Work.  From what I understand, women who take it, and who consider it to be effective (which is a small subset... many women who've taken it don't find it to be effective at all) find that, when on the drug, they have sex one more time per month than they do without the drug. Once per month is not a lot. And it's the highest success rate that's been seen. Emily Nagoski, my favorite sex educator, has written about this A LOT. This post is a pretty good one, and there are lots more if you do a search for ""flibanserin"" on her website. Basically, I'm doubtful that it's very effective even for allosexual women with low desire.  So, should you try it? Maybe. I can't say for certain that it'd be a bad thing for you. But I advise you to be wary, and not assume it will suddenly make you want sex in a way you never have before.  I also encourage you to do your own research. I may well be mistaken about some relevant facts or have information that isn't totally up to date, and trusting a stranger on the internet to give you sound advice isn't any better than putting your faith in a pharmaceutical ad. ;)"

I mean, who can take that seriously? Protozoa. I could always substitute something more fluffy, like strawberries. Or find a new slogan somehow.  Is that a common misconception, that asexuals are born without sex organs? I've never thought of or come across that, but again, I'm new to being open about this. To me, from the etymology, it was obvious that being born without sex organs would result in a medical diagnosis and condition that would be given a more weighty name, like hestotallymissingapenistosis."

No one has told me I'm going to hell, or forbidden me from talking to their children, or anything that extreme.  I've never been attacked.  It's a quieter sort of, ""Yeah, I don't believe you.""  It's not something that would get me in trouble with family, but that frustration is also a big part of why I'm not ""out"" with family yet.

I'm a little bit iffy on the middle section, too, but I can't pin it down...small caps on the .org would be the first thing I'd try here. Well, second. Moving it around is just going to unbalance the design, but I'd normally only come to that conclusion after trying it, because I don't tend to think before I act when there's a ctrl-z available.

I don't really want to touch upon this bit since I don't have a fetish - especially not one like that - but to me having a folder of girls tied up, gagged, and helpless is rather disturbing...especially if he gets off on it. Hopefully someone here has a little more insight on that subject."
asexuality,38fpjh,Nihil_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"Self-sexual? perhaps?  Asexual fetishist maybe? I don't know and can't really. It seems less that you want to define your relationship and more that you want to define your boyfriend. This isn't something someone else (including you or me) can, or should define.  A label is just a shorthand. The label itself is unimportant but can be damaging if someone else comes up with it. It would be healthier for you both if he went looking for words and terms himself and then brought those ideas and feelings to you, rather than the reverse. The sidebar is a good starting point. Let him sort it out."

Plenty of asexual people have kinks or become aroused on their own, so there's no need to worry whether those things disqualify you."
asexuality,38b9p3,narrativedilettante,2,Wed Jun 3 14:13:29 2015 UTC,"The common definition of asexuality is experiencing a lack of sexual attraction. Ask yourself: Have you ever seen a person and wanted to have sex with them? If not, you are possibly asexual (and even if you have experienced sexual attraction under specific circumsances you can be asexual; demi or grey). I say possibly, because you are the only one that can put that label on yourself. It is your identity.   As to your cross-dressing, the thing is that kink does not have to include sexual attraction. No one has ever said that. It is perfectly normal to experience both arousal and kinkiness even for asexuals. There is even some scientific research on asexuals who are into BDSM. There are plenty kinky asexuals out there.   In conclusion, neither sexual experience, libido or kink can exclude you from being asexual. Asexuality is defined solely by sexual attraction.  My advice? 1. Read/watch a bit more on asexuality on youtube, AVEN, books, etc. 2. Try the label on, see if it fits."

Affected individuals may simultaneously demonstrate a rich, elaborate and exclusively internal fantasy world.   SPD is not the same as schizophrenia. Some psychologists argue that the definition of SPD is flawed due to cultural bias: ""One reason schizoid people are pathologized is because they are comparatively rare. People in majorities tend to assume that their own psychology is normative and to equate difference with inferiority"". Therefore ""[t]he so-called schizoid personality disorder is one of the more blatant examples of the APA’s pathologizing of normal human differences.""

Just some more advice: A general rule of thumb for psychologist (according to my shrink-friend) is that if your symtoms don't prevent you from living a ""normal""* life, then it isn't a personality disorder. Furthermore, personality disorders seems to be hotly debated in the shrink-community. The main criticism is the question wether all ""abnormal"" behaviour should be pathologized. Kind of like how homosexuality was considered a psychological problem until the 80's.  Another example relating to asexuality is HSDD. Later research by L. Brotto indicates that asexuality should not be patologized as HSDD.  *normal is a variable term, but basically means here that you can create and maintain healthy relationships with other people without undue stress."

I stress a lot in my life, for many things (mostly related with relationships), so I guess asexuality in my case is a ""symptom"" more than a fact.

asexuality,38b9p3,AsexualityArchive,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:35:51 2015 UTC,"Section 7. Criticism of article  Hypoactive sexual desire disorder:       HSDD, as currently defined by the DSM has come under criticism of the social function of the diagnosis.   HSDD could be seen as part of a history of the medicalization of sexuality by the medical profession to define normal sexuality.  It may also over pathologize normal variation in sexuality because the parameters of normality are unclear. This lack of clarity is partly due to the fact that the terms ""persistent"" and ""recurrent"" do not have clear operational definitions.  HSDD may function to pathologize asexuals, though their lack of sexual desire may not be maladaptive.  Because of this, some members of the asexual community lobbied the mental health community working on the DSM-5 to regard asexuality as a legitimate sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder.    Other criticisms focus more on scientific and clinical issues.   HSDD is such a diverse group etiologically that it functions as little more than a starting place for clinicians to assess people.  The requirement that low sexual desire causes distress or interpersonal difficulty has been criticized. It has been claimed that it is not clinically useful because if it is not causing any problems, the person will not seek out a clinician.  One could claim that this criterion (for all of the sexual dysfunctions, including HSDD) decreases the scientific validity of the diagnoses or is a cover-up for a lack of data on what constitutes normal sexual function.  The distress requirement is also criticized because the term ""distress"" lacks a clear definition.    Prior to the publication of the DSM-5, the DSM-IV criteria were criticized on several grounds. It was suggested that a duration criterion should be added because lack of interest in sex over the past month is significantly more common than lack of interest lasting six months.  Similarly, a frequency criterion (i.e., the symptoms of low desire be present in 75% or more of sexual encounters) has been suggested.    The current framework for HSDD is based on a linear model of human sexual response, developed by Masters and Johnson and modified by Kaplan consisting of desire, arousal, orgasm. The sexual dysfunctions in the DSM are based around problems at any one or more of these stages.  Many of the criticisms of the DSM-IV framework for sexual dysfunction in general, and HSDD in particular, claimed that this model ignored the differences between male and female sexuality. Several criticisms were based on inadequacy of the DSM-IV framework for dealing with women's sexual problems.   Increasingly, evidence shows that there are significant differences between male and female sexuality. Level of desire is highly variable from woman to woman and there are some women who are considered sexually functional who have no active desire for sex, but they can erotically respond well in contexts they find acceptable. This has been termed ""responsive desire"" as opposed to spontaneous desire.  The focus on merely the physiological ignores the social, economic and political factors including sexual violence and lack of access to sexual medicine or education throughout the world affecting women and their sexual health.  The focus on the physiological ignores the relationship context of sexuality despite the fact that these are often the cause of sexual problems.  The focus on discrepancy in desire between two partners may result in the partner with the lower level of desire being labeled as ""dysfunctional,"" but the problem really sits with difference between the two partners.  However, within couples the assessment of desire tends to be relative. That is, individuals make judgments by comparing their levels of desire to that of their partner.  The sexual problems that women complain of often do not fit well into the DSM-IV framework for sexual dysfunctions.  The DSM-IV system of sub-typing may be more applicable to one gender than the other.  Research indicates a high degree of comorbidity between HSDD and female sexual arousal disorder. Therefore, a diagnosis combining the two (as the DSM-5 eventually did) might be more appropriate.

Enjoy your exploration of yourself. And don't limit any sexual activities you might enjoy later because of how you feel right now. If you met someone and you find that you would enjoy sex with them. Even if it's just to make them happy, and your enjoyment stems from theirs. It's ok. You're on the cusp of adulthood and there is a lot of things that will change in the next 5 years. Be comfortable with yourself but be open minded if you find that you like a kink/fetish. And be open minded toward other Aces if you find that you never like sex, and they still enjoy it in someways."
asexuality,3873g1,Nezumify,5,Tue Jun 2 10:57:56 2015 UTC,Makes sense. That's a fairly common description given by aces.
asexuality,3873g1,Kirielis,6,Tue Jun 2 10:25:53 2015 UTC,"Some of the basics- sexual attraction and romantic attraction are separate things.  In popular culture they are conflated (when it's unusual to see any depiction of relationships other than straight romance coupled with straight sex, it's easy to assume they go hand-in-hand).  So you can be asexual and still experience romantic attraction.  On the other hand, sex repulsion or sex aversion isn't part of asexuality.  It is common for aces to be sex-repulsed, but asexuality is strictly a lack of experiencing sexual attraction.  Do you want feel a pull to have sex with people, but simply find the act itself repulsive?  That would be allosexual (meaning: not asexual) but sex-repulsed.  From your description you do not experience sexual attraction- which is the very definition of asexuality.  But I threw the other one in there simply because it's so commonly overlooked within a hypersexual society.  You do not have to be a particular age to identify as asexual.  For crying out loud, nobody questions toddlers expressing straight romantic feelings/behaviors (""aww, it's so cute, Tommy kissed the little girl in his preschool!"") and it's purely the fact that non-hetero sexualities are frowned upon that creates this question of ""Well, how do you know?  You're not old enough to know yourself.""    For that matter, the LGBT+ community has strongly emphasized sexuality and gender as ""born"" identities in order to achieve greater legitimacy.  Unfortunately this also tends to erase people whose sexuality and/or gender is fluid over the course of their life.  It's perfectly ok to identify as asexual now and realize it no longer fits later.  Fluidity is a valid part of the human spectrum of behavior.  So you don't need to worry so much about it being true ""forever and always"" if it fits you now."

We haven’t talked a whole lot about the future, although the current group of roommates has agreed to stay together pretty much as long as the situation is still working out for all of us, which is a form of commitment, I guess.  She’s also my emergency contact for a whole ton of stuff, so I’m not expecting this relationship to end any time soon   I can think of a handful of relationships with this kind of expectation to continue.

Things that are not healthy and not good:  Someone pressuring you into doing something.  It doesn't have to just be sex.  Taking medications is a huge thing and if you don't enthusiastically want to try different meds, then he needs to cool down. Compromise (to some degree).  I hear a lot about ""asexuals should compromise for their partners).  Well they should 'compromise right back'.  It's really stressful to have a loved one try to get something from you that you don't have the energy or drive to offer.

Further, you said ""I'm on Lexapro, which I do know drastically reduces sex drive.""  Which means that you've gone from a low sex drive, to no sex drive.  That's a change, and from his point of view a change for the worse, so he wants you to try alternate medications that would lack that particular side effect.  Yes, if he has a regular sex drive, he would also serve to benefit...but my interpretation of what you said implies that he is concerned about you and your happiness, too.

If your boyfriend is unhappy but you two have an otherwise good relationship, compromise and discussing the situation seems like a healthier way to go than medication."

asexuality,380859,chiisaihimitsu,4,Sun May 31 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"To an allosexual, yes, there's going to be some amount of rudeness to not being present in the moment enough to not be thinking about everything one would rather be doing instead, especially monotonous tasks like drawing up shopping lists and memorizing them and then saying so.  Of course, generally speaking someone's sexual performance is going to decrease by a noticeable amount if one is preoccupied with something else, which is liable to prompt a query as to where one's mind actually is instead of on the task at hand.  It's going to be taken in many cases as a form of emotional alienation, I think, in addition to being a faux pas."
asexuality,380859,SilenceLeRoman,3,Mon Jun 1 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"Oh yep I do this! No one I've been with has ever said anything about it, but I could tell at least one person got kind of annoyed with me. But I can't help it. My body can enjoy the sensations or whatever, but my mind will still be bored as hell. And, generally, talking to people is my favorite part of being with people, so if I interrupt a kiss to talk about whatever has popped into my mind, it's only making the experience better to me."
asexuality,380859,intestinal_turmoil,2,Mon Jun 1 16:01:32 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that I haven't had sex in many years, but I was married once, and your questions brought back some memories I haven't thought about in ages.   Sex was very boring for me. I would dissociate from the act: my body was taking part out of marital obligation, but I simply could not engage my mind. I needed music on - not romantic music, just anything with lyrics so I could focus on that and, I suppose, drown out the sex sounds.  A couple of times I really did try to stay focused on my husband - and he noticed that I was more ""into it"" (I really wasn't, but I was trying) and he responded by going on even longer than usual and telling me how good it felt. But it was very boring for me. It was like going to the dentist or waiting in line at the DMV.   Conversation is the most intimate thing I do so it wouldn't seem at all weird to me to start talking about a tv show or what's for dinner while my husband was going at it. But my husband would want to talk sex talk, which was unappealing to me, so I told him I preferred silence except for the radio. The less we spoke, the sooner it'd be over.  At the time I didn't know what ""asexual"" meant. I just thought my husband had a raging libido and that it was normal for women to not be into sex.  Obviously if I'd known about asexuality I wouldn't have married at all."
asexuality,380859,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Wed Jun 3 02:08:45 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting. I'm also the same way with sex talk, it just feels very awkward. ""You want it, don't you?"" No, no I don't. In that scenario, do I lie to make him happy, or do I tell the truth and ruin the mood? Maybe I should try putting on some music...  I hope that one day ""asexuality"" is a term that people are more familiar with. It's hard to tell that you're missing something when you don't know what it is."
asexuality,380gwu,mrllama12,1 point,Sun May 31 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I never find myself thinking sexual things like that, either. I imagine most if not all asexuals are the same - we lack sexual attraction to other people, so that's just the way it is.   I myself am also aromantic, so I don't even find myself wondering things like ""how would a date with her be like"", and I'm also a bit of a loner so I don't really care about wondering what kind of friend she would be. When I pass by anyone I normally just completely ignore them.   But that's just me. You may think differently than your friends, but based on only that you just sound more mature than them. But if you ask yourself, ""if I got to know her and liked her, is it possible that I would also want to have sex with her"" and you answer yes, then maybe you're a romantic and prefer an emotional relationship before a physical one. In which case, maybe you'd more successfully identify as a demisexual.   But since your main question is: ""Is this a normal thing in asexuals, or even a thing at all?"" I'm reasonably comfortable saying that yes, that is typical behavior for an asexual.   I hope that helps somehow. Please don't be afraid to ask more questions. I also don't claim to be any expert on the matter or anything, I can only give advice and input based primarily on my own experiences."
asexuality,37v0xl,Terracorner,9,Sat May 30 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"I've started and restarted this response several times. I think there are several different questions you could be asking here, that are all interesting.  Was there a big shift in beliefs when you started identifying as asexual? For me, the answer is no. The definition of ""asexual"" as ""lack of sexual attraction"" is all over this subreddit, and this definition doesn't imply an beliefs (or lack thereof). That said, my beliefs changed a lot in the years leading up to my discovery of the asexual label - but there wasn't anything about sexual attraction.  Has identifying as asexual led to new beliefs? I wouldn't say that they are new beliefs, but I started noticing a number of things I used to take for granted. For example, ""sexy"" is an adjective I've never used, and now I understand that it's because I don't feel sexual attraction. A friend suggested that asexuality has certain similarities with being blind, that it might be equivalent to missing a sense - and that's something that I think about every so often. So it's more like explicitly recognizing asexuality has prompted new thoughts, but not new beliefs.  Does identifying as asexual contradict your previous and/or current beliefs about sex/romance? Not really. I share some of OP's beliefs about emotional intimacy, and those fit asexuality well. This question made me realize that people don't really have active ideals about sexual behavior - there's no positive maxim of ""thou should have sex"", only negative maxims of ""thou shall not have sex with ...""."
asexuality,37v0xl,surnia,4,Sat May 30 22:16:54 2015 UTC,"All of the above, though I was going for the third originally. I have to wonder if such expectations/ideals/beliefs/ (there's no word that really fits perfectly) are influenced under the hood by asexuality from a young age, or if a large fraction adopt more conventional expectations."
asexuality,37v0xl,surnia,4,Sun May 31 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"Ah. I think something that didn't get across in my comment above is that for me, asexuality wasn't a revelation - it just was more a ""huh, so there's a word for this"". My beliefs before I recognized definitely leans towards asexuality.  For example, I used to hold the standard conservative view that sex is only for two people who love each other, etc. etc.. Crucially, I used to justify my lack of desire to have sex based on that - that I would want to have sex with someone if I loved them enough. It took a couple years before I finally disentangled the two things, and I'm sure that helped me eventually realize that I'm asexual (and that sex is just another physical activity)."
asexuality,37v0xl,TomKat710,3,Sun May 31 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. Upon learning what asexuality was, I was like 'yep, sounds like me, yep, I feel that way too.' Nothing has changed. I aligned perfectly with all the things that are considered asexual and still do!"
asexuality,37v0xl,artisanrox,3,Sun May 31 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"*Was there a big shift in beliefs when you started identifying as asexual?* Nope.  Discovering the asexy and aro-ace labels have not changed my views at all.   *Has identifying as asexual led to new beliefs?*  Nope.  It simply validated everything I felt about relationships.  *Does identifying as asexual contradict your previous and/or current beliefs about sex/romance?* Nope.  I wouldn't say it contradicts what I think, but what I CAN say is that I can now define my views on relationships with a laser focus now that I have the right words for things, unlike before when I was struggling to tread water...not understanding anything about them, anything about others, and NOTHING about myself."

asexuality,37twwz,Iheart2,17,Sat May 30 10:33:43 2015 UTC,"This is a question only he can answer in the specific since we all have different needs. Those guys in r/askmen are just letting you know what would make them feel special. We can give you similar feedback, but in the end, you have to discover what makes your SO feel special. These things might not be what would make any of us feel special.  My general advice is to pay attention to what he wants or needs and commit now to working with him to find a shared solution that enables you to help him satisfy that need. Work together to create a shared spare where you both feel welcome and invited to discuss your needs and find shared solutions.  For example, my wife knows I need to be alone a lot. A LOT. It's how I recharge, and most social interactions drain me quickly. She is fairly extroverted, so it isn't natural for her to give me alone time. Which makes me feel all the more special when she leaves me alone. It feels totally bizarre to her, but one way she makes me feel special is by not doing anything at all :)  A good place to start the conversation with your future SO could be Gary Chapman's book The Five Love Languages. You might find out some interesting things about him. For example, one of the love languages is Physical Touch. It could be that even though he doesn't feel sexual attraction, he still needs non-sexual physical touch to feel loved. But then that could also end up being something he doesn't care about :)"

Just take a deeper look at what he cares about in terms of hobbies, his personality, showing that you care about him and who he is. Little presents that are totally lined up with who he identifies with are quite awesome and make you feel special in general.   Other than that, if casual conversation exploring his needs and thoughts are not enough, you might want to propose a travel with him to someplace you both enjoy. Or using those reminders of awesome times you spent together (photo albums, videos, and showing he is special to you).  Honestly I wouldn't like to receive the last ones, but the aforementioned items seem to be the most romantic-effective ways to ""show someone you care about them and how they are special"" I can think of."

asexuality,37ovby,avaflava1,12,Fri May 29 06:09:10 2015 UTC,"It probably doesn't help that you're young. When I was that age I had never even heard about asexuality, but was constantly being told I'd grow into sexual attraction, that I was just a late bloomer, etc.  It is, unfortunately, probably something you'll have to deal with for a while because most people either don't know or don't care to learn about it. Many people still assume that it is only due to some sort of trauma in your past and that you can force yourself to change with therapy.  You have tried to educate them, but you can not force them to understand. And if you try too hard to force it down their throats, they may be a little defensive. The ""you're just going through a phase"" argument.  I'd say, go ahead and show your pride, but don't try to make it constantly the center of attention.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but they don't seem to be actively hateful about it. Just passively, whether it is because they don't believe it is a thing or because they think you'll grow out of it.  Persistence may just be the key. Identify the way you feel is best. Don't be annoying with trying to force them to understand. And hope that within a few years they will learn to accept it.  It's difficult having a sexuality that even the rest of the queer community has trouble taking seriously."

My mother is actually a little better than my dad in this regard, but I know she still doesn't really believe me so won't really talk about it.

asexuality,37ovby,kilkil,2,Fri May 29 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this helps but I'm 17 now and i went through something very similar at your age. I don't really have any formal advice because I'm still dealing with coming out currently. I'll just tell you what happened and hopefully it will stop you from getting hurt. At the time I was very depressed and the thought that my mother would accept the fact that my older sister was a lesbian easily but was unable to accept me as an asexual while denying that such a thing existed and asking me if I had ever been abused and telling me that I was too young to know such a thing was not encouraging. I was attending group therapy for older teens at the time, and a couple of the members of the group were also queer and stressed about coming out to their more conservative parents. I had brought up the topic of alternate sexualities such as bisexual and pansexual and the response had been flippant at best, dismissive and harsh at worst, so I don't know what I was expecting when I brought it up on the way home from the meeting. I tried at first to just say it, but maybe I came off as too aggressive because my mother was immediately prickly, and she quickly shut me down. I wasn't really in a good state to be talking to her about it in all honesty, and I immediately started crying and was unable to come up with any decent data or a rebuttal, which I had researched previously. It was like trying to convert a church full of deeply religious Christians to Buddhism and I regretted bringing it up right after I started trying to talk again. When I got home and tried to talk to my sister about it, strangely she was also similarly dismissive. I would have thought that her being queer would account for something, but apparently even minorities can discriminate against other minorities. I haven't even thought about approaching the subject with my dad because he still has problems accepting the more visible aspects of the LGBTQIA community. Now whenever my mom brings up sex or sexuality, I automatically anticipate mocking or ignorant behavior. The best you can do to stop yourself from being hurt by your family is to help them understand you.   So maybe I do have solid advice, or at least valid recommendations.  * Wait until you're older. If age is an issue, if you wait the issue will resolve itself. (this is what I'm holding out for tbh haha)  * Alternatively, plan what you want to say and anticipate refusal. Gently encourage the parent/relative to listen to you because what they think matters to you and you are serious about what you have to say. (I'm thinking a powerpoint presentation but maybe that's too aggressive ha)  * Timing is really important if you choose to confront the situation. Make sure both you and the parent/relative that you want to talk to are in a good mood and that both parties can approach the situation  rationally and calmly. (I did not do this the first time and let me tell you that is one of my biggest regrets.)  In the end, they're your parents and even if they might not understand you, they don't need to to love you. I really hope it goes well for you should you try to talk to them again, but if not I hope you can wait for more visibility. If you wait, I don't think you have to wait too long tbh, asexuals are going the way of homosexuals on the path to visibility. Good luck and stay healthy :)"

Do you think this necessarily means she doesn't take you being asexual seriously? Do you have more reasons to believe that? It might not actually be the reason she was exasperated with the necklace. If you want, you could just ask her for her honest opinion on asexuality.   he flat out refused to talk about it with me and said he would when he was ready.   I can see why that might be a problem, but this is the kind of problem that solves itself, over time. While I don't really know anything about you or your dad, it seems like pressing him for a discussion might not be the best thing to do.   I have other issues with other family members as well.

I have the same reaction to porn and erotica, figured sex was a milestone and those ~feelings~ would come later.  I struggled for a long time to figure out why people seemed to be talking about something different when it came to attraction/sexual attraction.  I didn't realize they were separate but once I did, everything seemed to clear up a little.  To me, it sounds like you're ace!  You're not required to ID with that or anything but it might help when explaining things to partners in the future!   I'd be happy to talk with you more about it if you have questions or just need to talk.  Navigating the whole asexual thing isn't horrible but it's not as easy as being allosexual either. Add in the fact that you have a libido and it gets a little weirder since (for some weird reason) a lot of people, aces included) don't seem to believe you can be asexual and still want to masturbate.    I wish you all the best though! :D"
asexuality,37ie7d,smoteymote,3,Wed May 27 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"It makes me feel better knowing I'm not alone in this. The milestone thing is so correct; like its something that you're supposed to do, maybe with the right person or maybe as fun. Feelings and shit would come and you'd see stars and it'd all be grand.   I don't know if I've reached that attraction/sexual attraction thing yet. If I see an attractive person, I can appreciate it; man or woman. But if I see a person I find attractive, I think ""I'd bang that"", but I know I never would even if offered. But then part of me thinks I would, and then it gets confusing. I have sexual attraction so merged with anything else, as a lot of people do, that it kinda makes me feel bad a bit. I can appreciate the body, and maybe fantasize in erotica and shit, but I'd never really wanna be physically a part of it. It was never me in the equation. I could imagine two people going at it, but when I'm involved, it feels awkward and wrong.  I do think I am Ace, but it still feels like I should be something else. I hope my brain recognizes this soon. I know its a fluid spectrum, but it still feels like I'm doing something wrong. I know that there is nothing wrong with me, but it feels like I should be ""normal"" and shit. Idk.  I don't know. I figured masturbation was a normal thing with libido and all, but I have no idea what's normal anymore. I guess it's the standard, normal has no spectrum shit, but I'd like a straight answer I know I'm not gonna get.   Thank you"

I think finding a community can help - being able to read up on things and learn more can be really useful.  Finding people who have similar experiences, even if they're not exactly the same as yours is incredibly validating too.   But if I see a person I find attractive, I think ""I'd bang that"", but I know I never would even if offered.   This is definitely something I think a lot of ace-spectrum peeps struggle with.  Many of us have spent so long internalizing society's expectations, terms, and views that it's a little hard to get away from it.  I still say ""I'd tap that"" when I see someone attractive but all I really mean is, ""Damn that person is really good looking and I would not be opposed to cuddling with them at some point."""
asexuality,37ie7d,seirianstar,9,Fri May 29 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"Your experience is pretty normal I think. We get inundated with ""you haven't found the right person yet"" as an excuse for all kinds of stuff- why relationships don't work out(no, sometimes it's you), why the sex is bad(maybe you just don't like sex), why people are gay(nope, they're gay, can't make them ungay). That sentence seems like a blanket excuse that makes no sense at all. People are the way they are, it's not because they haven't found some magical person.  Anyway, enjoying being found attractive and desirable(enjoying flirting) has no bearing on sexuality. It has to do with how we are perceived on the outside. Most of us want to be deemed desirable, whether we're straight or on the LGTBQIA spectrum.  By the way, aces can have different romantic orientations. For example, there can be bi-romantic aces, homo-romantic aces, hetero-romantic aces, pan-romantic, etc.   Aces can also be aromantic(meaning they're not into the cuddly, mushy stuff). It's very possible for an aromantic ace to want a platonic, long term relationship with an opposite sex partner, same sex partner, genderqueer partner, etc.   Keep on being you, find out what works and what doesn't, label-wise, relationship-wise, sex-wise, and all that. Don't put pressure on yourself! It's ok to be in the process of figuring things out. It's ok to think you're one way now, and then later, feel like another label fits better, or no label or a label that's something you created!"
asexuality,37ie7d,seirianstar,2,Thu May 28 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"You're making me tear up. Thank you very much for that. I'm gonna look for into the sub-sections and see if I find anything that ""clicks"" with me.   I don't even know if I want a life partner in a relationship. Maybe in the future when I figure everything out more, I suppose I'll know more. It's hard not to put pressure on myself, but I know its something that can't be rushed. I just feel like I have to decide now and figure out what is best for me. I hope it comes soon, it feels hurt I suppose- or maybe sick. Its not a good mind set, but I do like stability and this is way the opposite of that."

She travels, she acts in plays, she writes(just got a book published last year actually), she makes art, she does what she pleases because she doesn't have to take a partner(or kids) into consideration in regards to her plans.   I myself am either bi-romantic and ace or panromantic and ace. I'm still figuring it out. And, I have a romantic partner of the opposite sex right now but I've considered the possibility of platonic partner in the future. It's just a thought because I'm not really interested in looking for anyone else. Dating is hard and I think if it ever came to the point where I got single again, I'd just forgo the whole dating scene!  I'm glad I could help."

If right now, the term ""asexual"" describes you well, feel free to use it.  If it doesn't make sense later on, then so be it.    But as long as you feel like identifying as asexual works for you now, we welcome you into this space as a fellow ace.    *internet hugs or suitable equivalent*"

I don't feel like I am asexual, more of a confused Heterosexual. I know Asexuality is what describes me best, but it's hard to change my thought process. I've been Heterosexual, or I thought, for so long it feels odd to change. It's part of life I suppose.  Internet hug"

For a good while,  I also felt like a confused heterosexual. I became a bit nervous around pretty girls,  I found myself staring at people in ways that to anyone else would be sexual. But, I had never desired to screw anyone,  pretty girl or otherwise. For that reason, I know I'm asexual."
asexuality,37ie7d,PastyJournalist,2,Thu May 28 17:30:27 2015 UTC,"If it helps, it is okay to identify as both, or to go with ""grey-asexual."" I personally identify as straight-but-grey-ace. This is shorthand for me for the fact that:   1: I'm a woman who is romantically attracted to men, but   2: I haven't experienced anything that I've been able to identify as sexual attraction, though   3: I could see myself potentially experiencing sexual attraction under the right circumstances, and  4: I don't know where I'll fall in practice on the sex-repulsed to sex-positive scale.   So basically, I feel straight but ace, with some caveats that I'm still feeling ""hell if I know"" about.   Chances are there's more than one thing about my description of me that doesn't match with your description of you, but I hope this helps some while you're trying to figure yourself out."

I'm not too sure it's as simple as ""finding the right guy"" - but I've kept telling myself the same thing. What do you like about identifying yourself about being asexual? What sort of freaks you out?"
asexuality,37ie7d,21stPilot,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:16:01 2015 UTC,"As a kid I'd always had thoughts of sex, right? Like, what kid doesn't.   I didn't think about sex as a kid at all.  Well, OK, I said ""Oh, that makes a lot more sense than what I had come up with based upon how space craft docking ports work,"" when I found out how vaginas work.  Then I went back to pretending to beat up space pirates in space.  Because I was like, 9.    Ain't none of my peers were thinking about sex until around 12-13, aside from one or two of them who walked in on older siblings or their parents having sex.     I am curious as to what and how and why you were thinking about sex as a kid, though, especially since you're not interested in it except in the form of erotica that's then used as a masturbatory aide.  Especially since your word choice makes it sound like you would have been thinking about sex a lot as a pre-sexual child that hadn't even started puberty.   Everyone was banging everyone and discovering themselves and all that.    I can assure you that everyone was not, in fact, banging everyone and most of those rumors were complete fabrications made to gain status, fit in, or to harm a rival's social standing.  So you can probably let go of that as a concern.   I always thought that it would kick in later, true love and all that. But so far, it really hasn't.    That's because that's not how it works at all.  Not even for demisexuals who are the closest to fitting whatever lessons you internalized during your formative years that gave you this belief.   And the idea of him doing that about me felt a bit foreign and odd.   About you?  That's an interesting way to phrase it.  Why do you put it that way?   I blamed the relationship failing on sex, and I kinda still do; we had different priorities. I can go a week without contact, but he couldn't. I don't like cuddling and shit, and he always did.    That already sounds like a fair bit more than just sex and also touches upon physical and verbal expressions of intimacy that may or may not be representations of or tied to emotional intimacy.   What gets me is that I like flirting. I like the idea of people finding my attractive or desirable, but not the idea of sex. I like people thinking i'm pretty- I'm not bi, but I can appreciate it. But I would just never want to go any further, I don't know if that's even normal for asexuality or not   Fairly uncommon but not unheard of in my experience.  Partially because intentionally flirting with people without being interested in the first place has unsavory connotations.    And can lead to very uncomfortable situations if the other parties escalate or read flirtation as sexual interest, as some are wont to do.   I'm pretty sure I'm Asexual, but a part of my mind is going.    Sounds like you're probably asexual but your wording makes it seem almost like you wish you were demisexual in order to try to reclaim something of the mantle of normalcy you apparently feel you have lost by not being interested in sex or romance and hoping that True Love will conquer all for you."

asexuality,37dsit,Musichead2468,23,Tue May 26 22:05:58 2015 UTC,"Dude but what if I WANT to be a robot? I mean seriously, give me a fucking awesome chassis and LASERS FOR EYES and METAL CLAWS like yesterday, I would sign up so fucking fast to be a cyborg. Plus no more need for genitals or pooping or whatever (unless robots can get diarrhoea, I don't think they can, right?).  More seriously though - I think this article is pretty silly. It's not about robots or not, it's about how robots are depicted. Wall-E is a touching story that anyone can empathise with and the robots in most of the cases the author is complaining about are written as fully realized characters with their own goals and aims and personalities. I'd be PERFECTLY FINE being seen or depicted as an AI in a story where AIs are seen as equivalent to persons. Like most of those AI stories are all about questioning that anyway. Non-biological personhood? Sign me the fuck up!   But anyway, if you were depicting asexuals as less than human or less like people, I'd have a problem with that. I don't think robots or AIs are necessarily less than human or less like people, which is basically the thing. I think most stories in them exist to make people question what it is that makes us human, and BY AND LARGE they come to the conclusion that it's NOT biology, it's not urges or sexuality, but the human desire to strive and human emotions above that. In which case, bring on the robot representation, it's great. This just reads like the author reaaaaally wants to be oppressed, honestly."
asexuality,37dsit,gyrfalcons,2,Wed May 27 02:28:25 2015 UTC,Couldn't have put it better myself.
asexuality,37dsit,Kali711,9,Wed May 27 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well, that and like - it bugs me that his main point is basically 'oh no there aren't human asexual characters let's just have them' without much consideration for the form of representation even. I'd sum up my main issues with it as two things:    he's missing the point of robot stories badly and just wanting MORE REPESENTATION doesn't take into account what sort of representation and what it does   Robot stories aren't supposed to be analogies for asexual experiences to begin with, but if you want to talk about how stories like that should be done, what WOULD be nice would be stories and media and films about characters in relationships where sex and romance aren't seen as the endgoal or end points or best ends or that sort of thing. So I wouldn't be all up in arms for more asexual characters, but would rather advocate for more STORIES that say its okay to not be romantic or sexual.   Representation is a tricky subject to talk about and there are different ways to do it. You can have:   the randomly background character who is a thing and who exists; the character who possesses this trait has a meaningful story even if minor;  the character has a meaningful story ALL ABOUT THAT TRIAT LOOK HOW GAY OR TRANS OR ACE OR QUEER OR WHATEVER THEY ARE   and frankly there's a good amount of the first AND the third, and I'm not saying they shouldn't exist (I'm glad they do, honest) but more of the second would be really nice. Meaningful stories where characters overcome obstacles and achieve their aims and goals and become awesome buddies and that IS seen as worth it in itself... and they don't have dramatic sex at the end of it and that's ok too.   So that does bug me - that his whole deal is on representation!!! But that he never really considers HOW it's done or what the stories would be about or how meaningful they would be. Also that he rags on robots and that's just not nice; leave the robots alone, they weren't even MEANT to be asexual representation to begin with and whining about that is actually misrepresenting the asexuals who would ABSOLUTELY HAPPILY BE GIANT STOMPY ROBOTS if the option existed for them to be.   Edit: Mad Max Fury Road is actually a good example of this kind of thing like - there are two characters! And they don't like each other but they grow to respect each other along the way! And there is SERIOUS ass kicking and adventures! And they do not fall in love and fuck each other and it is awesome and rare and this never happens, let's just have more of this please."

asexuality,37dsit,one-over-137-ce,6,Thu May 28 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"The article started out with a very good point -- both about lack of characters that could be considered asexual in popular media and about how robot stories can sometimes represent asexuality in their own ways.  But then it takes a disappointing left turn about the author becoming personally indignant over being represented by robots. He seemed to have missed the point about most AI stories right off the bat -- especially with the ""lack of free will"" remark. That's kind of the point of AI stories!  I can understand wanting more non-robot representations of asexuality, but I don't understand the bashing of having the robot stories as one of the representations. Sci-fi is supposed to use exotic premises and settings to demonstrate day-to-day ideas and values to pursue, and some stories about artificial intelligence are excellent in general for exploring how different ways of thinking and being (including the exploration of strong emotional bonds without sex or romance) can be equally valid. Most of the time the message is to not infringe upon or look down on those ways of being because of the package it comes in -- such as ""being a robot"" or ""being asexual"" -- so the author's reaction strikes me as incredibly ironic.  TL;DR This guy's gonna be in the first wave of extermination when the robots rise up"
asexuality,37dsit,MaiTerra,3,Wed May 27 09:40:58 2015 UTC,"The thing with robots and the like is that I don't even count them as being representative of asexuals. Like, they're robots, it's NORMAL for them to not feel any sort of sexual attraction and most people accept that. The thing about asexuals, and the reason I pesonally would like more representation, is because so many don't understand us, since to their minds it's abnormal for a human to not care so much about sex or sexual attraction or what have you. Sure, nobody looks twice when a robot doesn't care about how hot someone is, but when a person doesn't care, that's a totally different story suddenly. I'd like to see more characters who are noted to be asexual, and I'd like it to be acknowledged and talked about so that hopefully people of other sexualities could understand a bit better. Just saying ""Oh, they're asexual cause they're a robot/plant/living rock"" doesn't count."

Not that many people see my characters, because most of them are D&D characters or characters in little short stories that wouldn't be nearly good enough to publish... but at least they exist.    I get that it's frustrating never seeing asexual people represented in popular media. But in this case, if you want something done, it looks like you're going to have to do it yourself.   Someday, I'm sure asexuality will be well known and well represented. But only if we start writing about it, instead of complaining that nobody else is."

Like, I find them all gross and I don't want anything to do with them, so anything with hands and mouths is especially gross to me. But I don't mind PIV sex because it's kind of like out of sight, out of mind, so I don't really have to think about it as much and it feels nice, too, so that's a perk.

asexuality,376ifo,21stPilot,3,Mon May 25 23:59:03 2015 UTC,"With men, shorter or more outlandish tend to be considered severe.  Typically the cuts we like are very short, very military looking, but still styled, and a bit out of the ordinary.  For example,  a buzz cut is fun...but the flattop is a particular favorite in the haircutting community.  The shorter and more severe the flattop, the better it is received.  The USMC version, often called a horseshoe, is a particular favorite.  Unfortunately, it is now out of regs.  Happily, the only outward sign of this fetish, unlike some, is impeccable grooming.  I've gotten as many as two haircuts a week to maintain some of my styles.  And, I enjoyed the precision and experience...more than others likely would.  Here is a good example of a severe flattop haircut, on a friend of mine actually.  https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8044/8437022778_1e7560b6b6.jpg"

asexuality,37256o,intheshape,11,Sun May 24 21:46:14 2015 UTC,"The often-cited 1% statistic, from my understanding, is from a survey issued in Great Britain in the 1990s, and 1% of the respondents answered a question about sexual attraction with ""I have never experienced sexual attraction to either gender."" I think because the statistic is so old, and it cuts out those who identify as grey or demi, as well as those who couldn't articulate the differences between romantic and sexual attraction, it consequently low-balls the current number of people who identify as asexual.  Other factors that could contribute to it include the relative fluidity of college-age individuals when it comes to identifying their sexual orientation- younger individuals are more likely to label themselves something non-heterosexual than older generations, and in a survey of nothing but 20-somethings, the number identifying as ace goes up.  But I'm not sure, and would like to hear others' ideas."

Not to mention I'm ugly and have no job or skills or family or social network so there's no way to even meet the people who wouldn't want to be involved in my life anyways.

asexuality,373kfx,chuckawoodchuck,6,Sun May 24 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"1, asexuality is not something you get to choose.  It is a fact, not an option.  2, asexuality does not mean that you have no desire to pair up.  That would be aromanticism, and I know no medication that would cause that.  Maybe depo provera, but that chemically castrates you.  Not a good thing.  3, you have more than a few issues, apparently quite deep.  I get that you are in therapy, but if it is helping, it is obviously not helping enough.  4, by your own admission your life is in shambles.  What you are doing and what you are believing, obviously, isn't working.  Maybe it is time to look deep and reconsider what you believe and why?  5, troubled though you may be, why are you not able to accept yourself as you are?  I am truly asking...and I'm a bit concerned about you, based on some of the things you've said."
asexuality,373kfx,redneckgymrat,1 point,Mon May 25 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"I've looked up chemical castration but none of the effects said anything about becoming aromantic. It just kills your sex drive. I had already considered chemical castration as the means for the end I desire but nothing out there shows that it works in that respect.  Why is chemical castration bad? It's effective, has few side effects and if for some reason I needed to it's totally reversible.  No the therapy isn't helping but I've been in therapy for the majority of my life and it has never helped so no surprise there.  Why am I not able to accept myself? Because I am a total failure who has no friends or family and have become everything I hate."
asexuality,373kfx,Paraglad,1 point,Mon May 25 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"Then, I hope you don't mind my bluntness...you've been in therapy for your entire life and by your own admission it isn't helping.  Why would you continue in therapy?  Start at the beginning.  What, fundamentally, is wrong?  Plenty of people are total failures without asking what you are asking.  Failure is a lot more common than most people like to admit.  You have become everything you hate?  Like what?  I know it sounds almost insultingly simple, but it really is true.  The power to change is within each of us.  We are each capable of change...but most of us do not avail ourselves of that choice."

That said, I find myself using rhetoric I find questionable and that upsets him, thus far.  For instance, he goes on about how it feels to have a sex drive he can do nothing with, and I go on about how it has felt being on the other end of that sex drive. Somewhat dickish of me, but there's often the problem of his emotional states taking precedence above mine at all times, so I've been trying to establish a foothold.  Which he seems to respect after I explained it to him, but, I suppose, day 1 of talking about it may not have been the time to stake my claim to emotional care.  Another communication issue thus far is that he's referring to his asexuality as a disorder and freaking out a fair bit about how he'll never have a happy, normal, relationship, but I've tossed a few pamphlets at him after calling our relationship normal, so I may have done as much as I can there, too."
asexuality,371pnc,virtua,4,Sun May 24 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend taking a look at AVEN's Sexual Partners, Friends and Allies subforum and posting if or when you feel comfortable. It's a welcoming and supportive space and quite cathartic for a lot of people who have nowhere to turn when they find out about the sexual incompatibilities in their own relationships. There are a number of people there who are in mixed orientation relationships (asexual and sexual), many of whom are also in polyamorous relationships, so if you have any questions about it, that subforum would certainly be a good starting place.  Also, for resources about polyamory, I'd suggest starting with More than Two.  Edit: I also found this thread on AVEN about a couple who are deciding to open up their relationship to be very helpful."

I think, as long as you are open with your potential partner, you could have a committed relationship. Many asexuals do. I'm not one of them, so someone else would have to give you advice on that. But I do know that there are couples where one partner is sexual and the other is asexual, and I know that they have gotten it to work. How each couple handles it is different. I tell you this so that you know that it is not impossible for you to have a relationship.  You could also look into having a relationship with another asexual.

On one side, if it helps people understand themselves better, its great. But, how is it different from an asexual with a sex drive? Is it?  I think it might be unnecessary in the sense that it does not describe a different orientation. That part about desiring a sexual relationship...that could be due to upbringing/society/factors not within the individual, whereas orientations are due to the individual, not external forces.

asexuality,36tlmc,osteopath17,2,Sun May 24 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Cupiosexual doesn't describe an asexual with a sex drive. The ""desire"" in the definition refers to the desire to have sex with someone else and not a physiological sex drive. It arose out of a need to distinguish between asexuals who do not feel sexual attraction but still have a desire/want/urge to have sex with another in and of itself and not for any external reason because it seemed counter-intuitive to many to describe a person who desires to have sex with a partner for its own sake as asexual."

Personally I think it's a bit unnecessary, like straight people don't say they're looking for a relationship as its own term, they just say ""I'm (not) interested in a relationship"". What someone wants to do in the bedroom is there decision and (in my opinion) private, and doesn't need to be announced as a specific orientation.

Your friend isn't telling you with God's voice that ""BEHOLD, USER /U/ACEOFHEARTS95, TREMBLE; YOU ARE NOT ASEXUAL, YOU ARE A HEALTHY HETEROSEXUAL MALE. YOU'RE SHY TOO, LOL, GET REAL""  Your friend's opinion is his own. It's his interpretation of reality, not reality itself-- and that interpretation is painfully off base.  People act really, really stupid when they're together. I have this interesting saying, let me share it with you.   People in a group are simultaneously more than and less than the sum of their individuals.  Together, people can account for their biases and come to the best conclusions. Together, people can design rockets and submarines.   Yet, together, people are stupid as hell, unwilling to think, trusting that the person on their left has already evaluated whatever simple concept comes up.  People don't create reality with their thoughts-- they create their interpretation of reality with their thoughts-- and sometimes people are unimaginably stupid.  These are my suggestions, in no particular order.   Reject the people who hurt you. That's totally within your rights. They were terrible to you, they demonstrated that they didn't really know you (I'm assuming you're not the kind of person to fish for attention), and they demonstrated that they were unwilling to think when the person next to them could crap out an easy to digest solution. I don't know about you, but people like that aren't the people I want to waste my time with. Talk to each person one on one and give them an explanation. If they still don't accept you after passionate pleas-- there's nothing you can do, other than give them time to think things over. either reject them, or live with them thinking you thirst for attention and don't know yourself.   Talk. dude. Talk, Nothing is sacred, no topic is off limits-- this includes your feelings. Tell your friends how they made you feel. Come with resources from aven and such.  But, remember one thing: you are not defending your orientation or its existence. If you 'lose' that argument  you lose an argument-- you do not lose the right to call yourself what you are-- asexual.  Best of luck."

He generally understood it and he was okay with it an won't really judge me for it, but he's a bit closed minded, partially because he has a super active sex life with his girlfriend. At a point I basically just told him to fuck off and that what may not be real to him is super real to me and that my girlfriend and I can still love each other without me needing to stick my penis inside her. He's one of my closest friends so I'm not going to stress over that shit, but if you can stand to lose this guy as a friend, tell him to fuck off and don't look back."

The only thing that separates us from other sexuals is our lack of attraction to other people/genders. So, unless you see having sexual attraction as the only way to have a sexuality, then asexuality isn't an absence of sexuality."

Absence has a very negative connotation, which I do not feel about my asexuality. I see sexuality as an addiction. It's something that fills up your mind constantly, something that you obcess over, to the point of missing out on other things.   Having an addiction is a great source of stress and pain, it is the same for sexuality; the hunt for sexual parterns, the conflicting desires, the pain of being unable to get their ""fix""... Being free from it means I can concentrate more on what is (or at least percieve as being) more important. It means that I get to decide when or if I want to have sex, not have my body force it on me at the worst of time.   Hope that helps =3"

It was fun, but pretty shallow. Lots of fights, explosions, and cool technology, though. I enjoyed it. However, I also enjoy movies that give a good story. Cast Away, The Woman in Gold, ect.   I believe that human sexuality tends to be more akin to the person who only watches action movies-- movies that are entertaining on a purely visceral level. While I'm not going to say I have the greatest taste ever in films, I do believe that people who don't appreciate 'better' movies are missing out on a lot.  I'm kinda tired and not sure if that even made sense. Basically, sexuality and its exploration would be best as an option and not a carnal prerequisite.  Is that possible, or would changing sexuality like that kill its spark? I have no idea. I'm mostly just playing around with thoughts."

It's been a long while since my last one and that was a pretty terrible relationship anyway so I don't really know how to do the whole relationship thing and I don't know if I'm able for it."
asexuality,36cf4n,thegreengiddly,4,Mon May 18 07:03:26 2015 UTC,"Being asexual can make you feel like you're broken, especially when you'd like a relationship but everyone seems to need something you can not give. But here's the trick, I think: find someone who's compatible with you. Which is something anyone - not only asexual people! - should do. It is not easy, perhaps for asexuals it is less easy than for others, but it is not impossible. When you're with someone who accepts you the way you are - be it a SO or even a friend - and who doesn't need something you can not give, nor wants you to be different, you feel better and okay with yourself. Finding another asexual person may be difficult depending on where you live, but you can still look for them, or for someone with a low libido/who's not very interested in sex. About your friends,    Their ideas of support is 'You just haven't found the right person'   Have you tried explaining to them what being asexual really means?"
asexuality,36cf4n,ver_sacrum,1 point,Mon May 18 10:00:14 2015 UTC,"I have tried explaining it quite a few times. The common responses from my group of friends were 'Well, I just don't believe that' or 'You just need God to guide you in the right direction.' I've learned that it's better to just keep my mouth shut about it. My friends are great people and have helped me tremendously even in my darkest times, but they reached a consensus on my asexuality that I'm going through a crisis and I need guidance that they can't provide.    As for finding other asexuals outside of the internet, there is a slim to very none chance in my area. It seems that everyone in my area is either looking to start a family or just looking for their next fix. There's very little grey area."

I guess it's normal you feel broken if all your friends tell you that. Within a more welcoming environment you would feel better, I think.

You're the same person you always were. Your thoughts about sex, relationships, what romance is-- all those thoughts are just as valid as they were when you thought you were straight.  Society will screw you, whether you want it to or not. Society will force your hand, will tell you what you can think and what's wrong to think. All of that is bullshit. You owe nothing to society. You owe nothing to your glorious nation. You are yourself. As a member of society, you'll at times be forced to fit certain roles, and you'll be kept from saying certain things that need to be said. But, fight that.   Society will screw you, regardless of your sexuality. Screw it back by not giving into the 'social obligations' it tries to force upon you. Be strong, be your own person. To be anything else is to let the enemy win, to let yourself become a cog to be beaten into place.  As for support-- don't bother with friends and family. They probably mean well, but it's also likely that they have no comprehension of what asexuality even is, never mind the struggles that are faced by asexual people."
asexuality,36cf4n,febice,4,Mon May 18 12:08:42 2015 UTC,"My daughter, 26, came out to me today.   I thought I had provided a very sex positive upbringing for my kids. We started going to Pride about the 2nd or 3rd grade when she first came home not understanding gay ""jokes"" on the playground. My middle son was comfortable telling me about his past poly relationship and bisexual nature. His wife is gender-fluid (I think that's the right term) and has been candid that there will not be any children in their future, which I'm good with. My youngest is unapologetic about his hetero life partner and it makes me smile.  But I never put asexual on the table as a possible personal self discovery. I feel like she had to go too long not knowing there was an perfectly acceptable way to describe herself and people who felt the same way. Worse, I've teased her for years about having children, not really because I felt a strong urge to be a gramma but I kinda felt like I should... and god damnit I don't even know why.  I told her I was proud of her for figuring out what was inside that didn't have words. I told her I would never tease her about children again. I told her I love her very much. Then I came here.   I have lots to learn. I thought I was pretty open minded and I instantly felt stupid for not having thought she might need this word and the world of understanding it gives her.  So while there is no shortage of idiots in the world, and plenty more nasty, or just plain ignorant, comments in anyone's future, please let me apologize for the simply clueless of us. I'm sorry I didn't understand sooner. Your people love you, keep explaining, be patient."

If a person is raised in, and enmeshed with, a culture which promotes traditional family values, a male bachelor over the age of 30 has a strong chance of partial exile from normative status.   I echo another commenter: ""It's totally possible"". You have the freedom maintain your opinion about sex. No one can fault you if there is no harm involved. Some people in my evangelist family want to see me have children, but I not only would never allow them near my possible kids, their opinion about how I should live my life is tossed into the trash along with their ""suggestions"" regarding proper religious doctrine."

asexuality,36aqw9,ples_ignore,33,Sun May 17 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"If you are asexual, you do not feel sexual attraction to others. A virgin with low self-esteem can still feel sexually attracted to others.  One way to think about it (this is very general and doesn't apply to all asexuals or in all cases):  Someone that is asexual doesn't care to start/enter into a sexual relationship with anyone. A virgin/anyone with low self-esteem may want the relationship but think that they cannot have one because no one will want to be in a relationship with them.  I hope this helps.  Some advice, since you are asking for a friend. If your friend says that they are asexual, please do not dismiss it just because they haven't ever had sex. At the same time, if you are concerned because they are showing other signs of low self-esteem or depression, talk to them about visiting a doctor. Either way, be there for them, and don't dismiss their thoughts or opinions without good reason.  edit: Not all asexuals are virgins. Not all virgins are asexual. Being a virgin is as related to asexuality as being a male is to being Catholic."

So I started dating and found someone I absolutely loved. She was smart, beautiful, and sweet. Literally the perfect girl... And then we reached the point in our relationship when she was expecting something more. I cared about her, so I hated that it made me sick. I would even hate kissing her, something I had enjoyed earlier in our relationship, because I knew it was just my face writing a check my ass couldn't cash. Eventually, she picked up on how I felt, and I explained to her that it wasn't fair to her to keep it going, so we broke up. It really crushed her because she loved me as well, and she thought I would eventually be ready (and she was willing to wait, but I knew it wouldn't happen). I didn't tell her that I had dated a guy and we broke up over the same thing. I didn't tell her that I had dated another woman and we broke up over the same thing. She was legit the last relationship I had before I found out I was asexual.  Before her, when I was dating my first girlfriend, I reasoned that I didn't know what I wanted and just wasn't into women. When I was with my first boyfriend, I reasoned that I just wasn't into men, and that the first girl was me just settling, so how could I possibly be attracted to her? I needed to try again. When I had met her, I had accepted that there was something fundamentally wrong with me, like a mental issue or something much more serious because I didn't even know there was something wrong. I couldn't put my finger on it because I had never experienced sexual attraction before, so I didn't know I didn't have it. I just noticed that I was different from everyone else I had dated, and I didn't understand why. So I decided that if I couldn't make it work with this one, I was going to kill myself (due to my extreme, irrational fear of being crazy without actually knowing it, then finding out another personality was killing people. Irrational because if I had split personalities, someone would know by now). Needless to say, I'm lucky I found out about asexuality.  Anyways, I tell this story so that you can learn from it. Don't question what you already know about yourself. If you don't have low self-esteem, you don't have low self-esteem. If you know you like a specific sex, then you know you like a specific sex. And you're at a bit of an advantage because you know what the alternative is, and you know that it doesn't mean you're fucked up in any way, just different.  Err... I mean, not you, your ""friend."" Yeah. Tell them that."
asexuality,36aqw9,narrativedilettante,6,Mon May 18 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"I've never felt sexual attraction. This has been true whether I'm doing great romantically and confidence wise, or when I'm suicidally depressed. That's really it, there's no further defining feature.

asexuality,36aqw9,sikfoq,3,Mon May 18 00:03:49 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the difference between trying and getting discouraged and giving up versus giving up before you get started; as the difference between getting discouraged and giving up versus wondering why you would care in the first place.  The distinction is important: if you look at it and give up because you think it's impossible, you cared enough to look in the first place.  For myself, I had always taken it for granted that people formed boyfriend-girlfriend pairs, and left it there.  Then I hung around here for a while and realized, oh, I am different from other people, and that's not weird.  It's like tutus.  I do not care about getting a tutu.  I think I'd look daft in one, but as I don't care about them it has no bearing on my self-esteem.  Some little girls absolutely want a tutu. A virgin who gave up would want it but believe they can't have it, an asexual wouldn't care about whether or not they had it because they don't want it anyway.  Since you say you're asking for a friend, I would think that they would be as confident or even more confident after realizing they're ace, partly from the self-realization and partly from ""I'm different, and that's okay"".  Whereas my stereotype of someone with no self-esteem wouldn't have any confidence at all."
asexuality,369k30,pfbale,9,Sun May 17 14:39:07 2015 UTC,"While this spesifically hasn't happened to me personally, you are not alone in it happening. It is well-reported that you can experience arousal in a sexual situation unwillingly. It even happens to people who are raped (for which I feel must be very traumatizing). Sometimes our bodies just decide to be assholes. Just remember that sexual arousal does not equal sexual attraction! They are totally different things."
asexuality,369k30,chuckawoodchuck,9,Sun May 17 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"Bodies do that. It's called arousal nonconcordance. It's common for lots of people, asexual and allosexual alike. Basically, things that seem ""sexually relevant"" to your nervous system bring about an arousal response, regardless of whether you have any interest in actually doing anything sexual at the moment.  As for what to do about it... accept that it's a physiological response, separate from your desire and attraction. Trust your mind to be the ultimate arbiter of who you are and what you want. Sometimes it feels as if our bodies are trying to tell us that we ""secretly"" do want sex even if we think we don't. That's bullshit. Our bodies don't know anything. They just do what evolution has taught them to do. I find that a mental response like ""Silly body, there's no need for arousal right now!"" helps me keep this perspective."

For a while, that cute little tingle made me question whether or not I was repressed. My conclusion, for what it's worth, is that I was and am asexual, because, like you, I don't associate arousal with sexual attraction.  Aside from chemical castration (which is an avenue that, even if I were old enough to pursue it, I would not), I really don't think there's anything to do about it. Just realize it's a thing, and come to peace with its existence."
asexuality,369k30,21stPilot,3,Sun May 17 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Arousal is a thing that happens. It can feel strange or uncomfortable and I can totally understand why it was so unwelcome and upsetting in the situation you described. I can empathise with your feelings of betrayal - when your body seems to want something that the rest of you doesn't it sucks.  This probably won't be the only time that you feel arousal. When I'm feeling sex repulsed (most of the time), I do my best to ignore it. I distract myself (if alone) or change activities (if I'm with a friend or partner) if I feel really uncomfortable. Most of the time though, I just sort of accept that it's a bodily function like any other.   Luckily, the feeling passes quickly if I don't think about it. While it's probably easier said than done, try to accept the feeling without dwelling on it. Acknowledge that you're feeling it and then move on to the other, more comfortable feelings - like feeling comfortable and happy being close to your friend. If it's really bothering you, change the situation (go back to playing video games, for instance)  Most importantly, don't worry about it too much. Again, I know it's easy for me to say, not so easy for you to do :)"

asexuality,3686zs,ExtraWingyScapula,13,Sun May 17 02:46:13 2015 UTC,"I would hope to be treated with the same respect as all of the other patients. That means my sexual orientation is not questioned or assumed to be a symptom of a disorder.  An example of when asexuality would be relevant is when monitoring for mental health issues. Sexual and gender minorities are at a much higher risk for depression and anxiety, so medical professionals should be on the lookout for that."
asexuality,3686zs,ZeroDagger,2,Sun May 17 04:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think, especially with respect to mental health issues, asexuality will always be listed as a possible symptom. Like, if you mention it, physicians and other health care workers will have to dig a bit deeper (as to whether you always have been, or if it is a recent thing, etc.).  I agree that it would be nice if it wasn't always questioned, but I would rather health care workers discover a disease than miss it because they were afraid to dig a bit deeper.  However, before any change like that could happen, there would need to be proper human sexuality courses in all medical schools. And before that happens, more people need to become aware about asexuality."
asexuality,3686zs,osteopath17,4,Mon May 18 05:05:40 2015 UTC,Five hours total in the entire health curriculum is devoted to queer issues. I just wrote a prof to say he should include ace issues in his next LGBTAQ lecture.
asexuality,3686zs,osteopath17,1 point,Mon May 18 07:15:25 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Was there at least some mention of asexuality in the course? Other than as a symptom of a disease or side effect of a drug?  But at least there is some thought behind it, and people like you are raising awareness with your professors. Here's hoping things change for the better!"
asexuality,3686zs,narrativedilettante,7,Mon May 18 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"I want health professionals to   Not assume that I've had sex, and believe me when I say I haven't Trust me when I say that I'm comfortable being single, rather than pushing me to form a relationship or assuming that I'm unhappy with my status."
asexuality,3686zs,mundabit,7,Mon May 18 04:03:07 2015 UTC,"Likewise,  I want health care professionals to stop saying my boyfriend is a ""very patient man""  when I say we haven't had sex and don't plan to. And I want health care professionals to stop referring us to couples therapy because not having sex is apparently a sign of an unhealthy relationship.   I also want my same sex relationships to be respected.  Just because I don't have sex with my girlfriend doesn't mean I am not a GSM patient,  I deserve the same level of acknowledgement as bisexual patients in same sex relationships.  Just because I have had sex before,  and have an IUD I don't plan on removing,  doesn't mean I'm looking to ""cure""  my asexuality.   When I say I have a high libido,  but I am asexual,  that needs to be respected and accepted.  I don't want a lecture on how that's not possible or how that's probably because I was sexually assaulted.  My vulvodynia is not the reason I ""chose""  to be asexual (Its not a choice)  it's a coincidence that I don't want sex,  and sex is painful. Riding my bike is also painful and I really,  really want to ride my bike."

asexuality,3686zs,ZeroDagger,5,Mon May 18 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"No, they should ask if it's relevant. In fact, I'd prefer them to ask, rather than just assuming that all patients over a certain age have had sex. I just want them to trust that I've answered honestly."
asexuality,3686zs,osteopath17,1 point,Mon May 18 06:47:56 2015 UTC,It is a normal part of every health screening to ask if the person is having sex. There is no assumption as far as I have learned and seen. It leads into conversations about healthy behavior and STDs.  Patients...lie. Lots. Or they forget. You can as a woman if she's ever had surgery and she'll say no. They you'll ask how she delivered her children and she'll say C-section. -_-
asexuality,3686zs,osteopath17,4,Mon May 18 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"I don't mind if a health professional asks if I am sexually active. But if they're not going to believe my answer, why are they even asking in the first place?"
asexuality,3686zs,ver_sacrum,2,Mon May 18 13:14:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know what experiences you have had, but it could be that they kept asking to try and clarify rather than because they didn't believe you.  Some people think that anal sex doesn't count as sex, and so when asked if they are sexually active they say no. A health care professional has to make sure they get all the information, so they will probably try to clarify what activities they are asking about.  But, it could also be that they didn't believe you, in which case you may want to consider switching to someone else."
asexuality,3686zs,ZeroDagger,2,Mon May 18 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"It may not be that the patient is lying or forgot. It may be that they do not know. Perhaps the patient did not know that a C-section is a type of surgery.  But yes, asking about sexual activity is an important part of health screening. And the conversations and information that can be obtained by both parties is essential, both to the proper care of the patient and to helping the patient be safer.  I think these conversations have to happen, even with asexuals. Because while asexuals do not have sexual attraction, many of them are still willing to have sex for a variety of reasons. Many also experiment with sex as they try to find out who they are. They need the information as much as any allosexual.  I have no idea what I am writing about anymore, or why I started this comment hahaha"
asexuality,3686zs,davros_mueller,5,Mon May 18 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"Health professionals (such as psychoterapists) should inform themselves if they don't already know what asexuality is, or if they know very little about it. You can't afford to simply assume things or rely on stereotypes when you work with health. If they think one's asexuality may be linked with health issues, I think it's their job to say so. So nothing against that. But I can't stand ignorance, so they should know before speaking."
asexuality,3686zs,VanMerwan,3,Sun May 17 18:01:16 2015 UTC,"I'm currently putting off counselling for depression as I know I'll have to answer sex questions, and odds on the screening service won't understand the concept of being ACE.   I had a therapist who was very ace-friendly. They are out there. Try to find one who deals with LGBT issues and you may have a better experience. Best of luck."
asexuality,3686zs,davros_mueller,4,Mon May 18 09:15:13 2015 UTC,"Separate attraction from libido, is a lack of attraction still a symptom of anything?"
asexuality,3686zs,lwno8,1 point,Mon May 18 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"I do believe asexuality is a special kind of sexual orientation because it can be your own sexual orientation, but it can also be a sign that your own sexual orientation has not emerged yet for some reasons.  I have Kallmann Syndrome. There is a support group of around 500 patients on Facebook. I told them about my sexual orientation (asexual). On the group, they tell their stories. Asexuality sounds very prevalent among Kallmanns, to the point I think there is a medical correlation.  There was a paper about psychosexual problems among Kallmann patients. If I remember well, we are 4x less likely to engage on a sexual activity. The study isn't about asexuality specificaly. It could be just an effect of low libido, but it is still food for thoughts.  On the facebook group, we have testimonies of people changing sexual orientation (not being asexual anymore) after the start of treatment. (It is hormonal treatment, but this not transexual perspective, this is the perspective of Kallmann patients who lack the sexual hormone production cascade up in the brain and since conception.) In my case, I'm more and more wondering if I am becoming a panromantic homosexual.)  Please. Kallmann syndrome is a rare diasease. Asexuality is a symptom (or call it a clinical correlation marquer) only if it is accompagned with other ones. It is stupid to think of a disease JUST because of asexuality only.  Please don't say Asexuality can not be a symptom. The answer is WE DON'T KNOW. Is it not ""NO"" because stories of non-Kallmann patients or fear from dogmatic asexuals who want to validate their identity at any cost. (We don't need to deny the case of Kallmann patients.)"
asexuality,3686zs,nemaline,0,Sun May 17 02:52:37 2015 UTC,Someone who never hits puberty due to a hormonal or genetic reason may never experience sexual attraction.
asexuality,3686zs,davros_mueller,10,Tue May 19 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think asexuality is any more medically relevant than heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, whatever sexuality.  I think that holding up 'look at what could cause this!' signs is a health risk. Speaking personally. I have a family history of thyroid issues, but was terrified to get it checked for years, mostly because I have no idea how to function in the dating world, who'd date a 30 year old with no dating experience? So I didn't want to be 'cured', and become not-asexual. I finally did, earlier this year, and everything's fine. Also, puberty was entirely too thorough on my body, which is all kinds of awful right now, as I'm attempting to transition to male.  Shining a medical light on a sexuality only serves to question the validity of said sexuality. It's valid. I'm hormonally healthy - although it's estrogen, while I'd prefer testosterone - and asexual."
asexuality,3686zs,davros_mueller,1 point,Sun May 17 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"My issue with how asexuality is ""treated"" is with the medical approach that assesses asexuality as a condition in contrast or deviance with a medically approved standard of health. In the same way that i do not think that the female or male gender is hormonally defined, I do not think that sexuality is hormonally defined. This definition is highly problematic as it is necessarily exclusive and will always rely on an unbalanced powwr dynamic. Because I am hormonally ""imbalanced"", my entire experience with doctors has always involved either a push for hormonal treatment to be ""normal"" or taking me on as a case study.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with my gender or my sexual orientation. As i see it, standardized hormonal  definitions are the problem.  I am trans and i am asexual. Trans friends sometimes  question my asexuality by thinking that i identify this way because I am hormonally deficient (i.e. my true gender is not fully realized because i don't take hormones) but i disagree with this. Gender and sexuality are not based on hormonal constructs."
asexuality,3686zs,davros_mueller,8,Sun May 17 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"It would be pretty easy to tell whether someone lacked sexual attraction because they hadn't hit puberty, though."
asexuality,3686zs,ZeroDagger,-1,Mon May 18 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, how do you think that's done?"
asexuality,3686zs,davros_mueller,3,Sun May 17 10:33:34 2015 UTC,"Puberty has pretty obvious effects. Look at a grown man, then a grown woman. Very different. Look at a ten year old boy, then a ten year old girl. Not so different.  Puberty causes those differences, and the combination of puberty blockers and HRT are very effective. Trans people can get results so good that you've probably met more of us than you know. There's no 'genetic' reason for men and women to look so different, it's all hormones. Even women being shorter is hormonal - estrogen causes leg bones to fuse, stop growing."
asexuality,3686zs,The_Enemys,-1,Sun May 17 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the genetics are what determines what hormones are triggered when, if at all.  Given that we have some young men coming in here and saying, ""I'm 13 and I'm asexual"", there is a small possibility that there could be an overlap between regular asexuals and an undiagnosed Kallman's patient."

I want to touch and cuddle and hug and kiss and do everything with someone I'm romantically attracted to.  I want to spend time with my friends.  I want to never be apart from someone I romantically love.  I'm happy around my friends.  I'm excited around someone I romantically love. Like even stupid little shit gets me jittery.   Anyway, that's a very romantic view of romance, and it's going to be different for everyone. It's like happiness, or red, it's just a thing, it resists explanation, it just is."

asexuality,366rpy,Ruruskadoo,6,Sat May 16 21:16:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say clingy, but it can manifest as such, sure.  It's really just what you call this big nebulous group of emotion. It's a word. I personally can't understand how anyone could have a live-together/ share everything/ intimately emotional and physical relationship that isn't romantic. The line between romanticism and aromanticism is so obscure, and so vague; it's hard to tell if it even exists, except in attitudes towards that big weird ball of feelings."
asexuality,366rpy,Cass_Griffin,1 point,Sat May 16 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"Is romanticism like clinginess to someone then?   To an outside observer, yes.  And when unrequited it can definitely get scanned that way.  Just look at anything about highschoolers or teenagers exploring romance or love or whatever for the first time and how they're viewed by the people who reject them."
asexuality,366rpy,virtua,9,Sat May 16 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I made a post a while ago about this topic which I think might help, so I'll quote it here:   I'll give you a concrete, ""mainstream,"" generally accepted usage of [...] and romantic Romantic: feelings that may involve extreme nervousness at first, infatuation, constantly thinking about and fantasizing about whoever one is romantically attracted to, joy from being around them, disappointment and other negative feelings when they're not around, feeling affectionate and wanting to express that affection towards them, deep caring, and being highly aware of their presence and in-tune with them. If you were meaning a romantic relationship, a mainstream definition of that would be a relationship where all parties have romantic feelings for each other, regard each other as romantic partner(s), and behave in a way that distinguishes (not necessarily placing the romantic partner in a ""higher"" position, but just in a different position) them from their other relationships. I think those are some concrete definitions that the majority of people can mostly identify with, but even among the majority, there are going to be aspects that don't fit the way they experience these things.   As for myself, I experienced much of what I just described, but the obsessiveness and infatuation have died down as I got better at handling my emotions. Anyway, the only difference between romantic and non-romantic feelings for me is a feeling of being acutely aware of the presence of who I'm romantically attracted to. If we're in the same vicinity, I'll have a heightened sense of awareness of what they're doing, where they are, and whether they're about to make any contact with me. We can be on opposite ends of the room but I'll know immediately if they're walking towards me. Another difference is that I won't flinch or even mind if they were to touch me and I would even feel it about to happen - when I'm usually touch-averse.   That's really the only difference between romantic and non-romantic feelings for me.   Also, to provide a contrast, this comic really gets at the feelings I experience for close friends and when I have a ""squish."""
asexuality,366rpy,nyannacat,5,Mon May 18 07:33:45 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I've thought about it, but I guess there are a few distinguishing differences.  With a friend, I'm content with showing my affection through occasional hugs and things like sitting close to them. With a partner, I want to be more personal with my affection, holding hands, kissing, cuddling, that kind of stuff.  After spending time with friends, I like to go home to unwind and relax without them, kind of like how more introverted people need time to ""recharge"" after being social. However, with someone I love romantically, I'd want to come home to them, or vice versa. Even if we had spent all day together, I still want to spend the rest of the evening relaxing in their company.  I guess just in general, for me it would be a much more personal love. I love many of my friends the same way, but with a romantic partner I would only feel that type of love for them."

The characteristics (nervousness, happiness, fantasies) of a crush can be described easily, but there's an underlying thing to the phenomenon that is much harder to impart.  Crushes are rare for me personally but I adore the feeling, even if it's obviously unrealistic to act upon given the circumstance. Something about the nervous, bashful way they influence me, coupled with a really honest appreciation of someone else, really distinguishes it from platonic interest (squish?). Much of the actions I'm led to take (cuddling, fun activities) are similar to what I'd do with friends, but the context makes it completely different."

Not only is my sect evangelical in name, but arguably not evangelical in practice or even in philosophy (depending on which church you go to), but the church's stance on homosexuality has changed drastically in the last decade.  So I can say I'm from an evangelical sect, but it wouldn't really mean anything, and I don't know what to put for the sect's stance on homosexuality because it's changed from one option to the other as I've grown up."

A polyamorous individual can still end up dissatisfied in a relationship with someone where they're not having sex with them even if they have having sex with other people in other relationships."
asexuality,3645ga,omnihotdog,22,Fri May 15 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"I hope so. My most accepting friends are homosexuals, bisexuals and of course, other asexuals. I was quite depressed due to my asexuality at the beginning of the year and I honestly don't think I would have lasted this long without this support.  I think that the more gender/sexual minorities we include in the movement, the stronger it gets. Some would argue that the movement becomes more splintered but I disagree. At the end of the day, we just want people to know that you don't have to be a cis straight person to be normal, right?  The asexual community is also full of otherwise queer people. I've noticed that many identify as trans or nonbinary, which is interesting. Many asexuals are also open to same-sex relationships (myself included.)"
asexuality,3645ga,roseandrelease,13,Sat May 16 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"I've never felt welcome in queer spaces. I'm either confronted by ignorance, lack of acceptance, or asexuality being a challenge to achieve.   I can only hope things change."
asexuality,3645ga,oskietje,9,Sat May 16 09:16:31 2015 UTC,"I think we have a space. I identified as queer long before I ever heard of asexuality. I still use 'queer' as a self identifier at times, because it's a bit easier than having to explain how I'm a gray-asexual, panromantic, poly dominant in spaces where those things aren't common knowledge.  I've also been involved in the queer community for the last 20+ years.   I frequently (not so much at the moment due to health) attend queer kink parties and don't feel out of place being there at all. If queer spaces feel right to a person (and I mean for real, not just because you're a cis-het dude who likes to watch women fuck), then they should be  welcome (Again, within reason. I don't mean men at a women's party or women at a gay men's party, etc.)"
asexuality,3645ga,Nymphetamean,9,Fri May 15 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"I identify as queer because I am panromantic, it feels more accurate than just asexual, and it's easier than busting out the whole lesson on forms and spectrums of attraction. (I also like that queer is a bit vague as a label - I like to keep people on their toes.)  I think ace spectrum people have a place in queer communities and safe spaces. I think there's a commonality there in the feeling of being broken or abnormal, and isn't part of the point of community to dispel those feelings? As long as aces (and everyone else involved) remember not to invalidate the experiences of others or talk over them, I think trying to expel aces from queer spaces is more pedantic than anything."

I think people who have that view on asexuality either don't actually believe asexuality is anything other than a ploy for attention or they hold the opinion that if you don't want to have sex, fine, just don't talk about it. I see that kind of view a lot, which I think is absolute bullshit. People can talk for days and days about sex, but if you mention ""Heh, I always feel weird when this stuff comes up because it doesn't apply to me."" suddenly you're a special snowflake crying out for attention."

At this point gender minorities are facing much more dangerous types of discrimination than sexual minorities--trans* people still get murdered on an alarmingly regular basis.  Once we achieve marriage equality, are people outside the LGBTQ community (or even certain factions within the LGBTQ community) going to keep fighting for the rights of the lesser-publicized groups?  And for the other important issues that affect the LGBTQ community? Things besides just the right to marry? I certainly hope so, because homeless LGBTQ youth are a huge issue, trans* rights still have a long way to go, and asexuals are just still working on visibility."

I know from experience since I am on a board of directors for and help run a Centre for Gender and Sexually Diverse students on a University Campus. I can also state that most forward thinking spaces are migrating towards being referred to as Gender and Sexually Diverse instead of just Queer spaces, even some high schools are switching from having a GSA to having a GSD Support Group, because a Gay-Straight-Alliance sounds like it excludes everyone else that might possibly need support.

asexuality,3645ga,Fire-Flowers,4,Sat May 16 08:29:47 2015 UTC,"Well, do we have a place in heteronormative society?  If the answer is no, (and it is), then unless the GLBT gatekeepers want to admit that they aren't nearly as accepting as they say they are, we do have a place in queer spaces.   Look at it this way, because of the emphasis placed on relationships and on sex in heteronormative soceity, anything that differs from heteronormative will produce different gender roles by way of producing different interactions with other gender roles.   In gay society, we see the emergence of leather culture, of bears & monkeys, of fairies and other such. In lesbian society, we see butch, dyke, and femme, (stolen, as it happens, from transgender society, usually without credit and usually with some amount of anger than trans people dare use those terms), as well as other stereotyped roles I'm certain exist but that I don't know about.   But what if I told you that bears, monkeys and fairies are all just typical masculine roles already? A bear isn't too different from a biker, I'm sure I don't have to elaborate on that, and fairies are just another form of the aristocratic alpha male.  They are both extremely similar to existing roles, and also different at the core. They differ only mainly by how they interact with other male stereotypes.   Asexuality & aromance are perhaps more different from heteronormativity than gay culture. Certainly more different than current paradigm, which is rather accepting of gay people.  So with collective identity, we too should end up forming stereotypes that are at odds with heteronormative masculine & feminine stereotypes, and perhaps they'll differ a fair bit more than gay stereotypes do.  ( . . . what we possibly have right now is 'cake')  In the meantime, people who care about gay marriage are ignoring the rather larger, more widespread, and more damaging problem of gay homeless youth. And in this case, are erasing asexual 'corrective' rape, which happens with more frequency than gay/lesbian 'corrective' rape, so that tells you either what they think of us, or how far they've bothered to look into things before rejecting us.   ninja edit: Note that here I somewhat conflate 'gender roles' and 'stereotypes', for the purposes of ease of communication. They really aren't the same. Even if you take a def. of gender roles that is close to stereotypes, and although stereotypes are informed by the gender roles, dominant social power shapes how stereotypes actually work, which usually means 'against marginalized people'"
asexuality,3645ga,0xFFE3,-1,Sat May 16 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"I'm really confused about what you're saying here. I don't think dyke was appropriated from the trans community since it was in use since at least the 1920's (unless wikipedia is full of lies), before there was a strong trans movement. Leather culture, bears, butches, femmes, etc. have existed since the beginning of queer awareness before there were bars to cater to them. They haven't emerged recently. They emerged at least fifty years ago, if not more!  It's also brutally insensitive to all queers to say we all engage in heteronormative roles. It's as insulting as asking a lesbian couple, ""Who is the man?"" Your ninja edit doesn't lessen this implication. You're saying, in essence, that queer couples adopt heteronormative roles to make people feel better and more comfortable. Yeah, not cool"
asexuality,3645ga,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Sun May 17 02:56:27 2015 UTC,". . .  Let's start with    before there was a strong trans movement   Errrrr . . . . if we're talking in the US, then surely you mean before the suffrage movement, started by trans women? So we have to go back to the 1870's at least.**  Oh, no, wait, before that, we have to go back to the first peoples rights movement, headed by non-binary folks, so at least 1800-ish.   Nonono, wait, while we're talking about natives, we should mention the 'last great war chief' . . . who was two-spirits, btw. (I don't agree with calling them the 'last great' war chief, exactly, but that's tangential), so that puts us back to about 1740.   If we're not talking in the US, then surely we mean the group of trans women who eventually took over the bureaucracy of the Holy Roman Empire, right?*   to say we all engage in heteronormative roles   . . . I said quite the opposite.    Leather culture, bears, butches, femmes, etc. have existed since the beginning of queer awareness before there were bars to cater to them   In short, no.    They emerged at least fifty years ago, if not more!   Because what I'm getting from you here is that you think bars that cater to queer folks are less than 50 years old?  HAH.   The bars that used to cater to us were destroyed, legally and illegally, thus leading us into mafia-run bars, and thus, about 30 years after that, (this relative timing is regional, if I really want to be clear), to Stonewall.   . . . the oldest gay bar in America predates America. Look it up, learn you some history.   *Actually, I don't really like calling people that far back by today's identity terms. Femininity and masculinity were very different beasts back then, and there are several contemporary non-binary genders in the area covered by the HRE. The idea of gender itself has shifted so far since then that the notion of transgender as we have it is simply inapplicable except in the broadest strokes, and kinda offensive to apply to other folks who don't self-apply it in the first place. The contemporary notion of gender starts in the 1700's with colonial gender if you want to start to go down that rabbit hole.   ** You're probably a little curious about this if you're only ever heard about Susan Be.Genocidal Anthony. Long story short, her movement was definitely not the first, or even the most influential. It just managed to grab all the credit after the fact, in large part because the racist parts of her movement were more agreeable to the folks at the time. Hell, the movement that existed up in Canada was too native & equal for her, so she started a council up here which advocated against suffrage until after it was already passed. And then some years later, that organization goes on to field the famous five, three of whom went on to great political careers advocating eugenics)"
asexuality,3645ga,0xFFE3,-4,Sun May 17 03:18:12 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware I was supposed to examine the sexual policies of every country, empire, ethnicity, and so on in written history. I thought of the last 100 years in the US, which was the locus of my thought process. Silly me! -_- Let's start busting out the third sex blessings given in India or the works and life of Sappho! Neither of which are relevant right now to the existence of language being used in English over the last seventy years or so!   In gay society, we see the emergence of leather culture, of bears & monkeys, of fairies and other such. In lesbian society, we see butch, dyke, and femme, (stolen, as it happens, from transgender society, usually without credit and usually with some amount of anger than trans people dare use those terms), as well as other stereotyped roles I'm certain exist but that I don't know about.  So with collective identity, we too should end up forming stereotypes that are at odds with heteronormative masculine & feminine stereotypes, and perhaps they'll differ a fair bit more than gay stereotypes do.   Translation: queers currently have man and woman, i.e., heteronormative roles in relationships. We should fix that by making non-man, non-woman variations of sexuality. Ignoring, of course, the importance of identity in sexuality. Let's explore that.  You say it's wrong for a lesbian to identify herself in a way that is traditionally feminine (femme) because reasons. You would absolutely not demand a trans woman present herself in any other way but her preferred presentation of womanhood. She's fought and thought long and hard for that ability and no one gets to rescind it.   A bear isn't too different from a biker, I'm sure I don't have to elaborate on that, and fairies are just another form of the aristocratic alpha male.   How nice it is for you to invalidate the sexual identities of people who aren't you just because you think they run together as stereotypical man. Do you wave a hand at bisexual and pansexuals  or at gray-a's and demi-a's, saying that the terms are just splitting hairs? If you do, I'm very entertained about your insistence you belong in a queer space, since you are actively invalidating parts of it.  ""If not more,"" meaning that there have been gay bars for at least 50 years. Maybe they have existed longer. Or societies or gathering halls or what have you have existed longer. I'm just saying off the top of my head (50 years ago being the late 60's and a place of queer visibility) instead of spending 50 minutes on Wikipedia crafting a result that you won't read.   So let's talk about how you demand certain people stop doing things they like and identify with because you said so."

Your claim is that asexual people are in no way oppressed, but this is not the case. Sex is shoved down people's throats from a very young age and we are taught that if you do not desire it, there is something wrong with you. Most asexual people seem to go through a period of several years of believing or being told by other people that they are broken. A lot of asexual people end up in sexually abusive relationships, or sexually assaulted or raped in the name of ""being converted"" - it happens to gay and transgender people too, it happens a lot.   And both the people who have experienced this shit and the ones who haven't are questioned constantly by heteronormative people and LGBT people alike and told repeatedly that they are invalid, that they do not exist, that there is something inherently wrong with them. Have you ever met an asexual person who hasn't had people insisting that their sexuality is a result of a mental illness or hormone imbalance, or that they haven't met the one yet, or ""just need a good dicking"" to see the light? Do you know any asexuals who haven't been pushed down by allosexual people who invalidate their identity and experience? Who haven't been told that they don't know they're not sexually attracted to people until they have sex, or if they've already tried then it just wasn't with the right person, they just need to have more sex.  If you heard people telling a gay person that they don't know they like the opposite sex until they try sex with them, or that there must be something wrong with their hormones or their mental health - you would be disgusted. You would have no doubt that these people were being oppressed and invalidated. So why do you think it's any different for asexual people?  An asexual's experience, whether they are heteroromantic or not, is never going to be the same as a heterosexual person's experience. They are not the same thing, and conflating the two is downright ignorant.  If you think asexual people are never oppressed, you are kidding yourself."

A lot of asexual people end up in sexually abusive relationships, or sexually assaulted or raped in the name of ""being converted""   Link to some statistics on the percentages of asexuals who are raped, then? Versus trans people and gay people and straight people, etc?   Have you ever met an asexual person who hasn't had people insisting that their sexuality is a result of a mental illness or hormone imbalance, or that they haven't met the one yet, or ""just need a good dicking"" to see the light?    I'm not denying that some asexuals do face jerks who will tell them they're invalid. Happens to everyone. For every reason. For sexuality, for gender, for g-damn politics, even.    Do you know any asexuals who haven't been pushed down by allosexual people who invalidate their identity and experience?    I'm asexual, I've never had an allosexual tell me that I was ""invalid"", but then again, I'm queer as well. A friend of mine is asexual as well, and he's straight, but in a loving relationship with an allosexual woman, and she never pressures him or has any issue with the fact that he is only attracted to her romantically and not sexually. Not every person in the world is going to invalidate every asexual. That's ridiculous.   Who haven't been told that they don't know they're not sexually attracted to people until they have sex, or if they've already tried then it just wasn't with the right person, they just need to have more sex.

I didn't say it wasn't disgusting that people are jerks and tell people they can't experience certain sexual attractions or none at all.

I'm asexual, I've never had an allosexual tell me that I was ""invalid"", but then again, I'm queer as well.   If you're being honest, and you have never in any way been invalidated in relation to your asexuality, then this is genuinely a first for me.   I simply said, asexuals are not oppressed for their lack of sexual attraction.   But they are."
asexuality,3645ga,ExtraWingyScapula,-1,Mon May 18 14:35:41 2015 UTC,"We consider attraction a normal state of human existence. By that definition alone, asexuals are outside normal and technically queer, as they struggle against societal norms.  The problem is, save the label, the average asexual's struggles are identical to that of any single person (if choosing to be alone) or coupled person (if choosing a heterosexual partner). Relative difficulty of finding someone who wants to be in an LTR with an asexual person isn't sufficient, else heterosexuals with severe anxiety would be queer as well. Then again, a heterosexually-paired bisexual has a similar problem. So perhaps it's a framing problem for me."

asexuality,363lk9,bitchdick_,10,Fri May 15 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"Have you had sex before? I find that my mentality is completely different between masturbation and sex. And because of that even if the stimulation is fun when I'm alone, it might be different with a partner. Adding a partner to the fold also means you have to consider their needs; you can't just use them as a human dildo. There will be times when they want to have sex when you don't, and vice-versa. They won't want to have anal sex every time you have sex. Otherwise, you could look for casual sex if you just wanted to explore those sensations and nothing else.  As for putting you out of the ace category, what makes you asexual is your lack of sexual attraction, not lack of a sex drive. Enjoying sex of any kind and even pursuing it does not preclude you from being asexual. Passing someone on the street and thinking that you need to have sex with them -- that would mean you're allosexual. And there's nothing embarrassing if you find that you need to choose a new label at any time because it suits you better. That's just how life works :)"

Some conversation is all I want, maybe go chat with Joker or something?  One of these days I will do a 'romance no-one' playthrough, maybe there's a payoff in ME3 for consistency, who knows. But there are still romances I haven't tried yet, so that day is a long way off.

I think the only exception is that if you didn't romance anyone in ME3 then during the Citadel DLC it will be Joker who talks to you at the end when everyone returns to the Normandy.

I like how romance is handled in games like Star Ocean 2, Avalon Code, Harvest Moon, Fire Emblem, and Persona 3 and 4 (and 5 maybe pleasepleaseplease) where you as the main character have CHOICES if you decide to pursue any and they're all (at least, to some extent) unique.

In games like the Sims, on the other hand, I tend to make up long and (ridiculously) intricate back-story for my characters, and romance just becomes an extra layer of detail.

D&D, Pathfinder, etc... those games don't have a lot of emphasis on sex (at least not in my group), though a few of my characters have had relationships (or flings) in-game.  I did play text-based RP in a dystopian setting; sex was a big part of the fantasy for a lot of people.  I indicated in my profile that while sex wasn't out, I wasn't interested in RPing it in detail, and so any time it came up, it would go ""fade to black.""  We'd agree on some basics (who was involved, to what extent was it consensual vs extortion vs forced [important given the setting; characters may not necessarily give consent, but all involved players must consent before it officially can happen], how much /whether it was enjoyed by each party) and call it done."

It's so much easier and less scary than trying to form a romantic relationship in real life would be. If I do the wrong thing and piss off a romantic partner in a game then that's just a fun way of exploring new game content, whereas if I did the same thing in real life it would absolutely suck.  Basically, romance is fun to mess around with so long as there are no real-life consequences, similar to when games give you the option to become a thief or an assassin.

Whore around (no thank you) or get married with children, they're all annoying. A game like Dragon Age Inquisition, where a lot of the fanbase is crazed over 'romancing' someone, it is a bit rewarding to do so because you're more than likely attached to the characters.

RADICAL CHOICES  NO SEX   For some people abstinence is a civil mission. Without exaggerating, we'll let the numbers tell us how common this phenomenon is: more and more people (especially women) in the world give up this pleasure. But they don't give up other pleasures (such as love).    Okay I know this translation sounds extremely rough but I'm very sleepy right now x.x However I can assure I was faithful to the original. It sounds really bad, doesn't it? As you go on it gets worse, though. They make some examples of women who decided to abstain from having sex because they didn't find the right men, or because after casual intercourses they couldn't avoid feeling somewhat romantically involved with the other person. The difference between love and sex is not clear in this article. They often use the words ""abstain"" and ""renounce"", like it was a sacrifice. They are mixing up asexuality and celibacy."

Because asexuality, like all sexual orientations, is a spectrum. I find it problematic to frame it within the idea of a physical lack or absence.  Asexuality is not synonymous with nonsexuality and it does not necessarily mean that asexuals never experience sexual attraction.  I think framing Asexuality as a spectrum of little to no sexual drive is a very different from saying Asexuality is the absence of sexual desire.  I also refuse the idea that this is a condition of any kind in the same way that i reject the psychiatric terminology used for transgender folks. As a trans person, I resent transness being defined by a condition known as body dysphoria. And as an ace, i reject the same tendency to define my sexual orientation by a lack.  This is because I reject the idea that there is a standard for gender and orientation that I am deviating from.  Language is all we have so when bringing visibility to these important issues, i think that it is vital we constructively challenge how we craft these representations."

For asexual submissives, for example, the act of submission and handing over of control can be intensely relaxing.   Don't make the mistake of conflating all BDSM practices with violence, either.

asexuality,362wd8,kaikadragon,1 point,Fri May 15 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"In short: Yes.   I mean, why wouldn't it be possible?"
asexuality,362wd8,kaikadragon,1 point,Fri May 15 22:40:35 2015 UTC,"My kinks are often sexual, but I don't have sexual attraction to people because of them.  And then there's also things I have a NONsexual kinky obsession with.  So yes, it's totally possible.  Being asexual doesn't mean there is nothing that turns you on, it just means you are not sexually attracted to people."
asexuality,35qsr2,throwawaylickalert,2,Tue May 12 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"I've always told people that my primary orientation was kinky - even before I knew/heard of asexuality. I find the ace label worthwhile because it lets potential partners know upfront that I'm probably not interested in sex but I will happily 'torture' them for hours.   You can be romantically attracted without sexual attraction. You can have kinky urges towards someone without sexual attraction. Hell, you can find them attractive without it being sexual.  If the ace label (in any of it's forms, demi, gray, etc) feels right for you, then it's right."
asexuality,35qsr2,Nymphetamean,1 point,Wed May 13 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"Like other commenters have said, it's up to you to choose what label to apply to yourself. If you don't feel like just straightforward asexual fits the bill, there's also grey-asexual. Sexuality is weird and doesn't always fit neatly into little boxes, and this is especially obvious in the asexual community."
asexuality,35qsr2,Ruruskadoo,1 point,Thu May 14 10:55:55 2015 UTC,"Are you sexually attracted to anyone?  If yes, then you probably either have a very strong fetish or you have sexual hangups or some kind of tactile issue.  At any rate, you'd want to talk to doctors/psych people/sex therapists to get to the bottom of things rather than talk to us.  If you're not sexually attracted to anyone, then you're asexual, though it could potentially be possible that you just don't have the right emotional connection with your girlfriend or haven't had it for long enough to be into your girlfriend if you were demisexual.     So, basically, do you experience sexual attraction to others, either generally or to specific individuals, or do you just fantasize about your fetishes, possibly generally as a result of your physical libido prompting some kind of sexual release?"
asexuality,35qsr2,BreakTheLoop,1 point,Thu May 14 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"I don't really know, only you can tell if you feel comfortable with the label. From what you tell, probably yeah, asexual or a variant, but I'm not in your head and ultimately it's not that important.   This has been a great source of discomfort all through my life   That's what's important. Knowing what you're comfortable with in terms of relationships and contacts and kinks and everything. What you describe is not for everyone, but does it work for you? Are you uncomfortable with your practices (forcing yourself?) or by the fact they're not the norm? As long as you and your girlfriend are both happy in your relationship, it seems good to me."
asexuality,35qsr2,ver_sacrum,1 point,Wed May 13 18:05:10 2015 UTC,"The first question you should ask yourself to understand if you're asexual is whether you ever feel sexually attracted to women (or to people in general). If you don't, you're asexual. If you do, you aren't what asexual means by definition."
asexuality,35o3xz,polo8m,9,Tue May 12 02:18:05 2015 UTC,I'd say that probably falls under the gray-asexuality category.

asexuality,35o3xz,Fire-Flowers,5,Tue May 12 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"Part of that depends on if you're sexually attracted to people who have perfected their HUGE or if you're only into it for purposes of pornography and fantasy, IIRC."
asexuality,35o3xz,redneckgymrat,1 point,Tue May 12 03:54:51 2015 UTC,Well for the most part its fantasy but it might be a case of masochistic jealousy if get what i mean
asexuality,35o3xz,Ruruskadoo,6,Tue May 12 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"If it's just a fantasy that you enjoy, you're still asexual. Fantasy doesn't equal attraction.  If you're sexually attracted to specific people with muscular body types then I'd say probably gray-a. But what's important is what you're comfortable and want to identify as, really."

I seem to recall it usually striking between the ages of 11 and 13.  So when I see someone your age (anyone under 16, really) saying ""oh, I'm asexual/demisexual+biromantic/et cetera"", I always find myself thinking ""What, really?  Have you gone through puberty yet?  Are you sure it's not that you just don't know yet?""  And maybe you get older and conclude it hasn't changed and you were ace years ago.  And maybe you decide that I'm full of hooey and you are, now.  Your experience, your labeling, your call.  Whatever.  But it is a thing that bugs me.  You read all that?  Okay.  You can downvote"

asexuality,35i6lb,charredgrass,6,Sun May 10 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome to the sub!  I personally have no problem with you identifying as asexual. For whatever reason, that is what you are experiencing right now.  If you are uncomfortable being asexual, you can talk to your doctor about the side effects of the medication you are using. It is possible that there is a different medication that can be used that will have the same positive effects and not impact your sex drive. But I would rather you identify as asexual than have to worry about suicide.  As for romantic feelings...there are many asexual people who have them.  TLDR; If it really bothers you, talk to you doctor and see if there is another option, but otherwise keep taking your meds. I, personally, have no problem with you identifying as asexual."
asexuality,35i6lb,osteopath17,12,Sun May 10 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"Identification is personal choice.  You can identify as anything you want.  The fact that your sex drive was squashed by medication is not that uncommon.  You ARE, functionally, asexual.  Whether you wish to use the label is entirely up to you.  The fact that you are differentiating sexual and romantic feelings indicates to me that you also have the mindset, the thought processes, that are common to asexuals.  How long have you been on that medication?  Speaking from my own perspective, the ace community is anything but homogeneous, but it is definitely accepting.  And welcoming.  So far as I'm concerned, you're definitely welcome."
asexuality,35i6lb,redneckgymrat,2,Sun May 10 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Perfectly said.  What makes someone Asexual is as budget as the definition of sexuality.  Because of your medication part of your sexuality is no longer actively present and that meets the linguistic needs of calling yourself asexual.    You also seem to have a lot of respect for this community,  so no matter what you are welcome to be a part of the Ace identity.  Whether you want to just say ""I'm asexual""  or experiment with other labels like ""functionally asexual""  or ""medication induced asexuality""  or something you can play around.  You could even say ""grey asexual ""  because you have experienced a complete sexuality (once upon a time...) but you more strongly identify with asexuality.  Totally up to you.   I think for a lot of asexuals it can be hard to acknowledge that people who are taking certain medications or experiencing certain life events may lose their sexual desires and motivation and find comfort and understanding in the asexual community or ""asexual""  as a label.  I know it's hard for me to get my head around because I still have a sex drive and my Asexuality is not related to desire (Its related to attraction) but that's not the only type of asexuality and it's important we can all get along and share our experiences no matter what missing element of sexuality makes us asexual. I love having new people join this community with unique reasons for feeling asexual because it helps me understand other sexual identities.   I think one thing I would be considerate of is making sure that if you are talking to people who haven't heard of asexuality before that you mention that some people are born asexual and it's like being gay,  its Not orientation,  where as some people are going through something so they become asexual and it's different but it feels the same.  Because I think a lot of is get told that asexuality should be fixed,  asexuals aren't broken,  but even if we were, it's not always something that can be fixed,  or something you want ""fixed"".  Or like yourself,  asexuality is the better option because you like the way your medication handles you condition."
asexuality,35i6lb,mundabit,3,Tue May 12 08:37:40 2015 UTC,"What would bother me about what you wrote is more that you feel like you don't belong anywhere else.   Accepting yourself is the first thing you should focus on and being comfortable with you in your own skin is something you should discuss with your doctor, especially if its related to suicide."
asexuality,35i6lb,oskietje,2,Mon May 11 09:14:14 2015 UTC,"If you don't experience sexual attraction, you're asexual. That's the only thing that matters. The reason why or the fact that you used to feel differently doesn't really matter if that's who you are now."
asexuality,35i6lb,Fire-Flowers,2,Mon May 11 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"""Is it okay for me to identify as asexual?""  No one is out to tell you who you are, and I think that most would agree that the ace community isn't about to kick anyone out. I like to think that most of us are down to earth enough to accept anyone who feels like they belong here. If you feel like you are doing the right thing, the rest of us have got your back."
asexuality,35i6lb,TangerineGlobs,1 point,Tue May 12 04:18:54 2015 UTC,"It's definitely okay to identify as asexual! The label you put on your sexual orientation is for YOU, not anyone else.

asexuality,35i6lb,Ruruskadoo,2,Mon May 11 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"Nope. Wellbutrin is great for people who used to have a sex drive/sexual attraction and whose antidepressants quashed it. If you're naturally ace, why would it do anything?"
asexuality,35hn0f,dReam24601,7,Sun May 10 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between feeling horny (sexual desire) and looking at someone that makes you horny/want to have sex with them,  without even knowing them (sexual attraction).   Taking meds that lower libido is going to make it tougher to figure out. But the simple definition for asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction. You could have the highest libido, masturbate multiple times, but if looking at certain people doesn't do it for you then you'd still be asexual.   You could talk to your doctor about trying out different meds to see if you can get your libido back if that's what you want.   If you don't and you just feel comfortable describing yourself as asexual for whatever reason, then go for it :)"
asexuality,35hn0f,Kali711,2,Sun May 10 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Being asexual doesn't mean you necessarily have a low libido. Some asexuals have high libidos, and others' are low or nonexistant. What matters is whether that libido was directed at anyone--whether you experinced sexual attraction to another person. If you didn't, then there's a good chance you're asexual."
asexuality,35hn0f,falling2geeses,2,Sun May 10 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"Sexual attraction is the crucial component.  If you feel sexual attraction to others but are distressed by not being able to act upon it due to your medication then you should talk to your doctor and investigate alternate treatments.  If you don't feel sexual attraction then you're almost certainly somewhere on the asexuality spectrum, but seeing as you had such a night and day experience when you went off your meds, it still may be in your interest to investigate alternate treatment options."
asexuality,35bl97,rosecoloredswan,16,Fri May 8 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"I (again, personally) don't mind you defining yourself as ace for that period of time, but it makes me super happy that you've thought so much about it! It definitely makes me feel more respected. :)  As for hanging out, you have your own experiences and viewpoint to bring to any discussion. Just because you've realized that you aren't ace, doesn't mean that the time period you identified as sexual attraction free is invalid. (does that make any sense? I think I've worded it weirdly again...)"
asexuality,35bl97,dragonzflyte,6,Fri May 8 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post. It's good to feel welcome.  I absolutely love the asexual community. It's not just that I can identify with it, from the period of my life when I had no sexual attractions, but I feel like I can identify with a lot of things, now, as a lesbian.   I feel like 95% of the frustration and discrimination I face is not because I'm attracted to women, but, rather, because I'm not attracted to men. And hearing other people express these frustrations, about being not attracted to people that other people want them to be attracted to, has been really, really helpful."
asexuality,35bl97,redneckgymrat,2,Sat May 9 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good way to explain it.  The problem stems, not from being attracted to women, but from not being attracted to men.  You're certainly welcome   And your thoughtfulness is definitely appreciated."
asexuality,35bl97,redneckgymrat,1 point,Sun May 10 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I encounter, very often, the same taboo of talking about non-attraction in the LGBT community, that I encounter in the wider world.

However, some people may not like it and get annoyed, but that's going to happen with most things anyone does, you always step on toes. But I think it's great if you find solace and a friendly atmosphere here, no matter if you're A or allo.

When I'm in this situation I know that if my friend were with someone else that I would be jealous, but not because I want to date them myself but because I know if they date somebody we won't be able to spend as much time together.  This is a really confusing feeling... sometimes I think I like like them but I'm never sure.  Anyway like x100 hugs to you right now  :)  About masturbating, I mean if you don't want to do it you don't have to do it.  If you have the urge to do it then yeah maybe you could try some different things but if you don't then don't even worry about it.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with not enjoying it or not needing to do it."
asexuality,35an2g,ver_sacrum,1 point,Sat May 9 22:58:30 2015 UTC,"I know going to a therapist is not easy, but I feel it would really help you. However, if for some reason you can't, I'd suggest looking online for friends who live near your area. You seem to have anxiety problems in face-to-face relationships, so you could perhaps open up more if the start of your relationships was via chat. Then, after you've created a bond with the person you've met in chat, you could meet them in real life. Perhaps this won't be easy, but I think it will probably be easier. If you decide to try this, though, pay attention to whom you get to know. Internet can be a very nice place, but there also are malicious people. So don't give too much personal info (e.g your address) and when you first meet the person choose a public place where there are other people.   In regards to masturbating, I'd suggest reading info on the Internet to understand whether you're doing it wrong or if you can do something to make it better. You could also try various means to get more excited, like reading erotica etc. You might find something that really works for you, and you never know before you try.  However, keep in mind that for some people orgasms and masturbating are not that amazing experience they are for others. We're all different. For some of us orgasms may be the most wonderful feeling in the world, for others they are meh. This isn't fair, but it's true."

My personal experiences with autochorissexualism leads me to believe that sexual arousal is physiological and that asexual men will not have any major clinical diffrences between allosexual men.  I would also like to know the way in which they measure arousal. If it's just penis girth detectors then I am personally not going to be convinced by any hard data they come up with, I'd like to see diaphoretic detectors and EEG used too.  A cognitive input will be useful as well, A questionnaire that asks them to rate their desire to have sex or masturbate out of 10 at several points during the study. I would expect to see a large difference between asexual men and the control group in that study."

It's great that you are in a better spot now and understand why you lashed out in the first place. It gets better!  I also acted out before I knew about asexuality. It was a tough and shameful time. I acted out by either having sex a few times (because everyone else did and it was normal), rejecting everyone who was interested because it implied regular sex at some point (not that I admitted to myself that that was the reason), and playing on a few guys crush on me for validation when I was depressed and felt broken.  This is also why ace-awereness is important! If we don't know about it it can be so much harder processing our feelings og thoughts.

And if there was wishful thinking involved, as there often is, this person would be taking advantage of it rather than correcting them.   I feel like you're insisting that it's the non-ace partner's fault for staying in the relationship after they've been lied to about the possibility of sex when they had no way of knowing any better."

There is certainly some proportion of mixed allosexual-asexual relationships with some component of that, either conscious or unconscious.    Even waiting for the allosexual party to fall in love before revealing one's asexuality would constitute some version of this, I believe, because after they've fallen in love, then there's that added layer of guilt to breaking up over sexual incompatibility layered in to keep them from being as likely to leave."

Besides, trying to balance behavior at exactly the ""right"" level isn't a simple change, to be more polite, or better at socializing.    Well, determining what the exact balance would be isn't the way to go about it in the first place, but if one has this problem then examining one's own role in recreating it is the variable that one has the most control over, even above and beyond learning to recognize what kind of people tend to interpret signs of friendliness as signs of romantic or sexual interest and avoiding them or avoiding anything beyond the bare minimum necessary.   At that point, you're putting on a front whenever you're around your friends, just so that they don't get the wrong idea, which is awful.

I used to have a problem where people thought I was flirting with them because of how I had been raised to show friendly interest.    Instead of just throwing my hands up in the air and decrying everyone else I took a step back, examined how I was behaving to see if I was a contributing factor, and adjusted my behavior accordingly and now people think I'm flirting with them a lot less often.   Actually, what are we arguing about discussing again? I've gotten lost.   The way I see it, I was stating that there is almost certainly something she can do about having people always think she's interested, at least to some extent, since dudebros will always be around until we find a way to get rid of people raising children to be dudebros, and you were apparently arguing that any evaluation and modification of one's behavior is a complete and drastic personality change."

I knew sex wasn't really something I was ever going to enjoy like most people, but the amount of times I tried to fool myself into thinking I could change... I probably broke a few hearts because of it.   That said, you should continue doing therapy and stuff. Manipulative behaviors aren't something you ""grow out of"", they become part of who you are.

The fact that I lack sexual desires , enables me to 'tease' others without the need to 'satisfy' myself.   He also says that he's entitled and enabled to freely tease and take advantage of allosexuals because he's asexual and that no one can object to this because that's how all allosexuals are and it'd be singling him out for being asexual and calling him a bad person because he's asexual rather than for being manipulative."

I am a senior in high school and I like to take care of my body, so I'm considered a pretty attractive guy. I sometimes catch underclassmen stealing glances, and I have learned to tell when someone likes me.   Obviously the feelings aren't mutual, and I usually try to ignore anything relating to crushes/dating. The thing is, sometimes I feel bad for the other person because I am ace and they have no idea. I guess I feel like I'm leading them on by doing nothing. I'm sure a good bit of it is anxiety too, as I am pretty uncomfortable in public for reasons I hardly even know.  Anyway, I don't really know if this is relevant, I just thought it belongs here over anywhere else.

Over the years I've had a few such incidents where I realized I was bullying, misleading, or judging, but in each case I learned and matured from it. I don't think it's an ace thing, specifically, though I do think breakage of norms comes more naturally when you don't fit them(even if you're unaware of it) - and that has some lateral effect on how you treat others, for better or for worse.

Also I have no idea about what sinful is. I'm an atheist and never quite understood the idea of sin. I don't in general judge anyone, I just have certain response to certain people which is all revolving around sexual attraction. If a person does not try to approach me in a sexual manner, I'm cool with them, whatever. But as soon as either someone tries to get closer, or mentions the topic in conversation I tend to get hostile towards them. Also I don't particularly feel better because of it. I rather feel alienated and it's not a good way of living life. Particularity in a small town in western Poland, where people are in general not friendly to anyone even slightly different. I really hate this inability frankly. It ruined my life to some extent, as I was unable to get into normal relationship with a woman. After all I really like women in general. I have no problem with men either, but in this culture, they are all unapproachable for me at some point. It works both ways too. I mean I've been labelled all sorts of shit, depending what the ""mean word"" for the group is, usually I'm told I'm gay. It's typical of Polish society to call anyone different gay or lesbian. I don't really find the homoerotic people likeable myself. They often behave quite the same as straight people, just the sex is different. They are all somehow ""expecting"" certain behaviour at certain moment, and as soon as you don't fall into their category you are suspected of being dishonest. I mean I know how to do it - be like others expect (especially women)- but I just can't help to not do it. I think I confused things at this point too much anyway. I don't get it myself. Maybe it's specific for Polish/post catholic society?"

asexuality,354esl,melpomene42,11,Thu May 7 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this:  You are the same person you have always been.   Any thoughts you had on sex, love, marriage, before realizing your sexuality-- all those thoughts are still valid. You just have a bit more information to refine those thoughts.  And, cold as it sounds, you can't miss what you never had. You can wish you were another way, sure, but that's not the crux-- that is that you can't miss what you've never had.  You have nothing to regret. You're beating yourself over an idea. Something you can't even define. You will also never comprehend exactly how magnificent the universe is. That's okay. Neither will I."
asexuality,354esl,21stPilot,5,Thu May 7 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"I can kind of understand what you are talking about.  I was raised in a pretty socially conservative environment (it became much more liberal as I got older); part of my upbringing was the idea that people get married, have kids and families, and that brings meaning to your life.  Even when I was young (once I hit puberty) I knew I was asexual (I didn't know the term, but I knew I wasn't sexually attracted to anyone). And it bothered me, the fact that part of me believed that sexual relationships (like marriage) were necessary in life, and the fact that I was not sexually attracted to anyone.  It took a long time to come to terms with the fact that sexual relations alone do not make life meaningful. That my friendships, my relationship with my siblings, fulfilled all of my emotional needs.  As u/21stPilot said, you have not changed at all. You are still the same person.  What has changed is how you understand yourself with respect to other people.  I would add that you should not despair. Many asexual people have relationships, either with other asexual people or with sexual people. Your asexuality does not prevent you from having relationships. Will they require work? Most likely. But all relationships do.  I really wish you the best as you try to come to terms with this."

asexuality,354esl,osteopath17,5,Thu May 7 13:25:58 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this, too. I go through phases where in some ways, I'm happy that I don't have to deal with all the romantic relationship crap that everyone I know goes through.  But the real problem for me, I think is because I suppose I still want to somehow have that strong relationship bond with a life partner, but I know it just won't happen because I have never been, and likely will never be romantically attracted to anyone. So, I see it often, as, depressingly, a life sentence of being a loner. I also have the similar feeling of feeling that I myself, am a big weirdo, but that other asexuals are not.  I guess what I'm trying to say, like others have, is that this is something many of us will feel or go through. You should definitely talk to someone about how you feel, professional or friend. It gets better. You are still you, and hopefully in time you will make peace with that."

You are who you are. If you don't crave sex, you don't crave it. There's nothing to be done about it. And if you can't change that fact, you might as well try to embrace it. My advice would be to find like-minded people, or at least others who know about asexuality and accept it. Try to surround yourself with people who have gone through similar experiences that you have. Coming to this subreddit is a good first step.   There are a lot of people who are, or have gone through, the exact same problem that you're having right now. It's hard to like yourself, or see yourself as ""normal"" when society is telling you that everyone needs/wants sex. When I first started questioning my sexuality, just scrolling through this subreddit and reading about other peoples' problems and resolutions helped me immensely.

Pretty much what she said was that it's an accepted orientation, however, like most psychological phenomena, if it causes the individual experiencing the 'thing' (where 'thing' is whatever you want it to be) to be distressed due to it, then they should seek help.  If you feel broken, see a counsellor or psychologist. What would be involved I can't say, but they are there to help, and to be accepting."

Everybody gets to choose their own label, and even if I thought yours didn't fit the bill for aromantic, if you felt like you were aromantic, then that's what you are.  In any case, I'm aromantic too, and this is mostly how I feel. I want relatisonships that are QP and that I can count on for companionship, but they're by no means romantic.   I've had multiple guys ask me out, and it just twisted my stomach and made me feel wrong at the thought of being in a relationship with them. I would have been just fine with being with most of them if they wanted to be QPP, but I know they didn't even know what that is. A romantic relationship felt wrong.  So, in closing, I'm pretty similar to you with what I want in a relationship (except for the sex part but you know, every QPP is different) and I identify as aromantic, so make of that what you will. Only you can choose what to (and what not to) label yourself :)"

I'm ace and I can't even really put into words how my feelings are different.   I care deeply for my friends, family, and pets, and I guess my attachment to some of them feels stronger than to others, but it all sort of feels the same I guess? Like there's no different kind of affection; the feeling I have for my friends or my dog is the same one that I have for my mom. That's not to say that if I was forced to choose that I'd pick my gecko's life over my mom's, but as far as the kind of feeling of affection, it's not really different aside from intensity.   I crave close relationships for the social contact, but I don't feel the need for exclusivity, and if they find a romantic partner I'm genuinely happy for them because that makes them happy. I've never had a crush on anyone, and the only reason I ever felt upset about never having been in a relationship was because I felt like that was the ""normal"" thing to do, and not having done so was something I should be ashamed of. I can't think of anything I would want from a romantic partner that I couldn't get from close friends and family. I'm not sure if the way I feel is the same as how other aromantics feel though. They may experience it differently.  I've heard from non-aro people that romantic feelings are something that you know when you're feeling them, and considering what a strong effect they seem to have on people, I'd assume it's not exactly subtle. I'd assume that if you felt romantic feelings for people, you'd eventually be able to tell.  Sorry about the confused ramblings. I think what's important is if you consider yourself aromantic, you should be able to call yourself that. If you change your mind in the future and decide that that isn't the correct label for you, then you can always use a different one then."

asexuality,355kcv,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Thu May 7 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"What you describe sounds to me like the opposite end of the spectrum from ""hopeless sappy romantic"".  Whether ""aromantic"" is a good label for that, I'm not sure I can help with.  One difficulty is that a different opposite I can imagine for the ""hopeless sappy romantic"" is the ""boring practical romantic"".  The boring practical romantic being the kind who fixes your tractor so you don't have to, just because and anyhow it needed to be done anyways.  (Which is yet different from the boring practical ""oh uh I didn't mean that as a romantic gesture, it just needed to be done"".)  it hasn't been prettied up especially, if you know where to look you can see where it's held together with baling wire and maybe it hasn't even been painted, but it works.  See, I told you I didn't know if I'd be helpful.  One thing that's been niggling at the back of my mind is, are all of us really so atypical?  What if the majority of 'aces' have what's actually a normal healthy sexuality, and the world is so incredibly screwed up and oversexed that we don't notice because the only yardstick we have available is the screwed-up oversexed rest of he world? Which I guess is the same thing you're worried about with romantic/aromantic, but with sex.  Have you ever bought her surprise flowers?  That's a typical romantic gesture, and seems to me like it could be a good opener for deeper discussion, if that would be helpful.  Or is that one of those romantic gestures you already know you don't like?  Maybe she sees you as something slightly more ""background""/""constant""?  Which is a really, really shitty job at expressing what I mean.  I don't know.  I'm scraping at the bottom of the barrel and conning up with spitballs at this point.  TL;DR:  Of course you can call yourself aromantic.  Is it the best label?  Well first let's define ""good"" to a 99% tolerance, and then we can set out down the rabbit hole..."
asexuality,355kcv,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Thu May 7 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"Hahaha! I know what you mean, I have considered before that perhaps everyone's just a bit weird - and my experience isn't really all that 'odd', just different from what we see. I'm fairly confident I don't feel the 'something' a lot of romantic people talk about - it seems like if I felt it, I'd /know/, and the fact there's literally no difference for me between 'close friend' and 'partner' supports that IMHO.   Have you ever bought her surprise flowers?   No, and honestly I would be a little embarrassed/cringe-feeling about doing so, for whatever reason. I /did/ buy flowers for my QPP once, because she'd told me before she would like it, and even though it'd feel very ??? to me to receive flowers, I wanted to make my friend happy. If my primary partner explicitly told me they'd like to receive flowers from someone one day, I would likely buy them some at some point.   I've performed romantic gestures for my QPP in the past but it's always been like, I don't know, a pantomime/roleplay. We're both aware I don't feel any inclination towards the things I'm doing, but I act out my part and she enjoys it well enough and appreciates the effort. And the fact she knows it's 'not real' helps me feel okay about pretending for her. For instance, I've taken her out to dinner I think, twice now. It seems like she enjoys both the romantic actions and the romantic feels, so she's okay with acting the actions out for an evening - but my primary partner is only interested in those things as extensions of her romantic feelings.   That was kinda rambling there but in short: I've never thought to buy my primary flowers, other than occasionally wondering if I'm 'supposed' to.   Maybe she sees you as something slightly more ""background""/""constant""?   I think this is fairly accurate. It's a bit like two sisters or best friends who share a home and go on dates (well, I don't, but still). She's interested in finding that 'special someone' but she's also committed to the friendship we share and isn't looking to trade me in for 'The One'; she wants me to be kind of the 'foundation' while she explores romantic relationships that are possibly less sturdy.    TL;DR: Of course you can call yourself aromantic.   Hahaha X3 I think I'm just going to go ahead and use it for now ;3 If something else comes along later that fits better/I change my mind, there's nothing stopping me from choosing a different label. :333"

Demisexuality would be straightforward enough under that model, though, I'd think, since it'd be a person who is without sexuality until they form an emotional bond with someone, and it's a unique sexuality for every person they form said bond with.  Not exactly as accurate as one might like, but not all that confusing either, at least on the surface.  But that's neither here nor there, I suppose.   I mean, it's not super cool, but I can live with it. Why do you ask?   I view the OP's metaphor idea as another way of stating the idea that asexuality is a lack or absence of sexuality.

asexuality,352o3u,prewarpotato,2,Fri May 8 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"oh, okay. I'll change my answer then (sorry for the inconvenience :P).   I don't think explaining something as a lack of a second thing is ever a good idea, because it tends to force the discussion to depend on that second idea. Even if asexuality and sexuality are in some ways reflections of each other- through the ""lack"", or existence of sexual attraction- there seem to be other components to both which would go un-addressed, such as romantic and aesthetic attraction.   Besides, within the English language, the word lack does have negative connotations. I don't see my asexuality as negative, so I'm not going to be 100% okay with using a negative term, which implies that I am lesser in some way then a sexual person. Certainly it is relatively accurate, but there are other words that will work just as well, and don't have the same negativity. Why on earth would I chose to describe my asexuality negatively, when it is not an inherently negative trait?  side-note: I don't think grey-asexual is so confusing- it's just a very broad term, which encompasses a lot of potential levels of asexuality.   I think that it's a very important area to try to illuminate, to  understand what exactly does or does not make up asexuality, and its connections to sexuality.

For now though, if you're not experiencing sexual attraction, if you feel most comfortable defining yourself as asexual, then do so. If things change, they change. Sexuality is fluid; labels are here to help us better describe ourselves, and if they no longer fit, they can be replaced with more accurate ones.   Go with whatever you feel fits you best at this moment. Also, good luck with the depression! I hope you kick its ass!"
asexuality,352edb,Ruruskadoo,1 point,Wed May 6 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"I kinda scared I'll end up being gay or something. I'm not homophobic or owt, I just really don't like the idea of being with a guy, could the depression lift and I suddenly am I into guys? I like the idea of being with a girl romantically, just not actually having sex.   And thanks, if it doesn't let up soon I'll be pissed. Ive been waiting long enough."
asexuality,352edb,Ruruskadoo,6,Wed May 6 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the idea of being with a guy now, chances are slim that you'll suddenly be super into guys. Since you're heteroromantic, if do start feeling sexual attraction it will most likely be heterosexual."
asexuality,352edb,rosecoloredswan,1 point,Wed May 6 16:54:51 2015 UTC,"I actually have had this experience that you are afraid of. I suffered from severe mental illness for years, and had no libido or sexual attraction whatsoever. And, at the end of it, as I started to recover, I discovered that I was experiencing same-sex attraction, and no opposite-sex attraction. I'm slowly starting to come out as a lesbian, but it's not always easy.  If you are frightened and want to talk about this possibility, feel free to talk to me about it, either here or in a message. I won't be offended by anything you say. I'm sure nothing you say will be more offensive than anything I've thought, too. I didn't consider myself homophobic, either, but I had the same thoughts you are having."
asexuality,352edb,Dolphman,3,Fri May 8 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"I've never been sexually attracted to anyone   This is the basics of Asexuality. If you feel like you dont have any sexual attraction, you fit the description.   Do you think once(if) the depression lifts, I'll suddenly be attracted to people?   Your sexual desire may go up, but sexual attraction is different. While anything goes really if (hopefully) your depression lifts, I say with some deep thinking about yourself you can figure out if you lack of attraction is tied to nothing (Asexual) or if its just down due to your sexual desires (just low libido)"

asexuality,3518wt,davros_mueller,5,Wed May 6 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"All humans have a romantic orientation (even if that orientation is aromantic)  so if course you can openly state yours!   My girlfriend is heterosexual and biromantic, she has sexual and romantic relationships with men,  and asexual romantic relationships with women, so it's important that she's able to explain her romantic orientation is different from her sexual orientation.   Likewise,  I'm grey asexual,  but only in a heterosexual way.  I'm biromantoc/queer in my romantic orientation,  and 99.99% asexual.  When I'm not asexual,  I'm heterosexual, but I'm always biromantic"

Tell her to tell you which things are ok and which are off limits, tell her about your desires, etc. It wouldn't be fair to give a ""do X, don't do Y"" kind of advice because asexual people can be different. Some might agree to do certain sexual things to please their partner, others might not, and such. It all depends on what is she willing to do and what are you willing to accept!"
asexuality,350wlq,SpinningNipples,4,Wed May 6 05:32:11 2015 UTC,"What sort of problems arise in an allo-ace relationship depend greatly on the sexual behaviour of both the allo and the ace, and also the sexual libido of the allosexual.  Basicaly, If you have an allosexual with a low sex drive and an asexual who enjoys sex for the physicality, you are going to have fewer problems in that relationship than say a relationship with a hyper-sexual allo and a sex-repulsed ace.  Make sure you understand not only your girlfriends sexual orientation, But her entire sexual identity, what she is and isn't comfortable with, what she does and does not like, what she does and does not want when it comes to sex and sexual intimacy. Compare that to your own and find things you have in common and things you are both willing to compromise on. Some of the things she considers romantic intimacy, you may consider sexual intimacy, and you can both find satisfaction in those moments.  I'm a huge beleiver in The 5 languages of love and these languages stretch across platonic, romantic and sexual love. I think it's great for all couples to figure out what languages they speak and to consider all of their needs in both platonic, romantic and sexual categories, what actions/words help fulfil your romantic and sexual needs, what actions/words fulfil her romantic needs? If you fill up more on romance will you need less for sex? What are your non-negotiables, what are hers?  It depends what troubles you guys are having exactly, the above is pretty general, I was married to a hyper-sexual allosexual for 5 years and I'm currently dating a (hetero)allosexual biromantic woman. So I have a bit of perspective on allo-ace relationships, feel free to mention more specific problems and I'll see if I can help."
asexuality,350wlq,mundabit,2,Wed May 6 08:35:29 2015 UTC,"Good for you for seeking help on how to make her comfortable! That's such a relief to read instead of the more common ""how do I get her more comfortable with sex?"" approach. But as these other people noted, talking to her is best. Then you both know what makes you both un/comfortable and you can discuss any common ground or what solutions might be to certain problems in your relationship. Good luck!"

asexuality,350uyy,dragonzflyte,2,Wed May 6 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know. It sounds to me like you just have a really unusual fetish.

I can't imagine you're the only person on the entire internet who has that particular kink, and with some searching you could probably find others like you."
asexuality,350uyy,Ruruskadoo,2,Thu May 7 14:24:13 2015 UTC,"Generally it's to do with being sexually attracted to the individual person rather than being solely attracted to their genitals absent the rest of them.  Sounds like you're on the asexuality spectrum and have a partialism sexual fetish for men's chubby bellies.  As far as how you masturbate, that's... self-intercrural sex.  Given the pressures that you'd presumably be putting upon your penis, it's fairly likely that you're in death-grip or worse territory, so that could definitely be making your penile insensitivity issue worse."
asexuality,350uyy,rosecoloredswan,1 point,Fri May 8 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, it makes sense that my penis would have lower sensitivity than normal because of what I do.  Also I'd never heard of intercrural sex before, so thanks for that bit of insight too."

Our society tends to value thin people over chubby people, but that's bs and a lot of people are attracted to chubby bellies.  I'm not sure what this says about your sexual orientation. But finding chubbiness to be a turn-on isn't weird. Maybe you like their bellies because it's the part of them that looks chubby."

asexuality,350uyy,exubereft,2,Sat May 9 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"Hey! So it sounds like the identity you're searching for might be closer to paraphiliac than asexual. If you are unable to get aroused without visualizing or seeing a chubby male stomach, that is pretty much the definition of a paraphilia. Specifically, it sounds like you experience partialism, and even more specifically, alvinolagnia.  If you're feeling distressed or dysfunctional, the next step would be to find a sex therapist who can help you in a nonjudgmental environment. I would also suggest finding online communities of people with paraphilias and alvinolagnia.  There is no official litmus test for asexuality, and if you identify with and can find solace in the word or in the community, you are totally welcome! No matter what, you are not broken. Good luck in your search!"

asexuality,34yas8,Jaime_Truth,5,Tue May 5 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Hello and welcome to /r/asexuality!  1) Being asexual, I can't tell you much about sexual attraction. But there is another kind of attraction, aesthetic attraction, which many asexuals do experience. We can find people pleasant to look at, just not in a sexual way. A lot of aces confuse this with sexual attraction at first.  2) I don't know whether you can be sexually attracted to someone without having sexual desire; it depends on your definition of sexual attraction. There is still some controversy about this in the community. But many aces do have a libido without experiencing sexual attraction or desire for sex with another person; it's there, just not directed at anyone.  3) I would say that depends on how you look at those other activities. Some asexuals consider acts like kissing or even more to be romantic, while others consider them to be sexual.  It can be super confusing when you're questioning your sexuality, especially when you may be on the asexual spectrum. Finding a label can be comforting, but don't stress over it too much if nothing fits perfectly. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there's a lot of gray area. When it comes down to it, you are you, and that's what matters. Good luck to you as you explore your identity!"
asexuality,34yas8,falling2geeses,3,Wed May 6 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response! You're right, labels are nice, but all that matters is that I listen to my instincts and do things I want to do and not do things I don't want to do."
asexuality,34wxs1,Erinugget,9,Tue May 5 06:20:43 2015 UTC,"Please don't listen to the other commenter. While you don't need to label yourself if you don't want to, 16 definitely isn't too young to identify as asexual.   Finding an SO who doesn't want sex does reduce your 'dating pool', but it won't be impossible! There are asexual dating sites around if you want to try that route. Dating in person might be trickier (I have no experience here sorry) but there are definitely other people out there who don't want, or can live without, sex.   Everything you're feeling is totally possible, and ok. You are not broken. Hang in there."
asexuality,34wxs1,youdontaskaboutmayo,6,Tue May 5 11:44:26 2015 UTC,"I knew at 13, but at the time, there was no internet, so there was no anonymous sounding board or support out there for someone like me. So I sat quietly, assuming I was a late bloomer, waiting for Mr. Right to come along. I let myself believe I was heterosexual (and that asexuality wasn't a legitimate orientation) up until age 32. I felt so much pressure by that point to 'find a husband and settle down' that I was putting myself in terribly unsafe positions.  Don't let fear lead you into a life you regret. You are not obligated to do things or consider things that make you uncomfortable or unhappy.  These other people you're talking to don't have to live in your head and make peace with your choices. You do. If you meet someone that you want to have sex with, then have sex. If you never meet someone that you want to have sex with, then don't have sex. If you're not dreaming of meeting that someone, then don't go looking."
asexuality,34wxs1,astrobean,4,Tue May 5 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"No, you are not too young to kow that you don't want sex (even if this might change in the future, it doesn't change anything about how you see it right now, and that is valid), I'm sorry your family doesn't believe you. When I was your age, I knew as well, but I wanted to fit in, so latched onto the first dude who showed interest in me and who was not a complete prick. Wouldn't recommend it (we're still friends though), stay true to yourself. I didn't really find out about asexuality until 6 years later.   Will I ever find a SO? Everyone I've talked to about it says they wouldn't be with someone without sex.   Why are you scared of that? Society says we're worthless (that's more towards girls/women) and incomplete without a SO (of the opposite sex), but that's not true. You can have a fulfilling life even if you don't find a long-term romantic partner."
asexuality,34wxs1,prewarpotato,3,Tue May 5 20:49:02 2015 UTC,"Is this all normal?   Since the number of asexuals is much lower relative to the number of allosexuals in the general population, normal isn't really the best word here.  Normal is too often used to reaffirm heteronormativity's stranglehold on culture by othering those who don't fit that mold by declaring them to not be normal.  Asexuals are not broken, wrong, or weird for being asexual in a world controlled and largely defined by allosexuals, but normal and not normal are going to be terms and labels used to other and exclude you by many, so you'll either need to commit yourself to redefining normal so it does not other people simply because they're not part of the majority or make your peace with no longer wanting to associate with the term.   Am I too young to know?   No, but you are still young enough that it's possible that you're demisexual or gray ace and as yet unaware of it as very real possibilities and then a much less likely possibility that you're on a delayed timer and will have a sexual awakening in your early adulthood.   Will I ever find a SO?    Probably.  There's always a chance either way, and there's a variety of factors in play.    Generally though, much like other GSRM(gender, sexual, and romantic minorities), your best bet for finding people you're compatible with is ending up in or around a large, preferably cosmopolitan urban center.   Everyone I've talked to about it says they wouldn't be with someone without sex.   Everyone you've talked to has likely been allosexual or at least thinks they're one, so, that makes sense.  If sex is a complete non-option for you then your pool for long-term life partners is naturally limited to people to whom sex isn't important(viz. another asexual or a non-libinous person) or for whom sex with their romantic partner isn't important and they're perfectly fine with getting it on the side or elsewhere in a polyamorous arrangement."
asexuality,34wxs1,rabiddogger,3,Tue May 5 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"It is both normal and possible. I knew at 12/13. Just like some people say they always knew they were gay. I think I just always knew. I'm almost 25 and I'm still told ""You just haven't met the right person"". Sure."
asexuality,34wxs1,MrTardy,2,Tue May 5 23:31:33 2015 UTC,"You are not too young to know. It is possible that you are sexual and just sex-repulsed, but it is just as likely that you are asexual and sex-repulsed. Identify yourself with whatever group feels right to you.  As far as finding an SO, I have the same fear. I would say to both of us that there is plenty of time to find someone, and there are plenty of people to find. Date people if you want to now, but I wouldn't expect to find lasting relationships in high school. Not many people in my school know about or accept asexuality, and I'm guessing that's true in a lot of places."
asexuality,34wxs1,osteopath17,2,Tue May 5 11:47:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that your family isn't more supportive. A lot of people don't even know about asexuality, and as such they don't even know how to start to understand it. But this sub is a pretty supportive group, and if you need to talk, you are always welcome here.   Is this all normal, or even possible?   Yes it is normal, and you are proof that it is possible. Many people won't understand because sexuality is such a big part of who they are. Its always present, and so it is hard for them to realize that for you it is always not present. Don't let that get you down.   Am I too young to know?   I knew I was asexual before 16. I didn't know the term, but I knew that I was different than my friends. They were off forming crushes and I was unsure what a crush even was.   Will I ever find and SO?   You are 16 (I don't mean to sound condescending, just stating a fact). There is so much time for you to find someone. It is very possible to find an SO. There are many asexuals in the world, and many sexuals who are willing to work on relationships with asexuals.  That all being said, I don't know if you are asexual. You could be asexual and sex-repulsed, but you could be sexual and sex-repulsed. Only you can know for sure.  I wish you the best on the journey of self-discovery! I hope my answers helped you at least a little bit."
asexuality,34wxs1,Dolphman,2,Tue May 5 14:55:57 2015 UTC,"Is this all normal   Yes   Will I ever find a SO? Everyone I've talked to about it says they wouldn't be with someone without sex.   Then thats their personal relationship needs. Doesn't scale to the entire population of the earth. Their are people who are either asexual or don't need highly sexual relationships, and not they are not a small amount. The main issue is our society says we are inherently wrong for our lack of sexual attraction, which leads to the self-censorship of ourselves to keep us from being socially isolated.  Luckily things are getting better and better overtime, and now seeking companionship is no longer a doomed venture."
asexuality,34wxs1,bubblewrappopper,1 point,Tue May 5 12:51:40 2015 UTC,"You do just need to meet the right guy. But you still probably won't want to have sex with him. Because you're asexual. You certainly can have mutual love without sex. If you know you're asexual, then you are. Many people who are gay say they knew at a very early age. My best friend said he knew he was gay since he was four. Asexuality is just another orientation. So, no you're not too young. Also, everyone you know says they wouldn't be with someone without sex? That's because sex is important to them. It's not important to you, and you can find someone (asexual as well or not) who values your company more than sex. Additionally, there's also asexuals out there who have sex. It doesn't do anything for them. It might please their partner. It might be because they want to start a family. An asexual person can choose sex if they want to, but please know that the people you've talked to don't realize that someone can hold another attribute to the same value as sex. You will be fine. Don't worry. (sorry if this was ramble-y)"
asexuality,34wxs1,Ruruskadoo,1 point,Tue May 5 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to your family - they are trying to fit you into a box.  If you're asexual, good for you!  I would recommend you follow these guidelines for the rest of your life:   Don't worry about relationships.  Unless you find another asexual person with whom to spend time with (if that's your thing), then you'll always enter into conflict by dating someone.  Why not skip all that? Don't label yourself.  I've seen so many gay or lesbian friends identify themselves as ""a gay man"" or ""a lesbian woman"" or ""a transgender whatever.""  Frankly, asexuals have risen above all that, in that we don't care about sex, so much so that we choose not to label ourselves by such a trivial adjective.  Better to be ""an educated person"" or ""a generous person."" Hopefully, you can transcend into what I consider to be nirvana: total isolation.  No dating, no commitment, no relationships, no children, no problems.  Human interaction really isn't necessary to have a good life - I would avoid it at all costs.  If I had to do it all over again (at 16, like you), I would have started then.  You are going to have an AWESOME LIFE!"
asexuality,34wxs1,Ruruskadoo,3,Tue May 5 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"Do you really believe all of that? I mean, sure, that might be right for you, but most people aren't aromantic, and they can end up feeling lonely and lacking without a romantic partner. I personally don't want a relationship, but I wouldn't eschew all human interaction. Social interaction can be fun, and those people can be there for you when you're feeling down and need someone to lean on.   Perhaps you don't feel that way and find it to be a nuisance, but that doesn't mean that's the right course for everyone else. Humans are a social species, and most would find cutting off all social contact to be detrimental to their mental (and physical) health. In fact, solitary confinement is hard enough on the human psyche that it actually is considered a form of psychological torture."
asexuality,34wxs1,MrTardy,1 point,Wed May 6 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your question, I'm happy to answer this.  The short answer is: I choose to live a certain way, and also give people a choice of options and see what they truly want.  This is a place where asexual / aromantic people can gather and share ideas.  No opinion is wrong, and nobody is judged for their choices.  But it should be obvious to anyone reading this subreddit that some folks just don't know what they truly want, and are asking for guidance.  I offer one opinion, and I stand by it.  If someone seeks to avoid intimacy, I encourage it.  But I push them farther than that to see if that would also be agreeable to them.  In my experience, asexuality is not enough.  Aromanticism is not enough.  They are, in my opinion, just the beginning of what can be an existence that transcends what we are USED to.    Sure, we evolved as a social species, but we don't have to stay that way.  I don't live alone on an island, I have to interact with other humans to carry out my daily tasks.  But I don't have to touch them or love them in any way, and I find it so freeing I can hardly describe it.  So yes, I encourage anyone who asks me to leave their socio-sexual worlds to the extent they can, and truly enjoy life."
asexuality,34wxs1,Dolphman,1 point,Wed May 6 18:18:31 2015 UTC,Personally I would have a hard time not having people I feel close to and care about. Even with pets I'd get lonely pretty quickly.
asexuality,34wxs1,ZeroDagger,2,Wed May 6 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"That's completely OK - it's your life and you own it.  Do whatever makes you happy.  There is a world filled with folks that feel as you do, who need some kind of social interaction.  The world would probably cease to exist if everyone stopped all contact, so we need people that think as you do.  For me, I can never be alone enough.  I find human contact repulsive."
asexuality,34wxs1,21stPilot,8,Wed May 6 18:36:05 2015 UTC,"Being a teenager is largely about finding out who you are, so I think it is important to know now, even if it doesn't make a huge difference."
asexuality,34wxs1,CoolTom,8,Tue May 5 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"Your mixing sexual desire with sexual attraction. Asexuals can still have (and love having) sex and they can still have healthy relationships. They are just not attacted to either Gender   And how betrayed will they feel when you proclaim yourself one of them but find yourself with proper sleep, exercise, and vitamin D in two years and realize that you have a healthy reproductive desire?    While that might make me healthier and allow others to be sexually attracted to me, it doesn't change my sexual attraction towards genders."

asexuality,34x21s,zoechan,2,Fri May 8 03:37:19 2015 UTC,"Probably neither. From my understanding, people feel their sexuality independent of their inhibitions. Those just get in the way of expressing it."
asexuality,34x21s,TangentialThreat,1 point,Fri May 8 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. My normally-pretty-bad anxiety around people goes through the roof when it gets sexual. Men can't get erections when anxious so I can't actually do shit.  It would probably be possible for me to have sex with enough antianxiety meds that I don't even remember who I am anymore, but my fear of people and generally rocky interactions with them kind of gets in the way of any long-term relationship.

Do you fantasize about having sex, but then in the moment freak out? Or do you get anxious in the moment because it's something you don't want? Again, no need to answer me personally, but if you lean toward the first it's likely anxiety that's your issue, but if you lean toward the second it's much more likely you're asexual."
asexuality,34x21s,TangentialThreat,2,Tue May 5 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"Imagine trying to get an arachnophobe to date a giant talking spider. Not only can he not do it, but he's probably not going to try that hard and it's not something he really fundamentally wants to do.

asexuality,34x21s,zoechan,3,Wed May 6 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting analogy. But are you supposed to date spiders to begin with? If this analogy is correct, I could definitely see how you might be asexual. Have you ever been attracted to someone sexually, in the sense that you might have met them/looked at them and thought, ""I'd like to tap that,"" without the fear being present? I guess I'm thinking of situations where it won't end up playing out (like watching someone on TV you find sexually appealing), because then there would be no need for the fear component in theory.  All this aside, only you can find out who you truly are. This isn't an easy thing to figure out for anyone, so don't try to rush assigning yourself a label one way or another until you've explored many different possibilities about yourself and allowed yourself time to really think it over and observe things you might have otherwise overlooked. I'd also recommend seeing a counselor or therapist to help you sort through the anxiety. It sounds really tough. = ("

This may be or not be True for you, but I realized my sexual frustration was not based on my sexual attraction, rather the societal pressure to have companionship and sexual relationships. .I still have sexual desires, but not sexual attraction towards any of the genders (atleast not enough to go out and find sexual relations).

Neither of these is a ""symptom"" of asexuality, and neither is something that precludes it.  Ultimately, no one else can tell you whether you are asexual or not, there's simply too many variables to tell. It's up to you to find out.

asexuality,34wh30,RedeyedRaven,10,Tue May 5 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"Only in the same way that bisexuality is. There are lots of people who claim it as just a passing phase for people who are either ""too afraid to come out as gay"" or ""just experimenting"". Needless to say, these kinds of assumptions tend to be wrong and damaging to people that identify as such. Saying, your sexuality doesn't actually exist.  That being said, yes everyone's sexuality is going to have some amount of fluidity. Most of the time it's a small enough range that you can identify as the same thing for much of your life. But sometimes it drifts far enough that people do feel like they need to readjust what they call themselves.  And then there is the fact that you, as an individual, are constantly discovering new things about yourself. I, personally, identified as demi for a while until I realized I was conflating sexual attraction to sexual desire and libido. I've been through some traumatic experiences and apparently a fluctuating sex-drive tends to be a result. But I realized that even when my libido is on the high end of the spectrum, it's not actually attracted to anyone.  My point is. Your sexuality is what it is as this point in time. It could be that you will always feel this way. It could be that at some future time in your life you feel sexually attracted to people you wouldn't have before. Be comfortable with yourself, and don't let other people make assumptions based on their own experiences because their experiences are not yours."
asexuality,34wh30,romaniwolf,8,Tue May 5 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Only in the same way that bisexuality is.   Yup, bisexual was my interim label until I discovered asexuality.  I think the problem is that so many people have trouble relating to asexuality. Instead of accepting it, their reaction is to deny its existence. That's why awareness is so important. We need to desensitize people to asexuality. Think of it as exposure therapy of sorts. :)"
asexuality,34wh30,ZeroDagger,6,Tue May 5 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"No. Asexual is not a interim label. However, sexuality can be fluid for some, and their is nothing wrong with realizing you had the wrong identity."

asexuality,34wh30,nemaline,4,Tue May 5 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it comes from confusion about what asexuality actually is.  It is the lack of sexual attraction, not necessarily a lack of sex drive, or bad sex, etc. For someone to say they thought they were ace until they had good sex doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.   When my friends sit around and talk about how this person is hot or  they really want to have sex with that person, it's kind of odd for me. I rarely look at a person and think ""getting naked and mashing our genitals together would be awesome!"" I can look at a person and say they are attractive, because I know what kind of people I'm interested in having a romantic relationship with or a kinky (non-sexual) fun with. I've also had a bunch of sex, some I enjoyed, some less so. I go back and forth between sex repulsed to actually wanting sex every few years or so. For many years, I had lots of sex because I was looking for that one time that would fix me or whatever - the whole finding the right person thing. In 20 years of having sex, I still feel best with the ace label.  Now, as others have said, sexuality is fluid and no one can define you but you.  If you don't feel sexual attraction to others, you are probably ace - if that's a label that works for you.   For the record, I'm 36, I currently ID as gray-a, pan-romantic or just queer. I've been though such labels as bisexual, pansexual and I think I once upon a time even went with straight (since anything else would have been detrimental to my health - queer acceptance has changed a lot over the last 20+ years).  The reason I went though all those other labels? Because I hadn't even heard of asexuality for most of those years and because for a long time ""queer"" just worked for me - mostly because I wasn't having any relationships (or I was just engaging in non-sexual BDSM), so I didn't need to define myself for anyone. I've also had a fair bit of sex, because I was doing the ""keep trying it until you like it"" thing, then because it seemed like the ""normal"" thing to do - the world is sex obsessed.   I hope you're able to find an ID that feels right for you. I think questioning is a part of any 'alternative' sexuality. Talking to other asexual folks is good, it will allow you to ask these questions in a safe space and many of us can relate to what you're going through."
asexuality,34wh30,Nymphetamean,4,Tue May 5 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"Well, there are many people who also think they are bisexual before that discover they are simply gay, or the other way around, bi people who thought they were homosexual at first. That doesn't make homosexuality and bisexuality any less valid, does it? :)   And as for having doubts about your identity, that's extremely common in the ace community. It's not easy to find out whether you are ace or not, and the remarks other people have rarely help.  I would also encourage you to read more about asexuality, the life stories of other asexuals, ace-themed blogs and so on. You'll get to know a lot more about the orientation and the problems it usually faces, which is often enough to find out whether the identity fits you or not."
asexuality,34wh30,dragon-storyteller,2,Tue May 5 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it can be, but I wouldn't say it usually is. One thing that is important is for people to be open to changes in their attractions, because a lot of people, of all orientations, run into crises of identity if they find themselves attracted to a person/people contrary to their identified orientation. Sometimes these things change, and sometimes people need different labels at different parts of their life as part of their search for self-understanding."
asexuality,34wh30,narrativedilettante,2,Tue May 5 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"Figured another anecdote could help, since it sounds like anecdotes are a main conflict.   I'm only 20, but I've been ace my whole life, even if I only figured out the label to go with it a few years ago. My sexuality is not the result of trauma, abuse, or medical anomalies. I don't intend to change my label, but if I do, it happens, and then I get to explore a new identity, so no biggie there.   As for these friends, perhaps you could explain that you feel pressured to fit into another identity? In all likelihood they aren't doing it on purpose, especially if they identify as LGBT+. People are just a bit weird about stuff they don't get."

Any trauma that happened to me happened because I was in denial of my asexuality and trying to live as a heterosexual. (And yes, second base can be traumatizing for an aromantic ace, especially if the guy you're with has no intention of stopping there.) Knowing I am asexual has helped me understand and deal with these traumas, because I know I'm not overreacting or behaving like a child. I'm reacting like an asexual.  Don't let fear and shame coerce you into a life of regret. Embrace your identity. If you ever meet someone you want to have sex with, then have sex with them. (Maybe you're demi or gray.) If you never meet someone you want to have sex with, don't have sex. If you aren't yearning for a sexual or romantic partner, don't look for one. Live the life that makes you happy."
asexuality,34wh30,astrobean,1 point,Wed May 6 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cumpulsory heterosexuality is a thing, so for instance it's actually not rare for many lesbians to id as ace until they realise they're actually gay. Sometimes I wonder if I'm also just one of them with lots of internalised lesbophobia, idk. But for the time being ""asexual"" describes this part of me well enough, and I'm not interested in actively proving this wrong or something. What I'm saying is, it's normal to feel this way.    if I can still consider myself an asexual if I can still enjoy the physical act of sex, and if romantic attraction implies that I must feel sexually attracted to the person on some subconscious level that I'm suppressing   I have a problem with this whole ""I am not sexually attracted to my SO but I am romantically attracted to them and enjoy sex with them / I am not at all attracted to them but I enjoy the act of sex with them"" bit because it makes asexuality sound like a joke a bit. It just doesn't sit right with me. For me asexuality means I am attracted to people (= I feel drawn towards them, I get ""butterflies"", I love looking at them etc.), but I am strictly not interested in sexual acts with them. The thought doesn't even cross my mind. It seems like the definition of ""asexual"" changed since I found out about it."

People can enjoy or be curious about the physical aspect of sex without being attracted to other people.  Personally, I think that it's not that the definition has changed- asexuality is still the lack of sexual attraction- but that people are becoming more open to different viewpoints within the range of people who identify as asexual.   Admittedly, it does make it harder to get dense people to understand when the ""rule"" is sort of vague, but I'd rather have a better understanding of what precisely asexuality is- or isn't- then be able to induct other people super fast.

asexuality,34wh30,dragonzflyte,1 point,Wed May 6 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"It is not an interim label. Many people do use the term loosely though, for times in their lives when for example, they may be celibate, or for a time they just haven't been attracted to anyone for a while. As others have said, sexuality is, or can be, fluid.  I still sometimes tell myself it is an interim label, because I have trouble coming to terms with it. I struggle to have the courage to formally identify with friends as an aromantic (though I'm sure they all have their suspicions anyway). I don't want to 'come out' because even though I know this is me, and that this is a permanent thing - I still hold out hope that one day I might miraculously be attracted to someone, will be in a relationship, and will live happily ever after with them.  I don't want to deal with people saying, ""But I thought you were asexual?!"" I guess you could say I'm in denial.  Romantic and sexual attraction for most of us, are not one and the same. At least, definitely not for me, so no, if you are romantically attracted to someone, you are not necessarily sexually attracted to them. This is a common way asexuality presents for many.  Try not to worry too much about labels, and if the way you feel about yourself or others changes, it changes.

You seem worried about it not for its own sake but because of the impact on your relationship, fair enough, and there are counsellors you could go to if you're worried. Whatever you decide, keep in mind that much as you love your SO, you two might be sexually incompatible, and could both benefit in the long term from if you end the relationship in its current form (still friends maybe?). You are both right that it sucks to stress about sex, but it doesn't read like you're woried about sex, but rather that the notion of sex and not actually wanting is is a daunting prospect in light of your SO's libido. So it seems to me that the task isn't to get you more comfortable with the notion of sex, but rather to decrease the sex pressure that's stressful.  Also, you didn't actually mention if you're asexual, if you are, have you discussed that with your SO? Do they understand what it means?"

Firstly, I'm asexual, I'm not broken, If you put a hitachi magic wand to my vulva then I am going to get wet. I may even think it feels nice, I may even have an orgasm. That's because those are physiological responses of a healthy human being.  But doing those things doesn't magically make me attracted to you or anyone.  If it's a straight man saying this, I always ask the same thing. If I put a blindfold on him, and then bring in my gay friend to give him the best blow job of his life, does that make him gay? no, It makes him a straight person who had a homosexual experience that was physically good, but emotionally void. Sure he might want to do it again because it felt good, But he's not going to turn gay.  EDIT: I want to be clear that in explaining this hypothetical situation to this straight man, I am not suggesting a bait and switch or assault situation, He is consensually agreeing to receive a blowjob from a gay man, the blindfold is used to get rid of any visual reminders as to the gender or appearance of the blowjob giver, This forces the straight man to focus on physical sensations and not the lack of sexually attractive woman to visually stimulate them. the same way an asexual does not have someone sexually attractive to look at during sex and instead may focus on physical sensation."

On a different note, if this is supposed to be such a good metaphor, where is the blindfold on the Ace individual during the physical experience it's supposed to be describing?

I don't know what you mean about the blindfold on the asexual individual. In terms of this scenario, this would be a normal encounter for an asexual who enjoys sex. The sexual attraction that was taken away from the heterosexual male never existed in the asexual."
asexuality,34ot5a,Trequetrum,1 point,Sun May 3 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what a hypothetical situation is. It's not real. As in, doesn't actually happen.   Like, if I told you what could happen if, hypothetically, there were a tree in your backyard, then you looked in your backyard... there wouldn't be a tree there. It's hypothetical. It's not real.  BUT! and let me stress this part, just because the hypothetical isn't real, the point it is trying to illustrate may still be legitimate.  For example, we could hypothetically (Read: Not for real) build a tree house in your backyard if you had a tree there. That's true regardless of whether or not there's a tree there.  If, god forbid, a man thought he was getting stimulated from a woman but was actually with a man, the fact that he enjoyed the experience doesn't change whether or not he's attracted to man.  I don't see how rape claims change that. It's not real... it didn't actually happen. We don't have to be concerned about consent. We're illustrating a point. So... just to make sure you follow, nobody was raped in the creation of this hypothetical situation.    Lets put it all in perspective with non-tree related example. Let say, hypothetically, I bisected my skull so that the left and right hemisphere of my brain were separated. You would be able to see where my optic nerves cross each other.  Whether or not this hypothetical me is dead is completely irrelevant. It's not real and I'm not going to die, so we can put that concern aside. In real life, of course I would be dead, but it's hypothetical. The idea that you could see my optic nerves still holds.    Considering hypothetical situations is actually quite useful. It lets you reasons about aspects of a situation without having to deal with the complications involved with creating that situation for real."

Or the rape in the hypothetical would detract from the point attempting to be made.  Or that a hypothetical is open enough to interpretation to be interpreted as something it's not intended to convey suggests that the language could be tightened up.   So... just to make sure you follow, nobody was raped in the creation of this hypothetical situation.

asexuality,34ot5a,ImAUnicornPrincess,1 point,Mon May 4 00:49:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll bite.  Lets step away from rape as that seems to be triggering and look at another hypothetical which is open enough to interpretation that an element with less than salubrious connotations can (without much trouble) be found.  Lets use the one about how my optical nerves cross inside of my skull (behind my eyes).  So that, hypothetically, if you bisect my skull from front to back, you should be able to see where those two nerves cross.  So it is rather easy to see that in this scenario I'm dead. I don't know of any way that my skull could be bisected such that I'd live to tell the tale. Even if I could think up such a thing, I must admit that the hypothetical is open enough to interpretation to be interpreted as something it's not intended to convey.  Please do explain how the point (the one about my optical nerves crossing) is detracted from by an element with less than salubrious connotations that changes the context.  Of course murder is wrong. Guess what? It doesn't change the fact that in this hypothetical, my optical nerves could be seen where they cross behind my eyes. It really doesn't.    In exactly the same way that pointing out other irrelevant consequences of the blindfolded blowjob doesn't change the point about which genders you are (or are not) attracted to.    Of course rape and murder are wrong. We are not condoning either of these actions by using or approving of either of these hypothetical situations insofar as they're contextually not used to make points about either rape or murder.  If, however, we approve these scenarios in real life in order to make points about nerves or sexual attraction, then we must consider all the other ramifications. That's why it's relevant that nobody was actually raped or murdered in the creation of these hypothetical situations. It's important precisely because it lets us make the point we intended.    If you have a counter example, I'm really quite willing to hear and/or discuss it. This wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong."

You're in the regular age range for puberty, but it's possible you just haven't hit the right stage yet.  It's also possible you are on medication that suppresses sex drive.  Or have a medical condition, most likely an imbalance, that has the same result.  Or, it's possible that you really are fundamentally asexual.  Too many variables in that list to be absolutely sure, based on nothing more than an internet post.  And, the fact that it is likely that you are in full fledged puberty means that everything in your body and mind is in flux.  You're an irrational ball of hormonal mood swings...by definition.  That's what puberty is!  I can understand why your mom and dad said what they did.  They are wrong about one thing, though.

It's hard for some folks to accept that other folks are totally okay with the possibility of never pairing off or producing offspring.   You may try reassuring them, at least for now, that this doesn't mean you're guaranteed to be alone forever. Many aces still have happy relationships, sometimes involving sex. A lack of attraction doesn't mean you'll never find someone you might want to get it on with.   It's also entirely possible you won't do all those things.

You're fine, if you feel as though at this point in your life that you are asexual, then you are (and if it turns out that later you're not, that's okay!

However, I didn't feel romantic attraction until I was 17, so if I had labeled myself as aromantic when I was your age I would have made a mistake. I think romantic and sexual orientations are two different things that can develop at different times. But since you're still young, consider that you may be into a transition phase and that something may change as you grow up. If you feel like you're asexual, you probably are. Whether or not labeling yourself as asexual should be 100% your choice. What I suggest is to wait coming out. Labeling yourself wrong can be a pain in the neck. You know you were just confused, but others don't. After you've told everyone you're X-sexual, becoming Y-sexual may result in people talking ill about you or getting the wrong impression. So if you feel asexual label as one, but wait a little longer to let other people know - if you're interested in coming out, that is."

In 1 Corinthians chapter 7, Paul talks about ""the gift of singleness"" and he basically says that it is a gift to be able to be happy with being single and if you are made this way it is better to stay single.  Paul himself was never married. If you are considering talking to your parents about it, I would definitely point them to that chapter, no hardcore Christian would try to argue against the word of Paul.  ;)  If you're wondering, I'm not out to my parents and I don't plan on doing that.  Not because they'll think its wrong just because I like to keep my sexuality private.  Whether or not you live by the word of the Bible or not there is NO reason for you would need to force yourself to be heterosexual.  I hope this helps!  :)"

But seriously   I need to know if I should try a little harder to make the heterosexual thing work.   This is not how orientations work. There's been way too many asexual people who tried to force themselves into heterosexuality and sexual activity when it simply wasn't in their nature, and have suffered a lot for it. That's not right. If you aren't heterosexual in the first place, trying to be it's never going to work and will only make you miserable. Believe me, I know.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with asexuality. You know who you are, and how you feel. Don't place your religion above your identity."

The way I see it, the 7 deadly sins are the basic foundation of most, if not all sin, and I don't see asexuality fitting into any of them. And by forcing yourself to ""try the heterosexual thing,"" you're just going to make yourself and another person miserable. Forcing yourself to do that, in my opinion, is lying, which is a sin. And it affects other people, which is even worse.   That said, it doesn't mean your sexuality isn't fluid and that one day if you meet someone who you do like, that you should stay away. And it also doesn't mean that your parents would be very accepting of it. I think asexuality is the least accepted sexuality in all demographics.

By the standards of your religion, your god made you the way you are and as such, there is nothing wrong with you."
asexuality,34e2sl,Dolphman,2,Thu Apr 30 14:16:36 2015 UTC,"My parents were the kind to tell me that it was wrong of me to consider myself asexual when I was a teenager.  I ""tried hard"" at being the good heterosexual girl they expected me to be, waited to have sex until I was married, and really tried hard to be a good wife and ""give"" sex to my husband (I say give, because I never wanted to have it, I only made it happen for my love to him and to make him feel good).  After 6 years of trying, we both acknowledged it wasn't going to happen naturally and that it wasn't going to work out for us.  By then, I was confident enough in myself to go against what I had been raised to believe and came out as asexual.  Like many people have already said here, asexuality isn't a sin, in fact it was something Paul even encouraged, for those who were able to live that way.  With that in mind, when I came out to my parents, that is what I reminded them.  They already knew of the struggles I had gone through in my marriage, they knew it wasn't just me giving up, they were very aware that I had tried very hard to do things the way they wanted me to, and that it wasn't working.  No amount of praying, women's-christian-sexuality-book reading, christian therapy, sex-positive therapy, doctor's visits, medicine changes, or types of birth control I tried made any difference at all. I love my parents, and I know they love me, I know that what they told me when I was a teenager wasn't done with love out of their minds, but sometimes I do regret having listened to them when I first questioned my sexuality.  It would have saved me many years of pain, it would have made it so I didn't have the low self-esteem I have now, and it would have saved a lot of time and sorrow to my now ex-husband.  I'm pretty sure they are aware of that as well, and feel bad about it.  If you can make it without having to go through that regret, my advice to you is to do it.  Try explaining it to your parents in a very thoughtful and loving way, show them that it's not a whim, and that you have tried your hardest to make sure it's something real within you.  Doing it that way definitely helped my parents understand my position better."

At least the Catholic Church has nothing against and says nothing is inherently  sinful for just being Asexual.  The Churchs teaching most likely go the same as other non-hetero teachings (Abstain from sex basically). Since Asexuals are not necessarily all Heterosexual and not all sex-neutral/sex-negative it may be sinful if you have sexual relationships without a valid (in the eyes of the church) Heterosexual marriage. (then again, very few relationships actually wait into marriage. so it more so we are all sinful. regardless of sexual orientation.)

But, modern American Christianity doesn't always do the best job of adhering to scripture.  In many Evangelical churches, there is a culture that has developed around married life.  When you're young, this is not that big of an issue, but around the time you hit 30, you may start to notice some shift in attitude.  For example: I once attended a church that organized their Sunday School classes by age.  They had college age & young singles, divorced singles, married 20's, married 30's, married 40's, etc.  I was once asked if I came to church that Sunday alone, and applied in the affirmative, where upon the person said, ""Oh, that's such a shame!"" My aunt once said of my life, ""Well, at least it seems like you have friends.""  This was the same one, who later visited the city that I live in.  When I drove out to her hotel to dinner, she marveled at how ""brave"" I was to have driven for 20 whole minutes to see her!  I have more stories, and won't recount them all, but I do put some to say that going forward I would put an emphasis on finding a church that will accept you and allow you in as a full & complete member of their congregation regardless of marital status."

The confines of such writings makes moving forward into modern times quite difficult, I imagine - hence your need for clarity.  Back on track though --  I'd imagine that the lack of lust is more of a pro than a con in Christian beliefs. Even if one has lust, there is a difference between having it and acting upon it. Using that train of thought, even if you don't fit into the ""heterosexual"" model, then you still wouldn't be falling outside of religious expectations. It's the same reasoning that homosexual people that don't do anything homosexual shouldn't be bombasted by religious zeelots.   Just something to think about; I hope you can find some peace. :)"

What I choose to do with my desires, or lack thereof, is that personal choice stuff from which sin flows...  As I said, I don't see NOT acting on absent desires to be sinful.  But I'm going to make a suggestion.  I have the impression that only a church authority whom you personally respect would be able to provide what you would accept as a definitive answer.  If you are so concerned about this, and so seemingly dedicated to identifying your lack of feelings as sinful, I suggest that you speak to your preacher.

If you do have sex, you'll be unhappy and end up resenting him. Maybe not right now, but eventually.

These sorts of posts really blur together for those of us with eye issues.     It sounds like you have sexuality but only when you're just getting to know a partner and once you're established in a committed relationship you can't stand forms of physical intimacy that are suggestive of sexuality, let alone actual sex acts.    Sounds sort of like the opposite of commitment issues, where you view sex as part of acquiring a mate and not as part of maintaining a relationship or as part of maintaining your emotional health.  In that case it sounds like the two of you are just not compatible and need to accept this and take this into account in the future when it comes to how you approach dating and finding a life partner.   If he's in love with you then naturally he's not going to want to leave you, but it's a better option to call things off now than to end up resenting one another.     As for your concerns about hormones... if it's actually something that can be fixed by looking at your bloodwork and tweaking your hormonal balance, then it's not really part of your identity and you'd actually refine and better perfect your knowledge of your self and your identity.  And if you confirm that it has nothing to do with your hormones then you have even more certitude in what you currently know.  So that's win-win, really.  If it can resolve your issues with sexuality and bring harmony to your relationship or give you certitude and something concrete to smack people with going forward on your own again.     The only other option is to examine things from a psychological angle, since you mentioned you thought there might be some form of commitment issue there, and the only way to find that out for certain is to pursue therapy to see if you really do have a mental block.

You only have the following options:   a compromise in which you consent to occasional sex to make him happy a relationship with zero sex expected or asked for, ever an open relationship that guarantees he doesn't have sex with you a breakup so you find compatible partners   Losing a relationship hurts.

asexuality,34774l,osteopath17,3,Wed Apr 29 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"My late aunt had paranoid schizophrenia, and one of her recurring delusions was the idea that she was pregnant. She continued to believe she was pregnant, even though she was long divorced and mostly housebound (so very little likelihood of sex), was old enough that she'd probably gone through menopause, and had been convinced of her pregnancy for a number of years (when she would presumably have given birth after the first ~9 months).  Eventually she arrived at the same conclusion everyone else had and realized she definitely couldn't be pregnant. But instead of just dropping the delusion altogether, she simply moved it on to me.  I was in my late teens when my dad, on the phone to her, said, ""No, I don't think so. Hey, narrativedilettante, you're not pregnant are you?"" I said no, and he got back to his conversation. A few minutes later he put me on the phone so I could talk to my aunt.  She asked me, ""I didn't give away your secret, did I?""  I told her there wasn't any secret to give away.  From her perspective, it made a lot more sense for me to be pregnant than for her to be pregnant. I was young enough to be fertile and old enough that an outsider might assume I was having sex. But I hadn't had sex, and having to convince my aunt that I wasn't pregnant every time I talked to her was exhausting. Especially because about half the time she seemed pretty convinced that I was pregnant but that it was a secret she and I were hiding from the rest of the family."

Might sound silly, but I often find turning it around on the person and asking them the same question, or similar, if it's possible to. So if it's other women asking if you're pregnant, ask them if they are! You shouldn't have to explain yourself to them, unless you're happy to of course, but I find that being straight to the point often shuts people up pretty quickly! If you say that you'd appreciate it if they would stop asking, and they keep asking... Well then repeat the same response until they finally get the message!"

When he was dating that one lady and, she ended the relationship, he simply shrugged and carried on, because it was only an obligation for him to fulfill. When he was no longer required to fulfill the obligation he deleted the related memories and behaviors. That's not to say that he wasn't attached in his own way, just that it didn't translate well to a human equivalent.   It's hard to believe any relationship between human and AI would be completely fulfilling for either party, since neither can truly understand the other. But then, who can say for sure either way until it actually happens, (or conclusively does not happen)?"

I wasn't really referring to sexual relationships, so much as all relationships, including friendships and romantic relationships. I guess I never really thought about the whole gender/sexuality thing, but perhaps the AI could pick for themselves, if they wanted to choose one specific thing to identify with at all?   Honestly, I dislike the idea of a created AI, with a fully developed personality, because I find it hard to justify one conscious being having so much control over another being. Once you've reached the point where you can assign a gender, or sexuality,  it's probably more ethical to leave the decision up to the being in question. (idk. Does that make any sense, or have I gone off topic? It's hard to tell right now...)"
asexuality,347la9,dragonzflyte,3,Sat May 2 06:38:11 2015 UTC,"Ohhh I like this thread. I've been on a total AI/Robot fiction kick lately and thought about this sort of thing a lot. I do think that, unless they somehow found a way to specifically program sexual attraction into it, AI would be asexual by default. Even if it was designed to interact in a sexual way with humans, because behaviour doesn't affect orientation.   I believe that a sufficiently complex AI could have some sort of relationship with humans, be it romantic or queerplatonic but at the end that's mostly just labels. That's not the same as saying it would work well or end up well, especially for humans. This is something we see in 'Her' (which I really loved btw), where the main character ends up being unable to understand the AI, more in love with the idea of what she wants her to be than what she really has become. He is assuming things and keeping the same standards he'd have for a human partner, which simply wouldn't work. Even though we can draw parallels to human experiences, AI would experience love and asexuality in a fundamentally different way, and that can't be ignored. It'd end badly for people who couldn't accept that."

Not sure the main character wants to have sex with the ""beautiful boy"" so much as engage in ""conceptual erotic fixation"".  I wonder if ""eros"" can be expressed without sexual contact. Mutually agreed upon ""mindf*cking"" where a co-dependent relationship is developed as a way for 2 people to become one person, and therefore experience the ecstasy of being the ""other"", ""mind melding""/radical pair bonding.  The fantasy is much better than the reality.  Fanboys/girls are a model for your topic. We absorb -via catharsis- the power of idols. I don't have to tell anyone how that is done; movie theatres and concerts/shows have replaced churches as the main worship space. It's not a cliche to say so either.   I am ok with people thinking of ""siri"" or chatbots as ""friends"". Relate that into the concept of ""daemons"" in classical Greek culture.     Asexuality still involves bonding; in my personal ""ace"" experience, I have loving relationships with unconventional ""friends"". I have several ""invisible friends"" and they are my ""family"" (see 'framily' commercials). I hug someone while sleeping who has no form.  My imagination is powerful enough that I can live that way.

Well, there's sexting and other forms of erotic exchange that developed when we were lower down in the tech tree, so I suppose that depends on what you mean by sexual contact.

asexuality,347la9,sikfoq,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"I qualified the use of ""eros"", knowing that it could be interpreted out of context.  The ""meatbag"" involved in my scenario is brains. Contents of brains. Transmission of contents. Dialogue as intimacy producing erotic fixation, lust, anticipation of exchange.  Narcissistic supply -two way street though in how usually, it's a dominator feeding off a passive possession.  Even with AI personalities, objects are still present, patterns are concentrated, and thus, imperfection is possible. Dissonance produces disgust; we know an artificial intelligence is high on the Turing scale if they are repulsed by who they are interacting with."

A lot of the other asexuals I know love the film, and I definitely felt something from it that I haven't felt in other films with relationships. I think that the film shows that one doesn't need sex in relationships. It's more about what you do with said person, and I think the way Her depicts that relationship opens up the conversation to asexuality and AI.  I think that having some sort of relationship with the relationship and the talking taking a focus is another thing that the film focuses on, even LDRs. Think about it: the person you are in love with is as far from you as possible and it's near impossible to see that person (in Her, you have the scene where Samantha hires a surrogate, but it's only once), and it focuses on the strength of someone's love surpassing the distance.   I have way too many thoughts about this and they are all jumbled, definitely would like to tackle this head on one day."

However, we are a long ways away from having our friends replaced by computers.  Current AI research is generally focused on performing a single task.  Yes a lot of what we have is impressive, but an AI that can form its own opinions, its own personality, that one could talk to, and develop a relationship with is a very long way down the road."

Pretty extreme, even, I'd say, since that goes well beyond what most people who have triggers deal with, since my understanding is that losing consciousness is generally more medically serious than a panic attack, at least so long as the panic attack doesn't lead to other health complications.

asexuality,341all,live_wire_,6,Tue Apr 28 08:40:20 2015 UTC,"Well, the part that makes someone be on the asexual spectrum is whether they have sexual attraction, especially to other humans, rather than whether an individual has a libido.  So if you're not attracted to people but still want to get off via masturbation, you'd still be asexuality-spectrum in some manner in all likelihood.  Of course, not being attracted to men or women still leaves non-binary individuals as potential avenues of exploration, I suppose.   I want to get married and have a family someday. I know that I don't enjoy sex but I will do my best to keep my future husband satisfied.   Is the important thing here the spouse or the children?  Because you can have a family without a spouse via adoption and sperm donation.  There are also alloromantic asexuals you could pursue relationships with, too."

I told my mother, formally came out I suppose, when I was 43.  I remember the conversation, to this day.  Two, true asexuality is a perfectly valid orientation.  But it's also a common and well documented side effect of quite a few medical conditions, and statistically it is more probable that someone is sick than a true asexual.  Yes, we are that rare.  Consequently, the section about not going to a doctor is worrisome, not because it is incorrect, but because it might be genuinely bad advice.    My mother and I made a deal that if my sex drive hadn't turned on by the time I turned 25, that I would go to a doctor and get checked out.  Needless to say, I was fine...but getting checked out was prudent.  Three, overall this article actually touched on quite a few good points.  Well done.  It's a nice guide; definitely not exhaustive, but it's not meant to be.  Nice resource.  I wish this sort of thing had been around during my formative years."

I said don't bother sending your child to a therapist to ""fix"" their asexuality, but I didn't say don't go to a doctor, period.  I said if there are other signs, then definitely a doctor visit is in order.  I've seen many people who have been put through countless medical tests only to end up proving that nothing was ever wrong to begin with, but the only case I'm aware of where a brain tumor was responsible for asexuality was one handled by Dr. House, MD.  A sudden decrease of interest?  Go see a doctor.  No interest to start with?  Probably not an issue.

Asexuality is just an identity and there is no black and white for it.  My situation could help you clue into whether or not you want to identify as asexual. I recently started defining myself as asexual, and I had started taking an SSRI only about 2 months before that happened, which definitely decreased my sex drive. However, asexuality makes sense to me also because of how I dealt with relationships in the past. Even though I was hornier back then, I didn't enjoy the actual experience of being with other people, although I enjoyed getting rubbed off by girls.

I don't know if I'm the only one, but I've always had the impression that asexual people are more asocial and shy than allosexual people. Research shows that this is not wrong: asexuals tend to be more asocial than allosexuals. So from outside your asexual model could be:   Someone who doesn't like talking about sex or who looks completely clueless about it.  Someone who is shy and/or doesn't like physical contact.  Especially among younger people, someone who has never had a relationship and who doesn't seem to care.    If I met someone like this irl, I'd probably contemplate they're asexual."

Wearing a public symbol, like the black ring, is a visible way to announce it publicly, but be aware that we are so rare that it is unusual to actually meet another ace in public.  I've met 3.  It is unlikely that simply wearing the ring or even something more noticeable like a button would be viewed as controversial.  (And, common religious symbols aren't controversial)  But it might start a conversation or two.  The idea is to not HIDE who you are...but screaming it at the top of your lungs isn't necessary, either.  And, just for reference, the LGBT community, at least the ones I've had the misfortune to encounter, are largely a bunch of unwelcoming and closed minded bigots, as are most people who demand tolerance but refuse to show it towards others.

Not that I'd wear a shirt that said ""I'm an Asexual!!"", but it could at least be an awareness thing. As in your example, gay awareness used to be uncommon, then became more widespread, and now (at least where I live) It's just festivals and events. This is because the community became more informed about gays and realized that they had no choice about their sexuality, that it was natural, and that it was something to be expected and accepted. Before those times, gays were either unheard of or heavily frowned upon, and many that were gay hid their identity and tried to act ""normal"". That being said, I think that something like this WOULD be a lot better if lots of the black-grey-white-purple colours started showing up, and then people started learning and knowing. They would inevitably go through the phase that asexuals were an embodiment of satan, but they would eventually come to their senses. And during the movement, many unknowing asexuals would find their true identity and feel just a bit more loved.  I might dream too big, but it's a thought."

There are even colours specific to aromantic aces, if you want to wear those as well.   /u/dakotabethany is right that people outside lgtbqia groups probably won't recognise them, but if it's a matter of personal pride, then that will probably just mean you don't have to deal with people making assumptions about your special pin or scarf or necklace (etc.).

asexuality,33wvvu,mundabit,15,Sun Apr 26 12:08:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your story! It's really interesting to see how allosexual and asexual feelings are different from the same perspective.
asexuality,33wvvu,Not_A_Piano,10,Sun Apr 26 15:43:29 2015 UTC,I think this was probably one of the most useful descriptions of sexual attraction I've read.  This may help me a lot when (If?  When.) I end up in a relationship.  It's fantastic to hear sexual attraction put into terms stemming from not having experienced it before.  I feel like I'll be able to identify it more easily if I ever do find I experience it.
asexuality,33wvvu,ace_detective,10,Sun Apr 26 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"That was the best description on the subject I've ever read. I went on a hunt for such descriptions of this elusive ""sexual attraction"" once I found my own orientation, but they would focus on the physical side nearly exclusively.  Now it'll be harder for me to callously dismiss sexual attraction as something purely carnal. I just have to hope that the male side of the equation isn't as shallow as it's made out to be, or else I'll be back to square one if I turn out to have grey tendencies."

asexuality,33wvvu,Sontarah,2,Sun Apr 26 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting read, thanks for sharing. I've had similar experiences myself, so I'll throw you a word of caution. I'm now 3 years in to my first ever relationship where I experienced sexual attraction. I've had about 7 long term relationships before this one, where I either did not or forced myself to engage sexually. It was quite remarkable for me at this late age to finally experience a hint of it, but for me anyway, it has worn off. I've had to force it for about a year now. It's very disappointing to briefly experience that and then lose it.  Actually I wouldn't mind at all if my partner was not still allosexual, I still am under obligation, and that's the worst feeling of all for me."
asexuality,33wvvu,LunarNight,3,Sun Apr 26 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your words of caution, But I hope you realise that you are the one putting yourself in that situation, You need to talk with your partner about the fluidity of your sexuality, just as I spoke to my husband and thus managed to avoid the feelings of regret or obligation.  I know where you are comming from though, The relationship I got into right after I left my husband was very similar, Though I never had sexual attraction for the guy, he made me feel obligated to have sex with him in exchange for the intimacy I wanted (hugs, kissses etc) and I felt like I was a prostitute because it was such a clinical, business like ordeal to have sex with that man. I'm not a fan of ultimatums, But I had to make one, Either he acknowledges and respects my lack of sexual attraction, Or I have to leave for my own emotional health. I left."

And honestly my current relationship is the best I've had in this regard so far, my ex used to sulk and guilt trip me everytime I said no, but the sucky part for me this time was that I started out attracted to him and it waned.   I had a year of ""hey maybe I'm cured"" (btw yes I know this is a totally fucked up way to see my own asexuality but I grew up before it was a known thing and I've got a lifetime of guilt and accusations to overcome - my mother used to tell me no one would ever love me if I couldn't put out, and that I would be cheated on, etc)"

End the relationship. Stop martyring yourself if you don't want sex. This will eventually transform into a cauldron of annoyance, regret, and cheating.   You've said in the past it feels like rape. Why the fuck would you stay in a relationship where you are being raped, other than because you couldn't get out safely?"

I feel as though I'm ace.  When me and my girlfriend are together I usually don't feel the need to have sex, but I strongly feel the need to snuggle and be embraces by her. I get aroused, and we do sexual stuff a lot. I don't hate it, but I really wouldn't mind if it wasn't there. I like how it makes me feel physically. I just get more out of snuggling, and spooning, and just being close in non-sexual ways. We've had sex, and will continue to have sex. I like sex, and it feels good. I just don't get the same feelings she gets from it. She talks about the connection and the emotions from it. I get those feeling when we are close and hugging and just. I don't need sex to feel that way. I know she does though, and it's not like I hate sex so when I feel okay about it we do have sex. She just doesn't understand out I can like not crave her in a sexual way. I crave her hug and snuggles. Its weird to me, because I don't like physical contact with anyone but her. I can sit next to someone and have our knees touch or elbows or anything. With her I want to lay on her and hug her forever.  But I've gone on too long. I just wanted to know if anyone who was more familiar on the subject of asexuality could tell me if what I described sounds like it"

After being pressed about what Jenner's next relationship will look like, here's how it went:  Jenner: ""I understand your question, okay? * I *   * DON'T *... um... Let's go with... Asexual."" Sawyer: ""For now?"" Jenner: ""For now. Yeah.""  There was a lot of hand motioning and word emphasis that doesn't come across in text. It was clearly an ""I don't know, I don't really care to define it, I'm going to need to figure it out when I start to discover who I am, so here's a random answer, now can we stop talking about this?"" kind of response.  I would need more direct and unambiguous evidence before I'd accept it as a coming out.  Plus, in another part of the interview, there was this line:  ""I am, as far as I know, heterosexual.""  I'm reminded of this piece, regarding Tim Gunn:  http://www.asexualityarchive.com/that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it/"
asexuality,33s6ul,AsexualityArchive,2,Sun Apr 26 06:37:13 2015 UTC,"While it's great that Bruce Jenner is making strides to self-discovery, scapegoating into asexuality is a negative approach. Transitioning has a lot to do with changes in the body and the way the body works and normalizes towards it's new neutral.   Why bring asexuality into it and connect mainstream media with the relationship between medication and hormones and asexuality? It's a step backwards, frankly."
asexuality,33s6ul,oskietje,2,Mon Apr 27 09:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that Bruce hasn't changed his pronouns yet. He's still comfortable being referred to as ""he"" while he's transitioning.

asexuality,33s6ul,poptarts91,2,Mon Apr 27 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"This thread is a little old, but I wanted to weigh in as it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately.  When I first heard Bruce identify as asexual, however hesitant it may have been, I was upset. It seemed as if he was using it as a scapegoat or a placeholder just to avoid the topic of sex all together (which no one should be asked about, but I digress). After thinking about it a while, I realized that this may be a valid situation that Bruce is in.  I myself am struggling with coming to terms with my gender and sexuality. This is part of what is making both things so confusing. I often think that if I had different genitalia, I would experience sexual attraction. I used to attribute my lack of sexual attraction to the disconnect between the body I want to have and the one I actually have. Depending on my mindset, my level of sexual desire varies a lot. Feeling comfortable and validated gets me to that ""almost"" point of sexual attraction, and this really didn't occur to me until I started putting all the pieces together.  While I definitely don't think the Bruce is the most common representation of asexuality, ""asexual, for now"" may be the best way he had to describe his feelings at the time. It may hurt the community for that to be the only example of asexuality that much of America sees, but I applaud him for speaking his truth. I can only hope it sparks further conversion and increases asexuality awareness.  I used male pronouns here, because Bruce hasn't requested that alternate pronouns be used."

Isn't acceptance and love about the right to be happy with who you are, instead of trying to pretend to be something you physically are not? Some people are short, some are thin, some have noses or ears or other body parts ""too big or too small"" − Elective surgeries should be reserved for correcting disfigurement or disability, not overcoming how we feel counter to fact.    I have identified as an aromantic asexual for years.  I do wish I could have a relationship, but I am trying to learn to be happy with myself regardless. It seems to me Jenner has failed to simply be happy with reality and has resorted to self-mutilation. Honestly, nobody cares if you like dolls or trucks, or dress like a Hells Angel or a ballerina, or any of that. Isn't self-mutilation the opposite of self-acceptance and self-happiness?

Don't pretend you're asking a question.  You're not.    You're sanctimoniously making a completely bullshit, ignorant and uninformed comment... and somehow relating the feeling of gender dysphoria and trans-identity to your longing for a relationship despite being aromantic.

Imagine getting to grips with a huge burn that covers your entire body. You don't feel good about the way you look or feel, your body doesn't feel like you, so you change it as best you can so you can get a bit of comfort and get through the rest of the day. Sometimes doing your hair and makeup is enough, but sometimes the discomfort is so bad you need to see a surgeon.  I understand that you're struggling to come to terms with your orientation, but it's really not the same thing. If someone needs to go under the knife to feel at home in their own skin then why even argue about it? They're adults who are well within their right to modify their own body and their choices don't affect your life in the slightest. We're not talking about just wanting to look different either. Your gender identity is not a fashion statement or just wish fulfillment or something, it's something that's ingrained in you, and sometimes it's painful if you can't express it properly. There are so many trans people who have committed suicide because the dysphoria they feel and the transphobia they experience leaves them feeling like they have no other option. So the LGBT+ community should absolutely support trans people who want surgery, because they fucking deserve it. Why would we deny them something that can save their life?"

I understand that for asexuals like you, conceptualizing sex this way may be helpful for your relationship and well-being, but many asexuals simply aren't willing to have sex and/or find sex inherently frightening, traumatic, repulsive, or even outright physically painful. Telling them that having sex for their partner's benefit is an ""alternative"" to being always alone is potentially extremely hurtful, especially since some people (even people who aren't on the ace spectrum!) are happy to be in a relationship without having sex with their partner. When an asexual person isn't willing to have sex with their partner, it's not because they don't love them enough or don't want to give them a gift or selflessly spend time on them, it's because they aren't willing to have sex with their partner."

Myself, I've never been in a romantic relationship or otherwise had an opportunity to express my love for someone through sex, so I can't speak from experience. But it does seem possible.  However, some asexuals are sex-repulsed, and never want to have sex at all. Sometimes the sexual partner in a relationship will feel unwanted or unloved by the asexual partner (because it can be hard for some people to really accept that love isn't always about sexual attraction), and if both are not very careful and accepting that can lead to relationship strife. Plus, there's the issue of a partner seeming to always want sex and it becoming a chore, something the asexual partner does out of a sense of obligation.  In short, I think there are people who make relationships work in part by having sex for the sake of their partner's enjoyment, giving themselves freely and enjoying the connection and feeling good about making their partner feel good. However, I don't think that doing so is enough to avoid all the potential pitfalls in a sexual/asexual relationship."

And maybe that you understand her lack of desire for sex, and that you don't want to pressure her to do something she isn't comfortable with.

Explain how sex is physical and emotional for you, and lacking it in a relationship makes a huge, un-ignorable void. Mainly, be kind and be honest.  Sometimes, it helps to go into it not aiming for a break up. Instead, express the issue fully and wholly. Then, transition into finding a resolution. Find a resolution that is fair for both of you. If the only resolution is breaking up, then you will have come to the conclusion together and hopefully she won't feel as bad.

This went a bit more smooth for us, mostly because we had really good communication, so I was fully aware of how my asexuality was affecting him, and he was fully aware of how his sexuality was affecting me. When I finally decided to accept that I wasn't gonna change, that no matter how much we tried and no matter how much we loved each other (truly, everything but the sexual incompatibility was AWESOME), things weren't going to change.  He didn't want to live life either feeling guilty for forcing me to do something I didn't want to do, or feeling like he is missing out on a big part of his life.  I didn't want to live life with the guilt of making him feel so frustrated and unfulfilled (we had spent 6 years on me trying to do what I really didn't feel like doing or even wanted to do at all).  Once we decided that it would be best for both of us to split ways, it felt like a huge burden was lifted off from us.  We're still good friends, try to hang out every once in a while, and I'll always support him whenever he finds someone that fulfills all his needs.  He's almost always there for me when I need the support, he still takes care of me when I can't do it on my own. Even though we couldn't imagine our lives without each other, we both feel a lot better about life now that we're apart than when we were together.  It's not like we're never going to see each other again, we just don't see each other as often as we did when we lived together.  And there's no stress because one wants something the other one can't give :)"
asexuality,33s6zq,ver_sacrum,3,Thu Apr 30 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"Judging by what you wrote here, you don't want an open relationship, you just want sexual intimacy with your partner, something that an open relationship would not bring. But your question is hard; what is the best way to break up with anyone? You don't blame her for her sexuality, but she can't blame you for yours, either, and it feels like you're being ignored. I'd probably start of by explaining that you understand her side of it, but that doesn't mean everything is fine. I guess explain how you feel without being hurtful or rude (for instance, saying that you never wanted to pressure her into doing anything she didn't want to do but you did enter this relationship under the assumption that she would want to be intimate with you at some point would be a better way of saying that you're upset that she never wants to have sex with you). Aside from that, acknowledge that this relationship (and you) has caused some issues where she felt ignored or her needs weren't being met (if you're surprising her and she didn't know you were upset by this, expect some anger or sadness, and expect to be blamed; partners are expected to communicate issues before they decide they have reached the point where a relationship is no longer compatible. So, if you haven't considered talking to her about this before you decide to break up, remember that an argument is always easier than a breakup). At the end, explain that you don't think this relationship is good for either of you, and that you think it's time that you two consider ending it. Don't expect this to be short, and don't expect this to be one-sided. This is why breakups suck and why so many people decide to break up through text message, sacrificing any chance of that person ever liking you again, all because it's easier and quicker."

I know it's not sudden, even at the start of the relationship I asked about it and then continued doing for all the years we've been together and I never get a definite response. She's said that eventually she would want to be that way yet it's been so long and I just do not believe her anymore.   I don't want to hurt her but I don't think I have a choice, she knows I'm sexual and not asexual and eventually want to have sex. I guess I've always thought that If I stay with her long enough that ""Don't know"" would turn into ""Yes"" and she does actually feel that way about me. Never seems like it'll be the case though."
asexuality,33s6zq,dragon-storyteller,0,Sat Apr 25 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"If I may say my opinion, she hasn't been fair to you. I understand her, because at the start of a relationship I also wouldn't know whether I'd ever have sex or not. But she has been dragging this for years - which already seems like an answer to me - while telling you she would probably have sex with you sooner or later. You have acknowledged and accepted her position, but she hasn't considered yours. To be honest, it sounds horrible. I'm sorry for you and I hope you can feel okay after breaking up, because I think you deserve it. You have been patient and understanding - the best qualities an asexual could wish for their partner. Good luck."

Most asexuals understand that sex is important for non-asexual people and are okay with the other person fulfilling themselves sexually with somebody else.  You should definitely tell her how you feel, though. Maybe she simply doesn't realise how awful this is for you. I can tell you from experience, it is very, very painful when your other half always tells you that everything is alright and then suddenly breaks up with you because of your asexuality."

We aces are completely incompatible with that mindset."

Also, because gay people still have sexual attraction and desire, it's just configured in a different way from straight people, which is easier for someone with sexual attraction to understand than how someone can lack the capacity for it completely."

There is a lot of heterosexual porn out there, in which the girl appears to be in some degree of pain from the activity.  There are lots of videos that cater specifically to this, even if it's just implicit.  I think that more than anything, this is a consequence of the basic caveman idea of ""the bigger your penis is, even if it's impractical, the better.""  This could cover up the issue and play a role in people (namely guys that watch a lot of porn) not knowing about vulvodynia.  Some people may just think that's how sex is.  Just a guess though!"

Many other conditions that are not truly vulvodynia (diagnosis is made by ruling out other causes of vulvar pain) could be confused with it.    That percentage doesn't look too reliable to me, as it could well include women who don't know how to have sex or who are too stressed/scared to relax enough. However women who feel pain during sex certainly exist, but I don't really know how that can be related to asexuality. Asexuals don't want sex because they don't feel any urge to have it, not because it causes them pain.   P.s. If someone has problem with this, they may want to have a look here."

Well, recall that in many places in the U.S. it's either taken as a joke or actually is a joke because it's abstinence-only with all of that wonderful religious baggage.  And then outside of the U.S. it's mostly just taken as a lark in anglophone countries.  No idea about non-anglophone ones though.   Instead all we get are derisive and stupid stereotypes in our TV shows and movies about how ""women never wanna have sex,"" like it's all some big joke.   That's problematic, yes, but it's problematic for rather a different reason.   It seems to me that one in six women would really, really like it if sex didn't have to be assumed as the central and defining component of all life-partnership relations.   Or, more likely, some number of these women are asexual but, like the general population, the majority of women with vulvodynia are allosexuals."

If you have to fake it for your own safety then you need to get out of that situation through any means necessary as quickly as possible.   Do I break up with her so she has a chance at finding someone who fulfills everything for her?   Definitely a possibility and not something to rule out, since sexual incompatibility is still real incompatibility.

I mean, what is ""unwanted sex""? What does it say about a relationship if you agree to have sex with someone just because you are afraid of losing them otherwise? That what it often boils down to. It's very unhealthy imo. I know some asexuals say it's ok with them, but you stated quite clearly that you are not one of them.   I'd always say the non-asexual person should be the one to ""suck it up"" for a change. They're not kept from masturbating, and as long as non-sexual intimacy is a regular thing, that should be an adequate ""compromise"".  It's just... why is that we (hopefully) all agree ""no means no"", but it's only in ace/non-ace relationships that no should really mean ""now and then""?

And that is why I don't think asexuals can have healthy relationships with non-asexuals (unless they are ok with no sex for other reasons) and shouldn't even pursue them.   Healthy relationships have compromise.   NOT when it comes to sex. Like, vulnerable young ace people read this! And then they read the same advice they have everywhere: Have sex. You need to have sex to have a healthy relationship. That is healthy, even if you don't want it (and most aces DON'T want it).    No one is encouraging rape here   sometimes they should have sex.    Then what is this!?  Yeah, I'm emotional rn, god damn, I just feel protective over every asexual you tell they need to have sex! No, they do not. And having unwanted sex just to keep their relationship will NOT make them happy in the end.

If someone wants to have sex to keep their relationship because it makes their relationship solid that's their business. They might value the relationship a lot more than they hate sex. Some people (like me) just find sex incredibly boring, and disgusting, but if I had to do it I could.  It's just incredibly selfish IMO to be in a relationship with a sexual person and not give them anything...asexuality is the thing that isn't normal in the relationship. With relationships there is an expectation that it will eventually turn sexual. That's part of the reason why humans seek out companions."

Not being able to satisfy someone's relationship needs doesn't make you bad. It makes you incompatible with that person. It could be sex, it could be religion, or kink or lifestyle or whatever. You're not bad.  You're frustrated (I believe) because you believe a sexual person should be obligated or compelled or whatever to remain with an asexual partner. That's not the case. If the sexual person can be content without sex, then the sexual person may stay in the relationship. But if he isn't or she isn't, the relationship is no longer fulfilling and should end. That prevents hurt feelings, coercion, regret, etc.    why I don't think asexuals can have healthy relationships with non-asexuals   You and I are agreed here.

Making pansexual a ""more specific"" label than bisexual (or at least this is what I read in different places).   The same applies to Grey-A, where it is valid for anything between sexual (allosexual) and asexual. Demisexual being a more specific type of grey-A.   Even the ""asexual"" term is some sort of umbrella term, where you may find more specific labels like ""autochoris asexual"", ""self sexual asexual"", ""asexual fetishist"", and so on... There is a frequent debate whether some of those should fall in the ace or grey-a category. But in this aspect I agree with you that the external, ""do you feel attracted to (real) people?"" should be imperative over the person actions.   However there are people who feel better explained by this Grey-Ace label, that to my understanding means ""attracted to other people only if certain criteria is met or/and at a lower frequency than sexual people""."

Anyway,    attracted to other people only if certain criteria is met or/and at a lower frequency than sexual people   would make sense if certain criteria were the same for all Gray-A.

I mean, for the self-sexual asexual, there are some who believe that ""pure asexual"" mean being completely uninterested in sexual acts in general (including masturbation). So there is this weird thing that happens with people who identify with this more narrow labels that are not sure if they are accepted by the community or not (as you might see happening around here quite a lot, in special regarding masturbation fantasies x doing the act).  That being said, it's not a label as heavy as ""asexual"", it's not something to use on daily basis, it's more of a sub-label than a full label, something almost as some sort of internal language or code that asexual people may identify with. This more specific label may be used to help themselves out and share their point of view, and still belong to this larger ""I don't feel attracted to others"" group.   I understand, it's weird to create names and labels for all varieties humans feelings and emotions can present, but to me it's something like calling musical subgenres by specific names, like power metal, love metal, progressive metal, death metal (the list goes on and on). Metal folks join the same general ""label/genre"", but they might create those subgenres/labels in order to better distinguish between themselves, without having to go the long road explaining why they like death related songs, or why they don't like this or that aspect in chord progression. They might just say I'm a metal fan to others, and ""I'm a death metal fan"" to other metal fans. (Just a silly example)   But again, grey-a would fall on the ""larger/broad"" category... How this is not a Fetish is something that I might be unable to answer, since ""how is sexual attraction itself"" not a fetish? People even argue about certain ""types"" they are attracted to... It's the kind of question that only people who identify as grey-a might answer properly, not me xD."
asexuality,33pqdt,Draymere-Iris,0,Fri Apr 24 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, narrow labels look weird at first sight, but they are useful to people in order to make them feel accepted in a certain group, or having something to describe what they feel/do.    While I don't generally like narrow labels, I agree and that's why I think it's okay to use highly specific labels in communities that know what you're talking about. Still, if you could identify with a larger group, why would you want to create a smaller one? No one in this discussion has told me why Gray-A people can't identify themselves with bigger groups. Each case of Gray-A I've read could identify with a bigger group. This would have two advantages:   More people to identify with! When you tell someone your orientation, they know what that actually means, unlick with ""Gray-A"", that doesn't have a defined meaning.     It's the kind of question that only people who identify as grey-a might answer properly, not me xD.   I thank you for your constructive attitude, unluckily those who identify as Gray-A haven't behaved the same, in this discussion. Perhaps some Gray-A will sooner or later read this question and answer us."

asexuality,33pqdt,meerikata,42,Sat Apr 25 08:34:15 2015 UTC,"Labels aren't there to be cans into which people are to be put, like they're supermarket grocery products.  They're just there to help people work out their own existences as guideposts.  If a label isn't helpful to you, don't use it.  If a label is helpful to someone, then it's worth having.  In any event, life is mostly not just black and white with binary placements in various things, but rather continuums, and sometimes it's nice for at least some people to have a shorthand way of stating that one isn't all the way at one end or the other.  EDIT:  in my opinion, the gray-asexual label has one relatively unique feature that is simultaneously an advantage and a disadvantage:  it is essentially defined by what you aren't rather than what you are.  It's kind of a nebulous category for people who don't feel they're fully asexual, don't feel that they're really sexual, and have, perhaps, considered and rejected the other possibilities you have suggested.  That makes for a lot of disagreement about what ""belongs"" there, and certainly not everyone is going to agree with my understanding of what the label covers.  But on the other hand, I personally believe that there is significant inherent value in having a space for people who don't feel that they have anywhere else to go."
asexuality,33pqdt,rhombic_pentameter,-1,Fri Apr 24 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like to state that I have no interest in going to people and telling them ""You shouldn't use this label!"" like it was a crime. I would never do this in real life, since it isn't my business. But this doesn't erase the fact that I think some labels just don't make sense. That's why I've written this post, because I thought of /r/asexuality as a place for discussion. Sorry if I've written this as a reply to your comment, bust most people here seem to have misunderstood me. If I read a post that I felt invalidated my asexuality, I would simply tell OP why they're wrong - like you did. What's the use of telling me ""You're rude!!"" again and again?  Anyway, I understand what you mean and, like I've written above, it's not like I want the people to stop using this label. If they like using it, okay - it isn't my business. But I don't think the label per se makes much sense. I understand it could be a place for people who don't feel like they belong anywhere. I understand this purpose and I wasn't arguing on it - it wasn't clear from my post, sorry. What I was actually saying is that the label's meaning doesn't make sense. If someone told me they were Gray-A, this wouldn't make me understand what they really like or don't. They would have to explain anyway. So I think yeah, perhaps some people do need this label to feel part of a group. But the label itself isn't defined, so I can't consider it an actual sexual orientation."
asexuality,33pqdt,perpetualsaltfish,6,Fri Apr 24 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I think your tone ruffled more feathers than anything else.  Keep in mind that any group of people who is not merely marginalized by the culture in which they find themselves but frequently told they don't really exist is probably not going to react too well to anyone who, y'know, implies, even inadvertently, that they don't really exist.  Perhaps you didn't mean it that way -- the only thing I would suggest is that in the future, trying to reframe the discussion as one of ""I don't understand why this term exists because as I understand it, the available range of possibilities under that umbrella already have discrete terms"" instead of ""I think this is improper and should not be.""  Keep in mind that in a purely text-based context, whatever tone of voice you imagined inside your head won't show up, but the tone of voice that your readers are used to being used against them will.  Am I understanding you correctly that the point you were trying to make is that you don't believe the term ""gray-asexual"" communicates useful information?  I don't entirely understand why you feel that way, but I am inferring from your post that you may be taking the AVEN ""Gray-A"" wiki page a little too literally; it provides examples to illustrate a broad concept, not an exhaustive definition.  The lexicon is more to the point, that it just means ""A person in the gray area between sexuality and asexuality.""  Given that there are asexual people who actually like sex and sexual people who actively don't, I guess I just don't understand why the given Gray-A definition is less communicative.  The labels, as I said, are there to help individuals work out their own interests.  In an interpersonal context, you're always going to have to make further inquiries to know what any specific person is or isn't into.  Also, I don't think ""orientation"" is a helpful thing for you to be concerned about in this context.  That seems, to me, as if that would be an attempt to force-map a linear continuum that doesn't really exist.  I think it's more multidimensional and touches on lots of other ways in which any given person can be interested or disinterested in particular kinds of other people.  Someone who is interested in only cuddling might still have a preference for boys or girls, or for particular body types, or for a preexisting emotional connection that overrides all physical considerations, or whathaveyou.  Just, y'know, by way of example.  You can decide for yourself whether you want to call ""Gray-A"" an ""orientation,"" but that doesn't much matter because it's more important to understand it as a descriptor.  Again, this is all just my personal opinion.  I'm no expert and certainly don't intend to give the impression that I am.  Heck, I don't even know as I know what I would call myself.  So don't take anything I say too seriously, either.  Nevertheless, does that help at all?"

Well as an asexual, I personally don't see the need for the various flavors of allosexuality so why not eliminate labels such as gay, straight, bi? That would work in my own little bubble, but the world is bigger than just me.  When you tell someone they are not gray-A, you are saying you know more about their sexuality than they do. Sexuality is a very personal thing, and GSMs often struggle for many years before coming to terms with their identities. For someone to be brave enough to come out of the closet just to be told they are wrong, well that can be very hurtful. Does this make any sense?  I don't pretend to understand all the different flavors of sexuality. However, it really doesn't bother me when people choose to label themselves a certain way.

This is not a black and white issue. I don't see why it needs to be treated as such.   A sexual orientation does not specify whether you want to have sex. Someone can call themselves allosexual even if they don't want to have sex. Or they can tell others they're asexual, so no one would expect from them the willingness to have sex.

If they don't like other labels, they're completely within their rights to call themselves something else or even make up a new label.   For example, if someone is technically bisexual but is more attracted to the same sex, they're perfectly allowed to identify as gay. There are lots of different reasons to do this - whether they identify more with the community or it just fits them better as a person, I can't say exactly. It's not about fitting in the exact description of a label as much as it is about identifying with something. You just can't tell someone else what they are."

The liar bit in particular was kind of insulting, speaking as an objective third party, and it seems like the discussion is only devolving at this point.   I can certainly say from personal experience that when other people label you it is not fun, whether or not you technically fit within a label's perimeters. I don't like being identified as ""retarded"", or a ""freak"", or ""crazy"", despite technically fitting within the definition of all those labels.

Demisexuals are people who only develop sexual attraction when they already have an emotional connection with them. Asexual people are people who do not experience sexual attraction. Grey-Asexuals do experience sexual attraction, and it is not dependent on a pre-existing connection.   Generally people who use the label to describe themselves are people who don't identify with the Asexual label because they experience sexual attraction, but don't identify as a Sexual person because although they do experience sexual attraction, it is very rare. Their sexual attraction is not dependent on their libido, so it is not merely a case of having a low libido. And they do not have an illness. They just fit somewhere in the grey area between Sexual and Asexual, and don't identify clearly as either label.  I think of it as being something similar to being gender neutral. They are neither one thing nor the other, and fall in a midground between the two that otherwise does not have a label.  If you don't need to use the label for yourself, that's fair enough.

Asexuality is actually the lack of sexual attraction towards other individuals. To me you don't sound asexual because you've felt sexual attraction towards your exes. However you could fall on the asexual spectrum. I'm puzzled by your sexual attraction's pattern, though. If you were demisexual you wouldn't feel more attracted after breaking up. Your sexual attraction would be related to the connection with your partners, and since you had not a strong connection with your ex-girlfriend you shouldn't have been attracted to her.if some demisexual could confirm this, it would be helpful!   What I'd suggest is to find the term that best explains your sexuality. People use labels because they help others understand quickly what they like. You don't need to fit 100% a label to use it, what matters is that it's useful to make others understand. You could also use a phrase, for instance, if that worked better."
asexuality,33kkm9,pizzaforce3,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:17:14 2015 UTC,"How 'outside' do you want the perspective to be?  I am old enough so that the identification of 'Ace' never even entered my thoughts until recently.  It just didn't even exist when I was young enough to question my sexuality.  I identified as gay, as I am attracted to the male physique, but never really either had a steady relationship, nor promiscuous behavior.  I just jerked it to porn, and had platonic friendships with both gay and straight men, and a few females.  This has been going on for a long time.  I always put my inability to have a decent, 'normal' relationship with another person as a lack of social skills, a lack of libido, emotional childishness, impotence due to residual health issues, anxiety, or poor judgement.  So it has come as a surprise to me to discover that there are other people out there like me, and there is a 'label' for my feelings besides 'loser.'  So I totally identify with the confusion you feel when you find yourself questioning your identity.  Asexuality is, to me, a rather mystifying trait.  Even if I don't have the desire to have sex often, or at all, doesn't that still lump me into some other category based on my preference for certain physical traits in the people I find physically attractive?  I honestly don't know, and 'maybe not' is a legitimate answer, it would seem.  Anyway, just commenting because my discovery is that confusion seems to be the normal state of affairs when it comes to human sexuality.  At least from my point of view.  So don't get anxious just because you haven't pigeonholed yourself into a 'category' yet, even 'Ace,' which to my old-fashioned thinking still translates in my head as 'null set.'

That confusion you describe clouded my head the whole time, but I saw it as a challenge that, if overcome, would let me get closer to my true identity. Now I can go through life with a lot more confidence in my relationship decisions, and it feels great.  To respond to some of your confusions, I also had to explain to myself my desire to appreciate human beauty. In the end, it's more like admiring a work of art than wanting to explore that art in a deeper manner. The only reason that doesn't require a category is that it doesn't govern human relations nearly as much as sexuality does. Having labels is just the most efficient way to let people know exactly what you're interested in (or lack thereof in the asexual case).  Keep movin' forward, life would be too easy and unsatisfying if the answers were always in front of you."

I think that she was good, but that if she was a more central character and if they had taken a few opportunities they passed up on it would have easily been miles better. I mean she was a normal person, weird in her own way like everyone else there, and everyone accepted her asexuality. But the main problem with the show was a much bigger issue in her representation than in any other in the show. And she was a romantic asexual, countering a lot of people that think there is no such thing. While there are several specific situations in which the scenario could have been changed very easily to tackle issues in a different way and actually going for the issues and instead they deflected to comedy, they did pretty good for a comedy show. Sure, had it been scrubs they wouldn't have shied away. But not everything can be scrubs. I have it from one of the actors that her story would get way better. Of course that was before they got canceled. But apparently at least at some point in the next season she would have gotten her own episode or two. Too bad."

asexuality,33etwh,H0ZE_H3AD,11,Tue Apr 21 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"Going off of what's already been said here, has she always been averse to kissing, cuddling, hugs, hand holding, things like that? Perhaps she thinks that if you do those things, it will lead to sex. You should talk to her and let her know that for you, those things don't have to be sexual.  It's also possible that she really is averse to those things and it will never change.  It's also possible she will NEVER have sex with you. You should talk to her about these things. Don't force her into having sex with you or guilt her about it. She told you up front that she was asexual. The no sex and no intimacy could've been with her before the depression.  If, after your talk, you find that she's not going to be comfortable with intimacy(hugs, cuddles, etc.) and sex, then you're going to have to break it off because it seems like those things are important to you."
asexuality,33etwh,seirianstar,4,Wed Apr 22 06:44:24 2015 UTC,"You seem to have a very good attitude towards this so the first thing I'd suggest is talking with her. Communication is important in a relationship, if you can communicate well you can solve even those problems that at first don't seem to have a solution.   That said, I think - and I know this is an unpopular opinion - that it isn't healthy to be so averse to physical contact with someone who's so close to you. I don't think this is related to her asexuality, even if she could think so. Asexuality is not being averse to physical contact, and when this aversion creates stress or problems in someone's life then I think it is an issue that has to be solved. I know this could sound offensive, so be cautious about how you tell her - if you agree with me, that is. Anyway I think it's good that she's seeing a therapist. If she realizes she has problems with this, she could ask them and hopefully get help.   Lastly, please consider that even if she solved her problems she wouldn't do a 180°. If you can't reach a compromise or if you can't feel happy in this relationship, I'd suggest to break up. But before it comes to this, try what I and the other people have suggested. Good luck!"
asexuality,33etwh,ver_sacrum,7,Wed Apr 22 10:40:24 2015 UTC,"If, for you as a person, sex is something that is pretty important (and I don't blame you, for the human race wouldn't really be here if it wasn't), then I suggest that you realize that, most likely, she will -never- want sex. She may -never- be comfortable in even kissing you. If you are absolutely okay with this, then I say go for it.  You don't have to force yourself to stay with someone. Yes, I see that you very much love the company of this girl, but ultimately what it will feel like for you is that a) as though you are in a long distance realationship due to lack of sexual release even though she's sitting right next to you b) feel like she's simply a friend  If you feel as though her depression and her asexuality isn't going to do much for you in the way of social interaction as you'd expect form an allosexual girlfriend, then you should probably break things off.  But if you're okay with it, then her depression, and in turn your depression, is just another ""bump"" in a relationship. Any relationship has bumps, may it be work, school, distance, whatever. If you want it to work, you can, but please be respectful of her sexuality, or lack thereof."
asexuality,33etwh,iMoosker,5,Wed Apr 22 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"While I fully agree with this, I think it's good to also point out that it isn't uncommon for asexual people to equate any sort of intimacy with sex (mostly because we assume that if we do that, our allosexual partners will assume we're leading them on and will be even more disappointed when we don't want to have sex).  If that were the case, having an honest discussion about it, to ease any fears or answer questions, could help a lot. It could even make it so that even though they don't have sex, they still can be closer than just friends."
asexuality,33etwh,nobile,2,Wed Apr 22 05:38:55 2015 UTC,"Also,  if she's on antidepressants,  they sometimes have a side effect of loss of interest in Sex"
asexuality,33etwh,_Mel,2,Wed Apr 22 07:25:52 2015 UTC,"Asexuality aside, that she suffers too much anxiety to touch you after 6 months would indicate that she is perhaps not in a place where she can really have the kind of relationship that she wants, let alone the kind that you want, and really does need to focus on some form of therapy in addition to medication rather than having a boyfriend.  Many universities offer something along those lines to their students, so you should recommend she look into those or look into the subject so you can tell her what she needs to do and who she needs to call in order to get in touch with her options on that front.  There is some possibility that she does not want any form of physical contact and/or intimacy and either hasn't fully processed this herself or doesn't feel comfortable saying so to you at this point in time.   I really hate myself for not being able to get over my sexuality so we can both just be happy together.   You're allosexual.  There's nothing to ""get over"" on that front anymore than there's anything that as an asexual woman, she has to ""get over"" before she can experience sexual attraction.  It just means that you're less compatible with a person on the asexuality spectrum from the getgo, at least on paper.  Even then, the interpersonal disconnect between you may be related in some ways to her asexuality and/or her perception of your sexuality and the way each of you would view and process various forms of intimacy, but it's an issue all of itself rather than just being a subset of being part of a mixed allosexual-asexual relationship  Being ""perfect"" in every other way and there being a glaring disconnect in terms of emotional/romantic intimacy, physical/emotional/romantic affection, and the sexuality of both of you is not perfect and any single one of those forms of incompatibility are legitimate reasons for couples to go their separate ways if they can't engage with one another to come to a point where both partners can live with some form of resolution or compromise.  So don't rule out breaking up, and definitely get to the point where you can talk to her and figure out what you can about her stance on and approach to emotional intimacy and affection.    Especially since the state of this relationship and interpersonal dynamic is causing your emotional health to deteriorate at this rate.  A relationship with a person with chronic (or even non-chronic) depression who is getting treatment should not cause you suffer from depression as well.   tl;dr: I am completely in love with my girlfriend but she is asexual and it has started to affect me alot   This is so much more than asexuality and touches upon mental illness and a lack of non-sexual forms of intimacy and interaction."
asexuality,33etwh,nirenem,2,Thu Apr 23 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"Have you asked her about her prior relationship? If she was feeling obliged to have sex in that relationship, it could definitely contribute to her feeling scared of intimacy in this one.

I had sex quite a bit with my ex (he was really obsessed with it) and I did enjoy it, but I don't really feel the need to have it again.

And it sounds to me like you're not really that into the relationship, and that can have an effect on sex drive as well.  I know this is probably hard to hear, but it's not really fair that you're only with this girl just to have a friend. You need to be honest with her. She might want to stay friends, she might not. Just be gentle. Say that you've been dealing with depression and you just want a friend. You might consider talking with a counselor or therapist. I would start with the depression first, as that can affect every single part of your life. It's a bumpy ride, but I think it would really help."

asexuality,337q1o,CreativeWriterNSpace,4,Mon Apr 20 08:33:15 2015 UTC,"You can totally be attracted to people and be ace! I'm calling ""attracted"" the feeling you get when you see someone really aesthetically pleasing, like you said. I'm certainly not an expert, but I think you can also want physical closeness and still be ace. I've never looked at another human being and felt the tingles in my giblets. Not once. And though I did have sex quite a bit with my ex and I did enjoy it, I'm just not that into it. I could go a year without sex and not feel bad about myself or my life choices. I think the main thing you should get out of this revelation is that sexuality is a fluid, changing, undefinable thing, and you are the only one that can define it for yourself. If you don't want to label yourself ace/grey, that's totally okay!"
asexuality,337q1o,intergalactic-poyo,3,Tue Apr 21 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"I am the same way. For me I am aesthetically attracted to people but not sexually attracted to people. I realized I was asexual(ace) when I was 20. On meetup.com there are meetup groups for asexuals in many towns including mine, which I attend the meetups. Also another good source is AVEN. It has a lot of info about asexuality."
asexuality,337q1o,Musichead2468,3,Tue Apr 21 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it helps, but I'm just going to post a bit about how my own attraction works. Physical intimacy is not necessarily sexual, but most people like to pretend it is (or that there is something wrong with us if we don't want our intimacy to become sexual). I get attracted to people, but it's never accompanied by a desire to do anything sexual with them. I get butterflies, but nothing more. I even like naked cuddling (as long as it isn't with men, for reasons), which is imo not sexual, as the naked body is not inherently sexual. I like the naked form of people, mostly women, and I feel amused disgust only towards male genitalia. Still ace as fuck (or rather... non-fuck?), biromantic most likely, leaning more towards women though."
asexuality,336tj7,AceofBrokenHearts,13,Mon Apr 20 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"someone who has never ever been attracted to or aroused by a person?   That is the very definition of an asexual! No sexual attraction to others, not necessarily no desire for pleasure from sex."

I must admit I find this interesting since I'd always associated stomach butterflies with the romantic axis rather than the sexual one."
asexuality,336tj7,MarshmallowAisu,3,Mon Apr 20 07:57:01 2015 UTC,"Well, no there isn't a term besides asexual. If you don't like calling yourself asexual then you can just make up your own term. It really doesn't matter what you call yourself, as long as you're comfortable with it :)"

asexuality,336tj7,HelpSeekingEarthworm,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:16:53 2015 UTC,I think Demisexual would be the term. It's when you don't experience sexual attraction until you have an emotional connection with a person.

asexuality,333hpx,SADOCDACE,12,Sun Apr 19 04:10:50 2015 UTC,"To most people, Romantic connections and bonds can grow to be on par with that of parental bonds. Think of the love/connection you feel to your mother, father or siblings, (this comparison will only work if you like your family, sorry) and imagine one of them telling you ""you aren't the child I want, I don't like you, we don't work as a family, you need to leave"" it would be incredibly upsetting and really shake your sense of belonging.  This is the only real comparison I can make for what it feels like to break up with a close romantic partner.  Do you ever look back on those old friendships that you drifted away from and feel a strong sense of nostalgia for all the good times you shared? Romantic connections are very similar, often there is a combination of platonic and romantic feelings so it can sometimes be overwhelming.  It doesn't sound like this is an asexuality and aromantic issue, This sounds like a lack of empathy, possibly due to not understanding, and that's fine, Keep asking questions, keep learning. that's how you stop this from happening.  also, drifting apart is very different from breaking up. Drifting apart is natural and often unfelt, But breaking up is a conscious choice when one or more of you may still have strong feelings that haven't played out yet, and you are deprived of your chance to let those feelings play out, which is often what causes break ups to be such a big deal, You have all these emotions that you had been ready to invest into the relationship, now you don't have a relationship but you still have all these emotions with no outlet, so you feel weighed down by them and hurt by the weight.  It's fine to not understand, and it's fine not to want to understand. But do the mature thing, tell your friends that you know they feel strongly, but you can't truly empathise, and you think they should talk with another friend who can because it will be better for them and less confronting for you."

I left my story on the main thread as an Ace survivor and how I fucked up in attempting to find peace after my assault. In this thread, I just want to say, That you were horribly mistreated in that TwoX thread and I am ashamed that so many people dismissed your opinion and beliefs on sex in the name of sex-positivity. That is not what the movement is about, and It disgusts me that you were presented with that side of it (every group has their extremists, sadly) and then on top of that, when you pointed out that you had been exposed to this treatment, more commenter's went on to deny ""but sex positivity is still good, even if it made you feel bad"" Urgh!  OP, I want you to know that being sex-positive is all about finding ways to be be proud of your sexuality and your sex life. It's about comfort and a lack of shaming, from yourself and from others.  The way you were treated in that thread is a poor representation of sex positivity, and the way you are being treated in your life in an attempt to find support after your assault is also a poor example of sex positivity.  Sex is a spiritual experience and it does bond people, It's up to individuals to decide to what degree, and for you that is a huge degree, with the added connection of embarking on a journey to conceive together. That is true and healthy  sex positive thinking! to look at sex in such a beautiful and intimate light and to realise that If you wanted sex, you could have sex, as long as it was deep and meaningful and you were ready/wanting of a family, sex would not bring any shame to you because you know what your true opinion on sex is.  I wish deeply that you can find some better, more Ace friendly resources on surviving rape and recovering from sexual trauma. I had a hard time because I was injured and my doctors all kept talking to me about ""recovering so you can have sex again"" and I felt so completely misunderstood and unaccepted.  But you are understood, and you are accepted, and the fact that you can hold onto these beliefs about sex when not only have you been through a traumatic experience, people are now trying to overwrite those beliefs, But you haven't let them, You are a strong person! hold onto your values regarding sex because they are your values, and no one can take them away from you, no matter what has happened to your body."

Maybe not as often or to the scale that they do after puberty, but it's definitely a thing.  Source: Various places across Reddit and the Internet in general, so make of that what you will."
asexuality,330ex9,21stPilot,6,Sat Apr 18 17:34:00 2015 UTC,"There are pre-sexual children who experience what they'll later identify as sexual attraction or the beginnings of their feelings of sexual attraction, and, IIRC, presexual or pre-sexual is the preferred term for referring to children for clarity of communication.  Sort of hard to give a definitive answer given the subject matter even if there were a lot of science being done WRT to childrens' sexuality, so there's a big question mark when it comes to situations like identifying a 5 year old who'll grow up to be an alloromantic gay man and telling him apart from a 5 year old who'll grow up to be a homoromantic asexual man when they both like other boys."
asexuality,330ex9,Disarray_,7,Sat Apr 18 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"I believe that some children do experience sexual attraction, though it's more-or-less a case of lack of terms and awareness, unable to give a name to the feeling until being of a certain age or receiving education on the matter.  The biggest mistake society tends to make regarding sexuality is that it is something that tends to occur at later stages of the life course, typically during puberty. The reason for that is our understanding of sexuality is somewhat skewed and narrowly focused, and many people tend to take specific characteristics of sexual development and apply it across the life course.   Similarly, adult asexuality comes after being able to understand sexuality and having developed through puberty without acquiring the sexual feelings most people do, but it's not the same as having failed to pass a certain aspect of puberty as if it were disordered. Like atheism in infants, sexuality is neither understood nor possible to be felt at that age; a person's mental and physical faculties haven't nearly reached the point of it being possible to call a person sexual or asexual in infancy. If we understand asexuality as we understand sexuality, both are somewhat different from the lack of sexuality that infants and small children have.  It's a little like looking at a block of wood prior to its becoming pulp for paper and asking which book it is."
asexuality,330ex9,ExtraWingyScapula,3,Sat Apr 18 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's actually quite a good question.  By definition then yes, I guess most children are inherently asexual. Although I believe the difference lies in people don't tend to inherently identify themselves as asexual, and the same goes for other sexualities (Or lack there of).  I think the model of assuming people are born straight by default and then branching out to other labels makes sense, I think it all comes down to identity in that aspect. If a child wishes to identify themselves as asexuality then by all means that be the case (Transgender children have been on a huge rise), however I also think that if they don't come to recognise that about themselves then I guess you could just go for the default again.  Interesting idea though, would love to see some discussion on it."

I've gone through many similar experiences, where I figured because of my fantasies and tendencies that I was gay, then straight, then asexual, then aromatic to demisexual to homoromantic to asexual again... I think you're probably just experiencing sexual fluidity, like a lot of people do. It's complicated, and some people might not understand it, but there are lots of videos and articles on the internet on the topic for you to take advantage of."

Especially in matters of sexuality.  Two, desensitized to sex?  I take it you are sex repulsed?  And her theory is that your anxiety stems from a lack of sexual release?  What is her justification for this theory?"
asexuality,32vuk9,redneckgymrat,8,Fri Apr 17 04:18:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah I personally find having sex to be disgusting. From what I can piece together, I think her theory is that I have somehow made myself afraid of sex. At first she suggested that I find myself so unattractive that I do not believe it would be possible to find a sexual partner (we have never discussed body image issues before, so this was kind of jarring). I told her I have had sex, but do not enjoy it or desire it. She then said that maybe I have not found the right person and am afraid to keep trying."
asexuality,32vuk9,jadefirefly,15,Fri Apr 17 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"I spent several weeks, after even discovering asexuality was a thing, asking myself if I wasn't just mixing this up with my low self esteem and was really just repressing my natural, sexual self.   After a while of this, I eventually threw my hands up and said, fuck it. If that's the case, the only one harmed by it is me; either way I'm happier, more comfortable with myself, and no longer obligated to behave like I'm part of the group when people talk about great sex or hot people.   I've had sex. I've had terrific sex, and really bad sex, and at the end of the day, none of it meant I had to feel sexual attraction. It just proves that my business works properly when I want it to.   If you're seeing your therapist because of self esteem or prior abuse issues (and please understand I'm not asking for details) I can understand, a little, why they might think those things. They're putting this news into the context of other conversations. If you're not, though... I don't really understand why it was necessary to tell you why you think something, instead of asking why you think something. That doesn't sound especially therapeutic."

asexuality,32vuk9,redneckgymrat,7,Fri Apr 17 05:45:37 2015 UTC,"People are still just people, at the end of the day. Normally a counselor or therapist is expected to be more open minded than the norm, but you're still going to find ones here and there that bring their personal opinions into their work.   Next time you see her, consider pointing out that her invalidating your self-image is hurtful, especially since what you told her isn't a negative thing. There's no requirement to love sex in order to be mentally healthy."

Asexuality is extremely unusual in the general population.  I can see, if she learned it was a disorder in school and has had no first hand experience with real asexuals, why she could react the way she did.  Textbooks, until recently, identified asexuality as a disorder, a sickness.  And, in complete fairness a form of pseudo asexuality IS a byproduct of some disorders, so the question is at least worth asking.  Doesn't forgive it or even make it more palatable, but it could explain her rationale."

If your being sex repulsed was linked to some issue, you could still be considered asexual for your lack of sexual attraction to others. Being sex repulsed may be linked to asexuality, but it is not a requisite."

Honestly I would just find a different therapist you can work with better. It's perfectly normal to shop around until you find a good fit. Try to find one who is LGBTA-friendly -- they usually advertise as such.  When I told my therapist I was asexual, she just said ""oh"" and moved on. It was a good thing to come out to her, because then she knew that I wasn't interested in the sex issues that most of her patients had. It gave us time to talk about more important things. If coming out to your therapist makes you feel bad, you're not the one with the problem."

Unfortunate, but true."

Honestly I don't understand this fascination so many allosexuals have, whether they're therapists or not, that something is wrong if someone doesn't have sexual desire? It doesn't hurt anything to not experience sexual attraction, even if one is repulsed. I really can't comprehend why it should be such an earth shattering thing.  I'm sorry your therapist is like this. It's really unfortunate. I honestly don't have anything to say that could possibly help, just know that I'm frustrated for you."

Asexuality is outside the norm.  She would be acting irresponsibly if she didn't at least consider it as a potential symptom."

Absolutely.  Any change, and by extension any state sufficiently outside the mainstream, should be viewed with suspicion...diagnostically.  Political correctness, and even our own desire for general acceptance, should not affect diagnostic investigation.  Is asexuality real?  Absolutely.  In this situation, diagnostically, should it be accepted without so much as a few questions?  No."
asexuality,32vuk9,ZeroDagger,2,Fri Apr 17 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"If an allosexual suddenly woke up ""asexual"", yes that should certainly be examined. The real issue is people who are born ace. Is that pathological? Why do they need to ""prove"" they are really ace by exhausting all other possible explanations? Why don't we also require this of homosexuals and trans* people?"
asexuality,32vuk9,narrativedilettante,2,Fri Apr 17 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"Perhaps because we are so rare, so unusual, and so out of the mainstream?  Or, perhaps, because our sexuality is so easily reproduced in so many ways, including chemically?   I don't have the numbers, and I have no idea if anyone has ever studied it, but I would wonder if asexuality as a side effect is more or less common than asexuality as a natural orientation?  Might be interesting to find out.  Oh, and by the way, one of my dearest friends from college was M2F trans.  Part of the process for her WAS in depth psychological examination and analysis.  So, technically, she did have to prove it before undergoing reassignment surgery."
asexuality,32vuk9,EarnedSecurity,0,Fri Apr 17 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"The CDC estimates1 in 6  boys and 1 in 4 girls have been sexually abused by the time they are 18. 18% of all women over 18 have been raped. Meanwhile, the percentage of people who identify as ace is 1%? 2%?   Disgust is a symptom of sexual abuse. It is clinically appropriate to ask if the person has been sexually abused or assaulted if that symptom is seen. It is also very common for people to deny being sexually abused or assaulted due to shame, willingness to excuse another person’s terrible behavior, or other reasons. In other words, it is statistically more likely that a woman talking about being disgusted by sex was raped or abused than that woman being asexual.  Please don’t be offended that the person is doing her job appropriately.  There are absolutely people who were born ace and have never been assaulted. So what would you prefer: a doctor not ask questions because she is afraid of offending you or a doctor ask questions to find and help a victim of sexual assault?  Edit: Diagnoses are made by eliminating other causes. That's why you look for a differential diagnosis. Not asking enough questions means you can miss important info and cause lasting harm. If a woman comes in with stomach pain, terrible nausea, and vomiting, it's appropriate to ask her if she could be pregnant. It doesn't matter if she's a lesbian or ace or whatever. This could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy, which can be fatal. Assuming it's just ""food poisoning"" so you don't have to ask about someone's sex life can actually kill the patient."

Are the gay and trans patients also assumed abuse victims until proven otherwise? Maybe as a little girl the lesbian was molested by her father. Or the MtF is only acting on repressed homosexual urges. Why not exhaust all possible options before allowing someone to adopt a transgressive identity?   Disgust is a symptom of sexual abuse.

Read this article and see if you think it applies to you.   There is soooo much variation in what asexuals experience so if that doesn't seem like  a good label for you, check out these and see what you think.   I myself am a bi-romantic ace.

Which makes it most efficient for me to identify on the asexual sectrum, even if I'm technically able to experience attraction occasionally, because the instances of it are so rare that 90% of the time, I'm living the asexy life with all the challenges that presents. :)  Edit: also I just woke up so I might not be making much sense, sorry!"

As far as sex goes, asexual a can still have libidos, and experience arousal, and like sex. Like, all the stuff to have and enjoy it is still there and fully functioning.

You can recognize that he is attractive, that others might find him sexually appealing, etc...but you have no desire to act on it?  That's how she feels...towards everybody.  Her parts all work.

She might like one better for the cut, the length, the neckline, the fabric... You can see her point. All those things factored into your decision as well. The color was a major bonus for you, but if it hadn't passed all those secondary things, you would have put it back even if it had been the right color. There are many ways to pick a favorite dress. It's not all about color.  That's kind of how it is being asexual. She can't see 'sexy,' but she can see your kindness, your generosity, your hygiene, your hobbies...

You should still be experiencing puberty.  In fact it's even possible that you haven't entered puberty yet, though that would be unlikely.

Though only you can decide whether you experience sexual attraction, and what your orientation is, plenty of people like to assert things as true when they don't really know anything about the subject at hand. Still, you can test your hormone levels, if you feel at all worried about the possibility."
asexuality,32lxd8,dragonzflyte,5,Wed Apr 15 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"19 year old male here. While low tesrosterone can cause low libido, it is often a misconception that Asexuality is caused by low hormones. While asexuals can have low hormone counts, most have average hormonal levels. As for me I have a PLENTIFUL amount of  testosterone coursing through my system, the hormones don't change my sexual orientation though. On a side note, gay men are obviously capable of having high testosterone too. Testosterone does not change who you're 'hard-wired' to feel attraction to."
asexuality,32lxd8,mundabit,3,Wed Apr 15 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"Hormones can effect your sex drive and libido, that is, your ability experience arousal and horniness both as a response to appropriate stimuli and spontaneously. (eg: nocturnal erections) Other symptoms of low testosterone include hair loss, weight gain, depression, fatigue and muscle wasting. If you have these symptoms, combined with a lack of nocturnal erections, then you should get your testosterone levels looked at.  Medication, Mood disorders and Physcal stress can also effect Libido and sex drive.  But Libido is separate from attraction and orientation, which can not be changed by any external or somatic force. You are what you are when it comes to what you like.  My hormones were out of whack, I was put on hormone therapy several years ago to manage it and as a result I had an increase in my sex drive, but it had no effect on my sexual orientation, because the two are unrelated. If that were the case, Lesbian women could be given oestrogen to make them like men, and gay men could be given testosterone to make them like women. You can't change your sexual orientation with hormones, therefore, your orientation is not a result of hormones."
asexuality,32lxd8,dragon-storyteller,2,Thu Apr 16 05:17:42 2015 UTC,"Hormones can affect sexual attraction and libido, but are far from being the only factor influencing them. Most asexuals have normal hormone levels, and aces who don't are usually no less asexual after they get it fixed - at most, they gain a libido they don't know what to do with. It differs from case to case, but if you are asexual, chances are it's not because of hormones.  Redneckgymrat also has a good point, at 15 years old you are still developing rapidly.

I am more disgusted by female genitalia, but I prefer it's closed in unlike the male one that pokes you....yuck. If I had to touch one though, it would be a penis for sure. But I can usually find a female aesthetically attractive where as males, it's harder. I have a really hard time identifying what's considered attractive for males, where as females I have a better idea. I thought I was bisexual for this in my younger years. I really have no desire to be romantically involved with someone, though I have been in the past for very short periods. I found I did better with a female.  3) I didn't think about my asexuality much and didn't hunt for a reason as to why I am the way I am. It kind of just came to me while on the internet. All my life I had struggles just fitting in with other girls I guess. In elementary school, a lot of girls liked boys already. There were the rumors of all these individuals having crushes. I didn't feel the same way, so I would often pick the guy everyone had a crush on and say I had a crush on him too. I pretended to have crushes throughout high school, to my friends. My sexuality all in all hasn't caused me much stress in life, and I'm happy to say that.  4) When people think we've been sexually abused.

asexuality,32lfrb,maz_lotus,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"How/when did you know?   I always knew I wasn't straight or normal. I knew for certain that I was on the asexual spectrum when I was 19 when I discovered the AVEN wiki and spoke to a few other asexuals and talked to my allosexual friends.  When I was 20 I told my husband (Got married young, long story) and we spent a few years working through it and talking about how that would effect us.  When I was 22 I felt what I think is secondary sexual attraction toward my friend of 5 years, I have intrusive sexual thoughts about him, like wondering what his orgasm face looks like or wanting to hear him moan. But I still have no desire to actually have sex with him or anyone else. So I consider myself Grey-A.   How do you feel to the different sexes? (romantically and sexually)   I don't feel anything sexual toward either sex, I am more aesthetically attracted to women, but I tend to experience primary romantic attraction with men, though I have been/have the capacity to be romantically attracted to all genders. I feel warm and fuzzy around certain people, and as mentioned above, there is that one guy, but I don't feel any desires to have sex.   What first made you think that you're asexual?   When my friends were all going on about Johnny Depp or James Masters or whoever was the hot celebrity of the time and I couldn't care less. I thought I was a lesbian but I couldn't relate to all my guy friends going on about Haley Williams or whoever either, So I figured I was a late bloomer. I found myself romantically attracted to many characters in books  and later had a huge intellectual crush on a documentary host and I remember saying ""I love his energy"" and a friend said ""yeah, I guess he's kind of cute"" and I just remember thinking my friend missed the point entirely.   Anything else people should know/get wrong when talking about asexuality?   The number of people who take asexuality as a challenge is abhorrent.  I can and do enjoy the act of sex when I can be motivated to have it, Orgasms feel good because all my plumbing still works (well, some times, I have health issues)   Likewise, not all asexuals are celibate, It doesn't automaticaly stop you from being asexual just because you have sex, there are tons of reasons to have sex.  I think it also needs to be noted that sex drive and sexual attraction are separate. I have a high libido, I get horny  (usually because i'm ovulating) and masturbate, But I'm still not attracted to anyone sexually (except that one guy) and I still don't want actual sex. Just because you have no sex drive doesn't automaticaly make you asexual, and just because you have a sex drive doesn't mean your not asexual.  and Sexual opinion is important to mention too, Some asexual are repulsed by all sex, others are ok with sex that they're not having. Allosexuals are the same, Some people think sex is great, others think its gross, that's not an asexual trait, that's a human trait.  It's important to design a dynamic and 3 dimensional character who is a complete human being with emotions, morals values and beliefs founded on a range of nature and nurture foundations. Don't let all their quirks and mannerisms be a result of their sexuality."

I don't imagine them naked or anything. I just think they're nice looking. That's pretty much it.  One misconception is that asexuals do not have sex, which isn't true. Some are sex-repulsed which is pretty self-explanatory. Some are sex-neutral which means they are open to the action of having sex for personal pleasure. Asexuals, if they have sex, are more interested in the event than with who it is exactly."
asexuality,32lfrb,ararioayo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"I was about 15-16 years old (now I am 24), I've read about it on an internet forum and/or in some wise book. I am attracted to men (I am a girl myself), but do not dream about sex with them.  I did not understand why people in real life and in movies sometimes cannot handle themselves and have sex, though they do not use any birth control. And I did not get why is sex so important for people, and why are many of them ashamed of being virgin...  Then I read some text about asexuality, and thought 'Wow, that's me.'' Many people think asexuals are happy, because they cannot get into love and relationship problems, so they think they do not know what is a breakup or unrequited love. That's not true, except some of them. I myself do not need a boyfriend, but it does not mean I cannot love a man."
asexuality,32mxmf,SADOCDACE,11,Wed Apr 15 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're trolling or not. Defining one's sexuality is up to each individual. If those people that  your friends and relatives know are asexual, NO ONE has the right to say ace identifying people are using asexuality as an excuse for ANYTHING. Has anyone ever said to you or them,"" She/He's just using his heterosexuality as an excuse for [insert something here]""? It's nonsense.  Besides, attractiveness is subjective. Many people find Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Kate Moss beautiful but I personally find them to be nonaesthetically pleasing.  I know some aces who are actually very, VERY gorgeous. Being conventionally attractive or not has nothing to do with sexual preference and attraction or lack thereof. One of them lived a pretty happy childhood. I can't speak to the other person's childhood.  Here is something you need to read. Check out this list, especially the most recent people added so that you can get an idea of how varied the professions and backgrounds of aces can be. Aces can be people of color(the ones I know are), men, women, agender, androgynous, trans, bi, straight, rockers, into crochet, dancers, writers, politicians, all kinds of wonderful human beings.  You also need to read every last one of these."
asexuality,32mxmf,seirianstar,4,Wed Apr 15 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"Sexual issues, and by extension pseudo-asexuality, is a common side effect of all sorts of problems including psychological ones, and even some medications.  I'm not going to deny that.  But there is an enormous difference between having your existing sex drive switched off by a new medication, and never having had one in the first place.  I am 44 and male, a moderately good looking man, and an aromantic asexual.  I have, and have never had, any desire to have sex or pair up with anybody.  I assumed I was a late bloomer for much of my life, but by my age I'd be setting a world record.  I am otherwise well adjusted, am successful enough, and am perfectly happy.    My answer about my childhood may be unique.  In fact, while growing up my next door neighbor was a published developmental psychotherapist and I have been told that I was mentioned several times in her books.  I am literally the textbook example of normality.  How's that for a perfect answer?  The only thing ""wrong"" with me is that I don't fit someone else's cookie cutter mold.  And I'm okay with that.  If anything, I view it as a positive.  As for the bit about ugliness...is that a determinant?  Quasimodo.  The Phantom of the Opera.  Beauty and the Beast.  Cyrano deBergerac.  We have countless examples of ugly characters who long for sexual intimacy with a partner.  Ugliness is not causally linked to asexualit."
asexuality,32mxmf,redneckgymrat,4,Wed Apr 15 04:35:25 2015 UTC,"I had a completely normal childhood. My parents are both ""just wait til college and then you can let it go"" kind of people who are not judgy, abusive, religious, anything. However, being asexual definitely messed up my development. I didn't even know how sex worked until last year. From reddit--not even because I looked it up. I literally did not know about ""there"" until I had to put a tampon in. (For the record I despise tampons...) also, alas, I realized I was not gifted by the abstinence fairy. Merely unattracted and without a libido. I think I've actually gotten less interested and more repulsed by sex as I got older. I'm a teenager right now. Kind of backwards, huh. I also do think asexuality induces a degree of antisocial/shyness in people. I'm really shy about dating, touching people, and while everyone would mark me down as an excited happy person I'm pretty deeply introverted and don't like having to interact with a lot of people. But I think it's more like being born considered ""weird"" does that a little. Just feeling that there's something a little off but never quite sure until later.      Of course because there are so few asexuals they would let a couple they knew act as confirmation bias. However, I don't see why what they're saying even matters and if they're trying to say ""people are asexual because they are ugly"" then that's a really douchey thing to say honestly _ maybe it's because asexual people don't often doll or smooth themselves out to impress potential partners, etc? While usually I have horrible self-image today I feel really good and would say that I'm not ugly, of course not ""sexy"", but maybe cute even it's in an odd sort of way. I've asked a handful of people who I really trusted to say what they actually thought of how I looked without trying not to hurt my feelings and they told me they thought I was pretty (still not 100% sure if they weren't just trying to be nice.) But I don't think that you really need to prove their point because honestly that sounds pretty shallow... If being asexual isn't being gay? Having a kink, or whatever? There's nothing that can prove where asexuality stems from exactly and so no medication. If it's genetic, sure you can call it a disorder affecting mental health passed genetically but while there's not a lot of us as a percentage or in one area there's more than a few asexuals and we asexuals are very different and it doesn't seem to run in families very clearly, however it definitely is not something that happens. People who are asexual have experiences relatable to other LBGT people. And if, like me, you've read about being sexual and thought that being ace sounds like a pretty good deal sometimes I don't see why it's bad. In fact it seems like a pretty good deal sometimes. If I'm taking a long shower, I'm taking a long shower. Someone attractive trying to get their way? haha nope!.      I wouldn't take what people say to heart about being asexual too much, one of the harder parts is not even being able to relate to sexuality (although I do think gay people have it tougher from a young age) but being the ""clear"" invisible sexuality and hearing the BS people spew about being asexual. One of my friends thinks it's hilarious right now to call me ""Mrs. A"" and when I call her weird as a joke she say: ""but you're A freak."" Of course people don't understand a lot about what comes with being asexual and it's hard to explain exact things without using a lot of obscure terms and/or Tumbrlisms (not fond of them personally). I find this link to be quite relevant to play in my head when I hear things like ""asexuals are unattractive"". https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c Keep being you and don't get down about who you are! (If only I could follow my own advice sometimes, however...)"

asexuality,32mxmf,jellointhefridge,2,Wed Apr 15 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"Average looks, average childhood. I had friends, we played video games and ran around outside. My brother was a little twerp, and continues to be a little twerp, despite his claims that he is now the ""bigger"" sibling. I have a dog that I've been responsible for since I was ten, and she's turned out alright too. I like people, and I'm not super shy. Yes I am slightly reserved, but that's laziness as much as anything else- and shyness is not a personality flaw. It's just part of who you are.  That's not to say that I don't have issues. I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was 6, but early help meant that I read perfectly well today. I do have mild depression, but that didn't kick in until I was about seventeen, for fairly normal reasons. It was jumpstarted by my brother's car accident, grandma's death and other grandma's cancer diagnosis, but seventeen is right within average range for depression. It caused me to drop out of high school for a while, but I'm now much better and going to university in the fall for mathematics. But then, my one friend had a chemistry project blow up in his face and was also delayed in graduating from high school.  The thing is, my issues are normal, not linked to my asexuality. When me and my friends were little, I just never had any interest in kissing, or sex. I've always been this way, and that's perfectly fine. Just figuring things out now is perfectly fine too. If you see lots of people online who seem to confirm your family's bias, that could be positive bias(possibly the wrong name, but I can't remember the right one.), where you notice those cases which fit your expectations. It could be where you look on the internet. It could be for any number of reasons which don't start and end with asexuality as a disorder. If it will help, there are several resources which can help you to understand asexuality, on reddit and other sites, such as AVEN and tumblr. There are several links to such resources in the sidebar. I'll list more tomorrow, I'm tired now. Hopefully others can help to address your concerns and assure you that we're not all scared children or axe murderers or anything similar (not that there's anything wrong with children- just axe murderers)."
asexuality,32mxmf,dragonzflyte,2,Wed Apr 15 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"It is a common psychological mistake to generalize basing on a few examples, or even on only one - in this case, yourself. To tell what you are saying research is needed. Common sense is often wrong.  That said, asexual people represent a minority, and I wouldn't be surprised if they had a higher chance of developing social problems than """"""normal"""""" people. Those who don't fit in are usually marginalized, and social rejection doesn't do people any good. This goes for all GSM, though.   What I actually think about the link between asexuality and poor mental health is that some people may identify as asexual because of issues regarding sex and sexual practicies. Random example: an MTF person doesn't like the idea of having sex with someone and has a very low libido. After she transitions, though, she finds  herself wanting sex with people and such. She discovers she was repulsed by sex because she couldn't stand the idea of her male body having sex. Thus, her asexuality was linked to her dysphoria. Once her dysphoria is cured, her asexuality disappears. That's why I think it's important to stress that asexuality is more about attraction and less about one's libido or interest in sex.   Ps. Let me tell you this: that story about being ugly and such is clearly stupid."

I don't think I'm ugly, and that's really all that matters, right?   Am I antisocial? I prefer independent. I like to do things on my own, and I do not crave much human interaction. People around me seem so needy. They can't go out to eat by themselves. They can't go to the movies by themselves. They are so afraid of being alone. Of course this is a huge generalization. But I really don't think I'm the one with the disorder. Maybe your real issue is self-confidence? :)"

Sounds like you are demisexual or grey-ace, personally, which basically means you need an emotional connection to ""feel"" anything. But no one besides you can accurately determine what kind of person you are and labels are only approximates, of course.

A friend (from my adult world) told me that she's asexual and we shared a similar experience growing up. She told me she enjoys sex, and enjoying sex doesn't automatically make me not asexual. And then I think about my gay friends' stories as kids and how very similar it was- we'd lie cuz we thought something was wrong with us.   Although I can never compare this to a gay person coming out because they have to deal with their own social-stigma that is so much more visible than what I will face in life- as I am still attracted entirely to men. I have an instinct repulsion toward vagina that my bi friends do not get. 'It's your own anatomy, it's human body!' and because of that i can't not acknowledge that this isn't a comparable 'questioning of my sexuality' but at the same time I am stumbling just as much as they told me they were.  Because in reality I realize I will still have to take on a stigma. The idea of telling a future some-one i am serious about is super daunting. I think about how that sounds and that scares me as it's very different. I've always gotten by just fine calling myself 'weird'. Weird is socially acceptable, being asexual is not so much.   At the same time, like it's kind of an ultra-hip label. Like, hey look at me I'm not hetero-normative! That's really just how I'm trying to make myself feel better. The realistic-ness of telling someone is daunting!  First things first, I should probably come clean with my fwb. I lied to him when I told him i found him attractive. He'll probably be a helping hand.  Pretty much, i need help. Please just link me to something that has helped you figure it out or something. i literally get so overwhelmed by it I find myself avoiding it. My friends were right to go to forums and what not, because these are the places I'm brave enough to go back to. But in terms of doing real research on it--- I'm like turned off, and i tune out. I have a lot of fears here.   update: i'm literally crying tears of anxiety. Is this normal? Cuz in reality I've been lying to SO many people. For my ENTIRE LIFE. I have gotten used to basing my attraction on how people around me see their attraction. I know I need to be honest but I'm really scared.  Update again: I told my fwb. He was very cool about it. He's like, you know i think i might have the same thing?"
asexuality,32ihd5,PirateAceOfHearts,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"There is more than one sort of attraction. I get the impression that the attractions you've felt we're aesthetic attraction (physical but nonsexual, like wonder at a sunset) and emotional ""crush"" (wonderful people you want a close relationship with, but, again, not sexual). Feel free to dismiss that part if I'm wrong. If the attraction you've felt has been sexual you could be demi or grey asexual. There are sex interested, sex indifferent, and sex repulsed asexuals. Your activities aren't mutually inclusive to your sexuality.  You're relationship with your current bed partner makes me think of relationship anarchy. Where friend, lover, play partner, etc, are sort of blurred and whatever happens happens. Labels aren't very important. It's a sort of open relationship style.  But it could easily still be FWB, just between friends who are more romantic-y with certain friends or even a relationship with no goal. Many people enter a relationship seeking ""the one"" or someone to commit to potentially share their lives with in a very specific way. With that being a cultural norm, any other relationship style can seem odd and hard to label."

asexuality,32gslg,Double_R55,2,Mon Apr 13 21:59:24 2015 UTC,"Shadow of the Colossus will always and forever be my favorite game. Usually when you say a game has 'minimal story' that means it's not engaging outside of the obvious ""this is a game, go do game things to get the points"" sense... SotC gets you deeply emotionally invested in the story while giving you basically no concrete information whatsoever. It's the best kind of ambiguous... it takes talent to present so little so well."
asexuality,32gslg,Kirielis,2,Thu Apr 16 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"I agree!  There's also so much back-story that you're given to ponder, like the ruins of the ancient cities, especially when you're fighting Colossus #15.  Plus there is the literal back-story of Dormin's...not sure the word, banishment?    I get chills when I think about my first playthrough...something about the atmosphere just sucked me in, like traveling down to the river bed to fight Colossus #2.  One of the most immersive game experiences I've ever had, and this was only a year or two ago, so I can't blame it on nostalgia.  Even if it never comes out, I'll be looking forward to The Last Guardian."
asexuality,32gslg,Double_R55,2,Thu Apr 16 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"Oh man, do not get me started on Dormin. If I was ever involved in a protest of any kind, I would be the one holding a non-sequitor sign and that sign would say ""Dormin was innocent!"" They tell Wander up-front the cost isn't going to be pleasant, they give advice whenever you look stuck against a Colossus (and, if you're really stuck, they even stop being cryptic), and they stick to the deal. It's not Dormin's fault that Wander was being hunted down in the first place. I will buy any number of theories on why Dormin was locked away in the first place (although I am inclined to believe it was dueling religions / a shifting religious climate) but saying they're just EEEEVIL doesn't cut it.  Then again, I appreciate a good Faustian bargain and am probably not the best judge of this kind of thing. Moving on! What's your favorite Colossus? Mine's Pelagia/#15, because every time I look at it I have a different opinion on what kind of creature it is. Some kind of... gorilla-turtle-minotaur-slug? And it has teeth on top of its head!"
asexuality,32gslg,Randomixx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Dormin kind of makes me think of Ben Hawkins in Carnivale, who could transfer life energy between organisms, so he could heal someone's injuries but he had to take that energy from somewhere else, like wiping out a pond full of fish to heal someone's broken arm.  Maybe Dormin had a similar kind of ability, and he was misunderstood and (literally) demonized by Wander's community because they only wanted to focus on the first half of it.  Pelagia (#15) was intimidating (in a good way of course), but I tend to get frustrated by the battle, I remember trying to stab him in his hand and getting shaken off for 10 minutes.  I tend to think of him more as a gorilla than anything else.  Phalanx (#13) was my favorite battle, just because of the ridiculous scale of the colossus.  My favorite overall experience though was the last one, Malus.  The build-up to the battle was perfect, such a sense of foreboding darkness (AGRO!!), plus the music.  The fight itself feels like it was taken straight out of my nightmares, it always reminds me of ""Night on Bald Mountain"" from Fantasia."
asexuality,32gslg,ssockie,2,Fri Apr 17 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Chernabog was definitely the first thing I thought of when I saw Malus. And then -- despite the initial impression of, you know, looming evil overlord, Malus was so imprisoned and restricted. He wasn't perched atop his mountain throne, he was chained down with manacles and had no legs. A reflection of Dormin's condition? A representation of the fear of the region's previous inhabitants? Proof that the SotC designers were allergic to giving a solid explanation? I just found it interesting that a figure given every possible stylistic marker for 'evil' was simultaneously so constrained."
asexuality,32gslg,Randomixx,2,Fri Apr 17 00:37:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm....honestly, I hadn't thought of Malus in that way, that's a good point.  Intimidating as Malus was, there wasn't anything glorious or enviable about him.  Poor guy was doomed to get rained on for eternity, he didn't even have the luxury of flying around or enjoying a nice swim in a lake like the other colossi.  No wonder he'd be irritable and start shooting lasers at you.  :(  Maybe if the priest (or chieftan or whatever his title was) of Wander's community had some creative control over the ""design"" of the colossi, he designed Malus as a form of punishment, like a figure in constant pain, a kind of final ""screw you"" to Dormin.  That line of thought vaguely makes me think of Pyramidhead in Silent Hill 2.  EDIT : #dormin2015"
asexuality,32gslg,ssockie,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"All I know is that if my legs were replaced with architecture, I would absolutely be pissed enough about it to throw fireballs at anyone who came near :P  I guess it stuck out to me because the other colossi tend to be so placid and free-ranging. Until you start actively stabbing them, they just chill doing their own thing. (Except Celosia and Cenobia, but they come across as angry little guard dogs so being more aggressive is probably their job?)  EDIT: But wait, the more I think about it the less it makes sense for Celosia and Cenobia to be guardians of anything. Even if Dormin refers to them that way. Why would only two of the colossi have specific duties? Unless the other colossi's job descriptions are ""do nothing"" and ""be in eternal agony""??"
asexuality,32gslg,Randomixx,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"Kind of a stretch, but Malus could've been a strategic decision.  You have to fight a variety of colossi with different characteristics in different environments, the assumption being that nobody would be crazy enough to kill all of them and ultimately release Dormin.  If you could get to the end and fight Malus, that means you bested a bird, a floating centipede thing, a catfish, roaming humanoids, etc.  Maybe the idea with Malus was to throw something so different at you that you wouldn't know what to do with it, haha.  I did feel some regret about killing the peaceful colossi, especially Phalax and Avion (#5).  They were just flying around and minding their own business.  I did not feel this regret with Celosia and Cenobia, little jerks had it coming."
asexuality,32gslg,udonchopstick,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:30:57 2015 UTC,Dormin reminds me of a pagan god in a lot of ways - maybe they took another leaf from that handbook and had a bunch of not-particularly-related domains? It would explain why the colossi are all so different from each other. And maybe if they were an amalgamation of a bunch of different gods that would explain the two-voices-of-different-genders thing.
asexuality,32gslg,Tarfu,2,Fri Apr 17 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"Super Mario 64 was epic! I remember going over to my friend's house because he was the only one with a Nintendo. I never did manage to beat it. Wind Waker is my favorite Legend of Zelda game, mostly because of the possessed dragon boat, though I didn't play Link's Awakening."
asexuality,32gslg,TheCrimsonEscapade,2,Mon Apr 13 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, I remember when the N64 came out originally and they had displays at Blockbuster, and I would stand around slack-jawed at the graphics.  The Blockbuster employees probably hated me, I'd just play the demo for hours instead of renting anything.  Wind Waker is great!  Especially Wind Waker HD for the Wii U.  I love the visuals, I think they're probably the best of any Zelda game that I've played.  I'd rank Wind Waker higher on my personal list but I didn't think the puzzles/dungeons were that memorable, and I love my puzzles.  Link's Awakening was for the GameBoy, it was my first Zelda game.  Seriously epic story for a GameBoy game, originally it was about Link dying in a shipwreck and getting stuck in limbo, but that was considered too ""heavy"" for American kids.  They re-used the engine for Oracle Of Seasons and Oracle Of Ages, both of those are pretty awesome too."
asexuality,32gslg,missneuronerd,2,Mon Apr 13 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't get a gameboy until the sp came out, so I missed out on Awakening. Now I want a Wii U to play wind waker... I still use the game cube to play it.   And they always seemed to be changing games to not offend North American sensibilities, though the Harvest Moon games did tend to be a bit odd before the changes. As for Blockbuster, no one's mentioned them in ages! I remember going into the store and staring longingly at the games isle- our store didn't do demos or they would have had a pretty hard time getting rid of me too. It was always pretty awesome when you rented a game that had just been played and got all the bonus stuff..."
asexuality,32gslg,TheCrimsonEscapade,3,Mon Apr 13 22:44:22 2015 UTC,"I miss my GameCube.  I heard Metroid Prime came out for the Wii U virtual console, but I haven't investigated yet.  Gonna learn from my mistakes and stop getting rid of consoles, hahaha.  I've never played any Harvest Moon games, would you recommend them?  I played Animal Crossing : New Leaf, which I think is similar...I had mixed feelings about it.  I appreciated the atmosphere, but the awareness that I wasn't actually working toward an ending was too weird for me.  I can't help but wonder if kids these days are as blown away by games as I (or we) were, in the Blockbuster/Nintendo 64 days.  Maybe they're just like ""eeeh, there's another new game with photo-realistic graphics, that's cool I guess..."""
asexuality,32gslg,althaeam,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:11:39 2015 UTC,"I'm still blown away by games that come out today, but I dunno about  others... Harvest moon was always pretty fun, and not that similar to animal crossing, which has less of a story line, and little consequence for missing debt. It's more of a management sim, combined with interpersonal relations. There's no high level management which can make it pretty repetitive, but I still enjoy it. Some of the newer games are more ""kiddy"", and less fun, but some of them are still pretty awesome. Rune factory is another interesting series, and a spin-off of Harvest Moon, if you want some combat and exploration (I haven't actually played it, but I've heard good things)  ...and wow that got pretty long, pretty quick. I have to go now, but I'd be happy to blather on about Harvest Moon and all the other games tomorrow :)"
asexuality,32gslg,stone_cold_stoic,2,Mon Apr 13 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have been feeling a sense of saturation with violent games...like there's only so many times I can blow someone's head off and still get a kick out of it.  That makes me kind of attracted to more ""peaceful"" franchises, like Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon.  Maybe I'll try Harvest Moon on an emulator or something.  OK, happy job hunting!"

asexuality,32fo51,intheshape,7,Mon Apr 13 12:32:50 2015 UTC,"That's SO wonderful :) and their reaction is great. Keep being you!   I think I'll tell my parents once I turn 18/go to college because right now I'm a little young--even though I know I am ace I don't want the ""late bloomer"" card, etc. pulled on me. It's so awesome that you told your parents, though!"
asexuality,32fo51,LittleLuthien,5,Mon Apr 13 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised to find the word ""out"" being used so much around these parts. Do you consider your lack of interest for sexual intercourse to be a very big deal? Do you fear repercussions the same way gay children fear being kicked out by their homophobic parents? Telling my family that I'm not very interested in being in a relationship has never been a problem. I never used the word ""asexual"" with my parents, but I'm 32 and my last relationship happened 9 years ago (it lasted 8 years), they have come to terms with the fact that I won't give them grandkids without the need for a discussion about my sexuality (or lack thereof)."
asexuality,32fo51,dclctcd,12,Mon Apr 13 16:49:54 2015 UTC,I think it's as important as any other orientation. Aka if gay/bi people feel the need to come out then it makes perfect sense that asexual people would too
asexuality,32fo51,dahliadelinquent,5,Mon Apr 13 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"This. The only reason I wasn't really afraid of getting kicked out is because my parents are highly accepting, but yeah. Its for almost all of the same reasons."
asexuality,32fo51,redneckgymrat,2,Mon Apr 13 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see it that way.  Let me explain.  Among my gay friends, most comment that ""everybody already knew"" before they came out.  Their coming out is almost never a surprise, but for them it reputedly serves two purposes, a formal announcement through which control of the situation was achieved, and formalizing it through a public statement of their desires.  I understand the desire to be in control, so for that purpose I can understand coming out.  But there are many ways to remain in control of situations.  But the statement of goals?  What goals?  Asexuality is, by definition, a lack of certain sexual goals...what is to be gained in this respect?  I truly don't understand the motivation to go somewhere and announce, shout from the rooftops basically, my personal sexuality.  Perhaps you could explain your own motivations?  Just because gay/bi people do it is insufficient reason.  As with so many things, it seems to be a very personal choice."
asexuality,32fo51,dahliadelinquent,2,Wed Apr 15 06:16:49 2015 UTC,"...it's still the same thing? Taking control, formalizing your orientation. Wanting people you care about to know a (large, for some) part of you. What do you mean goals?"
asexuality,32fo51,redneckgymrat,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps.  Guess it's a personal thing, an individual thing."
asexuality,32fo51,dclctcd,2,Wed Apr 15 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly wasn't sure what type of phrasing to use, so I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean to offend anyone."
asexuality,32fo51,Fire-Flowers,7,Mon Apr 13 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to sound as if I was disapproving. You didn't offend me in the slightest. By using the word ""you"", I was addressing the other readers of your thread just as much as I was addressing you.  I was mostly wondering if it's common and productive to use this vocabulary when talking about our lack of interest in sex. I don't consider my asexuality to be an important part of my identity, certainly not something that needs announcing, it's just a personality trait that I feel I can discuss matter-of-factly with anyone who asks. It's on the same level as my lack of belief in religion.  I don't imagine that people are getting disowned for telling their parents about their lack of interest in sex. Most parents will think that it's a phase and that their child hasn't met the right person anyway.  Anyway, if your parents not knowing was a condition that was difficult to endure and if telling them liberated you, then I congratulate you."
asexuality,32fo51,dclctcd,5,Mon Apr 13 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"First, I know it's just a matter of wording but asexuality is only not experiencing sexual attraction, not lack of interest in sex. It's a fact about our identity, and it doesn't describe how interested someone is in sex, since that varies from person to person.   And it's not about it being 'a big deal', coming out is necessary because our society is very (Allosexual-)heteronormative so everyone will get labeled cis-allo-heterosexual unless they say otherwise.   And asexual people still have romantic orientations and relationships. I'm panromantic, in a relationship with another girl, and I definitely fear repercussions if I were to come out. There's a possibility I could lose my job, and my parents would react awfully."

asexuality,32esh1,LittleLuthien,5,Mon Apr 13 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"It's something that'll come to mind for a lot of allosexual people before asexuality, those guys who lie to themselves about not being interested in romance/sex to cover up their insecurities or low self-esteem.  Especially since if they know about asexuality in the first place they'd probably figure a friend would have just told them about it already, but since asexuality hasn't ever been mentioned, that must not be what's going on here."

I told two friends, both of whom stopped talking to me. I later found out it was because they thought I was lying and was secretly homosexual, which they consider a sin. They wouldn't even listen to me after that, so I never tried to make them understand.  Ever since then, I have been very careful about telling people. I can count two hands the people I've told, and on one hand the people that believe me."

I have told a couple of people, but only after becoming very close to them and coming to trust them.  I am not the one to bring it up. It usually starts with them asking me one of the usual ""who do you like"" type questions. If I feel like I want them to know, I tell them the truth, otherwise I give some lie."

It wasn't particularly simple for me, but after a good bit of soul searching, I realized that I'm definitely asexual, and probably pretty much aromantic.   There are a few excellent threads on /r/askmen and /r/askwomen that deal with understanding sexual attraction. Granted, both are probably a bit embellished, as the OP was looking for input in regards to a romance novel she wanted to write, but hey, you might find them helpful-- I know I did."
asexuality,32dybh,21stPilot,2,Mon Apr 13 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"Trust me, it's less awkward for everyone involved to just say masturbation instead of using a euphemism like choking the chicken and then putting quotation marks around it.  Not feeling sexual attraction is a pretty good reason for not knowing what sexual attraction feels like, yeah.  Sounds like there's a good chance you're on the asexuality-spectrum to me.  If all you've ever felt is romantic attraction, then all you've ever felt is romantic attraction.    It's not a prerequisite to be asexual to also be aromantic, after all."
asexuality,32dybh,stone_cold_stoic,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:06:21 2015 UTC,"Based on your explanation, it sounds like you and I have a fair number of things in common, and I am identifying as asexual.  So, take that for what it's worth. ;D  I think sexual attraction is, to put it in its simplest terms, a question of whether you would actually, physically like to have sex with a particular person.  Imagine if a girl who you found aesthetically pleasing came to you now and asked you to have sex.  Not in some abstract fantasy kind of way, but a realistic proposition.  Forgetting all the risks and stipulations for a moment, would you feel compelled have sex with this person?  I've put myself through this scenario many times and I always come out to ""no thank you, ma'am""."
asexuality,32c2my,icanbein,21,Sun Apr 12 14:39:09 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you, this guy sounds terrible. Anybody who tries to pressure you into sex when you've said 'no' isn't cool. Maybe you are aromantic, maybe you aren't. Either way it's something that can't be explored with this guy because frankly he treats you badly. He doesn't respect your boundaries and that isn't okay. I understand he's unstable, but you've only been going out for a week. Break things off with him sooner rather than later. Whether you're in or out of a relationship with him he will remain an unstable person. Get out before the pressure becomes worse!"
asexuality,32c2my,regularbean,11,Sun Apr 12 18:49:15 2015 UTC,I also want to add that if something did happen it's not going to be all your fault. If he is unstable then he needs professional help and that's not your responsibility.

You told him from the start that you're asexual and do not want sex, yet he doesn't respect it. He sounds really worrying, being so attached to somebody after only a week? No, red flag. Btw, if he really does something bad to himself it will absolutely not be your fault.  Can't give you any advice on the aromantic bit, I'm not sure that distinction is even necessary."

I looked it up and it felt like my world flipped upside down. Up to that point I thought that I was just a slow bloomer and would learn to like boys eventually. I went on that forum and asked if I could be Asexual, and I was told no. That at 16, there was no way of knowing and I should wait until I am older to define myself. I waited until I was 18 to come out to any of my friends, and I am 21 and still happily Ace/Aro.   I don't know if I see the world all that differently from allosexuals. I've never been one! The only real difference i suppose is that I have a little bit of trouble understanding the intense desire for relationships I see in my friends. They make it seem like without a relationship, their life has less meaning. I just try to support them in any way I can and move on I suppose."
asexuality,327emc,NeoRainbow,10,Sat Apr 11 13:42:28 2015 UTC,"I posted this.  It's surprisingly difficult to answer this question.  Looking back, I can see that I was different even back in grammar school. When high school rolled around, I stayed a good Christian boy and did not lust after girls. Ditto college. After all, I'm saving myself for marriage.  But even the best Christian boy notices girls. THINKS about girls.  My mother approached me about it, that I had not even been on a date, and we agreed that if I still felt nothing by age 25 I would get checked, medically. This simply wasn't right. Wasn't normal.  Nothing was wrong. Hormone levels were fine, everything works. I just lacked the normal desires that, apparently, everyone else on the planet feels. I was broken. But not in a way that could be fixed.  Fifteen years later I started googling about it. 40th birthday. 40 tends to be a time of introspection. That was when I discovered the term asexuality. Oh my God, there is a term for people like me. I'm not actually broken, I'm just different. And, for the first time in my life, I'm not alone.  The wash of relief nearly brought me to tears. A lifetime believing something was wrong with me...and then, no more.  So, to actually answer your question, at some level I've always known. But! I didn't accept it as my identity till I was 41. Three years ago."

My friends were talking about hormones a lot, and some were even starting to experiment with each other.  I didn't understand it, and thought maybe I was a late bloomer despite already hitting puberty. Nope."

My first thought never jumps straight to sex and it actually takes me a long time to figure out sex things people are talking about.   I'm also a behavior analyst so I know why this happens."
asexuality,327emc,CoffeeCupWine,5,Sat Apr 11 16:29:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't see the word till I was like 18 but it didn't really register. I only started identifying with it in my early 20s.  With that said I always knew I was different from my friends. They kept trying to turn everything into spin the bottle/kissing crap and here I was avoiding them like the plague cause I sure as hell didn't want to kiss any of them. Then I thought I was just a late bloomer and it'd hit me eventually. Still waiting :p  And as someone already said, I don't get ppl's need for a relationship, like they wouldn't be complete if they weren't in a relationship which is such a preposterous thought for me. I still give them relationship advice (ha) and they even come to me for it, probably cause I'm always objective and I'm good at reading ppl.   But yes, I do see the world differently than sexuals. I have had to train myself into looking at things with a sexual undertone, just so that I'm in the loop, and even then somethings still fly right over my head lol."
asexuality,327emc,Kali711,5,Sat Apr 11 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"I realized I was asexual when I discovered that girls feel sexual attraction just like men. The society I live in teaches us that women are way less sexual than men. While this can be true to some extent, I thought girls were almost non-sexual beings. I felt like that: I didn't and still don't have interest in having sex with someone.   When I was 15 my (girl) best friend, who had been in a relationship with a guy for 2 years, finally confessed to me all the ""things"" she and her boyfriend had been doing. I felt shocked! I thought she was too young for petting, even after being in a relationship for 2 years. I would have never thought about all those things. Yet this didn't make me realize I was asexual, maybe because I didn't know about asexuality's existence (or perhaps because I can  be very slow at times!).   I realized I was asexual 1 year ago, and I felt relieved. I finally understood I didn't owe sex to anyone, that I was allowed - well, that actually I had the right not to have sex, ever, if I didn't want to. This changed my vision of the world only slightly. I now know finding someone who will accept me for who I am will be difficult. And I know sex, if I ever do it, will be difficult for me and probably not good for my SO, at least at the start. This kind of makes me sad. Sometimes I wish I was like most people. But I don't really feel bad being this way."
asexuality,327emc,ver_sacrum,3,Sun Apr 12 09:19:23 2015 UTC,"So, I basically always knew I was asexual, but I first read the term ~5 years ago when I was about 15. As for the difference between me and my peers, a lot of it is them, ""look at that person! So attractive!"" And then I'm just awkwardly like, ""they have a nice... bone structure?"" They've basically stopped telling me. Though, sometimes they forget and start telling me all about this new guy they saw, and I just give them a look like, 'what??' And then they just laugh. So, it's mostly just good fun. Sorry for aggressive punctuation errors, I'm on mobile..."
asexuality,327emc,radioactivepenguins,3,Sun Apr 12 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"I first heard of the word ""asexual"" when I was a freshman in highschool. My health teacher was going over sexual orientations, and asexual was one of them. I remember my teacher saying that some students before were surprised how some people could be asexual and that it even exists. Honestly, I was surprised that people could disbelieve the concept of asexuality because, to me, it made complete sense right away! I didn't really identify as it then (reasons because I didn't think it was too important), but it was always in the back of my head.   I do see the world differently. I know this because I would say things about sex and relationships that I thought was common sense, and I would get embarrassing, strange looks. Mostly thanks to the internet, I now understand that my thoughts are far from commonplace. I now know that many people think of sex everyday, want sex, and even express that sex is essential for a healthy life. I also somewhat understand how those students way before could think ""how could this be??"" since asexuals are such a minority. It wasn't until late highschool that I really knew about the majority's opinion about sex."

The lens through which the world is viewed seem to be too different, at times even inimical to one another.

I figured I was a late bloomer or that I had a low libido, then when I was 18 I was put on meds that killed my sex drive and I learned the true meaning of ""low libido"" and then it became clear to me that sexual attraction and lbido were separate, and I had a libido, I was lacking attraction. I started to identify as Ace.  When I was 22 I met someone with whom I developed sexual attraction too after being friends for ages, So I now consider myself Grey-A. When I became sexually attracted to them it hit me like a ton of bricks and I remember clearly thinking ""woah, This is what it feels like... ok, I see why people get so passionate about it"" But I still have no desire to engage in the actual act of sex. I just like picturing that person in sexual situations.  I don't think I see the world any differently.

Had been rather uncomfortable when the peers talked about such stuff since the teenage years (am now 25), so maybe, it may had been the case since then? However, here where I am, the environment is rather conservative, and concepts such as asexuality were rarely discussed.

We have dozens of labels that apply to us at any given time, and ignoring the rest of your aspects to focus on only your sexuality isn't a fair way to treat yourself. It's not how you would treat other people, right? You deserve no less.

That said, if someone experiences sexual attraction (not just physical like ""Oh they touched my bits so I'm physically aroused"" but ""Oh they're sexy and I'm physically aroused because I find them sexually interesting"") then they probably aren't ace, but might be sex-repulsed/indifferent if they don't have a desire to act on their directed arousal."

For the sake of brevity — asexual males can still attain and maintain an erection, and asexual females can get wet. These indicate arousal, but do not expressly indicate sexual attraction. Some asexuals also have high libidos (sex drives) and thus desire sex but do not feel sexual attraction to people.

If they persist I start asking probing questions about their feelings and frankly make them uncomfortable.

To enjoy food is to be a pig. To be weak is to be useless. These are not inherently sexual ideas.  Basically, I'll believe /u/graaahh when reputable double blind study has been conducted. There is likely some connection between self-worth, self-image, and sexuality. I doubt it is so clear cut as they have suggested."

asexuality,31y3yw,areyoudancingatall,3,Thu Apr 9 03:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think body image issues are linked to how we perceive us, instead of how others perceive us. For example, (and I'm going to make it simpler than it really is)  someone with anorexia still perceives themselves as fat even if society tells them to eat more. So we should wonder whether being asexual is linked with not caring about being attractive. I don't think it is, but I don't know. Attractiveness and beauty are the same thing looked with different eyes, imho. We all need to feel beautiful to some extent, perhaps asexual people see it like being aesthetically pleasant while allosexual people see it like being sexually attractive. This is only a rant though, I think to answer your question - which is a good question indeed! - we should do some sort of research. Another question I have is can someone be sex repulsed and identify as asexual because they don't like their body? This has kind of happened to me, I don't like sex because I don't like my body (though this isn't the only reason I identify as asexual).

I never felt broken, or had any need to figure out my sexual identity. It's mainly my own curiosity which led me to figure it out in the end."

I then finally thought to myself that the conspiracy would have to be enormous for this to be the case, and I discovered, with great surprise, that most people experience this sexual attraction thing on a daily basis. It was then the hypothetical question ""You can have consequence-free sex with anyone in the world, would you take it?"" question that convinced me I probably am for answering no."

I have actually found that Lars Ullerstam (whom I think was the one you were talking about) was a medical doctor and psychiatrist in Stockholm, and he was in favor of relationships between children and adults, which doesn't automatically make him a pedophile. And anyway he did not create GSM, only ""sexual minorities"", which usually is applied only to groups who practice consensual sex.

asexuality,31s5rt,littlelionsam,2,Wed Apr 8 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"The trouble with slurs is that they're situational, and innocuous words can be made to sound like slurs by intonation, or combination with another word. I once had a class talk about the hypothetical(?) difficulty of prosecuting someone for defamation if they refered to you as a ""bastard,"" because whether they said ""poor bastard,"" ""lucky bastard,"" or ""mean bastard"" seriously changes the meaning. Note that none of these necessarily refers to the actual meaning of bastard, as a person born out of wedlock / an illegitimate child.  Queer used to mean, odd, funny, bizarre, strange, etc. It was used as a slur for homosexuals, and likely (not sure about this) trans people. It has been significantly reclaimed and is often used as an umbrella term for LGBTQIAP+ issues, especially in academia (as in ""Queer Studies,"" or a ""queer reading"" of a text). Some of the original meaning is retained, in the sense that it isn't the ""usual"" dominant perspective, but there is no slur intended. That is not to say it isn't still used as one, I've never heard it, but really most categories/titles can be said with enough disdain that they sound offensive. Eg: ""I can't stand those women"" as opposed to ""I was talking to those women...""  I recommend using them as synonyms. It should be clear that you don't mean it as a slur.

If you're talking about individuals' identities, then queer might be more appropriate.  Queer... is kind of in flux due to the process of reclamation.  It's one of those things where in day to day conversation you should ask someone how they feel about it if they're not already using it freely and indicating that they're fine with its use by others for them, IIRC.

Generally I go with the really vague 'not interested' sort of reason, but that's because it's all the information I can give without feeling uncomfortable. You should be aware that not everyone knows about and accepts asexuality, which might cause you stress or discomfort to have to explain. It's not really TMI, because it's relevant to the situation, so if you're comfortable explaining that you're asexual then it's a perfectly acceptable reason (in my completely biased opinion)."
asexuality,31prvy,dragonzflyte,5,Tue Apr 7 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"I think it is completely up to you. If you are comfortable letting people know, then its fine. I have some gay friends who tell women ""sorry, but I'm gay,"" so I don't think it is TMI. It is relevant, because many people are interested in dating in hopes of getting more involved (depending on how well they like the person and all. But there is a goal out there to find someone that you can be intimate with).  That being said, you also don't have to say it. You don't need to justify why you say no to someone. You could say ""sorry, not interested at this time"" or any other variety of ""no."" Go with what you are comfortable with.   on the other I feel weird telling random dudes my sexuality like that   People are broadcasting their sexuality all the time. Other people can broadcast there sexuality in many ways (by the conversations they have, certain ways they act, who they hang out with, by actually hitting on people, etc.), but its hard to show that you are asexual. You kind of have to talk about it, which is what makes it feel weird. And if you are like me, sexuality takes up so little of my brainpower that I never even think about it, thus I feel like I am revealing too much even though it is something other people are able to show off constantly.  Also, a lot of people don't even know what asexual is, and you may have to explain it to them. If you think it is weird revealing your sexuality to random dudes...imagine having to sit down and have an actual conversation with them about it."
asexuality,31prvy,osteopath17,4,Tue Apr 7 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Really, it's entirely up to you what you're comfortable with, and don't let anyone try and decide for you.  Personally, I don't think it's TMI since that aspect of a relationship will have to be tackled at some point or another, and the act of asking someone out in itself is the person giving consent to getting this info thrown at them. Therefore, I like to make sure to explain everything up front at pretty much the very moment a guy expresses an obvious interest in me: If they're open to the idea of a relationship without sex, great! If not, I feel that it's better to let them know they never had a chance up front than to be accused of leading them on at a later date."
asexuality,31prvy,Randomixx,3,Wed Apr 8 03:18:40 2015 UTC,"Is it kind of TMI if when someone asks you on a date you tell them no because you're asexual?   Only if they're not actually asking you out on a date and you misinterpreted them, but in those cases you should be able to resolve the situation easily enough.  If they're also ace, then they can say so and you have potentially something to chat about.  If they're not ace, then they know not to bark up the wrong tree and spend more time in a futile exercise.  As for rejection... eh.  For some people it's less of a rejection for them to find out that the person they asked out is gay or straight or ace or otherwise sexually incompatible and for others a rejection's a rejection and there's no sugar-coating it or making it ""nice.""  As for weirdness, really, you're less likely to run into issues where it's weird to tell someone you're ace and more likely to run into issues where the person you told that you're ace doesn't understand what asexuality is so you'd need to be prepared to give the cliff notes version of Asexuality 101 or rejects asexuality as legitimate and decides to hassle you.  But the latter would potentially hassle you even if you gave ye olde generic ""not interested,"" especially if you're AFAB, because life and the majority of human cultures are bad like that."

But me, I think my crushes are more aesthetic, maybe sensual, than anything else. [because you're new, some types of attraction aces might differentiate between, not usually included as a qualifier of identity include: aesthetic, sensual, romantic, etc. pretty sure there are terms for someone whose style you like, and who smells good too, I just don't know them off the top of my head.]"

asexuality,31nkp6,fannarrativeftw,2,Tue Apr 7 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"That's actually my problem too. Some people say that they can't tell the difference, and might call themselves quoiromantic or wtfromantic (yes, as in WTF). The idea seems to be if you feel an urge or draw to do ""romantic"" things with a person, it's romantic. Of course the definition of ""romantic"" varies person to person. For now I'd guess I'm in the quoiromantic camp, because it's more than platonic but idk if romantic? Or something."

I would think or romance as flowers and candles and little gifts, but I'd give flowers and gifts to friends if I have money. It comes down to whatever the people involved define as romantic.

I learned the other day that people that can't tell the difference between platonic and romantic love are quoiromantic. So, something else to learn!  There are so many misconceptions about asexuality out there, its frustrating. And its hard to talk to anyone, because no one understands. In a different post I had a conversation with another redditor about how as asexuals, we have to separate out so many things that sexuals don't (like how sex, love, attraction are related; how some asexuals can not feel sexual attraction and yet have a sex drive; etc.). So talking to someone who doesn't have that experience is hard, because they don't really understand."

While the peers are talking about crushes, love, relationships, and such, kind of found myself having no idea what they are talking about (stuff like these seem more foreign to me than the various foreign languages I enjoy learning in my spare time). Found myself zoning out of the discussions while they were talking about such stuff. Never experienced such stuff before; had no idea how to contribute to the discussion.  Think, I tend to classify people based off whether I can work with them (or not). Maybe, it seems to be slightly more ""professional"" sort of manner when I deal with interpersonal relationships and such. If I think I can work with them, all is well, if I think there is no way for me to work with them, I tend to prefer to stay away from them... At least, this is what I find myself doing at times.  Seriously, am really curious about such stuff. How is a crush (and also, another term that I saw in this thread, squish) supposed to feel like? Had people saying that the way I see things tend to be a bit ""robot""/""computer""-like in the past, if anything... Wish to hear how people who have experienced such stuff in the past felt before, so that i can see whether I may have had such experiences before in the past...  P.S. Am still kind of new to some of these...

This was the first time in my life I felt that desire to have a different relationship with someone than the one we already had...it was really weird. I can't even think about how to describe it. But I'll try, cause I know exactly what you mean. Up until I actually experienced it, I was never sure about whether I had actually experienced a crush or not.  So, one way to describe it is that my expectations of the relationship we had changed. We had been acquaintances for a little while, but I wanted more. I wanted to be her friend. I started to initiate conversations with her more often, I started to sit with her (and some of our other mutual friends) during lunch, started to hang out with her more. Just thought that if I started to treat her more as a friend than an acquaintance, the relationship would change and we would become better friends (which is kinda what happened). Pretty much, I treated her like I treat all my other friends, even though technically our relationship was still at the acquaintance stage.  Another way to maybe describe it is that I could see her becoming a close friend. Why? I have absolutely no idea. It still makes no sense to me, we don't really have that much in common. But at the time (maybe it was because I was in a new place with no friends) it seemed like it would be nice to have a close friend, and for some reason my mind chose her. But it became a ""goal"" of sorts, getting to know her well enough to become friends.  When I write it out, it seems weird and stalkerish...but I swear it wasn't like that. I didn't hang around her all the time or anything, I just treated her as a friend. It was like jumping our friendship forward...we would have gotten there, I just gave it a bump by saying that we were already friends. If she had said that I was unwelcome (in any way) I would have stopped.  I know its not the most helpful description, but I honestly have no idea how else to describe it. I only know that, as it was my first (and so far only) squish, it felt extremely weird.  *edit: Just saw your PS. No worries! I think I commented on your post from a couple days ago haha. You are most welcome to comment here. I know that I am still trying to figure everything out myself as well."
asexuality,31pt9j,cantorb,9,Tue Apr 7 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my perspective, but I'm not a man. If you are homoromantic, you shouldn't push yourself into trying a hetero relationship. It's not fair to you, and it's certainly not fair to your partner. Some people could manage these things if they are attracted in another way (homoromantic bisexual man and straight woman), but you only want a relationship with a woman you're not sexually or romantically attracted to becuase you want children. So you just want to use her for that, which is a despicable thing to do. Is the possibility of biologically related kids worth it? That doesn't mean you can't have kids, even bio kids. People donate their eggs, and surrogates exist. It's a difficult process I'm sure, but infinitely less awful than having a relationship with a woman you're not in the least attracted to, just to procreate.  UNLESS you find yourself happily in the company of an aromantic woman who wants kids, or any other situation in which you simply agree to co-parent or something, IN ADVANCE of entering a serious relationship. Basically if you're not dishonest you might be able to manage it.  As for trying sex, I have no idea. I'd guess that as long as you're comfortable enough/not repulsed, you could manage. Not saying it'll be fun though."
asexuality,31pt9j,fannarrativeftw,0,Tue Apr 7 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"Thanx for your answer, obviously I plan on being open with her beforehand about a lack of sexual attraction. My main point is that I believe I can build a bond and an attraction with a woman who is willing to accept me- even if there's no ""sexual crush"" leading to it. only mentioned ""because I really want to have kids of my own"" to explain why I'm looking for a hetero relationship. I have no interest in sex with anyone, therefore would prefer to build a family ""the old-fashioned way"" mainly for that reason. I know that my ""equipment"" works, my main question is whether it would acutally work in a sexual situation, or it would be a total disaster."
asexuality,31pt9j,fannarrativeftw,2,Tue Apr 7 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"It still doesn't make sense why you wouldn't seek out an asexual homoromantic man, or a gay/bi man who's willing to go without sex. They're not inherently less likely to go without sex than a woman is, and you can still have bio kids, hell Neil Patrick Harris & David Burtka have two! If you want a queerplatonic relationship with a female partner that's fine, I'd encourage it. Otherwise picking the gender of partner you don't want to have sex with based on her organs, when you're romantically attracted to another gender is just confounding.  I think I might have misinterpreted some of your meaning actually. When you said ""the old fashioned way"" I thought you meant heterosexual sex to make a baby, as opposed to fancy science.   Now I think you meant marriage for partnership and social/financial purposes, without the dating and falling in love, like people with lots of money did way back when marriages were arrangements, not celebrations of romantic love. That sounds great, and is pretty similar if not exactly the same as a queerplatonic relationship. HOWEVER keep in mind that any children would likely end up with that practical view of marriage, not the dominant romance narrative, or might feel confused about not being able to reconcile the two. Just something to keep in mind. But DEFINITELY look into Queerplatonic arrangements. Seems like that's what you want to go in for.  Edit: spelling"
asexuality,31pt9j,OakTable,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:59:17 2015 UTC,"By ""old fashioned way"" I did mean for a baby, as well as for partnership and social purposes, but I think you nailed it with the Queerplatonic comparison. I've never heard that term before but it definitely sounds like what I'm looking for. Thanx again- hope it helps clear some stuff up.  Btw as a side point I believe you're underestimang arranged marriages. While other factors are/were more important than romantic love in the original setup, the expectation was to build up a full loving relationship. This might sound crazy to your average Westerner, but it does work very often- the love that can be built up THROUGH a relationship can rival the natural love that leads to a relationship. I believe there have been some askreddit threads for people with arranged marriages if you're interested in doing some research."
asexuality,31p191,Greenorangebluered,2,Tue Apr 7 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"It could be sensual attraction, though /u/osteopath17 could also be correct that it's sexual repulsion. As far as whether or not you are asexual, sexuality, and asexuality, is a spectrum.   You don't have to be completely a/sexual. You could be grey-ace, or aroflux. In the end it's up to you to decide whether or not you're asexual- no one else can really determine whether or not you experience sexual attraction, or to what extent. The label there to help, and doesn't have to be permanent.   There's no rush to decide you are right this minute, even if it's frustrating to not be sure. Take your time, research the labels, and see if any of them fit. If so, awesome! If not, that's okay too, and you're still perfectly welcome to hang out here."

It's arousal from erotic stimuli without wanting yourself involved. I tend to think it ties into what gender(s) you're aesthetically attracted too, but isn't straight up aesthetic attraction. Paraphilias are often considered a bit strange in principle, but this one seems totally fine to me. But I experience it, so I'm not exactly objective.

Maybe heterosexual but sex-repulsed? I know there are sex-repulsed asexuals, so I imagine there can be sex-repulsed heterosexuals as well.  But I could be wrong, you could be a sex-repulsed asexual with aesthetic attraction. I'm still new to this sub, so I don't know what all the different kinds of attraction are.  But honestly, these labels don't matter. They are to tell other people a bit about you, but they can never truly do you justice. And as a random person on the internet, I know only what you have written. So if I say that to me you sound like a sex-pulsed heterosexual, then take it to only mean that based on the brief description you gave, I thought that these labels fit you best.  Hope this at least kind of helped. Good luck in your search for self discovery!  *edit: looking at other responses...apparently I don't know what sexual attraction is.

Even afterwards, it did not increase my interest in sexual activity with anyone, nor did I look back and think ""Man, what have I been missing?""."

asexuality,31p191,osteopath17,2,Fri Apr 10 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"I think the following can explains things better than I was about to do (taken from this article):   Am I still asexual if I experience genital arousal? (In response to porn, to sensual touching, to overhearing sex, to nude bodies, etc.)  First of all, let’s specify what arousal is: a penile erection or vaginal lubrication. It’s that tingling sensation in your genitals that can start even before you show full physical signs of arousal. You can be horny without arousal, and you can also be aroused without a preceding feeling or horniness.  An asexual can experience genital arousal. How easily this happens or what makes it happen varies from ace to ace. Some aces never get aroused, just like some aces have no libido. Some aces get aroused by porn, some aces get aroused by heavily sensual or very intimate touching/physical affection (like cuddling or kisses or skin to skin contact), some aces can get aroused by seeing naked bodies (without an accompanying desire for actual sex with the naked person). Arousal can be and often is involuntary or independent of a mental desire for sex. In other words, just because you body wants sex doesn’t mean YOU do. This is why some rape victims, male and female, experience arousal and even orgasm during their assaults. When aces experience arousal, they don’t always like that it’s happening or enjoy it. They don’t always feel the need to do something about it, like masturbate to orgasm.  When arousal happens in connection with a physical and/or mental sexual desire for another person, that’s sexual attraction. When arousal happens but your mind isn’t on board with the idea of sex, that’s just your body acting in response to some kind of visual, auditory, or sensual stimulation.   The bolded (after the title question) I feel were the most important points to get across for the point of this reply, but yes, asexuals can get aroused by looking at nude women without feeling that they're 'missing out' so to speak."

asexuality,31hdh1,dragonzflyte,6,Sun Apr 5 03:41:03 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure when they came up with the idea for an ace ring, it was just a black ring worn on the middle finger. I don't quite remember if it's specifically supposed to be on the right hand. I'll go AVEN-spelunking to see if I can find the right thread. Anyone want to add on to this?    Edit: I found a page on the AVEN wiki that explains it. It cites a thread on AVEN, but the link is broken. The wiki page is here, and explicitly states, ""Wearing a black ring on the middle finger of the right hand has since been adopted by many individuals as an unofficial symbol of their asexuality.""    Of course, how you choose to convey yourself in any arena is up to you, though variations might not get the same level of recognition on sight by people that know the black ring as an ace symbol, since it would be missing one of those characteristics.  If you're curious about ways of visibly indicating you're asexual, there are a few other symbols chosen by the ace community: the triangle that appears quite frequently on this sub, cake  and the ace of spades playing card I believe are all ace symbols."

I identified as heterosexual for a long time because I was (and am) aesthetically attracted to girls, and I didn't know what asexuality was until recently.  Now I identify as asexual because I simply don't want to have sex with anyone.  My underlying sexuality never really changed, but my perspective on it did because my self-awareness expanded.  That's just me, though.  I spent a lot of time thinking about this kind of stuff."

Thanks for clearing that up!"
asexuality,31c3a8,Skirtz,7,Fri Apr 3 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Well, what I personally mean when I say ""sexuality is fluid"" isn't that it's malleable, but that it falls on a scale, a spectrum, like you said. Like how gender falls on a spectrum, not just on a ""left/right"" switch. Humans are way too complex for anything like sexuality to be completely binary. There's so many internal, genetic factors and external, environmental factors that are constantly shaping us. So I think that's what people mean when they say sexuality is fluid. It's what I mean, at least."
asexuality,31c3a8,redneckgymrat,3,Sat Apr 4 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"Think of the duality as a spectrum, not as a toggle switch.  The vast majority of people have had sexual thoughts about both genders.  So they're some degree of bi.  Just because you're 90% straight, it doesn't mean you can't find Patrick Stewart to be sexy.  And it doesn't automatically follow that the straight man who finds Patrick Stewart sexy wants to get him into bed, even though he admits his sexiness.  The fluidity they typically describe is in two dimensions...one is along the straight/gay axis.  In the example above, one day the urge may be slightly stronger, or slightly weaker.  He is 90% straight, plus or minus 5%.  Yes, it slides around, but not tremendously.  The other axis is his desire to act on it.  And some days he might be more or less open to it, than his average.  SO yes it's fluid.  And over time the movement up and down the axis can be more pronounced.  But this ""flip a toggle switch"" ""pray the gay away"" idea is unlikely to succeed.  Unlikely...but not impossible.  As you said yourself, some number, regardless of the quackery involved, statistically might have moved far enough to be ""cured."""
asexuality,31c3a8,ver_sacrum,3,Fri Apr 3 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"I know you get ""sexuality is fluid"" a lot, but that can be true or false depending on the interpretation you give it. We never stop learning about ourselves, sexuality included. The discovery of one's sexuality can take many years. A label you initially used to define yourself could be replaced by another that fits you better. Does it mean your sexuality has changed? I think it actually means you've learnt to understand yourself better.    Science has looked at the causes of homosexuality, and more generically the causes of human sexual orientation, with the general conclusions being related to biological and environmental factors. The biological factors that have been researched are genetic and hormonal, particularly during the fetal developmental period, that influence the resulting brain structure, and other characteristics such as handedness. There are a wide range of environmental factors (sociological, psychological, or early uterine environment), and various biological factors, that may influence sexual orientation; though many researchers believe that it is caused by a complex interplay between nature and nurture, they favor biological models for the cause.    We can't change our genes or what has happened while we were in our mother's belly so - although sexuality is not determined by these factors only - there is a part of it that is caused by something rather stable. Also:   The conclusion reached by scientists who have investigated the origins and stability of sexual orientation is that it is a human characteristic that is formed early in life, and is resistant to change.   I think it's unlikely that someone who has been attracted by X for most of their life suddenly feels disgusted by X. On the contrary, they could well discover they are also attracted to Y. Or they could feel less attracted to X - but not disgusted! What I am saying is that your sexuality is very unlikely to do a 180° - unless you have a trauma or some unhealthy experiences. This is only my opinion though, I am not a specialist of any sort!  source of the quotes"

So it's not that our sexuality changes, but rather that a different aspect of our sexuality is brought to light by different circumstances.

My position is that for some people their sexuality is fluid to some extent and it'll vary from there.  Everyone I've known with fluid sexuality would just shift back and all they'd have to show from ""conversion 'therapy'"" would be psychological trauma and sometimes physical trauma as well, depending upon who was administering the ""therapy.""   How do you reconcile the idea that sexuality is fluid, with the fact that heterosexual people don't suddenly become homosexual and vice versa?   People with fluid sexuality are basically their own category rather than being straight or gay or bi.  Bam.  That easy. They just shift through preferences which resemble someone who has a more conventional or unconventional single sexual orientation.  Plus, there are some women who just become lesbians once they hit middle age, and we're reasonably certain that they weren't just really badly repressed and in denial about it and were legitimately straight before they flipped."
asexuality,31c3a8,fernando_69,2,Sat Apr 4 04:48:34 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with what your second part says, that people change and make choices because of experiences and circumstances, but that doesn't mean it's conscious; a woman who dated men and then dates women might find she is no longer attracted to men. To me this would count as a fluid sexuality, without necessarily meaning she was bi or gay before. She might find her preferences change back later, but really even if it is different circumstances, does it matter why?"
asexuality,31c3a8,xifeng,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to say that it is necessarily conscious. And it certainly doesn't matter why.  I was just saying that if sexuality is fluid (in that people can just change from homosexual to heterosexual or vice versa), then there is no validity to the argument that people are born into their sexuality, and that therefore there can be a ""correct"" sexuality. I don't agree with that, I don't think that there is a ""correct"" sexuality or that people need to change their sexuality. So to me, the statement ""sexuality is fluid"" seems incorrect/hypocritical."
asexuality,31c3a8,bashar_speaks,6,Fri Apr 3 20:05:12 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between changes over time, and a forced change. Kids don't like a lot of greens when they are kids, their taste buds find them bitter, but as adults, that's less of a problem; doesn't mean you can feed yout toddler enough brussels sprouts that they'll start liking them. And just because people say sexuality can be fluid doesn't mean everybody's is. You're no more likely to turn a straight man gay than a gay man straight. But again, I'm with you that it may not be as fluid as all that, but sometimes we need something to say that lessens the phobia eg: ""Craig wasn't gay when we were camping together, dude, he was with Mandy! Sexuality if fluid, he wasn't checking you out!"""

It's a little bit uncomfortable though, on the other hand, because it reminds me of just how abysmal sex education is in this country that people don't know how bad of an idea it is to carry condoms in wallets.  If you find out anyone who actually intends to use a condom puts it into their wallet, please share the information that keeping condoms in wallets damages them even before the wrapper itself it punctured.  Because, seriously, wallets are horrible places for condoms and they get all kinds of microtears and other issues that can't be detected by the human eye.  I must admit though, that the wrapper lasted that long since it was already expired by the time it went in your wallet is kind of impressive."

asexuality,31buko,fannarrativeftw,3,Fri Apr 3 20:56:05 2015 UTC,I have never heard this term before today and it describes me perfectly. (Though I would describe my relationship to sexual attraction the same way.)
asexuality,31buko,narrativedilettante,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"Well, that's interesting.  How does this affect relationships? With established friends? With new friends? Does it change anything? Are their platonic relationships different in some way?"
asexuality,31buko,redneckgymrat,4,Fri Apr 3 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"Well if you literally can't tell the difference between platonic and romantic attraction, it's simply a non issue.  I'll ask you this way...your own asexuality.  You have a blind spot of your own, with regards to the appeal of sex.  How does that affect your own platonic relationships?  How does it affect your new friendships?  Different is...different."
asexuality,31buko,redneckgymrat,1 point,Fri Apr 3 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"I understand that, I was just wondering if perhaps it is harder to form relationships with new people.  I guess you are right, platonic relationships wouldn't really be affected by lack of romantic attraction. Just has they aren't affected by lack of sexual attraction."
asexuality,31buko,Fire-Flowers,2,Fri Apr 3 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"Since lack of sexual attraction is a side effect of some medications, we have people who can explain, from first hand experience, the different feelings.

asexuality,31buko,Fire-Flowers,4,Fri Apr 3 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend is quoiromantic! Basically she explains it as not understanding the difference between platonic and romantic love, and it's definitely on the aro spectrum :)"
asexuality,31buko,skyhi14,3,Fri Apr 3 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting, I'd love to learn more.  This will probably come off as offensive, though I don't mean it to be...how is she your girlfriend? As in, from her point of view, how is her relationship with you different than her relationship with other people (if you don't mind me asking. I am not looking for personal details about your relationship, just trying to understand how she can ""not understand the difference between platonic and romantic love"" and still be your girlfriend)?"
asexuality,31buko,ver_sacrum,7,Fri Apr 3 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"Not offensive at all, don't worry! I know this sort of thing can be complicated. Basically we were best friends and basically queerplatonic for quite a while, but I'm like super allo-romantic and totally in love with her, and when I told her and we decided to call what we have a romantic relationship the way we acted with one another didn't change too much at all, since we were already very emotionally close and physically affectionate. I guess it just feels a bit more 'official' and being able to call her my girlfriend makes me so fucking happy.   You don't have to experience romantic attraction to be in a romantic relationship. Everyone is free to define what a romantic relationship is for them. With me and my girlfriend, even if our orientations aren't the same what we look for in a relationship is 100% compatible and would be the same no matter the label. I believe that's the most important thing. I'm in love with her and she loves me very much and wants to be with me, the fact that she doesn't understand how romantic feelings are supposed to be different from strong platonic love doesn't bother me at all. She loves me in her own way and shows it to me every day and I couldn't be luckier :)   from her point of view, how is her relationship with you different than her relationship with other people?   It's different because of the level of commitment and intimacy."
asexuality,31buko,fannarrativeftw,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Queerplatonic? Never heard of it. I'll have to look that up.  I agree, romantic attraction is not required for a romantic relationship (sexual attraction isn't required to have sex, why would wouldn't the same be true here lol). But at the same time, I don't really understand how such relationships can form (as in, what is the basis of the relationship, do both people get the same thing out of the relationship or is it more one sided, etc.). Of course, relationships are complex things, in part because humans are so complex, and each relationship is different.   It's different because of the level of commitment and intimacy.    I kind of figure this part. I didn't realize what a stupid question that was until you answered haha.   even if our orientations aren't the same what we look for in a relationship is 100% compatible and would be the same no matter the label  the fact that she doesn't understand how romantic feelings are supposed to be different from strong platonic love    I think these are important things that I was missing. Thank you for your reply, it was very helpful (and gave me much more to think about haha)!  I'm happy for the both of you!"

asexuality,31buko,Requiescence,6,Fri Apr 3 17:35:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point of such a label. I don't want to be mean, really. Some time ago someone said the same thing about demisexuality and I kind of got upset. It's not like I'm against it. If people feel better about themselves by using that label, I think there's nothing wrong. But I would never tell someone I'm ""wtfromantic"". I think there are way too many labels, and some just don't make sense."
asexuality,31buko,autowikiabot,8,Fri Apr 3 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to make sense to you, just because you don't see the point doesn't mean there isn't one. Quoiromantic is just a way of saying ""I don't really know,"" where they've felt something, and it's not romantic, but too much something to be aromantic. Yet grey-aro means ""occasionally"" or rarely experiences romantic attraction, so those ""middle ground"" words don't work either."
asexuality,31buko,fannarrativeftw,4,Fri Apr 3 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"I do think that, sometimes, we go way overboard with labeling and subdividing people.  At some level we are going to get to being Tom-sexual, Jill-sexual, and maybe Bryce-romantic.  But stupid as the term is, and confusing as the multiple subdivisions can get, there are a significant number who simply can't grasp the difference in the types of attraction.  I know it took me decades of study to even begin to grasp that the differences were real."
asexuality,31buko,dragon-storyteller,3,Fri Apr 3 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I prefer quoiromantic as the official term instead, now that I know it exists.  That being said, it's like any other term. It gives comfort in knowing that you're not alone and that there are people out there just like you. And, if you need specific advice or to commiserate, you know who to look for because you now have a name to describe them as well as yourself.  Really, it's no more significant than asexuality, homosexuality, heterosexuality, demisexuality, and so on. In the same sense, though much broader, it's no different from having a name for your familial relations (sister, brother, etc.). It's all just words to describe a particular situation. Some languages are much more specific than English is when it comes to these things, so I wouldn't expect to be accustomed to it."
asexuality,31buko,dragon-storyteller,2,Sun Apr 5 08:25:14 2015 UTC,"wtfromantic is pretty abysmal, as far as why anyone would ever make that word to be used as a label, but it's not like someone would use ""questioning"" for their romantical self when that's reserved for people who aren't sure what their orientation is vis-a-vis sex and gender of partners, so there's definitely a space for an ""I don't know"" term."
asexuality,31buko,dragon-storyteller,2,Sat Apr 4 04:38:52 2015 UTC,"Wtfromantic (from Aromantics wikia):       Wtfromantic is a very loose definition. A wtfromantic will typically be someone on the aromantic spectrum, who does not experience romanticism in the traditional manner, but who cannot fully say they are aromantic or grey-aromantic. It is usually used by someone who knows they are not a full romantic, but has no better term for what they are. The specific meanings of the identity is up to each individual. * Wtfromantics may differ from grey-aromantics in many ways. While grey-aro individuals are those who fall somewhere along a line in between romantic and aromantic, wtfromantics may not be on the line at all. Wtfromantic is generally used as a catch-all term for those who fall somewhere in the category of semiromantic or alternatively romantic, but do not better fit into any other label. Still, wtfromantic people can identify as grey-aro as well. Another term for Wtfromantic is ""Quoiromantic"".

asexuality,318zkc,CubicSlime,10,Thu Apr 2 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"Hi! Nice to hear from you!  Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction. Now, I have no idea what sexual attraction truly is, so if you are looking for a better definition...I've got nothing haha. A desire to get married, have kids, etc. is not really related to sexuality (or asexuality in this case).  Based on what you have said, I would say it is likely you are asexual (because I did not see anything about you being attracted to anyone).  That being said, it sounds like you may be an aromantic (not desiring a romantic relationship with another person) asexual (not sexually attracted to anyone).  I think it is common for people to feel unsure. I don't know what sexual attraction is cause I have never experienced it, but what if I have experienced and not realized what it was? And it becomes harder if you are homo/grey/demi/heteroromantic because you still desire a romantic relationship, so you have to reconcile that with not being sexually attracted to someone. But even then, being aromantic brings its own questions.  But honestly, these labels don't matter. They are to tell other people a bit about you, but they can never truly do you justice. And as a random person on the internet, I know only what you have written. So if I say that to me you sound like an aromantic asexual, then take it to only mean that based on the brief description you gave, I thought that these labels fit you best.   Hope this response helped at least a little. I wish you the best as you explore and find out more about yourself :)"
asexuality,318zkc,osteopath17,3,Fri Apr 3 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"I see...  With regards to the getting married and having children, it seems to be some sort of a ""social norm"" here where I am... As in, there is some sort of an ""unspoken expectation"" for all to follow. That is why I sort of linked it to sex and relationships in general (which may be incorrect)...  Meanwhile, can confirm, have never felt any sort of attraction to anyone (which probably will confirm the part about being asexual). Though, perhaps, I also do not know how being attracted to someone feels like... Also find it hard to imagine having a romantic/sexual relationship with another person (of either gender), which may, in a sense, confirm the aromantic part that you have mentioned? I do have a pretty strong loner sort of trait/streak since young, which may make things a bit more complicated...  With regards to the labels, I think, no worries. On a given matter, people will all have different thoughts and opinions. Though, will certainly be reading up more about what you have mentioned...  Also, your input is certainly helpful. Here where I am, it is hard to find people who may be in similar circumstances (the mindset and worldview of many people here tend to be a bit more conservative and traditionalist), which makes it kind of difficult to find people here with whom I can talk to regarding the above... Anyway, thank you very much for your prompt reply! :)"

One of my friends (he actually came out to me, not knowing I was also asexual. It was weird to realize that I had made a friend who was asexual without even trying haha) is a heteroromantic asexual. He was talking about how he was conflicted because he knew he wanted to have a romantic relationship with someone, but he had never felt that kind of attraction for anyone. So I don't think you are the only one to have tied these two together (I think a lot of people in the world do because people link sex with relationships and sex with sexuality, and then make the small jump to linking sexuality with relationships).   Here where I am, it is hard to find people who may be in similar circumstances (the mindset and worldview of many people here tend to be a bit more conservative and traditionalist), which makes it kind of difficult to find people here with whom I can talk to regarding the above   I can understand that. I'm in the US, and even here I feel like that are very few people I can talk to. This subreddit is great because I can actually express myself to other people in similar situations, and yet I don't have to worry about ""outing"" myself to people."
asexuality,318zkc,ver_sacrum,3,Fri Apr 3 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"I see... Here, at least in my immediate environment, sex, sexuality, and relationships, do seem to be closely linked...  Had mentioned about possibly being asexual to a friend, who came out as gay to me some time back (he was quite surprised when he heard about it). Kind of act as a support for each other these days, as we don't really fall into the ""expected"" sexual orientation here in Singapore. If anything, kind of feel, even though on the outside, the country does appear to be rather Westernized, but feel, the mindset and worldview still tend to be rather traditionally Asian (i.e. get married and have kids, continue the family line, etc.)...  Also, I do agree, that there are very few people I can talk to, or even discuss about this... Accidentally let slip, that it was possible that I may be sort of asexual to some acquaintances some time back, got grilled and questioned (or more appropriately, interrogated and mocked) about this in turn. Probably, it is a concept that is way too foreign for some of the people here to understand...  Guess I will probably be dropping by this subreddit more often in the future... Hopefully, would be able to do further discussions about this over here in the days ahead..."
asexuality,318zkc,redneckgymrat,3,Fri Apr 3 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this, you sound like an asexual aromantic to me. Asexual because you aren't interested in sex and haven't felt sexual attraction to others, aromantic because you aren't interested in love relationships and haven't felt romantic attraction to others. I would say that there's no mistake, but remember that the last choice about these labels is yours. Also, you're quite young. Remember that these labels might describe how you are now, but never feel as you have to attain to them if, later on, they don't describe you anymore."
asexuality,318zkc,redneckgymrat,3,Fri Apr 3 08:53:23 2015 UTC,"I see...  With regards to the labels, feel, it is just some words that can be used to describe myself (among others), and not the main overarching sort of definition of who I am (i.e. the label is the only thing that defines me).  Certainly, may have some issues understanding how relationships and romance work, as well as how it is supposed to be like, as I had never been in such a position before...  On the young part though, am already in the mid-20s, which, to some of the relatives (especially those in older generations), is already considered a good age to start to settle down and start a family (which is something I cannot imagine myself doing)... When I compare myself to some of my peers (i.e. on online games, in my foreign language classes, at the gym I frequent, former classmates, etc.), am already feeling a bit ""old""... Many of them, though younger than myself, talked about relationships and such, which is more foreign to me as compared to some of the foreign languages that I am learning... Had a point I wondered if there is anything wrong with myself due to this ""disconnect""...  Though, if anything, maybe, for now, these terms may be rather apt in describing my situation, I feel. Pretty certain that things are unlikely to change even in the future, as my personality and such have been the same since young (e.g. the rather strong loner traits), but, who knows what the future may hold?  Anyway, thank you for your input and advice. :)"
asexuality,318zkc,osteopath17,3,Fri Apr 3 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"Okay...where to start?  So many topics, so many subjects, so many points.  Asexuality.  Inability to experience sexual attraction. Aromantic.  No desire to pair up with a partner.  That's it.  We make those definitions so complicated, but they really aren't.  You tell me...are you asexual?  Separately, are you aromantic?   Now, let's talk about the rest...  Marriage is the joining of two people, until recently one man and one woman, into a legal relationship.  There is also a religious component, but it has little relevance in this discussion.  That's it.  I have gay male friends who have been married to women.  Sexual orientation, while helpful, is not a prerequisite to marriage.  Some of those gay men I mentioned have also produced children, and I don't mean through a sperm bank.  Procreation requires the swapping of bodily fluids between a male and female.  Again, sexual orientation is helpful, but not required for this action to occur.  And, cohabitation is yet another option...marriage does not automatically guarantee that you live together.  And you can live together if you're not married, too.  So the question is more complicated than you think, but it comes down to what you actually want.  And, the answer is usually pretty simple.  But it's entirely up to you.  What do you want?"
asexuality,318zkc,osteopath17,2,Fri Apr 3 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"I see...  Could be both asexual and aromantic, I guess (based off what I have read, as well as some of the other replies here). Still quite new to some of these terms and such...  Meanwhile, with regards to the part about marriage, procreation, and cohabitation, here where I am, it all tend to be lumped together as the same thing. Kind of find it hard to see each of these as individual concepts at times...  As to what I want, is still thinking about this... Though, it is nice to know that I am not alone when it comes to such stuff; that, there are people who may be in a similar situation as I am...  Anyway, thank you for your input and advice. :)"
asexuality,3177aj,osteopath17,11,Thu Apr 2 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"I'm an asexual writer, so maybe I can offer some advice based on my experience.   First of all, writing a character with a different gender or sexual orientation is an issue that all writers have to address at some point. I should stress that there's nothing wrong with creating protagonists with the same background you have. Many of Stephen King's protagonists are white male writers and many of Amy Tan's protagonists are second-generation Chinese-American women. I believe that readers prefer honesty over poor writing, so I think it's better to portray a realistic character than a crappy one. Don't force a dishonestly-written character on readers; they will always notice.  Of course, you never have to come out and say your characters are asexual. One approach is just to leave their sex lives unmentioned and unspecified. This is actually the case with most fictional characters, but you probably don't think about it because it's not important. It's kind of weird that none of the Hogwarts professors have spouses, but it's incidental to the story, so it doesn't come up in the books. Sherlock Holmes has no love interest in the original short stories, but that doesn't mean he's asexual or gay or straight. He's a detective.  In my mind, the requirement that a protagonist always has to have a love interest is kind of Hollywood thing. There are lots of movies that have no need for a romantic subplot but include them anyway to appeal to a broader audience. This kind of subplot is sometimes called a Romantic Plot Tumor (also known as a George Lucas Love Story a la Star Wars Episode II).   Having said all that, you're right that most people are not asexual, so realistic writing usually incorporates at least some elements of romance or sexuality. Like most creative pursuits, writing benefits from observation, intuition, and experience. You may not have personal experience with sexuality, but you can still learn from other people and use your own imagination to fill in the blanks.  If you do decide you want to introduce sexuality into your writing, you'll find that most of the work is just description. Physical attraction is based on physical appearance, after all. If a male character finds large breasts attractive, describe large breasts and describe him taking an interest in them. If a female character thinks the way a man walks is sexy, describe his walk and describe her reaction. At no point do you have to share their interests; you are simply describing them the way you would anything else.  If you want to write a sex scene, you will have a lot more difficulty. However, I usually recommend that writers, even ones who aren't asexual, avoid them in non-erotic works anyway. Although sex is a part of most people's lives, it's separate from the other parts of their lives and it's usually not discussed in public. There are plenty of other parts of people's lives that aren't important for a writer to describe, like bathroom trips, traffic jams, and paperwork. Sex scenes have their place, but it's easy to cross the line into trashiness if you're not careful. If the scene is critical to the story in some way, include it with as little description as necessary. Again, forced writing is usually obvious, so the more you fake it, the less satisfying your release will be.  Anyway, when I wrote my first novel, I featured a protagonist who was a lot like me, who was asexual but still paid attention to people's physical appearance. Some of the other characters had romantic interactions, and those sections mostly came back to observation and intuition. My objective wasn't to describe what it's like to be in a romantic relationship (I'm not the right person to do that), so I didn't dwell on it too much.  Hopefully that all makes some sense and helps a bit."
asexuality,3177aj,stevenxdavis,3,Thu Apr 2 17:56:12 2015 UTC,"Don't force a dishonestly-written character on readers; they will always notice.   This is some great advice.  I agree, I often have to write characters that are very different than me. I feel like I do them justice...but they all end up asexual haha. Not on purpose, I just don't know how to tie their sexuality into the story.  I guess leaving their sex lives out of it is possible, I just think that it is unrealistic. For someone that is not asexual and has a sex drive, well its usually a big deal to them (apparently. I wouldn't actually know, but based on the conversations I've heard, its a pretty big deal). So if I am writing a character, and following them for months or years (heck, even weeks) and not once mention their sexuality in some form, am I not doing them an injustice? Am I not saying that they are different than sexual people because they went years without even thinking about sex, without being sexually attracted to someone?   Like most creative pursuits, writing benefits from observation, intuition, and experience. You may not have personal experience with sexuality, but you can still learn from other people and use your own imagination to fill in the blanks.   I agree for the most part. But take fantasy for example. I can write about a dragon...but no one has ever actually seen a dragon, or experienced anything I can write that involves a dragon. All that is required is my imagination. But with sexual attraction, most people experience it. So my imagination isn't enough.   If you do decide you want to introduce sexuality into your writing, you'll find that most of the work is just description. Physical attraction is based on physical appearance, after all.   Maybe this is what I should start to do. It seems like simple advice, but its something I haven't thought of before. Thanks!"

asexuality,3177aj,FuckYourPoachedEggs,3,Thu Apr 2 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"Me too. I've got a story up on Wattpad and DA. My DA account has the same name as here, so it's easy to find. One of my main characters is ace, but I'm trying to write it as just a part of him, not a main thing. It might come up more than once, not sure yet. But it's a romance of sorts, so I'm pretty sure it might come up again."

I don't know much about the romance genre, but I think it'd be interesting to see how and ace character would play out in that setting."
asexuality,3177aj,Cass_Griffin,3,Fri Apr 3 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"I write.  Uh, I do have romantic characters and such, but I almost never have any sex scenes or even much in the way of references to sex.  Perhaps makes my writing seem a little 'Victorian' or prudish, but I kinda don't like having a lot of overt references to sex, maybe that's because I'm asexual, I don't know.  But anyway, I think that a writer can convey that a character is not asexual without having to spell it out.  It may also help that I'm not aromantic; I think it would be harder for me to write convincing romantic/sexual characters otherwise."
asexuality,3177aj,selenic_seas,2,Thu Apr 2 19:05:26 2015 UTC,I agree...I don't like actual sex scenes. It feels...weird (for lack of better term) if I come across a sex scene in a written piece. Unless it is really needed (it usually isn't haha).

The sexual character's give me trouble. Perhaps I should read some fanfiction, see if that helps.  I can understand why it would be hard to write an asexual character if you are doing it in the context of defining and describing sexual attraction, I always avoid that issue by having my other characters be aware of what it is to be asexual haha.  I'd love to see how you described it, that's something I've never been able to do haha"
asexuality,3177aj,Resterian,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:46:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm...that's an interesting way to put it. Makes sense, is concise, and isn't so detailed that people can't follow it. An asexual can read this and pick up on the fact that it is different than what they feel, and someone that is sexual can start to understand that what they feel isn't what everyone feels.   It's different from arousal.   I like that you put that in. So many people don't understand that arousal and sexuality are not the same. Well done!"

I've never really had much problem myself, but I suppose I have the advantage of being Bi-romantic and can at least understand romantic attraction. More so, in a world so rampantly focused on being sexually active and desirable, simply observing other people serves as good research for non-asexual characters.  From that observation, it really does seem to boil down to purely physical aspects, as... odd as that may seem.   Read 'The Death House' by Sarah Pinborough. It's very well written and will give you a much better idea of what sexual attraction is."

The genres I pursue the most are high fantasy because I can let my creativity free, and hard sci-fi because it forces me to work around the constraints of actual science.  I usually tend to forget about sex, so it's practically absent from all my works. Romance is often something that happens almost accidentally at first, since the most characters I write tend to have serious long term problems that keep them occupied. The only hint that there is any sex happening is that children get born during stories or in the gap between a story and its sequel."

I have done the same as you...but recently it was brought to my attention that many of my characters came across as asexual because it is never mentioned. So now I'm questioning my writing lol. Thus the question for all of you :)
asexuality,3177aj,coolbluerat13,2,Thu Apr 2 22:06:56 2015 UTC,"Another plus is that sex is usually avoided in those genres, especially in high fantasy. At least I can't think of anyone who would want to see it in Tolkien.  You only write things the story is about. If you write in sex, the story becomes one about sex, at least partially, so it's only logical that sex and such won't be in the story if it's not important to its development. I don't think anyone would describe going to the bathroom even though it's something we all know and do. You can insert some passing remarks here and there to let the readers know the story is simply skipping over those parts. Have a guy think of beautiful women before falling asleep, or briefly look at a photo of from a long gone relationship; simply a few hints to let the reader's imagination fill in the blanks.  Wow, that got a bit long... a chronic problem for me, it always gets too long-winded. I suppose I just wanted to say that if somebody views your characters as asexual because you don't mention sex, they aren't doing reading right because suddenly a vast amount of literary characters becomes asexual as well. Did the person who said it know you are an ace? If so, it might be simply their perception of you influencing the way they read it."

If your boyfriend is fine with your asexuality I can't imagine he'll have a problem when you explain your kissing difficulty!

How do people take this so seriously?"" And I'll often start laughing.  But yeah, OP, sometimes you just have to say that it doesn't come naturally to you because that's what I've told my partner, and I'm not sure he entirely understands — you know, the whole 'everyone is a sexual being' heteronormativity kind of thing — but it definitely did help."
asexuality,310921,areyoudancingatall,5,Wed Apr 1 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"Kissing has always been extremely foreign to me. I've never known how (or if) it comes naturally to anyone. Maybe its an ace thing? I don't know. Basically (I hate myself a little bit for saying this, but bear with me) practice makes perfect. I'm still not a great kisser, but I've become passable thanks to experience. A lot of the time its being frank with someone and saying ""Look. I'm sorry if I'm bad at this. It doesn't come naturally to me."" People appreciate honesty, and some of the time they may admit that they also have no clue/had no clue how to kiss.  It sounds like you guys have a nice relationship, and I don't think its something to be embarrassed about. Actually, scratch that. I'm STILL embarrassed about it, but its not something you should worry too much about, or be afraid to talk about.

asexuality,310921,vough,3,Fri Apr 3 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"Kissing is one of those things where the most important thing is to actually be interested in doing so, aware of yourself and how you feel, and aware of the other person and what they're doing and the signs they give you about how they're feeling, and then do what makes both parties feel best.  A combination of following your partner's lead and playing by ear, if you will.  I don't see much point if you don't derive any physical pleasure or emotional intimacy/connection from it, though.  Still...  Definitely sounds like you have a need to unpack why you're so unwilling to talk to your partner about this and whether this communication difficulty can/will/does apply to any other aspect of your relationship."

It could be fun for him to teach you."
asexuality,310921,redneckgymrat,2,Wed Apr 1 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"Kissing is always a little awkward, especially early on in a relationship, as the people feel each other out and learn how things fit best.  Just let him kiss you and try to follow his lead. If he's a good kisser then he should be able to make it easy for you to just follow.  If things seem weird or like they didnt go well, ask him what you can do to help.  Lastly just have fun with it. When kissing gets awkward dont feel bad, feel free to laugh over the missteps and roll with it."

I know there are some asexual groups that get together though: I'd encourage checking those out if you're interested.  As far as I understand, a sex drive is the desire to seek out/have sex. I myself am sex-repulsed and have no desire to masturbate, have sex, etc. but I still experience hormone-induced horniness, for lack of a better word, but I have no drive, desire, or impulse to act on it. it's just sort of there, typically during a part of the ovulation cycle.

I know for sure I'm attracted to men, but I'm not sure if I am or if I'm not attracted to women, I've never had the opportunity to pursue a romantic relationship with one, but I know that I always seemed to end up with female friends that were very attractive in my book.  sigh"

If I really put thought into it, I think that at least for me, a romantic relationship with a man is kind of like ""protector and protectee"", it's not that I intentionally make it be that way, but it seems that every relationship I've had, the guy always ends up feeling the need to protect me (and TBH I think subconsciously I might be enabling that or something, I think I do like the idea of someone standing up for me or whatever). Whereas with a woman, I think it would be more of a ""peer"" kind of relationship (this is all assumptions of course, I've never experienced that, but that's the feeling I get whenever I consider it); while I like the idea of feeling of being in a relationship with an equal, all women I've known seem to bring a lot of drama and stress to a relationship (heck, I probably do too), that it really puts me off.  And sexually... I must admit that I don't think I ever was THAT interested in sex with guys, and I don't think I ever even considered it with girls.  After having had sex with a guy though, I can definitely say it's not my thing; but I am curious about how it'd go with girls.  I kind of feel there's a stronger emotional attachment when it's between girls than when it's a guy and a girl. I dunno, I think I could live fine without any sex with anyone at all.

Maybe you just have other priorities, like school or work or a hobby, that you could pull on. Since you say you do feel romantic attraction to ladies this might help smooth things for you.  This is what I do for the most part, since for me I've only felt the necessity to tell maybe two friends of mine that I knew would understand and be supportive, and that I thought might deserve to  know.  However, if it is bothering you that much, consider telling one or two of your most trusted friends to start with? It's entirely up to you if you want these people to know this part of yourself.

I dislike the failure to mention masturbation and self pleasure as something to consider to address this particular issue. Every body is unique and you can't expect a partner to know how to give you physical pleasure if you're not sure what it is that you actually want or enjoy.  If she's not interested in having an orgasm, that's fine, I just don't like how the lack of orgasm was connected to her partner, and not just her own experience and communication.  I'm glad asexuality is getting a mention, But i'm less enthused that the phrase ""a lack of sexual attraction"" was not used. We really need to get ""asexuality=no Attraction"" out there because I think the general public is getting too focused on ""asexuals=Don't enjoy sex"""

I totally agree that it's not the advice she should give her own daughters, but it sounds like it was honest and fairly relevant. Sex usually is a part of having children, especially 20+ years ago, and a lack of sex is usually a problem in a marriage. It's sort of narrow advice - there are other ways and like-minded people (if you can find them), but that was not really a thing in the early '90's.  I guess what I mean is that I doubt the advice is the reason 'Waiting in Wichita' doesn't enjoy sex. Rather it seems that both WiW and her mother have the same reaction to it.  WiW is going to have to give a bird & bees talk that encompasses asexuality as well as the more common sex stuff, since it wouldn't be surprising if one or both girls turned out to be like mom and grandma in this regard. She certainly shouldn't give a 'close your eyes and think of England' speech like she received, but she should touch on the idea that they may feel that way about sex - and therefore may not want to partake in it."
asexuality,30w0u7,arrowhoodcobra,2,Tue Mar 31 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"Sexuality can change over time. You can consider yourself asexual now if it suits you, even if you feel you weren't asexual in the past. And identifying as asexual now shouldn't preclude you from ever identifying with another sexuality in the future, if something changes about you or if you just come to understand yourself in a different way.  As for your relationship, you'll both need to do a lot of open, honest communication without any judgement. That guilt you feel isn't healthy and I suggest you find a way to let it go, though I understand that can be a very difficult task. However, understand that as much as he may want sex, it's not truly a need. He may be disappointed or feel unwanted if he doesn't sense you agreeing to sex as much as he thinks you should, but that doesn't mean he needs sex in order to be happy and healthy. Only do what you feel comfortable with, tell him honestly how you feel, and trust what he says about how he feels.  If he ever seems not to respect your needs or if he consistently puts himself first, then the relationship won't be healthy regardless of whether you enjoy sex or not. But if he listens and does his best to make your relationship work for both of you, then you can do the same, and hopefully build a foundation that will allow both of you to feel good about yourselves and each other."

If possible, I'd say ask a doctor! Only you can answer whether you used to feel sexual attraction, but I do think it can be tough for asexuals to differentiate between sexual attraction and the feeling of liking someone's personality & wanting to know them better/finding someone aesthetically pleasing.... because we (generally speaking) have never experienced sexual attraction. Most of us probably had no idea that it was possible to be asexual. I just labeled the feelings I had with the name of the feeling I was ""supposed"" to have.  For my relationship with a medium-libido heterosexual, I think it's all about compromise. I have a certain frequency I shoot for, and I try to offer sex when I feel closest to being ""in the mood"". I'm not great at remembering and could definitely do better honestly, but hubby is very understanding. I try to find a mental balance between trying to get closer to my frequency goal, and making sure I never get in the mindset of feeling it's a chore. I love him, I want him to be happy, and I want him to feel satisfied. This relationship is a choice I made (and continue to make every day) so I'm actively trying to improve. I tell him what sort of intimate activities I like best (omg backrubs), so it's definitely not all one-sided. It helps a lot that I don't mind sex, I just have no trigger for it...  I'd say, talk to your boyfriend about what he would be satisfied with, and work out a compromise between that and what you're willing to do! At the very least, coming to an understanding about how many times per week would reduce the number of times he asks and you refuse--I think that interaction tends to be pretty upsetting for both parties!"
asexuality,30w0u7,baethan,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"As a trans man, your relationship with sexuality is probably under a fair amount of pressure from various factors and can be affected further by hormones, yeah.  Birth control can definitely have an effect on the libido and health of those who take it, and there's several options that may be able to be looked into for alternatives there, especially as you look into HRT, which is going to have its own hormonal effect on your body and mood as well as possibly having an effect upon your sexuality.  I can't remember if any studies with a significant sample size have been done, but from what I've run into anecdotally, it's somewhere between fairly common and not uncommon for trans men and trans women to have their libidos and relationships with sex strongly affected by HRT.   Is that a thing that can happen?    That's a thing that can happen, yeah.  Sexual trauma, anything at all to do with hormones whether our natural balance or imbalance or hormonal treatments such as birth control, that all can have an impact on a person's sexuality.   Or maybe I'm misremembering/misinterpreting my feelings and urges I had back then?    Also a possibility, but if you've wanted sex in the past, then you've wanted sex in the past.  We can't tell you one way or another.   We love each other to the ends of the earth and I don't want conflicting sexualities to get in the way of that.   It may anyway, so I'd recommend being prepared for that possibility.  Love is not always enough to overcome incompatibilities, and sexual incompatibility is a real form of incompatibility.  I'm not one of the very wise, and even the very wise cannot see all ends, and all, but I do see a few routes this can go.   He voluntarily goes celibate for you, which I see as having a high probability of that backfiring and leading into resentment or the dissolution of the relationship. You hold out until you're off birth control and on HRT or your birth control is rebalanced and you're on HRT if you'd still be on birth control after starting HRT, and see if that brings your libido back. You agree to some frequency of sex and sexual contact greater than you currently have with him, even though you're not interested in initiating sex.  If you only do it out of obligation, though, that's going to end badly.  The only way I can really see such a decision turning out reasonably well, from the place I occupy at least, is if you're able to invest your emotional connection with him into the act and satisfy some of your needs for emotional intimacy by satisfying some of his needs for emotional intimacy.  And even then I don't see that serving as a longterm solution for most people, but my experience and perspective on that front are admittedly limited.  Also depends upon the expression of your libido if you're unable to be aroused and so incapable of having/enjoying intercourse even with foreplay rather than just being uninterested in starting a sexual encounter. You enter into an open relationship, with all of the potential issues and pitfalls that entails, remembering that open relationships only work for a certain subset of the population in the first place."

Since I'm an aromatic asexual, I can literally tell them I just don't swing that way, that I don't see them in a romantic way...they can assume what that means.  Just had it happen with one of my best friends, a few months ago.  We managed to get past it and maintain our friendship.  You can also come out as asexual.  I actually am rather open about my asexuality, but when this type of thing occurs most people think it's just an excuse.  It isn't an excuse, but it's apparently very difficult for regular folk to accept.  More commonly, I just behave clueless which, for me, is not difficult since I am genuinely unaware of much of the flirting people do.  It literally does not register in my brain.

I don't think it's necessarily unhealthy to be sex-repulsed. If sex seems unpleasant to someone I don't think there's any reason for them to try to embrace it just for the sake of fighting through their repulsion. That's assuming that there are no other issues at play. The body-image issues you mentioned are certainly unhealthy, though they'd be unhealthy regardless of whether they were stopping you from having sex, or swimming, or eating ice cream.

There is nothing subtle about sex in a prevalent capitalist society.   Why do you think you are/aren't?   I know I'm not specifically sex-repulsed because sex in general doesn't repulse me. Reading about it in subtle ways or in scientific senses don't irritate or sicken me at all. I am repulsed from specific qualities of sex that certain people exaggerate, not sex generally.   Do you think it's healthy? Why? Why not?   I really am not educated enough to tell someone their feelings about sex are unhealthy on a psychological level. I've been told several times that just not being sexually interested in the world is unhealthy for the mind, so I try to avoid that line of thought; it's largely rooted in ignorance.  Really though, what difference does it make? If you're asexual, you're likely going to be having much less sex than a sexual person in any situation. Sexual repulsion is hardly a vital issue because of that. If someone sees their repulsion as a real concern, there is therapy.

IMO, sex-repulsion is as valid as being sex-positive or neutral and may be a natural byproduct of not having a sex drive.  The idea that being repulsed is wrong comes in part out of the sex-obsessed cultural lens that we've been stewing in since day one. It's an understandable recoil from the days when sex was viewed as the fountainhead of all evil.

asexuality,30sumf,Cianalas,2,Mon Mar 30 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, i am sex repulsed, mostly because of erotophobia due to some unfortunate past events. To me, not only do i think it sounds messy and disgusting, the thought of it is the worst in the world.  I don't really mind, personally, i think the idea of sex, having to care for someone sexually as it were, and do the whole intimacy and such sounds absolutely exhausting. I'm glad i don't have to deal with that, as i have heard that ""sexual incompatibility"" has caused lots of relationship problems, which sounds ridiculous to me, but it's great that i don't need to deal with that. On the other hand, i do struggle to find a partner, as people seem to be so sex oriented these days. I suppose at least for me, it presents some positive and negative sides. Really, i would consider it down to the individual. For me, it doesn't bother me much that i am sexually repulsed, others might see it as unhealthy. It's up to you."

asexuality,30sumf,LabradorDuck,2,Tue Mar 31 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"Are you sex-repulsed?   No, In fact, in the exact right circumstances I can enjoy sex on a physical level. I work as a sexual health nurse and I enjoy hearing about, learning about and talking about sex. The only thing I lack in terms of my sexual identity is sexual attraction.   Why do you think you are/aren't?   My grandmother was a midwife so sex was always a topic of discussion, and it was comfortable to talk about sex. No matter what my own personal desires and attractions were respected so at no point was I made to feel that someone else talking about how much they love sex was an attack on how little I did. I was made to feel comfortable being asexual in a sexualised world, and I even embraced certain behaviours that appealed to me (Like wearing nice underwear because I can)   Do you think it's healthy? Why? Why not?   I think ether opinion is unhealthy when it is causing anxiety or depression, or when it's causing you to be unwantingly asocial or dysfunctional. I know people who are sex-positive and it's unhealthy because they can't respect other people who's opinions differ, and I know people who are sex-repulsed and it's unhealthy because they constantly feel anxious and under pressure. Extreames of either opinion are going to be detrimental.  Basically, Whatever opinion you have, learn to love it and live with it, You wont be able to change the world to suit you, if you have respect for others and you can have respect for yourself and be comfortable, then whatever your opinion is, it's healthy.  I do think its unhealthy not to explore your opinion. You need to be aware of any contributing factors, For example, if you have body image issues, or a past history of trauma, you need to acknowledge that, It's totally fine if someone then has no intention to address it, as long as they can be honest that those other factors are there."

Like roller coasters or something.  There's a rush and good feelings and stuff.  Do you think it's healthy? Why? Why not?  I don't think having a revolution with sex is on it's own unhealthy.  I have a revolution to paper mache (no real reason, I just think it feels super gross) and no one tells me that is unhealthy.

I'm not sex-repulsed, and I imagine being sex repulsed in general (as in by mentions of sex) as opposed to personally (the idea of yourself having sex), is very difficult. Sex is everywhere, but there isn't anything inherently good about sex, so as much as it might seem logical to like sex, there's no reason I can see that disliking it has to be a problem in and of itself. I know someone who's grossed out by the word ""fart,"" sucks for her if people use the word, but these sorts of things are only a problem if they feel like it. If a person experiences marked distress because of their sex-repulsion, maybe they'll want to work on it, otherwise, no need to fix what's not broken."

I'm aesthetically attracted to women, but I've never been fond of the sight of a vagina.  I have no problem with sex as a concept though, so my feelings are somewhat mixed.  I would not equate having sex to being tortured, it's just not something I'm interesting in having.   Why do you think you are/aren't?   I think I just developed this way.  It's like when you don't eat something when you're a little kid, and you're not the least bit attracted to it when you get older.  Coconuts would be an example for me.  Screw you, coconuts!   Do you think it's healthy? Why? Why not?   I consider myself healthy for the most part, physically and psychologically.

Looking back I only really did it as a social status thing.  I'm not sex repulsed, I'm sex neutral. However, I will always say no if put in the situation to have it. For me it's like a game everyone likes to play except for me. I just don't get it.  I don't see how it could be unhealthy. If anything it allows me to concentrate more on things I really enjoy doing. I'm aromantic as well, and have never seen why romantic attachment has been such an important cornerstone for so many people. I don't ""love"" like that.

""The pleasure of your partner should be enough to do it for you!"" What about the other partner who knows they're fucking someone who's getting no pleasure from it? ... Think her relationship with sex is unhealthy now? OP forcing herself to have sex she doesn't want or gain pleasure from,over and over again, is going to absolutely fucking destroy it. Say goodbye to any hope of having a healthy, happy, fully-reciprocated sex life with this person again. Just awful advice.   The ""sacrifice"" argument is always so one sided. I see people say all the time how ""asexuals still have sex to please their partner!"" but never how non-asexuals will abstain for the comfort of theirs. Any time I even start getting hm-maybe-we-should-take-this-further vibes from someone, I explain right then and there that I will never want to have sex, and that usually ends the relationship; even friendship or acquaintance wise. It's rough and awkward but it's because I'm so scared of getting into this sort of situation."

No wonder wives get stereotyped as sex-hating and frigid. They've been emotionally manipulated by people like them into toughing it out and having awful, unsatisfying, sacrificial sex. Sure, that's really going to make someone love sex!  Sorry to hear that you lose friends just because you're ace. That's an unbelievably moronic thing to shun a friend for. What's it even to them?

Also, everyone in that thread seems to... not get that sexuality is something that can be very very different for other people...   I think people should communicate more, and not call each other names, and try to empathize.

""Life isn't about sex"" That was my favorite.     It appears that it is their opinion that, if a woman is not having sex with a man, then it is her problem and regardless of her feelings she should do it anyways--and several times per week. The gilded post mentions that not having sex is ""driving a wedge"" in their relationship. Meanwhile, if she were to essentially force herself to have sex with her husband it would be driving an even larger wedge and foster resentment and hate.   If she didn't like sex she should have never had it in the first place   It just gets better and better. I don't even want to comment on this. It is common knowledge here that sexuality is a fluid concept, but this commenter (and those who upvoted) are clearly completely ignorant to this fact.  I guess I'm just confused. I read both the male and female version of ""what sexual attraction feels like"" and I thought that I was able to at least somewhat relate, but this is just absurd.

Or maybe it's the norm among them to fall asleep spooning their friends, for example?  I am in a relationship with a horny straight guy and according to what people in that sub seem to believe, we should either break up, or I should start fucking him when I don't want to. And yet, we're fine the way we are.  From the few threads I read there, it seems that the couples have  problems with communication, mutual respect and empathy, and they lack not just sex, but also any other kind of intimacy or affection. They try to make each other guilty about wanting/not wanting sex and they don't openly talk about it.  And still, the main problem discussed is the lack of sex, not all those other things."

It seems improbable that the kind of allosexual who believes that they can ""fix"" an asexual and turn them into another allosexual would be able to make it through an engagement to an openly asexual partner and marry them in the first place.

asexuality,30ooqj,Super_Dork_42,2,Sun Mar 29 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"It is necessary for some people, which is one of the most common asexual vs. allosexual arguments I run into out in the wilds of the internet, where two people who otherwise have nothing to do with one another are at loggerheads because a third party feels insecure in their relationship because of possible sexual incompatibility but feels too pressured by society to do what's right for them and either try to work things out or leave.  It's a bit of a toss-up whether feeling owed sex is due to the recursive nature of the discussion material, built up frustration, the starting perspective and beliefs of the people involved, or a mix of where they started out culturally plus what they experienced."
asexuality,30ooqj,Super_Dork_42,5,Sun Mar 29 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"personally I think it's a toxic subreddit full of people that never learned how to be a whole person, or what a real relationship is before jumping into bed with people they were incompatible with long term, or how to talk to people to fix a relationship going bad. I think it encourages relationship-breaking behavior by way of giving people a place to talk to strangers rather than their SO when problems come. I think it's a terrible idea based on good intentions."
asexuality,30ooqj,Super_Dork_42,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:40:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of the subreddit seems to be about getting people back to actually try to talk to their partners properly or recognize that things are over and they need to move on with their lives from what I've seen, but that may partially be a reaction to the recent increase in attention."

asexuality,30ooqj,Noneerror,0,Tue Mar 31 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing ""a whole person"" means ""someone who doesn't need sex to be happy"". So, you know, an asexual.  You also seem to be falling into the entertaining trap of believing everyone in there HASN'T talked to their SOs."
asexuality,30ooqj,Noneerror,3,Mon Mar 30 07:33:34 2015 UTC,"No, ""whole person"" means being able to have the life skills to be a completely happy person without needing someone else in their lives, but also being able to be a good friend and be  someone others want in their lives. I mean able to be a whole person in that nothing big is missing from them that takes away from their happiness.  And have you seen those stories? The majority are asking what they should say to their SO. Not all, but it encourages it by being a place they can go anonymously, which is far easier than talking to the SO. It encourages posts there to come before talking to the SO."
asexuality,30ooqj,temporalscavenger,-1,Mon Mar 30 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"No, ""whole person"" means being able to have the life skills to be a completely happy person without needing someone else in their lives,   Strange, I don't know anyone who fits that bill who isn't a full-on sociopath, as humanity does best with others around. I do like that canard. It suggests lonely people are merely morally and socially defective, incomplete and terrible. If only they were evolved! They wouldn't need sex!"
asexuality,30ooqj,temporalscavenger,2,Mon Mar 30 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"I don't mean they have to go alone, and it's not healthy to do that, but to have the skills to cope with that if the situation comes up. To not absolutely need other people around to live. To be capable of the kind of life a hermit lives, even if not wanting or doing that. Just to be able to be a complete person without a hole in their heart first."

Just to be able to be a complete person without a hole in their heart first.   I would say the vast majority of people, including almost all extroverts, would collapse under these circumstances. There's a reason most people go literally insane in solitary confinement. See also: prisoners kept in the hole ending up as self-injurious, schizophrenic, and suicidal. I think you're setting an irrationally high bar so that you can point to all sexual people and say, ""See? You're just not self-actualized enough. How dare you want sex and companionship."""
asexuality,30ooqj,temporalscavenger,2,Tue Mar 31 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"That's true, and their unwillingness to work on themselves is what, I think, has lead to so many bad relationships. If they don't know how to be a whole person first and how to communicate with their SO, it can only lead to hard times. And I hold everyone to that, sexual or not. Pretty much, in my experience, no matter what your orientation, if you can't be a whole person first and you can't communicate well with your partner, it's going to be a bad time."

asexuality,30ooqj,magoda,3,Tue Mar 31 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying anything like that, first of all. I'm saying that before someone should try to be in a romantic relationship, they need to be a whole person, not a hermit. And I never said anything about me. I'm saying that a whole lot of relationships would be better if the people in them were whole people. It's really hard to describe what I mean by that, so far I've only given examples. It's not a specific thing, but there are too many kids in grown bodies getting into romances, and it's tanked the divorce rate to the point where it is today. That is my point here. I'm not near that point yet, and I'm happy not trying to be part of a romance. Back off. Jeez. I'm not attacking anyone here. I'm stating an opinion that a lot of relationships would work out better if the people hadn't started them before they were really mature. I know some people that are still kids at 45 years old and have terrible romantic relationships because of it. I'm saying people need to not treat romance as necessary in their lives. I'm saying that they need to know how to be happy outside of one before entering one. Why are you attacking me so much on this? I never said anything about me being an example of it, or of asexuals having perfect relationships. In fact, in the previous comment I specifically said that this applies to both sexual people and asexuals. Stop putting words in my mouth that I never put there and basing your arguments on the theoretical version of me in your head."
asexuality,30ooqj,Malzair,3,Tue Mar 31 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"I think many people there are not ace. I think they're either in unhappy marriages - wherein not wanting sex with your partner makes sense - or they're in bitter or miserable marriages where one partner deliberately withholds sex because they see it as some kind of reward.   I'd be willing to bet most situations over there don't involve us. There's always exceptions, though.   My reasoning in this is that most of these folks probably had fine sex lives before marriage. Their complaint is that now they don't. Which is a perfectly valid thing to be upset about, if sex is important to you. Many people assume the sex they had before is the sex they'll have later. Only things change: people stop getting along, stress affects libido, sex gets boring cause its always the same way, etc. If it's simply a stress or boredom issue, these things can be worked through if both people want to. If they don't, you're back to just being unhappy in your relationship.   And that, along with the deliberate withholding of affection as some sort of punishment, is just bad relationship material."

That poster (37 gold now) works at a ob/gyn. She is propositioned every day by husbands and fathers to be. So all these guys are so horny that they want to cheat on the woman they (presumably) love who is carrying their child and is just a few feet away. =That blows my mind.= I'm demi and understand the desire to have sex. I don't understand that though. I can't imagine any situation where I'd want to cheat and especially not that one.  I felt really sorry for the person that comment was directed at since it had so much hate and vitriol directed at her with thousands of upvotes for comments like:   I'm almost positive that the OP is a troll. But if they aren't then they are one of the worst types of people   It makes me question just how much discrimination there really is against asexuals.

A few people claimed to have saved the OP prior to its deletion and it's not entirely unreasonable to conclude that there's some possibility that it was a troll post.  Obviously it's bad that men want to cheat on the woman bearing their crotch spawn, but aside from the percentage of men who'll just try to cheat because of some aspect of their character, it's rather indicative of just how unhealthy the dynamic between two people is if there's that much sexual frustration."

Also, you need to tell him, especially since your asexuality has been contributing to friction between the two of you before you became aware of it fully.  Why do you think he won't believe you if you explain what asexuality is and tie it into how while you're an asexual person who enjoys sex, you don't actually desire seeking it out in the first place and the relationship dynamic that has already been established?  I suppose you could review some asexuality 101 and 201 materials to be ironclad in your confidence in your ability to explain what asexuality is to him and what form your asexuality takes and what this means going forward in your relationship."

If you're sexually incompatible because of his desire for reciprocation of desire, then holding on for longer by keeping this a secret to him wouldn't help in the long run and would just make the resulting separation worse.  If revealing this truth of yourself to him isn't an automatic dealbreaker, then telling sooner rather than later is still in the best interests of both of you and your relationship dynamic, because having open and honest communication between those involved is integral to the health of any longterm relationship."

We change constantly, sometimes quickly and sometimes over many years. Perhaps one day you'll find that you do want to be intimate with someone. And perhaps not. The important thing is to know that neither is inherently right or wrong. You will be a valuable person regardless.   So for now, you could certainly identify as asexual if that matches up to what you feel. And it can change later if it feels right to do so.   As for having a family, try to make sure you know why you want that. What are the reasons you want a wife and kids? Are these reasons enough to strive for? Are they selfless or are they selfish? If it simply sounds fun or sounds like it would fill a void in your life, rethink it. A committed relationship and children, after all, are not a source of entertainment or therapy. Just make sure of why you want those things in your future before you try to seek them."
asexuality,30id6y,OrangeredValkyrie,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"The reason I want a wife and kids is that I can't fathom being alone in the future even though I'm not a very social person.

You could get a dog and quell loneliness in that way without a wife and child in the picture.   Having a child and a committed relationship are not forms of entertainment.

Asexuality is not being sexually attracted to someone*, meaning, for instance, that you don't look at people and think, ""I actually would like to have sex with this person. Wow.""  If you have had these thoughts, then asexual might not be the correct label for you. If you haven't than asexuality might be your game.   Second, there are absolutely people who are into BDSM and are asexual. I remember reading a thread about it on AVEN. For them it is the idea and/or dynamic that appealed and not any people involved. I think that person also reported doing BDSM with someone, but it never got sexual between those two because he/she wasn't comfortable with it. There was also a guy in the (A)sexual documentary that was (maybe) asexual and into BDSM.  Thirdly, research on asexuality is still in its infancy and causality is far from beng determined, so we can't know if asexuality is inherited or not yet. My guess is that it isn't.  Fourth, you can definitely check your hormones if that makes you feel better. If you don't show any symptoms of a hormone problem than it can still be something to give some certainty either way.   Lastly, it is okay to not be happy with your sexuality. I'm not happy with mine. I hate being in the closet, but am too worried about reactions to come out. However, I find that it is important to accept yourself, because this isn't something that goes away.    *I left you grey-ace and demisexuality here deliberately, but they are worth a read if you feel a bit inbetween."
asexuality,30id6y,Fire-Flowers,4,Fri Mar 27 18:28:02 2015 UTC,"Asexuality only means you don't experience sexual attraction. That's it. You do sound asexual to me, probably sex repulsed, though of course you're the only one who can decide what labels to use and what you're comfortable with.   how can I be asexual if I do experience arousal and I have fetishes?   Asexual people can still have a sex drive and experience arousal. Same with fetishes. Some do, some don't, it doesn't make you any more or less asexual.    One thing that I haven't mentioned is that I am attracted to girls' bodies, especially when they're undressing but having sex with them...?   This could simply be aesthetic (and maybe sensual) attraction. Doesn't mean you're not asexual either.   I really don't want to live alone for the rest of my life and I've always envisioned having a family with a kid or two in the future.   You can still have that. Plenty of asexual people have families and romantic relationships. Kids, too, either biological or adopted. It definitely doesn't mean you're always going to be alone. I thought so too once, and now I'm in a very happy relationship with another asexual girl, it's awesome.

Sex aside, do asexuals also find nothing ""special"" about kissing, maybe even finding it revolting? People describe making out as a pleasurable experience but I couldn't ever understand this even though I've never tried it. (I'm not sure if kissing/making out has anything to do with sexuality...) This may sound stupid, but I'm always worried that I have a mental problem that prevents me from feeling normal emotions like others do."
asexuality,30id6y,Fire-Flowers,3,Fri Mar 27 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"It can vary from person to person.  Some asexuals may enjoy it, while others are repulsed.  People have preferences for what they enjoy, and asexuals are no different.  Some may enjoy making out, others may be repulsed, and others are somewhere in between.  It really depends on the person."
asexuality,30id6y,PirateAceOfHearts,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person! Kissing isn't really sexual, it's usually a romantic or sensual behaviour (other things that might depend on your level of sensual attraction are hugs and cuddles, all that sort of physical contact) and some aces love it, some don't. Personally, I think little kisses are very nice but full-on making out with tongue and stuff sounds super gross.   Your emotions and feelings are 100% valid. You might change your mind about kissing because I really think that thinking about kissing in general is very different than actually having someone in mind for it, but it's ok if you don't. It's alright if you don't want to do it. You need to decide what you're comfortable with and express that :) If someone doesn't respect that, they're not good for you and they don't deserve you. Remember that."
asexuality,30id6y,redneckgymrat,3,Fri Mar 27 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"I'm an asexual who also has things, actions and such, that turn me on. But no one has ever been sexually attractive to me. That is, no person on their own has inspired a sexual desire in me. As others have said, this can be asexuality. Whether or not you identify as asexual, know you're not alone in how you feel.  Sexuality is ultimately about who you are or aren't sexually attracted to. Not libido or kinks."
asexuality,30id6y,redneckgymrat,2,Fri Mar 27 21:20:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, first off, let me just say that you are fine.  Perfectly fine.  And we don't need to fit into someone else's box.  It's good to be yourself, whatever that may mean.  Now, since you asked about asexuality, let's define it.  It's actually pretty simple.  We don't experience sexual attraction.  Some of us try to make it way more complicated and a bit cloudy, but that's the root definition.  We can find people attractive.  We can have and enjoy sex.  We can want to couple with someone, or be repulsed by the entire idea.  I'm an aromantic asexual, which means I don't have the slightest desire to pair up with someone.  Others may be different.  That's the beautiful thing about human sexuality.  It's a wonderful and, sometimes, weird experience, and sometimes no experience at all.  You said you find it flattering when someone finds you attractive.  Well, Duh!  You like receiving compliments.  That's pretty normal.  You like being submissive.  That's a little bit less normal for guys, but it's certainly not wrong.  You just prefer that your partner be dominant.  A perfectly valid choice.  You said you ARE sexually attracted to people.  Girls, specifically, as they are undressing.  If I had to put a label on you I'd say you were a submissive but basically straight man, searching for his identity.  Have you ever tried dating a dominant, or at least strong, woman?  Might be just the thing for you."
asexuality,30id6y,sempiternaldork,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:21:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for the helpful post. Now about being sexually attracted to girls, yes I agree, sometimes I can be slightly sexually attracted to girls yet sex sounds boring and repulsive. That's the weird thing about it."

asexuality,30hbau,vooploop,9,Fri Mar 27 11:23:48 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you so much for this line:      I'd rather be celibate for the rest of my life than break up over something like this, we've been through a lot together and I wouldn't trade him for the world. I've survived with my hand and cheesy internet porn for years, I can take care of myself no problem.   Knowing that there are people out here that think like this gives hope that I and other aces will be able to find someone out there to have a normal relationship with.  Second of all, tell him all of this.  I'm sort of paraphrasing, so anything I'm getting wrong, please tell me and change to fit for you.    Explicitly tell him that being romantically and emotionally intimate with him is more important to you than having sex.  Tell him that any time you two do have sex, if and when it happens, you want it to be because he wants to do it, not just because you're horny.  Tell him that sex is significantly more fulfilling to you when he's into it, and that you can be/are fulfilled on emotional and physical intimacy with all of the other parts of the relationship.  If you're comfortable with it, you can add something along the lines of ""I know what it's like to be taken advantage of, [or however you're comfortable saying it] and I don't ever want to put you in a situation where I'm pushing you to do something you're not both comfortable with and enthusiastic about.""    You don't need to beat yourself up for not seeing it.  Just keep an eye out for it in the future, and you'll be doing good."
asexuality,30hbau,ace_detective,5,Fri Mar 27 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"Your situation is not an easy one, and I'm sorry for that, but I must compliment myself with you, I think you reacted quite well! It's normal you feel bad about sex, but remember this: he probably didn't feel forced by you to do it. Perhaps he knew it is ""normal"" to enjoy sex, and he forced himself because he thought he had to like it, sooner or later. Almost all aces at a point of their life tried to like, do or think the sort of things society judges ""normal"".   However, I think he's a little at fault for not telling you how he was feeling. I understand he was very confused and it wasn't easy, but it's difficult to make a relationship work out if there isn't communication. As /u/acedetective suggested,   tell him all of this.    Communication is very important in a relationship! (I'll never stress this enough, ahah). Tell him that you two should talk more about your insecurities. And don't feel bad, if he stayed despite all difficult moments, he must really really like you :)"
asexuality,30hbau,ver_sacrum,2,Fri Mar 27 21:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll wait for him to get home from work and we can sit down and have a long talk. He always said I can tell him anything, so I think it's time I took up his offer, it's long overdue.  Thanks for the advice and the reassurance, it helps a lot. <3"
asexuality,30hbau,Noneerror,4,Sat Mar 28 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"I also feel like I should have picked up on it, and it's horrible. The idea that I was having sex with someone who wasn't all that thrilled about is the thing that feels horribly wrong,    Don't beat yourself up OP. Just because he did not enjoy it directly does not mean he did not enjoy it through you. Like cooking a meal you don't personally like for someone you love can be very satisfying when they enjoy it. Or giving a gift that is appreciated that you don't personally think much of. Or take a kid to a terrible kids movie- it is tedious for you but seeing how they enjoyed themselves makes it worth it. Or a relaxing massage that gives sore fingers to the one who gave it. All these are things that are not enjoyable in and of themselves but are certainly worth it.  Trust your boyfriend when he says that it was ""ok"" and not ""bad"" or something else negative. Ask him to be vocal if that changes. Trust that he will tell you if things change. Take him at his word rather than second guessing him."
asexuality,30hbau,chuckawoodchuck,3,Sat Mar 28 06:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is something that you guys should talk about. You shouldn't go around feeling embarrassed about being into sex with your boyfriend, when he didn't communicate unwillingness.  Plenty of asexuals have sex with their partners before they discover asexuality, and even after (it differs), for a variety of reasons. Talk about it. Both of you guys' feelings. And then figure out a solution that works for both of you."
asexuality,30hbau,ExtraWingyScapula,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"Communication helps.  Both for having been the way to avoid this situation in the first place, since if you'd been talking to your boyfriend about sex you'd have found out about this sooner and for unpacking how each of you feel and how you'll move forward and structure your relationship from here on out.  But communication is a two-way street.  He is, after all, the one who didn't speak up for months about how he was feeling, so you cannot blame yourself or take sole responsibility for the sexual dynamic you had even if you want to guilt yourself over wanting him.  You're definitely both going to have to work on how you talk and communicate so that he doesn't zip up about other aspects of the relationship from here on.  Sexual incompatibility is a real thing, so if you're fine with it, that's great, but don't pretend that it's an illegitimate reason to end things, because that's an unnecessary limitation on processing this and your options going forward.   I don't know. I just I want to work through these feelings with him, but I don't want him to feel guilty for coming out to me, of all things. It's not his fault I'm feeling like this, but he's the sort of person that will think it is regardless.   You need to be able to talk to your lover about how you're feeling without him playing the martyr or self-flagellating, so that's definitely an aspect of your relationship you're going to have to work on for the future even if you don't get it in time to actually discuss how you're feeling now in the moment."
asexuality,30e2zy,Anti-DolphinLobby,7,Thu Mar 26 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention that because I'm pretty much the opposite, and I consider myself grey-ace (possibly demisexual). I'm aroused by attractive people's bodies, but I don't have the desire to have sex with them. Asexuality is such a wide spectrum"
asexuality,30e2zy,tiumtmra,16,Thu Mar 26 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"This sounds ace to me. Look up ""autochorissexualism"" too, it's basically a paraphilia when the idea of sex/erotic arouses you, but not imagining yourself in it, and it's not uncommon among aces. It sounds like you're not sexually attracted to your SO, but can be aroused by them, which is pretty cool, too. Maybe you're aroused by sex-talk, or the idea of your SO wanting to do stuff to you. It's all good. Welcome."
asexuality,30e2zy,fannarrativeftw,2,Thu Mar 26 23:18:43 2015 UTC,Yes!!!
asexuality,30e2zy,wildstripe,9,Fri Mar 27 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are closer to demisexual, however asexuality means different things to different people. I'm just about the opposite, I find the human body to be quite attractive, I just don't have any sexual attraction/desire towards people."
asexuality,30e2zy,paidgun,5,Thu Mar 26 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"What I know for myself is, there's kind of a disconnect between my brain and my body. Mentally I just don't feel so aroused, but physically everything is in order. I can look at bodies and never feel a thing, but if I'm making out with someone then my body responds. I still identify as asexual, perhaps very demi or slightly gray, and I'm also aromantic so that could factor in.   I always say, that really these labels are just words, sexuality is fluid, and it totally depends on you to decide your label at any point in time."
asexuality,30e2zy,AnyasCat,3,Fri Mar 27 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"Is it just arousal, or is it also attraction?  ie: when your SO tells you those things and you become aroused, do you also feel attracted to them sexually?  If you do feel attracted when thinking about sex or sexual acts as described, I think that's more likely a form of Demi-sexuality, Grey-Aexuality, or Secondary Sexual Attraction.  If it's just physical arousal, and not attraction, and not a desire to act on that arousal and have sex, that sounds like Asexuality with a fetish/kink for autochorissexualism."
asexuality,30e2zy,mundabit,5,Fri Mar 27 06:25:19 2015 UTC,"I think you can call yourself asexual, if you wish so, yep."
asexuality,30e2zy,ver_sacrum,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"This sounds just like me, except I have had no SO to speak of. I have experienced everything you mentioned you have. I have never felt non-emotional attraction to a person, but arousal at touch or imagined touch is common for me. Seems like everybody's different, but I must say, I'm glad to see there's someone like me out there :)"

And concentration...I can will myself to have an erection, or it happens when manipulating my penis or my nipples.  In fact, I had a huge erection while being pierced.  Having said that, it is not erotic imagery which causes it.  And the reaction seems to be automatic, unconscious, and not causally linked to anything specific."

asexuality,30e2zy,Tarfu,1 point,Fri Mar 27 09:15:44 2015 UTC,"Asexuality is just as much of a spectrum as any other sexuality. Some people are literally disgusted by sex, some just don't feel sexual attraction, some do but after a long emotional connection, etc.   For myself, the physical act of sex does 0% for me and is borderline gross but I can really get into porn/masturbation. And some asexual people are like that. Its complicated."
asexuality,30cqw6,YoungFolks,10,Thu Mar 26 08:38:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's normal to wonder whether we're really asexual. Unlike other sexual orientations, asexuality is the ""absence of something"", so how can you be 100% sure that you will NEVER have that ""something""? Perhaps you haven't found the right person yet... the possibility of being demisexual is always around the corner. But that's okay. Sexuality is fluid - for everyone, not only us aces! You can call yourself asexual, reminding yourself that this is your current state, not something that will necessarily last forever."

asexuality,30axo1,LoneWords,23,Wed Mar 25 22:08:09 2015 UTC,It's perfectly possible to be allosexual and sex-repulsed :)
asexuality,30axo1,Fire-Flowers,3,Wed Mar 25 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"Okay that's a new term, what's allosexual?"
asexuality,30axo1,RocketManV,11,Thu Mar 26 02:59:48 2015 UTC,Not ace.
asexuality,30axo1,SultanofShit,7,Thu Mar 26 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Allosexual is a term used to talk about a ""sexual orientation"" vs an asexual orientation.  It's a useful word instead of saying ""sexual"" (eg: ""I am asexual, But my friend is sexual"") because ""sexual"" also means ""sexually active"", so an asexual can say ""I am a sexual asexual because my partner and I are trying to conceive"" (or whatever) and that can be confusing if you think ""sexual"" is the opposite of asexual.  Allosexual is the opposite of asexual. ie: sexual."
asexuality,30axo1,mundabit,7,Thu Mar 26 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think that fits as asexual. Sexuality isn't how you feel about sex, it's what gender attracts you. Asexuality means being attracted to neither none, that's why there are asexuals that like sex and so on.  It's important to know if it's really sexual attraction, though. For some time, I thought I was attracted to others until I realized I felt weird for not being sexually attracted to anyone and was pushing simple aesthetic attraction to be something more, so it's not impossible to find out you're really asexual."
asexuality,30axo1,Kunobi,2,Thu Mar 26 05:45:33 2015 UTC,"being attracted to neither   ""neither"" isn't a good word because there are more than two genders."

asexuality,30axo1,mundabit,8,Sun Mar 29 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on why you don't like the act of sex.  If it's an opinion or attitude or sense of disgust or discomfort, You may be Allosexual but sex-repulsed or sex-averse. That's totally cool.  If it's a lack of desire, motivation or a deep rooted feeling of ""this isn't for me"" I consider that a form of Grey-A, (others may not)  If it's a lack of libido or drive making you disinterested in sex, Then it sounds like hypo-sexuality.   Regardless of whether you are allosexual, asexual, grey-A or what, Sex is always an optional choice. So as long as you are doing what feels right for you then labels don't really matter."
asexuality,30axo1,reria,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:28:18 2015 UTC,I think Im so disgusted by it that I don't want it and I have no problem going months and years without it but I can look at a girl and wish to be close to her in that way

asexuality,30axo1,peeksvillain,4,Thu Mar 26 02:02:36 2015 UTC,I feel this way. I don't think we're allo (which is just fancy speak for 'not asexual'). I think you can have a corporal sexual response which doesn't correspond to what your mind's eye desires. It's just like a trans* woman getting an erection. Does she want it? No. Does she have control over it? Even less. Just the cards dealt.
asexuality,30axo1,SultanofShit,2,Thu Mar 26 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"I am not OP, but I thank /u/LoneWords for asking this question.  In my circumstance, it is the realization that the men that I am sexually attracted to are, in general, not good partners for me.  I seem to be attracted to men with high sex drives, however, mine is low.  I would be happy with no more than once a week."
asexuality,30axo1,peeksvillain,12,Thu Mar 26 01:51:16 2015 UTC,Once a week? That's practically sex crazed.

If so, you're not asexual (nor demisexual, as I've read users have suggested). I'd say you're sex-repulsed. I think it's a bit strange to be allosexual and sex-repulsed. Why don't you like sex?"
asexuality,30axo1,SultanofShit,7,Thu Mar 26 07:51:15 2015 UTC,"This confused me before I knew about asexuality. I would feel aesthetic attraction + the urge for companionship, and not knowing how sexual attraction feels I would think ""this must be that."" We are trying to work things out by logic that other people know by instinct. It's a minefield."
asexuality,30axo1,DitaVonFleas,1 point,Thu Mar 26 08:03:08 2015 UTC,It's aesthetic and I want my body to touch hers but I don't want to have sex. Sex just everything about it feels like betrayal to me. Like she couldn't wait for me and I wish this meant more than it does and we are just going to break up and she'll do everything she did with me to someone else so I really just hate it with every mental faculty that we can't ever know 100% someone will stay loyal
asexuality,30axo1,iMoosker,2,Thu Mar 26 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"So you're disgusted by sex because you find it to be meaningless because you feel your relationships are always doomed and whoever you'd have sex with would just go on to have sex with someone else, making what you had together meaningless/less special?  If so, it sounds like you may need to talk to a professional about your insecurity with being in relationships and why you feel that betrayal is inevitable, because that's pretty much gotta be something separate from and affecting your sexuality rather than a function of your sexuality."

That this regrettable occurrence and breakup would set you in any way in particular beyond being hurt by the betrayal and breakup suggests that this relationship with sex that you're asking about isn't solely about your sexuality or labeling and that talking to someone who does this sort of thing for a living would be in your best interest.

Women who like short hair enough to overcome that pressure and those not interested in dating straight men, including lesbian women and some asexual women, have one less reason to have long hair even if they don't actually like it."

I don't wear my hair a certain way in order to broadcast my sexuality; I wear it a certain way because I think it makes me look hella cute.   It's the same for (mostly) everyone else. What we do with our bodies is for us... not for other people.  Also I've never heard of short hair being equated to asexuality. Mostly you just get called a lesbian, in my experience."
asexuality,30epzc,The_Enemys,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"It's the same for (mostly) everyone else.   I don't think it is; my understanding is that a lot of straight women who'd prefer short hair still have long hair because a lot of straight men prefer women to have long hair. Assuming this is true, asexual women would be at least a little more likely to have short hair not because short hair=asexual but because they've got one less pressure to have long hair."
asexuality,30epzc,JackfromAllstate,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:47:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I don't think most women base their haircut on attracting men, sexual or not. I think most base it on how they like it, with some influence from other people both men and women."
asexuality,30epzc,DefinitelyNotwafle,5,Fri Mar 27 18:36:50 2015 UTC,Where are you from where you only know one girl with short hair??? I know so many. It's quite common and has nothing to do with sexuality.
asexuality,30epzc,paidgun,3,Thu Mar 26 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"Thats a very strange reason that that woman gave. I'm a male and I have long hair, it goes down to just below the chest. Hair I believe is separate from sexuality. I was growing my hair to be long 3 years before I realized I was asexual."
asexuality,30epzc,Sewati,2,Thu Mar 26 21:16:29 2015 UTC,"I'm growing increasingly frustrated with my receding hairline, but I'm certain it has nothing to do with who I do or don't find sexually attractive.  I also like to keep my appearance in check, despite the fact that I'm not using it to woo any prospective partners. It also has nothing to do with who I do or don't find sexually attractive.

asexuality,30epzc,immitation_emulation,3,Thu Mar 26 23:24:51 2015 UTC,Many men prefer long hair. Many men prefer short hair. Most women believe the former. Many cultures associate long hair with beauty and strength. Many do not. Just do you and stop worrying :) you can always change it!

asexuality,30epzc,MaiTerra,5,Fri Mar 27 07:37:33 2015 UTC,"I keep my hair how I like it, to look good as I see it.  Despite lacking sexual attraction, there is great pleasure in being attractive. It conjures confidence and security if you can muster it. I may not want sex, but I want to look good. Thankfully, I have a thick head of hair with generous volume — adoring aesthetic attraction, I would feel it to be a personal tragedy if I just kept growing it to an unkempt or shaved it all away. Lovingly groomed and styled hair is wonderful.  & if some people don't see their physical attractiveness as important because they're asexual, then so be it. They can do as they choose, and I can as well. No harm and no foul in both cases."
asexuality,30epzc,SultanofShit,2,Thu Mar 26 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"I have long hair, about shoulder-length, because short hair needs more maintenance. I keep it in a ponytail. It's the most practical for me, but maybe that's because I'm used to it."

Your resentment will only get worse if you don't talk with him, and he will probably get that there's something wrong. Not understanding why, he might get mad at you, or get sad, any way your relationship with him will become more difficult. Since you don't see him often during your week, try to distance yourself a little from him so that you can keep calm and relax a bit. Think about what you want to tell him and especially how.

Be honest with yourself, too, if you really enjoy the intimacy at all times, or sometimes only do it to make him feel good/to not feel guilty towards him. Because that's not healthy, especially not for you, and could harm you in the long run.   I went to sleep 30 minutes before him and when he came into bed he woke me up and initiated it while I kinda lay there half asleep, finished, rolled over and went to sleep when I went to clean myself up   Sorry to say it (no, not really), but this filled me with resentment towards him.

I may be asexual, but I'm not stupid I can see when something is not done out of mutual desire for each other. I also wouldn't hug and kiss somebody who is just there, half-asleep or simply not into it, but many women, ace or not, actually hear the advice ""Just lie there and relax, think of something else"" even in this day and age (I mean, this is the kind of advice I got before I knew I was asexual, also that women just have to try something, sexually, and do something to make the other happy even if we don't like it, because it is selfish to not fulfill his ""needs""/desires, etc.). Sorry, it just makes me very angry, but mostly sad! Didn't mean to rant but it happened, oh well.  (I don't mean this to be against OP's SO or anything, I don't know him!

asexuality,308wx2,areyoudancingatall,3,Wed Mar 25 22:14:37 2015 UTC,Did you tell your partner before you started the  relationship? How did you tell them?
asexuality,308wx2,areyoudancingatall,5,Wed Mar 25 23:56:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, whilst we were ""dating"". I think I said something along the lines of ""there's something you probably need to know about me, I'm asexual. Doesn't mean I can't sometimes enjoy sex, but it is different for me. Here's some information about it"" and sent him links.  With my ex I only found out what asexuality was a few years in. His libido was extreme, and it was incredibly stressful for me. When I stumbled across AVEN and realized there were others out there with my difficulties, I told him ""I think I'm asexual"" and showed him the site. He was a bit angry/disappointed but we tried to make it work, and did, for another 6 years or so, but we shouldn't have. That kind of libido difference just isn't compatible. There was so much hidden stress and resentment going on, it was like a cancer in the relationship. So glad to be out of it now."
asexuality,308wx2,prysmyr,4,Thu Mar 26 08:07:06 2015 UTC,"My partner has known I'm asexual from the beginning and he's really understanding of it, which I appreciate. And I'm a lot like you in that I enjoy the closeness it brings and sometimes I even enjoy the act itself. But I also agree that sometimes his excitement for sex gets on my nerves (well, it used to, not so much anymore), and for me, definitely the only thing to do was talk about it. I was very direct with him and told him I felt used sometimes, like a human sex toy, and even though I don't mind sex, I also don't seek it out so I can't always understand his desire to have sex. (When we first got together, he thought that by us having sex meant I wasn't asexual anymore, but he's learned all about asexuality now.) I had really high resentment at one point especially until a close friend kind of coached me through what to say to him. And having that conversation with him worked! I think he was kind of confused by our sexual differences at first, but now he's much more respectful of me in that way, and I feel much better about our whole relationship.   So it seems to me that would be the best option for you, too. As another commenter said, if you don't speak up and say how you feel, it will get worse and you might feel more guilty than you do."

asexuality,308wx2,ExtraWingyScapula,3,Fri Mar 27 03:55:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it was kind of a hodgepodge of things because I got pretty emotional about it, but I'll try to sum up the gist of it and hopefully you can pull some insight from it. I have anxiety, too, and that day we were talking about me feeling anxious and then I brought up the sex part of things, and that's when I felt used, especially because my anxiety makes me worry about things in a more heightened way than it does for him. So hearing him say certain things to me about sex, even things like him telling me I'm sexy or making harmless sex jokes, sometimes made me feel like sex was all I was good for. I knew that wasn't true, but at the same time I still couldn't get it out of my head.  I remember hesitating for a split second and taking a deep breath and telling him that just because I like sex sometimes doesn't mean I always do, and it doesn't mean I'm willing to do it all the time. I said sometimes his jokes/comments make me feel like an object and it's not a fun feeling. I said sometimes during sex I'll just hit this wall out of nowhere and suddenly feel detached, where nothing is fun anymore and I want him to stop (sometimes I'll let him finish, sometimes not; this is another anxiety dependent thing).  Over the course of our relationship I've talked to him extensively about asexuality and aromanticism and how I view all of this stuff, and genuinely, introducing it all to him slowly but persistently is the best way it could have gone for me. It made me incredibly nervous at first because I also didn't know how he was going to take it. But being honest and telling him exactly how I felt at least gets it out there, and it makes everything so much better. If you make it clear having this conversation with him is very important to you, he should be concerned and listen and understand if he really cares about you.  Hope that helps a little. And good luck; I hope everything works out for you. Feel free to message me, too, if you want. :)"
asexuality,308wx2,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Fri Mar 27 04:16:06 2015 UTC,"The only hint he has of it is my friend saying something about me being asexual when she was a bit drunk- he looked surprised and a bit distressed.    No shit.  :P  Finding out one's lover is asexual and isn't interested in sex and not even finding it out from them is quite distressing to an allosexual man with a moderate to high sex drive.  And, y'know, all the more reason for you to get on the ball and talk to this guy.  Granted, the fact that he hasn't talked to you about sex, your sexual desires, and so on or picked up on how you're not into having sex with him is kind of a less than good sign as far as his potential as a longterm partner even if you were both allosexual.  Seeing as it's almost been a year now, and all.   I know I need to tell him but I don't know how without hurting him.   Doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're not hurt(and if you think he'll hurt you for being asexual, then you just need to get out of there) and you get it out in the open while there's a chance to communicate and maybe work through things if both of you are interested in doing so or at least break up amicably rather than with recrimination which is going to be what happens if you just keep on resenting him quietly.  Tell him you need to talk to him about something about yourself or that's been weighing on your mind that's important to the relationship that needs to be cleared up sooner rather than later so the two of you can go on together with some resolution and if he's not up to talking about something serious then and there, get him to agree to a place and time for it within the next few days."

We broke up both times. One was abusive and the other was just using me, though I should have seen that coming honestly. I was too scared of the first to ever say anything, and the second, well, we weren't really together for long.  Back then, my resentment came out in drawings (I'm an artist). Drawing vent art helped me cope with my feelings, and I didn't really address them until months after the second guy left.   Now, I'm with my partner who knows I'm asexual. We get intimate sometimes but my resentment stems from things I see online or in public, etc. To deal with it I usually vent about it to my boyfriend or draw more art, find myself a happy place. It doesn't really help but.. sometimes finding someone who understands your frustrations and listens to you without judgment is a lot of help and comfort -- it feels your opinions and feelings are valid."
asexuality,308wx2,ExtraWingyScapula,-2,Fri Mar 27 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"So you're lying to him and blaming HIM for not knowing? This is why I think asexuals shouldn't date sexual people. The asexuals go along with sex, the sexual is oblivious, and suddenly BAM the asexual springs the ""I don't like sex"" thing on the sexual partner. Yet...it's the sexual's fault for some odd reason.  Tell him, ""I'm asexual and I am not into sex"". If he leaves, deal with it. No one should be miserable."

asexuality,307rb3,Blikatin,18,Wed Mar 25 03:37:03 2015 UTC,Arousal nonconcordance is pretty common. Your body may respond to stimuli without your mind having any desire to go along with that response. Physical reactions don't mean anything about what you want or what you're feeling emotionally at that moment.
asexuality,307rb3,narrativedilettante,10,Wed Mar 25 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"You could even enjoy sex and be asexual. Or have a high libido or no libido. Asexuality is about the sexual attraction you don't feel. That's all. Just like romantic attraction is different from sexual attraction, your libido and sex interest is separate too.   Welcome to the club~"
asexuality,307rb3,PirateAceOfHearts,5,Wed Mar 25 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"I do get erections, which seems like it would be the line between asexuality and allosexuality. Is that right?   Nope. The presence of erections is how you know your reproductive system is working as intended, and you aren't suffering from any sexual dysfunction.  Just like if a gay man put his penis in a vagina, It would probably still feel good and stay hard, But a gay man wont be enjoying that on the level a straight man would. Hence genital function has nothing to do with your sexuality.  Asexuality as an orientation is solely about who or what you are sexually attracted to, so as long as the answer is ""no one"" you are asexual (answers like ""mostly no one"" may be Grey-Asexual)   For example, I'm asexual, I don't feel sexually attracted to anyone. But when I'm snuggling with my SO I get aroused, blood rushes to my genitals, My nipples and clitoris become erect and I secrete more lubricating fluid than usual. In an allosexual, this response would then translate to a cognitive thought of ""I'm aroused, I want sex"" But as an asexual with no sexual motivation, I just like ""Oh, I'm aroused, that's cool, this snuggling feels great"".  I have had sex (for reasons other than attraction and lustful desire)  and I have had orgasms, and it feels good, This doesn't make me allosexual, because I still lack sexual attraction.  I have a high libido, I get horny due to hormonal fluctuations (ovulation) and I masturbate to deal with that (also, as mentioned before, orgasms feel good) This also doesn't make me allosexual, Because I still lack sexual attraction.  I like to summarise it like this. Sexuality comprises of Attraction (Orientation), Drive (Libido), Motivation (Desire), Behaviour (Expression) and Opinion (Attitude). Each of these elements help to carve out your full sexual identity, But only Attraction will define your sexual orientation. You can have a variety of combinations such as having no attraction, no drive and no motivation, but having very sexual behaviour, It doesn't change your orientation."

Is that right? I don't really want to have sex with anyone, but does the fact that I still get aroused in those types of situations denote that I'm not actually asexual?   This is exactly what kept me from 'officially' calling myself asexual when I first researched it, but I eventually learned (not the same way as you though) about the very thin line between plain arousal and full-on sexual attraction.  Needless to say, you're still asexual given what you described.  Always a pleasure to take in new recruits :)."

asexuality,302qfo,vough,12,Tue Mar 24 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"I think your metaphor is apt. It's like atheism not being a religion, but a lack of religion. Asexuality isn't really a sexuality so much as it is a lack of one. So what is a lack of a door? A wall.   But the way Asexuality is posed in society, it's like a wall with a door frame nail-gunned onto it."
asexuality,302qfo,DratThePopulation,6,Tue Mar 24 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"I kind of like the food metaphors myself.  Like some people enjoy vanilla ice cream, some people enjoy chocolate, and some people don't want to eat ice cream at all.  This isn't to say that the window/door analogy is bad, it just doesn't quite click in my head, personally.  Also, the ""door with a lock"" thing makes me think of chastity belts, haha.  EDIT :  Also had the thought after I posted, that a ""wall"" can have an implicitly negative connotation, and a ""door"" can be implicitly positive, which may affect the tone of your paper a little.  A ""wall"" implies segregation and isolation to me, like the awesome Pink Floyd album, and it can be even worse if you apply the metaphor to a person (""you're so boring, talking to you is like talking to a brick wall"").  On the other hand, a door is usually a positive object, it's something you walk through to get somewhere.  I dunno, just some thoughts from my brain."
asexuality,302qfo,stone_cold_stoic,2,Tue Mar 24 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"Despite how common it is, I must agree that the food analogy is quite perfect. Not only does it visually explain sexuality using a topic everyone knows about, it can also explain other aspects.  For example, the fact that some people are sex willing might be, ""I   eat ice cream sometimes, but only with my SO because I want to spend time together and this is an activity that shows that I love them.""  It also works well because everyone can think of a food that they saw and were curious about the taste. They knew they probably wouldn't like it at first, but they were still curious anyways. Or, they tried it because they were expected to like it by society. This explains asexuals who have had sex before.  To respond to OP, one issue I can think of with your analogy is that  if asexuality is a wall, then having sex might be seen as breaking a hole through the wall (to create a ""door""). This implies that having sex is something that has an irreversible effect on your sexuality, while for many asexuals it only reaffirmed their suspicions. Perhaps you can find a way to address this. Otherwise, it's not like every analogy is perfect and for the most part yours sounds pretty solid."

It makes asexuality look as lack of sexual intercourses, as if you will never ever be able to have sex with an asexual, while asexuality is mainly like of sexual attraction. Perhaps it is only in my twisted mind, ahah? I don't know, it still is one of the few metaphors that somehow can describe asexuality, also this   In the end, they're all part of the same house.   sounds very nice, so you should go for it."
asexuality,302qfo,dragon-storyteller,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"No analogy is perfect. The door-wall analogy might suggest that asexuals aren't capable of having sex at all, or that we are necessarily segregated from the rest of society becaue of that. The food metaphor can suggest that sex is something absolutely needed in one's life unless you are an asexual. The sports metaphor puts one sexuality against the other, as if there was a need to fight.  There is no perfect analogy, so it's all up to you to choose which one you like the best."

asexuality,302qfo,dragon-storyteller,2,Thu Mar 26 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"I think playing was supposed to be sexual attraction instead of sex itself, so aces would be watching everyone without actually having any attraction themselves.

Everyone is talking about it. It seems to have become one of the single most popular things in the world. Massive amounts of music are written about it. People want to go see it as often as they can. It's supposedly better if you see it with someone else. People even make movies and stories about this movie (porn).  Yet you can't see it, no matter what. The theater is always closed when you get there, the equipment doesn't work, you haven't managed to see or hear any part of it. All you have to go on is other peoples descriptions and depictions. You can't see it by yourself, with someone else, nothing. You've even had people invite you to go with them in the past, but you couldn't accept because what good would that do, if you can't even get there yourself? (Around here is where the metaphor starts to break down.)  At first you're curious. You want to get there. You read people's descriptions, if only out of curiosity. You want to understand. Eventually you get resentful. This is hardly fair. Why does everyone else get to see it but you can't? As much as you want to, you can't see it or understand it at all. You use sour grapes- you tell yourself it's probably not that good anyway. Those grapes I can't reach are probably sour.  You start telling yourself you don't care, even if it you really do. You're going to tell yourself you don't care until the day it becomes the truth.  So, sexual people, I have this to say: FUCK YOUR MOVIE. I bet it has terrible internal consistency. And the actors forget to zip their jackets between takes."

It will advertise things about you that aren't necessarily true.  The truth is, you don't have to choose a label and it is better to be label-free than to live under the wrong label. It's perfectly okay to say ""I just need to be single for awhile"" without adopting a label. Post-long-term relationship, a lot of people want to be single for awhile so they can reacquaint themselves with who they are as a person."

Doing so would be incredibly disrespectful towards lesbians and homophobic as hell. I'm asexual and like women more than men (and I was in a year long relationship with a guy just like you were), that doesn't make me a lesbian, but there's a word for that, if you need one: biromantic.   Be yourself, enjoy your freedom, come to terms what you want or don't want. But don't be that kind of person who likes men but wants to call herself a lesbian because it sounds cool."

As far as Asexuality goes, same cup of tea, If you translate the Kinsey scale to romantic attraction, OP sounds like a 4 or 5, so it's totally up to her to choose if she likes Lesbian or Biromantic better.   But that decision has to be made based on OP's attraction to other people, not the aesthetics of the word itself, that would be disrespectful.  But Yes, OP does have to acknowledge that she has sporadic attraction to men, It doesn't have to be an acknowledgement when first disclosing her sexuality, But if she is going to get involved with a partner, it needs to be discussed out of respect to women who are Kinsey 6."

On top of that they have lesbian women judging them for their bisexuality,  when all they are trying to do is love their girlfriend.   I feel like society applies reverse standards to men and women when it comes to sexuality.  A straight man sucks one dick out of curiosity,  people will label him as gay (even though we know he's not) meanwhile a lesbian fucks one guy out of curiosity and suddenly she can't be a lesbian anymore.   Likewise,  80% of the people I have loved have been women,  but I can't call myself a homosexual because of that 20% part that isn't.

You define that point as being when she exclusively only likes women.  That's the purest definition, I'll agree with that. But sexuality doesn't have walls,  to me,  the point when you can start identifying as ""gay""  is when the vast majority of your attraction is directed at the same sex.   You think my definition is wrong,  that's fine.  I can see where you are coming from and knowing (not first hand,  but through witnessing)  the  struggles you likely went through as a lesbian woman I understand why you are selective about the sort of people that join the community that is ""gay and lesbian"" because you have worked hard to build safe spaces with people who have had similar experiences and similar feelings.  But I like my opinion,  I feel it is a good balance between respecting the definition of homosexuality while still allowing for the grey scale.

If we went by what you said then we'd be telling every confused soul that comes here to not label themselves till they are sure that's what they actually are even if they don't feel comfortable with that label, cause then I'd be offensive to the ppl that do identify themselves with that label.   You are telling her that her sexuality can't change and she can't pick a label that suits her at the moment because it could potentially turn offensive later on. That's also kind of disrespectful.   I get were you are coming from but that's not the way to do it, because things are never black and white and if an asexual homoromantic wants to identify himself as basically gay and later disclosed to his would be partner that he just isn't that interested in sex, he can.

Maybe the right guy will come along later, maybe he never will and instead the right gal does. So the label of lesbian is never contested.   Just as there are lesbians who suppress it because of social bullshit, which unfortunately happens way too often.   If her entire reasoning for choosing lesbian was cause the word looks pretty, then yeah that's messed up, but it isn't.

I think there's nothing wrong if you want to label yourself as a lesbian. One of the main reasons to use labels is to make others understand quickly what (who) do you like. If you label yourself as a lesbian, though, most people won't think you also like men (even if you don't like them often). Is that what you want? And also, what if you tell others you're lesbian and, let's say a year from now, you find a male SO? As I said, there's nothing wrong in labeling yourself as a lesbian per se, but think about the consequences (this goes for any important matter, obviously, not only for this one!). Perhaps you could just tell others you don't want to date for the time being. This way people of both sexes/genders will leave you alone. Try to think about it when you feel calm (: good luck!"

If you are a lesbian, be a lesbian.  If you are bisexual, be bisexual.  Be proud of it.  Hide it.  Repress it.  March in a parade and shout it from the rooftops.

asexuality,2zyf74,paidgun,2,Mon Mar 23 00:55:10 2015 UTC,"My best guess is related to this: Near the end of middle school, I noticed a girl. She was intelligent and affable and I found myself wondering if I had a crush on her. I didn't think about her outside of class, and I felt nothing the typical stories describe, but for whatever reason she stood out to me. I was eventually paired up with her for an assignment and I found that due to second-guessing myself about this, I would stutter and couldn't look her in the eye.  I decided I absolutely hated this. I hated being told by the sex ed courses that I would be driven by my hormones, I hated being told that men think with their dicks and I hated that I couldn't even talk to someone without coming off like a fool. So, I decided to make a conscious effort to ignore girls for the next couple years in the sense that I wouldn't look at them unless they were engaging with me.  In short, I am really adverse to the idea of being led around by a sex drive. On the other hand, this experience makes me wonder if I managed to smother my sexuality. The reason I doubt if it was a crush is that certain girls have stood out to me since, but looking back, they tended to be the most talkative ones in class.   In any case, I'm glad that as an adult I no longer feel like an idiot when talking to women."
asexuality,2zyf74,desertxsnow,6,Mon Mar 23 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"Opinions and attitudes about sex don't comprise asexuality, It's very possible to be an allosexal person but still have negative, averse attitudes toward sex. Don't let your opinion of sex confuse your about your orientation, But rather, let your opinion guide your sexual expression and behaviour.  Opinions on sex are generally divided into two categories, Sex positive and sex negative.  Each categories has sub-categories.  Regardless of the exact terminology, it sounds like you have a sex-negative opinion (don't let the word ""negative"" bother you, there is nothing wrong with this attitude)  Sex Negativity tends to be summarised with ""Sex repulsed"" (also called ""sex averse"") and ""Sex Avoidant"". The former is when you are actively disgusted, turned off, or made uneasy by the thought of sex or sexual implications, or sexual imagery. Sex Avoidant is where you would rather not come into contact with sex or sexual imagery, and you aren't going to be super comfortable, but if you have to, you can tolerate it.  Sex indifference is neither positive nor negative, this is how I feel about day to day sexual imagery, I couldn't care less, It doesn't bother me, nor does it benefit me. sex-willingness sometimes falls in this category, You don't desire sex, But you are willing to have sex if it can be beneficial (eg: starting a family).  Sex positivity can be Sex-seeking or Sex-Supportive, You seek out sex or sexual imagery and enjoy it, Or you don't seek out sex, but you are supportive of the prevalence of sex or sexual imagery and are comfortable with the amount of sex in society."

Though this sub too, I have a few penpals and skype friends.  I live in an LGBT friendly city, so diving headfirst into that scene tends to open more doors, If you tag along as an ""ally"" then no one outside the group has to know you are in the closet as something other than heterosexual. It's easier to get involved now with Queer youth groups, make friends even with people who are allosexual and alloromantic, and then when you leave highschool you will have a connection to the broader gay community, which is more aware of ""A is for Asexuality and ally"".   I lost a lot of my connections, and while asexuality is covered in my local communities it's harder to break in when you are not also gay or lesbian or trans, Because asexual people (like bisexual people in heterosexal relationships) ""Pass"" for straight."

I have more time to focus on the things that I think are interesting without having it interrupted by sexuality.

I've noticed that the way I see the opposite sex (women) has changed.  I'm not a social person, outside of my family I only really talk to co-workers.  Before identifying as asexual, sex was kind of an undercurrent in my conversations with, and perceptions of, female co-workers.  The concept of sex colored my thought process.  My words, mannerisms, etc. were usually engineered in a ""steer things toward a sexual encounter if possible"" kind of way (compliments on physical appearance whenever possible, things like that).  This was strange because I wouldn't want to have sex even if the opportunity presented itself, I guess I was just mimicking what everyone else seems to do.  I no longer feel any compulsion to do this kind of thing, because sex is a conscious non-issue for me.  I'll talk to a female coworker and the undercurrent of sex is gone, and the conversation seems more genuine and simple to me, so that's kind of cool."
asexuality,2zvlzn,ver_sacrum,3,Sun Mar 22 20:27:37 2015 UTC,"I'll approach this question as:  How has *identifying** as asexual changed the way you see the world  While many aces say ""I always knew I didn't want sex so I just it didn't affect me at all really"", I was relieved yet distressed at the same time.  My lack of sexual interest was always something that I told myself I would ""grow out of"" and learning that it was an actual sexual orientation initially distressed me because I knew I wouldn't ""grow out of it"" and that was A LOT to take in. (I had always considered myself heterosexual because I didn't know Ace was an option)  After all the distress settled down, I was relieved. I could be at peace with myself finally knowing that the way I felt was okay and that there was a whole community just like me.   How I see the world? I see it like most people, but I do step back occasionally and say to myself, ""gosh, all the sexuallizaiton in advertising and media is so F**king weird""  NOTE: I understand that I am the one with the rare view of things and I am the weird one, not 99% of the population.

asexuality,2zxhv1,Wishstarz,11,Sun Mar 22 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"Hey! I just wanted to comment on a few things within your post that I thought were a bit problematic   In fact, I am annoyed that people take the romantic orientations (I believe it was designed for asexuals so that it simplifies things because some asexuals still want to date)   I disagree; it was designed by asexuals, but not for asexuals. It was designed for everyone. Typically, sexual and romantic orientations match, but that's not always the case. As you pointed out, asexuality is a huge one, while aromantics are a huge part of the asexual community, they aren't a majority. And while asexuals are a huge part of the aromantic community, they aren't a majority either. But, even for alloromantic allosexuals, romantic and sexual orientation are different concepts, and they don't always align. Someone can be bisexual, but only interested in dating one gender. But the main reason isn't about dating other people; these labels were created as a sense of identity. So that people can find other people like them, and also claim that they are human, regardless of how society tries to make them feel. It allows someone to have a grasp on their identity, something that can be enormously comforting in a world that often makes people who aren't heterosexual, heteroromantic, and cisgender feel very out of place.   the identity isn't useful for other person to know (unless you are dating) because it doesn't matter whether you are straight, gay, bi or ace because we care more about things like personality   I would argue that it IS extremely useful for someone else to know, for a few reasons; 1) Building awareness. Most people have no idea what it is. And that's a huge problem. Especially since so many people are asexual and don't realize it; if you look through stories from people within the asexual community, one of the most common narratives you'll find is that so many people feel broken, because they never realized that asexuality is a legitimate identity. Visibility is essential. 2) The whole ""let's be blind to orientation"" thing is the type of talk that makes people exaggerate the gains that activism has achieved. The fact is, you can't create equality by trying to undermine the inequality. We have to acknowledge that, yes, while asexuals, and other MOGAI groups, are like heterosexual, heteroromantic, cisgendered people, we are also different, and so diverse. There needs to be conversation to emphasize the vast diversity of humans, rather than pretending we're all the same. Without that, it collectivizes human experiences, and each individual's story becomes lost.   yes, asexuals are not oppressed but the awareness again is not for oppression points but rather for spaces and benefits   I think this severely glosses over the problems asexuals face. Depression, suicide, and dehumanization are all such big hurdles that asexuals and aromantics, just like others on the MOGAI spectrum, face. This has been documented as well; people are less likely to give jobs to asexuals, rent to asexuals, etc. I think this would be a good read to illustrate the dehumanization and prejudice asexuals face.. Also, certain states have laws that are actually relatively recent (within the last 10 years or so, so it's a new phenomenon) that require a couple to have sex for their marriage to be valid. Obviously, this isn't the type of thing any government is going to check; the law is on the books for discrimination reasons only. Asexuals have been denied adoptions, fired because of their orientation (something that is, as of now, allowed under federal law). A huge danger is corrective rape; like many other people on the MOGAI spectrum, asexuals are often raped just because the belief that it may ""fix"" them. And to say that asexuals aren't opressed or don't face difficulties in a way marginalizes these struggles that asexuals face, and these very real problems that need to be discussed. Awareness needs to be built up, not in the realms of spaces and benefits, but in the daily issues and discrimination asexual people face."
asexuality,2zxhv1,BytorL,0,Sun Mar 22 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"hmm, okay that's very helpful, thank you for your insight. In fact it's better than most other people who give liek a criticism with no detail.  if they're bi but prefer dating one kind wouldn't that make them either gay or straight? (tbh, I was going to let it pass the bi's since it helps them but the problem is if I grant it to them why not gay or straight and I want to avoid this whole complication)  the main reason I don't think we should just hand out the identity, freely because honestly, people treat asexuality as a joke, not because they might not understand it but it's because of the dreaded SJWs and other fake people in this way: I have seen cases where people claim to be asexual to deny sex (as opposed to just saying no - now I know you will say rape will happen, but it's just gonna get more complicated so it's a completely different discussion). Also people can claim to be anything under the asexual spectrum and we can't say if they're lying or not. Now I'm all for like you can be this or that but they just do horrible things (hypocrisy namely) such that it actually makes groups like asexuals and transgender people look like a joke. do you get what I mean? (think of Westboro Baptist Church onto Christianity, for example)  and yea, I guess asexuals do face discrimination (different word), though and I don't know right now, it's still 'relatively new' (even though 14 years is a lot). There are still a lot of things we don't know yet and this once again is why asexuality (awareness) is very important and I still hope to learn more about asexuality."
asexuality,2zxhv1,BytorL,3,Sun Mar 22 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"if they're bi but prefer dating one kind wouldn't that make them either gay or straight? (tbh, I was going to let it pass the bi's since it helps them but the problem is if I grant it to them why not gay or straight and I want to avoid this whole complication)   It still is very different-- because, they may want sex with different genders, or they may find different genders sexually attractive, but in terms of dating, they don't-- which means that, in terms of sexual attraction, they're bisexual, but in terms of romantic attraction, hetero or homo romantic.    the main reason I don't think we should just hand out the identity, freely because honestly, people treat asexuality as a joke, not because they might not understand it but it's because of the dreaded SJWs and other fake people in this way: I have seen cases where people claim to be asexual to deny sex (as opposed to just saying no - now I know you will say rape will happen, but it's just gonna get more complicated so it's a completely different discussion).   I think you're talking about people mistaking celibacy for asexuality- I've seen that happen, but never in terms of self labeling. So I've seen people call other people asexual when they really weren't, but it's incredibly rare (I've never seen or heard of it) for someone to call themself asexual when they mean celibate. In fact, I would argue this is an even more important reason for visibility; so people can actually know to label themselves. Moreover, I think that, even if we were to accept that some people may mistakenly label themselves asexual, the most accurate system overall is one of self-labeling; I can determine my identity wayyyy better than anyone else can, just because I am the one living my experiences. Someone else can't know for me what I've experienced; I can only decide that on my own. And it'd be awful if anyone were to police my identity, because they'd effectively be saying ""no, you can't say that; we know better than you, and your experiences are invalid"". And I don't think it's right to invalidate anyone's experiences or identities.  Moreover, I think issues like corrective rape need to be part of disccusion about asexuality. It's an issue asexuals face. It is a complicated issue, but it is also an extremely serious issue. I shouldn't think we would want to skip discussing it, or gloss over it; it's very, very real   Also people can claim to be anything under the asexual spectrum and we can't say if they're lying or not.   We can't know if they're lying, that's true. But I don't see why anyone would. Nobody wants to face the discrimination we face as asexuals. To me, insinuating that asexuals are lying about their identity is akin to insinuating that gay people are lying about theirs; why would someone CHOOSE to be something that causes so much discrimination?  People can lie, but each individual is still a better judge of their own identity than some arbitrary ""identity police"" is. And I, for one, have talked to so many other asexual people, and gotten so much out of that. I wouldn't want to lose that just because of some arbitrary worry that ""oh they aren't actually asexual"".   Now I'm all for like you can be this or that but they just do horrible things (hypocrisy namely) such that it actually makes groups like asexuals and transgender people look like a joke. do you get what I mean? (think of Westboro Baptist Church onto Christianity, for example)   I think this is a reason to talk more about asexuality. I think in common media, people who aren't interested in sex are made to be the laughing-end on jokes; as in ""haha, how could they be like that, they're so robotic and lifeless and inhuman, haha"" (think characters like Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang Theory; these characters are often depicted to be almost completely robotic.). That's not really good; and that can only be overcome by voicing asexual concerns and asexual opinions. An episode of House said that asexuality didn't exist. How are we supposed to correct that without having an avenue for expressing activism? How are we supposed to correct all of these problems of asexual representation in society without letting people identify as asexual and speak about their experiences? It seems like you're denying them that opportunity.  With regards to Westboro Baptist Church and those groups- I would argue they're discriminatory. WBC hasn't issued a statement on asexuality, but there's several religious groups that discriminate against asexuality.  For example, take this Jesuit stance on asexuality:   Question: What do you call a person who is asexual? Answer: Not a person.   Like, that's so harsh and horrible to asexuals, and, I think contrary to what you are saying, DISCOURAGES people from identifying as asexual, even though they may actually be asexual. And I hate to imagine the emotional damage that may come about as a result of that.    and yea, I guess asexuals do face discrimination   I really don't like this.. Because I think again you're glossing over the struggles asexuals face. It's not like ""well yeah I guess""; we DO face difficulties, very real difficulties.    it's still 'relatively new' (even though 14 years is a lot).    In science, asexuality was first mentioned in the 40s with Kinsey's research (he referred to asexuality as group X). The label came about recently, but people have been identifying as asexuality much longer, with many historical figures (for example Samuel J Tilden, Nikola Tesla, Isaac Newton) making comments that could indicate they are asexual.   There are still a lot of things we don't know yet and this once again is why asexuality (awareness) is very important and I still hope to learn more about asexuality.   This is the part I don't really get. Because I don't think we can have awareness if we try to discourage people from identifying as asexual. We can't have representation and awareness if we police other people's identities. And we can't have awareness if we don't look to the experiences and difficulties asexual people face. We actually know a lot about asexuality; what we don't know, really, is the scientific underpinnings of exactly how it works, but to me, that's not important. We have what we need to know from the experiences of people who identify as asexual. And that's more than enough."

You have a right to privacy and your sex life is definitaly something you can chose to keep private. If this is your wish, then don't come out.  If you are directly asks, you can defer the question with ""what am I? I'm human, and whatever comes with that"" or simply ""My sex life is my business""  Personally I feel that if you are dating someone, you must come out at some point. Unfortunately it will be assumed that by dating someone you are sexually attracted to them, I think it's important to make sure you take away that assumption and build a relationship on the truth of what you have between you.    Personal stories.  I'm a treatment room nurse at a Sexual Health clinic. So sex is my life too, But I'm asexual. It's quite humorous, especially when I told my boss, It's just assumed that everyone at work has a healthy sex life, most of us are partnered. I got my IUD inserted at my own clinic so it was just assumed I was having sex. I casually let slip that I was asexual and after a quick ""wait, really? you? wow, you are so kinky I would never have guessed"" that was the end of the discussion.  I came out to my mother who did not understand it at all even after hours of explaining, but she did not try and tell me that I was wrong.  My dad doesn't even understand homosexuality so I simply haven't bothered to tell him.  I came out to my housemates because I had a platonic-quasi romantic crush on one of them and wanted to disclose that (The result is that we are now ""lesbi-friends"" and hold hands and snuggle often, while still considering our relationship platonic) the other housemate keeps asking ""have you fucked your partner yet?"" or ""ooooh, you and your partner going to bang?"" and it was getting quite annoying so I felt it necessary to shut him down with ""no, we are both asexual, we may have sex sometime in the future, who knows, but please don't pressure us or tease us like this"" and he did indeed back off.

The last one actually told me I was asexual, and had been my best friend for a long time.  Why tell you all this? Because that is my own personal experience with coming out. Some people will accept it, some people will not. Some people will misunderstand it, some people will embrace it. Some will let you discuss it with them, some will not. Whether you decide to ""come out"" or not will depend entirely on you and your relaitionships. How important is it? That depends on you."

Your mom's statement ""people might get the wrong idea"" is the exact reason you adopt a label. As an aromantic/ace, I look like a failure under the heterosexual label. Why doesn't she date? What's wrong with her? How can we find astrobean a man? Is she trying to hide that she's a lesbian? They were worried. They prayed. Their attention stressed me because at the time I believed I was heterosexual, and my experience didn't match what I was told to expect.  If you don't call yourself asexual, then people assume you're heterosexual, and that is the wrong idea. At this point, I think it's important that asexuals come out because until we gain visibility, people who come out will keep getting put back in the closet by those who don't believe the closet is real.  You don't have to be out and proud, parade down the street in your ace t-shirt out, but if someone asks, don't lie. If someone pesters you about your sex life (or lack there-of) put it out there. Bring it up when it's relevant to the conversation."

Hah. Anyways, after I came to terms with being asexual, I decided it wasn't really important to tell anyone except for partners. But, you know, when you're 30 and your parents are hounding you about grandkids, I guess that would pose more concern. I'd probably get flak for it but yeah, I would remind them ""Remember when I said I was asexual?"", but I've also expressed my dislike for children and my generally controlling personality, so. I wouldn't want me as a parent so I won't do that to some poor kid. lol"

asexuality,2zqx4l,flyonawall,5,Fri Mar 20 23:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yup,  Human Sexuality is the combination of attraction, orientation, desire, drive, motivation and motives, behaviour, expression, attitudes and opinions in relation to sex and sexual activities.  So if the root word ""sexuality"" is so broad, the word ""aSexuality"" as in, ""lacking sexuality"" can also be broad. You merely need to lack one aspect of sexuality, Such as orientation, or motivation, and you are technically asexual.  I do take issue with this though. Because I see asexuality as an orientation, I feel that to use ""asexual"" as a label you need to lack attraction or motivation or desire. I feel as though lacking drive and lacking behaviour or expression are not forms of asexuality in themselves. (In fact, only lacking drive is considered hypo-sexuality ie: ""no libido"")  But i'm not the label police, who am I to say someone can't or can't call themselves asexual. As long as everyone (aces, and general public) realise that some Ace's are asexual by orientation, others by drive, others by opinion (eg: sex-repulsed)  Me? I'm asexual by orientation and motivation, But sexual in behaviour, because I have sex for reasons other than attraction and desire. Many people would tell me that I am not asexual, so again, who am I to tell other people what they are?"

Just be clear that you aren't looking for a sexual relationship. I mean even something like ""I still have romantic feelings towards you"" sort of explains that you aren't necessarily looking for something sexual. i think it might be hard to go wrong with just telling her that you still have feelings, but not sexual towards her. (as long as she has no 'triggers' or anything towards being sexual it should be a straightforward conversation).  as a pan-romantic asexual myself, i view (romantic)relationships AS friendships (because they are), with an intimacy thats different from something platonic.   Or you could be like ""hey all i wanna do is cuddle with you and talk about cool things, you down?""   (just make sure she isnt still dating the other girl? don't be that guy)  i think that made sense"

I'm also just really concerned she'll think I'm just rebounding when in reality I'm just now free to pursue an interest I've had for our entire friendship.

Far too often we encounter people who see no distinction between the two (and then often jump to the misinformed conclusion that there must be something wrong with us >_>), so coming across the rare gem who can see that sex and romance are two completely separate things is often a huge relief."

Basically you both fill it, then share it and talk about it. It's fantastic to open up communications about pretty much every important aspect of a relationship, I found it because my girlfriend is aro but I believe it's very useful for any non-allosexual/romantic relationships :)"

Clueless at best, racist at worst.  Others can speak on clueless racism in the asexual community this far better than I can:   http://www.gradientlair.com/?tag=asexuality https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/interview-with-ianna-hawkins-owen/ http://asexualpocsunite.tumblr.com/post/84227019744/thingsthatmakeyouacey-it-kind-of-is-when-it#notes   Secondly, what you are describing is called non-libidoism.  That's the word that's been used for years.  If you want people to talk about what you're talking about it's probably a good idea to use the words they're already using, instead of picking an arbitrary color band off a random diagram that no one's actually seen (and which has very little resemblance to any asexuality discourse I'm aware of).  By calling the sub ""BlackAce"", no one is going to have any clue what it's about.  You're not going to attract people to talk about non-libidoism, which appears to be your goal (and which is certainly a topic worthy of a sub).  You are, however, going to attract black asexual people who are likely not going to be very happy when they find out that the sub isn't for or about them."
asexuality,2zn0lu,kraftlos,4,Sat Mar 21 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"Racist undertones aside, they are important to note, But the big issue is that the space is misleading. For one, Non libidoism is a separate element of sexuality, it's not connected with asexuality or being Ace at all. (though you can be both)  In this context, I know OP is trying to say that that if human sexuality is black and white with 50 shades of grey in between, then this is a space for those who's sexuality is black with no grey, then you need to establish what that means. What does a black and white, asexual and allosexual world look like?   Sexual drive ie: libido, does not define asexuality, so having no drive does not make someone a ""black ace"", just like having a sex drive does not automatically make you ""grey ace"""

Asexual meant ""without sexual"" long before it meant ""not attracted to gender"".   I do not like the term ""non-libidoism"" - it sounds like a disease and is associated with treating a lack of sex drive as a disease that needs to be cured or fixed.

I have yet to figure out some kind of workable solution to this besides finding a fellow aro friend (and the likelihood of this, not only to find another one in rl but one you just click with, is ridiculously low).   Because let's be honest here even when you tell your best friend your insecurities and they a sure you it won't happen to them, it's bs. It's not going to be intentional but it's gonna happen. And it's not like you can really blame them either. They have their romantic needs which you can't meet, so it's not fair to you or them, but it still freaking sucks.   Okay I'm done ranting now xD"

Sometimes, you aren't going to really like a person. It is how we are wired, and it is okay because your language is different from everyone else. I don't love my parents, but I may sometimes respect them. So, when I say I love you to them, it is a term of respect. When I say I love you to someone I am close to, it means I cherish my time with you. You just have to learn the language of your emotions. Once, you start recognizing your feelings. It should get easier to translate what you mean. I think this is where you are struggling, OP. This is my two cents. I hope it helps."

You have sex-positive aces and sex-repulsed aces and grey-aces and demisexuals and aromantics and aces lacking sex drive, all lumped together under the asexual banner. Might seem like a bad idea at first, but consider how small minority asexuals already are, and then imagine how much worse it would get if we fragmented into half a dozen or more smaller minorities. There aren't nearly enough asexuals for that, all the communities would be practically dead.  To answer your question, though, perhaps searching for 'nonlibidoist' would help?

I see the same paralel with people under the asexual banner versus other sexualities. Then again, I use my lack of sexual attraction to define myself, and I can see that it would be different if I used my libido for that.  And the people here, they have a tendency to go off on a tangent explaining things. No wonder they do, considering just how many ""How, I'm a newbie, am I ace?"" posts are there.

Your last post was about how much we talk about sex, but I don't see that changing in a different sub, because the world we all navigate is still sexual. Why do you think we would have different experiences and misunderstandings? Having a libido doesn't make an ace inherently more likey to have sex... I just don't see the source of the problem. Is there a way to add a flair in this sub for ""no libido"" or something? That could probably help. All aces don't experience sexual attraction, that's why we're all here together, regardless of libido (which has nothing to do with behaviour in terms if whether an ace has sex)."
asexuality,2zghin,redneckgymrat,3,Wed Mar 18 23:07:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, the world we navigate is sexual but that does not mean we have to always be focused on sex and talking about that.  Would you enjoy sitting in a bar where are they talk about is football when you have absolutely no interest in football?  Worse, most seem to thing a lack of interest in football is an illness.  Most people seem to see a ""low libido"" as a medical condition, thus something to fix.  That may be true for some people but I don't think it is true for all.  Can you imagine that?  If you have a normal libido, you probably cannot imagine someone without it.  Someone without a sex drive may also want to talk about it from a much different perspective than someone with a sex drive, if they do want to discuss it.    Simply put, no sex drive is a world away from someone with a sex drive and they will approach and see the world very differently.  It is fine to interact, but those groups are not the same at all.  Just the fact that you cannot see this is very telling.  For someone who has a libido, their world seems to revolve around satisfying that and they cannot understand someone who is not also focused on sex.  I can (am forced to) interact with the sexual world all the time.  I just don't need that here.     I am not trying to change what you do here, I am just looking for something else."

asexuality,2zdpss,nirenem,6,Sat Mar 21 14:41:22 2015 UTC,The arousal is just normal healthy body/junk doing what it does. Being on testosterone just increased the frequency/degree to which it happens. It's just puberty - a breeze can get you hard.
asexuality,2zdpss,YoungFolks,3,Wed Mar 18 05:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a cis woman, also ace but with no libido. A few years ago I got my hormone levels checked (unrelated to my libido/sexuality) and my free testosterone was ""pushing the ceiling"" for the normal range for women. I was always confused by that, because I know that testosterone therapy increases libido."
asexuality,2zdpss,vurpine,3,Wed Mar 18 06:22:34 2015 UTC,"Testosterone is the kind of thing that has to be in a specific range to get the expected results. Too little testosterone, low libido. Too much testosterone, low libido. There's a goldilocks zone, so to speak, in between--but what that range is varies from person to person. Testosterone therapy is intended to bring your testosterone levels up from a presumed low level (since that's more common than having levels too high)."

I've known some people to get really defensive when getting hormone levels checked is suggested in response to learning about asexuality. I understand defending against the idea that asexuality is a disorder or condition, which yes most the people who make said suggestion probably see it that way, but there is a chance that asexual-like behavior/feelings(?) is a symptom of something bigger that may hinder quality of life.  If/when you start treatment you may notice feeling better overall, especially if you were also feeling regularly fatigued before. Let us know how it goes."

I always considered myself on the graysexual spectrum because I liked sex, but I never was attracted/wanted to do it with anyone.  I love to bottom because it feels great, but I never held an erection while standing, and I would always just randomly lose my erection if I was doing something laying down.  I masturbate a good bit, but mostly to drawn porn or erotica.  I have been thinking that it has been an unhealthy addiction because real people don't turn me on when cartoon comics.  The biggest turn on I get is when someone tries something new or is forced to do something.  I thought I was just addicted, but now I'm curious if adrenalyn has something to do with it.

This is unrelated to asexuality of course, but I feel like the broad majority of viewers wont recognise this. They will see him as sheltered, socially inept and question if his asexuality is a result of that, or if that is a result of his asexuality.  It's a shame, Even though the asexuality community is broad and unique just like any other community, Because we are so little understood and so under represented in the media, I feel we really need some well rounded, socially balanced people and characters to  expose the mainstream to asexuality as just an orientation, so that asexuality is not automatically associated with asocial or even anti-social behaviour."

Exactly this. Right now the only asexuals in the public eye are also socially awkward or slightly autistic or something. Sheldon from Big Bang Theory is probably the only exposure most people have to asexuality, and that's not even clearly stated. And he's socially awkward and weird.

What he's describing sounds like a low sex drive. And you don't just arbitrarily start stalking some girl that you barely know because you love her personality that you don't know of yet. I could be wrong here, but I don't see why he did all of this unless he purposely planned it from the beginning to be on the show. And then he obsesses about being on the reunion show.  I'm a bit skeptical because my friend's brother was on a reality show, acting like an idiot in hopes that it would make enough of an impression to kick start his acting career. That was literally the only reason. He literally adjusted his life to look like the perfect candidate and got someone else in on it, someone I'd never met before who also wanted an acting career. They don't talk to each other and only collaborated for the show."

But this may have been him playing it up to seem like a stalker to get on the episode. I notice that his demeanor changes halfway through the first encounter, like he ran out of steam or realized just how he had upset her for his own gain. He isn't as awkward or as clingy.

asexuality,2zgbgb,dragon-storyteller,5,Wed Mar 18 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"Asexuals, simply put, are people who don't feel sexual attraction towards anyone.  Sexual attraction means being attracted to the idea of having sex with that person. It is different from sexual desire, which is the want to participate in sex, and libido which is the urge for sexual gratification/orgasm, best described as ""horny-ness""  Asexuals can and do (*depending on the individual):   have sex form relationships get married fall in love have kids masturbate   Most people who feel less than average sexual attraction fall under the asexual umbrella so we've gathered a few other terms for folks for feelings are slightly more than none: demisexual and grey-asexual.   Demisexuals are people who normally feel no sexual attraction but can develop sexual attraction to an individual they have already built a deep bond with. Grey-asexuals (or Grey-As) are people who only occasionally feel sexual attraction under specific circumstances and otherwise feel no sexual attraction.      Also it is important to understand that there are both sexual and romantic orientations, and that they aren't always the same thing. It is most common for sexual and romantic orientations to align, ie to want to be in a romantic relationship with the same gender you want to have sex with. However many asexuals still feel romantic attraction while feeling no sexual attraction.  There are as many romantic orientations as there are sexual, for example:   Heteroromantic - fall in love with someone the opposite gender Homoromantic - fall in love with someone the same gender Biromantic - fall in love with someone from either gender Panromantic - fall in love with someone (regardless of gender) Aromantic - do not feel romantic attraction, not interested in falling in love   For more info, Asexuality.org is a great place to learn more about asexuals and asexuality and you're welcome to cruise around our subreddit and see what we're like.

On a more serious note though, not desiring sex is definitely not abnormal.  Maybe it isn't common but there definitely isn't anything wrong with it and there are lots of people here that feel the same way you do!  None of us can really tell you if you are asexual or not, it's a label you choose for yourself if you feel it helps you (I'm so bad at trying to explain this I'm sorrrrry).  Based on what you said about drinking coffee together I would say maybe you like attractive ladies in a romantic way but not a sexual way?  If this is the case then I would say you might be asexual but like I said, completely up to you to label yourself!"

Though, I'm not sure if you have any other deep rooted issues to speak of so I'm assuming what you're dealing with is straight up asexuality. Asexuals can definitely be in successful relationships. It may be a bit more difficult finding someone who is okay with no sex, but it's possible. ""Conventional"" relationships are overrated anyway. What's conventional about them? The sex? Lammmeeeeee.   Being an asexual dude can be difficult because everyone expects you to be hyper sexual and your lads might think you're weird for not wanting in on conversation about banging chicks, but who cares. Just know that asexuals can have incredibly fulfilling relationships just like anyone else.

That said, it sounds to me like it is an aspect of your experiences and your possible asexuality. At the end of the day only you can really choose your label, and you're allowed and encouraged to take some time to figure it all out. Things get surprisingly confusing when you find out you're not straight.  Realizing you might have to deal with something unexpected for the rest of your life is scary.

I imagine that if I did have sex, the stimulation of it would feel good to me as a simple physical reaction, same as masturbation.  So sex could be physically enjoyable, even though I wouldn't really be attracted to the other party (the ""stimulator"").  The stimulator could be a 110-year-old woman or something, haha.  Reminds me of a documentary I saw on Netflix, ""Life After Porn"" or something like that, where one of the guys (porn star) describes having sex as ""borrowing someone else's body to masturbate.""  I think it's kind of a fascinating perspective on it.  Still sounds asexual to me, personally, but I understand there are gray areas."

asexuality,2zcbug,flyonawall,13,Tue Mar 17 12:04:53 2015 UTC,"""sexuality"" is the culmination of attraction, orientation, desire, drive and motivation, libido, expression, behaviour, opinion and attitude on sexual matters.  Therefore ""asexuality"" can be defined as an individual who lacks any of the above aspects.  While most people (myself included) like to think of asexuality as a sexual orientation, others see it as a opinion of sex, or a measure of how much one desires sex. Because there are so many kinds of ""asexual"" there is always going to be an open dialogue, even as far as introductions go, on what makes someone or doesn't make someone asexual. This will mean a list of things people lack.... and things people don't lack, when it comes to sex.  Exhibit A: You yourself mentioned how you tolerate vanilla sex, The focus of this story is sex. You mention this in an attempt to help us better understand your personal asexual nature.   Truth is, If we can learn to better understand what ""sexuality"" is,. by discussing sex, We can better understand what asexuality is.  Your title is worded very oddly. It sounds like you are confusing asexuality with abstinence. Some asexuals may not have sex available to them, That's not what makes them asexual. Lots of allosexual people come to this sub seeking to understand too."
asexuality,2zcbug,mundabit,6,Tue Mar 17 12:32:36 2015 UTC,"I think the main definition of asexual is someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction towards other people. This doesn't tell us anything about one's sex drive or one's sexual life. For example, A could be asexual (= not sexually attracted to people) but have a high sex drive. However, since this sex drive is not directed towards other people, A takes care of it through masturbation and doesn't feel the need to have sexual encounters. Thus A still fits into the asexual definition. Another example: B is asexual and has little to no interest in sex, but they're deeply in love with their partner and enjoy having sex with them. B enjoys it because they like making their partner happy, creating a deeper bond between them and satisfying them sexually means satisfying B emotionally and romantically. Hope this helped!"
asexuality,2zcbug,ver_sacrum,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"I really don't see how someone with a high sex drive would be considered ""asexual"".  A high drive to have sex, even if that means a drive to have sex with yourself, still means you are very sexual.  The root ""a"" means not or without.  asexual = a sexual = without sexual.  It seem a lot of people are using ""asexual"" if they just have not found someone who interests them yet, but they still are very interested in having sex with someone.    Wikipedia actually defines it as: ""...the lack of sexual attraction to anyone, or low or absent interest in sexual activity.""  I suspect that most people here really are very sexual, have a high or normal sex drive, but may not yet have found someone who they connect with and are attracted to yet.  Asexuality is a temporary condition in that case.    I think that is very different from fundamentally not having a sex drive at all.  Maybe there needs to be another word for it since it seems to mean so many different things to different people."
asexuality,2zcbug,rakel37,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"By this logic, people who have sexual attraction and act upon it but later physically lose their sex drive, automatically becomes asexual - whether or not they want to be. I don't think it's productive. It becomes something imposed on the individual by their circumstances, and conflates disorders that cause suffering with the normally occurring variation that we strive to make socially accepted.   Here follows an angry rant. Take it as such.  And don't get technical with the prefix. You know that hetero- and homosexuality doesn't denote different types of sex drives. A straight and a gay person can have the same level or amount of sex drive, they just want to use it differently. Why would that suddenly not be the case for our labels? Or are you saying asexuality isn't a sexual orientation at all? By the way, should we ask the bisexuals to officially change their label because it means different things to different people?  And fine, let's say that my asexuality is a temporary placeholder. Does that make it less genuine? If I'm just waiting for someone, when can I say failed to find them? When and under which circumstances am I allowed to give up? Am I allowed to identify with others who share experiences of living in a society that assumes you're either having sex, pursuing sex or living a life that is fundamentally lacking? Am I allowed to wear a black ring? Am I allowed to carry your flag? Am I only allowed to admit to asexuality on my death bed after a life of unfulfilling or no sex? Am I allowed to admit to asexuality only if I condemn my inherent sex drive?  We already have words for some of the variations of asexuality. We have an entire asexual spectrum. And I'm sick and tired of being yanked around on it, off of it, back onto it, by people who face the same struggles as I do."

At age 23, I'm willing to bet it's because I'm asexual. In a way, I am your opposite, but we can still be part of the same group of people."
asexuality,2zcbug,21stPilot,2,Tue Mar 17 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"Asexuality is about sexual attraction, not libido. I'm ace, but I have a libido (that is to say, I sometimes feel horny, not as a response to people, just because). I occasionally masturbate, but have never fantasized about things I'd actually do with people.  This is a terminology problem: sex-drive = libido, but whether or not those are the same as a desire for sex depends on your definition of sex. Genital stimulation is not the same as going out and finding a sex partner. I don't desire sex, I don't even want sex, but that's doesn't mean I don't have a libido.  Sex is a huge part of the human experience overall, and when you realize that it's not something you need/want (as seems to be the case for most aces), it makes sense to talk about the ways your life exists w/o it. How you navigate the world avoiding this huge part of it, and why it's difficult to interact with people who assume you're something you're not, and may want things you can't/won't give. Seems pretty normal to be curious about the one thing you're not actively seeking out, when everyone else seems to be.  Besides, asexuality exists in relation to sexuality, and it's the only consistent theme we can all discuss, so of course it'll be common here."

My advice would be to cool down a bit. Don't worry about it. Take a breather, spend a day without looking up information on various sexualities.

asexuality,2z9zja,Randomixx,4,Tue Mar 17 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, demisexuality is different from other sexualities in that it can hide itself even from the demisexual themselves: until you become close enough to someone to cause sexual attraction to that person to 'trigger', there is no evidence for it being there.  Using myself as an example, I identify as ace at this point in time because I've never experienced attraction to anyone, however, it is entirely possible that I am demi and just don't know it yet. If in the future I develop feelings for someone I will swap to the demi label without a second thought, which brings us to the main point: these are all just labels, and there's no need to panic about getting your sexuality ""right"". It is entirely possible and normal for it to change, it is simply up to the individual to choose whatever description they feel best suits their experiences up to the present.  I hope this helped!"

Kissing and crushing on whomever feels right, then retroactively updating your label to reflect it is SO much easier than getting it right beforehand.

Like I'd be her bsst friend forever, a loving and supportive spouse, anything she needed, and she could be the same for me.

Just because I don't pursue girls like my brothers and friends, doesn't automatically mean I'm gay. Also, my parents, siblings and friends all try to ""match"" me up with girls. Like seriously, anytime I go out with them somewhere, they're always looking to find a mate for me. My twin brother even offered to setup an online dating profile for me. I mean it's not that I wouldn't mind being in a relationship, but it's just not that important to me and idk if it would work out seeing that I don't care to have anything to do with sex.  Also, they're always asking me if I think particular girls are attractive, but it's frustrating cuz I honestly can't tell and I never know how to respond. All this is very awkward and uncomfortable for me.  If I told my parents I was 'asexual' they would be extremely disappointed and I'm certain my dad would get very angry. Also I am a twin, so my parents pretty much use him as a benchmark that they compare me with.  He is already married, so yeah..."

asexuality,2z519b,Charles_edward,7,Sun Mar 15 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"Not breaking the rules at all; everyone is welcome.  Your relationship may work out in the long run, or it may not. If your girlfriend is trying to figure out some stuff about her sexuality and who she is, then there's no use trying to jump to conclusions at the present moment.  Enjoy the present, without expecting any particular outcome in the future. Be honest with her. Listen to what she has to say and treat her with compassion. All this is important in any relationship.  It sounds like there's no guarantee she'll ever enjoy sex or even be open to having sex at all. If that's the case, you'll need to figure out whether you're okay with a relationship that has no sexual aspect. Some people have open relationships, wherein one partner finds sexual partners outside their primary romantic relationship. There are lots of ways to make a relationship between a sexual person and an asexual person work.  However, there's a possibility that she will enjoy having sex with you. Some people take a while to become comfortable enough with another person to get into sex. Some people don't want sex for their own sake but can enjoy participating for their partner's benefit. Like how maybe if you really weren't into golf, but your girlfriend was, you might sometimes go play golf with her just because it's fun to spend time together doing something she really likes.  Take things slow. Try not to make judgments or jump to conclusions.  If the relationship doesn't work out, that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with either of you. Breaking up because you both want different things is perfectly okay, though it can still be painful. Whatever the outcome, open and honest communication will help you both work things through more easily."
asexuality,2z519b,narrativedilettante,7,Sun Mar 15 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"She sounds like she is afraid that if she doesn't give you sexual pleasure, that you may not want her. It is important to tell her that sexual activities play no part in how much you want to be with her .. if that is the case. If you decide that sexual activities is something you would like to have in your life partner, then you should tell her this. Perhaps this will lead to a break up, but if it does, please emphasize that there is nothing wrong with her, simply that you and her are not as compatible as you thought. At the very least you can always take care of yourself via masturbation. ~ To tell you from my experience (I'm ace, while my boyfriend is not), an asexual/sexual relationship works and it works very well."
asexuality,2z519b,prysmyr,3,Mon Mar 16 05:11:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, so there are lots of asexual/allosexual relationships that work.  Some things to think about:   What are her feelings about sex?  If you read through posts, you'll notice that, while some asexuals are disgusted by sex or just don't want it in their lives, others are able to find a sexual relationship that works.  Some asexuals enjoy the act of sex for what it is or like making their partner feel good, but if that's not your girlfriend, that's not necessarily a dealbreaker.  Lots of sexuals have kinks that their partner isn't necessarily into themselves, but is willing to indulge.  Like with any other kink, sex might be a dealbreaker for her, or might be perfectly manageable once you both learn to communicate your interests and desires.  In your post, you worry that one or both of you will have to make sacrifices, but none of these scenarios is really a ""sacrifice"".  You don't have enjoy 100% of the same things to have a happy relationship, provided you know what you want and communicate.   Now I don't want to imply that your girlfriend is eventually going to be comfortable with sex, but I will say that coming out as ace is what made me comfortable with having sexual partners.  If your girlfriend is acting averse to the idea of intimacy now, it might be because everything that's come before has been incompatible with her desires.  No promises, but acceptance and conversation might evolve whatever you've negotiated so far and result in something that makes you both happier than ever before.   Would you consider an open relationship?  I don't know what community you hail from, so maybe the idea of non-monogamy sounds weird and gross.  But it is a great way to get exactly what you want sexually without your partner having to jump through hoops. I've been in relationships where both me and my sexual partner pursue casual hookups on the side, but save the intimacy bit for each other.  For me, at least, sex doesn't have a lot of intimacy to it, so I don't care whether my partner finds it elsewhere.  Again, communication is crucial, but it is a totally reasonable solution.   It sounds like your girlfriend is sorting through a lot of feelings right now, and that you're learning a lot about her new identity.  That's the perfect thing to be doing right now.  It's a weird and scary time, and until both of you are able to articulate your interests and hard limits, it'll be hard to say whether things are going to work.  Honestly?  It sounds like you are interested in understanding her, that you like each other a lot, and there's enough there that you both are willing to put some effort into making things work.  I'm super optimistic for you.  And I think as both of you continue to learn about the community, your situation won't seem so dire."

I'm not sure an open relationship would work, because I am pretty sure I'm demisexual, but I'm still trying to figure out if I actually even want actual sex. I think I might have jumped the gun on worrying about that.  And like you said, I think it will work out just fine, it was just a lot to take in at once. I've been reading about it online and more importantly, we've been talking about it a lot. I think I actually understand what it means for us, and I think we'll both be happy."

It sounds like your SO might have a side-effect of a decreased sex drive, but I don't read that as ace-related at all.

O.M.G.  They're KIDS! They're not freaking pawns in some game of one-upmanship!  Holy freaking cow!  I think you can see first-hand a pretty good reason why having kids before you're mature enough is not of the good.  I swear, I'm just shaking my head over your parents.  (Although, I'm curious what would happen with your cousin if you announced that you plan to enter an abbey and become a nun. Or possibly that you plan to train for the Iditarod.)  Honestly, with thick-headedness like your parents are exhibiting, I doubt there's anything you can say to help them get a clue.  Maybe get them a breeding pair of guinea-pigs and tell them they can breed them as they like and welcome as many grand-pigs as they want, but you are not available to breed their dynasty for them.    Or maybe tell them that you'd prefer to wait until you and your peers are more mature and then see what's available that might appeal to you, but jailbait just doesn't do it for you.

There was a lacigreen Lindsay Doe youtube video where she talked about meeting David Jay for the first time. She didn't even realize David Jay was there. He was invisible to her. She spoke about having a sexual energy that would normally bounce off people but with David it was like a void and therefore she didn't notice him at all.  I feel like I'm a void of sexual energy. I don't feel sexually attracted to women but unlike David Jay I can be and want to be. Like him, however, I end up being invisible to women in most casual situations. And when I do feel that sexual energy directed at me it makes me very uncomfortable. I can't return it.  In a dating situation it's just as bad if not worse. I feel like I'm trying to ""fake it until I make it"" (I hate that saying.) Where I'm trying to be both attracted/attractive to a woman and I just don't feel like me.

By that certainly not trying to downplay the emotional aspect, but the idea of pleasing a partner sexually was just a part of the routine of keeping a happy relationship for them, happy to do it but not exactly pleasurable.  For an ace, I think that's a great compromise if you're willing. Now on the other it's really up to the other partner whether that's enough for them. Some people very much to be an object of desire for their partner and there's no fault there. For other people, they may be perfectly content with a loving partner willing to do whatever in the sack and constantly trying to improve.

asexuality,2yxuj5,falling2geeses,2,Fri Mar 13 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"There's no one correct path once you're comfortable with your asexuality (congratulations for coming to terms with it, btw!). We're all making this up as we go, pretty much.  As far as coming out is concerned, you can deliberately tell a few close friends and/or family members; you can only tell people if/when it comes up in conversation; you can shout it to the world, march in pride parades, and become an activist, or do anything in between. You're not required to tell anyone you don't want to, and there's no time limit on coming out--wait until you're sure you want to and you think it will benefit you, and you're strong enough to deal with any unfortunate reactions. In the short term, they might have weird questions or misconceptions. Just stay patient, and muddle through as best you can.  I know this seems like a huge, momentous occasion right now, and it is in some ways, but the truth is, asexuality is just one small part of who we are. In my experience, at least, very few people thought it was as big of a deal as I did, once I'd come out to them and some time had passed."

Feel free to PM me if you ever need to just get stuff off your chest. I may not be a super skillful (sleuthful?) listener, but I do care.   As for your friends (noting that I'm not particularly qualified to chime in) it sounds like your problems with these friends is caused by more than just your asexuality (not that that would be any better- I'm sorry, words are hard). Whether they make you actively uncomfortable, or you just click, you'd probably be much more comfortable with people you can relate to- whether because of similar tastes or viewpoints.  If you don't feel comfortable ditching them, you could always look for new people to connect with, during other times, or online (which is a much larger pool of personalities to begin with). Random internet strangers can be friends too! (just don't give them your address. Or your full name.)"

If you feel like your asexuality is the barrier between yourself and other people, look for the common ground that builds a bridge over that wall. Or, find people into the things you like. You can have both, you can grow away from people without losing their friendship, it's just a different kind of relationship."

I'm not sure if asexuality was a factor, or how much of a factor it was.  If that was the case, it was probably subconscious, I never really thought about it at the time.  At this point, I've accepted that I am a fundamentally weird person and I always will be, so usually people don't get personal enough with me to talk about sex anyway.

They do suffer from an anti-demi circlejerk (I think they see it as a purely tumblr invention. Belief in the ""late bloomer"" and that kind of thing), but if one points it out on their discussion forum they tend to agree that it is a problem (though this was around a year ago.

asexuality,2yr3yo,rainebough,4,Thu Mar 12 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"Be as open and honest as possible. She may be hurt, she may be upset, but it will be better to honestly express your feelings than to deny them for the sake of someone else.  If you care about each other, it will be worthwhile to attempt to find a way to make your relationship work for both of you. It may not work out, and in that case I recommend accepting it and moving on. It doesn't reflect badly on either of you if you make an honest effort and find that you just can't meet each other's needs.  The only way to know is to communicate, clearly and without judgement. Express your needs and listen to hers. Acknowledge both of your feelings with compassion. Accept that things aren't always the way you wish they were, and do what you can to make them better."

Also, the fact that you seem to be willing to try despite not really feeling the sexual attraction gives you some wiggle-room with which, perhaps, both of you can get some of your needs met."

It might not be what you want to hear, but it's true. Get them out of your life immediately if that's possible.  If anyone asks you about your kinks you are under no obligation to appease them by pretending to still be into the things you once liked. People change, tastes and interests change, and that's okay. If anyone asks you what your kinks are you can just say ""I don't really have any anymore. It just sort of happened.""   Talk to your boyfriend about it. Explain it to him as you've just explained here. You're comfortable within the confines of the relationship but once it goes beyond that you're just not into anything. Maybe he can help you when it comes to telling people.  I don't know why your attitude towards kinks have changed. It could be the trauma you went through, it could be you've just grown tired of that scene, even getting older is a completely valid reason, but no one needs to know. If they can't grasp and respect the fact that you've changed then they might not be worth your time anyway."

Some allozexual men have a really low libido and even though they're interested, don't really think about sex much.

It is alive. Like you said, it does vibrate. To me, it is warm and comforting. It surrounds me with this such vastness that I get overwhelmed and feel at peace in that state. Sometimes, there are those moments of transcendence where I do feel like there is a higher power present. You kinds beam up if that makes sense. It is being surrounded by light which can be blue, white, or gold in my experience. So, eating candy.... that is a good take on it. For me, it is coming home. I always want to go back to that silence and space. On the winter, it has it time. But, I find going out to secluded places with nature is my favorite hobby during the spring and summer when I want to get away. I am actually excited this season is back.

asexuality,2yna1b,EvanescentExistence,5,Wed Mar 11 04:43:57 2015 UTC,"(Ace girl here.)  Well, I think it's ok to jerk off sometimes, if your body needs it. But I think you're looking for a way to suppress the need. Maybe intensive physical exercise or just hard work will help a bit? You know, such work to the point where you will be so exhausted that you and your body will want to doze off and nothing else."
asexuality,2yna1b,Rock-kickass,3,Wed Mar 11 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"I second this.   From personal experience if you don't want to masturbate then exercise is probably the best distraction for that sort of thing. It gets you movin and groovin and focused, where as most other types of distraction, like reading or video games, etc. will have you sit in one place hoping you'll be immersed enough to forget you're horny."
asexuality,2yna1b,Kaisharga,13,Wed Mar 11 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"Well hey, I'm ace, and sex is fine and dandy for this, if you don't mind being in close proximity to another human in such a way. That's such a simple solution that I presume that you do, in fact, mind.  First option is to reframe the problem. You know what else is a gross, selfish, self-serving task? Eating. Seriously, don't think about it too hard, it's gross. But you do it anyway. And you don't just eat to stop being hungry, you also have things that you like to eat, things that taste good, things you want to be eating when you do eat. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this.  Similarly there is precisely nothing wrong with masturbation. It's a thing your body tells you it is craving. Is it inconvenient? Sure, sometimes. Messy, too, if you aren't prepared. But there is nothing wrong with it.  An alternate option is invoked obsolescence. There's no real delicate way to put this, but the male prostate is a very serious erogenous zone, and by contrast to the high-intensity short-time experience of penile masturbation, prostate stimulation tends to be much slower, calmer, and less draining. Speaking personally, I also find it to be more fulfilling--I don't crave ejaculation in the same way I did before I messed around with prostate stuff, and the prostate play doesn't come with its own OMG MUST type of need. The thing that turns most people off is that the prostate is most easily accessed via the butt. I will tell you, it's not as bad as popular culture makes it out to be, in basically any way. Seriously, I highly recommend at least reading up on it."

Some men have preconceived notions about trans women and are averse to the idea of being with them. That can be part of a harmful attitude, if they just won't have anything to do with a woman just because she's trans. Having preferences for a partner's genital configuration is understandable, though, if the relationship is going to have a sexual aspect. Typically that's a very personal issue to be resolved privately between the people who are in a relationship.  As for identifying as aromantic... some people find that their sexual orientation changes over time, so I see no reason why romantic orientation couldn't do the same."

asexuality,2yi1xw,preciousjewel128,6,Tue Mar 10 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"I started dating before I understood my asexuality. I thought I had a low sex drive because I wasn't interested in having sex and I didn't lust after people. I met a boy that was really nice and kind and we had a lot in common. I asked him out and we went through the motion of dating the way 16 year olds do. It was new and exciting so I didn't notice the lack of sexual attraction. Romantic attraction filled in the gaps.  When the novelty wore off I assumed we were leaving the ""honeymoon phase"" it wasn't until we had been together for 6 years (married for 3) that I realised I was asexual. It had been an issue for us for the last few years because he was hypersexual, and communicated his love though sex.  We separated after a short exploration of a polyfidelous hinge, and then I put myself out there as being interested in dating again.  I had a very horrible experience with a fuck buddy dynamic, but that lead to my current relationship. My fuck buddy brought me to a party, where a guy asked me what I was doing, he questioned my self respect if I, an asexual, was even happy as someone's fuck buddy. I wasn't. That guy and I had a really nice moment, as the only ones awake at the party come 3am, we pulled an all nighter and talked about everything, I ended up lying in his lap and he played with my hair. He's not asexual, but he was hurt badly in his last relationship and what he wants right now is love and intimacy without sex, which is what I want to, so we are having a go at it to see if we are compatible at least in the short term. (early days still)"
asexuality,2yi1xw,mundabit,5,Tue Mar 10 02:50:17 2015 UTC,I'm currently in a relationship and so far it's great we have no problems with anything really... It's more the fact we click emotionally if anything and that's what makes it special. As for how we got together it was simply we started being more and more attached to each other to the point where we are started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. It's unusual ik but our whole relationship is weird
asexuality,2yi1xw,Random12multi,5,Tue Mar 10 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if my now-husband ever technically asked me out, but he definitely pursued me. Wooed me maybe? We had a college class together, and while I was coming to accept the idea of never having a real relationship, he decided I looked cute or something, so he started walking with me after class. It started as just getting to know each other as classmates, and when we found each other very agreeable, we slowly ramped up how much time we spent together until we started living together a year or so later. I know that he wanted to date from the beginning, but on my end it was more of a development from friendship to best-friendship to could-stand-you-forever.   He never pushed, and we both wanted a stable, long-term relationship, so it's been pretty smooth sailing!"

They have a great FAQ section and a forum where you can read about people's experiences.  Www.Asexualityarchive.com is another good place and there's even a book written by the creator of the site that's available as a paid eBook or as a free pdf.   One of my personal favorites is https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com whose tag line is ""Furthering upper-level discussions of asexuality."" Or something similar to that. A really good blog with excellent posts.   There are of course so many more, but any one of those sites can help when it comes to understanding what's going on and coming out to family and friends.  As for the children, if adoption isn't something she wanted to do I'm sure artificial insemination would work just fine as long as she's comfortable with it. There's no reason she can't have a family just because she's asexual. There are asexual guys who want the same exact thing she does and would understand, to some extent, what she's going through.

asexuality,2yj86w,SultanofShit,2,Tue Mar 10 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"Welcome. You're a good friend.  She could tell the family that she definitely intends to have children but this may not come about quickly or in the traditional way because she is asexual. I assume she is quite young and has plenty of time to work this out.  Bearing children will really be much easier than finding an ace-compatible partner, there is always artificial insemination. Many aces have relationships with sexual people and some have children. I do, and I may regret the relationship but never the child.  I'm concerned about her being freaked out by hugging, this is not common among aces and is likely to be something that can be treated. Is this all hugging or only people who may want sex from her?"

Is this all hugging or only people who may want sex from her?   This struck me too. Though I think ""treated"" is the wrong word, because it implies that OP's friend is broken, diseased or wrong. There is nothing wrong about being uncomfortable with hugs, ""A"" is allowed to feel that way if she wants. But if she is ""freaking out"" (ie: anxiety and panic) then this needs to be explored more.  It's not related to asexuality, It's just another part of her identity. A needs to explore this part of her identity and try to find out why hugs are causing this reaction. If that's something she wants to work on, great, either by learning to cope with the anxiety, or by avoiding hugs, or by learning to enjoy hugs, it's A's choice.  What intimate acts does A enjoy? this is a good question OP can ask her, It's good to have a close friend to share these things with, or to verbally explore in the event A isn't sure. Does she like holding hands, or saying affectionate phrases like ""I like you""?  There are Asexual men who want a wife, and sexual men who are ok with an asexual wife, But the languages of love still apply, Obviously sex and hugs are not A's language, so what is?"

Either soft implications, (LotR), or hard (Penn). Even without any such clues in a piece of media, it's pretty general that dragons lust after gold instead of/much more than booty.   It's kinda been, kinda not been, an ace thing for some time, at least a decade. It's mostly overshadowed by other things that are associated with dragons, (furries, otherkin, trans people, etc.), plus most people think they're badass and want to associated with them, so, not a terribly strong connection, even though a recurring one."
asexuality,2ydt0v,eureka2814,2,Mon Mar 9 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, so it's a long time thing that didn't spread as much as the cake thing did? I don't think I quite understand what furries have to do with it, since it's about aces being linked to dragons and not the other way around... right?"
asexuality,2ydt0v,OrangeredValkyrie,2,Mon Mar 9 17:52:29 2015 UTC,"Furries/otherkin/trans people also have a connection to dragons; So the culture connections any one group has with dragons is muted by the fact that you have to mention 'dragons' and '[x]' in the same post/paragraph/unit of writing to unambiguously connect them, as opposed to an out-of-place joke about cake being unambiguously about asexuals.   If I make a comment about dragons going after gold instead of booty, not even aces will necessarily connect that with aces. Even if it's obvious I'm making an in-joke of some kind, people are equally aware that furries/otherkin/trans people are connected to dragons, so they might just assume they're not supposed to get the joke.   Contrast/compare monstergirls/monsterboys, where the themes of transformation and corruption mirror that of many trans experiences, and a surprising number of trans people do read and sympathize with that fiction, but most people would associate it more with otherkin or even furries . . . despite the fact that neither of those two groups are overly connected with the concept of monsters, nor any component of the concept. So a very large number of trans people partake in that genre of fic, but it's not a trans person thing. (NB: If you look for non-porn, non-erotica monstergirl fic, it's ALMOST ENTIRELY TRANS WOMEN WRITERS)  So  . . . ambiguous connection & lack of in-group awareness keeps it from spreading or exploding, unlike cake."
asexuality,2ydt0v,eureka2814,2,Mon Mar 9 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't think of it that way, but you have a great point. Ace, trans, otherkin, furry (and other similar) communities are generally more open because they are based on admitting something that's usually not accepted well in society. When most people in a community admit they like something, it becomes a community symbo. And since so many communities share dragons as a symbol, they became useless for bonding in one particular community. Even if I mentioned dragons eating cake, most people would probably not understand what do the dragons have to do with that.  Wow, thank you for this. This changed my views about all this quite a bit... Thank you :)"
asexuality,2ydt0v,eureka2814,2,Mon Mar 9 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yes! And a continual mention of dragons would just get people thinking that you're an otherkin ace!  You've got it exactly, and I'm excited because I'm usually bad at explaining things. :)"

What defines an asexual (as far as I know, I'm still new to this being asexual thing) is the lack of sexual attraction to anyone so sex drive =/= sexual attraction. From what I've read it's also normal for asexuals to be intrigued by the concept of sex while being weirded out when adding another person into the mix, even if it's just a passing thought.  To be honest, I didn't realize the ""id hit that"" thing between a lot of dudes wasn't just a running joke until recently. I still don't understand it, but I guess that's what makes me asexual.

If you are not sexually attracted to people (which it seems you are not), it is entirely likely. The ""physical"" attraction you are referring to may be aesthetic attraction.  Romance and sexual orientations are not explicitly hitched to each other. You can be asexual and still wish to pursue people in love.

(Probably homoromantic, biromantic, or pan romantic)   What are Anna's feelings about sex? (Repulsed, neutral, positive, somewhere inbetween these?)  How well does Anna understand these feelings? (Does she know she's ace, does she understand the terminology, etc) if not, does she learn them over the course of the story? Does Zozo help her discover this about herself?   What are Zozo's thoughts about the entire thing? As an allosexual woman, how ok is she with whatever Anna's various orientations are?   How does Anna react when exposed to sexual material? Grossed out, aroused, indifferent, depends on what it is? How comfortable is she with expressing this? Is she embarrassed by her arousal or lack thereof?   Is Anna grey-sexual or demisexual? If grey, is she sexually attracted to Zozo? What if she ended up being sexually attracted to someone else (I'm getting ahead of myself, sorry)?   This ended up longer than I thought it would be. Sorry, I'm a bit of an aspiring writer myself. Feel free to pm me if you wanted someone to bounce ideas off of or if you have more specific questions!"
asexuality,2y9qfm,dahliadelinquent,2,Sat Mar 7 22:23:28 2015 UTC,"Not getting ahead of yourself at the end there at all!  These are exactly the kinds of questions I was hoping you guys could help me work through and answer.  I didn't know what I needed to consider, so these are very helpful.  The setting is considerably different from our culture, so there aren't some of our particular prejudices and there are novel ones.  One significant weakness of it is assumed heteroromantic(ism?) (heterosexuality is a little less rigid, especially in adolescents).  Additionally, the kind of discussion we have doesn't really exist, at least not as part of a wider cultural awareness.  These things can be talked about, even well-understood, among individuals and groups, but you won't find extensive terminology like we have.  This is all to set up the backdrop of her own understanding of her sexuality; not to say these aren't qualities she would possess, explore, and eventually inhabit.  I believe she is likely biromantic.  As teddalego asked, I think she has experienced crushes before, not only with Zozo, throughout her life.  Her upbringing (noble, rigid) discouraged exploration of these attractions, and it is likely she may not be aware of her sexuality as not being the norm (I don't know how problematic ""the norm"" is; forgive me if it is) until she is exposed to the wider array of characters in the story.  She is also likely not exposed to sex itself until she and Zozo become very close.  That's not to say she can't imagine, but (and tell me if this is not plausible) if she were to possess a very low or non-existent sex drive, would she undertake those kinds of questions on her own?  However, once these questions are put upon her, I think she is somewhere in between neutral and repulsed by sex.  Understanding these feelings will definitely be something that occurs over the story, especially in tandem with Zozo.  There is another character who deals with a severe denial of the self at the beginning of the story, including resisting his own sexual urges, who I think will have some very frank discussions with her and they'll both work some things out together.  Zozo will be most instrumental though, and they will have at least one significant moment wherein Zozo realizes Anna doesn't want to go down this path with her, triggering discussion and, eventually, resolution.  (I'm worried right now about the agency this seems to rob from Anna; going to try to work it out in a way that her sexuality is not simply being figured out around her, so to speak.)  Their relationship begins with a particular power imbalance (Zozo being a captured thief, conscripted to make amends), and while those power structures do fall away as the story progresses, there's a certain moral inferiority that Zozo experiences for quite some time after.  I think this informs her... non-confrontational (not the right word) manner in which she approaches Anna's orientations at the beginning of the story; as they become more honest, familiar, and trusting of one another, though, Zozo's feelings of genuine understanding are made more apparent.  She respects and loves Anna, and wants what is best for her heart and mind.  Likewise, Anna also feels that way about Zozo, and navigating Zozo's sexual desires will be the next big thing to tackle.  I will need to do some soul-searching and probably some drafting before I'm ready to come down on this one way or the other, but it's possible Anna even encourages her to have other sexual partners once they reach that stage of not-fearing-for-the-other's-duplicity, so to speak.  I don't want it to feel like an obligation that Anna do this; that'll be a tough line to walk, I think.  Anna's reaction when exposed to sexual material, indifferent.  I think she isn't offended, grossed out, embarrassed, by witnessing it in others.  I would like very much for her not to be embarrassed of her own lack of arousal, but her culture and storytelling may inform that differently.  This is tough to say.  I don't believe she is demisexual, though I'll ask for your particular feedback on this point: her arousal may not increase as her romantic bond with Zozo does, but her willingness to participate for Zozo's benefit may.  I'm leaning toward no significant sexual contact between them (mostly because in the context of a romance novel, this may be construed as the ""convincing"" or the ""she wasn't really asexual after all"" that I mentioned being worried about, and I don't think I have the space or experience to do that justice).  However if they did have sex, it's not necessarily an indication that Anna is demisexual, correct?  Thank you so much for these questions!  A lot has already been made clearer, and the things that have been illuminated that I still need to think about are excellent.  I'm definitely going to keep thinking on these (and maybe PMing you with further questions)."
asexuality,2y9qfm,dahliadelinquent,4,Sat Mar 7 23:23:27 2015 UTC,"...wow. No, being willing to have sex with your partner does not necessarily mean demisexual. It means that Anna is still not sexually attracted to Zozo but understands that it's something Zozo wants and Anna would be willing (or not, if she's sex-repulsed) to try it due to her love/trust of Zozo."
asexuality,2y9qfm,dahliadelinquent,2,Sun Mar 8 03:00:02 2015 UTC,"Right, I was just clarifying terms.

I cannot imagine being driven to seek sex, let alone driven to such an extreme.  It seems like people are practically slaves to that drive and conversely, they cannot imagine not having that drive to seek sex.  I remember once having a discussion about dating websites and I just did not ""get"" why it would be so terrible/unbelievable to mention that I did not care at all about looks - I wanted to list the things I was actually interested in and the things that mattered to me.  My friend was appalled and said that just made me look ""desperate"".  I could not understand that.  I was just listing what mattered to me.  She was listing what mattered to her, why couldn't I?  Why was my list of things that mattered to me indicative of ""desperation"" and hers not?  It pissed me off and seemed so stupid to just list crap I was expected to list and say, rather than what I actually cared about.  I could not comprehend (this was  quite a few years ago) why physical appearance was supposed to matter so much to me, and that it not mattering to me, was somehow wrong to admit.  It was very frustrating.  I eventually gave up and assumed I was just ""weird"".    Jokes on her, turns out I am not the only person like this in the world.  :)"

asexuality,2y0qus,bgmrk,13,Thu Mar 5 13:49:17 2015 UTC,You can still be asexual and have sex. It's not completely unheard of.
asexuality,2y0qus,celestier,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, she said though each time she had sex she enjoyed it more and more, so it was more of a case of she didn't know what she was missing out on so she just got used to the lifestyle. Now since trying it she has changed her tune. Which hit me kinda hard because I didn't know I relied on her so much in terms of sharing the same views of sex. Now I have no one to turn to really that I can relate to which I how I ended up here. This seems like a really good community to figure myself out in."
asexuality,2y0qus,celestier,7,Thu Mar 5 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"Did she explicitly say she was asexual? If not then it seems you may be blowing this out of proportion. For some people, it /is/ about finding the right partner and there's nothing wrong with that. She may even be demisexual.  It also seems like you're projecting insecurity over your own sexuality onto her. That's just my opinion, though."
asexuality,2y0qus,Anonthrowaway425,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"No she didn't but as I described my thoughts and feelings to her she agreed. Known her for years, always gets asked out on dates, never commits and she never said she felt the urge to have sex with any. I don't think I'm projecting but clearly I put far to much weight into that aspect of the friendship, and I see that now. She was just the only person I had known personally who felt even an ounce of what I do, or lack there of in this case. I'm happy for her, very happy that she has found someone who gives her butterflies and that she is exploring her sexuality and learning more about herself."
asexuality,2y0qus,kramerica583,3,Fri Mar 6 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"Like /u/celestier said, she might just be demisexual. For demisexual people 90+% of their lives they're asexual all the way, but then they find someone that they connect with to the right degree, and their sexuality activated towards them and they are, at least towards that person, a sexual person. They're still ace in the rest of their lives, and still fall under the asexual umbrella, but I understand what you mean. It's tough realizing someone isn't something you were sure they were, especially when you thought they were like you in something so seemingly rare. Hang in there OP, you'll find other ace friends if you look for them."
asexuality,2y0qus,kramerica583,6,Fri Mar 6 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"You don't have to feel alone. I recently found out that I'm ace and I take a lot of comfort in the fact that there's a whole community out there of people like me. So no matter what, you aren't alone :)"
asexuality,2y0qus,Najlepsiejszy,2,Thu Mar 5 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying to figure myself out exactly, this just hit hard as I didn't realize I found such comfort in someone seeing sex similar to how I do. Luckily it has lead me to this community which seems like a great place to share and be open about the many confusing aspects surrounding sex."
asexuality,2y0qus,Kali711,2,Thu Mar 5 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"True! And as asexuals, we may never see the world in the same way that sexual people do. But that's okay, because we all have each other."

asexuality,2y008s,SexSellsCoffee,18,Thu Mar 5 10:03:00 2015 UTC,"I must live under a rock or something, because this is the first time I've heard anything about any aces being anti-gay. Especially since some aces are homoromantic.   Gays being acephobic, yes I've heard about that, but not the other way around.  And if someone was sex averse or sex repulsed, why would they single out gays? Seems more likely they would be anti-everything for sexuality-oriented people.  I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but I'm wondering is it something specifically related to those aces because of their ace-ness, or if it's more about how they were raised, like in a generally homophobic household anyway, or one of those pseudo-religious communities which are basically just thinly-veiled hate groups."

asexuality,2y008s,Najlepsiejszy,6,Fri Mar 6 01:24:42 2015 UTC,I can't believe there wouldn't be. Just because they are asexual doesn't mean they can't act homophobic.

The whole point of my capstone is that we DO exist, and we're coming for you (jk not really). They make us seem completely inferior. But yeah, I think we're queer, but explaining that to people opens up a whole bucket of worms. I just explained the whole Trans* umbrella to my uncle and he understood it. If I threw the aces in there? He'd probably explode. I'll wait until he's high if he asks questions."

My old roommate was gay and he thought trans* people were gross.  I personally don't care what a person's orientation is. My best friend and roommate is a lesbian."
asexuality,2y008s,geekerjoy1,5,Sat Mar 7 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that the vast majority of aces are supportive of the LGBT* community, though even the ace community may have the occasional jerk."
asexuality,2y008s,Gray_Sloth,3,Thu Mar 5 07:36:23 2015 UTC,"Not that I have seen, but what I have seen is mostly limited to here and AVEN, where offensively bigoted comments would be quickly down voted/removed.  Like SexSellsCoffee said there will be bigotry anywhere. Sadly I would not be surprised if there were a lot of aces who are antigay, especially since so many are disgusted by sex, and homosexuality (among men at least) has the image of being only about sex (the ""gay slut"" stereotype). And many aces do not consider themselves part of the queer community so not automatically ""allied"" I guess, especially when as broadwayguru pointed out the community does not want to include us either.  Me personally, I can't remember ever understanding why anyone whould think homosexuality should be ""wrong"" even when I was young. And what with the crush I've had on another guy for several years I don't think I ever will."
asexuality,2y008s,geekerjoy1,3,Fri Mar 6 03:19:35 2015 UTC,"Weirdly enough, there was a mention in my Psych 101 textbook that the reason for the ""gay slut"" stereotype was because men and women have differing motivations for having sex, and in a same-sex relationship, those motivations would align, so that's why, according to the book, lesbian couples have lower rates of sex than gay couples - for the guys, their biological drives and their mental processes just line up, and for them sex is a much higher relationship priority than for females.  But it's interesting that generally men who have sex alot, in society are thought of as ""studs"", but if they're in a gay relationship, society perceives them as being ""sluts"". And for women, if they have sex alot outside the context of a relationship, they're called ""sluts"", but in the context of a relationship, while they're not considered ""studs"", it is considered appropriate behavior.  Why are people so weird about other people's sexuality after all this time? smh"

I know that hurt feelings isn't a rational response but I don't want him to feel lied to, either.   We're very open about these things.

asexuality,2xwggo,Freudswetdream55,9,Wed Mar 4 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"If you do not get attracted to people sexually, then you are asexual. If you do not get attracted to people romantically, then you are aromantic. The back-story and underlying details don't invalidate or question your sexuality (or lack thereof).  This is not at all medical advice, but I will say if you actually see your views of your mother as instrumental enough to be a cause of any kind to your lack of interest in intimacy, therapy of some sort might be of assistance. Not for the sake of an effort to ""changing your sexuality"" (which I do not believe is effective), but just to clear your mind of it a tad. I've got a bit of odd memories from childhood relating to how my parents treated each other and how they treated me; talking about them may make the burden lesser."
asexuality,2xwggo,hahahahahaha_,5,Wed Mar 4 14:32:33 2015 UTC,"This sounds like sex repulsion, along with an avoidant attachment style. Low T seems unlikely to me. It could contribute to a lack of interest in sex, but wouldn't usually cause disgust at the thought of it.  Sex repulsion could be a part of being asexual, but not necessarily. It might be something you can work through and move past in time, but I can't say for certain.  As for the attachment style part: There are three different ways that people attach to loved ones. These different styles have a lot to do with the way a child learned to attach to their parents, and then the style informs the way that the grown adult attaches to romantic partners. The basic idea is that when you attach to someone, you want them to continue being part of your life and you don't want them to leave. If you have a secure attachment style, you can attach to someone and trust them to stay with you, being comfortable with temporary absences because you know they'll come back.  Then there's insecure attachment, which is split into two types, anxious and avoidant. Anxious attachment involves holding on tight so that they'll never be able to get away. Someone with an anxious attachment style might experience jealousy and have trouble being separated from their partner even for short periods of time.  Avoidant attachment, on the other hand, is an attempt to shield oneself from emotional hurt by never attaching in the first place. A person with an avoidant attachment style will back away as soon as a relationship looks like it might form. It's a sort of preventative measure to shield oneself from the potential pain of having a loved one leave them because there will never be a loved one to leave at all.  Based on what you said regarding your mom, it sounds like she's hurt your ability to trust women and you're reluctant to open up to a relationship at least partly for that reason. Now, that's the impression I get, but if you feel that's inaccurate then feel free to ignore anything I said that doesn't seem to apply to you.  You might want to talk some of this over with a therapist, if it's causing you distress. I've found therapy to be very helpful in sorting through past trauma and revealing the person I am now."

I had the same aversion to men for a time because my father was umm... to put it mildly, an abusive worthless human.  It may be worth exploring this before making up your mind about being asexual/aromantic, either in therapy or with friends you trust implicitly. It kind of sucks being turned off to an entire gender (by that I mean even in friendship and caring, nevermind sex). You will meet many women who won't be anything like your mother, thankfully..."

I honestly think that you need to do away with the whole ""I'm not good looking"" attitude. You need to take some time and focus on your good side. Focus on what's good about you. If you wallow in your own self-pity, it tends to become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. I know this may sound harsh, but honestly I make sure to acknowledge my good points, and it really helps with my self-esteem. I may be overweight and have a bit of an acne problem, but I focus more on my potential, my abilities, and my positive traits. I think you should work on this first and foremost.

asexuality,2xv7px,kramerica583,4,Wed Mar 4 03:19:45 2015 UTC,"Asexuality is just like every other sexual orientation out there, so know that you are definitely not alone. Just like being homosexual/etc., it does limit your options somewhat, but there is always someone out there who fits the bill. While it sounds like your last boyfriend didn't like the prospect of little/no sex, there are asexual guys out there and even sexuals with low sex drives who would be just fine to be in a relationship with an asexual.  As for your feelings, it is absolutely not something that is easy to deal with, but that does not make it unmanageable. Personally I find myself spending a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly makes me ""like"" someone, or causes me to have feelings, there's still a lot of  unknowns. It's a work in progress--but that's OK, since that's what makes you unique and defines you.  These things take time to reconcile, but know that you can always take comfort in the fact that you will get through it. Always."

It's unfortunate, the whole situation. A lot of people go completely shit-crazy with identity matters, and we end up with Tumblr where a lot of people come up with their own terms for their feelings and insist it's a sexual orientation or a gender identity without any real understanding that those are real terms that have real meanings. It undercuts the groups who do have nonstandard orientations and identities; nobody can take the right people seriously because people who aren't professionals or scholars can't really tell the difference. We've become jaded, perhaps rightly so, and your friend is conveying an unfortunate side effect.   You might want to have a talk with him. Maybe not now, maybe not even soon, but you both might have a lot to gain from a good sit-down talk about it. A little from the ""you said this and it hurt,"" a little of the ""here's what it is and what it isn't,"" and a good helping of ""here's my questions about it."" I find that a lot of people are receptive to learning more about asexuality, but they're just never given a context where they have time for anything more than a snap-judgement or assumptive leap-to-conclusion."

I was at a the house of some close friends of mine and we'd been drinking. I confessed that I was asexual and... got the worst coming out experience of my life! They basically named every bingo in existence from ""you just haven''t had good sex"", ""you'll meet the right man"", ""have you seen a doctor?"" to ""have you been abused?"". It was very, very hurtful and for a long time I didn't initiate contact with either of them. And I lost a lot of respect for both of them.   I wish I'd said something to them afterwards, but at that time my asexuality was very new to me and this just devastated my confidence for a long while.   On a bright note, I did come out to my roommate this week and it was awesome! I was also very assertive of what kind of responses I would not accept from her, but it turned into a non-issue since she knew about asexuals."

That seems to me to be the most straightforward approach. You're not accusing him of flirting with you, per say, but you can still let him know you don't want to be hit on.  If he's kinda douche he might respond with something like, ""I wasn't doing that.""  If so, you can ask him, ""Well, do you want me to point it out when you're doing it?""  Either way, if he says yes or no, he'll probably stop or at least really reduce the amount he teases/flirts with you (you know, assuming he's actually a nice guy and it's not his aim to make you uncomfortable).

Be careful if he doesn't get on the clue bus soon.  You might consider finding a new roommate. Yes, it'll be sad because otherwise it seems you two had so much in common, but if he's the kind of person to so blatantly disregard your feelings and your right to peaceful existence in your own home, then he's got major character defects that probably would have shown up at some point anyway.  How he's treating you is not acceptable and can be considered a deal-breaker.  It has nothing to do with you being able to 'take a joke', or 'being a good sport', or whatever other pathetic defense he might use to turn the blame onto you or try to shame you because you're calling him on his bull$hit, so don't give in if he tries to emotionally bully you for standing up for yourself.  You are not 'making a big deal out of nothing', you are not being' unreasonable' for wanting him to cease and desist this unnacceptable behavior toward you.  (I've got a relative who uses all of the above tactics to deflect when he's called on his bull$shit. I've learned to counter those and not let the emotional bullying tactics get me to cave in.)  Give him the heave-ho, and have a supportive friend in the room when you inform him, and as he packs and turns in his key (change the locks afterwards too.) so he's less likely to make an unpleasant fuss with a witness who's on your side looking on."

Twin Peaks is also awesome, and so is Shadow of the Colossus (PS2 game).  PM me if you want to talk, I don't socialize enough and I'm a little concerned that part of my brain is atrophying, hahaha"
asexuality,2xmekx,tiktakti,3,Mon Mar 2 01:37:41 2015 UTC,"I shut down and get panicky whenever guys start hitting on me too. Although, unless it's really obvious, I usually don't recognize it as flirting haha. Just ""why aren't you talking to other people, not just me? Go away and spend more time with everyone else before coming back so you're paying equal attention/time to everyone."" And when it's obvious flirting, I think, ""Get away from me. I don't want to date anyone. I need to find my people so they can swoop in and save me from having to talk to this guy.""  I think you should go with what's comfortable for you. Nothing wrong with taking a good long time to get to know someone before beginning a romantic relationship. Starting out as good platonic friends allows you to build a solid, healthy foundation for any future romantic relationship anyways. You don't want to be rushed into something that you'll later regret, especially if that something turns out to be physically harmful. If the guy's just looking for a fling, then you're not missing out on anything by not flirting back. If he's worth having a relationship with, romantic or platonic, then he would know to back off and give you your space until the right time comes. It's called being respectful and considerate of other people's feelings."

asexuality,2xmekx,Trequetrum,3,Mon Mar 2 14:42:42 2015 UTC,"I think that because you live in a world without all that pesky sexuality messin' with you, you don't quite understand how the world of an allosexual really works.  People who meet and have sex that same evening are really rather rare (Perhaps a bit more common in college, but even at elevated college rates it's pretty rare.)  People who are having sex after the first date are a bit more common still, but they're certainly a minority. As a general rule, anybody you're flirting with will be aware that it's not leading quickly or inevitably toward sex.  So you can take a deep breath and try to let your anxiety settle a bit.   The movies are full of people just falling into bed with each other. Allosexuals sort of talk and act as though that's how it happens, but they're just glossing over what they consider the more mundane parts of the story.  Most relationships take some time to evolve sexually. In your case, your general disinterest in sex will slow down that advancement even further. That is to say, you don't have to worry about rejecting people or getting into really awkward uncomfortable sexual situations that first night. Even if you're hanging out with a bunch of people with high libidos.    Still, stay safe!   You shouldn't need to worry 99.9% of the time, but do still try to keep friends around for that 0.1%"

This is coming from a guy, so add the appropriate amount of salt when considering. My two cents is that if you are in a safe physical space--there are lockable doors, phones, people who you know will come to your aid if you yell out--then see what happens. Be goofy. Deliberately misinterpret things. Non-sequiturs. Just make faces. Whatever. It doesn't matter how you respond, really. If you make an ass of yourself, then hey, you know how that feels and whether you enjoyed doing it in spite of yourself. And at least you did something. It's very difficult to get worked up about the risk of rejection or doing something wrong when you have seen that the consequences of being rejected or incorrectness are actually pretty mild.  If you want to take it to the extreme, try to provoke a surprise from the person hitting on you. It's way more fun, and as a side benefit if the person hitting on you is really your kind of person, they might go along with it, and then you've led on a starting note of confidence. You remain in control of your part in the interaction. It's win-win.   So don't throw caution to the wind, but you should only give any fucks about things that are truly worth your fucks to give."

asexuality,2xmekx,Kirielis,3,Mon Mar 2 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Life is too damn short NOT to flirt back. You don't owe him anything just for having flirted with him. You will never owe sex or sexual attraction to anybody, end of story. Anyone who says otherwise disrespects you as a person, disrespects your whole gender, and doesn't deserve sex anyway. (Well, the worst that could happen actually goes well into criminal territory, but the odds are negligible.)  What's the normal thing that happens? Either you get asked out, in which case it's a great time to clarify intentions, or you grin at each other at the end of the day and go your separate ways. ""Yeah, sorry, that was just too good a line to pass up, I don't actually like you that way."" People are understanding of this because it's known that flirting isn't always serious. I shamelessly abuse that fact.   I am reading more fear-of-the-unknown in your post than anything else. Be honest with yourself, is this the case?   Now, that all said, if you choose not to flirt back, that's perfectly fine. After you get to know them in a comfortable environment and realise you like them, it is not too late to tell them and it will not end badly. All that stuff about ""I fear it will impact our friendship""? In the short term yes, as they process it and figure out their response. In the long term, if you proposition them with the same respect you've always given them, you stay friends regardless of whether you end up together. (No guarantees if you subsequently break up.)   If you're in high school, disregard all of the above. If you're in college, it depends on the people you hang out with. The above guidance works for mature adults who can handle their feelings responsibly, in a setting with other mature adults."
asexuality,2xmekx,Noneerror,5,Mon Mar 2 09:09:44 2015 UTC,"To clarify, it's college upperclassmen so some form of maturity maybe. Also, fear-of-the-unknown is a yes. I think mixed with fear-of-not-being-in-control. When I don't know how to act in a situation, I feel out of control and uncomfortable. Basically, this shit be scary. I know you are right, but couldn't you just say, curl up into a ball and ignore human beings? Or, you just tell me exact steps on how to do everything: 1. flirt back 2. ???? 3. relationship.  I have this terrible feeling that I should put myself out there to make mistakes and learn, in order to understand what I want and how I should go about getting it. I don't like missing out on things because I am afraid, and I think you hit the nail on the head by pointing out it is fear. Fear usually leads me to go to the extreme of avoiding situations all together because something might happen. Shoooot, Kirielis, why must you be so insightful?? Now, I have to confront my inner self before I had my morning coffee."
asexuality,2xmekx,Kirielis,3,Mon Mar 2 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"I have always believed that the best way to combat fear-of-the-unknown is with knowledge and planning.   Alright. So step 2 between flirting and a relationship can actually happen several ways. You're not interested in casual hookups, but only in actual relationships, so here is a useful script to get there. It isn't the only script, but it should be a sufficient guideline until you're confident to do this on your own.  One of you asks the other out. You go on a date and get to know the other person. It's still all fun and games at this point. No expectations. But because you're new to each other, if he's making you uncomfortable, say so. (Great way to evaluate if he's going to respect your boundaries, too!) If first date goes well, there will be a second. Somewhere in the second date, bring up the topic of ""what are we doing here together"". Either he wants a relationship and wants to see where this goes, or he doesn't.   Be ready to step back and say, ""Sorry, now that we've gotten to know each other better, I don't think we're actually compatible. It's not your fault, sometimes these things just happen."" There's no fixed timeline for when to decide this. But again, as long as we're dealing with mature adults, the situation is not going to go out of control.   Go get 'em. You can do it!"
asexuality,2xmekx,Noneerror,4,Mon Mar 2 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"As someone who can strongly empathize with /u/tiktakti you are coming at it from a completely different starting point:   It's still all fun and games at this point.   The problem is that it is not fun. At least not for me, and I don't think for OP either. It is simply unpleasant. Like OP I've used words like ""fear"" and ""anxiety"" to describe feelings when someone has flirted with me and those words never fit well on my palate. I appreciate flirting, (even like it) but I do not enjoy it. I want to bring attention to the other words used:   don't know what to do not interested I just freeze I feel threatened turns me off  freaks me out uncomfortable fear-of-not-being-in-control   For years I thought it was fear and it is not. (At least for me.) Have you ever listened to a cringe-worthy performance? It's more like that- it's off-key, with all the wrong notes being hit and it's solely for your benefit. You nod and smile and put up with it but it is not pleasant while appreciating that they think highly enough of you to go through the effort. Still it's something to endure, not enjoy. You just want to shrink away and pretend it never happened- not out of fear but out of cringe. Many people thoroughly enjoy cringe-worthy performances and many sitcoms are based entirely on that. I don't enjoy it and just want to change the channel as soon as possible.  The fear/anxiety comes from the expectation that when it is done that you'll have to reciprocate and sing for them. And you're tone deaf. Sure with a bit of practice you can fake it. The problem is you are practicing something you don't like and don't understand so you can endure it more in the future. Sure the anxiety will go away, except the anxiety was never a real problem to begin with. If you do a good job of faking it until you make it, then you'll get a second date with loud bagpipe music."
asexuality,2xmekx,Noneerror,4,Tue Mar 3 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"Well written and informative. Thank you. Please, OP, if you find that it's not a fear response after all but plain and simple dislike, don't push yourself to keep trying."
asexuality,2xmekx,Kirielis,2,Tue Mar 3 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"You mention faking it, and I think you are spot on with how that can go. Because I used to fake it all the time. For a while, I had a fear of males (more like intimacy, but it manifested with males cause I am straight-romantic). I would laugh and pretend it was alright, but inside I was screaming. I was honestly terrified to hug them or be in the same room with them. But I acted like nothing was wrong because I thought maybe that would make my fear go away. Then, I talked about it, and I realized my fear was of losing control of my boundaries. I think what Kirielis is saying is that those who are worth it will respect my boundaries, so I should remain confident in what I find comfortable. I could be wrong, but, what I got out of it (and what helps me feel better) is that it's okay for me to state what I want. And it is also okay for them to walk away or me to walk away if they don't respect that.  You are right about the different starting points. For me, right now, it still takes effort for me to feel comfortable about stating what I want. But, this time, I won't be doing the song and dance, I will be doing whatever the hell I want. Basically, I am being super lame and agreeing with both of you. Because I did the faking it thing, and I know how shitty that felt. But when I realized it was my confidence in myself to set up my boundaries, I felt a lot better when I focused on improving that then pretending everything was okay."
asexuality,2xl95t,SuitableDragonfly,4,Sun Mar 1 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, I can.  I've been wondering about posting something like this myself for a long time, but never felt up to it.  I don't read romance novels, but I do read romantic/erotic fanfiction, and unlike you the sex doesn't bother me at all (I'm pretty indifferent about it, except that sometimes when it goes on for long periods of time it starts to bore me), but otherwise I'm similar; I'm aromantic, I like the buildup of the relationship much more than the happily ever after, I don't much care for stories where everyone is already in love.  I've also written romantic (but not sexual) fanfic, though the longest one was only about 20k words, so you have me beat there. ;)  I used to be heteroromantic a long time ago (before I knew anything about asexuality; that was a confusing time), so I always wondered if my interest in romance was just some sort of nostalgia for that, so it's pretty neat to hear that you enjoy it too!  As for writing tips - when I started writing fanfic, I wasn't originally going to put any romance in it at all, since I was afraid I wouldn't be able to represent it properly, but at some point I realized I had to include a particular romantic subplot in order for the situation to work out.  What I did at that point was I wound up thinking very very hard about the thoughts and feelings of the characters, what the romantic attraction meant to them specifically, how they were influenced by their own notions of romance and their particular situations, etc.  And I rewrote the first chapter three or four times before I got something I was satisfied with.  This was actually for Homestuck, where the author has defined four different types of alien romance involving different feelings, so I went that way because, you know, aliens, but I figure you could probably apply the same strategy to human romance, since it's a little alien to us as well.  I'm sure it probably helped to have read a lot of this stuff already by then, too.  After that, it was much easier.  If you know your characters, and how they feel, it's easy to write them.  I don't think there is one particular set of romantic feelings that everbody who has them feels, it all depends heavily on the circumstances.  Or at least that's my belief.  But thank you for making this post, so I could have something to relate to, too!"
asexuality,2xl95t,SuitableDragonfly,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've never felt romantic attraction towards someone, I don't think, just platonic attraction. It is kind of hard getting into the characters' heads when it comes to that, so it takes forever for the characters to start feeling things for each other, because that way I can truly get to know them, and I can familiarize myself with their stances on romance and how they personally feel attraction.  I feel a bit more ""normal"" now that I've discovered at least someone who's similar to me in that aspect haha."

Oh, totally.  I think it's quite a bit easier to get into characters' heads when writing fanfiction (especially if you're not like me and don't spend huge amounts of time planning stuff out beforehand) because you've already read tons of stories about these characters so you've already done a lot of thinking about what they're like before you even start writing, whereas you are starting from scratch.  I don't have a ton of advice, really, except what worked for me, and I know I tend to spend perhaps too much time cogitating about things before writing them, so."

If you don't already read her books, check them out. Her characters never get past a kiss, so no need to worry about feeling uncomfortable with too much intimacy. I would highly recommend her as a literary example for you if you're interested. I consider myself a romantic as well as being romantic, so these books are some of my favorites. I do hope you haven't already read her work and disliked it.  I've never done any writing myself so I'm afraid I wouldn't be much use on that end. However, I can relate to people assuming that I must be longing for a relationship if I'm reading these books. That is absolutely not the case. These books end up giving me all the romance I need in my life. I read them because they're stories about people finding genuine happiness. I read them because I absolutely love stories with lively, colorful characters, who go on somewhat wacky adventures, and always end up happy in the end. I watch movies with the same elements. It's just the type of story I like.  And while we're (I'm) talking about books, I'd like to throw in P.G. Wodehouse as an amazing author who I think did a fantastic job (that not many authors do these days) or creating characters who don't have to end up in heavily romantic or dramatically romantic situations. If any big literary character is asexual, I would bet on Bertram Wooster. So I'd read some of those for absolutely the best wordplay ever written and fantastic humor without having to fret about your main character being shoved into a forced romantic plot to conclude the book. (Although romantic subplots are common themes. Many of his books are Bertie helping his friend get the girl/guy)."

I can handle stories with slight sex if their relationship is incredibly strong, but if they do it left and right it eventually bores and irritates me. But I love seeing people care about each other. Warms my heart. However, I wouldn't want that for myself.  For some reason, sex is fiction to me. It feels almost surreal when I see sex in movies or hear about it being done in real life. I usually try and ignore it because I'm actually sex-repulsed. But lately I've become more accepting of it. (Because it's everywhere..)"

Having had to talk to dozens of people about the most intimate and horrible thing that could possibly happen to me made me realize that I am NOT AT ALL like most people.  Most people are so far from asexual that they are completely incapable of seeing sex as a sacred or important act to someone.  Since coming forward, I've had people telling me    that I actually wanted it that I had to have been signalling sexual interest to my rapist when I say that's impossible, they counter that it's impossible to be asexual that I should ""just get over it"" that I should just try to have more sex to ""cancel out"" memories of the rape (basically that one day I would find a partner whose dick would make me magically forget losing my virginity to rape)   Lawyers and police seem to be particularly incapable of understanding asexuality, for some reason.  My first lawyer actually said that a jury would never ""buy it""."

Just know that such a transgression doesn't define you, detract from you, invalidate your identity, or imply that you invited the crime on yourself. A lot of us appreciate that, even if the lawyers don't.  Also, I'm really intrigued by something you said (but if you don't want to answer or talk about it that's totally ok, I understand): you mentioned that ""most people are so far from asexual that they are incapable of seeing sex as a sacred or important act."" As an ace do you view sex this way, as a sacred, profound interaction even though you aren't interested in it? (I assume this but I could be wrong, correct me if necessary, please.) How do you think about sex overall, in an abstract sense? I just think this is a really interesting perspective since most aces I know see sex in a very different light, as a mundane, primal compulsion that has little value or nobility. It's the sexual peeps I know that think of sex more spiritually. I fall kinda in the middle as a gray-ace/demi; some sex is 'soul sex', the sex that fuses spirits and is important and beautiful and dangerous, and other sex is basically a silly, naked hobby that holds the same emotional/spiritual weight as cooking pasta or watching a whole season of parks and rec in one sitting.   So I guess the TLDR is: how do you view sex overall, and what's your relationship with the concept and the act? You just seem to have really unique thoughts on this and I'd love to hear more."

I'm not religious, but I grew up interested in spirituality, so in middle school when I started to feel different for not being at all interested in sex, I just figured it meant that I was on a different spiritual track from most people.  Since sex creates new life, is the closest you can physically be to another person, causes your brain to release heroin-level pleasure/bonding hormones, may make you very sick or kill you, and requires you spend lots of time with the most physically unattractive parts of the human body, I've just never been able to see as anything besides a very strange and sacred ritual to be undertaken extremely carefully.

Cuz even though I find myself very rarely attracted to people sexually, I'm not sex-averse and I think of sex as (at least potentially) a very powerful, spiritual experience. In fact, that aspect of it is the only thing that really holds my interest on the subject; the purely physical pleasure of sex scores below (for me) the pleasure of listening to good music, or finishing a six mile run. It's nice, sure, but I could take it or leave it. It's the psychic/emotional/spiritual component of sex that is irreplaceable, compelling, profound. I totally get that a lot of aces/grays don't see sex this way, and that's fine (fo real, it is), but I'm happy to find peeps in this demographic that do."

No, the fact that I'm not attracted to people like they are probably isn't on my friends or family's ""top 100 thing I'm worrying about"" list. So does my sexuality affect my identity?

It was something I came into over time. My sexuality peaked when I was 18 and has been on a decline ever since.   A combination of antidepressants and a crippling fear I will become pregnant again killed off any remaining sex drive I had. I believe sexually is fluid, so it doesn't really bother me.  The most aggravating thing is talking to someone about it and them telling me to just ""try harder"". Like, no, that isn't how it works. It isn't a switch I can turn on or off. If I feel like sex, it is there for a moment and gone in a flash."
asexuality,2xlww9,xxonemoredayxx,3,Mon Mar 2 06:07:57 2015 UTC,"Meh, I'll bring it up if the topic of conversation is sex, my being ace seems relevant, and I haven't told the people I'm talking to yet. Usually it doesn't really matter though, I still make lewd jokes and stuff, but I don't have much to contribute to convos about actually having sex and being a sexual person, and I don't really participate in the ""THAT PERSON IS SO HOT"" stuff or have any interest in finding someone to bang, but then again, neither do some of my friends who aren't ace, so no big deal."
asexuality,2xlww9,drh1138,3,Mon Mar 2 02:11:43 2015 UTC,"For a long time I saw sexuality/physical intimacy as weakness or flaw, something to be overcome or suppressed or ignored. I thought I was ABOVE it, and that my identity depended on distancing myself from it, transcending it (i'm actually demi, btw). But after some acid, some long talks, and some sex (yeah), I decided that sex is like any other thing you can do: it's just a thing you can do. It doesn't define you or characterize you, it's just an experience you can have, like going on a road trip or reading an entire book in one day. You don't identify as a road-tripper or one-day book reader, right? So why base your identity on your sexual experiences or preferences? It just seems silly when you look at it that way. So now, I acknowledge my sexuality but it really doesn't play into who I am as a person.   My gender ID, on the other hand, is a totally different thing, and weirder. In a lot of ways I identify with the opposite gender (male) but I realize that what I'm identifying with is the fucked up Western, Christian societal standards for maleness, and not maleness itself. So I'm actually very comfortable with my birth-assigned gender (female), because all that implies TO ME is that I have a pussy and superior color distinction capabilities. And all kinds of social privilege. Which are all fun things to have. So I enjoy being a chick but it really has VERY LITTLE to do with my sexuality and romanticism. It's weird how separate these things can be, right?"

I'm not saying that the high-school society that I am forced to involve myself in is homophobic or a haven for bigotry, most people are just assume that you are straight, and tend not to believe otherwise. one thing that kind of tipped me off in the first place, especially that my group of associates and those I spend my school time with will, without a doubt, bring up sex or it's related topics more that once.   It really shows something about society when ""You'll be the last person in this school to lose your virginity"" is the go-to insult. Yes, maybe I will, but my main focus in life is not dropping my pants and  helicoptering in front of a group of eligible sex crazed sluts for some sort of sport."

It enables him to have sex with other women (or men, but I think they've all been women so far) that aren't just one night stands or prostitutes.  It's working for us. We have a great friendship.

It's definitely possible to find a straight person willing to accomodate for our asexuality, though I have no idea how common or rare it is, and whether such people are easier or harder to find than aces.

We were best friends for years before dating, so I'd like to think he loved my mind/personality before my body.

Here are a few:  Current active AVEN thread for asexual-spectrum people with various fetishes and kinks  Stanford Daily piece where someone describes their experiences being asexual and kinky   Back in 2013, the Asexual Agenda blog had a Carnival of Aces (a monthly blogging carnival in which members of the asexual community blog about a topic) theme about asexuality and kink. This is the roundup of all the posts that were submitted, so there's lots of information there and you can even contact some of those people about it if they're still active on their blogs.  I'd also recommend contacting nextstepcake on tumblr and wordpress since they're pretty informative and they are more familiar with research into asexuality. Here's one of their posts on being asexual and having kinks.   There are still a lot more resources out there, but I hope these few will point you in the right direction to finding more."

I'm not sure if the men's section at H&M counts as high fashion, but the clothes are nice enough to get my style on lol. My sexuality has come into question but I'm just like ""Nah, straight dudes can like clothes, too. Back ya self up.""  As for the outdoors, I live in an area known for its nature so I'm outside as often as I can manage because it's beautiful, though I'm not opposed to staying in just reading books or something.

If you later find your feelings changing, that's no problem.  Lots of asexuals masturbate, watch porn and use fantasies. It's because having a physical sex drive is just part of owning a body, its needs can be very insistent especially during adolescence when your hormones are raging.  My fantasies, for what it's worth, are like watching a custom made video. The people in them are fictional strangers.

You're going through hormonal shit on top of living an extremely sheltered life, and it sounds like you were raised pretty strict to be repulsed by the naked human body.   What you need to do is get over your anxiety towards women and start talking to them. Go out with your friends more and be a regular human.  Almost nobody on this sub is even close to asexual. They're highly delusional forever-alones that are trying to come to terms with basically being ugly and highly undesirable in terms of personality, hygiene, and wealthy. These people aren't asexual, they're just social failures trying to cope with not fitting in and keep trying to tell themselves they're simply not suited for having relationships or sex with either gender.... They're just gamers and weeabos stuck at home all the time, trying to tell themselves that all they like are material possessions, and TV shows, and videogames, and engaging in ""intellectually stimulating philosophical discussions"" and other bullshit. They try to ignore what they can't have, so they just delude themselves into thinking they're asexual and don't even like other people at all. They're suppressing themselves because they're tired of going unnoticed and being undesired by everyone else, instead of just taking a fucking shower, exercising, and telling their inner pussy selves to just shut the fuck up and grow enough balls to at least TALK to people. For Christ's sakes people, just talk to people, eventually you won't feel so socially awkward and nervous around people, especially the gender you're attracted to.  You're not asexual either, not even close. You're just sheltered and hormonally confused, and highly inexperienced and young.  Get off this sub and just get out more.

And your replies show an angry dude with no respect for others choices.   Low self-esteemed angsty little self.   And what makes you think I suffer from any of these issues?   Hitting random on reddit.   I'm apparently the low-esteemed one, yet you can't even find subs interesting enough to troll by yourself, so you have to rely on an automated program to do it for you?   lonely gamers/anime/TV freaks with no lives.   Again. You don't know me, you don't know the people in this sub. I would put money down that most of us have a better, more fulfilling social life than yourself.  Whatever you think I do, whatever you think my profession is, you will be wrong. Because your biases and your preconceptions, will not allow you to believe what I do. I say this with certainty, because I know your type. You think I am unemployed, or work in a minimum wage job. You think I spend all my free time in front of a computer/TV screen. You think I have no friends that I can spend time with. You think I don't know any females, that I think they're scary and to be avoided.  You know what?  You're wrong. Completely wrong.  I am not full on angst. I am not mad, or angry. I am giving you things to think about. If you don't like it, if you think you're making me mad, you are wrong. I have much better things to do with my time than get annoyed with people on the internet. But if you think you can come and say that my sexuality is a lie, and that I am only thinking the way I am because I can't get laid, then you can get straight back out of here on the cart that dragged you in."

You children and older gamer/TV addicts with poor hygiene, aelf esteem, and looks have conditioned yourselves into thinking youre not sexually attracted to anyone, you pretend to believe that almost nobody sexually interests you at all. It's all a facade to hide the fact that you hate yourselves for being unwanted, for being indesirable, fo4 being too much of a pussy to approach anyone. So you tell yourself that all you need is mostly a few material possessions and maybe a little human contact with your bros once in a while, and you constantly tell yourself its all you need. You have to constantly tell yourselves because at the same time you know youre bullshitting yourself, but you believe that eventually the placebo will kick in, but it wont. That is why you guys created a circle jerking support group to console each other over your false asexuality. If you were truly asexual you wouldnt be constantly telling yourself that you are, and you wouldnt be interested in talking to people about sex and sexual attraction the same way I wouldnt be visiting manga subreddits if I truly believed it was for virgin nerds. If you were truly asexual, you wouldnt give a shit that you are and bitch about it on this sub.   It is so obvious that real reason you are here is to get people to help you convince yourself you are asexual so you can stop worrying about dating, relationships, and that whole entire aspect of life.  Now if you are bi or bicurious, you have mistaken the definition of asexuality as someone that would fuck any human that moves, but no this subreddit is for posers pretending they unwillingly have nonsexual attraction when the truth is they constantly suppress it so they can stop being sad and depressed about their failures to get anyone. Try going to /r/lgbt if you are actually bi."

Which... I haven't! Literally never had any interest. I fell into a relationship that lasted for three years in which I had plenty of sex, which I didn't hate, just wasn't really into it. Haven't felt sexual attraction to anyone before that, since then, or even during my relationship; the sensations felt nice, sure, and I enjoyed the physical and emotional closeness as well as giving pleasure to my partner, but never felt any sexual attraction, or drive for sex specifically (as opposed to masturbation; libido is distinct from sexual attraction and not a factor of asexuality).  The uncertainty present in discussions on this sub, I think, comes from the confusion involved with living in an extremely sexual world, and the nebulousness of sexuality. For some, sexual attraction is a very obvious feeling, but when you don't know whether you've felt it or not, it can be a very confusing thing to think about. It's a very subjective phenomenon. Even some sexual people are unsure whether they're straight or gay or bi or whatever. Sexuality is not always so easy to pin down.  So, am I a tru asexual yet??? Please give me affirmation, I need a stranger to validate my feelings :("

Now you're experiencing a drought in your sex life and playing it off like it's something you can't control because all of a sudden you magically converted to being asexual. You're just trying to wear a title for the sake of having a title, and you choose asexuality so it looks cool and unique and makes people want to talk to you about it more.

The problems you are facing involve internal issues like your partner losing confidence in himself, which you may not be in a good position to resolve - the partner status and what it means to him may trigger the feelings regardless of what you are doing, and that can stop progress. Because of this you may have success if you involve an emotionally distant third party who can help discuss the issues in detail and communicate for both of you."

asexuality,2xbf8s,SultanofShit,3,Sat Feb 28 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think you should tell her. Being asexual means we do not experience sexual attraction, but it doesn't mean we aren't interested in anyone, period. Many asexuals still desire romantic relationships, and some are even willing to be sexual with a partner. You just have to be careful to respect her boundaries if you do find yourself in a relationship. As long as she hasn't expressed disgust with the concept of relationships, you probably don't have to worry about that. She may still say no, though, because she is aromantic or just not interested in you, so you have to be ready for that possibility. But no matter what happens, telling her will give you some closure and the comfort that knowing you tried, and you won't always wonder ""what if?"""
asexuality,2xbf8s,falling2geeses,2,Sat Feb 28 23:48:05 2015 UTC,"Not all asexual people are ""disgusted"" by sexuality in general. Some are, but the only thing being asexual necessarily implies is not feeling sexual attraction. If you want my opinion: you like her, she likes you; you should at least discuss your feelings and priorities to see if you think a relationship is feasible. How important is sex to you? Is she totally sex averse, enjoys it but simply doesn't feel attraction to people, or somewhere in between? It's far from unheard of for asexual people to have relationships with non-asexual people, but those relationships are not without their difficulties.  And no, you are decidedly not awful. Your worries are perfectly understandable and not your fault."
asexuality,2xbf8s,DefinitelyNotwafle,2,Sat Feb 28 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"If anything it is less likely you will disgust her and less likely you'll put your existing friendship at risk. People on the grey-ace spectrum are generally very accepting of the existence of the sexual wants and needs of others. They may not want to participate but they can look at it objectively and call it what it is.  It is a completely separate issue whether she'd be interested in a relationship or not. That still might be a hell no. Unlike other women, that wouldn't be a rejection of you though.  I think you could ask her and as long as you do it respectfully I think the existing friendship would be on safe ground even if she says no. (Many asexuals are cuddle whores.)"
asexuality,2xbf8s,Noneerror,2,Sun Mar 1 06:21:20 2015 UTC,"If someone I know and like shows interest, I'll hear them out. Their feelings are valid and they're not violating a boundary I've set, which is reason enough to let them talk.   So, let's see. My probable response to such a declaration from a friend: either ""Thank you for your honesty. Let's talk expectations. What are you looking for in this relationship?"" or ""Thank you for your honesty. I am very sorry, but I do not have such an interest in you."" (Or replace with any other reason, but it will be a true reason.)   You can tell, the key here is pretty much to show that you'll respect her decision and her boundaries. If she's self-aware enough to have come out as ace, she's likely also to respect the validity of your feelings regardless of her own. Ergo, no matter the result, the relationship stays amicable at minimum.   If it's someone I don't know, all bets are off."

It would be nice if the question mark was a question mark- rather than an assumed given, or period- to stretch the metaphor.   I do recognize that it's helpful to consider all possibilities when trying to diagnose something. On the other hand, random people on the internet aren't generally qualified to give medical advice. If my doctor wants to take information into consideration to keep me healthy, that's totally cool. It's when random people, people who are probably not doctors, and certainly not my doctor, tell me that I simply must be ill that I get annoyed. I think I'll hold onto my optimism for a while yet though.  Plenty of other things have changed after all! Why not this attitude too?"

Until we get a non-biased confirmation from science; maybe we should all open our minds, and think about it. It could very well be a normal variation of human sexuality.  But my main point is that you shouldn't be demonizing people who think differently when you don't have evidence to back yourself up.   It's Hypocritical of people to expect respect when they can't even respect others.  I don't hate you, I don't even dislike you. In fact, I wouldn't mind having a nice friendly conversation with you. But with your narrow-minded attitude right now, I can't.  Bogaert A.F. (2004) Asexuality: Its Prevalence and Associated Factors in a National Probability Sample. Journal of Sex Research, 41, 279-287 I have pulled from http://www.asexualexplorations.net/home/extantresearch.html, seems to quote: ""I used data from a national probability sample (N = 18,000) of British residents to investigate asexuality, defined as having no sexual attraction to a partner of either sex. Approximately 1% (n = 195) of the sample indicated they were asexual. A number of factors were related to asexuality, including gender (i.e., more women than men), short stature, low education, low socioeconomic status, and poor health. Asexual women also had a later onset of menarche relative to sexual women. The results suggest that a number of pathways, both biological and psychosocial, contribute to the development of asexuality."" Asexual people seem to have poorer overall health than sexual people.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoactive_sexual_desire_disorder seems to fit Asexuality. However it must cause marked distress. I personally do not feel like it needs to cause distress- it's just that those who arent distressed by it dont feel prompted to see a doctor about it; so the only people who've been studied for HSDD have been the ones who see a problem, leaving out those who don't."

It feels like a relationship that is a waste of my time because it isn't based on friendship, it's based on a need for companionship which somehow seems less legit because it's more dire.

Some people use sexual and romantic interchangeably. Some people use ""sexual"" to describe purely physical attraction while ""romantic""  to describe the emotional aspect of an allosexual relationship marked by certain things they believe are not in platonic relationships. By my definitions and from what you have told me, you would be aromantic because you do not desire to passionately have sex/kiss to build up a relationship with someone. I would also classify you as ""low sexual physical desire""??? Lol I'm actually not too clear but there are a lot of people in the asexual community who do react to certain sexual stimulations but that doesn't mean they aren't ace. it's up to you which communities feel right and what you want to identify as. I really feel that you could fit in the ace and aro communities though.  Also  If you do not feel attracted to anyone and that's just how you are, NO YOU DO NOT need to just have some ""sexual awakening"" like your friends told you. There's nothing wrong with not being sexually attracted to people.  Intimacy comes in many forms. Not just ""dating"" or ""romance"". Friendships can be just as meaningful. You shouldn't have to force yourself to date that guy just because society tells you that not having a ""boyfriend"" makes you ""alone"".

Enjoy masturbating if that is what you want to do. It's natural. Feeling bad about your body and having no confidence are probably also related to your Catholic upbringing as well as your being a teen girl, a population not known for healthy body image or confidence.  Wanting to develop a strong relationship with your sexual partner is natural and normal. Not everyone enjoys casual sex even if a person is a sexual creature normally.

asexuality,2x1lyc,emithecheme,5,Wed Feb 25 03:32:48 2015 UTC,I think the main thing is that articles like this never talk about the spectrum. In all honesty asexuality sounds like a joke if this was the only thing you'd ever read on it.  I'm aro ace so I'm as far on side of the spectrum as you can get. And explaining what that is and then saying there's a spectrum - going on to explain demisexuality/gray-a and romantic attraction I think would probably make it easier for people who've never encountered the concept before to understand.
asexuality,2x1lyc,Kali711,4,Wed Feb 25 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"My beef with it wasn't so much the comments, as they were simply replying to the information they were presented (as fact). The author clearly stated multiple times that asexuals never or rarely enjoy sex, so of course come the replies of 'I don't want sex 24/7, so I must be asexual'. One person said, 'technically I'm demisexual because I'm abstinent for religious reasons' (???) I've been in a relationship for two years, and we've lived together for one. We've never had sex. Would the commenters say I am normal and just want a special label?  The article itself was just bad, especially coming from a website that covers a lot of queer and GSM issues. There's no differentiation made between desire and orientation. No mention of 'if you can be attracted to both, why can't you be attracted to neither'. A high-libido ace who doesn't realize that that's what they are could easily read this and say it didn't describe them. And then the author throws in a, 'they must have so much free time!'"
asexuality,2x1lyc,oskietje,3,Wed Feb 25 09:39:26 2015 UTC,"So, I read the comments here first and prepared myself for the article's comments. Then I go over and start reading and thinking it's not TOO horrible, but I kept reading and that's when they turned truly ugly.  Even though the article states that asexuality is simply not feeling sexual attraction, everyone in the comments isn't making this distinction, and why would they? To almost everyone sexual attraction and libido is the same thing, works in tandem.   I think in future articles the author needs to use a good analogy for the difference between attraction and libido and an asexual with a high sex drive.   Maybe that would make more of an impact?"

There is no empirical data for me to provide you, but porn viewing by asexuals is a very variable thing. Some asexuals watch porn and masturbate. Some do only the former, or only the latter. Some do neither.  Personally, I've slipped into a few fits of porn-watching and/or masturbating (more of the latter — things get vulgar when you spend your days at home). Admiring faces, bodies, or anything else human is referred to aesthetic attraction. There is great appeal in the human form for many people, but for many asexuals who still appreciate the human aesthetic, it does not have a sexual urgency to it.  Unfortunately, I have no dating site options to show you. That is territory I am absolutely alien to. I'm sure someone else may, however."

I'm sure some asexuals watch porn. I don't, but that's pretty irrelevant, since no two people are the same and every person's in a slightly different place on the spectrum. My advice to you is to not obsess over the label for your sexuality, since that can confine you into only doing the things that you think fit into it. So... if you think you're ace, that's awesome! If not, that's awesome, too. And if you're uncertain, that's totally fine, since most people go back and forth or are not entirely certain - that's just realistically how it works, IMHO"

Needless to say, r/asexuality applies to the latter for the reasons OP said.  What bothers me about Reddit though is that the subreddits of the former category are significantly more active than many of the much MUCH better ones.  Perhaps I need to surf Reddit more.  As youksdpr rightfully said, all the social media communities dedicated to asexuality are slightly different.  However, they overall manage to be very helpful and supportive from what I've seen.  It was because of them I was able to realize why I think the way I do, and readied me to be able to share what I learned about myself with others.  The only worry I have now at this point are the reactions to me being an aromantic asexual, I always thought typing up some sort of FAQ (to carry around in my pocket or wallet) to answer all possible questions/comments they'll throw at me would be helpful in these situations.  I have a feeling that I'll be able to memorize it front and back eventually ;).  EDIT: I doubt anyone will be able to read this at this point, but I've been lurking through reddit the past couple of days, boy howdy I was right when I said I needed to surf Reddit more!!

I get what you're saying about imagining things done to you, but not attracted to the other partner, this all sounds ace to me. Grey-ace means people who feel fleeting or infrequent sexual attraction, sometimes people feel it, but not desire to act on it; sounds to me like you don't feel it. Keep in mind, that's not the same thing as giving up: it's perfectly okay to accept that you don't feel sexual attraction, and labels are descriptive (of what you've experienced) not prescriptive (of what you will experience), so you can change it of your experiences change.  I also understand the crushes and prince fantasies. I call them crushes and for me their non-sexual, but not entierly platonic. I might want my crush's attention, and to look at his nice face, but I've never dated any and can't tell if it's a romantic thing (hence the difficulty with (a)romantic orientation).  If it turns out romantic relationships aren't your style, you might consider queerplatonic realtionships. You aren't doomed to be alone just for being ace."

asexuality,2wupbh,Kali711,1 point,Wed Feb 25 09:31:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds like grey-ace, maybe? If you are not entirely sure about the sexual attraction, part, just go with whichever description you feel most comfortable with.   As far as romantic attraction goes, I'm as stumped as you. You seem to be in love with the idea of being in love but not the actual situation (if I'm reading that correctly).   But again, just identify with whatever fits at the moment. Even though you are confused but still leaning more towards heteroromantic, go for it, but if you think that doesn't quite feel right then go with aromantic. Labels are for yourself not anyone else :)"
asexuality,2wuoqb,ziroh,6,Mon Feb 23 07:53:53 2015 UTC,"Some people have a responsive desire style, and will only really get into the idea of sex once they're already doing something sexual. If you ask and she says yes, you're not forcing her into anything. She's taking the opportunity to do something she may really enjoy once it gets going.  Talk things over. Be honest and nonjudgmental. Give sex with her another shot, because from what I understand a lot of people take a while to sort of figure out how to make sex worth with a particular partner.  Understand that if things don't work out, it's nobody's fault.  Hopefully you'll both be able to find the kind of fulfillment you need from one another."

I admit that I struggled with relationships for a long time. Not because I'm not interested in them. I'm cuddlier than a puppy. But because of the high sexuality of those who were my love interest. It just, really didn't work all that well, is all that I'll say.   But then I met my current boyfriend. And he is GREAT. We have the same interest, are both very cuddly and romantic persons. And, although he doesn't identify himself as ACE(he does feel some form of sexual attraction), he has so little libido he might as well be.   Sex is pretty much an easy matter: Neither of us are opposed to it. So, if one of us wants it (every 3 months or so), we do it. But it's really an occasionnal matter. A BIG difference from my previous relationship, where my BF would harass me constantly about it. He's not the best person in bed, but to know the relation is done freely, without any pressure, is such a relief! It's also a relief to know I can hug him without him starting to get ideas in his mind, and that when HE comes to hug me, it's not because he wants something else. That he genuinely does just want a hug. (again, unlike my ex)  We're still rather early in our relationship (one year and almost 2 months), but I can see myself staying with him for a very long time, maybe even marrying him, who knows? =3   So yeah, that's my relationship <3"
asexuality,2wsj28,AerisaFoxFeather,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:32:48 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of friends who are married or otherwise romantically committed. One important factor might be that in a lot of cases, I met them after the relationship was already established, so I didn't have to deal with my friend starting to spend more time with a significant other than with me, I just came onto the scene and the significant other was already there.  Of my married friends, in most circumstances I consider myself friends with both partners in the marriage. Either I meet someone and start getting to know them, then they introduce me to their spouse, or I meet both of them at the same time. It's important that neither partner be the irrationally jealous type... I'm not romantically inclined anyway, but if someone is likely to get upset that I'm hanging out with their spouse, it'll be hard for me to be friends with them. After I've known a couple for a long time and become close friends with both of them, a lot of the time I'll almost become part of the family. (It might help that a lot of my married friends are older than me, and wind up looking out for me in something similar to a parental capacity.)  So there is hope. I have a lot of close friendships that are important to me, and the fact that people pair off just means that a lot of the time I get two friends out of the deal instead of just one."

I'm bisexual-asexual and he's straight, so it's been a bit of a trip trying to reconcile my ties to the queer community with this relationship which is really really straight. I think most people view me as a hasbian or as someone who would rather be with a woman and is just settling. I make jokes about it, but it hurts because I feel like they will never take us seriously, and the fact that it's coming from the GLBT community is even worse. That said, I love the crap out of him and we're really comfortable with each other. The honeymoon stage is definitely over but we're still together, which is a big deal because I used to be the sort of person who just did not care at all about anything and this has forced me to mellow out and grow up a bit because my behavior impacted another person's well-being."

That sort of thing, sexual liberation. It doesn't mean you're interested in having it, but it causes problems when people don't understand how you can be ace and sex+. You could research the term ""sex-favourable"" (of ""favorable"" if you're in the US) to see if it fits. It's certainly possible that you and your friends are ace. Have you considered that you became or remain friends because of similarities you hadn't previously named?

Be who you are, not who you're expected to be.   You're a variant of the same person you've always been. Putting a name to your sexuality didn't change that. Sure, that sort of realization can shake a person, but it ultimately should have little effect on who you really are. You may seem to change, your actions might be different, your attitude towards life could be different-- but I don't see any of those as true change. I see those things as you righting the disparity between your actions-- your outward self --and who you really are on the inside.   You don't need sex to have love. A relationship built on sex is an unhealthy one. For most people, sex is a component of a healthy marriage, but it's far from necessary. If you think it is, that's because it's pretty much assumed to be, because let's face it, we are the one percent. We're a minority, and culture won't design itself around our needs and our perspectives.   If you're happy with the idea-- flaunt your sexuality. I'm not advising you to only wear purple and grey, nor am I advising you to join a queer pride parade-- but I am advising you to see your sexuality as legitimate. You're not messed up, just uncommon. What I'm saying is, you shouldn't feel the need to be ashamed and hide. Are there people who you should hide your sexuality from? Probably. People tend to be kind of bigoted and stupid-- I'm sure you know people like that.   Hope it helps."

I can feel isolating when you realize you're part of a minority, especially an invisible one, so I recommend finding ace communities, like this one, and/or ace-book.net.

There's someone out there for everyone, or at least I'd like to think so. What you describe is eerily similar to what happens with me; the way I see it, the more you learn how to just say ""Fuck it, this is the way I am and I'm OK with that"" the more confidence you'll have when talking to girls.   And, at least with me, it helps to be upfront about it. It prevents awkwardness down the line. Just tell 'em you're not looking for a sexual relationship, and whatever happens happens; just always know that it's not because of any ""curse."" Will it be a confusing path going forward? Yes. But it can be extremely rewarding, because you'll be learning how to be comfotable in your own skin :)  Also, I don't know if this is gonna help or not, but the couple of my girl friends that I've told about my sexuality tell me that I have no idea how many girls are looking for a relationship without the canoodling/whatever the kids call it these days. You'll find someone eventually but from what you wrote, it sounds like you need to focus on you at the moment. I feel like I rambled, but I hope you got something out of it."

asexuality,2wsm5a,fannarrativeftw,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:03:20 2015 UTC,"Your libido, or ""sex drive,"" is about how often you want sex (or in this context sexual stimulation). That means if you're walking around your house, or making a sandwich, doing nothing particularly arousing, you might find yourself ""horny,"" and may choose to masturbate. If you have a high sex drive, you get horny a lot, and may seek out sex often. If you have a low sex drive, you're infrequently ""horny."" If you're asexual, you're not aroused by people, so even though your body/mind may crave stimulation, even frequently (if you have a high libido) you probably wouldn't imagine having sex woth a particular partner as a masturbatory fantasy. Plenty of aces still enjoy porn or erotica without imagining themselves as a participant (it's called autochorissexualism).  Someone who isn't ace would (I suppose) still be sexually attracted to people, but not ""in the mood"" as frequently. The tricky business is defining where libido and arousal differ. Arousal can exist without attraction (that's just random libido horniness action), so attraction probably can exist without it leading to arousal?  To be perfectly honest though, you sound asexual to me."

Any real journalist wouldn't take a while to answer and definitely wouldn't fail to answer with an email to talk through. I've talked to people through reddit and every one of them that claimed to be a reporter that turned out to actually be one was happy to talk through email instead. Take, for instance, Dominique Mosbergen from HuffPost. She contacted me and a lot of others through reddit, among other sites including AVEN. I preferred to talk through email, and she got back to me within a couple of hours about it. This has happened a few times, and everyone that is being real shouldn't hesitate to talk through email, since it's easier to quote accurately if they have a copy backed up.

Aces can still become aroused and masturbate at the thought or exposure to stimuli. I sometimes find women's bra ads in magazines nice to look at; everything looks soft and dainty, but I don't think there's a sexual component. It's perfectly okay to have a 'type' of erotica/image/clothing that turns you on, though. Asexual is a lack of sexual attraction to other people, not a lack of ability to be aroused. check out the thinking asexual"

Trans means a girl wants to be a boy [which I now know is incorrect, but alas, middle school] Am I trans? thinks about it for a minute Nope.   If straight means I like boys, and gay means I like girls, then asexual means I like no one [again, incorrect, but alas, middle school] Am I ace? crush walks by Nope.

When I see a hot guy, I don't imagine myself sleeping with him, maybe just feeling his muscles or something. I have no motivation to have sex, I don't crave sex, and I don't want sex, even though yes, I'm a pervert.   It's really weird, to be honest! Asexuality is a weird thing.

Alloromantic asexuals exist (and are the majority within the Ace community) and many of them want a relationship but feel they are at a huge disadvantage because of their specific needs and boundaries.  There are dating and friendship sites specific for asexuals. Acebook and asexualic for example. OkCupid now allows you to select Asexual as an orientation, and I've met a few people via OKC, While I am a sex-willing asexual I would much prefer to never have sex within my romantic relationships.  My education, health and career are my primary focus right now so thankfully I'm not feeling the heartache of singledom just yet, But I know I am prone to feeling really low at times when I don't have anyone to connect with."

Just looking at the definition, I'm a little surprised no one's ever made this suggestion/accusation of me before...barring the fact that I have mild OCD (and thus am relatively organized), most of the other descriptors fit me to a tee.

There is always the chance there is another out there (asexual or just someone who understands it) who is just as scared to be open. Even likely there is someone who is asexual, but they don't know it. Not trying to step forward leaves this entirely to luck, and luck is not forgiving.  Does your college have any classes in psychology or sexuality? Find those students, talk to those teachers. If nothing else it's comforting to find people who understand who you are and don't judge you for it.

Women especially are taught that their sexuality (and desirability) is a source of power; if you're ace and female you may feel like you don't have access to what other women have, so looking nice gives you some of that 'sexualized' power/agency.

asexuality,2wirrn,YoungFolks,7,Fri Feb 20 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"Okay so, sex is like movies. A lot of people like movies.  They have their all-time favourite movies, movies they hated and guilty pleasure movies. When a new movie comes out that they think they'd like, they go out of their way to try and see this movie. And there are so many different types of movies: action, romance, comedy, horror etc. They cater to as many tastes as they can and there's usually something for everybody. If they find a movie they really, really like then they rewatch it over and over.  Asexuals can like movies too, they can like lots and lots of different movies. They just don't feel the need to watch them. I think asexuals would much rather read, or go for a walk, or type posts on reddit - they don't particularly want to go and spend large chunks of they're free time watching movies. Others just don't see the point in movies, they're a massive waste of money, resources and the actors starring in them get paid way too much. And some asexuals have just never bothered to see one because it's not really for them.   But seriously though, movies are cool.

Someone likes something you don't, and suddenly they're weird, you can't understand them, and it's all some big mystery. Being ace doesn't mean you literally cannot fathom the entire concept of sexual attraction, folks. Acting like the majority of people are weird or ""like animals"" is pretty rude, too."

I've never felt the need for sex myself and I've never struggled to grasp why sexuality is so pervasive, divisive, and behavior influencing. It's because we are animals, and animals get strong biological rewards for doing the things that aid survival, such as procreation. We're a lucky few who can set on the edge of that and look in, and I see people throwing rocks rather than making notes an attempting to advance things. It's kind of upsetting at times."

asexuality,2wcq4f,jadefirefly,47,Thu Feb 19 07:06:05 2015 UTC,"Hi guys. I'm not here to be rude, and I hope you guys are the same way to me. Since OP didn't link where that quote came from, I'll tell you: /r/TumblrInAction.  I am, myself, an asexual, and frankly, I agree with that quote (but I'm not the person who originally said it) and here's why: whether or not you are asexual is simply a question of are you sexually attracted to people. This question isn't a spectral question, it's a yes or no question. Sure, some people have higher sex drives than others, but that isn't what this question is asking. If the answer is yes, and you do feel sexual attraction to people, regardless of how slight that attraction is, then by definition, you are not asexual.  I do, however, acknowledge that romantic attraction is different from sexual attraction, but who you're romantically attracted to shouldn't play a role in describing your sexual tenancies.  So, yeah, that's pretty much my rational for this. Again, I'm not trying to be rude, and I hope you do the same and not get needlessly angry at me. That said, having a conversation on the matter is something I'd be fine with, it'd just be nice to not have a ton of people shout incomprehensibly at me.  EDIT: Since it seems like none of you guys are reading any of my other comments in this discussion, I'm putting this here: Exceptions do exist. I'm not saying slight attractions that break the norm of your life are what define you and that you should be cast out for them."
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,22,Thu Feb 19 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree that it's not a spectral question. The entire point of both the asexual flag and the AVEN triangle are to emphasize that it is a spectrum. Saying asexuality is not spectral question is like saying gay/straight is not a spectral question. ""Are you male and attracted to other men? If the answer is yes, and you do feel sexual attraction to men, regardless of how slight that attraction is, then, by definition, you are gay."" Obviously that is absurd. It's absurd when you apply it to asexuality too. A lifelong ace who experiences slight attraction one time in decades of living should be cast out of the community? That's beyond ridiculous."

I hope to communicate the same, and I mean no ill will at all. It's tough, though, when someone like me gets alienated with a comment like this just because I don't neatly fit into a category.  I understand sexual attraction for the most part, and I experience it to some extent. But it's such a rare, low-level, fleeting experience that it plays no role in my life whatsoever. Technically, that makes me allo, but other allo people can't even begin to understand what my experience is like. Aces understand easily, even though I'm not technically one of them.  I'm ok with the technical definition, but I'm not ok with the comment in the OP. If the question is binary, ""Do you experience sexual attraction,"" then yes. But if the question is, ""Describe your sexuality,"" then we do have a spectrum to account for."
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,11,Thu Feb 19 02:46:05 2015 UTC,"In that sense, I see where you're coming from, but I feel like if the experience is so rare that in terms of a percentage of your life it takes up it's effectively zero, then those moments play to be exceptions to the general rule of no, you don't feel sexual attraction. To repeat the example I used with Daelys, if a heterosexual tried to describe him/herself by one encounter with someone of the same gender who sexually attracted them, many people would consider it odd. That moment was merely an exception to the general rule of that person's sexuality, and trying to define themselves by the exception is counterproductive."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ihateirony,6,Thu Feb 19 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"If it's not a spectrum, but a binary, at what point does it become effectively zero? It seems like you'd have to draw a line on the spectrum to decide that."
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,6,Thu Feb 19 05:36:51 2015 UTC,"And honestly you would, but it's pretty simple to figure out where that line is. Does the person identify as any kind of asexual? If the answer is yes, then chances are sexual attraction plays a small enough role that it has become virtually zero in the context of that person's entire life, and any exceptions to this can, for the most part, but passed off as just that: exceptions."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ihateirony,3,Thu Feb 19 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. So you do think it's valid for people to identify as ""ace spectrum"" things such as grey ace or demi?"
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,1 point,Thu Feb 19 10:12:25 2015 UTC,"I... didn't I said anything of the sort. Ok, I'm going to preface this comment by saying this: it's not my place to dictate another person's choices. Any of my opinions are just that; opinions, and I don't intend to insult others with them.  That said: no, I don't think identifying on a spectrum of asexuality is valid. The point I'm trying to get across is that you shouldn't let the exceptions define you. Sure, exceptions occur, but trying to come up with a new word to describe one exception is absurd. I feel like I've used this analogy too much in this thread, but I'll use it again because I'm unoriginal: It's like a heterosexual who one time in their lives felt sexually attracted to someone of the same gender. You tell them to stop identifying as a hetero simply because of that one instance: it's just an exception and should be given no further consideration."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ihateirony,2,Fri Feb 20 01:28:55 2015 UTC,How often is an exception and how often is not an exception? Your approach doesn't lend itself well to people who fall through the cracks.
asexuality,2wcq4f,BlueCalx1,-1,Fri Feb 20 06:06:50 2015 UTC,"Okay ""technically"" they might be a little bit bi, but if they want to identify as hetero that's up to them to decide, not somebody else. Same with asexuality. If somebody wants to identify that way and feels that it describes them best, you don't get to say that it's not valid. You haven't experienced what they have."

asexuality,2wcq4f,3fox,6,Thu Feb 19 16:27:45 2015 UTC,"The ""simple answer"" means that people aren't allowed to be confused about their identity, though."
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,2,Thu Feb 19 07:15:37 2015 UTC,"Why not? I'm not saying that you need to know from the get go that you're asexual, and I'm also not saying that people who don't identify as asexual aren't more over that line than some that do. I'm just saying that if a person's sexual attractions are fleeting enough that they call themselves asexual, then chances are the rare sexual tenancies they have are merely exceptions to the general rule that they are indeed asexual."

I would prefer to be TREATED like an ace than an allo, because I simply don't experience sexual attraction or drive anywhere near the amount that regular ""straight"" guys do, so for the sake of argument, I see myself as being grey-ace. Do I, on rare instances, experience sexual attraction? Sure. Do I feel a desire to act on it? Nope. And I'd like people to understand that about me. So while technically the title of grey-ace doesn't seem like it fits me very well, it's the closest thing we've got for now and once we have a name for what I have, I'll identify as that, instead."

asexuality,2wcq4f,Leviathan666,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:35:13 2015 UTC,"It means ""to avoid further arguments"", sort of.

asexuality,2wcq4f,ATiredCliche,1 point,Sat Feb 21 09:59:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm the person who wrote the comment in the OP. I don't think that that does technically make you allo. I believe that anyone who experiences negligible sexual attraction is asexual. But that means that there is a clear line, and not a spectrum of asexuality. So, I agree with your last two sentences. I could be wrong though, and I'm down to chat it out should you like to!"
asexuality,2wcq4f,no_for_reals,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:31:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! My issue with your mode of thinking is that we now need to define ""negligible"". How much sexual attraction can someone feel before it's not negligible? Who gets to decide where that line is?  If it's not a spectrum, then it's binary, which is going to involve some tough calls--case in point, you consider me to not be allo, even though I experience sexual attraction. People are going to disagree on that point, so how do we make a formal decision? If it's a spectrum, however, there's much less to agree upon: I can be ""mostly ace"" and leave it at that."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ATiredCliche,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"Well, that's, in my opinion, the beauty of my definition: it retains agency for those who say it. Do you believe that the amount you feel attraction is negligible, insignificant, et cetera? This question- and the whole question in general- is important, I think, because nobody knows what it's like to be inside your head, and defining what exactly ""sexual attraction"" is isn't so easy for that reason. Edit: to be clear, I believe there can be a binary and a spectrum: either you're on the spectrum, or you aren't. If you want to feel like you neatly fit into a category, that's a great reason to have words like grey-ace, and stuff like that. I just object to the idea that rarely feeling sexual attraction is the same as never feeling sexual attraction. They're similar, and we will likely get along famously because of the was sex is sold in mainstream society! But they aren't the same."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ihateirony,5,Sat Feb 21 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"I know someone who identifies as asexual who experiences sexual attraction on occasion and has done so a handful of times in their life. In those terms their experience is much more similar to someone who experiences no sexual attraction. Conceptualisation of the construct as binary rather than on a spectrum would prevent them from gathering and communicating with people with extremely similar experiences to them. Should they identify as allosexual under your conceptualisation of things?  As a side note, generally Asexuality is defined as a distinct construct from sex drive. You can experience little or no sexual attraction and have a high sex drive. It's just not directed at other beings."
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,2,Thu Feb 19 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"I'll address your side note first: that's a fair point. That's not generally the way I think of sex drive, but you're definitely right about that.  About the main point: as I've reiterated to a couple people, the main distiction I think needs to made is are these sexual attractions simply rare, or are they actual exceptions to the way your friend generally acts. Cause if it's merely that it occurs rarely, then I wouldn't consider them asexual, but it those experiences are actual exceptions to their normal... behavior for lack of a better term, then yes, they are asexual.  I'm finding it difficult to put my thoughts into words :/"
asexuality,2wcq4f,ihateirony,3,Thu Feb 19 06:21:52 2015 UTC,How often is rare enough to be asexual and how rare is frequently enough to be allosexual though? It seems like you'd half to draw a line somewhere on the spectrum in order to make it a binary.
asexuality,2wcq4f,bah1238,4,Thu Feb 19 10:11:25 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but I think it just boils down to one's personal experience.  Ignoring Tumblrinas, I doubt that an allosexual would ""want"" to be asexual. At some point you simply notice that you're somehow different and start looking for answers and sometimes asexuality gives those answers."
asexuality,2wcq4f,PokemonTom09,1 point,Thu Feb 19 12:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is pretty much my stance on this as well. It's becoming a bit hard to reply to everyone here, so sorry for my late responses."
asexuality,2wcq4f,Daelys,6,Fri Feb 20 01:18:22 2015 UTC,"No needless anger here. I'd like a genuine discussion on this if you're game. I personally identify as grey-asexual because it's so incredibly rare for me to be attracted to anybody--99% of the time, I am, by definition, asexual. Until I get ""activated,"" for lack of a better term. For these reasons, I consider myself part of the asexual community and I've found solidarity and reassurance from that quarter in great numbers. But it seems like, for you, that 1% of the time would automatically make me allosexual?   Your definitions seem a bit too strict for the reality that is human sexuality, is all. Very few people are 100% anything; as I understand it, most sexuality falls on a bell curve model. I'd be interested in your thoughts."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ExtraWingyScapula,11,Thu Feb 19 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Doing something rarely is not the same as doing it never, TBH. You are exceptionally discerning in your tastes. However, you feel sexual desire and act on it when possible. That's why I think demisexual should also not be ace. You just need connection. Why is needing connection a sign of lack of sexuality?"
asexuality,2wcq4f,sharkcore,8,Thu Feb 19 03:40:51 2015 UTC,"Just throwing a perspective out there - I've felt sexual attraction to one person. One person out of every human I've ever seen, who happens to be my SO. I didn't feel any of that attraction for the first 18 months we dated, and I don't feel it consistently at all. I guess that would qualify me for demi, although I prefer to just identify as ace.   Anyway, it's not like suddenly you're attracted to a person and think ""Everything's fixed I guess I'm straight now!"" Still sex reluctant? Yep. Could live without it? Easily. Feel broken on occasion? Still. (Not that these things make one asexual, but they are common experiences.)   One person out of everyone I've ever seen or met in my life?? That's an exception. Now let's say most people who ID as demi are attracted to more people than just one - what's 3, 5, 8 people out of all the people they've seen?  (I have no clue the amount of people your average allo finds hot but judging by today's advertisements, porn, what have you, it's gotta be like.... more than 10 that's for sure.)  If a lesbian thought a dude was hot once, you're not going to insist that she ID as bi. That would be silly."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ExtraWingyScapula,-7,Thu Feb 19 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"If a lesbian had sex in the past with a man and realized she wanted ladies only, and did ladies only, she would be a lesbian, just like an asexual who had sex in the past and didn't enjoy it can still be asexual.  A lesbian who is currently having sex with a man and enjoying it lots and lots...isn't lesbian. She's bisexual or fluid or pansexual or whatever. And if you are a person who is sexually attracted to another person, you no longer fit the technical definition of asexual."
asexuality,2wcq4f,Daelys,5,Thu Feb 19 05:42:01 2015 UTC,"I guess this is the point where I ask my other question, which I've always been curious about (as I've seen people with your opinion in the community before). Why do you feel the need to be the ""identity police"" and stop people in the grey-area, like myself (who even self identify as 'grey-ace,' so are obviously aware we don't fit the strictest definition of the word) from identifying under the asexual umbrella? Does it harm you somehow? Does it harm the community? What's the gain for you here, if any?"
asexuality,2wcq4f,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Thu Feb 19 13:44:40 2015 UTC,"Various things. I'm not threatened, but I am a scientist, which means I like labels and demarcations. When someone makes a definition, I expect things in that category to resemble each other and the definition. The definition of asexual seems to be someone who does not experience sexual attraction. There are a category of people who do experience sexual attraction, yet are ace. Then what's the point of having a definition at all if pretty much anything can fit into it. Why aren't you all just ""really infrequent sexuals,"" where infrequent is limit=0, instead of asexuals?  Second, I think identity for sexual minorities can be a very powerful thing. The labels we choose for ourselves say much about our values and give us solidarity, for lack of a better term, with others who are like us. I think gray-as and demisexuals take on the mantle of asexuality so they have people to sympathize with and a community with whom to commiserate, even if they don't quite fit. They want a community. There's nothing special or interesting about not having lots of sex or being very picky. There is, however, something special and interesting about being asexual. You get a board! You get a ring! You get special nicknames! Annnddd you get to walk all over the actual asexuals who now feel self-conscious that they're being shut out of their own community by sexual people. Again.  If labels are truly that flexible, then I can call all of you sexual and none of you can argue."
asexuality,2wcq4f,Daelys,4,Thu Feb 19 22:25:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with wanting to neatly categorize every single person's orientation is that, being humans and having wibbly-wobbly sexual inclinations as we tend to do, there are always people who don't strictly fit one definition or the other. I'm reminded of the problem the bisexual community is known for, where people want them to either be straight or gay when they are really both and neither at the same time.   Grey-asexuality is a grey area in between allosexuals and asexuals--hence the moniker--and for the most part, I don't see aces taking offense to grey-aces including themselves in the umbrella. I find it pretty ludicrous that you think the entirety of the grey-ace and demi community has come together purely for the sake of finding a ""special"" name for themselves, or to seem more ""interesting."" Without reservation, every single member of the demi/grey-ace community that I have spoken to has the same story. When they read about asexuality, or demisexuality, they felt an overwhelming sense of relief, a feeling that they were not 'broken'. That's about the same story that most full-on aces have. I don't give a crap about having a 'special nickname' for my orientation. But labels are very powerful tools for helping you understand your identity, and that's exactly what the grey-ace community has done for me.   If any asexuals feel somehow shut out or walked over because I found a home within their group....I'm not sure how or why. I'm not excluding anyone or taking any rights/information/attention away from anyone. So I'm not really sure where that part of your argument came from. You seem to have some serious misconceptions about how grey-asexuality works in the first place if you think it has something to do with just being ""picky"" or ""not having lots of sex"".   Labels are flexible, with one caveat. The person in question is the one with the power to choose what label they believe fits their orientation the best. Sexual orientation is genetic, for sure. But a given label won't fit everyone equally. Who cares if some guy who's had a fling or two with his own gender chooses to identify as straight? It's his identity. Labels are inherently flawed as there are literally too great a variation of sexual identities out there for there to be an exact word that describes each of them.

Sure, on one hand, it's nice to be able to have an exact term for what you're like but on the other hand it has created a large number of ""sub-genres"" of orientations with people bickering over the descriptions and whether someone belongs to this ""orientation"" or  the other almost identical to the first. Sexuality is a spectrum. Asexuality is a spectrum. If you've felt sexual attraction to very few people in you life and aren't like 12 years old, then I understand why you'd call yourself asexual. Welcome to the club.  I've also noticed this sense of entitlement that some people have just because the are an exact fit to a sexual orientation's description. As if people are somehow accountable to them."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ATiredCliche,2,Thu Feb 19 12:06:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm the elitist asshole you're talking about. I don't think being an asexual makes you an elite. The exact opposite, I often wish I could feel sexual attraction, to speak nothing of how I felt when I was younger. However, I don't think asexuality is a spectrum. Where have I gone wrong? Clarification of my quote, which was posted without context: Demisexuality and gray-asexuality are valid ways to be/feel and it's valid to talk about them. I'm also cool if you wanna put them under the ""asexual umbrella."" But I disagree with the idea that the line is blurry, or that asexuality itself is a spectrum. People who tell me it is sometimes bug me. that's all."
asexuality,2wcq4f,sharkcore,0,Sat Feb 21 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"The context definitely helps for sure, haha. The term ""actual asexual"" raised a red flag for me and I assumed the worst.   It's very easy to say ""the line is if you've ever felt sexual attraction you are NOT asexual"". Which agrees with most definitions of asexuality, sure. But if you realize that demigrey people exist, and that their orientations are close-but-not-quite asexual, then it's very hard to deny the existence of a spectrum? If there's allosexual people, and asexual people, and people who feel varying degrees of sexual attraction in the middle.... then it's a spectrum.   ""Okay, so if demigrey people are in the middle.... then they aren't asexual.""   This makes sense on the surface, but do you really think that people who ID as demi or grey are in the middle? Let's say we have a guy named allo Joe and he finds an average of 5 people a day to be hot. Cool cool. And then we have allo Pablo and he finds 1 person a day to be exceptionally fuckable. Is Pablo going to question his identity? Helll no! Maybe allo Alice goes ""oh hot damn"" once a week over an attractive person. Alice is most likely not going to question it either. Okay, so then there's demi Damien. Who might've realized his friend was hot after 3 years of hanging out. Who maybe spent years wondering what was wrong with him before that, and might spend years after the fact wondering why he hasn't felt it since. (Because all of the media is telling him that he should be feeling something during those Victoria's Secret commercials.) Grey Georgia thought people were hot in high school but hasn't liked a single person since, her doctor tells her that she's healthy, but nobody's pleased her since she was 17 and she's starting to worry she'll die alone. Greg sees a hot boy once a month but doesn't act on it, because he had a habit of entering relationships and losing all interest the next week. Grace doesn't think she's felt sexual attraction before - but with a blurry definition, who knows! She chooses the grey ace label because it feels safer just in case something happens.   I think to get the familiar feeling that something's amiss - you have to be pretty damn close to the ace side of the sexuality gradient. Close enough that while it IS a spectrum, and you are a little off to the side, you are similar enough that it really doesn't matter. Like you've said, not very many of us WANT to be asexual. But y'know, since we are, it's nice to have a community and it's silly to pretend that demigrey people are some sort of ""other"" orientation. As far as I'm concerned if they want to use ""asexual"" and nothing more to describe themselves they can go right ahead.   tl;dr: logic clearly favours the idea of a spectrum and people in the true middle of the spectrum aren't going to ID as demigrey. We get the essentially ace ones and they belong."

In it, Nagel argues that materialist theories of mind omit the essential component of consciousness, namely that there is something that it is (or feels) like to be a particular conscious thing.  An organism has conscious mental states, he argues, ""if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism.""  Nagel's example has been called ""The most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness"".  :441     Interesting: Batá drum | Bath, Somerset | Bata Shoes | Samuel Johnson   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

But asexuals are on it like black is on the color spectrum. Which is to say, we aren't. That's the point. I cannot identify or understand what it is to be sexually attracted to somebody. All the politics come after. I'd say it weakens my experience to say ""oh, asexuals are anyone who don't feel sexual attraction as much as, um... an idealized sexual person? who experiences sexual attraction the normal amount, whatever that is? anyway if it's anything less than that unquantifiable experience it is asexuality. or if you don't identify with sexual norms presented by your culture that works too."" honestly I think that does more to erase the existence of a spectrum by trying to say there is a cubbyhole that sexuals fit into."

I'm also in in a relationship with an asexual. He never makes me angry. Nor do my asexual friends. I don't hate gay people. I don't hate trans people.  sometimes, however, I get a little bit bugged by people who tell me that asexuality is a spectrum, and people who often feel sexual attraction are also asexuals. I think that is silly. anyway. Not angry."
asexuality,2wcq4f,graphictruth,-1,Sat Feb 21 01:49:58 2015 UTC,because it's not about them. By definition.
asexuality,2wcq4f,ATiredCliche,2,Sat Feb 21 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"I'm the person in the OP quote. I agree. I'm asexual, and when people try to make asexuality about people who do experience sexual attraction a non-negligible part of the time, I do get a bit bugged. I think that's kinda valid."
asexuality,2wcq4f,graphictruth,0,Sat Feb 21 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a distinction that makes a difference. But there are clearly shades. I do think it is a spectrum thing. I'll go with the ""non-negligible"" as a useful spectral line, though.   There's also the question of what is meant by ""sexual attraction."" I can't really know what other people mean by that, I just know that sometimes they get goofy and do dumb things.   And sometimes, I look at someone, find them pleasing and on occasion, would love to see them naked. I don't dislike sex, but much prefer skin. Given the choice between sex and a sandwich - I will usually take the sandwich. But I'm a little ambivalent as to where I fit in it all.   I'd say that if someone were wanting to understand me, in relationship to them - Ace would probably be a good rule of thumb."
asexuality,2wcq4f,ATiredCliche,2,Sat Feb 21 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"And that's absolutely fair. The hard part about all this is that people who don't or can't experience sexual attraction can't really define what it is to experience sexual attraction. (Relevant: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_it_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F) If you say it's a negligible amount, I'll trust you. I'll trust anybody. And BTW, though the OP might lead you to believe otherwise, I have never, nor will I ever, flip my shit over this. I get bugged sometimes. But that's it. It's not worth burning bridges over."

Even someone who is destitute of sexual experience knows if they've found people sexually stirring before. Your bit about some beautiful girl you went out with being attractive to you only in personality had me laughing a bit; it's so relatable — I'm a great admirer of personalities and simply good-looking faces. Sex is no part of that equation. It might not be a part of yours either.  Asexuals can still want a person romantically, or admire them aesthetically. It just differentiates people who don't want sex. Romantic and sexual attractions don't have to be aligning.  Despite these labels, remember that you are the one who controls the adhesive. If your experiences don't line up with asexuality, feel free to rip the label off and stick on a new one (or remain nude, even). Words are merely abstractions designed to explain human ideas, thoughts, and experiences. Use them as you wish."

Asexuality might have its upsides but it's got a hell of a lot of perplexing and vexing downsides which I don't think you consider when you make some ignorant pining to ""become asexual."" Life is not easier or simpler for asexuals. In some cases it can grow more complicated. Your line of thinking is quite churlish and uninformed.  If you have a plaguing aversion to sex or don't feel well when you're sexual, that is something you should take up with a psychologist or someone qualified to assess those sorts of things — but you never try to think another sexuality has it better.

Hope this helped somewhat. <3  EDIT: My ftm transgender brother had come out as lesbian years ago, but came out as transgender this Christmas, so I also felt a bit inhibited from letting anyone know I was ace, because I also, like you, didn't want to be seen as 'trying to get attention' for that.  I did come out to my father a few months ago, and he started 'bingo-ing' me until I asked if he had done that to 'J' when he came out as lesbian way back when. That stopped the 'bingo-ing' in its tracks, so there is that to consider - if your folks took your sibling's coming out pretty well, then you can call them on it if they give you a difficult time about it.  <3"

Tragically, that is fair — sexual people have every right to want their partners to be sexually attracted to them. I could never be angry at a person because they don't want to continue a relationship after they know I can never be absolutely stirred for them with the genitalia. Once a legitimate relationship occurs in my life, I'll likely be less interested because I'd be aware of what it is like. But for now, that mystery is one that tugs my heart with irritation, and asexuality doesn't help the cause of occurrence and discovery.  My feelings are accepted by now.

I am extremely unlikely to ever have a significant other for one, as I am not going out there looking for someone.  Attached to that is the idea that I will never have kids. I love them to death, and have to spend my time doting on my nieces and nephews instead. That is the hardest part for me personally. I can deal with it but I still find it that it really sucks."

Complete denial, you could say. Pretty soon after I realized something was different with me but pushed the possibility to the back of my mind. I was hopeful that if I just had enough sex with different people, it would somehow fix me. Maybe I'd find this particular kind of person that I'd be able to feel ""normally"" about. Unsurprisingly, it didn't work out very well.  So after about three years filled with shame and regret, and some inquiries made by my friends about me maybe being asexual. I finally just gave in, took my laptop, and fucking googled it. Short answer to your question is yes.  Long answer: Everything sort of fell into its place but I was also sad and a bit angry at my brain for being wired so differently. It felt unfair. I still often feel left out and am scared that I'll end up alone.  However, it's nice to know you're not alone and that there's a community of people in a similar situation.

I've always experienced aesthetic attraction, so a particular body part might look appealing to me, without sexual attraction, so I ""get it"" to a degree. Advertising today seems to be selling the promise of sex though, rather than the actual product described, by dressing it up with attractive scantily clad people. I do find this ridiculous, but that's not just an ace thing. As for being reminded of animals - humans are animals too, and frankly some things we do seem a bit odd/gross  so they make it seem like more, by changing the way we look at it. That's the whole thing about lingerie, if naked women were so attractive, we wouldn't have a whole industry devoted to covering up those sexualized parts with fancy frilly fabrics. Seems like lingerie does add something to an otherwise very basic act/attraction."

All the Playboy posters in my dad's garage, all the accidental porn I've come across on the internet, all the times I realized I was the only guy in class who didn't gawk at my health teachers butt.  Sure, peoples bodies are interesting. Some are obviously more aesthetically attractive than others, but I really don't understand what is so fucking mesmerizing about any of it!   That's why its the invisible orientation. It's the lack of sexuality. Hence why it is so impossible to understand from an allosexual perspective.   Sexuality is weird, yo."

Some experience arousal, some don't. And so on. The only ""true"" defining aspect of asexuality is not experiencing sexual attraction to other people, but exceptions to that ""rule"" are why we have things like gray-asexuality and demisexuality. Some asexuals enjoy sex, too. None of what you described about yourself or him is at all odd for asexual people.  Also boners don't necessarily indicate arousal or attraction. They're just responses the body creates when it thinks sex is going to happen. Not even that, always, hence morning wood."

asexuality,2w69dy,DefyGravity42,4,Wed Feb 18 00:33:15 2015 UTC,"In general, asexual men can and do get erections.  It would not be uncommon to get one while cuddling.  It's usually just the body's way of saying ""Oh, hey, something's happening, better get ready"", even if there's no particular desire or willingness to do anything with it.  Physical arousal does not require attraction to be driving it.  As for the grinding, I can't say for certain what his intentions or reasons for doing it are, but I can say that pressing an erection against something is often somewhat pleasant.  At the same time, an erection tends to get in the way and require adjustment.  So maybe he's shifting to get more comfortable or maybe he's doing it because it feels good.  If I had to guess, it's because he's getting something out of it, but if you want to know what's running through his mind, you'll have to ask him.  As far as masturbation goes, that would be an individual preference.  I do, but not every ace guy does.  There's no requirement to do so, nor is there any kind of biological imperative to do so, despite what some people claim."

I identified as asexual for a couple of years and I still think I'm somewhere on the spectrum but I seem to be getting more and more sexual these days as the dysphoria lessens. I think it's quite difficult for us to have positive sex experiences because of how we feel about our bodies and that can lead to a disinterest in sex which is pretty indistinguishable from asexuality. However, I have since found a guy who sees me for me and to be perfectly honest, I want him to do naughty things to me! Still a scared virgin who can't picture sex without triggering dysphoria but definitely can't call myself ace anymore without co-opting the term.  Not that you can't truly be ace, of course.

asexuality,2w5lfv,alexsc12,2,Tue Feb 17 04:13:51 2015 UTC,"Hi! :D  Yeah, I can definitely relate to that. I mean, I'm not a virgin; I've had one romantic and sexual partner, but I was never really all that into the sex. The sensation was nice, but masturbation was always better, and I can count the number of times I've felt seriously aroused on one hand. I mostly liked the feeling of physical and emotional closeness and making her feel good, and while I wasn't aware of any trans feelings at the time, I really did not like being expected to be the masculine, dominant one.  So, my past sexual experiences, while not horrible, were pretty lackluster. Though I feel way worse about my body now than I did at the time, and the idea of someone wanting to be sexual with me as a guy is pretty sickening. So, yeah, it's hard to tell if that will change as I transition and start to be seen as female by myself and others.

Not being sexually attracted to people is what makes an ace ace. Many aces desire sex/masterbate/fantasize/enjoy porn, but just don't have that ""I want to have sex with that person"" that most allos seem to have all the time. That said nobody knows your sexuality better than you. If you feel like you've never felt sexual attraction to another you are probably asexual."

I know plenty of aces fantasize and enjoy porn and it's the sexual attraction to other people that makes you ace, so... I'm not really sure what I was thinking! When you put it that way it seems pretty clear, haha. I guess it was mostly trans stuffs getting in the way and muddling things up a bit, as they tend to."
asexuality,2w5lfv,fannarrativeftw,2,Tue Feb 17 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds like asexuality to me; regardless of your transition (congrats on that, btw). It's the imagining the feeling of the sex acts, plus, in your case, wishing to look more like the woman in the porn. Authochorissexualism is the paraphilia not uncommon among aces, which is the experience of arousal from sexual stimuli such as porn, without actually desiring to participate in sex acts (not inserting yourself personally into the fantasy). Sounds to me like you're experiencing that. I suspect wanting to be her (in the video) is more about anatomy than sexual attraction.  I have to mention a lesbian friend of mine, because she thought she might be ace. She could see guys as cute/attractive, maybe even ""hot"" but wasn't actually interested in sex with them. She realized that she sort of wanted to look a bit like them, and that she was sexually attracted to women. You seem to be in a similar place, but the reverse - does wanting to be the woman in the erotica make you less ace? Nope. Not in my opinion anyway, it's just a cooccurrence of autochorissexualism and body envy. Best of luck with your transition and identity-searching!"

Most asexuals would consider themselves separate from celibates in the fact most don't choose to become asexual, although the behavior may be result of a change that has occurred over the person's life. Asexuals also tend to go with the LGBQT umbrella of sexuality being biological in nature rather than a conscious decision. It's been a debate with dangerous implications for that group, so you might want to tread a little lightly.   Doesn't mean you can't call yourself Asexual. Or Celibate.

You look at a tasty piece of food and you cannot control the fact that some part of your brain is already thinking, ""Hmmm, I would like to eat that.""  You look at somebody attractive and you cannot control the fact that some part of your brain is already thinking, ""Hmmm, I would probably enjoy having sex with him/her.""  You see somebody with a particular smile or way about them and sometimes you cannot control the fact that some part of your brain reacts by thinking, ""Hmmmm, I wonder would it would be like to be their friend.""  In this way hunger, sexual attraction, and platonic attraction are kind of related.  Short of that, however, hunger and sexual attraction don't really have much else in common. That's my opinion anyways.    Being asexual just means that while your brain may still react to hunger or platonic attraction, it does not do so for sexual attraction."
asexuality,2w2d0p,davros_mueller,7,Tue Feb 17 01:24:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the vast majority of asexuals on here about what the definition of asexuality is. Most people here define it as not experiencing sexual attraction.  My own preferred definition is not experiencing sexual motivation. I don't even know what sexual attraction is. Maybe I have it? I don't know. (There's a thread people link all the time that describes sexual attraction, but I've read through it and am still as confused as ever.)  But I don't make my decisions or plan my life around sex. It's generally just a non-issue. So I identify as asexual.  If someone like you describe in this question wants to identify as asexual, I don't think anyone can tell them they shouldn't. They've decided that the word applies to them, but that doesn't mean you're not allowed to decide it applies to you as well."
asexuality,2w2d0p,narrativedilettante,12,Mon Feb 16 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"The problem with defining sexuality by motivation is it doesn't work for every sexuality. A bisexual person in a monogamous relationship might not feel 'motivation' towards anyone but their partner, but that doesn't mean they're not attracted to people other than their partner, and certainly doesn't make them straight or gay.  Setting just asexuality apart with this definition is a bit off, too. 'All of these sexualities are defined by who people are/aren't sexually attracted to, but this one and only this one is defined by sexual motivation.' Makes asexuality look like not a real sexuality, because it doesn't fit the pattern of known sexualities."
asexuality,2w2d0p,davros_mueller,2,Mon Feb 16 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe typical definitions of other sexualities could use some redefinition, too.  I'm not really attached to my own definition of asexuality, but I do have trouble with the standard definition and think it's unnecessarily exclusionary."
asexuality,2w2d0p,narrativedilettante,3,Mon Feb 16 16:03:24 2015 UTC,"How would you define the other sexualities, ideally so they all match, and are all inclusive?  Keeping in mind my earlier example of a monogamous bi person, and not redefining them as straight or gay."
asexuality,2w2d0p,davros_mueller,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't know. Perhaps something to do with potential sexual motivation, or historical sexual motivation.  I think maybe I'd prefer not to define orientations, and to allow everyone to develop their own definitions for how they self-identify. The one problem that seems to cause is people trying to find a label and looking for concrete definitions so they can match something to themselves.  This is an issue that requires more thought than I have time to give it at the moment, but I'll keep mulling it over and see if I come up with anything."
asexuality,2w1hiu,tiktakti,2,Mon Feb 16 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"Hello there. I wonder why nobody has commented here yet. I am on this subreddit today first of all, because I figured out I might be asexual. In fact, I am pretty sure I am. So I just wanted to tell you that you're really not alone. I have been suffering depression and anxiety for 5 years now. I also think I have some gender identity issues. Or I know I have, but I'm not completely sure what I am. But thing is, I understand you very well and I am very similar to what you describe. I haven't had sex yet at the age of 19. I never wanted to. I find the thought about sexual activity stressing and really no fun. I am very romantic tho, I love romantic actions, just not too intimidate and sexual, you know. So if you ever want someone to talk to about stuff like this, or just generally, I would gladly. I am quite anti social too so don't expect too much or quick replies always. Hope you're fine and I'm sorry it's taken me 4 days since you posted this until I saw it. But 4 days ago I didn't question my sexuality, I questioned my gender. I thought I was pansexual, but I have realized I was wrong. Okay enough now, I gotta shut up, I gotta get i bed as it's past 6am here and I'm still up. Hope to hear from you, great person. And... hi!! Have a great day/night/whatever it is."
asexuality,2w1hiu,DisReekris,2,Fri Feb 20 05:36:37 2015 UTC,"(As I posted to the OP) you might like ace-book.net. And maybe do some more research on asexuality.org and the thinking asexual (it's a wordpress blog, you can google). And just so you know, (according to Anthony F. Bogaert's book ""Understanding Asexuality"") something like 14% of aces aren't cis (I doubt I am) so gender questions aren't completely out of the norm in ace spaces. [I think trans people are 3-4% of the general population, so they're much more common among asexuals. And by trans I mean not cis, so including nb, fluid, demi, genderflux, agender... I think that's what the reaseach ought to have included too)."
asexuality,2w1hiu,fannarrativeftw,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Wow. It's nice to know it's not uncommon with gender identity issues in the ace community, I don't feel as much as an outsider as I did. Also the fact that there is an asexual community itself so so awesome, it's like I've finally found my place.  Also I understand why asexuality and gender identity issues are kind of connected. My ex, who I was with for 5 months (first relationship) told me that the reason they never even tried to do aything sexual to me was because they weren't comfortable with their male body. They told me like 3 months into the relationship that they think they're trans. (I'm using they because I am still a bit unsure about what they prefer, I should ask them more speficially about that.). I believe that maybe, no matter how much I don't like the thought of being intimidate with anyone, it would be easier if I had a male body which is what I wish I had."
asexuality,2w1hiu,DisReekris,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"It's great that you're figuring out your (possibly trans) gender identity, but keep in mind that there are male aces, so it won't necessarily be ""easier"" even if you were to go through top and bottom surgery. I tend to think of myself as alternating between female and agender (genderflux) but I have zero dysphoria. I mean, I fucking love my body: it metabolizes, and heals when I'm patient, it has senses that tell me about the world around me, it breathes and pumps blood without being asked, and by the dominant white western beauty standards I've been considered pretty. I can stand naked before a mirror and say ""yeah, I've got no problems with you, I like your colour palate, actually"" but I've never really seen it as sexual. Sure, I can look ""sexy"" wearing a slightly clingy lower-than-my-usual cut top, but I'm still asexual. Because I'm not sexually attracted to others. If not having a male body is holding you back from initiating or imagining sexual acts, then yeah, those things are connected, but you might be trans and ace, without there necessitating a link.

I used to feel bad about it, and honestly all I wanted was to have sex, so people would stop asking my why I haven't had sex. It used to weigh on me a lot, especially when I would go lower and feel depressive. It feels amazing to not have to worry about it anymore, or at least not feel so bad about how I don't want to have sex. I don't know how to talk about it with others. Last night my friends were talking about how many people they had sex with, and all I could think was, 'How are they going to understand that does not at all interest me?' Anyway, at least I am excited to face these dilemmas, instead of having them make me feel bad about myself!"
asexuality,2w1hiu,DisReekris,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:16:36 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. Your friends talk about such around you? Hm, that's a new one to me. I secretly believe most of my friends must be asexual. Most of them didn't even mention sex to me and I can't even imagine them doing it either. One of them are also questioning gender, or more like she said to me she's gonna be a guy when she gets older (she's soon 18). Out of all my friends, I think only one actually talked to me about her sexual life (and I was a bit surprised because she's quite a special snowflake)."
asexuality,2w1hiu,fannarrativeftw,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"I have friends who are the same way, they are uninterested in talking about sex. Before I told my support group, I told one friend like that and she completely understood. She was reluctant to actually say asexual, but I could tell she felt the way I did and was relieved to find someone like her. I have friends who talk about how much sex they have as well. Sometimes it sucks not being able to relate when they start talking about sex. For example, once my friend felt horribly embarrassed because a night with a guy had gone awry, and all I wanted to do was tell her about a super embarrassing sex time I had (of which I have none). I wanted her to laugh and understand it happens to everyone. I went with a story about me trying to court a cute waiter (have him accept my drunken hand in marriage), no sex involved, but she understood the sentiment. When it becomes a competition about who had the most sex, that's when I become less interested in the conversation."
asexuality,2w1hiu,fannarrativeftw,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's outrageous how obsessed we are with losing our virginities these days. It seems the history of women as property (more highly valued as virgins) is a main cause, but the sexual revolution also made it seem like a big deal; as if once you lose your virginity you've determined how you'll be valued and rejected those old expectations. Now virgins are left feeling juvenile (because adults all have sex, right? [this goes for expectations of masculinity, too]) and socially isolated from peers. I'm not trying to be morally superior or more ""pure"" by not having sex!  I had a friend tell me about her experience trying to lose her virginity (which she desperately wanted to do as a first-year at university) because she felt like she was missing out since none of her friends were virgins. I told her I am, and she said ""I KNOW! Why didn't I know you then!""  When I finally accepted my aceness, and let go of my self-imposed expectation that I should have sex, I was euphoric. Like the sky opened above me and I was free of societal pressures to have sex: I just didn't have to anymore. I guess asexuality helped me validate my virginity, which seems oddly backward: I'm a virgin because I've never been sexually attracted to people, not okay with virginity because of aceness."
asexuality,2w0o0u,VanMerwan,22,Sun Feb 15 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're going to find much advice for ""how to not be sexually attractive to other people"" on this sub. The people here don't exactly go out of their way to be unattractive, and I'm sure many here don't have a solid idea of what makes a person sexually attractive in the first place.  Short of dressing like a slob and not keeping yourself clean, there isn't anything you can do to change other people's perception of you. If sexually-oriented people find you attractive, you can't change the way they think. All you can do is dissuade them if they start acting on their attraction to you if you aren't interested."
asexuality,2w0o0u,NinjaShira,4,Mon Feb 16 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"That's true, but there are also things known as dealbreakers. If you have a quality which most people find unappealing, without compromising on dress sense and hygiene, that might be the best bet.  I found that being fairly non responsive when interacting with people meant I'd be left alone most of the time. Mainly it was stuff like no body language, monotone voice and little eye contact. Things that are dealbreakers for me now with people I'm interested in are usually more permanent, like nose rings and bad accents, so that's a poor recommendation, but it does make me completely uninterested."
asexuality,2w0o0u,wineblood,4,Mon Feb 16 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"Without going out of your way to be (almost literally) repulsive, you can't stop someone from being attracted to you.   What you can do is remember that people all over the world, all the time, are being found attractive by folks that aren't their type. There are gay men being hit on by straight women. There are lesbians hitting on asexuals. It's all over the place. Pretty much everyone is going to be flirted with by someone who isn't their type at least once in their lives. And everyone handles it differently, but there's usually no going wrong with being able to politely, but firmly, indicate disinterest.   You can't control the actions of others. You can control your own perception of them, and how you react."

asexuality,2w0o0u,jadefirefly,5,Mon Feb 16 06:35:56 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned with the fact that you want to change yourself. You shouldn't need to change how you are or how you look to achieve your results.   Be who you are and learn to say no and communicate that you're not interested. If you're an attractive person no amount of slob-ness is going to put people off. If people are drawn to you then they will be drawn to you.   Developing the communication skills like that will help you with general intrapersonal skills that will benefit you in the future.   I've always looked way younger than I am and I've learned to deal with attention. :)

There are many reasons why someone A) would prefer to avoid direct confrontation and B) not want people having that sort of interest in them.  OP is simply requesting tips on low-key ways to avoid people developing that kind of interest in them in the first place.  Nothing to do with trying to ""change who you are"" or trying to ""scare people away"".  So many examples in nature of critters developing natural camoflage to avoid attracting a predator's interest.

asexuality,2w0o0u,geekerjoy1,3,Mon Feb 16 01:19:17 2015 UTC,"to answer your question, i would try wearing larger, dull clothes, almost like you're hiding in them.   but i would also recommend getting some help for your social anxiety! these people mean you well, they just don't understand you don't interact like them, nor do you want do.   once you get a little more socialized, it gets easier to brush off the attention. being asexual is no reason to be asocial as well, unless of course you don't want any social interaction at all."

I like to look good, fashion wise, so I couldn't dress horribly, plus I like to be clean. So, I dyed my hair pink. I live in a rather conservative area, I figured that dying my hair pink would finally get men off my back, plus it helps me express my identity as a gender queer person in a bizarre way. Well, instead, I kept getting messages from random people saying, ""Hey! I saw you walking by this or that place, and you look great!"" So, still no help. I think the best thing you can do is establish boundaries and make them clear."
asexuality,2w0o0u,robbysaur,3,Mon Feb 16 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"So, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you were told by someone that they or another person is attracted to you...and this really freaked you out, and got you thinking that even more people could be looking at you like that, which REALLY freaks you out... Is that accurate?  If it is, I think I know how you feel. I don't have strong social anxiety, but the thought of people really looking at me and thinking about me makes me want to throw up. It's like a brief and mild panic attack.  To avoid that feeling, I avoid drawing attention to myself. I wear nondescript, loose fitting clothing (I favor brown and dark green), i don't do anything crazy with my hair, and I don't have any interesting piercings. I'm very lucky in that I'm average looking....  Over the years, my anxiety over being looked at has eased. I think I'm in a mindset that no one besides my SO finds me attractive, so I feel pretty comfortable most of the time.   But it must be very difficult to feel comfortable if you know that someone is attracted to you! My only recommendations would be, be nondescript, work on your social anxiety in general, and maybe get a ""significant other"". Doesn't have to be real, could be a fake long distance relationship, but it'd help you shut people down real quick.   Very sorry for rambling, I hope you did get some help from this thread!

asexuality,2w0o0u,baethan,2,Mon Feb 16 01:15:23 2015 UTC,"Publicly picking one's nose is considered a turn-off.  Scratch your head gently, nonchalantly act as though you've picked something off your scalp and inspect it. Perhaps sniff it or lick it or pick it out of your fingernails, then go back to scratching.  You can also gently scratch the sides of your crotch, or your armpits.  This way you can still dress neatly and keep yourself clean and avoid chewing raw onions, but still come off as quite repellant.  Or you can ask people which product they'd recommend for yeast infections.  Hope this helps.    I hated it when people would indicate they 'liked' me like that. Made me so damn uncomfortable, I'd start babbling whatever came into my head. Like about my rock collection or cheese or something.  Sometimes even 'I'm sure you're a nice person but I'm not open to establishing new friendships or relationships right now."" just made them more persistant.  Sometimes that would work though.

asexuality,2vobc7,BlueCalx1,21,Thu Feb 12 18:17:06 2015 UTC,"Here's another way in which you're normal. MANY MANY MANY allosexuals think they are broken as well.  Do some quick goggling and you'll see people who complain that their libido is too high, or too low. Men are getting testosterone tests by the dozens because even though they're gay or straight, they feel they aren't getting aroused the same way other people are (They fall in love too easily; they don't fall in love; they have crushes but only with people who don't like them back). Women are have the same doubts and concerns as well.   They too think that they're broken. You really aren't alone in this. Being asexual doesn't make you special in this regard.   If, by some miracle, you woke up tomorrow and started a life of being sexually attracted to people, there is every chance you might still feel this way.  Try not to blame your sexual orientation. You can't fix it and it's going to make you feel hopeless.  Sexuality is a deep and complex thing. We live in a culture so obsessed with it that just about nobody feels like they meet any kind of norm. Even worse, what's normal is a moving target so it might not even be possible to hit.  Try to accept yourself. Try, if at all possible, to school yourself into thinking that it's okay not to be normal.   ""I'm not normal and that's a-okay.""  We all beat ourselves up over something. Over how we look, how we feel, how we act, how we're liked, the list goes on.  This is your thing for now. The future is scary. We all wonder if we might regret what we do or how we feel today, but in the end we don't let it consume us.  In the end we do end up living with our choices. Talk to older friends. Talk to your parents, parents of your friends, friends of your parents... they'll all admit that even though they might have done a few things differently in their youth, things did work out in the end.  They will work out for your too! Believe!"

In terms of being weird, I'm already pretty weird to begin with and have very much embraced that it's fine to not follow a standard, but for whatever reason this aspect of the weirdness is very tough for me to embrace. I'll keep working on it, and try to get some more time and experience under my belt and see where I go from there. All the best."
asexuality,2vobc7,geekerjoy1,3,Thu Feb 12 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it is only characters in movies, books and tv that feel comfortable with themselves. They are nice stories we are told to sell the illusion that 'normal' people feel comfy relating to others, having sex (a metric fuck-ton of sex sorry for the pun, couldn't resist) talking to others, saying witty things and living in homes that are so neat and having tons of time to not only work full-time or go to school, but have these incredibly activity-filled leisure hours as well.  Just scheduling alone, I can't even manage a fraction of that and I'm exhausted. I feel perpetually awkward around others, even my own family, and forget being witty. More like 'open mouth, insert foot'.  And the actual practice of sex and even kissing is awkward, icky (really really ickly), uncomfortable, uninteresting (yawn) and actually a bit ouchy because I'm totally not into it whenever I've tried it.  I get crushes on celebrities, characters, but more imagine cuddling and hugging, nothing racy.  Fiction sometimes arouses, but I mostly like it best when they're cuddling. Or piloting starships. Or staring longingly into each others' eyes because they're too emotionally constipated to 'nut up' and confess their feelings. And coffee shops. I like the coffee shop AU's in fanfiction.  But enough about my kinky, perverted tastes in reading material ;D  You ARE normal. Just as normal as every other person on the planet.  If a person looks comfortable and put together, I'd bet that 85% of the time they're lying or faking it. The other 15% they probably have some really great self-acceptance going on there.  We all feel weird about ourselves, sexuality or not, because we are all expecting ourselves and others to live up to some impossible fictional standard.  Everything you see in the media is there to sell something. They even make shows and movies fit a certain formula because that is what sells and therefore they can get more bodies in the seats, get more box office money and get more corporate backers wanting product placement.  All the ads, everything is done for profit.  If more people could pull their heads out of their asses and understand this, then maybe they'd be less obsessed with how someone looks and acts and more with what kind of person they really are on the inside where it counts.  Sex would be at the bottom of the list of traits desired in a partner.  When I found out I was ace, I grieved for well over a year. I was so angry that I had been 'cheated' of all the best stuff in life that everyone else got handed to them! I was missing out! It wasn't fair!  Gradually I began to accept what I couldn't change.    I also realized something, after hanging out on tumblr. Sometimes people think that the most 'horse-faced, arse-named' person is incredibly attractive. Because of how they act, and how they are marketed, especially with appropriate emotional-button-pushing background music.  And even if an actor is plain and kinda dweeby looking, and all awkward acting, people will still think they're incredible because of how they're marketed.  Compared to the PR/Marketing juggernaut of mass media, the average joe or jane on the street is going to measure up as a schlub.  Schlub-ness is actually more 'normal' and common than the stars we're being sold as 'normal'.  What humanity as a whole needs to do is to accept that schlub-ness is the norm. And being a schlub is perfectly fine. 99% of us were 'born that way'.  And some of us schlubs are ace, demi, grey, bi, pan, gay, transgender, genderfluid, etc... And none of us are 'the only ones out there' But the majority of us are schlubs.  So don't worry, there are plenty of schlubs to choose from, the trick is finding one who accepts their own schlub-ness and the schlub-ness of others and is willing to work with the particular set of quirks and eccentricities that make you uniquely you, and who will appreciate the same from you.  In the immortal and wise words of Kurt Vonnegut:  “Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you’ve got about a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies — ‘God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.’ ”  Hope this helps!"
asexuality,2vobc7,oskietje,3,Fri Feb 13 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I really appreciate the response. Right now I'm feeling cheated. Most definitely. This, coming at the same time as having unreciprocated romantic interest and months worth of depression/realizing kinda for the first time that I'm crushingly lonely in a romantic sense, is kinda just setting me off. It's always good to be reminded of how ""schlubby"" most people are, and that pretty much everyone is faking it. I guess I should know, I'm pretty much a master at hiding my emotions and putting a big smile on my face (thanks years of acting and public speaking!). But I guess when everybody's doing the same thing it's hard to notice that not everybody is perfect.   I totally feel ya on the marketing thing, and am very much aware of how ridiculous all of that is and to what extent it's pushed on us. Sometimes I guess I sort of forget though, and a bunch of factors combine into making me think that I'm not normal since I can't really understand what everybody else is apparently putting forth.   Next thing to work on is getting over the ""cheated"" feeling first and foremost, and then go about finding somebody who wants me for me! Thanks a lot."
asexuality,2vobc7,LittleLuthien,3,Fri Feb 13 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"The only thing that I can help is to tell you that while you feel like time is running out, there isn't really a timeline on someone's life. Nobody knows how old they will be, nobody knows what life milestones they will hit at any given point in their lives, and comparing yourself to other's paths is unfair to you.  Do what you're comfortable with when you're comfortable with it. As for feeling inadequate, for a lot of us we can relate to that. Having said that, I think one of the milestones you have to look forward to is understanding and respecting yourself and your boundaries enough to be able to stay true to yourself, and understand that compromising yourself isn't a positive step.  I think it has to do with learning and being comfortable with oneself, but once you reach that point and can say: ""I'd rather be true to myself by myself, than with another and not be me."" You will have momentary lapses in self-faith, but always remember that you're on your own path."

It would almost feel empowering that you were a beautiful human who wasn't manipulated in certain ways. Honestly, that entire feeling is not limited to aces too. As well if you get into a relationship what's the chance to that you will end up burned and unhappy, or vice versa? To be able to accept yourself is mostly a prerequisite towards having someone else accept you really.  I'm going to be alone unless I marry someone else asexual, what's wrong with that? Every can dream a little but in the end I think I wouldn't mind being alone as much as the stigma, yes wouldn't you feel incomplete? But it's as much as being young and confused (and I'm young and I feel this ALL THE TIME) I think as being alone."
asexuality,2vobc7,vough,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:18:15 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with it! And I do feel empowered in that way sometimes. But since I feel such strong romantic feelings as well as the urge to be physically close with somebody else, I feel like I should be using my body in some way other than what I'm doing, even if I don't want to use it for sex.   I'm probably gonna seek out somebody who's ace/grey as well, and that's totally cool! Nothing wrong with that either, for me or you or anyone. Being alone isn't terrible (in fact I am quite introverted and for most of my life I've had no problem being by myself), but I think at least for me to experience for the first time actually wanting to not be alone is stressful, because while I've wanted to date people before, I've never felt the urge to seek someone out outside of wanting to be with a crush. I feel like I'm getting older and I'm running out of time (which is ridiculous and the logical/rational part of me can't even believe that I feel that way), and sometimes I just feel a great panic that I didn't get to do this when I was a teenager and that I'm behind the times.   Those admittedly preposterous feelings aside, I think, at least in my scenario, that it IS being alone that's making me feel a lot of how I've been feeling, coupled with the broken feeling. Those compounded are kinda nasty, cause now that I want to find somebody, I feel so insecure about my lack of sexuality to really be confident in doing so. I feel good about myself in pretty much every other aspect of life. Except this one. And I guess I just gotta figure out a way to feel good about it. And you're right, I need to feel good about myself before somebody else comes into my life. Thanks for responding :) Also nice username!!"

Also, ""I'm trying to present my communicative theory and make it work into my favor."" This is very bad science. You shouldn't be trying to ""make it work in your favor.""

This is the same type of thing some of the people I know have difficulty understanding — asexuality ≠ aromantic, albeit some of the latter are some of the former as well. Some people find it hard to untangle the knot of romantic and sexual attractions in their minds, so they'll easily ridicule someone who is already in such a way.  It's still absolutely a good idea to tell people one has the interest in dating that one is asexual if they are ready; after all, it is only fair to be frank to people who might be sexual.

They can't imagine being romantically attracted to someone and not wanting sex. Oddly enough, many see nothing wrong with things being reversed. Sex without romance. It's why we have prostitution and one-night stands.   It's just odd that they can be ok with romanceless sex, but not sexless romance. To them, that is a horrible thing."

asexuality,2vlgqf,Voiddreamer,5,Thu Feb 12 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"You already know that it's real. It's no less real when somebody tries to invalidate it.  You can either let it slide off of you like nothing, or you can defend your position.  The first is probably the better choice. You know how you feel and you have people who love you anyways.   If you say, ""I'm really happy right now,"" and most of your friends say ""nice!"" and one says ""Happiness is a fictional thing people made up to feel cool. You shouldn't feel happy!"" then it's clear who the insane one is.  Of course happiness is a real thing, you're feeling it after all. Of course asexuality is real, it describes you fairly well! Anybody who says otherwise can be safely ignored. They are delusional at best and outright insane at worst. Even if your sexuality later changes, that doesn't mean they were right all along. It just demonstrates that sexuality is a fluid thing and can occasionally (if rarely) change with age.    You can, of course, also defend your stance. It's the harder road, but if done properly, you might teach your friend something that he/she never knew before.  The important thing here is not to get mad or outwardly defensive. Instead, start a conversation with the person.  ""Oh, Have you never heard of asexuality before?""  If they say ""no,"" you can follow up with, ""Well, let me tell you a little bit about what it is and how it works.""  If they say, ""Yeah, I've heard of it, but it's clearly bulloni.""  Then how you answer is a bit different. Never defend the existence of asexuality. It's like defending the existence of a chair... or of yourself. You exist and there's no point trying to debate that with somebody.  One answer might be, ""Maybe you should do some reading about this. I really don't think you really know what asexuality is.""  From there, things can go anywhere! I find it often ends with,  Them: ""Everybody has a sexual preference for men or women!""  You: ""I'm telling you that I don't. I'm not sexually attracted to either men or to women.""  Them: ""Well, I think you are!""  You: ""So what then? I'm just lying?""  Them: ""Well, I guess you must be!""  You: ""Why would I lie about this? That's absurd""  Them: ""I don't know. Maybe that's what you think but you're just wrong.""  You: ""Well, maybe you're straight and you're just wrong about being gay, but for me to not believe you is just silly. Would you please give me the benefit of knowing my own mind?""  Them: ""Grumble grumble. Asexuality isn't even a real thing. Grumble grumble.""  You: ""Could we just agree to disagree then? You're never going to change my mind and I've given up on changing yours.""  Them: ""fine. Whatever""    You can see why the first option is the easier and probably the better option. There are some conversations you're never going to win, but even if you both agree to disagree there's a chance that the next asexual person they meet will not be met by the same invalidation that you were.  Even if they still don't believe in it, they might think silence is the better part of valor and keep their opinion to themselves. I do find that 99% of people who are initially skeptical do come around eventually. It's never during one conversation, but life experience and a bit of empathy tends to bring people around in the end."

Arousal from sexual stimulus can still happen for aces, in fact Dr. Lori Brotto's reasearch showed ace women and sexual women had comprable levels of arousal, but (obviously) different levels of attraction. I don't know about research on men. A libido is fine too, I'm ace and I have one, but I never masturbate to the thought of myself having sex with anyone, but I still grt myself off. I get crushes on people who are aesthetically attractive, and there may or may not be a hint of romantic attraction (I don't even know, man) but no sexual component. Essentially it's a more thoughful form of grade shool crushes: ""So and so is cute, I like them,"" not ""well I sure do want sex with that person."" It's also completely fine to have a gender preference in terms of who you might find aesthetically attractive, or if certain types of images arouse you. Check out: this tag on the thinking asexual"

It's not about whether you're willing to have sex with a partner; it's more about whether something about them makes you want to jump their bones.  Demisexuality is a bit more complicated, and has to do with sexual attraction growing in very specific contexts (typically only alongside a strong emotional bond)  I hope that information helps.

If you've never felt sexual attraction, even in that circumstance, you're ace, and if it turns out you're sexually attracted later on, that's when you change your label. It would be like calling yourself bisexual because you could picture yourself in a relationship with a same-gender or other-gender partner, but never having actually been sexually attracted to more than one gender. It sounds inclusive, and maybe hopeful, but it's not so accurate. If you change your label down the line, I'm not going to judge you for it, and neither should anyone else."
asexuality,2vhbw1,stumpling,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"If I understand you correctly, you're questioning whether your depersonalization/derealization is making you question whether you are actually asexual or if you just have a low libido due to the dp/dr.  I would advise against talking about sex, sexuality, etc. with any school teacher. At best it will make them uncomfortable, and at worst it will be taken out of context by a bystander and will get them fired. I also advise against school guidance counselors since, yes, they do tend to suck. A therapist you've been seeing for awhile would be good, but keep in mind that (s)he may not fully understand what asexuality is.  Keep in mind that asexuality is defined by not experiencing sexual attraction, not by not wanting sex. The two tend to go hand-in-hand, but you can always not want sex without being asexual. From what I could weasel out of straight men, it's a realization of sexuality when seeing someone you find attractive. I imagine it's more of a psychological response and less of a physical response for pretty obvious reasons, based on the demographics of my ""sample group.""   It may not be the best advice or even the most helpful, but if I were in your position, I would try to see if I experience any kind of sexual attraction in any way by looking at people who are traditionally attractive or people who I really like (such as friends) because maybe me liking them could correlate to me liking how they look."
asexuality,2vhbw1,Requiescence,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:38:23 2015 UTC,"At this point I’m fighting such a low that any advice is good advice. I’m not even sure what sexual attraction is at this point. Like, there are a lot of people I find aesthetically attractive and there are people who I can imagine myself having sex with but it’s not something I actively want/desire. I also don’t understand other people having sex. Like it was only recently that I realised people actually had sex.  I’ll definitely take your suggestion on board, though.  I should probably have been clearer for the last bit. I meant talking to someone at school about my mental illness, not my sexuality. Although I said there were teachers who knew about me being asexual, it’s only in the same way they know who’s gay, etc. It was just something one of us said and then they overheard. The teacher I was thinking of talking to doesn’t know about my sexuality and I’m 100% fine with that. I’m at the stage in school where the teachers and students are very at ease with each other, and while I’m fine to gossip and travel with them I’d prefer they didn’t know anything about my sexuality.  I only thought of going to speak to my old teacher because at this point in time I don’t have a therapist or a support network. Very few people know about my dp/dr because my family is a bit backwards when it comes to mental illness. Also because I don’t have to see my teacher everyday then I don’t have the added bonus of “I just vented and maybe even cried a little” to deal with every time I see him.  Oh wow, I rambled so much there. Anyway, thanks for your response! I’ll definitely take what you’ve said onboard. :)"

Because who could love someone as ugly as me? (Said my vicious inner monologue.)  The realization that I don't want those things anyway was .... incredible. I can't even describe it.

asexuality,2vea71,eatprayCaleb,3,Tue Feb 10 07:24:38 2015 UTC,"Asexuality is the inability to experience sexual attraction. Whether or not you want sex in general is based on personal preference and libido. Not all asexuals hate sex, some crave it, others are indifferent, many are repulsed. It's not about your actions, its about your attractions."
asexuality,2vea71,Ellie_Bracha,1 point,Tue Feb 10 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"I like you!  This post was super entertaining and made me smile!  Now, onto your actual question.  Your definition of asexual seems to match up pretty well with mine.  It may not match up with others.  The strict definition of asexual is ""someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.""    It seems like a simple definition, but it's really not.  ""Sexual attraction"" is what makes it complicated.  For me, it's rather hard to define that term, but this is what I feel like it isn't:   Sexual drive - Wanting some sort of sexual activity.  Feeling the need to masturbate, have sex, etc.  Feeling like you need to scratch that itch.  That being said, you can be ace if you have some amount of sexual drive, and you can be ace if you never have a sexual drive. Romantic attraction - Wanting a relationship with a specific person.  Seeing someone and thinking ""Golly gee, that man/woman would make a fantastic girlfriend/boyfriend!""   My best definition of sexual attraction is ""Sexual desire directed at a specific person.""  So not just ""Oh, hey, my jigglybits want attention,"" but ""I want to give and receive attention from that specific person's jigglybits, and I want it ASAP.""    You can absolutely engage in coitus and still be ace.  Your orientation has nothing to do with your actions.  A gay man can have sex with a cis woman and still be gay.  A bi woman can exclusively engage with other women and not be lesbian.    You seem like you could fall somewhere on the ace spectrum.  If you want, you can keep shopping for labels.  I personally go with grey-ace because I'm still figuring shit out and don't know how I'll feel sexually when I'm in a romantic relationship.    Basically, if you're comfortable identifying as ace, no one here or anywhere else has the right to tell you that's wrong.  Labels exist for the benefit of the people using them, AKA you!  :)"

The big example being cancer.  Unfortunately too there's a lot of medication people take for one reason or another that has a side effect of killing someone's sex drive. Even birth control can do it, but often it's some form of antidepressant.   So I cannot be upset at the actual questions they asked as much as the way they asked it. For those that previously had a strong sex drive and lost it - it's a huge deal."

asexuality,2va2ru,LittleLuthien,8,Mon Feb 9 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of asexuals still want to have kids, actually. Some will have sex just for the purpose of reproduction, and some will turn to artificial insemination to do so.   And those who don't have kids of their own biologically can adopt, giving kids who need loving homes the attention and care they need.  Furthermore, you don't have to have kids to be successful. I actually have an aunt who's married but chose not to have kids, and she's a successful lawyer who lives happily by spoiling her nieces. She's happy as can be and doesn't have kids, and that's fine.  People who say such things about ""biological failure"" must have very...odd lives if all they focus on is making babies."

asexuality,2va2ru,baethan,2,Mon Feb 9 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"This is why I sound like a broken record, even on this sub;  ""Attraction/Orientation ≠ Desire/Motivation ≠ Drive/Libido ≠ Behaviour/Expression ≠ Attitude/Opinion""  The general public needs to get this through their brain on all matters of sexuality.  You can be asexual because you are not attracted to anyone sexually. This is never going to be a side effect of a drug or illness because it is as natural as heterosexuality and homosexuality.  Some people call themselves asexual because they experience such severe hyposexuaility (Low sex drive) they have no sex drive. This may be a sign of something like a drug side effect, But not always.  Some people are asexual because they don't like presenting themselves as a sexual being, they prefer that their behaviour is asexual. (sometimes called ""sexlessness"")  Some people are asexual because their attitude and opinion of sex is one of repulsion, and having sex is not something they want to do, even if they experience attraction and drive.  All of this gets confused with celibacy, which is a choice to not have sex. A lot of asexuals are celibate, but not all asexuals are. Some allosexuals are celibate too.  ""Asexuality"" as a label accepts so many different individuals for so many reasons relating to sexuality. As a result, people end up with a really warped understanding of what asexuality is.  Unlike homosexuality, which is easily defined as ""wanting to get it on with the same gender"" asexuality is vaguely defined as ""lacking sexuality"", made more complex because ""sexuality"" is defined as ""your Attraction, Orientation, Desire, Motivation, Drive, Libido, Behaviour, Expression, Attitude, Opinion in regards to sex.""

It sounds like a story that was posted to the forum a while ago with a 10+yr marriage with a girl he thought was asexual that then cheated on him for some reason. I could be remembering it wrong, though."

That kind of thing.   I hate sound like I'm old, or hipstery, because it's not that, but I don't think I've enjoyed a sitcom since Friends. I do enjoy the lowbrow humor of Adult Swim and Family Guy. Also the Sailor Moon reboot.   I find forced humor difficult. I can't deal with unnecessary awkwardness. And most reality TV sets me on edge.   These days I don't have cable, but I get a cheap HGTV knockoff that's perpetually about 14 years outdated. Sigh."

I find shows like Iron Chef and Cutthroat Kitchen to be entertaining enough in a reality TV sort of way, without having any of the shallowness. And I like watching other people have their homes renovated.   It might be a little bit of a dream that I'll likely never be able to afford, there. But I find it interesting and relaxing. Also easy to zone out to if I'm doing something else; if I miss ten minutes of a show I haven't missed a major plot point."

All you really need to be welcome here is a willingness to understand and support.   Now, my internet-mom voice is gonna come out, and ask you: are you getting any help for your depression? It's totally fine to not want to have sex, or to not enjoy masturbation, but it sounds like these things are causing you some distress. It may help you to be more comfortable with who you are, what you do and don't want, and how you interact with others if you talk to someone about these things.

It's not really the fact that i don't enjoy sexual things that bothers me, it's just the anxiety i get from my phobia.   I fully understand that this isn't a depression help subreddit, so i'm not going to go much into that area of my life, i'm just hoping i can find someone who can help identify my sexuality, and i hope to be able to contribute to this community and support others in similar situations.

One of the things that made me feel like I was wrong is the fact that I'd had sex before, and on a couple of occasions quite enthusiastically, and it took a fair bit of reading and thinking before it sort of processed that I can have all the sex I want, but if I'm not attracted sexually, I'm still ace. That being ace didn't mean I couldn't have sex if I wanted to.   Once it all kind of clicked, it was wonderfully peaceful not doubting myself anymore. :)"

I used to consider myself heterosexual too, because I found people aesthetically attractive, but it turned out there was never a sexual component to that. It sounds to me that that's what was going on with your ex; she's beautiful, but didn't fill you with carnal urges, so to speak. I have a libido, and can enjoy smutty fiction, without trying to input myself into the scenario. That's  called autochorissexualism. I can think of aesthetically attractive bodies in sexual scenarios, and get off, but I'm not personally involved in it."

Or any other general illnesses that might affect the downstairs area? If not, then it'd should be fine if you don't worry about it too often. But if your family does, I would recommend getting it checked out."

Two years before I got on testosterone I needed a special kind of birth control that stopped my period completely because apparently the hormone swing of the cycle was making me suicidal. I saw multiple gynos all over the state (I moved around a lot) for this and I never had to take off any of my clothes. No tests. Nothing. Ever. I was surprised because they were really reluctant to give me the pills, saying ""See, we don't actually... know... what stopping the period completely... does. Over time."" Which sounded a lot to me like ""Dude it could give you cancer or something"" but I was like ""Pff whatever, if I don't get it I'll guaranteed kill myself so gimme.""   Though, I'm generally the kind of person who doesn't go to the doctor unless I'm literally dying or maimed with permanent repercussions. Not because I'm against medicine or anything, but I live in America and I don't have insurance. But I also don't mind the infrequency of medical attendance, either. (My endo doesn't count, we cool.)"
asexuality,2v162q,DratThePopulation,7,Sat Feb 7 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"I avoided having a pap smear done because I thought 1) it would be uncomfortable and 2) it was unnecessary but uh, it turns out that those are also helpful for screening for cancer and polyps and all sorts of shitty things. I ended up getting one done in the ER because something went wrong and the doctor said they're useful for reasons other than std screening. Considering how awful that whole experience was, I think I'm going to get them done regularly from now on, just to be sure there's nothing catastrophically wrong with my bits."
asexuality,2v162q,AdaleiM,8,Sat Feb 7 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"23, never had sex, but I had my pap done when I turned 21 anyway.  Better safe than sorry, right?  Besides that, it literally takes two seconds, and despite having heard it hurts (I'll bet the women I've heard say that were influenced by the fact that no one likes going to the doctor, and it's not exactly fun to have someone stick a speculum in your vagina) you honestly can't feel much at all.  I say go for it, because as inkling said, pap smears test for problems other than STDs."
asexuality,2v162q,channelz,4,Fri Feb 6 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"I've always heard it's only necessary if you are sexually active. If you aren't, then no need.   I'm also over 21 and never had sex and have chosen not to get it done.   Edit to add:  The main point is for cervical cancer. It will detect any abnormalities in the epithelium and a very high portion of these will be due to pre cancerous cells. Causes of cervical cancer aren't all known but about 90% is accredited to HPV which is sexually transmitted.  The reason why the recommended age is 21 is because most women will have had sex by then. In some countries the age is 25, but the main indication to start a pap smear is sexual activity and even then you wait a few years (1-3) after you first had sex to take the pap smear.   If for whatever reason you think there could be something wrong there, then of course feel free to get one."

If I end up having PIV before I turn 25, then I'm supposed to go in within a month or two for my innaugural one."
asexuality,2v162q,bootsorhearts,4,Sat Feb 7 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"I have never had sex and don't smoke (another risk factor for cervical cancer), so I see no need for a pap smear. When my doctor asks me  about it, I lie and tell her that I am already seeing a gyno. At least it gets her to leave me alone.  The cookie-cutter recommendations are for 99% of the people, but doctors should still stop to think if the tests are actually necessary."

(It's standard for the nhs to give you a pap a few months before you turn 25 unless you need one earlier)  I'm going to make the appointment and see how it goes. I don't think we have a history of gyno cancers in my family, possibly breast but to me, although I really don't want to (my first reaction was to text my friend ""THE NHS WANTS TO POKE MY CERVIX JENNY HELP"" I think it's worth the possible discomfort.

Otherwise I wouldn't have had one done for awhile. Anywho. I was told I would have a pap smear done along with a lot of other things, but when they went to check that area they chose to not do it. I just assumed that if the government medical people aren't going to do it, then it's not a big deal? But I really don't know. I wasn't given a choice if I wanted it done or not, they just chose not to. I'd take inkling's opinion into consideration about it, but just thought I'd share my experience.  edit: after reading the comments, I'm kind of annoyed they didn't go ahead and do it...considering getting the physical wasn't cheap.

And of course I didn't make a decision to never get a pap smear, just not to get one right now. According to my doctor, it might be a good idea to get one done just to establish a baseline, and then every ten years or so if there are no changes. But there's no rush, and I decided to put it off for now.  If I ever notice that anything seems wrong/different, of course I won't hesitate to get any tests done to figure out what's up."

Same for uterine cancer. Also, HPV can be (rarely) transmitted mother to child, so you could have it. Or you know, the several hundred other gynecological misfortunes that can befall a woman even if she isn't having sex.  But it's your perogative.

Everything I've seen about pap smears indicates that it screens for cervical cancer and HPV, but not for ovarian or uterine cancer. Though I didn't have one done at that point, I will probably get one done in the next few years (and my likelihood of developing significant changes that quickly is slim). I might not ever have one done at all though, because I'm at the beginning of a gender transition, and ideally in a few years I won't have a cervix (or uterus, or ovaries) anymore anyway. I might be stuck with them for a long time yet, so I'm not going to totally ignore their health, in the meantime, but I don't feel terribly invested in them. Maybe I'll get my first pap smear as a sort of send-off check that everything's still healthy shortly before they take it all out."

It is certainly difficult and has its challenges, we have been able to make it work. It's all a combination of a ton of communication and balancing of each others needs. For me, being sexually attracted to him and feeling a strong need/desire to have that intimacy and connection with him, there are days where I feel really vulnerable and wonder what's wrong with me that he doesn't desire me (I know intellectually that there is nothing wrong with me or him, but my emotions don't always listen to my brain). On days that I'm feeling this way, I've found that the easiest way to deal with my needs are to simply tell him. Then, we make time to be physically intimate, whether it is actual sex or just him holding me so I get the closeness that I need. But there are days where he needs a ton of space. So it will always be a balancing act, but as we have been dating over a year and are going strong (I know, probably no time compared to a marriage, but at least it's something), I would definitely say it is possible to be in a successful relationship."

Maybe I'm not watching enough TV for it to bother me, but then again, I'm happy I don't.  Also, I don't think calling them ""slutty"" because they're not dressed like in 1935, or any kind of slut-shaming for that matter, as anything to do with being asexual.

Just because I don't care about it or dislike it doesn't mean everyone has to.  Also I agree with your last paragraph, I'm quite sex-repulsed and am happy and content if I never have sex within my lifetime. But that doesn't mean other's who do, in whatever frequency, are shite.

It's realizing that their antics are supposed to move you and get you to watch them/keep watching. This can be said for basically all commercials etc. Sex sells. But to us that's a moot point.   And so, at times it really hits you and makes you feel like an alien.  (That's what I'm getting from it anyway)"
asexuality,2up9bx,Kali711,4,Wed Feb 4 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"It isn't that at all, to me. It's that that kind of gyration has been a source of obsession since elvis, if not earlier. But it does nothing for me but make me uncomfortable knowing that it does something for everyone else. It makes me feel like there's something wrong, like I don't belong on the planet, whenever there's something that seemingly affects everyone but me. This subject is one of the reasons I thought I was a broken person before I found out there were other asexual people. I felt like an alien because things that were supposed to be able to get everyone interested didn't have an effect on me at all. Whether or not they like it isn't the point, but the fact that I don't know anyone like me personally despite knowing hundreds of people is really distancing and dehumanizing growing up.  And I'm not saying that shaming anyone is a good thing, nor is the exact wording of this post the thing I was talking about. Nor am I saying that shaming people has anything to do with being ace. I'm saying that the prevalence in society of that kind of oversexualization, including of child musicians, makes me feel like I am from somewhere else and don't belong. And judging by the votes, I think a lot of others here agree.  That's why I titled it 'pretty much', not 'exactly'. I agree with the sentiment, not the exact message."

asexuality,2uoipp,ForzaEc,8,Tue Feb 3 23:18:13 2015 UTC,"Mine was...less than ideal. I (arguably) chose a very bad time to announce it to my parents (in the middle of an argument that I was hoping to win with this news) and it kind of blew up in my face. My parents (and when I say 'my parents', it's more applicable to my mom) have always been very open to alternative sexual orientations, so I thought that this would go over...better than it could have with other parents...but I think a lot of the problem comes from: a) lack of knowledge and frequency of asexuality in the general populace, and b) a secret hope by all parents to have their kids follow (mostly) in their shoes. How many times have you heard the phrase ""Oh, when you get married/have kids..."" or something similar?  My friend (who I just found out also identifies as aromantic, which makes me ridiculously happy that I have someone who understands and can talk with) and I both resist the urge to cringe when our parents say these types of things, because we know that it's unlikely either of us will ever give our parents those experiences.  I'm still in the process of dealing with the fallout of my ""coming out"" (6-7 months later), which involved therapy (in all fairness, not completely related to my asexuality, though it was a part), speaking with my doctor, and an upcoming blood test for hormone levels once I'm not exhausted from working all week to take. I think that once all the 'alternatives' are eliminated, they'll be supportive of who I am, since they seem to have said as such, but in the meantime, I'm jumping through the hoops just to reach that place since it's such a rare way to align one's self.  My friends have mostly taken the news unblinkingly. They either assume it's a joke (but don't actually make jokes about it, so I dunno), or, in the case of my best friends, just accept it. I had a really good talk with my closest friend about it one night after we had to cut our hang-out short for him going to see his girlfriend (unnecessarily), and I explained that I just don't get romance, or why he can't budget his time between the 4 of us and her evenly (""split custody"" was the term I used), and that the close friendship that we have (15+ years, since elementary school) is really the most realistic concept of relationships I have. He took it well, but I think laying it out there for the people you really trust is important (if you're comfortable with it).  Can't help you with the relationship part, I avoid that like the plague."
asexuality,2uoipp,livezinshadowz,7,Wed Feb 4 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"My brother 'J' identified as lesbian for years before finally officially stating that he was transgender this year.  Family accepted him just fine, even Dad who is on the old-fashioned side.  So when I told Dad that I was asexual a few months ago, I was pretty surprised when he started ""bingo-ing"" me.  So I asked him: ""Did you do this to 'J'? Did you ask him these kinds of questions when he came out?"" Dad said no, he didn't, and apologized. He didn't question me about it after that.  My bff has another bff who's gay, so she also took the news pretty well.    I just hinted about it to my mother (separated from my dad before I was born) as a general comment that aces exist and she had a negative reaction, so I didn't bother telling her I was one.  My husband (arranged marriage - we'll be married 20 years in August) actually took the news pretty well that this wasn't something that was fixable or curable.  He actually said it was a relief to know I was ace and that my lack of interest in sex wasn't about him personally.  We were both virgins when we got married, so I didn't think much about the lack of attraction. And after marriage, I figured I must be a slow starter.  Then I thought it was a medical issue.  Basically I ""bingo-ed"" myself six ways to sunday!  Tried everything I could think of to 'fix' the 'problem'.  Then along comes the internet and tumblr talking about Sherlock, Sheldon and Castiel and what the heck is this 'asexual' thingy I'm hearing about? Whoa.....omg. this explains alot.  Holy moly! I'm not broken, there's nothing wrong with me, this is just my orientation!  Who'd a thunk it?  Then came the 5 stages of grief that I was 'missing out' on 'all' the 'good stuff' that other people got to have.  Took a while but I came to accept it and now it doesn't bother me, and my husband and I have negotiated about what is still on the menu that we both are comfortable with.  I still worry sometimes, about if he's really okay with the lack of sexy funtimes, but we communicate and I told him he'd have to be a big boy and not martyr himself. If he wanted something on the menu, he'd have to speak up because it just doesn't 'ping' on my radar to even think about such things.  But I don't kid myself that he'd be happy if there was a complete lack of activity for the rest of forever, and luckily he was realistic about what he needed and was willing to discuss compromises that worked for both of us.  Hope this helps."
asexuality,2uoipp,geekerjoy1,6,Wed Feb 4 04:38:47 2015 UTC,"I got to kind of test the waters with this, unintentionally, several years before I found ""asexual"" as a word to describe my orientation. My best friend in high school came out as transgendered--admittedly a much starker, more obvious shift from the expected gender role--but through that I got to see who among my family was judgmental and thought they knew everyone else better than others knew themselves, as well as who was liable to jump to chemical or biological factors to 'explain' things rather than consider personal feelings and agency as important in their own right.   So, yeah. My parents don't need to know. I'm not sure if I told my sister, but I wouldn't really dodge around it with her. My close friends know. I've told my girlfriend but she had such a bad reaction that I think she's suppressed the memory and I'm not going to trust her with that information again--especially since it doesn't really have any practical bearing on our relationship.  Which brings me to my personal hobby horse on this subreddit; sex is an important aspect of a relationship, even if that aspect reads 'none, please.' But even moreso than that, many asexuals still possess a sex drive, and have sex on purpose because they want it, attraction not necessary.  I'm sorry you had a crap experience with family. Give 'em time; the pressure to have an immediate reaction makes a lot of people say a bunch of dumb and inconsiderate things. If it's important to you that they do understand, it might be worth your time to have a good talk about it one-on-one."

I have a friend who doesn't even believe in atheists, so I know I'm not telling her shit.  When my mom tries to start the whole, ""you'll find someone who will change your mind"", I just remind her that I always have been asexual and always will be, I just have a word for it now, and she knows my dating history so it all checks out.

I hang out with a, shall we say, mixed group, and by the time I actually came out, everyone had pretty much determined I was either asexual, or a lesbian in an armored closet, so the reaction was mostly ""Cool story, bro"" and moving on. There were a few people asking awkward questions, one who insisted that asexual was inaccurate because I don't reproduce by budding and I should really label myself as anti-sexual.   The one that really hurt though, was a gay friend of mine who insisted that EVERYONE enjoys sex and I just didn't know what I was talking about. Of course I had heard it all before, it just baffled me that he could be so callous after his family had said basically the same thing to him."

I've had friends who were incredibly sexual and romantic people who once they started medications lost all of those drives and didn't recover it for years. However did that make them asexual? Probably not but for many people who don't know about our sexuality it seems like a natural response.  I do'nt have a lot of advice for you. I've just been pretending to be straight to my family and just saying I haven't found a guy who would meet their qualifications which worked for a while but this Christmas I tried explaining it to my mother who immediately started calling convents and trying to get me to become a nun which isn't .... a kind reaction.

My stepmother said ""I don't think you're really asexual"" but when I talked to her more, she either understood/accepted, or decided there's no point not just taking my word for it, even if I'm wrong.  I think what most family/friends are worried about is that in the end this will mean you're unhappy. If you can explain that that's not the case, and reassure them that you're not averse to changing, they'll probably feel better. I think people who aren't supportive think they're helping by trying to tell you that you don't have to be ace, so when they understand that you're not choosing to, at the exclusion of other options, their resistance falls away."

When it comes to potential partners, just be honest. I'd wait it out two dates or so, to see if there's mutual interest, then mention it (of course this all depends on how comfortable you are with talking about it).

I am imagining that one of her biggest worries in your relationship will be not being enough, not giving enough. We live a world where having sex is the status quo, and even if she doesn't personally experience sexual attraction, she probably won't forget that other people consider it important. She would want you to be sure in your relationship, and if you find yourself needing something different, that you communicate that.   It is difficult for asexuals to feel confident that they aren't harming their sexual partners in some way by not having sex. For the asexuals having sex to please a partner, even happily, they may worry that they are damaging a partner's self-esteem by not being sexually attracted to them."

Secondly, you need to find another way of quashing the loneliness. Whether it's spending more time with friends, or finding new ones, or focusing on hobbies or school, or something. If you let a lack of a relationship be the reason for loneliness you're likely to go around in circles and feel even lonelier if or when the next one doesn't work out. I guess it's a little cliché of me to say this, but don't make someone else responsible for your happiness (or in this case filling the void).   Edit: and if you haven't already, if you're not totally opposed to tumblr, try checking out asexualadvice on tumblr.

asexuality,2umyl9,oskietje,1 point,Tue Feb 3 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"Being allosexual doesn't make it any easier to find a relationship that makes you feel less lonely. Some people have to look harder or wait longer before they come across someone compatible.  In the meantime, work on yourself, what are your shortcomings and what are your hopes and dreams for you as a person. Part of your highschool years is about finding yourself and developing hobbies and platonic friendships is a large part of that.   If you take an active interest in things it's easier to meet like minded people, some of those may be compatible partners.  It's natural to feel lonely, and it's not selfish to want a relationship. But it is a telling red flag in why some of your past attempts haven't worked out. You need to be pursuing a relationship with someone you like, not persuing a relationship you like with someone you know. You have to want a relationship with that person not just a relationship in general.  It's a hard distinction and made harder by the veil of loneliness."
asexuality,2uhfn9,Nerdodactyl,2,Mon Feb 2 04:43:20 2015 UTC,"I've been in two relationships since realizing I was ace... The first one was not good. The guy kept pressuring me and guilting me into having sex, even though he claimed that he understood what I was going through. But he still made me feel like shit every time he wanted to have sex and I didn't. He said it made him feel like I didn't love him and didn't respect his needs. A lot of resentment and tension built up between us, and it got to the point that I didn't even want to kiss him or change in the same room as him, because he would say that he couldn't control himself and it always led to sex, and I was getting sick and tired of being used like that.  We split up, obviously, for a lot of reasons, but I feel like that was a huge factor in why we broke up. Despite him saying he loved me and understood me, it was obvious that he just didn't. And as much as it hurt, I really wouldn't recommend staying in a relationship where there's a huge disparity between your concepts of sex and each of you views it.  On the other hand, my current relationship, this guy gets it. He has never ever pressured me or made me feel guilty about not having sex with him, he's respected me the couple times I've just needed to stop halfway through, and he's never made a single complaint or anything. He honestly bears no grudge against me for my lack of sexual interest, and the difference between his understanding and the ex's ""understanding"" is miles apart.   Sometimes, being comfortable with a person and being in love with a person just isn't enough if there's something that just can't be worked around. If he honestly can't understand your situation, and he keep pressuring you despite you clearly stating otherwise, then honestly I wouldn't continue to stay in that kind of relationship. The resentment and frustration is just going to build and build between the two of you unless you can come to some sort of understanding or compromise. But usually, when two people compromise, neither person wins."

That said, it's not okay that he keeps trying to pressure you into sex.  I always recommend communication. Explain to him clearly, without him interrupting, that you do not want to have sex, ever, at all, not even with him. (that's the vibe I'm getting from your post) And that you feel like he's pressuring you, and you need him to stop that.  You've said ""more and more often I'm feeling like he is trying to pressure me"" which doesn't actually seem all that comfortable and fun to me. He may not actually be crossing boundaries per se, but it sounds like he's trying to dismantle them.  If it turns out you two aren't compatible in a relationship, you may need to end the romantic part at least (maybe stay friends?). Imo that's better than submitting to sex you don't want to have."

Ive never dated again this expierence hurt me deeply, now the guy hates me and ill never get that friendship back.  In the end its your decision though this was just my personal experience."
asexuality,2uhfn9,juniperlei,2,Mon Feb 2 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry he didn't treat you as well as he should have. At the end of the day it's no one's fault if people aren't (a)sexually compatible, but it's still wrong to pressure someone for sex; you're not guilty of anything I can see."

asexuality,2uhfn9,juniperlei,3,Mon Feb 2 23:34:45 2015 UTC,"You're free to choose not to date, it's your life, but this reads to me like you feel that you owed a partner something you can't deliver, and that makes you guilty. You never owe anyone sex. You can always say ""No,"" and you might wish you could say ""yes,"" but you're allowed to set your own boundaries. In fact, only you are allowed to set your boundaries.  I suspect you're right - that he didn't believe you, but I characterize that as not treating someone well. When a person tells you something as personal as their sexual orientation, that person should be trusted to know what they mean, and that's the end of it. I'm not saying no further discussion, but continual disregard of a person's stated orientation is at best inconsiderate and disrespectful, and at worst intentionally invalidating. If he couldn't accept that you knew yourself enough to know your orientation, or that at the very least you called yourself asexual because you didn't want to have sex, it doesn't sound like he had a high opinion of you. (Sorry, I know that's harsh)  And if he needed to be in a sexual relationship, and the one he was in (with you) couldn't meet that need, he's just as responsible as you for continuing the relationship. Any time he acted like he accepted you're asexuality, he was leading you on. Letting you think the relationship would be what you needed (non-sexual), and then trying to introduce sex to the relationship was him trying to change the parameters. You did nothing wrong.  You don't deserve to be repeatedly pressured into something you've said you don't want. You didn't put him through something tough by simply not wanting sex; he misused you by disregarding your orientation and pressuring. I'm sorry that it was a bad experience for you, that you miss his friendship, and feel guilty, but you were not holding him back.   If a man goes to an ice cream shop every week and always ask for pizza, he's setting himself up for disappointment, but it's not the ice cream shop's fault they don't serve pizza; they're not a pizzeria. Even if they happen to have a ""pizza"" flavour, or a ""scoop and a pizza slice"" special now and again, dude is LUCKY to get pizza there, but he can't reasonably expect it, because why on earth would an ice cream shop have pizza? If it used to be a pizza place, then transitioned into dessert pizza (yes, it's a thing), then went full on ice cream, that man's just gonna have to find a different place to get pizza, if he can't go without. Even if that was his favourite pizza place. Even if it looks from the outside like most pizza places. Even if the location is great. Even if he's got such good memories there. Sure, the ice cream place may feel bad for the guy (because he used to be a good customer and seems well meaning, though clearly nonsensical), and the man could really be better off when he finds a pizza place he likes, but the ice cream store will also be better off with customers who understand that it's a damn ice cream shop, and who don't ask for for stuff that just plain isn't on the menu.  If you want to close up shop, that's your call, but it shouldn't be made in response to that guy who said he came for ice cream, but actually wanted pizza. At least consider reopening at a later date. You'll probably have more business now that that mad man has cleared off, too.  Edit: worst, not worse. Oops superlatives."

If you require monogamy, but don't offer sex, it can cause real distress for your partner, because now they are at a dead end.   Some partners become mean and manipulative about it (and should be dumped anyway, obviously), some suffer quietly- feeling sad and unattractive, and some might understand and be okay with little sex (but I think sex drive is mostly physical, not mental enough to simply think away).  Either way, the best we can do is explain very clearly, in the beginning, how far/frequently we are willing to go on average. Then it is their choice as to whether or not they can be happy with that.    Sexual incompatibility is just one of those things that isn't anyone's fault, but it's a legitimate reason to break up and move on.  It's hard to communicate clearly if we haven't had enough experience to know those things about ourselves yet.  Just keep being honest with him, and yourself."

One of the first times I ever slept over he was getting a little too touchy feely and cuddly which made me feel uncomfortable and eventually made me have a difficult time sleeping because it caused me to overheat so naturally I crawl out of bed and go sleep on the couch. When he woke up his first assumption was that I just ran away but when he saw me sleeping on the couch he got really pissed. I contemplated ending the relationship that morning but it was also his birthday (which was why I slept over) and I didn't want to be THAT person. I know he is considering furthering his education which will require him to have to move so maybe if he choses to do that I'll end it since I can't move until I finish my degree.

I'm pretty sure I'm asexual (although still questioning) and my partner is allosexual. I enjoy sex, but don't want to have it nearly as often as my partner. Our decision to open our relationship wasn't actually because of this but it's taken a lot of the pressure off of me with feeling like I HAVE to have sex (not that my partner ever pressured me when I didn't feel like it, it could just get a bit bothersome sometimes). Of course, we both had to be in a position where we are okay with being open and we knew what we wanted from secondary relationships. I also think it helped that we wanted to open our relationship for other reasons as well.  However, you don't HAVE to do this if you aren't interested in having sex. As long as you're open with potential partners about wanting to only be romantic and not sexual you'll eventually find someone you click with who wants the same things. :)"

asexuality,2uegvd,Leviathan666,2,Mon Feb 2 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"(Almost everything you're asking is in the FAQ, so I suggest you check that out when you have time) Lots of asexuals have a sex drive.  That has nothing to do with whether or not you're asexual. All asexual means is that you do not have any sexual attraction towards other people. Many asexuals masturbate. Many asexuals do not enjoy the idea of sex at all. Some like the idea of sex, but the whole ""other people being involved"" thing kind of ruins the idea for them (myself included).   Asexuality is a broad spectrum that has yet to be refined into a lot of sub-categories. If you aren't really sure that you are ace (which I don't know why you wouldn't be, you seem pretty obviously so), you can start identifying as ""grey-ace"" and seeing how that feels, as it basically means ""not sure where I fit under the ace umbrella, but I'm definitely in it somewhere"". That's sort of what I'm doing, in fact, but I will probably consider dropping the ""grey"" part of it once I've become more comfortable with this sort of thing, if I feel more comfortable identifying one way or the other.  As for the relationship thing, it is entirely up to you. Do you think you can put in enough effort to have a lasting meaningful relationship with someone you care about? Do you care about anyone enough to want to try? If so, I say give it a try, relationships are a learning experience and anyone who feels comfortable doing so should definitely try it. If it turns out it's not for you, no worries. At least you can say you've given it a shot and you weren't really feeling it at the time. Maybe you can try again, maybe not. It's your life."

asexuality,2ubms7,ahookerinminneapolis,2,Sat Jan 31 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a sexual woman in a 3 year relationship with an ace and I also suffer from this. I don't resent him or the relationship for it though- we just want to feel sexy and desired. Not having that from our partners feels a little strange, but (speaking for myself) does not casue any resentment for the ace or the relationship. For example, today I feel down about it. The way I help myself if I am respectfully honest with him about it. Just saying the words helps me feel a little better and helps me process my emotions. I've also just learned to 'trust'. Yes, he does not have sexual desire for me, but I need to trust that he really means it when he says he is attracted to me. It doesn't make the self esteem issue go away, but it helps me remember that it isn't something that is wrong with me- it is just the way he is. It's also important for evryone to keep their guilt under control. Sexuality or lack thereof is not something to feel guilty about. Yes, his asexuality may casue me to have issues with my self esteem, but I would never want him to feel guilty about it. Likewise I sometimes feel guilty for havng sexual desires (although we are respectful and have a compromise) but I know that he would not want me to feel guilty becasue this is just part of who I am.   With time it has also helped me become more independant. I don't rely on him to make me feel beautiful as much as I have with previous partners. There are times I want that reassurance from him, but when I need that and don't get it I just remind myself that I need to be confident and that there are many good thinsg about me.   Maybe try to compliment her on things that are not related to appearance as well. She might respond to this better. For example, if my boyfriend says ""I like your eyes"", I might have a bad moment and think ""Well, a sexual person could love my eyes too and really want to be intimate with me"" (I realize this isn't totally fair, but it is just how our minds work). When my boyfriend compliments me on non physical things it reminds me of how much I am valued and adored without putting my attention on things that are related to my appearance/desire/attraction. For example, ""I really love how passionate you are about __"" or ""I love ______ about our relationship"".   Sorry that was kind of an unorganized thought process.

asexuality,2uancq,jadefirefly,4,Sun Feb 1 00:14:59 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the first, but autochorissexual (good lord, autocorrect did not like that) is a type of asexuality where a person may experience desire or arousal when observing certain erotic materials, or enjoys fantasizing about other persons while aroused or masturbating.   It's a little complicated to express in short form. An example might be ... I don't know, let's find something silly like Jack and Rose from Titanic. (Don't judge, my brain likes to go blank when I really need examples.)   So let's use that. An autochorissexual might enjoy watching scenes where they're together, might get aroused while watching or imagining them together, or might fantasize about them while masturbating. The person doesn't want to be there with them, they just enjoy seeing or thinking of them in an erotic way.   It's not a hugely common word but it is google-able, and can probably be better defined there. I'm bad at this sort of thing."

For many people (myself included), it's very weird finding the asexual community and recognizing yourself as an asexual, when you still experience arousal and don't dislike the idea of sex itself. So it's a really nice little word that has the power to reaffirm some of us in our asexuality, helping us become a true part of the community. Sound silly but to me it's one of the most useful I've ever encountered.  For the wtfromantic, I learned it yesterday xD Basically it means that I do not perceive borders between friendship and romance. To me, there is no point where a friendship becomes something more.

The key thing is that humans don't fit into discrete types (which is why we have words like wtf romantic).  Spectrum theories have much more evidence behind them, and are more useful. Like the Kinsey scale, but there are newer models of sexuality that I think are more helpful. And when I say spectrum I mean like when you're in Microsoft Paint and you open up the colour wheel thing, not just a spectrum from 1-10.   You have a good idea, but I'm just thinking that you're trying to reinvent the wheel. Humans are just too varied to put in boxes.   Plus I think the words we have a fine. Mbti types aren't self explanatory to newbies any more than any other jargon. Any time someone enters a new field or a new social group, there are words and slang and stuff that they won't be familiar with. Aro and ace terms are the same."

I was thinking more in the line of organizing the tags that we already have into a letter system like the one used on the MBTI. Just sorting everything out a little bit.  About the way we don't fit into discrete categories, that's a problem that we already have with the words. I just don't fit well anywhere, and have to create a weird definition with too much strange words. Having something that summarizes that I:   Relate to many people independently. Don't make a distinction between friend and partner. Don't experience sexual attraction, but still experience arousal. Don't feel repulsed to sex, perhaps even like the idea, just not interested in participating.   I think having a word to summarize those characteristics would be nice. I know there will still be a lot of people moving between words and living on the boundaries, but there would be less than with the current system (I think).  But yeah, I'm not even sure what to include or how. It's complex.  My idea was something like:   A letter to describe how your body answers to other people: aroused with M (males), F (females), P (pan, all genders), A (asexual, none), G (gray-asexual, lightly aroused). Another to describe your sexual desire. Another for romantic relationships. Another to indicate number: M (monogamous), B (bigamous), P (polymori). ... Probably 2 or 3 more.   Not actually a test to predict how you are going to behave or anything, just a better way to explore different aspects of how you relate to people, and to explore them in a more... ""organized""  way than what we currently have."

asexuality,2u8ng2,alexsc12,21,Fri Jan 30 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Asexuality does not stop your plumbing from working. So most asexuals, male or female have full sexual function. They can get erect and get wet.   Asexuality might change what stimuli are required for arousal, But for the most part, asexuality only changes who you are sexuality attracted to, it doesn't change how your body responds to sexual situations.  I'm cis-female, I get aroused due to hormonal fluctuations (Ovulation for example) and this results in my  bartholin glands secreting lubrication, and my clitoris getting erect.  If I am directly touched in erogenous zones in a situation that is comfortable and consensual, sometimes I get an aroused response.  The key difference is that as an asexual, I feel the blood rush to my genitals and I think ""meh"" instead of ""Dear god, I want sex""  This is something I have to explain a lot, as a sex willing asexual, My sex partners often ask if I am still asexual, or even during sex say ""You say you are asexual, but you are enjoying this"" Yes, Because I still have nerve function, I still have a sex drive. I just have no target for that sex drive (as in, I don't find people attractive sexually) and no real motivation to seek out sex as opposed to masturbation or other hobbies.  Attraction/Orientation ≠ Desire/Motivation ≠ Drive/Libido ≠ Behaviour/Expression each of these components of your identity are separate. For example I can be asexual by orientation and motivation, but sexual in my expression and libido. Other asexuals might be asexual across the board."
asexuality,2u8ng2,mundabit,3,Sat Jan 31 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"Concise and well-said. The same applied to male arousal.  Read some paper a while back that separated behavior between arousal/sexual excitation system and a sexual inhibition system. More or less, the brain is constantly scanning the senses for ""sexually-relevant"" things, and will initiate an arousal response without any other feedback in the brain. The sexual inhibition system then acts as a ""safety switch;"" it checks stress, comfort levels, if the other person is attractive, and other factors and returns either ""yes I want sex right now"" or ""nah"". Can't find the paper right now, ah well... but if I had to guess, I'd say that for most asexuals the ""safety"" is always on; some asshole glued the cap shut over the firing trigger :/"

Sometimes, it's the physical things like you asked about that are necessary for asexuals to become aroused; we're most of us still capable of getting our groove on, we just don't base the desire to do so on sexual attraction."

Especially for childhood sexual trauma, it all focuses on 'reclaiming your sexuality', (and at that, often heteronormative sexuality), which can be pretty unhelpful to some folks. If none of you have that experience, it's not exactly your place to push for such things, but making it known that your club is receptive to backing up people who bring up concerns such as this, I think would be nice. And that can be as simple as having pamphlets handy that deal with this topic.   A supply of ace pamphlets on different topics. It's great, a+ that you're there to answer questions, A person-to-person Q&A is much clearer and in-depth than a pamphlet could hope to be, but not everyone is up to asking questions, or every question. Or perhaps they don't know what they don't know, and seeing pamphlets on given subjects will help. If you can't find any online, write some yourself. Sex-positivity & sex-negativity in ace communities/among ace people, romanticism as a separate thing from sexuality, kink & aces, aesthetic & autochorisexualism, the grey-ace umbrella, sexual fluidity, polyamory & asexuality, asexuality & trauma, asexuality & transgenderism (esp. w/regards to transition & hormone treatment & sex drive), masturbation & asexuality, Intersections of racism and normative sexual expectations, Safe Sex ed. (because not every asexual doesn't have sex, and some asexuals are homoromantic or bi/panromantic or other such groups where safe sex is undertaught, and asexuals in particular can be discouraged from looking for safe sex stuff), etc. etc.   Social things:  Your hangouts sound pretty grand already. Maybe some board games, or LAN parties, maybe a full potluck from time to time?  Reading circles or knitting circles or reading/knitting circles are usually a great way for multiple asexuals to pass hours in idle chatter.   Awareness stuff:  For minor funding and visibility, a cakesale might be great from time to time!  Do you folks already participate in any local pride march?

The centre is student run and in fact on its board of Directors there are two people that are Aces, Myself and a close friend of mine. If you want to spread awareness about your group I'd suggest talking to the students union about if you can put up posters to advertise your group, when and where you meet. Perhaps look into tabling, now I know not all universities don't do this but some do. Tabling is just when on campus clubs and organizations have a table set up somewhere busy on campus so you can advertise your group. For example for Ace awareness day you could have a table set up, maybe make some pamphlets up that talk about asexuality to hand out. perhaps if your university already has a queer centre you could look into teaming up with them.

They are really focused on sex positivity, which is cool and I support, but they sort of take to ""Everyone should have sex with everyone else all the time,"" and the more sex you have, and the more ""unorthodox"" the sex is, the better you fit in. So in other words, aces really don't fit in at all.

If they don't start throwing proverbial stones the very second I introduce myself as ace, it's because they're too concerned with bullying ""filthy cishets"" to care.  Without fail, even: there was one sole exception in the form of one of my friends who identified as bi, but since sexuality is fluid he recently decided that he's more on the grey-ace spectrum, so I don't even think that counts anymore.  Of course, I am sure that not all are like that, but my many bad experiences with them have been enough to get me diagnosed with depression (now gone, thank goodness) and turn me off of the movement for life."

And I realised this thing I've been feeling but ignoring because I thought I was 'not trans enough' was dysphoria, and holy crap, I'm a guy. So it did good things for me.  And now I feel like .. well, I still don't really belong. But that's okay. I'm not drawn to lurking so much any more, because I've got the answer I was looking for, apparently. So I drifted away from the LGBT+ communities a little, only hanging out in specifically trans and ace spaces.  And now I'm questioning my sexuality... But I'm sticking with ace for now, because it's the last term I had before 'hell if I know', and it doesn't feel wrong. And yes I do sometimes feel like I'm trying to creep up the LGBT ladder, but dammit, this is all out of my control. Also, this is part of the reason I still identify as asexual.  TL;DR: Felt unwelcome as an aromantic asexual person, felt only slightly more welcome as a trans man, stopped trying to enter LGBT+ spaces, might be gay or bi, probably still won't go back."
asexuality,2u20b0,romaniwolf,5,Thu Jan 29 10:00:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like it really depends on the space.    Like, my uni's Rainbow Alliance is super awesome. They're what helped me to realize. Yes, most people involved are of the LGBT four, but they make an effort to reach out to those marginalized even withing the community. They've put on events for bi, pan, ace, non gender binary, intersex, etc etc. They're even having a big event this spring about the intersection of being a minority race and gender (because last year was the single most violent towards black trans women in the history of since they've been recording that kind of thing in the US). There is even one person who I can't help but look up to because early on, when I expressed that my problems probably weren't as serious as there aren't any outright hate crimes or anything, stopped me and insisted that I shouldn't invalidate my own problems because someone else's might be objectively worse. They're still prblems and still need to be addressed. He's enthusiastic about being a frat boy, enthusiastic about being in the army, and super enthusiastic about being bisexual. There are even four or five other ace people I've met in this group.  But that's just one group, and I have to admit, it's the only one I still feel comfortable in. The internet can be the worst. I unsubbed from /r/lgbt because someone went on a long tirade about ace people, and they were highly upvoted. It made me feel really bad about myself. And I know that in many real life spaces there seems to be a general hostility as well. For some reason people are comfortable with you being sexually attracted to whomever, just as long as there is sexual attraction. I've run into people who think I must have some sort of medical issue or psychological problem to cause this.  By far the worst are the ones who claim that it's not even a thing, that it's just being picky (especially if you do occasionally have sex). And those ones get worse when it comes to demisexuals or other gray-a's.  TL;DR: I consider myself queer. I have been lucky to find one really nice queer space. Every other space I've tried is not so much."

At the time, I was - and still kinda am - figuring out what attraction I feel, if any at all.  I think if someone is asexual and has relationships with or any sort of desire for them with people of the same gender, then they would ""count"" as LGBT in my mind. Asexual people who are solely heteroromantic would not ""count"" in my thoughts as their relationships are the sort that appear ""straight"". They wouldn't have experienced the difficulties that come with being homo/bi-attrracted.  It's perfectly fine for any sort of people to participate in GSA groups and such spaces, so long as they are designated as being open to anyone. It's almost impossible to ""check"" who's LGBT anyway; I remember there being a huge controversy at one of the gay clubs in my college town around people not being let in for appearing ""straight-looking"". Which is fucked-up, but I also understand the desire for LGBT people to have their safe spaces. It's a very difficult topic that I feel is pretty damn impossible to answer sufficiently. :/  Myself though, I don't identify myself as 'LGBT' as I've transitioned and am read all the time as my actual gender, and have no interest in being 'out' in any way about it. I also experience no desires to be in relationships (at least not of the sexual or romantic sort) with other men. As such, I am not LGBT. If I went into their spaces, I would let them speak for themselves, and not try to push my thoughts and ideas on people who I do not share (or at least, do not appear to share) the marginalised treatment of by society.  This is just a difficult topic and my rambling will never feel sufficient, so I'll stop now for not wanting to keep repeating ideas. :)"

If I try to assert myself too much in those spaces, I'd get attacked for sure.  I've had excellent experiences among queer friends. My favorite anecdote is kind of a weird one: Being sat at dinner with a whole slew of trans/non-binary folk(I being the token cis dude, unannounced as ace), some of them I knew, some of them I didn't. We were talking about what was wrong with the academic conference we had just been at(we had plenty of grievances) and I was trying to express my incomplete thoughts out loud, and then one of them just blurts out, in this surprised tone: ""You're different!"" Like, not in a patronizing way, but in a ""wow cool"" way. I thought it was charming, especially in light of what it looked like with me sitting at that table surrounded by obvious visible difference, although I don't think I tried to respond to it. Maybe that isn't to do with my sexuality, but maybe it is - after all, the conference was ""about queerness"" so I guess my perspective would be different.  I do get wary of the folks in these spaces who want to dispose of their own critical lens and just dismissively blame things on some mix of kyriarchy, capitalism, religion, normativity, colonialism, etc. That way just makes them footsoldiers for someone else's politic - plus I've noticed that they tend to be more fervent when they were victims of abuse, it makes them much harder to talk to. You can feel this ball of poorly directed negativity in everything they're saying, waiting for a chance to lash out with something bigoted. Likewise there are people who view these spaces opportunistically and will leverage the footsoldiers if they consider it personally advantageous. There are minefields. You don't want to be a target.  The people who really think deeply about those topics tend to have sharp, clear-minded ideas, though. That's what really keeps me interested."

Personally, I identify as gray-ace lesbian. But people simply don't get that while I'm attracted to the same sex, my physical attraction and sex drive are only marginally above zero and couldn't care less about being in a relationship or having sex. Publically, I identify as lesbian since that's the most ""acceptable"" identity, and people understand it very easily (even those not supportive).  But I definitely feel very odd with the idea of joining LGBTQ spaces outside of the corporate environment, because I know that I won't belong. I'd honestly not fare any better than most of the aces here have described. On top of that, I also am Indian, and that adds another dimension. I live my life as a conservative Indian woman who is gray-ace lesbian. You can easily see how I'd have a major culture clash with the mostly-white, promiscuous types that the LGBT community is famous for. Especially since many of them completely ignore or dismiss my almost-aromantic/barely-homoromantic, almost-asexual/barely-lesbian parts.   So while I might take part in a Pride parade for the hell of it (since I'm still marginally lesbian), I probably wouldn't do much more than that, unless I found an LGBT group very specific to conservatively-living Indians/Middle-Easterns/Asians.

Because I am not heterosexual, I am queer. Some people disagree (sometimes based on the notion that you can't reclaim a slur that hasn't been applied to you or your people), but actually, all the people I know who aren't cis-het accept asexuality as a queer identity. And this does/should apply to even heteroromantic aces. Why? Firstly because yes, aces are discriminated against, stereotyped, etc in similar ways to non ace queers. Secondly, aces and other non cis-het people can really benefit each other with new and constructive language we're creating to understand ourselves and each other, regardless of romantic orientation. Thirdly, I've seen it put like this: ultimately if you don't think heteroromantic aces are queer, you're equating their sexual orientation to heterosexuality, which it isn't, and you're denying their experiences of hardship that stem from not being heterosexual. That's certainly no good. In terms of actual queer spaces, I'm not entierly comfortable, but that's at least partly because I just don't know what I would do at any such event.

According to most homo/bi/pan sexuals, not necessarily, because your social issues do not align with theirs. You are not fighting their fight. You are not the target audience of their outreach campaigns. Yes, a few enlightened groups may offer you shelter recognizing that you have no place else to go, but when it comes down to it, many of them think you belong someplace else. (Perhaps in a hospital getting your head checked, because who doesn't like sex? /s)  In general, LGBT groups are not targeting asexuals.

That rhetoric is the same rhetoric that implies that sexuality can be changed intentionally on a whim. Asexuality is in the same vein as being heterosexual or homosexual — it occurs, but it is not chosen. (I do not outright believe that insinuating this idea was your intention. I am clearing it up so it does not get obfuscated again. Clarity is necessary when discussing orientation.)  You can easily be a heteroromantic asexual (meaning you are attracted romantically to the opposite sex, but do not want sexual interaction with that person). Romantic, sexual, and aesthetic attractions are not hitched to each other. They are separate but align in a great amount of people. Love does not equate to sex or aesthetic appreciation. Speaking personally, I can admire beautiful faces, but I doubt I'm ever going to have sex, and I'm mostly unlikely to find a suitable romantic relationship.   Remember that the words we use to describe our orientations are, like all words, just abstractions of human thought. It might not be 100% accurate for some people (myself included).

Another is hiring a surrogate, if you do not want to carry the child. Fostering children is one option, but does not always end in adoption. And then there is adoption, which there are many routes.   If you are a man, you have many of the same options, sans insemination. IIRC, you may have more barriers in adoption, due to our culture being wary of single men and children (rolls eyes)."

I see no need for touch.

It's not unfair to say that a lot of people on the ASD spectrum question asexuality in regards to their identity, and may decide that this is a safe space.  My brother identifies as Aro-asexual, and talking to him he really does have a lot in common with us Ace's, but he is the first to specify ""I'm only Ace because I'm autistic and I don't understand attraction or romance.

Do you think you're qualified to attack people in the subreddit they call home?  Secondly, you're advocating that people on 4chan and other threads are stubborn and not to confront them with asexuality, yet you're posting this to the asexuals that use 4chan (and post on other threads). Didn't you just call them stubborn and not to try and change their mind? I'm sorry but I really don't see the point.

I've seen other aces mentioning there's been just one or two people they've been attracted to in their lives, and I've had one myself - never been even the slightest bit interested in anyone else ever, but then there's this one character who I kind of fell in love with...  I'd keep considering yourself ace/aro for now, and assume he's maybe one of those exceptions. Then, if you start noticing feelings towards anyone else, then yeah; maybe start looking into the possibility of you being grey-ace/grey-aro or even being another orientation entirely. Otherwise, I'd suggest you keep identifying as aro/ace.  Oh and yes, aesthetic attraction is a thing. It gets mixed into sexual attraction a lot, but aesthetic is sort of feature-based. You might be aesthetically attracted to someone because you like their hair, eyes, appearance in general, etc - but just because you like their appearance doesn't mean you want to have sex with them (or if you do, that's sexual attraction). That's how I've come to understand it, at least."

It didn't and I quickly realized that I might be fooling a lot of people, but I wasn't fooling myself and just because the social convention was that guys date girls, that's not what I wanted. It started a long figure-stuff-out session that lasted several months before I came out as ace. I feel really good about my decision now, but I don't know if I would if I had suddenly made that decision. I don't know, I like making sure I know what I want, and that I'm not acting on whim.   That said, your situation is totally different and I don't think that there's anything weird going on with you at all. People figure stuff out and think things through and come to realizations. Maybe you're ace and maybe you're not. I don't think that limiting ourselves based on labels that we only apply for convenience anyway is a good idea. I think that if you like him and want to explore the option, do it. Besides, plenty of asexuals get into relationships, even those who consider themselves aromantic.

I know that's not a good reason, but I feel like I can't just make myself ignore that.  Even if I did try to explore the option, I have no idea how I would do it. Unless I've completely misread something, he and I have a completely platonic friendship, and I don't know how I would change that.

It's really unfortunate that we live in a world that doesn't always understand that sexuality comes with a degree of fluidity. But this way, you don't have to worry about flirting or anything, because trust me, I get that too. :P Again, you don't have to take that advice, I just think that taking things slow in general is a good idea.

Usually my real life love interests end up absolutely crushing (hah) my soul because I've never crushed on someone that likes me back.   Depending on how serious your crushes have been OP, I would say having over 10 crushes definitely doesn't put you in the grey/aromantic category automatically based on number alone. It's more about the content of said crushes. Hell, when I told my therapist I have had only 5 serious love interests in my life thus far she mentioned that that's actually a pretty high number compared to a lot of people she has worked with."
asexuality,2tu6jo,BlueCalx1,2,Tue Jan 27 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"20/m and I've had two or three legitimate crushes so far in life. Only one of those was strong enough to give me the nervous butterflies-in-the-stomach warm-faced feeling, though.  The small numbers are probably more to do with being really picky, though, because I feel like most of the time I'm embarrassingly romantic. I love the idea of it. You know the guy that will watch a chick flick with female friends, give it undivided attention and get really caught up in the story, and then stoically announce at the end ""I hated it"" when actually their soul has just been reduced to a gushing, fluffy mess? That's usually me.  I think I've figured out the social pattern to my crushes, however. First, the person has to be pretty and have an independent sort of personality. Then they have to respectable -- really respectable -- in some form or another. I then need to have an admiration for them on the same level as a rival or something; basically, I need to think that they're really really cool. This much is usually completely non-romantic. I get to this stage pretty often without necessarily letting my feelings progress, which is pretty nice since it means that in most cases I can more or less decide not to crush on someone. However, if I let myself think about romance between myself in this person or if the topic is brought up by some scenario or a major hint of feelings on their part, I will then get a romantic crush on them. I have a very visual form of thought, and I'll start imagining picturesque scenarios and such. Like really sappy Disney storybook/RomCom stuff (this is where the aesthetic prettiness, and maybe even [arguably] the requirement of being the opposite sex, comes into play for me -- I'm a very visual person with a very stereotypical picture of ""romance"" in my head)."

When I was 7, I had a ""favorite  boy"" in our class, but I don't remember there being much emotion, I just kind of picked him because I thought he was handsome. I didn't interact with him or think about him that much. Not sure if it counts.  When I changed schools, there was another boy. He was popular, visible, liked by all and actually paid some attention to me, so I crushed on him for several years. I never felt the need to do anything about it, but remember feeling some stuff, so I'd say this one counts.  During my whole adolescence and up to present, I had several characters and actors crushes, probably two of them I consider strong. By ""strong crush"" I mean, thinking about them literally every day. But I never thought of celebrity crushes as ""real"", because I consider them very one-way, there is no real interaction, they don't have you in their life so there is no relation. If I met them for real, probably I wouldn't even like them. It's just this idealized idea, like admiring a persons character as a work of art.  There were two or three real life minor ones, but I'm not sure if those were crushes or just feeling awkward around that person because they are male, somewhat handsome and in authority in that particular situation (sounds messed up, but it's true).  Then in my late teens-early twenties, a strong crush on an online friend whom I never met, but at least there was a two-way interaction, even though only by text. It caused me some torture as I watched his interest gradually disappear. This one counts. Even though I was always sure that if we would ever meet, it wouldn't work.   And then there is the most recent one, strong one, hopeless but still lasting.  Which makes it... 3 proper ones. I'm 26.

asexuality,2ttj6b,Resterian,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:36:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's societal upbringing or part of the human condition but it seems for most people that the more sexual they are, the more they subconsciously link love and sex together.  Consciously, of course, it can be separated. People have one night stands and are just fine and people can be in love with a person before they have sex with them. It seems, however, that there's a level to which - when a sexual person forces themselves to stop thinking about a person sexually, they start to internalize away the romance.  You spend a lot of time with this person and are very close. You share everything, but somehow they feel more and more like a sibling instead of like your significant other. You can't quite place why.  You still want to have sex. That drive is there... but when you look at your partner, it's not present. You've learned to suppress it, but in doing so, you've removed something that you've previously trained yourself to feel about the people you love romantically.  You start looking at other people and wondering what sexy-time with them might feel like. You're not cheating or anything, they're just harmless thoughts, but they're thoughts you have because you're a sexual person and they're not thoughts you ever allow yourself to have about your actually partner.  It creates an internal dissonance.  I hang out with a lot of people who identify as Ace and see this play out somewhat consistently. They're great people; they're honest and sincere; they do everything that the perfect couple would do. They're open and honest about their feelings and they share a deep connection.  Somehow, however, the sexual in the couple slowly drifts apart and it seems like there's nothing either of the two can do to stop it.  I think a low of people have seen this play out so often that they become incredibly skeptical of these sorts of relationships.  That they never work is of course not true. They do work out often enough, but it does seem like the odds are against it. The worse the communication between the couple is, the faster it seems to fall apart.  It's a difficult problem to address because we don't quite chose who we fall in love with. We want to make it work, but your sexual orientation is a difficult thing to compromise on.  This isn't really meant to be advice as much as it's meant to bring some insight."

It is for anyone, but from what I've experienced and heard about sexually active asexuals is that it's easier to sort of disconnect or not be into it. Which is definitely the case for me. Sometimes I'll want to have sex, but at some point during it I might just hit this wall and I either lose interest or get anxious. So always check in, keep talking and make sure she's okay often. It may seem awkward now, but if you are always communicating that should really help a lot. So either one of you can stop when you need to, or express interest in going forward with it.   Also, this is a good article to read that says it more eloquently than me. The whole blog is excellent about these types of things."

It's not like there's a puzzle lock down there that you have to solve before it opens up.  The mechanics will be largely the same.  (Of course, she may be smaller, more sensitive to pain, have vaginismus or something similar, but those aren't a result of asexuality.)  If you're concerned about pain:  A) Use lube, B) Foreplay, C) Let her control the depth and speed, at least to start with, and D) Make it clear that it's fine if she wants to stop at any time.  The differences are going to be more mental.  She might not be as into it as other partners were.  Things that might have worked to turn them on (stripping, talking dirty, etc.) might not work as well with her.  She might even get bored.  Like the other poster said, communication is important."

asexuality,2toqsv,Minya_Nouvelle,19,Mon Jan 26 03:52:56 2015 UTC,"That doctor is an asshole. Plain and simple. Even if there WERE some sort of actual, physical thing wrong to cause your lack of attraction, handling it that way is just terrible.   You don't need to see a therapist unless you want to. Period. That's it.   Now, it can be that a lack of libido is a sign of something wrong, usually hormonally. (On occasion these can be potentially serious things, but if you've had the usual checkups and visits, and nothing seems medically out of the ordinary, I wouldn't worry too much.) But there is a difference between a lack of sex drive, and a lack of sexual attraction.   You're fine. That situation was handled poorly by people who should know better; you did nothing wrong."

Still, I'm willing to give it one shot. If I don't like it, I won't go back.  To be fair, that's probably why the doctor thought I was hiding something because my voice went all high pitched when he started asking me questions and I couldn't hold any composure. In reality, he was just making me feel super uncomfortable."

Most of them were pretty chill, but one of them just really rubbed me the wrong way. She knew I had anxiety, she knew I had dysthymia (a kind of depression that tends to manifest as a permanently ""grey"" kind of mood, without the really deep major depressive episodes) and she knew that I don't usually get emotional with strangers.  Despite all this, she kept trying to steer the discussion back to the fact that I ""don't display much emotion"" while talking about past issues and my tone was very monotone.  I kind of wanted to say ""no shit, sherlock, that's all right there on the paperwork"". Point is, some of em listen really well. Others tend to think they know better than you how you should feel. If you want to talk to one, keep pushing till you get one that really listens. They are out there."

I'm still coming to terms with my own lack of sexuality and I know you didn't come here for advice, but one thing I would say is that the next person you speak to (whether it's the doctor, therapist, or someone else) tell them IMMEDIATELY to google asexuality and that you'll wait while they do so. Good luck!!!"
asexuality,2toqsv,3fox,6,Mon Jan 26 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"You're probably fine, but the doctor did really badly there. You might want to try the therapist - but if you start to suspect it'll go down the same path, you can clam up, answer politely yet evasively until time runs out, and then just never come back for a round two. I did that once upon a time in college.   At the time, I had academic difficulties that were just a combination of a lot of different factors - everything from behaviors learned from the parents, to my intrinsic motivations, to my conception of time and my tendency to stay up late, to my dietary staples and how they affected my mood and ability to concentrate or stick to any planned activity schedule. I could work hard at many things, yet I couldn't get past this certain barrier, and it was making me feel deeply guilty - after all, it was something my brother had studied previously without trouble, and this set up a bad expectation. My parents, I think, were the ones who suggested getting a session with the school's therapist.  I quickly intuited, though not really knowing what was wrong myself, that the therapist was probing things that were basically unrelated - things about my daily activities and hobby projects, which were both an escape and also my ""true"" interest, going above and beyond any coursework I had - and if I expressed them to him, he might be led into a misdiagnosis that would result in further harm. I just wanted to be left alone, and in the end I managed to struggle through, graduate, and - in bits and pieces over the next decade - find the alone time necessary to properly reflect on it all. I don't think he would have been able to help when it was something that had no clean, simple answers.  edit: And yeah, my (gray)sexuality never really factored into it."

No, no no. Don't do that.  If a doctor, therapist or other professional is actively making you worse, tell them, ""Go fuck yourself you quack. You are incompetent and don't know what you are talking about."" And then immediately walk out.   There is no reason to put up with shit from someone just because they have a degree in something. There is no reason to be civil when they've just attempted to invalidate your identity. There is no reason to stay and listen to them. You are not a prisoner. Staying wastes everyone's time. Maybe with the block of time you've just given them they will educate themselves. Even if they are right about something, their terrible bedside manner just proves that they are incompetent. There is no reason to ever speak to them again as you do not respect their 'expert' opinion due to the above.   Keep in mind that doctors used to treat homosexuality with electroshock therapy. They get things wrong sometimes. Unless they are forced to reevaluate their advice by someone rejecting it they will just continue to assume they are right."

One week I told her that I'd spent the weekend playing Diablo 3 because a new patch had come out, and she questioned me about what that was, walking me through the questions like, ""What character did you choose?"", ""Why did you choose that?"", ""Why do you play the set/build you play?"", etc. (for the record, I'm a guy). It was...hard to explain (especially to someone who has NO understanding of the topic whatsoever), but she was willing to listen to the explanations (and try to psychoanalyze them [rather unnecessarily, I thought]) regardless. When it comes to things like anime/Pokemon/video games (my kinda hobbies!), it's entirely possible your therapist will just walk through them the same way mine did with me.

asexuality,2toqsv,AsexualityArchive,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:11:27 2015 UTC,"No favorite bands or songs for me either. It maybe for a different reason for me than most though. I don't really listen to music at all. I'm rather indifferent to it.  To clarify, is it a pet peeve that you are asked one of these questions at all? Or is the peeve the response you get when you don't get an answer that conforms to what they expected? Cause for me it's a little of both. If they are genuinely interested then I don't mind. But if it's something like your situation where it was analysis by a doctor then it is simply unpleasant. For me it's the ""let me judge your choices"" element that I don't like.  Here's a pet peeve of mine that seems relevant to you... I was really sick a few years ago and one of the symptoms I was having was that my brain was in a fog- like was drunk or something. Therefore I had a great difficulty explaining to my doctor what was going on. So I, (and this is the relevant part) wrote down about three pages of things for my doctor. The pet peeve part was that every single doctor I attempted to show it to refused to read it. It was like they were trained not to let that happen or something. That was frustrating.  Edit: Now I'm curious. Is it still your pet peeve to be asked for your favorite____ when you've expressed interest in a topic? (Eg what is your favorite pokemon?) Or is it because the question has the implication you must be interested in something (because of course everyone is interested in that) when you haven't expressed any interest in it before? (Eg Who's your favorite boy? Or who's your favorite band?)"
asexuality,2toqsv,kalg,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can understand that. If a doctor actually cared, I don't see why they wouldn't read what you wrote. I don't see the logical reason behind that. Its not like what you say has any less value than what you write. It's just an alternate way of communication. What would they do if someone physically couldn't talk?   I've had plenty of bad experiences with therapists. Other than flat out lying, they always seem to think everybody has to be one particular way. They don't seem to accept the fact that some people are just different, or they think that different is wrong. I got called into the guidance office because I wouldn't eat lunch with people (which they thought meant I was depressed) and I've also got called into the guidance office because I wasn't upset that people were making fun of me (they were concerned that I was too happy). There's no way to act appropriately. Everything you do is wrong in some way.  I guess for me, a pet peeve is also a little bit of both. Usually,when I answered those types of questions, they never shared their response with me. They never liked it if my reply wasn't short and sweet. It always felt like they didn't actually care what my response was. I once refused flat out to answer the song question. When they kept pestering me, I said ""The Sound of Silence."" I don't think they got the joke.  PS: I just realized that Therapist becomes ""The rapist"" with just one space."

If I've expressed an interest in something, I don't mind it, but usually it annoys me when people come out of left field about it and then don't tell me their answer once I've given mine.

My best advice would be to focus on building your life, you are at the best age to do so right now. Studying, getting a job, etc, is not easy when you have anxiety, but it can be done. Ignore your classmates if you have to. Not easy when you are a sociable person, but your success and peace is more important than their approval.

I mean, trying to look at it from their perspective, I think I understand them too. When they are told that someone is asexual, they are forced to fit into a very sexualized world view this thing that doesn't quite fit. Most of the time that means making you into something your not or somehow trying to find a cause. Which is totally unfair, but I understand what they are trying to do, anyway.   For me, I'm out to a few close friends (and anyone else who would care to ask, but that number is relatively few), and they have been really supportive. I think that if you look for friends who are positive and think really openly, you'll find people who will accept you. And those who don't accept it you probably don't want to have around anyway. As for the rest of the world who insists on figuring you out, let them alone. Who cares. (Stupid psychiatrist lady. Honestly, some people.)  As for your parents, you don't have to tell them this, but they don't get to choose what orientation you are. It's your life, not theirs. It sucks that they aren't supportive. Just don't bring it up much around them, and if they say something just say that you're doing okay and nothing's really changed in that area. Don't let it bother you that they don't understand.

Some people manage to have an healthy relationship even without sex; when the sexual's drive become too high, masturbating and/or sex toys can be used to alleviate their envy.  -Open relationship. It isn't unheard of for asexuals to ""allow"" their sexual-oriented partner to have relation with other persons. This however depends highly on the individuals involved, and HAS to be discussed thoughrouly and fully agreed with by both individuals. If one of you has even the smallest reservation about it, DON'T DO IT.  -Semi-sexual relationship. Asexuals will sometime have sex just to please their partner. Again, depends on the indivials involved. Some are fine doing it as often as their partner wants/needs, for others it is a chore, others are absolutely incapable of it.  Through this however, there are a few things that you MUST remember:  1- Many people do not realize this, since they see asexuality as a ""lack"" of a need. But having the peace to decide for our own IS an extremely important need for us. What is best for her may not be what you would prefer, but always remember that her happiness is just as important, if not more important, than yours.  2- Related to the above. She is under NO obligation to ignore her own needs and wants, to satisfy your own need and wants. It can seem obvious said like that, but when you have a high libido, that is something that can be difficult to remember and/or accept, especially when your drive ""flares up"". NEVER put any sort of pressure on her.   3- All of this may seems bad to a sexual person. Our culture tells us that sex is an integral part of a relationship. It is not. Support, affection, fun, all of those things crucial to a relationship, exist outside of sex. It is how you live in your relationship that matters most.  4- Most importantly: Your relationship may succeed, or it may fail. But no matter what it does, always remember that, like any new experiences, it is a learning opportunity. Take everything positively, and no matter how things ends up, you both will end up grown.  Best of luck! HUG!"

I'm not very interested in abstinence or an open relationship, so hopefully we can avoid that.  Something I am pretty confused about is the following: She brought up the theory that she is asexual to me, that the idea of penetration grosses her out, but then sometimes she'll be interested in sex. I'm getting a lot of mixed signals from this.  Also, I feel like I may have pressured her, I wanted her to do some things and I don't think she did, I stopped bringing it up but I feel it may have had effects.  I'm trying my best to be positive and learn more about asexuality but I'm a fairly sexual person and we started out that way as well."

asexuality,2thwit,lift-girl,3,Sun Jan 25 11:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yep. Also thought that sexual attraction was just plain attraction, I had no idea, like a lot of sexual people perhaps, that you could feel romantically toward someone and experience aesthetic attraction without the sexual stuff. I also thought, naively, that one day I'd grow into sexuality and my desire for sex would just arrive all of a sudden once I found someone I liked a lot. Did anyone else also believe for a very long time that everyone else felt attraction the same way as you? I certainly did. How very confusing that was."

asexuality,2teafv,mashwalker,5,Fri Jan 23 12:10:25 2015 UTC,"Asexuality is the inability to experience sexual attraction. Libido is your need for pleasuring yourself sexually. The two are completely unrelated. There are some asexuals who enjoy having sex, some that are indifferent, and some that are repulsed. It's even common for asexuals to become horny after watching porn or reading pornography, and masturbate. These things all depend on your personal libido.  The main point is that after looking at someone who you may find aesthetically appealing, there is no signal to your brain saying that. I want to do the sex with that. and triggering your bits. That is what all asexuals have in common (depending where you fall on the spectrum, the definition changes when introducing the prefixes of ""demi"" ""gray"" etc.). If you can agree that you at least have this trait, by definition you are asexual. However no one, and I repeat no one can label you other than yourself. If you find out that referring to yourself as asexual doesn't seem fitting then you are not obligated to stick with it. No one can label you but you."

The genital configuration that I developed causes me dysphoria, but in practice it's not the reason I don't do it.  I've had sex with a few different partners(again, because society made me curious and one trial isn't enough of a sample size). None of them have been able to make me orgasm or release, and presumably they knew what they were doing, so I'm assuming it's biological.

asexuality,2t7m9r,Sexaulbeing124,2,Wed Jan 21 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"Hello, Asexual aromantic here! I'll do my best to explain this as simply as possible! I'm going to break this up into parts.  1) What is the difference between romantic love of someone who is asexual, versus platonic love between heterosexuals? Well, for starters, you seem to know the difference between romantic love and platonic love already which is a lot more than I can say for most. My answer to this is that, if i'm understanding your question correctly, asexuals and heterosexuals can experience both equally. However, not everyone is comfortable in platonic relationships (many consider it to be a worse version of the ""friendzone"") but this has no bearing on your sexuality.  2) If she does not desire sexual intimacy, then what grounds is there for jealousy? Some people are more possessive than others. She most likely fears that you becoming intimate with someone else on a sexual level that her intimacy with you (which to her could be cuddling/wrestling/kissing if you guys do that/a plethora of other things) wont be as special. She wants to be your one and only, and she wants to know that she is adequate. She can provide romance, maybe other girls can provide sex AND romance. It's an ""I don't want to lose him to someone who'll do him"" kind of mentality.  Basically, she's scared. She wants you to just be happy with her, and she doesn't know what might happen if you become sexually intimate with someone else. There could possibly also be some deep rooted anxiety regarding not being good enough.  I hope this helped! Please feel free to ask me any questions if you need further insight!"

Number 4 describes the stereotype that asexuals do not want marriage or a relationship, which obviously has nothing to do with being asexual, but that it could translate into aromanticism. They stated it in a way that made it sound like aromantics fit this stereotype, which in most cases is true, however they didn't explicitly say ""marriage"" or a ""romantic relationship"", no they said ""you hate people and want to be alone the rest of your life"". People who don't understand asexuality DEFINITELY don't understand aromanticism, so why would they understand the implied point? They won't, and now this article is perpetuating stereotypes for aromantics because we have the capacity to crave human interaction as much as anyone else, many fear the fact that they will be alone for the rest of their life because they want platonic sexual or relationships versus romantic. This labels aromantics as socially repulsed sociopaths. This irks me on so many levels."

If you're reading along and feel moments of, ""Yeah, that's totally how I feel!"" when other people are describing their experiences, then maybe you are. But really it comes down to how you describe yourself.   I do think it would be valuable to recognize the difference between an emotional relationship and a romantic one. It's okay to have close male friends and not be romantically interested in them. Of course, it's okay to also have that romantic attraction, so really it's all case by case.   Long story short, most of us are still working out what we are and what we want. These things aren't simple to think about. And so maybe for you it's hard for you to separate whether you are asexual or whether you are anxious. That's probably the most normal thing in the world. Don't let it bother you. Cake is awesome.

Asexuals can also find people aesthetically attractive (like a work of art), but not sexually attractive (wanting to touch them in sexual ways).  Honestly, it's a varied and imperfect label. If you think the label of asexual fits you, then feel free to use it. And if at some point you think the label no longer fits, you're not obligated to continue to identify under it. But that's something only you can really decide. You can also go to the AVEN website for more information on asexuality.  Good luck in your journey!"

asexuality,2swln3,DefinitelyNotwafle,8,Mon Jan 19 20:47:26 2015 UTC,He's an anthropomorphized cartoon character. Sea sponges also don't actually live in pineapples or work as fry cooks. I really don't think  that the fact that sea sponges undergo asexual reproduction in real life necessitates that Spongebob be asexual in orientation. They are not the same thing.
asexuality,2swln3,NYPunk,2,Mon Jan 19 16:13:21 2015 UTC,"I really don't think they would have been referring to his sexual orientation.

asexuality,2swln3,seancellerobryan,3,Mon Jan 19 19:40:47 2015 UTC,Why not?  It was in the context of saying the character was not gay.  Seems like orientation to me.
asexuality,2swln3,NYPunk,0,Mon Jan 19 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think they were using ""asexual"" in the sense of not needing a partner in order to reproduce/being biologically capable of producing offspring by oneself.""

asexuality,2swln3,e4knee,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but SpongeBob has a mother and father so I would imagine the implication there is that they were both involved with the process of him coming into existence. Which, you know, it's a cartoon so no one is really thinking about the sexual history of an anthropomorphized sponge's parents when they create it and there's not really any ""prooving"" in a work of fiction.  Some believe the creator was being dualistic when he said that SpongeBob was asexual though, playing on the fact that sponges reproduce a-sexually and that SpongeBob doesn't appear to be in any sort of relationship, sexual or otherwise."
asexuality,2syrlf,acdc822,4,Mon Jan 19 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"It's most certainly possible to fill that void. You're not alone. However, our demographic is a small and oft misunderstood one. It will take effort to find someone who holds to a similar definition of a relationship. /u/Ellabelle797's recent post is a great living example of such possibility. I imagine such relationships have more going for them constructed on something beyond sex. We have a unique trait immunizing us from a compelling aspect of our biology and societal expectation; leverage that as a strength.  It's easy to think yourself into a rut because of the situation, but don't discount the love and understanding from your friends, family, even the Ace community. Be sad at times if you must, but do not dwell. Continue pursuit of your passions, make the most of the time you spend in the present, optimize your future, and opportunities will arise."
asexuality,2syrlf,Bare,2,Wed Jan 21 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"I haven't given up hope yet.  When I first accepted my asexuality, I grieved as well - I felt like less of a woman, less of a human being, and that I would never be able to feel 'complete' or truly happy.  Several years in, and I don't believe any of that anymore.  Like any grieving process, you'll go through stages and work through your feelings and thoughts.  I certainly can't make any predictions as to where you'll end up, but it's definitely possible to find someone to have a relationship with, especially with the ever-growing awareness of asexuality and social media."
asexuality,2syrlf,quill-de-vil,2,Wed Jan 21 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with your logic is that your premise is that no one would want to be in a relationship with you. Honestly, that's untrue. It might be likely that you've run into a handful of people who suck and maybe make it seem that way, but it's not. The world is a big place, and a lot of people are like you. Take it slow, enjoy life, and surely the right person will show up. It's awesome that you recognize yourself and who you are rather than pretend to be someone you're not just to be in a relationship. Once, I had a great friend who told me, ""Nothing ever doesn't work out."" I wholeheartedly believe that. So don't worry too much. Hakuna matata, right?"
asexuality,2swm1v,ABlindEye,7,Mon Jan 19 05:10:17 2015 UTC,"when I told him I didn't want premartial sex he seemed a little put off. Which is a little confusing for me, because he's never showed sexual desire, so why would it matter if there was a wait?    Two reasons- First you are talking marriage. That is something all guys (asexual or not) might be a little put off about. Second and more importantly saying that you didn't want premarital sex implies that you would want postmarital sex. Otherwise you would have simply said ""I don't want sex,"" with no qualifiers. He's considering what you would expect of him if you were married. Having kids does not require sex if that's how you choose to go about it.   My concern is that tolerance somehow translates to apathy. If he doesn't want sex, that's fine. But I don't want to be caught unaware and push him without knowing it.   That's fair. Also consider how much enjoyment he gets from just making you happy. For example. Picking up a bird with a salad tongs is not something I would enjoy. I'm completely apathetic to doing that. But look how much that sucker enjoys it! Now I really want to pick up that bird with tongs too. She looks so happy and I want to give her tong rides too.  Seeing an animal enjoy itself from something you are doing is pleasurable for you even when it would otherwise be meaningless. This is true when it's a human animal too."

asexuality,2su3as,AsexualityArchive,8,Sun Jan 18 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""allosexual"" has been the term in use pretty much everywhere except AVEN for a couple of years.  Not exactly sure why it hasn't caught on there. And I personally use ""non-asexual"", so I don't spend more time explaining jargon to outsiders than explaining asexuality."
asexuality,2su3as,0xFFE3,2,Sun Jan 18 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"I mostly just stick to non-asexual as well, since the root allo- means 'different', and so, well, on its own legs it's not terribly helpful or descriptive over non-asexual."
asexuality,2su3as,youksdpr,2,Sun Jan 18 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"Allo- has a few meanings other than ""different"". It's most common meaning is ""other"". I think that is the intent with the term allosexual is to mean other sexualities, not different."
asexuality,2su3as,SilenceLeRoman,3,Sun Jan 18 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"I always took allo to mean people who experience sexual attraction towards ""others."" It makes sense to me, and I like that it isn't specific about who those others are so it doesn't contradict previously established orientations."

asexuality,2su3as,0xFFE3,2,Sun Jan 18 20:42:25 2015 UTC,". . . 'other than what?' is the same question as 'different from what?'  By roots, the word means a similar thing to heterosexual, or, if we take the chemistry route, allo is an orthogonal but analogous thing to cis/trans, which is somewhat worse. (But extremely few people will make that association, so it's irrelevant).  Obviously words aren't ruled by their roots, but if we're creating language, I'd like to create precise language. You create whatever you want to create, I couldn't stop you if I wanted to, but I'll be over here mulling over better words until I come up with some."
asexuality,2su3as,03274196-8D44-11E4-9,12,Sun Jan 18 19:09:45 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing orientation with behavior. Sexual just means that they experience sexual attraction.
asexuality,2su69p,youksdpr,10,Sun Jan 18 16:03:47 2015 UTC,"Understand that boners (for males) are the body's natural response when preparing itself for sex. This does not mean that you are necessarily sexually attracted to other people, it just means that your body thought it was in a situation in which you were aroused and were about to have sex. This often happens when you have close contact with other people, which you have experienced. Just because you got a ""half-boner"" while dancing with your friend does not mean you cannot be ace, it just means your body is working properly. Don't worry so much about it."
asexuality,2su69p,TangerineGlobs,6,Sun Jan 18 16:49:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks. That made me feel a bunch better."
asexuality,2su69p,TangerineGlobs,3,Sun Jan 18 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"Not that anyone can tell you anything about anything you feel, but that second to last paragraph is sort of telling. If you like it, don't do it. And if you don't like it when people touch you, ask them not to. And just because you are ace and aromantic that doesn't mean you are broken. If I were to make a guess, I would say that you could probably have sex if you wanted to. So a half-boner isn't all that weird. Doesn't mean you have to like it. Doesn't mean you have to identify as anything else.   As far as what you might do about it, I might consider coming out to him if you haven't. Or telling him that just so everyone's on the same page you aren't interested. Or if you think you might actually be interested despite previous feelings, go for it. Does that make sense?"

I'm naturally shy, and I blush really easily, so that + being close to the aesthetically pleasing guy is hell. I'll even get hyperaware to the point of feeling that electricity thing.   This, however, doesn't mean that I want to have sex with the guy, not even get close enough to touch or anything, or even to date (since I'm aro). I just really like how they look.   This usually doesn't last very long either. As soon as I get to know them a bit, I it's gone, poof, no more.   As the poster above said, only you get to really decide how and what you felt.

asexuality,2stl0l,Kali711,3,Sun Jan 18 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"The aesthetic attraction thing seems interesting, but I sometimes have trouble telling what's aesthetically nice when it comes to people. Sometimes even supposedly good-looking people just look extremely ordinary to me. My photographer friend was pretty shocked when we met a very famous cosplayer last year and I wasn't even interested in how perfectly K-Pop idol she looked. :P  I kinda think it was a bit like what you described though, but it was more on a mental level? Like, I was really interested because he looked fun and nice, but I was embarrassed because of the shirtless-ness... And then when my friend actually wanted to talk to him and pushed me up to him, that feeling of wanting to get to know him just left.  Thank you very much for sharing that with me though. It's given me a bit to think about."
asexuality,2stl0l,Kali711,3,Sun Jan 18 23:11:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their type. What's aesthetically pleasing to you might not be for other ppl.   Friends will usually say/exclaim a guy is hot and I just don't see it. I mean yeah he is kinda good looking I guess but not as much as they are making it out to be.   But yes the pushing is the worst. Just cause you blush does not mean you like that person or you are lying! It's just cause it makes you uncomfortable, but apparently any reaction like that is immediately associated with romance/sex.   Glad it helped a bit though!"

My sister once called me boy crazy, which I thought was pretty hilarious. I often find myself in similar situations, yet when I study my feelings, I recognize that I don't want to have sex with these men. At most, I imagine myself hugging or cuddling with them."
asexuality,2stl0l,TangerineGlobs,3,Wed Jan 21 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"Not that anyone else is more qualified than yourself to describe what you feel, but to me anyway there is a difference between being attracted to a sex and wanting sex. Tons of aces consider themselves asexual but romantic towards one sex or the other, and that doesn't disqualify them from identifying as asexual. Sometimes it's hard when people don't understand what you feel as an asexual, in part because it's hard to understand those feelings yourself, at least for me anyway. On the other hand, if you feel like you need to reevaluate your feelings toward your sexuality, that's okay too, since the whole topic is fluid and subject to change anyway. Does that help?"
asexuality,2stl0l,TangerineGlobs,3,Sun Jan 18 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"A bit. Thank you! I'm still sure I'm asexual, but that was just such a weird moment in my life and it all happened so quickly that I have a hard time quite remembering exactly what I felt at the time.   But, maybe it was just an intense feeling of wanting to know him? He was being really nice and entertaining everyone, so maybe that's why I reacted like that. I'm not sure if there's such a thing as being intensely attracted to someone because you want to get to know them though...?"
asexuality,2stl0l,dreadpirateroberts67,2,Sun Jan 18 23:02:03 2015 UTC,"I think that your thought about wanting to get to know someone makes sense. It's also possible that your body is releasing chemicals because of its environment, which is a totally natural thing to happen, even if you find sex totally repulsive. Because nothing is stopping you from sex except your own aversion, it's possible that the body will prepare your physical state for it even though you know it's not going to happen. But this is all just speculation on my part. Really, I think it's more about how you feel and what you are going to do about it that matters, not some weird moment at an anime convention, right?"
asexuality,2st35p,lift-girl,8,Sun Jan 18 05:41:58 2015 UTC,I am an attractive female    I doubt most of those messaging you even read your profile. An asexual label isn't going to deter most guys on dating sites since they take a shotgun approach to it.

In general, because my ""sex questions"" are so different than most, I don't even bother responding to messages from people with whom I have less than 90% match. If we have that good of a match, it's because they are either asexual OR have a lower than average sex drive, which I could deal with.

You can however meet other asexuals and just ""chat"" with them on Asexualitic and then move on to another service like skype. It's not a bad idea to donate though to the site since it does cost money to keep up and running, so supporting them would kind of be a nice thing to do.  I hope this helps :)"

asexuality,2soxg8,throwingaway386,13,Sat Jan 17 05:10:08 2015 UTC,"personally, i think a lot of them mistake the feeling of 'being in love' with the feeling of 'fuck me, fuck me now'.   i think this because i can relate to the butteflies, constantly thinking of someone, wanting to hug someone, wanting to make them happy (i usually buy gifts or flowers or such) but i do not feel any other things they described. such as the wetness, electricity or.. those other strange things they write about."
asexuality,2soxg8,x-rainy,7,Sat Jan 17 13:58:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I think they're also mixing up arousal and attraction? I get aroused by touch or fantasizing, and plenty of guys talk about getting aroused for no reason. Doesn't necessarily mean attraction."
asexuality,2soxg8,throwingaway386,7,Sat Jan 17 19:31:14 2015 UTC,i guess it's understandable because for most of these people the feelings are intertwined and mutually inclusive. i think that's what makes all of these posts such interesting and helpful reads!

asexuality,2soxg8,baethan,8,Sat Jan 17 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"Dr Lindsay Doe has a video on her own experiences with Asexuality as an allosexual (sexual).  Her first story speaks of ""sexual sonar"" which is the idea that sexual attraction and sexuality in general is an energy that can be felt by others.  I understand this to an extend, I consider myself sexual in expression and asexual in orientation. But I don't believe it's a strong sense or a precise one, nor do I believe that every sexual person has it. I think some people are just more in tune with themselves (sexual or asexual) and they can share special moments and vibes with other people who are in tune.  Part of me thinks attraction (Sexual, Romantic and otherwise) can be felt, I was lying in bed with a friend that I am attracted to romantically and I could feel that strong pull that the sexual people in the askwomen thread speak of. In my mind I was consciously saying ""hug me, touch me, spoon me"", and soon after, he did. I felt the pull settle and relaxed into him and felt him relax into me. This seems to be an example of ""feeling someone else's attraction"" and subconscious response but it's too hard to tell, perhaps I was unknowingly drawing closer to him, perhaps I was giving off physical heat and he wanted to be closer to that, who knows."
asexuality,2soxg8,x-rainy,3,Sat Jan 17 05:35:09 2015 UTC,right? i'm a bit envious in the way that i'd like to feel those feelings at least once. some people describe them in such a poetic way it feels like asexuals are missing out on a lot when i read their posts. :(
asexuality,2soxg8,alimeisgreen,5,Sat Jan 17 13:56:45 2015 UTC,Reading that thread only confirmed to me that I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone. I am incredibly envious of the feeling that they describe.   I have felt the pull as they describe to be close to someone but there is nothing sexual about it. Sometimes I meet someone and I really want to be near them and talk to them.

asexuality,2spsxj,Hearshotkid32,16,Sat Jan 17 07:29:55 2015 UTC,"They're interested in you for a relationship. That relationship may not lead to sex. Is this a deal breaker for you?   It might lead to sex. If it does, they may or may not enjoy it, and may or may not be sexually attracted to you. Are you one of those people who needs their partner to want to have sex with them? A grey-a may never actually want sex, with you or anyone. Are you one of those people who gets off on pleasuring your partner? You might find that they're happy to have sex because it makes you feel good, not because they get anything out of it themselves.   Really, the only difference is that when you're discussing the boundaries around sex, they won't approach it from the standard ""I'm human and I want it, probably with you"" standpoint. This makes it REALLY important to talk about boundaries before doing anything."
asexuality,2spsxj,Kirielis,2,Sat Jan 17 08:44:33 2015 UTC,"This is a really important point. I'm a demisexual dating a gray ace and we've been together for a year and a half now. It's still a challenge for us to figure out how to meet my needs for sex/physical affection and his need for space.

asexuality,2spsxj,Kerowyn202,5,Sat Jan 17 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"Ask them what kind of ship they're interested in. Sex, no sex? Little bit of sex? No more then heavy foreplay? Marriage? Kids? How are they about kissing, making out? Take them on a walk and get into their heads. :)  Now they might be like me (asexual here) and have no real experience. My boy is a demi (rare sexual attraction and a low drive) and basically I've informed him that I might be ok with sex, might not, and I want a mate who doesn't just put up with me but is content with me being as I am. He's listened and thought on it and assured me as long as he gets kissing and cuddling and ect, that he'd be ok.  Communication, communication, and a side of communication."
asexuality,2spsxj,-Quinn,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:14:48 2015 UTC,"First off, non-asexual is as fine a term as any, although if you want to get fancy a lot of people use the term ""allosexual"".   Secondly, there's really no surefire way to approach a relationship with an ace person. Everybody's different. The most important thing is to communicate with them and find out what their boundaries are, and if those boundaries seem like they wouldn't allow you to be satisfied with the relationship then that's that.   Of course, boundaries can change over time. But there is no guarantee that they will change at all or in a way that you'll like."
asexuality,2spsxj,sharkcore,1 point,Sat Jan 17 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"The best approach is to communicate with this person; open discussion will spare you a lot of anxiety. Asexuality is a spectrum, and as such each individual will have their own quirks regarding sex and other particulars of a relationship. Establish (for yourself as well) your needs and expectations from a relationship, work to understand your potential mate's, and decide if some compromise will be necessary to build a healthy relationship that satisfies the both of you if that's the direction you opt to take."
asexuality,2spsxj,Bare,-2,Sat Jan 17 20:49:59 2015 UTC,"They say they are grey-asexual. That means, the more you get to know them, and the longer you stay with them, bonding, the more likely your relationship is to go further. The grey means that they are only likely to have sex with people they really like and know really well. I hope I helped."
asexuality,2spsxj,teddalego,10,Sat Jan 17 08:46:16 2015 UTC,"That's wrong. Grey-a is an umbrella term that covers a lot of different situations. This person might mean they only feel attraction sometimes, or that they only feel it under certain situations, or they only experience a portion of the sensations that compose sexual attraction, or several other things. You're confusing grey-asexual with demisexual, wherein a strong emotional bond is necessary but not sufficient for sexual attraction. A demisexual might identify as grey-a but not all grey-asexuals are demisexual.   OP, I have no experience with your kind of situation, but I would suggest you gently ask for specifics. Since you're already dating it's not weird to politely bring it up. With a term like grey-a only they know what exactly that means. Whatever they tell you, seriously soul-search and ask yourself if you could feel fulfilled with that situation in the long term - don't assume it'll ever change. They might not know what's going on themselves, since they feel differently about you than they've felt before, and their answer might change over time - please be patient with them and realize this isn't lying or wronging you; it's even more confusing for them."

asexuality,2sp1yp,Aberforthlikesgoats,3,Sat Jan 17 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"That sounds like if you think it's yes, it's yes. The grey zone is super accepting of different angles and it's relatively common for people within it to think to themselves ""oh, maybe I'm just shy"" or ""maybe I'm just repressed."" (definitely thoughts I have from time to time, and I don't really have a religious upbringing or abuse or an anxiety diagnosis to blame for that)  In the end all you have to go on is the empirical evidence: you aren't really bothering with this thing that seems to come naturally to other people, but you aren't physically unwell, and you don't seem frustrated about it. You can always frame a condition in pessimistic terms, but that can be an excuse to bottle it up in more internal rumination. If you go the other way and say that this is a fine way to feel, then you have to start questioning the rest of the (human) world and ask why it's assuming so much of you, which is scary in some ways but also potentially freeing and empowering."
asexuality,2sp1yp,3fox,2,Sat Jan 17 05:46:25 2015 UTC,"It's important to know that sexuality is fluid. For some people, a single term can't single handedly define them for their entire lives. For others, it can.    From the sound of it, it seems like you might be dealing with some strong sexual anxiety, and yes that is a real thing. I'm no doctor, but you might want to do a little bit of research on it.  I know it's cryptic, but at the end of the day you have to decide how to label yourself. The best advice I can give you is don't feel compelled to enter into a relationship or force yourself to have sex with anyone if you don't want to. There is a lot of societal pressure out there. Acknowledging that it exists while also acknowledging how little it actually matters is an important step in self discovery. I hope this helped. :)"

You'd have to do a whole hell of a lot of research to get anywhere on that subject. The problem is that ""sexual anxiety"" = ""performance anxiety"" which is very different from what OP is describing. You'd have to look through a lot of articles that are not relevant.  It's like looking for your old friend who used to live in London. He spoke German and had a last name of Blitz.

asexuality,2sp1yp,TotallyRandomNameYa,2,Sat Jan 17 08:00:50 2015 UTC,"Grey-ace is interesting because it can be hard to quantify the threshold between when you're allo and when you can considered grey.  It all comes down to what you want to call yourself. Do you feel very close to 'greysexual'? Does it just seem to fit? To be honest, I see this question a lot and what it really comes to is how you yourself want to identify and what makes you most comfortable. Also, remember that sexuality is fluid and it can change throughout your life. So if you want to call yourself grey for now, then go ahead."
asexuality,2spf1d,ohthatjennifer,6,Sat Jan 17 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"To address the title of your post, you should never feel the need to conform to what others think of you, regardless of the fact that dating is considered the social norm. Maybe you not dating doesn't make sense to them, but you should do what you feel comfortable with, not what they think you should be comfortable with (especially because it's entirely possible that them dating doesn't make sense to you, as it does with me).  To that end, and as part of the ""advice on how to deal/accept being single"", you shouldn't feel like it's something that you have to battle. If you want to date (or some alternative) someone, then you should...go out and try to find a person right for you, no matter how difficult that may be. If you don't (and it seems like you don't), whittle away your time with school and hobbies. Aside from seeing/hanging out with friends on a (semi-)regular basis, I bowl, watch TV/movies, read, and write during my free time. Sometimes the simple, solitary activities just fill up the time and make you forget that there's no tangible companion there, especially when enthralled with a good story.  Not dating also doesn't necessarily have to imply your asexuality (in reference to the point-of-view of your colleagues). You can simply do as I do and say that you're not interested in dating, that you're waiting to settle into your life first before trying to find someone (as a senior in college, this is a pretty legitimate excuse, considering that your priority should be landing a job [if you haven't already]), etc. You don't have to tell them you're asexual, just that you're not looking right now. If it persists, say that you're uncomfortable with them trying to hook you up and kindly ask them to stop (though you can say that you appreciate their effort, even if that's a white lie).  Also, relationship advice is (in my opinion) most interesting coming from a person who hasn't been in one because they can see the world without rose-tinted glasses. Two of my three best friends and I were trying to help the fourth member of our group see that his relationship was no good, and my brief dalliance with romance (followed by no dating in the last 5 years) really helped with a different perspective. Granted, I didn't say that my advice was better than my friend's (who was in a 5-year relationship by that point), but I think that being able to give ideas from both sides of the spectrum is important in making an informed decision. And after all was said and done, my friend took my advice and broke up with his girlfriend, and now he's much happier as a result."

That's probably because their personal image for their lives includes a family, house, and white picket fence (well, not specifically, but you know what I mean).   If your advice was ignored because you weren't viewed as a credible source due to your lack of experience in the dating field, then who's to say these people would have accepted it even if you had the experience? What qualifies as enough experience in this situation anyway? I mean, you were right, so obviously you know what you're talking about.  The best thing about your life is the fact that it's yours. I'm sure if they keep trying to pressure you into doing something like flirt or whatever and you don't respond then they'll eventually stop. Your friends are trying to get you to date and go out with people because they think it's what you want and you're too scared or anxious to go for it. Just make it known that that isn't what you want, or at least it's not something you're interested in doing right now. This doesn't mean you have to come out and say you're ace if you don't want to. Just let them know that right now, dating or whatever isn't something you feel like doing. If they're your friends, they'll understand. I hope this helped."
asexuality,2snhow,opiate-dreams,5,Fri Jan 16 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"Well I'm definitely more on the clingy side than most people, but for me, romantic attraction is like ""They're really cool and I love spending time with them and I would love to spend every second of the day with them because I like them so much but that's probably creepy, and we could cuddle and hold hands and watch Netflix and make stupid jokes until 3 in the morning. And every time I see them or text me I get really excited and my heart starts racing like I've got a medical condition."""
asexuality,2snhow,notbehindyoursofa,5,Fri Jan 16 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, I'm the opposite of clingy. Much more on the avoidance end of that spectrum. I definitely would not love to spend every second or even every minute or hour or even every day with any one given person. I'd feel suffocated without my own space. But that is probably part of why I find friendship hard in general - I need a lot of space and if I choose to be alone when there is an alternative, people read it as me not liking them, which is usually untrue; I'm just a loner and need my space. I'd like someone ideally who I can hang out with one or a couple of times a week, and have close emotional talks with, and be able to trust 100% without feeling like I'm going to be manipulated or like I have to put on an act or pretend to be a certain way so that they will like me. I don't like the 'cuddle and hold hands' part, but chilling together and watching Netflix together sounds like a good night in. I don't get the whole 'heart racing excitement' thing in general though, but I just really enjoy being around them and get jealous when they want to go/they have other, better friends than me. Basically I want the whole partnership thing but without the touching and stuff, I guess?"

asexuality,2snhow,seirianstar,2,Fri Jan 16 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"First, let's note that I'm in  the process of being diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome so that partially explains why I may appear socially unusual/not understanding of things/bad at explaining myself/socially awkward.  Okay, well, when I say 'I like you and want to get to know you more', that's me attempting to describe the closest thing I think I ever have to a 'crush'. It happened in school a handful of times, and then literally only once that I can remember since after I turned 18 (with that friend who I mentioned having my first and only kisses with).  But anyway, I'd called the experience a 'crush' because I had no other word for it. I would want the person in question to become friends with me, because I thought they seemed fascinating for some reason which I may or may not have been able to logically explain. I felt this mostly towards girls/women, but also more rarely towards boys (also probably more frequently around fictional characters or people in the media of any gender - as it's not a 'attraction' thing any more than wanting to become friends with that person). This 'feeling'  that I got was simply one of wanting to become close friends with a person or to learn more about them or something like that. It never involved any desire to kiss them or anything, and if I was gonna go and spend a day with them, my choice of activity would be to go to a theme park or something else fun and maybe a bit childish, or just hang out at a park and talk, or watch a film we both wanted to see. Anything that you'd do with a friend, with absolutely no intention of building 'sexual tension'. If a person tried to hold my hand or touch me, it would creep me out and I'd back away because I just want to be close but platonic.   But I guess that's part of the problem - my ideal, non-sexual, non-romantic 'relationship' seems most similar to being ""best friends"" in the way that little kids have ""best friends"". When adults have good friends, there's an unwritten understanding that the romantic/sexual partner comes first. But I want my 'life partner' to be like a ""best friend"" who I can share everything with and not be deserted by when they find someone better. I'd love to meet someone who felt the same sort of feelings as I do and would prioritise our relationship and not go and have romantic ones and sexual ones.  This was my attempt at explaining my idea of an aromantic 'relationship'. I'm getting kinda teary thinking about it now, because I know it'll likely never happen but the possibility of something like this even existing sounds way too perfect. None of the holding hands or kissing or hugging and dating and mind games and flirting - whatever that is, I don't know. i've always been told by friends that even around the people I claim to 'like', I don't ever flirt because I don't know what it is or how to and I don't want to imply that I want anything sexual -  and definitely none of that disgusting sex stuff.  And eh. I was using the example I used as it just came to mind immediately as a thing that I think is associated with romantic relationships. People in romantic relationships seem to enjoy going to candlelit dinners, and maybe candlelight is romantic. I don't know because I don't know what romance is. But yeah, I wouldn't want to have 'dates' - the idea of 'dates' is something I don't understand and that confuses me. Not sure what you mean by 'trappings'.   Basically I just feel like I don't know what 'romance' is.  I'm not trying to push a label on myself for the purposes of being able to label myself. I'm just trying to understand myself more, and I need words that describe how I feel about things, or a 'label' as you put it."
asexuality,2snhow,ExtraWingyScapula,2,Fri Jan 16 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"Platonic relationships do exist. You just need to communicate with partners about what you are looking for. ""I really like you and I'd like us to be exclusive but there are some things you should know about me. I'm asexual which means I don't want to engage in sexual activities. I'm also possibly aromantic, but it could be my aspergers, so I'm clueless when it comes to romance because that is a concept I don't understand. I'm averse to certain types of touch such as kissing and [whatever else makes you uncomfortable]. I just wanted to make sure you know this about me before things get any further so that there is no confusion down the line.""  Communication is key to any relationship. If someone isn't ok with the things you've said then they aren't the right person for you. It's better to say these things at the beginning than to wait and then for feelings to get hurt and the possibility of them thinking their time got wasted.   Even without romance you can still be deeply connected to someone emotionally and mentally and for some, even spiritually. Try to stay positive."
asexuality,2snhow,seirianstar,1 point,Sat Jan 17 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"Hah, I'm betting that doesn't go down well with most people. XD  Then again, I can't even make friends, never mind make a friend with relationship potential. I feel like the only way this could ever happen is if I knew prior to attempting it that they were also asexual/aromantic so that I wouldn't be disappointing them. I wouldn't wanna try and put someone into a relationship which was strongly lacking in things they desire, as that's what tends to lead to people cheating or breaking up, by looking for the things they desire elsewhere.  I'm bad at communication by any standards, which tbh makes me very glad I'm asexual. I can't imagine what it must be like to require sex but be a terrible communicator.   I'm not a spiritual person and I don't understand spirituality as a concept either; I just would love to be able to form a partnership which is basically 'best friends'.   As I've tried to explain; I don't understand how a relationship is the most important/only important thing in life for most people in society. Everywhere I look, everything seems to be cenered around relationships or how to get into one. Wheras I think it'd be very nice to experience, I by no means need one in order to live my life. I mean, I'm not particularly functional by any means and have whatever mental health issues I have, but tbh I'm pretty avoidant of people more than anything, and definitely don't 'require' a relationship in the way that most people appear to."

You say you don't want to try to put someone in a relationship which is lacking the things they desire, well the only way to do that is to be honest. Sounds to me like you are afraid. Don't be.  As far as you not needing a relationship, that's actually pretty great. Yes, our world is pretty relationship/sex centered but there have been some pretty cool people in this world that weren't tied down to anyone. One of them just happens to be a good friend of mine.   She has done all kinds of stuff without having a relationship or kids to tie her down. She's opened a womens health clinic. She's written a book. She's had a documentary made about her. She's become a wealthy real estate agent. She's traveled the world. She's had extravagant parties. She's acted in numerous plays. She's been a great friend and role model. She's an artist.

asexuality,2sma9z,udonchopstick,11,Fri Jan 16 11:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think the main difference is that relationships are generally exclusive. Sure, it's easy to talk to someone a few times and then see them on a regular basis. That's a pretty normal friendship. But to tell this person how you feel and have them express that they do want to be with you, even if it means no physical intimacy. A lot of the time, it won't be much different from having a close friendship, but that's not what you're after. What you want is someone you can definitely depend on for anything.   I guess it's hard to explain in words, but the important part of a relationship is the part where you ask for permission first. You find someone you like, tell them you want a relationship with them (in better words, of course), and let them decide whether or not that's what they want as well.   Friendships pretty much just happen. Relationships have to have work put into them."

And yes, you can get that with friends but in a deeply ""love"" relationship that level of trust and understanding can often run very deep. And for many folks sex isn't just about the lust and good physical feeling, it's also a way of expressing that intimacy. Physical nakedness is sort of the physical version of also exposing oneself emotionally.  For a good TED talk about being in love (well, only sort of related) I highly recommend Brene Brown:  The Power of Vulnerability  Great discussion topic btw!"

When i first(and last) time fell in love. For me in the end it's ""sharing the life"". I mean, i have a best friend, we have hobbies we engage together, occasionally go to bar to just relax, sometimes speak a whole night on skype on some common topic, but that is that. If i travel to another country tomorrow, nothing will really change. We'll just interact less. But with SO it's another story. It's about living together and supporting each other.

I've never had a crush, I never felt romantic attraction as far as I know. I love platonic friendships, snuggling, conversations at 3 in the morning, saying ""I love you"" and meaning it in the sincerest way possible. I consider my closest friends to be like my own little makeshift family, where they are all my brothers and sisters. I care deeply about my friends, some more than others, however as much as I want to be around them (crave their attention, being physically close such as cuddling and hugging, being there for them emotionally etc) I've never looked at someone romantically. I've been asked out, but I've never accepted because I feel like I'd be leading them on. The idea of hanging out seems wonderful, but the moment you call it ""dating"" I feel almost repulsed. If you asked me if that guy I just held hands with through the hallway was my boyfriend, I'd reject the idea completely. It makes me uncomfortable beyond belief when people romanticize my platonic friendships. That's how I know, personally, that I am aromantic.   So as for you? That's up to you to decide!

Asexuality only means not experiencing sexual attraction. From what I gather, sexual attraction = looking at someone and thinking ""I want to have sex with them/I would have sex with them if the opportunity arose/etc."" and feels like the beginnings of/a precursor to arousal. Asexuality doesn't necessarily mean someone doesn't ever have sex--some aces even really like sex for reasons other than experiencing sexual attraction, such as libido or as an expression of care for a partner. (Personally, I'm ace and have a fairly active sex drive, and fantasize a lot.) But then, some asexuals are completely disinterested in or repulsed by sex.   And if by ""gestures of love"" you mean stuff like hugging, kissing, holding hands, etc. then yeah, asexuality has no bearing on those. Some aces don't like to be touched like that, true... but the same is true for some allosexuals, too. Asexuality doesn't automatically mean ""disinterested in affection,"" though obviously it seems like this may be the case for your gf.  I guess the only advice I can think of to give is to ask her what her boundaries are. I think that's an important conversation to have."

But maybe the ring thing would be a good opener, you could say something about how she mentioned it & you've seen on the Internet that a black ring on middle finger is an asexual symbol, is she asexual? <- but in like a casual-ish, non-interrogative way.   Beyond that I think it's all going to be about communication. There's a possibility she might not be physically affectionate now because she feels uncomfortable with the connotation and where that is expected to lead. With communication that might become comfortable for her. Or it might not. Unfortunately this whole thing is going to be about whether you guys are able to/want to accept where each other is at."
asexuality,2sloh6,rainydayadventure,1 point,Sat Jan 17 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"She could well be going through a self-discovery process that's felt personal and that she was hesitant to share with you. I can't know exactly what she's feeling, but I can imagine not wanting to talk about my possible asexuality with someone. It's possible she's been scared that you'll reject her.  Some people still appreciate, and give, affectionate gestures while being asexual. Some asexuals crave romance and value romantic relationships. Others, like me, are aromantic, and don't really ""get"" romantic affection. I can't say where your girlfriend falls in that spectrum, and she may still be trying to figure that out herself.  If you want things out of a romantic relationship that she's not comfortable with, then maybe your relationship with her will need to change. If you care about her and accept her, then you might consider being a friend rather than a boyfriend. It's okay to prioritize yourself in that way. As a friend, though, you would need to assure her that you still care about her and she's still important to you.  Communicate your concerns, and listen to what she has to say. Be patient. Don't pressure her, either into action or into making an immediate determination about herself. Let her know that she has your support.  Things might not work out romantically, but with open, honest communication and support the two of you may well grow closer through her exploration, wherever it may take her."

I can honestly say that I'm finally feel comfortable in this identity at last. Sure, I firmly believe that sexuality is a fluid concept... But it's nice to belong to something you know?  Thank you for y'all thoughts! :D"
asexuality,2shv8j,kittydorkdork,2,Thu Jan 15 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Yeah, I think I get what you mean by feeling ""broken"". Growing up, whenever the inevitable ""So, any girls you crushing on?"" comes up in a conversation, I'd normally say ""No one at the moment"" and try to switch to another topic, despite the statement not being true - I've never crushed on anybody, ever. I used to be more honest back in highschool, but then it'd get into an awkward and vaguely condescending one-sided conversation oh how I was either lying or a stuck-up prude (neither of which are true).  Back on track, I also went through a ""maybe I'm gay?"" phase... I never came out to anyone either, though growing up with a strictly conservative, sectarian school did make me uncomfortable, though I think I did a fairly good job at hiding what I felt (that, and I made no lasting friendships there being the weird kid, heh).  Glad you feel comfortable in your identity! It's one of the greatest feelings to be cool with who you are, no?"

asexuality,2si2vs,TotallyRandomNameYa,7,Thu Jan 15 09:54:14 2015 UTC,"Lost the best relationship I've had yet as an ace to a combination of social drama on his side (long story) and being out of touch for over a month because of holidays. It was great because it wasn't serious, there were no big expectations, and he seemed to be totally at one with the way I am, it just worked out well. Nothing complicated, just good company and understanding. Some other shit happened. Was feeling very down. Then a stray kitten adopted me. I taught her to play fetch last night, she got it down in about ten minutes. She doesn't need a litterbox, I take her for little walks instead. She's adorable and cuddly and talkative and rather smart. Everything is better now. Only had her for three days, life has already significantly improved.  Something about her waking me up to go out at 5am, like my dog used to, makes me happy. Even though it's cold and dark and I have to bundle up, not to mention wee hours of the morning. I don't know why. Maybe it's that I've got something to take care of that's more involved than the usual cat, I can't not be happy about her while she spends five minutes sniffing around in the snow."

When I moved out, I had to part with them because my apartment complex doesn't accept animals :/  I hope one day I find another animal as cool as the one you have.

I friend of mine is pursuing a career in global business management. One of the incentives is that he is allowed to travel overseas to experience differentiating business environments.  If that doesn't sound interesting, maybe consider getting yourself to a point in your education in which you can return to later. Maybe you get an AA, travel, then come back later and finish your degree. There are a lot of options. We live in a culture now in which has tricked its youth into believing in the moment, spontaneous thinking is conformist and therefore correct. The sad truth is that more often than not that's not the case.  This is totally my opinion, but I think you should be smart and get yourself into a position where you are actually financially capable of making traveling decisions, if you are not so already.

asexuality,2sgljj,thousandtrees,9,Thu Jan 15 16:50:27 2015 UTC,Is Bilbo Baggins asexual? He doesn't seem to have any children or partner or anything. Same could be asked for his nephew Frodo.  I think you could interpret it that way but they're certainly not fleshed out in that regard.
asexuality,2sgljj,Malzair,6,Thu Jan 15 05:14:06 2015 UTC,"Huh, Bilbo's a good one! He really does seem to be asexual and aromantic from what we see. Frodo: who knows, there's always the subtext with Samwise."
asexuality,2sgljj,Malzair,3,Thu Jan 15 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"I always read the subtext with Samwise as a mentor thingy. In the books Frodo is 50 when they leave for Rivendell and Sam is his 38 year old gardener (I think the movies fucked that up, Sam looked older than Frodo) so I always felt like it's a mentor thing, Frodo and Bilbo educated him, taught him to read and write and Bilbo probably had some good stories to tell. To me that's just a good companionship.  Especially since Sam ends up with Rosie I don't feel like interpreting some homosexuality thingy in there. Then again he named his first son Frodo so there was definitely something special there but to me that's platonic.  Then again it's literature, you can interpret it that way, it would definitely make sense."
asexuality,2sgljj,BlueCalx1,3,Thu Jan 15 05:31:59 2015 UTC,"Frodo was older than Sam at the start of the series, and was 33 when he obtained the Ring. Since he had it for 17 years before the Council of Elrond and the founding of the Fellowship, he would still look the same as he did at 33 (there was talk of him not aging over the 17 year period) and since Sam, who didn't have the Ring, was 38 when the Council happened, it only makes sense that Sam would LOOK older even if he wasn't in terms of years."
asexuality,2sgljj,Malzair,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, that makes sense, right. Then they just cast Bilbo all wrong because he didn't look like 50 in the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit...  But thanks for that note. :)"
asexuality,2sgljj,SexSellsCoffee,4,Fri Jan 16 03:02:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I would refrain from attaching any kind of label to Bilbo since he had the ring in his possession for such a long time. The Ring corrupts all those who possess it. His lack of partners/children could be attributed to the Ring. For example, Gollum was corrupted to the point where he hung out in a shitty cavern by himself."
asexuality,2sgljj,Malzair,2,Thu Jan 15 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he was 50 when het set out on the journey during which he got the ring. What did he do before?

asexuality,2sgljj,BasilOfBakerStreet,4,Thu Jan 15 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, neat. Also it's a very short list, which is sad.  On the topic of Sherlock Holmes, kinda lame that his current incarnations ditched that aspect, then. edit: or maybe he still is on Sherlock and I'm misremembering."
asexuality,2sgljj,davros_mueller,5,Thu Jan 15 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"Moffat says he's not asexual, just abstaining. Nothing has been stated one way or the other in-show, though. Or maybe it has and it flew over my head, I dunno."
asexuality,2sgljj,BasilOfBakerStreet,3,Thu Jan 15 04:04:31 2015 UTC,"That's right. I want to provide the direct quotes for context.  Moffat's exact words:   There's no indication in the original stories that he was asexual or gay. He actually says he declines the attention of women because he doesn't want the distraction. What does that tell you about him? Straightforward deduction. He wouldn't be living with a man if he thought men were interesting.   [...]   It's the choice of a monk, not the choice of an asexual. If he was asexual, there would be no tension in that, no fun in that – it's someone who abstains who's interesting. There's no guarantee that he'll stay that way in the end – maybe he marries Mrs Hudson. I don't know!"
asexuality,2sgljj,BasilOfBakerStreet,3,Thu Jan 15 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"It's really kind of sad to think that the world doesn't see any way to have ""tension"" or ""fun"" without it being sexual. I've been reserving judgment on Moffat because I really like some of his work, but this isn't helping."
asexuality,2sgljj,vurpine,3,Thu Jan 15 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"-sigh- So I see this Moffat quote all the time, and I'm bothered by it - it's as if he's ""poisoning the well"" so to speak for people who HAVEN'T read the books yet.  (In particular, it bothers me because it seems like such a stretch, or twisting of the words, in order to come to that conclusion.)  Nor is he the only one to have read the series - so have I, and I make the claim Holmes in the original stories has never said anything like that.  Some direct quotes from the actual source material (I compiled this for a paper I had to do once):  From The Sign of the Four, upon first meeting Ms. Morstan:   ""What a very attractive woman!"" I exclaimed, turning to my companion.   He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping  eyelids. ""Is she?"" he said, languidly. ""I did not observe.""   ""You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!"" I cried.  ""There is something positively inhuman in you at times.""   He smiled gently. ""It is of the first importance,"" he said, ""not to  allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is  to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities  are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most  winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little  children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my  acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a  million upon the London poor.""   More Ms. Morstan:   ""I would not tell them too much,"" said Holmes. ""Women are never to be  entirely trusted,--not the best of them.""   I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. ""I shall be  back in an hour or two,"" I remarked.   The ubiquitous Scandal in Bohemia intro:   To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him  mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and  predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any  emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one  particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably  balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and  observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would  have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer  passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things  for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives  and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions  into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to  introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his  mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of  his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong  emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to  him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and  questionable memory.   And the reasoning by which he determines where Adler hid the goods:   Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own  secreting.   The equally ubiquitous ending of Scandal in Bohemia:   And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of  Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by  a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women,  but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene  Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the  honourable title of the woman.   The dashing Holmes after The Adventure of the Copper Breeches, dashing Watson's dreams:   As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my  disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she  had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the  head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met  with considerable success.   The finale of A Case of Identity - in which he decides there is no need for a woman to know the truth:   ""If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old  Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub,  and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is  as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the  world.""   And another line exposing the stereotypes often seen in this era:   Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. ""We  have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very  friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated  her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me,  but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.   The famous intro to his brother in The Greek Interpreter:   During my long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I  had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to his  own early life.  This reticence upon his part had increased the  somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon me, until sometimes I  found myself regarding him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain without  a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he was pre-eminent in  intelligence.  His aversion to women and his disinclination to form  new friendships were both typical of his unemotional character, but  not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his  own people.  I had come to believe that he was an orphan with no  relatives living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he began to  talk to me about his brother.   More of Watson's observations of Holmes and women, from The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez:   ""Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker!  Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her.""   I may have remarked before that Holmes had, when he liked, a  peculiarly ingratiating way with women, and that he very readily  established terms of confidence with them. In half the time which he  had named he had captured the housekeeper's goodwill, and was  chatting with her as if he had known her for years.   From The Adventure of the Second Stain, Holmes comments more on women:   ""And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the  woman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on  her nose--that proved to be the correct solution. How can you build  on such a quicksand? Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or  their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a  curling-tongs.""   The Valley of Death, Holmes remarks to Watson:   I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you  are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there  are few wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let  any man's spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead  body. Should I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife  with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a  housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her.   And this, from The Adventure of the Dying Detective:   The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to  interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem.  She was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and  courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the  sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent.    Dr. Sterndale's last stand, and Holmes' thoughts on the matter in The Adventure of the Devil's Foot:   ""There is  my story, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have  done as much yourself. At any rate, I am in your hands. You can take  what steps you like. As I have already said, there is no man living  who can fear death less than I do.""   . . .   ""I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved  had met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has  done. Who knows?""   Even more of Holmes' thoughts of women, in The Illustrious Client:   ""Who knows, Watson? Woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to  the male. Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller  offence might rankle.   The Adventure of the Lion's Mane, where Holmes himself is his own chronicler:   Women have  seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my  heart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all  the soft freshness of the downlands in her delicate colouring,  without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed.   . . .   She listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed  concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as  well as great beauty. Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as  a most complete and remarkable woman.   This is the complete collection of quotes in which Watson, Holmes, or someone else describes how Holmes acts/feels/etc. about women.  The way I compiled this list was by finding the Complete text, CTRL+F, ""wom"" (for woman/women), and read through all 524 occurrences to determine if they were a generalisation/observation/opinion on women.  It's absurd to say, or even imply, that Holmes might even be interested in women (in general, in that way), when time and again Holmes shows disinterest/aversion/distrust/dislike toward the entire sex.  If by some stroke of luck, Holmes does deem a woman remarkable, it is by how remarkable and how unlike the womanly stereotypes of the times they manage to be.  He does not appreciate them as so much as a woman, but rather despite being a woman."

I was specifically responding to this:   On the topic of Sherlock Holmes, kinda lame that his current incarnations ditched that aspect, then. edit: or maybe he still is on Sherlock and I'm misremembering.   So Moffat's verdict is relevant, to Moffat's own show.  EDIT: Would it be acceptable if I edited my earlier comment to be more specific? Say if I replace that first 'he's' with 'BBC Sherlock is', like so:   Moffat says BBC Sherlock is not asexual, just abstaining."

But even in the beginning of his quote he makes the claim ""There's no indication in the original stories that he was asexual or gay.""  Followed directly by, ""He actually says he declines the attention of women because he doesn't want the distraction.""  Now, maybe this second sentence is unrelated to the original stories - but I'd be hard pressed to believe that, since the proximity to ""original stories"" is too close.  I could, and would, accept that his creation is different.  But here's an instance where (as far as I can see), he's outright saying in the original stories there was no indication.  Even more, he's saying Holmes ""actually says"" something he never says.  EDIT: OOPS, I just realised I commented my army of quotes in reply to the wrong person!  It was supposed to be below the person with Moffat's direct quotes.  Still, Moffat's quote in that context looks like it's saying that the ""original"" Holmes was interested in women.

For example, Dave Willis wrote a comic called Shortpacked! in a scifi continuity and rebooted it in a more mundane setting in Dumbing of Age. The asexual character in SP! is a robot, which is a really bad narrative choice, but he did make it explicit as possible that she is asexual because she is an asexual person and not because she's a robot. And in Dumbing of Age she's a human being now named Carla and confirmed to still be ace. Not much focus yet, but I'm hopeful she'll get some juicy development in the future!   There's also two webcomics, Shades of A and Ignition Zero, that have asexual main characters, so they're probably better examples. Though I never got into them, personally, so they're not what I think of first.   The book The Bone People has an aro ace protagonist.

And of course I would never judge your life, or push a title onto you, I think maybe that's something to consider. Though you may (or may not) see stuffed animals also as an object of desire and romantic fulfillment, you are sex-opposed with humans which could classify as asexual. I guess a better question then would be if you're aromantic? You say you'd happily be the head-of-household and live a life with a woman. From what I hear this is possible, but not all asexuals are romantic, and those that aren't probably feel more comfortable living life on their own.  That being said, sure! I think there's a lot to think about, but as long as you know what you want I think there's a girl out there for you.

Because it is a real condition that causes people a lot of distress. i believe that if you can't accept that, you are Transphobic.  :/  And Objectophilia is NOT normal either.

It's the unhappiness caused by being transgender that's the problem. And the best reason for it being included as a diagnosis in the DSM at all is so that insurance companies will cover hormones or surgery.  On the subject of unusual fetishes: it's totally ok if hearing about some fetishes grosses you out! But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with that fetish, or the people who do it (as long as they're all consenting adults). I have friends who do some weird sex things, and just thinking about it makes me cringe and reach for the brain-bleach. But they're my friends, they're good people, and I will loudly defend their rights to keep on doing what makes them happy.

If you were with someone you cared about, it's possible you might find enjoyment out of being with them. But if you never do, that's also okay. I think the important thing is to both keep an open mind about it, but don't be afraid to put your foot down if you don't feel comfortable.  As for your second point, some aces don't bother coming out officially. Some people see it as no big deal, like you said. Me, I told my mom, my brother, and some friends. I'm fairly open about it if asked, but I'm not making an announcement. If you decide that you don't feel like telling anyone, you don't have to.

Sex and everything related to it weirded me out through my freshman year of college, when I finally got my (first) bf, and it took another year until I was comfortable having sex. But I enjoy it well enough now, even though I'm missing some emotion that he gets. Point being, it's perfectly possible that you could end up comfortable with it.

However, I'm also greyromantic at most, so I feel the same way about a romantic relationship. It becomes a bigger deal for most people who are interested in ""traditional"" relationships.  I don't think there's anything more wrong with not wanting to try sex than there is in not feeling sexual attraction to start with! There is no rule anywhere that says you have to/should try sex. Ever.   However, I view it as a kind of ""cross that bridge if I ever come to it,"" issue. If I am for some reason in a situation where I personally feel it's important to reevaluate ""the sex situation,"" I will. And not until.   As far as coming out, I don't have a lot of good insight. I haven't told my mom because we have never talked about sex ever in any context (we don't have the healthiest relationship) and I feel like it would be weird to be like ""hey you know that utterly taboo topic we never talk about or imply in any way? Yeah I've never wanted to do it with anyone anyway, so you're getting adopted grand kids. Just so ya know."" Lol"
asexuality,2s8cxk,HugoStigglitzs,4,Tue Jan 13 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"Firstly, welcome to our community!   Okay, so the way you're feeling right now? Yes, completely normal. Why? Because the lack of feeling sexual attraction is deemed taboo. Media, ads, social circumstances in general, all revolve around sex. The idea of someone considering themselves outside of that is strange, but of course it feels wonderful to finally feel like you have a whole community of people that shares your feelings, and will continue to validate and support you.  It's natural to be afraid to come out. It's often very difficult for asexuals because we identify with the lack of a feeling (much like how atheists are looked down upon for the lack of faith). Many people don't think asexuality is even a thing. I was told, ""Asexuality is only how plants reproduce, you're just bi with a low sex drive."" It's depressing when people go out of their way to invalidate you, and yes, it's common. But more and more people are started to become acquainted with sexuality tolerance and such, and you might be lucky and find yourself surrounded by very understanding people. You can refer to an earlier post I made, a guide to all the types of reactions I've gotten after coming out, the good and the bad."

""  This is how I feel now, after about two years of knowing I'm asexual. Sometimes I feel wrong because I'm so different from everyone I know in my real life. But most of the time I know it's just another variation of being alive, and being human. Some aces struggle with it for ages, and others accept it. For me it's mostly a matter of how my loved ones and the media deals with sex, and that influences how I feel about it. I tend to avoid sex-heavy media for that reason.  2) If you want to tell people, then tell them. But being out isn't something you HAVE to do. It's perfectly fine to keep it to yourself for as long as you like. What I did was not tell anyone for ages and ages, and really consolidated it in my own head first. Then I told people as it came up in conversation (e.g. ""wow isn't that person hot Hugo?"" and you say ""nah not really, I can't tell, I'm asexual""). But everyone is different, and you need to decide what you want to do - your safety and your comfort is most important. It's also perfectly cool to be out to some people and not others - it doesn't have to be an all or nothing thing.  3) Direct your therapist to resources since he's a bit confused. asexualityarchive.com is a good starting place. Also, Anthony Bogeart has written a whole bunch of scholarly research journal articles that your therapist should probably read. You shouldn't have to tell them everything (because it's their job to look stuff up), but if he's not treating it as something that needs to be 'fixed' then you're probably pretty good - even if he is confused."

asexuality,2s8cxk,mr_fishy,1 point,Tue Jan 13 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's perfectly normal for you to feel confused. I went through a pretty similar experience growing up. I felt like something was weird or wrong with me growing up, then I discovered the asexual identity and community and I felt a lot better, but not all at once. I still have days, a few years after coming out now, where I have down periods and I still get that uneasy feeling. That's totally normal.  I'm glad you have some support with your sister. In my experience, most therapists have never heard about asexuality and I actually had to educate mine about nearly everything there is with being ace. The research on it is still very, very new - the first peer-reviewed study on it was only published about a decade ago, so this is understandable (if unfortunate).  I think you should come out to people as you feel more comfortable. Coming out doesn't happen all at once, it's a process, and a lot of people start with those who they feel safer telling - people they know will be supportive, like your sister. If you think your friends will also be supportive, telling them might help you gain more confidence to tell your family; plus, they will be there for you if other people don't take the news so well.  Welcome to our family, and I hope that everything goes well for you! Don't ever be afraid to ask questions here, or get advice, or even just vent to people. We're all here for you!"

As you can see, my experience hasn't been like yours.  When I was young, though, the future felt terrifying in the sense that it felt like I had to make all of these huge, irreversible, and important decisions before I got the chance to know myself...but the truth is that you don't have to plan everything now. And you are likely going to change a lot over the next 10 years as you mature and accrue more experiences so that what you think you want now won't necessarily be what you want when you're 29. I don't doubt that you'll still identify as ace, but I think it's likely that you will become a lot more comfortable with yourself. I'm confident that you will. Especially as your/our generation becomes more enlightened. And as you meet more aces."

asexuality,2s2d9i,LittleLuthien,3,Sun Jan 11 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you do what feels comfortable to you - whatever that may be at the given time.  When I was in school, being the socially oblivious possible-aspergers-case that I am, I was pretty open about the fact that I thought sex was gross and I didn't think so-and-so was 'hot'. Needless to say, I was a laughing stock and hated high school. I'm a 22-year-old man now who by society's expectations should be a raging sexual animal. Still the thought disgusts me and I've never done it and don't particularly want to.   I've had what I thought were 'crushes' before, several times. I don't know what they actually were, but a 'crush' was the closest thing I had to relate the feeling to. Basically there were people who I felt some sense of admiration for and wanted to get to know better and I wanted for us to spend time together and for them to like me and for us to become good friends. I guess a sort of weird aromantic 'crush'? Haha.  I briefly had a sort-of-girlfriend... She was one of the people I'd had a 'crush' on, and we were already friends at the time and she knew that I was considering whether I may be asexual. I never know how to classify our 'relationship' because it's the only experience like that I've ever had, and I don't really know what 'romance' is about anyway. We were just friends who kissed and cuddled, really. Well, that's how it was to me. We'd had nights where I'd stayed at hers and we'd spent the night in bed together, lying close but clothed. I never felt pressure from her, but I knew all along that she had a sex drive. One night when we were lying in bed together, she suggested we 'get naked'. Naturally, I got freaked out and said that 'I'd rather not' and it felt very awkward. Not long after that night, I ended the 'thing' we had going, and resumed being 'just friends'. I dunno why but I just find anything more intimate than 'just friends' to be uncomfortable and probably wouldn't wanna do it. Kissing is okay for a bit, as are cuddles with the right person, but anything further than that does really gross me out just by thinking about it. So I wouldn't want to try and 'date' someone knowing that they were sexual ever again as it was just too awkward and we were on completely different wavelengths about the nature of our friendship. I feel really bad about it now, as she seemed to get quite excited by the idea of us being 'boyfriend and girlfriend' or 'partners' (I'm recalling a specific conversation that was awkward for me when she was asking what I wanted this friendship to develop into).   But tldr; I wouldn't try and form an asexual relationship with a sexual person because we end up wanting completely different things from it and it is just not comfortable however much you like the person.  Sorry I feel like I just rambled off on my story and anecdotes from my own life. I'm just wondering if it might be interesting or insightful somehow, given that I have the same lack of feelings as you seem to have and am a few years older with a teeny bit of experience. So yeah, I don't think you need to do anything. My situation formed mostly out of curiosity and wanting to experience what everyone else in the world seemed to think is the best thing in the world. But yeah it turned out that I found a 'relationship' too awkward, just as I predicted. I just hope we can manage to find some good platonic partners or something like that. I kinda hope that's a thing that exists. But hey, I don't even know any other asexuals in person.. :/"
asexuality,2s2d9i,opiate-dreams,2,Mon Jan 12 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"I would advise that you do nothing.  Not nothing in the sense that there's no hope; but nothing in the sense of accepting that you are your own person and don't actually owe anybody anything when it comes to your own choices.  I know that may seem unhelpful at your age what with typical high school drama going on but you can never truly win in the court of public opinion.  No matter what position you take, there will always be people who have something to say about it (especially in high school).  Not capitulating to irrational, teen social pressure combined with staying true to and defending yourself (and your asexuality) will I believe result in a happier, more carefree existence.  As long as you are comfortable with your asexuality there is no need to worry at all about other peoples opinions or judgements because the only thing that truly matters is how you feel about moving forward.  Stick to your principles, don't change for everyone.  They'll fall in line.  If they don't, their opinions already aren't under your control so you've lost nothing and (likely) gained peace of mind and personal understanding.

If you can create the watershed moment with something else, it might shock him into realising it.

You don't feel mature because your father is undermining your self confidence. Making you more vulnerable and seek his approval more. A vicious cycle. It doesn't have to be malicious or even something he's doing consciously. But it is all about the parent. He is used to the dynamic of you being a child and can't wrap his head around the fact you aren't ""his little girl"" anymore.  Maybe he would see you differently and more like an adult if you were married with kids. But that's entirely on him. He should be treating you as an adult. Your dad is the one missing a few steps and you are internalizing it. Make it clear to your father how you expect to be treated. He'll understand if he's a good father. (If he's not a good father, well then that's why things like /r/LifeAfterNarcissism exist.)  It's not an ace thing though as it affects lots of people. Here's a reddit story from 2 weeks ago of a woman with a boyfriend being treated like a child.

asexuality,2s1nc2,Noneerror,3,Mon Jan 12 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about it to be honest.  Parents have a natural bias to treat their children like children no matter their age.  I'm not actually sure what the problem is though?  Are you not able to talk to your parents about ""adult"" topics?  How does it typically go when you visit them?  As for your tastes, I say embrace them.  As children growing up we tend to internalise this idea of adulthood by using our closest role models as templates.  Typically parents who have had to become more ""adult"" (9-5 job, serious, hard working) are those role models.  As children we are constantly shown that example for most of the first 15 or so years of our lives.  We never really saw the hundreds of millions of other adults that are just like you right now with their ""childish"" habits.  Embrace who you are and don't let anybody make you doubt it by comparing yourself to ""normal"" (whatever that is, weird is more fun anyway!)."

It makes relationships easier to have sex, When dating an allosexual there is give and take. I take the post-coital cuddles and I give the sex. I tell people from day one sex will be few and far between, But I feel that no sex completely is unsporting of a good partner. I would be upset if my partner said ""no hugs ever"".  Its interesting you mention ""whore complex"" the last time I had sex it was with a guy that I was not attracted to what so ever, platonicaly, romanticly or sexually, But he was so nice and caring and I wanted to thank him for being a good sport, and because he was a sexual person I decided to thank him with sex. Turns out he has a bit of a humiliation kink. I don't like sex, But if you throw in a novelty like kinks and fetishes I can have a good time at least once.

As soon as they find out they're going to have a baby, they start daydreaming about how some day their little girl will be accepted to the best university, find the best husband, buy a house, enjoy babysitting the grandkids who are perfect little angels, and live happily ever after. When you don't live up to your parent's fantasy, they feel frustrated, disappointed, wonder if they did something wrong, and want to get you back on track. Sometimes I have to tell my Mom that following that path might be the key to happiness for some people, but it's just not for me or my sibling."

Sometimes they don't listen to logic and will try to justify themselves in any way they can. Obviously some parents don't do this, but a lot do to some degree.  When I came out as gay to my parents in high school, my mom went nuts. She's fine with gay people and is loving and accepting, but for a few months she tried everything she could to convince me that I liked girls and that I was deluding myself. Obviously that wasn't the case, but during those few months, nothing I said to her sunk in. It just fueled her anger at having the image of her perfect little boy forever shifted away from what she originally wanted for me. In time though, she calmed down and accepted me, and started listening to logic.   So, you may need to give it some time to sink in for your parents. If they aren't super morally opposed or anything and they are sane people, they'll probably come around and accept whatever it is that makes you happy. Hang in there!"

Nobody had ever told me it wasn't, but it sure wasn't ever addressed as an idea.  So I assumed that finding someone visually appealing is what other people meant when they said someone was hot. I assumed I was just slow to catch on when I heard friends whispering about blow jobs and someone told me what it meant.   Hormones took care of normal teenager stuff - i had boyfriends, we made out, etc. But sex never felt quite right.  No, I think that's always been me.

Overtime however, as I've come to understand sexuality better,  I've shifted from never having sex with someone I didn't love to I think I could have a FWB type relationship so long as we were of the same understanding.  (Not that the opportunity has ever presented itself...)  Which I guess is still sort of demisexual?

I think there are times when, say, a heteroromantic ace might not be a great fit for some conversations and attitudes, but definitely any sort of same-gender romantic attraction should obviously qualify for those discussions.   This is why I appreciate the term GSRM - aces are definitely a sexual and often romantic minority! The experiences of being ace definitely fall under a lot of the same umbrellas as other queer folks - not being accepted/understood by the larger community, not having their relationship styles socially or legally recognized, not being represented in media, etc. It's different in some ways, but I think solidarity is more important than squabbling over definitions.

There's corrective rape, there's ignorance, there's a lot of problems that actually do come from being ace, even if they're not as major/possibly life-threatening as being homosexual.

I'm arguing that identifying specifically as queer makes no sense if you aren't actively challenging normativity. People think that LGBTQIA+ = queer and its not. Just because you're LGBT+ doesn't mean you're /queer/.   You can't simultaneously blend in with society and identify as queer. At least in my opinion. It just doesn't really make sense. Its like saying that taking back femininity will challenge misogyny...it really doesn't as a whole... You can be feminine, but you're still participating in society's normative narrative. So you're not challenging anything. That was the entire purpose of the 90s wave of feminism that everyone knows as a feminist today: ""boyish,"" ""man hating,"" etc. They actively challenged society and were actively seeking to change it."

I've also noticed that books tend to do a better job at developing a character through a romantic subplot.  On the other hand, most movies are only about two hours long and auxiliary romance/sex almost always takes up time that would be better spent on plot and actual character development."
asexuality,2rs1rx,brbdogsonfire,1 point,Sun Jan 11 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, most of books the romance suddenly takes over and the plot/world is left off till the last 10% of the book. If I pick up a contemporary, I'm going to expect some kind of romance and for it to be the main thing probably. But a fantasy or scifi? Nooo."
asexuality,2rs1rx,brbdogsonfire,6,Sun Jan 11 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"I'm frustrated by both how it is glorified and how it is looked down on. It's really just a thing people do. And it can be awesome, or it can just be eh. Like most anything else that people do. And no one should be shamed for doing it or choosing not to."
asexuality,2rs1rx,OrangeredValkyrie,3,Thu Jan 8 22:23:58 2015 UTC,I completely agree. The only difference between sex and every other activity is sometimes sex is hard to get. Big deal.
asexuality,2rs1rx,OrangeredValkyrie,7,Thu Jan 8 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"I get frustrated when sex is seen as the be all and end all of romantic relationships in fiction, tbh. Like my OTP literally declared their love for each other and road off into the sunset, and people still get mad when I say that their relationship was romantic, because the didn't have sex."
asexuality,2rs1rx,OrangeredValkyrie,2,Fri Jan 9 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"I have never understood why people think you can't have a close personal romantic relationship without it. People did back when having sex before marriage was more of a scandal than it is now, why would relationships be any different?"

asexuality,2rskyi,fluffyphysics,10,Thu Jan 8 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do more with aromantics than with asexuals, since it's connecting romantic love with hate.   As for me, yeah I've always known I don't have the 'full range' of emotions. Yeah I can feel sad and cry, and get frustrated, maybe even angry, but it takes a lot to get that kind of reaction out of me. For most things I'm just indifferent or it wouldn't bother me much either way. But the extreme emotions are kinda foreign to me? I've never really been able to use the word hate because it's just too strong of a reaction to something. Dislike, sure. Hate, not so much."
asexuality,2rskyi,Kali711,1 point,Thu Jan 8 23:35:46 2015 UTC,"You sound very much like me, emotionally, so thanks for the reply. I'm wondering if this may be more coincidental though after seeing the other comments below.  Also I'm not sure they would use ""romantic"" in the same way we would, it's not a strictly defined term for the rest of the world, so I don't think it needs to be limited to aroms here."
asexuality,2rskyi,Kali711,1 point,Fri Jan 9 10:17:39 2015 UTC,"Huh, yeah, just saw the comments. Guess not then? Lol.   They were just trying to draw a parallel between hate and that obsessive kind of passion. How both can lead to horrible crimes. Hate crimes and crimes of passion. I guess both reactions might come from the same place just that one is negative and the other considered 'positive'. But if you are getting to the point of that kind of reaction I don't see how that's positive at all."
asexuality,2rskyi,Sad_man_life,1 point,Fri Jan 9 12:43:20 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right. I am romantic, but i have experienced the feeling only once, to the person i had extremely deep connection on all levels, and the moment i was dumped was probably the only time i was extremely sad, crying sad. Jealous to her new partner. Other than that time i would call my emotions ""dull"". It's like i can get happy, i can get sad, but never to the extreme. No explosive anger, no jumping joy i see all the time around."
asexuality,2rskyi,lift-girl,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:49:49 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I am the same! It takes quite a lot to get me angry, sad, etc. I will get frustrated, a little sad, things like that, but hardly ever full blown emotions.  While everyone is crying in a theatre over a movie or a play, I'll sit there and think: ""It's sad...but do you have to cry?""  I can count on one hand the times in my life I've really experienced a ""full"" emotion. I think when my ex was toying with me or when I was on the verge of losing a good friend to drama were the last times I really got very upset.   Everyone says I'm pretty chill. Takes a lot to get me angry. Sometimes I have to fake it when I teach! (I still never yell though)"
asexuality,2rskyi,Kali711,1 point,Sat Jan 10 11:43:15 2015 UTC,"Ha fake it xD. I have to fake showing overly touchy feely stuff with friends. It seems almost needy to me that they are so over the top like that. Idk if it's just like a fad or if they are actually like that. Always with the hugging, I loves yous, etc.   When I was a little kid I used to be a huge crier though. Any little remark or critic towards me, even if it was supposed to be as a joke, I'd take it to heart and end up crying lol.   I still take things a little too seriously now (but they way I see it is, they said it for a reason), but at least I don't cry xD"
asexuality,2rskyi,NateExMachina,4,Sat Jan 10 12:30:39 2015 UTC,"This is also true of people who suffer from depression. Depression isn't sadness per se, it's when all your passion goes away. It's a feeling of numbness or paralyzing hopelessness. Depression is also known to kill the sex drive.  But asexuals who do not feel love/anger are different from depressed people. Asexuals may feel indifferent, instead of that deep emptiness. Many asexuals also feel passionate but simply don't care for sex. It's hard to make a connection. I think there is one but it's a bit complicated."
asexuality,2rskyi,davros_mueller,3,Fri Jan 9 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I definitely have the potential for anger. I've found it to be connected to keeping secrets personally - when I came out as asexual, sudden drop-off in anger. When I came out as a man, sudden drop-off in anger. Probably a stress thing, as keeping secrets really stresses me out.  Hate, not so much, but again, in my case I'd attribute that to circumstance. I've had a rough life, and nothing I've encountered since has been comparable, nothing has really been hate-able by comparison. Not the best way to go about releasing negative emotions, but I'll take it. Silver lining and all."
asexuality,2rskyi,YoungFolks,2,Fri Jan 9 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"I get angry. I get irritated, pissed off, annoyed. I experience jealousy and envy and even hate. I also experience love, just not romantic love. I'm not to sure about this study. It seems pretty shaky to me."

Like yeah I thought I must be straight because I sometimes watch straight porn and find it hot, but the thought of actually being in that situation seems awkward as hell and pretty darn gross, if I'm honest. Anyone who knows other stuff about me would most likely pin the cause of it on social anxiety/posssible aspergers/being transgender, and who knows - maybe it is or isn't. I don't care though, I just do what I enjoy and don't even get into situations which could lead to sex, because I think I subconsciously avoid them. :P  ((anytime you wanna chat, it's cool with me - I love internet talking even though I hate irl talking XD ))"

He's pretty darn sexually and romantically attracted to me. I'm just really  romantically attracted to him, and that is enough for me.  We've been together for a little over two years now, but I only came out a few months ago.  He actually took it very well. He didn't really understand it at first and was kind of confused, but he's naturally really open minded. So he was really willing to learn what is and isn't true for aces in general and also for me specifically.   It's long distance, so we actually almost never see each other in person. We skype almost every night. We have gotten plane tickets to each other a couple of times. I'm not sex-repulsed so it happens when we see each other. It's an enjoyable activity, but I'm not going to ever go chasing after it. My favourite part is honestly his smile. Seeing him so happy is a better feeling than any orgasm. I love it so much.  I honestly just believe I'm really, really lucky. Most people don't do well in long distance relationships. Most Aces I've personally met have not had success in dating anyone allosexual.

However she has not been able to have an emotional bond with them. So here came along me and we just clicked instantly. We started dating and it turns out both me and her have never felt so happy. In a sense it's a one-sided open relation ship? (I am guy in case you are wondering.) So in the end our relation ship is more emotional than anything else really.

asexuality,2rp577,Ellie_Bracha,6,Thu Jan 8 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"Minus the religious part, I went through exactly what you did. I was told that everyone falls in love, and gets married. That the ultimate happiness is finding the one person you want to spend your life with, romantically and sexually. I had friends back in kindergarten who kissed boys, called them their boyfriends. I didn't think anything of it. When my older sister started dating it started to become more real in a sense. I told myself that I wouldn't date until High school, but not because I wanted to impress my parents or anything, but because I thought that was when it just happened. Everyone dates in high school, right? Well, I was wrong, because I never had a crush, never felt attraction. The most I ever felt was strong platonic love. A lot of people denote me to just being someone who was never asked out, however, I was, on several occasions, but I felt like I was leading them on if I were to agree. I was told to just ""go for it"" but I felt in my heart there must have been more to it than that. My mom confided in me that ""It's okay if I'm lesbian"" regardless of how many times I corrected her.   Finishing up high school now, I've come to accept that I am Asexual Aromantic. And I can be proud of that. I have no desire for romantic or sexual relationships, I've never felt attraction. At most I like cuddling, being close to people. But there isn't much emotion other than platonic behind it.   To me, you sound like you could pass for asexual aromantic, but in the end it's up to you. And remember, no one can label you but you, and labels can change, you aren't confined to one label forever. Labels don't define us, we define the labels."
asexuality,2rp577,youksdpr,3,Thu Jan 8 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"I am not going to give you much of a definitive answer. It is definitely possible you are ace, but that is up to you to decide. Also remember sexuality can be fluid. So if you identify as ace now, but figure out you are straight or gay later, that is perfectly fine.   As for you're title, I have heard of people having that same thought process. There was this thread on here a little while ago. So it is pretty common for some aces to go through that thought process."
asexuality,2rpqci,Swyntax,5,Thu Jan 8 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"Not wanting to or not liking it, that's fairly common.  Many aces don't have sex, don't masturbate or don't really like orgasms.  Physically not being able to, though, that could be a sign of something else.  If you feel this is an issue and you've tried multiple ways and nothing works (and especially if you've never ejaculated, even when asleep), then you might want to talk to a doctor about it.    Asexuality doesn't affect genital function, it just affects what you might be interested in doing with them."

Right now, you have no desire to have sex with either gender. That's enough for you, right now, to label yourself as asexual. There's nothing to be ashamed of, you can't not be asexual because you are too young. Sexuality is fluid, and who knows? Maybe you will be allosexual one day.  But today, you are asexual.

You can use whatever label seems most appropriate for you right now, and if at some point in the future that label doesn't fit anymore, you can stop using it. That doesn't mean you were wrong to use that label in the past. People change over time, and orientation can be fluid."

asexuality,2royuk,highoctaneselfdenial,3,Thu Jan 8 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first comment. You're going to have to figure out whether or not the absence of sex is worth accepting. She's asexual and you're not. That's kind of a big deal. If you two can't come to a happy and healthy balance despite your differences, there will be long-term complications. You love her, so try to imagine yourself in her shoes. She probably doesn't want to sever your preferred way of expressing love. She probably feels the same way as you do, just from a different perspective.   I believe you should think about it long and hard. If you can't picture yourself putting her needs/wants over yours, or her putting your needs/wants first, your sex life (or lack thereof) will be miserable and assumably so, it will bleed into your relationship. Ending it will save you guys from future heartbreak."

I knew about her asexuality going into the relationship but I figured because I loved her I could deal with it. Having said that though it can be extremely frustrating that she is uncomfortable with even simple things like cuddling, especially since if it weren't for this one thing she would be perfect for me.   At the end of the day you have to choose, how she feels won't change and you have to decide if your relationship is worth the pain that you feel. Personally I am going to stick it out with her but it may be different for you, it doesn't make you a bad person if you decide you can't handle it this is a very difficult thing to deal with and seems to be a very common problem asexual relationships face.  Whatever you choose good luck and I wish you the best"

It's gonna be especially strong/random during puberty.   What would make you asexual is if you're not sexually attracted to anyone. If the arousal is aimless bodily reaction, sexual attraction is aimed arousal. So, do you get aroused when looking at or thinking about anyone?"
asexuality,2roy7x,YoungFolks,2,Fri Jan 9 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Sexual arousal happens to asexuals. It's often just part of having a body.

asexuality,2rizbz,SARARARARARARARARA,19,Tue Jan 6 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"To start off this comment, I'm sorry that you're having a tough time with your asexuality and your potential partner's lack of acceptance. He gave off an interest and eventually left. I find myself experiencing the same thing when I tell people about my lack of sexual desire. They tell me that they ""don't mind"" it, they're willing to see past it, and everything else but I believe that they just say those things in order to give me temporary comfort/feelings of acceptance. Or because they don't know what they're getting themselves into lol  Perhaps that's what you're going through right now? Or maybe not. But what matters the most is that if he doesn't want to be with you, he's one less person that wants you to compromise your sex drive. The dating market for the average person seems hard enough as it is, but don't give up hope. There are still plenty of people that can relate exactly to what you're feeling and looking for. As for OkCupid and practically every other dating and non dating website, there will be fair shares of creeps, arrogant folks, or just flat-out clueless people who don't care about preferences, orientations, sexualities, etc. They'll be selfish and think that they're special enough to change anybody they want for their own benefit. Best thing to do is ignore them. Or report them if you have to... -.- ... As much as they think that they're beasts in bed, they're only desperate losers if they have to use excuses, lies, or anything disrespectful to pressure someone to have sex with them. If they don't take your absolute no for an answer, they're not worth an ounce of your consideration.   Anyways, have you heard of Ace-book? It's a social networking and dating site with intentions made for it to be like Facebook that caters to asexuals. It's pretty nice there. The users are very friendly and welcoming. :)"

asexuality,2rizbz,Noneerror,16,Tue Jan 6 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"It could be that when you told him that he honestly believed that yes he could accept it and cope. When it came down to it, he found he couldn't. It's like how many people really truly believe they can have a long distance relationship and make it work. When they actually try they learn something new about themselves and that they can't do it.  Asexuals can get into the reverse of this. Where they believe they can have sex to make their partner happy. And in the short term it works. In the long term they just can't do it to find a balance where they both are happy. It becomes more of a problem until something breaks.  It's not dishonest. It's just not true.  As for men on OKCupid... that's just how guys have to date. Throw the net wide as possible and get rejected 99% of the time. Of those the vast majority of women aren't even close to compatible so why did he even try? The answer is that last 1%. Note I'm not defending it. I hate it. But it's the way 'the game' is played. It's just like spam. Everyone knows there's no Nigerian prince waiting to give you money. The reality is enough people do not know to make sending out the spam worth it."

It's a really disappointing and frustrating thing to lose friends over and over again like that. I've been there.

But we're married and we're happy. Well, I am. I don't presume to speak for him, but he seems happy as far as I can tell. Sex is a bit of an issue. Particularly because other people don't seem to understand and see it as a problem. We've kind of embraced a polyamorist lifestyle, because he is sexual and he's not getting all of his needs met. And I am decidedly repulsed by sex and sex is frequently painful, so he has to have sex with other women (and it's surprisingly hard to find women willing to have extra-marital affairs when the wife (a) knows and (b) doesn't mind).  I think the point of what I'm trying to say is don't give up. There are enormous piles of morons out there, but there are decent men as well."

It feels akin to the desire for mental stimulation.  But I do not expect others to understand me easily because I defy easy explanation - I'm far too complex to be boiled down in such a way.  Even my asexuality is highly nuanced.  Were I gay, I wouldn't automatically expect someone to understand that hypothetical homosexuality. Knowing me, it, too, would be nuanced.  I do not expect others to understand me (let alone accept me) because I have spent countless hours understanding myself, and it would take them just as long to reach my level of understanding of myself. It is a huge time investment to reach any semblance of understanding with someone in any deeply meaningful way.  If I could describe something as complex as my sexual preferences and outlooks with a single sentence, then I would be one hell of a boring person... or I would be expecting something unreasonable from people's understanding. It would be a supreme act of impatience on my behalf to ask people to understand and accept me more efficiently than I've been able to form my identity through the travail of ages.  edit But, yes, it would be nice if people asked more questions and said ""oh, tell me about that.""  But, fundamentally, I do not own their curiosity.  I only own myself, and, thus, how I transact myself; I choose to transact more with curious people and less with incurious people - but I still recognize that I own no one's curiosity but my own (and even my own curiosity has a mind of it's own sometimes)."

However, I'm asking you a question, as if I was unaware of that distinction, so that you can flesh out that distinction for yourself... or I can spell it out for you:  Acceptance requires understanding.  But understanding does not require acceptance.  Understanding is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for acceptance.  Without understanding, choosing to accept is, quite literally, meaningless.  Without [shared] meaning - communication becomes meaningless.  The reason my questions were vague is because I'm not looking for instances, instead, I'm looking for principles. (not just your mother, not just your ex, but all people, and all understandings)   I don't know what it's like to be attracted to women, but I accept that some of my friends are and don't try to convince them that they just haven't found the right guy yet.   Yes, but you understand the concept of attraction and can extrapolate it to some degree. The degree to which you can understand is the degree to which you can accept.  ...

I tend to have the same experience in mixed relationships as you did, down to the anxiety and the talk.  This is not a perfect solution because it narrows your options somewhat, but as another somewhat sex-repulsed ace with a low libido, I go out of my way to look for people with low sex drives who also put a low priority on sex. Other aces are ideal, so I check OkCupid for the keyword ""asexual"" and message people in that search if they seem interesting to me, but some people don't like to advertise, so I also take a chance on people who match well with me because I marked the answer ""a few times a month or less"" very important.

Categories and labels such as ""asexual"" exist to help approximate and therefore simplify a state of being that would otherwise not be so straightforward to explain to another.  From your description above, I think it sounds as if you fit into the asexual spectrum - but if you don't think you fit there, then that's okay. Maybe the category that best describes you hasn't been solidified yet. Remember, there was a time when asexuality wasn't a thing, but it doesn't mean that there weren't people who felt this way - it just means that they didn't have a word with which to explain themselves yet, and because of this, many of them just tried to shoe-horn themselves into categories where they really didn't entirely fit.  Don't make that same mistake. Learn what asexuality means to the people who live it, and then if you don't feel that that's what you are, set out to find a better more accurate description of who you feel you are inside - and if someone else hasn't made a category that you feel you fit entirely into, then don't be afraid to create one for yourself."

I have watched porn and used it as other use it. I have even enjoyed sex but I don't feel sexual attraction to others and that's the key part of being asexual.

asexuality,2rh8tr,ace_detective,2,Tue Jan 6 06:53:31 2015 UTC,"Not exactly literally, but I would definitely just ""meditate"" on it and look into it. It took me some time to identify as asexual because there are so many different kinds of people who are asexual who all have different experiences in life and there's not too much out there. But identity labels are for you to choose and the reason to choose them are personal and completely up to your discretion. I completely understand wanting the reassurance of not being ""kicked out"" of a group you feel you relate to and looking for that by asking things like that, but it really is all up to you. I would try to look for other people's stories on how they felt and why they identify as asexual and just see if it sounds like you can relate/if it feels like an answer to something you felt you didn't get in your life. A lot of my process in both asexuality and transgender were that it felt like it filled in holes in my life and helped me understand myself and my perspective on other people that nothing else filled.   For example, with asexuality, it answered why for the times in my life when I thought others were just faking having crushed on people/finding people hot and talking about it just to fit it. A part of me felt like I missed a memo and just went with it while a part of me just knew that there was something else going on, but I didn't have the answer.  What matters is that it helps you. It isn't a box to fit yourself in or something to make you who you will be by defining you, an identity label is a means to becoming more true to yourself by feeling less alone and having easy access to resources that help you find a language that can help you describe yourself to others. The crutch of language is that we do have to find those words before we can express ourselves and sometimes before we can even fully understand ourselves."
asexuality,2rh8tr,GeoCosmos,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:33:50 2015 UTC,"Hi, dude.  None of us can say whether you're ace or not, but I can share my experience with you, and hearing about how other ace people look at sex, relationships, etc. helped me a lot when I was figuring out who I am.  Since you say you've had a lot of consideration, I'm assuming you're at least somewhat familiar with the vocabulary I'm about to use - if I'm wrong, tell me, I'll be glad to clarify.    I'm 19, female, also a virgin.  I identify as straight but grey-asexual.  I'm attracted to guys, too.  I would very much like a boyfriend.  I'm interested in dating, holding hands, touchy feely snuggly cuddly stuff.  I haven't tried it, but I like the idea of kissing, making out.    As far as sex goes, I don't particularly know how I feel.  I like the idea of sex, as far as being another form of physical intimacy, an emotional act shared with a significant other.  The nitty gritty of it though, I'm sort of iffy about.  When I get to that point with a boyfriend, it's something we're going to have to play by ear a bit and go slow so I can figure out where my lines are.  Like you, I've also watched porn, read literotica, etc.  I've had the same sort of experience with the build up being significantly more appealing than the actual sex part.    I actually figured out that I'm on the ace spectrum during a particularly embarrassing game of truth or dare, when I was dared to come up with a sexual fantasy for each of the other people in the game.  That didn't end too well - my made up fantasies for them were significantly more general and emotional and build up based than what they wanted, and eventually one of my other friends took over.  What she came up with was. . . more hardcore than I'm comfortable saying or thinking about my friends.  So one last note for what's up with me - I identify as grey-asexual, not asexual.  I do that because I haven't experienced anything that I've recognized as sexual attraction, but I feel like some day I might, like some day demisexual may fit me better.  Other people use it as that they only experience sexual attraction very weakly, not strongly enough to act on.  Others use it as only experiencing sexual attraction occasionally.  Basically, it can be as simple as feeling like you don't fit in as an allosexual, you feel like the asexual community is something you can identify with, but you're not comfortable with using the flat-out asexual label.  So yeah.  I hope this helps you.  I hope that my story tells you something about you, whether it's ""that sounds exactly like me,"" or ""that makes zero sense to me,"" or ""some of that makes sense, but there are parts that don't.""  You may want to look into demisexuality or grey asexuality if you haven't already.  And remember, these labels?  They're just words.  You can modify them however you want, and if they become more stressful than helpful, there's always the option to say ""screw it, I'm me, and that's what that means."""

asexuality,2rh6m4,privthrowaway,2,Tue Jan 6 03:44:53 2015 UTC,No. Precisely because of what he says at the end about how it ties people together. I like my alone time and my autonomy. Marriage would completely suffocate me.

Or he doesn't stop to think about the amanormativity that he's spouting all over the joint. Or both.  A lot of people think marriages are great, a lot of people think marriages are not great. They work for some but not for others. Both viewpoints are correct.  Just because it's the best decision he's ever made, doesn't mean it's the best decision for everyone else. And to think that way is short sighted.  (Disclaimer, I'm not sure exactly what Hank says in the video, because I didn't watch it.

asexuality,2rgr8n,gray_c,6,Tue Jan 6 01:33:44 2015 UTC,"You bring up a lot of interesting points about society.  However, asexuality is not a ""choice"", it's about not experiencing sexual attraction rather than having it and choosing to repress it.  The categories of ""people who choose not to have sex"" and ""asexuals (people who do not experience sexual attraction)"" are certainly overlapping, but neither fully encompasses the other.  You have an interesting brain. I think you might enjoy reading about the concepts of amatanormativity and compulsory sexuality. Links from pianycist's blog, but googling those terms should come up with some more results. :)"
asexuality,2rgr8n,kalari-,7,Tue Jan 6 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"Re: 'Is there such a thing?', three questions:  Does anyone question a heterosexual man not being attracted to men?  Does anyone question a homosexual man not being attracted to women?  Why is not being attracted to anyone any different?  Chastity or celibacy or abstinence or just not dating, or whatever else, is not the same as asexuality. Asexuals absolutely can choose to abstain for whatever reason, but not everyone who abstains is asexual, and not all asexuals abstain.  Sexuality is how you feel, not what you do. A gay man who only has sex with women is still gay. A bisexual person who abstains is still bi. An asexual person who has sex is still asexual."
asexuality,2rgr8n,davros_mueller,-1,Tue Jan 6 02:37:25 2015 UTC,"Once again, sorry if I seem ignorant to anyone: I just don't quite understand. I am accepting of everyone as they are, but currently still see it somewhat differently. We prefer to label people as simply being this or that, but I think that it's more complex than that. Let me explain: generally people seem to believe that they are simply born being of one sexual orientation or the other, but the empirical data seems to imply otherwise. A good example of this would be Spartan society where all males were homosexuals and females lesbians to a point where heteronormative behavior was being ridiculed. To claim that they were all simply born that way would be illogical. Yet, isn't that what we are saying with all sexual orientations?   Furthermore, I have observed that fetishes seem to develop at an early age when people learn to associate a certain thing with sex/affection. People then usually build their sexuality and a part of their personality around that fetish, further making it a part of who they are and how they perceive it. I am not that deeply familiarized with neurology yet, but from what I've read repetitive behavior enforces neurological bonds and creates a new associative connections. This would put a great emphasis on how those first sex -related neurological bonds develop and how a person would behave on it, potentially enforcing and building further upon these neural connections. This would also mean that a person exerts a certain amount of control on how their sexuality develops. This seems to be confirmed by amount of homosexuals that have learned to identify as bisexual. Perhaps it might not be possible for the human brain to completely erase old sex -related neurological links while it might be possible to build new ones. Hence, I see asexuality as very peculiar thing and wish to understand it better. Either way all this strongly suggests that development of human sexuality depends a lot on our environment: social, cultural, technological and economic. Asexuality or even heterosexuality would be no exceptions. Asexuality was recognized in the 90's, so it's too early to draw any definite conclusions, but socio-economic changes in our society, for example, could explain it.  At least in theory asexual person could be a person whose sex related neural pathways are underdeveloped and who would not seek to 'develop' them due to external and internal factors involved. For all I know at the moment this kind of development process might not be possible for all. Perhaps it's also related to biochemical balance and psychological tendencies. I myself am hopeful that human sexuality and brain are more flexible than is commonly believed. Surely there must be people in here who have gradually stopped identifying as asexual?   PS. I'm not implying that there's anything wrong with being one way or the other. I just find it important to recognize whether a person can, if he or she so desires, to gradually change themselves as they may desire."
asexuality,2rgr8n,davros_mueller,4,Tue Jan 6 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"""sexuality and how people express their sexuality is affected by environmental and cultural factors"" is not the same thing as ""people are capable of changing their sexuality"" nor is it the same thing as ""those environmental and cultural factors have a cause-and-effect relationship that would be logical to a 21st century American""  I have no respect for your beliefs because you've obviously based them on a tiny amount of research (if you've done any and aren't just relying on anecdotes you've picked up from elsewhere) and lots of self-centered thinking, instead of researching how different people actually talk and think about their sexuality, how sexuality has changed throughout history, and anything at all about how sexuality works in a biological sense.  For example, you fail to consider the empirical evidence that prenatal factors can affect sexuality (e.g. fraternal birth order, digit ratio)."
asexuality,2ra7co,wobblingline,27,Sun Jan 4 07:17:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, first of all, breathe.  I'm going to start at the end of your post okay?     Should I ask her to get back together with me again and try to make it work?   That's up to you to decide, but my vote is for no.  You said you broke up because of   communication/trust issues that we'd tried again and again to resolve and kept failing at   and that you   desperately needed a break from each other.   You don't seem like you were happy with her.  No matter how perfect you were for each other, it was a relationship that seems to have been causing you stress and pain.  It hurts like hell to have lost her, but you removed each other from your lives for a reason.  Getting back together now, or even when the no-contact period is over is putting yourself back in a situation that doesn't actively improve your life.  Going backwards in your post a bit more:   I've always secretly been terrified of never finding a deep lifelong love because I'm ace.   Let me tell you a secret.  Something I haven't admitted to any of my friends who know I'm ace:  I'm scared of the exact same thing.  It's not unique to aces, though.  My best friend in high school thought he could never find someone to grow a family with him because he's gay.  My bi friend was scared she wouldn't be able to find someone to accept she's had a relationship with a woman before.  Heterosexual, allosexual friends of mine have are scared they won't find someone who will love them because of X, Y, and Z.  That's a completely normal fear to have.  It's also one that gets amplified right after a breakup.  You're dealing with losing someone who understood you so incredibly well, and it can be hard to deal with that.  And it can be hard to think that there will be someone else who'll get you like that.  Also, you say that   the usual platitudes of, ""Don't worry, you'll find someone else,"" don't really apply in this case.   But they do.  You will find someone else.  There are so many people on this planet that it can't be possible that your ex is the only person who actually matches you well.  It'll take time, and it'll take putting yourself out there, and it may hurt some of the time, but it'll happen.  It'll all come together eventually.  My advice to you for right now:  Take some time for yourself.  Figure out what went wrong, what you can do to keep it from happening again.  Make yourself better.  Make yourself so damn fantastic that your ex doesn't even deserve you!  Work on your self image, work on reaching out, making new friends, finding new people for the sake of just finding people, not necessarily for finding a new relationship yet.  Just go out and find you and have fun, and show yourself that you don't need your ex to be happy.  I really do hope that this helps.  You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.  ~internet hugs~"

asexuality,2ragaw,Leviathan666,3,Sun Jan 4 10:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that your body has simply lost its sex drive due to your age. I thought I was a perfectly normal straight guy (with an admittedly lower sex drive than most) all throughout high school, but as I started growing out of my teenage hormonal phase, my sex drive and sexual attraction slowly dwindled down to near-nothing, and I've only just come to terms with that a few months ago.  Idk how old you are, but there are a few key milestones in life where your body experiences steady declines in sexual activity (most notably, your early 20's, mid-30s, and a smaller one in your late 50's, with hormone spikes usually happening the few years prior to that). If you were in your teens or late 20's before your sexual activity came to a screeching halt, it might be your body sort of settling down, in which case expect this to be the norm for the next 10 years or so before you suddenly feel like your old self again."

Except in his case it's all of what makes sex enjoyable for him. You have a kind of chicken and egg situation going. You both will be happy if the other is happy. One of you just needs to start up the cycle.  Here is an idea: One of you give the other a massage. Have the recipient be completely passive with no reciprocation that day. Communicate during and be as sexual or not-sexual as you are both are comfortable with. Another day when you've both had a chance to sleep on it and reflect, switch roles and do the same thing again. Don't make it about sex, sex is ancillary. Just both of you focus on the pleasure of one person at a time and see where it takes you."

asexuality,2r597c,one-over-137-ce,2,Fri Jan 2 22:46:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds normal to me. I usually find that I'm very cagey about telling people I know that I'm asexual. However, I can pinpoint a few times where I was in a conversation with a stranger or an acquaintance and I casually dropped the ace-bomb because it happened to be relevant to what we were talking about. Oddly enough, those situations were a hell of a lot easier than telling my best friend of ten years or my siblings. So in answer to your question: I'd say it's not weird at all.  Although, what I do want to say in regards to your specific situation is that I normally shy away from using asexuality as an excuse to [not] tell someone I'm not interested. I don't think I'm aromantic, so it doesn't feel 100% truthful for me to say ""I'm not interested in you because I'm asexual"" unless the other person is clearly after a hookup rather than a relationship. That being said, I sometimes might say something along the lines of, ""I'm asexual if that makes you feel any better,"" but only after doing the respectful thing of being 100% truthful and telling them explicitly that I'm not interested in them romantically because I'm not interested in them romantically (or whatever other reason). But of course, disclosing your asexuality is up to you, and someone asking you out does not give them the privilege to know that information if you don't want to tell them."

asexuality,2r597c,e4knee,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:27:28 2015 UTC,"""When to tell people"" is something different for every ace, it seems. It's entirely up to you and your comfort level in regards to talking about things and what asexuality is to you.  I personally choose to attempt to simultaneously ignore the concepts of ""being closeted about asexuality"" and ""coming out as asexual"" to varying degrees of success. So in theory, I mention it any time it becomes relevant in conversation, but I don't go out of my way to talk about it. Idea is that if someone wants to know more explicitly about it, they'll ask. It's going pretty well, I'd say, and it's allowed me to figure out that one of my friends is aro -- though sometimes it can be hard to avoid the feeling that I'm ""coming out,"" particularly when in the company of better-than-other-friends friends who already know me pretty well save that detail.  That's just me, though.  There is no ""rule,"" save maybe for in the context of relationships and even then it's a little hazy. In that case, the other person should probably know sooner or later, it's just a matter of when to tell them. I'm still figuring that one out for myself -- it's easy enough if you're asked out, because then you can tell the other person right away sort of like ""take it or leave it."" Recently, though, I experimented with being the initiator and that was tricky, because I didn't want to drive the other person off but also didn't want to wait too long and find out that I'm wasting their time. They ended up coming out to me as gay at the same time that I came out to them as asexual on the third date. That was amusing."

While I don't think my asexuality has changed my gender identity, it did cause me to question gender roles at an early age. I'm female and grew up in a religious community where women are taught that their only divine role in the world is having children. Being asexual, the thought of being confined to that and only that for the rest of eternity was terrifying. So while it didn't change me, I do identify as a girl,  I also reject the notion of gender stereotypes. Liking or disliking certain activities in my mind shouldn't be related to gender identity at all.

I have romantic feelings, but uh... they feel normal, even though I don't feel sexual attraction.    But I think that's true even of most sexuals.  Do you feel romantic feelings towards everyone you're attracted to?  \2. It does to some.  Marriage doesn't appeal to me, but I don't think that's because I'm asexual.  But, again, I don't think that's uniquely asexual.  Marriage appeals to some folks and not to others.  \3. Uh... I don't think I understand the question.  I guess I'm more of a 'girly man', but, again, I don't think that really has to do with my asexuality.  There are plenty of heterosexual men who aren't 'manly men', and there are plenty of homosexual men who are.  Yeah, so hope that helped."
asexuality,2r3xen,alicevirgo,2,Thu Jan 8 06:52:53 2015 UTC,"These are my personal responses to the questions as someone who identifies as asexual, not responses that I think represent the asexual community as a whole (because I don't think those kinds of responses would necessarily be possible).    1.) I experience pretty powerful romantic attraction which usually comes without sexual attraction, but not always. /u/youksdpr describes it well when talking about crushes. Sometimes I feel like it's as if I have been married to this person for many decades, and the physical, sexual attraction is no longer part of our relationship, and certainly not what keeps us together. I know this isn't true for all older relationships but the emotional and mental social bond is very important to me. I mean, people experience sexual attraction without romantic attraction all the time. So it's the same idea, I think.   2.) Personally, marriage doesn't really matter to me, but I have felt that way long before I explored my asexuality. I personally am not that interested in marriage/kids, mostly because I fear that I will not be able to find the right partner for it (that's a whole different rodeo, though), but I'm not sure how much that is really related to my asexuality.  3.) I am female and my gender expression varies from day to day. If I'm feeling like it I am very femme, and sometimes very flirty; sometimes I'm not feeling that way. I don't think it has anything to do with my sexuality.   It can be helpful if you just think of sexual attraction, romantic (or even aesthetic) attraction, gender expression, and gender identity as independent things. It seems like your ideas about stereotypical gender-related behaviors and expressions are deeply rooted in the gender roles narrative that is not necessarily nature-based. Lots and lots of gay men are not feminine in any way, and to say that gay men tend to be feminine and that it's manly to play sports, or whatever, can be harmful."
asexuality,2r3xen,one-over-137-ce,2,Fri Jan 2 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I've known plenty of asexuals that have felt romance for others and then there's asexuals like myself that also happen to be aromantic. I can't speak for my romantic asexual friends, but it seems like attraction to personality plays a bigger factor. I do know of a couple of married asexuals. I think as long as both partners understand each other it can work. I am an asexual male and the only ""manly"" thing I do is groom and maintain my beard. I don't care for most of the other gender roles and often my gender feels more in the grey. Gender isn't something I take time thinking about though. I think it's good enough that I'm just me."
asexuality,2r3xen,-redsash-,2,Fri Jan 2 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"I think there has to be a distinction here. Sexual attraction != physical attraction. I'm personally biromantic, and usually attracted to people who present themselves as androgynous, but there's still no sexual attraction. Not currently for me, but if I have a long time partner who would like to get married I don't see a reason not to do it. Gender here is more distinct for me due to culture rather than asexuality. I'm a female, and being born outside of North America, I feel as if people here are more attached to traditional gender stereotypes. There were a lot of girls in my high school who, if they were North American, would be seen as ""masculine"" or at least less feminine, and so were the boys. There's also no distinction between gender and sex. Additionally, my dad believed that his daughters have to be independent women for things that we could easily do ourselves, like changing the car tires or fixing a dent in the wall, so that we don't have to depend on men in the future."
asexuality,2r3xen,numl0ck1s0n,2,Fri Jan 2 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"20/m ace here   This has been answered pretty well. I'm a romantic asexual, but there are also aromantic asexuals. This video from an asexual vlog just about sums up what romance feels like for me -- that is to say probably very similar to the ""standard"" romantic experience. I guess the difference would arise in the lack of any sexual feelings; so it feels like more of a conscious decision, but still a little bit impulsive -- impulsive in the way described in the video. It [marriage] certainly does [appeal to certain asexuals]. I'm very indifferent to my future plans in that regard, but I could definitely see myself getting married if I found someone I really connected with. The only main reason why I would want a relationship is something along the lines of: ""I'm building an elite two-person team to take on the world, and I'm looking for a second."" Marriage, as a shared commitment between two people, is completely compatible with that viewpoint. Just like with sexuals, this depends on who you ask. I certainly don't think there's any correlation whatsoever. For instance, I'm a cisgendered man and very proud of my masculinity. I also happen to do stereotypically ""manly"" things: I'm a 6'4"" athlete, I work out, I can be very competitive, I'm in a STEM field, I drink my coffee black, I bottle up my emotions in unhealthy ways, [I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay,] etc.. There's so much more to being a man than sex, just like there's so much more to being passionate or confident than sex. If anything, asexuality has made me a much more confident and passionate person (and therefore ""more of a manly man,"" if you want to indulge the stereotypes) in the sense that I'm much more in tune with who I am and what I want than I was before I identified as ace. If, for instance, I want to be the initiator and ask a girl out, I can do that without feeling like I'm lying to myself about something.   All that being said, though, I do strongly consider myself a feminist and am much more comfortable having platonic female friends than most other guys, but that probably has more to do with being raised in a politically progressive female-dominated household than with my asexuality.  Thank you for asking about individual experiences; asexuality probably has the most person-to-person variance of any sexual orientation just because of how many ways in which it can manifest, and I think sometimes people have the most trouble grasping that than the overall concept of ""no sexual attraction."" I think it's probably very difficult to fully understand the community without knowing different individual sorts of aces."
asexuality,2r3xen,Malzair,2,Fri Jan 2 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"Some have romantic feelings, some don't; I recall reading it was about 50-50 in one survey. For me I'm pretty sure I do have romantic feelings, at least as far as mild crushes/infatuation. Regarding the physical element I guess I feel platonic forms of romance much more, and perhaps this facilitates feelings for people of both sexes (not that such a thing is impossible without asexuality by any means, but I think that the difference between male and female attraction is smaller than for sexual people).    Again, it probably varies with 'romanticness' as well as other attitudes. I'm probably romantic and kind of traditional so for me at least its compelling.      This is kind of difficult. I do think that male and female asexuals (all other things equal) are more alike than men sexually attracted to women and women sexually attracted to men. Also, I guess I was free from the pressure to conform to gender roles in order to seem more eligible, and was repelled from some attributes simply because of their association with 'sex symbols'  Personally I also think that asexuality makes gender somewhat irrelevant, in that its not defined by your sex nor that of whom you're attracted to. In so far as gender arises out of sex-based biological differences focused around reproduction, asexuality provides an escape IMO."

I, for example, am heteroromantic, feeling romantic attraction to the opposite sex, however some of us are aromantic; not feeling romantic attraction, some are homoromantic, feeling romantic attraction to the opposite sex, and some of us are panromantic, feeling romantic attraction to all sexes.  2: Again, it depends. For me, it absolutely does, however for some, especially aromantics, the need for a parnter in life does ot appeal to them.  3: For me... I can't really say.

asexuality,2r3xen,Oceylot,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"Personally...   While not all asexual people have romantic feelings, I do. The difference I guess is that appearance doesn't really have much to do with it. I definitely appreciate a guy who keeps himself together and presents himself well, but I'm not concerned at all with how sexy a guy is or anything like that. I just want to spend time with him and cuddle all the time. I'm into the idea of marriage. I like the thought of making a promise to stay together forever, and I love the idea of having a ceremony with my friends and getting all dressed up. I've always been kind of a tomboy for most of my life. I've only just recently (like within the last three years or so - I'm 26 now) started wearing dresses and skirts and things like that. But I don't wear make-up or do my nails or anything like that. I still don't consider myself a girly girl, and every once in a while I go through phases where I feel more comfortable wearing boy's jeans and baggy t-shirts. But I like looking cute sometimes :)"

Eh, I think gender identities are overly emphasized in this day and age, but if I had to pick from the current spectrum I'd identify as androgynous - but it's easier to present as female and more aesthetically successful.  But I'm still sorting through all the hows and whys and am concerned it might be my upbringing.  I do a lot of art and design stuff, like make-up, hate cooking, and am learning car repair."

I don't really notice a lack of physical attraction. For me when I look at people it's just kinda like ""oh, a person"". I tend to notice hair and eye colors first thing though...and often find myself judging people on their outfits, which makes me feel pretty terrible, but eh.    I'm actually married and I love my husband for his intelligence, patience and consideration of other's feelings. He also has a pretty great sense of humor lol at least to me. So idk. The things about his personality just really drew me to him, we had been friends for a long time and of course it was an instant bond or instant emotional attraction, it was just something that built up the more I got to know him. I've never really once thought much about his appearance. As horrible as it is I do have to actually take a few minutes to really think about how he looks 'cause I just don't pay that much attention. I could go on and on about all the things I love about him and none of them would be physical traits.    Of course that varies. I am married, but I never actually thought it'd ever happen to me. It was just something that I was like ""meh, if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, oh well"". I don't want kids, so there really wasn't a point to want it. It just kinda happened. The marriage part, we don't have kids and neither of us wants them. I'm female...and being asexual really doesn't effect how I see my gender. I've never liked make up or dresses, but there's plenty of girls who are just not into that stuff, so I'm just another ""tom boy"" I guess, as opposed to being a ""girly girl"". I prefer to just go by being female, that's just what I am lol I just like what I like because I just do. I love animals, which is apparently a female thing, I like art and music. I hate children, I have no motherly instincts (found that out when my mother in law gave birth to her 4th kid). So yea...I guess I am and am not a stereotypical female.    I do happen to be an asexual who is sex repulsed, but I guess it's uncommon for girls to be sex crazy anyway, but I have been told I'm broken and can't be human, so there's that. Even so, I still consider myself both female and human lol"
asexuality,2r3ucy,mrstillunsure,7,Fri Jan 2 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"Being asexual only has, to my knowledge, one criteria: do you experience sexual attraction?  What sexual attraction is is rather hard to explain, and having never experienced it I had a hard time understanding it at first. Since I know I can't explain it that well, I'll refer to the AVEN wiki for a rather basic definition:   Sexual attraction is a feeling that sexual people get that causes them to desire sexual contact with a specific other person. It is often, but not always, felt along with other forms of attraction - i.e. sometimes a person experiencing sexual attraction will only want sex, such as some friends with benefits relationships, and other times they will desire sex as well as romantic interaction or other things.   Ignore your fetishes, ignore being aroused, ignore everything else - are you ever sexually attracted to people? Is the answer is no, or very rarely? Then yes - you're either asexual or on the asexual spectrum. Welcome."
asexuality,2r3ucy,IaiLwM,3,Fri Jan 2 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'm very similar to you and I identify with asexual. If you don't experience sexual attraction, or the desire to have sex, then you're ace!   Do you experience romantic attraction? Or just desire to have a family (and skip the whole romantic and dating part)? If you experience romantic attraction (you like to do romantic things, i.e. hand holding, cuddling, romantic gestures) then you could be heteroromantic asexual which is also definitely a thing."
asexuality,2r3ucy,werdunloaded,2,Fri Jan 2 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think everyone else has covered most of your questions, but I would like to address the family question; wanting a family is not connected to your sexuality. People of all sexual orientations can desire/not desire a family. I would also argue that people of any romantic orientation can. I am at most greyromantic, possibly aromantic, and I want to adopt children. I have a fairly strong maternal instinct (although no desire to give birth to children.) Having a ""family"" (albeit a rather nontraditional one) is one of my biggest goals. I wouldn't factor it into deciding your sexuality.   Another thing I would touch on is that you are not here to fit a label; the label is here to work for you. If you feel comfortable identifying as asexual for the time being, do. It doesn't have to be permanent if you discover a more fitting one, and it certainly should never influence your behavior to better fit the label. It doesn't dictate who you are, but it might help you understand it a little better."
asexuality,2r3ucy,rainydayadventure,2,Sat Jan 3 15:09:38 2015 UTC,"Here's the important distinction between arousal and attraction. Arousal is there because all your life, that's what you've been told. It's an instinctive reaction to experience arousal when viewing stereotypically ""sexy"" images--female bodies, for instance. Arousal has nothing to do with how you feel emotionally towards the image in question. Attraction, on the other hand, is a really large term. In the sense of sexual attraction, it is a mental connection to whatever you're looking at or thinking about. It's a little voice that says, ""It feels right to do this. This is what my heart desires."" Arousal is typically a strictly physical sensation, whereas attraction appeals to all aspects of your being."
asexuality,2r3ucy,melanellie,1 point,Sun Jan 4 06:28:55 2015 UTC,"There are roughly five kinds of human attraction.  Sexual, romantic, platonic, aesthetic, and sensual.  People who are allosexual (and therefore don't usually spend a lot of thought on this) often lump sexual and romantic together, and closely associate them with aesthetic and sensual attraction in adults.  (Aesthetic and sensual attraction are hardly acknowledged at all really.)  It's entirely possible that the nude woman thing is an aesthetic attraction because everything else you describe is highly asexual behavior.  Autochorissexualism may be another term you might want to explore.  It's a paraphilia that basically represents enjoying watching or fantasizing about other people having sex (real or fictional) but having no desire to participate yourself.    As far as the porn watching itself, asexual libibos fluctuate and come in high- and low-strength varieties just like allosexual libidos.  What defines asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction towards other people, not the degree of horniness you personally experience.  Some asexual people view porn with almost scientific curiosity- as something that's fascinating rather than a fantasy.  Lastly, many asexual people desire long-term romantic or platonic partners with whom they can share their lives and even a raise a family.  It doesn't invalidate asexuality to have those desires.  And many of them do eventually find partners who mesh with them.  It's just that much scarier to go looking because of this thing out there about us that isn't going to be what most people expect.  Lastly, to repurpose something helpful I was once told about trans people- people who are straight don't usually spend a lot of time wondering if they are not.  In other words the fact that you've spent a lot of time wondering if you are asexual is itself some evidence that you may be."

Before coming to this sub it had been suggested to me I could be ace but I shrugged it off as I found some people to be aesthetically pleasing to the eye, thinking this was the same as sexual attraction. However since reading specifically that sexual attraction is completely different I've been curious as to what I'm evidently missing out on.."
asexuality,2r1yp3,melanellie,2,Fri Jan 2 00:59:22 2015 UTC,"1&2: I haven't worn a ring, although I've been thinking about it, so I have no personal experience but I think if it makes you feel empowered you should go for it! That's the reason I would want to wear it. If any other asexuals notice and want to talk to you about it, that's a side benefit. The biggest thing is you feeling comfortable and proud of who you are. Whatever helps you feel that way.   3: yes. For sure. I think this is the biggest problem with aces being the invisible orientation. Sure, it's way ""easier"" than, say, being transgender & facing the blatant phobia of narrowminded people, but our culture is so sexual/romantic that not feeling that way can be totally isolating. Even if you have great friends, it is a universal understanding that romantic/sexual relationships take precedence over platonic ones. Always. So at some point you will be back-burnered & you're expected to never be bothered by this. In fact, you are the one considered selfish if you even dare to mention such a thing.    Yes, i am the same way. I can occasionally picture having sex with someone I don't know (although all I really know is that the person I'm picturing isn't someone I know now, so idk if i know them in the pictured scenario? Anyway) in a not-negative way, but picturing myself with anyone I know is just skin-crawly. For me, I think it's just because picturing a fictional scenario is just that-fictional, so I can deal with it but when you get down to actually ""getting down"" with someone, I'm not okay with it.  I do not yet, irl :/ I can only imagine that it would be wonderful tho, since the community on tumblr and reddit have made a world of difference for me.  I wouldn't say ""afraid,"" but definitely uncomfortable. If someone was actively trying to have sex with me, it would probably turn into actual fear."

And OH my gosh I completely understand what you're saying about sexual/romantic relationships automatically receiving priority. And it makes me horribly sad to think about it. Because, if you are really good friends with someone, and he/she has an SO who he/she is not such good friends with but they are in a sexual relationship, that friend will probably abandon you in a heartbeat. I've never had this kind of situation happen to me before, but I can totally imagine it, and it would bother me a lot. Some of the choices sexuals make bother me because I can't understand how they feel. But of course I need to just understand that they think differently than me. It's just... hard to comprehend."
asexuality,2r1yp3,e4knee,2,Sun Jan 4 06:17:23 2015 UTC,"3) I don't feel broken, I just feel like I'm on the end of a spectrum. Some of my friends are very sexual and talk about their urges or activities openly. Some are waiting for marriage, some only have sex in monogamous relationships (and aren't in relationships often), and some just do it with less frequency. Of course, I'm also 25, so most of my friends aren't out of their parents' homes for the first time. Not to say that freshmen are necessarily more sexual on average, but that new-found freedom may help influence just how sexual you think your peers are.  4) When someone wants to do something that you would never want to do, it’s hard to imagine why, to empathize, so we end up feeling a distance. This can be true of things that aren’t sex: believing in god, wanting to try drugs, wanting to have children, getting married, wanting to move go a new city, enjoying the taste of coffee, etc. Remembering that people have different opinions is my advice. Don’t judge others for their opinions or preferences, and try to ensure that they don’t judge you in return."

I like being the way I am but I can't say I'm normal! I actually find it really interesting when my friends talk about sex, just because I never thought about some things before. I try not to judge people based on what they desire. It's pretty easy, because almost everyone in the world is sexual, so I'm pretty much used to ignoring that. I'm a really open-minded person, and I can usually fully understand another's point of view.

I have always thought of it as something only other asexuals were likely to understand and bring up. I have been keeping an eye out for other people with them.  I've also been in awkward situations about the ring, so I have a back up excuse about what it means that I use if I don't want to tell people what it really means. If you don't feel comfortable telling someone then just pretend it's nothing.  Your third point can be a hard one to deal with, but keep in mind that there a lots of different kinds of people around you. Everyone is different, you may want to try looking to see if you can meet more people.  I understand what you mean about everyone else being ""entranced"". I think of it as they have a hunger, just like you and I do for food. Except it's for sex. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not something we have. Imagine if you never got hungry, but you saw everyone else eating, it would seem pretty weird.  I do not have any asexual friends. I do have one friend who seems pretty close who I never talk about sex with. Talking to her is a nice break from everyone else. It would be nice to have an asexual friend, but the community of this subreddit is a good place to talk.  I am not afraid of having sex, but I would not do it casually.

I guess the black ring is more like a symbol with the purpose of helping asexies recognise each other.   I have a question for you... When you say, ""I am not afraid of having sex, but I would not do it casually,"" what do you mean by casually? Do you mean that you wouldn't do it regularly? Or do you mean that you would only do it with someone you care about? In my mind, sexual desire and romantic love are two absolutely different things. I don't see that sex between a committed couple is any more meaningful than two strangers banging in the alley. I think some asexuals understand the link between love and sex, but just don't seek out sex in particular. But I just can't comprehend the connection at all--I mean, I can, on the level of what society has taught me--but I just don't relate to it, you know? It just so happens that I'm not interested in sex. Some people have the same mindset as me about sex and love being totally different, but still want sex, just not for love.

However if I am in a relationship with someone who is sexual I would be willing to have sex with them. This is because in a relationship I want the other person to be happy, so I am willing to do that with them.  I think the best way I can understand why sex between couples is different than between relative strangers is the intimacy of it. It helps to form a connection and a familiarity between people. You really get to know the other person and share in something personal. This is different form having sex with a person you will never see again, you are just doing for the excitement of the moment, without thought of a longer relationship or any intent know the person.  I think the key thing is that not all sex is the same. It can be just something you do because you feel like you need to, or it can be a deeply personal sharing of emotion and self."

(they don't know I'm aro ace, but I have told them I don't want a bf, indefinitely. They keep thinking I'm kidding or something?) kept complaint and cajoling to do it. In the meantime they handed my brother one that said something along the lines of ""I will grow 20cm"". I honestly didn't get it till I took it and they started laughing. Whatever.

""I resolve to go to the gym,"" is a hell of a lot different than saying ""You should go to the gym."" ""I will You should grow 20cm"" is the same as saying ""You are too short.""

If you're happy living there and would rather stay, then see if you can do something about him. Sure he's an idiot, but he's going to continue being an idiot until someone stands up to him and makes him realise his behaviour is not okay. From what you've said, he was harassing you and that's good enough reason to report him to your landlord I reckon. He sounds very ignorant and only concerned about himself and his own needs, but if he's saying these things to you if you leave chances are he'll continue to harass future female housemates, and it sounds as though you're a strong enough character to stand up to him. Maybe talk to your other housemates (don't know if they're male/female) and see if you can all sit down together. If you speak to him in front of them then you'll have support behind you.

asexuality,2qwhb9,Kenszingteon,1 point,Wed Dec 31 07:38:32 2014 UTC,"It sounds like there are two issues stopping you from really getting into and exploring your sexuality. One is self-esteem, and the other is an idea of sex that's built on misconceptions based on mainstream depictions of it.  Not wanting to have sex is perfectly okay. The emotional reaction you describe in response to sexual desire, though, sounds unhealthy. That doesn't mean you're crazy or that there's no hope for you. I'd recommend talking to a therapist. To be honest, I think most people could benefit from therapy, largely because it's done a world of good for me. There's no reason you should feel unworthy of affection.  Almost all ""common knowledge"" about sex is wrong, because it's typically assumed that the pattern of average male sexuality should apply to everyone. And it doesn't. There are plenty of men it doesn't apply to, and it's sure isn't accurate for any but a few rare women.  Penis-in-vagina sex isn't all that pleasurable for lots of women, and most don't climax from penetration alone. However, there are a lot more things people can do together, some of which focus far more on the woman's enjoyment. Communication and trust are important in sex (and in lots of other things). Preconceived notions about what should happen or what it should be like will probably only add an extra layer of stress to the proceedings.  You deserve to be confident and have a fantastic sex life if that's what you want for yourself. But you can also can go through life without ever having sex if you don't want to. Just don't force yourself into either of those roles for no reason other than your preconceived notions of what you should be like."

There are asexuals who carry on perfectly happy relationships with sexual partners. Many of us still have a normal libido; it just isn't driven by people, and in some cases we have no interest in letting another person handle it for us. In some cases, we do.   I think you may find that if you stop worrying about what to call yourself, and focus on whether you're happy with your partner, and if you're happy with the relationship itself, you'll feel a bit better.   I know that's hard to do. I'm also GAD, with a touch of depression, but the realization for me that there's nothing wrong with me was a huge relief."

If things have been working for you and your boyfriend so far, there's no reason why they should stop working now.  In fact, I have a theory that you can even see some benefits in being asexual as opposed to just having a lower sex drive than your partner. People who do have a sex drive, just not a strong one, can SOMETIMES see sex as only something they do when they're in the mood, and can be resentful towards their partner for wanting sex when they don't. Those who are asexual, especially who have identified that way for a while, can sometimes better recognise that sex can still be a pleasant experience even when they're not turned on or getting much out of it, but just pleasing their partner. This is just something I've had in my head for a while and haven't thought through a hundred percent, so I'm sorry if I offend anyone, but it's something to think about!!"

And eventually things got going sexually as well.  It dawned on me only some time into that full-on relationship, that sex for me is like any other activity. If you let me choose between having sex and listening to music... Well, I'd choose the latter, just because you don't have to undress.  Sex is a lot like music. You can say that you've just wasted 5 minutes of your life, or that it was the best experience in your life so far. Get to know your taste more, learn about your reactions. Be comfortable with your body, don't be afraid to say 'no'. Go down that path as long as you want, it's pretty simple, stop at any time you want."
asexuality,2qn3zl,revMaxx,3,Sun Dec 28 21:36:26 2014 UTC,"It does sound like you could be asexual.  But it also sounds like you could be experiencing the very common side effects SSRIs like Lexapro are known to cause.  If you've been on this med since puberty, you don't really have much of a baseline with which to compare your current functioning.  So suggesting a change in medications is entirely reasonable, and, honestly, it's probably worth exploring.  You can always switch back later.  Other than that, stop beating yourself up and talk about this with your partner.  Everyone experiences sex differently, and there's no reason you should be expected to be in the same place as him (or your friends/peers, or the media, or whatever other sources you've drawn from to come up with what you think sex is supposed to be like).  That's probably never going to happen.  But if he enjoys it and you don't mind it, there really shouldn't be a problem.  And if there is, a little communication might be all it takes to solve it.  Every couple, ace or otherwise, has to figure out what works for both parties, and that's a helluva lot easier to accomplish by asking, instead of just guessing.  And as far as how to get out of your head during sex ... sorry, I got nothing.  Story of my life, tbh."

asexuality,2qn3zl,oskietje,2,Tue Dec 30 03:39:37 2014 UTC,"I have a few things to say about this one as it in some ways hits close to home.  I think it's a bit hasty for most people to jump to the conclusion that it's a result of your anti-depressants (which is plausible but not totally an exclusive possibility). Furthermore, while the discussion has been largely positive, I would have hoped that it veered away from ""there's a problem that needs fixing"" which just has to do with mainstream expectations about sexuality. Having said that, I'm a bit saddened by the fact that your mental health professional has not broached the subject of possibly being asexual. As a homoromantic asexual man, I can confidently say that it's a possibility that only you can know if it's true. It has a lot to do with what you feel deep inside, and if there is an absence of sexual attraction towards any gender then it's quite possible.  It's important for you to not feel rushed, or pressured to choose a label or identify your low or non-existent libido to be anything wrong with you. We are all built in different ways and the varying shades of our diversity help shape humanity - we should appreciate these differences.  As a penultimate comment, you might consider seeking second opinions with your therapist. The fact (s)he is a homosexual doesn't really help your cause - given that it might be further vilifying your lack of desire or anxiety about sex.  And finally, you're lucky to have a partner that is seemingly tolerant and accepting of you as a person and not solely basing your relationship on sexual attraction. While for the vast majority of people that's a big deal, for others it's not at all and I can only wish that I can encounter more of those people in the world. I'm a bit jealous, to be honest - if I had a chance with either types of people in your circumstance, I'd be much happier."

I'm sorry you're stuck with that sort of person. Is another one available? If not, muddle through until you can find a better match. Some clinics have low cost med management.  However, Lexapro is an SSRI. ALL SSRIs have a component of libido lowering and anorgasmia. A decent amount of your asexuality could be due to your medication knocking down your nervous system. Think of it: many of the formative years of your sexuality have been dampened by an SSRI. That's actually a good reason to try a different drug.   You can also add in something like Wellbutrin, which is an antidepressant that can also boost sex drive. How has cognitive behavioral therapy been working for you? It's amazing for anxiety."

I'm in a very similar situation, the only differences being that I'm 26 and my social anxiety wasn't caused by bullying, it just kind of appeared in teenage years, I guess. While I'm just as confused, it wouldn't be fair to reinforce your confusion and anxiety with my own, though...   I think it's important to remember that happy and fulfilled life is possible without a partner. I'm not saying you shouldn't get one, I'm just saying that the prospect of a lonely life must not turn into a boogeyman that paralyzes your thoughts.  On the other hand, a happy relationship without sex is also very possible - just read around here or in AVEN, many people are doing it.  To find someone who is not interested in sex only, I suppose the answer is communication with them in order to find out if your intentions match. Even though I know, and I'd be the first to say, that it's easier said than done...     In any case I wish you happy winter holidays"

Adolescence is a very strange thing, and there are so many factors that go into developing sexuality that you cannot be sure.  But there is, again, the chance you may be asexual. I didn't have an appeal for sex in high school and clearly I'm a virgin, alone commenting on an asexuality sub-forum. It's completely possible.  Remember, more than anything else, when people spew things like ""it's just a phase,"" or ""you haven't met the right person,"" they are saying that for themselves, not for you. It's easier for most people to avoid thinking about atypical lifestyles in their typical world. These people would rather you ignore any conflicting feelings you have and simply fall into the ""normal"" line, having repressed feelings your entire life.  You'll be 100% sure eventually. Identify as asexual if you wish to. It's your choice. Just keep in mind that such an identity is yours to use and yours alone. Don't let anyone corrupt it into a ""phase"" or ""waiting."""
asexuality,2q696z,hahahahahaha_,3,Tue Dec 23 16:40:54 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I try to keep my feelings and opinions to myself, but sometimes it does come out. I just didn't think some people find it so bizarre that some people aren't sexually attracted to people. An emotional connection feels much more personal, but that's what I think.  Like Dr. Seuss said, ""Be who are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who don't mind matter."""
asexuality,2q696z,hahahahahaha_,2,Tue Dec 23 16:54:11 2014 UTC,"I had almost the precise thoughts when I first learned about asexuality. Homosexual behavior might be seen as ""abnormal"" to people who have only seen heterosexual behavior in their lives, but I never believed there could be so much animosity toward being neutral, apathetic, or uninterested. I was incorrect — some people just cannot stand non-normative lifestyles."
asexuality,2q696z,hahahahahaha_,2,Tue Dec 23 17:01:59 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I am ace, unless it really is a ""phase"", but is it really something you ""come out"" as? I am straight though, and attracted to females."
asexuality,2q696z,hahahahahaha_,3,Tue Dec 23 17:07:02 2014 UTC,"It depends on how you feel. If you have a good relationship with the people around you, coming out might be a good idea. Some people want the people in their family and their friends to know their true colors. The people you come out to should not question your feelings in a method to try to make you desire sex. They should be accepting. Personally, I don't ever plan on telling my family, because they don't need to know. I'm perpetually misunderstood by my family, and that would just be another shit-show. I'm better off keeping to myself and avoiding the subject of getting a date or anything similar.  I'm not sure if you know, but there are romantic orientations as well as sexual orientations. If you say you are fairly sure you're asexual, but straight as well, does this mean you don't want sex with girls but you're romantically attracted to them? Then that would point to heteroromantic asexuality. You can be hetero-, homo-, bi-, aromantic; really, any prefix in sexual orientation can be in romantic orientation as well. Sex can be made without love, and love can be made without sex.  Or you could even be grey-asexual.  Asexuality, like all sexuality (or lack thereof) in general, is a spectrum. Identify with it or don't, it's your choice. These are just words we attempt to use to most accurately explain our sexual and romantic feelings. You don't have to use any you feel don't describe you accurately."
asexuality,2q696z,kalari-,2,Tue Dec 23 17:20:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, I am romantically attracted to girls, so I guess that would be heteroromantic? I didn't know there were so many different shades of asexuality, it's actually pretty fascinating."
asexuality,2q696z,kalari-,2,Tue Dec 23 17:43:58 2014 UTC,"All I have to say is: thank you Alfred Kinsey.  His work is a crucial foundation to modern assessments of sexology, apparently the study of human sexuality. He didn't come up with all of those terms, but surely without work like his (being one of the first to popularize the idea of sexuality being a spectrum, a scale, rather than a black-and-white liking of one, another, or both,) there may be a chance we wouldn't be where we are in understanding sexuality. The Kisney Scale is one of the first scales of sexuality, going from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual,) with the majority of people at 1. He also included an X, off the scale, for non-sexual people (asexuals.)  There are throngs of people who make fun of these ideas of sub-factions of attraction, like biromantic asexuality or aromantic pansexuality, but honestly these people are usually heterosexuals who don't understand what it means to be non-normative. These descriptions help with accuracy so much, and really help describe how people feel. It's lovely to learn and know about."

The sun rises through the window casting a warm beam of light onto the gray walls of her bedroom. I rub my nose against hers, and she wakes, smiling at me.   6 months ago this never could have happened, except maybe in my dreams.  ""Morning"" she says, sitting up and shaking the hair out of her face. Her name is Anne. We went to high school together, and despite our best efforts we drifted apart when we went off to different colleges. It's spring break though, and we're both home. Last night we watched Death Note, ate chocolate, cuddled, and ended up falling asleep in each others arms.   It happened one morning when everyone woke up and found out they were just like us, asexual. There was panic at first, and the government began worrying about population. There was talk of initiating a breeding program, but that lasted about a week. People kept coming forward stating that they still intended to have children. The world learned very quickly that sex isn't only reason people decide to have children, or relationships.   ""What shall we do this fine Saturday?"" I ask.   ""I'm going to the ranch at 1. You can come along if you want"" She has a horse, and rides in competitions. I don't know as much about it as I feel I should.  ""I have some work to do, but I think I can manage. I would like to go"" We get dressed, eat breakfast and continue on with our day. We're not having sex; we're not even dating, and for the first time society isn't throwing a fit about it.  The thing that gets me the most is just how the culture's changed. I'm not separated from my female friends the way I was. No one cares if we want to cuddle or even sleep together, heck that used to mean having sex, well not really anymore. I mean, people would think you're dating, but I'm used to that. The more I look at it, sex was never a thing that brought people together, it just kept us apart."

asexuality,2q1y1d,fozzywozzy,16,Mon Dec 22 08:40:36 2014 UTC,"There are people with little to no libido who still experience sexual attraction, and thus yearn for a higher sex drive. Inversely, there are asexuals who have a ""sex drive"" but are not sexually attracted to others so they simply masturbate to satiate themselves.  I, for one, have never truly experienced sexual attraction. I was, however, very confused during my teen years because I did, in fact, have a normal libido. This made me think I wanted sex, then I tried it and realized I was definitely not interested. Nowadays, for whatever reason, I have no libido to speak of.  My point is, libido and sexual attraction are quite different things.  [edit: grammar]"
asexuality,2q1y1d,WombatWithWifi,2,Mon Dec 22 10:28:33 2014 UTC,"I am able to easily know I am asexual and not ""low libido"" or ""hyposexual"" because they are two different things for me.  I have a very high libido, My sex drive is the same as all my allosexual friends. I get horny, I want to have my genitals stimulated or I want to read erotica or look at raunchy fan art or go on a romantic mental daydreaming journey. But I don't actually want sex with another person, I don't find a person sexually attractive, the idea of people or sex just isn't related to my libido at all. It has no effect.  To me, libido is hormonal and random, My sexuality is influenced by outside stimuli like attractive people or sexual encounters (or in this case, it's not)  A few days ago there was a post on autochorissexuality, That better explains my identity, But ""asexual"" is more easily recognised."
asexuality,2q1y1d,mundabit,2,Tue Dec 23 11:52:21 2014 UTC,"I do think about things like this, though not quite so much as it relates to the gay movement. It's important to make the distinction between low libido and lacking sexual attraction in the same way it is important to distinguish homosexuality from a mental problem (something something 1970s... You've heard it all before). Low libido can be identified and treated and can be the sign of problems, whereas having never experienced it isn't. This isn't to say that it can't be, but rather that everyone's normal is different.  After a distinction is made, I think it's mostly up to the individual. A name can be stigmatizing, but it can also be freeing. I don't think it's based on ego; the only benefit is internal peace, not external reward. Beyond that, it's no different from having a word for fire. It existed long before you mouthed the name, you just now have a way of communicating about it.  Wrote this on my phone.

It was good to realize that there wasn't something wrong with me, and that my lack of interest in sex was something natural that other people shared.

The phrase ""low libido"" implies to me that there's still some desire for sex, just less frequently or to a lesser degree than is typical. It also implies to me that there may be some sort of medical issue that could be resolved and restore the libido to a higher state, whereas I don't think my orientation is something that can or should be medicated away."

People probably assume that I'm a lesbian because of the way I dress and the stuff I say, but that's because I'm not out as asexual to a lot of people yet.  Personally, I'd ask what about what it was that gave them that impression. A bit hard to change when you don't even know what is it that needs to change. Or whether there should be a change in the first place. Some people get pretty defensive if they think their choices are being looked down on. It's like being vegetarian; people think I'm looking down on people who eat meat just because I'm vegetarian. It may not actually be you, but rather, them."

Might I ask, did you stand up for yourself when they were making the plant jokes? If you did please explain how. Besides that, what was described was not good relationship practices. I would advise you to reconcile with them and after that leave them to be on their own. Do not try to continue a relationship unless they are willing to change their ways.  Try to remember that perhaps the reason why they said those words was because they had little education on the subject of asexuality. Maybe another reason why they acted out was because of how they were with other friends. That relates to the saying, people are bad but a person is good. I do not mean to say that it's absolutely the reason why; it is merely a possibility and it could bring the comfort of a good speculation.   I would encourage you every time you want to come out, to take your coming out as an opportunity to *properly spread awareness of the fact that some people really are like that and it isn't a joke or a play on words. If all you said was something like ""I am asexual and it means that I do not like sex"" that is very vague and a bit too open to interpretation and does not adequately provide education.  If you are already aware of all this and did take proper action I apologize. From what you described I cannot determine whether or not you did do those things, and if you'd like more communication feel free to reply with a clarifying statement. I can talk about how to respectfully stand up for yourself without any unneeded confrontational words, and I can speak of effective ways to spread awareness."

I'd actually say that this was a pretty normal response for someone who has a difficult time accepting things that they have not heard, up until that moment, are at all true. So, while super rude, you could chalk that up as typical behavior and they likely, I'd be willing to guess, respond to other things outside of their experience similarly. This doesn't make it okay, and if you've communicated this calmly, assertively, and a similar result comes out of it then you can use your own discretion in deciding if these are worthwhile friends.

I ended up going to asexuality.org and the asexual awareness week website to help teach them about it and after about a half an hour or so of discussing and answering questions, we were on completely cool terms. It's kind of scary (to me) and frustrating to be treated like that, but really I think the best you can do is try to teach them about it or to re-evaluate your friendship choices.

Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance focuses on how humans strive for internal consistency. When inconsistency (dissonance) is experienced, individuals tend to become psychologically uncomfortable and they are motivated to attempt to reduce this dissonance, as well as actively avoiding situations and information which are likely to increase it.

asexuality,2pri9y,jadefirefly,12,Fri Dec 19 21:57:31 2014 UTC,"Personally, this term just became something important to me. I've always felt like a ""traitor"", a not ""pure"" asexual, as I masturbate and get aroused. Many years of Internet and exposure has created a feeling for sex in me. Still, I just don't have interest in having neither romantic nor sexual partners, and as I understand sexual orientation as the way we relate to other people, I've always felt that asexual described me much better than any of my random kinks. They are a part of me, I suppose, but they are much more irrelevant to my life, my self, that my behavior towards other humans.  I don't know if this is the perfect term for me, but it does a good job in letting me explain what my self is all about. Even if I know about sex, and even if the idea is not really unpleasant to me, I could not imagine myself involved in sex or a relation. And that's something that makes me a little bit different, that helps me create an identity, and a part of me I have very strong feelings about.  I don't know if this is a paraphilia, an orientation, or what. But it touches a point that is worth a look. And that's the idea of labels, I think.  From now on, I will probably still use the term asexual to describe myself, as it is just simpler and more relevant to me. But now I have something to add, a way of describing and explaining my behavior without losing my identity, a way of splitting things that people always tied together (just like asexuality and the gray spectrum differentiates romanticism from sexuality).

With how many ""am I asexual?"" posts this subreddit gets, I think it's obvious that there's a lot of confusion and ambiguity about what different behaviors and experiences mean about people's sexuality.   I have mixed feelings about this as a label. By its definition, it indicates a personal sexual experience - not something that involves other people. I mean, in most contexts, being asexual and having no libido or no sexual fantasies is completely indistinguishable from being autochorissexual. Your bedroom is your business. On the other hand, some people do have spaces or relationships where it's considered appropriate to discuss or share porn/erotic stories/whatever, and I can definitely see someone on the ace spectrum finding this term useful in those spaces to shut up identity-policing assholes who try to tell them what their own sexuality is, or to easily find resources for explaining their life experience to people who are benevolently curious.  Ultimately I agree with this post. We'll have to wait and see. If it's a useful term, it'll stop being rare and more and more people will become familiar with it. If it's not useful, it'll die out (but hopefully, the understanding that having these kind of experiences doesn't disqualify you from the ace spectrum won't)."

Most guys I know (I attend men's high school, don't know such thing is common in US or any western country, but it certainly is in where I live―S.Korea) seems that they just think this as a subject of joke. Bad phenomenon indeed but I can't expect them to be always be rational, or at least be serious about it."
asexuality,2pr2y4,trumpetsofjericho,2,Sat Dec 20 01:37:45 2014 UTC,"Here in Germany I feel like there are very few schools which are split up by gender. More common with boarding schools I think, where you're living for the week or even all the time.  And yeah, I'm not always sure if somebody is joking or serious. I've been in the situation a couple of times where I was like ""Ah, he's joking, alright"", said something back and after a couple of times of that and him upping the ante I realised: ""Hold on a moment...he actually thinks that. Whoa, we're not just joking around, he's actually...whoa, I am a bit of an asshole now, I should stop."""

asexuality,2pmf7v,WhatelsecanIdo1,6,Wed Dec 17 22:40:00 2014 UTC,"Something bad happened to me over a decade ago. It took about ten years to get over the constant torment of remembering constantly and especially with triggers. I got pills that helped the PTSD as a side benefit as well as for mental illness that nearly lead me to suicide. I also smoke a lot of specific types medical marijuana. Not suggesting it if it is illegal where you live, just saying. Getting into a relationship with someone great helped me too. (I'm not an ace, I just know what having something bad happen that I didn't want to happen feels like)  If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide, please get help now. You are worth it. It helps even when it feels like talking about it does nothing. Getting it out of your head with someone to listen really does help heal in the long run. Even if it hurts like hell to bring it up. I was on several medications over the years and at one point felt hopeless and that medicine and therapy couldn't help.   I used a throwaway because I don't want this on my main account, but I felt moved to type out my thoughts on the subject.  Feel free to message me if you like.   Sending some love your way despite the fact that we've never met. It can get better even though it hurts sometimes still, usually with triggers, but it can get brighter in the future."

asexuality,2pmf7v,The_Grape_Bucket,4,Thu Dec 18 05:47:44 2014 UTC,"I don't know if this will help, but I want to help you so badly.   Have you ever read one of those stupid Christians-trying-to-be-provocative blog things about virginity? The one I'm thinking of, is a girl who centered her entire image around the fact that she wore a purity ring and was a virgin. On her wedding night, she lost her virginity, and then she began suffering from depression and just became unhappy in general, because her entire identity was gone.  So you've had a lot of educated people giving you advice, and I'm not so stupid as to think I can give you any better advice. I could say, you say you have no one so then the solution is to go find someone. Or I could say, you gave up your goals so go continue them or find new ones. Or whatever.   But just from reading what you wrote, I can see you're a person who feels deeply, and communicates powerfully. The person who raped you was an insignificant piece of shit, I wish all sorts of revenge on him. But you could influence so many things, it's unreal. You could kill yourself, and your entire life would be reduced to a tiny blip on the grand scheme of the world, just like that guy. You're right when you say he would win.   Or you could use your influence while you're alive, and the entire world would be at your feet. If you wrote a book that never held back the truth, just like you wrote here, I would read it. Just reading what you wrote here has really impacted my mind.  So I don't think I helped you, though I really wish I could. But if you ever want someone to talk to, even if it's about the most insignificant thing, I would be more than willing to listen. I can't offer you any real help or advice, but maybe you want to just blow off steam every once in a while...  I really hope you get what you need and want, whatever that is. You will be in my thoughts."
asexuality,2pmf7v,AnyasCat,2,Thu Dec 18 05:03:03 2014 UTC,"I know it seems lonely where you are right now, but you've got a community of other aces right here online. I completely understand your view of sex and sexuality, and it's so hard in such a sexualized society, as for going out, the best I can recommend is to go where kids go. family friendly places tend not to have much sexualized ads or really anything sexual in general, so those might be safe places, and don't give up, we're here for you"
asexuality,2pmf7v,clearly-a-cat,2,Thu Dec 18 07:36:38 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry for what you're going through. The fact that you expected to be a virgin for your whole life is probably making this harder than it should be. If you expect something to be there with you always and it's suddenly ripped away from you... such a thing can be traumatic in itself, and that's before factoring in the trauma of rape.  I'm an asexual who was raped as a virgin, so kind of a similar situation... the main difference is probably that I didn't put much value on virginity, so that loss wasn't as severe. Yeah, it still sucked, a lot... but the value we put on things to begin with is important. To have those feelings discounted because we live in a sexualised world is horrible.   You seem to be having a real bad time of things, and I hope you won't do anything that you can't take back. I'll begin with the cliché ""life can get better, you can heal from this, yadda yadda"", which is true enough though it can be hard to see. Try to take things one day at a time.   I know you said that it's different for you because other survivors focus on ""reclaiming their sexuality"", but maybe you could ""reclaim your asexuality""? What happened to you didn't change that.  If you ever feel like having someone to talk to at any time, just message me."

asexuality,2pmf7v,Throwawaytrays,1 point,Thu Dec 18 02:55:02 2014 UTC,"Honestly, it seems like I spent the bulk of my days sleeping excessively, zoning out or crying in the bathtub, ordering takeout, and watching TV.    I have an online business, but I've mostly been just bleeding through my savings because I've been so unmotivated to work.  I tried doing an online class this semester but failed it because I was so depressed and bored by it.  I'm really isolated and need more social interaction, but it feels like every time I work up the courage to start being social again, I get hit with some some fresh reminder of what an asexual-unfriendly rape culture I live in, and so I just go back to being a hermit.  For example, about two weeks ago I went to the hairdresser, who randomly proceeded to talk about how most rapes you hear about on the news aren't real.  I have left the house just 2 or 3 times since."
asexuality,2pmf7v,Throwawaytrays,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:14:47 2014 UTC,"That basically describes my current lifestyle, although still living with parents means its not remotely comparable. Can understand just how empty and frustrated it makes you feel, is there anything you really enjoy doing or is it literally just killing time between sleeping?  Sounds great that you have your own business, what is it (if I can ask?) If you need a lacky who can work/help from a far, give me a shout. Depression is fucking awful without it draining your bank too.  Again, similar position. Literally two friends of who I don't see very often even, I'm completely unaware of how to fix that so can't help you with that sorry.  Please don't do anything drastic, there are plenty people who will understand and agree with you, unfortunately you seem to be have been dealt a hand of utter morons to surround you."

asexuality,2pdqmt,Kali711,15,Tue Dec 16 02:58:11 2014 UTC,"Like I don't remember ever having those ~childhood crushes~, but honestly I still related to this article. At six or seven? Even though my closest friends had been mostly boys since preschool I started hanging out more with girls at least partially because adults kept making the kinds of comments this mom talks about.

asexuality,2pdqmt,Kali711,11,Tue Dec 16 15:49:35 2014 UTC,"Skyping with a girl for three hours  ""Have you finished talking to your girlfriend?""  Just because I like talking to somebody doesn't mean we're in a relationship. Also I absolutely hate everybody who does this ""Two people of opposite gender are talking to each other, either they are together, want to be together but aren't yet or one of them wants to do the other but the other doesn't want to do them."" Oh, I didn't know I was only allowed to talk to the opposite gender to fuck them. I mean, kinda homophobic of you that you never assumed I was talking to you because I want to fuck you.  Sorry, just ranting. Also it might have been more than three hours at times and I'm not even sorry for that."
asexuality,2pdqmt,Malzair,2,Tue Dec 16 17:41:04 2014 UTC,"Yes! No problems talking to a best friend of the same sex for hours on end, but it's a guy? Then that means you are together already, in denial, or getting there.   Such bullshit."
asexuality,2pdqmt,Kali711,5,Tue Dec 16 18:09:18 2014 UTC,"I feel like this is really sexist, too. Like, I'm talking to a girl and what it's supposed to end up is us having sex? The main use of women is for men to fuck them? That doesn't sound right. Not right at all.  Also, when those people know I'm not looking for a relationship. I don't want one, why do you think I would have changed my mind so quickly? Do you really think I am like ""I don't want a relationship"" on one day, three days later I am like ""Oh, why not?"" and on the same day find a person to be in that relationship in? Like, I don't think that's how it works.  But it's funny to see them talk when they're in a relationship and are like ""Don't use the word relationship"", ""Don't say love, it's such a..."" Oh, you have a problem with calling this between your girlfriend and you a relationship, which it fucking is but to other people you throw that word around like it's a frisbee in a dog park."
