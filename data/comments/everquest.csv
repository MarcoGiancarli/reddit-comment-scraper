everquest,3e74ww,guindel,2,Wed Jul 22 13:53:09 2015 UTC,Exodus III has good memory for me too
everquest,3e74ww,jelbert6969,2,Wed Jul 22 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"I have played many MMOs. I can say that really only the old school MMOs have that feel. Out of all of them only two have stuck with me as those ""wow those feels"" and that's EQ and FF11. I think part of it is that the games were so much harder and hardcore than modern games, so successes and failures were much more spectacular and memorable. The things I remember about 11 are mostly negative, but then there are the times I acquired all of the summons and that was a serious challenge. The spectacular wipes in EQ that I still talk about today. There isn't really anything like now in days.  I think newer games like Crowfall will create new memories like that but in a different way such as ""man lemme tell you about this amazing siege that we went through"" side note if you like pvp check out crowfall."
everquest,3e74ww,steelsuirdra,2,Wed Jul 22 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"EQ was holds a special place with many people. For myself it was a rough patch in my life (girlfriend and friends all moved away to college while I couldn't afford too) I started up EQ and met some really awesome people, my first guild was really great for bringing me out of my depression, and I made several IRL friends through players who lived in my area, its this that really concreted the game into my #1 of all time.  I was the best man at the wedding of someone I met in EQ 16 years ago and remain good friends with half a dozen of the people I met in the game over a decade later."
everquest,3e74ww,Ikarikaze,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"Vanguard.... But I would venture to say any game, with a large community, will generate nostalgia.  Even more so, online games that get switched off.      I can always play Zork or XCOM if I get the itch... I can't do that with any number of online games. (Either switched off or ""evolved"" with the market)"
everquest,3e45be,HellHound989,3,Tue Jul 21 20:32:55 2015 UTC,I really wish more people would read what Prathun has stated about instancing. I think the way people keep begging for it is really hampering better discussion of alternatives.
everquest,3e45be,PathToEternity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"I think if guilds end up with a completely separate force of characters logged out on each raid spawn point or at least the more important ones, that will end up forcing Daybreak to do something.  I assume the alternative(s) you refer to are load balancing with main bosses still in them rather than lockout based?"
everquest,3e45be,middleground11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think that's the most likely we'd see, yes.  Why do you think a raidforce at each spawnpoint would change anything though ?"

everquest,3e45be,DarknessTemple,2,Tue Jul 21 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, which of them is actually interesting?   Prathun is a coder I believe, and is somewhat less likely to say something that overrules Holly Longdale on raid policy; so given that context, I take his comments in that thread as supplements to what she said.   Basically - from a policy standpoint Holly is declining to instance raids and he is justifying it from a labor standpoint.     I was under the impression you interpret something he said to have a different meaning than that?"
everquest,3e45be,middleground11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:25 2015 UTC,I only saw a dev making a joke about project management. Wasn't that interesting.

First to engage (we called locking the mob) couldn't be KS'd.  (For non-raid, all mobs also did this after the first 10% dmg was taken)"

everquest,3e45be,Craig_Plays_Games,0,Wed Jul 22 01:30:28 2015 UTC,"This isn't new information. Instancing the raid content in classic (and Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP) isn't a small amount of work. Doing this the right way would significantly impact our ability to launch our campaign this year.  I called this out in my post here, before Ragefire launched.  Prathun (He's EQ's Lead Designer... not just a coder) shares more info on this in his post here"
everquest,3e45be,TheRoshen,2,Tue Jul 21 23:42:52 2015 UTC,"If instancing raid content is out of the question, is there anything else in discussion that will allow more than 1-2 guilds to get Dragon/God kills?"
everquest,3e45be,ArsFrags,-2,Wed Jul 22 00:35:33 2015 UTC,You mean like the changes we added just a few weeks ago? https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/raid-changes-coming-in-july.223880/  Our current goal is making raid content more available while still allowing for competition and accomplishment
everquest,3e45be,TheRoshen,6,Wed Jul 22 01:13:26 2015 UTC,"All those changes did for the most part was make it harder for the mage armies.  I hate to say it, but Holly (and presumably you and Aristo even though I didn't actually see either of you actually using this word) are being extremely obtuse with your claims of ""strategy"".    Raiding in EQ is poop socking, training, DPS racing and now, there are rumors that a guild is planning to level up an overwhelming number of alts so that they can place an entire raid on each raid mob's spawn point, so that they have almost zero travel time.  Mob spawns, raid camps out and back in on their entrenched alts.    Is that what you think of when you use the word ""competition""?   How does Daybreak Game Company define ""competition"" and does throwing more and more characters and/or accounts at the game constitute ""competition""?      I will say this, your posts in this thread seem to be much more receptive to instancing than ever before, so it seems we're making progress.     Do you not realize how much cheering and joy you would inspire on all active EQ forums if you just said ""OK, we finally get it.  It still takes a lot of work, so we can't get it done until Velious, but we will get it done""?  Which - by the way - asking the players to give you until Velious would relieve you of the need to expend any effort on Kunark or Classic mobs, saving you a LOT of work."
everquest,3e45be,middleground11,2,Wed Jul 22 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"That helped prevent the people boxing mage groups from farming bosses (except on phinny), but it didn't do anything to let other raid guilds attempt the bosses without quitting their jobs to be available 24/7."
everquest,3e45be,ArsFrags,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:00 2015 UTC,Just tell us you're doing it after the campaign.
everquest,3e45be,Maestro_M,0,Wed Jul 22 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"Spoiler Warning: After the next campaign there will be ANOTHER campaign.  (much like how after an expansion launch, the team was already working on ANOTHER expansion).  I'm not saying this to be rude. We have a limited number of devs and each of them only have so many hours in the day. Instancing all of the raid encounters for TLP servers is a lot of work, and it impacts our ability to deliver things to other EQ players."
everquest,3e45be,TheRoshen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:16:39 2015 UTC,but like.  We're better/more entitled than they are :)  Would instancing one expac per campaign be undoable?  With campaigns coming out every 6 months (and Lockjaw being 6 months at least) that lines up pretty closely with the consensus expac back style of instance plan.  DOing it now would have it taken care of and ready to go for tlp 4
everquest,3e45be,Maestro_M,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:04 2015 UTC,"It's not ""undoable."" However, whatever we're doing the team needs to look closely on how they're spending their time, and how their time can best be spent.  My concern with your suggestion of trying to fit instancing for TLP servers one expansion at a time, in between the releases of campaigns and other content, is what happens if we run out of time during one of these 6-month cycles before players unlock content? Doing TLP instancing the right way is a major time commitment, and I don't personally think doing it a few pieces at a time is the best solution.   The team also has to budget our time if we do want to do cool stuff like a no-boxing server, TLP 4, or something that Aristo would call Quarm.   TLDR: Everything we do has an opportunity cost. How can we spent our time on things that impact the greatest number of EverQuest players in the most awesome way?"
everquest,3e45be,TheRoshen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:44:41 2015 UTC,"So I guess my other post says why I think it's important,  but piecemeal is really not a bad way to do it.  Say you get classic and 2-3 kunark zones done before the devs just really get swamped this time around.  I, for one, would totally understand.  Y'all are busy.  I'm patient.  I'll be back for TLP 4.0 (and depending on how much pre-velious gets instanced, i'll stay on 3.0 till it dies out), when hopefully you guys can finish it off.  I'll play for the next 30 years if I can play on my own schedule.  YOu can keep buffing the raid targets and make THEM as hard as you want them to be.  I can deal with that.  I just don't want to deal with /ooc cesspool and hackers/griefers/trainers/sockers while I do it.  The game is perfect, the players are disgusting."
everquest,3e45be,Maestro_M,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"I totally understand and I really appreciate the responses :P  I guess you could say I'm kind of a single issue voter when it comes to the future of Everquest.  Instancing of classic content can be done now on (i'm really sorry to say it) a mess of a server, which can be a test for future servers.  Quarm would be awesome, but only if instanced.  Same with TLP 4, or a boxing server.  There's no reason to think of these as separate issues.  Everquest is only relevant in my mind if it has been instanced.  And I think a no-boxing server kind of ignores the big issue, which is that other players can deprive me of content.  If the game is instanced, that is no longer possible and a no-box server seems kinda not necessary.  I guess I see the future of Everquest being these novelty servers.  And people who come for the nostalgia are not going to come for TLP 4.0 if it looks just like TLP 3.0.  I would not have reactivated for TLP 3.0 if I had known it was going to be just as bad as it was."
everquest,3e45be,Maestro_M,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"but like. We're better/more entitled than they are :)   I realize you're being sarcastic, but this is the pushback against TLP now. You guys might want to curb that, then you might get support from non-TLP users. As it is right now, you're at 0."
everquest,3e45be,Laragon,3,Wed Jul 22 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"We realize that we're competing for resources.  I really wish we weren't.    I don't know how to ask the Developers to fix the early game on the most popular servers in Everquest history in a way that doesn't involve moving resources around.    What I won't do is tell you guys to go do something else.  To be perfectly honest, I was hoping that TLP 3.0 was going to be a way for me to get all the way up to whatever the current content was.  I wanna see the Everquest has been up to for the last 10 years or so, and I thought TLP would be a fun way to watch all of that while learning all of the new stuff.  I know its hard for you guys.  My hope is that they can instance this stuff now and when future novelty servers come out they can flip a switch and not really worry about all of the mumbo jumbo that comes with trying to fix a crazy oversubscribed launch.    Everquest is a great product.  If they approach TLP 3.0 as a learning experience then TLP 4.0 will have all of the fixes on Day 1 that took months of Dev time related to this launch (login queue, two servers, AFK timers??, load balancing of all zones, instanced raid content, guide support).    I totally understand that there is quite a bit of resentment from Live about TLP getting all of the attention and if our roles were reversed I'd probably be a little upset too.  That's why I'm not lobbying for raid content to be instanced right now all the time forever.  I'm happy with a slower roll-out.  I'm 100% in favor of a ""when we have time"" approach, as long as that actually means something.    Edit: I haven't seen the numbers, but I know for sure that you guys keep this game going.  Without the live base, there would be no TLPs.  Trust me when I say much love."
everquest,3e45be,Maestro_M,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:30:32 2015 UTC,How about you folks respond to people on live about nerfs to the mage class? No coding necessary! Just the ability to read and respond with your rationale!
everquest,3e45be,DMFT85,0,Wed Jul 22 13:05:40 2015 UTC,Why don't they just increase the spawn rate of the dragons and then enforce a guild rotation on them.  That way there is content without the need of instancing.  If guilds refuse to play nice they can just make the dragons spawn once a month :P

everquest,3e1mlw,atreyal,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:11 2015 UTC,Do what? The TLPs are the only servers with toxic environments.
everquest,3e1mlw,Laragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:50 2015 UTC,I can't speak for the normal servers. Haven't played in years. But with the tlp servers people are a lot ruder then they were back in the day. Just a product of mmos I think now. Back then it was smaller community and population. Seemed like people were a bit nicer in general. But who knows. Maybe I was younger and more tolerant of other people's bs. But I think it is more due to the sheer ease you can box now. No need to group when you can make you own. Eq2 could be the same could be Different. All I know is that it won't be as easy to box multiple characters without botting.
everquest,3e1mlw,atreyal,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, this batch of TLP servers has been especially toxic. Moreso than the last ones."
everquest,3e1mlw,Laragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"Well of course they are, because there are no PNP rules. Even normal people will be asshats if there's no police around."
everquest,3e1mlw,DarknessTemple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:34 2015 UTC,"They weren't enforced the last set either.

everquest,3e1mlw,trancefate,0,Tue Jul 21 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"I like EQ2 as well, but I don't know if it is really more casual.  Sure, the solo life is much more forgiving getting to max level, but all the raiding content is instanced.  That means if you want into a raiding guild, you have rigid raid times every single week.  If you don't raid often, or can't commit to full-time raiding, you get replaced."
everquest,3e1mlw,AS_99,0,Tue Jul 21 13:50:30 2015 UTC,"You can clear hardmode raid content on 8-12 hours a week. The same can't be said for raid content in EQ1 because 90% of your time is spent poopsocking, not actually attempting content."
everquest,3e1mlw,trancefate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"Casuals typically can't put in 8-12 hours a week on a static schedule, that's the issue.  No matter how casual EQ2 is considered, if you can't put in the time during those static hours, guilds have no use for you.  But in EQ1, large raiding guilds have the numbers for all hours of the day to give relief to poopsockers who have socks full of poop that need time to switch them out for clean ones.  You can be online for a few hours a night tops and have a chance to contribute."

There was also a lot of speculation as to the composition of the other raid, including at one point that it was a combined TL/Apok raid and that there were 50 mages warping in, etc.  If you wish to advance and progress, tasting blood should drive you to refine your raid to be better.  Seeing how fast a competitor can mobilize is not something complain about - it's a target to aim for.  Going just by the FP Stream, there was enough time to kill Innoruuk several times over before TL even arrived in force enough to compete, but some bad decisions were made and hopefully they learn from it."

everquest,3drwhm,BJUmholtz,7,Sun Jul 19 08:27:48 2015 UTC,"The only reason multi-boxing software is ""legal"" is because DBG doesn't have the resources to police it. The truth is that 3rd party software that gives you an advantage over other players is cheating, plain and simple. Just because DBG doesn't police it doesn't change the fact that its cheating in spirit and would get people banned in any other game out there.  This kind of 3rd party software gives one player the ability to be highly disruptive, and that is ultimately what the problem is.  I box 2 characters and my only ""tool"" is having dual monitors. Makes me positively sick when I see one character running around with 5-10 more in tow. I question myself every day I see crap like that why I'm paying DBG for this. EQ is a fantastic game but it is plagued by foolish management with the wrong priorities. I've definitely noticed a significant drop in players since Holly's ""casuals don't deserve it"" comments and the bot armies marching around like they own the game and can freely grief other players without consequence."

You can multibox in nearly every single MMO on the market and it's legit in the dev's eyes. Some even officially recommend ISBoxer for example.  Boxing exists in EQ like it does because any machine can do it and the game has lost 90% of its playerbase. There's a shitload of accounts around as well as a shitload of hardcore players that would rather pick up and go than shout for a tank for 2-3 hours.   I box 2 characters   So you're cheating?

everquest,3drwhm,Hellscreamgold,0,Sun Jul 19 20:14:18 2015 UTC,None?
everquest,3drwhm,trancefate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:56 2015 UTC,"Many professional gamers who play MOBAs like Dota 2 and League of Legends use keyboards with macro capabilities. In Dota 2 for instance this allows you to instantly poof all your Meepos at one time, or do crazy fast spell combos with Invoker. And it's not illegal.  I have a Logitech G710 keyboard which can macro, I've used it a little in Dota 2 but it won't make you win games without being good. In EQ I haven't used it at all and I'm pretty sure that it would NOT be as effective as using ISboxer or MQ2.  Don't confuse a macro keyboard and shady third party programs."
everquest,3drwhm,giantofbabil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:42:35 2015 UTC,"Actually the  better macro keyboards can actually automate stuff which is against the rules. ISBoxer actually does not. This is deliberate, the guy who makes ISBoxer wants it to not be outright banned from any major MMO--and it isn't. That's why in terms of automation it actually has less features than a good macro keyboard or the EQ built in macro system (which does let you automate within the scope of a five command macro and custom delay settings.) ISBoxer is a broadcaster, it doesn't automate anything. Your use of a macro keyboard is no different than an EQ player's use of ISBoxer, it gives you an advantage over ""vanilla"" players who only use a base keyboard and no third party tools. Your third party tool is a hardware solution with a built in macro system, but would technically violate the TOS of many games where ISBoxer does not."
everquest,3drwhm,PlagueMine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"The closest I could come to mimicking ISBoxer with my keyboard would be making a macro that does alt+tab 1, alt+tab 1, alt+tab 1 as many times as I'd need to. The difference between this and ISBoxer is when I hit that macro my screen is going to move between the different windows as it alt tabs, where ISBoxer has the displays graphically copied to the main window. ISBoxer is a much cleaner and easier to use interface for this purpose.  The ONLY thing a macro keyboard(at least mine) can do is do a series of keystrokes, it cannot manipulate the UI of a game. ISBoxer DOES manipulate the UI of a game. This is the big difference in my mind.  Also as I said I don't personally use my macro keyboard at all for EQ, I also don't box so I don't really have a reason to use it since the in game macro system fits all my needs perfectly. I also don't use my macro keyboard for games where it does give an unfair advantage, like using it to burst fire semi-auto weapons in FPS games(this is commonly done in H1Z1 using macro keyboards).  Can someone get a slight advantage using a macro keyboard in some situations, yes. In EQ does it give an equal advantage to ISBoxer, no but it could give a very slight advantage. I've read a lot posts lately though that say the APM required for someone to 6 box with no software is around 60-70 APM in EQ. This is nothing. If you play Starcraft 2 at all decent APM is considered to be ~100-120+, many pros hit 300+ APM regularly."
everquest,3drwhm,giantofbabil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean when you say it ""manipulates the UI of the game"" or that it ""has the displays graphically copied to the main window."" Inner Space allows you to run game clients (for lots of games) in customized window areas that are more seamless and easier to interact with than manually launching multiple clients and sizing the windows yourself. But that's not manipulating the UI of the game, the UI of the game are the buttons, interface elements and all the stuff built into the UI xml files by DBG. Inner Space manipulates the window the process runs in, but this is through operations of the base Microsoft Windows API and in no way alters EQ directly.  If your problem is that Inner Space lets you have multiple game windows nicely formatted on a single screen, that's honestly pretty ridiculous. Windows was built with the ability to do this kind of thing precisely because Microsoft doesn't believe in the concept of an application publisher determining for you how you can display your windows. Application publishers can decline to make windowing nice and seamless by default, but as you can see with how Inner Space works, you can always use the Windows API (well, or the Direct3D/OpenGL/etc api) itself to setup better windowing.  My point being ultimately, Inner Space is allowing you through windowing to do exactly what Microsoft intends--display applications in whatever windowed form you wish. They and DBG don't make it easy per se, but it's functionality built into Windows API itself that any application or user can implement."

everquest,3drwhm,Oh_Ma_Gawd,4,Sun Jul 19 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"""No one can effectively play 6 characters, it's just wrong""  Have to disagree with you. I've been boxing a very long time and 6 characters, especially in this era, is pretty trivial for me. I used to do 8 very effectively during HoT on live, with a TON more APM.  Trick is picking classes that lessens the burden .. Less melee, more 1 spell classes(think wizard) etc."
everquest,3drwhm,AmI_doingthis_right,0,Sun Jul 19 04:39:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. 6 boxing is at a maximum 120 APM or so. That's really not that much and you almost never even need that APM to work more efficiently than most all player groups. When I used to 6~18 box you would be effective at around 30-40apm for the 6 box and 70-80 for an 18 box in a fairly tense situation. Normally it was 20 apm for the 6. I mean what do you really do? Hit Q on your tank, every 5-10 seconds press 1 button on your healer. After X time passes press 1,1,1,1 on each of your DPS. Then press 2,2,2,2 to have them sit while you run and pull another mob."

You have no idea how many times I've experienced a botter march in the area and just take over everything like it belongs to them. Fucking sociopaths. If you want to multi-box, you need to do it like I do - without cheatware! Get as many monitors, keyboards, and PCs as you need and box all the characters you want - just do it manually - no cheatware allowed! Until DBG offers ISBoxer for download on their own servers and from the EQ Website, it is still a 3rd party cheat.  If you think ISBoxer isn't cheating, let me put it this way. Pick an MMORPG - any one of them. Sign up for the forums, and ask this question: ""Can I use 3rd party software to enhance my gameplay and give me an advantage over other players?"" The answer will be a resounding ""NO!"" because that kind of behavior is cheating, and that is EXACTLY what ISBoxer is doing for its users."

I 6 boxed for years and started out with just 3 keyboards, 3 mice and 1 autohotkey macro that turned alt+tab into 1 button. My boxes ran just fine. EQ is not a high APM game. Spells cast in multiples of seconds and there's a GCD + a spell CD. It's roughly 3 seconds per action so 20apm per toon. The whole box is 120APM at a maximum. That's about gold league (not very good) for starcraft 2.  But really with ISboxer you can be far more effective than a group of 6 people at the keyboards now. It's literally better in a lot of cases. Not all, but a lot. Focusing DPS at the drop of a dime with no communication barrier is a big deal for example. Nearly every group XP situation a box with even a half assed set up is going to trash a player group assuming they don't do things like have mages in cloth armor at level 50 (which they all do usually)."

everquest,3drwhm,Invisible-Gorilla,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"I play on Lockjaw where I don't box very often, mainly focus on one character for nostalgia purposes. I have a lot more of the money that matters (RL U.S. Dollars) so I don't have to spend 80 hours a week doing krono farms and I'm happy for that. But I don't understand the hate being directed at those who are playing the game by the rules but just in a way you ""dislike.""  The reality is this particular round of TLPs has a lot of people that thought EQ1 was like WoW where you never have to worry about other players and get fully instanced everything. That isn't what EQ1 was about in classic, and to be honest while six boxing wasn't common (having a boxed teleporter or rezzer was not rare, though) due to technology limitations in era what was common was the hardcore players from top guilds dominating all of the highly desired camps.   The belief that all the casuals would magically be able to camp efreeti or Fire Giants to their heart's content if the evil ISBoxer magically went away is just not true. Trust me, those of us willing to play hardcore would just make sure guild groups camped these spots all the time. Your access would not be improved if grisvok was disallowed from using ISBoxer."

Whether to convert that into real money or to just add more plat to your accounts.  You single handedly prevent anyone else from camping where you are because you have the ability to run several accounts with the click of a button.  Were you to have the ability to run all of those accounts via legit means I would say kudos to you, but the way it is done is unsavory.

Sure MQ does allow too much automation, but for myself and many others, I use it very casually. The only reason I use MQ is for the better map - it shows all mobs and just makes it easier to find certain vendors occasionally. Even on forums that promote afk macros on live servers, people advise against afk botting on TLP servers."
everquest,3drwhm,Hellscreamgold,3,Sun Jul 19 08:49:50 2015 UTC,"It's sad when I see people on the live forums defending this guy, and I notice that guy Jaime Lannister, and I can state for a fact that he uses MQ for boxing. Hell, go to the TL web page. Go to the forums and click on applications. One of the questions is, how many players will you ""bot"" along with your main. Not ""box,"" but ""bot."" But sure, let's just keep ignoring the giant elephant in the room. Thats why I'm already gone at least.  Honestly, I think the fact that you think you ""are not part of the problem,"" is the same mentality which has led to such widespread use. MQ is illegal on EQ Live, period. However, it's not enforced. Even when it is enforced, people know that they won't be banned on their first use, even if they get caught. But people parade it around as ISBoxer, or say they only use it for maps, and then expect people to understand. Let me tell you this, the people who were suspended the other week for MQ2 were banned for their use of MQ2Map. It did not however, seem to flag the botters who were in zones like Runnyeye at using MQ.  Here's the thing, on the live servers, or on the EQEmu server I play on, MQ is not an issue. On live servers its not an issue because most content is instanced and you won't interfere with others play by using MQ (or at least not nearly on the same level.) Also, considering so much higher % of a gear in Classic is tradable, it exacerbates the problem. On emu servers, it's not as much of a problem, because MQ use helps to make up for a low population. On Titan, we probably have somewhere 50-100 players (it goes down during the summer), but of those only maybe 20 are on at a time. With a server of such low pop, MQ helps because it makes it easier for people to box 6 (or more) and take down raid targets they wouldn't be able to otherwise (on a legit emu server, at least)."

everquest,3dm6wv,ikeaEmotional,0,Sun Jul 19 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the thing. ALL the big guilds use it, if you think otherwise you are just being intentionally ignorant. A LOT of the regular ""casuals"" use it too, just not to the point the power guilds do. Does DBG care?  Yeah, they probably do, buy they don't care ENOUGH to do anything about it. If they cared enough, they would run EQ on more than just an anemic skeleton crew of people, but their profits are more important than the game experience of the users. By not downloading MacroQuest2 you are putting yourself at a huge disadvantage, mostly economically wise. A lot of the MQ2 users are DISGUSTINGLY rich in-game, and a lot of them sell what they make in-game in RMTS, in terms of THOUSANDS $$ per month.   Sorry, I know I ranted a little bit.   TL;DR - Download MQ2 if you want to play on a EVEN playing field, DBG doesn't care enough to do anything about it."

The only exception is Apok, but in fairness I think theyve weeded out the bad apples who were using MQ2 for raids."

TBH as someone who usually plays at that level, nobody is. nobody boxing 6 or more or killing bosses is in it for the experience or nostalgia. it stopped being about peen or firsts or content etc. long ago.  this is about cash! and DB upped the pop #s to the point where now you're looking at $5000 in krono a week if you can drop every single  spawn and get lucky on drops. sorry but with that kinda cash at stake nobody is going to play fair. just ONE RBB and one COF (20 krono ea)  is enough to fund 40 chars for a month.  DB created an RMT environment so everyone is cheating to make fun money. unfortunately you have to blame DB for letting it happen.  if you have the time and the means to play at that level and DB is not stopping you, you're giving up hundreds of dollars  a day by not doing it and for a lot of the aspies here that is just not an option."

DB made the whole thing a joke.   krono run the server. DB should ban boxing software if they care about the integrity of the server but they don't give two shits because rich white thirtysomethings are coming home from work thirsty for nostalgia and buying hundreds of bucks in krono from them and from the player base. crystalline spears are 12 krono+, crooks are 8-10, random armor drops in hate are going for 3-5 krono ea and at wholesale price thats still $35 a pop cash. $35 for a piece of gear that frankly does not even matter for this content at all.

everquest,3dn28g,spyder11,10,Fri Jul 17 16:35:49 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no it is not cheating or wrong.   Boxing is basically a requirement to experience some older content that is not from the current expansion unless you have some very coordinated friends and it is generally good to have even in current content to build groups etc.. While EQ is best experienced with friends, there is nothing wrong with boxing as long as you don't use that advantage (yes it is an advantage most of the time unless you are competing with players who always have full groups) to abuse or hurt the play of others.  The current TLP Boxing hate is a the result of people abusing that advantage. It is not really a boxing problem so much as a people problem tied to limited resources. Boxing just better enables the scumbags in being scumbags."
everquest,3dn28g,luzon59,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:32 2015 UTC,I tried running 2 accounts. a healer type and a warrior. I didnt use any clever macros or hardware. It wasn't to bad because it stopped a stupid amount of downtime on a tlp server that has no regeneration items in game. Just a quick heal saves like 10 minutes of waiting. It worked but was kinda boring. Unfortunately getting a group is kinda hard it seems on my server no matter what class you are. I pretty much stopped playing altogether because of it. It was tons of fun when you get a group going. The thing is that hardly ever happens. People wonder why there are so many boxers. If there was more groups around you wouldn't need them. I would try a regular server but there are so many expansions and AAs and everything else its just to overwhelming to even bother. I love the  time locked progression servers but there seems to be more bots then real people at low levels. Oh well at least by not playing ive gained 16 hours of my day back.

everquest,3dn28g,PlagueMine,2,Sat Jul 18 14:38:56 2015 UTC,"You'll eventually not be playing EZ mode as he gets close to your druid in level, but as a guy who has a necro main I can tell you that you can basically solo to 105.  And I mean true solo, I recently came back to the game and the necro is such a powerful solo class that in many zones I parse more xp per hour than I do trying to molo, because I can solo so effectively that the 40% xp hit from having a mercenary in the group isn't worth it. Obviously these are all zones where the mobs can be snared and do not summon."

everquest,3djjza,Polyformist,3,Fri Jul 17 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I recall a camp my friends and I use to frequent in Kunark days.  As a Bard at the time,  I was the official puller, we had a very efficient system of death setup with a few characters present at the Forest Giant Camp in Burning woods i think.  Large open kiting field, leading around a fort with giants.  We had many hilarious moments..    *Shaman ~ cana dances below 10%  (all the giants run to shammy!)  *Bard Hits tree ~ Some times with dozens of giants wax bard ""keep in mind bard was running at lightning speeds and corpse shoots out other side of tree""  *Paladin ~ on auto follow behind bard auto attacking random giants, falls asleep at keyboard during kites........ Bard camps, Pally randomly standing in forest.... did he make noises when he dies??  *Bard ~ hand cramps running off into forest!  shaman yells for more pulls!"

everquest,3diuww,dan42183,2,Thu Jul 16 16:59:48 2015 UTC,The thing that a lot of players and even the EQ dev's don't understand is that adding any AE to the dragons is pointless. The reason the revamped dragons can be maged down is specifically because of a geometry exploit that allows pets to attack the dragons THROUGH WALLS thereby avoiding the AE entirely.
everquest,3diuww,ZaideGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:47:33 2015 UTC,Same reason they wont revert pets to if they kill something without the owner/another players help the mob's corpse poofs.
everquest,3diuww,Brolie351,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:21 2015 UTC,It would punish the hundreds of legitimate players using pet classes in an effort to stave off abuse by the few.  Something closer to a real solution is to have raid bosses automatically summon the owner to the pet to them when the pet they are targeting reaches the top of the hate list.
everquest,3diuww,req101,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"guys, listen...  they could 'do' tons of things but any major change could equal a huge drop in subs, and they can't afford that. RMT/krono drives the server and the guys doing that are making up like half the subs right now i bet.   casuals are casuals (i am this time around) and they say they'll re-sub/come back if xyz gets changed, but they never do. by then they're already too invested in final fantasy crossyroad 17craft to come back to EQ. EQ is the most burnout-prone MMO ever, even for the no-lifers. go on any big guild's forum right now and you'll see people announcing that they're already AFKing for the rest of summer or til kunark or whatever.  lots of casual players are already gone and the next sub re-up is this weekend, when tons more will leave.   it is really hard to retain subs in a 16 year old game that the management can barely afford to keep afloat. nostalgia wears off quick on the guys who haven't played in ten years. they come back, roll a warrior or a rogue without boxing (hard as fuck), refuse to twink with krono, get nowhere and quit.  lockjaw will pull a vulak by the fall.  DB isn't making ANY sweeping changes to pets or boxing or krono or PNP right now because they simply don't have the power to do so. if they piss off the wrong demographic they're gonna hemorrhage subs.  between holly and smed they've already alienated a ton of players over the past 3 weeks. they're taking babycakes tinysteps, which is better than nothing!  tl;dr DB has like five dollars to spend on TLPS and you should just be happy you got guides.  pets are gonna pet"

I disagree with you on this subject. Of course it's hard to retain subs when your player base is unhappy. You say it's hard to retain subs because nostalgia wears off, but I say it's hard to retain subs just because Ragefire is extremely toxic, and couldn't be any further from being nostalgic.  It's simple supply vs demand. Right now there is simply too much demand and not nearly enough supply. This is one reason I push for raid instancing. It is absolutely true that I have about a 10 percent or less chance of resubbing within the next couple of months. However,  if they instanced raids, I definitely would come back; it's not a lie when I say that.  I'm not spending my time on any other game, I left TLP and went back to the pleasant Emu server I've always played on. DBG had a chance to get a lot of money from me, but as it stands they'll have to settle for 14.99.  PS Anyone who loves PoP/LDoN/GoD in era is welcome to join us on EQTitan. Website with ruleset and forum is at eqtitan.com . The developers do an extremely good job of keeping titan faithful to its original source. PM me for more info or if you are on Titan, my mains IGN is Steamroller."
everquest,3diuww,fryzoid,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"On top of that, the people who have been subbed and have been actually playing the game and paying the bills while everyone else has been off playing final fantasy crossyroad 17craft are fed up with this point at the amount of attention that the new TLP servers have been getting. They haven't got new content since November, and it's painfully obvious that the devs have been spending more time on Ragefire than they did on Fippy/Vulak and Combine/Sleeper when those four launched.  Those people don't see the people playing and enjoying themselves because they have no interest in the TLP servers. They've probably been there, did that once or twice now and aren't interested in a third go round. All they see are the complainers and the people acting like Daybreak owes them something for graciously handing them the first $15 they've put in since 2002. The devs also have to work a thin line between putting in things that the TLP servers need and not alienating the people actually paying the bills. They're aware that most TLP subs are short term cash infusions and not people coming back to play for an extended period, and they don't want to lose the people who have been playing for years for people who are going to cancel their sub in six months anyway."

The real problem is that the top poopsockers, you can decide for yourself who they are, will not align with or help anyone. My guild has allied with other guilds and done raids together and it's been great, but doing the raid bosses is near impossible because some ""top level"" guilds full of six boxers and MQ users will DPS race you and win no matter what."
everquest,3diuww,giantofbabil,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:17 2015 UTC,"unfortunately if you also cheat, you can beat them. nobody likes cheating, not even the top guys, but 1 dragon kill that has an RBB and a few other top items can be worth ~40 krono or more! that is gtc for the whole month for 40 chars.   when one dragon kill is worth $500 and they're spawning almost every day now, people are gonna cheat. DB dumbly increased the spawn timers which only increased sock power.  DB has $5000+ of krono dropping every week game-wide now so of course people are gonna try monopolize it any way they can. it is free money!  instancing the kills and making the loot NODROP would be good for the players, but dat krono engine is what is keeping EQ afloat. they are keeping the krono game alive on purpose, and that is the best business decision for DB right now. it is generating big krono sales for DB and keeps the content carrot dangling for as long as it can for everyone else."
everquest,3diuww,jagarr,0,Fri Jul 17 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be classic, though!  Everyone knows that back in 1999 the very first Nagafen and Vox kills were done by armies of mage boxers.  This server has to maintain the nostalgia."
