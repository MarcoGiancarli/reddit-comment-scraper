ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,Naptural90,8,Mon Jul 13 11:35:21 2015 UTC,"anyone that would turn you down based on race alone is an asshat and you shouldn't waste your time with them no matter what your race is.  Anyway, you sound like a cool geek chick but I play on PC and don't like anime so, the best of luck to you."
ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,NegitiveSinX,10,Mon Jul 13 13:43:51 2015 UTC,Ass hat here. Can confirm.

ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,DongLord5000,0,Mon Jul 13 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with this; some people just aren't attracted to certain races, in the physical sense. Saying someone is cool, but you're not attracted to them physically for one reason or another doesn't make you an ass hat."
ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,NegitiveSinX,3,Fri Jul 17 13:50:31 2015 UTC,No it does and here's why. Until recently I'd had never met any hispanics that weren't low class/ghetto because of where I live. Thanks to the internet I've met several hispanic women who aren't like that at all and I find them VERY attractive. Therefore personality isn't based on skin color at all. If you class people together by their race and not their personality than you are an asshat. And if you don't find someone physically attractive because of their skin color than you're also an asshat. Who they are is so much more important than physicality.
ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,steelsuirdra,5,Fri Jul 17 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"Guys, being into the same stuff as her is great, but you need more than just ""hey I play that too!"" Personality us important! As for people having problem with you being black, that is absurd, but people are attracted to different things."
ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,KTot,3,Mon Jul 13 16:44:27 2015 UTC,I know your pain. I feel like once anyone finds out I'm mixed race they kind of disappear.

ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,wycarnfife,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:22:08 2015 UTC,Lol it's all so stupid. An Indian guy messaged me saying the same thing. I really didn't realize Indian guys were discriminated against when it comes to dating too. :<
ForeverAloneDating,3d477e,LuchaMode,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:27 2015 UTC,TBf I think it is because a lot of Indian guys FROM India tend to be a bit aggressive with how they talk to women... Might be a cultural thing?
