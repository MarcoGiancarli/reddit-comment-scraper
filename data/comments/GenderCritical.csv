And if so, I wonder if there is a way to communicate, somehow, that we aren't out to drive all trans people to suicide by preventing their surgeries, and that pretending we are is setting up a straw feminist to tear down.   There might be, but not every transactivist will believe you, no matter what you say. Some of them seem to believe that the very fact that you believe woman is a biological reality and not an identity means you want to exterminate trans people, so I doubt reasoning with them is possible."

Often not optimally healthy, but if they are adults, they are free to make their own decisions.    Of course we are not trying to make anyone commit suicide. I find this idea particularly abhorrent, and it appears to be made up out of whole cloth by these online trans activists.  I don't believe that preventing their surgeries would cause their suicides; however, I am not in favor of banning any of these procedures either.  The problem  with communicating this idea is that none of them listen to what we are actually saying.

Most aren't going to say a trans woman shouldn't be allowed to transition. Simply that it's not going to make her a woman.  I am of the view that a trans woman is a trans woman. She's not a 'man', but she's not a woman in the same way I am a woman, either. She's just trans. Gender is a spectrum after all."

I also think transition can be an appropriate treatment for autogynephilia because fetishes don't go away from what I understand. I think some of the 'homosexual' mtts (straight transwomen) might be able to embrace their male identity if they changed their pov, especially if they're trans because they're from a religious conservative background, not that I think they should have to try. But of the two autogynephilia seems more incurable, so to speak.   That doesn't mean that mtts don't have different issues than females, though there is some overlap. And however inconvenient it may be for treatment of gid in males, real females still exist and we have our own interests. We shouldn't be obligated to accept a version of reality and femaleness that doesn't make sense to us, that doesn't help us describe or understand our experiences of being female. We shouldn't have to abandon sex-based feminist analysis because of a few mens' medical hijinks. That's their private issue.  On the other hand, I don't see how it can be ethical to  prescribe a treatment that requires the public at large to collectively agree to perceive the patient in a way that differs from reality. Seriously how effective can treatment that requires no one see the emperor has no clothes be? It's a treatment that's incompatible with reality in general and the reality of women's lives as they are now in particular. And of course women are just expected to deal with any consequences of activism based on inconsistent often contradictory  ideas that clash with reality."

Not to mention I love that they think 'walking vaginas' is what radical feminism boils women down to, when they consider women to be walking ephemeral entities with no characteristics (besides the sexist ones that they insist don't actually make a woman but they just happen to fulfill them so that people will call them a woman.  uhhh...what?).

Then it means ""complete equality"" can't be achieved, and I agree with this: I have always supported men and women's equal RIGHTS but I have never believed in ""equality of the sexes"" because we have different bodies. This is also why I think the opinion of a man on abortion carries less weight than a woman's opinion. ""Liberation"" sounds like the best description of feminism: liberating women from the after-effects of thousands years of male domination should be the priority of feminism.  As for serving in the armed forces: what you say is interesting, I've already heard this from MRAs and I've always wondered if it's really that bad to have more soldiers in combat even if they aren't as physically strong as we expect...?  EDIT: I forgot to say the ""equality"" ideology is the same used by many transgender activists: we're so equal males and females don't exist anymore.

Since male violence is what is responsible for wars and such, then do we need armed forces if patriarchy is truly gone?   Realistically that is probably a pipe dream, because even with patriarchy gone there will always be megalomaniacs/religious extremists/etc. who are power-hungry, but a system without patriarchy would certainly make it more difficult for such people to operate.

But it's a mistake I personally often make to think male domination is the root of all evil and without it, the world would be a beautiful and peaceful place. A world without wars requires much more than ""dismantling the patriarchy"": that would only change the fact that woman will no longer be treated as the property of man. Men have created societies and cultures that benefit them compared to women but in a context of sex-equality or even female domination, power-hungry people and jealousy/envy of other's territories and properties would still exist.  Basically, pacifists are the people who should be thinking about ways to end wars while taking into consideration feminist analysis because it will definitely help, but I don't think world peace is a feminist cause, unless you think only world peace will liberate women (which is probably right...)."

GenderCritical,3e207o,spiby,11,Tue Jul 21 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"There are no ""transfemales"" because you cannot actually change biological sex. Feminism is about the fight against sex-based oppression, which are things like women being trafficked for sexual slavery, FGM, medications not being studied properly on women, and --very importantly, IMO-- the idea that there are preferences, behaviors, etc. that are ""uniquely female"", such as being submissive, liking high heeled shoes,  and being  bad at math. The last one is one that the trans ideology actively enforces, so it is totally at odds with feminism. If you want examples of this, you can read posts either on here or on /r/gender_critical about how trans people regularly cite sexist stereotypes as proof of their ""inner woman"".  That said, (radical) feminism is not a ""hate group"" against men or trans people, as trans and MRAs would like you to believe. In fact, we believe that male socialization (""toxic masculinity"" -- the different way that people of the male sex are treated since even before birth) is the source of things like the much higher male murder rate and the entitled attitudes of men.   We also think this same toxic socialization, I.e. not allowing men to express emotion,  is a big part of what causes men to ""identify as women"". It is the only way a lot of people can see out of their socialization. Often it is also tangled up psychologically with sex stereotypes and sexual fetishes, but at its roots trans ideology is a way for trans people to explain why they have always felt ""wrong"" in their role and how society treats them , which is what we call ""gender"".  Gender is an oppressive system that forces women to act submissive and men to act dominant. It forces women to be nurturing and men to repress their emotions. It's a system that denies individual personalities in favor of stereotypes -- a nurturing man is ""less manly"" and a dominant woman is ""less womanly"". Gender is what we hate and what we are critical of, because it requires above all else an artificial performance of femininity to be a woman when all that should be required is to be born female and to be yourself.  The liberation of women from gender is true feminism."

Agreed.  A male starts feeling emotional, thinks there's something wrong with him, and concludes that he must be a woman to ""fix"" the problem.  In doing so he is promoting women as lesser and being feminine as a problem."

GenderCritical,3e207o,antigenderist,10,Wed Jul 22 04:15:18 2015 UTC,"To be equal to subjugators is to desire to be a subjugator oneself.  That's why ""equality feminism"" is a VERY white movement--white women certainly find being equal to white men to be a more desirable goal than WOC find being equal to MOC.  ""Equalism"" is a movement of white women who want to be able to do the same acts of subjugation as white men, but acts of subjugation require someone to be the subjugated.  Typically, under white ""equality"" feminism, that ""someone"" is darker-skinned, poorer, and from a developing country.  You can be a CEO just like a man, ladies, but men aren't going to be stay-at-home dads to accommodate you.  You'll have to hire a nanny and a maid."

Feminism is about ending the oppression of women, first and foremost.  Women are oppressed by men.  This appears to be universal, although this doesn't make it ""right"" or ""natural"" in any way.    This is actually my problem with the trans movement.  Thousands of years of oppression, and somebody thinks that he can buy hormone treatments, surgeries, or simply ""self-identify"" as female and think he can understand anything about what it is like?  It is offensive.  Yes, my opinion is going to put off a lot of people, probably you, because it doesn't put men at the center or talk about equality in a world set up to be completely unequal."
GenderCritical,3e207o,radishe,5,Tue Jul 21 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"To address the first part of your discussion, the term feminist comes from the fact that the feminist movement is defined as ""the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of equality of the sexes.""   So yes, it is centered on the female side of things because historically (and still today) the majority of inequality between the sexes has disadvantaged women, but the ultimate goal is equality.  I roll my eyes when people say they aren't a feminist, because yeah, that means either you believe women are already treated equally (or better) than men or it means you don't think women deserve equal treatment. Or it means you don't understand what feminism is.   But having said that, I don't scoff when someone says they are also egalitarian or whatever word they so choose, because there are a lot of questions of equality that you could say fall outside of the jurisdiction of feminism (depending on your definition), or that would be better approached though another lens.   So let's say there was a group made up of masculinists or whatever they want to be called, who advocated for men's rights on the basis of equality of the sexes and focused on getting more men into traditional female jobs, better paternity leave laws, allowing men to adopt or express traditionally feminine traits with being ridiculed or their gender questioned etc etc then that's great, I'm all for that. I would actually support that. But I would also continue to support feminism, which I think has both further to go and more battles to fight.   That's just my opinion though, I'm not sure if everyone here will agree and perhaps someone can provide better insight. I also haven't addressed your second question, but hopefully someone will soon."

Apparently Shapiro's words are 'assault' and 'violence' meanwhile threatening to curb stomp him is an appropriate and normal reaction to 'provocation'. What the fuck. This is victim-blaming. Apparently Tur isn't a grown-ass man who can control himself and can only react with violence when 'provoked' and it's Shapiro's fault for not groveling to Tur's delusional self-image.  I don't give a crap how conservative Shapiro is or isn't or whether or not he was insulting. Threats and putting your hands on someone are not an appropriate reaction. Ever. There is no excuse.

Ben first speaks at 1:25 but does not say anything to or directed at Tur. He speaks again at 4:00 questioning the celebration of delusion. Tur then brings up an irrelevant point about klinefelter's syndrome which spurs Shapiro to reply ""What are your genetics (inaudible sir)?"" at 5:28. This was the only statement which can be interpreted as an insult directed at Tur. Then by 5:35 Tur had already finished making her first threat.  so it actually took less than 7 seconds between the ""insult"" of calling Tur ""sir"" and the threat of violence to take place. Even if you consider the beginning of the insult as Shapiro saying ""for what?"" the first moment he spoke (which you can not), that was still a time span of 4 minutes, nowhere close to what the article is claiming. It is a lie designed to paint the situation as something it was not. To make it seem that Shapiro was verbally attacking Tur for 10 minutes before a reaction happened.    Tur responded by putting a hand on his shoulder and saying, “you should cut that out now, or you’ll go home in an ambulance.”   Here are 2 more blatant lies designed to soften the threat made by Tur. This as presented as if Tur is giving some friendly advice when in reality Tur grabbed Shapiro by the neck. Tur then made the threat and nver used the word ""should"". Tur gripped Shapiro by the neck and pulled him in 6 inches from her face and said ""you cut that out now, or you’ll go home in an ambulance.""   Breitbart News is also reporting that “Tur tweeted out on Friday that he would like to “curb stomp” Shapiro   This is presented as if it is an unverifiable claim being made up by Breitbart. It was on twitter, you can easily post an image of the tweet as you did with all of the responses you selected which were supporting Shapiro.  Hack journalism."

He and Lopez make the case that children should be allowed to present in any gender they choose, but they firmly object to any form of medical intervention, including drugs that delay or block the effects of puberty.  However, when asked what specifically should be done to help girls and boys struggling with their gender expression as they enter puberty, having to deal with developing breasts, beard growth, and other secondary sex characteristics, Cummings’s response falls short:  “People need to accept themselves for who they are … to accept the fact of who they were born as.”   Falls short in what sense?  I realize Advocate is hardly unbiased, but jeez.  What's wrong with helping children accept (and maybe even cherish) the body they were born in?"

The outspoken lesbian activist and feminist, labeled a TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) by The Advocate and other publications, agreed to come to the defense of perhaps the most hated trans man on earth.    YOU ARE ""The Advocate"" like holy shit you cant cite your own opinion as source for calling someone a name   (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  then theres the comments.   Aura Willow Hazel · Manchester, United Kingdom  PBS? seriously? Why not ask fox news for an unbiased view while you're at it?   are you kidding? of course not.   Natalie Graham  Also, how is transgender treatment driven by profit in places such as here in the UK where the treatment is provided by a free to use health service and people are having to wait for more than a year just to access a first appointment as the demand for the service far outstrips the supply? One of the NHS Health boards here in the UK carried out a study into the costs of providing trangender medical care and found that for every patient treated the cost saving over providing health care to deal with the results of unresolved gender dysphoria represented an average of £9000 per patient. If the private health care sector was out to make a profit from transgender patients they would be better off not offering transgender treatments at all and raking in the profits from therapy and anti-depressant drugs to deal with the consequences.   this person must be mentally disabled. how can it be profit driven when medical care is free in the UK? are you ok?  then you point out how the demand is greater than supply and that untreated dysphoria is more expensive. so basically gender doctors will never have a lack of supply and also by leaving a pool of untreated people it fuels a profit motive for other doctors to treat the fallout in whatever way they do for whatever reason. also i thought everything was free?"

That's like saying that the increasing rate of caesareans has nothing to do with money either because reasons!!  It does. It costs more for a caesarean birth.

But you need to pick that person carefully; I would suggest you meet with the doctor you're considering first by yourself, to gauge whether their values are right for your family before dragging your daughter to a doctor who might be a fundamentalist whack job. Don't find a gender specialist, their specialty is in transing.  As for your daughter, anything you say right now she's going to push back against. She's 15. So it might be in your best interest to compromise, so that she feels supported and not like she's fighting against you every step of the way. She wants to change her name; would you be comfortable calling her by a different name? People physically can't choose their gender, but our names are part of our identity we actually do have some control over. You could ask to be part of picking out a name she likes better, if naming your kid is important to you (which it quite understandably could be.) Let her have control over the parts of her identity she can change, like her name, hair, and way she dresses, but reinforce that it's not possible to become a man; she will spend the rest of her life as a transman, on hormones, sterile, at elevated risk of all sorts of bad things from testosterone. She will never father children. Love her, but don't deny reality for her; she needs you reminding her that the messages she's getting from the media are ads just like the ones you probably taught her to tell apart from cartoons when she was younger, and no amount of drugs and surgery can actually make a woman a man."

After all, you're gong to meet the person one-on-one before you let your daughter in the same room as them.  There are, sadly, very few doctors who will push back against the trans agenda; the fear of being labelled a ""transphobe"" and professionally ruined is intense.

Cutting your hair or going by a new name will be forgotten in 10 years, hormones and surgery won't (and will make her health crap down the road, and not just in a ""I fucked up my knees"" kind of way).

Sex is a biological classification based on reproductive role. Can't get any more scientific than that.   I don't have access to any of those paywalls. If someone has access to these databases, it would be interesting to see if there are studies that show the opposite - biochemistry remaining more in line with the controls of the same sex, rather the the opposite sex.   A friend of mine who is a bio scientist pointed out something interesting to me the other day. If you're doing a study like this and you find that MtFs show marked similarity to female controls, that is new and interesting information and thus likely to be published. If you do a study and it shows the opposite, that MtF biochemistry is more in line with male control biochemistry, it's not really new or interesting info, because we already expect males to have male biochemistry.

The prevailing sex steroid milieu, not genetic sex, is a significant determinant of the sex difference in serum leptin levels.   Serum leptin levels? Who cares? Leptin levels don't determine sex.   Regarding the resources, these studies test parameters while the MtFs are receiving hormone therapy.

Male and female are not biological classifications at all! Naw, you just pick whatever definition you like even though that's not how it works.  If you have male reproductive organs you are male. Hormonal changes due to taking/blocking hormones is not much of a surprise and they don't make you sorta female or whatever it is you're trying to get at.    The literature clearly shows that there is a massive, fundamental biochemical change, at the cellular level for transgender people on hormone therapy. Most of the biological medical differences between the sexes, (apart from obvious exceptions like reproductive organs), come down to hormones, not genetics. This is why HRT produces such dramatic and profound effects on fundamental biochemistry.   These are some bold statements. Is this actual scientific consensus or is this person jumping to conclusions based on a handful of studies that may or may not have been replicated?

Because everyone would spend so much time and effort enjoying and sharing whatever stuff, and mostly giving or trading it away in the end so someone else could enjoy it.  Like most of the art we did in art class featured characters and scenes we hoped someone else might appreciate. Another girl would even write fanfics to share on DeviantArt or for birthdays.

I theorize that most of these men are really just sexually submissive and they consider it a threat to their masculinity so they throw in the desire to be women.  I see MtTs talk about wanting to be the girls they find attractive.  On some level this could be curiosity, but I think it stems from jealousy that pretty girls supposedly have it easy.

Even if there were women aroused by their own bodies that's not the same as being a male aroused by thinking of himself as female.

GenderCritical,3dqxx9,roomroomroomroom,18,Sat Jul 18 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"The problem with choosey choice feminism is best illustrated in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe:   A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips.  ""Good evening,"" it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, ""I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in the parts of my body?""  ""You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?"" whispered Trillian to Ford.  ""That's absolutely horrible,"" exclaimed Arthur, ""the most revolting thing I've ever heard.""  ""What's the problem Earthman?"" said Zaphod, now transferring his attention to the animal's enormous rump...""Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten,"" said Zaphod.  ""Look,"" said Zaphod, ""we want to eat, we don't want to make a meal of the issues. Four rare stakes please, and hurry. We haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years.""  The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. ""A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,"" it said, ""I'll just nip off and shoot myself.""   The story is disrupting because the reader knows the cow was made to feel that way. The cow never made a choice, of its own free will, to be eaten. It was engineered by those with power to desire something that is innately bad for it.  The analogy doesn't translate literally to choosey choice feminism, but it sheds light on the problem. When you grow up socialized to behave a certain way, choosing anything else is harder than choosing the default. You can't say women just choose to wax and stay at home, because the alternative choice is not made in equal context. Women are paid less than men and have their appearances policed. Women who wear makeup make more money than those who don't. It's not like women who wear green shirts get paid more than women who wear red shirts. The choice to wear or not to wear makeup is not an equal choice. One ""choice"" is incentivized over the other.  Feminists don't criticize individual lives, but we do analyze the context the life takes place in. When someone insists their personal choices are political, such as ""lipstick is feminist!"", that declaration is going to be criticize. You cannot ignore the role that male sexual preferences and capitalism has in shaping the choices that are available to women in the first place."
GenderCritical,3dqxx9,a_socialist_feminist,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"I like and agree with the analogy, but isn't ""choice"" feminism preposterous on its face?

If I make a choice to be a career criminal, is that a feminist choice because a woman chose it?    I'm pretty sure most ""choice"" feminists (I call them ""consent"" feminism too) would say those choices can be feminist because if you chose something, it means you actually want and/or enjoy that thing. Funny because a lot of men and MRAs actually agree with the fact everything a woman does is her choice and thus she should be held responsible: a woman chose to stay in an abusive relationship? She's responsible for what happened to her then. A girl chose to hang with a bunch of male friends? She's responsible if something bad happened.  a lot of ""choice"" feminists are women refusing to aknowledge there can be something wrong with women's choices (because criticizing a woman is not feminist ofc) and trying to free themselves from having to defend other women: being a feminist is exhausting because it requires liberating women from patriarchal influence but all these feminists have to do is say ""if she said yes there's no problem, if she said no then it's wrong!"". That's why they don't have the tools to criticize porn and prostitution: a woman saying yes out of despair is still saying yes. They don't do the hard work: learning women to say no, the way boys are taught it's ridiculous to submit to others.  I used to be one of these feminists.

On this sub, there's a lot of gender/sexual essentialism that tries to create a clear dividing line based on reproductive organs. People will say, ""a woman is defined by a uterus and her ability to get pregnant. Anyone who doesn't have or never had this ability is not a real woman. Full stop.""  What happens if medical technology advances to the point of smashing this barrier? At some point, it becomes downright absurd to point to someone who is literally carrying a child, giving birth, breastfeeding them, and raising them as their mother, and replying, ""well...well..none of that matters! All that matters is what someone is at birth!""  To me this is quite absurd. It's like defining a quadriplegic not as someone who cannot currently move their limbs, but as someone who, at any point in time, could never move their limbs. If we develop the technology to heal spinal cord fractures, I think it would be absurd to claim that such a person is still quadriplegic, when they're able to move all their limbs just fine.   Or, if you move the goalposts and say, ""ok, uterus doesn't matter, it's genetics!"" What if we eventually learn how to use retroviruses to completely swap out chromosomes?   If you claim, ""female socialization from a young age"" is what matters, well there are people who transition from a young age. The downside of the socialization definition is that then you would also end up defining a certain number of natal women as males. For example, consider these girls in Afghanistan.. By the socialization essentialism definition, these individuals are male.   My ultimate point is that I believe all essentialism definitions, based on some single criterion in the past, to be hopelessly flawed. If I take a boat, break it down into planks, and use it to create a house, it is still a house, not a boat. It doesn't retain some magical, immutable, supernatural characteristic of ""boatness"" that will keep it defined as a boat regardless of present conditions.  Rather, I believe things should be defined as they exist at the present, at this very moment in time, their past condition is irrelevant."
GenderCritical,3dqhwg,isleepinahammock,10,Sat Jul 18 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"the prospect of a male (XY person) gestating and birthing is so far off that it's barely even worth considering as a hypothetical. Forget about the idea of taking a uterus and installing it in a male body. Female bodies are primed for the task of gestation and birth in a million little ways we don't even fully understand yet. Ever wondered why women have cellulite and men don't? It's because the female body lays down fat in a different structure and this probably has something to do with the need for extra elasticity due to pregnancy. From the ground up the female body has allowances for pregnancy which the male body does not. In order for a male body to carry a baby to term you'd basically have to rebuild that body from scratch.  Even if we had the technology (and we are nowhere near), getting to that point would require lots of trial and error and many dead fetuses. Good luck getting that past the ethics boards when this is essentially a whim. Forget about your franken-uterus fantasies. Not going to happen in your lifetime, nor your children's lifetime.   As for socialization, it literally starts in the cradle. Studies show that people treat babies differently depending on whether they are wrapped in a pink blanket or a blue blanket. There is no way to get around socialization and your pesky male privilege problem."

GenderCritical,3dqhwg,87x8gfh,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"Ever wondered why women have cellulite and men don't?   Trans women get cellulite. This isn't some innate property of XX chromosomes. It's largely just down to hormones. When on hormones for a long period of time, the properties of the soft tissues all change. Fat distribution, skin elasticity, musculature, skin thickness, etc etc. For instance, someone with an XY chromosomes has already given birth.  Obviously that was an intersex edge case, but it does prove that chromosomes are not such a huge barrier after all. It mainly comes down to hormones and presence of the appropriate organs.  Now, you're right in the matter that an estrogen-dominated biochemistry is essential to carrying a pregnancy. If a gay male wanted to get pregnant, while still looking male, without growing breasts, etc, this would be exceedingly difficult to impossible. But for a trans women, who actually desires a female body, that's obviously no barrier."
GenderCritical,3dqhwg,isleepinahammock,12,Sat Jul 18 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"I never said it was just about chromosomes. I specifically said it's a whole body matter. It goes right down to the skeletal structure.    Now, you're right in the matter that an estrogen-dominated biochemistry is essential to carrying a pregnancy   Huh? I never even mentioned estrogen-dominated biochemistry. You're doing that weird dude thing where you're responding to what you imagine I said, not what I actually said.   But of you want to talk hormones, that's an even bigger barrier. Our understanding of hormones is crude and what we don't know is far greater than what we do know. We know for example, that hormones play a crucial role in appetite and thus in weight gain and loss, but we don't understand the full implications of this, and we certainly don't know enough to manipulate it.   Now consider the hormonal precision required for gestating a fetus. That's a whole different ballpark. We know, for instance that women who have caesareans experience higher rates of postpartum depression, and we think it has something to do with the hormonal processes of natural vaginal birth being disrupted. It's all guesswork and hunches though. We know very little about pregnancy and birth hormones.   The hormones involved in appetite are of great interest because of the obesity epidemic and research is being conducted by both academics and big-pharma. Compare that to a teeny tiny subset of males who want to gestate fetuses. It's not of great interest and no one is seriously looking at this prospect. Even stem cell research faces huge opposition, forget about male gestation.   Finally, I need to point out that while I believe you wish to discuss this in good faith, and you probably think your intentions are good, nothing creeps women out like trans women yammering on about uterus implants and what not. It's Buffalo Bill territory."

Women (at 29 percent) are slightly more receptive to the idea than men (23 percent).  But there are greater differences by age. Just 23 percent of Americans age 30 and older think transgender students should be able to pick which facilities to use, compared to 35 percent of Americans under 30.

There is no huge surge of rapists putting on dresses to go into women's changing rooms. The predicted surge in violence and violation completely fails to materialize.   The anti-trans folks have a lot of theory on their side, but the pro-trans folks have a real-world data on their side. From a pure statistics point of view, allowing trans people to access their identified restrooms and changing spaces is a huge net benefit to society, if you are looking only at measurable and quantifiable things like assaults, rapes, etc.   The hypothetical rapist in a dress is never observed, but the very real risk of violence, rape, and murder trans people face when using their birth-assigned restroom and changing room is very real indeed. Using their identified restrooms does a lot to help alleviate this risk.  A trans man using the women's restroom is at grave risk of being labeled a pervert, forced out, and assaulted by someone for ""using the wrong bathroom.""

GenderCritical,3dmhi5,wanderingwomb,2,Sun Jul 19 13:29:15 2015 UTC,"Brave is to ballsy as ballsy is to manly (because men have balls). Ballsy means bold or daring, often in an aggressive or reckless way. This is often how society expects men to behave. Patriarchal English apparently thinks anyone brave ""has balls"", because that is the domain of the male gender (to be a go-getter), ergo ballsy. The joke references socially constructed masculinity (which is based on being a dick -- see, the gender essentialism is baked into our language!) because Tur threatened Shapiro. MtTs like him tend to respond with aggression to anyone who questions them, and, correspondingly, that is something that men do when someone questions them (if they can get away with it! -- which, in our liberal society, is less easy to do blatantly). All the more ironic if he's post-op (post-balls -- yes, the balls are removed -- yes, that is crazy!), because loss of balls does not equal loss of the masculine gender role conditioning. The joke is that no matter his superficial features, he's still a domineering man performing the male gender role, having his cake and eating it too. He may look vaguely like a woman, but he never unlearned how to be a man. So it's all manly men doing manly things at the end of the day, despite what the appearance may suggest, whether he is mentally ill or not. (Mentally ill people still behave according to gender roles, by the way.)  Therefore, I'd argue that it's the epitome of ballsy (at once being recklessly bold, and manly, ergo male domination) to be a male transgenderist because it's the final frontier of colonizing ond commodifying women's bodies.

If a man (an adult male) has a particular kind of brain pattern, it means that some males have that brain pattern, full stop. It doesn't mean that they are female any more than the existence of breast cancer in a small proportion of men means that they are female. It matters very much, because the contention that some men are really women is absolutely key to the argument that therefore they belong on women's sports teams, in women's bathrooms, in lesbians' bedrooms, etc. Your argument is like saying that it doesn't matter if people believe that vaccination causes autism, or that it doesn't matter if people reject the science behind climate change.

But, it matters to me to refute false claims and bad science.   And I think it also matters because their insistence that they were born with lady brains is usually an insistence that gender roles are innate and having a female brain is what makes them naturally inclined to pretty outfits and being bad at math. And the lady brain insistence is sometimes used to deny socialization entirely.   If it were just an argument over whether or not they had a female body map then yeah, might be moot.

Respect them and give them equal rights, yes.  But we don't let them police our language and dictate our perception of them.   I had severe body image issues starting at 3 years of age.  I'd stand in the mirror and think how plain I was and how fat my thighs were as a toddler.  Nobody in my life put those ideas in my head; in fact, just the opposite:  I was constantly praised and told how pretty I was.  But the thoughts persisted.

I also feel like his reps wouldn't have cancelled the Diane Sawyer interview even if Bruce hadn't received the ESPY award, simply because it wouldn't have been in their/his best interests. The interview provided Bruce with media coverage (the non-tabloid kind) which got people talking about him, and having the public aware of him, as long as it isn't for doing something bad, benefits his show as it might lead to more viewers.

The first ones who used it were people trying to erase prior convictions, especially pedophiles.  A legal, instant gender change would be even better. Nothing of your past would turn up on a search. I don't know how background checks work in the USA but it might give you some protection from these (or just give rise to more issues from lack of training of the people using background checks, to real issues while people get used to a new feature in the system about the possibility of changing your name and gender).  As a male sex offender, pick a female identity. Choose a name that might work for a man too (or shortened to something masculine). You don't have to change your behavior or appearance, or anything. But you'd have free access to a lot of places supposed to be safe for females. On top of that, if you applied for a job, or housing... people might be less likely to even run the usual background checks on a female (assuming at that point of the process you're not doing anything face to face, but sending applications and such).  Once you're accepted in any job you just have to live your life as if nothing happened. You could even pretend to people around you that the gender on your ID is a typo and you're getting it fixed ""soon"". I think a law on legal gender change (if it passed) would come with anti discrimination provisions (because it would require a majority of lawmakers that would be trans-friendly), so as long as you land a job (the ""female"" thing might get overlooked in your paperwork), let's see your boss firing you based on the discrepancy between your legal and actual gender (bonus : if he fires you, even better, you can probably sue him for damages)."

Your hypothetical monster, if they're still living as and look male, with constant questioning, harassment, and discrimination every time they show their ID.   That just isn't realistic."

When you were born, they classified you as female, based on your genitals, just like they did with males. After that, unfortunately, society has lots of ideas about how you ""should"" or should not behave, based on those initial classifications of male or female.   But you know what? Fuck society.

But in general, gender critical feminism and radical feminism are about social classes. The intent isn't to hate anyone, but point out how women are oppressed because of their biological sex.  I felt very similar to you at your age. I've always hated being a woman, because being a woman means (socially) that you are less than human. That you should be a decorative object.  I still hate being a woman, but I've realized this is because society made me hate it. I want to be seen as a full person, but society doesn't see women as real, true, authentic equals.

Just as someone debating you could use logic to their favor using their beliefs.  First I will start with there are many different forms of logic. Let's start with: Argumentation theory is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies.  The beauty of semantics is who sets the premise, the conclusions, and the fallacies.  You want believe it's the term MtT and not MTF, this would be considered a fallacy.  The transgender community would believe that MTF is perfectly acceptable and going MtT is considered a fallacy.  This is the problem with logic from a philosophical standpoint. It favors the persons using it because they set the premise, conclusions, and fallacies. There are always different sects in science that are always in disagreement, therefore you pick the logic that most favors you and is generally accepted in everyday practical use.  Now science is being used to show that being transgender can be measured scientifically using an MRI to show the white matter for both transgender men and woman. As more data that is gathered the more it becomes a myth or fallacy yo something that is generally accepted, which were already there at this point in time.   Logic is not effective at having an argument because neither side will budge. The side that makes the most changes will win because the general public tends to favor change epically in regards to equality."

And I say this as someone who has experienced both. At around the same age I would have felt the same way about my body as the younger version of you. I knew how society told me to look and that was how I wanted to look. I knew that I fell short of that goal. I dieted and hated myself and stayed alone because I was convinced nobody would want to be my friend because of how terribly fat and disgusting I was.  As puberty hit, so did dysphoria. I grew into a body very similar to what young me would have wanted. I also grew into a deep-seated hatred for it. I wanted freedom from the new conditions that ruled my life (being looked at, restricted, bras, snide remarks about my body that suddenly weren't shut down by the adults in my life). I can only say this in retrospect, of course, because at the time all I could think was ""get these things the hell off me."" I had vivid dreams about having a penis shrivel and wither off my body as though I had somehow been born a failed man. I just ""knew"" I was supposed to be a boy. I went by a male name briefly. Thank god I finally grew enough to stop myself from transitioning. Had the ""informed consent"" model been as prevalent back then I would probably be in a much different boat.  Ultimately though the hatred that I felt was the same. It went from hating my breasts to hating my breasts. From hating my height to hating my height. From hating my stomach to hating my stomach. The feelings were differently angled but all originated from the same place. I don't think that the two can be separated in any neat way that this aub would apparently like.   For example I went from hating my breasts because they were a sign of how I would never be the perfect model that I was told I had to be, to hating my breasts because they marked me as an object to be acted upon. When I imagined being a man and being free of them I spent very little time imagining being validated as a man. I spent my time thinking about being a writer or an explorer or a seaman. I spent my time thinking about how men could DO things. Yet it all boiled down still to hating my breasts. Dysmorphia and dysphoria all rolled into one convenient cluster.

I spent years in outrage-culture liberal feminism before my partner looked at me over dinner one day, wondered aloud, ""I wonder if people wouldn't feel so compelled to change their bodies if we stopped assigning interests to people based on their parts.""

My mom constantly went on about how ""flirtatious"" I was and that I ""didn't have to be smart"" because I  could marry a rich man when I grew up.  I hated my assigned gender. In my head, I pictured myself as a slim, fast boy with a buzz cut. I actually was a small chubby girl with hair past my waist that no one would let me cut. I pictured myself growing up to be muscular and tall so that I could protect myself from people who wanted to hurt me. I did push ups all the time because I wanted a muscular, man's body.  Puberty set in and I grew slim and pretty, with big blue eyes, boobs, and a big butt. Guys stared and commented all the time and the reality that I would never be big and strong set in. I cried all the time and wrote stories in which I was a boy going on adventures. I bound my breasts because I read that Alanna did it to pass as a boy when she was training to be a knight. The pain from the confusion and body hatred was unimaginable. If I had had access to testosterone and had these feelings validated, I would have done it in a heartbeat.  I got older. I went to therapy for years and eventually started talking about the sexual abuse. I ran away from my abusive family. I made friends. I came to peace with my body. And with all of these things, the pain went away. I feel happy with my body and I regret all of the things I did to hurt it. I am so grateful that it is healthy.

If HRT makes you happy, cool! It worked pretty decently for me. If it doesn't, that's also very important and should not be swept under the rug. People have the right to explore all options. Lots of people find that HRT doesn't work for them, and that's fine. Lots of people find that it does, and that's also fine. Who are you to judge people who seek alternative ways to be happy in adulthood? Jesus fuck.  Also. Rape threats: what the fuck? Are you 12? Certainly you don't have genital dysphoria, because I do, and I wouldn't be able to think of using my genitals for anything of the sort even if I was as shit of a person as you are. If you don't have genital dysphoria, why do you care about this person that's talking about it? If you do, how the hell are you comfortable talking about rape?

GenderCritical,3d1pcn,veronalady,-11,Fri Jul 17 20:54:33 2015 UTC,IMHO gender dysphoria isn't really a variant of body dysmorphia. One involves feeling that your sexual characteristics are alien to you and the other seems to involve feeling like your body just isn't good enough.
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,ramen_diet,10,Sun Jul 12 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"Are those meaningfully different, though?  Bipolar disorder is when you experience high moods and low moods in addition to normal moods. Depressive disorder is when you experience low moods in addition to normal moods. Both are stilled grouped together as mood disorders.  In the DSM IV, Body Dysmorphic Disorder is considered a somatoform disorder, lumped in with conversion disorder (loss of functionality of a body part) and hypochondriasis because of its fixation on the body. To any extent that transgenderism is transsexualism, meaning a belief of being in the wrong sexed body, it could be classified as a somatoform disorder.  The experience of body parts feeling alien to oneself is not unique to gender identity disorder. There are people who have the belief that their limbs should be removed. You could say they have an obsession with amputation. People with schizophrenia have cut off their penises, gouged out their eyes, and cut off their limbs during episodes of psychosis. Their brains don't suddenly transmorph into being one-eyed, and someone with an obsession with having one arm doesn't just have that one region of their brain that recognized their arm just magically vanish out of existence.  If someone with an amputation obsession did indeed have a ""body map"" that was a limb short, we would expect that, throughout their life, they would have difficulty with motor skills and tactile sensations with respect to that body part.   I keep calling it an obsession, because that's what it is. Body Dysmorphic Disorder is now being classed on the obsessive-compulsive spectrum because it's an obsessive fixation on particular body parts. Fixation on being the ""wrong sex"" or having the wrong limbs are similar fixations.  Similarly, if ""gender dysphoria"" was actually about the body and sex), we would expect to see this as a common narrative:   A. My mom told me that when I was a child, I had a hard time washing my genitals. It was difficult for me to fully clean my penis, it was as if I was reflexively trying to move my hand inwards, like my brain didn't recognize that my genitals extended outwards. I had difficulty learning the motor skills to hold my penis to go to the bathroom. I regularly accidentally sat on my penis, causing me pain.   But we don't, and for two reasons: One, the ""body map"" is not a thing. That's not even how neurology works. We are not hardcoded with body maps, we develop a sense of our bodies over time and through experience. Hence motor skills. Hence learned tolerance of unfamiliar sensations. Hence why our bodies and brains know how to cope with warts and scars and broken noses and bone growth and all sorts of things that change the mechanical functioning and aesthetic look of the body over time. Two, transgenderism has nothing to do with feeling of being born in the wrong body. Obsession with the physical body coincides with obsession with gender. That's why transgender males stuff their bras and get implants even though both males and females all have breast tissue. The brain of a male infant is not preprogrammed to assume to not see lumps of flesh on its chest at age 16; see also men with gynemastica from obesity/other health reasons who are embarrassed but not ""dysphoric"" and confused."
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,ramen_diet,7,Sun Jul 12 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that the ""body map"" idea is pretty flawed. The fixation with changing body parts is motivated by social identity."
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,MundiMori,4,Mon Jul 13 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really think so. I could argue that the sexual nature of the imagery I desired to look like made me feel as though my own body, and the sexual characteristics of my body (breasts, legs, buttocks, lips) were not what they should have been, in my brain. Regardless, it's just foolish and insulting to insinuate that ""dysmorphia!!!"" on its own is reason for coddling. How is a compulsion to chop off a perfectly functioning body part any different from a compulsion to add another one on?"
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,maybeayri,-9,Sun Jul 12 21:11:34 2015 UTC,The sources of those compulsions may be a bit different in which case what works for treating one compulsion might not work well for treating the other. Even if both have environmental causes that still wouldn't necessarily mean they are both equally easily treated with antidepressants and/or psychological therapy.
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,maybeayri,10,Sun Jul 12 21:20:30 2015 UTC,So because doctors haven't figured out how to deal with gender dysphoria (because letting men wear dresses and have long hair is clearly not an option...) we should go ahead chopping off body parts and pumping kids with hormones that have serious risks?
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,veronalady,-12,Mon Jul 13 00:35:34 2015 UTC,"Gender dysphoria is different from body dysmorphia. You felt an intense desire to change your body to fit what you believed was more appropriate for a girl. If you had gender dysphoria, you would've felt that your body was wrong on an even more fundamental level - that you should've been a boy. At that age, this would've been wearing boy's clothes and participating in boy's activities. You did neither of these nor did you express any desire to do them on the basis of feeling you were a boy, not a girl.  This is something I see fairly often here and it's a little odd to me. If they were the same thing, they would be called the same thing. Think of them what you like, but at least learn the differences and why they're classified differently. One is about changing your body to fit a distorted image. The other is about changing your body to fit the image of the opposite sex. One can be effectively treated with medicine like what you're on and with consistent therapy. The other only responds to changing your body to fit the opposite sex. Therapy, antidepressents, antipsychotics, and stuff like that have already been tried and they have all failed. There may be a better option but science has not found it yet.  That doesn't mean gender dysphoric people shouldn't be in therapy anyways or shouldn't make sure there's no other causes of feeling this way. It just means that the option to transition should be kept open when it is currently the most effective treatment we have of gender dysphoria."

Recognizing them as being gendered according to society is very different from recognizing them as inherently gendered. Do I need to use them in quotes here or something to make this clear?   The ""image of the opposite sex"" is a distorted, culturally-created phenomenon in itself, so they really aren't different.   Considering an ""image of the opposite sex"" includes certain physical characteristics universally applicable to all members of that sex, I certainly do not see it as entirely derived from cultural norms. In that manner, they are most certainly very different. Gender dysphoric individuals want to have the physical characteristics of the opposite sex on a more fundamental level than the cultural norms imposed on that sex.

GenderCritical,3d1pcn,antigenderist,10,Sun Jul 12 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"Unless you want to tell me that breasts, vaginas, and penises are are a culturally-created phenomenon.   Males and females both have breasts, and of varying sizes. Women with small breasts don't have dysphoria over their breasts not being ""female sized,"" they're just taught to be insecure about it. Men who develop gynemastica from obesity or other health issues don't get dysphoric and suicidal over being half female, they're just taught to be insecure about it.    vaginas, and penises   They are culturally weighted phenomena.  So if I do a search for ""penis"" on reddit, that yields 1,163 results in r/asktransgender. ""Breasts"" yields 1,840. ""Vagina"" yields 661. ""Makeup"" shows 1,310.   For a community of people who apparently are suicidally stressed and disordered over not having the right ""equipment,"" the majority of whom are male, they seem more interested in talking about makeup than they do the genitals that seem so foreign to them, and they seem to have very little interest in talking about the genitals they say they were always meant to have. And when they talk about penises, it seems the conversation centers around on how much they don't mind them.   Sidebar, I just came across this really upsetting thread about a woman with vaginismus taking that condition as evidence that she might possibly be male. As someone who suffers from it myself, I very much believe a huge part of the cause is the anxiety that was instilled upon me since childhood by society's misogynistic attitudes on women and sex. Ironically, this would theoretically be good evidence for ""wrong body map""  and her male brain doesn't know how to properly relax her female pelvic floor muscles (which males also have, but let's keep painting a picture), except that basically all of the commenters are like ""nope, that's not dysphoria, but what do you think about your boobs?""  There's more threads about breasts than there are penises, even though the existence of breasts are not themselves sexed and vary in size as a product of diet/nature and all sorts of things. Breasts are of greater discussion than genitals because they are visible to others, that is, they have social value.  Transgender people don't want the physical characteristics of the opposite sex nearly as much as they want the social markers of the opposite gender, which are inextricably linked to physical sex."
GenderCritical,3d1pcn,maybeayri,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"Considering that breast tissue only develops when there's an abundance of estrogen, which is chiefly produced by ovaries, which are always within women, I fail to see how they're not sexed. Men who develop gynemastica can and do develop serious depression related to their ""man boobs"" and often seek to have them surgically removed. Given that it is just one part of their body and an issue that is usually easily enough corrected, I'm not surprised they don't get suicidal over it.   They are culturally weighted phenomena.   You will have to explain exactly what you mean by ""culturally weighted"".   So if I do a search for ""penis"" on reddit, that yields 1,163 results in r/asktransgender   Would it surprise if I informed you that many who do not like their genitals tend to not name them by their scientific name? They'll even go great lengths to avoid talking about it specific by giving it a cutesy name or term.    the majority of whom are male   The majority of the community on Reddit may be male, but in the population, the numbers are pretty close to even. To be fair, though, these numbers are largely guesses extrapolated from who shows up for treatment due to the issues of trying to actually track down real numbers for transgender people.   And when they talk about penises, it seems the conversation centers around on how much they don't mind them.   That's usually because it's seen as extraordinary to not want a vagina in place of your penis.   Ironically, this would theoretically be good evidence for ""wrong body map"" and her male brain doesn't know how to properly relax her female pelvic floor muscles (which males also have, but let's keep painting a picture), except that basically all of the commenters are like ""nope, that's not dysphoria, but what do you think about your boobs?""   What do you think about your breasts? If you were to have them lopped off tomorrow, would you feel like less of a woman? Would you wonder if you could ever be seen as a woman without them? If you wanted to be a man, would you want to keep them, hide them, or lose them entirely? Breasts are an inherently feminine body part - only those humans with an excess of estrogen develop significant breast tissue. Men do not generally produce enough estrogen. Women do.   Transgender people don't want the physical characteristics of the opposite sex nearly as much as they want the social markers of the opposite gender, which are inextricably linked to physical sex.   Given that the stated goal of many transgender people is to be accepted as the opposite sex, is it really that surprising that those wanting to be a women would first chase after a pair of tits and want some makeup to disguise physically masculine traits? I submit that many also chase such things because they're socially conditioned to believe stuff like makeup is inherently feminine and they want to be feminine in behavior as well as physically. You'll see some women wanting to be men do the same thing - they'll crop their hair really short, bulk up, and act like they see the guys around them do.  Particularly early on, transitioning transgender individuals tend to overcompensate and leap into the gender pool's deep end. They explore the boundaries, stereotypes, and sometimes privileges of the other sex in an effort to find where they most belong. You've had years to get used to the concept of living to the standards and expectations of femininity with all of what that entails. Most of those whom post in /r/asktransgender are getting a crash course in what that actually means and they're not doing it via a gender studies course or a lifelong socialization from birth as that gender. They will conflate social and physical aspects of being male or female and think it's all one package, that liking makeup means you're a girl or that being a car enthusiast means you're a boy. I see it all the time and I've only been there a year and a half. Not all of them turn out to be transgender. Of those, not all of them will pursue medical transition. Of those, not all of them will pursue every single transition-related surgery. Of those, few stay after they hit a certain point of being socially accepted as the gender they want to be seen as, usually referred to as ""going stealth"". When life becomes mundane and your transgender identity is increasingly unimportant to your daily life, why bother being an active part of the community?"

Misdiagnosis is a genuine point of concern when it comes to any kind of medical care and with the rising number of informed consent clinics, it does seem like the bar to get HRT is getting set pretty low. This is why I tell people questioning their gender to seek out therapy so that there is someone that is supposed to be qualified helping oversee their mental healthcare.  It's not foolproof, though. Nothing ever is. There is always going to be a set of the population that gets the wrong treatment or finds out they were misdiagnosed after all. The best we can do is to encourage people to take it slowly and get therapy to make sure they have all their ducks in a row before leaping to anything permanent.

In my experience, transmen are equally offended by exclusion regardless of reason but don't react as offensively because they weren't socialized to, making it largely transwomen that blow up and harass people.   Here's another interesting way to think about it, as a comment:  As to why transmen don't direct their anger outwardly when they're denied male spaces because of their femininity: Transmen, who were raised female, are long-since used to being excluded from a group because of their physical sex, because they're women. For better or for worse, I'm sure it bothers you less when you've been dealing with it since the moment you popped out. When you're female, it's just your daily dose of sexism.  Transwomen, who were raised men, are totally new to being denied a space because of their sex, so they don't know how to deal with that shit like women do. It's like, this new, alien thing and they're not sure how to feel. They don't understand what it's like not to be entitled to a space not entirely because of narcissism, but because of something that can seem a lot like narcissism: naivety.

One mild example was a transwoman fb friend of mine who posted how much it sucks to have nostril hair, getting it plucked, suffering under beauty standards.

The thing is, men are taught--forced, even--to pretend they know what they're talking about even if they don't, because not knowing is ""weak."" This means that when it comes to certain topics, they will assume control of the conversation but have no idea what to do. This hurts everyone involved. The patriarchy takes men and conditions them with fear into hurting themselves and hurting women. It is a system designed to hurt women above all others, and it accomplishes that by hurting men and unleashing them to hurt women 10 times more. It really is...gross when you think about it that way. It's like violence dominoes.  On top of pretending they're not ignorant, men also generally don't want to learn if they are, so they just kind of bumble through life hurting women.

When your SEX is thought of as making you inferior, making you an object, a sex doll for men, claiming your humanity is an act of self preservation. Being told that each person has super-special-gender feelings COMPLETELY ignores the reality of women's lives.

I'm happy you've found yourself inside, but my curvaceous outside is what has caused people to treat me like an imbecile much of my life. The world has beaten it into my head that the outside matters. I tried to make it on my own (proven!) merits in a male-dominated (oops, can we still say that?) industry, and ended up deciding it was a Sisyphean effort and to keep what little sanity I had instead. Those guys would not have been able to magically treat me differently if I had come in one day and declared myself just like them, mostly because I just wasn't. On the outside. On the inside I was every bit as geeky and ready for the long hours, and this was the first time I really had to just accept that they would never be able to see past my form to the whole person I actually was. Because they have been trained since they were little to interpret my form as sexual, rather than human.  Sorry for the rant, but this idea that your body doesn't matter is some weird, retro, Cartesian nonsense. What are we talking about being female, your soul? ""...Unlearning that penises equates to maleness"" is not something I'm prepared to do, because it's not rooted in reality. The scientific categorization system wasn't made to help you feel good, it was made to classify things. If you were born with a penis you were born male, period.  Which brings me to my last point, that bit about how ""you must be male to benefit from male privilege. Trans women aren’t male, so we don’t benefit from male privilege and never have."" This betrays a serious misunderstanding of what male privilege is. It's not freedom from discomfort, it's people listening to you when you open your mouth, no matter how goddam silly or spastic what you say is. Just. Like. This. Just like we are now, just like Everyday Feminism gave you a soapbox from which to spout this nonsense about female penises. Socialization begins at birth, we all do it unconsciously. No one could see how you felt inside when you were little. They shouldn't have yelled at you for crying, but that doesn't make you a girl. They would have unconsciously encouraged your strong opinions, and your ability to clearly articulate them, and I feel that privilege coming through this article quite keenly.  Edited to include the point I was driving at and forgot somewhere in the wilderness that is this topic: I'm sad to say it, but I think there's an impasse here.

The prepubescent chest structure of males and females is identical. Males possess all the precursor tissues for breast growth. The only difference between natal males and natal females is that natal males are never exposed to the low androgen and high estrogen levels needed to activate these precursor structures. In natal women, these structures are activated by estrogen produced by ovaries. In trans women, these are activated by exogenous estrogen.  This is very similar to trans men and beard growth. Both males and females have the innate capacity to grow a full beard. Natal females are just usually never exposed to the high testosterone levels needed to trigger extensive facial hair development. When trans guys take testosterone, these structures are activated, and facial hair growth is triggered.  The difference between the sexes is much less than you realize."

GenderCritical,3cov5c,wanderingwomb,7,Thu Jul 9 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"BIIDs still tend to have a psychological root, however. There may be a predisposition but no one is born anorexic, for example."
GenderCritical,3cov5c,itazurakko,8,Fri Jul 10 12:53:16 2015 UTC,"BIID is likely influenced by childhood experiences and formative moments as well, an intense fascination with and identification with the idea of being disabled, or having others treat them as disabled (and before you ask, no, it's definitely not all about pity, in fact often it's explicitly the opposite).  If this happens early enough, you get all of the ""I've always been this way"" ""I can't imagine being any other way"" ""I don't think I can ever change this"" that people seem to think for some reason must mean it's an inborn physical issue.  If you read through self-reports of people, stuff that goes on for years, there's just so many experiences they write about that are quite telling, plus interesting variations on the parameters of what relieves (to some extent) the emotional pain and what doesn't, the use of certain signifiers, the specific kinds of functionality people imagine they were ""meant to have,"" that would match with a psychological cause.  And yeah, I do see a lot of parallels with GID. But I think that leads to it being a psychological issue.  Mind you that doesn't make it any less real, or imply that it's trivially done away with via therapy though.  People (all people) also continually re-interpret their memories to fit with their perception of self, not on purpose or anything either, we all do it."

You're going to get varying levels of support here, because a lot of the women here have been bullied by males claiming the transgender label. My two cents is, gay men need to be supporting each other as gay men. All men, in fact, need to be accepting, supporting and protecting ""feminine"" men (I realize not all gay men are feminine and not all feminine men are gay). There is no way to ""feel like a girl"" (and if he's a grown man, he should (sincerely) think about why he's using the word ""girl."") There is no way that a male person shouldn't feel just because he's male. There's nothing a male person shouldn't like just because he's male. There's no way a male person shouldn't dress just because he's male. And ""woman/girl"" isn't an escape hatch from the pressures of masculinity; it's just the flipside of a shitty coin.

I'd also push back on the logic of ""feeling like a girl.""  Assuming such a thing were possible, how would he even know?  It assumes   a point of reference that he can't possibly have.  I mean, we've never been anyone but ourselves, so how can we know we feel like something we aren't?  And again, I'm sorry.

Try to suss out what makes him think he 'feels like a girl'. It could be a result of facing homophobia and the pressure of gender roles but you won't really know until he tells you. Try to understand what he exactly he wants to do and why he thinks it's necessary.   Maybe try a few therapy sessions. See how serious he is. If you feel that he means to go forward and you can't help him come to a place where he's comfortable as a man, you may have to prepare to separate. Have all your ducks in a row before approaching this.  You will eventually have to have another long, serious talk about your relationship. Or it might come up if you go to therapy. If you feel this strongly, then you must let him know that if he wants you to start thinking of him as a woman then the relationship can't continue because that would mean he wants you to start thinking of yourself as 'straight'. It would not be fair to you.   But this is all easy for me to say. This is going to a rough road.  ETA: Be sure to take time for yourself. Sort out your feelings. Take care of yourself.

Men who feel like they've failed as men because of their personality or interests deciding that since they don't fit society's mould that means they're meant to be women, or that it would be easier to be women because they wouldn't be pressured to hide their tastes.

To the OP - I think going the therapist together (even if he also goes alone) is a good idea. And while there, just be honest, saying what you said here. Sometimes relationships don't work out, but the only way to know if it CAN work (or can change into something else you still are both wanting to participate in) is to start from both people just being honest about where they stand.

They will make a beeline to SMYRC (""Sexual and Gender Minority Youth Resources Center"") where they will be treated like special snowflakes, and they meet other ""trans"" ""homeless"" youth (i.e. fellow runaways). SMYRC will not notify police as a matter of policy, even though this will endanger the youth. SMYRC refers the youth to Outside In, a Portland-based medical service for the homeless youth. Outside In operates a ""trans clinic"" at its downtown Portland headquarters, where the youth can get ""Identity Project"" (free DMV and birth certificate changes based on a ceremonial hour-long ""counseling session"" with an affiliated WPATH psychologist on site) and free hormones. Outside In will generate paperwork for Oregon Health Plan, and OHP will authorize sex-change operation by Dr. Tuan Tran, the local sex-change surgeon.  Oregon taxpayers absorb the costs of all this. Parents are completely oblivious as neither SMYRC nor Outside In will notify parents, citing HIPAA and confidentiality.

It's an unfortunate thing, but presenting someone to the public for scrutiny will inevitably lead to scrutiny.  Where it gets more difficult is when people get snarky about the ""product"", that presentation of the child gets presented to the public and which gets scrutinised. I think sometimes this is justifiable as you have to think of situations like when these people get presented as better women or girls, as more female than any lowly born female as that can and should be criticised, along with the exploitation we can see.

Lets say he is in the koolaid so deeply- and able to milk this until 25 like Paris Lees, What comes after that? Homelessness? Marriage to a man that will take care of him?? Narcissistic people have trouble being told they have to improve themselves, or work for real rewards, he is being raised to be a 'Star'.  Andrew Cunanan was brought up like a prince, he was brought up to be a Star and his parents were supporting an unrealistic view of the world- never suggesting life would be hard if you have no skills.. He left home to be a hustler for gay men, because it is easy money for a teen male that wants to party for a living, and reinforced this idea of deserved good things as a party-object. This ride lasts until they are in their mid- 20s, then the guys don't make that much.  When AC went on a rampage, it was because his hustler career was ending- he was not a cute boy getting free things anymore. He had no skills and could not get any favors from his rich male customers that buy cute boys. He did not want a regular job. I am sure we will see the lady-boy version of this with played out in some of these child experiments.  Paris Lees is already being fazed out as too old. He can't even write about feminism -all of his articles bash women in little condescending ways.

One of the most common arguments I got into would be with conservatives who insisted that men and women are ""innately different"" and that ""women's brains are X and men's brains are Y.""    I sort of drifted away from that forum over the years, although I'd go back from time to time, and recently I went back again to see what it was like.    For nostalgia's sake I dove into a thread about maternity/paternity leave, and naturally I soon found myself pulling up my own ancient posts and links to review the ample evidence disproving ""lady brain.""   It wasn't until a few pages in that I learned I was arguing against a liberal.    The same argument! ""Women and men are born with different brains!  Gender exists because we're innately wired that way!  Some people are innately nurturing, and those people are called women!""  Same old sexism, but now package as liberal and feminist.  What I learned was that my activism doesn't need to change in any way.  I just need to be prepared for the fact that opposing sexism and biological essentialism may mean that some liberals reject me."
GenderCritical,3cdjhc,A_macaroni_pro,14,Tue Jul 7 12:07:47 2015 UTC,"It's not surprising that some conservatives and trans activists are both gender essentialists, though they differ as to the solution to not conforming to the stereotypes.  They both believe gender is innate, but conservatives believe one must double down on conforming to the stereotypes associated with one's sex - to change one's personality to ""match"" their sex.  Trans activists take the opposite position - one must change one's body to ""match"" their personality (what they call ""gender identity"").    In both instances, you must change and you must ""match"".  Neither accepts the idea that one can simply be a happy, mismatching non-stereotypical person.  I don't see transgenderism as a liberal thing at all.  Like conservatives, they see the problem as within themselves, not with how society is structured and that they have to change themselves rather than to change society, which is a conservative outlook."

It used to be that the liberal position was that conservatives were wrong about gender, that there was no reason why a person with a penis should be innately ""masculine,"" and therefore it was okay if William wants a doll and for boys to cry and so forth.  At some point, though, the narrative became that there's no reason why a person with a penis should be innately masculine because it's possible his penis is a birth defect that just needs to be fixed so that his woman-brain will properly reside in a matching woman-body.

So yeah, potential side effects are generally really scary but it's rare that patients will receive all of them or even one of the serious ones. Simply because there is potential for a severe side effect does not mean that the drug must never be administered. It simply means that such drugs must be chosen carefully and their usage and effects monitored.  I get the impression that you seem to think parents just show up at the doctor's office, tell them they think their kids transgender and the doctor just goes ""la de la de la, let's prescribe powerful drugs that stop puberty"" based on that alone. Any doctor actually doing this should not be administering any drugs at all. This treatment at that age generally requires months, if not years, of therapy and consistent behaviors and demands from the kid.

Anorexia and gender dysphoria are so entirely unrelated that I'm not sure this bit here is even worth replying to.

History is full of men who were disallowed to play with girl things as children and didn't come out as transgender or a crossdresser or whatever. Most, like my nephew, just go ""okay"", maybe throw a tantrum if they think that'll change the parent's mind, and move on with their day. You seem to think that's changed to ""Ok, fine, I'm a girl"" and the parents just go along with it without a care in the world, up to and including pressuring the kid to keep going if they try to change their mind later. Why?"
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,maybeayri,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"Why would a parent that doesn't want a gay son consider having a son playing the part of a girl be better?   Because she's trading a gay son for a straight daughter. Like with the case with Iran, sex changes are a very conservative concept. And if this woman believes sex changes are possible, why wouldn't she prefer a ""normal"" daughter over a gay, gender-non-conforming son?    I just don't see that happening in America or Canada where the population historically leaned towards trying to make them straight instead.   But that's not socially acceptable anymore. But you know what is? Transgenderism. And best of all this particular type of reparative therapy goes unquestioned, unexamined and frames itself as progressive.    Most, like my nephew, just go ""okay"", maybe throw a tantrum if they think that'll change the parent's mind, and move on with their day.

Why?   Conformity. He ""acts like a girl"", it's easier to make him a girl. The trend with these trans kids stories is you typically see the parents giving examples of how they tried pressuring their kids to follow gender roles at first. Having their kid conform to the opposite gender expectations instead is the exact same solution.   Not everyone who is put under immense gender role pressure is going to develop dsyphoria regarding their body and sex, but I think it's reasonable to consider that it's a likely source of dysphoria.   Though there is a tendency from the transgender crowd to surmise that anyone who isn't trans is 100% comfortable with and accepting of the gender roles for their sex."

Like with the case with Iran, sex changes are a very conservative concept. And if this woman believes sex changes are possible, why wouldn't she prefer a ""normal"" daughter over a gay, gender-non-conforming son?   It's certainly not a conservative concept. Iran is an anomaly in that it's a conservative element that pushes for and unconditionally accepts being transgender. It's not the rule.  In most Western countries, conservatives are fighting back against transgender recognition and rights. You need only look at who introduces and sponsors bills against gender identity protections and the political leanings of those that rail against it on social and mainstream media. Recognizing that someone can change their sex violates the boundaries set by society in that men are some set of characteristics and women are another. It transgresses those boundaries set by the patriarchy. Iran is, again, unusual in that it demands that men and women that don't fit the gender norms of heterosexuality must change their bodies to better fit those norms. Here, conservatives will demand that a man seeking to transition to being a woman ""man up"" and conform to their norms. I mean, we're just now seeing acceptance for gays and lesbians and all they want to do is be able to date, fuck, and marry the same sex in peace.  Rather, the concept of changing sex is strongly liberal. It encourages the idea of bodily autonomy, that gender roles and norms are not fixed to one sex or another, and that people are free to live how they want. This flies in the face of conservative ideology that your body belongs to other people or an institution, that men and women have fixed roles and characteristics, and that people should have limited opportunities based on their sex. What you're saying is that a conservative parent would prefer their child be straight and fit social norms so much that they would rather force their child to change everything about their body, style, and even mannerisms to fit the opposite sex. This is something that is very much untrue in North America, but especially so when transgender people are still fighting for acceptance. The media and a lot of people like to pretend that being transgender is totally ""in"" right now, that I could come out tomorrow and be unconditionally accepted by pretty much everyone. I, personally, would probably lose half of my family - the conservative half, as it happens - if I did that. Some might change their minds reluctantly. The rest won't. And that's something I've seen in a lot of transgender people's stories, even with the minors that have posted in the past.  So, yeah, ""transgenderism"" is certainly not unquestioned or unexamined. At best, it's considered as politically correct to go along with it in an effort to give the least offense. I assume that's what you're talking about.    Not everyone who is put under immense gender role pressure is going to develop dsyphoria regarding their body and sex, but I think it's reasonable to consider that it's a likely source of dysphoria.   That is true and it's certainly possible. This is actually a matter of some debate in transgender circles about what constitutes the kind of dysphoria necessary to transition. I will give you that many people will encourage transitioning when there's not much to go on. I submit that this is because they feel they waited so long that it became unbearable and would much rather not see another person suffer that fate. I do advise that people think a lot and experiment a lot before jumping into the deep end because I think transitioning isn't something to take lightly. Fortunately, this is what is supposed to happen with children. Maybe some doctors are overeager and bypass the standards of care, but they shouldn't do that.   Though there is a tendency from the transgender crowd to surmise that anyone who isn't trans is 100% comfortable with and accepting of the gender roles for their sex.   I don't think the transgender crowed really thinks that but I can see why it comes across like that. That certainly doesn't apply to me, but I think that has become pretty evident from my posts here."

She demanded to be called a boy's name (for years!), cut her hair into a boy's style, and so on.  She was being sexually abused by a neighbor and had no words to talk about it, she was being threatened and blackmailed to keep it a secret.  Today she'd have been puberty blocked for her attempt to take herself out of the sex caste."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,deirdreofthegaians,2,Tue Jul 7 02:25:15 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting that we should screen every child for sexual abuse then? Seems like this is something that could potentially be covered with the therapy that kids claiming to be transgender generally have to go through before being diagnosed anyways. I can't say for certain though since I lack experience specific to being sexually abused and so lack the ability to properly place myself in her shoes.  I do hope she was able to get past the trauma of that. Is she doing okay nowadays?
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,maybeayri,7,Tue Jul 7 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for acknowledging that there can be some other source of gender dysphoria than an innate ""gender identity"".  I also found puberty extremely depressing on account of sexual abuse and I often thought of myself as a boy. I dreamed of growing big muscles and beating up my abuser, who was much larger and stronger than I was.  Now that I am away and my abuser is behind bars, I feel happy with my body and no longer dysphoric.   I was very unable to talk about my abuse while it was happening, even though I saw a qualified therapist as a child. Children, especially when threatened, can be very tight lipped. I am not at all confident that there is any way to rule this out. I was unable to tell anyone at all, even unable to write about it in my secret journal, until I was at least 13.   EDIT: I'd like to also make it clear that my dysphoria was very real and very painful. The thought of never growing big and strong and able to be without fear and defend myself brought me near suicide. And tangled up with my attraction to other girls (and no knowledge of lesbianism), I desperately wanted to be a boy. I have nothing but compassion for people who have these feelings if they are at all similar to what I had. I would rather die than live through those years again, feeling as I did. That said, I think that in my case transition would have been the absolute wrong treatment, even though it would have made me feel better. As I said, I'm just glad you see a differential diagnosis as a possibility, as most trans people I've talked to have just accused me of making up the dysphoria."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,antigenderist,4,Tue Jul 7 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think too many people simplify their reasoning in an attempt to keep things easy to understand and digest. An innate ""gender identity"" is an easier position to hold than launching into a thorough explanation of what you find wrong about your body and seizing on an identity without further investigation is often harmful.  It makes me very sad to read your story. I'm glad that you were able to find happiness with your body and that there was some justice served. It does give me some food for thought. You are absolutely right that children can be very tight-lipped. Thank you for sharing your experience.   I can empathize with your description of your dysphoria. How it made you feel is similar to what I've read before and it's pretty similar to how I feel nowadays, though mine is not always as severe. It's tough for me to tell what's depression, what's dysphoria, and what's just desperation to feel like I fit in somewhere. It's why I'm going to see a professional to talk to about it when I can afford it. It's why I'm losing weight and getting fit and trying to be more social. If doing all this ends up solving it, then great. If not, then hopefully seeing a therapist will help pinpoint what it is I do need to do. This is only one possibility for me and feeling strongly about it doesn't mean it's the right thing for me.  I'm very happy that transition would not have been the right thing for you. It is a radical set of medical interventions and choosing to undergo all of that is something that has to reward a net positive. It is not for everyone."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,maybeayri,7,Tue Jul 7 05:11:04 2015 UTC,what you are suggesting is frowned upon by trans-activism though. they call it gate keeping to have a psychologist get in the way in any capacity. you see it in the other subreddits where they encourage shopping around for a free pass if their current psychologist doesn't comply instantly with their wishes.
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,Q-Continuum-kin,3,Tue Jul 7 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"In some cases, they are gatekeeping when the psychologist demands that the gender dysphoric individual must adhere to gender stereotypes in order to receive treatment. Just as not all women are highly feminine nor all men highly masculine, not all of those seeking to transition are the epitome of the sex they desire to be. I would expect gender critical feminists to discourage that kind of stereotyping in the medical field. Am I wrong?  In many cases, though, you're right that they're just doctor shopping for someone who will give a free pass. I am a bit worried that the growing prevalence of informed consent will lead to too many people seeking to transition without fully understanding themselves and what they want out of their life. I'd like to see a balance between demanding that the patient be highly feminine or masculine to receive treatment and just freely giving out hormones based mostly on the patient's word. Medicine is an evidence-based scientific field, or at least it should be."

I think the disagreement here is that we see a transgender diagnosis (especially for kids) as a similar tactic: this person is gender non conforming and will upset society/ not ""fit in""/""be a freak"" so we will medically alter him/her to resemble the sex he/she most conforms with psychologically, as defined by modern society's rigid gender roles."

Her childhood of psychological abuse and neglect by a mother who literally hated her for being female was evidently determined to have no influence on her dysphoric feelings. However the surgery she was cleared for only made her worse, to the point she elected to die by assisted suicide.   This sort of thing happens and will continue to happen as long as trans subculture is invested in claiming that dysphoria couldn't possibly have a psychological root."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,wanderingwomb,10,Fri Jul 10 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"The president of WPATH has said that she knows of no child who has declined to transition after going on puberty blockers; child transing advocate Norman Spack has said that he's encountered only one such case. That means that these children do not go through puberty at all. It is not ""postponed."" And why no, we cannot ""really say for certain"" that a particular kind of damage will certainly occur. The potential for adverse effects, as well as efficacies, is why medical treatments usually undergo clinical trials, which (oopsie!) have not been done for puberty blockers in this patient population."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,BeeeboBrinker,-2,Tue Jul 7 00:39:01 2015 UTC,"Don't they, though? I know of no doctors that would allow patients under their care to suppress sex hormones for an indefinite period of time, given the role that both testosterone and estrogen play in promoting physical and mental health. At some point, these kids must come off the blockers. If they decide not to go for their natural puberty, then that means either testosterone injections for those wanting to be a man and a combination of estrogen and an anti-androgen for those wanting to be a woman. At this point, with the presence of sex hormones once again flowing freely though the body, development of secondary sexual characteristics can begin. It would simply not be what they would normally go through as if they let their bodies natural processes go about their business unimpeded. Are you saying this is not going through puberty? Our bodies are able to recognize what to do regardless of what sex hormone is dominant in our bodies - it's why men can develop gynecomastia and women who take a lot of testosterone steroids masculinize to some degree.  With puberty blockers, the potential adverse effects whether it's neurological, physiological, or social are going to be much harder to pin down. Research also runs into the fact ethics boards and rules are very stringent about research involving those underage. You would need the parent's approval and cooperation, for instance. It makes it a significant challenge.  I would love to see that research done, though. I would have to agree that medical intervention at this age is certainly something that needs to be as informed as possible about the potential consequences, both positive and negative. This is something that is true regardless of what that medical intervention is."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,maybeayri,3,Tue Jul 7 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"At some point, these kids must come off the blockers.    According to WPATH, that happens after the child reaches the age of majority and undergoes surgery.  So, in the case of boys, they no longer need puberty blockers because they have been castrated.  They then begin taking feminizing hormones."
GenderCritical,3cbcvn,A_macaroni_pro,-1,Tue Jul 7 11:49:38 2015 UTC,"According to WPATH's latest Standards of Care, at no point is surgery required for hormones. To even get puberty blockers, there's some pretty strict criteria, shown under the section title ""Criteria for Puberty-Suppressing Hormones"":   In order for adolescents to receive puberty suppressing hormones, the following minimum criteria must be met:   The adolescent has demonstrated a longlasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria (whether suppressed or expressed); Gender dysphoria emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty; Any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere with treatment (e.g., that may compromise treatment adherence) have been addressed, such that the adolescent’s situation and functioning are stable enough to start treatment; The adolescent has given informed consent and, particularly when the adolescent has not reached the age of medical consent, the parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and are involved in supporting the adolescent throughout the treatment process.    Under ""Partially Reversible Interventions"", there is a single paragraph pertaining to cross-sex hormone therapy:   Adolescents may be eligible to begin feminizing/masculinizing hormone therapy, preferably with parental consent. In many countries, 16- year-olds are legal adults for medical decisionmaking and do not require parental consent. Ideally, treatment decisions should be made among the adolescent, the family, and the treatment team.   Under ""Irreversibly Interventions"", qualifications for genital surgery is defined as follows:   Genital surgery should not be carried out until (i) patients reach the legal age of majority to give consent for medical procedures in a given country and (ii) patients have lived continuously for at least 12 months in the gender role that is congruent with their gender identity. The age threshold should be seen as a minimum criterion and not an indication in and of itself for active intervention.   And even then, they must have references from two qualified mental health professionals in order to fully qualify for the surgery if it's related to gender dysphoria.    Two referrals—from qualified mental health professionals who have independently assessed the patient—are needed for genital surgery (i.e., hysterectomy/ salpingo-oophorectomy, orchiectomy, genital reconstructive surgeries). If the first referral is from the patient’s psychotherapist, the second referral should be from a person who has only had an evaluative role with the patient. Two separate letters, or one letter signed by both (e.g., if practicing within the same clinic) may be sent. Each referral letter, however, is expected to cover the same topics in the areas outlined below.   Each referral letter is supposed to contain the following:   The recommended content of the referral letters for surgery is as follows:   The client’s general identifying characteristics; Results of the client’s psychosocial assessment, including any diagnoses; The duration of the mental health professional’s relationship with the client, including the type of evaluation and therapy or counseling to date; An explanation that the criteria for surgery have been met, and a brief description of the clinical rationale for supporting the patient’s request for surgery; A statement that informed consent has been obtained from the patient; A statement that the mental health professional is available for coordination of care and welcomes a phone call to establish this.    Medical professionals in both the mental health and physical health fields are highly encouraged, if not required, to give children and adolescents as much time as possible in their natural bodies before they stop puberty or give out cross-sex hormones. In all steps of the process, the child or adolescent and their parents are informed as to the risks of medical intervention at whatever point of development they're in and should be consistently undergoing psychotherapy to both address any other mental health concerns and to ensure the child or adolescent is exhibiting real signs of gender dysphoria. This is a long, drawn-out process by design - because of the level of risk associated with transition-related medical intervention and the lack of physical maturity of the patient, each and every option to alleviate gender dysphoria must be exhausted before they pass out hormones, both for blocking puberty and for feminizing or masculinizing.  Any medical professionals bypassing this process to jump straight to hormones or surgery for children or adolescents without this kind of process should be taught that this is incorrect."

This is simplistic, granted, but things like hiking, fixing cars, climbing trees, or playing with dolls are just activities. Many of them are unnecessarily gendered for whatever reason, but that doesn't make them not part of how someone expresses themselves. At this point, clothing is just too ingrained into how we perceive someone's gender that not including it as part of that kind of expression is basically ignoring reality.  Don't get me wrong.

I'm simply recognizing that they are gendered and that people will consciously or subconsciously pick up on that and act accordingly. This includes both behaviors and, yes, clothing. In business, the military, or even in general society, certain types of clothing are said to be for women and others for men. This is shown by how clothing is categorized in stores, how the fashion world models specific clothing lines, and how people will even go out of their way to specifically get baby clothes for boys and girls. We are taught these things from a very young age and it's a big part of the reason you get so many false positives when you deal with potentially transgender kids. All of these things have minimal grounding in their sex. Clothing can be modified to suit different body types freely, but it is still tied to being either for women or for men. Behaviors aren't inherently tied to whether you have a dick or a vagina, but they are still referred to as being masculine or feminine.  This is separate from things specifically associated with one's sex. Tampons, condoms, birth control pills, some specific types of piercings... these are the kind of things that would explicitly tied to someone's sex as they require certain organs or body parts to be useful or present at all.  My belief system is not based on ""phooey and hookum"". It is based on evidence I've seen and personal experience.

I've actually had some extensive conversations with two of my sisters about how their kids are being socialized to accept and learn specific gender roles and norms with the aim of encouraging them not to limit their daughters to just ""girl stuff"".  People transitioning to the opposite gender today must conform to some specific expectations that society in general has of men and women. That includes gender roles to some degree. Depending on where they live and transition, this may just be a style of dress better suited to their changing bodies and maybe a specific range of haircuts. In other places, they will have to conform to a broader range of gender norms in order to gain acceptance. By far, most transgender people just want to live their lives in peace, both within and without. There's no real desire to challenge the status quo any further than they have to. Once they're physically and socially ""stealth"", they just disappear into the general population. That is why you see so many conforming so thoroughly.

Christinia Hoff Sommers, by her wikipedia page, sounds like an either an MRA, an anti-feminist, or the worst sort of liberal 'feminist'. (""modern feminist thought often contains an ""irrational hostility to men"" and possesses an ""inability to take seriously the possibility that the sexes are equal but different"") In light of this I'm a little disinclined to believe everything she says and I question her motives.  I can't watch the full video but I read the transcript (which is only partial). I'm of two minds. On the one hand the whole safe spaces and trigger warnings thing has gotten out of control. Trying to cancel lecturers may not be the way to go about it. Not attending the lecture, perhaps encouraging others not to attend and expressing their disagreement (through the school paper, for instance) might be better. Things are being labeled as dangerous and threatening in a hyperbolic way. So I can agree with this to a point. Although, making it about the FIRST AMENDMENT and FREE SPEECH OMG is annoying. I mean, ""University and college officials, afraid of running afoul of title IX, are quietly amending the U.S. Constitution.""? Oh please. Calm down, lady.  BUT it's very easy to cross the fine line from disagreement or challenging ideas to straight up sexism. If a professor expresses in class that 'women are just naturally inclined to family-friendly careers oh but that's not a bad thing' is a student justified in her complaints about sexist stereotyping or is she a crazy harpy who can't handle disagreement? There needs to be a balance. I don't want professors to feel gagged or threatened but I don't want students to feel stereotyped or discriminated against.    This is a real issue but boy have the MRAs leapt on it. ""Hysteria over sexual conduct will do little to help genuine victims of sexual violence."" What does this even mean? What sexual conduct is she talking about? She's a hypocrite too. Accuses feminism of treating women like delicate flowers and crusading against anything that would make women 'uncomfortable' meanwhile she crusades against feminists she views as attacking men, wrote an entire book about the plight of poor, poor boys and men (the fault of women of course) and seems bent on protecting boys and men from any blame for sexism or anything bad said about their actions ever."

Additionally they may have occurances of phantom penises in ftm transsexuals (or the absence of them after bottom surgery for a mtf transsexual) which supports the theory that gender is rooted in your brain and your body map (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)   Only known in humans but could not possibly be socially constructed?   If it's a matter of their brain 'expecting certain architecture' (give me a break) then why call it gender? Why use that specific term for it when that term has never before been used that way? It's been used as a more 'polite' way to say sex or it's been used to refer to gender roles. So why is it used specifically for this supposed mismatch? It says a lot and certainly makes transgenderism look like it's all about the gender roles. And if they don't mean it that way then why not use a more accurate term? Gender does not mean, at all, what she says it means.  ETA: And tbh, I'm not even sure what she's saying gender is. It's in your brain and...?  Do only trans people have gender if gender is a mismatch between your body and brain?    Transsexualism: the in-congruence of your sex (body) and gender (brain). This in-congruence leads to sex dysphoria. Sex dysphoria can be treated by trying to make the body more similar to what the brain expects.This can be done with Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), or surgery. The extend of dysphoria is individually very variable and may also vary day by day. It may go away completely with treatment of merely be alleviated. That, too, varies from person to person. Also comes in non-binary flavour which is not yet very studied by science, but might be explained by further variations of the body map as explained above. Prevalence is hard to estimate but usually given somewhere between 0,1 and 1%.   This is basically the 'truscum' view. Sure, sex is real and not socially constructed but trans people are really the sex they say they are because they have male/female brains (please ignore that there's no such thing as a male or female brain!)!

Why it's time for brain science to ditch the 'Venus and Mars' cliche.  Men and women do not have different brains claims Neuroscientist  Why don't you take each and every one of the studies Biologyweeps linked and break them down in detail for me? Explain the data. Show me what it is you think they prove and why this is 100% factual truth.  I'm dismissing them because they prove nothing. They have tiny, tiny little sample sizes, they use loaded terms they don't define or explain (gender identity) and treat gender identity ('feeling like a man or woman') like it's fact. Did they completely exclude social/environmental factors or any other contributing factors? Anything else that might cause difference? Have they determined the cause? How is the difference relevant? Have the findings been reproduced? Biologyweeps even says it's a theory and it's a theory not supported by much. If you want to prove that males can have 'female' brains and vice versa, you'd have to prove that a definite female or male brain exists in the first place.   Even if they did somehow prove that being trans is something biological in the brain, so what? Males still aren't female. Females still aren't male. That they might have an issue in their brain doesn't make a lick of a difference. Your sex is not determined by a brain scan, it's determined by your sex organs. MtFs still don't have female anatomy and never will. If there was proof that something occurred in theirs brains that made them unhappy with their sex or make them think they 'should' be the other sex, it doesn't make a difference. This does not mean they're 'really female' or 'should be female' or anything else.  Furthermore, the onus is not on me to prove anything. You came in here making a claim and pretending you were providing evidence. You want to prove yourself right then do it. Your comments so far are unconvincing and seem to boil down 'well this biologist on tumblr said so'. Also, do not put words in my mouth and lump me and the others who comment here together.

And then, with the paragraph labeled ""Gender,"" the post temporarily abandons any attempt to define terms.  Gender is asserted to be something ""known only in humans"" and ""most certainly not a social construct,"" but no effort is made to DEFINE gender.    Gender is also not distinguished from the subsequent ""Gender Roles,"" which are simply said to be ""shitty.""   This becomes a particular problem given that transsexualism is then defined as ""the in-congruence of your sex (body) and gender (brain).""   We haven't gotten a definition of gender yet!  [Sidenote: As a neuroscientist, I find it hilarious to see ""body"" and ""brain"" defined as separate entitites.]  The post then asserts that ""Sex dysphoria can be treated by trying to make the body more similar to what the brain expects.""  Which is quite a claim, given that we haven't even reached a consensus on diagnostics in this area, let alone validated such a radical course of treatment.  Needless to say, no citation is provided to support this.   The link dump at the end of the first major paragraph is a whole other problem.  Even if the sources established what she thinks they do (and most don't), they still wouldn't support her thesis statement at all.

It is quite clear from the data presented that MtF brains are much closer to the male samples structurally than the female: Of the 22 significant regions studied, in only 2 of them (left and right putamen) were the mtf brains more similar [volumetrically] to women rather than men. This point is made most clearly by the two supplemental figures.  This paper is not saying 'mtf brains are more like women!' but 'this one part of the brain in mtfs is significantly different to men, therefore that part might have something to do with being trans' which seems like a reasonable conclusion. Being trans is a mental condition, it's not totally bizarre to suggest some sort of distinct cerebral pattern might be associated with that.  Critically, the language used is ridiculously leading (""feminized"" putamen size indeed, at least they put that in quotes... I would call it just ""larger""). If a woman has longer legs than average, does she have a  ""masculinized"" femur?   Possibly a slightly more controversial flaw, mentioned in the discussion. It's been shown by several studies that homosexual men can have different brain structure to heterosexual men. 6 of the 24 mtf subjects were self-reported as being attracted to men. It's most likely that either 0 or 1 of the 30 non-trans males in the study were [self-reporting] gay (based on a ~2% figure for most surveys in the US). Do the differences found in the study persist, if these 6 male-attracted mtfs are removed from the dataset?

I accept it's a tough thing to nail down (which conditions do you count?) but by most commonly accepted definitions by the medical community and mainstream intersex groups (e.g. isna), it's on the high end by a factor of 10-100.... See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476264 .  It's stated that it's hard to generalise intersex conditions... Actually, it's very easy to generalise when you use a figure of 1.7%, because that means that 88% of your intersex population actually have [late-onset/nonclassical] CAH. This is an condition of androgen excess that affects girls and women;  by definition it's not something that can be noticed at birth. I really, really doubt that many people with late-onset CAH would identify as intersex. They look like women, they were raised as women, they went through puberty as women, fertility rates are marginally below normal...  I think it's quite misleading to use women with CAH to pump the numbers of intersex and then talk exclusively about much rarer, much more ambiguous conditions."

I feel like I don't really have any other resources other than this subreddit to safely talk about stuff like this.  I do see a really awesome therapist who specializes in NPD. She's great. It's just, I've been so terrified to talk about gender-critical issues with her. She's very liberal. She's helping me out with an extremely reduced rate since I'm in a tight spot financially. I'm terrified of offending her, and her wanting to suspend sessions. Or her seeing me differently/negatively. I feel overly paranoid and embarrassed about that. :\ I think I'm going to bring it up very vaguely next time, gauge her reaction, and maybe go from there.

Grimm was born female and identifies as male.   Separate bathrooms were provided.  Remember that.  Safety was not an issue.   Until December, Grimm had used the boys’ restrooms for seven weeks without any issues. Then, amid pressure from parents, the school board voted 6 to 1 to restrict girls’ and boys’ bathrooms to students of “the corresponding biological genders.”   The parents were upset, but they were obviously bigoted sillies because there were NO ISSUES!  None!  No, the WaPost is not going to interview any of those parents.   Justice Department officials wrote that Grimm should be allowed to use the male restrooms at Gloucester High School as a matter of mental health. It also said discriminating against transgender students could be a violation of the federal Title IX regulations that aim to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender.   Yes, the point of Title IX was totally to allow students and faculty to use the restroom of their choosing, biology not withstanding.  (If you want to see the real point of Title IX, turn on your local Fox station at 4PM PST tomorrow.)   [Justice Dep statement]: “Allowing transgender students to use the restrooms consistent with their gender identity will help prevent stigma that results in bullying and harassment and will ensure that the District fosters a safe and supportive learning environment for all students, a result that is unquestionably in the public interest.”   Justice Department overrules actual public to serve the ""public interest."""

GenderCritical,3c0k68,Eclectic58,9,Fri Jul 3 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"This is the comment I left there, which has yet to be approved and shown:  Children do not complete their cognitive development until around age 20 or so. It is in recognition of this fact that children are legally prohibited from a range of activities for their own protection. They may not live independently, consent to sex, smoke, drink, vote, join the armed forces, get married, be responsible for their debts, and so on. Nor may parents allow their children to do these things contrary to the law. Thus, children do not yet have the cognitive tools to consent to any sort of medical transitioning, procedures that will likely result in the permanent removal of their reproductive capacities and leave them at a much higher risk for the diseases mentioned in this article, as well as making them permanent medical patients for hormone treatment.  For this reason, for the protection of such children, I believe that any sort of transitioning: both puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones should be banned for children. I have nothing but contempt for doctors, knowing the risks, who would perform these procedures on children who are unable to give informed consent. It is nothing short of a human rights violation and is highly reminiscent of the eugenics movement sterilizations of ""undesirables"" 100 years ago.  Rather than allowing a child with a non-stereotypical personality to just be themselves respecting the integrity of their healthy bodies and allowing them to go through normal body development, to be a tomboy or a sensitive boy, the parents and doctors want to make their child go through medical procedures to make their bodies ""match"" their personalities. Who says they have to ""match"", especially considering that gender role stereotypes are not innately linked to one's sex?? They shouldn't have to change and they shouldn't have to ""match"" in order to be happy with the personalities they have. During their cognitive development children try on all sorts of roles in discovering who they are and are especially prone to magical thinking and to suggestion from the adults around them. It's perfectly normal and it doesn't need medical intervention.  I see the idea that a person might believe that they are one sex trapped in the ""wrong"" body of the other sex as a symptom of an underlying mental issue, quite similar to that of the anorexic person, who similarly is unable to see their body in accurate terms. They see themselves as being very fat, when in reality, they are dangerously thin. But, unlike with transgender youth and adults, anorexic people are not treated by enabling the symptoms - doctors do not perform liposuction surgery on them, nor do they recommend diets or other weight loss measures. Rather, hey are treated by cognitive and other therapies that help them learn to see themselves in more realistic terms - the underlying mental issue is treated, rather than the symptoms enabled. I believe the same should be done for transgender youth, to help them see their bodies accurately and to learn to be happily themselves in the healthy bodies they were born with, rather than being subject to dangerous medical procedures that will most likely permanently remove their reproductive capacities before they are even old enough to give informed consent.  Adults, of course, are free to make such decisions for themselves after being fully apprised of the risks of such a decision, but children should be left alone and allowed to grow up naturally."

The ""transgender"" child is a separate person from their parents and we are told not to question the medical establishment in regards to our children's health. Just as these parents in the pbs documentary are pressured to stop questioning and do as their doctors say.

Let's break this down: Diphtheria Rate 2004-2008: 0 cases reported in the US ; the fatality rate is 5-10% 0 deaths  Tetanus Data from 2001-2008: 233 cases total… 141 with unknown vaccination status, 37 with no vaccination, 24 with full vaccination). The average rate of infection per year is 30 people total fatality rate is 10%... 3 people die from Tetanus in the US every year. No one younger than 34 years old has died of Tetanus. Most cases are from patients 65 years or older. (Source: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6012a1.htm) 3 deaths, 0 childhood deaths. 16% of those who got tetanus weren't vaccinated, 10% were fully vaccinated  Pertussis Data from 2012: 48,277 cases of whooping cough that year in the US. 20 deaths.  Data from 2012 6months-6 years old on vaccination rate: 9500 total cases - 59% were fully vaccinated. 27% unknown, 9% had no vaccination. There were 3 deaths that year within this age group.  (Source: http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2012.pdf)  So of the three diseases that DTaP prevents some of the time (as shown, people who are fully vaccinated still get it), only 3 childhood deaths occurred. The same year, there were 4 deaths reported to VAERs linked to DTaP. This does not include general Adverse Events reported, which would be vastly larger than mortality rates.   Was seen for 15 mo well child visit 10/28/2011 received DTaP, HIB, PCV 13 and influenza vaccines approximately 5pm exam was normal. Patient was at daycare 10/31/11 and found to be unresponsive after being put down for a nap. Brought to ER, pronounced dead after unsuccessful resuscitation attempt.

This is a serious anti science agenda and this sub should not give it a platform IMO.  The day I found out that the whooping cough and the nearly annual flu and pneumonia we had to endure, my brother's meningitis, and my friend's deathly tetanus battle were all from the bullshit ideology of my family's insane community was the day that I stopped taking any advice from our parents.

GenderCritical,3c0k68,BetAle,3,Tue Jul 7 00:25:07 2015 UTC,"I'm on a mandated work trip and I can't believe I have to deal with this bullshit right now.  Your tetanus information states that the reason behind the lack of deaths caused by tetanus is because of vaccination including this statement.   A major contributor to the decline in morbidity was the near elimination of neonatal tetanus, a result attributable to improved childbirth practices and to increased levels of maternal immunity resulting from universal childhood vaccination  Inadequate TT vaccination and inadequate wound prophylaxis remain the most important factors associated with tetanus.  The findings in this report indicate that older adults are at greater risk for tetanus than younger persons, and the risk for fatal disease is higher among patients aged ≥65 years. This increased risk likely results from inadequate vaccination rather than inadequate response to vaccination, because tetanus toxoid is sufficiently immunogenic in older adults    So no. Pack your anti-vax shit up.  You don't know what the fuck you are talking about.  You're akin to a climate change  denier cherry picking studies and then making shit up.  *Edit:  You also fail to acknowledge that MAYBE such a low infant mortality or mortality overall has something to do with the vaccine.  Vaccines aren't perfect, but we can look BACK in history at the mortality rate prior to vaccines to see how it bad it was."

In my experience, that used to be true, but it's starting not to be. The amount of people appropriating the trans label has grown larger than the amount of people who are actually trans in the past 5 or so years.  I've been part of this community for about 10 years and I've definitely noticed the change for the worse. Suddenly, nobody talks about physical dysphoria anymore. FtM rape trauma goes utterly unaddressed, glazed over by hand-waving and ""if you transition socially, you'll feel better."" Social transition has become the cornerstone of treatment for dysphoria. It used to be about the medical condition--about our bodies. About feeling comfortable in our bodies, and there was no wrong way to do that if it worked. It was very personal, very supportive, and very free. These ways are dying and being replaced with dumb gender politics.  Here's why I think it's happening:  I believe there's a natural progression in society that has genderism on one end and full gender-criticality on one end. At the beginning is patriarchy, and at the end is freedom. I believe it to be laid out thus:  0: patriarchy  1: patriarchy that accepts trans people with stereotyping, during which trans people are forced into gender roles  2: patriarchy that accepts trans and gender-nonconforming people with lesser but existent gender roles  3: genderless society.  We are currently entering phase 1. Why is phase 1 first? That's easy: because the idea of someone being the opposite sex inside is easier for a dumb, patriarchal society to understand than the full nuance of the problem, so it becomes a stepping stone to phase 2.  So what is the source of the current influx of AFTAs? Why are people co-opting the trans narrative? I have put a lot of thought of this, and have come to the following conclusion:  The GNC people who will be accepted in phase 2 see trans people being accepted by society and want it immediately, but patriarchal society is too inflexible to allow change that quickly, so their only option to be normalized is to forcibly become part of the group accepted in phase 1.  Most GNC people are smart enough to know that that's a shit idea and work hard to advance gender-critical feminism and bring on phases 2 and 3, but a sizable minority mostly consisting of massive narcissists1 decides to go on ahead with this idea. In their blind race to appease the patriarchy in order to feel accepted, they end up fucking over people with dysphoria and undermining feminism, and that's the trans community as it stands right now.  For the record personally, I don't care about wearing female clothing or any of that stuff. I don't believe in gendered stuff like that I just want my body not to feel like the wrong sex. I only dress in stereotypically-female clothes because society is sexist towards women and I get hit secondarily with a lot of that being what I am. They say that I need to ""dress and 'act' like a woman or I don't deserve to be comfortable in my body"", so I do. I am forced to act out a parody of femininity to get the treatment I need. Truthfully, I'm relatively agender and disgusted by every second of it, but I don't know what to do to stop it. I am being held hostage as a weapon against women and my medical care will be stopped if I refuse. Please help. A lot of us (and non-AFTA FtMs as well) stay quiet because we don't know what to do or how to make these people stop.  1. who are, of course, mostly male. There are also female AFTAs. I'd say the ratio is about 75/25 men to women. The men are doing it because they were taught to do it, and the women are doing it because they were taught not to do it and are being reactionary. They have been mislead into thinking that they are fighting against oppression. Most female AFTAs are teenagers and there is an element of rebellion. They may later calm down and evolve into feminists as they learn more about feminism and realize that they are working against progress...hopefully."

Transgender Reality is a blog documenting the insanity of Internet trans communities, mostly Tumblr and the AskTransgender subreddit. Many Internet trans people are a class of their own, mostly claiming to not suffer from dysphoria, being teenagers with insane gender-obsessed parents, and having escalating addictions to unhealthy Internet porn. This blog is a good place to start for proof of that, but it's really sad and stomach-churning.  4th Wave Now is a ""mommy blog"" with an unusual twist: it's written by a woman whose daughter went through a trans phase. While her daughter considered herself to be a boy, the author began reading about how dangerous the hormones and operations are and blogging about them. It's mostly focused on transmen and has frequent testimonies of women going through detransition after suffering horrifying negative effects of testosterone and phalloplasty.   Stop Trans Chauvinism is basically an aggregate of any trans critical content on WordPress.   GenderCritLesbians  [shameless, I know!] is a subreddit I created with a more positive focus of reclaiming women-only space and ending the postmodern erosion of language pertaining to women and lesbians.

I actually identify, on the flip side of the coin, with a lot of the things these men are writing regarding their childhood. Having been raised in a strict religious rural household, I felt as though I had been cheated. As young as 8 or 9 I remember feeling like my life was over for having been born with the wrong body. I asked my mom if I had been born a boy but the doctors changed me, etc. because I liked ""boy"" things and rough play, action flicks and space books.   I remember thinking it wasnt fair that men got to beat their wives or control the house. My mother was a victim of domestic abuse and as a small child I resented her and strongly wanted to identify with my father.   I know now those feelings of having the wrong body were about me not identify with the stereotypes expected of me...and also not wanting to be abused. Through growing up, leaving home, therapy and being exposed to feminism, I was able to realize that liking space science and other girls was totally ok and possible with being a woman.  I feel sad for these men who think they can't be nice to women without being a woman themself.

There has been a trend of parents becoming increasingly hawkish when it comes to identifying problems with their kids -- it was there when I was a kid in the 80's and a teen in the 90's, but it's exploded since. It used to be that a majority of parents would do anything to convince themselves and others that there was absolutely nothing whatsoever at all wrong with their children; Timmy and Suzie were physically, mentally, socially, and emotionally perfect in every way, and any indication to the contrary was covered up and ignored even to the detriment of the child. Either that, or any failure was ass-whoopin' worthy. Teacher says you may have ADHD? Acting out in class? Getting bullied? Nothing a little ass-whoopin' can't help.  That attitude seems to have completely reversed. Parents need to fret, they need to fix, they need to fight with each other over whose child is more vulnerable, has the longer list of diagnoses, has the greater need for everyone's attention. They're on Web MD. They're reading the popular media getting excited to find some great obstacle they can impute into their kid's life for their kid to overcome. They're looking for every sign and hint that Timmy is ""really a girl"" and Suzie has three learning disabilities and maybe a hint of something ending in a Latin root.   And doesn't that capture something we see here every day? These kids, they just want to play. Boys want to play at dress-up just as much as girls do; girls want to get to play with blocks and maybe even god forbid some mud and leaves and sticks and shit -- but no, hold on, any deviation from a narrow set of expectations clearly means that there's a problem for the super awesome hero parents to come flying in to fix!

The more recent books spend a lot of time teaching parents to ""troubleshoot"" their kids.  Check out the shelf at your library or your local Barnes and Noble.  It's all ""how do you fix this or that problem"".  Quite often the problem is something that kids naturally grow out of (e.g. picky eating).

GenderCritical,3bl943,Eclectic58,5,Tue Jun 30 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"In 2012 there were over 2400 arrests of juvenile males for forcible rape in the US and 37% of those were <15 years old. And juvenile males account for 35.6% of people known to by police to have committed sex offences against minors. (Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention) **Editing to add that I think an avg 6 arrests per day of juvenile males for forcible rape is pretty common. Having lived in women's shelters and been to many rape survivor and support groups I have personally met many women who were raped by teenagers, most whilst teens or children themselves, but some as adults. But the bottom line here is that boys should not be allowed into girl scouts or girl guides for the same reasons we don't want men in our restrooms and locker rooms. It's a safety issue first and foremost. A major secondary issue is that these boys are taking space away from girls who could greatly benefit from scouting. Spots in all-girls groups, teams, and organisations should never go to boys even if there weren't the possibility of rape and other sex offences.   The way to teach boys not to rape is NOT to allow them into female only spaces where they have too much access to girls and where they could cause a lot of harm, and it's certainly not the way to teach them that they are girls when they're not and never will be."

GenderCritical,3blzd0,jkjl456456,7,Tue Jun 30 08:17:22 2015 UTC,"i hate the premise of the title but lets look through this.   Years later, someone told me of his disparaging description of me displaying my new-found femininity “proud as a peacock.”   How is that disparaging? there has to be some context here or this is just whining about nothing.   Bisexuals and transgenders, however, include all sorts of groups with radically unconventional lives: polyamorites, pansexuals, sado-masochists, Radical Faeries, drag queens, she-males, heterosexual crossdressers, working-class transvestite prostitutes, gender benders, genderqueers. Many of these bisexual and transgender people have little in common with the modern construction of middle-class gay and lesbian identities. When leaders of the U.S. GLBT movement began to confront the inconsistent interests of the bisexual and transgender people with whom they were now allied in the “GLBT movement,” they were faced with a political problem. Having included bisexuals and transgenders in the coalition, how could they at the same time argue that GLBT people are “just like you,” wanting the same middle-class lives as other U.S. voters (with the single exception of a same-sex partner) while being required to politically embrace polyamory and a man in a dress?   Really dislike the way the idea of a sexual deviant is dumped onto bisexuals or that the listed things are even similar. polyamory has nothing to do with acting or dressing a certain way or having some fetish.    I suggest that gays and lesbians who discriminate against bisexuals and transgenders are reacting to political and social pressures, not psychological ones.   I think this is the only interesting point in the entire paper. some discrimination may exist in this regard but it is not valid because heterosexual couples are the primary actors in any of these behaviors. wanting to distance sexual orientation from uncommon sexual behavior may come off as phobic to these 2 groups but only if you first stereotype those groups as such. this is the entire point of the gay rights movement, that the attraction is not attached to the behavior and the fact that this author thinks that the actions are inherently bisexual is a huge problem. it is helping to reinforce a stereotype onto bisexuals which causes the problems mentioned.   This “horrible illness of the mind” is a reference to homosexuality. In this way, she attempts to avoid the severe mid-century stigma of homosexuality, as did many transsexuals of the time.   yup, the early example of a trans-person already showing how transgender is homohpobic.  .  .  .  my opinion of this paper is that it has no point. to me it seems like a grocery list. here is a list of things please read. it has a single good point nested in the middle  that gay men and women do not have the same kind of phobia towards B and T as the outside has towards the group as a whole but the idea that the discrimination directed at B and T is the same is ridiculous. gays might steer clear of bisexuals for relationships because there is that nagging feeling that the other person might want a family one day but the refusal to recognize gender identity is simply that. the concluding paragraph seems to be attempting to make a point but i dont see what it is."
GenderCritical,3blzd0,Q-Continuum-kin,3,Tue Jun 30 11:05:24 2015 UTC,"""gays might steer clear of bisexuals for relationships because there is that nagging feeling that the other person might want a family one day""  If by ""family"" you mean have a heterosexual relationship that includes biological children, then I would say we are pretty smart to prefer other gay people for long-term relationships, given the sheer statistics: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2927737/  Hardly a ""nagging feeling""."
GenderCritical,3blzd0,jiljol,2,Wed Jul 1 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking a look. My TL;DR of that paper would be:   Gays generally agreed to accommodate ourselves into society by claiming to be normal other than the same sex thing. This has been an effective political movement which has led to widespread acceptance of gay people. We don't like trans much both because they are too outrageous for the straights to accept and we see them as traitors for pretending to be heterosexual. The 'LGBT' movement has always been welded together and full of internal dislike.   I don't see much to argue with here, as a strictly political explanation of the friction between T and G, although there are certainly other reasons to reject the T. As a political history of the movement and the split it seems reasonable.  I think what you're saying is this paper itself relies on some unfounded claims about the nature of the bisexual movement. That's something I don't know a great deal about, but I associate the history of bisexuality with 'swinging' and wilder behavior. Maybe that's wrong.  I did find the early history of the split between T and G really interesting."
GenderCritical,3blzd0,transsnarfleblort,0,Tue Jun 30 11:30:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience the history of ""bisexual activism"" is almost the exact same thing as trans* activism.

GenderCritical,3blzd0,87x8gfh,4,Wed Jul 15 02:27:22 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, the term sexual orientation implies that one is oriented in a particular sexual direction by a force or forces outside the will of the individual. It stands in direct opposition to the term sexual preference, which implies that sexuality is a matter of choice. The displacement of sexual preference by sexual orientation is not a matter of linguistics, but of politics. When bisexuals, lesbians, gays and heterosexuals are placed under the rubric of sexual preference, sexual choices are represented. When placed under the rubric of sexual orientation, then bisexuality stands out as a failure of orientation or a dual orientation, a product of confusion, promiscuity or indecision.   On this I agree. I don't believe in sexual orientation, but I do see sexual preference as evident.   But it would certainly be a mistake to assume that bisexuals are natural allies of transgender activists. The only thing that allies these groups is society's view of their lives as deviant.  LGB on the other hand, have common goals.   Until the 1970s, however, there was little need to define the precise boundaries of homosexuality.   I never did realize that there was a need to define the boundaries, until reading Reddit... I always assumed that it was about the simple desire to be with the same sex that defined us, not so much the presence or absence of the desire for the opposite sex. The former seems to me like a kind of class solidarity, while the latter seems to me like a kind of policing the boundaries (which guarantees division). As a socialist anarchist, I'm questioning how much the division is influenced by liberalism's excesses, one being the attachment to group ""identity"", a reification of collective interests which takes on a life of its own, independent of its creators, which then imprisons those same creators. While collective interests exist and we must find common cause, if I can't decide what to have for breakfast, then I would never expect to find homogenity within and adherence to an illusionary group ""identity"". And of course I prefer class analysis, which focuses on material reality and oppression, rather than what I perceive as cults of normative identity.  I don't agree with sexuality being policed beyond the sane boundary about not hurting people. People are too complex and spontaneous to be placed comfortably in boxes for any lengthy period of time. And that seems doubly true when I consider that the radical feminist perspective is that sexuality is -- not entirely, but to a degree -- socially influenced, and that is why we are concerned with the presentation of women as sex objects in the media and the porn industry, for example, and how that affects rape culture. But that's just my obviously controversial opinion.  Edit: precision"
GenderCritical,3blzd0,LilianH,4,Wed Jul 1 05:53:08 2015 UTC,"An interesting article, although a little dated now. The section on the history of biphobia is very interesting because I've seen a lot of the same issues that occurred in 1990 come up again recently in relation to the dyke marches in North America and elsewhere. These were founded in the early 1990s as a direct result of the diversification of pride marches and were meant to combat lesbian invisibility in the LGBT community. Now, twenty years later the same issue is arising again as the definition of dyke has been expanded to include bisexuals, trans women, and anyone else who identifies as a woman so lesbians have again been reduced to a minority in their own march and many are no longer turning up.  I think fundamentally that is the cause of most of the tension between the various groups in the community. Every letter you tack on makes the original L and G less and less important and marginalized. At the same time issues each part of the community faces are very diverse so if you try to focus on all of them you spend less time on each one and soon you end up with organizations that no longer represent the people who founded them.  This problem is exasperated by the fact that while there are transgender organizations and bisexual organizations any organizations that excludes either or both of these groups is immediately labelled 'biphobic' and 'transphobic' and you end up with no groups that are allowed to be just for gays or just for lesbians."

It's suggesting that out of 700,000 individuals, 287,000 of them attempt suicide, at what rate? Every year? Or what?   Where is the source for this 41% statistic I keep hearing so much about (and why is it considered bollocks)?  Also how is it that there are almost 4 times as many transgender individuals among the poor, making less than $10,000/yr? Because I've spent years below that line, and none of whom (with one exception) even remotely identified as transgender, and they wouldn't even know what transgender is if asked.  Statistics should have borne out by now.  ETA: OH WAIT! That's just a misleading graph. It's actually comparing the percentage of the population rather than counting heads. So 15% of transgender individuals are extremely poor, which will be a smaller population than the general population. So even if that percentage is 4%, 4% of the population is more than 15% of transgender individuals. The population of the U.S. is about 300 million, so 4% of that is 12 million. So let's say 12 million average Americans are poor as hell. 15% of 700,000 is 105,000 poor as hell transgender people.  By that same token, the graph shows that percentage-wise there's more transgender individuals in the middle class than the general population, but nobody is talking about that, why?"
GenderCritical,3bi471,87x8gfh,10,Mon Jun 29 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"This is where the 41% statistic comes from. It was attempting to measure the lifetime suicide attempt rate. I'd consider it bollocks to extrapolate this one self-report survey to the general trans population, especially since this survey also measured gender-nonconforming people. And 41% of the respondents (both trans and not) is not 41% of the trans population.   Third, since the NTDS utilized convenience sampling, it is unclear how representative the respondents are of the overall U.S. transgender/gender non-conforming adult population. Further, the survey’s focus on discrimination may have resulted in wider participation by persons who had suffered negative life experiences due to antitransgender bias.  As the relationship between minority stress and mental health would suggest (Meyer, 2003), this may have contributed to a higher prevalence of negative outcomes, including lifetime suicide attempts, in the sample. These limitations should be kept in mind in interpreting the findings of our analyses.    By all means, further research should be done into the suicide attempts, their cause and so on. But this number is being passed around as cold, hard fact without acknowledging the limitations the report itself acknowledges. It's one thing to say 'This report says such-and-such so this might be a real problem' and another to say 'HALF OF ALL TRANS PEOPLE ATTEMPT SUICIDE!!'.   The number is misrepresented constantly. Sometimes it's, 41%, other times it's 50%. Sometimes it's all trans people, other times it's trans youth. And sometimes it becomes a 'suicide rate' rather than 'attempted suicide rate'. I don't think anyone has an accurate number on completed suicides in the trans population.   edit: forgot some words"

But if they're that easily swayed then they probably already support men (who claim to be women) entering women-only spaces.  I don't mind John Oliver when I already agree with what he's saying, because some of the jokes are funny. I feel like Last Week Tonight is a show for people who want to think they're educating themselves by watching it. In some cases they might get people thinking about issues by using humor, which may be necessary for such people to ever pay attention to a given topic (although that attention probably goes elsewhere when the episode ends). Their coverage of each topic definitely has a slant to it, though, and that slant/John's conclusions are only as valid as the evidence he bases his conclusions upon. And unfortunately in the case of the Transgender Rights youtube video not all the evidence seems to be valid.  All we can do is continue to tell the truth, even in the face of people twisting it to try and justify transgender 'rights' that infringe upon women's safety, and make women afraid to speak."
GenderCritical,3bgn73,NeForgesosVin,17,Mon Jun 29 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"This is tricky. Can I just tell you how I handle stuff like this, even though we are different people and it might not satisfy you?   I have a sort of radical perspective on life, and I always follow ideas through to their conclusion, which I suppose is why I'm a radfem. And I believe in being as consistent and honest as I can. I think radicalism extends ideas to their limit, and even if you are of a moderate or conciliatory temperament, it's radicals who show you what the limits of ideas are. Radicalism is necessary for understanding ideas, and working out where you sit, imo. Radfems perform a community service, lol. Anyway, everyone who knows me knows that I do this, and if they didn't like it, they wouldn't go to the pub with me.  Having said that, I'm radical about a lot of things, not just feminism, and some of these ideas alienate people that I know. I don't bang on about them all the time, but if the discussion comes up, I say what I think. The key is being very clear about what you believe, knowing what you are talking about, and discussing things as honestly as you can. If people get upset, you don't have to pursue it, but you don't have to lie about what you believe either.  I have not lost a single friend by doing this, although it has helped me to understand my relationship with other people better. I've also converted a lot of people to my point of view on various things, and given people the space to say things they were formerly afraid to say. The thing is, if you have friends who know you are a kind person, and you think about what you believe, they will have respect for you whether they agree with you or not. If they don't, I guess they don't understand you very well, or their cognitive comfort is worth more to them than your friendship. You have to decide whether their friendship is worth more than you expressing your ideas. There's no shame in deciding to be quiet, but speaking just for me, it doesn't suit my personality."

But if I want to talk about trans kids, and whether we should be teaching kids gender roles or enforcing them, and what the medical effects of trans ideology is on little kids who could grow up to be perfectly functioning normal adults if their parents would just let them be themselves. If I want to talk about the little boy I teach who painted his fingernails because that was who he is, and how that's far braver than Caitlyn Jenner saying that she looks forward to wearing nail polish now that she's made this heroic transition.

GenderCritical,3bgn73,Eclectic58,3,Mon Jun 29 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether anything I say will be of any use to you, but I'll share my experiences, anyway.  I live in a bright red state and I suppose I'm rather isolated.  I don't know any trans people personally and, as far as I know I've never met one in my 57 years.  I don't even known many out gays or lesbians in offline life, though I do have a gay nephew.  I don't even know any FEMINISTS, liberal or radical or any other kind in my offline life.  The best I can do there is the ""I'm not a feminist, but..."" types.  I don't even have any clearly liberal friends, either.  I just have some middle of the road, moderatively conservative acquaintances in my area, though my mother's side of the family up north are mostly liberals.  So, I mostly don't address this issue at all in offline life, as the topic rarely comes up.  And I don't bring it up.  But if it does come up, I will honestly state my opinion, though I tailor just how I express it to the audience in front of me.  I don't often talk about patriarchy, as I believe it closes ears and minds with those not sufficiently  well-read and/or educated in such matters; it's not a topic for beginners, though it's one that you can't work into after you've brought a person along far enough that they're ready for it.  I find that focusing on the science angle to be the most helpful for beginners, particularly for the apolitical, middle of the road types - talking about how identity politics based on feelings and magical thinking completely fails the science test and is totally ludicrous when compared to what we all learned in Biology 101.  Science is based on objective facts, not emotion or politics, thus is most likely to get a receptive audience among those who don't have a personal stake in this argument.  Online, however, I have lost one FB friend to this issue, though I can't say for sure.  I was just unfriended one day for no particular reason, but I guess it could have been this, as she posted fairly often in support of trans issues.  I'd never commented on her timeline about it, but have made gender critical comments on many political pages that she quite likely could have seen, thus  unfriended me.   Oh, well, I only knew her online and wasn't particularly close, so being unfriended was fine with me.  There's another message board I've belonged to for nearly ten years that is still very active, and board culture there quickly shuts down gender critical thought, though it does not delete or ban for expressing such opinions.  I've expressed some mild gender critical opinions there, though have never laid out my complete beliefs, and have been criticized, though I suspect there are others there who share my view, but simply don't express it.  There was one member, who is now banned (but for other reasons), who is transing her elementary aged child.  And though they trashed her for the reason she was banned, the few of us who mentioned misgivings about her transing her child were shut down.  So, I mostly just don't contribute when they have threads about trans issues.  There's one woman there that I'm quite surprised that she buys the trans agenda hook, line, and sinker, because she is normally a sharp, skeptical thinker otherwise"
GenderCritical,3bgn73,Eclectic58,14,Mon Jun 29 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"I know I'm wasting my breath here, but here it goes.   Your sex is determined by clear biological criteria, except for the the case of the fewer than 1% of the population who have an intersex condition, which isn't the same thing as trans because it's not based on ""feelings"".  The sole reason that most of the animal kingdom, including humans come in two sexes, is to propagate the human species through sexual reproduction.  That's it.  . This is true whether or not we use that capability or are born with an anomaly that makes one sterile or intersex.  Sex is determined by chromosomes, skeletal structure, hormones, gonads, genitals, and secondary sexual characteristics.  All biological.  The brain is a malleable organ, its structure and neural pathways are subject to change from life experiences. Apart from what role we play in reproducing the species, everything else you do as a human being is not innately tied to your sex  Your sex isn't something you have to ""identify"" with any more than you have to ""identify"" with being a human being. It's somnething you just take for granted.  You are what you are, whether or not you like it or it feels nice to you and a mature, mentally healthy person accepts the biological facts for what they are, like it or not.  You can decide to be a different kind of man or woman from what the stereotypes tell you what you ""should"" be, but you can't change your sex.  You just have to play the cards you are dealt as best as you can.  What a person gets if they transition is the outer cosmetic appearance of the other sex, but their sex is not c hanged.  It's not biologically possible to do that.  To think one is one sex born into the ""wrong"" body of the other sex is magical, deluded thinking and it's a symptom of an underlying mental issue, in the same way that a very thin anorexic person thinking they are fat is also a symptom of an underlying mental issue.  But we don't treat an anorexic by enabling the symptoms by giving them liposuction or by encouraging them to go on a diet, so transition is also just enabling the symptoms and not treating the underlying problem.  Children do not complete their cognitive development until they are at least 20 years of age, thus are highly prone to magical thinking and open to suggestions about many things.  They believe that wishing for something makes it so, even if it's not biologically or realistically possible.  It is in recognition that their cognitive development takes many years to complete in order to be able to make rational, adult decisions that children are prohibited from a whole list of activities: They may not drink, smoke, consent to sex, live independently, vote, get married,  join the armed forces, and so on. Nor are parents allowed to let their children do these things contrary to the law.   I don't see why it should be any different for transgenderism either.  Children don't have the cognitive tools to make an informed choice about something that will endanger their bodies (puberty blocker and cross sex hormones, which have not been long term test for safety) and permanently remove their reproductive capacities.  It is nothing short of a human rights violation to allow the transing of children.  Adults can do whatever they want with their own bodies, however misguided, but it is a reprehensible and heinous thing to do to a child."
GenderCritical,3bgn73,Eclectic58,12,Mon Jun 29 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"An Addendum:  I don't hate trans people.  Actually, I feel sorry for them.  How sad it must be when a person feels they must change their bodies in order to express their personalities.  The conservatives tell trans people they must change their personalities (What society calls masculinity and femininity and/or ""gender""; the stereotypes) in order to ""match"" their sex.  Trans people believe they must do the opposite, change their bodies in order to ""match"" their personalities (what trans people call ""gender identity).  In both instances, you  must change and you must ""match"".  What gender critical feminism offers is a third option.  You don't have to change yourself to be yourself.  You can have a non-stereotypical personality (what some call ""gender non-conforming"") and still maintain your bodily integrity and learn to live life happily in whatever sort of a body you happened to be born with.  That's the true liberation that changing yourself to ""match"" could never hope to be.  That being said, I believe those who are already trans and have made irreversible decisions deserve the same basic human rights everyone else has: the right to be free from discrimination in employment and housing, the right to be free from violence, the right health care - in short, to live their lives as they see fit as long as it doesn't adversely affect the rights of others.  This doesn't include the right to be free from criticism, nor the right to re-define reality for the rest of us.  Trans people have the right to believe whatever they want to believe about themselves and to choose whatever lifestyle makes them happy, but they do NOT have the right to make others believe as they do; that they really are a member of the sex they wish to be.  It's like the freedom of religion - you have the right to believe and practice any religion you like for yourself, but you don't have the right to make others believe and practice as you do."

So if you bring some super-advanced argument, you will lose people (think your friend bringing up some weird economics thing to justify his position: how can you possibly have an opinion on it ? You don't understand anything !).   Instead, I try to ground up what I want in simple term, using feminism to inform me on the situation but exploiting non-feminist arguments to justify myself out loud.   For trans things : women are guilted into letting total strangers come close to them in the name of their inner feelings ? You're old school feminist : women are full humans who can decide whatever they want and don't need to justify it to anyone. Any policy that forces women into unsafe situations and removes their means of self-protection (whether it's a nice guy, a pretty girl or a weirdo) is unfeminist. Feelings come second, and alternative solutions are conceivable so they should be advocated. Whoever doesn't isn't being honest.*  *I like what /u/mrsgetlost says but I think that even after getting an idea to its conclusion, we should remain free of taking whichever decision we want and be fully aware of it (that's rather liberal).

I've brought up some stuff before and they think I'm worried over nothing, because they have no experience with the extreme side of the trans stuff.  However, after the Bruce and transracial lady nonsense, they suddenly saw were I was coming from. I know my older female friends were annoyed over Bruce, because what he is doing is nowhere near the reality of 65 year old women.  You have to be subtle and bring stuff up when it's relevant.

GenderCritical,3be6ta,AC_Unit_On,16,Sun Jun 28 11:29:26 2015 UTC,"From my experiences as an airline pilot there are a couple of reasons:  1) Discouragement. About half of the people who learned that I'm a pilot reacted in a manner such as: ""But isn't that something for boys? Don't you want to be a pretty stewardess?"". The big exception to this were fellow pilots, they know how fantastic flying is.  2) Children. The difficulties of starting a family while having a profession that demands you to be away from home leads to many women not even trying. My thoughts on this however are that this is perceived as a greater difficulty than it actually is. The job provides enough flexibility to combine both family and profession.  3) Harassment. Too many people seem to be oblivious about this one. Flight school was full of young adults who behaved like teenagers. This ranged from classmates not wanting to study with you because you are a girl, classmates accusing you of sleeping with the instructor or cfi when you got good debriefings or passed a check, to guys bragging in manners such as: ""Hey, come fly with me if you want to have a good time, my landings will make you climax"".

Young women, on the other hand, are less interested now in looking beautiful for the benefit of young men. They dress up for themselves, for their own satisfaction.   Women's clothes? Slim and pretty? Now I wish the article had illustrations!   Indeed, it seems that Japanese women have reclaimed sexuality as their very own and now dress to enhance their self-esteem rather than to please the male gaze, which was what a big part of street fashion had been about. Now that the male gaze is focused primarily on the men themselves, the equation of short skirts and wolf whistles just doesn't work anymore.   Well, it seems like encouraging individualism and narcissism can make men obsessed with their own looks and finally leave women alone?  I had to spend one year abroad for my studies and I chose South Korea because all my friends did. So, I can't judge the whole country, I mostly spent times with the younger generation in Seoul and it's still a very patriarchal country apparently but I had a bit of a culture shock there, especially regarding gender roles and men's beauty/fashion...   This article reminds me that whenever I think about trans people's gender identity, I wonder if they'd feel the same in other countries. For example, would MtT still fantasize about womanhood in a country or era where women are/were literally slaves? Or on the contrary, a country where men and women's roles are less strict?"

Especially in societies where people don't wear a lot of clothes, like traditional Indigenous Australian, and the only physical marker of ""gender"" was biological sex. Rites of passage in many Aboriginal societies were specifically based around bodily changes and reproductive function. And there are sacred and ritual areas in the landscape strictly segregated by sex, which Aboriginal people still ask everyone to respect today. Would a MtT have the nerve to trespass on a sacred women's space, I wonder?"

But first of all, if they are not themselves either two-spirit or hijra isn't claiming them appropriation? We're fighting against the western transgender movement here.    And second, not all ""uncolonized"" cultures have a third gender tradition, so wouldn't it be colonization to force trans on such cultures?  Like in the hypothetical situation you bring up: In order not to be white supremacist colonialist a transwoman would have to respect that the culture you described does not have an understanding of gender identity that differs from biological sex.

GenderCritical,3b71w5,jkjl456456,10,Fri Jun 26 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"The difference is that a 'domestic partnership' doesn't actually grant us the same level of recognition, benefits, and protection that marriage does. Example, our city has domestic partnership available. My now-legal-wife and I got that when it was available, and it was a nice symbol but empty in legal meaning. Being recognised only by the city and not by the state, federal government, or smaller things you may take for granted like filing a joint tax return, or getting a marriage discount on an home owner's or auto insurance policy.  Domestic partnerships are a mostly empty shell compared to what marriage is. Now that my wife and I are legally married we are recognised as the true union of two people that we are, and our union is now recognised by our state, her home country (US) and my home country (England).   Our first order of business may seem small or insignificant to those outside of the lesbian & gay community, but we're going to be getting the marriage discount now on our auto and home owner's insurance policies--something that we couldn't do with a domestic partnership."

We're the women who grew up with hardcore internet porn being normalized and available 24/7, with the GGG bullshit, just sex positivity in general. We're always shouted down when expressing even the slightest bit of concern about porn, even in feminist spaces (jezebel etc). We're made to feel ridiculous and immature about being uncomfortable with the kind of things men have grown to expect from women. That it's all empowering and all that.   It all feels terribly wrong. Like there's a lot more at stake for girls than for boys but you're not allowed to feel uncomfortable about it even in supposedly pro-female spaces.   It's such a relief to find the radical feminist perspective, the one that's been endlessly demonized in liberal feminist spaces. GenderTrender and other gender critical blogs were my intro to 2nd wave feminism.   I think more young women will be coming over to the dark side.

Apart from the fact that he used the trips to the counsellor as an exciting opportunity to dress in public, and spent more time stressing about what to wear (sometimes even buying entire new outfits), than any time in self-reflection, the counsellor spent an inordinate amount of time focusing on MY inability to “accept” rather than on HIS behaviour .  In one session she grasped on to an incident of “misgendering” that had happened in her presence (I had said something like “Why can’t he understand?”). He had fled from the room in a dramatic tizzy of tears. She stated to me in a firm voice that she is prohibited from working with couples where there is domestic abuse.

Of course, I also find it difficult to deal with people who are sexist in my real life-- my boyfriend (though he doesn't always realize it), my father, and once in a while my brother. My boyfriend unwittingly says insensitive things sometimes, but he is always willing to keep listening, which is about as good as it gets, I think.

However, it isn't white women wielding the guns, nor them given the power to do so with apparent impunity. Nor are white women controlling the systems and more importantly the legislatures that have the power to do something about this tragedy.   I suppose it boils down to the concerns I have about intersectionality/privilege, not of themselves, but how they are used in the social justice movement, where any slight advantage a person might have means they are oppressive of another. Thus you can pit the powerless against the powerless.

If you have noticed, there were black women even in the suffragette movement, and they were working for their rights too. Their first obstacle was getting the right to vote for 'all' women.   White women are often treated like the property of white men, and they are not protected from domestic violence. If a white guy has money, the police walk away from assault on a white girl. Look at Texas,   At the very least, women share this part of humanity as females- this is something we share and can work to change together, because it is effecting all of us and women problems, are often based on better care for women & children.   Actually, more than 100 white women a year are shot in Texas in Domestic disputes. Most all White guys get off with a slap on the wrist, [esp for DV related murder, the poor white man with a broken heart is spun] they systematically erase violence on white women, and deny it exists despite 35% of women's ER hospital visits are due to domestic violence: because to a white guy, this is their 'right' to use women to make them selves feel better.

This being said, sex-based oppression became much worse with private property, as the need to establish heirs/lineage to ensure property and power were kept in the family. The rise of the nuclear family, notions of female sexuality, the expectation of women to raise as many children as possible all occurred with agriculture and private property.  I've seen some radical feminists say the oppression of women is primarily sexual and not economic. I don't fully agree with this. While women are undoubtly sexually oppressed, a great deal of economic oppression happens to women as well. Sex often represents a division of labor, where women are working lower end jobs, doing unpaid care, etc. The fact is women's labor earns less than men, yet women work the same or more hours of labor. Feminists would benefit from focusing not just on sexual oppression.  The problem with gender identity is that it misses how sex is a division of labor. It's also why you primarily see the trans/non binary stuff with middle class, young white people. This group is usually childless and hasn't experienced the economic division of labor as much as poor people or older women.  I would argue men do understand the oppression of women to be primarily sexual, as women's labor is so often invisible. Its why they focus on the sexual aspects of womanhood and forget the unpaid labor portion. It's titillating to be a submissive; taking care of children for free and working at McDonald just sucks."

If they are poor enough, they can be intimidated to accept lower pay to keep their job, in a 'bad' economy. They may still hire a few token women that get mandatory raises -who  get their work stolen constantly, and have worked 2x as hard as a man to get there, but it is still a boy's club.   Now, they can avoid hiring women in CEO positions by hiring men that ID's as a women to get around fair-hiring gender equality laws.

It strips people of their sense of agency, their sense of wonder, and their creativity and instead shoves them into little boxes and lets them argue over who has the better box.  It's really kind of creepy to me.   Mainly, should a self-aware person with a choice of how to dress consciously choose 'cis' superficial presentation and focus on other gender non-conformities?   It really depends.  I've always thought that dress is a pretty poor means of self-expression.  That was kind of the point of cross-dressing when we were kids, people would get so hung up on what it meant that it was ridiculous... it means people judge other people entirely too much by their looks, that's what it means.

If I'm wearing leather pants, I'm just a gay guy who doesn't understand dysphoria.

But as a friend of mine said recently, ""if I see a masculine-looking woman walking down the street, I now find myself thinking she's trans"".  On the one hand, this kind of 'gender wariness' feels like a level of destabilization, as society comes to accept that natal biology is not gender-role-destiny.

I didn't go as far as encouraging it, but I didn't dissuade anyone either because I wanted it to sting a little bit extra for little punk ass redditurds when I yelled at them about sexism and refused to back down. I also thought it would be beneficial for people to realize that ""women"" are present on the internet and are ready to fight about things they believe in.   But, I realized that some people I was antagonizing were going to carry that sting around and probably take it out on actual women, online and in real life.

Personally I think it does if you insist that you aren't trans when you do it, and try to divorce it from any intention to fit in a particular identity box. At least in our current environment.   I seem to be in the minority here and I'm sure lots of people don't care, but I've worked in corporate environments and I've got experience to back my thoughts up. I've worked at several types of workplaces where it was a minor SCANDAL! to wear one of my menswear getups. I also worked at a very large, evil corporation with very solid LGBT protections, which allowed people to take more leeway, and saw the reception that men with feminine appearances got. You could openly see many people struggling to reconcile their opinions and be polite, and I do know some people softened with exposure, as they are wont to do.   I know it matters in LGBT circles because historically that's been the way that we've identified each other and that's backfiring in the pronouns-are-everything environment. People are way too quick to label each other.   Dress does matter to a lot of people. As a plus, it's a totally legitimate form of self-expression, so if you lean toward feminine stylings rock on.   (On a side note: I also saw how differently trans people were treated from GNCs, which was part of my Peak Trans experience. People honestly welcomed the trans folk with open arms, or at least with 100% decorum all of the time. They pretty much just tolerated the GNC dudes and they were the subject of plenty of water cooler gossip to the effect of 'why must gay dudes act so gay, why can't they be normal and stop making people uncomfortable.'

Nobody is educated by viewing a random person's clothing. Nobody is going to question gender because of your special performance. Sorry.

Namely, that some sexes are better or worse than others. The specific number of sexes is irrelevant to how any of them are treated.   sport enforces sexism, maintaining the hegemonic superiority of masculinity with every blow of the whistle.   Nope. Women and men statistically have different physical development and capabilities than each other. There is, IMO, a decent argument that those are primarily due to social pressures enforced while the person is developing, but the differences do exist. As such, it is generally a more fair contest of skill if men and women compete separately. Obviously, individual sports will vary though, and there are probably quite a few where the differences don't have any significant effect on the outcome.   Terms related to biological sex like male and female are used interchangeably with those used to describe gender identity.   Not even slightly. No one but trans advocates gives a crap about ""gender identity"". The fact that you don't like how the vast majority of the world uses ""woman"" and ""man"" to refer to actual sex is your own problem, not the problem of everyone else on the planet.   Culturally, we view biological sex as being determined simply by genitalia or chromosomes or hormone levels instead of multiple factors working together.   Nope. Most people view all of those as being found in the same people. The fact that a very tiny fraction of the population doesn't fit quite perfectly into ""female"" or ""male"" does not suddenly mean the categories are meaningless or wrong. All it means is that humans (like every species) are diverse, because any species which isn't diverse tends to die out very quickly the moment anything goes wrong.   as the some of the most offensive reactions to Caitlyn Jenner coming out demonstrated, we still have trouble accepting those whose gender identity is different than their assigned sex.   Tons of problems here. First, you're calling them ""offensive"" as a reinforcement that anyone who doesn't agree is to be ignored as a bigot, rather than actually trying to understand why they believe what they believe. Secondly, your use of ""accepting"" is assuming that the thing in question must be accepted, even though that's what the entire debate is about, whether or not this should be accepted. Thirdly, you're incorrectly framing the detractors as having a problem with Jenner's supposed mismatch between sex and ""gender identity"", which falsely implies that they already accept your concept of ""gender identity"". I'll give you the benefit of the doubt (which you tellingly do not give to your detractors) and say that you're probably not being purposefully dishonest, and just didn't notice that you were doing these things.   The reason for the “gender test” ... was to determine the presence of hyperandrogenism, or elevated testosterone levels.   Okay, some people were claiming that a very tiny number of women (2, to be precise) had too much testosterone to compete as women. That's weird, sure, but does not mean that suddenly all women and men should compete in the same events together. Your point is completely irrelevant here.   The reality, however, is that the ways [women] are allowed to be physiologically gifted are limited in a way that does not exist for men. It is ok for Michael Phelps to be exceptionally built as the perfect swimmer, but a woman can be too strong or too fast if her hormones are outside of the accepted “normal” range.   No.  There were two cases of this happening. Two. You do not get to take those and suddenly act like it's a widespread phenomena happening all over the place.  There are generalizations, and then there are strawmen. Yours is the latter.   There is a visceral fear of men infiltrating women’s spaces, in a way that does not exist in the opposite manner.   Because it fucking happens, and men are vastly more likely to be violent! These are facts. I'd provide the links, but I'm lazy and this is mostly a rant post, and not an actual discussion.   To the best of my knowledge, gender testing in athletics has never been performed on someone competing in men’s sports.    And it was performed on a grand fucking total of two women in the fucking world. Sure, it might have occasionally happened elsewhere and simply not really been noticed. The problem though, is that you cannot use that to magically say that this is suddenly a widespread, generally accepted, practice for sporting events!   The use of rudimentary understanding of biology to actively police a space designated for women is not just sexist   And you suddenly decide to conflate the extremely rare occurences of women being kicked out of women's sporting events, to the bathroom issue. For no apparent reason.  Also, you're still assuming that banning them from competing is actually a thing that anyone thinks is good and/or the same as barring actual men from women only spaces.   but also transphobic.   You have not demonstrated this, and will not demonstrate this. It's just playing the ""those poor trans people are being oppressed because they can't use the women's restroom if they have a penis"" card. Also, bonus fail points for conflating sex and gender, even though you were the one saying that it was only being done by non trans-advocates.   The arguments about protecting women’s athletic spaces mirror the inflammatory arguments hurled toward trans women about the predatory nature of their presence in the bathroom that matches their gender identity.   Oh for the love of... First, NO ONE GIVES A FUCKING CRAP ABOUT YOUR FUCKING ""GENDER IDENTITY"" OTHER THAN YOU FUCKING TRANS ADVOCATES! So STOP ASSERTING THAT WE BELIEVE IN YOUR GODDAMNSHITFUCKDAMNSHITFUCKHELL BELIEFS WHEN WE DON'T! This is why we don't like you, just FYI.  Second, the claim is not that ""trans people are going to rape women in the bathrooms"" (which has actually happened, by the way), but that ""if men must be freely allowed into women's spaces based on nothing other than their own word, then this will be abused by malicious people."" If you are not capable of understanding that malicious people will stoop to any length to cause the harm they want to, then you have had an incredibly sheltered life.   In Minnesota, these biases collided in the form of ads meant to incite fear about “males showering next to girls” in opposition to a trans-inclusive athletic policy allowing athletes to play on the teams reflecting their gender identity   Except that trans ""women"" are, in fact, men. This is because sex is not the same as ""gender identity"", so stop fucking conflating them! How dare you accuse us of being the ones constantly conflating them! You asshole!   In reality, however, the medical consensus is that transgender women and girls have no competitive advantage over their cisgender peers after engaging in hormone replacement therapy for a year.   First, you do not get to define regular people as ""cis"". Everyone is stereotype-nonconforming to some degree. No one sees the sex stereotypes and goes ""Yeah, I definitely fit that stereotype perfectly"". Stereotypes are placed upon someone by other people, not vice versa.  Secondly, I could flatly assert that the article you linked to is wrong, but I'm going to actually put in effort here, and do an actual check. Because unlike you trans advocates, we actually pay attention to what people actually say. So, it turns out the article that ""medical consensus"" linked to wasn't actually a study or anything. It was just a blog whining about the Minnesota trans thing, which claimed that a doctor said there was no advantage, but neither linked to the doctor's study, or even linked to the doctor saying anything at all. Seriously?   Contemporary sports culture fails at operating in the gray, and consequently perpetuates an exclusionary culture that makes it difficult for transgender or intersex athletes to compete long term.   Firstly, ""operating in the gray"" is a phrase thrown in specifically to make people think that the ""contemporary sports culture"" is being absolutist over some nuanced issue, even though they aren't.  Firstly because ""contemporary sports culture"" is a gazillion different people, events, leagues, etc, all with different opinions and rule sets. Secondly, because saying that woman and men are different is true by definition, and everyone is pretty much fine with having trans people participate as their actual sex (and remember that you lot are the only ones who give a damn about ""gender identity"").   While this policing is ostensibly about protecting women   No. It's about trying to ensure fair (and thus, actually interesting) competition by splitting participants who tend to have differing abilities in differing areas.   it is really about enforcing a clear gender binary that doesn’t exist.   Sex is not gender.  Sex is not gender.  Seriously, how goddamn fucking dare you accuse us of being the ones who conflate sex and gender.   And it breeds a toxic culture around gender   1. See my previous point.  2. You lot are the ones breeding toxicity, by demanding that everyone accept your magical new definitions just because you say we should.   that keeps sports from being the inclusive and powerful culture it could be.   You're absolutely right. I demand that the Tour de France allow me to enter with a motorcycle. They're not nearly inclusive enough, and that needs to be changed right now."
GenderCritical,3azg92,BetAle,17,Wed Jun 24 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"This makes so much sense. I've often wondered whether transgender would be a thing if there weren't for such strict-- completely constructed-- rules about what men and women should do and enjoy.   It seems like so many of the people I read comments from on reddit are transitioning not because they have any real understanding of what it means to be a woman, but because they want to be accepted while dressing ""girly"" and acting out stereotypical female roles. By making MtF people be women, this only reinforces those stereotypes for ""ciswomen,"" which I think is so harmful, but not at all acknowledged by the trans movement. Redefining womanhood with stereotypes, and reinforcing significant brain differences, is so damaging to feminism."

GenderCritical,3av9bi,Qsouremai,2,Wed Jun 24 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"It's not about the brains, it's about the bodies.   Athletes in most serious sports are banned from using performance-enhancing drugs because doing so creates an unfair advantage.  Testosterone and related substances fall into that category.  Women usually have less than 3 nmol/L testosterone, while men tend to have 10-30 nmol/L.   Can you see why it might be a problem to have women and men competing against each other, when men's bodies are getting the effects of testosterone levels that would get a woman barred from competition for doping?    Even if we allowed all competitors to fall within the same range of testosterone levels, this would mean that female competitors would basically have to use performance enhancing drugs in order to do sports...something that we know has long term negative health consequences."

In contrast, even if there are absolutely and indisputably zero ways for me to get erections using my penis after my (planned) castration, then this will still be superior to the status quo due to the fact that I will not have these massive sexual desires and the emotional anguish and distress that comes with them (after all, if I will take female hormones, especially in lower doses, then my sex drive should be a lot less than if I will take male hormones). In turn, me becoming a mostly asexual and very feminine eunuch who is incapable of getting erections would be at least marginally/slightly tolerable to me."""

I grew up watching the original Sailor Moon and I remember I didn't find it weird at all that there were lesbian and gay characters or that some of them crossdressed. In fact, it didn't even occur to me that it was not ""normal."" The series never made a big deal out of homosexual relationships. They were depicted just like any other romantic relationship. They weren't trying to make a statement or anything.   This sums it up pretty quickly: http://www.buzzfeed.com/lilyhiottmillis/sailor-moon-was-the-gayest-cartoon-on-television  It really confused me when I watched the American version of it, since they turned a male character into a woman just to avoid having to depict a gay male relationship. They also said that a lesbian couple were cousins, as if that's why they're so intimate. It's incredible, the amount of censorship Japanese anime goes through in the States.   In Japan, nudity isn't really a big deal for kids, so genitals and buttocks appear regularly in children's cartoons and comics in non sexual ways. In American versions of anime shows, they'd censor out breasts and genitals with obvious flat color bikinis or wobbly bushes. It's ridiculous!"

So they say that no experience of girlhood is absolute and universal, because to recognise that female oppression happens to us on the basis of our anatomy means it excludes their feelings as males.  They also say that anatomy plays no part in girlhood/womanhood because it excludes them. (""Penis is female"" for the bolder ones, ""gender not biological sex"" for when they're trying to not seem like crazy bastards)  They tell us they've always felt like women ever since they were whatever age and that they've always identified with the messages given to girls. That would be surely impossible, because that shared experience doesn't happen to women according to them (depending on which ""argument"" they are using that day).   The message that we are inferior and everything we like or are supposed to like is ""less"" than that of our male counterparts apparently doesn't happen. To acknowledge it is to show that females get shit on for their SEX. This brings up the possibility of male privilege which they will assure you that they don't have, never had, and shut the fuck up TERFS!!1111   So we can't define women by anatomy (even though they try and mimic this anatomy with surgery and hormones lolwut), we can't define women by a shared experience based on our anatomy (because they didn't get it being raised as BOYS) and that leaves us with two things.  1) Special awesome sparkly feelings, which can never be defined or articulated beyond stereotypes. Furthermore, since not every single woman on the planet feels/behaves/likes things exactly the same this nullifies this as a cause. If you can no longer define women because of ""not all women have uterus/ovaries"" or ""intersex!111"" exceptions, and you can't say women have a shared experience because it wasn't all the same then you cannot possibly say that an internal feeling completely different and alien for most women now defines what a woman is.  2) Stereotypes.

The full quote is as follows:    Transsexual individuals were at increased risk of being convicted for any crime or violent crime after sex reassignment (Table 2); this was, however, only significant in the group who underwent sex reassignment before 1989.   I would guess it's not mentioned because it's beside the point. People who underwent srs before 1989 had increased risk of crime. After 1989, males who undergo srs have the same crime rates as other males. Are you implying that the blog post is trying to hide something? Because usually when I see that exact sentence quoted it's by someone trying to pass it off as ""no uh they only have a male crime rate before 1989 so there!!!!!"". No. Male transgenders who had srs after 1989 have a male crime rate, male transgenders who has srs before 1989 had an even higher crime rate.    By contrast, female-to-males had higher crime rates than female controls (aHR 4.1; 95% CI 2.5–6.9) but did not differ from male controls. This indicates a shift to a male pattern regarding criminality and that sex reassignment is coupled to increased crime rate in female-to-males. The same was true regarding violent crime.   Odd, no mention of FTM folks in the article...would this mean that FtMs are violent men too, or just approaching it?   The blog post is about males. FtMs are not males.     In this study, male-to-female individuals had a higher risk for criminal convictions compared to female controls but not compared to male controls. This suggests that the sex reassignment procedure neither increased nor decreased the risk for criminal offending in male-to-females. By contrast, female-to-males were at a higher risk for criminal convictions compared to female controls and did not differ from male controls, which suggests increased crime proneness in female-to-males after sex reassignment.   Okay, this is painting an entirely different picture when you actually read the study. This is poor gender critical analysis and basically amounts to fudging the facts to decontextualize and draw global conclusions about crime in MtFs. Yes, they are batshit crazy, and yes, they are violent, but calling them 'trannies' and leaving out vital context does the movement no credit.

GenderCritical,3ali48,Q-Continuum-kin,4,Sun Jun 21 18:03:06 2015 UTC,"I think this brings up a good point though and it is good to flush it out because the wording isnt entirely clear.

GenderCritical,3ali48,Reddwollff,3,Sun Jun 21 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Well I'd say the inescapable global conclusion is despite the press and everyone else asserting MTF are not a problem they are no different to any other male in regards to criminal behaviour, and some sub-groups may be even more prone to this.   For FTM's unsurprisingly they appear to adopt more a male type criminal pattern, consistent with identifying male and inconsistent with typical female behaviour which tends to be even if convicted for a crime mostly non-violent or if it is a much lesser degree of violence. This doesn't mean they are violent men, what they are is women displaying male type behaviours, because that's what men do.   It's not creating a different picture to my mind, either way males AND those displaying male type behaviour are high risk for violent behaviour. It tells us there is a problem with those behaviours. Claiming to be a woman does not change that risk and claiming to be a man increases the risk."

Odd, no mention of FTM folks in the article...would this mean that FtMs are violent men too, or just approaching it?   I don't mention FTM women in my article because the blog's main focus is to expose the ""gender identity"" lie as a product of male autogynephilia, and is not about transgenderism in general.

I say several times that M2Ts are just as likely as normal men to be convicted of crime and of violent crime. I don't say that they are more likely to be convicted of crime/violent crime. I do say that M2Ts are much more likely than real women to be convicted of crime (6.6 times more) and violent crime (18.1 times more). These statements are accurate, not overblown, not decontextualized, not fudged, and are based explicitly on the article.  There is a lot of disinformation being put out by transgenderists that M2Ts are gentle sweet souls who are completely safe and trustworthy in women's restrooms and other places where men shouldn't go. It's not true. The truth is that these men are no different than normal men in their rates of violent crime. They are WAY higher than real women in their rates of violent crime. It doesn't mean that every female impersonator is a rapist, but it definitely does mean that women cannot afford to believe they're safe to be alone with these men.  As I say, I don't write about F2Ts, but if you want to know: They were four times more likely than normal women to be convicted of crime (aHR 4.1, 95% CI 2.5 to 6.9) and seven times more likely to be convicted of violent crime (aHR 7.2, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.4). They were no different from real men in these rates, maybe slightly less overall (aHR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.1; aHR 0.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.6).  I call male transgenderites by that forbidden word because they called themselves that until quite recently. Apart from the misogyny, gaslighting, whining about victim-hood and body mutilation, 99.9% of male transgenderism is about language policing. I'm not going to play along."

GenderCritical,3almq0,caroline199,14,Sun Jun 21 13:32:04 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand it. It was one thing when some dudes wanted to wear skirts and wigs for whatever reason -- party however you like, I don't care. It was yet another thing when some dudes wanted to get surgery and hormones to make their physical body match whatever mental image they had. But this insistence on invading women's spaces, laying claim to women's experiences, on defining women and then claiming that they embody that definition (in some cases more-so than actual women), it's just beyond explanation to me.   I can fully understand someone hating their body; I can understand well enough wanting to have one that doesn't correspond to gender (or, hell, even human biology). It's not that hard to envision it. But this whole women equal long hair and tits and I want long hair and tits so therefore I am not only a woman but the rest of you need to STFU about stuff like periods and PIV rape because that kind of stuff doesn't concern me and anything that doesn't concern me isn't woman stuff because I am woman. WHAT?  Is it really just that so many of my fellow heterosexual men are that threatened by women, that bothered that lesbians are lesbians and thus not open for business, that screwed up because the gender roles have been eroded some (not nearly enough, but some), that they're flipping out? I can't help but wonder if there's something more to it -- overpopulation or too much media or something making a segment of the male population completely bonkers.   Sorry, feeling ranty.

Porn and loneliness.  That's what I think it is, at the root of the analysis.  Nearly all of the younger MtT are heavy, heavy porn consumers whose main sexual outlet is often masturbation. They're also often socially isolated men with very little contact with actual, real, speaking, thinking women.  So nearly all of their experience and knowledge of women's hearts, minds, souls and bodies comes from watching porn (and listening to misogynists and MRAs who tell you how women have it soooooo easy in life, it's practically a free ride!)  When they ""become women"" (lol) what they become is a living depiction of the porn stereotype, an idea of women filtered entirely through male desires and requirements.  A lesbian in their bed is a trophy to be shown off to men and other MtT; she is the ultimate validation of their performance of ""woman."""

They barge into our safe spaces, overrun our conversations, police our language and thoughts, co-opt feminism to male concerns, etc and if any woman should express defiance or resentment at it, she's labeled a bigot and communally punished.

There's no such thing as a ""male lesbian"" -- the phrase itself is a ridiculous contradiction in terms and represents yet another attempt by men to define lesbians and lesbian sexuality.     Gilmartin correctly spotted that these men were different from other MtTs he was familiar with, but he completely missed the mark on why.  He contends that ""male lesbians"" are different because they're heterosexual and don't want bottom surgery.  In 1987 this probably was a rare and intriguing attitude among Trans, because at the time most men seeking SRS were very  effeminate gay men instead of straight men who like to play dress-up and check out their own asses in a mirror.  What is interesting to me is that almost 30 years later, the numbers Gilmartin was familiar with have flipped and the type of MtT he describes as a ""male lesbian"" is far more common in the Trans community than the old-school MtTs.  Now we're seeing bullshit like the cotton ceiling and ladystick/girl penis, because this type of MtT is an angry straight man with entitlement and misogyny issues rather than a gay man seeking to reconcile his gender performance with society's expectations.  But they're not ""male lesbians"" or women trapped in men's bodies any more than the earlier MtT; they are just autogynephiles whose cross-dressing and female identities are a sexual paraphilia.   The pull quotes from the men Gilmartin interviewed clearly show that these guys have about as much to do with actual lesbian identity, actual lesbian thinking and culture, as the man in the moon.  Instead they're just regurgitating the worst and most simplistic gender stereotypes about women, especially gay women, in asserting a ""lesbian"" identity based on porn viewing  and misogynistic socialization while the researcher laps it all up uncritically. (I find it grimly hilarious that Gilmartin was apparently too blinkered by his own sexism to ask some genuine lesbians to read his research, weigh in on his theory, or to assess the authenticity of the claims these men made.  You would think that would have been his first step, no?)"

They reap the benefits of male privilege, make a pile of money, retire, and then become the teenage girl or surgery-addicted Hollywood housewife of their fantasies.

Now instead of admitting that one of taproots of their pathology is a sense of failure at at being masculine and an idea that women have it easy in life, they insist that they're born in the wrong body and somehow more of a woman than we are.    Obfuscate it how they want, this quote sums up the whiny, entitled, self-centered MtT mindset pretty well:   Well, I don't know if I'd actually like to be a woman. All I know is that I've always envied women because they can play the passive role and still get married. I think our society is extremely cruel to men. It treats them like second class citizens all the time while women get treated like prima donnas. When you write your book I hope you emphasize the fact that men have feelings too. I mean, men are human beings too, and they have feelings just as much as any woman does. I think it's rotten and stinking the way it's always the man who is made to suffer--like in the military, for example. Just because a person happens to be a male he has to suffer all the horrors and indignities of the military establishment and the selective slavery system. If you're a man you're not supposed to feel any pain. You're not supposed to have any feelings. You're supposed to be just like a piece of steel and press forward no matter what harm or pain comes to you. Well, I was lucky in being able to avoid the military-- thank God! But when it comes to getting a woman there doesn't seem to be any way of getting around these extremely cruel social rules that insist that only the man can be allowed to make the first approach with a woman ....   Society is extremely cruel to men.  Men are second-class citizens.  Women are treated like prima donnas. Men suffer so much at the hands of women.  Got it.    And of course, the main plaint of every last pig in a wig out there, ""Why can't I GET a woman?!""  Well, maybe because women are not objects to be acquired but instead are each a person with their own history and their own record of suffering under patriarchy?

Violence become prevalent. Excess males strived for acceptance, were rejected and withdrew. Huddling together, they would exhibit brief flurries of violence amongst themselves. The effects of violence became increasingly visible. Certain individuals became targets of repeated attacks. These individuals would have badly chewed and scarred tails. Other young mice growing into adulthood exhibited an even different type of behaviour. Dr Calhoun called these individuals ""the beautiful ones"". Their time was devoted solely to grooming, eating and sleeping. They never involved themselves with others, engaged in sex, nor would they fight. All appeared as a beautiful exhibit of the species with keen, alert eyes and a healthy well-kept body. These mice, however, could not cope with unusual stimuli. Though they looked inquisitive they were, in fact, very stupid.   All of the ""beautiful"", grooming-obsessed mice in Calhoun's study were male.

GenderCritical,3aia68,87x8gfh,12,Sat Jun 20 13:51:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's sad but it's completely understandable, patriarchy is somewhat unique among systems of class-based oppression in that it dominates the female class but it also expects them to live right beside it. To uphold it, perpetuate it, and engage in it with a smile.   As much as I would love to see all women rise up and throw off the somewhat more superficial shackles like clothing (especially hijab, niqab, and abayas when they are worn out of duty to patriarchal standards) you have to recognize that there are severe penalties for doing so. So I don't blame women worldwide for failing to spontaneously begin the revolution. As always, I blame the patriarchy.   Basically in my current tentative opinion, by embracing feminine standards society has set for women (for example, wearing dresses, worrying about your appearance more than an average man does), women kinda give up their rights to complain. It just seems like the situation of having your cake and eating it too; you can't complain about the rules of the game, all the while playing.   I couldn't disagree harder.

Does the fact that I, as a member of the proletariat, have to sell my labor to earn money for rent and food mean I can't complain about capitalism, since I'm, as you said, ""playing the game""?"

(I probably should have mentioned in the original post how my perspective is very western-world-based and therefore narrow, I really don't know enough to talk about anything else so the post largely assumes all women have at least legal freedoms in making the choice.).   From that perspective, I'm completely baffled how in some libfem circles, GNC women are viewed worse than walking caricatures of femininity that so often are MtFs (don't mean to make this into another trans issue thread, just as an example) but basically, it's like you get double-punished when you're a woman performing less-than-femininity. The society in large disapproves because you're refusing to conform, and some feminists disapprove because they have a fundamental misunderstanding of sex and gender which makes them think that by wearing ties, you're suddenly their oppressor."
GenderCritical,3aia68,Reddwollff,5,Sat Jun 20 14:04:09 2015 UTC,"Jumping in here the issue is do we blame women for what is often a lack of choice on their part, or do we blame the actual cause - a male supremacist society which forces women to comply, and which imposes on women that double-bind you point out where you are doubly punished. It's like motherhood, I've noticed it's not motherhood of itself that gets praised, it's the qualities mothers are supposed to have (sacrificing all to the needs of the child for instance, being kind, being caring, all that stuff women are socialised to do from birth). You can be the wrong sort of mother very easily, just try being too young, or even too old. Not properly attentive and devoted - I mean, I've looked up ""world's worst mother"" and the first example of this was a woman that left her kids with her mother to go on holiday, then didn't come back. Oh, dear.   Liberal feminism isn't feminism to me, it's male identified and it's not really all that surprising that women do this as it's a way of negotiating life even if obviously wrong instead of having to fight every inch of the way (and even then, you still end up fighting every inch of the way anyway but never mind that!). In this case, it's extremely individualistic and the movement if you can call it that disengages women's 'choices' from the larger picture. This makes it easier for the individual, they don't have to think about what they are doing and why. They can spout words like 'objectification' but this is divorced from any kind of analysis, they don't even try and look at those things in context. There's a kind of blindness there I think. Intersectionality is used as a way to dismiss feminist analysis even though when it is done properly it takes in race and other issues by default but it is still characterised as exclusive. I do wonder if this is done as a means to legitimacy, as this quote from Andrea Dworkin's Right Wing Women shows. Women of themselves have no legitimacy as full human beings and our voices often fall into silence, it's a hard and harsh fight to assert yourself. If you include men, as you must do if you look at race and class issues alone or make those paramount, there can be some legitimacy gained by including males within the group. In effect, adding in real humans in there means maybe they will be heard.    ""The accounts of rape, wife beating, forced childbearing, medical butchering, sex-motivated murder, forced prostitution, physical mutilation, sadistic psychological abuse, and other commonplaces of female experience that are excavated from the past or given by contemporary survivors should leave the heart seared, the mind in anguish, the conscience in upheaval. But they do not. No matter how often these stories are told, with whatever clarity or eloquence, bitterness or sorrow, they might as well have been whispered in wind or written in sand: they disappear, as if they were nothing. The tellers and the stories are ignored or ridiculed, threatened back into silence or destroyed, and the experience of female suffering is buried in cultural invisibility and contempt… the very reality of abuse sustained by women, despite its overwhelming pervasiveness and constancy, is negated. It is negated in the transactions of everyday life, and it is negated in the history books, left out, and it is negated by those who claim to care about suffering but are blind to this suffering.  The problem, simply stated, is that one must believe in the existence of the person in order to recognize the authenticity of her suffering. Neither men nor women believe in the existence of women as significant beings. It is impossible to remember as real the suffering of someone who by definition has no legitimate claim to dignity or freedom, someone who is in fact viewed as some thing, an object or an absence. And if a woman, an individual woman multiplied by billions, does not believe in her own discrete existence and therefore cannot credit the authenticity of her own suffering, she is erased, canceled out, and the meaning of her life, whatever it is, whatever it might have been, is lost. This loss cannot be calculated or comprehended. It is vast and awful, and nothing will ever make up for it.” ― Andrea Dworkin, Right Wing Women"

Right and left wing, it's the same thing now if there ever was any difference. There's still that same thing there, the grasping for the illusion of choice which doesn't really exist for any of us.   Dworkin goes on to say in the next paragraph:    ""No one can bear to live a meaningless life. Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival: by attaching themselves to men and the values honored by men. By committing themselves to male values, women seek to acquire value. By advocating male meaning, women seek to acquire meaning. Subservient to male will, women believe that subservience itself is the meaning of a female life.

Ie, ""women are raped"" instead of ""men rape women."" ""Women face discrimination"" instead of ""men discriminate against women.""  Women playing the feminity game is an example of that. Women don't ""chose"" to wear make up. Men demand women cater to their sexual tastes. If women don't wear makeup? We face harassment and discrimination from men if we don't.  Also there is the concept of compulsatory heterosexuality. This has changed recently for more privileged white women, but often women would be forced to live in poverty or denined the ability to live alone. They had to pair up with men for their material survival. It wasn't long ago that it was legal to pay women far less, such as 75% less than men for the same work. Even now, with the wage gap and awful social safety net (in the US), meeting the male gaze and partnering with men is a matter of material survival for women.  What's the alternative for preforming femininity? Its social stigma at best and violence/lack of material welfare at worst. We have to remember that it was men who invented femininity, although many women enforce it on their daughters because they understand it's a matter of material survival. (See foot binding)"
GenderCritical,3aia68,arbormama,9,Sat Jun 20 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"The libfem position fails a simple thought experiment: can a woman choose not to be a feminist?  If all choices made by women are feminist, by definition, then she can't, because her choice not to be a feminist is a choice and therefore is feminist.  This, in turn, suggests women do not have a choice about being feminists, which is anti-feminist, because feminism requires choice.  We've come to a paradox.  Your position, however, fairly condescending.  Even if we limit ourselves to the Western world, I doubt that most gender-conforming women feel oppressed and if you're going to argue that they are oppressed in spit of their feelings, then you have offer some data or some way to measure oppression.  They aren't doing what I think they ought to, ergo they are oppressed, isn't a very compelling argument.  In the long run, I think the radfem movement is going to have to come to terms with the gender-conforming majority because they are natural allies in the political process: they also want single-sex bathrooms, they also have a dim view of prostitution, etc.  Radfems are tiny, tiny minority of women.  If you want to win these fights you need allies."
GenderCritical,3aia68,prudemare,10,Sat Jun 20 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"The idea that women literally have to wear makeup to survive, is one I see too often. I'm sure there's some women in that position, but most are not. They're choosing the path of least resistance and I can definitely sympathize with feeling let-down. It's not a feminist choice to wear makeup, but aside from that, it's probably best to just live and let live.   I've recently been feeling the pangs of seeing women who took the patriarchal fast path to 'success'... Beautify themselves, find a rich man, get pregnant, etc. It's a valid option, I can understand choosing that route. I'm a little jealous, but it's all an illusion you know? Because she doesn't really have power at the end of the day, he does. It's luck or his choice to maintain her standing, and if she raises the kids and fucks him and stays pretty and does everything to a standard, will he still value her when she's 50? Will she be cast out at some point or will she get a judgement that will keep her in comfort for all her life? Who knows. Win or lose though I am choosing something else."
GenderCritical,3aia68,prudemare,6,Sat Jun 20 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"In a lot of ways, I was having variations of that archetype in mind. While I really would never take it upon myself to criticize someone else's life choices on a personal level, in theory, it makes me sad. Basically for the similar reasons you describe; it's not really power if you have to stay in a man's good graces to have it. I just feel such a life is more or less inevitably humiliating on some level; I just can't seem to wrap my head around the fact people willingly give up their agency and willingly subvert themselves to others but it seems to be acceptable or even preferable for a lot of women. I do know this comes off a bit as ""victim-blaming"" but I just feel it's important to talk honestly about some things.   The fact is, a lot of men would not feel ""right"" in such situations, I have known some who have basically been male golddiggers but they are so few and far inbetween. Men are told that they need to be self-sufficient at the least to be respectful members of society (not to mention, they also need to be bread-winners if they have a family) and while I hate the system that tells them that, I don't think that's a bad message overall apart from it being gendered. There at least isn't an illusion of choice, I don't remember any campaign telling men their choices are valid whether they want to be a CEO or a homemaker.    I just wish more women would feel a similar way as well, that managing self-sufficiency is an integral part of human existence, be the human a man or a woman. That just finding someone to ""take care of you"" isn't really appropriate if you are a functioning adult."

The problem with that direction is given the current economic recession it is becoming difficult to meet this expectation for increasingly many people.

So I would prefer that we have less of this expectation on both genders (of making one's own money; guaranteed basic income is good) and/or find some other ways that people contribute to the community."
GenderCritical,3aia68,jennn92,5,Mon Jun 22 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"People do what they need to do. My issue with choosey choicers is not that they are making decisions for themselves, but when they try to say the act of making any choice is feminist. It's not. It depends on the damn choice.   I wear makeup sometimes. Often it's a creative outlet, often it's to help me get ahead. It's my choice, I made it after lots of pondering and thought, I recognize that in a perfect gender abolished world (which we don't live with obvs) makeup would be fine -- but that doesn't make my choice feminist and I'd never claim it was."
GenderCritical,3aia68,Eclectic58,4,Sun Jun 21 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"I admit I'd love women to collectively reject old patriarchal standards and men's opinions, whether it's in the name of feminism or just out of convenience, but I also think I shouldn't expect anything from people who do not share my political opinions and 'individualists' who do not care about the consequences of their personal choices. Thus, I don't really have any problem with women who ""play the game"" as long as they don't say it's a feminist act AND/OR as long as they admit feminine standards are still strongly influenced by thousands year of patriarchy. I say do what you want of course but just don't deny your personal tastes have been shaped by a culture with strong misogynistic views and when you contribute to this culture please don't say you're being feminist by doing so (even if you're doing it to survive). Individual choices are important for the individual but I fail to see how this 'choice' concept is a feminist thing. Why not find another word?   I do understand that a lot of women use femininity as an outlet for their sexuality and a big ""fuck you"" to puritanical standards which are a patriarchal device as well, so as someone who feels that sexual liberation is critical for all-around liberation, I'm feeling conflicted. Is it really empowering if it's just internalizing the male gaze?   Maybe what this type of feminists have internalized is the idea that gender is inherent: a woman performs feminity because it's in her brain, it's her essence. Thus, they understand misogyny as ""the hate of the feminine"" which is why they accept transwomen as women: they have female brain and they experience misogyny too because of course, misogyny is only the hate of pink, make-up, mini skirts and of course, 'sex work'! While I understand that feminity, pink, make-up, mini skirts and 'sex work' deserve a bit of recognation after all this time because it was definitely hard for women, it's also important to realize why they are considered inferior to blue, pants, natural looks and not doing sex work: because they are all things that have been used to turn women into objects for men. Many men get turned on by these things precisely because they see it (subconsciously or not) as a sign of your inferiority and conformity to your feminine role.  I'm not sure where I'm going with this comment but I'll just conclude by saying I'm wary of feminists who see feminity as something empowering but I'm more than willing to offer a new perspective of womanhood to women who grew up with only the male-centric idea of genders."
GenderCritical,3aia68,BrackenGold,4,Sat Jun 20 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"The thing is, many, if not most, people are neither questioners, nor particularly introspective.  They accept the culture in which they were born without question, whether or not their personalities fit comfortably with the stereotypes associated with their sex.  Their mindset is ""That's just how things are"" and/or ""That's the way we've always done it"".   They are not curious as to why things are that way or think that things might be different.  If they don't naturally fit, they see the problem as within themselves, and not with society, and they try harder to ""fit in"".  Fitting in and being like ""everybody else"" is the most important thing to them and they don't want to stand out in any way that would make them look less than ""normal"".  It's no wonder why depression and other mental issues are rampant in our society.  I never had this mindset, even as a kid.   I never accepted anything uncritically and was always concerned with what was fair and I wanted to know why things were the way they were.  I remember being in the first grade and the teacher saying, ""Now, we all like surprises now, don't we?""  I stood up and told her that I didn't.  I didn't give a crap about herding with the crowd.  Being able to think for myself is what led me to become a feminist as a young teen.  I understand the ""choice"" thing about feminism, but only up to a point.  Choice should be an informed thing and, clearly, some choices are better than others.  Of course, being a feminist isn't always consistent with being mature, and one's view of feminism often takes several years to go through stages of refinement to reach a more mature understanding"

The ministry did this to avoid human rights' complaints from M2Ts, but they may end up with said complaints coming from women inmates worried for their safety. The numbers are pretty small, so it hasn't been an issue thus far.

Well, it seems that, in and of itself, is indicative of the fact that transgenderism is itself a form of mental illness.  But for no other mental illness is the standard treatment to enable to symptoms.  And thinking you're born in the ""wrong"" body is just a symptom of the underlying root cause.  After all, anorexics are not treated with liposuction surgery, diets, and advice to loes more weight - why should this be any different.  I had one moron tell me on FB that there was NO other treatment for transgender feelings other than transition, though he did understand my comparison to anorexia.  But, have they even tried cognitive therapy?  And this crap about not ""matching"".  I've asked several of them, ""Why do you have to 'match'"" and not one could give me a straight answer - as if it never occurred to them that you don't have to ""match"" and that there' s really no ""matching"" to be concerned about because personality traits are not innately sex-linked."

That is, you can read numerous trans individuals saying that any reference to female biology is cissexist; or that trans are biologically female; but when you confront this, you're told ""Oh, nobody thinks that. That's a crazy terf strawman"". And the next thing you see is trans pushing for, say, rights to use women's health services, based on that fact they are biologically women. This seems to happen a lot. I don't know whether it's because a) there's no consensus on these ideas (which, because they are mostly made-up baloney, isn't surprising) or b) the movement is fundamentally dishonest. Whichever it is, I don't think a clear position is too much to ask for before we start changing laws, or the language.

It's usually used with a mean (and here I even wanna say catty) tone, and I just think going around insulting people is counterproductive.

However, we are in a crisis situation with autogynephiliacs somehow successfully attempting to shift scientists' understanding of biology, linking up with global poilicy-makers to implement laws and policies that will force normal people to fulfill their fantasies, and coerce gender-noncompliant kids & teens into medicalized transsexualism. Also, making well-intentioned but ignorant people believe that ""gender identity"" is real. It is necessary to be strident so that people will pay attention.  Also, as MundiMori suggests, with harsh language-policing and butt-hurt demands for others to play along both key components of male transgenderism, I am reluctant anyway to change my lingo.

I expect medical ethicists to weigh in next. The ""treatment"" of childhood transgenderism is extreme, is associated with many adverse effects and is not evidence-based. Treating it as a super-special condition in which the usual medical standards are suspended is not going to fly, now that it's not under the radar anymore. Oh, and so much for ""all the doctors agree."""

Mark New York, NY 18 minutes ago  Dr. Spack writes in favor of the pubertal-blockers approach. I found it interesting that Cretella, Trumbull, and Grossman write that ""puberty brings relief for the vast majority of children receiving therapy for [gender identity disorder], as hormone surges propel the development of their brains as well as their bodies, and they come to identify with their biological sex."" And the proponents of pubertal blockers respond, ""gender dysphoria persists and worsens with onset of puberty in up to 20% of gender non-conforming youth, and it is for this defined subset of youth that pubertal blockers can be life-saving."" In other words, they concede the point. A basic question should be, do the kids need this treatment, or are they going to grow out of it? And apparently both the proponents and the critics agree that 80% grow out of it. If that is true, why did Dr. Spack leave it out? Should kids with gender dysphoria be rushed into blocking puberty if, in the majority of cases, puberty itself is what gets them out of it? What am I missing here?

GenderCritical,3a71qt,languidswan,16,Wed Jun 17 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"The term is nonsense. I am not ""trans exclusionary"", because my feminism regards people as equals regardless of whether they are one gender, the other, or something in between.  What that equality means is that no one individual can undermine the integrity of the lived experiences of a group of people ('women') simply because they wish they were a part of that group. That is appropriative, wrong, and an attempt to divorce womanhood from the lives of women.  ""Trans exclusionary"" has become a term used to refer to people who refuse to privilege the experiences of a vanishingly small minority over those of women as a whole. And yes - there is no getting away from the ultimate misogyny of it: it treats female people's experiences as being of less value than the experiences of males. It robs women of the freedom to define themselves and have their own self-conception respected."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,lolreallyno,14,Wed Jun 17 19:14:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Another thing that seems completely illogical is that the libfem definition of feminism applies to ""women"" as they define them (woman as a ""gender identity"") and therefore saying feminism is for human females (people who have a specific reproductive capacity) is exclusive.   The thing is that the first thing (gender identity) the way it's defined is completely subjective, while sex is objective. How can you have a movement that caters to  people based on their internal state?   The whole point of feminism is to correct the fact people are being discriminated against and oppressed based on their reproductive capacity. Feminism shouldn't stand for transwomen because transwomen are not opressed based on their biology.   They don't run the chance of being impregnated by rape, of being denied birth control, prenatal care or a string of life opportunities for their reproductive choices. Not that being trans is all fine and dandy, but those problems should not be the focus of feminism."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,itazurakko,7,Wed Jun 17 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's very much the situation of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"".

And if you do have kids, then you're just another ""soft woman"" and everything you do will not be quite good enough as what a man does because you're ""not 100% in it"".   I saw someone put it (in an admittedly gross but surprisingly accurate term) as ""fuckability"". If you aren't, there's something wrong with you and you lack your worth as a woman, and if you are, then you ought to use it the exact way the society tells you it's appropriate. Why anyone would opt into that bullshit is beyond me."

She better be thin, a size 0, conventionally beautiful, and always sexually available.

It sounds like ""I want to join the radfems but they don't want me!"".  And the whole thing doesn't make sense: radical feminists are not the only ones who don't believe the trans religion, different feminists probably reject them. And are they going to call some MRAs who think you can't become the opposite sex ""trans exclusionary RADICAL FEMINISTS"" too?! Hell, pro-radical feminism trans people exist, do they exclude themselves too or???  Why not just make a distinction between people who believe in brain sex and those who don't? It would be more peaceful, people are entitled to believe what they want... But I feel like this is precisely what genderists don't want: without all the silencing and shaming, people would understand that gender-critical people are the ones saying gender roles are bullshit while genderists are saying gender roles are in our brains and you can just match your body with the right roles.  In the end, TERF is just a term to shame women for not accepting anything, doesn't this sound familiar?"
GenderCritical,3a71qt,LovingLilith,13,Fri Jun 19 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"The really funny thing is how male centered the term is.  ""TERFs"" don't exclude FTMs from female spaces  Only MTFs.  We are MALE exclusionary radical feminsts.  By acting like we exclude all trans people, the implication is clear: the only trans people who count are the ones born with dicks."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,LovingLilith,8,Fri Jun 19 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, that reasoning also means you see female trans people as women so it would never make sense to exclude them since you'd be excluding yourselves by definition. Also I really doubt a truly male-looking female would be super welcome in the women's restroom in practice.  However, it's very true that FTMs are often totally left out by most transactivists. There is occasionally lip service paid to them and even less attention is given to genderqueer or whatever other loosely defined third-genders that are never talked about yet still considered equal to the others. They're only brought up when preaching to the choir or re-enforcing some point about gender fluidity. In other situations they just confuse the narrative of ""always being other gender since childhood."" It's much tougher to say ""I've always been either gender since childhood.""  This is coming from a genderqueer person btw. I don't have any answers here, no shit-nugget of wisdom to give to the poor cis-ciety. It's why I like it, it's a bit like going politically stealth. I don't have to answer for anything and don't feel like stabbing myself whenever Bruce Jenner is brought up yet again from the perspective of another boring ideology. I think CNN over satellite radio was the first and most neutral source I heard the story from and hearing them talk about how the photo was ""very feminine, very sexy"" made me want to blow my brains out."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,BeeeboBrinker,7,Thu Jun 18 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"I think there needs to be more talk like this deconstructing the term TERF. I always thought the whole ""it's a slur, let's ban it"" thing is giving too much power to your detractors. It sounds technical and official so you can't really say 100% it is an insult even though it functions as one. It's like how you would kind of be suspicious of someone who always said ""homosexual"" instead of ""gay"" yet they'd be using a perfectly fine technical definition.  The real course of action would be to have a straight-forward practical answer to why TERF is not a good definition of what being gender critical is about. I think GC is a concept that transcends radical feminism even. It could have more influence that way with the risk of becoming as wishy-washy as other similar ideas. But I think it's interesting to think of how it could possibly be thought of as not exclusively ""Radical Feminist"". Not really sure how that would ever be done or if anyone else would find that desirable. Point is: in this way the ""RF"" portion can be disrupted.  As for the Trans Exclusionary part, that actually implies there is some need to include trans people in everything that an immutably-gendered person is part of. To me sports is a fantastic example of this. A male who goes through their normal puberty is going to have a different bone structure than a perma-female. That is just how it is, it's a huge advantage in combat sports and many others. So what about people taking HRT before puberty? Well that is another can of worms with its own moral quandaries that could be endlessly debated. Overall I find it preferable to the constant snarky bathroom chatter. Can we fast-forward to gender neutral single-stalls and call it a century?  The other big hit to the ""TE"" portion of TERF is the idea that all trans people have the same experiences as gender-locked humans. It's clearly different in a fundamental way. There is not some magical switch that changes your entire past, you've simply re-framed it. Which is fine, we do this a lot. It's hard to pull a person together over time, but respect the journey; don't dress it up with some shallow narrative thrust on you by a gender obsessed society.  Well, that's how I would frame it but that's coming form a TERF sockpuppet so there you go. The real issue is they hate you and you hate them so it's not like there is a real debate happening here anyway. I'm not being preachy here or saying ""be nice"". This is all due to there being no end game here. There is an insistence that trans people aren't truly hated but no real conceptual backing for that statement.   In a way it's ok, the purpose of philosophy isn't to provide answers, it's to ask the right questions. In this sense GC asks the right questions. However radical feminism needs to provide answers if it really wants to be considered a movement. There isn't a clear plan for how a society should  look after RF gets its way. It is too easily depicted as a bunch of curmudgeonly crones who won't leave the poor transkids alone. Just needling the opponent isn't enough. Running a hate-train through every Bruce Jenner story isn't going to do anything besides draw in more myopic haters. A clear vision for what is aimed for must be realized even if there is not a clear path to get there. The people who are today labeled as ""Trans"" are going to be a part of that imagined world. Simply formulating a picture of that world is inclusive to trans people by any meaningful definition. This is a truly radical way to dispel any perceived harm (or ""exclusion"") to trans people.   Not saying there is some right answer here or you have to become liberal feminists or anything like that. There is a constant pattern of micro-analysis of all these news stories which is understandable but I'd like to see more thought about GC as its own subject. My favorite posts here are the ones that make me think about gender in new ways. These types of posts are few and far-between compared to all the ""trans news story"" posts. Again, I get why that is, not saying you should stop, but I wish there was a stronger sense of GC and RF as something that exists outside of purely trans-related issues if that makes any sense.   Again, not being a concern troll or saying to never mention trans stuff. I think it would be a valuable rhetorical tool to be able to discuss these things without having to use the language of your opposition or to have to avoid using it altogether and seem petty. As an exercise try to think of a good elevator pitch for GCF or RF without mentioning transgender politics.  ex ""Gender is not a binary, it is a hierarchy and you already know who's on top. This hierarchy is defined by a person's sex and needs to be abolished if there is to be equality between the sexes. In the world defined by GCF there is no social pressure to conform to any gender role. People will never again have to poop or pee or be naked around each other ever.""  You get the picture.  Edit: to be absolutely clear that last line of the pitch was a joke, please don't take it seriously/combatively and for the love of god don't take it literally"
GenderCritical,3a71qt,LovingLilith,6,Thu Jun 18 04:35:59 2015 UTC,"I love this comment! I think trans people are really good at tricking people into thinking they should care. The whole concept of ""gender identity"" is exotic, I don't think anyone is indifferent about it. Most people have a strong opinion about it, positive or negative.   The point is, they have defined gender critical feminists as ""trans-exclusive"", that's not the point or the goal of gender-critical feminism. I think a different, less toxic perspective is desperately needed; it's not that we don't care about transwomen, it's that we care about women.   Unfortunately yes, GC feminists have in a lot of ways been shunned from mainstream feminist circles, so there is a very large need for venting and having your unpopular opinions confirmed in the space of people who start from the same axioms you do but it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy; someone looking from the outside in wouldn't see this as a response to the attack, they would probably think ""what have those poor trans people done to them?"". Not that we need to care about PR or anything, but it's an interesting thing to notice.   Let libfems be the bullies, they do it so well already. Anyone reasonable can see that you can't yell at people for not caring about something. I have a right to have a movement for only women who have green eyes if that group of people holds special interest to me, brown-eyed women attacking me for it are out of line, anyone would be able to see that."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,genderfeelz,4,Thu Jun 18 08:11:34 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. This is not ""venting.""  Far from disturbing people ""looking from the outside in,"" the discussions we have here provide confirmation that the emperor has no clothes. Many people here did not start out sharing the same axioms. This sub is frequently discovered by people who are accused of being TERFs or whose private questioning brings them to Google the term ""gender critical."" I care a lot about PR. That's why I'm here, helping to expose the relentless trans PR onslaught."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,Sojourner_Truth,2,Thu Jun 18 10:10:21 2015 UTC,"Well thank you! Love the feedback! I've been arguing that PR is really the losing battle here. It's not a good situation when you're trying to spread a message yet are vilified for being part of the group spreading that message.  For this reason I don't see radical feminism really being able to play a big role in the coming debates over these issues. It will be influential, has been influential, but it will most likely never be acknowledged for any contribution. It's too extreme in its position to be associated with in the current political landscape.  My only hope is that trans becomes an accepted category to the point that deterministic trans politics becomes less necessary and people are willing to see it as a lifestyle choice. This way it can be talked about in much closer approximation to the truth of the situation rather than a discrimination-based discussion. It's taking the long way around through liberal politics rather than the direct route through radical politics. Not super happy about that but it just seems more likely to me. In a way it's like how you don't really have to think of homosexuality as a biological truth to support gay rights. Establishing that gay people don't have a choice is a good way to get people on board but ultimately there is no reason we should care if one chooses to live that way. I'm not saying the situations are exactly similar, but it's the same kind of argument that is used by trans-activists and that's by design.  This also means it will probably be flawed in the same ways. We have marriage equality whereas we should have fought for marriage abolition. Likewise we are getting a kind of gender equality rather than striving for gender abolition."

My favorite posts here are the ones that make me think about gender in new ways.    I agree with this of course, but: Am I imagining things, or didn't feminism used to be basically synonymous with being gender critical before it was invaded by ""choice"" fetishism, pornstitution apologists, pomo bullshit, etc? I seem to recall, for example, that when I was growing up there was a lot of feminist analysis on images of women in advertising and popular culture and how these reify harmful gender roles. Now even that sort of basic, not particularly envelope pushing analysis isn't ""permitted"" unless you want to be pilloried for ""slut shaming"" or destroying someone's agency (or transphobia, in the case of Meghan Murphy's take on Laverne Cox's nude photoshoot).   We're deep in the backlash and have been put on the defensive, which has a deleterious effect on the state of feminist discourse."

GenderCritical,3a71qt,LovingLilith,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is right. I don't know why I wasn't even thinking of those actual radfem ideas as I wrote my post. I think it's from mainly seeing radical feminism through this sub which is so focused on the trans issue. In a way the point is still valid because that's how a lot people view this sort of radical feminism. They don't claim to have a problem with the other stuff but getting over the GI hurdle is required to really be able to analyze those issues.   Like you said, GC analysis is a fundamental basis for feminism. It's been there the whole time and in this way I think it still transcends feminism. If the gender divide was structured differently GC thought would still be the tool you would use to find an imbalance. That kind of gender critical thinking has always been there, but I was stuck on the more modern understanding of GC that was laid out by Rachel Ivey. I'm not sure if she coined that usage but it's the first time I heard about it and I love that video.  As much as I'm receptive to it and agree with it's points I argue this formulation of GC is not strong enough. It does a good job of differentiating libfem from radfem but that is kind of the problem. GC should be able to stand on its own as it's the basis for all feminism worthy of the name. It's something you could practice without necessarily thinking of yourself as a feminist. Although there are always ways of twisting any ideology.  It's tough to deliver the message when it's defined from the top-down in connection to radical feminism. It's hard enough to generate support for anti-porn and anti-media-objectification-of-women. The current politics seems totally unreceptive to those ideas. I see a more concrete formulation of GC philosophy as a way to gap that divide rather than being yet another hurdle."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,87x8gfh,3,Thu Jun 18 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"Radical feminism is about a lot more than the petty trans issue. If you want to figure out what the end game for radical feminism is, go to /r/worldfeminism and see what issues need to be resolved, or consume the work of radical feminists. It's out there even though it's not readily available, but thanks to the Internet (and to a lesser degree the universities), you can obtain it.  The people in this subreddit aren't necessarily radfems, I've noticed. I think some of us are, but others may have their own reasons for being gender critical. Indeed gender critical vs gender essentialism reaches beyond radical feminism."
GenderCritical,3a71qt,wanderingwomb,3,Thu Jun 18 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"It's pretty embarrassing that I missed that when I was writing that post. Thanks for reminding me how much actual practice goes into radical feminism. It all seems to be overshadowed by the trans stuff which is sad.  There is some push back in regards to female objectification in media, gamergate really showed that people are starting to see the problem. Not everyone is satisfied by the absolutely insulting portrayal of female bodies, especially with the extent of it in the game industry. Unfortunately it also shows how far we have to come. A lot of people are not for changing the status quo at all. The bigger problem is that the biggest enemies here are industries that have billions of dollars behind them.   In the US we have to live with the now established political fact of money equating to speech. It is not a bug but a feature according to the supreme court. This means we have to somehow generate more money than the porn industry. In no way is that possible with the limited support radical feminism currently has.  This is why I'm much more interested in getting the ideas developed more rather than trying some sort of action. Besides the fact that I'm a broke student I do legitimately see a greater value to be gained by really putting thought into it and having a cogent vision of the future rather than devoting my life to something that may ultimately prove fruitless.   That's not to take anything away from anyone doing actual work to bring about change. I am honestly just too lazy and pessimistic to spend my entire life on the problem. And the majority of people are that way. There has to be a way of opposing power that does not involve constant participation from everyone. It's just too unrealistic to expect that to happen any time soon.  Sorry if that was one giant tangent. Thanks."

Or to stop calling them waves, whatever, but yeah.  Thing is, everyone participates in culture. Some people, maybe a lot of people, just go with the status quo.

GenderCritical,3a64gk,La_Diabla,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""gender fluidity"" has a different meaning for models, which might explain why Ruby Rose focuses solely on appearance when defining the term. She's not androgynous, like Jenny Shimizu, but she doesn't present as strictly ultrafeminine, either. Her look is versatile, and, within the context of modeling photoshoots, she can read as one gender or another by changing her appearance.  Here's the thing, though. A definition that applies in the modeling world doesn't necessarily translate into day-to-day life, which is why Rose's reasoning comes across as adolescent and reductive. Plus, she meets a normative beauty standard, even with her tattoos and edgy haircut. Like, is it particularly radical or daring to adopt an ""atypical"" appearance, when you know that a wide swath of people will still consider you incredibly gorgeous and desirable?   On the other hand, I think it is really helpful to have people out there who openly reject the idea of a gender binary, and who are celebrated because of it. Ruby Rose's ideology may be relatively unevolved, but she is still a good example when it comes to unapologetic self-acceptance. Instead of focusing on changing her body through surgery and hormones, she experiments with gender expression until she finds something that feels comfortable for her. And I think that's an appropriate counterpoint to the idea that someone who has gender identity issues must be transgender. That isn't always the case - in fact, it probably isn't for most people. So Ruby Rose's visibility will hopefully encourage more expansive thinking."

Dr. Spack recalled being at a meeting in Europe about 15 years ago, when he learned that the Dutch were using puberty blockers in transgender early adolescents.  “I was salivating,” he recalled. “I said we had to do this.”   Salivating, huh?  Salivating.  That's the word you're going with for your NYT quote.  Well, that's not creepy at all.  And this is just terrifying:   With that in mind, Oregon’s Medicaid began covering the gamut of treatment, regardless of age, in January. Patients as young as 15 do not need parental consent.

And speaking of terrifying:   Kat’s surgeon, Dr. Christine McGinn, estimated that she had done more than 30 operations on children under 18, about half of them vaginoplasties for biological boys becoming girls, and the other half double mastectomies for girls becoming boys.   The young man profiled in the article seems fairly typical of the latest crop of MtTs (white, no history of overtly ""feminine"" behaviors or preferences, deeply into IT/video games, ""identifies as lesbian""). In the article they describe his cutting, and in the video he says that he felt that that something was always ""off"" about him. This is an incredibly common feeling in adolescence and beyond. Adults and medical professionals should be sending him to a therapist and encouraging him to dissect and analyze and own and embrace his “offness”, not trying to pin his feelings of despair and disconnection on ""gender identity"" and giving him a neovagina. If anything these feelings are now probably going to intensify when the irreversible surgeries and ""trans lesbian"" identification do not yield the expected gains."

I made a comment on a post about voter turnout in Mississippi last year being only 31.9% of registered voters and a trans woman I've never met went off because, after my resignation, I have no right to speak about statistics. Then claimed that I attacked her.  How does that make sense?  I wrote my piece after 24 days of madness. There are at least a dozen articles, podcasts, blogs, and diaries out there about me right now. I made a response to them after speaking with Kevin Naff of The Washington Blade who suggested I write an op-ed in response to the one sided and biased ""truth"" that was posted to Planet Transgender by Claire Kohler. I deserve the right to share my side of what happened.  I seriously have no way of making this right as long as you all continue. I will never be able to help trans people if people like you continue calling me transphobic in the national eye.  Across the Internet for almost a month my gender, my genitalia, my orientation, my career, my qualifications have been questioned, debated, chosen for me, and examined by strangers. In no way should this be considered an acceptable thing to do. As a trans woman you know that if someone were to ask about your genitalia, it would be wrong. I've had people ask to see my dick as proof that I am cisgender. What if someone asked to see your vagina as proof that you are Trans?  You. Would. Crucify. Them.  I know full well the privilege I posses as a white, nontrans man. I have used said privilege to shed light and educate those in my state-- a state you've never been to-- so that my trans siblings can find peace and acceptance. I have no need to spout off my résumé to anyone as proof, but it is very easily said that in this state I am (was) one of the leading activists and advocates for Trans rights. That is no longer the case because you got offended by someone you've never met, now the people I could have helped are the ones who will suffer, while you-- you get to go on with your life feeling superior and innocent as if you've done no wrong.  In that post you shared, the one which you state is me reclaiming cisgender, you are again-- taking it out of context. I only referred to myself as cisgender because, at the time, I was being forced to BY YOU. I was stating that the Trans community has one less privileged person fighting for them. I am not above the word, I do use it when it makes sense. I never said it is offensive to everyone or is even an offensive term. In the academic sense this word makes sense, I've used it numerous times. However, in my personal life I do not use it as a descriptor of myself. The post I made that got you involved was me simply asking my friends to not refer to me by a word that I do not use to define myself. Cisgender means not trans, right? So how is me saying that if my gender must be defined and qualified against Trans, I prefer the term ""nontrans?"" It means the same thing, but it's what I prefer.  I have this right, just as you do. If you wanted to be called a zeebop, I would call you a fucking zeebop. Why? Because you decide who and what you are. Not me. It doesn't have to make sense, you define you define you.  Though, I have a different word than zeebop that I use to define you. I won't that here.  by GayJeff on Wed Jun 17, 2015 at 03:23:59 PM PDT"

GenderCritical,3a4bvv,BeeeboBrinker,2,Wed Jun 17 03:29:58 2015 UTC,"So, it seems like people in the comments are debating whether cis/trans is a spectrum and someone said this:   Jeff White is uncomfortable being called cisgender because as a gay man he is not fully concordant with the usual expectations of a heterosexual cis man. The trans activists feel that everyone who does not identify as trans are therefore cis; White feels that there is a gray area in between.   Since when is cis/trans linked to sexual orientation? Is heterosexuality a cis thing, homosexuality a trans thing? Not very surprising though since one of transgenderism's original purposes was to 'cure' homosexuality by making the person's sexuality match with their sex because homosexuality is too wrong and means wanting to be the opposite sex to many people, like how many times have I heard ignorant people saying gay men want to be women and lesbian women want to be men. ""I am man, I like football and I like men: I am in between cis and trans, in between right and wrong!"""
GenderCritical,3a4bvv,jennn92,2,Thu Jun 18 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"Well, there's the rub. Technically, and as they push it the term just means non-trans, but in practical terms it is loaded with implications about how you relate to yourself and the world and it  makes invisible the discriminations faced by gay people, women, people of various ethnic groups etc. Trans are the most oppressed, while a person in a group that faces discrimination holds 'cis' privilege.   It's a great rhetorical trick which diverts time and energy to trans, because resources tend to go to the place where the need is most there. Someone like Jeff comes along, they don't feel comfortable with this as they are gay and are discriminated against. They don't feel comfortable with urinals which are made to accommodate male anatomy being labelled transphobic. Doesn't feel comfortable with the label and the demands the world only be seen through trans eyes and demands that the world accommodate them in every way, including everyone tugging their forelock and humbly admitting to being 'cis' and therefore an oppressor."

GenderCritical,3a4k5r,jennn92,7,Wed Jun 17 14:52:49 2015 UTC,"The conservatives have one good point about liberals who accept transgenderism uncritically, without any questions, no matter how incoherent and/or nonsensical trans jargon and the trans view of reality is.  What I think it is, is that liberals pride themselves on being tolerant and not being narrow minded.  Not being narrow-minded has always involved accepting the weird, the eccentric, those who march to the beats of various different drummers, and those whose iconoclastic lifestyles vary from the White Bread America of the Silent Majority.    In most cases, it's a good philosophy to live by.   But weird and iconoclastic doesn't necessarily have to be divorced from reality, especially when it involves scientifically verifiable facts about biology.  But too many liberals have trouble knowing where the dividing line between simply being tolerant of different drummers ends, and accepting errant nonsense and bullshit begins.  Many liberals would rather swallow all sorts of gaslighting and Orwellian doublethink, than to risk being called a ""bigot"" and ""transphobic"" by standing up and calling out transgenderism for the sexist nonsense that is is.  But, unlike gender critical feminists, the usual conservative response to the fantasy world of transgenderism and other sorts of ""identity politics"", is to recommend doubling down on conforming to gender role stereotypes in order to ""fit in"" and be ""normal"". Conservatives are all about fitting in and being ""normal"", and many go to great lengths to avoid being different from the norm in any way; they are all about being ""like everybody else"".  Back when the second wave of feminism concentrated more on eradicating the gender system, conservatives responded by writing reactionary books, urging people to accept their ""God-given"" roles in society and in marriage of ""masculinity"" and ""femininity"" and there were books on how to better instill these stereotyped qualities in children.  Their buzz word was ""complementary"" to oppose ""egalitarian"", with ""complementary"" being the same ol' ""separate, but equal"" in new psychobabble garb.  But, as with the racial version of ""separate, but equal"", it was certainly separate, but never equal.  They don't get what the real problem is any more than trans activists do. Both believe that if your personality (gender) doesn't ""match"" your sex, then you must change.  You must ""match"" and you must change.  The only thing they disagree on is about what you must change.  Neither believes that you are ok just the way you are, without having to change either body or personality."

Unlike gay men, who are notorious for their blatant sexist treatment of women, transgender assumptions about womanhood are more positive but still shallow.  While their bodies transform and prepare to create life, will we expect them to put aside their own worries—again and as always—to succor and support a confused young boy?  Transgender theory relies upon traditional stereotypes of male and female. It has to. If a biological man does not have a notion of what is feminine, then he would have no context for feeling like a woman. By necessity, transgender women see biological women as a set of outward physical attributes and a certain way of thinking. Womanhood is about sexiness and beauty, the things they can imitate."

Jenner has appropriated a female identity to film a reality television show and become part of a community that isn’t actually his own. Pictures of him feature thick, flowing hair. His nails are long and brightly colored; his clothes sultry and fashionable. In photos, he arranges his very glossy lips into a pout, as if to present them as full and sexy.  In these stories and images, I see ladyface—he gathered limited and stereotypical notions about female aesthetics, using them to inform a “woman costume”—including getting fake breasts—to wear out into the world...  To label his assumed identity acceptable or authentic because he effectively played into extreme stereotypes about clothing and experiences is to buy into the flawed assumption that womanhood is only about how one looks and behaves. And if womanhood, and the female experience, is only performance, then what follows is the dangerous and incorrect assumption that women would be better off if they performed differently; if, in fact, they performed more like men."

But I never demanded that a generalist news site make everyone else shut up until they agree with me on issues of sexism (which is what 'educate yourself' means), because my beliefs can stand up to someone disagreeing with them, and because there were plenty of feminist sites I could go to for feminist-focused discussions. Seeing posters go full histrionic over how 'hateful' it is to ask very simple questions and how 'unsafe' they feel just blows my mind."

Yet another ""we make better women than you do"" piece of misogynist bullshit.   Eventually, I started wearing female underwear. It just sorta happened one day -- I didn't let myself think about it. At first it was sexualized, but eventually I stopped wearing boxers altogether and would go to work in a thong because it felt better.

When I was little, I did karate and hung out with the boys in the class.    I hated pink.  I didn't like to get dressed up in dresses, especially for school and I didn't wear makeup.  I was an only child for 8 years, so I was usually playing by myself, and I would pretend to be Simba, Mowgli, and Aladdin more often than princesses, because the princesses didn't have adventures that I found appealing as a small child. (Cinderella was always cleaning, which is not fun if you're seven)  The only female movie I really pretended to be was Mulan, because she got to go to war and fight people and kick butt.    Now I'm 24.  I wear dresses to work sometimes, but I still don't wear makeup.  I like ""dude"" movies and ""chick"" movies.  My younger siblings are in high school, the same school I went to, and they have at least one female friend who demands to be a boy now, because she likes ""boy things"".  If I was in high school right now, I would be pressured to do the same.    Whatever happened to the ""girls can do anything boys can do"" rhetoric from my younger days?  Is that no longer true?

GenderCritical,39xiow,The_Chairman_Meow,7,Tue Jun 16 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"An upvoted comment under the article:   As a cis person I'm really interested in how trans identity seems to be caught up in the binary concept of gender. Maybe if we didn't pretend to be so sexually dimorphic as a species, the trans identity wouldn't exist? Maybe it would, even if gender lines blur? People bring up trans-racialism to parody trans-gender/sex, but maybe in the future of body modification surgery that will be a thing too? What price your 'biological' identity then? It's an interesting world with interesting people in it, and they're only getting more interesting!   I feel like people get so close to the truth but they avoid it! Or they're just ignorant. They see something doesn't match, something is wrong... but they decide to see it as something ""interesting"" instead. This person also shows they don't understand anything either because seriously, how could transracial be a thing? HOW?! By tanning or whitening yourself? Using surgery? Yeah right, and when we copy a celebrity's make-up, we become her too. Tanning and cutting your penis don't change your genes, only mutations do that. But hey, maybe mutants will be a thing in the future who knows?  Why can't people accept the fact they're boys/girls with different tastes than other typical boys/girls??? The trans cult is like any other cult and it's like a drug, an addiction: it preys on depressed and extremely vulnerable people and ""heals"" them not by making these people respect/love their bodies and their personality but by literally aknowledging ""yes your body is wrong, your personality is wrong, change!"". This is why I only respect trans activists who aknowledge being trans is the result of mental issues/dysphoria or fetishes: I used to be anorexic with body dysphoria, couldn't stand even a little bit of fat/curves... Maybe if I was given a 70lbs body, it would have quickly made me feel better but it wouldn't have changed the fact I was mentally ill, someone disgusted by her own flesh, obsessed by what her body looked like, tormented by how people looked at it and what this body represented."
GenderCritical,39xiow,transsnarfleblort,10,Tue Jun 16 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"I used to write for Cracked.   One of the non-personal reasons I left the community was that I felt that David Wong, one of the editors, was becoming more and more of a social justice warrior. He's been an online acquaintance of mine since the late nineties/early aughts. He's a genuinely kind man with good intentions.   A few years ago one of their writers transitioned. I'm not sure if this co-writer is the same guy, since he kept changing his name from one feminine name to another. I had to unfriend him from my FB because I was sick of reading his posts about what a pretty pretty princess he is.   So anyway, I'm pretty open about my identity on the internet. So I just ignore big news items about trans people. But when the Rachel Dolezal situation went down I couldn't help myself and posted on FB about the obvious parallels to Bruce Jenner. A few Cracked writers responded, but no one was hostile. But I (perhaps stupidly) also wrote on a Cracked writer's FB post about how THERE IS TOTALLY NO COMPARISON BETWEEN BRUCE JENNER AND RACHEL DOLEZAL YOU GUYS COME ON. I didn't write anything inappropriate, only that I wished there was a level playing field somewhere that these issues can be discussed. I got a few responses, but honestly I'm too much of a coward to read them. I also don't want to be sucked into an argument vortex on someone else's FB page.     David Wong's shift to overt social justice warrior happened when his (very good) book was picked up by a big publisher. And it was an example of something I've noticed with comedians and comedy writers. When fame and money merge during a certain time in your life you become more sensitive to social issues. It doesn't necessarily make you less funny, but there's an element of shame you can conveniently ignore when you are closer to blue collar. Dave Chapelle left his show when he became important enough to hang out with Maya Angelou. Tina Fey publicly shamed Tracy Morgan after he told a terrible gay joke during his stand-up.   All of this is to say that I had really hoped to go back to comedy writing. And Cracked (at least when I wrote for them) is a great bunch of people to work with. But I think my outing myself as gender critical may have burned a few bridges."

That site used to be absolutely hilarious, these days it's about as funny as Oprah.  Seinfeld's right, political correctness is killing comedy... comedy is at its best when it's speaking truth to power but you can't do that if you're too worried about people's fee-fees, and that's what Cracked does these days.

The change in tone, like the inclusion of psuedo-interviews (An insider's look into deep web pedophiles? How the hell is that funny?) began shortly after I dropped away. Wong was becoming more and more vocal about his social politics, and the site has been reflecting that ever since.  Also, their podcast has never been particularly funny, but I don't think it's supposed to be. However, I'm saddened to admit that I stopped even attempting to listen to the episodes David Wong participates in. I really don't enjoy being lectured to unless I've signed up for it. And that's pretty much all he does anymore.   Interestingly, I've received one or two messages from readers asking me to please write more articles. They too have claimed that the site isn't funny anymore. I know that sounds like bullshit. (I certainly wouldn't believe me, but I'm cynical.)   Seinfeld's right, political correctness is killing comedy...   Aside from even comedy, have you noticed that political correctness has a tendency to change people's understanding of words? I began keeping a mental count of every time someone refers to anyone who's black as African American. For instance, in this review of HBO's The Leftovers the critic refers to the character Wayne as an ""African American cult leader."" Neither Wayne nor the actor playing him is American. He's English. The accent should have tipped the reviewer off, but we as a society are so quick to be PC we forget about the meanings of those PC words."

He also hated the term ""African-American"" because ""it's a convenient way for white liberals to pretend that black people don't exist.""  Using ""African-American"" to describe black Brits is especially strange because black, er, ""African-American"" culture is really quite specific to the US - a fact that I've been called racist for pointing out, because acknowledging that black culture exists at all is racist to the SJW mind... which IMO proves exactly what my professor was talking about."

GenderCritical,39w9ro,ViolenceIsTerrible,5,Mon Jun 15 08:57:46 2015 UTC,"Firstly, this is my first post on Gender Critical. I'm a bit nervous. I was assigned male at birth, even though I'm a transwoman. If this is a women-born-women space, and I'm not welcome, I'm sorry for intruding on your space. I also post on GenderCynical. Which I'm sure won't make GenderCynical or GenderCritical terribly happy.  But I agree with gender critical feminism and I like to be opened minded and extending olive branches between people. So I hope that either groups won't mind me too much posting in both. I'm influenced by both radical feminism and transfeminism.  And you may be thinking, ""who is NeoGAF and why should I care?"". And you're probably right. I'm not sure how relevant it is to talk about random forums on the internet and their opinions. And NeoGAF probably isn't as relevant here as reddit or even places like twitter or tumblr. NeoGAF is one of the biggest video game websites on the internet, especially one with such exclusive and difficult membership. And they're also known as one of the most progressive and feminist video game communities on the internet.   So much so that the racist, misogynist, homophobic, and transphobic group /r/NeoFAG was formed to mock them and, well, their not totally hateful beliefs(/r/NeoFAG is a hate-reddit that was recently rightfully banned, and the people on NeoFAG are disgusting misogynists). There's a lot of criticism out there of NeoGAF for being progressive and feminist in the gaming community. Especially as anti-feminist hate groups like GamerGate are prominent. But not so much from a progressive and feminist viewpoint. I visit there frequently, but don't have a membership, so I'm not allowed to comment. But I'm frequently disappointed by some of the things said on NeoGAF from a progressive standpoint, and after reading the thread, I was rather disappointed and wanted to express my disappointment in the very neurosexist perspectives being expressed and enforced in the NeoGAF community and elsewhere.  It seems on NeoGAF, and everywhere else I've been going, the subject of Rachel Dolezal has been bringing up the idea of ""transracial"" and the similarities and differences between race and gender. And it seems like, many people who believe that comparing race and gender is offensive and racist or transphobic, don't provide reasons for that which aren't based on neurosexism and biotruths.  It's a long thread, and I'm not sure how much anyone would want to be interested in the opinions of strangers to GenderCritical on a video gaming forum. But just in case, since the thread is so long, I'm going to try to make and effort to find many of the posts discussing gender and race and people claiming that race and gender should not be compared, because that would imply that people of different races have different brains. But being transgender is not, because they believe that men and women are ""different but equal"" and have different brains.  I'm posting this because I feel like it reflects how even many progressive parts of the internet have sexist ideas of men's and women's brains and believe in male supremacist biotruths.  The user Jarate in particular posts a lot of neurosexist claims when refuting transracialism. Here's his first neurosexist biotruth post in the thread. And perhaps where the first neurosexists posts started being made.  And here is BobbyRoberts, one of the people particularly expressing offense about Rachel and the concept of transracialism, that it's not comparable to being transgender, because sexist and male supremacist ideas about the brain are true.  And here is the first user claiming that comparing race to gender in any way is incredibly racist and offensive. Because people of different races don't have different brains. And indeed, that's true. There's an incredibly terrible history of racism and treating people of different ""races"" as having different brains. When race doesn't exist and neuroracism is incredibly racist and white supremacist. But has absolutely no problem with neurosexism. This person sees how treating people of different races as having ""different brains"" is racist, but doesn't seem to be aware or care about how treating different genders as having different brains, is incredibly sexist.  And the concern over the comparison for many people, seems to be, that people are encouraging racism by the comparisons, rather than questioning and challenging sexism.   More of the same type of posts: [1] [2] [3]  While I certainly don't think that race and gender are the same thing. The oppression of women and people of colour is both oppression. And while I am trans, I do think that assignment at birth is a part of oppression. You can't see genitals the same way you can see skin colour. And there are a lot of other differences between ""race"" and its various meanings and gender. And I sure don't believe there's any kind of differences in ""race"" and people's brains. It seems that people are very complacent in sexist assumptions about the brain. And cases like Rachel Dolezal's controversy show that thankfully, most of us as a society are moving past neuroracism. But sadly, not so much neurosexism."
GenderCritical,39w9ro,PomoNomo,5,Mon Jun 15 09:02:52 2015 UTC,"While we may disagree about many things, I appreciate the inside perspective. Neurosexism and biotruths are a serious anti-progressive issue. You're right to be against them, from a self-interest perspective as well: today trans people are embracing ""brain sex"" as validating, but tomorrow ""brain sex"" could be the justification for the erosion of their rights, much as brain pseudoscience has been in the past for women and minorities.  Again, even though you and I disagree about many things, I wish you luck in your attempts to challenge the prevailing neurosexist narrative. I read in another comment that you think it's the main concern of gender critical people. You might be right because it's on a lot of people's ""peak trans"" lists.   And anyway...   Trans people exhibit the same brain waves as the gender they want to represent as [link]   Uhm... [citation needed] lol. Brain waves? Seriously?!"

Even if people of different sexes, or races, or whatever, had ""different"" (begging the question: different how, even?) brains, it still doesn't suffice as moral justification for sexist, racist, or whatever oppressions. The ineffable differentness of persons should make no difference in their right to dignity, and in this case, in women's right to be free from suffocating stereotypes that men create to police and ultimately control our bodies. It's tragic that they're invested so heavily in whether or not brains are different.   And here is the first user claiming that comparing race to gender in any way is incredibly racist and offensive. Because people of different races don't have different brains.   It's like the only thing that stops them from being racist is the fact that people of different races don't have different brains.

GenderCritical,39t4q8,BetAle,5,Sun Jun 14 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no difference. I have yet to see anybody make an intelligent distinction between the two. Strangely, people's attempts have seemed to be mutually contradictory  Some say it is different because trans genderism has a biological 'cause' (trans people's brains are similar to the brains of the other sex)  Some say it is different because gender is a social construct, whereas race is based on a biological fact (of having dark skin).  Both of these are nonsense   (i) gender is also based on a biological fact, and the only thing which challenges this are trans individuals themselves - so it is a question begging argument.   (ii) race is also a social construct, just as much as gender is. They have as much a 'biological' basis as each other - gender almost certainly even more so.  But even if it were the case that trans people were the way they were because of something in their brains, that doesn't legitimise their identity over that of Dolezal. All it means is that the desire to identify as something which they are not has a different cause. The fact we can point to something in the brain to say 'this is why this person is trans' does not mean that they are the gender that they wish they were. It just means we can explain the desire itself. Womanhood is not a desire to be a woman, and to claim otherwise is - again - question begging. Womanhood is - like blackness - a lived reality that is thrust upon you regardless of your desires. You cannot opt into that category without appropriation of an experience which does not belong to you.  The conclusion is this: Dolezal is crazy, but Jenner is liberated - why? Well ... because 'we want them to be'. The retrospective rationalisations unfortunately don't do the job."

GenderCritical,39t4q8,DaaangerZooone,0,Wed Jun 17 07:39:09 2015 UTC,"I personally haven't come to a solid opinion about this issue either way yet, but I have been thinking this:  There was a time when the concept of gender identity wasn't even recognized in western civilization. Before enough people felt that this was a legitimate manifestation of the human condition, thereby prompting research to be done, you were either biologically male or female; anyone in between was expected to conform to the societal gender norms of the eras in which they lived (dressing the part, outwardly displaying acceptable gender traits, etc.), and any conduct otherwise was treated as deviant and possibly subversive.  Considering that it took centuries for transgender to be considered anything but a depraved offense, could it be possible that transracial might indeed one day be considered a recognized and accepted type of human trait?  After all, not every culture has quite the same focus on race that is so prevalent in the United States today.    The research might not exist now, but it doesn't mean it won't in the future."
GenderCritical,39t4q8,DaaangerZooone,-4,Sun Jun 14 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"Recent medical advances have influenced the manifestation of internal gender identity into an external representation in society (in the form of hormone therapy and invasive surgeries). This is entirely a product of current times, but does not negate the existence of what we now call ""transgender"" in people of different eras. Recorded history has had a tendency to ignore that which isn't the general norm, but if one takes the time to look into the past, they will find people and their inherent nature hasn't changed much throughout the ages. We love who we love, we like what we like, and we feel the way we feel."
GenderCritical,39t4q8,DaaangerZooone,-6,Sun Jun 14 21:37:31 2015 UTC,"People far enough in the past weren't thinking of the word ""transgender"" for many reasons, at times because English wasn't even the language of the time or place.  Just because the language has changed and expanded doesn't mean a tendencies existence was null.  You and anyone else have/has every right to be gender critical and and feel however you do about inherent nature or lack thereof.  As I said initially, I have not really made up my own mind on how I feel about this topic."
GenderCritical,39t4q8,DaaangerZooone,-2,Sun Jun 14 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"Dating all the way back to the times of Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt ,and ancient Indic cultures, there have been references to what was considered the ""third sex"".  The Vedas, which date from 1500 BC to 500 BC describe different categories of them.  These were people that that identified and lived as the opposite sex.  The practice still exists today in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Thailand to name a few places.  Only fairly recently in comparison has western society tried to define third gender as having to do with sexual orientation.  This history could possibly be evidence of transgender tendencies prior to modern times.    (Also, were you meaning to say transvestitism when referring to men dressing as women? Because one does not need to cross dress for sexual gratification purposes to be a transvestite by definition.  Also transvestitism is referenced in the hebrew bible, which would date the practice quite a bit.)"
GenderCritical,39t4q8,aztraelle,0,Mon Jun 15 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting your particular definition of transgender? I was under the impression that the literal definition is at this point in time ""denoting or relating to a person whose self-identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female gender"".  The existence of a related sexual compulsion or use of hormonal and/or surgical modification are not inherently required for the definition of transgender to be satisfied.  In fact the current definition actually includes third sex as one of the several types of transgender.   Although the ease with which piecing together clothing would have been vastly increased with sewing machines (too bad the couldn't figure out THAT technology LOL), there were still differences in male and female clothing and hairstyles. Any study of civilization includes analysis of their typical dress and differences therein.  Fashionable as some eras weren't, there were differences in how these sacks of fabric were cut and styled that were gender specific (and not just cut outs so that men could pee standing up lol)."

Really, that's the heart of the matter: our autonomy to determine and protect our own spaces.  Then we get screamed at for being ""gatekeepers.""  I give more weight to discussing autogynephilia because this new crop of MtT seems very different to me than their older counterparts.  Older MtT (like Jenner's age) tend to be successful men who have lived their whole life as men -- though with their fetish destroying their personal relationships, as Jenner's did with his wives and many of his children -- and who transition when they retire and can indulge themselves full-time in performing their fetish.  They are doing just what they want after reaping the rewards of a lifetime of male privilege, and their self-absorption doesn't allow for much time or inclination to act out hostility against women.    The younger set, on the other hand, seem to be driven by much different stressors to transition.  They feel like they've failed as men. They've failed at forming relationships with women, probably because the majority of them are crypto-MRAs without even realizing it. They are in their twenties and early thirties and have been raised on a steady diet of increasingly violent porn since their childhoods, and they see all women and especially all lesbians through that filter.   They expect sexual accommodation from women, even lesbians, as their right.  They are usually socially awkward, self-isolated, and incapable of sustaining even friendships and family relationships because of an overwhelming solipsism.  Their psyches turn inward and fester like an ingrown nail.  Their idea of women's minds is from porn, their idea of women's lives from MRA redpill nonsense, and their conception of women's bodies is a warped reflection built entirely from the perspective of the male gaze.  When they can't ""get"" the woman they know they deserve and are owed, they become that woman, their own obsessive love object, with endless preening and dressing up and ""girly"" trappings. But the fantasy is no fun without an audience, and a female audience since they are almost always straight, so now it's time to find a real girl to play along!  If that's not possible with a willing woman (or a conscripted one, like a bewildered partner) then they gratify their fetish by invading the spaces and privacy of unwilling women; relishing in their ability to force their way in and demand acceptance, relishing the fear and distress they cause to the women and girls whom they make uncomfortable with their unwanted presence.  They made us notice them, they made us pay attention to them, they forced us to acknowledge their fetish cross-dressed presence as a ""real woman.""    If they are denied that outlet, no matter what the area from women's health care to MichFest, they erupt in the frustrated rage of male entitlement.   Many of them genuinely hate women on a conscious or subconscious level, and of those a significant subset are violent.  They are the ones who worry me, far more than Jenner's ilk.  IMO they represent a significant threat not just to the gains of feminism and female solidarity, but also to the actual lives and safety of women in a way that the old guard never did."

Let me tell you this as a socially awkward person: We do recognize our need for a social group where they can participate. That's far from being ""solipsistic"" or ""living in one's own world""! Socially awkward people also have their own communities with their own norms of communication. Which are not wrong, simply adapted to different circumstances."
GenderCritical,39ru11,caroline199,4,Mon Jun 15 01:29:07 2015 UTC,"You are over-generalizing in a way that I did not.  I was describing a pathology often found in the MtT, who are a tiny fraction of the population, far smaller than the number of people who are diagnosed with autism, who are socially awkward, or who are isolated.  I even made a point of discussing in my comment just how different these younger Trans men are from the older Trans men, so it was clear that I wasn't even talking about all MtT, just a subset of them.  I gather that you feel you are a socially isolated and awkward person and this has made you respond with defensiveness.   Your reaction is similar to the men who become personally offended by discussion of rape culture among women and insist that qualifiers like ""not all men"" must be added.  Obviously not all men are rapists just as obviously not all Trans are socially isolated autists, and certainly all socially isolated autists are not Trans.   What do you think has caused more of said social awkwardness and isolation in recent years?   This is an excellent question and I wish I had a different answer, one that didn't make me sound like a Luddite, but I blame the internet, particularly in its ability to offer an easier, tidier (though far less concrete and durable)  substitute for the messiness, complexity, and hard work of genuine relationships, and in the tidal wave of free and near-free porn that it has made common and universally available.  The internet has brought us many good things; the free exchange and flow of information has already toppled dictators and changed governments, and I myself believe it is the most significant technological leap forward since movable type.  But it's become clear that online life is also is loosening real-life social bonds and distorting our ability to connect with one another as fellow human beings.     Let me tell you this as a socially awkward person: We do recognize our need for a social group where they can participate. That's far from being ""solipsistic"" or ""living in one's own world""! Socially awkward people also have their own communities with their own norms of communication. Which are not wrong, simply adapted to different circumstances.   The terrible loneliness many people experience as we all increasingly indulge in the empty calories of purely online interaction is one of the worst drawbacks the internet presents;  facebook friends instead of real friends, message boards instead of face-to-face conversations (oh, the irony :) ), porn instead of loving relationships.  The internet was designed to move information, not to create and sustain social bonds, though we use it in that off-label fashion far too often.    In a way it reminds me of Harlow's monkey experiments with the cloth mother and the wire mother, except that in this case the internet is the cloth mother and it can offer nothing of genuine substance when it comes to intimacy with another person, just a simulacrum of interaction and bonding that feels better than nothing.  The problem is that there is a real temptation, especially if one is already shy or has difficulties interacting with other people, to keep clinging to that dry terrycloth breast rather than to try to confront the difficulties inherent to real-life interaction and relationship-building.   That is not a slap at you or at anyone;  we each struggle with our own problems.  The majority of people with isolation issues will eventually work through them just fine.  Some don't.   And in a very small fraction of those,  isolation breeds an anger and sense of entitlement that combines with other elements of a pathology into the toxic brew that creates a MtT.   In other words, I was probably not talking about you."

GenderCritical,39ru11,liatris,10,Mon Jun 15 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I think discussion of autogynephilia can be constructive. We find that a significantly larger number of males transition to females rather than vice versa. Suppose we link this higher number to autogynephilia, and suppose we find that autogynephilia occurs significantly more frequently in men than in women.  And we then attribute this difference to fetishes derived from the social taboo of males wearing clothing traditionally reserved for females while no such taboo (for the most part) now exists for females wearing clothing traditionally reserved for males.   To be clear, historically, it would have been scandalous for women to wear jeans, shorts, or tank tops in public. Whereas today, men are only permitted to wear dresses in public as jokes, performances, or as consequences of losing a bet.  It would then make sense to engage in activism to eliminate the taboo against males wearing female clothing. We should expect that, if it is acceptable for males to wear female clothing, then there will be fewer cases of autogynephilia (and therefore transitions based on autogynephilia) as the secret fetish will no longer be erotic. Men that want to wear female clothing, for whatever reason, will just wear it, and there will be nothing erotic about it. The erotic element only emerges from the thrill of having to do it in secret."

Michael: His advice about girls was, ""Wait until marriage.""  Sophia: Good Lord, one of those. Now, you want some real advice?   Michael: From my second mom, or my used-to-be dad?  Sophia: From former man to current man. Now, when I was your age, my dad told me, ""Find a real insecure girl and practice on her. That way, when you meet a girl you really like, you'll be good at it.""  Michael: You really want to be a lady in a world where men do that?!  Sophia: God help me, I do.    I know that Cox didn't write the scene, but since she's a prominent advocate for the trans movement, it's telling that when she spoke publicly about the scene, she didn't clarify that her character's views are distinct from the views/""party line"" of the trans community--especially since her character basically affirms that she wants a world in which women are used by men and oppressive gender norms are upheld."

Not only was Pennsatucky extremely insecure and vulnerable, she'd also been raised to believe that men needed sex, and it was not her place to resist. It was a lesson delivered with ice cream and a certain degree of compassion; viewers were meant to believe that Pennsatucky's misguided mother was only doing her best.    While I don't know if the show will draw a bright line between Sophia's advice to Michael and the leftover sense of privilege that comes from Sophia being raised male, I did think it was thought-provoking that an idea initially played for laughs was thoroughly excoriated in a later episode. It was also interesting that Sophia's son immediately picked up on the hypocrisy in Sophia's statement - who would choose to be a woman in a world where women are seen as property?"

But this is true also of race and, crucially, gender performance is itself racialized. Which is to say there isn’t just some universal femininity or universal masculinity. Rather, performances of both vary across races and cultures: black masculinity differs from white masculinity, latina femininity differs from Japanese femininity, and so on.  Given this, what exactly does it mean when a male assigned person says that they identify as a woman? Obviously it means they don’t identify with any of the masculinities, but which performance of femininity do they identify with? And, perhaps more importantly for the present discussion, which kind of femininity are they allowed to identify with? Are white transwomen only permitted to perform white femininity, and black transwomen only permitted to perform black femininity? Does that make much sense? Is it possible, for instance, that male-assigned individuals sometimes identify with feminine gender performances, but somehow never identify with the feminine gender performances of racial groups other than their own? Why would that be? Why would someone assigned the socially constructed performance of “white masculinity” only ever identify with other socially constructed gender performances that are also of the white variety?"

The sharing of bathrooms is merely the next step and, officials say, also offers a safe place for those with gender identity issues.  “Initially we were laughed at for this, but now that people are discovering that unisex toilets are just normal bathrooms, we are experiencing rather broad acceptance,” Simon Kowalewski, a member of the Berlin state parliament whose Pirate Party proffered the idea in the first place.  It can, however, still be awkward. The Studio Я theater in Berlin, for instance, converted its male and female bathrooms to unisex toilets about 18 months ago. On the doors are the universal gender signs for men and women but also signs for transgender and intersex.  Blooms sit in the urinals, along with a sign saying “Flowers for a Gender Free World.” Felix Witzlau, a 26-year-old student, exclaimed in wonder as he entered the toilet, where both men and women were coming out of stalls. Looking at the urinals, he said, “Should I water the flowers now?”  But he shyly chose a stall instead. “It did feel a bit awkward hearing female voices outside,” he said after emerging. “But I could get used to it.”   Well, as long as the men are OK with this.

I think that the fact that there are so many unemployed men right now might have something to do with it. Gender roles put a HUGE emphasis on the male breadwinner dynamic so this trend has a lot of men insecure in their identities.  Also, and I'm lifting this from another comment I read although I can't remember where, women/disabled people/minorities are celebrated (rightfully so!) to a huge extent right now for doing things like going into STEM fields.

Very interesting. I've always wondered whether shy and insecure men who don't feel comfortable in male gender roles have been pushed towards transgenderism in recent years, due to culturally prevalent and misogynistic beliefs that associate their qualities with women. I guess it's probably a mix of many things, but it's still important to pick apart the details and understand the effects of sexism in our cultural development."
GenderCritical,39o7g2,repugnent,4,Sat Jun 13 05:06:10 2015 UTC,"What's even more interesting is that recent studies have shown that that ratio is reversing.  The site you linked to cites studies with data no more recent than 2003.  This study from 2015, using data from two gender identity clinics from 2006 to 2013, showed that among adolescents the ratio has shifted and now favors females.  Unfortunately I don't have access to the article but I do have my own ideas.  A girl years ago simply wouldn't have had transitioning as an option.  Now, if she has even the slightest interest in the idea she can easily access videos and narratives from the internet.  And the narrative of ""I was uncomfortable in my own skin, until I claimed my true identity and became the real me"" is enticing to any teenager.    On the other side of the coin, the lesbian identity (and most of these girls are lesbians) is simply less trendy, and what's left of the lesbian community is more trans focused.  Which is to say, instead she'll encounter a community that celebrates trans identity. Baked into the transgender narrative is the idea that this identity is completely innate and to suggest otherwise is bigotry.  Couple that with the prevalence of informed consent clinics, which make testosterone very easy to get, she can transition with very little difficulty and without introspection.  In fact, her ""queer"" friends will cheer her on, celebrating the changes of testosterone and the emergence of the ""real you.""    Of course this is just my observations and my conclusions.  Perhaps I am wrong, but there is no denying that young women are transitioning en masse.  The effects of testosterone are not easily reversible (unlike for mtfs), and if they have regrets in 10, 20 years that could be devastating, both to the individuals and the transgender movement itself."

I've noticed that a lot of young people don't use the term 'lesbian' anymore. There's a huge disconnect with lesbian culture with this population, and the high desirability masculine-presenting female-bodied people may push more and more people to making the choice to fully or partially transition.  I identified as genderqueer for years. There was certainly a huge push to present more masculine. I went to a comprehensive clinic that offered informed consent HRT as well as general medicine and psych referrals. I was there for a psych referral to see a doc for depression and anxiety. I had a doc going over the informed consent paperwork for testosterone with me, 'just in case I wanted to do it.' I had not asked for any help with transition. I did state that my gender was 'genderqueer' and I used my preferred name, but they just assumed that I'd want hormones... when I really was there to get back on my psych meds."

Your social circles have been poisoned, and the primary issue here is to avoid the toxicity while maintaining healthy social interaction.  First off, talk honestly with your sister.  You will need to preface it with the statement that many people you mutually know would be deeply offended by what you have to say because it is contrary to their conception of themselves, but you see she is in need of support herself.    With your sister, and anyone else who you get a whiff of being disturbed by trans rhetoric, focus on some things that really are irrefutable:     she experiences all kinds of problems because her body is female, and that transwomen really can't understand what that's like there really is a biological difference between male and female - it extends to all sexually-reproducing species that have ever existed our culture (most cultures) associates certain good and bad characteristics with certain sexes, but there isn't any scientific or empiric justification for it that unfair association of characteristics with sexes is what feminism works against regardless of what transwomen experience, those raised from birth as female have their futures, opportunities, bodies, and minds constrained in the process of their upbringing, and feminism encourages you to identify and resist those   I wouldn't put anything in terms of heirarchy, systems of oppression, privilege, social constructs, or anything like that.  Keep the focus on how her physical state is used to limit her, identify and mitigate those limitations, and not get into comparing herself to the experiences (""oppressions"" or ""lack of privilege"") of transwomen.  The healthy path out of this for both of you will be slow disentanglement and disengagement.  Keep your outward focus (words and actions) very strongly and clearly on the other social issues you fight for/against.  Direct your reading and inward focus on alternative voices.  This sub and those webpages linked on the side can guide you to authors and bloggers who can help you develop and strengthen your understanding.  Strengthen/Make new ties with people who don't give much energy to transactivism, and even better on with people doing positive work for those in need.  When trans stuff comes up in conversation, don't say anything.  If you are pestered to contribute, or your devotion to other causes is doubted because of your silence, reiterate how you place highest importance on these other issues.  Some will challenge you on that, but really, no one has the right to tell you what your priorities should be. You may have disengage from feminist-oriented activities, except with those you sense are having trouble swallowing the kool-aid.  You don't have to be a voice for anything feminist right now.  Best wishes to you.  Edited:  Attempted fix of bullet list format, or not.  One day I'll figure it out."
GenderCritical,39ktsq,BrackenGold,8,Fri Jun 12 16:18:20 2015 UTC,This is excellent! You should expand this a bit and make it into a post about how to talk about trans. Sort of like political strategists do!

I think I've run across some really excellent blogs in my 'Net wanderings that do talk about how to talk about trans issues in a neutral or ""distanced"" fashion.  I will try to remember where I've seen them and post.  I figure I'm just about the last person to ever find anything on the 'Net, so I don't post the awesome links I find.

GenderCritical,39ktsq,La_Diabla,3,Sat Jun 13 12:08:39 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true. Women are sadly accustomed to being bullied into silence, another difference between actual women and ""transwomen"". And it's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes, people are too afraid to point out the Emperor is naked because no one else will say it and they're afraid of the repercussions. And telling the Emperor he's wrong is unthinkable.   I think, though, as voices grow you'll find more and more people willing to speak up about their concerns."
GenderCritical,39ktsq,caroline199,12,Sat Jun 13 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think you have to give the people around you some hint rather than ""smile and go along"" because as a woman I cannot continually humor right-wing, fear-based thinking or delusions like trans-ideology. It's not in my best interests and I refuse to support a system that tries to silence and marginalize me. When Arizona's SB1070 was the news of the day, I unfriended some people on FaceBook by telling them outright that if they thought that bill was a good idea, they weren't my friend because they see Mexican immigrants and by extension, me, as second-class citizens. (I'm not the daughter, grand-daughter or great grand-daughter of immigrants, my family are US citizens via the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.)   I have long-time friends who are trans-gendered but thankfully they are not too militant and I don't have many issues with them but I'm in my late-50s and the mind-set is a bit different.  *punctuation"
GenderCritical,39ktsq,wanderingwomb,2,Fri Jun 12 13:31:57 2015 UTC,"I'm astonished how many long-term friends I have lost from this, people I served with in the Peace Corps even.   When the Jenner issue broke and discussion started, linking people to the McHugh article with some of my thoughts as an intro to a genuine discussion was a guaranteed way to be instantly unfriended, presumably for thoughtcrime.  J. Michael Bailey was crucified for presenting facts for discussion. Somehow the MtT have become an untouchable sacred cow. La Diabla is right, we have to speak up.  To listen and do nothing would be wrong."
GenderCritical,39ktsq,DoubleXMarksTheSpot,2,Sat Jun 13 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"They have to show what good progressives they are and pat themselves on the back.  Really I feel like the logic goes like this: you have to support gay people, not supporting gay people is being a bigot and a conservative, trans people are under the gay umbrella, they're the next big oppressed group and are like supergays. You have to unthinkingly support them because if you don't it would be just like being anti-gay, even though there are niggling doubts about the veracity of that and clashes with dismantling gender roles in the back of your mind."
GenderCritical,39ktsq,wanderingwomb,7,Sat Jun 13 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"Many males and females i know, especially ones who have always had a hard time fitting in, are now simply transitioning. Trans is becoming a panacea for any sense of cultural isolation or disillusionment.   I went to college in the late '80s/early '90s. What you said here goes to the heart of the matter. I recall being in my early to mid 20s and feeling profoundly unhappy and sometimes depressed and anxious when contemplating my future and place in the world. I did not feel clever or good-looking or popular enough to be anything other than ordinary, and I struggled to make sense of my existence.   In other words, I was a normal young person coming to terms with a world I could see was infinitely more complex than I had previously perceived as a child or a teenager. This whole transgender thing strikes me as part of a larger phenomenon within our culture of pathologizing the human condition. Normal existential angst becomes a potentially dangerous ""dysphoria"" that requires desperate measures, like the mutilation of a healthy body, because suicide.   Why are we so terrified of unhappiness? Bouts of unhappiness lead to self-knowledge and maybe actual wisdom."
GenderCritical,39ktsq,caroline199,4,Sat Jun 13 15:46:37 2015 UTC,"Some of my trans friends are sincerely good people. But I've slowly recognized that ""being"" a woman has become akin to a fashion trend.   People are complex. A good person can still be misled, or do and say terrible things with good intent. Or buy into ultra sexist ideas.   Though I will protest the idea that someone being trans automatically means they're not only a good person, but a fluffy bunny rabbit that can do no wrong. And you see this alot. It's the most dehumanizing positive discrimination but you'll get, as you said, crucified if you question it.  And of course this air of ""can do no wrong"" is likely very attractive to some people who are already attracted to transgenderism.     Trans is becoming a panacea for any sense of cultural isolation or dissillusionment.   Yeah and before that it was asberger's syndrome. And before that it was bipolar. And before that it was bisexuality. The difference is with transgenderism people run the risk of doing permanent damage to themselves.    How do I begin to try and make a sensible argument about the issues with gender if I risk losing trans friends who mean a lot to me personally   It's very, very difficult. Even the most mild, carefully worded statements can unleash a fury of ""terf!"" and ""bigot!"", which is the discourse equivalent of putting one's fingers in one's ears and going ""lalalala!"". Hell the first time I got called a ""TERF"" it was because I stated I am a lesbian  who has no interest in sex with someone with male biology. I didn't even know what it meant, and the accuser wouldn't even tell me. In fact I also discovered /r/gendercritical because they accused me of posting there.   But even if we goof off, mock, and reductio ad absurdum here sometimes, overall we're about forming cohesive arguments for our position. Or at least that's what I'm about, because really that's all you can ever do."

It is going to be very painful living under a decade or two of complete Republican domination - we may even see a pseudo-Nazi takeover. But it will be a huge wakeup call to serious people on the left, who will learn that there are in fact limits to the discourse of progress. Consistency in terms, arguments, and values is important. Failing to recognize and focus on the true enemy, eating ourselves instead, is a mistake. Getting people fired for voicing opinions, and trolling people on social media does not change beliefs in your favor in a sustainable way.  The good news is that after the pain, we will emerge with a new sense of purpose and a strong understanding of our past mistakes. We will never again listen to angry children under direction of pied pipers."

GenderCritical,39kxh2,BetAle,2,Sun Jun 28 07:17:45 2015 UTC,Rage-inducing but very interesting. I've known people who made up stories like 'Tania Head' did and the confrontation part of the documentary was fascinating - when the 911 group members realized everything she told them about her dramatic story was fiction. Why do some people do things like that?
GenderCritical,39kxh2,La_Diabla,3,Sun Jun 28 12:51:28 2015 UTC,"In her case, I read it as a pathological desire for attention (based off her enthusiasm for leading Ground Zero tours) mixed with an intense (but false) sense of connection with that particular event. IIRC, the documentary seemed to imply the sense of connection with 9/11 was rooted in Dolezal-esque identity issues around the issue of American nationalism – i.e. she really wanted not just to be an American, but to have been an American on 9/11.   Why she had to have ownership of that trauma, rather than just pathos as an observer, goes back to the same question of why Dolezal had to be black rather than just supporting black causes. I think it comes down to the fact that developing an identity is difficult – it takes work, and it's not always a fun process. It's easier to do what's called identity foreclosure – attach yourself to one well-defined identity and end the process there. When people like Dolezal, Esteve, etc. foreclose on identities they have no actual claim to is where it gets pathological. I actually think that's something there needs to be more research into – it's related to Munchausen's, a well-documented illness, and could explain these types of people and, IMO, could rip a gaping hole in the credibility of trans identity politics. Of course, the PC police would never allow the studies to be publicized without serious repercussions.  Anyway, sorry for the essay, I just find this stuff fascinating."

To create a queen bee, the selected queen larvae (5-6) are fed a special rich food called royal jelly which makes them grow much larger than the worker females (and also makes her sexually viable). Bees do reproduce sexually, though since they operate as a singular organism rather than individuals with nuclear families, they do not need all the bees to be reproducing at the same time to maintain their population. Reproduction is costly, so it makes sense for a social colony-type insect to relegate reproduction to a single (and large and sturdy) individual that lives a lot longer than the other individuals in the colony. It frees up the other bees to use all their energy towards hoarding calories for the winter. Queen bees live about 4-5 years whereas regular worker females only live about a month or so.   According to trans logic, non reproductive females literally make an living thing no longer a female.  I can't wait for them to go into /r/childfree and tell all the men and women there that they're no longer male or female because they don't reproduce.  And WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE ""BIOLOGICAL DETERMINISTS""?  We are also humans. Not bees.

In the 19th century, the West fought hard for the right of women to have their own restrooms, and other countries are still fighting for this right today. In Delhi, for example, women are frequently kidnapped from mixed-gender bathrooms and raped.   Men in dresses are still men. The problem isn't that they're in dresses -- the problem is that they're men."

This is a place where honor killings are still popular.  many futuristic sci-fi shows and movies depict a more genderless society and part of that entails mixed changing areas being the norm. I have a hard time with the idea of perpetuating sex based segregation. I understand that our current culture heavily drives this segregation but in the spirit of moving forward are we going to keep this going? for the foreseeable future, men (in general) will always be bigger and stronger than women (in general). it seems like the drive to keep the sexes apart is helping to reinforce the idea that the genders are supposed to be apart and different."
GenderCritical,39if3r,transbasenji,11,Fri Jun 12 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"But you're doing the thing we hate which is saying our anatomy is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is that women are capable of being impregnated. We go through great lengths not to be but the reason segregation based on sex matters is that it's one of the ways we protect ourselves in our most vulnerable moments (places of public nudity as well as places of confinement like jails and hospitals).   It seems as though not having protections like this actually keeps women from going out in public. Why are delusional males' feelings more important than real women's safety?   I support having male and female bathrooms and a few unisex stalls. Or, if you must desegregate bathrooms, let women have our own bathroom and make men's bathrooms unisex. LEAVE OUR BATHROOMS ALONE. We fought for them. Many women are still fighting for them."

GenderCritical,39if3r,BeeeboBrinker,5,Fri Jun 12 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"Kind of but it's more like in the sense of not grooming girls or boys to patriarchal expectations. The WHO's definition of gender:   Gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men.   It's eliminating this kind of conditioning, but there's nothing that changes the fact that women are the ones who are impregnable, at least for now. Maybe in the future we'll be gestating babies in bionic wombs but this is the situation we still find ourselves in today.   Impregnability is an inherent vulnerability females have that non-females don't. Ignoring the reality of that vulnerability doesn't make the playing field ""equal"" for us.   It does the opposite because we're not finding solutions to mitigate that vulnerability (ie segregation based on sex in places of public vulnerability, like places of public nudity and places of confinement, also public shelters.) That's why abortion is critical to women's liberation from ""gender"" and we don't want to change the language around it."
GenderCritical,39if3r,arbormama,10,Fri Jun 12 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"I would think the culture change needs to come first.  Years ago I attended a gay and lesbian youth center that used unisex restrooms, and it felt very safe to me. The culture there was not only one of zero tolerance for harassment, but also one of close community where everyone was looking out for everyone else.  And, to be honest, the fact that straight males were vastly out numbered was a key element to that culture and to the feeling of safety.  That's not how most of the world works. Straight men not only aren't outnumbered, they command ludicrously disproportionate amounts of power and respect.

But even in the first level of access (malls, airports, etc), unisex restrooms have some advantages:  You know what you're getting into when you go in there, so there are no surprises, a multistalled unisex bathroom solves the age-old problem of long lines to the women's restroom, while there are no lines to the men's room next door, it provides a place for parents out with young children of the other sex to use the same room together, and, of course, it is a reasonable solution for trans people who ""just want to pee"", while also not violating the rights of regular people who want sex-segregated spaces.  I think that unisex restrooms should not, in most cases, totally replace sex-segregated rooms (except for certain typs of workplaces), but be a third choice.  There are already those calling for this third choice, calling them ""family bathrooms"", specifically aimed at the parent out with other sex children dilemma.

Women cannot rely on men's violence against other men either, it's just as or more likely to be directed at us. This relies on the idea that this is happening in public and that bad behaviour will be seen and policed. This may not happen to be the case, also you can't be sure that a group of men wouldn't team up as a group to harass and predate on women.   I'd only look at unisex if they are single room, not stalls where men can peep and pry under or over and invade women's privacy, especially as they have additional needs managing menstruation. The solution is not to let everyone and anyone in, the solution is the bathrooms and changing areas remain single sex and provide an alternative room for those with other needs. Mostly this is sorted as there are disabled/family rooms that can be used."

I don't view Jenner as the ultimate representative of the population they claim to be; I have friends who are actually struggling with defining gender, and what it means to them, and what it means to be a woman, without any of the resources and publicity that Jenner has.  I'm supposed to care about someone who can do whatever they want, and has no limitations, and also gets paid to be in the spotlight? It feels ridiculous to me, I guess.   I get the impression that big Jenner proponants feel that this is the ""end all, this is how you should be as a woman/transwoman! We must all be extra sensitive due to their courage!""  But I just can't get behind it. I'm uncomfortable with the implications (especially with physical body ideals) and lack of recognition of privilege that their position puts them in.  I'm conflicted, because her experiences throughout life don't feel to me to be representative of womanhood, and then I am afraid that I am discounting another human's perspective just due to their status.  And this makes me wonder if I am not an ally, or not supportive, or not being realistic towards the idea that celebrity-stardom can bring light to issues that might not otherwise get them. But something about this makes me feel...sour. And it feels like a slap in the face to see this being pushed as ""a true woman"", etc.  Almost like if I myself am not working to be the type of woman that jenner is, then I am failing my own womanhood and so are those I know who don't fit that niche or strive to be it. perhaps this is just the layman's response based on what I've heard people around me saying (I'm on a college campus so I could be totally off base here).

As a woman, she's fashioned herself into a very particular archetype - a moneyed Beverly Hills matron who uses plastic surgery as a stand-in for lost youth. Caitlyn not particularly relatable, especially when many trans people struggle with finances, finding work, and their day-to-day safety. She'll never experience any of those things.   It's kind of hard to continually applaud a person whose major obstacle was accepting herself, and who had all the money and family support needed to complete her own transition. It's great that Caitlyn was trying to find happiness for herself. She may even serve as an encouraging role model for people who dealing with their own gender issues. At least she exists. At least she's gotten a lot of positive attention. Maybe any positive representation is important; I don't know.  But it is like the Emperor's New Clothes, because Caitlyn is a rich person who faces very few obstacles to pursuing her own happiness. And the world is being asked to applaud this as if it's a brave decision. I know people who've transitioned; they've done it while holding down jobs and functioning in society. To me, this seems more admirable, not to mention realistic. They didn't have the option of hiding away until ready to reveal their ""new look."" Because the transition wasn't about a new look. For Caitlyn, it kind of is. Her story is about a physical transformation, not much different than a celebrity who loses weight or cuts their hair off. We are basically being asked to applaud a rich person's makeover.  If Jenner is at a point in her transition where she can't handle criticism, the onus is on her to hire people to screen her emails, delete mean comments, and protect her from anything that might damage her fragile sense of identity. Jenner can create her own bubble. It's not the public's responsibility to maintain it for her, especially if Caitlyn's idea of ""damaging"" encompasses any discussion of the ways in which her situation is different from the norm.   I feel badly for her kids, too, especially the teenagers. It's got to be jarring, to say the least, when a parent makes a gender transition. It would be totally normal to have mixed feelings about it, no matter how much you love your parent. But there's a tremendous amount of pressure on Jenner's kids to be supportive and encouraging in the public eye, no matter what they might feel privately. That's another thing no one really talks about. Is there any reason those girls should have to address this at all, let alone put on happy faces about it? Even the right decision comes with a certain amount of fallout. The news coverage of Caitlyn doesn't really acknowledge that."

Some apply different standards to immigrant communities, as if harming a daughter or sister can ever be condoned as part of a cultural tradition.   I mentioned cultural relativism in my first comment. Do you think I'm brushing off misogyny in Islam just because I'm not letting Christianity off the hook? Misogyny present in Islam is not excusable but neither is Christian misogyny.  I'm well aware honor killings and FGM is occurring in the U.S. It's not like I don't think Islamic values are an issue. But so are Christian values. It's just strange that you expect Western/white feminists to focus so much on a minority religion within the U.S. Honor killings and FGM need addressing, and so does the wage gap, DV, and abortion rights."

GenderCritical,39ec4u,nouveau-poor,6,Thu Jun 11 15:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's important to reach the masses of people with this message. The ""messenger"" is very important. This guy has ""status"" among scientists and in the USA social hierarchies, and he can easily get his message out to thousands of mainstream people more quickly than we can do with all of our blogs put together. Today several people found my blog through googling the title of that article. McHugh didn't say anything overtly bad about ""the gays"" or anything particularly offensive. It wasn't bad, coming from an 84 year old white man. At least he cares enough to speak against transgenderism. Lots of mainstream (as well as non-mainstream) people are going along with transgenderism, even if they hate everything about it, because they think it's a done deal and ""perhaps there really is such a thing as gender identity, what the heck do I know."" We need huge social resistance to arise. Few things are erasing women faster than male trannies being accepted as ""women"" (sic) and the huge social engineering program/manufactured ""consent"" about this that's in progress in rich countries worldwide.   I would be happy if e.g. Fox News or the Catholic Church decided to crusade against transgenderism. I don't think they will, but as long as they told the truth (lol right) about it I would be glad. They have a huge platform. Like it or not, gender-critical folks have interests in common with the religious right on a few topics, though our rationale may be very different."
GenderCritical,39ec4u,arbormama,4,Fri Jun 12 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"Here's something else you should know about McHugh: back in the 70s he shut down the ""gender reassignments"" that were typically done on infants with ambiguous genitalia shortly after birth.  It was standard practice everywhere (not just at Johns Hopkins) to give a boy with a malformed penis a brand new vagina and raise him as a girl, but McHugh was skeptical.  Did it actually help the patients long term?  He ordered a follow-up study and ended up shutting it down (at  least at Hopkins, though other hospitals followed suit).  So, yes, he's a conservative Catholic and that means that most of the people here would not agree with him about a lot of things.  But  there's common ground, too."
GenderCritical,39ec4u,caroline199,2,Fri Jun 12 13:36:25 2015 UTC,"I have a great many issues with McHugh's politics, but I still link people to his article for just that reason.  Some people will only listen to an authority, a man, or a man with authority.  McHugh has a great deal of perceived authority and credibility because of his work with sex reassignment.  The article is good because he explains in it at length why Johns Hopkins no longer does SRS, and he pulls no punches when he does it.  ""At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. ""Sex change"" is biologically impossible. People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.""  That is some hard truth-telling and people need to hear it."

I know from experience that this rhetoric can be used as weapon to harass/guilt/hurt others under the pretense of non-violence.   It aims at quieting women's mental issues (be it depression, guilt, anger, sadness, feeling of emptiness) to make them happy in their relationship. If that relationship is violent or unjust, it can be used to force the woman to cope with it as if it was fair, since all the proper are being used.   In that context, since ""violence"" is a personal feeling regarding a situation* and is bad, women must aim to avoid producing ""violence"" at all cost: whenever someone claims violence happens, they have to back off. Lying is unthinkable."

As a teenager, I was very libertarian/choosey-choice, except I thought that trans was an unfortunate mental illness.  I became anti prostitution after I actually met a few ""sex workers"" and saw how unfair the industry was. This made me go from libertarian on the political spectrum to pretty far left/anticapitalist because I saw prostitution as the ultimate capitalism.   Then, by hanging out with lefties, I got brainwashed into being sex positive and pro-BDSM/pro-trans.  My peak trans happened when I started reading 2X and actuallesbians and seeing alleged women post experiences that I just couldn't relate to (never experiencing sexism in the IT field, degrading and dangerous sexual desires, frightening amounts of jealousy toward other women's looks, etc.) and I dug through their post histories -- all trans.  By reading about the trans issue, I've changed my mind about a lot of things relating to sex. I feel like my views are consistent in a way that they never were before, which is why my beliefs never quite ""settled"" in the past."

But generally these women retain the same basic political analysis, they just move away from the very white/het/etc women who often dominate radfem groups.  I don't think I've encountered anyone who, having understood a radical perspective on gender and patriarchy, returns to the whole genderist/sex poz point of view."
GenderCritical,39dx5o,majorlydrunk,6,Thu Jun 11 12:21:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think I went full circle back to libfem, but I stopped calling myself radfem after Leelah Alcorn's suicide. Some of my fellow radical feminists' reactions to were it were disgraceful and although I saw many women stand up to them, it left a bad taste in my mouth. To me, it really seemed that it was becoming about upholding a political ideology over compassion for other humans (which is why I loved radical feminism in the first place, the compassion it holds for the women who need it the most).   I also met more trans people in real life and realized that not all trans people were the ones I'd heard about online. I disagree with a big chunk of their ideology and I understand the implications it has but most of them aren't attacking anyone or trying to push their beliefs on me. I learned I can gently disagree with them and have a respectful conversation we can both benefit and learn from. I'm also very sensitive to the plight of gender non-conforming people, whether they identify as trans or not, and I understand why they've developed the beliefs and militancy they have.  I have more developed beliefs about the sex industry, spurred on by the sporadic cam work I got into on account of my being unemployed for several months. I'm still against it, simply because we're so far removed from a culture that isn't weighed down by economic and sexual equality, but I've learned not to hate the ""privileged"" women who pursue it. Still against BDSM practices too, but I've also come to consider factors about it that run deeper than what radical feminism covers.  I feel that what we call the sex positive movement is a perversion of the sex positive movement I learned about as a teenager. I came from a conservative family and the education I got from sex positive websites geared towards young women was priceless. I spent a good deal of my adolescence terrified of sexual acts. Of course though, I do believe their needs to be a heavy dose of education on the subject of consent with all lessons, and that we need more education for young men. To me, sex positivity was always about learning about your anatomy, maintaining your health and autonomy, finding comfort in your sexuality, knowing that sex doesn't make you an evil person, knowing your boundaries and being able to communicate them to a partner, etc. I just hope we aren't throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

If you don't, you can insist that ""female"" is just something men can be sometimes and not be ""problematic.""   But if you do believe women are an oppressed class that deserves safe spaces from our oppressors (males), then we should be allowed to determine the boundaries of such spaces. But for some reason, women are the only* oppressed class whose boundaries are based solely on the discretion of their oppressors (males).  And I say this as a (non practicing) muslim immigrant (refugee), so this isn't just a ""spoiled white woman's opinion,"" as these people would have everyone believe. Even if white american supremacy wasn't an issue in my life, I still wouldn't want to deal with this shit.   Women don't have to justify feeling this way about males barging in on us and making demands without giving us any room for negotiation. They should have to justify to us why their needs are always more important than ours in every single context related to females and our oppression. What I'm getting from them isn't convincing me.  *edit: this is kind of not true actually as we saw with the trans-abled person. But people aren't demanding that fakers be included on all levels in anything for and/or by real disabled people. Also there's cultural appropriation but at least people aren't seriously being allowed to claim to be exactly the same as natives of the cultures they appropriate. At least not explicitly. Instead they find people from other cultures who share their opinions and hold them up as the voice of their respective cultures without even a hint of irony."

I was told I supported rape. I was shouted at. I wasn't allowed to have an opinion about my own life and sexual history because it didn't fit in with their American-centric worldview.  I also once got attacked for saying I didn't agree with what someone was saying about autistic people while pretending to ""fight for"" and support autistic people. I am autistic, but my views mean nothing, I have to conform to theirs.  I believe there was a survey done of the demographics of the SRS are that they're mostly men anyway. So it's a bunch of middle class, white, mostly American men like the rest of reddit lecturing me about my life and shouting at me, only it's okay because they have a ""cause"".  I am female, SRS absolutely does not feel like any sort of ""safe place"" for me.  If anyone knows somewhere like SRS, on or off reddit, where they actually allow the people they claim to speak for have an opinion about their lives then I'd love to hear about it because I'm getting really sick of people lecturing me about my own experiences then claiming I'm a ""bigot"" if I don't agree with whatever they choose I should believe about myself."

Most people haven't heard yet about ""female penises,"" or that trans ideology holds there isn't really a sex binary, or that women have been commanded to refer to themselves as ""uterus owners"" (because the word ""woman"" has been deemed to have nothing to do with biology or phenotypes, except of course when they want their own vagina and breasts installed). Transwhacktivist claims cannot survive the light of day, and they're about to be examined by a whole lot of people who aren't terrified of being called TERFs (and when they ARE called that, it will just let them know that these guys are rageful nutcases).

GenderCritical,398aq7,aztraelle,3,Wed Jun 10 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think transactivism will crumble once early transitioners coerced by clueless or publicity-seeking parents and the medical industry to sterility and lifelong dependence on artificial hormones start to criticize their treatment, when detransitioners starts to speak up, and when transactivist leaders (e.g: Parker Molloy) eventually gets outed as the bigots and abusers they often are .  Thought experiments about trans-racial or trans-disabled are useful to show the hypocrisy and problem with the idea about woman as identity, but dishonest framing of these concepts as something legitimate to criticize transactivists is to implicitly agree with their methods. And I don't think that is a good idea. Demanding unquestioning exclusion, shaming and no-platforming of anything by framing them as something-phobes (e.g. transphobe) without adressing the actual ideas is an ultimately self-defeating and thought-eliminating way to do activism, even if it is effective short term, and I think a lot of people are here due to these exact methods (i.e ""peak trans""). Once the media darling status and novelty of transactivists starts to disappear, then the ugliness of trans activism will start to bubble up to the surface. Don't be one of the people who co-opted their indefensible methods once this happens."

The more I think about this the more it astounds me. Here you have the first-ever case of a mainstream trans filmmaker working with a huge budget, a globe-spanning story, and an international cast. They could have had the trans character be anyone facing any challenges. You could have someone in an abusive relationship or dating a man with a creepy fetish who thinks of them as a 'tranny' and not a woman and won't be soon in public with them. You could have someone from Iran who underwent a forced sex change. You could have a poor prostitute who's not comic relief or a stereotype but someone who's at very real risk of facing sexual assault or murder because of who they are. Hell, you could have a blue collar transman who's either harassed because they can't pass as a 'real man' or who does have to guard their secret, because the men they work with are dangerous, or a white-collar non-passing unattractive transwoman who gets mocked by men for wearing skirts to work, or maybe fired.  You could, in short, have someone who is facing real danger and harassment in their life... but they chose not to have that character, because the Wachowskis know that the only real danger most transwomen face comes from men. Instead, they went with a passing well-off white political blogger/IT specialist/hacker, whose greatest realistic challenge, like all well-off white transwomen, is having their feelings hurt by women, specifically feminists and mommy (though I still can't imag). It really drives home the whole 'women are afraid of men killing them, men are afraid of women laughing at them' thing.   And the lobotomy thing is beyond insane."

This was before I'd ever heard of autogynephilia. My concept of transwoman was decades old.

I thought psychiatrists, gender therapists, and the surgeons who perform SRS were still evaluating these men to make sure they were sane. I didn't know they were letting psychos like Donna Perry slip through the gates. And I thought Larry was some kind of she-ro.   I bopped around the BDSM scene for a few years as a domme and I knew quite a few guys who were into forced feminization. I used to think their dommes were complete sociopaths for actually leading these poor kinky men into permanent body modifications. I had no idea these guys were actually full on transitioning and claiming to have always been real females deep inside!!! These men think being forced to play the role of 'woman' is some great humiliation and it's all soooo erotic and sexxxy ;3 ;3 ;3  I'll never call such a man a woman.   Really the nerve of these men.

Hill was diagnosed with the tumor as a high school senior in 2013 but nonetheless enrolled at Mount St. Joseph, a Division III school in Cincinnati where she intended to play basketball.  The NCAA allowed the school to move up its opening game by two weeks so Hill could play. Her health was deteriorating at the time. She scored just 17 seconds into the game.  ""It's a dream come true,"" Hill said that night. ""To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd -- I just love it so much. I love basketball.""

GenderCritical,38mm27,breads,2,Sun Jun 7 02:18:02 2015 UTC,"That is a real issue, with real implications for education, and for academic freedom. But pinning the blame on students' embrace of identity politics is a mistake. If adjuncts and junior faculty members feel insecure enough to censor their teaching or work, then that's a problem in their relationship with their universities, not in their relationships with their students.   Except that the relationship with the universities is controlled by the students (and their rich parents, and massive social media shitstorms, etc). The faculty being treated like replaceable cogs in a machine is caused by the offended parties making a huge deal out of it, by the massive number of people who don't bother to use their brain before joining the hatewagon, and it being cheaper and easier (thanks to Capitalism) to hire someone else instead of telling the complainer that they're being ridiculous.   and if faculty are this nervous, that will influence their teaching. Indeed, the article notes that the only actual complaint the professor ever received was from a conservative student angry at his ""communistical"" tendencies because he refused to blame poor black homeowners for the 2008 financial crisis.   That was the only complaint because the teachers purposefully switched to a ""safer"" teaching approach as they saw signs of where things appeared to be going. Would they have gotten complaints if they didn't? Possibly. But they are self-censoring to avoid the complaints, so the expected result is no complaints. A result of ""no complaints"" is not contrary to the original point.   The problem isn't the substance of student complaints — the problem is that university lecturers are so terrified of the effect student complaints could have. That's a problem to be solved by universities having faculty members' backs, not by somehow silencing the debate over identity politics.   (Emphasis mine.)  Except the article does not say that the debate should be ""silenced"" at all. Here's a quote:   we need to adjust our discourse.  Ideally, we can have a conversation that is conscious of the role of identity issues and confident of the ideas that emanate from the people who embody those identities. It would call out and criticize unfair, arbitrary, or otherwise stifling discursive boundaries, but avoid falling into pettiness or nihilism. It wouldn't be moderate, necessarily, but it would be deliberate. It would require effort.   The original author is fine with discussion. The problem is that, far too often, disagreement gets met with a massive hatestorm, no matter how well reasoned the disagreement is. For example, look at how much hate gets lobbed at Cathy Brennan whenever she says, well, anything at all really. The vast majority of her stuff is actually quite decently written, but the responses all tend to consist of ""OMG SHE'S HORRIBLE AND IS LITERALLY HITLER!!"".   if you're going to dismiss campus identity politics as a debate ""in which the feelings of individuals are the primary or even exclusive means through which social issues are understood and discussed,"" ... then you need to come up with something beyond your own feelings to explain why that's a problem.   what. ""Prove that focusing on feelings to the detriment of facts is wrong, by using facts."" The article writer just admitted that facts are what matter right there. If feelings were an acceptable means of understanding, then one wouldn't need facts to dispute them."

I'm iffy on some of her word choices, but she definitely makes the most succinct comparison to race I've seen, and her race is notable in her perspective on that.   Around the age of thirteen, I realized that the world was telling me that light skin and “good hair” were better, skinny was better, and whiteness was better. In fleeting moments, I wished I could be white. I begged my mom to straighten my hair, and she did. I went through sometimes unreasonable means to lose weight, and I tried to keep my somewhat light skin out of the sun.  If I had gone to my parents begging them to be white, I think they might have laughed, cried, comforted me, and worried what they did wrong as parents. But what if I had told them not only that I wanted to be white but that I actually was white? What if I had declared that the race of my body simply didn’t match that of my mind? I think they would’ve been deeply troubled.  The eyes and the skin color were never the problem: racism and abuse were. We would only be putting a Band-Aid on the real issue. The many men and women who “passed” as white during America’s shameful Jim Crow era may have gained the social privileges bestowed by being white, but they also lost their heritage, their family ties, and their integrity, thanks to the lie they were forced to tell every single day.  But what if, instead of wanting to be white, I wanted to be a man? What if, instead of crying to my parents that I was really a white person, I told them that I was really a man and that I desperately wanted to change my body to match my mind? If, in this scenario, you think that my parents should applaud my courage, accept my new gender identity, and run to the nearest surgeon, please ask yourself: “Why?”   And also succinctly states a question that's often brought up here:   By saying that people can be born in a body of the wrong gender, transgender activists are saying there is a set of feelings that are only allocated to women and another set for men. Therefore, they believe, those who feel things that do not conform to their sex’s acceptable set of feelings must outwardly change their gender to match their mind.  Why are we colluding with narrow ideas of femininity or masculinity? What does it mean to “feel” like a woman? Should we question that idea as much as we have questioned ideas of a “woman’s place” or a “man’s role”? When did we come to accept the idea of “gendered thoughts” or “gendered feelings”?"

That the author makes this claim while stating ""we know what being a woman is like"" is particularly laughable.

I thank him for setting me straight on this - he truly understands what it is to be a woman.   Ultimately, I feel like the logic in this piece is incredibly reductive - if a person is willing to conform to the existing standards of what constitutes ""male"" and ""female"", they are less likely to question the results of these arbitrary positions. It's a way of shutting down people who have problems with existing norms, and openly question them. ""Get to the kitchen and make me a fucking sandwich,"" but even more limiting and misogynistic.    If Caitlyn Jenner is happy with her identity and gender expression, good for her. But I don't like the idea of using her individual situation as some kind of totem.

He was a man then and he's a man now, down to his chromosomes, regardless of the cosmetic changes to his appearance.  I don't think mental illness is a valid criteria to strip anyone of their medals.  The Olympics has sex-tested athletes in the past and their criteria has absolutely zippo to do with ""feelings"" and everything to do with DNA and chromosomes.  There have been some countries in years past that have attempted to enter disguised males in women's events, but the athletes didn't consider themselves transgender; the only purpose was to cheat.  Most often, such tested athletes turn out to have chromosomal anomalies; they have an intersex condition, such as Caster Semanya a few years ago.  Another intersex athlete was Stella Walsh, who was not discovered to be intersex until after her death.  Both women had been raised as girls from birth and didn't know they were intersex.  I wouldn't touch the petition with a ten foot pole because it only reinforces the idea that it's possible to change one's sex and that what determines one's sex in how they ""feel"".  So, no, let Jenner keep his medals.  He earned them."

Why do we need to allow men to buy women (because most prostitutes are female and those who are male serve homosexual buyers). How do you explain this fact and what does it tell you? Apparently, for you, this does not constitute a forced relation. And there it is already, the first blind spot on your lens.   Yeah, I love seeing them try and answer this one. ""Something something disabled people"" is the one I usually get.   Because, dear Stephanie, if you took a look around the punters’ forums, you would see that punters are misogynists   There's a tumblr out there that takes the words of punters and puts it against a mask. Invisible men I think? That shit is fucking eye opening and creepy.   You also forget the use of drugs and alcohol among prostitutes.   In Canberra, prostitution is legal and regulated. I didn't know a single woman who wasn't addicted to something. It started as a way to make money, to get off Centrelink and provide for themselves (and often young children). Then just to get through the day, they had to take drugs. To even stomach the work they were doing, they had to have something to take ""the edge off"". Then they'd be addicted and they'd be going to work just to pay off the drugs they needed to get through work.  Can you imagine any other ""job"" where you have to be fucked up just to cope? I know when I worked at a bar we'd take MDMA to stay awake through till 5am but you could do the job without it. You didn't have to do it every shift."

GenderCritical,38fx86,mrsgetlost,19,Wed Jun 3 23:16:44 2015 UTC,"Simply put, many MTFs are horribly sexist, and still retain and relish their male privilege.    Case in point, when was the last time you heard of a FTM complain about the ""cotton ceiling"" where they considered it bigotry if gay men don't want to fuck them? When was the last time you heard a FTM lecture other men on what a ""real man"" should look like? When was the last time you heard a FTM even mentioned in mainstream media? Really, they're completely non-existent in popular culture.   Compare that to transwomen. MTFs invented the rapey term the ""cotton ceiling"" because they felt entitled to fuck any woman they wanted with impunity. They anoint themselves the aribiters of feminine beauty standards, because silicone injected lips and artificial breasts are better than the real thing. They see women's safe spaces as ripe territory to claim as their own; like conquistadors, they colonize these spaces and stamp out dissent. They feel free to use sexist language because ""listen up bitch, I'm a real woman too.""    The trans issue obscure things. The real battle has always been men subjegating women, whether it is through overt violence, economic subordination, or culturally by defining womanhood on the behalf of women. Just because a man dons a dress and wears mascara, doesn't mean he's any less of a patriarch who desires women to completely submit to him. It's really telling that the media is head-over-heels in love with MTFs, but does not even acknowledge the existence of FTMs. Just as always, it's always men that get to define reality, whether that's masculinity, femininity, gayness, or the trans experience."

I saw a great rebuttal of this on tumblr. Of course men like Jenner are better at being hawwwt and sexxay than women, they're the ones that designed femininity that way. They know what it's supposed to be like because they created it.  I'd consider it a win if that kind of behaviour/clothing is associated with men like Jenner and not actual females.  Instead of it being ""all these clothing choices make Bruce Jenner a woman"" it would be ""Bruce Jenner chooses to wear these clothes"".  I can actually kinda see a backlash coming from this.   If you've got men trying to be titillating wearing this stuff, do you think it's more likely that straight men are going to go ""Ahh, that's sexy"" or do you think they'll start associating that behaviour with other males and finding it unattractive?  I've seen men go from liking fake nails on women, to stop liking them because they now associate them with ""plastic"" or fake ""airhead"" women. Same with breast implants.   Actually, racism even plays a part in some of these ""switches"" from what is attractive to what isn't. Often if something is too ""urban"" it becomes unattractive in white women to white males. If this behaviour becomes more associated with transgender people than women, what do you think the outcome will be?  I guess we wait and see."

GenderCritical,38fx86,himself809,-1,Thu Jun 4 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"I dunno who’s doing the “calling” in your examples. The trans community? Society at large? Because I’m pretty sure neither group determines a person’s trans-ness by asking, “are they a successful male model who cross dresses?”  Anyway, since you haven’t stated it directly yet I guess your point is that trans women don’t exist as “women”, but only as men who cross dress. And that these men who cross dress are called trans when they do something good and cross dressers when they do something bad.  I’m still not sure how that addresses my question. Do you think there are no other differences between trans women and men who cross dress?  Also, how do trans men fit into your understanding of things?"
GenderCritical,38fx86,MundiMori,3,Fri Jun 5 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"The trans community, the media. And it's not a question of ""is this person a successful model,"" it's ""is this person damaging to the trans cause?""  So when a man who's dressed in women's clothing commits a crime in a women's space, they're spoken about as crossdressers. People say that no trans woman would use the women's restroom for reasons other than to innocently pee, so when someone does do something wrong, they insist they weren't trans so they can keep claiming allowing trans women in women's rooms is harmless.  And I don't particularly care about trans men. They're women. If they want to use the men's room, let the men complain, that has no impact on me."

GenderCritical,38fx86,himself809,-4,Thu Jun 4 09:54:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, so what exactly did Bruce Jenner change?   Well, she changed in at least the ways you pointed out. These are probably changes that make her feel more comfortable with her gender presentation.    What is a woman then? How do we define a woman?   I don’t know how to define a woman. But since gender is malleable, and since there’s more than one way to be any particular gender, I think I should accept the judgment of Jenner and lots of trans people that they are and wanna present as a gender that might be different from the one they currently present as.   How is that different from a cross dresser?   As I understand it, cross dressing doesn’t necessarily refer to people who feel their assigned gender/sex mismatches with their felt gender.   I asked my question because I was confused how the person I responded to understood the relationship between cross dressing and being trans (in the sense of feeling uncomfortable with your assigned gender/sex and preferring, if possible, to present as another gender). It’s wrong to completely conflate the two. There are people who cross dress who aren’t trans in that sense, and there are people who are trans in that sense who aren’t cross dressers. So a trans woman isn't ""just"" a cross dresser with gender identity issues, which seems to be what the person I replied to was implying."

For that matter, what is gender?  I'm a woman because I was born with a vagina and two X chromosomes, because I've been treated as a woman my entire life. I didn't choose to be a woman. I am one.  Bruce was never treated as a woman. He never was called bossy as a little girl. He was raised with all the privileges of a man. If he wants to dress up in skirts and wear his hair long and feel pretty, fine. But that doesn't make him a woman. Girls grow up to be women. Boys don't."
GenderCritical,38fx86,himself809,0,Thu Jun 4 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"The way I’ve understood it, gender expression is how people express themselves in relation to gender categories.

As for gender, I don’t really know. Maybe something like “social interpretations of biological sex, including ‘man’ and ‘woman’”? But I dunno. What’s your definition of gender?   I’m a woman because I was born with a vagina and two X chromosomes, because I’ve been treated as a woman my entire life. I didn’t choose to be a woman. I am one.   Do you think trans women choose to be trans women? Is a person born with a vagina and XX chromosomes a woman just by virtue of those facts?   It sounds like you think that’s the case (and definitely tell me if it’s not!), but if that’s so then I’m not sure what your point is in talking about how Jenner has never experienced misogyny or oppression or any of the other ways that women are disprivileged. Is a woman a woman by virtue of her biology, or by virtue of the way she interacts with and is treated by her society? In either case, what’s the problem with someone who has been gendered one way knowing they would be more comfortable if they were gendered in some other way?"

It is an oasis of sanity to come to after I've had all the trans gaslighting BS I can stand in the mainstream media.  First off, though, the entire concept of having a ""gender identity"" is built on junk science.  People don't need to ""identify"" with being female or male, any more than we need to identify with being human.  Both are biological facts that we can simply take for granted and that nothing we do, think, feel, say, wear, or express will change that fact.  As you said, your XX chromosomes make you a woman, not the stereotypes of the gender system. It's all about the biological facts, not the ""feelings"".  What they call ""gender"", ""gender identity"", and ""gender expression"" is what society labels as masculine and feminine, not male and female.  And masculine and feminine are just the labels society slaps on human personality traits and personal style.

It's of the ""trans women are women"" ilk.  Sorry,  Jenner has the right to live life as he sees fit in his Orwellian fantasy world without being bullied, but that's as far as it goes.  He can re-write reality for himself and pretend he's a woman and really believe that, but  I don't have to live in his fantasy world, too, and pretend he's really a woman.  Two plus two still equals four in my world.    It's exactly like the freedom of religion - people are free to believe in and practice whatever religion they like for themselves, but they have no right to force me to believe in their religion  or observe their religious practicies."
GenderCritical,38ajgt,Eclectic58,15,Wed Jun 3 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"Note: He doesn't really believe it. No transsexual really believes it. They simply can't. Because they aren't really the other sex. Their disappointment, they can't handle internally, so they have to project it onto others. ""If only other people weren't so judgmental, if only they really saw me as a woman, then I could really feel like a woman.""  This is the critical difference. A real woman, when mistaken for a man by the other, doesn't have any internal conflict over the matter. But when a transsexual's fantasy is disrupted by being recognized by the other as their real sex, the internal conflict is explosive and must be externalized."

My Facebook page and Twitter feed the last few days has been plastered with Caitlyn Jenner memes with captions that say ""shut bitch, this is how a REAL woman looks"" or comments calling his ex-wife an ""ugly bitch"" just because she hasn't spent $100k on cosmetic surgeries. On RuPaul's Drag Race, men cartoonishly masquerading as women, routinely mock real, biological women who don't share their pornified femininity.   Transwomen are hailed by the media as not only ""real woman,"" but even better than the real thing, because they often reaffirm gendered stereotypes about men and women. And because their cause fits comfortably under the LGBT umbrella, sexism can once again be considered a progressive cause.   Time magazine recently had an entire issue devoted to the ""Transgender Tipping Point."" Well, it's here, and it's ugly, hateful to actual women, and playfully indulges in misogyny."

I can't help by remember all the snark at Madonna who had the temerity to, at the great age of 56 to appear on a music awards show in a skimpy, figure-hugging costume surrounded by hunky men. Many, many people, including most of the gay men I know admonished Madonna to act her age, to remember that she isn't 21 anymore, and referred to her as ""grandma.""  But, when a man becomes a woman and appears on the cover of a mainstream magazine, in a come-hither pose, wearing a skimpy, figure-hugging costume at the greater age of 65, she is hailed for her courage and her beauty.  It's kind of exhausting, after years of fighting for equality, it takes a former man to make it okay for a woman of a certain age to dress like a sexy 21 year-old, and for the general respond is one of admiration and praise.   I am about the same age as Caitlyn, but I kind of doubt that if, in the unlikely event I were to appear on the cover of any magazine, except maybe AARP, even were I to be photographed by a brilliant and sensitive photographer, I would be regarded as, at best, ridiculous or, at worst, sad.  So I think trans-awareness is a great and important issue and needs to be out in the open and accepted. But I think the discussion needs to expand to include the broad issues of gender and aging."

Seriously, feminist women will admit that they still think there's a difference between trans and ""cis"" but now think they have no words to put on it.  opportunism : freelance writers needing a topic to talk about and get paid.

Besides the autogynephiles and what others have said; I think HRT and SRS being available has contributed to the increase of trans people. Just the existence of these and trans people and the knowledge of them spreading seems to have caused a number of people to develop dysphoria and consider transition. Or, for their parents to consider it for them. We have an example on this very post of someone saying they would not have transitioned if they had not seen others transitioning.   I think it's a volatile mix of identity politics, individualism, homophobia, misogyny and relying on peoples' desire to be seen as a good person who doesn't oppress others, someone fighting on the side of the underdog against the bigots."

And then once ASD was more well known suddenly everyone on tumblr had a case of the ass burgers.   On another level people who have felt ostracized and out of place because they don't fit society's narrow image of their sex probably find it attractive. Similarly, people who are afraid of being gay, or afraid of their kids being gay, have a ""progressive"" out that nigh-on guarantees them praise and support, not just from eager allies but because in the end they're supporting the status quo of the place of men and women in society.

It seems like some people regard a man with long hair, who wears makeup and calls himself a woman, as more of a woman than a woman who has short hair and doesn't wear makeup.  And that's part of why sometimes people will say silly things like LaVerne Cox (a man) ""is 10x the woman"" an actual woman will ever be.  Before I learned about gender critical theory, I was actually like ""wait so I don't act like a stereotype of a woman so maybe I'm genderqueer or something"" but eventually I realized that identifying as genderqueer would be silly because it would help reinforce the notion that women are walking stereotypes and if you aren't one, then you aren't a real woman. And if woman is an identity than a man could be a woman and that doesn't make sense because men aren't women. Basically I realized words had meanings."

At least, I think that explains its staying power.  I don't know exactly how we got here.  I mean, I was awake in the 90s and 00s.  I had transsexual friends with dysphoria.

They could have stacked major money behind it to peddle drugs - or, more likely, they could have done something simple like just helped pay for the venue (given that its a medical symposium attended by doctors, psychologists etc.). Both of those things are still different from a 'cloaked' education programme being a pharmaceutical 'campaign'  (Not to mention that you are referring, presumably, to the entirety of WPATH - whereas the source is a single symposium in 2003)  It's not crazy to question big corps., especially pharmaceuticals - and I admit the off-label thing is suspicious and would give them cause.

Believe it or not, it is possible that a corporation that employs and works with medical experts might want to help out with a medical symposium for reasons other than a super-secret nefarious agenda.   I get that big corps. do unethical and seedy things. But the other side of the coin is that they run a huge business that has to interact constantly with doctors and medical professionals. It is in their interests to help these people attend or run symposiums - whether for training purposes, building trust in their brand etc.    I think it's also worth noting that some (or all) of those companies may not have funded anything. Given the large number of doctors + PhDs there, it's possible that those companies just cleared/OK'ed the doctors (whose departments or research are sponsored) to attend.

It's like PACs - do you really think they're just a group of concerned citizens and not a Republican/Democrat lobbying group? I'm not really sure what your motive here is anyway. Is it bad if Trans is supported by pharma? Is that something that should be hidden even if it was like the other Health NPOs that aren't off-label?

I was like ""well, doctors and scientists say it's real. who am I to argue with them?""   But after looking more deeply into it, from what I can tell, trans is real in the sense that there are some men whose quality of life improves after transitioning. There's no (reliable/successfully replicated/reasonably interpreted) evidence that transgenderism has a physiological basis (unlike, say, intersex conditions). It MAY be neurological, but the science to back that up doesn't exist yet. What's for certain is this: if it is true, if HBS exists, MOST trans don't have it.   Anyway. The point of my rambling post is this: the evidence available points to this being a condition of psychological origin, so SRS is basically psychosurgery, a practice which medical professionals are usually–correctly–very weary of but for whatever reason (gaslighting, $$$$$) gatekeeping for this kind of psychosurgery is considered unreasonable."

I don't blame them though as I don't know what it's like to be a lesbian, and transwomen sometimes get aggressive if you don't pretend they're right.  The guy who made those threads said these things in the original post (I'm quoting the relevant parts)   I have a mind that is female.  I am not a man. I have never been a man. I never will be a man.  I am a woman. I am a lesbian.   Maybe if he says it enough it'll come true?"
GenderCritical,37tmld,Onolatry,16,Sat May 30 12:19:15 2015 UTC,"or are too afraid to speak up and call OP out   I think it's this, but I'm not sure which is better tbh. I'm glad people aren't eating that shit up but otoh, I'm kinda bummed out no one dares to speak up against it. Part of the problem seems to be that like 80% of MtTs identify as ""lesbians"" as opposed to like ~5% of the general female population (wow I wonder why, is it maybe because they are heterosexual).   This means the percentage of transbians in relation to lesbians is like 16 times higher than of trans people in the general population. And they are loud and they are bullies (male socialization surprise, surprise). For someone who claims to be oppressed, they certainly have managed to stifle conversation."

My social circles are heavy with very stable het relationships, and I'm not eager to just ignore long-time male friendships (esp. as some of them were quite supportive).

GenderCritical,37rtm1,astrologiques,6,Sun May 31 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"'Gender Identity' means whatever they need it to mean at any given moment. Depends on who they're arguing with. Gender Identity is self-expression, it's brain sex, it's sex stereotypes, it's a ~deep sense of self~, etc. It doesn't have an actual definition because an actual definition can be critiqued and picked apart.   Gender identity is purposefully vague in order to make it difficult to understand and therefore argue against. I've seen debates about this before. Someone questions gender identity, someone gives a definition. That definition is torn apart, so another is given. It's ripped apart again and again until finally gender identity is just defined as something someone 'knows' and it's a 'sense of self', which you can't exactly argue against. You just have to believe trans people are 100% right about it if you want to be a good little progressive and not an awful horrible violent bigot.   Honestly, I'd argue that the concept of 'masculinity' and 'femininity' are flawed because they are almost always used to apply human sex to arbitrary entities or actions.   Yup. But I think it's more than just clothes or activities, since not all trans people are hyperconforming in a visible, stereotypical way. I think they apply femininity and masculinity to their personalities. Rather strictly too. Some traits are feminine and some are masculine, and if you have more feminine traits you must be a woman right...?   So yeah. It's all grounded in a social construct."
GenderCritical,37rtm1,theowlgoeshoot,4,Mon Jun 1 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"The reason why, OP, you believe that identifying as a certain gender is a ""whishy washy mix"" is because that is what it is. Everyone's idea of gender is very different, even though it is similar in many ways. Take your average teenage, cisgendered upper-middle class straight girl. She'll most likely say her femininity is what makes her a girl. Now, let's take, say, a twentysomething butch lesbian and she'll probably say something along the lines of being secure enough in her womanhood to challenge the gender norms of presentation.   What makes one trans person identify with how they identify is probably very different from another trans person's. The reason why many people receive the question of ""Why?"" and respond to it in a ""whimsy-washy"" manner is probably for either one of these reasons: 1) They can barely articulate it themselves, much less explain it to someone else. It's essentially like asking why the sky is blue. 2) They do in fact understand what makes them a certain gender, but they A) Do not feel it is your business or B) it's really complicated to explain and they might just not have the time and/or the energy to do so. 3) They've had that questions so many damn times and they're tired of answering it.  I, for example identify as male for a multitude of reasons. One, I experience physical dysphoria, meaning I feel as if I should have a male appearing body (pectorals versus breasts, etc.). Two, I feel more at ease in masculinely dominated spaces and treated as another male. Three, I experience a comraderie with men that simply didn't exist with women. I never experienced the ""female bonding"" or even the ""butch-bro"" type relationship. I feel as if it is multiple factors that add up to my gender identity.   And my gender identity is just another facet of my general sense of self. I am Asian-American, and that identity carries a lot of baggage and culture and pride and has nothing to do with how I appear externally, but with my experiences. I am a hockey player and hockey fan. I love the sport, I love the fellowship, both with fans and players and I love the lifestyle. This also has nothing to do with how I appear, but with my experiences and feelings. I am also a transgender male. Like all of my other identities, being trans has nothing to do with my external appearance, but how I experience things in life, how I feel things and how I wish to live my life."

People increasingly talk about ""identifying as female"" in a way that's purportedly has nothing to do with what sex you are or for that matter, want to be.

To be clear, by fixing I mean the elimination of being autistic at all, not the modification of surface-level behaviors so that I can interact in the current world better.  As a trans person I feel pretty similarly. I'm much, much more attached to my mind and my self than I am to any individual physical features. I'd really rather be the same person I am.

So yeah, hormones will cause some changes to take place in your brain, but they're fairly minor. Like, I think medication is a valid solution for things like depression. But what you're treating with that isn't generally the predisposition your brain has for doing depression - if you stop taking antidepressants depression tends to come back. You're treating the distressing symptoms.  The main reason I take hormones isn't because of any visible physical changes they cause, it's because just having them in my body fixes the sense of constant malaise I've had my entire life."

There are plenty of disorders caused by a predisposition in the brain: Obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, many anxiety conditions. All can be treated with medication to mitigate or reverse the imbalance. No one suggests that these people's symptoms should instead be acted upon as a treatment.   So what if there was similar medicine for dysphoria, that would treat the imbalance? Wouldn't that be a better solution than dangerous hormone imbalances?"
GenderCritical,37rtm1,not-that-straight,1 point,Sun May 31 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"The medication you're referring to are hormones, though. Hormones relieve symptoms of dysphoria. And they're not dangerous except in the sense that the way they tend to be administered causes the liver to process them, which means you need to avoid putting large amounts of additional strain on your liver - but tons of other medications do that as well, it's not something exclusive to hormones. You're drawing parallels in ways that aren't making a ton of sense to me, as someone who is trans and is taking/has taken antidepressants and other meds. The aspects of the thing being treated by those medications are comparable, hormonal treatments for dysphoria aren't somehow different than hormonal treatments for ADHD (literally what adderall does is increase how much your brain responds to norepinephrine and dopamine)."

GenderCritical,37pldg,Q-Continuum-kin,1 point,Fri May 29 12:01:28 2015 UTC,This article severely underestimates the R&D time for this type of technology. the first model is designed for the group that needs it most. the fact that other groups also need the technology isnt a comment on discrimination just that the model was designed for the largest group.  also the thing about all smart phones being huge is dumb. yeah there are absurdly large tablet phones out now but something like an iphone5s is 5x2 inches.
GenderCritical,37pldg,Reddwollff,-1,Fri May 29 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"The group that needs it most? If that's the case, they needed to toss a coin, or actually count in women in working out who to design the device for because arguably they are just as much at risk or even at higher risk.  Instead, while there would be limitations due to design, women are essentially cut out of consideration. They've said they will not even look at making it smaller at present.     More than 159,000 women die each year of congestive heart failure, accounting for 56.3% of all heart failure deaths. 46% of women and 22% of men heart attack survivors will be disabled with heart failure within six years.  More women than men die of heart disease each year. 12-25% of women and 7-22% of men heart attack survivors will be diagnosed with heart failure within five years.    Health care disparities are real for women, it ranges from this sort of thing, through to real barriers to access through to research. It's worth discussing, and it is actually a real discrimination when they don't consider all the groups that might benefit from advances in medical care and technology. In particular, the female group that actually comprises 50% of the population. That's not just a wee sub-group there.   And you can't get a 5s anymore where I am, they've moved onto the bigger ones. I find that interesting, Steve Jobs said once he'd deliberately kept phone size down so that the average person could reach all of the screen while holding the phone and just using their thumb to touch an app. Probably still not quite right for women, but much better than the larger phones we see today. Now, it's tough luck, they've upsized just like all the rest."
GenderCritical,37pldg,Q-Continuum-kin,3,Sat May 30 15:30:27 2015 UTC,"so - i wasnt going to question your post at first but a few minutes after reading it i realized the statistics didnt actually address the point. neither men nor women who die of a heart attack are able to benefit from the artificial heart technology so pointing out mortality rates is irrelevant and misleading.  point 1 - mortality rate so irrelevant.  point 2 - misleading because far more men survive heart attacks than women and the number says nothing of the totals, only of the percents. the article i will link will explain much of this point.  point 3 - again a mortality rate so irrelevant.  point 4 - essentially same thing as 2.  This article was particularly interesting: http://corporate.dukemedicine.org/news_and_publications/news_office/news/gender_differences_explain_death_rates_following_a_heart_attack   ""When women have a heart attack they are sicker, older, and have more risk factors, which explains the mortality difference,"" Douglas said.  Mortality rates at 30 days were nearly 10 percent in women and 5 percent in men. After adjusting for personal characteristics and disease severity, there was not a significant difference between the genders.  Women were older with more high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart failure. Men were more likely to be smokers and have had a history of heart attack or bypass surgery. These differences were observed across the range of acute coronary syndromes.   from the wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction   Worldwide, more than 3 million people have STEMIs and 4 million have NSTEMIs a year. STEMIs occur about twice as often in men as women.  At any given age, men are more at risk than women, particularly before menopause, but because in general women live longer than men, ischemic heart disease causes slightly more total deaths in women.   so from those facts it would seem that when women have heart attacks they are older and less likely to survive in the first place and then men are more likely to have a heart attack at any given age group. they are 2x more likely to experience STEMI which is the severe blockage type. this isnt some type of conspiracy. this looks like the ford model T heart.  about the phone, really not that hard. http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=iphone+5s"
GenderCritical,37pldg,Reddwollff,1 point,Sun May 31 05:40:45 2015 UTC,"statistics didnt actually address the point. neither men nor women who die of a heart attack are able to benefit from the artificial heart    Incorrect. The article stated heart failure ...""If you’re a woman with heart failure, you might have to wait a bit longer.""   Each of these stats deal with heart failure. Heart attacks do have to be mentioned as they can lead to heart failure down the track, but you seem to have replaced all the references to heart failure with the words heart attack. I have bolded all the references to heart failure of which the fatality and other statistics are completely relevant.    More than 159,000 women die each year of congestive heart failure, accounting for 56.3% of all heart failure deaths. 46% of women and 22% of men heart attack survivors will be disabled with heart failure within six years. More women than men die of heart disease each year. 12-25% of women and 7-22% of men heart attack survivors will be diagnosed with heart failure within five years.   Edit: Just noticed this factoid in your text: ""Women were older with more high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart failure."" So that kind of confirms my point. You could argue they should have been prime candidates at the outset. And also to note high BP/Cholesteraemia/diabetes are treatable, and therefore modifiable risk factors and it does need to be asked why this is higher in women when it's so easy to screen for and institute treatment.    And also, just saying if gender differences do make a difference to mortality, yes, they should be looking at it. They certainly have paid attention to males dying young from heart attacks and have developed treatment modalities specifically to address that issue - and it's worked. The gap in longevity is rapidly narrowing. They, in doing this, have pretty much ignored women and when they've done research it's been mostly just men they've studied. They should have been making sure women were well represented, because it's quite clear their patient characteristics are different, but instead they've only just seemed to realise that women may present differently when they have a heart attack and doctors have often missed critical symptoms leading to late diagnosis and poorer care overall in management of heart attack.

And the change in in-hospital mortality isn't surprising - the introduction of streptokinase ""clot busting"" drug which if given within a short time of a cardiac event improves outcomes greatly. This, of course, does not alter the data involving cardiac mortality overall for women nor heart failure rates. It's very specific to management of diagnosed MI in the hospital setting and survival rates there.   It's also quite clear factors that are modifiable and that would reduce incidence of heart attack are better managed in males, much less well managed in women.   They point to assumptions about women that mean their specific heart attack risk is ignored. End result is women get poorer care overall. Those differences really mean something.    Both studies found men age 35 to 54 experienced more heart attacks than did women in the same age group. But authors of one study, on midlife coronary heart disease risk and prevalence trends, found the gap between women and men narrowed over the past two decades, as heart attacks decreased in prevalence among men and increased in women.  ""Despite the improvement in hospital mortality rates, cardiovascular risks for middle-age women have worsened in recent years, while men's risks have improved, according to the heart-attack prevalence study""...""There was little improvement in women's coronary disease risk factors, including cholesterol, systolic blood pressure levels and smoking""...""Among middle-age men, on the other hand, only diabetes mellitus prevalence worsened, while other risk factors remained stable or improved.""  ""This just tells us we have a lot of work to do in terms of preventing women from needing to go to the emergency room. There's still room for prevention of the first heart attack""...""Doctors have to be more aggressive in addressing women's risk factors, screening for diabetes and heart disease, and counseling them on nutrition and smoking cessation,"" Dr. Goldberg said.""

So keep stretching. It would not necessarily change R&D time to consider the body size of the people it's going into before hand, and look at the possibility of different size models to go with that. Pretty basic consideration.  If women are more than two times likely to develop heart failure than men, despite more heart attacks in that group, yes, they could have should have considered this in development. They don't come out and say clearly there was a limit on this, which would be an easy refutation to the charge, so we have to assume they only developed the one size and didn't really consider the average smaller body size of women."

With the only division between men and women being private, personal beliefs, builders, restaurants, etc. will not be indulging this -- they will be building one-holers and unisex bathrooms.

The aim of this study is to describe the adolescent applicants for legal and medical sex reassignment during the first two years of adolescent gender identity team in Finland, in terms of sociodemographic, psychiatric and gender identity related factors and adolescent development. METHODS:  Structured quantitative retrospective chart review and qualitative analysis of case files of all adolescent SR applicants who entered the assessment by the end of 2013.  RESULTS:  The number of referrals exceeded expectations in light of epidemiological knowledge. Natal girls were markedly overrepresented among applicants. Severe psychopathology preceding onset of gender dysphoria was common. Autism spectrum problems were very common.  CONCLUSION:  The findings do not fit the commonly accepted image of a gender dysphoric minor. Treatment guidelines need to consider gender dysphoria in minors in the context of severe psychopathology and developmental difficulties.  Adolescents seeking sex reassignment represent a variety of developmental pathways differentiated by the timing of onset of gender dysphoria, psychopathology and developmental difficulties. It is important to be aware of the different groups, or developmental pathways, in gender dysphoric adolescents in order to be able to find appropriate treatment options. In the presence of severe psychopathology and developmental difficulties, medical SR treatments may not be currently advisable. Treatment guidelines need to be reviewed extended to appreciate the complex situations."

There were no calls to provide a pathway to legal citizenship for undocumented sex workers. No calls to have migrant workers in the industry to be eligible for government benefits. No demands for a living wage. There wasn't a single thing they advocated that would help highly vulnerable women and the economic destitute from being preyed on.

It's pointless to bring these things up with most transactivists because they refuse to examine the flawed premise of their argument (""transwomen are women"") that leads them to believe those things in the first place.  So transwomen are regarded as a subgroup of women and ""women have privilege over men"" turns into ""cis women have privilege over trans women""."

So we've got no true scotsman.  These news reports:  Source one  Source two  Source three  Note that they use the transadvocate as a source for claims that all the evidence that any instances occurred were ""fabricated"". Make of that what you will.  Note that the majority of people saying it's not a problem are personnel from Human Rights Organisations.  Note that the police forces are saying ""We're not aware"" or ""We haven't heard"".  Here is a list of the police agencies who responded and what they said:  Des Moines Police Department: ""We have not seen that. I doubt that's gonna encourage the behavior. If the behavior's there, [sexual predators are] gonna behave as they're gonna behave no matter what the laws are.""  Cambridge Police Superintendent: Back in 1984 Cambridge enacted an ordinance that established the Human Rights Commission. The purpose of the ordinance was to protect the human rights of all citizens of the City. In 1997 this ordinance was amended to specifically include gender identity and expression. Much like the Transgender Equal Rights Bill proposal, the City of Cambridge sought to offer protection to transgender individuals from being harassed, fired from a job, denied access to a public place, or denied or evicted from housing. Since this 1997 amendment there have been no incidents or issues regarding persons abusing this ordinance or using them as a defense to commit crimes. Specifically, as was raised as a concern if the bill were to be passed, there have been no incidents of men dressing up as women to commit crimes in female bathrooms and using the city ordinance as a defense.  Minneapolis Police Department: Fears About Sexual Assault ""Not Even Remotely"" A Problem. Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder told Media Matters in an interview that sexual assaults stemming from Minnesota's 1993 transgender non-discrimination law have been ""not even remotely"" a problem. Based on his experience, the notion of men posing as transgender women to enter women's restrooms to commit sex crimes ""sounds a little silly,"" Elder said. According to Elder, a police department inquiry found ""nothing"" in the way of such crimes in the city.  Las Vegas Police Department: ""the answer would be no."" After the department's lieutenant for sexual assault ran a check of crimes since 2011, Roybal told Media Matters that the department had not ""had any incidents involving transgender suspects.""  Albuquerque Police Department: We are unaware of any cases of assault in our city as a result of transgendered [sic] accommodations.  Portland Police Department: I have never heard of any issues like this in Portland. We have a very low rate of sexual assault/rape crimes here overall.  Montpelier Police Department: ""We do not have any complaints related to this issue.""   (NB: Make sure to read the full text as the questions each department was asked was different or not stated)  Is there any particular reason why these questions were only asked of the major city and not the state?"

GenderCritical,36u95j,La_Diabla,3,Sat May 23 03:44:50 2015 UTC,"Have been speaking to the person who sent me the link.  I have given this person the links provided about attacks on women by males in feminine garments.  This is the conversation thus far:  Other user in bold   For one, those articles are all very specifically hateful and anti-trans, and are full of completely false statements.   If you disagree with the people's views that's fine.  But notice that they are links to NEWS reports. As in these things have been documented to happen.   I don't think there was mention of these crimes specifically happening due to, or after, Trans people gaining rights or access.   I didn't say they did. I said they happened.   Is it fair to put Transgender people directly in harms way, and never allow them safety, simply so that it's easier to spot a twisted predator on the extremely unlikely chance you will come across one?   Is it fair to put women at risk and tell them not to question males in female spaces on the off chance they offend a trans""woman""?  Think about this statistically, trans are about 0.6-1% of the population. Males are about 50%.   The number of predators in that male population probably far exceeds the number of trans people.  That means that because of a maximum 1% of people, 50% of the population gets put at risk.  We are more likely to encounter a predator than a trans""woman"".  Most (if not all) women on the planet, have encountered a predator. How many would you say have met a trans person?  There is absolutely no way to prevent 100% of crime. It's impossible.  What we do is mitigate the risks.  The way that all those men were caught was because women knew ""This person should not be in this space"" and alerted security.  You argue that now women should not question males in female spaces because we might possibly upset a tiny fraction of the population.  If the argument is safety, why are offers to use unisex facilities at schools (trans youth) rejected?  Why are unisex facilities never championed?  Cathy Brennan and Elizabeth Hungerford even offered up an alternative that was that persons should have documentation stating their transition process from a therapist. They were both decried as ""gatekeeping"" bitches.  If it was about safety, why is that such a hard thing to ask for?  If you're seeking refuge in the women's because you're afraid of being beaten in the men's, wouldn't you the additional protection knowing that persons without any documentation would be liable for criminal charges?"

GenderCritical,36b9m9,mrsgetlost,3,Sun May 17 23:47:33 2015 UTC,"This was a good read.   Regarding the rate at which male-to-trans commit violent crimes, there is no reason to think that their crime rate is any different from that of other males. In fact, there is research to show exactly this:    Second, regarding any crime, male-to-females had a significantly increased risk for crime compared to female controls (aHR 6.6; 95% CI 4.1–10.8)** but not compared to males** (aHR 0.8; 95% CI 0.5–1.2). This indicates that they retained a male pattern regarding criminality. The same was true regarding violent crime. By contrast, female-to-males had higher crime rates than female controls (aHR 4.1; 95% CI 2.5–6.9) but did not differ from male controls. This indicates a shift to a male pattern regarding criminality and that sex reassignment is coupled to increased crime rate in female-to-males. The same was true regarding violent crime.   And, just because every time i post this study, someone trots out this paragraph:   Transsexual individuals were at increased risk of being convicted for any crime or violent crime after sex reassignment (Table 2); this was, however, only significant in the group who underwent sex reassignment before 1989.   This says that transsexuals who underwent sex reassignment before 1989 had an increased risk of being convicted of crimes. This is not the case for males who underwent sex reassignment after 1989, but they still have the same crime rate as other males."

After committing a murder, he would dress up in high heels and masturbate.  ** Soon after his mother's death, Gein began to create a ""woman suit"" so that ""...he could become his mother—to literally crawl into her skin"".

This set of comments was particularly depressing though.   sylvania 17 May 2015 at 4:10 am   Beatrice, no. The foundational argument between feminists and trans is whether gender is innate. Trans say it is, feminists say it is a patriarchal ordering system designed to subordinate women. Feminism has always said gender is a system designed to subordinate women. That’s what feminism is. No hate. It’s the critique of the way in which men and women are treated differently, based on their sex, from the second they are born. If gender is innate, if being a woman means you have a suite of certain characteristics and behaviours, there’s no basis for saying men and women have the same potential, or should be treated equally. And that’s because the gendered representation of women is inherently inferior. Why? Because gender is the system of making women subordinate to men. When men say they identify as women, and you ask them, “What is a woman?”, they are referring to this suite of behaviours. That’s what gender is. That’s it. That’s the argument.   Pink Jenkin 17 May 2015 at 5:28 am @sylvania:   How does it feel to be part of a dying, hated breed that could be safely ignored by polite society if not for the damage your kind causes in its last desperate death throes?

GenderCritical,367sin,BetAle,6,Sun May 17 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"For many non-trans women the idea that the essence of being a woman resides in ‘feeling like’ a woman, is not so much wrong as incomprehensible. Our experience of womanhood is not an internal feeling, but a lifelong process of being subjected to – and revolting against – very specific social sanctions and expectations. Be quiet. Look pretty. Make yourself small. Smile. Don’t be too demanding. Accommodate other people.   Yes and yes.

GenderCritical,367sin,linoleumblock,6,Sun May 17 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"Fantastic article.  Some favorite quotes:  On sex-based oppression (misogyny):   When feminists raise these points, we are sometimes accused of indulging in ‘academic’ debates when other people’s lives are at stake, as if the constricting of female persons by patriarchy was somehow not about people’s lives. But this debate is not academic for anyone involved. For both trans and non-trans women, what is at stake is the ability to understand themselves in a way that makes their lives livable. For feminist women, the axiom ‘trans women are women,’ when understood to mean ‘womanhood is gender identity and hence, trans women are women in exactly the same way as non-trans women are women’ is experienced as an extreme erasure of the way our being-as-women is marked by a system of patriarchal violence that aims to control our sexed bodies.   On framing differences as privilege:   Privilege — a once useful way of illustrating how certain structures bend the world around the interests of particular classes — is now routinely invoked to describe any advantage that another person lacks, whether or not that advantage stems from a system of structural domination. Indeed, advantage itself is often assumed to be ample evidence of the existence of oppression.   On where lesbians, gays, and trans people fit into the framework of misogyny:   The oppression of women-as-women is established by understanding the function of that oppression: women-as-a-class are oppressed by men-as-a-class for the purpose of, Frye continues, “the service of men and men’s interest, which includes the bearing and raising of children” as well as a variety of other “service work” including domestic and personal service, sexual service and ego or emotional service (p.9). Women are oppressed as women because that oppression enables men to extract resources — in the form of reproductive, domestic, sexual and emotional labour — from women. Similarly, class- and race-based oppression is structured around the extraction of labour-resources from the oppressed group. And the question we must then ask is, in what sense are the real limitations experienced by trans people to be understood as part of a specific structure of oppression aimed at extracting resources from trans people as a class?  Again, it is useful to compare this case with discrimination against homosexuals. Gay men and lesbians experience, or have experienced, profound limitations on their ability to lead flourishing lives. Those limitations did not, however, arise out of the desire of non-homosexual people to appropriate the labour of homosexual people as a class. Rather, limitations on the free expression of homosexuality arose as an adjunct of patriarchal ideas about the ‘naturalness’ of heterosexual coupling, and the ‘natural’ gender roles of the sexed individuals within that coupling. That is, the injunction against homosexuality is part of heteronormativity, and since the primary function of heteronormativity is to naturalise men’s appropriation of women’s bodies, the restrictions on homosexuality are a variant of patriarchal oppression.  Similarly, the limitations on trans people’s freedom to determine their gendered-expression results from the fact that such expressions have been gendered by patriarchy. But this is an explanatory framework which trans ideology – with its conception of innate gender – is totally unable to access. In its place, transgender ideology posits an entirely unmotivated system of cis-gender oppression which inheres, not in the yoking of particular sexed bodies to acceptable gendered behaviours, but in the very identification of sexual dimorphism in humans.  Here we encounter a perfect inversion of feminist thought. In the place of the material reality of sex and the social construction of gender, we find the social construction of sex and the material reality of gender. What feminist thinkers have traditionally identified as the essentialist yoking of sexed-body to gendered behaviour is rewritten as the privilege of alignment between one’s gender identity and the sex one is coercively assigned at birth."

She told Payne: I married a man, not a woman—but she also admitted that she wasn’t entirely surprised. With mixed feelings, Payne’s wife stayed in the marriage, and the family moved from Kansas to California, in part so Payne could be more comfortable living as a transgender woman.   Because that's what women do. They stand by their man, even if their man wants to be a woman, and they face the consequences of their husband's actions. They put their feelings aside and do what is expected of them, man's feelings first, own feelings last, but if they do say, ""No, I don't want to be a part of this,"" they're branded as cruel, transphobic, and selfish."

GenderCritical,3673vg,Eclectic58,5,Sat May 16 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, I was just thinking about something similar today and was considering posting about it. My idea was more along the lines that I can believe that it is wrong to persecute, harass or discriminate against someone for their religion and still not believe their religion is based on factual reality. I can believe that Islam isn't true but still think it is wrong to firebomb a Mosque.   But with transgender issues, people act like if you have a different opinion on gender, you automatically support violence against trans people. I definitely support legal protection for discriminating against transgender people and treating violence against transgender people as hate crimes, but I also don't believe just having a ""gender identity"" makes that a factual reality. According to transactivists, this makes me transphobic, even though it isn't any different than my stance above about Islam, and no one could accuse me of being Islamaphobic.   Taking the religion comparison a little further, a lot of people say that people gender identities must be real because they suffer so much for having them, but plenty of Born Again Christians also turn their lives upside-down when they convert, and I don't think that proves the existence of the Christian god."

This report suggests that the percent of transgender people is lower, maybe .3% of the population, so 1 in 333 should be murder victims. But in 2013, there were 14,196 murders in the U.S., and in 2014, 14 transgender people were murdered, meaning that only 1 in 1,000 murder victims were transgender.

There is ZERO evidence that fantasizing or masturbating to ideas of children being sexualized is in any way an ""outlet"" that is cathartic and makes pedophiles less likely to offend.  The more a pedophile sexualizes children, even in private fantasy away from kids, the more likely they become to offend.

If you're sexualizing a sexually immature being--even if it's only done in your fantasies--drastic measures are needed to fix your brain.  Since science doesn't know how to change sexual attraction or fetishes, the only option is to kill your libido or lock you up.  As long as those urges exist and you're walking free, your very existence is a threat to others.

One of the things you look for when you are assessing an explosion or deliberate fire/explosion is the motive behind the crime.  There is an ideological component to these crimes but there is also the intent.  One of the things I have been taught is when you have an incident is ""did they achieve the desired effect?. So for terrorists did they create terror, panic and disruption? Someone seeking to cause those effects is a terrorist. They SEEK to cause terror.  Same with paedophiles. They think about raping children. The whole effect is domination (rape) over another individual.   Whether or not they act on it, the intent in their brain is to rape children. Children cannot consent. Their primary motive is to rape.  We do not, as a society, deem that rape is an uncontrolled feeling or something we should sympathise with. Nor do we consider the feeling that causing mass harm (which rape creates) as something that should be ""understood"".  We are animals. Humans are animals.  Animals will eject and kill animals of their species that deviate and cause harm to the group. Rape (a violent act) causes much harm and we as human animals should ostracise and kill those that perpetuate it as it causes a detrimental effect to society.  An orgasm (rape) is not a right. Paedophiles may have a miswiring in the brain, they are still maladaptive to our society and should be killed. Rape of children is detrimental to our society, it creates much harm. It solely exists for the perpetrator to get an orgasm."

The denial of the subjective reality of the oppressed is a defining characteristic of the middle class.   To me this reads like a slightly more sophisticated version of the “you’re erasing trans people by not validating their gender identity” trope.   As far as I’ve seen, no one is denying the subjective reality of trans people, merely disagreeing with their interpretation of said reality. If it’s now “bourgeois” to apply critical thought and analysis to the self-reported “subjective realities” of people who may happen to belong to oppressed classes, then so be it.  Also, if trans people face oppression, it’s certainly not as a politically coherent oppressed class: They may face oppression as a result of homophobia (MtFs), or on the basis of their biological sex (FtMs). No one, however, is oppressed on the basis of their so-called “gender identity”.     Soujouna Truth would have a fit with this place. Aint I a woman too?   Soujourner Truth would probably not be all that concerned with the ""oppression"" of rich white male autogynephiles.

Very much this.  No one denies any reports of dysphoria. No one denies that trans people (particularly non-passing people) get viewed as ""freakish"" often and suffer discrimination on that basis.  No one is denying any sincere reports of feeling as if you're ""born in the wrong body.""  It's entirely possible to acknowledge suffering and acknowledge that yeah, it probably does feel to you that you're born in the wrong body, while not accepting the idea that ""born in the wrong body"" or the ""ladybrain"" actually exists.  Because interpretation and subjective experience is just that - subjective experience.   Requiring someone else to accept your interpretation of your ""identity"" as being somehow based on certain ""facts"" is like asking someone else to believe in your religion, and in particular that religion's origin story and the reality defined by it - despite what that origin story might have to say about other people or other religions.  I don't need to believe that God created me as lesser than you, or that humans emerged fully formed from a hole in the ground in New Mexico - even if that's what your religion proclaims as true - to allow you civil rights and the freedom to worship as you wish.   The currently in vogue 2015 version of the trans identity story runs counter to traditional feminist ideas.  It requires people to believe that there is some preordained ""proper"" matching between genitalia and personality traits, and that there is a ""women's way of thinking"" (which must exist in order for male people to think they can identify that in themselves). It requires people to believe that this ""woman's way of thinking"" is largely formed by hormones. Put your brain on women's hormones, turn out femmy! Or hey, I think I'm ""femmy!"" Must be all the women's hormones I got! (Let's not ask where the penis came from...)  Surely it's obvious that this idea of a ""women's way of thinking"" is pretty offensive to feminists? It's something that women have been fighting against for ages.  The idea of your behavior needing to ""match"" your bits is something else that women have fought against for ages. The idea that women are more ""emotional"" or have some inborn need to be ""cute"" similarly.  So it's not all that surprising that women (and certainly not only ""middle class"" women, either) are standing up against the same old stuff again.  Furthermore, if you want to talk ""lived experience,"" what of the lived experience of female-born people? If someone wants to talk about how we don't know what it's like to be trans, well, M2T don't know what it's like to be female or to grow up identified BY OTHERS as girls!  I mean, the endless speculation that people are constantly engaging in about it is pretty damn hilarious."

I think the basic point is that they objectively are irrelevant compared to struggles females still feel systematically just for being born in the wrong body (the one with a vagina, oh the irony). There's no reason anyone should care that much and trans talk has poisoned the libfem discourse and the one in the lesbian community as well. Now essentialist and elitist are used as insults against lesbians who dare to have a preference exclusively for females (that is for lesbians who are lesbians, how about that tautology) and are dog-whistles for lesbophobia.   I think a lot of people fall into the trap of giving them much importance, I know I did. I was so glad to find this place, at least for venting. They are treated like a fucking endangered species. Even people who are nice to them are simply giving them pity and do it so they would feel good about themselves, being all tolerant and inclusive.

You mentioned supernumerary phantom limbs before, someone feeling a limb that has never been there, and that has absolutely been tested.   Everything scientific is tested, that's how science works.   You can experience things that don't map to objective reality, but that's sort of the point of phantom sensation in the first place: that the limb doesn't exist. So I'm confused.   How are you confused? If it doesn't match objective reality then it's pretty clear it's not true, isn't it? Unless you're using the word objective incorrectly.   Here's an example of untrue feelings not necessarily being lies. There was a test of crystal healing where people self-reported feeling the benefits of fake crystals they believed were real.

I'm sure people do experience sex dysphoria and it can be quite hard for them, but it would be socially induced. Note that just because something is social doesn't mean its not real or difficult.  What makes me say this is that the brain/body map problem usually only happens to people who have lost a limb in adulthood. Do blind people who were always blind have a brain/body map problem? What about people who were born without limbs? I'm not being factious here; I am generally curious. If a brain/body mismap from birth is a real, biological thing, we would expect to see it elsewhere."
GenderCritical,35s3n9,a_socialist_feminist,5,Wed May 13 13:01:33 2015 UTC,"FWIW, ""environmentally induced"" and ""physically present in the brain"" are not mutually exclusive.  For instance, there is growing evidence of a neurological component to BIID, a disorder where the patient sincerely believes that a body part (usually a limb) does not belong to them, and may even demand that it be amputated.  While BIID patients often report feelings dating back to early childhood, the intensity of their feelings and even the limb(s) that trouble them frequently change over time (see Discussion of this paper).  There is also evidence that sexual paraphelia may be involved in at least some cases, suggesting that there may be a sort of ""sexual trigger"" involved that directed the form of the delusion.  TL;DR: It's possible that sex dysmorphia is both socially induced and also a physiological problem with the brain."

However, one place where things tend to be at least somewhat solid is when you can definitively say that the patient's brain is not registering objective reality.  If a patient's brain is telling them that their totally-healthy leg is evil and needs to be cut off, we feel confident in saying that there is a disorder at work.

If someone is told their whole life that they're ""wrong"" for their sex because of their interests and tastes, they'll believe it.   For example if a young man was told repeatedly throughout childhood that he can't like the things he likes because ""that's for girls"" or ""only girls can do that"", and also feels as if he's ""failing"" manhood, he may react by thinking maybe he's actually a girl, rather than it's society's standards that are enforced by social pressure.   Especially now that there's a high-profile subculture that will tell him yes, you are really a girl inside. A subculture that keeps reaching back further and further in age until we have parents who decide for their child that the child is the opposite sex because of their tastes and interests."

I feel dysphoric about my breasts, my height, my ridiculously tiny hands, and various other glaringly female aspects of my body besides my genitalia.  The thing is that trans ideology claims that a problem presenting in the mind must only be solved by radical alterations to the body. There is no attempt to discover the psychological roots of dysphoria and tackle those therapeutically- the emphasis is always that you MUST pursue hormones and surgery or you will absolutely kill yourself.  Personally I can trace the roots of my dysphoria both to the imposition of hetero-femininity on me as a young butch lesbian, and to the anxiety and hyper-obsessive tendencies that I developed as a result of abuse in my early twenties. I know many other detransitioners and desisters who have come to understand how their dysphoria stems from sexual abuse (creating a particular psychological fixation/horror towards one's genitals), or other incidences of trauma. Very often feelings of generalised body discomfort can morph into sex/gender-specific dysphoria once you're introduced to the idea of transgenderism- again I know personally that encountering the idea that I could ""become a man"" made my body issues focus in a new and nastier way."

According to the video:  ""…research shows that adolescents who present with gender variance, or transgender identity go on to be transgender older adolescents and adults 100% of the time.""  I've never seen serious trans activists claim anything like this.  Sure, they'll put the percentages way higher than I think are actually supported by data, but I've never seen them claim 100%.  (Which is just as well given that I personally disprove the 100% statistic.  I thought I was trans since before I knew that was the word for it, I've been ""gender-variant"" all my life, and I never transitioned.  I never plan to do so.)  Wonder what on Earth is going on with this.  EDIT 1:  I tracked down the source of the quote that the video cites as being from ""Primary Care Protocol for Transgender Patient Care, Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, UCSF.""  The full quote:   Here's what the limited research shows: most gender variant natal boys will go on to be gay adolescents and adults, and unpublished data reveals 50% of gender variant natal girls will go on to become transgender adolescent and adult men. This data does not particularly distinguish those children who have a persistent and consistent transgender identity. What that means is that we currently have no predictors whatsoever in the research world to understand or inform the trajectory of each gender variant child. However, what the research also shows is that adolescents who present with gender variance, or a transgender identity go on to be transgender older adolescents and adults 100% of the time.    I guess they're saying that ""gender-variant"" little kids may grow out of it, but if a kid is still identifying as 'trans' at adolescence then there's a 100% chance they'll stay trans for life?  (They provided no citations so I'm not able to clarify or verify any of this.)  Even if true, this doesn't support what the video-maker wants it to support.  The video was trying to argue against Mark Cummings' statement that ""80% of these kids revert back.""  Note that Mark is talking about kids, and this Center for Excellence source seems to agree with his view that most gender-variant kids do not become transgender adults.   EDIT 2: So now having watched 1) the linked video (again), 2) the Mark Cummings video that sparked this response, and 3) the new video that Mark Cummings and his partner just put up, it looks to me like at least a large part of the story here is actually about a long and unpleasant personal history between Mark Cummings and Jenn Burleton (who put out the OP video).   I'm still confused about how the Center for Excellence fits in to all this and why they're claiming that 100% of trans youth will become trans adults, but maybe I'm reading too far into things and this is just a case of some people using a public issue as a vector for their personal dispute."

I would not be a bit surprised if a hundred percent of them are indeed diagnosed as transgender, given that it is a self-reported condition with no objective diagnostic tests. So  many of the trans kid narrative involve parents whose pediatricians say ""don't worry, your kid is normal and doesn't need treatment."" The parent then makes their way to a ""gender clinic"" and lo and behold the child is trans and the pediatrician was wrong, ignorant and clueless."

If 80% or more of those children don't feel that way later on, they have no reason to do any medical treatments at all. Rather the better course is wait and see what happens. That doesn't suit the interests of the adults and medical fraternity pushing it, so they engage in lies. Even the 100% persistence when adolescents/adults present with gender variance has got to be a lie, there are definitely those that either don't go through with it or only engage with partial treatment and yet others that later change their minds and detransition.  That there might be history between these people doesn't matter, the video is blatant smear campaign against a couple of people that are questioning this and this is also done to obscure what they and the organisation is about.

Please understand that coming out about this in this way has been the most painful thing I have ever had to do, I am going to be completely social drained and will be withdrawing from posting further for tonight   So not that painful then, apparently.   something no feminist ever dares to talk about   Yep, feminists never talk about the abuse of minors by adult males.  ...  Wait, I'm pretty sure that's wrong somewhere. Oh yeah, it's wrong pretty much everywhere.   drag up some empathy for an abuse victim   Ah, the minor involved in all of this. Sure, I've got plenty of-   sit down and let me tell you my story   Oh, yes, poor you. Having sex with all those minors must be so tough. I just have tons of empathy for you... (This is sarcasm, just in case anyone was unsure.)   one you will never hear about people like me.   Except from a metric fuckton of people on the internet, you mean.   try to think of it as just your standard attraction to a type of body / person.   Great, so get consent. What's that, you don't want to wait until they can actually legally give consent? Well, that's on you then.   in a world where medicine has pathologized you as being inherently doomed to act out and abuse a child   Seeing as how this dude had sex with a kid (multiple times?), he's actually proven them right.  Of course, I'm pretty sure the standard treatment for someone who hadn't been abusing kids would be therapy, so the dude doesn't even know medicine.   where people use terms like pedophile and sex offender completely interchangeably    No one does. ""sex offender"" is a much broader term, after all. :P   in a world where people openly call for the assault, murder, imprisonment and castration of people who feel like you do.    Sure, advocacy of violence is not good. The key thing here though is that advocating violence doesn't mean that someone's other points are actually wrong.   I’m sure you can imagine that I internalized all of these extremely aggressive, violent and negative sentiments,   Not really. My self-esteem isn't tied to what other people think of me.   which caused me to desperately hate myself   And so instead of trying to change for the better, you just embraced the awful, and whine when people act exactly the same as normal.  What part of this was supposed to be a good plan again?   I was told victims of violence become abusers themselves, I believed it   And then reinforced the idea by taking advantage of minors.  No, seriously, what part of this was a good plan?   I was told to never talk about it again   Pretty darn mild response there.   and received punishment via emotional and physical abuse (spanks) for it   Uh... what? People generally only spank little kids, when the hell was this happening? It makes no sense.   This made me close my heart, retreat within, feel isolated and alone and without support unable to deal with my feelings. I felt nobody in the entire world understood me and would love me for who I am.   *plays sad music while donning heavy eyeshadow in the rain*   All of this at age fucking 13.   So let me get this straight... At 13, you were attracted to people your own age, and somehow managed to express this so frikin' poorly that you got spanked for it. Even most fundamentalist religious folks would only have done so if you were saying you wanted to have sex at that age, they wouldn't have objected to you having crushes on people your own age. This still makes no sense.   I took up drawing so I could draw the the things I was fantasizing about.   Right, cause drawing sex fantasies of kids is a great plan to- Nope, still not seeing how any of this is a good plan.   My parents found the drawings stuffed behind my bed frame.    And you kept them around where they could be found?! You're reaching cliché movie villain levels of dumb here.   and was basically abused into pretending these feelings did not exist.   Assuming that's even an accurate description of what happened, it doesn't make having sex with minors suddenly okay. Like what even?   it had to do with what people told me to believe about people with these attractions. I didn’t realize then that I am better than that.   And you proved it by rising above the urges, and becoming a beacon of morality and- Wait, no, you just went ahead and had sex with people who don't know enough about anything to properly consent to sex. I know I'm harping on this a lot, but what part of this was supposed to be a good plan!?   Eventually I figured out that I was transgender woman   And now for something completely different.  Also, nice job reinforcing the stereotype that trans folks are all just perverts or victims of abuse. I'm sure any sane ones are supper appreciative of that. Jerk.   my parents had their own opinions and emotionally and physically abused me for most of my teenage years until they finally gave in   Jesus, we get it, you were ""abused"". Now get on with it!   I was subject to a mandatory cis white male therapist   Uh, no. You were supposed to get therapy at the mental health clinic you voluntarily went to.  Yes, it's unfortunate that many positions are primarily filled with rich white guys, but you were not ""subjected"" to one. Also, lol. As if some random therapist is going to magically turn out to be trans so you can feel like the whole world revolves around you/trans.   He told me that I might be able to use my attractions to get myself on estrogen quicker   Which you'd be in favor of, as you believe you're a woman, correct?   (treatments for “pedophiles with penises is estrogen, which is fucking sexist honestly, testosterone = rapist? fuck)   Ooooookay then... Also, testosterone does indeed effect the sex drive. It has nothing to do with ""men = rapists"" and everything to do with ""lower testosterone = lower sex drive"". Do you even biology?   I saw any opportunity to get on hormone treatments quicker as a plus and all I wanted at this point was some respite from this eternal numbness and sadness.   So you did want the hormones anyway. Why were you complaining then? Also, *turns on more emo music*   so they could take advantage of me and have me in a vulnerable position   As opposed to having sex with people much younger than you, which isn't remotely taking advantage of them... Also, how many damn times are you going to claim that you're the vulnerable. It's getting pretty old. Knock it off.   I had experienced attraction to some kids I knew...[.] Apparently that last part set off some red flags in their ethics committee and Children’s Aid was called on my family.   So, honest question, what happened to your brain? It's clearly missing if this surprised you at all.   A worker came into my home, talked about my attractions with me, I assured her I’m a moral upstanding person who would never do anything like that.   ""I'm a moral upstanding person, I just find sexual excitement when I imagine having sex with people who don't know enough to properly consent.""   Now pretty much everyone in my family vaguely thinks I’m a fucking rapist   And you prove them wrong and rise up against cruel fate by, becoming, a, statutory rapist... Oh for the love of...   By this point I am so ridden with anxiety and depression   Okay, god, shut up about your ""depression"" already. Even the most wannabe of wannabe emos thinks you're overdoing it now.   I start to develop mental disorders and become an overall entire wreck of a human being   So no change then?   burying myself into vices like gaming.   what.  Okay, there are plenty of issues with the games industry, yeah, but ""vices""? ""Vices""? ""Beware the evils of the Devil's snares! Pong is the road to hell! Pac Man is an invitation to demons!""   Not once through this whole ordeal am I treated like a human being   Yes you are. Humans treat humans horribly all the time. Like when an adult has sex with a 15 year old.   like a moral person   Well, you've demonstrated that you're not, so...   like a person with a heart, a soul, a[n] opportunity for greatness   It's like a shitty ripoff of ""I have a dream"" going on in here.   Does anyone here want to tell me that any of this is the appropriate response to a child feeling these attractions?   Dude, I don't even believe you're presenting this even slightly accurately at this point. I've seen crappy teen ""goth"" poetry that was happier than your story.   I wasn’t even an adult at this point, I was just a fucking kid   And you'd go on to be just fucking kids.  ...  That pun was terrible. I apologize to everyone who read it. You have my condolences.   I did not feel like an adult   Pretty sure no one does dude. Have you ever talked to anyone in your life?   I continued to feel like that lonely, guilty, sad little girl who was used as a sexual object and left to cry on her bed.   Okay, now you're just using your ""I'm a girl"" schtick to try and drum up more sympathy from people. You're disgusting.   and often times I accepted that it was over and something would just take me over do whatever it can to kill me dead.   Did you ever really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?   Two things helped save me from this torture   Okay, someone should make an emo song that rips its lyrics straight from this. It'd be hilarious.   first was finding a online group of pedophiles with experiences like mine and morals like mine   Ah, so you found 4chan then. *rimshot*   and gave me a purpose in pursuing anti-C[hild]S[sexual]A[buse] activism and understanding consent politics.   Which you then proceeded to piss on by having sex with fifteen year olds...   because I understand who I am now and what my purpose is   Advocating for ignoring consent. That's uh... that's a pretty horrifying purpose, to be totally honest."
GenderCritical,35otpt,AliceTheGorgon,1 point,Tue May 12 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Continued:     Many have abused this trust I have put in them, I will talk about this later.   Literally none of that paragraph was about trusting anyone. Like, actually zero percent of it.  Edit: Spoiler alert form the future, this is never brought up again.   Do you still feel like condemning me?   Yes.   I feel like telling you to get the fuck off my page   Well, I'm not on your page, so I guess that's done already.   honestly what the hell is wrong with you that you could read this heartwrenching honest story and have anything negative to say about me?   Oh dear fucking god he's a Mary Sue given physical form! The apocalypse is nigh! Repent!   t’s people like you, unable to see this issue in any other light   Unlike you, who is totally seeing this from other perspectives...   the silence culture about this issue   The who in the what now?   I am damn lucky to be here   And we are all damned unlucky. Really damned unlucky. I'm starting to think that maybe the people who believe Earth is actually Hell are right.   who could’ve blamed me if that’s what I did become   First, you did actually become one, and secondly, I blame you. Well, and the asshole who sexually abused you too, but mostly you.   I currently still see no solace in feminism for my kind   Even though you were just going on about how your ""feminist"" girlfriend showed you they were compatible. Here's the quote ""I fell in love with a beautiful feminist who convinced me of it’s wonderfulness"".   I still feel ... worthless   No, you've clearly demonstrated that you think you're very worthful. You're just trying to make people feel sorry for you. Granted, you might actually believe that you feel worthless, but that's different than actually feeling worthless.   All I see is condemnation for my kind   Yep, reasonable people are not thrilled by people who have sex with people who can't consent. No, I'm not going to let that go dude.   to build support structures for them   I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure everyone is in favor of giving therapy to people who realize they might be pedophiles. We don't want them to actually harm anyone, after all. Realizing you have a problem is good, saying that it's not actually a problem is the opposite of good.   This is pretty fucking obvious right? Like something that shouldn’t even need to be said.   What shouldn't need to be said is that statutory rape is bad. Like, if you disagree with the arbitrariness of the age (it should probably be higher IMO), then argue against that, but don't fucking fuck 15 year olds and expect people to be fine with it.   What has happened to me at the hands of feminists?   Preemptively, I'm going to predict that he'll never give examples. If by some miracle he does though, they will be so horrifically misunderstood, that he thinks they are saying something completely orthogonal to their actual point.  Edit from the future: Yep, no specific examples at all. None.   baited me out into explaining my attractions and experiences to them, screenshotted my admissions or whatever, and are now spreading these around to smear my name.   Because showing people what you actually said/wrote is slander.   Tons of people have one eighth of a story about me and from this are condemning me over it within their circles.   ""I fuck 15 year olds as an adult and insist that it's okay"" is plenty for me. I don't even need an eighth.   They are encouraging people to unfriend me and kick me out of their groups   ""Oh god! Not my Facebook friend count! Anything but that!""   decide that I am literally a rapist and xe is literally a victim    Uh... Look up the term ""statutory rape"". Since she is 15, (because let's be honest, it's a her, as you've already stated) she's not legally capable of consent. Now, sure, there's no magical switch at age 18 that means someone is capable of consent, but you're frickin' 150% of her age, you've (statistically) got a fuckton more experience than her, that's nowhere near even knowledge/power balance in that relationship.   None of these feminists have seemed interested in anything actually relevant to our relationship dynamics   Like how very little life experience she's had compared to you. They totally aren't interested in that. Wait, no, I got that backwards again.   interested in hearing my partners opinions on our relationship   Saying ""yes"" does not imply informed consent. The specific soundwaves that we interpret as affirmatives do not magically bestow knowledge on whatever produced them. Even if they were produced by a human.   For one we are both non-binary agender people, same power balance.   Uh... that's not what power balance means.   It is legal to date a teen if the parents consent where I live   So the parents are to blame too then. Okay, that doesn't make it right.   Not that this matters because to leftist activists like ourselves relationships shouldn’t purely be defined by their legality   Right, I'm not going to agree with whatever definition of ""leftist"" you have, but no one is saying that the law is why this is wrong. The law was established because people believe it's wrong, not vice versa.   everyone should have an opportunity to be seen individuals with their own story and we are being denied this opportunity every time we are so harshly condemned.   Of for the love of... Your story is terrible. That's what we're saying. Not that you magically aren't an individual. Like what the fuck even.   We’ve had threats by feminists of reporting our relationship to authorities   Gasp! People saying they'll report illegal activities! How shocking and horrifying!   a denial of xir right to self determine xir victim status   So brainwashing is okay then right? 'cause the brainwash victim doesn't think it's wrong.   and condemning me specifically to potentially prison   Oh god! Going to prison for non-consensual sex! The horror!   (which as you know is a death sentence for trans women)   [citation needed]   most likely a life on a list next to people who have actually committed rape   So people like yourself then?   and also a life without the one I love   The US (and probably every) constitution does not guarantee everyone a significant other. Shocking, I know.   Is it just me or is such a condemnation over a simple disagreeal with our relationship RIDICULOUS and disrespectful towards the one they claim to be trying to protect?!   Its just you. Profiting from someone's inexperience is bad. Even if they don't know they're inexperienced.   Decide how you feel about me now that you actually know the state of things for me   Well, I've never heard anyone say anything about you before now, so you've pretty much hoist yourself by your own petard here.   If you’re going to condemn me do it with the full story, okay?    Okay, if you insist.   can feminism embrace people like me and find a place for us to learn and grow and shine?   Excuse me. I need to take a brief intermission to throw up now.  *jeopardy theme*  Okay, I'm back. Thank you for waiting.   Be the change, for god sakes ,please.

GenderCritical,35ix4v,DoubleXMarksTheSpot,6,Sun May 10 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"Back in the 70s, MtT transsexual Renee Richards successfully sued for the right to play women's tennis.  He'd been banned from doing so, hence the lawsuit. But transsex/genderism wasn't prominently promoted in the media then, as it is now.  There have also been some Olympic athletes over the years who have been subject to sex tests.  This happened sometimes years ago because some countries had tried to slip a man in to compete in women's sports in order to cheat.  The athlete in question didn't consider themselves transgender, however.  Other athletes, such as Stella Walsh in 1936 and, more recently, Caster Semanya, turned out to be intersex.    I would hope that something is done to protect women's sports from those like the 50 year man playing women's sports, but I'm not holding my breath about it, unfortuntely."

If a boy goes through an operation prior to puberty then I don't think it would be an issue. Transition after puberty would make the trans individual not eligible to participate in female competitions (that is basically what the UFC was saying when a transgender women tried to fight Ronda Roussey)

Even if by some weird fluke I got attracted to a MtT, if I found out they were trans I'd say ""not interested mate"".  They're men and I am a lesbian.  I wouldn't date FtT either.  I think their ideology is stupid, anti-reality and cult-like.   And not wanting to date any trans people doesn't make me any more ""phobic"" than heterosexual women not dating me.

The second definition is inaccurate in that not every female has XX chromosomes; CAIS, CAH, Turner, Swyer, and other legitimate (NOT transgendered) intersex females are still females, are identified as females at birth, raised female, and experience female socialisation. The third definition is deeply flawed as it suggests our sex is determined by how our biology is 'read' by others. O_o  As an often butch-ish lesbian I've at times been 'read' as being male, but I'm all female.  --The most accurate definition of female, in my opinion, is: a person who is identified to be female at birth, is raised female, and experiences female socialisation.   2.)Should a completely passing MtF be considered a lesbian and otherwise, should a biological female attracted to a completely passing MtF be considered one? --There is no such thing as a 'completely passing' MTT.

I think ""woman"" describes the class to which people are assigned if they are perceived to be female.   However, one excellent counterpoint I've heard is that being a woman includes the experiences that come from having been perceived as female from birth.  An adult male who starts passing as female will not have had those experiences, even if people now perceive them as female consistently.   I'm not yet sure how to fold this in to my thinking.  As for the term ""lesbian,"" I think that term is most useful when it is confined to female persons who are sexually/romantically attracted to other female persons."

GenderCritical,35ef00,jiljol,1 point,Sun May 10 15:24:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I didn't want to involve intersex people of anything, I just wanted to be clear on what is meant by which terms. English is not my first language and we here don't have different words for gender and sex so it's a bit confusing to me. Sorry!"
GenderCritical,35ef00,deirdreofthegaians,2,Sun May 10 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"The thing is, words have meaning. The word woman has been around for a long time. It means and has always meant 'someone who was born with and has female parts' pretty much universally. It's a word based on biology. Everything that we associate with being a girl or a woman is cultural if it's not based on biology. Femininity is a social construct just like any other. Bleeding is not a social construct. For males, being a macho s******d is a social construct. Getting an erection is not. So I would go with option number 2 because it reflects a biological reality and not a newly constructed consensus-reality.   Sometimes it's important to respect the meanings of words because when we dilute them we can no longer be certain what it is we are talking about. Being able to say that someone is male or female and having agreement about what that means is very important for a lot of reasons from dating to medical emergencies to public (female) safety, the list goes on and on. In this instance by expanding the definition of who gets to be a girl and a woman, hard won rights and painstakingly created spaces for biological females of all ages are disappearing. They must now include and be extended to biological males who ""feel"" female, however ridiculous that may seem to those of us who have not bought into the new party line.   What is considered acceptable behavior for boys and girls has narrowed quite a bit in the last decade, to the point where the next generation of gender-non conforming children, those who do not behave stereotypically enough and who are MOST LIKELY TO BECOME GAY AND LESBIAN ADULTS, is being systematically opposite-gendered with dangerous medical procedures like puberty blockers. SCARY.   On a slightly different note, one has to wonder what it means to be ""read as someone who has [female] biology and [is] treated accordingly"". That mtts want to be ""treated like a lady"", something that a lot of real, biological females deplore, is telling of just how male their perspective really is."
GenderCritical,35ef00,jiljol,7,Sun May 10 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"Well, as a straight woman, I can say personally that if I found myself attracted to a transman who passed, and then later found out they were trans, the attraction would not still be there. I'm not attracted to pants and the color blue and an affinity for football. I'm attracted to men. If I was knowingly attracted to a woman who is passing as a man, I would not personally identify as straight."
GenderCritical,35ef00,repugnent,2,Sat May 9 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   I'm straight as well and you expressed my sentiments exactly.  And as far as ""passing"" goes, I've been mistaken as a man from time to time.  I'm about the average height of a man and on the heavyset side. But despite the DD boobs, that should be a dead giveaway, some people still get it wrong, especially when I'm in winter clothing.  I'm not really butch, but I'm not stereotypically ""feminine"", either.  I'm more the low-maintenance, no-nonsense type of straight woman: no makeup, my hair isn't styled (a single braid down the back), and I wear comfortable, practical clothing and sensible shoes.  But I'm every bit as female as the women who wear frilly pink dresses and trowel on the makeup like Tammy Faye Bakker."
GenderCritical,35ef00,jiljol,-3,Sun May 10 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from and I appreciate the input. However, it's still somewhat confusing to me because people often use woman/man when they describe attraction and I'm having trouble understanding them cause I'm still not sure what is meant by that.   You're saying the attraction would disappear when you would find out the person is a woman (I assume you mean a biological female-XX). However, I'd love it if you could articulate why? What if the person in question was classically handsome (had developed muscles, a defined jaw line etc.) and you found them attractive based on those attributes? How would the attraction just magically disappear by you learning of their chromosomal garniture? (the question conveniently ignores genitals and I totally understand why you would be turned off in case the person had different genitals than is your preference; this is more about discerning the difference between that which is physical and mental)."
GenderCritical,35ef00,repugnent,6,Sat May 9 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is, human beings (like many other species) have secondary-sex characteristics that help signal biological sex. Now obviously science has managed to artificially mimic many of these features through synthetic hormones and plastic surgery, but this in no shape or form denies one of the aforementioned purposes of said secondary-sex characteristics.  What happens is that trans activists would have us believe that we are required to be attracted to somebody if we mistakenly read them as the biological sex we are attracted to. Now stay with me for a second, but doesn't that sound ridiculous?  Imagine you were living somewhere very cold and on your way to lunch you meet somebody walking to the same place and you start having a conversation with them. The person in question is covered from head to toes in wintern clothes and their voice is mildly distorted from a scarf covering their mouth. The two of you manage to really hit it off and you really like this person, at least until you reach your destination and the two of you decide to have lunch together. Naturally, you would remove some of your clothes when going into the building, and it is then that you start noticing what the person truly looks like.  Now if we were to follow the trans activist logic of ""once you feel an attraction towards somebody, you are being transphobic if you realize/find out they're trans and then lose interest"", then no matter what this person looks like, you are 100% required to continue to feel that attraction. See how absurd this is?  Speaking as a gay man, it really would not matter to me how much someone manages to become a facsimile of a stereotypical male: bulging muscles, beard, attitude issues, etc. By virtue of being a gay man, I am attracted romantically and sexually to other males (the biological sex) and have the right to act upon said attraction without coercion or obfuscation from q*eer activists that are promoting compulsory bi/pansexuality."
GenderCritical,35ef00,jiljol,2,Sat May 9 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was very helpful and I certainly agree that any kind of coercion of someone saying you should be attracted to someone is completely wrong. I of course, would to anyone who told me I had to be attracted to a MtF tell to fuck off, but I'm still trying to be honest with myself about the way I genuinely perceive attraction.   Just out of curiosity, if one of your fellow gay friends were to start dating a (well passable) FtM, would you at least in your mind question their identity as a homosexual? We can agree that in some way, the synthetic hormones and plastic surgeries are smoke screen signals, but can you really blame a person's brain for ""falling"" for it?"

GenderCritical,35ef00,BetAle,3,Sat May 9 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question.   Personally speaking, would I consider a man who refers to himself as gay yet is involved with someone who is overwhelmingly likely to have female sex organs as ""gay""? The incredibly few ones who do not have female sex organs instead have a surgically-grafted tube sewn to their crotch made out of forearm/thigh flesh.  So, personally, no, I would not really consider that person to be gay. Before someone thinks I'm some kind of ""dying breed"" of ""bigoted gay men"": I'm 22. Many gay men will entertain the whole ""you're as much of a man as any other one out there!/there's more to a man than his parts!/etc"", but rest assured, when push comes to shove (i.e. romance and sex with a transman), they are going to step away."
GenderCritical,35ef00,MundiMori,3,Sat May 9 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"I'm also a gay man, 23 years old and I agree.  Simply put gay men like dick, and I think having a vagina would be a dealbreaker for most (I know it would be for me).  Have you seen those ftm phalloplasties though?  They barely look like dicks and they're barely functional.  For the most part they're good for just pissing and fucking.  I think they also vastly overestimate how passable most ftms are.  Yeah they mostly pass, but few are unclockable.  They tend to have feminine bodies (wide hips, narrow shoulders), and very distinct voices.  T doesn't change their faces much, when you really look at them they often just look like women with beards.  I wouldn't really fault gay men in the ""queer community"" for dating ftms.  These people fawn over transgender people and dating one is treated like a badge of honor, so theres's a lot of pressure on homosexuals to identify as pansexual or date transgender people. I do think most of these gay men come to their senses, but at the end of the day most of the people in the ""queer community"" are women, whether or not they identify as such.  Men are a small minority in these communities and these gay men can always return to the gay community.  I feel bad for young lesbians though, because it seems to me that at least in the US lesbian culture has been subsumed by queer.  If there's still a community for young lesbians they're deep in hiding."
GenderCritical,35ef00,jiljol,1 point,Sat May 9 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely there is a huge pressure to be bisexual or some variation of it (queer, pansexual, etc). The thing is that, while I am constantly seeing heterosexuals, bisexuals, queers or pansexuals pressuring us to step outside our sexual boundaries, a significant portion of the people doing the pressuring are actually fellow gay men. All you need to do is go to pretty much any popular gay site and you'll see dozens of pieces or comments written by gay men ""urging"" other gay men to stop being ""transphobic"" for not considering transmen viable partners. At the end of the day, these gay men will still go hook up with some other male or if they have a boyfriend, have dinner and sleep with said male boyfriend.  These gay men don't really care about the harm that they are doing, since it's always about furthering their own political and economic standing; ""Be on the right side of history!"". It is a very hypocritical and disheartening situation."

I think the most of the gay men I know IRL are pretty ignorant of trans politics.

GenderCritical,35ef00,pleuvoir,2,Sun May 10 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"For us lesbian and gay people, a solid foundation comes from laying things out the way they are: homosexuality is the exclusive attraction towards the same sex. If someone has this sudden ""exception"", to me, that is an obvious indication of bisexuality. I don't really see how a particular human being can be exceptional enough that a sudden attraction towards their biological sex would be impossible to repeat iself.  Heterosexual people experience no harm when somebody calls themselves heterosexual while being in a same-sex relationship or showing same-sex attraction. When somebody calls themselves lesbian or gay while being in an opposite-sex relationship or showing opposite-sex attraction, they are directly contributing to the abuse and marginalization of lesbian and gay people."

Was looking at a college friend's facebook, saw a guy who was pretty cute, looked kind of like a japanese pop idol, that very delicate sort of handsome. Turns out they were trans.  Now, do I still find them objectively attractive? Yeah, they have really nice facial structure and look damn good in a skinny tie. But am I attracted to them? No. For one, the genitalia, but let's pretend they had all the surgeries. They still can't have kids. But neither can a sterile guy, and I can still be attracted to them (my last ex was) so that's not it. They still have little things that point them out as born a woman. Delicate hands. A higher voice. Lack of body hair. And I imagine pheromones. I'm not a scientist, so I can't get make solid claims, but I imagine my nose is not as easily tricked into thinking that male-presenting woman is a man as my eyes are."

I'm not a scientist, so I can't get make solid claims, but I imagine my nose is not as easily tricked into thinking that male-presenting woman is a man as my eyes are.   See, a lot of my confusion on this topic comes from this. Basically, as far as I understand the science behind attraction, we react to people's hormones. Pheromones and scent, that inexplicable feeling of...well attraction where it feels good to be in someone's vicinity and it feels pleasant to touch their skin etc, it has to do with hormones. And hormones can be altered. Which is why I have trouble saying sexual attraction only depends on chromosomes because chromosomes can't be detected by our brains. Hormones, pheromones, physiological characteristics can.   Ignoring for a second the fact that 99,99% of trans people do not even decently pass, if you had a person who had XY chromosomes but otherwise was completely read by an innocent bystander as a female, does that mean the bystander reacted to sex or gender?"

That still doesn't explain to what it is exactly that the brain reacts? If it reacts to chromosomes, through which channels exactly? Hormones, secondary sex characteristics, etc, they all serve as indicators of biological sex but right now with our technological advances, those signals can be imitated. Do you have any proof that there are signals which cannot be imitated successfully?"
GenderCritical,35cma0,mrsgetlost,6,Sat May 9 00:43:21 2015 UTC,"I've just started reading, and I find this interesting so far, despite (or perhaps because of?) the fact that I am already disagreeing with the author a lot.  For example:   Imagine that we could create a world in which very feminine boys were not persecuted by other children and their parents allowed them to play however they wanted. Do we really think that boys with GID would have the same low rate of transsexual outcome that they do in our crueler, less tolerant world?   This would benefit from genuine feminist analysis, since it ignores why ""feminine"" behavior is persecuted in boys, and therefore misses a crucial element.  Right now we have a lot of people who are happy to protect, cherish, and encourage ""feminine"" boys...by telling them that they are actually girls and should transition.  So yes, in that sort of context, being more ""permissive"" of feminine behavior is likely to increase the number of trans sexual adults.  But that's because our current world persists in enforcing gender in the first place, and artificially coding some interests and behaviors as properly belonging to one sex or the other.  The ""permissive"" attitude still uses this framework of girls-are-X and boys-are-Y, it simply adds the option for boys to ""live as"" girls in order to maintain the frame.    Contrast this to a world that rejects the gender hierarchy entirely.    In a world where ""feminine"" behavior is as acceptable from males as it is from females, I have no doubt that the prevalence of GID would be virtually nil.  As I've commented before, ""living as"" a member of the opposite sex would not have any meaning in a world where one's sex doesn't dictate how one lives."

Or the ""feminine"" of being invisible to not disturb others, working hard to not shine, doing your best to never  take ""undue"" power (such as leading a group).  The ""feminine"" of using your health and body as a commodity you need to dispose of to achieve these objectives, even if it hurts you. The feminist ""feminine"" of educating yourself to whatever self-proclaimed knowledgeable&oppressed people tell you to do.

When it comes to research on transsexuality, this is best seen in how so many people are sure that science has proven that a trans woman has a ""female brain in a male body,"" or at least has a brain that is somehow fundamentally different from the brains of other males.  So what actually happened?    Science found that a region of the brain that is directly involved in ovulation cycles does, indeed, differ in size when you compare men and women.  Given that men do not ovulate, this is rather unsurprising.   Science also found that the size of this region will be different in males who have taken artificial feminizing hormones.

GenderCritical,34zooc,untouchedURL,6,Tue May 5 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"More thoughts on this. If one wants to have a sex-neutral courtesy title that ALL people could use, regardless of sex, that would not be confined to transfolk, my nomination would be to re-purpose the French title ""M"", (prounounced ""emm""), rather than to add a new, made-up title.  We have too many titles now, as it is.  Forty-five years ago or so, the challenge was to have a title for all adult women that did not indicate her marital status.  Two solutions were implemented at that time:  In English-speaking countries, a third title, ""Ms"", was introduced, with the intention that it would replace ""Mrs"" and ""Miss"".  But it hasn't quite worked out as well as intended.  ""Mrs"" is as strong as ever, though the use of ""Miss"" has greatly decreased for adult women past college age and is mostly reserved for girls under 18 and the very elderly.  But Ms seems to be the new Miss; it's mostly single and divorced women who use it, with only a minority of married women who do.  The upshot of all this is that instead of having just one title for women, instead of two, we now have three, and it's still just one for all men, business as usual.  We still have to ask a woman what she prefers, unlike with men, where there's only one choice.  At the same time that English added a third title, the Germans instead decided to re-purpose their already-existing titles of ""Frau"" and ""Fraulein"".   Since 1972, Frau has been used for all adult women, instead of just for married women, and Fraulein, is now used only for girls under 18.  It's worked well in Germany for over 40 years, and there has been far less resistance to this re-purposing of titles than the adding of Ms In English, because they're terms people were already familiar with.  Similarly, France followed the German pattern when they re-purposed Madame and Mademoiselle in 2012."

I hear the autogynephilia-causative theory of mtf transsexuality all the time...

GenderCritical,34x490,Reddwollff,3,Tue May 5 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"Isn't autogynephilia pretty simple though and easily understood by the person being aroused by the idea of being a women, with the primary manifestation of fetishistic cross-dressing. I think maybe the confusion is that the term, which is descriptive of the psychological process and behaviours involved is being confused with possible causes which the theory doesn't really attempt to describe. So it's more about sorting out types and motivations.    One abstract I saw while doing a bit of reading (by Lawrence) described autogynephilia as an unusual form of paraphilia where males desire to impersonate or copy persons or things to which they are attracted called ""erotic target identity inversions"". So the idea of that the typical sexualisation/objectification of women feeding into this isn't out there as a causative factor, and it's certainly true that in women it's rare for them to engage in any paraphilia, let alone cross-dressing, which supports that. It is just that the theory doesn't really delve in causes, just tries to explain the phenomenon."
GenderCritical,34x490,deirdreofthegaians,1 point,Tue May 5 21:43:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing against the existence of autogynephilia, just the theory of it being a causative factor in transsexuality.  As for the erotic location target error papers, even those connections are shaky. The paper that Lawrence claims connects other body dysmorphics (amputation fetishists, etc) to transsexuals seemed a little weird, so I contacted the other researchers involved and they said that they sourced all of the participants from an LGBT forum. Lawrence conveniently left this out when writing the paper.  It feels like everyone has an agenda to push. Both people on the brain sex side and people on the autogynephilia side are using plain old badly-constructed experiments at best and intentionally fudging statistics at worst. There's no solid science behind either perspective on transsexuality, so I'm just arguing that it's equally irresponsible to buy into either.  Thank you for being so civil. It seems a lot of people have jumped down my throat and automatically assumed I'm up to some sort of shenanigans. I'm not. I just want to have a dialogue about this as a radical feminist with other radical feminists. Talking stuff out is an important part of activism. Have an upvote for your kindness :)"
GenderCritical,34x490,deirdreofthegaians,3,Tue May 5 13:41:03 2015 UTC,"I agree much brain science is flawed, but the flaw there is that they show what we have a human brains, same structure is there for everyone but look at very tiny changes like more neurons on average in one specific area in the brain and then extrapolate that into behaviour, often falling into sex based stereotypes with that. There is a big yawning gap there with that. With this research, it is rather different as it is looking at observations of behaviours and characteristics of groups of individuals and then extrapolating from that data and forming theories about those types they see. This is rather more solid and empirical despite having to rely on self-reporting and unless grossly misrepresenting the papers concerned I think you can take it as being rather more valid and more likely to reflect the reality of that group.  It is certainly valid to question this though, and look into it more. It can only help with understanding.   One paper here: http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Bailey/BIID/Lawrence%20article%20-%20June%202006.pdf  In this, Lawrence does say:    Recently, First (2005) used semistructured telephone interviews to survey 52 persons who had expressed a wish to become an amputee or who had succeeded in doing so. About two thirds of participants were recruited from Internet discussion groups and about one third from referrals by other participants.   So this was covered in reviewing the research in this particular paper (Lawrence herself doesn't appear to have done original research herself into this area) and again it's about typology to my mind, not causation. Like with autogynephilia research looking at homosexual and non-homosexual groups and looking to delineate similarities and differences which does point to some distinct differences between types. It's not surprising that you could do the same thing with another paraphilia (and the finding is the similarity is more striking in non-homosexual autogynephilia) and gain more support for the theory that way.   In another paper - http://www.annelawrence.com/autogynephilia,_a_paraphilic_model_of_GID.pdf there is a section on prevalence which doesn't describe paper methods of data collection, but this section is reviewing results and it is stated in the introductory sentences that the data is limited in respect of those reporting history of or current autogynephilic arousal which in most papers would be sufficient as a disclaimer.   Actually sourcing specific participants in social sciences research is often done via networking with the community involved, they can do this other ways of course but then you place other limitations - like only looking at a singular group which then might not reflect very well the whole population much like when they do cheapie studies in US universities selecting from only that student population or having difficulty finding any participants at all due to that the condition is relatively rare and they'd need to canvass a lot of psych clinics to find anyone.    This limitation is there, but can sometimes lead to a more robust study population as the people that participate can come from more diverse backgrounds."
GenderCritical,34x490,deirdreofthegaians,0,Tue May 5 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"OK, I need to explain exactly what I mean here.  This statement   Recently, First (2005) used semistructured telephone interviews to survey 52 persons who had expressed a wish to become an amputee or who had succeeded in doing so. About two thirds of participants were recruited from Internet discussion groups and about one third from referrals by other participants.   Is misleading. Some of the internet discussion groups First recruited from were LGBT discussion groups, not amputation fetishism discussion groups. In addition, the referred members were referred by a referrer, and this referrer (who I got in contact with) was actually an LGBT advocate and sourced his referrals from his own LGBT community. Lawrence misrepresents First's study and makes it seem like the study was sourced from amputee fetishism groups and that wow, these groups are just teeming with transsexuals, therefore confirming Lawrence's beliefs on autogynephilia, leaving out (Perhaps intentionally) that it was actually sourced partially from trans and LGBT support groups, and that First himself actually stated (and reiterated when I talked to him personally) that the level of transsexual and homosexual responses was likely inflated by this fact.  As a sort of TL;DR  First's studies were sourced from online LGBT support groups, not BIID support groups, so the statistics regarding the number of transsexuals that responded are completely invalidated because this study was in part essentially recruited for by going to the LGBT community and asking if anyone had amputation fetishism. Because of this method of selection, it's essentially guaranteed that a huge volume of people who respond will be trans, because it's in part a forum FOR TRANS PEOPLE.  The mistake is not First's. He's very forthcoming about the flaws in his study and seems like a nice guy. My problem is more with Lawrence's misunderstanding/misattribution making it seem like more of a sure deal than it is.  I'm going to go through and thoroughly address the bad methodology in all of this research--both research that ""brain sex"" advocates cite AND Blanchard typology advocates cite, but that's not something I can post today, because I'm not done yet."
GenderCritical,34x490,deirdreofthegaians,2,Wed May 6 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"If you go to the LGBT community and ask who has amputee fetishism, you'd expect (if these things weren't linked at all) to see several times more gay and lesbian people have these amputee fetishes than trans people, because those groups have more LGB than T.  Your idea that this is a fatal flaw to methodology rests on the idea that you can't tell anything from the fact that there's a huge spike in prevalence among the T population but not the LGB.  So you're basically just full of shit."
GenderCritical,34x490,deirdreofthegaians,1 point,Wed May 6 04:36:14 2015 UTC,"In First's paper, only a couple of the respondents have cross-sex feelings. About as many as you'd expect would exist on a discussion group like this. Lawrence misrepresents the information."

See, it sounds to me like you're actually trumpeting the trans party line on Blanchard and Lawrence, that you're probably bringing up talking points from trans blogs that have been explicitly devoted to discrediting them.  And you're then not being very explicit about the specific methodological issues, keeping it all as close to the vest as possible, because you don't want to link us to the actual trans talking points on this study and give the game away, trans troll."

If you're really the person you say you are, just asking questions, and you really know a lot about this topic, you should be able to do the same kind of takedown for Nuttbrock.  Or are you just digging your information from trans anti-Lawrence, anti-Blanchard sites?"
GenderCritical,34x490,theowlgoeshoot,0,Wed May 6 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Nuttbrock's study is a relatively straightforward study and I don't think it it really proves or disproves the autogynephilic typology. I'm not sure why any trans activists would find this of value because it doesn't really validate brain sex theory either.  In essence, the study concludes that older transsexuals are more autogynephilic than younger ones, and that autogynephilia differs in presentation and severity across race and class lines and isn't as correlated with sexuality as Blanchard thought. The study itself doesn't really say much else, not counting the discussion.  This would seem to be a crippling blow to Blanchard's typology, but it really isn't. All it shows is that transsexual feelings are not necessarily sexual. They can be other kinds of psychological too! Perhaps from some sort of childhood trauma or development of PTSD or just sort of a non-sexual obsession with becoming the opposite sex. I guess Blanchard's typology proper is a tiny bit shaken because it's primarily a sexual typology, but it doesn't allude to the correctness of brain sex theory at all. At best, it suggests that there are holes in Blanchard's typology that could be patched by the addition of possible non-paraphilic types (that are traumatic or obsessive in origin). This could be remedied by simply adding more types to the typology and the typology would be strengthened and much more likely to be true with the addition of these types. Perhaps a three or four-type typology is in order. A multi-cause theory of transsexuality seems most likely."

If the sea lion is anyone, the sea lion in this discussion is you, not me. I'm not the one following you around and replying to all of your replies telling you how wrong you are without backing it up. That's what you're doing, because you're intent on believing that I somehow don't belong here or are some kind of outside party infringing on this space, even though I've proven multiple times that I don't have a bias towards trans theory, including just now. If my workup on the paper is wrong, it's only because I'm wrong about the details of the paper or interpreted them badly. That's not in indicator that I'm somehow secretly this conniving trans troll. All me being wrong is indicative of, if it's true, is that I was sloppy in my review of the paper.  But I don't blame you for being a skeptic.

And as far as I can tell First themselves did not either, saying merely the group was comprised of individuals that ""self-identified as having had a desire to have an amputation."" A true criticism would be because this is self-report, it could be that some people in there wouldn't meet clinical diagnosis criteria for the condition or possibly had other related conditions and I see looking at other reports, that this is raised as a possibility.  Seem to have conflated things there. First dealt with BIID and along with this a related syndrome of apotemnophilia, with about 67% reporting this as a motivator. What Lawrence is writing about is parallels between BIID as an identity disorder, similar to gender identity disorder and uses more papers than that one in surveying the situation. Unfortunately, it seems to be you that is mixing in together what are treated as two separate groups in both papers and extrapolating from there."

GenderCritical,34x490,voi_che_sapete,6,Thu May 7 07:07:48 2015 UTC,"I can see what you're saying, but I disagree. I am wondering which studies you're referring to exactly.  Of the accounts from autogynephiles that I've read, they all admit to being sexually aroused by feminine objects from a young age. They don't even consider transitioning until they're older and are already very involved in their fetish. The fetish itself leads to a desire to transition:   I’ve always been turned on sexually by the idea of having a woman’s body. Finally my compulsion drove me to have an orchiectomy, which was perhaps the greatest thrill of my life. A girlfriend who is a medical student came with me to the procedure. I can’t tell you how thrilled and amazed I was when my testicles were removed and the process was described by my friend. It was sort of the ultimate forced feminization.   (from Men Trapped in Men's Bodies, which I'm currently reading)  They don't tend to associate with women much at all while growing up and lead otherwise typical male lives (besides their fetish) up until deciding to transition. And the transition process is very much a part of the fetish.   If someone considers themselves female and was raised to sexualize females, they'd sexualize themselves. It's more likely that autogynephilia is a result of transsexuality interacting with male socialization and not a root cause of the condition.   Do most autogynephiles consider themselves female before deciding to transition? They seem to be fine considering themselves as men. Fantasizing about being female is not the same as believing oneself to be female.   It's based on a bunch of tests that show that mtf transsexuals who are attracted to women tend to sexualize themselves   This is not what they show at all. 'Sexualize themselves'? They aren't 'sexualizing themselves'. They're sexualizing feminine objects and female-associated behaviors. These things become their fetish objects. Fantasizing about having a female body that they're well aware they don't have is the fetish. That's not sexualizing themselves.   Edit: But I'll note what others have noted. Most studies of autogynephilia are merely describing the existing phenomena and making note of the autogynephile's history. Which typically starts with a fetish rather than any sort of 'female identity'. I don't know if any of the studies claim that autogynephilia does or doesn't cause transexualism. My personal opinion is that it does."
GenderCritical,34x490,needs_moarsalt,0,Wed May 6 19:17:31 2015 UTC,"I am aware that autogynephilics exist, I'm just saying that scientific evidence that they make up any great number of transsexual men or that the fetish and general desire to transition are inexorably linked even in straight men is based on science with faulty methodology.  Perhaps I got the description of how autogynephilia works wrong, and I will admit that, but that doesn't really infringe on my base point here."
GenderCritical,34x490,BabeOfBlasphemy,10,Tue May 5 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"If you want to convince me that these studies are bad you're going to have to do something besides repeat your belief that they have faulty methodology. Please point to one of the studies and break down what you think is wrong.  I know you're not denying autogynephilia. I was mentioning them because it seemed like you believed there was something else driving their desire to transition, and the sexual arousal was secondary. But in order for me to believe that the sexual fantasies of being female came after the desire to be a woman, I would expect to see some sort of 'female identification' from these men before they began having these fantasies. And typically, they don't. They lead otherwise average straight male lives.   I do think autogynephiles make up a large portion of the community, and almost the majority of the straight males within it. Not just because of those studies but because of what I've seen of the trans community. Nearly every day on r/asktransgender you find people wondering if they're 'really trans' or if they just have a fetish, with 'trans lesbians' in the comments assuring them that their sexual fantasies are normal and just like their own transition stories.  I have good reason to believe autogynephiles make up a large portion of the community. Maybe time will tell and I'll be wrong. Until then I don't feel any need to change my opinion."

GenderCritical,34x490,mrsgetlost,5,Wed May 6 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"Sooooooo basically you're saying that you are just SURE the science is faulty for totally unexplained methodological reasons, but you won't explain why, and you also won't explain what you think is a reasonable alternative.  It seems like you're a troll who is here to occupy a lot of female time and brain space while saying you're ""just asking questions"" and ""I'm a radical feminist, guys, really.""  There've been very few scientific studies on heterosexual MTFs (aka transbians), but none of those studies has come out against autogynephilia as a hypothesis to my knowledge.  Moreover, the single biggest ""anti"" on Blanchard's theory was an autogynephilic transgender male who liked to show video of himself in women's clothing masturbating to his college classes.  That's the man who wants to tell us that autogynephilia is nonsense.  So when you--supposedly a woman--come into a feminist space and the literal only things you do are say ""you're wrong"" and ""here's the thing I've always thought about this"" and ""shouldn't you trust your brain and reading less when you look at these men, based on unspecified methodological issues with this theory?"", I start doubting a lot of things.

The alpha thinks the other male silverback gorillas that presents female, always makes a better female gorilla, than actual female gorillas, so they are choose first for mating.   Female gorillas are always jealous of male gorillas that make better female gorillas.   They always put first the male silverback presenting female- his need's before the actual lady-gorillas...because male gorillas that present female, do it better than female gorillas. You can tell by look.  'Female' is something a man does, there are no real females.  and biology is wrong and made up because of all the trans animals that present as other animals and even birds that present as cats are accepted as cats to non trans phobic piss gendered cats.....unless you have a smurf-cat that eats trans mice and trans birds trying to identify as cats..   They are no male lead primates, or male-run societies. Women, that don't really exist, control everything with sex. There are no situations where the larger males control everything through might makes right. There are thousand s of genders in silverbacks, cats and other primates which dispute the existence of females giving birth to the members of any species they belong to. and prove that females are dreams and thoughts that males have, wear, and jack-off to and not actually other living beings.   Yes, it is not a fetish. Gender roles in primates are all by choice, and they switch gender-roles all the time.   Gender inequality doesnt exist either in the gorilla world. Lady gorillas, and male gorillas that present as female are just as respected by the alpha male silver backs, and the alpha males open doors and stuff for the gorillas- presenting as-females. It is not based on biology at all.  Female gorillas are respected for raising the male gorillas' offspring, and not treated like things the males fight over at all.  Male gorillas turn into females gorillas all the time."

One example of this is how many people will lost their shit when a straight woman doesn't change her name when she gets married.

Not to be a woman, because plenty of women who have experienced genital mutilation, corrective rape, discrimination and harassment already know what it means to BE a woman. But what does it mean to feel like a woman, especially to somebody who has reaped the benefits of not being a woman for most of their life?  And yet we are all just going to sit back and twiddle our thumbs as so many of our oppressors (an astonishing number of whom have been previously involved in violence against women) enter into safe spaces for women and redirect conversations to benefit themselves and their egos.

GenderCritical,34l0ia,Eclectic58,3,Sat May 2 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this link.  I think the growing trend in the media to use the words gender and sex as if they were interchangeable, even when not talking specifically about transgenderism, is part of this tendency toward obfuscation, getting people confused to the point where they no longer know the difference between sex and gender and, in the case of young people, they have no idea in the first place that the two words have distinct meanings.  It also trains people to accept the Orwellian ideas of transgenderism uncritically when they cannot distinguish between sex and gender."
GenderCritical,34l0ia,wanderingwomb,3,Sat May 2 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"I still hold that it's much more childish and simplistic than that: the word sex is dirty, so people started to use ""gender"" in its place. Even before gender identity politics were a huge thing. Because it basically meant the same thing, right? The theory behind the word wasn't known to the average person.  In fact I wonder if it had a small hand in developing modern gender identity politics."
GenderCritical,34l0ia,Eclectic58,2,Sat May 2 13:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was undoubtedly a factor, too, I'm sure. I'm old enough to remember when ""gender"" was rarely used, other than talking about grammatical gender and I've seen the increasing use of the word over the years and I think it started out just as you said.  I remember one of the first widespread uses of the word in  mainstream media was talking about the ""gender gap"" in the pay of men and women in the 1980 elections.  But, still, at that time, they'd didn't talk about a person's gender to mean if they were male or female and you never saw it on forms where they wanted to know your sex.  It happened little by little, but I think it's only been since the turn of the century or so, since it's been consisently used when the word sex is meant.  Trans activists, however, have no doubt sped up the process.  When I was a young woman, they talked about ""sex discrimination"" and ""equality of the sexes"".  Now, all I hear is ""gender discrimination"" and ""gender equality"".  No!  It's not discrmination because one is insufficiently masculine or feminine (although that can occur), it's discrimination for being female or male.  Similarly, it's not equality of femininity and masculinity, it's equality between men and women.  I'm even hearing some people now referring to ""same-gender marriage"", though ""same-sex marriage"" is still predominant.  I think I will cry if they ever change the word ""sex"" in the Equal Rights Amendment to ""gender"".  It should be left alone, just as Alice Paul wrote it."

Just like with ""gender roles"".   ""Gender"", in theory, has always meant societal factors of sex. How people are treated, what's expected of them, what behaviors are considered appropriate for them based on whether they're male or female. That is always what gender has meant. The gender identity crowd is merely trying to redefine the word.   I'm even hearing some people now referring to ""same-gender marriage"", though ""same-sex marriage"" is still predominant.   Yeah that is some bullshit. A man who ""identifies"" as a woman and a woman could always get legally married.

But, as you said, using gender roles, to mean the roles themselves as relating to stereotypical masculinity and femininity is correct, too.  And back in the day, it was ""women's studies"", not ""gender studies"".  I took my very first women's studies class in 1975-76, in my senior year of high school, the first year my school offered the class."

GenderCritical,34l0ia,Eclectic58,3,Sat May 2 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"You're my son's generation, then (He was born in 1981).  I went to one of my book shelves and pulled out one title ""Psychology and Sex Roles: an Androgynous Perspective""(1980) by Alexandra G Kaplan and Mary Anne Sedney.   On the back, it says there's another book by Kaplan called ""Beyond Sex-Role Stereotypes: Readings Toward a Psychology of Androgyny"".  What they mean by ""androgyny"" here is ""gender-neutral"".  I find the term ""androgyny"" here to be problematical, as it still links personality traits to one's sex, even though it is saying to pick from both stereotypes.  ""Gender neutral"" is somewhat better, but not quite right (to me).  I kind of like the term ""Gender-free"" better myself, as it more clearly expresses the idea that personality and personal style is not inherently linked to one's sex.  Oh, and I still see some gender critical feminists use the term ""sex role"" on some gender critical blogs from time to time.  There's also the scholarly journal, ""Sex Roles: A Journal of Research"", that puts out new issues from time to time. It's been around since 1975 and I remember reading them in college.  Apparently still publishing.  Here's a link to it. http://www.springer.com/psychology/personality+%26+social+psychology/journal/11199  Here's another link about it.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Roles_%28journal%29  As to when the term changed from ""sex roles"" to ""gender roles"", I'd say it followed a similar pattern I mentioned above - so probably some time in the early 90s, I'd guess."
GenderCritical,34l0ia,Eclectic58,3,Sat May 2 21:50:29 2015 UTC,"Continuing with more thoughts about Androgyny > Gender-neutral > gender-free.  Back in the late 70s and early 80s there was ""non-sexist child raising"", which came along at just the right time when I was raising my son.  ""Free to Be You and Me"", along with several other books about non-sexist childraising were published then, with Letty Cottin Pogrebin's ""Growing Up Free: Raising Your Child in the 80s"" being the best of the bunch, along with Free to Be You and Me.  Recently, I went to Amazon to check for books on non-sexist child raising and found out that they're calling it ""gender-neutral parenting"" now.  But I strongly suspect that there is a a difference between non-sexist child raising and gender-neutral parenting.   I read some sample pages from one recent gender-neutral parenting book and found out I was right - at least about that one book.  In a nutshell, non-sexist child raising was gender critical, its goal was to raise kids without gender roles and stressed that personality traits, interests, personal style, etc was not linked to a child's sex.  Kids were free to be themselves without regard to stereotypes.  Gender-neutral parenting, on the other hand, while using some of the same ideas from non-sexist child raising, seems to have taken the message of ""you can be any gender you want to be"" - instead of stressing individual personality unlinked to one's sex, it's about gender-identity now.  Sigh.  Has anyone here read any of the current ""gender-neutral parenting"" books and could tell me if my perceptions are correct?"

GenderCritical,34l0ia,Sojourner_Truth,3,Sat May 2 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"I just saw the quote like, a day ago. Might have been here. I'll see if I can find it.  edit: Ah ha, here it is. In the Intro.   The term ‘gender’ itself is problematic. It was fi rst used in a sense that was not simply about grammar by sexologists – the scientists of sex such as John Money in the 1950s and 1960s – who were involved in normalising intersex infants. They used the term to mean the behavioural characteristics they considered most appropriate for persons of one or other biological sex. They applied the concept of gender when deciding upon the sex category into which those infants who did not have clear physical indications of one biological sex or another should be placed (Hausman, 1995 ). Their purpose was not progressive. These were conservative men who believed that there should be clear differences between the sexes and sought to create distinct sex categories through their projects of social engineering. Unfortunately, the term was adopted by some feminist theorists in the 1970s, and by the late 1970s was commonly used in academic feminism to indicate the difference between biological sex and those characteristics that derived from politics and not biology, which they called ‘gender’ (Haig, 2004 ).  Before the term ‘gender’ was adopted, the term more usually used to describe these socially constructed characteristics was ‘sex roles’. The word ‘role’ connotes a social construction and was not susceptible to the degeneration that has afflicted the term ‘gender’ and enabled it to be wielded so effectively by transgender activists. As the term ‘gender’ was adopted more extensively by feminists, its meaning was transformed to mean not just the socially constructed behaviour associated with biological sex, but the system of male power and women’s subordination itself, which became known as the ‘gender hierarchy’ or ‘gender order’ (Connell, 2005 ; Mackinnon, 1989 ). Gradually, older terms to describe this system, such as male domination, sex class and sex caste went out of fashion, with the effect that direct identification of the agents responsible for the subordination of women – men – could no longer be named. Gender, as a euphemism, disappeared men as agents in male violence against women, which is now commonly referred to as ‘gender violence’. Increasingly, the term ‘gender’ is used, in official forms and legislation, for instance, to stand in for the term ‘sex’ as if ‘gender’ itself is biological, and this usage has overwhelmed the feminist understanding of gender."
GenderCritical,34hs6j,Mitsubachijigoku,18,Fri May 1 07:04:28 2015 UTC,"I want to add this because no one's brought it up. The issue with restrooms is that there is no obvious way to tell the difference between a well meaning transwoman who cant pass and a man in dress who is a predator. Sure, let's just say that no transwoman would assault or pray on a woman. That doesn't mean that a woman knows the difference between these two people upfront. Often trans activists tell woman we can't have boundaries or tell someone if we suspect something is wrong, because that man in a dress is surely an innocent transwoman and not a creepy predator."
GenderCritical,34hs6j,a_socialist_feminist,3,Fri May 1 14:06:46 2015 UTC,"That sounds like really solid answer. The only problem I see is with a trans woman feeling like she could be harassed in a the men's room. In that case using the family room is, unfortunately, probably the best solution, with the less than perfect alternative of braving the men's room when no solo room is available. Basically there is no way to make everyone happy and comfortable, and that's a fact that is usually avoided in these discussions."
GenderCritical,34hs6j,thrwpllw,8,Fri May 1 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"A point that always bothers me is that if transwomen are worried about being harassed (by males) in the men's room, then you'd think they would be equally motivated to keep predatory males out of the women's room.

GenderCritical,34hs6j,itazurakko,13,Sat May 2 06:03:23 2015 UTC,"The real question is, why does it need to be squared at all?  Use the restroom where you're going to cause the fewest problems.  Problem solved... unless you think people OWE trans people recognition of their identity."
GenderCritical,34hs6j,needs_moarsalt,9,Sat May 2 06:06:29 2015 UTC,"Well, for one this is really an issue for transwomen who don't pass. Ones that do pass can go without any issue.  I think the solution is to have unisex (the single room kind), male, and female bathrooms. Transwomen who don't pass can use the unisex restroom and women can report suspicious behavior in their restroom. Another possibility is to go back to the days of bathroom attendants.   How do we square, ""yes, I will deal with you up until the point where you make me uncomfortable""?   This is a matter of social context. Transwomen have a right to public space, but not to female-only spaces. What I mean by this is that a transwomen should be treated like everyone else in a context that include both sexes, but respect that the female sex may want a space for us to discuss life as female or for privacy.  For example, I've attended conferences for women before that invite women and men. I've met transwomen at these conferences and they are fine there, because the conference is about women's issues and everyone is invited. However, if women decide to start a separate conference, they should be able to define it as female-only, because there are issues that women experience that transwomen do not. (Like abortion, miscarriage, etc)  There are so few spaces that are for women only that this boundary should be respected, especially when it is privately funded."

That's the elephant in the room that no one ever wants to address.  Meanwhile, where is the activism to pressure men to NOT beat up on gender non-conforming males in the men's room? I'd be happy to join in on such activism but all we ever see are demands for those gender non-conforming males (and let's be honest, they're not passing, the average observer can TELL the sex is male completely regardless of anyone's ""identity"") to be allowed into the women's room.  People insist that once they ""identify as women"" that for psychological and identity validation reasons they should be allowed into female space. Sorry but that's not what the separate sexed bathrooms are about.  Happily more and more places are putting in ""family bathrooms"" - single lockable rooms, spacious with one toilet and a sink. These are great for all kinds of reasons, you can safely take another person in with you, there's room to change clothes, there's room for keeping your luggage behind a lock when travelling alone, etc.  But now in 2015 we're hearing how these bathrooms, which are 100% safely lockable for everyone, are ""transphobic."" Why? Because they deny the precious ""validation"" that some M2T individuals are seeking by being allowed to use the women's room (and be seen coming out of it).  That's not about safety at all. If the issue is truly ""a safe place to pee"" as we've been told endlessly that it is, the family bathroom should be fine."

They even included a crossdressing submissive that asks women to pee on him. This makes it men's sexual access activism."

So then ftms who do pass as men shouldn't use the women's restroom, because one can't distinguish between them and male predators either.  Same logic applies.  I thought other the posters here made it pretty clear that it has less to do with whether they're trans and more to do with whether they pass.  I mean it's not like you see the genitalia of other people in the bathroom, but you do see their secondary sexual characteristics, and the plain truth is you can't alter those 100%.  No one here mentioned ftms, that's true, but I don't understand why you or the original poster are treating that hypothetical about ftms as some sort of trump card.

I suggested /debateradicalfeminism (which doesn't exist) because in reddit culture there is a tendency for the discussion subs about political topics to be more insular and more about sharing information than presenting it.

GenderCritical,34hs6j,Eclectic58,10,Sat May 2 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself, not anyone here and not radical feminism in general.   Do you believe that an abolition of gender would also eliminate the phenomenon of trans-hood? If there emerged individuals who experienced physical discomfort surrounding their physical sex, how would such a society deal with them?   Yes. The phenomenon would cease to exist, because there would be nothing to transition to or from. Your genitals should not prescribe any expectations on your behavior. There might still be edge cases where people experience physical body dysphoria, and surgery might be a better option than therapy for these folks. In a hypothetical post-gender world, genital surgery might be treated the same way as any other request for something like elective amputation. Therapy first, surgery as a last resort. Personally I don't care, cut yourself up if you want. But I believe most trans folks experience their symptoms in reaction to a society with rigid gender roles. We see this time and time again in articles about parents of transgender children. Billy wants to play with dolls and wear dresses. He's told that those are for girls and boys can't do those things. Billy then decides he's a girl.   Note that this should not be construed as ""erasing"" trans identity. In my utopian vision of the future I want society to be organized in a socialist manner with worker ownership of production. There wouldn't be any unions in that world, because they wouldn't need to organize against the capitalist class (which would no longer exist). Does that mean socialism is anti-union?   As someone with little stake in the bathroom question (use the men's bathroom all you want, idgaf), I'm declining to answer the second question.   Finally (and slightly unrelated) how do you answer idea that gender is a cultural response to physical sex and is as natural as any other anthropological phenomenon?   Well, I'd take issue with many parts of that statement. Firstly, is it inevitable? We agree that reproductive capability is the basis of women's oppression (I would hope we agree), but if we run this human experiment a thousand times, would it be so every time? I don't know. Maybe anthropologists have weighed in on this.  Secondly, so what if it is a ""cultural response to physical sex""? The patriarchy is a cultural response to women's reproductive capabilities. Rape is a cultural response to men not valuing women as human beings. Culture is not some sacrosanct institution that should be preserved at all costs.   Thirdly, ""as natural as any other phenomenon?"" Natural, hmm. Cancer is natural, but we still fight it. Defenders of slavery in the 1800s argued that the negro's ""natural"" predisposition was that of servitude to the white man. Misogynists to this day claim that a woman's natural place is in a position of subordination to a man.   I don't really give a fuck about things being considered ""natural"". In the context of human rights- and the gender question is most definitely one concerning human rights- ""natural"" is almost always a signifier that someone is really just defending the status quo. Even with honest intentions and good faith arguments, ""natural"" being valued over all is fallacious."

People are surgically altering their body to conform to cisgender norms, what could be more emblematic of cissexism than that?  I guess ""genital reconstruction surgery"" offends me less because it's still descriptive, but it comes from this strain of trans rhetoric which denies the existence of sex.  They don't deny the existence of genitalia, or gametes, or other sexually dimorphic features, just that people can be called male or female.  Which is utter madness, because male and female have objective definitions that are not dependent on society; even if we all decided to stop calling people male or female (good luck with that), it wouldn't change the fact that people are.

I'm not saying people with abnormal reproductive systems aren't women or aren't human. I don't doubt that your uterus is female ""enough"" at all. The whole point I am trying to get at is that the classical biological descriptions of male vs. female are not at all sufficient to describe humanity, and we ought to accept some categorization system that is faithful to things as they really are. I would not consider a woman without a uterus to be less of a woman than anyone else but if we define her womanhood by how 'adapted' her body is to certain actions then that seems like the unfortunate result we get to.   I don't see how bringing up the existence of women with atypical reproductive systems alienates them from anything or how it is misogynistic. I think it's preferable to bring them up because they are women and they deserve the same regard as other women when we're trying to figure out what women are really like.   But I was born with two eyes- or for people with some kind of birth defect, they were born with a facial structure and internal nervous structure that would support the existence of two eyes.   Many people with atypical biological structures would not appreciate being called defective.

It's based on a bunch of tests that show that mtf transsexuals who are attracted to women tend to sexualize themselves. From this overly broad data, the researchers jump immediately to the conclusion that it's causative, but that's actually not the most likely explanation of the data.  The most likely explanation of the data is that people who grow up straight and male are socialized to sexualize and objectify women, and nothing says that that objectification stops at other people. If someone considers themselves female and was raised to sexualize females, they'd sexualize themselves. It's more likely that autogynephilia is an effect of transsexuality interacting with male socialization and not a root cause.  It's just bad science. I hear the autogynephilia-causative theory of mtf transsexuality all the time in radical feminism and it always irks me, because an interaction with male socialization makes more sense from a gencrit perspective."

Either the whole idea of beauty pageants etc goes away as men don't find them titillating anymore. If plastic surgery altered males compete, then women could see how ridiculous it is that male body shapes are heralded as attractive ""female"" forms and don't bother.

Androgynous men on fashion shows usually have zero curves (which is normal, young men have little fat), even less than their female counterparts who are already selected for their long and thin bodies.  So it's basically promoting the self-hatred of women who transition to all women in general.

But I'll add, adults can live in whatever fantasy world they want to live in, even mutilate their bodies and pump it full of cross-sex hormones not intended for their sex; there's not much we can do to stop them.  But I draw the line at kids. Parents aren't allowed to let their kids get married, go live on their own, drink, smoke or consent to sex - so why in the fresh hell are they allowed to sterilize their kids with healthy bodies?  Leave the kids alone to live with bodily integrity and quit coaching them to claim they're ""transgender"", when they're really just tomboys (for lack of a better term) and sensitive boys?  And though they're free to live in their fantasy worlds, they also shouldn't try to drag the rest of us in there too and to try to re-define the world with their Orwellian use of the language.  Unlike one's sexual orientation, which doesn't affect the lives of others and their right to do differently, transgenderism does intrude on the rights of the rest of us living in reality to have single-sex rest rooms, prisons, sports teams, and the like.  Hell, I can't even indicated my sex on Facebook - I have to have a ""gender"".   Live out your fantasies all you want, but leave our children, our language, and single-sex spaces alone."

Even holding the child in stasis, aborting normal development in adolescence is problematic, I can't see how the child could call halt on that having been driven towards it for so many years.   Clearly the child has no idea really of the implications of this, but mother knows best. It's a scary thing, especially combined with that a actual female, a woman, would be exploited as a carrier to do what he could never do, ever, even before any attempts to medicalise him.

I haven't heard yet of parents of toddlers demanding that their child be referred to as ""they"" or demanding that they cease being classified as a girl or a boy in schools, or demanding that their child be allowed to use restrooms based on whether they feel like a boy or girl on a particular day. Could it be that having a ""genderqueer"" child isn't as direct a route to extreme medical interventions -- the real goal of parents with Munchausen's by proxy?

GenderCritical,343ap7,MundiMori,3,Tue Apr 28 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting, it does correlate well but does it measure what you are intending to measure?   There are two separate issues there within CS, one being women being pressured away from considering degrees in areas like CS, or if they do they find a hostile environment both in education and/or the workplace that means they may not carry on with their choice of career. The other is the replacement of women with men that claim they are women and who then falsely inflate the numbers of women in CS and give the impression the problem of gender disparity is being fixed, but I think this tends to happen later from my observations, once that person's career is established. So you may be looking at something else again, but still intriguing to see that almost perfect fit.   This is also one narrow measure, it would be great to play around with that with other areas (like bathroom bills?) and see if there is any correlation, even though there are more factors than that could be considered as not all get SRS and that tends to be later in life, but as a more many will use hormones for example much earlier."

There are a fair few other detransitioned/ing women blogging on tumblr who you can find through their blogs too.  Honestly there are not a lot of therapists out there who won't hear ""gender issues"" and push you straight towards transitioning. I've never been on T but as a butch woman with serious gender dysphoria issues I've found it really hard to bring things up with any medical professionals and get them to believe that I don't actually want to transition. This is partly because it's basically untenable to have a practice focused on gender stuff and not toe the party line on transition. You may find it easier with a therapist whose speciality lies elsewhere, although it might involve a lot of work on your part to help them understand where you're coming from.  In any case, best wishes for the road ahead of you- it's tough but you're not alone <3"

As I spoke about Venus being pretty, we put up a cute animation of Botticelli's famoud ""Birth of Venus"". But then, when I say Venus up close is awful (and say ""Yikes!""), we zoom in on the drawing and Venus has my face on it"".  This guy was poking fun at himself and nowhere was the word ""transgender"" uttered in this episode.  It's about SCIENCE! (which the entire idea of transgenderism has absolutely nothing to do with).  Transfolk are obviously looking for ways to be offended as new opportunities to push their agenda.  I can't imagine that they really believe the planet Venus has a ""gender"".  And this guy folded like a house of cards and apologized, even though transgenderism was likely the furthest thing from his mind when making this episode.  Geez!  But I imagine his apology was motivated by his employer's wish to avoid bad publicity from all the trangender outrage.  Is anyone, at all, anywhere ever going to stand up and say that the Emperor is wearing no clothes?  Or has Orwell's 1984 arrived for real?  You know, when I was a kid and I'd get offended at something I'd taken out of context and wrongly thought it was about me, my parents would tell me that not everything was about me and that I shouldn't be so sensitive.

The trans women I know knew they were girls when they were 5 years old, well before they had any sexual thoughts or desires.

Julia Serano makes a great point about this in Whipping Girl, I highly suggest reading that.  You're ignoring the truth that women have more clothing that is considered ""sexual"", and women themselves are seen as sexual objects, way more then men. Sure, men have some things, but not nearly as much as women. So that's where the sexual side of it comes from, specially for those attracted to women.

GenderCritical,33f4zv,BetAle,4,Wed Apr 22 01:39:21 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, but how do you counter the accusation that this is simply more paranoia, exactly the same as the accusation that homosexuals are child molesters? In the case of transwomen, the correlation with sexual predation happens to be true, but because the whole ""gay people will molest your children"" meme was a whole big thing in the past, people now interpret any concern about trans people and children/washrooms/changing rooms as obvious paranoia, despite all evidence to the contrary, and regardless of how much violence and how many sexual felonies the trans commit."
GenderCritical,33f4zv,OwlofMinerva,4,Thu Apr 23 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"The ""gay people will molest your children"" thing partially stemmed from Allen Ginsberg.  He was a homosexual man and loud-and-proud pedophile.  He joked about fucking little boys, tormented Andrea about it (when they had previously been very good friends!), and was even an active member of NAMBLA. (See also this text excerpt from Andrea's ""Heartbreak"".)  Ginsberg was also a very famous author because of his open homosexuality, and a lot of lines were drawn in between to connect the two.  In that case, it was one man who was a vile misogynistic rape-bag; but in the case of MTFs you get not-famous people in large amounts having actual criminal cases.  Just #foodforthought I guess"

It appears that if you have one paraphilia, you are more likely to have others, including pedophilia. That only one I could find is paywalled. However I did find this one about ""adult babies"" that demonstrates the paraphilia cross-over nicely. NSFW  There are lots of cases of men dressed as/identifying as women committing sex crimes, which maybe isn't surprising considering the inclination to multiple paraphilias. None of them should be in a women's prison!"

GenderCritical,33f4zv,BabeOfBlasphemy,-4,Fri Apr 24 09:53:10 2015 UTC,"of which transvestism/autogynephilia is one   Trans women aren't transvestites though... they are born with different brains than average people, and just want to be seen as their gender identity... and transvestites are the ones who have autogynephilia, and are people who identify as men. It would seem to be crazy to me for someone to say, ""Well because some members of a small group of people who have no connection with each other are child molesters, therefore they are all."" That would be like calling everyone in the world child molesters because there are men and women that have been in the past.   There are lots of cases of men dressed as/identifying as women committing sex crimes   That's the difference though, those crimes were committed by men dressed as women, therefore, are men. Identifying as a woman does not equal identifying as a man."
GenderCritical,33f4zv,BabeOfBlasphemy,6,Fri Apr 24 10:20:36 2015 UTC,"Lots of TW are transvestites and autogynephiles, which they frequently demonstrate, even if they don't come out and admit it. Studies I've read on trans mention that they are secretive about the erotic part because of embarrassment. But it's possible nowadays the secrecy could come from the greater leverage they are getting from the ""born this way"" line. I think it's most of them, I heard somewhere.Will look that up. The problem seems to be the ""umbrella"" notion, where the trans movement claims all GNC people as its own in order to strengthen its claims - until they fuck up,that is. Then they're just cross-dressers.  A small percentage of transsexuals do not seem to have an eroticised component to dressing up. They are almost always gay men.   Also, check out the ""adult baby"" link above. It's one case where there is a strong cross-over in paraphilias between transgenderism and infantilism."
GenderCritical,33f4zv,BabeOfBlasphemy,-1,Wed Apr 22 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"But again, you are stereotyping a group of people to be a complete other group of people, that doesn't sit right with me. Gender Dysphoria is a real thing, with real depression and anxiety caused in people with it. To just write them all off as transvestites is wrong and only inciting oppression.  That link has nothing to do with transsexuals at all, just adult babies that they found some tend to be trans as well... that's like saying everyone who eat's McD's is a cannibal, because cannibals love eating at McD's. Still, nothing relevant to real transsexuals who are being oppressed by these ideas you are trying to share."
GenderCritical,33f4zv,OwlofMinerva,3,Wed Apr 22 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, some do suffer dysphoria, but they are not the majority. There's no point denying the autogynephilic portion of the transgender population. It's the majority. That's because transactivists insist on including all men who like dressing up, (and are more than happy to keep their dicks, thanks) in their advocacy remit. Not just transsexuals with dysmorphia. That's why when that incident with the creepy autogynephile in the gym blew up, there was so much controversy in the trans community. Some ARE happy to claim jerks like him, even though he's obviously a sicko who's dangerous to women. And some aren't. It's really determined by political expedience rather than strict diagnostics about who is legit and who isn't.  And I don't mean to say all trans are adult babies. I just used that as an example of the cross-over of paraphilias which I mentioned before. Psycho-sexual disorders are multi-focused. So you are unlikely to be just auto-gynephilic; you'll have at least one other paraphilia as well. It doesn't have to be infantilism or pedophilia, there are lots of other things it could be. The reason I bring it up was because you asked how anyone could make a link between transgenderism and incidence of pedophilia. I'm just saying the link can be made. Most men under the transgender umbrella - autogynephiles - have a paraphilia. And having one paraphilia means you are more than likely to have others. That isn't the same as saying all trans are pedos. It's just saying, as paraphiliacs, they will have a greater chance of having multiple paraphilias, including pedophilia. And it goes without saying, as men they will have a greater chance of being pedophiles than women are."

GenderCritical,33c52b,BabeOfBlasphemy,7,Tue Apr 21 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"The life of a parent is to put one's self on the back burner to tend to their child. That's a-typical.   EVERY parent I have known that was worth a shit prioritized their child over their own bullshit ""happiness"". Whether that be staying til the kid was grown with a spouse they didn't love anymore, or resigning to single hood so as not to bring strangers around their kid or take time away from their kid, putting their own health needs on the back burner to take care of their kid (broken infected tooth? Pop some pills and keep working cause kiddo has to eat, and fixing that shit is a grand worth of groceries!)   Its a common story for women to stay with physically, emotionally, or neglectful spouses because they can't afford to take care of their kids alone.   You are talking to a class of people who are DEFINED by their reproductive capacity and thus our life stories are chalk FULL of being nothing but care takers, not even finding ourselves until ""empty nest"" time. Why do you think so many divorces are initiated by women AFTER the kids are raised?  I'm 39, not even my generation was raised with the idea that women can be more than a mother or a sex object, women like steinman wete ""trouble makers, rabble rousers"", the men we were surrounded with demonized any academic woman, look what happened to Madelene O'hare. Women who tried to become something were often villified, if not butchered. And I'm not even technically middle aged yet.  All of us women here have mothers or grandmother's whose lives were spent living entirely for their kids. Hell, many of us lived that life too, I do!!!!  My grandmother had ELEVEN children. There was no birth control in her day, and women didnt refuse their husbands. He was a raging alcoholic, she couldn't go to school nor have hope of becoming anything other than a brooding mare, it didn't matter that she could speak nearly a dozen languages and shit more brains than my grandfather had.  All that mattered was her vagina - that alone was enough to limit all her life choices.  My own mother birthed six children, again, no birth control. It became legal right before she got impregnated with me, a child she didny want.  My dad told her he would kill her if she aborted, thats the only reason why I'm here.    My mother's life was defined by ironing boards and stoves, she was the spine of my family, caring for us all as my dad worked. She begged him for an education for years, he refused to let her work because it was an ""embarrassment"" to him as a man.   She got a job secretly when I was a teenager, she had to do it underhanded so to prove to him months later: ""I can work and still take care of the house"". It was only then, when she was 48 years old, that he allowed her to go to school, so long as his dinners were priority!     She got her degree when I became an adult. Most of our mothers and grandmothers weren't allowed to be their own people until AFTER the kids were raised.  That's MY life right now!!!  So when you come to a class of people whom are defined by giving up their identity to raise babies, and you say how men have a right to their happiness to be ""women"", when women were defined for us as perpetually putting others before themselves, and so many of us LIVE that way currently, do you realize how that sounds?  It sounds like my grandpa whining to my grandma how he worked so hard and so deserved to drink - fuck the eleven kids he gave her that needed every dime. It was all about HIS happiness... It frankly sounds like the a-typical selfish narcissistic behavior males are socialized with...  My cross dressing ex kicked my ass for TEN long years. I stayed all that time to make sure I could get a degree so I could be economically sound enough to take care of my kids.    I scrimp, save, put myself on the back burner, put aside my career and education goals, don't go after relationships I want, blah etc: all to make sure I raise these kids whom didn't ask to come here.    So if I can dash EVERYTHING I could have, should have, would have been to give my kids a decent upbringing, so can a dude resist the siren's song of a skirt without blowing his brains out... I was cheated on while pregnant, left with NOTHING, and had to pay 4k std screening in a panic to sure my unborn son and I didn't get aids or herpes because the nasty woman he slept with had worse ethics than a street hooker, and I didn't kill myself....

They also think that we are mostly defined by how we relate to men.  That is why you see news stories about Hillary Clinton that talk about what she is wearing and her physical appearance, while stories about male candidates talk about what they are doing - nothing about their clothing or looks - because it's irrelevant to the context of the story.  But, to them, for women, these things are never irrelevant, because we are ""female beings"" whose entire point of living is how we relate to men and never as just people living multifaceted lives.  But, in reality, being human is the most important thing about any person, male or female, and our sex is just one part of our lives, just as our race, nationality, and so on are parts of our lives.

And to allow them to make such a decision when they don't fully have the cognitive tools to understand the gravity of such a decision is nothing less than folly.

I was speaking to a liberal feminist friend about bill C-36 in Canada, and she said that she believes that ""slut shaming"" is the cause of violence against women in prostitution. This was her reason for refusing to use the word ""prostitution"" and instead using the politically correct ""sex worker."" She was honestly under the impression that calling it ""prostitution"" contributes to the stigmatization of prostitution, and results in an increase of violence against prostituted women. She sincerely believes that all violence against women comes from a traditional, Christian viewpoint, which is sexually repressed and made to feel uncomfortable by women's sexuality. So, according to her, the industry of prostitution would not be violent against women if only all of those Johns who buy women's bodies didn't think that ""being a slut"" was such a bad thing.  They really seem to believe that misogyny comes from a traditional mindset, and only from a traditional mindset. Therefore, they are completely unable to see misogyny when liberals are doing it; they couldn't possibly be misogynist - they're not religious or traditional-minded, so how could they be?  The ironic thing about this is that, by believing that traditional-minded Christians invented misogyny, they completely ignore the plight of women in minority cultures, such as Muslim societies, or even Muslim neighbourhoods in Western countries. They seem to think they are combating the very root of misogyny by being mean to conservatives."

However, instead really addressing that, it's suggested individual stories should be focused on, which still hides the real picture and means the systemic issues of racism and so on are still ignored. There some striking omissions there, they don't seem to acknowledge the link between prostitution and violence done to women and men trapped in it and while they do a comparison with white trans/white women and note that women are more likely to be killed they don't look at who kills those women and why, and they don't look at women of colour or death rates for women  in prostitution and assess what is happening there and whether that is being overstated too once you correct for all of that and use a head to head comparator. None of that stuff suits the narrative, I'd suspect in all cases that trans are underrepresented and women overrepresented.  As always, who is perpetrating this violence isn't really named and addressed and more concerning is this:    This fear is so irrational that it even lead some to defend a someone who raped a 15 year old cousin because that was the past and she was doing important work tracking trans violence. Think about that: a convicted sex offender running an organization that tracks violence against vulnerable members of society. That is indefensible, yet some ask, ""who will track the violence now?"" as though that's more important.   They are talking about Alison Woolbert, and of course what violence was tracked did not involve analysis of who is doing this, and instead there was the TERF tracker targeting women which claimed it was doing this ""for the safety of the trans community"". Is there is a point where it is realised that women aren't the problem here, nor ""misgendering"" and so on or the sheer irrationality of doing that while ignoring the real problem?"

Also you clearly fundamentally misunderstand Michfest. The festival organisers have never declared ""no trans women allowed"", and indeed several trans women (including those whose maleness is screamingly obvious from ten feet away) have attended fest entirely unmolested.  Michfest does not have a ""no trans women"" policy. What it has is an intention that the festival be a space reserved for women born female. Trans women have, as I noted, attended in deliberate violation of the intention. However aside from one incident in the early 90s no trans women have been kicked out of fest or refused entry. Part of the Michfest intention is to respect that women born female can look all kinds of different ways, and to offer sanctuary and recognition to those of us who don't ""fit"" as women in everyday society, so there are no ""panty checks"" or questions asked about one's sex at the gate.  Given that some of the trans women attendees have caused problems and in some cases serious emotional trauma to WBF I'm not personally in favour of allowing males to remain on the Land once they reveal themselves as such, but the fact remains that Sandeen could rock up at the gate in August with his ticket and be let onto the Land with everyone else, and stay the whole week without any bother.

There probably are some trans folks that do this.

On one hand, ""trans women are women, so I'm a woman woman woman and no one should be bothered by me being there.""

Go to the Michfest site and tell me where the exclusion policy is listed. There isn't one! Michfest is meant as a female space. It has allowed males (transwomen) in before but it explicitly remains a female space. If males respected this they wouldn't attend. But males don't respect women and so they attend anyway in violation of what the space is intended as since there aren't any repercussions. Read sodiumflares comment as well.  Again, Michfest intends the space to be for females and centers the entire event around females but doesn't ban transwomen.   Besides that, no, I would not be confronting the organizer of a private event for a minority group that I'm not a part of. I guess identifying as female hasn't prevented transwomen from being socialized with male entitlement. We say 'this is a female space' and all you can say is 'BUT WHAT ABOUT ME ME ME'.  What exactly are you expecting from Michfest? They don't toss transwomen out and a few have already attended. You are 'allowed'.  So what is it that you want Michfest to do? Stop calling itself a female space? Stop centering itself around females? God forbid there be an event that isn't all about males."

GenderCritical,32kbn5,Mrs_Andrist,-4,Sun Apr 19 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree that people have the right to turn you down for any reason I don't see a problem with transwomen having a meeting about this. Expecting some sort of blanket acceptance of everybody to this notion is unrealistic and yes, even coercive in a certain light. But just recognizing this is a barrier and discussing it doesn't seem that bad. I always thought that the Toronto meeting was demonized to a hyperbolic degree when nobody even knows what was said and no brain-washing scheme ever surfaced.   It does seem ridiculous to expect lesbians as a whole to suddenly accept penis'd partners, but in the same token it's not impossible for some lesbians to be ok with this. As long as it's consentual then that's fine. I personally think anyone who subscribes to the idea of ""the cotton ceiling"" is barking up the wrong tree but they are free to pursue their own happiness. It may feel ""rapey"" but it's not rape. I would call it ""whiney"" myself.  I think one of the problems with this is the need for the trans individual to assert that they are a genuine lesbian. They can't just find a more straight-leaning partner or a bi partner and kind of work from there. They want to be lesbian with a captial ""L"". In any case they are going to deal with a lot of ridicule and rejection. Hopefully people turn them down gracefully but even if they don't that doesn't necessarily make it transphobia. That's the key thing I wish more trans people would get. Life doesn't always work out how you would like. I've had a gay guy laugh in my face (it was a text, but still visceral) when he found out I wear women's clothes sometimes (I guess he missed that part in my profile). It wasn't because he was transphobic, he was just an asshole who wasn't interested in that. I could have had the same interaction with a straight man and then pulled the transphobia card but that doesn't really solve anything.   Personally I think these transwomen lesbians have a better shot hooking up with each other but they have the right to pursue whoever they want and those people can in turn reject them for whatever reason they want. Afterwards the transwomen can keep having their meetings to commiserate over how much that sucks. I don't really see a problem here. Well, the unreasonable expectations (ie entitlement), but that's a problem for individuals not for the class.  I'm now thinking of how surreal it would be if gay guys hosted a panel about how straight men never want to have sex with them."
GenderCritical,32kbn5,LovingLilith,13,Mon Apr 20 05:38:36 2015 UTC,"The title of workshop in the link includes the words ""Breaking Down Sexual Barriers"", it's not just coercive in a certain light it goes right to entitlement to other peoples bodies. No one can expect this of any person, not in any situation, their body is not a barrier to be pushed over and their stated their limits should be respected even if it is something trivial like eye colour. It's rape(y) otherwise.   Of course this is demonised, even having a session like that and it being run via an organisation that is involved in such areas and which should understand consent/respect for others is critical. It's not hyperbolic to object to that being floated, you don't have to have a scheme, it's enough having that and the constant idea of invading women's stated limits with things being said like that lesbians should 'examine' their preferences, that it's phobic not to want sex with a person. It's bad enough in general, the pressures that go on women to put out, it's even worse for lesbians who are often told their preferences are not valid, that they need a good dicking and so on. Male entitlement to sex is not just a isolated, individual thing but is pervasive and is often dismissed and it's pretended it's insignificant or it's made about the objections to it, not about the problem of it and that those people that push this idea really need to back off.    Asserting yourself as ""real"" lesbian is equally problematic, it's females attracted to females, and it is not possible to change sex in humans. Best you have is a sort of facsimile. Asserting it's not impossible for some lesbians to be OK with the idea of penis that completely ignores their stated sexual preferences and doesn't respect them. That seems to me to be just giving some wiggle room for pushing this, even knowing it's quite clear lesbians are not liking this at all (hence the demonising!). There should be no whining, no complaints, no pushing at stated limits at all. It should be clear for people like that their idea of ""pursuit of happiness"" involves pressuring women that do not want them to have sex and that should be rejected. It should not be excused in any way, and not just dismissed as whining because it demonstrates a large degree of entitlement. It needs to stop.  This should be easy, any person is entitled to set sexual limits and they should be respected. That's even if they are rude about it, if someone isn't into you that way, it would not make a phobia and it should just be accepted. You don't need a workshop for that."
GenderCritical,32kbn5,Reddwollff,-4,Mon Apr 20 06:39:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that wanting to be a ""real"" lesbian was alright. I was just pointing out the motivation. I agree with you for the most part. I said they were barking up the wrong tree.   The thing that is harped upon is how this is coercive. I think they are making their intentions very clear. It's not sneaky or akin to rape. It's a misguided notion that somehow their identity will have some effect on other's attraction to their physical attributes. Sure, they don't really see the folly of this and fail to understand the other side. They are being pushy about it for sure, but I think that's their problem that they really need to fix. The simple act of just pursuing the partners they want is ok as long as they don't constantly revert to  ""you rejected me, this is transphobia!"" It's up to individual lesbians to decide what to make of this.  I know a lot of these lesbian transwomen have unrealistic expectations about this but nobody can speak for every individual for a class. I will assert again that some women who identify themselves as lesbians can and do date transwomen. However their very trans-ness will obviously be a barrier to them. Any trans or gender variant person is limiting their dating pool significantly. This is just reality but I understand why they would want to ""break down"" that barrier if possible.  I agree with your entire last paragraph except for the last sentence. Of course nobody ""needs"" a workshop for anything. That environment exists to allow communication with peers about a topic that doesn't affect the majority of people. Obviously there are transwomen who want to discuss this issue. However the discussion they are having about it is probably not the discussion you or I would like them to have about it. That's on them to gain some perspective. On the other hand I don't see them bending the lesbian population to their will any time soon. The sky isn't falling, nobody will force you to have sex with a transwoman.  The corollary to this is that transwomen are really not going to gain any ground pushing this issue into the realm of transphobia. That is obviously not right and will lead to inevitable backlash. Or more likely polite bemusement given how nice and liberal the general population would like to appear. I'd also like to point out that we don't actually know how that meeting went down or what was said. It's easy to judge a book by it's cover, I can't say how much misconception was thrown at the New Narratives event I attended because of its mere association with Radfems Respond.   It reminds me of a podcast (sorry I forget what podcast produced it) that was made after the Radfems Respond event. There weren't actually any radical feminists on the podcast but there was a woman who was sort of just giving the Radfem point of view. The more liberal feminist host was wrapping up the recording and said something like ""they are so small though, why care?"" in response to radical feminism. The other woman brought up this idea of a transwoman wanting to date her as a lesbian and if that would be ok with her. There was a pause, and I think some form of non-answer or subject change. I don't think that question was ever answered directly. The podcast ended soon after that and it was very telling of the fact that people are more into supporting a seemingly progressive stance than are willing to actually believe in it.  It just goes to show people will make their own decisions when it comes to things like this. The only ""danger"" here is that these political stances will potentially affect younger generations to be more open to this kind of gender variation. Which is kind of already happening and I don't personally view as a huge danger as long as consent and power equality remains at the fore. Which I know it isn't right now... so yeah. I'm just going to end this here before I slip even further into metaxis."

It's up to individual lesbians to decide what to make of this.   I think you are interpreting what they're doing very charitably. Your personal perspective on things is healthy, but as far as these trans women go, the language they used has a history, and their cluelessness about that is one part of a larger oppressive attitude.   Part of the dynamic between the ""cotton ceiling"" advocates and lesbians who aren't attracted to trans women is that the advocates are generally unaware that they are parroting, sometimes verbatim, male arguments against lesbianism. They silently invoke the idea that female sexuality is fluid; they talk about ""breaking down barriers"" when that's been a way men have spoken about sex with women for ages; they use the fact that lesbians are social justice-oriented to argue for ""sexual inclusivity."" There are even trans women who argue (in the recent case of Lily Cade) that describing ""boundaries"" is a form of social policing or exclusion. In short, trans women like this are, however ignorantly, acting like men, and that makes these lesbians extremely and entirely justifiably defensive.  Paige from tumblr has described the way lesbians have become a kind of ultimate validation for many trans women. I think she is spot on, and I think the need for that validation betrays male entitlement.   As you say, there are bi women willing to date trans women. Why focus on the lesbians? Why make this such a big deal? Because they need that validation, and they can't accept that these women have boundaries."
GenderCritical,32kbn5,voi_che_sapete,3,Mon Apr 20 12:48:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've just re-read that and it does come across as a personal 'yourself', that wasn't intended although it hopefully came clearer later in that second paragraph that it was that subset that you were originally talking about.   The fact they are making their intentions clear is the coercive part, in combination with co-option of woman as identity, and the sexual orientation of lesbian as an identity. It still is that lesbians are objecting to this, clearly even if you individualise it into a number of instances the objection remains and it should be heard. It still feels like it's minimising the problem and dismissing those objections even as I can acknowledge many of the points raised such as how misguided it is. I don't think it is easy to grasp the pressure that goes on women in this context, that this pressure is intensified for lesbians and their community and how this entitlement, writ clear does have an effect. Our bodies are not barriers to break down, and it's simply wrong to force that idea.   The thing is it's easy to distance from this if this doesn't affect a person personally, but as in your anecdote, the more or less official line is that identifying as a woman, and a lesbian is to be accepted as that in all respects and if you refuse this in any way, you are a transphobe. Hence the silence, hence no statements to the effect of that no. She couldn't say anything without risk cutting out any  any allowance that cuts across that - that anyone has the right to choose whom they partner with and this really should not be questioned at all. They might not believe in this, but by not saying this they uphold the status quo and that remains unquestioned. They may have made their own personal decision but it remains only that, the pressure to comply remains intact for all others."

I've seen this entitlement firsthand in the /r/actuallesbians sub, and it's not pretty.  It's fine to question lesbians about why their preferences don't include you; it's not fine to argue with them when they give an honest answer.    You can't debate someone into being attracted to you.  That's not how attraction works.  You're free to feel frustrated, rejected or any other emotion.  You can even form a support group to voice those feelings.  But those feelings don't entitle you to anything from the object of your desire.  That goes equally for men, transwomen and anyone else who stomps around like a tantruming toddler when they don't get what they want from women."

Your assumptions about feminism are wrong, and they are an understanding of feminism informed by libertarianism. The idea that feminism is about choices, and not about women, but ""everyone"" is libertarianism co-opting a method of philosophical inquiry that focuses on women. I'll say it again, your belief in individualism cannot come from the perspective of someone disadvantaged by current power relations; if it was, you would realise its futility.

That doesn’t happen.  In fact?  Aside from the workshops about talking about the intention, or in individual situations?  NO ONE TALKS ABOUT TRANS WOMEN!  They don’t occur to anyone!  Because we are not there for them!    What is called “exclusion” by the anti-Fest brigade?  Is really about being completely de-centered as the narrative.  It is about the fact that folks want the women at Michigan to affirm their identities, without acknowledging any of the particularity and uniqueness of what it means to be female.   Bolding mine."

They seem to have forgot that you don't bite the hand that feeds you, that women are (actually were now, I hope) a large part of the constituency the organisation was meant to serve. When you look at the stats on volunteering, putting in money and time into organisations it's nearly all women that do that.    This last year Equality Michigan and Many of our allies across the country decided that the least we can do is say that trans people matter, and trans women and trans men and gender queer people deserve to be safe and to be recognized for who they are, and declaring that is just the beginning of what we as advocates need to do to help put trans issues high on the agenda, start to get out of the way more often and pull out chairs and offer that seat at the table. CREATE more seats at the table.   They didn't just create more seats at the table, that would have been fine to an extent. What they did instead is stomp all over women and along with other organisations target a unique event for women born women, and which only asked that that intention be respected. Not holding out a lot of hope that they've learned something, that respect is earned, and can't be forced on others because they still don't seem to get it nor have apologised."

GenderCritical,32g733,BeeeboBrinker,2,Mon Apr 13 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting study...  ""CONCLUSIONS: The increased mortality in hormone-treated MtF transsexuals was mainly due to non-hormone-related causes, but ethinyl estradiol may increase the risk of cardiovascular death. In the FtM transsexuals, use of testosterone in doses used for hypogonadal men seemed safe.""  Significantly higher rates of non-hormone-related causes of death were observed, likely due to lack of personal social support systems due to heavier social oppression and ostracization, which led to increased risky behaviour in MtF transsexuals. At least use of ethynil estradiol has long been discontinued due its increased risk of DVT and replaced by safer 17β-oestradiol and other bio-identical oestrogens, which do make hormone treatment in MtF transsexuals as safe now as the conclusions of this study reveal for FtM transsexuals."

Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group. http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885   It's concerning despite this they don't look at morbidity (deaths being an easier and more decisive measure) nor does this seem to trigger review of treatment strategies and/or investigation of the particular co-morbidities of the groups concerned. Safe and effective are relative things in medicine and always involve a balancing of risks and benefits."
GenderCritical,32g733,Reddwollff,0,Thu Apr 16 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, of course the findings are pretty consistent so far... The social situation hasn't changed all that significantly. The ""long-term"" studies coming out these years are also of people from the 90s using far less advanced medical treatments. There's really little that's prognostic about these kinds of studies. They really only go to show what people involved in the LGBTQ community already know, and what doesn't take science to show. The only good of these studies seems to be making scatterplots of scattered lives."
GenderCritical,32coa7,RubyxLeaf,3,Sun Apr 12 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"Gender Hurts by Sheila Jeffreys.  The Transsexual Empire by Janice Raymond.  It's an older book and may be hard to get, now, but I was lucky to get my copy back in 1980.  Not specifically about modern gender critical feminism, but is rather a comprehensive book about non-sexist child raising that is gender critical in philosophy and specifically critical of transsexual/genderism is Letty Cottin Pogrebin's ""Growing Up Free"".  Again, this book is from 1980, but used copies are pretty cheap on Amazon.  It is a welcome antidote to the ""trans kids"" phenomenon.  If I think of more, I will add them.  ETA:  There's also Christine Benvenuto's Sex Changes, her experience as the wife of a late-transitioning MtT"
GenderCritical,32coa7,Eclectic58,2,Mon Apr 13 00:46:55 2015 UTC,Great recommendations! Benvenuto's book is really excellent - to some extent it's better than anything academic you can find on the subject.   I would also add Unpacking Queer Politics by Jeffreys.
GenderCritical,32coa7,OwlofMinerva,2,Thu Apr 23 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"And that's what is really needed now - gender critical books written for a non-academic, mainstream audience, particularly about the trans kids phenomenon.  There should be books for children that make the point that they can be non-stereotyped in personality and interests without having to change themselves.  Also, there should be resources for well-meaning, but confused parents with non-stereotypical children making the same points.    The trans activists are certainly churning out such books urging parents to put their kids on the trans train and there isn't really anything current for them showing any alternatives, other than conservative books that advocate cramming gender role stereotypes even further down the throats of these poor kids.    The Pogrebin book about non-sexist child raising was a great one that I used as a young mother (son born in 1981), which did take a gender critical stance about transsexual/genderism and specifically linked it to homophobia, but we'd need something similar for modern parents that specifically addressed the trans kids phenemenon, which didn't exist when Pogrebin wrote her book in 1980."

For all their talk about ""biological essentialism"" - they are the ones who insist that minor differences in interests, behavior, and personality constitute a reason to change their physical bodies to match their supposed ""gender identity"". We really do need to make these things more clear for parents and kids alike. Separating sex from gender is one of the key steps. The trans insist on conflating them at every turn."
GenderCritical,32coa7,OwlofMinerva,2,Thu Apr 23 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"And the mainstream media does not help because they use the words ""gender"" and ""sex"" as if they were interchangeable, which only adds to the obfuscation.    I even see forms and applications now that ask you for your ""Gender"", then give checkboxes for male or female.   No, that's my SEX, not ""Gender"".  I am a woman, not ""a feminine"".  Facebook has all these choices for ""gender"", but there is NO checkbox for one's sex, not even an ""other"" where you can fill in with the word ""sex"".  When I was a young adult in the late 70s, you didn't seen all this gender, gender, gender crap being shoved down our throats.  Fortunately, my driver's license still indicates my sex, but I fear that may be on the way out, too."
GenderCritical,32coa7,Eclectic58,2,Thu Apr 23 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of passports and other documents actually say ""Gender"" when they really mean ""sex."" It's ridiculous.  People are even having their birth certificates changed. In my opinion, even if you buy into transgender doctrine and you think it's possible for people to be born the wrong sex, why would you change  it on a birth certificate? A birth certificate is a historical document, telling you what sex someone was at birth. Even if you think sex can change, why would you change a historical document? Is that how badly they want to be thought of as exactly 100% the same as real women? And they seem to think that not having the proper M or F on their passport is a major human rights violation because of the funny looks they get from people at airports and other ID checkpoints. They say that it causes confusion and suspicion and singles them out. If anything, you'd think that seeing an F on a passport and then looking up and seeing a tall, broad-shouldered, jaw-boned man with an adams apple would be the thing to cause confusion and arouse suspicion. It's probably part of their whole obsession with ""passing"" and their delusion that no one else notices that they are male, until they look at their ID. They think the passport is what gives it away, but in reality, we can all see that you're a dude, bro."
GenderCritical,32coa7,OwlofMinerva,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  But the entire idea of transgenderism is built on fantasy, not science, so it doesn't surprise me.  Any fact they don't like, they seek to erase.  I understand and sympathize that someone might not like what sex they are, but to deny reality just boggles the mind.  I would have loved to have been an even 6 feet, rather than 5-9, but I don't go around telling people I'm really 6 feet tall just because I wish it so."
