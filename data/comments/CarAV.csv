CarAV,3e42vv,Goingdef,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"You only need one fuse up under the hood by the battery,when you fuse you're fusing to protect the wire from drawing too much current and failing or shorting in the event of a crash, do the math on how much each amp draws at the end of that 0g and use the right size fuse the only time you need a second fuse in the back is when there's a second battery that would need to be isolated in the event of a short."

CarAV,3e3stl,getMeSomeDunkin,3,Tue Jul 21 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"Well, taking what you said you want for face value, you wont get it upgrading just speakers. You may even lose quality upgrading speakers and nothing else. Most aftermarket speakers are designed more durable to handle amplified power, so the little bit of power your stock stereo is providing will be negated by the stronger suspension etc of the aftermarket speakers.  Personally, I would say to start, the easiest upgrade would be to seal your doors. Sound dampening etc. You may find your stock speakers sound like new ones just by doing this. After, if you still find yourself wanting more you will be a step ahead of the game with the dampening of the doors.   In the end, you will HAVE to upgrade something other than the speakers to get ""rich audio that sounds good""."

CarAV,3e3stl,BettyFuckingCrocker,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"You'd be amazed at what can be done while still looking stock.  You could easily amp your speakers without an aftermarket stereo. Just find an amp with speaker level inputs.   Like I said, you could end up being satisfied after sealing your doors. I would say next step would be to amplify your stock speakers. Then get aftermarket speakers if you are still looking for more. But that's just my opinion, I'm sure others might feel differently."
CarAV,3e3stl,Goingdef,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"If you replace just the speakers pay close attention to the rms wattage and try to find a set that's pretty low since underpowered speakers sound terrible when you try to push them, using low powered speakers will still enable you to get the most volume for the wattage you have on hand."

You will get a LOT better response if you seal your doors though."

Make sure you place a fuse as close to the battery as possible, convention is less than 15"" I believe. If you are looking for a wiring kit, I'd recommend the KnuKonceptz 4 guage OFC kit.

There will also be a remote wire, that will be in between the RCA's (at least is should be, I just used 2 of these kits for my friends installs), that will go to the remote out of the HU's wiring harness from the amp's remote in.

It's generally considered the most correct way to do electrical connections.    There is nothing on that vehicle that is not DIY capable.  Find a grommet in the firewall and run some power wire through there. If you are running an amp that requires large wire that won't fit through the existing grommet, a bimetal hole saw will punch a hole in the firewall nicely. Be sure to install some sort of grommet if you do drill a hole -  wire + jagged metal = bad.   Really, not much to this hobby at the start.

It is more complicated than that, efficiency and frequency response are other variables that come into play... but basically more xmax=louder when dealing with subs."
CarAV,3e4eml,lpbman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"I can't find any panel that shows me xmax. But why would I feed the Pioneer 600w when it's RMS is 300? I thought for constant use, you want to stay at the RMS."
CarAV,3e4eml,ChrisRK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"You do, I read the second box at bottom wrong.   Xmax it is in the same list as spl and transfer function magnitude. Check if you are over xmax."
CarAV,3e4eml,ChrisRK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:34 2015 UTC,There isn't anything I see that I can be over on. I input the xmax with the correct value. There isn't anything that says xmax anywhere other than what I have inputted.
CarAV,3e4eml,nagaina,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:07:40 2015 UTC,You need WinISD Pro (also free) to check xmax: http://www.linearteam.dk/?pageid=winisdpro
CarAV,3e4eml,New_Zeal,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:36:10 2015 UTC,It wont let me create my own drivers because the consistency check fails even though all information I put in was directly from the manufacturer's website.
CarAV,3e4eml,New_Zeal,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's an annoying issue. WinISD Pro calculates all the values and if something doesn't match up, it won't let you create the driver profile.  The list you get with errors contains 3 values each. Clear one of the values from the line and let WinISD calculate the result. It may be slightly off or very off. I've had mixed results with different drivers."
CarAV,3e4eml,nagaina,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"This is weird. The website for the pioneer sub says its senitivity is 95db. However winISD will NOT let me put that. If I try to delete a different number, it immediately comes back so the sensitivity is the only thing I can change and it says 85 is the correct one. I don't know what to believe.  EDIT: How do I check the xmax? What panel is it called? Cone excursion I don't think is it? thanks!"
CarAV,3e4eml,nagaina,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:30:39 2015 UTC,"Instead of trying to fill out every box, just input Qes, Qms, Fs and Vas."
CarAV,3e4eml,nagaina,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"Pioneer's 4.7mm xmax is definitely a factor (since it's low, actually less than half the the qubed), since that's you're excursion/ how far your sub moves in and out. So the higher that is, the more air it pushes, and the more spl you get.   There are lots of different factors, I highly suggest you get familiar with subwoofer specs. Here is a great resource to help you understand the different variables, what they mean, and how they relate to each other http://www.speakerplans.com/index.php?id=faq1  tl;dr more power doesn't necessarily mean louder, it's just a guideline"

My advice would be to just disconnect it, it doesn't help according to what I've read. http://imgur.com/xjm2fjn It looks like the grille should just pop out.  I'm not familiar with the radio/amp situation in the new generation 9-3's, I have a 2001. I didn't have a factory amp, so it was pretty straight forward to put in a new 2 din head unit and new speakers all around. I checked my EPC, you have 6x9"" speakers in the parcel shelf, 6.5"" in the front doors, and two 3.5"" (can probably fit 4"") in the dash. There are also pictured rear door speakers, but it's not specified which size they are.  I would recommend finding out which speaker system you have (AS1, AS2, etc) and if you have an amp. Then you need to decide if  you want to just replace the speakers (easy), or the head unit, amp  and everything. I think there might be kits for connecting a new HU to your factory amp, but I would prefer just hooking up a new amp and put in new cables. Get a decent 6.5"" component kit and two 6x9's, it should help a lot."

CarAV,3e0wpo,passwords_suck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:25 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it has something to do with your remote line only showing 6v when it should be 12v.  It may be causing issues with the transistor not switching correctly.
CarAV,3e0wpo,scott_fx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but how would a weak remote signal limit the power output on an amplifier? Does an amp need a stronger 12v signal as the power output increases?"
CarAV,3e0wpo,scott_fx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"this i'm not sure about, but i'm wondering if the power is not enough to keep the transistor or ssr 'latched'.  maybe there is some sort of emi or induced load that is contributing to this when the power increases."
CarAV,3e0wpo,scott_fx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:13 2015 UTC,You can get a 5v relay and use it to switch a 12v load if you're looking for a permanent solution.  You can drop the voltage from 6v to 5v  by wiring using a resistor.
CarAV,3e0wpo,Soggy_Pronoun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:57 2015 UTC,"You are definitely on the right track. Come to think of it, the remote wire would be controlling the main power transistor (or relay) and since transistors need a certain voltage applied to them to open fully, the weak voltage could have been limiting the transistor and amp."
CarAV,3e0wpo,Bezzle59,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"Depending on the type of ""switch"" your amp is using you might not be fully saturating the junction. 6v at relay, unless you are using a 6v supply to it which would be odd,  likely means whatever you have supplying the relay can't provide enough current so it draws the voltage down trying to pull the needed current.   That's going to cause you some problems on your relay line eventually. There are a lot of questions to be asked here. Do you have anything else hooked up to the same relay line?"
CarAV,3e0wpo,Bezzle59,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"Nothing is hooked up to the relay line at this point, I moved the remote to a switched 12v line in the back."

CarAV,3e0y07,LurkMyGurk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"On the amplifier, one of the two RCA inputs runs a signal to channels 1 and 2 and the other RCA input runs a signal to channels 3 and 4. If you dont have a signal going into both of the amplifier inputs, two of the channels wont work. The fix for this is to get an RCA Y splitter and split your RCA so that the single cord coming out of your headunit is able to send a signal to all 4 of your channels.  So you only need one RCA output on your headunit split into both of the RCA inputs on your amplifier.  A problem with bridging your amp into your front speakers might be a loss of left/right balance. You should looks into your L/R balance and see if theres a way you can retain that because if you lose this feature, i would say it wouldnt be worth it to bridge the amp for a bit of extra power. Let me know if theres anything youd like me to clear up or expand on, and i can even make you up a little diagram if you want.  Edit: I went ahead and made a shitty diagram to show you how you can do it Splitting it like this will allow you to retain the Left/Right balance as well.

CarAV,3e1jt1,gnoani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"Generally, a 4-channel amp will have a peak that's double the rated RMS per channel. Let's break down the system here-  14w RMS head unit- this doesn't matter. You're not going to use the internal amp on the unit, because if you get a good one, you're going to be running low-level inputs to your 4-channel amp. Get whatever unit has the features and outputs you want.  Peak isn't a terribly useful number. It's the upper tolerance for power handling. You'll see it used for marketing more than anything. If you run a speaker at its peak, you're going to burn it. It will also sound like shit.   50w RMS, 300w Peak means that when you're running near 50w, the speaker will be performing nominally, and a giant, momentary <300w hit shouldn't pop it. That's all.  You should be focusing on matching RMS.  Tune your amp gain correctly, and it won't be an issue.  Personally, I have to recommend full-range speakers above 50w RMS."
CarAV,3e1jt1,gnoani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:03 2015 UTC,Do you think a 200w rms and 600w peak 4 channel amp would run the 4 speakers and unit?
CarAV,3e0ezc,Gad001,2,Tue Jul 21 00:14:38 2015 UTC,solid starting point for sure.   all you need to do is run new wire from your amp to each driver and probably just one more set of rca's (3 in total).  get it all hooked up and start tuning.   your x-over setting will be a bit tricky you'll have to do some research about what the passives are doing.  if you can get those x-over points and slopes then that would be the best place to start.

CarAV,3e0ezc,beardedNole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:51 2015 UTC,The prs has a limited amount of xover points. I don't think it'll play nicely with a 3 way front stage.  But I'm guessing here since I dint have any personal experience with it.  Then you need to figure out how to control the sub as well.
CarAV,3e0ezc,beardedNole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:04 2015 UTC,Can a custom splitter or something be built that would send part of the 80prs sub signal down a low pass channel and part down a high pass channel? Or maybe the 80prs mid signal instead?

CarAV,3dxr1y,nagaina,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:20 2015 UTC,When we followed the steps here the voltage didn't come up to where it should be until my HU was at max volume. It was about 60% of what it should be at when I have the volume at the loudest I could listen w/o distortion.
CarAV,3dxr1y,Ptarted,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:31 2015 UTC,Does the bass get loud enough for you? I assume it sounds a lot better now that your battery terminal is replaced.
CarAV,3dxr1y,bds0688,4,Mon Jul 20 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"It was an odd situation where the voltage coming from the head unit was too low for he amps to reach RMS up until about 80%-90% of max volume. Basically we couldn't actually get the gain HIGH ENOUGH (lol first time saying that!) Because of the volume he normally listens at is low in the head units scale, the preamp signal doesn't even get high enough to meet the gains need voltage until it's past the volume he likes.   He doesn't NEED a line driver, but it's the best way for him to get the voltage he needs to the sub (so he can get the most out of the sub) while still keeping his sub loud. A line driver would allow his sub to get more voltage and play at max ems even if the fronts stage is playing at a lower volume. A more powerful amp would also do justice but it's more expensive then a line driver too. We tried maxing gain on two different amps and couldn't get near what they could do rated until the volume exceeds the point he WANTS it at.  One alternative solution is to sell both amps and get an amp that does a good deal higher than what the sub cn handle. Because of the headroom it will do the RMS he needs for the sub even if it's not reaching its full potential.   EDIT: I also believe the reason he likes the volume much lower isnt becasue he wants the fronts quiet, they were plenty loud, but I think that the aftermarket HU was giving the stock speakers more power than they were designed to handle so they distorted and did all kinds of mechanical no goods. So basically more power to the stock speakers made them get loud and distort MUCH quicker than before which means lower volume of course. What it also means is that now the sub amp isnt getting the signal its need for max RMS. Basically, I believe it could be solved by a line driver, more preamp voltage on the HU, or aftermarket speakers that wont get as loud so quickly and wont distort so early either."
CarAV,3dxr1y,Ptarted,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:07 2015 UTC,I feel pre-out voltage can be misleading. It will do two or four but only with a bunch of shit turned on or cranked volume.
CarAV,3dxr1y,bds0688,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, reaching the signal that the HU COULD put out required the bass way up and volume way up too. It needed up unbalancing the rest of the system to try and get the sub to play as well as we'd have liked"
CarAV,3dxr1y,nagaina,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:04 2015 UTC,It seems lower tier or a certain era of the lower tier Alpines all fibbed with that. Following the same guide I had a 9807 that refused to do four at any moderate volume without crap like media xpander turned on.  Haven't blown stuff nudging the gain to achieve balance.

CarAV,3dytmi,Rockstaru,3,Mon Jul 20 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Hey friend, Rcas are for sending signal to an amp, if you aren't using them in your install no worries. The steering wheel controls also aren't an issue as your car doesn't have them. The radio should have come with a mic however, check the packaging as it is a bluetooth capable radio. Those metal connectors are there for ease of installation, though if you're soldering, you can just cut them off.   Crazy enough the brown wire is actually from way back when car phones were just car phones and when you received a call it would mute the radio haha. If you don't have a car phone you're ok there. Blue white wire is also for sending a remote turn on signal to something like an amp, so not necessary without an accessory you need to turn on with the radio. The blue wire is for a power antenna, again if you don't have one, no need. I'd suggest using the c clip and finding a screw or piece of metal to screw into, its a much better ground.  Disconnect the battery before you start and solder the two harnesses together on a bench, use zipties or tape to keep the wire bundles neat, and of course heat shrink your solder. Not too hard to screw up but if you do there are fuses, not too catastrophic, have fun with it!"
CarAV,3dytmi,Senbum60,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Do I need to fully disconnect the battery, or is just disconnecting the negative terminal enough?"
CarAV,3dytmi,drjenkstah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer everything I can.    The RCA connectors are for an external amp and if you don't have one then you don't have to worry about connecting those. It'll be business as usual with the bass coming out of your other speakers like your stock system is currently set up as. Also you don't have to worry about the other connectors if you don't have or plan on installing any of that. It won't affect the usability of your head unit. The diagram you're referencing is showing that you'll need to expose the wiring and crimp it accordingly to the harness you're connecting to. I believe the diagram is showing a butt connector for simple wire crimping. With this one you shouldn't have to worry about it if you' don't have a place to connect it to your harness. It won't harm anything. With this one you can safely connect the black ground wire to another black ground wire on your metra harness. It'll eventually lead to a stock ground on your car so you don't have to worry about grounding it yourself. This one I'm not too sure since I usually read, re-read, re-read again before turning anything on. I think the biggest thing would be to just make sure everything is connected correctly; especially the ground wire.   Hopefully this helps with your questions."

CarAV,3dzp8y,Tec_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to throw some stuff out there. So as others have said, ground can be a issue. You want your ground to be to bare metal sand back the paint if you have to. Another issue could be undersized power wire. If you are using a power wire that isn't able to supply enough current to your amps that could be your choke point. Your power and ground wire needs to be the same size.   A thing you could do to determine if it's a power issue would be to hook a voltmeter or a dmm up to the power and ground on the amp and crank the volume up. If your voltage dips you know it's a power issue if your voltage dosent dip but your subs still cut out you know you've got other issues."
CarAV,3dzp8y,Leo_Kru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:05 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain it would be a voltage/ground issue as each amp has its own 4g wire with a 0g from the front battery to the rear and a 0g ground on the rear battery. At high power my headlights dim to about 50% brightness. Would isolating the rear battery help with the voltage dips? I plan on replacing the 4g front ground with a 0g and running a 0g connecting all ground points.
CarAV,3dzp8y,Tec_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"Your probably right, but why not hook a DMM up and actually verify that. Realistically your car isn't generating enough to power those two amps and everything else it needs to. Let's get real general and ignore efficiency, those amps have 4 25 amp fuses so theoretically you need atleast 200 amps of power to play them. I don't know what you have for a alternator but a quick google search is telling me that your motor uses a 160 amp standard. You have a second battery but all your doing is draining it because you standard alt dosent have enough power to power everything. You could turn the gain down so your amps arnt pulling as much current or you could buy a high output alt and try to supply enough power to do what you want to."

CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,4,Mon Jul 20 16:25:02 2015 UTC,you really need an amp for the door speakers if you are concerned with sq.  look at hybrid audio technologies imagine's or morel's for solid components in the ~$300 range.     also you should budget in sound deadener for at least the doors.  it's the only way to get good midbass

CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:12 2015 UTC,"What's your opinion on the headunit I've picked?   in your price range... well even if your price range was $200-$600... i'd still recommend this:  Pioneer 80prs.  Personally i would never run dual or pyle or boss.  they produce a very cheap product.   The pioneer has 24bit burr brown dacs, auto-eq and auto time aliment (that will be great for a noob), it has 3 sets of pre-outs, and has 'network mode' in case you want to upgrade in the future and go with an active setup."
CarAV,3dxxrf,beardedNole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:50 2015 UTC,I did have a look at the 80prs but I didn't really like the look of it but I suppose that's something I'll get used to.   This afternoon I'll have a look around for some really decent components for the front and a 5 channel amp.  But with the amp how do I go about the wattage? Because the sub will need a decent amount more power than some components
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,2,Mon Jul 20 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"You can take a look at the older Pioneer Premier DEH-P800PRS (that's the unit i'm running right now until i decide my upgrade)  the 80 prs has some additional features and a slightly better autotune algorithm but it' [p800prs] is still a solid unit... and is one of the best looking units that has come out in some time.   /u/shtoops has one for sale (they dont' make them anymore).     there are some tiny amps like the massive audio  and soundstream picasso nano amps that you'll be able to sneak almost anywhere.  They are are class 'd' amps so make sure that you err on the side of 'more power' because you'll benefit from the headroom.    Which sub are you interested in?  btw... i see you were looking at doing two subs in a ported enclosure.... that would be considered an spl build, not a sq build.  You system will be way too bass heavy.   You honestly don't a sub designed for more than 300-500 wrms especially in a small hatch like a prelude.  Go with as sealed box.  you can even buy good ones off of sonicelectronix for $35!"

CarAV,3dxxrf,beardedNole,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:51 2015 UTC,I'm not all that familiar with that sub. I recommend looking at image dynamics idv3 subs. They aren't much more and they sound good.  Another solid option is dayton audio.  Just an amazing brand at a reasonable price. They should have one right around that price point.

CarAV,3dxxrf,beardedNole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:09 2015 UTC,I'll have a look around for some really decent components for the front and a 4 channel amp.   Does this mean you want to take a shot at going active?
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:42 2015 UTC,I've only heard good thins about it so why not haha how much of a different does going active make?
CarAV,3dxxrf,beardedNole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yes! XD  Great choice.   how much of a different does going active make?   It makes a world of difference. It allows you to have full control over each individual driver in your system - tweets, woofers, subs - and tune each one specifically and precisely to give you the type of sound (quality) you are after. Time alignment, level adjustment, EQ adjustment, crossover point adjustment, slope adjustment and any other features your chosen DSP has makes your music sound incredible."
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:22 2015 UTC,also cost.  you can get raw drivers and not have to pay for the passive x-overs.  the end result may not be 'cheaper' (when factoring in the extra amp power you'll need) but the quality will most definitely be better.
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm not too cost concious, I just want a real clean quality sound so that sounds good.  So just checking, to go active I'll need two 6.5"" for the front, two tweeters, maybe two 6x9 for the back I'm not sure yet, one amp to run all of that, a sub and an amp to match?"
CarAV,3dxxrf,beardedNole,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:16 2015 UTC,"I hope /u/scott_fx was persuasive enough for you to loose the rears. Edit: Whether or not you use rears is completely up to you, but you know our feelings on it.  I finally got a chance to read through the entire thread and scott_fx and /u/Senbum60 make some good points for if you want SQ.   Go active (the best way to get your sound dialed in just the way you want; Pioneer DEH-80prs HU will be your least expensive option and a good way to get you accustomed with a digital signal processor (DSP)) Ditch the rears for easier tuning (I promise you get used to it) Use component speakers or raw drivers for your front stage (tweeters and mid woofers; either go passive the the passive crossover or active with one driver per channel of a 4 channel amp) Seal and deaden your doors (for increased midbass respone) Use plenty of power (100w or 150w per channel if you have to) Don't use a sub that will overpower your front stage (500w tops)    So other than the sensitivity, what makes the References better than the Pioneers? ... I'm trying to get my head around what makes a speaker good and what makes one bad.   There is no substitute for hearing the drivers for yourself and deciding. That said, component speakers like the Infinities I linked or any of the other components that others mentioned are better if SQ is your goal. They allow you to place the tweeter in a different spot (usually higher up) and it does wonders for your sound stage. There are a lot of other factors including (most importantly) the materials the drivers are made of as well as the power handling capabilities and basically everything else about how they are made that go into making a good sounding driver. You will figure these things out as you get more involved and read, read, read about what goes into making a driver and a good sounding system.  Any questions? Ask away. If you install this yourself (recommended), you want to make sure you buy off of Crutchfield, unless you know you know what you're doing, in which case there are plenty of other good sites to buy from with good equipment options. Please let us know what you want to do and we would be happy to help you more with any questions you have, including recommending gear."
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,2,Mon Jul 20 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"Going active sounds like a good idea but is there anything else to it in wiring? Or is it just hook each driver up to a different channel?  I am planning on sound deadening the door and maybe the floors, I'll use dynamat extreme  But I have a mate who's an electrician and he's done a few installs so I'll enlist his help and learn as much as I can in the process"
CarAV,3dxxrf,timothylockhart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"There is no special wiring that is different from an amp to the speakers (aside from bypassing the passive crossovers if you have one, but that doesn't take any effort).  If you use the 80prs, you put the HU in 3-way active mode, then send 3 pairs of RCAs to the amps then speaker wire from the amps directly to the drivers.  If you use an external DSP (80prs optional) then you would need to send a full range signal to the DSP using RCAs, then more RCAs from the DSP to the amps, then speaker wire from the amps to the drivers.  Don't use deadener on the floors. Deadener reduces panel vibrations, but that doesn't do anything to stop the noise from outside of your car from entering. What you need for that is a barrier - mass loaded vinyl (MLV) decoupled from the car with closed cell foam (CCF). Visit www.sounddeadenershowdown.com for more info on all that.  We can always help as well here. In fact, we like to help :)"
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:20 2015 UTC,just make sure whatever dsp he uses has an auto-tune feature.  tuning can get pretty daunting for a 'n00b' (actually for anyone).  it will be nice to get 80% there by setting your mic and hitting a few buttons.   Otherwise OP may feel a bit over his head and intimidated.
CarAV,3dxxrf,timothylockhart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:17 2015 UTC,And that's just another reason why the 80prs is a great option for a beginner to active setups because it allows for both manual and auto tuning.
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:50 2015 UTC,exactly
CarAV,3dxxrf,timothylockhart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:57 2015 UTC,I was thinking about different head units today thinking I might get another pioneer but wiring it that way seems very simple so just to start me off I think I'll go with the 80prs and go 3-way active.
CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:58 2015 UTC,one thing to add about components when using the passive x-overs.  it's not always advantageous to mount them high up.  The major draw back to this is the path length from the drivers to your ears.  If you mount the tweeters up high and the mids in your doors you will now have 4 drivers with different pathlengths to your ear.  you really can't correct for this with out time alignment in an active system.  Therefor it's usually recommended to mount the tweeters near the mids and take a hit in stage height.

It's not perfect but for all intents and purposes; in a car, it's the best we can do.   Like /u/beardednole pointed out... everything is a compromise."
CarAV,3dxxrf,beardedNole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:53 2015 UTC,I have time alignment but don't think I'll be able to tune well I think I'll stick to near the mid stock for now

CarAV,3dxxrf,Senbum60,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"If you want sound quality, you should consider ditching the rear speakers. At the very least, run the rears off deck power if you decide to keep them, but leave the stock speakers in and spend your money elsewhere.  Upgrade the fronts, but don’t get coax speakers. Get component speakers. That will give you better SQ. If you do decide to go with rears, get rears that are less sensitive and less powerful than the fronts. As of now, your rears are both more sensitive and can handle more power, so I think you should reconsider your drivers.  There is a huge difference between those subs.  That W7 from JL Audio will knock ur socks off, so you don’t want that if you’re going for SQ. That Pioneer is entry level, and probably pretty cheap. There are plenty of other subs out there that would work better, IMO. Depends on if you’re open to switching it up."
CarAV,3dxxrf,Senbum60,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"I have an aftermarket headunit in my current car and I have heard about ditching the rears so I have faded the speakers to the front before and although the outcome may be a bit different with different gear, I personally prefer having rears.

So other than the sensitivity, what makes the References better than the Pioneers?

CarAV,3dxxrf,scott_fx,2,Mon Jul 20 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"My goal is sq with a bit of midbass   Your goal should be a lot of midbass :)  as for rears.  sq is a lot easier and cheaper to accomplish without the use of rears.   At the very beginning of a tracks mstering, the producer sit in front of and in between two monitor speakers.   He dials in the song to sound best from 2 point sources... a 'stereo' final output.  They spend a lot of time creating a 'soundstage'; where if set up correctly you can close your eyes and visually imagine where each instrument is on 'stage' in front of you.    When we add rears (without any processing) to our cars we are screwing with the original mastering of the track.  Our cars are a very imperfect space for audio.  we have huge reflective surfaces (windows and dashboards), asymmetrical speaker placement (when measured from any seating position) and a host of other issues (that dont really concern our debate on rear speakers, so i'll leave them out).   So with good sq, we want to be able to control the audio as much as we can.  We have a lot of control of the signal up until it gets to the speakers.... then it gets complicated.     When we have a stereo pair of speakers playing up front, we do have a bunch of audio that gets reflected from the hard shiny surfaces but we have the ability to tame a lot of those issues through proper installation and tuning.  When we add a second set of speakers behind us...   that are playing the exact same signal... things start to get messy.  Soundwaves add and subtract, they reach our heads at different times, music is coming from behind us, etc....  as you can easily see, we are messing up what the producer spent many hours dialing in.      There are people who love rear fill, and i'm not here to tell them otherwise. What I am here to tell you is that it is easier to achieve a proper soundstage and easier to tune a simple 2.1 system versus a system with rears.   The most successful use of rears will require some sort of dsp (logic7 seems to be the front runner for this).  What i do always suggest is for you to drive around in your current ride with you audio faded completely forward for a month.   Now you will take a hit on spl.. mainly because you are turning off two of your speakers, but that is only temporary.  We can address this in your sq build.   For the first two weeks your mind is going to be acclimating to the lack of rears.  Just drive around and get used to it.  After about 2 weeks or so your mind will have adjusted to the lack of rears and you should start to forget that your rear speakers aren't playing music... or are missing.   This is when you can start to appreciate the sq of the system.  it should sound more clear/less muddy and you will be able to identify a 'soundstage' a lot easier.     If at the end of the 4 weeks you realize that you just can't get over not having rears... then anyone that tries to tell you what you like is 'wrong' is an idiot.  But... if at the end of the month you realize... oh hey!  just having fronts sounds pretty decent and i dont even realize that i have no 'rear fill'.... then you should go head strong with setting up a solid 'no rear' system.   Now for midbass.... imho this is by far the most important aspect of great audio.   People but WAAAAY to much time and money into subs.   For a sq or sql setup, a simple ~300-500 wrms amp and a sub built to handle that power is all you really need.   To be honest, that is going to give you enough bass where you will need to attenuate it (in most cases) in order to get a good balanced sq system.   Subs play all of 2 octaves in the area we are least sensitive to.   So find a decent sub and forget about it.    Midbass.. this is what brings your system to life and what ties it all together.   It's what kicks you in the chest when you're listening to a good rock song.  The keys to midbass are installation (sound deadening and sealing your doors), power (you need plenty of power.   I usually recommend 125-150 wrms.  I have run 75 wrms on my seas, but that was at 8 ohms and they are pretty efficient drivers.), and driver selection.   A few of us on here run actively crossed over systems where our mids, tweets and subs are powered by their own amplification channels.  This allows ultimate control on eq'ing, crossover points, slopes and time alignment.   In my case i'm running 150 wrms @ 8 ohms to each of my mids.   i just wrote this while working... so i hope it's clear.  please ask questions and i'll try to clarify any confusion.  There are solid group of us on here that are sq oriented and we are very willing to help.... and we are always learning from each other as well.  this isn't something you'll just pick up in an afternoon.   So ask ask ask questions!  back to your sub comparison.   those two subs are so different that they can't be compared.   the w7 is an spl woofer that has good sq.  it is also a power hog.  you'll need a robust amp to power it.  A w6 would be a better option in the jl line.   You should also look into dayton audio, peerless  and image dynamics.   you can get a sub between $150-$300 that would be great for a sq system."

Just be sure you get the sides trimmed down as far as you can. You can cut it short enough to be down in the insulation with a little patience and some good clippers. If in doubt, wrap the end with electrical tape or preferably heat shrink to be sure that any frays won't escape and cause a short."

Had this happen when I was a kid running 0 ga to an amp my 1st time  oxidation and non-uniform contact will do that.

CarAV,3dvisy,bds0688,4,Mon Jul 20 05:17:27 2015 UTC,How is that a problem for trimmed wires but not for untrimmed wires? I think you missed the point of the question.
CarAV,3dvisy,Leo_Kru,0,Mon Jul 20 05:26:14 2015 UTC,I just step down from a different source. I know everyone hates caps here but I go 1/0 to my cap then step down to 4ga. Wire.

CarAV,3dvisy,Goingdef,5,Mon Jul 20 03:30:58 2015 UTC,"There isn't a damn thing wrong with using one on a system with voltage drop either, what's wrong is thinking its job is to somehow magically create more power for a starved system."

CarAV,3dvisy,simon425,0,Mon Jul 20 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"All it does is smooth out electrical ripples in the current, basicly as your car runs and uses power there are fluctuations of just tenths of volts a cap removes these before they get to the amp....basicly it's jewelry for your car and in no way helps against voltage drop it actually makes it worse if it's present."
CarAV,3dvisy,Goingdef,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"If used properly it will eliminate the voltage drop. But the amp is going to get its wattage regardless. The internal power circuit is going to make sure the speakers are powered, when you have a major bass hit the rest of the car suffers because your amp isn't going to take no for an answer. The voltage drop will affect your cars other systems, specifically the lights. Check out this document from Crutchfield, it's simple and pretty explanatory."

CarAV,3dvisy,TeeInKay,-12,Mon Jul 20 19:48:14 2015 UTC,"A VERY well known and respected SPL competitor once clued me into what he does. You want to avoid dead ends(like cutting excessive of right there at the end by the terminal)...  Take about 6 to 8 inches of the sheathing off. With all that exposed wire trim some sections of strands off near the beginning (closest to the remaining sheathing). You'll notice the wires are all bundled up into like 5 or 6 sections of wire all spiraling inside the sheathing. Cut off one of those sections and spread out the cut wires so that they touch the remaining (longer runs) of wires and there are no dead ends / all sections are touch firmly to the remaining wire. If you need to remove more move up an inch or two and do it again, until you have the desired amount of wire at the tip to go into the amp terminal. Electrical tape the shit out of it. Itlly gradually go from thick to smaller and perfect for your terminal.  I have some pics somewhere from when I did this a few years ago with my 6 runs of 1/0 in my spl build. I'll dig around my photobucket for those when I get home."

Here in the States the numbers are different in that what I believe your ""PMX"" series in Europe is the ""MRX"" line here, and the ""BBX"" there is the ""MRV"" here.  Either amp will do a credible job in powering your components the question is what crossover will you be using as both the amplifiers along with the Pioneer's feature set has an extensive crossover controls.    Is the difference in price somewhere around $70.00?  Depending upon how you plan to both configure and wire up should determine what is best for you.    I would say because the Pioneer is so loaded with audio control settings I would go with the lesser expensive amp as you would rely on the Pioneers features instead of the amps.  You can't really say one is ""better"" than the other as the determining factors are what suit your needs best."

Brands are Pioneer, Alpine, JVC, and Kenwood.  Power search - Sonic Electronix  Power search - Crutchfield  .....  Just a heads up -> On any model below $400, it's almost certain that the GPS navigation requires a seperate add-on accessory, which will be linked in the description.     If I had to recommend one out of the list, I'd probably go with the Pioneer AVIC 6000NEX  ...  It's a 2014 model, so it has a -$250 price break, which is awesome because it puts some high-end features within your price range.  ...  It offers very good integration with smartphones; and the Navigation takes advantage of that; traffic sensing, updates and such.   ...  It has 6 pre-amps at 4volts (nice) for adding in a sub and amps (for the door speakers, too, which I recommend eventually)  ...  It has a composite A/V input on the back, which can serve as an AUX input by using one of these cable adapters  ...

Rather than comparing a positive signal and it's inverted counterpart and eliminating the discrepancies (noise);  I want to eliminate the positive signal and the inverted counterpart entirely, leaving ONLY the discrepancies.

The transformed signal is then sent to both rear midwoofers (mono) and band-limited to ~300Hz-3000Hz. No tweets, obviously.

I think we actually agreed the whole time, it just wasn't coming across:   Use whatever you want to secure your box if it's in a trunk. Ratchet straps and bolts are the least likely method to fail (they hold 500lbs worth of ladders to my worktruck)  There are NO guarantees in the event of a crash.  Some customers are dumbasses. Do what they want and assume no liability."

CarAV,3dsowo,copperbricks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"Nope. If you have an 8 ohm woofer it means your amp will only be able to deliver 200 watts and the current draw is in line with that.  Another bonus, the amp is more efficient at 8 ohms than it is at 2 ohms and it runs cooler and cleaner (though it'll be inaudible at the sub frequencies.   The 2 ohm eating only means that it can handle that impedance without smoking itself."

CarAV,3dr1yn,FriedBizkit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"I would be more concerned with what blew the amp, but shouldn't be too hard to repair.  Three MOSFETs and resistors, not as hard to solder in as you might expect."

Along with the transistors to the right and left of the toast one.  You can try to look up a wiring diagram of the amp and order some replacement parts. If a problem was upstream (I.E. a controller) then more than one would be burnt. This looks like just a bad mosfet and some sore luck.
CarAV,3dr1yn,KuroDensetsu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"Judging by the large blister on the board next to that mosfet, the traces might be badly damaged. Lots of electronics use multi-layer PCB's, so you might have more than one trace burnt out, which is bad news. If you had no shorts in your system, this is most likely a factory defect, get an RMA."

CarAV,3dqouk,marsrover001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"So the radio you are trying to install has the plastic plug that goes into it, and a bunch of loose wires coming out of it. That's normal for aftermarket radios. You take the harness that fits your car connector, and you match the colors to the wires coming out of your new radio and you make a custom harness that way.  Then take out your old radio, put the new radio in the dash kit, put the dash kit into the hole left by old radio. Connect the wiring harness you made and the antenna adapter (did I mention you need an antenna adapter)  Anyway, websites I mentioned before, even if you don't buy from them. Can tell you what adapters and dash kits you need."

CarAV,3dpbog,scott_fx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"If you disconnected the amps, you won't hear anything because it's essentially like disconnecting the speakers   Does your eq have a remote turn on lead for the Amps?  If so use that to turn on the amps. You may just need a small delay for the amp turn on to avoid the pop.  Pac audio and david navone both have delayed relay devices. That you can use."
CarAV,3dpbog,scott_fx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:22:52 2015 UTC,Will the delay work for when the amps turn off? Because thats the issue.. Do you know how this happens anyways? Is it a Faulty amp?
CarAV,3dpbog,SandFate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:07:20 2015 UTC,It should.  You just have to test it.  Use s little jumper wire from the 12v to the remote turn on.  Shut the car off then manually pull the jumper (simulating a delay).  See if the thump goes away.

CarAV,3doh9r,Andabagofchipss,5,Fri Jul 17 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"Weird, but maybe it has to do with the stereo not being wired properly to interface with the amp, or the amp was not bypassed... Hear me out:  When you switch to FM, the only difference as far as the radio goes, is the blue wire from the harness sends out 12V, meant for the power antenna. A lot of times this wire gets mixed up with the amp turn-on, blue with white stripe. I believe this is turning on your jbl amp only on fm, and it stays off using any other source.   If you don't know what to look for, cut the blue wire at the jvc harness and report back."

CarAV,3dp2q8,AzraelGrin,3,Sat Jul 18 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"Don't get that credit card.   It probably has high interest rates.  Capital one cards are pretty good.  Just keep your credit balance under 30% of your limit.  Above that and it'll bring down your score.  If this is your first card... Be careful, it's a slippery slope and could cost you many thousands of dollars if you f it up."
CarAV,3dp2q8,scott_fx,2,Sat Jul 18 02:48:09 2015 UTC,Okay. I'll just stay away from credit cards for now. Haha.
CarAV,3dp2q8,scott_fx,3,Sat Jul 18 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"It's honestly the best bet.  Actually what you should do is get a credit card now; from a major bank like capital one, and immediately cut it up when you get it.   Part of good credit is having a long history of credit.  They won't know how much you've used it.  What they look at is that you've had it for a long time.  You haven't missed a payment and your balance.  Auto loans help a lot as long as you pay them every month.   The worst cards for your credit are department store or private cards that are only good at a particular store.    Your fico score also goes up if you have 2-3 lines of revolving credit (aka credit cards).  Below that means you don't know how to handle credit.  Above that means you could easily go into big debt... And not know how to handle credit."

CarAV,3dp2q8,scott_fx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:03:39 2015 UTC,"Good advice. To add to this, you should make one small purchase on the card monthly or setup a small recurring purchase on the card that you won't forget about. Something you would buy anyway. Then pay the card balance in full every single month before interest can be charged.   If you leave a card inactive, most card issuers will close the account after 6-18 months. This would be bad for you as someone trying to build credit because you would have established credit history and then your ""oldest"" credit line would be closed due to inactivity. Therefore, your score will drop and you will take a hit.   Also, you should never pay an annual fee. Try to avoid cards with an annual fee unless the rewards outweigh the fee cost. Which, in most cases for basic consumer cards is not the situation."
CarAV,3dp2q8,nomeansrape,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:06:41 2015 UTC,Hmm. I have a discover card that I never use but it's still active.  I believe the card issuer will notify you first (to try to get you to remain a customer). But yeah it wouldn't hurt to use it like you suggest
CarAV,3dp2q8,scott_fx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they would.   However, for OP, you still need to show a payment history. You don't need to carry a balance but lenders will look at opening history and payment history on lines of revolving credit."

Proper alarm install(not zip tied to the steering column)?  4+ hours, best to leave the vehicle and we'll call you when it's done, though in reality it was usually about 90 minutes, some cars were a PITA and to do it right took a while.

Just make sure you find your exact model of Accord and then look up the wiring harness and dash kit.   Edit: Oh and you may need an Antenna cable adapter depending on what your car has and what the AVIC has.
