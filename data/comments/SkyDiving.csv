SkyDiving,3e340s,brainstomp,7,Tue Jul 21 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"They brought a couple demos to our DZ now that there is a manufacturing facility in SLC, and it looks awesome! I didn't jump it as I only just started jumping crossbraced canopies, but the experienced swoopers at our DZ were hauling ass and loving it.   Also after talking to the Fluid guys I really think they will do well. They are insanely knowledgable and dedicated to making new and better wings. I think they have a great mentality about canopies. The hybridization of skydiving and speedflying design ideas mixed with lots of detail into airfoil design seem to be paying off a lot in glide ratios and performance. I'm excited that they are in the game now."

SkyDiving,3e4o2i,lucky_dog_,4,Tue Jul 21 22:47:36 2015 UTC,Is it scheduled for a full moon?  If so you wont have any problems seeing the ground.  Remember to look out at the horizon at flare time.  If you aren't used to this practice it before hand. Many people were told to do this in AFF but have gotten away with not doing it. For a night jump it's more important than ever.    The second big thing to consider is that you cannot see the other canopies in the pattern until they are pretty close.   They will suddenly appear as you catch a glimpse of their strobe.   Night jumps are fun.  I've done 4.
SkyDiving,3e4o2i,NNick476,2,Wed Jul 22 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"Night Jumps are a ton of fun. If I had to give you a single bit of advice is that LACK of light is an indication of a canopy in front of you. There will be tons of ambient light even if it is low to get you an idea of what is where, if you see a spot that is rectangular and BLACK, not a single light in sight, turn right because it is a canopy coming at you. That bit of advice saved someone I know from a canopy collision at 800 feet two months ago."

Then you could negotiate a price on a bulk purchase.  If you are staying out there don't forget to pick a DZ that does plenty of mid week loads!
SkyDiving,3e4mmg,mz123456,7,Tue Jul 21 22:36:24 2015 UTC,I know a lot of jumpers that got hurt downsizing early but I can't think of one that got hurt because they chose to stay on a larger wing.   There's so much to learn at every wingloading there is no reason to rush. It only takes one bad landing to end your time in the sport.
SkyDiving,3e4mmg,ElectricHerpes,3,Wed Jul 22 00:57:26 2015 UTC,This is true and good advice. Learn to fly the shit out of each canopy before progressing.

(Bought my first rig)  Felt like a big transition to me and I'd intended doing a few on a 190 beforehand but instructors felt i'd handle the 170 fine. It actually went a lot better than i'd expected. Better openings, more responsive input, better flare etc.   Don't see myself going smaller any time soon , still getting used to the 170 and don't fancy spending any more money for the time being. Had been talking to coaches about going to a 150 for CRW but certainly no lower than that for the next hundred or two at least."

SkyDiving,3e4mmg,itsmeb,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"Most jumpers at my drop zone bought their first rig with 1.1 - 1.2 loading around the time they completed the A license. It is a bit aggressive in the beginning, but survivable without injuries. Such a canopy can easily last you until you hit 200 jumps.  Also, consider the possibility that you may bump into people in free fall and lose contiousness. Downsizing increases risk, even for expert canopy pilots. Ask some of the swoopers at your drop zone regarding their injuries. They all seem to have some stories to tell.  Only you can decide whether downsizing is worth the potential injuries."
SkyDiving,3e4mmg,ElectricHerpes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"I would be what people consider an aggressive downsizer. I have a total of like 60 jumps, I have a handful of jumps on a 230 and 210. I jump a 190 loaded at a little over 1.3. BUT it's a specter. So it really isn't crazy or aggressive. I would do it again because it is a very gentle canopy and it will last me many years and will work as a good wing suit canopy."
SkyDiving,3e4mmg,itsmeb,-1,Wed Jul 22 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"I've got 75 jumps, started on a sabre2 230, (6'2"", 180#) went to a sabre 2 190 off of A license.  Then bought a sabre 2 170 at 50 jumps. Now I'm on a crossfire 2 159 at 70. I love it. But I would not recommend it for everyone. Be very proficient on your canopy before you downsize.   Perfect story, this weekend I was in the plane with a good storm a few miles away, I jumped anyways. At around 900 feet the wind started blowing me around, decided to land downwind on this fully eliptical Canopy. Nailed the landing, but would not have done so well if I didn't keep a level head. TI's and other pro jumpers were landing hard on that load."
SkyDiving,3e4mmg,Teamerchant,7,Tue Jul 21 23:50:45 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but even 75 jumps on a single canopy is not enough to be proficient on it. I don't care who you are..   That being said there are jumpers capable of flying smaller or more aggressive wings with less jumps than recommended but it's still not very wise.  Stay safe man.

SkyDiving,3dxr47,reddit_user49,0,Mon Jul 20 20:05:45 2015 UTC,That is a good video and very well articulated.
SkyDiving,3dxr47,rlaptop7,4,Tue Jul 21 10:00:04 2015 UTC,"No matter how you get there just do it.  I single stow mine before the cascades and double wrap after when the line bundle is smaller.  I achieve the required tension without breaking rubber bands every other jump.  So the blanket statement to double wrap everything is just a cover your ass statement.  Just be smart and achieve what they say below however you need to get there.   ""Stow your lines so that they require eight to 12 pounds (3.5 to 5.5 kg) of force to extract from each bight, no matter how you get there."""
SkyDiving,3dxr47,scubasky,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Any way you slice it, it's really about retaining the lines with the proper amount of pressure so that they do not release out-of-sequence. For instance, if you are stowing Dacron above the cascade you might only need one wrap, but for a majority of sport skydivers with properly sized d-bags, the double wrap is probably the best way to achieve a proper amount of tension.  In general, I think this article is just meant to challenge the idea that double wrapping locking stows can give you a bag lock (and pointing out that a bag lock, even if it happened, is not as bad as getting slammed with a break-neck opening)."
SkyDiving,3dxr47,mathrick,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"Did you actually read the article? I do it the same way you do (the compromise method they list), but the way stows come undone under tension is a very convincing argument for double stows. I'm going to give it a try the next time I pack and see what comes out."
SkyDiving,3dxr47,LordTengil,0,Mon Jul 20 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"You better be sure the tension is there on those first stows. If there is any stow that you do not want to release early ever, it's the ones closest to the canopy.  Out of sequence released stows due to mixing"

SkyDiving,3dxr47,mathrick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"I really don't notice much difference.  psycho is almost the same as pro in terms of how the gores are leaf'ed and wrapping the canopy... the only difference is that you roll it up instead of z-folding it.  I will warn you, you need to add a 12-18inch long extension between your canopy and pilot bridal as the attachment point ends up in the center of the roll.  the biggest advantage of psycho-packing is that it manages trapped air insanely well for zero-p fabics, as you don't end up with airpockets at all (think about rolling an airmattress) as the air gets pushed out the bottom as you roll... gives super tight well managed packjobs for zero-p.  on porous fabrics it just allows you the pack way faster once you are used to doing it."

That information alone shouldn't affect other skydivers' opinions of the center knowing what we know about the sport, but isn't it odd that all that happens to one DZ, meanwhile there are other DZs out there with no deaths or accidents in the last decade along with $0 in fines from the FAA, who are depositing the same number of jumpers? Maybe there are other things to take a deeper look at, like what's the level and quality of training Lodi performs at?  Do the separate HP landings from the rest of the load? Why are they not a USPA dropzone? I don't know, but to me something smells fishy around Lodi."

SkyDiving,3dmxlr,sniper1rfa,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:18 2015 UTC,Definitely. If it's an emergency you won't know where you are when you get out. More canopy time is always better.
SkyDiving,3dmxlr,Canopyflyer,5,Sat Jul 18 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"If the jump plane you are on has an emergency, you will not be performing your planned jump.  If the pilot gives the command to exit the aircraft, everyone goes out single file as quickly as it is safe to do so.  If the pilot does not give the command, you sit there, keep your ears open and your mouth shut.   I have bailed out of the same aircraft, twice in my skydiving career.   Both times we got our crap together as quickly as possible and when the command was given, exited aircraft orderly and giving a second or two delay between each jumper.  Faster than you would for normal hop-n-pops, but still giving a little time for a bit of safety separation in the air."
SkyDiving,3dmxlr,Bolt_and_nuts,2,Fri Jul 17 17:25:01 2015 UTC,I doubt you are going to continue your planned skydive even if the aircraft has an emergency around 10k for the following reasons  Pilot is not going to throttle back so your run in speed is high. Extra airspeed is energy for making it back to an airport. People behind don't want to wait for your exit count.   You are getting out close to each other so you may need to worry about separation in the sky. Tracking or staggering openings. First priority for me would be to get out the plane though.   You may be far off the dz and it would be advisable to open higher than usual to find a safe landing area if over a hazard such as a lake  Things to keep in mind though is the pilot is in charge and a bunch of people rushing to a door could make his job harder.

SkyDiving,3dkdgz,JeromeMorrow13,3,Thu Jul 16 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"I jump the Storm, and can definitely say that I am a fan. I've just started wingsuiting, and the canopy has been extremely forgiving, even considering my less-than-perfect deployments that are inevitable in the learning process.  It's a 7-cell, tends to be fairly ground hungry / steeply trimmed. Landings are really nice as long as you use the bottom end of the flare (PD is not kidding in the promo video). I got it with the casual CRW kit, which means dacron lines and continuous center A lines. Nice perk if you want to have some fun with your friends under canopy.  The only thing I don't really like about it is that it feels like it spends a long time ""searching"" for its heading after deployment. It is also very sensitive to harness inputs when the brakes are still stowed. But, it is very forgiving, and I've never even had line twists with it. It can be disconcerting waiting to see what heading it will finally settle on though, and also feels like it wants to take off in a random direction if it is loaded at all unevenly. Not a deal breaker, but just as an FYI.  As much as I love my Storm, if I were looking for a canopy today, I would definitely go with a 7-cell, but I would strongly consider the Epicene, for the lightweight material, tiny pack volume and what appears to be more ""positive"" openings."

SkyDiving,3di1kq,rlaptop7,2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:03 2015 UTC,Having a camera on your helmet period is a snag hazard. The design intent was to be as snagless as possible.
SkyDiving,3di1kq,orangekid13,0,Thu Jul 16 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"To add to this, snags require hang up points and the design is flush mounted to the helmet and has flush interfaces between the various parts of the mount. This sort of design makes it really hard for a line to hang up in the mount and its various subsurfaces.   And while we don't see the back of the unit I am sure that the design feature symmetry across both front and back faces. Even further reducing snag points.  Aside from the 'towering aspect' of the mount presenting front to back snag ability, you really can't see any snag point in the design.   Nice work OP."

I'm working on my accuracy, and since I'm flying a Sabre2, I had to flatten the glide quite aggressively to be able to reach the T. I didn't expect it to be as taxing physically!"

SkyDiving,3ddryd,Gosh-Darnit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:55 2015 UTC,"talk with you instructors about this. seriously, do that.   in general you're probably going to want to engage larger muscle groups--i.e. by pulling straight down you'd engage lats/back muscles more than by pulling out to the sides."
SkyDiving,3ddryd,jwdjr2004,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:28:21 2015 UTC,I'd say tricep pulls are more the target excercise for turning/flaring. Lat pulls use more of the muscles used to do pull-ups.

It's more like wrestling people than anything else in the beginning.    If you're a tiny little dude, your life will be hell. If you're more of a spartan warrior, it will be less challenging.  You'll start off making minimum wage for whatever state you're in and it goes up from there as you progress in your instructing and you'll also get commissions for up selling to your classes after they fly.  It's not easy and you won't always have a very good time, but you'll meet a ton of awesome people and you won't suck at skydiving anymore...eventually. You're making more at your current job, though.  Why not just fly 10 minutes a week and get coaching?  Your schedule will not be anywhere near concrete."

SkyDiving,3db6r7,Scatoty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"I currently work for iFly so I have some insight but not all tunnels are the same. I am a CSR, not an instructor.  As an A license holder, you are most likely not going to be an instructor immediately. You will go in as a CSR and once your probation period is over (or if you prove yourself as a CSR) and you show an interest in flying; they will consider you for FITP. For the time being, you are free to work on your skills in the tunnel when time allows (Staff receives free but not unlimited tunnel time).  If you have a degree relevant to business or management I recommend applying as upper management since the pay is better. The pay starting off as a CSR is minimum with commission.  I genuinely enjoy my job. It can sometimes be rough dealing with customers but I'm sure you're familiar with that. It's relevant to my passion of skydiving and has only increased my desire to advance in this sport. The only drawback I have is that since the busiest days are the weekends, I'm often restricted to weekday jumping but it's not the worst thing in the world.  Being an instructor is very strenuous on your body so be sure you are in shape. A fitness test will be administered before you are accepted into FITP.  I'm happy to field any other questions you may have."

SkyDiving,3db6r7,caseyga,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend left a very prestigious accounting firm with top pay and benefits to work at iFly. At his old job he was expected 70-80+ hours/wk during his busy season (basically half the year) and he couldn't skydive, see friends, or do anything outside of work basically. He quit and started at iFly in April and he seems so much happier these days. He doesn't get nearly the pay and benefits, but he prefers to sacrifice the high pay than sacrifice happiness. You DO have to be in shape and willing to work erratic hours. It helps if you are a bigger buy but I've seen some amazing instructors who are small, it just takes more work.  Even if you are instructor, good customer service skills are very important because you make a lot of your money on commissions. There will always be jackasses when you do CS, just like your current job, but you take the good with the bad and keep smiling. Also, remember that skydiving is NOT tunnel flying - they are very different and just because you like one doesn't mean you'll like the other. Go do some time in the tunnel if you haven't already to (1) make sure it's something you enjoy as much as skydiving and (2) see if you like the instructors at your local tunnel and get the ""customer"" experience there. All in all, you might be better off keeping your current job and just paying for time like everyone else :) But if you decide to do the iFly thing, make sure to update us!"

SkyDiving,3db6r7,LeftShark69,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think you need to evaluate your own personal life before making any drastic decisions. You start out by saying    The enviroment is amazing and the people I work with are amazing. It's the best job I've ever had.    but then quickly transition to   I dont enjoy the work I do. I sit at a desk all day and listen to people who feel oh so entitled to their in game items they have earned complain all day.    Obviously this isnt the best job ever because regardless of benefits and pay, the best job is the one that you enjoy the most.  Beyond that I would highly encourage you to jump way more before you quit your job. When I first started skydiving I was in love with the sport and did 200 jumps my first year. Now its been 2 years and i've barely done 100. I still love the sport, but I'm just not as obsessed with it. If you asked B-license me about skydiving I would definitely give you some starry eyed response like you, I felt that everyone should jump and that its the greatest thing in the world. Today I still love skydiving and dont ever see myself quitting but I dont drop everything im doing to go make some jumps like I used too. I dont jump as much as I used to mostly because im finishing up school and am buried in work/job hunting. Once I graduate and have a more regular life again I completely intend on jumping more. My point in telling you this is that you might end up regretting your decision in 3 or 4 years if suddenly you get tired of skydiving.  One more thing, you are going to get abused in the tunnel. Im close with a lot of the instructors at Denver and some of them are beat to shit. Your body gets beat up trying to catch a 200lbs man falling towards the ground. They have stiff backs, necks, and knees its a super a sweet job but it takes a toll on your body."

SkyDiving,3dbo90,alemadii,7,Wed Jul 15 00:47:36 2015 UTC,"At my home DZ, the instructors make you stick with the rental analogs until you're licensed. It's just simpler.  If you feel ready to start using a digital, you probably are.   Just keep in mind,  there is an increased chance that it will not function.    In about 700 jumps, my various digital altimeters have failed on me a total of 3 times.  1 dead battery (due to a manufacturing fault) and 2 software crashes. Also on 1 occasion I didn't turn it on until about 1500 feet so it was reading 1500 ft low for the entire jump and canopy ride.  Do you feel ready to deal with these kinds of situations?  Can you fly your pattern with only visual cues?    For 3 of these situations I decided that I would tell the people jumping with me so they could know they had some increased responsibility to not break off too low.  Also, I had an audible.  The other time I was doing a hop & pop opening out the door. I just had to accept the possibility that if I had a malfunction, I would have to basically cut away immediately."

SkyDiving,3dbo90,Deceased_Puppy,3,Sun Jul 19 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"At my current level, I figured that if my altimeter went down on the ground, that I wouldn't be jumping. If it went down on the ride up, then I'd get to ride the plane down for the first time. If it died in the air, then I'd clear my air space and pull ASAP. Thats me and my skill level and what I'm confident with. I think I could fly my pattern with only visual cues to at least land in the big ass field with no obstacles, and not land in any surrounding farmland or backyards.

SkyDiving,3dbo90,SkyMannn,-5,Wed Jul 15 04:40:31 2015 UTC,"Lol.    First time my digital died i was on my way to altitude. I jumped anyway haha. Second time, it died after opening. Third time it froze at 12,000 feet. Sight picture and know the cloud base come in handy."
SkyDiving,3dbo90,SkyDancingSanta,2,Wed Jul 15 20:23:56 2015 UTC,I got one at like jump 8 because the digital display was sooo much easier for me to read in freefall.
SkyDiving,3dbo90,mathrick,0,Thu Jul 16 14:27:18 2015 UTC,Reading the numbers under the canopy is a big plus for me. Especially under 800 feet. How fast does it update the numbers?
SkyDiving,3dbo90,zerospinskier,0,Thu Jul 16 21:30:45 2015 UTC,VisoII has a resolution of 5m (or 10ft I believe). It's distinctly more accurate than anything analogue you can get.
SkyDiving,3dbo90,mathrick,2,Fri Jul 17 14:09:46 2015 UTC,Definitely! It is 2015. Use the technology we have created to make ourselves safer. I try to get people using digital altimeters as soon as possible at our DZ. (We rent analog ones). They are more accurate and easier to read quickly. A big European DZ did a year long test where they gave AFF students digital altis and audibles and the data showed much safer and faster learning.
SkyDiving,3dbo90,JeromeMorrow13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:40:26 2015 UTC,"Denmark requires students to have an analogue alti (you get your licence at 40 jumps). In practice, the instructor of the day might have their own outlook, and either clear you to jump with digi only (if you've done it before), or conversely disallow you to have a digi at all, even if you also have an analogue (and which should be OK by the written rules). Usually you will have no trouble jumping with both, but you never know.  Personally, I find digital to be massively easier, both because I think in terms of numbers, and not where the arrow is pointing, and because shaking in freefall doesn't influence the accuracy of the readout. Our club has done a trial year where the head instructor got a waiver to train students for digital (and also audible I believe) from the start and no radio, and it's gone very well. Additionally, a digital alti lets you review a jump much more accurately, especially a sketchy one where something went not as planned and you're trying to remember the altitudes and sequence of events. I love that it keeps my logbook for me and I can just fill it out at the end of the day without trying to remember how many jumps exactly I had and what I did on them.  While I generally agree with the reasoning behind not letting students use audibles (though it'd be nice to have actual data to support either view), I don't buy the justification for analogues. They're anything but easier to read in my experience, and the colour markings are essentially invisible to someone who's struggling to make out the pointer and remember to check the altitude in the first place. I get that there are people who prefer them, and that's fine, but I simply don't believe they're generally safer for students. The only real advantage I've heard is that you can read someone else's dial in FS, unlike a digital display, but that's not applicable to students. As for reliability, everything you gain by not having batteries you lose in the lack of autocalibration, and analogues can and do go out on the ride up. The last instance I've see was less than a week ago."
SkyDiving,3dbo90,Deceased_Puppy,0,Fri Jul 17 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"I'd wait two more -- assuming that you'll get your 'A' at 25.   I started with a digital and a full-face helmet a couple jumps after I finished AFF. However, I cleared it with my instructor and ST&A first -- both of which thought that I was progressing rapidly  The digital alti does add a little more complexity to your dive flow, but I like it much better than an analog. When you ditch your student rig and start freeflying, I recommend that you purchase an audible, as well."
SkyDiving,3dbo90,Bliswas,0,Wed Jul 15 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"I'm at the exact same spot as you (23 jumps), and just had my instructor on my last coach jump (swoop n docks) advise me to get a digital because of an issue I had.  Basically we agreed that if I finished my swoop n docks above 5k I'd get to throw in a couple backloops or barrel rolls and at 5k I'd break off, track, wave and then pull. According to my coach, I finished my second dock at 5500ft, and my coach didn't expect me to do anything at all, but I did a backloop and a roll. My memory has me thinking I swear it said 6k when I looked.  My coach wasn't mad, just said that I misread it and that shit happens. However, in the right conditions that could have been disaster, luckily it was no biggie this time. We also went over if maybe I just looked at my altimeter instead of actually reading it, and maybe that was the problem, but I truly believe I saw the ticker above 6k right after the second dock. My coach believed me and as he said before, no biggie this time, it happens, people misread their analogs.  After that happening, he said just get the digital. For our generation (I'm 25 years old), we're so used to digital everything it is just easier. My coach for that jump was actually younger than myself, he said he went to digital for his first gear. Big ass, clear, simple numbers are easier for him and he figures that'd be the same for me.   So he told me just to get a digital. He mentioned the only real downside is that the battery could go out, whereas a analog should always work as long as I don't damage it. So we talked about different options and what benefits they have. My next gear purchase will be a digital altimeter.  Also, my original dropzone pushed me to stay with an analog altimeter for as long as possible. However, other jumpers said digital was the way to go, or would at least argue both sides of the coin. My original DZ also let me get a full face helmet just a couple jumps after clearing AFF. My current DZ said if my old DZ let me wear a full face then they trust the judgement of that DZ (knowing exactly who operates it). But just 14 or so jump at my new DZ and my coach is advising me to get a digi. So it really depends on the jumper and the DZ."
SkyDiving,3dbo90,Mikaelolz,0,Wed Jul 15 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"Regulations might be against you, for example in Finland you need to have C-license to use ONLY a digital altimeter. Before that you need to have analog altimeter which may be complimented by Viso for example..."

SkyDiving,3d6ctv,LeftShark69,13,Tue Jul 14 01:59:38 2015 UTC,"Skydivers tend to make a lot of claims about how good the community is to one another, how there are no cliques, how the community is void of all the negative things we find in real life (about how we look at and treat one another) and how everyone is treated equally, but those people are either lying, lying to themselves or are already in a strong clique themselves and have yet to realize it. Or they are simply one of those people that are very lucky and everyone adores them because they are so bubbly and smile all the time and therefore are living in a bubble that they can't see outside of."
SkyDiving,3d6ctv,Marikc1,9,Tue Jul 14 03:04:28 2015 UTC,"Yup i agree with this. I was actually talking to a group of people for a good 10 minutes who were talking about canopy size and i popped in that i was nervous about dropping down a size too early because my new canopy came in about a month early. They were interested in the conversation with me right until i told them i was going from a 190 to a 170 after only 15 jumps on it. They laughed then spoke among themselves then literally turned their backs on me.   Apparently I was not skygod enough for them, Newbies need not apply i only had 55 jumps at the time. But just like any sport you have those who believe they are above everyone simply because they have been doing it longer."
SkyDiving,3d6ctv,Teamerchant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:19:55 2015 UTC,"I went from the large student canopies to a 180 I believe that was available to rent and then purchased a 175 if I recall correctly (or 170). This was with the blessing of the rigger who helped inspect it, approved of shipping it for him to look at and so on.  The only problem I ever had with that 170/175 (at about 170lbs) is that on the first two jumps I hit the ground and slid on my stomach a good 10-20 feet (if I only had that on video). After that it was smooth sailing with no problems for probably a good 70-90 jumps. It just took a few times to get used to how it flew.  Scott Miller's canopy course also helped a lot.  Personally, I never had any issues with anyone acting the way you described (to me). I just was very aware that people in the community were not the kind hearted, we love everyone crowd that they pretend to be. As time went by, I noticed the cliques more and more. Especially as new jumpers came around, it seemed more (far less respectable) cliques were forged. Then I started hearing about drugs being sold, rape (on a girl that was unconscious), among other things. Though I do recall at Florabama that when I sat near people or stood stood near them who I wasn't necessarily friends (but knew from my DZ, just not extremely well) with that they pretty much ignored my existence even though I was 2 feet away.  On the subject of what you described though, I did start to notice some newer people (who had barely more jumps than me due to how many jumps they were doing compared to me each weekend) that they were doing some really asinine things (CRW for example). One nearly got himself killed and laughed about it.   It's not like you're downsizing to a high performance canopy. Depending on wing-loading, it's not necessarily a big deal to downsize to a frickin' 170. That's a dumb thing to scoff at someone over."

Stow your toggles and cinch up some coils of line in your hands until you get to the canopy. Here's the magic part. With the canopy hanging from your hand, Turn it until the nose is pointing up and is exposed.   That is where the air can get out.   Pat the side of the canopy until it starts to deflate.   It should only take 3 or 4 gentle pats with one hand.  It's turning the nose upwards that really does the trick. Grab the pilot chute and cinch  up the bridle all the way to the D-bag and hold it in the same hand you have your lines in. Finally, Walk back and manifest for another load."

It's exactly the same as NNick476 advised but here's my method.  Land.  Stow brakes.  Bundle up lines (no need to daisy chain, just make loops) until you get to the canopy.  Pick up canopy with right hand (also holding all the lines).  Grab left side of canopy with left hand and swing it over to the right.  You're basically turning your canopy 180 degrees until you're looking down your cells.  Then grab bridle, pilot chute, dbag, and the warning label.  Ta-DA!  looks at NNick476's comment Shit, I just basically retyped everything he wrote.  Ah well."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,jzzsxm,6,Tue Jul 14 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"Always stow your brakes after landing.  This keeps them from inadvertently twisting and shortening up the lines and thereby changing your flare point.  To deflate, I've always pushed the slider all the way down, loop the lines until your hand is against the slider and the line attachment points, then grab the dbag & pilot chute at the attachment point and pull it over the center cell at the tail.  This keeps the tail in check."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,SwoopnBuffalo,7,Mon Jul 13 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"Always stow the brakes. Otherwise they will entangle with other lines and twist (eventually risking tension knots if you don't untwist them. You need to do it regularly anyway, but not stowing accelerates the process greatly). Braid the lines. Make sure your coils are as high up the lines and you have pulled the canopy in as much as possible. Stop the last coil with the slider (if you pushed it up the lines after landing, again it pays to have your brakes stowed here) or with a little bit of canopy fabric or a tiny bit of the bridle. Not too much, or it will entangle and make you miserable during packing. Every centimetre of lines not coiled is a centimetre of slack for the fabric to catch air and drag on the ground. It pays off to be careful about the slider kill lines; if you let them get coiled in with the rest of the lines, it will prevent you from bunching up all the lines and the slider will be hard to reach to stop the last coil from unwinding. Grab it by the last coil (the one you just stopped with the slider). With the other hand, grab the bridle, coil it in the canopy hand (not daisy chain, just ordinary rope coils) until you have the canopy, the bridle and the pilot in one hand. If you did #2 right, the resulting balloon will be fairly compact already. Push the air out against your body, ball it up until it has no parts sticking out to drag on the ground. Throw the bundle over your shoulder OR tuck it in between the carrying arm and your body, assisting with the other hand. Personally I find the latter to be easier and overall less tiring. Grab the helmet, go to packing floor.   With the above and a bit of practice, I can successfully bring back anything from a Navigator 260, through Spectre 190, to my own Sabre2 170, with no dragging and no fighting the bundle."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,mathrick,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Daisy chaining, or braiding as you call it, introduces more wear on the lines than simply coiling them."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,nelish,5,Mon Jul 13 21:08:49 2015 UTC,"Dunno, you're the first person I've ever seen to claim that, and there's no load on those lines, so even if there is additional wear, I find it hard to believe it will be non-neligible. Making sure your lines are orderly and the canopy won't drag is more important for preventing wear, IMHO."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,mathrick,3,Mon Jul 13 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"Load isnt the problem, it is friction, primarily from slider grommets and brake line guide rings.  When you daisy chain the lines, you are by definition subjecting them to frictional wear as you loop one bight of line inside another.  Daisy chaining is fine for students so they dont make a mess, but an experienced skydiver should be able to simply coil their lines.  When you are jumping a canopy with thin lines that have a relatively short life span, you want to minimize unnecessary wear."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,nelish,0,Tue Jul 14 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"Load isnt the problem, it is friction, primarily from slider grommets and brake line guide rings.    Yes, exactly. Slider and guide rings during opening and flight, not daisy chaining it at the end of the jump.   When you daisy chain the lines, you are by definition subjecting them to frictional wear as you loop one bight of line inside another.   But friction is dependent on the load. The bights require almost no pull force to come undone, so also by definition they exert almost no friction against each other. That's why it's negligible. Spectra has such a lifespan that it really doesn't matter anyway (you only need to be careful about heat, and daisychaining generates none). And all the experienced jumpers I know flying swooping canopies with thin lines always daisychain their lines."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,mathrick,0,Tue Jul 14 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"Daisy chaining does not create enough friction or heat to cause any issues with wear.  Unless you are pulling the chain out fast enough to heat up the lines (not likely), the friction is negligible, probably no more than when you run the slider up the lines to pack.  Can you please show your reliable source which shows daisy chaining parachute lines can cause friction wear (a noticeable amount) from simply carrying it in from the landing area?  Or any manufacturer who has said this?  For the record, every manufacturer ships parachutes with daisy chained lines.  The proper way to store a parachute (as defined in The Parachute Manual and the FAA Rigger's Manual) is by daisy chaining the lines."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,floormonkey,0,Tue Jul 14 13:26:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with daisy chaining the lines. Just makes the carrying easier to not have coils of lines that I can barely hold with one hand.  The one thing I would point out though: always lock the daisy chain with your slider, not your canopy! I can see wear on my slider where I pull it through the daisy chain. Sliders are cheap. Canopies not so much."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,dbplatypii,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"Good point. I bring my slider down, so in practice I use the slider."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,mathrick,4,Tue Jul 14 06:35:53 2015 UTC,"I have a spectre 170 as well. I grab the tail, right where the manufacturer's label is and shake that once or twice to get air out before coiling the lines. I also always stow my brakes first, keeps the lines from twisting around, before doing anything else. Then shake the tail, un-collapse slider and push it down, coil,grab n go."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,TwirlyGuacamole,2,Mon Jul 13 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"I jump a Specter 170 as well and for the life of me I have no fucking clue.

SkyDiving,3d51lt,JStarx,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"Bundle up the pilotchute and bridle before you bundle up your lines.  This will cause it to deflate, especially if there is any wind.  This is the best way I have found, and I jump an airlocked canopy."

SkyDiving,3d51lt,HighTeckRedNeck13,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:44:00 2015 UTC,I've heard Brian Germain talk about them. He makes them I believe. It's my understanding that they eliminate the risk of a partial canopy collapse.
SkyDiving,3d51lt,JeromeMorrow13,0,Tue Jul 14 01:00:04 2015 UTC,"Brian was asked once on SkydiveRadio why he never made an airlocked tandem canopy.  His response was ""how good are your catchers?""    I don't jump an airlocked canopy, but I'm guessing if it's really windy, you might have to fight it more to keep from getting pulled around after you've landed.  I guess that's one downside."
SkyDiving,3d51lt,NNick476,2,Tue Jul 14 03:52:32 2015 UTC,"Here is what I do.  Once I've touched down and my canopy has stopped flying, I lay it down to the side.  That way I can watch the traffic on final, while still keeping an eye on my canopy.  If it is windy, I'll step on the bridle and gently walk towards the canopy, putting myself between the wind and the canopy.  If it is really windy, I'll walk all the way up, grab the bridle attachment point and pull it towards me.  Then I stow my toggles.  Stowing your toggles immediately helps minimize twists in your brake lines, so make sure to keep your hands in the toggles until you're stowing them.  Lastly I'll push the slider down while coiling the lines, taking care to keep the nose as out of the wind as possible.  Always watch for other traffic."

SkyDiving,3d3w24,Smith_One_,8,Mon Jul 13 08:57:47 2015 UTC,Two pieces are no good for the tunnel.
SkyDiving,3d3w24,pigheart,2,Mon Jul 13 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"2 piece suits will probably not work in the tunnel because the jacket will tend to come loose without a rig on your back.  Also a 2 piece suit will fit less tight than a 1 piece suit, which is an advantage if you do really advanced dynamic freefly stuff. For a beginner I would say, a really tight freefly suit is counterproductive - not meaning that a 2 piece suit is better than a 1 piece suit. Get a bit of a wider suit for the beginning - it will help you a lot and counting all the tickets and tunnel hours you will need to get where the fun really happens, getting a second, tighter suit when you need it will not really have any financial impact.  Obviously a 2 piece suit offers the possibility to jump without a jacket. Depending on where you live (or to be more precise how hot it gets in your area) you might wanna consider this option. Also this is the reason why I jump a two-piece suit. I do 90% workjumps, with very little time in between. Packingtime is a very important factor and when it gets extremely hot I prefer to take off my jacket while packing. If I was in a 1 piece suit I would not be able to do so in the same time, so therefore I prefer the seperate jacket.  Summarized - if you are a funjumper, get a 1 piece suit. If you would like to get into workjumps (video, tandem, etc.) get a 2 piece suit."
SkyDiving,3d3w24,Rackelhahn,0,Mon Jul 13 14:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I'm 100kgs/220lbs so i was looking at a bigger suit to increase my options with who i can jump with more comfortably (even as i work more on fast/slow fall). It does get bloody hot where i jump.  Thats the main reason i'm considering it, as long as any downside doesn't outweigh the convenience. I am working towards getting into camera flying but it is still a long way off. But being able to mix and match between freefly jacket and camera jacket eventually is definitely a plus. Thanks again!"
SkyDiving,3d3w24,westherm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"What's your body type, how much do you have to spend, and how serious are you about freeflying/tunnel?   If you're serious as in ""freeflying is what I want to do:"" The pervasive thinking (at least in the US) is dedicated one piece for freefly with no grippers. This is because grips are largely hand to hand or hand to foot, grippers represent drag, and serious freeflyers want to go to the tunnel (no two pieces happening there).  A shorty/supertight suit is going to be a lot faster than you are ready for but one change in material below that might be what is best for you if you are serious about freefly. I bought a tonfly uno.619 after about 50 freefly jumps. Its a tuned down version of the uno.618 for light-medium people/ expert freefly suit for medium-heavy built people; I am on the lighter side of medium. Before that I had a used firefly suit that was good for a beginner, but now serves as my belly suit.   Transitioning from the firefly to the tonfly was a difficult 3-5 jumps. It magnified bad habits I built in the firefly. Hell, the first jump in it felt like my eighth or tenth sitfly jump, I corked out two or three times because it was so sensitive. But it didn't take all that long to get used to it and now I have a way larger range in speed, both horizontal and vertical.  A new, top-tier freefly suit like a Tonfly or VerticalSuit is a serious piece of kit and will set you back $500-$1000. They are powerful tools and will speed up your learning and if you persevere. I know TonySuits is getting into the freefly game and LiquidSky suits are a little cheaper.   If you have reservations about the above or aren't that serious, do you and understand the shortcomings of grippers, old-style freefly suits, that you can't take your two piece into the tunnel."
SkyDiving,3d3w24,ChillinFallin,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input!   I'm 100kgs/220lbs (slowly dropping weight).  $$ isn't that big of a deal as long as i get something that works.  Looking to just start out in freefly and i've only done a bit of RW in the tunnel but once one opens close to me (later this year) who knows!  I was looking at possibly the multispeed suit from deepseed which is pretty big (compared to most freefly suits) and has zip out drag panels on the arms and legs.  I thought that could be beneficial to a heavy guy.  Do you think being able to unzip just the arms or just the legs be beneficial to learning how to freefly?    The only reason i was looking at the mini grippers was for possibly doing belly with slower people.  I'd like to be available for RW training jumps for newer jumpers as others were for me.  But i suppose if i have the panels zipped out into the baggy configuration they could just grab a hand full of suit.  Forgetting the stuff that applies to both 1 and 2 piece like size, grippers etc would you say that the main downfall of the 2 piece would be tunnel? (especially if i want to slow my fall rate)  Thanks again for the feedback, you have given me a lot to think about."

SkyDiving,3d2u5z,metaxzen,8,Mon Jul 13 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"BASE packs are all about symmetrical inflation starting with the center cell. A common way to help with that in a BASE pack is to roll the outside cells and have the center cell nose wrap around them. Probably hard to picture, but if you happen to see someone packing a BASE rig it'll make sense. Also, for slider down jumps, a tailgate is installed which wraps all of your control lines and center C and center D lines. This helps with heading tremendously.    With that being said, you can't really use these techniques on a skydive rig. I would just ask a local packer if they have any tips for creating a more symmetrical opening."
SkyDiving,3d2u5z,Herpes_hurricane,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know too terribly much about BASE, but I thought the tailgate mitigates tail inversion to prevent/reduce line-overs.

SkyDiving,3d2u5z,GenoPath1,2,Mon Jul 13 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"Sabre or Sabre 2?  My Sabres always opened on heading for me. My Sabre 2 opens and it is a roulette what way it is going to go. I have found that if I pack perfectly symmetrical and that if I deploy in a perfectly neutral body position it helps my Sabre 2 openings heading by it not dancing as much in the sky before it settles down to a given course. That said, the opening beats me to getting back to neutral most of the time so I have just about given up on ever getting on-heading opening on it. I plan on it and set my break away about 500 feet sooner than I really want so I can get more distance on my track and lessen the chance of a canopy collision."
SkyDiving,3d2u5z,brainstomp,2,Mon Jul 13 03:21:45 2015 UTC,I get my Sabre 2 to open on heading within 30 degrees each side by kind of following the method described in Herpes_hurricane's post about rolling away cells 1-4 and 6-9 and opening cell 5 right before I roll the canopy and put it down to squeeze the air out. It's not the only contributing factor though. Keeping lines symmetrical throughout the pack job definitely helps too.
SkyDiving,3d2u5z,the_anirudh,2,Mon Jul 13 06:16:33 2015 UTC,I used to do that with my Sabre 2 because that is exactly how I had to pack my Sabres to get gentle openings. I stopped doing it because it took me about 1300 feet to open the Sabre 2 using that method and that is just too damned long for my taste. I'll try it again on a hop and pop and see what comes from it.

I couldn't find a video to demonstrate but just before wrapping the tail around the front of the canopy (when pro-packing) you fold the nose of cells 1-4 and 6-9 then expose the centre cell nose. The idea is this forces all of the initial air into the centre of the canopy, keeping it symmetrical. It also slows down the opening depending on how much you fold them.  It's pretty much what happens here: https://youtu.be/tUvIKJcsN14?t=13m40s"
SkyDiving,3d2u5z,pulllow,2,Mon Jul 13 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see, so a specific variant of the old-school nose rolling? Sounds interesting, though I'm not sure I want to slow it down any more, it's got enough snivel as it is. Modern canopies in general are designed to open slowly enough without rolled nose, and rolling might lead to ""uncomfortably slow openings"" (as PD puts it), which in and of itself gives a very good chance of off-heading."
SkyDiving,3d2u5z,mathrick,2,Mon Jul 13 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Everyone I know who uses this method uses it specifically to slow down their openings. They don't really consider their opening heading.  Personally, I think there are too many variables on a skydiving rig which could affect the heading of the opening (compared to a base rig) so I tend not to worry about it too much. I just make sure I'm aware of how my canopy is opening when I pull and reach for the risers to correct."

When I started skydiving, I was in a PhD chemistry program, with all intentions of being a research scientist or maybe, if life got really crazy, I'd go into science policy. You just never know where one silly little idea will take you until you let it."
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,blueskieslara,3,Mon Jul 13 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"IMO the AFF course and subsequent jumps are heaps of fun and justifies the money and time spent on it regardless of weather you quit after 10 jumps, 100 jumps or never.    I think the time to sit down and think about weather the sport is for you in the long term is before buying gear.  Give it a go and you'll love it!"
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,Smith_One_,2,Mon Jul 13 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon for people to fade out of the sport, but it's hard to predict. You don't really have any experiences comparable to jumping out of planes, so you won't be able to guess how much you will like it as a sport.  AFF is a milestone already, after that it's not a bad idea to push yourself to A. If by the time you get A you need to push yourself still, it might be a phase. But it's a big sport with a huge social component, and not many people ever do it, so even if it turns out to be a phase, it will still be worth it. And if you buy used gear first, it will lose very little value if you decide to resell afterwards, so you don't take a big financial hit outside of what you paid for jumps themselves."
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,mathrick,3,Mon Jul 13 11:51:58 2015 UTC,Depends on where you are (and which rules are enforced at your DZ) you may have to jump at least once every 2 months to stay current. As for how often you're gonna use it that obviously depends on you however weather you've made friends or not at the DZ may be a big determining factor. Skydivers are generally very friendly and welcoming and if you put in a bit of effort you'll find yourself having a second family. Also the adrenaline and the views from the top are incredible so chances are you're gonna get hooked! TL; DR if you make friends you will probably stick around for a long while
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,mshashiOman,0,Mon Jul 13 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"When I passed my AFF, I though it would be like scuba diving. Whenever I would be close to a location, i would go for a jump and it would be crazy cheap compared to a tandem. That's not what happened ... I have not used my scuba diving license more than you have, but I have over 100 jumps now. To me the reason is that in skydiving you discover after the AFF the incredible amount of different stuff you can do. Jump with people, do relative work, learn free fly, canopy piloting, crazy stupid exits etc ... Each time you learn something new, you enjoy it for a while, get good at it and move to the next exiting thing you just learnt was possible. This process takes time and commitment and it's what I love about our sport, it's difficult to build up skill which makes it so much more rewarding when you finally do.   If you don't get hooked after AFF, you will still have learnt the incredible live skill of being able to survive getting thrown out of an airplane which makes it worthwhile !"
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,Brosy55,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:31:51 2015 UTC,I made it 3 years and just had to stop now. Not by choice but due to school and work. I work every weekend and my DZ only opens on weekends sooooo I'm out of the sport till I finish school and can switch my schedule back. I fully intend to go back.
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,chrizbreck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"I got my pilots license and only flew for a couple of years, probably won't do so again. Still absolutely happy I did - just the accomplishment itself was really enough for me.   I suspect I'd have similar feelings about the AFF course - just proving to myself that I can do it might be all the satisfaction needed."
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,elkab0ng,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:02:16 2015 UTC,Two years consistently then I moved to a city and it was more difficult to get out. Kept my license current for a few years after that.
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,dudethatsmeta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:17:51 2015 UTC,"I imagine it boils down to how much of your money you want to commit. Buying your own gear is really expensive, but it makes it easier to jump more often because you aren't paying for rental gear on top of jump tickets. You can get some decent gear off the classifieds on dropzone.com if you take your time and save some money. Another redditor that jumps where I live met up with me and gave me a bunch of advice that saved me a lot of money in the long run. I was prepared to buy new gear but that isn't really smart until you get off the beginner stuff and want to purchase a canopy you intend to jump for a while. Where I am I think they require you to jump once every 60 days. If it has been longer you do a refresher jump with an instructor, and honestly any time you jump with an instructor is a good thing when you are just getting into it. The biggest factor for me is how close there is a DZ and how often can I get out there. Being a nurse I put in a lot of weekends so that's a bummer. But, there are multiple DZ's within an hour of me, and at least 8 within a 4 hour drive, Texas is a big place."
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,LeftShark69,2,Mon Jul 13 00:38:01 2015 UTC,Where do you jump in Texas? I'm assuming fairly central if you have 4 DZs that close.
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,_LurkNoMore_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:36:20 2015 UTC,"I'm still a student. I live in Dallas but I am doing the AFF at Spaceland in Houston about 4 hours away. I guess I should say all within a 4-5 hour drive because some are a little farther (going by all the listings on dropzone.com). I would do AFF in Dallas but I was warned off it because it's constantly windy here (no student jumps if the wind is 14 mph or more, which it has been a lot lately) and can take a long time to finish. I don't live to far from SDD. Maybe 45 minutes at most."
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,LeftShark69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:47:03 2015 UTC,"Sweet! I need to venture up there and do some jumps. I'm closer to Austin but we have San Marcos, Lonestar, and Temple within an hour or two."
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,_LurkNoMore_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:02:56 2015 UTC,"Nice, I plan to travel around a little and check some places out when my gear gets here. Any place you recommend around Austin? I want to go jump at one of the DZ's on the coast as well. Houston is close, but I think there is one on Padre Island?"
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,LeftShark69,2,Mon Jul 13 10:14:21 2015 UTC,Padre has a DZ but it may be tandem only? Not sure. Of course Spaceland is a must because...well it's Spaceland. I have friends that bounce between Skydive San Marcos and Lonestar Parachuting Center and Skydive Temple is a great little 182 DZ.
SkyDiving,3d2ej3,_LurkNoMore_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:49:43 2015 UTC,Do I smell a road trip a-brewin? If so I would join.
SkyDiving,3d28dx,nikunjpatel11,2,Sun Jul 12 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"I recently finished AFF and am actively working towards my A license. I'm not an authority on the subject, but I'll try to answer some of your questions from my perspective as a student.   Once you complete your AFF, you will be able to solo jumpmaster while actively working on your A license at your DZ. However, you won't be able to jump other DZ's or jump with fun-jumpers until you earn your A license. That's the main difference on the surface. But that's just a tip.   You should be thinking of AFF/IAD/PFF as only the first stage in your skydiving career. As you go through AFF you will be ""learning to walk."" Throughout this process you will be discovering how much more there is to skydiving then you initially thought. The goal of AFF is to teach you the very basics of safe skydiving. You learn to maintain stability and heading in free fall, maintain altitude awareness, basic maneuvers and aerobatics and learn to identify malfunctions and go through emergency procedures. You will learn the basics about your rig, canopy control and landing. There is quite a bit more to it, but those are some highlights of AFF program.   25 skydives is one of minimum requirements to get your A license, but not the only one. Any documented skydive counts toward A license. This includes any documented tandem jump as well as all AFF jumps. However, you need to learn and demonstrate certain level of knowledge and skill before you can apply. In terms of freefall skills, you will prepare to skydive safely with groups of people. In order to do so, you will need to increase your general awareness, learn how to move, track, dock, adjust freefall rate, etc. You will also be learning more about canopy control, patterns, accuracy, new maneuvers, etc. You will learn how to pack your parachute and will go over your rig in detail as well as the rest of skydiving equipment, aircraft, emergency scenarios and procedures, hazard identification and evasion, etc. At the end you will have to pass a written exam and a check dive.   On a more personal note, learning is lots of fun and there is lots to learn. You will also get to know other people and you'll eventually want to jump with them. In order to do so, you'll have to learn how to do it safely first. It's a natural progression. I'm not sure what's the most cost effective approach, but the difference is really marginal when it comes to overall cost of skydiving. Skydiving is really expensive initially and there's no two ways about it. Even after you earn your solo cert, it won't actually get much cheaper as you'll be jumping more. The gear, maintenance and all the coaching jumps will cost $$$ as well. In addition, it will take a lot of your time as well (not just the time you spend at dropzone). So be prepared for this if you are serious about skydiving. Talk to other people at your DZ and your instructors in particular. Most importantly, stay safe and have fun!"
SkyDiving,3d28dx,spesic,2,Mon Jul 13 07:32:37 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. This was really helpful
SkyDiving,3d28dx,Noogiess,3,Mon Jul 13 10:56:51 2015 UTC,"It's an expensive hobby. You're squabbling about pennies. Just remember, your training is the difference between life and death. Don't rush it. AFF requires 25 jumps minimum, so those would count. Your proficiency card needs to be completed and could take you longer."
SkyDiving,3d28dx,metaxzen,2,Mon Jul 13 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"Noogless has some really good advice. Take your time, don't rush. I love skydiving but it costs all of the money you have (and then some.)   Don't forget... the 25 jumps are FUN! I loved jumping with my instructors and getting their knowledge. It made me a safe skydiver so I can enjoy jumping with my friends today. Every time I jump out of a plane is exciting... just enjoy the ride!"
SkyDiving,3d28dx,cptnpiccard,2,Mon Jul 13 01:42:09 2015 UTC,"There is no ""solo certificate"". Solo is just a category between ""jumping with instructors"" and ""having an A license"". Unless you completely graduate from the course and get an A, you will not be able to jump with anybody else other than an instructor in a recurrency jump."
SkyDiving,3d28dx,justlettinggo,2,Mon Jul 13 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"you sound like you're in Canada.  'solo' is just your period between no instructors and your A license. What it effectively means is you can self supervise. Meaning, they think you are competent enough to get your gear, do pre checks, gear up properly, ask for pin checks (I do it 3 times. Gear on, before boarding, before door) and your altitude aware and can land safely.  I did my A in 30 jumps. No rush to do it. Never rush to skydive."
SkyDiving,3d28dx,justlettinggo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"so basically I have to do my jumps after my solo, but before my A at the same location I did my pff/iad?"
SkyDiving,3d28dx,LeftShark69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:04:01 2015 UTC,Probably. It's really up to the dropzone you want to go to. Are you travelling and want to check out other DZ? Moving? Leaving the country?   You can do 25 jumps in a week....if you have the money
SkyDiving,3d28dx,LeftShark69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"I paid for an A license package all at once that included all the instructing, gear, and 25 jumps. Of course if you mess up a jump you are going to pay to repeat it. That included 18 instructor jumps instead of the 7 a lot of places offer for AFF. Good deal."
SkyDiving,3d28dx,justlettinggo,2,Mon Jul 13 00:47:01 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I can't find any place in my area (near the Toronto area) that offers A license packages. I feel like that would be a great deal
SkyDiving,3d28dx,Chift,4,Mon Jul 13 02:04:50 2015 UTC,"If you have the time check out Skydive Spaceland in Houston, Atlanta, or Florida. They do it in a week for $2400 after you do two tandems (2nd tandem is cheaper if you sign up right then.) People come there from all over the world to get their A because you can do it so fast. You can sleep in their bunk room if you don't want to pay for a hotel. They are absolutely awesome people."
SkyDiving,3d28dx,LeftShark69,2,Mon Jul 13 02:12:48 2015 UTC,Spaceland is awesome.
SkyDiving,3d28dx,Third-base-to-home,2,Mon Jul 13 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"I'm having such trouble finishing my IAD because of weather and the the dz is more of a tandem shop then anything else.  Are all spaceland created equal? I've also heard of chicago A in a week, and people have said Arizona.   Thoughts?"
SkyDiving,3d28dx,LeftShark69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:08:16 2015 UTC,"My only experience is with the one in Houston and it is top notch in my opinion so I imagine their other locations are similar. Atlanta just opened I think so it's a brand new DZ. I've never been to either Chicago or Arizona, but both are very popular from what I have read. It's friggin hot in Arizona this time of year. But hey, it's a dry heat lol."

SkyDiving,3czpkb,diplomatique008,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:11:58 2015 UTC,"I've never hiked Camelback so I didn't know if there was a trail map or anything similar to get to the Bobby's Rock exit point that Jeff jumps in the video I provided.  If not I was wondering if anyone could ""draw"" us a simplistic map of the path to take, maybe using Google Maps or something.  I think he wants to attempt it next weekend, I can find out and let you know."
SkyDiving,3czpkb,teamanalrape,2,Mon Jul 13 10:27:51 2015 UTC,Holler at Mike Mann on Facebag. Someone almost went in near Camelback after failing to find the right exit and hitting a ledge several seconds after jumping the wrong exit. Don't be that guy.
SkyDiving,3czpkb,mcstain,0,Mon Jul 13 14:26:41 2015 UTC,basejumper.com forums might be a better place to ask.
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,negative4productions,14,Sat Jul 11 14:59:53 2015 UTC,That was a shitty dock.
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,FanOfFalling,8,Sun Jul 12 12:36:53 2015 UTC,and that boys and girls is why you should have your hands on your rear risers ready to respond to shit like this.

SkyDiving,3cx0xs,jdoughboy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:39:42 2015 UTC,"I've only done one tandem jump, so forgive me if this is a stupid question. How long would you have to react to an emergency like this? I'm assuming that is his altimeter going nuts?"
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,freshmeat10,0,Sun Jul 12 00:12:16 2015 UTC,Just a couple of seconds depending on how aware you are of jumpers around you and if you could see it coming ahead of time. It would also depend on if his (video) canopy was inflated enough to even respond quick enough.
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,flyboy10029,-2,Sun Jul 12 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"Bingo. For the first second or two while mine inflates, I can't really turn since it isn't inflated as a wing yet. In this situation, he had maybe 2 seconds to react before they hit. They both should have turned left and they would have been fine. Normally you would make right turns to avoid things like this, but since they were already on the left they should have kept it that way.   I know you're experienced and know this, but I half chimed in on yours and answered the original question in one."
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,LeftShark69,3,Sun Jul 12 02:12:07 2015 UTC,Is that really acceptable to do? Everything i have always been taught is everyone go right. He hit the left side of the other canopy so I can't understand why you would say turn left when both turning right would have been easier. In my mind that is as bad as hearing the TCAS tell you to climb and deciding to dive instead. The other person isn't reading your mind. Accidents happen when people fail to follow the known rules in my opinion. This just looked shitty all around. It takes 2 seconds to even react in most cases and the collision seemed unavoidable.
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,reddit_user49,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:25:06 2015 UTC,"In hindsight, turning left was the correct thing to do.   In practice/safety/I have .3 seconds to make a decision turning right is the correct thing to do."
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,Gaboury,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:48:03 2015 UTC,"This right here.  You can't hope that everyone will always make the right decision under pressure/with no time to think.  That is why you do a right turn when you run into someone, no matter the offset."
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,flyboy10029,0,Sun Jul 12 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"I would discuss with an instructor if you have more questions because I'm just a guy on a computer. But in the slow motion, you can see that they aren't exactly head on. They are both slightly to the left. Since they're so close, If they both turn right then they would but each other, in my opinion. If they both went left, then they would have barely avoided each other.   Again, I wasn't there so every situation is different, but since they're both offset to the left, that's what I would have done. You are right though, most situations are a right turn."
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,LeftShark69,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I meant. They are both slightly to the left of each other (from each persons perspective) so if you both turn to your left hand they would have hit head on. I see what you are saying though. There are situations where always going right would just make it worse. I may just be overthinking what you are saying or something, I am still working on an A license so I barely know anything. It looks like the other guy had already started a turn to his right but it wasn't enough since the other guy probably didn't even have a chance to pull the risers."
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,flyboy10029,0,Sun Jul 12 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah skydiving is a dynamic environment so the answers always are a tad different. However, don't let me confuse you. If you have ANY questions, talk to your instructors at your DZ."
SkyDiving,3cx0xs,LeftShark69,0,Sun Jul 12 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"It's alright, I see what you're saying. i'm still trying just not to kill myself at this point lol. The last thing I want to see is another canopy coming at a high rate of speed towards me right now.   Edit - rewatched the slow motion and I think you are right. They start out where both turning left would have cleared. Looks like the other guy turned right though and cut right across him causing him to hit the left side of the oncoming canopy. Just happens so fast. Glad no one got seriously hurt"
SkyDiving,3cyopm,JeromeMorrow13,5,Sat Jul 11 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"As with any skydiving discipline its has its stages.   As you get more experienced you'll try out more advanced suits that all have their own learning curve to master. You'll start flocking and do a few rodeos here and there so there's always something new to do.   For me it was becoming a coach and then an AFF/I. When I was at a few hundred jumps I loved working with students to help them get better. There's nothing quite like the look on a students face when ""they get it."""
SkyDiving,3cyopm,freshmeat10,3,Sun Jul 12 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"Just a couple hundred jumps and you're in a slump?  Yeesh.   Are you doing only solos? I can't imagine at 600 jumps having any slump. But, then again, I jump with friends and we make magic in the air.   Maybe you should check out a new dz or make new friends to jump with?"
SkyDiving,3cyopm,alethiaja,0,Wed Jul 15 14:23:31 2015 UTC,I always jump with others. All types of people. What I'm experiencing is not unique when you look at the USPA numbers.
SkyDiving,3cyopm,alethiaja,5,Wed Jul 15 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"Tough break. C licensed and 600 jumps here and aside from getting in the tunnel, it's all I can wait to do next. Getting as many jumps as possible per month, and hitting every boogie.  Sorry, that's a shame to hear.  USPA numbers, though - that's where you lost me. You mean overall licensed skydivers in our sport? Or those who have let their licenses expire?  I think there are so many reasons people let it expire: family, deaths in the sport, money, injuries, etc.  Anyway - I hope you find some magic in it again."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,Akcis,3,Wed Jul 15 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. For me I hit the slump soon after my B licence. I still find jumps fun to a point, but I knew my motivation had gone.   I found paragliding and speed flying. I've not looked back since. It's horses for courses. Nothing lasts forever."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,SirRealle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:24:49 2015 UTC,Cool. I live in NYC. It seems like all the nice paragliding spots are out west. Any recommendations?

SkyDiving,3cyopm,oddchihuahua,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"To a whuffo, the idea that skydiving can become kinda boring sounds batshit insane. It's pretty funny.   I tried skydiving after doing glider flying and it felt boring for me right from the start. The only fun part was the split second I went out the door. Instead of flying I was now merely falling.  Anyway maybe that can work for you the other way around. Check out paragliding, sail plane flying or hang gliding. Step up from falling to flying."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,SpeedflyChris,2,Sun Jul 12 07:16:28 2015 UTC,Maybe consider speedflying? (If you have the slopes for it).  I've seen some badass speedflying videos where people pull off some unbelievably tight barrel rolls through tree and rock gaps.
SkyDiving,3cyopm,mathrick,2,Sun Jul 12 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"Second this. I do speedflying as well as skydiving, and speedflying wings are super fun. My sabre 170 doesn't exactly excite me when I'm doing this sort of thing on my wings."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,SpeedflyChris,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:16:59 2015 UTC,Sabre 170 is not an apples to apples comparison though. Velo 96 would be more like it.
SkyDiving,3cyopm,mathrick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"Fair enough but I'm not even C license yet (was speedflying before skydiving) so been warned off buying a stiletto, never mind a damn velo :P"
SkyDiving,3cyopm,TheSecretMe,-2,Sun Jul 12 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"Rightly so! Though it's important to note that Stiletto is not a swooping canopy, it has much too short recovery arc for that. Sabre2 is much better for that, because it has a steeper glide angle and thus a longer recovery arc. If you want to go swooping, Sabre2 is a good start. Learn to fly the shit out of it, then get coaching in swooping it. I fly Sabre2 170 myself, though it's a bit much for my pitiful canopy skills and I'll probably trade it for a Pulse."

SkyDiving,3cyopm,bjrn,2,Sun Jul 12 12:30:59 2015 UTC,"I love wingsuiting. It's pretty much why I started skydiving in the first place.  While wingsuit provides you with even more stuff to do (flocking, backflying, acro, performance competitions, headdown, carving, rodeos, XRW,..) at some point you'll hit such a wall again.  UNLESS you keep surrounding yourself with other wingsuiters, especially the ones that are far ahead of you and help push yourself to the limits and/or keep pushing yourself.  Don't just do it to increase your jump numbers, do it to increase your skills with each jump.  Though to be honest I only have 400 wingsuit jumps and there is still so much to learn for myself so for you it might take a lot longer to “hit the wall“ in wingsuiting."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,wingsuitpilot,2,Sun Jul 12 11:16:30 2015 UTC,"Wingsuit flying is awesome. But to me it's not only a journey, it's also a goal (practice for WS BASE) so that makes it much easier in case I am alone at the DZ. For the sport itself in skydiving it's only fun for me if there are other people around (except, as mentioned, if I practice for BASE)."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,Puntas13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"Fulfillment kinda doesn't even describe it for me. Being able to soar through canyons in clouds (while I've never busted any regs and would never think of doing it ever, promise), is just absolutely indescribable. The horizontal component of freefall opens so many doors, your head will spin. Maybe give it a shot since you're interested, make 10 or 20 flights, and if you're still feeling this way, nothing lost. But find a very good coach and be safe and responsible :)"

I'm on a 4 way FS team and our common goal of competing at nationals in addition to our very tight friendships has made the last two years in the sport my best--better than the 3 that came before it even. this sport is all about goal setting for me, so setting an ambitious goal and then doing the work to get there ""does it"" for me. YMMV"
SkyDiving,3cyopm,Second3mpire,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good idea, but I'm a weekend warrior who lives in the North East. So my jump window is somewhat limited, and I doubt that I'd have the time to join a team. However, I'll look into it. Thanks for the advice."
SkyDiving,3cyopm,bozethrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"You don't have to jump loads to be on a team. You have to find people with the same level of commitment, willing to put in approximately the same amonut of time, and share the same vision. You can always go to competitions and be happy with whatever place you get, if that is what gets you going.   Training together, with the same goals, makes skydiving much more interesting for me."

Might be worth a lawyer inquiring though. they might pay him something to go away.   http://www.nyccounsel.com/business-blogs-websites/who-owns-photos-and-videos-posted-on-facebook-or-twitter/  http://www.socialmedialawbulletin.com/2015/01/who-owns-your-instagram-content/

SkyDiving,3cuynr,showstopping,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"That's correct, but you would have to pay a lawyer to find out. Go Pro or BB may have actually gotten it from facebook. It would not be the first time. I doubt some IT person at BB was dumb enough to just do an image search and post the coolest pic he found. I didn't mention false advertising because your friend has no claim to it. Only someone who buys a session and doesn't get a quality picture like that. I don't know if your friend shot it in 4K (Which I don't think the 3 had) or if it was 1080p. The session has a max resolution of 1080p I believe so if he shot in 1080p you should get a similar result. I am not trying to rain on your parade, I think the entire thing is bullshit. He just isn't the first person this has happened to and I can't find any established case law where someone posting their stuff to the internet after agreeing to these ridiculous TOS actually won their case. Now if I upload a movie they will put me in prison, but other people feel entitled to steal from you because you engaged in their private service of your own free will under their terms. So far that's also been how the courts see it. If anything I guess your friend should feel honored that his pic is so fucking cool that someone did this with it. Maybe you can get them to take it down arguing it's false advertising, but I guarantee Go Pro will say the session is the same as the camera he used, just in a different case."

SkyDiving,3csz4e,brainstomp,4,Fri Jul 10 15:49:28 2015 UTC,"Had a student who would say all the right things and then do none of them.   She had done Cat A with some other instructors during the weekday I wasn't at the DZ. She never unstowed her toggles (claimed she had no idea what they were) and landed (poorly) in rear risers on the runway. Complained that flying the canopy was ""hard"" which was why she followed none of the radio commands, didn't fly a pattern, missed landing on the other plane by a few yards, claimed to not hear the radio well, etc.  The instructors re-reviewed her FJC training and she swore up and down that she knew to unstow the toggles but couldn't explain why she did not.  They gave her some solid reinforcement training on toggles, pattern, etc.  I showed up the next day (knowing none of this) and she was going on at length about how great her Cat A was, waiting to do Cat B.  She found out I was an instructor and wanted to jump with me, latched on to me like I was a life ring or something. She came off a little crazy-eyed but excited. The same two AFF-Is who jumped with her before were going again, and when I was able to peel her off of me for a few minutes, I got the 411 from one of them. Crazy-eyed indeed.  I'm running radio for her Cat B and now she has the toggles and still refuses to listen to the radio commands most of the time (she could hear the radio, I gave her 2-3 very specific sets of instructions to confirm that she was hearing me, not just coincidentally doing what I said).  She flies a completely opposite pattern to what was briefed & drawn on the DZ map/aerial, continues to fly downwind over the runway instead of turning base, then turns the complete opposite direction away from the landing area and toward a small water hazard off the DZ, and manages to land in the exact center of the water.  People ran out to me on the radio when they saw her doing a crazy pattern, thinking I had lost my mind and given her bad directions, but the coach standing with me confirmed that she was not following the instructions I was giving.  I'm calmly going ""turn left... Turn left... Pull down your left toggle...turn left"" and now she's going RIGHT.  After plucking her out of the water, and she's going ""wow! That was way better than the last one!"" and basically acting like the whole skydive was awesomely nominal and she did everything right, all of us refused to jump with her, period. The the DZO gave her the bowling talk."
SkyDiving,3csz4e,DiverDN,2,Sat Jul 11 13:03:36 2015 UTC,"Tell me - Was this in Indiana? If so, I think we might be talking about the same student!

I did that reference to Fandango."
SkyDiving,3csz4e,brainstomp,2,Sat Jul 11 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"No, not Indiana.    I think every DZ gets one of these dipshits every few years.    Place I started jumping at (static line ops, see my flair, lol) had a kid fly away from the DZ in a straight line on one of his freefall jumps. He landed in a damn cornfield like 3/4 of a mile east of the DZ, and when the chase crew got to him he claimed that his main had a ""built-in turn"" and that he ""couldn't find the DZ""    ""Built-in turn?"" they said, ""you were flying STRAIGHT away from the DZ. If you'd been turning at all, you'd have seen the DZ.""  We kind of chalked it up to him being a little jazzed up and all, whatever. Apart from some minor cornstalks in the gear, all was fine.  Very next jump, he goes up and pulls at like 1500 ft.  I was out there watching and it was very clear he'd blown his pull altitude (3500 ft) and then his ""reserve decision height"" (2500 ft) and we're all going ""Sweet jesus, son, hit the reserve!""  Finally, he pulls at what is causally estimated at 1500 ft, based on the fact that after he was open and did his controllability check, he made literally ONE turn on that big ass Manta 288 to put himself on downwind.  A couple of our S/L JMs walk across the runway to meet him in the student landing area, and he comes back across with them all hepped up and talking about how awesome he did on his jump and everything was perfect (I had ~150 jumps at this point, and I'm looking at the JM's faces alongside him as they are shaking their heads like ""What. A. Fucking. Idiot."")  He walks into the building to drop his main, and the DZO's wife, from behind the manifest desk,  says ""Drop your shit there, take off that gear, and GET THE FUCK OFF THIS DROPZONE AND DON'T EVER COME BACK."" (I'd jumped there almost 2 years and never heard this woman say a bad word, let alone swear)  ETA: I forgot to mention that this DZ had Sentinel MK2000 AADs, and we were constantly warned as students to not pull low due to the high potential for 2-outs. We were told they were set for 1500 ft AGL, plus or minus 1000 ft, or something like that."

Ten jumps in and stuck at AFF3.  He couldn't fly a remotely decent pattern, had trouble pulling on time, and kept eating shit on landings.   I guess the DZO eventually figured that it was going to end badly, and that the man was on borrowed time."
SkyDiving,3csz4e,JeromeMorrow13,3,Fri Jul 10 20:30:32 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, a DZO/AFFI once stuck with a guy through 23 jumps JUST to complete AFF.  I was impressed at her dedication.  I guess he finally got it, just had a habit of locking up and acting on instinct (wrong instinct).  I remember one time we were coming up on clouds at 7500 feet, fine for me and everyone else.  Comfy hop n pop with a decent delay.  She had to leave holding onto him to keep him stable."

It took them about 12 weeks to get my altimeter back to me; well into the season. I ended up buying a replacement while it was away for so long, as my backup altimeter sits on my left hand, where my cameras sit on tandem jumps. I was losing money, so had to go with another company for a new digital. Now that my n3 is back though, I still use it as my primary. My altimeter came back with all the jumps it was sent in with, so I wasn't stuck with a full replacement or anything either."

SkyDiving,3crrt8,icydocking,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:01:59 2015 UTC,i meant that my skydiving experience now is a few hundred jumps.  i've tried base once (just the fjc)  I haven't really thought about competing... It hasn't seemed that attractive to me but maybe worth another look. I also just really like the feeling of dead air and the acceleration of falling. Airplane exits aren't the same.
SkyDiving,3crrt8,ordinarybolt,2,Fri Jul 10 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's funny how the lines you draw for yourself early on tend to shift a little as you gain more experience and understanding in this sport. You just have to keep pushing forward safely if it's something you truly want to do. Come to terms with your realization that you are aware of your change in attitude and boundaries. Use that to keep yourself in check. The most dangerous people out there are the ones that don't know how dangerous they are. I'm not saying that simply being aware of the dangers is going to help you be safer, but it's going to keep things in perspective and require more thought when it comes to pursuing your dreams. In the end all you have is yourself so don't cut yourself short."
SkyDiving,3crrt8,Gigniotron,2,Fri Jul 10 13:21:52 2015 UTC,"I kinda was the opposite. Ive wanted to base since jump 50. Talked to the locals often about it, started packing base rigs around jump 180, and here i am at jump 340 and still havent base jumped. There are an abundance of experienced base jumpers at my home DZ to learn from and jump with. And still havent started. The biggest reason is that when i take my fjc, i want to buy a base rig then and there so i can stay current throughout the season and make a strong foundation of skills my first year. Maybe next spring ill start, maybe the spring after. All in good time. Base will always be there when i choose to start.   Maybe not the answer you were looking for, but its how i look at things for myself. I think being honest with yourself is key here. If you feel you're ready, then start down that road. If you ever find a point along the way that tells you to stop or take your time, then you should probably listen."
SkyDiving,3crrt8,ZLVe96,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"BASE is as dangerous as everyone thinks skydiving is.  It has come a long long way, but the truth is those guys die a lot.  If you are talking wingsuit BASE....that is even more true.   The new, experienced, conservative and aggressive....it doesn't seem to matter, their risk has proven to be significantly higher than say skydiving.  Everyone sets their limits and accepts a degree of risk.  All of these sports and activities have a risk/reward equation.  You have to find where that is for you.   The proxy base videos make my heart race.  I can't imagine what that must feel like in person.  It has to be like getting laid, when you've only made it to 2nd base before.  But for me the risk/reward equation is out of wack.  Like you mentioned, every year we lose tenured/experienced/badass pilots..."
SkyDiving,3crrt8,LeftShark69,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:48:42 2015 UTC,"When they release skydiving fatality info do they just lump all forms including BASE and proxy in with everything else to come up with their # of incidents/so many jumps or do they separate it all out? Sorry not trying to be confusing. Basically I am asking if just plain skydiving is much safer than the statistics show (which indicate it's pretty safe considering you are jumping from an airplane) or are they accurate? I used to be a flight paramedic and sometimes stats are misleading. Medical helicopters crash at a much higher rate than just about anything else that flies. It's the nature of the business landing in the dark with power lines, news helicopters, and tons of other shit that can kill you. Flying on a airliner, according to the statistics, is safer than driving a car. Flying on a medical helicopter, not so much. But they just lump it all together and say ""flying is very safe"". Which is true, unless you are hanging under some rotors beating the air into submission."

One of the most recent on the list at the minute was a guy on his second wingsuit jump.  With regards to taking a break, I don't think that's necessary, but I think certain people (and I'd class myself as one of these) become comfortable with environments very quickly, and very quickly you're finding that very dangerous situations are not far outside your comfort zone.  It's just something to be aware of, it's not BASE, but I had a not-insignificant crash on speedflying trip in the alps a few weeks back, it was about a week into the trip and I'd just got a bit too comfortable with things and wound up flying myself into a corner in bumpy afternoon conditions amongst some pine trees. Canopy clipped a pine tree at great speed and threw me into the next one. If not for that catching my canopy I'd have taken a 40+ft fall and might well not be here. That was a pretty fucking humbling experience and I only wish I'd recognised (as I now do from looking at my video) that I was cutting myself smaller and smaller margins every time until at some point disaster was inevitable.  Nobody thinks it will happen to them, and I think it's very easy when you're surrounded by people who base jump or swoop or whatever to think that risks are less significant than they really are, and it's easy to convince yourself that you're doing a good job of managing your risk when really you're just being lucky."
SkyDiving,3crrt8,Denyborg,0,Fri Jul 10 17:55:29 2015 UTC,You'll probably die.
SkyDiving,3crrt8,SirRealle,0,Fri Jul 10 15:41:32 2015 UTC,"Weren't you told during your FJC for BASE that you'll probably die doing this? What you're going through is really determining if BASE is right for you, and deciding that it is. We all go through that. If you are finding yourself getting too conservative and want to stay safe, stick with skydiving and paragliding. If you want to have more fun, keep BASE jumping. Just remember that you'll probably die doing this, but let's just make it through this next jump and think about that later."

SkyDiving,3cslo9,SkyMannn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"One of the cadets said they flat pack the Navigators because they're huge, and it's easier to pack them that way. The guys with the 7-cell accuracy canopies pro pack like most of us.  They don't bother me too much, besides the West Point students taking up extra space packing. West Point and tandems keep our planes funded.  Since I started coming to the Ranch 8 years ago, the ticket prices have only gone up from $23 to $25 for us fun jumpers. Tandems have gone up from $189 to $219 for the jump and from $89 to $119 for video.  If we go by inflation, the current prices should be $28.67 for a fun jump, $216.77 for a tandem, and $102.08 for tandem video."

I was just there for my C2 and D1 Saturday, and I was able to get both jumps in before lunch time on loads 2 and 5 despite it being quite busy.

SkyDiving,3cnsjc,mathrick,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"I'm still a student so better to ask the people here with a lot more experience for a better answer. Here is what the USPA safety quiz says, although it's a somewhat different scenario because you would be at terminal velocity in their scenario, not leaving the plane.   ""After initially losing track of your altitude during a belly-to-earth solo skydive, you check your altimeter and see that you are passing through 1,600 feet. Your rig is equipped with a modern, electronic automatic activation device. You decide to: Immediately pull the reserve ripcord.""  ""Correct - It takes you two seconds to locate and pull the reserve ripcord, which begins your reserve deployment at 1,250 feet. You are under a fully inflated reserve at 900 feet. Because you practiced emergency procedures and were prepared to go straight to the reserve in the case of a total malfunction, it saved you precious seconds and allowed for a higher reserve deployment than those who chose to cutaway first. However, any delay in a decision of whether or not to go straight to the reserve can lead to a lower deployment altitude. You land uneventfully in a clear area. The Skydiver's Information Manual lists pulling the reserve ripcord without first cutting away as one of the two acceptable responses to a total malfunction.""  So not the same scenario, but the altitude is close to the same. All the teaching I have had so far is initiate EP's by 2000 feet if you have a malfunction. So if i had to leave the plane at say 1500 feet I would go straight to the EP's and pull the reserve. Hopefully I have understood that correctly."
SkyDiving,3cnsjc,rdesktop7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"It opens faster, and you're looking at a situation in which AAD has very good chances of firing your reserve for you, so you're additionally looking at a likely two-out situation. In that case rather than wasting time on the slower main, you just cut to the chase and open the reserve directly."

SkyDiving,3cnsjc,Davis660,2,Fri Jul 10 08:26:17 2015 UTC,"Yes.   The reserve pilot chute has this large spring in it to help it get out into the airflow faster.   The reserve slider has a hole in it so that it captures less air, and lets the reserve open faster.   Then, the packers of the reserves are rather more meticulous than are the main packers.   From 2k AGL, the main would probably open well enough, but the reserve is designed to open well in a compromised state, so, in a emergency, I'll go for that.    Does that explain it well enough?"

SkyDiving,3cq53v,Chix_n_waffs,5,Thu Jul 9 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"Both have good AFF programs, and you'll get a good education and learn to be a safe skydiver at either.  Having said that, there are a few differences between the two.  Jumptown is a club, run by its members.  Pepperell is... well, it's a business.  It's about tandems first, fun jumpers second.    One illustrative story of many - at a Pepperell boogie a few years ago, I had brought in a bunch of my friends in from out of town and was organizing a smallish (6 way) wingsuit jump.   After the plane had fully loaded, including seatbelts, the manifest lady came running out to tell us ""wingsuiters have to get off the plane.""  When I complained to her that we had properly manifested, etc., I was told ""[DZO name] wants to put up tandems.""  We had to get off so they could put a bunch of tandems out.  I refuse to bring friends there again...  The fun jumpers at Pepperell are nice, friendly, and care about students.  The management... different story."
SkyDiving,3cq53v,skwrl71,2,Fri Jul 10 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Wow - removing fun jumpers from a load is a huge no-no if they're properly manifested.

I haven't had any trouble getting at least two student jumps in on a good-weather day, even when they're busy. Often I could do 3, but I'm usually exhausted (mentally) by that point.  Everyone is friendly, and chill. Music plays in the hangar, big comfy couches for lounging, and a club house for hanging out after hours. They have a bunk house for 15$/night if you want to stay at the DZ.  The DZ is quite large, with a nice big landing area just for students and Class A jumpers.  If you live in Boston, PM me. Maybe we can share a ride."

Many drop zones offering beach jumps have been requiring a C license in the past year, btw. Even though you get water training at B, they are requiring C because you get the increased targeted landing practice at C that is good practice for landing on narrow strips of sand and/or not overshooting and landing in a deadly, boulder-y whirlpool (Puerto Rico hazard!)."

Chance are you will learn alot and maybe even make a friend :).  Second I don't really feel I have the expertise to give you an answer on that, and it would be foolhardy to claim otherwise. Pull, Pull on time, and Pull stable are tenants for a reason. Those reasons are, that you are more likely to be killed/hurt from a lowpull incident. I have friends who during aff pulled during crazy spins. Luckily they were very lightly loaded and had plenty of altitude to deal with it and kick out of. Altitude is a finite and quickly diminishing resource. Think about it, if you pull low and are too low to safely cutaway you gotta ride the fucker in. Or you try to cut away and don't have the altitude so you go in. Are there people who have survived because they did x instead of y. Yes there always will be. But your pull priorities are very important. They are what will keep you safe. A Instructor/Coach can probably explain it much better, and in the right manner so be sure to check everything you read."

It's your life in your own hands and you need all the information you can get.   Can you ever be spinning so fast that pulling makes it worse somehow?   Happened to me on my 7th AFF where I pulled on time, but was unstable (spinning fast). Couldn't kick out of violent line twists by 2800', knew I wouldn't by 2500' (hard deck) and commended emergency procedures and landed uneventfully after that. You should be able to resolve any unstability within 5 seconds by the time you finish AFF no matter what."
SkyDiving,3clc59,funjumper,6,Wed Jul 8 23:53:21 2015 UTC,Your AFF instructor probably asks you what your pull priorities before each jump....  In case he/she doesn't.    1) Pull 2) Pull on time 3) Pull on time while stable
SkyDiving,3clc59,seebro9,0,Wed Jul 8 20:47:11 2015 UTC,1) Pull  2) Pull at the correct ALTITUDE  3) Pull while stable Right out of the SIM. I hate to be that guy but I wouldn't risk the chance of confusing a student with the terms time or altitude.
SkyDiving,3clc59,ChillinFallin,4,Thu Jul 9 16:07:54 2015 UTC,Never sacrifice altitude for stability.
SkyDiving,3clc59,Gosh-Darnit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"Note: I made this reply mostly to test my own knowledge recollection. For the love of god, read the SIM, take the online USPA course, and listen and ask questions of your instructors.  Also, don't feel bad for failing these quizes. There's a lot of information to remember and memorize. Just keep going over the material until it's second nature. Your instructors will also be there to keep pop quizzing you over and over.   Do I deploy chute even if I'm not stable at desired height?   Pull priorities: 1. Pull, 2. Pull at Altitude, 3. Pull at Altitude while Stable  Pulling while unstable will increase your chances of a malfunction, but you are still very likely to have a clean deployment. Do not spend waste your time trying to get stable while you are inexperienced.   What if I'm violently spinning?   That would be a very good reason to pull before you black out. Although, keep in mind that the AFF course is designed so that instructors will ideally prevent this until you are ready to control yourself.  When you move to your C jumps, your instructors will probably tell you to pull if you are not altitude aware, or if you are not in control.   How can I guarantee my reserve is not going to malfunction?   Reserves are packed by specially trained and certified riggers. It's a five hour long process that is meticulous and thorough. Do not worry about the packing as long as the packing card is up to date, and the rigger seal is there.  During your gear check (which you will start to do during your C or D jumps) check all components of the cutaway and reserve system (checks of threes, and the top-down back-front checks). You will check a lot of things, too many things for me to want to list here because I'm lazy.   What if an unexpected gust of wind happens at low altitude, can my canopy collapse? What do I do if that happens?   Gusts, turbulence, and the like can happen. Gusts aren't so bad since it's very unlikely to gust in the opposite direction of the current winds. But sometimes it can blow downwards, or turbulence can mess things up. Know how to spot likely turbulence areas (within 10x the height of a building/trees/big obstacles, or over ground areas with more or less heat [ie black runways will get a lot hotter than the grass, and make a convection current]). If you do get caught in this, you should be ready to flare and PLF properly. It might be a rough landing, but you'll probably be OK.  If your canopy collapses for whatever reason below 2500ft (decision altitude), and you are worried that it will not reinflate, deploy your reserve without cutting your main.   HOW DO I KNOW WHEN TO START EMERGENCY PROCEDURES?   Are you above 2500ft? If not, and you cannot land with your current canopy, deploy reserve without cutting away.  If yes, then you can perform Emergency Procedures. My AFF groundschool taught us ""Is it there? Is it square?"". ""It"" being the canopy. If one of these is not true, you will want to do Emergency Procedures. This breaks malfunctions into two categories: high-speed, and low-speed. Low-speed malfunctions are nice because you will likely have plenty of time to assess the situation. High-speed malfunctions should mostly be dealt with by reflexes in the form of emergency procedures.  So, a locked container (canopy does not come out of bag), it is not there, perform EP. Line over malfunction (line(s) are tangled over canopy), it is not square (because lines are tugging at canopy), perform EP.  However some malfunctions will have you spend 2 seconds (if you have altitude) to fix or escape the malfunction. Like a horseshoe malfunction (part of canopy is out, but pilot chute is stuck to you/rig), it is not there, but you should try for 2 seconds to throw your pilot chute before performing EP. There are some others too, but the end result is still: If it is not there or it is not square, perform Emergency Procedures!  You deploy, and your lines are twisted (like on a swing set). You look up, and the canopy is there, and square. Because it is there and square you have time to figure the situation out. This happened to me on my jump before last. After making sure the canopy is OK, check altitude, and start to undo the line twists. Check Altitude every few seconds while you undo the line twist. Finish undoing the line twists, realize you're a bit dizzy because you weren't doing a ballerina head turn, and enjoy the rest of the flight down.   I'm honestly terrified I'm going to kill someone. This is why I'm asking the internet.   Your logic is slightly flawed...  Also, your instructors will go over this stuff over and over until they know you have it by heart. And then they'll quiz you again and again after that.  When you do your first jump (assuming you haven't already) you are going to feel so good when your canopy deploys correctly.  Take the USPA online ground course, and read about half of the SIM before you start AFF groundschool (if you read too much you will get ahead of yourself and overloaded with info). This helped me immensely. I'm assuming you haven't started groundshcool.  bonus edit: If you have spare funds, splurge for 15 minutes in a wind tunnel with an instructor. It will help immensely when it comes to controlling your freefall."

SkyDiving,3ciwd8,NotSoDutch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:31:43 2015 UTC,"I jump at Spa in Belgium, pretty big and lots of tandems. Around 28 loads a day, 10 people per load. It's the only USPA you'll find around this region.  I've heard very good things about Hoevenen, next to Antwerp, especially for freeflying.  Teuge is probably the biggest one in Netherlands.  If you have at least A license then you just need your logbook, license and third-party liability insurance (usually provided by your country's federation/license, but I think USPA doesn't). AAD is always obligatory and I think RSL too. If you have less than 200-500 jumps and you have a high wing load I'd make sure they would let you jump such load, in Netherlands they tend to complain about that."

SkyDiving,3cdzl7,nmoat,6,Tue Jul 7 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend that you talk to the experienced people at your DZ about this. Your instructors know you and can probably give you more tailored advice. Ask what they jump, and why.  What have you been jumping so far? What have you thought of that gear? How many jumps do you have? I assume you're probably under 50, is that correct?  Basically, as long as your rigger clears your first container, you'll be alright. Maybe you won't be freeflying in it, but pretty much anything being sold is still airworthy (of course, have a trusted rigger inspect it to make sure!). You'll just want to make sure it fits you reasonably well and that it holds the size of parachutes you want.  You'll probably want a more rectangular canopy as your first -- elliptical canopies tend to perform more aggressively."
SkyDiving,3cdzl7,nmoat,0,Tue Jul 7 04:48:11 2015 UTC,i have 90... i've just been renting from the DZ.  Started with a 260 and worked my way down.  I've done 3 canopy courses.  I'd prefer to get something I won't need to upgrade for a while.
SkyDiving,3cdzl7,the_anirudh,2,Tue Jul 7 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer to get something I won't need to upgrade for a while.   I'll caution you that downsizing is never necessary. However, I understand the desire to move to faster parachutes so that's all I'll say about that.  You said in another post that you're 175 pounds. Assuming 25 pounds of gear and clothing weight, that puts you at 200 pounds at exit. According to Brain Germain, you should have 140 jumps to jump a 170. Personally, I violated that chart, and I know many others who have as well. But you should definitely approach a 170 with caution.  Anyway, as far as types of parachutes go I still think the best thing to do would be to talk to people at your DZ.  Here's a good video by John LeBlanc of PD that could help influence your decision.  Personally, I jump a PD Pulse because of the consistent, quick openings and the good glide ratio. I'm not interested in aggressive canopy piloting, so the firm front riser pressure and short recovery arc don't bother me."

SkyDiving,3cdzl7,sleepnap,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:31:49 2015 UTC,"After three courses you really should have at least an inkling of what differences there are between canopies and whom to ask...  Basically, the shape, together with the wingloading, determines the handling of a canopy and its innate flying characteristics. There's more to the shape than elliptical/rectangular, and each canopy has a specific trim which gives it the desired characteristics it was designed with, but there are some general trends:   9-cells have a flatter airfoil (because there's more fabric to keep it in shape), which (usually, but not always) gives them higher performance thanks to the better aerodynamic properties of a more exact wing shape. They will often fly faster and have a more powerful flare. 7-cells have thicker airfoils (because there are fewer ribs to hold the same area in shape, so the cells have to be comparatively taller when seen from the front), less able to hold the exact aerodynamic shape. They generally have a weaker flare, but less aggressive handling and much more predictable, forgiving openings. Square/rectangular planform means all cells have the same shape and dimensions. The canopy's outline is much like a mattress. It will be less sensitive to inputs, but also to malfunctions. Elliptical/semi-elliptical/lightly/strongly tapered means the cells get progressively shorter going from the centre to the outside. This gives a zippier canopy that flies faster and reacts more immediately to inputs, but also requires proportionally more skill to land safely and more easily develops instability and malfunctions in situations that'd be minor nuisances otherwise.   Those are the general trends, and there are more parameters, such as flat/steep glide and short/long recovery arc, toggle and riser pressure, etc. What you really should be asking is ""what do I want out of a canopy?"", and then talk with trusted people to determine what suits you. John LeBlanc has an excellent lecture about the two basic types of people who fly parachutes an how their needs are satisfied by different classes of canopies. Watch it, then talk with your instructors and rigger."

SkyDiving,3cehi2,sleepnap,12,Tue Jul 7 07:39:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks about free fall as the major risk in skydiving, but in reality when you're just starting out its the landing that will mess you up. Panicking on final, not flying a conservative and well planned landing pattern, flaring too high/early/not at all are much more common and likely than experiencing a major equipment malfunction. These can end in just grass stains or broken bones or even death. Just pay attention to your instructors and leave yourself plenty of room for error."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,grives,5,Tue Jul 7 10:57:03 2015 UTC,"Listen to your AFF instructors. They will teach you everything you need to know to become a safe skydiver. They are better qualified to answer your questions than people on Internet forums.  Skydiving is dangerous. However, other sports like motorcycle racing, mountaneering or scuba diving can be just as dangerous, if not more:  http://www.skydivemag.com/article/how-dangerous-is-skydiving  There are also a number of factors that can further increase the risk:  http://www.skydivemag.com/article/skydiving-and-risk  Also, read the USPA accident reports:  http://www.uspa.org/USPAMembers/Safety/AccidentReports.aspx"
SkyDiving,3cehi2,the_strykr,3,Tue Jul 7 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"Well if you want to avoid injury and be safe in jumping at all times, stay on a 1:1 wing loading and don't jump in winds more than 15mph, or have to do crosswind landings, or in winds less than 5mph. Also no wingsuits or situations where you may not be properly oriented at pull time. If you're not willing to accept fair portion of risk then maybe this sport isn't for you. In my opinion you can't throw blanket stats down even though people love to. Such as the 1 in 1000 skydives will be a cut away on average. Think of it like riding a motorcycle. You can choose to putt around on your moped in full street racing leathers, or you can get a street bike and proper training and have more fun... But also accept more risk. And then there is a step further where you swoop and only jump small high performance canopies or jump big wingsuits."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,Monolithic,4,Tue Jul 7 09:21:57 2015 UTC,"Everybody I ever know who got killed skydiving did so because they got complacent. ""Just another load"" as they walked toward the plane led to a momentary lapse and they bounced.   Everybody I know who's gotten hurt really bad skydiving did so because of the complacency, above, or they over-estimated their ability to handle a given situation. On the latter point: Of course we have to push ourselves (to not do so leads to complacency anyway) but to go from landing on the tarp 8 times out of 10 to landing a swoop between powerlines -- that's a stretch.   Keep your head in the game, be ready to say ""no"" and you'll be fine.   Come to think of it that's good advice for life."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,JoePants,5,Tue Jul 7 13:30:28 2015 UTC,"It's about 1 death in 100.000 jumps and the statistic has hardly changed since the 80s. It won't get safer. People used to die due to shitty equipment, now they die because of high performance landings.   Skydiving is as safe as you make it. It sounds stupid but it's true. You will learn all about what it means to be safe, you can then make your own decisions.   Of course you can never be 100% safe, you are jumping out a perfectly good airplane with only a little bit of fabric to save your life."

SkyDiving,3cehi2,rolinrok,3,Tue Jul 7 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"Minor injuries are fairly common, serious injuries slightly less common, life-ending injuries less.   Purely anecdotal but if someone tells me they've been jumping regularly for any amount of time (>5 years or so) and have never had any injury, it's kind of unusual. I'm talking injuries that require at least a little bit of rehab - torn ligament, broken ankle. The vast majority of people I know who have been jumping regularly for longer than 10-ish years has broken something skydiving - a wrist, a femur, a vertebrae, a life.   I know three people in wheelchairs and one who uses one sometimes - I believe all four were BASE injuries though. Can't think of anyone who put themselves in a wheelchair from skydiving alone. Wait, no -- I watched a friend turn himself into a paraplegic in a skydiving competition so that's 4 wheelchair-bound folks I know.   Bottom line - skydiving is legitimately more dangerous than almost any other sport I can think of besides BASE jumping. For most of us, the reward outweighs the risk. For the majority of humans, the reward is nowhere near as high as the risk."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,blueskieslara,2,Tue Jul 7 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Best advice is to leave your ego behind when you go to the DZ, if you are unsure if you can handle the ground wind don't jump, if someone with more experience is giving you advice take the time to listen, if you are unsure about anything don't hesitate to ask for a second or third opinion."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,shanemitchell,2,Tue Jul 7 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"Everything already said is very valid. Especially the part about people are more likely to get hurt under a perfectly working canopy these days rather than some sort of equipment failure. Another good tip is watch the old guys. I mean the ones on the big parachutes and the grey hair. If they have frap hats even better :-) They have been around along time and they are still here. If they are pulling off loads or deciding that something is just not right with the weather, I would listen."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,calderc,0,Tue Jul 7 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that you will probably be on radio for your first jumps. So they will guide you in on landing. Once you've landed a few times safely, you will stop worrying about this and get a little more reckless. That's where it's really dangerous. So... don't do that.  Injuries happen. You can deter them by listening to your instructors and radio operator, following your landing pattern, drilling through your safety procedures when landing, and practicing your PLF.  My first two landings were a bit rough. I scraped my hand up on the ground. But nothing serious. I PLF'd correctly each time and it was actually quite gentle.  After that it has been very easy to have stand-up landings.  You'll do great!"

It's better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air than in the air wishing you were on the ground. From personal experience, trust me, it is so true."
SkyDiving,3cehi2,flyboy10029,-1,Wed Jul 8 00:13:23 2015 UTC,Could you tell me about your experiences?
SkyDiving,3cehi2,flyboy10029,0,Wed Jul 8 02:24:38 2015 UTC,"I don't want to get into too much detail, but I was a low number jumper who went on a 6 way jump with inflatable pool animals. Long story short, turned into a zoo dive and there was a pretty close call with a guy in freefall and one under canopy. It was most likely unrelated to the inflatables, but it was a zoo dive and it was just bad. Trust me, most of us stopped jumping for the day.   That's just an example. I only have a low number of jumps so take what I have with a grain of salt, but those are two pieces of advice that I have gotten that have really stuck with me. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions."

SkyDiving,3cbtff,ChillinFallin,0,Mon Jul 6 18:50:14 2015 UTC,I fun jump there when I am down for vacation.  I would absolutely recommend it for tandems.  Beautiful beach views in the air and under canopy.  They are accommodating to fun jumpers which is sweet but you won't find too many fun jumpers there.  Staff is friendly and will fun jump with people if they are free.  Don't have my logbook in front of me but they had a nice twin engine turbine that seated like 12 or so.  Really nice big door.
SkyDiving,3cbtff,mds5118,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"Not a regular, but I just did a fun jump there this Saturday while I was up there on vacation for the 4th. I highly recommend it, I felt very welcome the staff seemed like a really great group, they made sure I had someone to jump with, got me on a load, etc etc. If I could have stayed and jumped all day I certainly would have. As far as safety everything was top notch, as a fun jumper I got a full brief on the landing pattern, winds, spot, etc. and I noticed all the tandem students getting a full brief of everything they need to know as well. The tandem instructors all seemed really nice and all the students on my load seemed to have a great time.   Edit to add: They have a caravan and the view is amazing."
SkyDiving,3cbe7w,brainstomp,3,Mon Jul 6 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"The code required to do what you need is very basic with a simple ATMega328 and a BMP085. The cost (including a 1x2'' two layer board, micro SD socket, button cell battery holder, USB socket, etc) would be under $15. For another ~$5 you could add a simple port and have a removable LED indicator wire. I'd do that instead of relying on a small company to create and support an API for a non-existent market."
SkyDiving,3cbe7w,teamanalrape,0,Mon Jul 6 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"I second this. The other benefit to having a custom device that does 'just logging' is that I don't have to trust my life to my own coding mistake. Who cares if i mess up a few jump logs, but I want that altimeter to work 100% of the time."
SkyDiving,3cbe7w,duhdude,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"The altimeter firmware stays the same as Elemental ships. It is just that they are making a platform that we can modify by adding to it. The display of altitude is unchanged, thus you are not trusting your life to your own coding."
SkyDiving,3cbe7w,duhdude,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:08:40 2015 UTC,I mean you could still conceivably create a memory leak (I assume a non-logging altimeter doesn't have very much) that could make the alti shit the bed during a jump. I just don't want to hack around on a piece of safety equipment.
SkyDiving,3cbe7w,teamanalrape,0,Mon Jul 6 21:51:06 2015 UTC,BMP085   So what you are saying is that for about $20 in hardware you can make what I'm looking for? How about I send you $100 and you make it and mail it to me?

SkyDiving,3cb39d,ChillinFallin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:46:41 2015 UTC,"They will teach you everything during your AFF, including steering your canopy and flying back home. You will also have radios during progression where a radio instructor will help guide you back to the DZ and tells you exactly what you need to do under canopy.   Don't spread your jumps, that's a bad idea. The more you jump, the more frequently you jump, the better you get. Wasting a lot of time in between jumps will help you forget shit, and simply not be consistent and efficient enough to learn. It's especially important during progression. If you're gonna spread your AFF throughout the course of a year you might as well not jump at all to be honest. It's simply a bad idea.   How did I start? Signed up for the course, fought against my fear and instincts, listened to what I was being taught, and trusted my instructors. Here I am hundreds of jumps later and still having lots of fun. Did I spend a lot of money on this sport? Absolutely, most of my money goes towards skydiving. Do I regret any of it? Not at all, my life is already rich from all the memories and friends I've made. Wouldn't change it for the world."
SkyDiving,3cb39d,JeromeMorrow13,-1,Mon Jul 6 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone was absolutely incredible. The skydiving community seems to be filled with some of the warmest, most relaxed, most genuine people I've been around. Everyone made us feel so secure and excited to jump. I was still terrified, but it was replaced with excitement. The first people to jump was a couple who held hands and fell backwards out of the plane together. I'll never get that memory out of my brain. It's engraved in there, and it seriously did something to me. I just realized skydiving was the most rewarding, fulfilling sport a person could do for themselves.  Thank you so much for your advice."

SkyDiving,3cb39d,ChillinFallin,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, I hope you enjoy it as much as most of us have. I have been part of many different sports communities, and none of them even compare to the skydiving family. And I truly mean it when I say family. I don't have any non skydiving friends anymore (I can literally only count 3, and 2 of them we grew up together so it's different), and I would rather spend any free time I have with the people I share the sky with. Skydivers (and basejumpers) share a bond like no other, and you won't truly get it until you're part of it.  I was battling depression before, but ever since I started skydiving my whole life changed. Not only have I become a more positive and happier person, but my whole outlook on life has changed. Just to keep it short, what I'm trying to say is that ever since I started jumping I haven't looked back for many many reasons, and it's the best decision I have ever made in my life. I'll never forget the instructors and coaches that helped me get where I am right now, I will never forget sharing a sunset jump with 7-8 or 15 of my friends and then fly under canopy next to eachother only to land and have beers ready for us on the ground to start our night. I'll never forget all the stupid shit we do on the ground when it's a bad weather day, or around the bonfire at night, or even coaching new people and seeing their facial expressions in the sky for the first few times or whatever. I spend more time at the DZ than I do at home, because I would rather be around them than anyone else."
SkyDiving,3cb39d,shanemitchell,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds so touching. I can't wait to become part of the community. You guys are just like no other. I went with two other people, and all three of our instructors were perfect in every way- hilarious, thoughtful, caring and comforting. I can honestly say this was the highlight of my life so far. I don't think anything will compare to jumping, except maybe when I eventually jump alone."
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,dexxra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:02:37 2015 UTC,I use an n3 and quite often get a speed reading of 284 when doing head down on tandems. I think it is a mistake made from the altimeter moving in and out of clean air and pressure. There is no way you could get going that fast in 3k
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,cyril_figus,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious if this seems like a reasonable speed to hit headdown after holding stable for about 3k?   I'm a fairly big guy (6'2 220+rig), but not sure if this is possibly an anomaly or not. It did feel like I was hauling major ass compared to any other jump I've made before. My N3 seems pretty spot on with other jump speeds, though. This was only my second real head down jump, so I don't have much to compare it with it terms of prior speeds."
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,GenoPath1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:02:49 2015 UTC,The math on that doesn't seem right at first glance since it shows you had 56 seconds of free fall.
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,LukeCrouch,0,Mon Jul 6 08:06:31 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, but because I couldn't really take a pic of the entire log (And didn't really mention this in the OP) the actual exit alt was 14.8k. Still, 280mph seems pretty excessive for a 3k drop."
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,LukeCrouch,-5,Mon Jul 6 08:33:44 2015 UTC,you`re wrong  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skydiving#Global_Speed_Skydiving_Database_World_Records
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,joephus420,-3,Mon Jul 6 13:53:56 2015 UTC,Impossible and highly unlikely are two very different things ;)
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,joephus420,-2,Mon Jul 6 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"In shorts and a t-shirt, my stable sit is around 180 mph.  I started doing speed runs not too long ago and have hit over 280 a couple of times with no special gear at all.  Definitely not impossible."
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,DiverDN,-2,Mon Jul 6 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a sit which is often times is extremely slower than head down, unless you're in a stall, or tryining tp fly it slow.  Just saying I'd take the point about head down ""terminal speeds"" in that article with a grain of salt."
SkyDiving,3c9zxd,PD_Valkyrie_75,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not that familiar with the N3's hardware (pressure sensor, location, etc), but considering that the first ~1000 ft of that 3000 ft is spent coming up to terminal (Be that belly or head down terminal, immaterial), it doesn't seem too likely that was your actual speed.   I have seen both my ProTrack and AltiTrack get stupid about freefall speeds and I attribute that to some weirdo unexpected change in air pressure at the sensor. So if I get off the plane and some how shadow my Altitrack in my student's burble, and then over the course of a few seconds it comes out of the burble into ""normal"" air, the software reading the sensor sees the pressure values as something like ""1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.3.3.4.4.5.5.6.6.7.7.7.7..."" (ie.""lower to higher over a shorter than normal period of time"").  The software inside the device calculates freefall speed based on the rate of change of air pressure at the sensor, so it says ""Holy shiat! You went from X Pa to Z Pa of pressure, which I know to represent 1500 ft in altitude, in 5 seconds. Thats 204 mph!""   Or something like that.  So occasionally, yeah, I'll be on a CAT A skydive in my flappy suit and my Altitrack will tell me my max speed for the jump was 154mph.  Ain't happening on an AFF jump that didn't funnel or anything. So I chalk that up to spurious data and drive on."
SkyDiving,3cacsz,amazonian_snu_snu,7,Mon Jul 6 10:14:04 2015 UTC,Personally I'd recommend doing it all at once. Main reason would be the weather. If you have the weather you want to get as many jumps in as possible. But in from the UK :)
SkyDiving,3cacsz,JakePOF,2,Mon Jul 6 10:48:20 2015 UTC,"Good advice. Just to add on top of that, weather is not the only issue. It's important to do AFF jumps at once because if you do it over longer period it will be hard for you to remember what to improve from last time. And you'll be more nervous/scared going up if there's a month gap between jumps. Be patient, save money and enjoy :)"
SkyDiving,3cacsz,khizarnaeem,2,Mon Jul 6 11:13:44 2015 UTC,Solid advice. You guys convinced me to stop being so impatient. They say good things are worth waiting anyway

SkyDiving,3cacsz,seebro9,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:52:43 2015 UTC,I did my AFF over a few months.  Some days I would do 2 a day and then take a break.  A lot of that had to do with weather also.  I feel like you would have better canopy skills if you did the whole course within a month.  2  or 3 per weekend would be great.
SkyDiving,3cacsz,pjdonovan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"Save up, take a little vacation and do it all at once. You're going to run into problems if you only plan for a few days per month because of weather and whatever else you have going on in life. So you'll end up with a large gap of time between jumps and then you'll have to start re-doing jumps (you'll be doing 9 or 10 jumps for your AFF instead of 8). So if you do it all at once, you're probably going to save money."
SkyDiving,3cacsz,Smith_One_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:06:44 2015 UTC,"All at once.  Not necessarily on the same day or weekend, but if you can do 4 jumps on a weekend and 3 the next you are ahead of the game.  You also need to factor in redoing cat jumps"

SkyDiving,3c7jyp,bjrn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:29:42 2015 UTC,I've done about 20 WS BASE jumps however nothing impressing. Unfortunately life got in the way and I had to put the sport on hold a bit. Anything you wanna know?
SkyDiving,3c7jyp,mistaoppy,3,Sun Jul 5 18:12:18 2015 UTC,"There's something that I've been wondering for a while. Often there are videos of people hiking up to the exit point with massive bags on their back containing their rig, wingsuit, helmet, etc (and I'm guessing other stuff). What happens to that bag when they jump? Is it left there then collected later, or folded and tucked in the back of the wingsuit, under the rig? It's a pretty mundane question, but it's been bugging me for a while."
SkyDiving,3c7jyp,bjrn,5,Sun Jul 5 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"Those are called a stash bag and are specifically designed to take no space when empty. I either put it in pocket on my cargo pants, or if I'm jumping with a wingsuit I just have the empty bag on my back before I put on the wingsuit.  I like stash bags because of their minimalism. It's basically just a sack with straps.  In general eveyrhting you hike up with you jump down with. Most impressive person I've ever met is a guy, fairly unknown, called Bernhard who flies his super small paraglider to remote exit points, and then just roll it and stash it in his pants before jumping down with his wingsuit."

SkyDiving,3c7jyp,Monolithic,5,Sun Jul 5 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"1) Hmm well I started skydiving and got very enthusiastic about it, spent all my vacation jumping. After a few years I befriended an old school BASE jumper. He offered to take me to a wind turbine if I wanted. By chance the same day a guy my size was selling his gear. Next thing I knew I was on top of a 400 feet wind turbine. Scary shit. I got intrigued. Did maybe 200 BASE jumps before I started flying Wingsuits from mountains.  2) Psychology: Well it's scary and you have to handle pressure and stress well. You can't black out during pressure (you can't be the dude who freeze in the middle of the street crossing when a car is going to fast towards you ;) ). It's also very time consuming and really an all or nothing thing, at least it was for me. You have to sacrifice quite a lot to do this sport because it takes more time and money than you can imagine. You have to accept that lots of people die and your loved ones will have constant worry. Lots of friends and people you've met will die.  3) I don't really have a crazy wingsuit base story, everything has gone well because I've been careful. As soon as you put on a wingsuit in base you statistically have like a 800% higher risk of dying. All my friends who do terrain flying say same thing though: mostly it's close calls. Craziest BASE jumping stories in general are too numerous to count. I've opened up quite a lot of new stuff (jumped buildings and similar no one else has jumped before). Almost landed on a police officer ones. Had a cliff strike once. Almost died once (it really gets white, very interesting).  4) It's fun, you push yourself (when you cheat death for fun nothing will stop you in normal life). You get really good friends, like the kind of friends you get in the military.  5) I foresee that lots more people will die. Unfortunately."

SkyDiving,3c5b9q,ChillinFallin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to switch things up, SWOOP in Hamilton is pretty awesome too. Gear rental is 25$ for a rig (including pack).   SWOOP is not a tandem factory, they are focused on training new jumpers and getting fun jumps in the air. However, if they have tandems coming that day, they do have priority to go up. They typically have 2 planes going when it gets busy though. So if weather is good, you really don't have a long wait.  Packers there are plentiful and also good.  The landing area is about a quarter mile long, there are some obstacles to the east, but I have never had an issue with them (Recently Solo certified as well). The rest of the land is farm land.  Coaches are good, there was maybe one or 2 days that I had gone and coaches were either not coming that day, or came late. But besides that, I have never had an issue. They are a friendly bunch of people and always willing to help new jumpers. One of the coaches was taking the day off, but was at the DZ, I needed to do my check out jump that morning, and he was the only one available (because he said he wasn't working). I talked to him and he said he would do the one jump for me.   Overall a really great group of people."

A new exit for Johnny. He was jumping a prototype racing suit with stiff plastic edges. The arms would cutaway with cables when he deployed. Speculation is he might have caught a burble And/or the nature of the suit twitched him into the wall. Johnny was recovered at the base of the exit point. Video was destroyed by the impacts.

SkyDiving,3c0235,iesus1313,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:19:18 2015 UTC,Sorry but I have to ask because is really bothering me. Is she an elementary girl trapped in a 25y old body or a 25y in an elementary girl body?
SkyDiving,3c0235,lovestang,0,Fri Jul 3 23:24:15 2015 UTC,I mean she's the height of a elementary school kid.
SkyDiving,3c0235,JeromeMorrow13,0,Sat Jul 4 03:56:26 2015 UTC,"You can start off with just a little bit of weight, like 4lbs, see how that goes, and then add more as you feel comfortable. I'm still a new jumper and this is what I did under the guidance of some very experienced jumpers. I slowly worked my way up to 10lbs and it's been fine. It helped that my canopy was already a bit under loaded (1:.8ish). Now I'm at a 1:1 and I have a lot better control over the canopy than I did previously. What is your current wing loading?   Also, I recommend the belt over the vest. I jumped with a vest at first and it was okay, but it was somewhat uncomfortable under the rig and it made me very top heavy. The belt is nice b/c it creates a better center of gravity and also pushes your body into a natural arch during freefall."

Another point about using watches is that they are generally smaller than are skydiving altimeters, thus, they are a bit harder to see. May not be a real problem, but it's worth considering.   I have a camera flyer friend that used one of those timex watches for more than a year as his skydiving altimeter. I wish I could find the model number for you.

Even then, you're not restricted in 1 of the 3 dimensions as you can fly across the slope and even miss the hi-5 and not die. Here, it's precision in 3 dimensions."

SkyDiving,3br5e3,flipperstf,7,Wed Jul 1 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Do you fly a wingsuit?   Even in those banking turns you can remove yourself from the proximity line at any time do to the dive.  You have as lot of built up energy that will peel you away as fast as you want.  Getting into the line is also not as sketch since you can moderate your closing distance easily.  Flying through a hole like Polli did or like Euli just did requires great setup, precision flying and commitment.  Just like when Scotty out did jeb by flying through the beehive, this is pretty incredible."

When I'm with inexperienced fun jumpers the load doesn't talk much about landing on the way up (they chat about exits and ff.) But the guys with experience are talking about landing patterns.

SkyDiving,3bu0bd,JuanMurphy,2,Thu Jul 2 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"There's no reason you can't try something creative.     Do remember that skyvans have a fast jump run, so don't take too long to exit.   On a day when an otter would be 7-9 seconds, a skyvan would be 5-6 seconds.   I like hanging.   go over how to do this with someone; you can knock your handles around if you do it wrong.  Also never hang if you're the last person out.  The pilot won't be able to know if  when you've left."

SkyDiving,3bu0bd,safeforw0rk,0,Thu Jul 2 04:21:30 2015 UTC,"Both of these. I love the hanging exit, but you have to know where the bar is and get right to it. You can always wait and get out last to play on the bottom of the bar.  The slow mo gainer is my fav because you get to watch the plane for a bit."
SkyDiving,3bu0bd,icanfly,0,Thu Jul 2 06:11:59 2015 UTC,what's a slow mo gainer?
SkyDiving,3bu0bd,icanfly,0,Thu Jul 2 13:26:44 2015 UTC,"I always try to drag my gainers out to be a long rotation. It's hard out of a skyvan and takes a bit of practice. The air is trying to flip you over fast, so less leg bend and a stiffer body gives a slow rotation to the start of the gainer.  It could also be my perception."
SkyDiving,3bu0bd,Deceased_Puppy,-1,Thu Jul 2 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"I'm drunk I had a huge long post but removed to get to the point I wanted. It confused me early in AFF when instructors told me to do gainers and backflips just like I would on the ground. If you have trained good technical backflips and gainers the mechanics mirror in the air at all. My instructors told me to just do it like I would on the ground. Huge fail till I learned to use air to push the moves.  TL;DR If you can do solid backtucks and the occasional gainer on flat ground then you instructor tells you do it like that in the air.  Then I know they've never understood how it actually works on the ground. Lol all the ""bad form"" for those tricks in the ground works in the sky.   Edit: I still have a ton of work needed to get solid frontoops down. A standing front tick maneuver does almost fuck nothing when I'm in the sky."

SkyDiving,3bs6e6,zobbyblob,4,Wed Jul 1 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Let's get detailed about your intended flight method... Is this a glider, or powered flight?  I've scratch built many flying rc toys both power and no power including rc para gliders and started a skydiver but just decided I like flying gliders and skydiving my body so I didn't finish that one. But the design didn't intend for free fall, simply a drop from an rc plane, deployment and then rc flight under canopy leveraging my paraglide setup.  First breakdown your method of 'getting into flight' because it will vastly inform your design direction.  I'd love to help if your willing to follow through."
SkyDiving,3bs6e6,icanfly,2,Thu Jul 2 06:17:59 2015 UTC,"It will be a glider probably 12 to 20 inches long with Home Depot towel bars as the body and a 3D printed shirt and pants for the arms and legs to connect to. (I have a few years background designing mostly quadcopters in Solidworks.)   I'm undecided on how I want to get the ""person"" into the air. I have a quad, Bixler 2, and a Radian (glider) that could all lift it into the air. I was thinking about holding the person by the feet on the quad and flying it up probably around 3000ish feet and releasing the wingsuit.   I'm unsure how to control the wingsuit person. I was thinking I could use elevon mixing and bend the two legs to control pitch and roll.  This wingsuit and whatever carries will also be flown FPV and have a pilot for each platform."
SkyDiving,3bs6e6,icanfly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:40:35 2015 UTC,"Sweet. Glider it is. Getting it into the air is easy if you've got a quad and flying via fpv is awesome, do you have fat shark head trac?  I'm not sure about the ""towel bars"", tell me more about them. If you can 3d print than I'd skip the shirt/pants part and I'd focus on getting your planforms dialed in to get it to fly first and then refine to get the look dialed.  Control surfaces can be hands and feet but you'll struggle with Dutch rolling and flat spinning without a vertical of some kind.  Are you expecting to ""pull a chute"" to land or just landing it?  Do you have a suit you want to match? There are several different kinds and shapes, each with varied flight types on the market. Perhaps identifying the suit will help reverse engineer the next few steps."
SkyDiving,3bs6e6,icanfly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:04:03 2015 UTC,"I have the head tracking but I prefer not to use it. It just makes everything more confusing for quads. On planes it would be better, but I'm okay without it after trying it once.   This is the towel bar. It is surprisingly rigid, although not as strong as carbon rods the same size. It is also very light.  Here is a screenshot of the ""shirt"" and ""pants"". The bars fit between the top and bottom sections and will be bolted together. The top picture is the shirt, two arms, a body on the bottom and a place for the camera to mount at the top. The pants have the legs facing down left and the body connector up right. He will have a small backpack of some sort to hold FPV gear and other needed things.  I wanted to minimize the servos I use to save weight, do you think it could be controlled with only two servos somehow? How would I limit flat spins? I don't really understand what causes them in a wingsuit or while skydiving. Do wingsuits have a vertical surface or is it just the total vertical area of their arms?  Personally I like the X3-Bird but it doesn't matter much to me. I'd prefer one that's easy to control. There will probably be a parachute stolen from a toy of some sort."
SkyDiving,3bs6e6,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:37:46 2015 UTC,"It's not ""vertical"" surface. It's horizontal surface for the wings. The vertical surfaces are used to stabilize and you have to take a step back from ""wingsuit"" for a moment and think, flying wing. I'll do some work and come back to you  2 servo's gets you v-tail mixing functionality, which is basically a flying wing slope glider. meaning, I think you might be able to make it work as a two channel+FPV.  I think there is potential here."

Pick and maintain a heading. Best to use a point on the horizon. And never ever track up jump run. I fly 90degrees to jump run. Plan this with your coach  Slowly and smoothly engage your track. Bring your arms back, thumbs towards your hips(I fly palms up) in sync with your legs applying even pressure with your toes pointed. You should feel your shins engage and you'll feel forward movement. Breath deeply and relax. Tuck your chin into your chest a little-don't loose your heading.   Most important thing is symmetry. Be thoughtful of matching every movement side to side. Stay symmetrical.   When starting I stayed a bit more delta to help with stability. Going pencil straight makes stability a bit more difficult and tended to get wobbly.  Hope this helps. Fly safe!"

So getting openings stable and on heading 100% of the time - not just most of the time. Then it's on to wingsuit with stable openings and tracking. Then I guess start with jumping spans and work up to Earth without a suit. Then add the wingsuit. ??? profit (probably just go broke really).

The rectangle that's cut out for your N3 is at an angle and slightly offset from the slit through which you put the N3.  I have to slide my N3 in and then shift it around till it sits nicely in the pocket.  If I don't slide it around then the N3 is just sitting on top of the rectangle instead of fitting into it.

Part of the dive flow was to lock on the alti at 6k, then wave & pull by 5.5k.. well 6k came and the instructor pointed at their alti which reminded me ""O SHIT, i'm supposed to lock on"".. well i locked on right before 5.5k, waved & pulled.  Afterwards, we went over the jump and i was completely honest about what happened.. how although I looked at my alti during the dive, i wasn't registering my actual altitude.. turns out it happens pretty frequently. something they recommended which has helped me a lot was to frequently check my altitude on the way up.. helps to keep me altitude aware and it builds the habit/routine of constantly checking and registering the actual altitude. welcome to the skies!"

I'm not in the group myself so I can't give you much more than that.

They give an idea of how the cost depreciates as the gear is used. I don't think there are any ""starter kits"" as even after AFF, different people have widely different preferences of Container, Main, AAD etc."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,the_anirudh,2,Sun Jun 28 02:31:52 2015 UTC,There are any different opinions on here so I will just give you my personal experience. I spent $1500 on a used rig and $900 on a used AAD. From what I can see people do one of two things. They either get cheap safe gear and jump as much as try can quickly becoming skilled jumpers or they buy all new gear off the bat and rarely jump. It's up to you as to what you want out if this sport.
SkyDiving,3bcl79,Dickbuttcheesington,-1,Tue Jun 30 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"When I was starting out, I looked high and low for a container with a Skyhook that fit my body type. I couldn't find one (I'm tall). So I bought a new container.   If you're smart, you'll downsize very slowly -- so the container will last a while and should have superb resale value. You could give me a Sabre2 at 1:1 and I could still have a ball with it. Skill matters.   My rigger also told me to buy a new reserve, so I did.   Just a different opinion on the new/used debate.  https://www.chutingstar.com/skydive/skydive-equipment/complete-rig-packages"
SkyDiving,3bcl79,JeromeMorrow13,2,Sun Jun 28 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"did you get a used AAD? any idea why he said new reserve? i'm not very experienced, but it seems to me if a rigger goes through your reserve and it hasnt had a bunch of rides, it really shouldnt matter? just curious as i'm thinking about doing what you did (i'm tall too)."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,jwdjr2004,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"I did buy a used Cypres2, but it had a lot of time left on it and was just back from service. Reserves are a bit different and more complicated in their own right. For instance, the reserve pilot chute is spring-loaded. My rigger is very conservative. However, I know tons of people who bought used reserves with no problem."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,JeromeMorrow13,0,Mon Jun 29 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  It's not about being smart or anything.  You can easily go down 20-40 sqf on your first year off AFF.  Even more if you were conservative during AFF.  Depending on your container, it might already be close to the smallest canopy it can hold and you'll have to get a new one.... I'd personally suggest you make sure the container you buy is maxfit with the canopy you want.  Then you have some room to downsize because you will.  (some containers can hold 190-170-150 for example while other are recommended only with only 20 sqft difference (190-170 or 170-150 for example))   Also make sure the container you buy fits your body size well, and verify the size of the reserve that goes into it. When I bought my rig, I found a lot of 190-170-150 containers that would hold a 143 reserve which I felt was too small.  I settled for a 160 (had to go with a 170-150 container).  Sure you can downsize a little more by making your loop smaller and stuff but it isn't recommended by the manufacturer."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,Gaboury,-2,Sun Jun 28 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"even if you're progressing fairly quickly, you can move to a sportier canopy with the same wingloading and get additional years out of your container--depending of course on the canopy you start with."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,jwdjr2004,0,Mon Jun 29 15:09:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather downsize than go elliptic but that's just me for now.  From what I've heard most sportier canopies need a certain wingloading to perform well...
SkyDiving,3bcl79,Gaboury,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"You've heard wrong. Most sports canopies need a certain pilot skill to perform well.  Im my rather strong opinion, downsizing is massively overrated. It is entirely possible to have a blast on a 1.0 or 1.1 loaded canopy while you already have 1000 jumps, and it is equally possible to learn highly advanced techniques on such a canopy (Can you flare using rears if your steering lines snap at 500ft? Can you land from deep brakes if you needed to do a flat turn at 50ft to avoid a collision? Can you land it accurately the first jump of the day every day should you find yourself off with only a 10x10m grassy field available?)  The other disadvantage of downsizing is that the canopy taxes your skill more, even on a good jump. You'll have less options and range left on a bad jump, while those are the jumps where you'll NEED it.  Of course, a student won't be happy if he's got to jump a Manta 280 for the first 500 jumps, but thats mostly a canopy model issue. Find a model with flight characteristics you like (demo the shit out of different canopies at boogies etc.) and get it at a wingload that makes you confident you can save your arse on the shit jumps."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,IceRabbit,-3,Wed Jul 1 05:27:00 2015 UTC,Let's say that you are jumping 1:1 off AFF. A smart person is not going to go down 40 sq. ft. in a year unless they are jumping like a maniac.  http://www.bigairsportz.com/pdf/bas-sizingchart.pdf
SkyDiving,3bcl79,JeromeMorrow13,0,Sun Jun 28 18:26:47 2015 UTC,"Indeed if you're already 1:1 off AFF.  Not everyone is.   Just for the record, I believe that sizing chart is some real bullshit.  There are so many more important things than what is on that grid than the weight and size of the canopy."
SkyDiving,3bcl79,Gaboury,0,Sun Jun 28 18:47:44 2015 UTC,Stop saying what a smart person would do. People downsize at different speeds and your opinion is not reflective of the entire sport. People can downsize and do much faster than you and that doesn't necessarily make them stupid just different. Some people pick up skills faster than others. Some focus on body flight and some on canopy flight. You are giving advice that op should be receiving from his/her instructors and S&TA.
SkyDiving,3bcl79,Dickbuttcheesington,0,Tue Jun 30 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"Brian Germain has 15,000+ jumps -- is a test pilot and canopy manufacturer. Some standardized advice is good. I've seen an ST&A let a dude jump a GoPro with less that 200 jumps. Sometimes right is right and wrong is wrong."

SkyDiving,3bcmaa,Eddles999,0,Sun Jun 28 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"Did you book a reservation, or did you just walk in?   Most DZ's that I have been to set up reservations and are pretty good at them. I work at a DZ in the northeast as a packer and we are pretty good about getting the tandems in and out. When they really start to rack in the door with walk ins, we turn on the King Air to expedite the process. A lot of times we will hold off on weather conditions for safety reasons of course.   Just remember, if possible reserve your tandem for first load of the day. Normally the fun jumpers will go on first load, but if there is space you would be thrown on 1st or 2nd load. So in and out much quicker than showing up in the middle of the day after 20+ other walk ins came in.   Hope you go to jump yesterday!   Blue Skies!"

SkyDiving,3bb7tx,Airricks,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"Mostly like it's an annoyance to do student jumps and that students are just a means to be able to jump more. I heard some of them shit talking some other students and generally just acting like it was just a pain in their ass. I actually haven't had any actual issues with safety or otherwise getting any bad feedback, it's mostly just an observation about general attitude."
SkyDiving,3bb7tx,Ariya92,3,Sat Jun 27 21:07:01 2015 UTC,I've found this attitude more common among Tandem Instructors. Of course some love to introduce people to skydiving through tandems but it seems like for many its just a means to jump for a living and they seem to hate it.

SkyDiving,3bb7tx,DiverDN,-1,Sun Jun 28 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, what you may have heard as ""shit talking"" was probably more like ""shop talk.""  Instructors are not always as enthusiastic as the student when they land. ""Hey, wow, man! That was incredible! You are so super awesome and I am stoked to just be around you!"" :)  You could well have overheard two instructors briefing one another about a student's performance. I've done it.  ""Hey, Tom, you jumped with [student] Timmy last week.  Anything I should look out for?""  ""Yeah, Timmy backslides like hell, so you'll need to give him legs out once or twice.  His setup was a little slow, and he half-counted in the door and surprised both of us.  He also had a hard time finding his handle.""  This isn't saying ""Crikey, Timmy sucks and he makes me question why I bother with these students.."" its more ""Here are some things to watch for so you can maximize Timmy's learning on the next jump.""  I've gotten surprised by a student who had, say, issue with his or her ability to get their hand on the pilot chute handle easily. Maybe it was something we could have drilled more on the ground if I had known, or something I should watch out for in the sky so we're sure to have a successful skydive. So we'll ask for any ""heads up"" from prior instructors.  OTOH, the instructors you heard may have just been cranky old bastards who like to shit-talk about their students. If that's the case, find a nicer place to jump."
SkyDiving,3bb7tx,pjdonovan,0,Sun Jun 28 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"It was definite shit talking. If I remember correctly it was ""man I can't stand jumping with [student], but at least he went from worthless to dangerous"""

More than likely, the manager talks about customers in a negative light so the employees mimic his/her behavior.

I'm envious.  I want a self-designed Skwrl-suit (no relation).    A couple of thoughts/questions...  It's a little hard to tell from the photos, but it looks like you have a lot of the arm wing in the root (in other words, you have more wing behind your center of gravity than in front of it).  Do you find you got lift from that relative to, say, an R-bird?  Also, it could be the pictures, but the tail looks big for the arm wing.  Did it fly a little head low?  (I know you said ""stable"", but lots of suits like fly ""stable but head low"" and are fast as Hell...)  I'm assuming you aren't planning to backfly it, right?  (No backfly vents and that wing root will likely make backflying very, very hard.)    In any event, very, very cool!  How long did the build take?"
SkyDiving,3b08q6,mrluckylager,2,Thu Jun 25 12:12:50 2015 UTC,"So the wingsuit is probably most similar to an R bird 2/foghead, tail goes to the floor. Didnt seem head low, on my 2nd jump I tried for a time run and only got 2min 20seconds, shy of 3min and 30sec I would get in a similar tonysuit. No backfly vents although they where planned and I cut the vents out but decided not to put them on. It took about a week and half from start to finish although I didnt work on it all the time, the sewing part was 22.5 hours."

SkyDiving,3auf46,jwdjr2004,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"I've been jumping for a while. If I have to land downwind for whatever reason, and it's not a zero wind day, my default is a PLF. Most skygods will think that this is overkill.   I land downwind once in a blue moon, and only if the landing pattern gets really sketchy. I've done the slide a few times, but once I came in too hot and hit my tailbone really hard. It could have ended badly.   I've also seen a very experienced canopy pilot land downwind, try to stand, and get the infamous tib/fib fracture.   My opinion: Do the PLF, clean off the dirt, catch some shit from your buddies, and move on."
SkyDiving,3auf46,JeromeMorrow13,10,Tue Jun 23 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"It all depends on horizontal speed vs. vertical speed.  If you haven't fully planed out during the 1st stage of your flair you are going to be carrying a lot of vertical speed, and a PLF is definitely going to be your best bet.  However, if you have fully planed out, you will have converted all your vertical speed to horizontal speed and a PLF might easily break you.  Sliding it in is the best decision at that point.  Its not that ""skygods"" think its overkill, its just that people are flying high performance/highly loaded wings with a lot of horizontal speed.  A PLF in that situation, plus the added down wind speeds, is pretty much a terrible idea.  All that said, if anyone isn't sure about specifics of when to PLF vs. when to slide, you should talk to a qualified instructor/canopy coach to help you."

SkyDiving,3auf46,JeromeMorrow13,4,Tue Jun 23 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly with this. More vert speed than horizontal? PLF. More horizontal? Slide.   I knew ""sliding practice"" in high school baseball would teach me something, know how to slide and not wreck your body and you're good to go. Pretty sure they didn't teach us to PLF when sliding into a base in baseball."
SkyDiving,3auf46,face_phuck,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"You also didn't slide into third from the 6th row of the bleachers. It's a personal call. There's no real winner.   High-speed slides are not usually very pretty either. If you get your heel caught in a small divot or depression, you'll be getting some medical-grade titanium.   It would be a good topic for the USPA to investigate."
SkyDiving,3auf46,JeromeMorrow13,2,Tue Jun 23 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"Goes back to the learning how to slide part. Leading heel shouldn't be digging into the ground, keep it up in the air or have your leg bent with your foot sliding to absorb a hit. Also why skater shoes are awesome for jumping. The bleachers part, well you have more vertical speed, so plf.  Not arguing, just speaking from the experiences I've had"

SkyDiving,3auf46,Thecoolbeans,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"in my highly highly limited experience, it has been a situational thing. i go feet and knees together and prep for a PLF pretty much every landing no matter what (just want to get in the habit), if i'm falling more vertically, then it becomes more of a proper PLF, but when i have more horizontal speed, i've tended to end up in a baseball slide. I wasnt sure if that was necessarily a bad habit that i should be trying to fight, or (for lack of better phrasing) just relaxing into whatever fall/tumble comes naturally from the momentum."
SkyDiving,3auf46,nmoat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and given the correct circumstances I definitely agree with you.  In my circumstances, I'm loaded a bit heavier than the average bear on a somewhat aggressive wing. If I PLF downwind its not ""tuck and roll"" its ""tuck and roll and roll and roll"" risking broken arms, collarbones, head injuries etc.  So yeah, both definitely have their applications given the situation."
SkyDiving,3auf46,LordTengil,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"i had a really fast downwind landing one particularly windy day.  I think it was around my 30th jump and i was still getting overwhelmed from time to time.   On this particular jump id had a really slow opening and it resulted in almost 10 line twists... No big deal i can kick them out i thought. So i was making progress and by the time they were out i was already at 1500 feet and almost 0.5miles from the dropzone and flying downwind.  What i should have done:  Chosen an alternative landing area, there were so many fields i overflew, any of them would have been ok and right by the roadside too so the DZ could've sent a truck out to collect me in no time at all.  What i actually did:  I flew half brakes and my forward speed increased even more and i was stupidly focussed on ""just getting back"". I crossed the perimeter fence at a height of around 300feet and realised that there was no way i could 180' this thing back into wind. (I did half attempt a flat turn for about a second before wisely deciding on a downwind landing instead)  The forward speed of my Navigator210 was probably around 10-15mph, The winds that day were steady but strong at around 20mph. I had the option of landing in the recently churned up muddy field or on the tarmac runway.  I chose the runway and slid almost 100feet on my ass.  The reason i chose the harder tarmac runway rather than the field was because i felt i would be safer 'sliding it in' rather than 'tumbling over and over' in the mud.  I learned a lot from that jump, but the main two?   Always have the courage to 'land off' if needed. Always jump with my phone incase i need picking up after landing off."
SkyDiving,3auf46,droznig,3,Wed Jun 24 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"I flew half brakes and my forward speed increased even more   What? From full flight, your forward speed will always decrease when you go into brakes. If you have the wind to your back (like in this case) it's likely that your glide ratio over the ground will increase, so that was the right call for getting back. Your descent rate will also decrease, giving you more time to figure out what to do. But your forward speed will definitely decrease.  Personally, I think the main thing you should have learned from that jump was ""honor your decision altitude."" If you were just off student status it should have been 2500 ft. Going 1000 ft below that before you have a landable parachute is a terrible idea. Plenty of people have died because they thought they were really close to fixing the problems with their mains. If you are below your decision altitude and do not have a landable parachute over your head (for any reason), start your EPs."

SkyDiving,3ashlh,k1ana,17,Tue Jun 23 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"John came to Skydive Miami about a decade ago to learn to jump again (I believe he was a military jumper in his youth). Because of some health concerns that I won't get into for the sake of privacy, he would not be able to complete an AFF course. He was set on jumping however, so after a lot of talk between our DZO, John and his doctors, they cleared him for tandems.   He comes in about every other day to the DZ, always has a treat for the staff (donuts or pineapple cake) and is super mellow. He struggles physically of course, he is about 75-80 yo, but he puts on his jumpsuit, and when he's ready we suit him up on his own tandem harness (I believe he purchased it when he hit the 500 mark).  It's funny to see him jumping. The closer he is to the actual jump, the more energized he becomes. Sometimes he struggles to put on his suit, but 15 minutes later when he's boarding the aircraft, he just bounces up the steps and hops in. He has a #1 instructor that did the majority of the jumps with him, and so he knows to give John a little extra help when he lands so he can stand up, but sometimes they slide in and John is game for that too.  He actually hit the 1000 mark a couple of weeks ago, and they had a very excellent 6-way with all his closest DZ friends, and yesterday he treated everybody (staff AND jumpers) to a dinner at Olive Garden. Our DZO made a speech, and then John, and I'm not embarrassed to say I cried a little, he had some choice words for us younger folks."
SkyDiving,3ashlh,lovestang,3,Tue Jun 23 15:00:23 2015 UTC,What an amazing story. Thanks so much for sharing with us. Does the DZ at least give him some sort of discount since he's a frequent flyer?
SkyDiving,3ashlh,k1ana,5,Tue Jun 23 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"I believe so. I never asked directly because I thought it would be impolite, but my impression is that at this stage he is paying under $100/jump. My back of the envelope calculations points to somewhere between 100 and 150 thousand spent on jumps. Like I said, he is a grow man, even though he is frail of body, his mind is still firing at 100%. He is happily married and all his kids are out of the nest. I say, if he has the money, go for it."

They should have gotten a trespassing charge and that should have been the end of it. I bet they would have gladly plead guilty to that."
SkyDiving,3ar8pw,chrizbreck,4,Tue Jun 23 03:32:53 2015 UTC,How many hop and pops do you do next to a steel structure with car traffic right below?
SkyDiving,3ar8pw,Bigfrostynugs,0,Tue Jun 23 05:26:50 2015 UTC,"I still wouldn't consider that reckless endangerment. I don't see how jumping off a building or tower shows complete disregard for human life, in such a way that you are putting people at significant risk of death."

SkyDiving,3ar8pw,JeromeMorrow13,2,Wed Jun 24 05:45:30 2015 UTC,"Most of the hop n' pops that I've seen are from 5.5k. One WTC is 1.7k. Farmland vs. lower Manhattan. Regardless, this type of behavior is further marginalizing the sport, as more proactive laws banning BASE will be put on the books. It's pretty damn selfish.  I think BASE jumping should be made legal in certain National Parks and be regulated. Jumpers will have a safe place to go and can become familiar with the terrain, thus increasing safety margins. In return, they would have to receive a permit, like one that you would get for fishing or hunting.   For the permit, you would have to prove some level of competency, like a USPA C-license, and pay a fee to offset potential EMS services. The injury rate in BASE is very high."

SkyDiving,3akmqh,JStarx,2,Sun Jun 21 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"Question from a non-swooper: What does ""in the corner"" mean?"
SkyDiving,3akmqh,nzmi,6,Mon Jun 22 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"I'm also not a swooper, but I understand the concept so I'll try to explain it. As always, seek professional coaching before applying this knowledge. :)    When you make a make a maneuver that results in pointing your parachute at the ground, it wants to get back to flat & level (or as close to it as it's trimmed to fly normally); but it doesn't just do this immediately because your body is pulling back in the opposite direction... the process takes time. Thus, a side-view of your flight path looks like an arc, which we refer to as the recovery arc.  Swoopers do this low to the ground with the goal of reaching level-ish flight just above the ground with a boost in speed gained via whatever maneuver they made to get there.  If your flight path looked more like this (grass added for emphasis), then your canopy requires additional input before you become one with mother earth again ahead of schedule (details of which I'll leave to your canopy coach)...   Basically, you've made your turn too low, and you are now ""below"" (or in the case of my original blue arc, to the right of) the intended arc, and thus ""in the corner"" (of the arc's containing box)...  Probably not the most eloquent description, but hopefully that helps understand the term."
SkyDiving,3akmqh,PD_Valkyrie_75,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:42:04 2015 UTC,As an experienced swooper I can confirm that your explanation of 'being in the corner' is spot on. Nice work!

SkyDiving,3ake5u,TheManCalledDour,2,Sun Jun 21 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"so I'm replying as an ifly instructor and agree there is some truth to this. A part of our job is to sell time, but instructors are in the wind more than anyone and are taught how/have a lot of expierence coaching. Besides some of the full time coaches such as ryan risberg and scott plamer the best coaching is almost always going to be from an ifly instructor. To avoid feeling like you are being rushed, aren't receiving thorough briefs and debriefs, and aren't just another customer in the building I recommend talking to an instructor beforehand and scheduling coaching while the instructor is not on the clock. If you don't know any instructors I would talk to people at your dz and see who they have worked with, maybe use the IBA website to find someone, or maybe even post on here to get some recommendations and contact info. As a skydiver who wants to see people get their moneys worth out of the tunnel and as an ifly instructor, thats my 2 cents"
SkyDiving,3ake5u,flying_punk,2,Mon Jun 22 06:26:51 2015 UTC,"This depends.  I'm not an instructor but I have a ton of time in the wind. Am I as good as Ari, Ryan, Plamer, Rafa? Nope.  Can I teach you how to fly? Yep. IFLY is really eating into their own market by forcing coached time if you want to learn something.  Flying for flying's sake would be more fun in the sky for a skydiver. We come to the tunnel to improve (it's not a ride for us). I'm also going to teach you proper technique better than most of your lower level instructors."

I did 5 minutes and the final 1:40 I was able to do some maneuvers and get really comfortable with my body position. My next jump (yesterday) was definitely better as a result.  I will say that it's kind of a false sense of confidence because the flights are longer than most freefall and you miss all the RW/Altitude awareness from actual skydiving as well as the ""exit"" being completely different. So it doesn't translate perfectly."

SkyDiving,3aicf1,Ilioischio,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"As a non jumper can you explain what happened? The chute obviously did deploy to some extent, but unless physics took a nap another jumper should not have been able to catch up to him unless the savior had not deployed his cute yet, right?  The news is being useless in its descriptions."
SkyDiving,3aicf1,lenaxia,6,Sat Jun 20 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the rough explanation I gave elsewhere that may require further explanation so feel free to ask :  Ok here's the long explanation. Note that the canopy did deploy fully and was flying normally before pilot error caused it to collapse and wrap around the top jumper.  In a normal canopy formation dock to build a stack the low canopy is flown so that the very middle of the canopy strikes the back of the higher jumper. The higher jumper then reaches down and grabs the top skin of the low canopy and hooks his feet around the centre two lines at the front of the canopy. He is then in charge of flying the stack. The low jumper is no longer in control of the flight path at that stage. The following is a picture of the positioning I mean although the high jumper has taken their feet out of the lines and the low jumper is controlling his canopy because they're landing the stack.  http://www.bkpc.co.uk/ImageGen.ashx?image=/media/3995/278898_2271815674287_6615281_o.jpg&width=1000&constrain=true  If you approach the higher jumper too quickly as the low jumper in order to dock, your canopy will start to bow around them as the centre stops but the lateral edges continue on a bit. Canopies are fairly rigid when inflated so there's some room for manouveur with that where below a certain speed of approach the lateral edges will correct back in line with the centre. If you approach reeeeally fast or at a bad angle (i.e. not directly from behind) though they don't correct in time before they fold all the way around wrapping the high jumper in the canopy and / or lines. See this video for an example  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncxSnRpjWpA  Now the following is a good quality picture of the jump in the article :  http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/20/09/29CD3E1100000578-3132425-image-m-60_1434789444988.jpg  What has happened here is that the low jumper has either approached too quickly or at an angle or impacted the high jumper at the wrong point and their canopy has wrapped around the high jumper. See how the white fabric of the low canopy passes all the way around the lines just above the high jumper. The low jumper has probably impacted the high jumper above their head rather than at their lower back. The point of impact is narrower, the canopy is able to fold more easily around, and it wraps. In addition the white section of the canopy isn't the centre. The canopy is divided into 7 sections lengthwise. He should have struck with the black centre ()()()(x)()()() at that point. He has instead struck with a point to the left of that ()()(x)()()()() and the load isn't evenly spread. The low jumper is now facing backwards as a result.  It is possible that the reason the low jumper didn't cut away is because if he were to do so his canopy would possibly wrap around the entire body of the high jumper and as a result blocking their vision and potentially wrapping lines around vital parts of them. Personally I would have told the lower man to cut away but I can't tell if other factors were in play.  It's also important to remember that this is a pretty common occurrence in the Canopy Formation discipline and isn't considered particularly newsworthy by anyone who participates in it.  Edit : And a comment in the guardian article supports my explanation further :  ""Volunteer Dianne Richardson said it seemed the parachute opened initially, but that something happened as they were manoeuvring in to a stack position. “To be honest everybody thought they had been tangled up, but it was only afterwards that they found out that one of the guys managed to manoeuvre to safety,” she said. “There was an audible sigh of relief on the harbour when [the organisers] put the announcement out that they were safe.”"""
SkyDiving,3aicf1,Ilioischio,2,Sat Jun 20 14:58:44 2015 UTC,Great explanation! Thanks. It's much clearer now.   Another question though: How was the rescue executed since he didn't cut away? Was the lower jumper only held by the legs of the higher jumper? Or did he somehow tie himself to the lower jumpers chute?
SkyDiving,3aicf1,lenaxia,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"The lower jumper was attached by his canopy and lines entangling the higher jumper in a stable way which didn't interfere too much with the stability of the higher canopy itself or seemingly the control of the higher canopy. In the picture of this event you can see the canopy is wrapped at the point where the lines attach to the harness itself (the risers which are made of a seatbelt type material and are extremely strong). The higher jumper wouldn't be expending energy to maintain this as the force is running through the parts of the two parachute systems rather than the bodies under them. I'd hesitate to call this a rescue though. The safest thing, when able, is to have the lower jumper cut away his main parachute and deploy his reserve leaving the high man to clear and cut as much of the canopy around him (CF jumpers carry 3 big knives generally for this purpose). The only reason I can think to keep the low jumper in tow is because you don't have enough altitude to cut away (in which case you really shouldn't have been attempting to dock in the first place) or you think that by cutting away the low man you increase the risk of the cut away canopy further entangling the high man to such an extent that he would have a higher chance of injury."
SkyDiving,3aicf1,Ilioischio,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"In general, when the lower person in a wrap cuts away, the tension is released from the lines and the canopy can usually slide off the top jumper. Otherwise, if the wrapped canopy rides up into the top jumper's canopy, the top jumper should cut away as well, and go for reserve. Hook knives are usually not necessary in such a case."

SkyDiving,3ahgaf,newtofalling,4,Sat Jun 20 05:27:18 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a reasonable figure to complete AFF. That generally doesn't include gear rental, so if you don't have your own rig, factor in rental costs.  Those are either per jump, or at a day rate.  From memory, something like $20/jump or $100/day. Get your own gear as soon as possible. It isn't bad.  You are on a very large parachute that descends slowly, and you're guided down by radio. Non issue.  I drink very rarely, and pretty much never at the dropzone.  I always feel a bit grungy, for lack of a better term, the day after drinking, and like to be on my A game when jumping."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,nelish,5,Sat Jun 20 05:37:13 2015 UTC,"4 - Don't depend on the radio working, it may be dead by the time you're under canopy, rely on your training and what your instructors told you."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,TruIgnoranceisBliss,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:51:45 2015 UTC,"My first 3 jumps the radio were just static once under canopy, except for on jump 2 where I heard a few words soon after opening but then it went static again. Different radios, new batteries every time. So yeah, this."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,Davis660,0,Mon Jun 22 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"All of these answers are solid. You'll want to buy your own gear asap, then you'll want to upgrade asap. Skydiving as a sport isn't cheap."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,michaelcuz,2,Sat Jun 20 06:03:57 2015 UTC,I don't know. The buying gear thing isn't that simple depending on how often you jump.
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,Addict7,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:32:32 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm actually trying to figure that out myself. i think ideally i'd get 100 jumps this year but realistically it'll be like 25. 100x25 is 2500 i could have put to gear. but 25x25 is only 625, which might be worth waiting a while and firming up what i want."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,jwdjr2004,2,Sat Jun 20 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"1) $2000 is a nice round figure, but ask your dropzone.  Depending on how long it takes you to go through your AFF jumps, how well you pay attention during the FJC, and how relaxed you can be, you can get through all of them without failing one.  2) The $25 doesn't include gear.  3.a) Call the DZ for information.  Many provide rental gear, some places the cost is reasonable, some places it's ridiculous.  (I've seen it as much as $50 per jump for a regular rig).  Some places rent out the student gear for much cheaper.  3.b.1) Price the gear and do the math, if your dropzone offers $100 a day rentals, and you can get in 4-6 jumps per day, that's between $17 and $25 per jump.  So a hundred jumps comes out to an average $1100 in rental costs, but you're not locked in to a single canopy or container before you know what you want.  3.b.2) Don't worry about buying your own gear early on, you don't even know what you want to do yet and your goals will change several times before you get 50 jumps. In my first hundred jumps I went from a 260 to a 240 to a 230 to a 220 to a 200 to a 190, and each time I started looking for gear in that range because I thought I was going to stay on each canopy for a long time.  In some cases it was less than FIVE jumps.  Wait to buy until you're close to 1:1 wing loading and wait you know what discipline you want to focus on (and then whether you want square vs. semi-elliptical, ZPX vs. Hybrid, 7 cell vs. 9 cell).    3.b.2.a) That said, if your DZ charges outrageous prices for gear rental (the aforementioned $50 per jump place), then go ahead and buy something at 0.85:1 or whatever you're on when you get your license, just don't buy new, and be prepared to replace your canopy more frequently.   4) Yes and yes.  5) Alcohol only comes out at the end of the day, so don't worry about ""approaching the scene"".  Do be prepared to provide a case of beer for your milestones, but don't feel like you have to share in it.  At several DZs students bring a case when they know they're going to hit a milestone, and leave it in the instructor/staff beer fridge, along with several other cases from several other students.  Some people hang around a bonfire and drink the free beer afterwards, some people go out for dinner and some people drive home, nobody judges you on that part."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,SixtySecondstoEarth,2,Sat Jun 20 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"My dz got me through aff (first 8 jumps) for 1100. After that I paid gear rental plus jump tickets while completing my A which I got right at 25. Hadn't spend too much more than 2 grand fully licensed so call around if ur near a major city or somewhere that had options. Sometimes offering to pay in full up front will lower the price a little. Other replies about gear rental are accurate and u do want to buy gear asap but not too quickly as you'll want to downsize your canopy a little first so you aren't buying something you'll outgrow immediately. I've heard down sizing to a little shy of 1:1 wing load is a good place to get to before buying. I bought after 30-35 jumps and got a canopy that loaded me 1:1.1 and yeah You'll be alone and you'll be fine big confidence boost. And the drinking thing will never be an issue. No one drinks before the end of the day obviously and everyone's gotta drive home right after so it's never more than a few people drinking if you choose to hang around after, it's more about the community aspect than the drinking aspect that keeps people around at the end of the day. Good luck relax and enjoy!"
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,Pondering_Moose,2,Sat Jun 20 10:46:08 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I was an active jumper, but with my group of friends, the rule was you weren't required to purchase beer for milestone jumps, but if you didn't, you weren't able to partake in the accomplishments of others. I didn't drink beer at all, so it was a non-issue for me. I did still purchase beer for my milestones when I could afford it, because it was such a part of the culture.    Funny story. Early in my jumping career I went out to the drop zone on morning. Well, drop zone might be too strong a word for it; it was an air strip with a large landing area. There was hardly any shade, much less a rigger loft, restaurant or pro shop.    I was excited because it was half-price jump day. I was also excited because this was my 20th jump. My 'A' license jump. So we all start showing up, and we're waiting for the aircraft to arrive, and an experienced jumper friend of mine brings out an extra rig for me to use so I wouldn't have to rent gear for the day (it was a big canopy so I wasn't too worried about the downsize police). I immediately pack the chute as I had been instructed by my jumpmasters before. Then I ask, where's the spring-loaded pilot chute? Oh, this is a throw-out, cool. I talk through and practice my reaches on the new gear with the jumpmasters so I'm good to go. Then the aircraft shows up. a Twin Otter! Sweet, never done that before; I thought it was going to be a C175 like last weekend! This is shaping up to be a great day.  You all probably know where this is headed. I did a 2 way with my friend, and when I deploy: Bam! I had packed myself a line-over.  Non-jumpers always ask me if I was scared. But the truth of the matter is I reacted the way I was trained to react. I tried to clear it, couldn't, checked altitude, cut it away and opened the reserve.   I landed so pissed off, but safe. I had figured out even before I landed that the reserve couldn't be repacked on the DZ, so my day was over. On the first jump of half-price jump day. Now I know you experienced jumpers have been counting while reading this, but for the new guys here is what I owed in beer for that one jump:   a case of beer - 'A' license jump.  a case of beer - New deployment system a case of beer - New aircraft a case of beer - first malfunction a case of beer - for my rigger who saved my non-packing life   5 cases of beer for one jump. Well, at least I could afford it, I had planned to jump 8 times that weekend. Anyone else owe that much beer for one jump?"
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,romericus,2,Sat Jun 20 10:58:53 2015 UTC,There seems to be an unwritten rule at every DZ I go to that you can never owe more than one case of beer per jump.
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,stargazingskydiver,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'm only going to comment on number 4, with some things that I've learned:  I was obsessed with the canopy segment on my AFF 1. However, you'll be prepared. You're briefed not only on malfunctions during AFF 1, but also when to flare. That part scared me the most, and I've seen the most injuries from a badly executed early flare. Just last week, I saw an AFF 1 student severely injure his tailbone/back when he let go of the flare after flaring early.    The two bits of advice I'd give you is, firstly, no matter what, hold the flare. If you flare too high, the instinct is to let go. Don't. At worst, you'll have a slightly rough PLF landing, but nobody gives a shit since it's AFF 1. Secondly, never land on your butt. You'll think you're falling slower than you really are, that's because of the adrenaline. Always PLF it out. Always.  Thirdly, they'll say you need to relax. Over, and fucking over. That annoyed the shit out of me...of course I'm not relaxed! It's fine to be nervous! After you land, and relief washes over you, that nervousness will all go away.   -Joeymack"

When you go to a new dz a case can go a long way to help you meet folks. Good luck! I started jumping a lot recently (about 4 years ago) and can't stop! Done around 2600 in that time and I still love every jump!"
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,skydivekevin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"May I suggest you look into staticline training? It's a slower and slightly less expensive way to learn, and you'll still learn lots of new stuff. You just start out with the canopy flight part, and move into freefall only when you've shown the ability to exit in a stable position."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,IceRabbit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:33:07 2015 UTC,"You will want to save a bit more. AFF is just the first half of your student progression. Coach jumps with a good coach will teach you a lot and help complete your first license.   $25 typically is jump price only. Gear rental is available at a lot of DZs but not all. Buying v renting is based on the frequency you jump. It sounds like you may be hooked. If you plan on jumping a lot then plan on buying a rig.   Being alone under parachute is a normal fear. Pay attention in class, with good instruction the basics of flying and landing a parachute are easy to understand.  I don't drink either, when I owe beer I commonly buy root beer. When folks owe beer based on work they have done with me they usually buy root beer. Non drinkers aren't the norm but there are quite a few of us on DZs.    Unsolicited advice: Keep things in your mind short simple and specific. Keep on the task at hand. Over thinking is a huge hiccup in some folks progression. It takes a little knowledge to acquire a little skill. With that skill you will gain experience. Experience is what brings us true understanding.   Welcome to the sky!"

SkyDiving,3ahgaf,alanboomy,0,Sat Jun 20 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"That seems low, unless you're at a smaller DZ that still does static-line training.  All of the DZs around me offer A-license packages for ~$3,000. This is an insanely expensive sport, and the license costs are just the beginning. The $25 cost is just for the ride to altitude.  Gear rental is extra (Typically another ~$30/jump or some places will do $100/day for their graduated students) See above All DZs do it differently, my first jump I only had one instructor.  You're on your own under canopy, but they guide you down via a radio they either strap to your chest or to your helmet.  To be honest, I found the canopy flight 10x scarier than anything else. I don't drink either.  Just expect to buy beer for other people."
SkyDiving,3ahgaf,tsaven,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:30:19 2015 UTC,"This is an insanely expensive sport, and the license costs are just the beginning.   This sport has an extremely expensive initial barrier to entry, but once license and gear are accounted for, it does get relatively inexpensive.  Figure between $7-10,000 your first year for training, jumping, licensing and purchasing gear, then $2-4,000 per year after that, unless you get into travelling, going to boogies, competing, trying to go pro, buying multiple sets of gear, and doing many, many hundreds of jumps per year.  Upgrading your gear is nowhere near as bad as trying to buy it all in the first place."
SkyDiving,3ah80z,flarefail,13,Sat Jun 20 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"Remember not to look directly below you when on the final stage of landing, right before touching the ground, it can disorient you making you think you are way closer than what you actually are.  Edit: (Forgot the story) I plf on a cow on my 4th AFF jump, she just stood there while I hit her with my knees, once I got up there were like 4 to 5 cows in a circle all staring at me, eating their grass, ploting to attack with a death stare. I quickly picked up the canopy and got out of there. Funny things is I landed in the student zone"
SkyDiving,3ah80z,ChampignonMostaza,5,Sat Jun 20 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"It's not taught much anymore, but the Parachute Landing Fall will greatly reduce the force on your body due to a poorly executed flare. It's pretty easy to practice and should be your go-to maneuver if you're in doubt whether you can stick the landing or not.  Generally, new skydivers flare too early. If this happens, keep your toggles at maximum extension. Letting up will only make your canopy recover and surge towards the ground so even though it may intuitively be the right thing to do, it's counter productive.  As a student I landed on my ass a lot. In a tree once. Now, I'm a swooper. It means I'm back to landing on my ass. Full circle."

SkyDiving,3ah80z,idunnowhy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:34:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a radio on both jumps, but on the first jump it didn't worked at all.

SkyDiving,3ah80z,SixtySecondstoEarth,2,Sun Jun 21 03:21:30 2015 UTC,"You have to decide that you want to, no matter what.  I have a friend who broke her ankle during AFF, her story was similar to yours.  She was scared to do it, but really wanted to.  At one point, another instructor basically told her ""yeah, people like you just give up"" and she took offense to that, decided that she wanted to jump more than she wanted to be afraid, and did it.  She was still afraid of jumping and getting hurt, but she went back and did AFF again and now she's jumping regularly.  For what it's worth, I didn't learn how to flare properly until I took a canopy course after almost 100 jumps.  I knew how to PLF and land and roll properly so I never got more than the wind knocked out of me, but I kept at it anyway.    Before you go back, learn judo or gymnastics rolls and practice by falling down, or by jumping off of a bench or other low object.  And when you do go back, ask for a bigger canopy."
SkyDiving,3ah80z,rabel,2,Sat Jun 20 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"Look at the horizon the whole time.  Flare and keep flaring. It's harder than you think - you flare then flare some more and don't stop flaring. Pull the toggles all the way down to your knees. You should be sore in your arms, shoulders and back because you're really pulling down hard all the way to the ground. Your student canopy is extremely forgiving of a high flare, the problem is most student jumpers stop flaring when there's still plenty of brakes left. Push those toggles all the way down and keep going.  Once you figure that out you can start tweaking your flare height, the speed you pull the toggles down, slight steering corrections as you flare, etc."

SkyDiving,3ah80z,IeMang,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"When I was a student we had these huge old canopies (292sqft if I remember) and I watched a lot of video of accuracy competitions. The thing I noticed is that they flared for a long time. I called it the slow flare, and implemented it from the start. I would bring the toggles to my eyes when I was getting close (just under 10 feet or so), then gradually bring them further down the closer I got to the ground. Having done my stall checks at altitude, I was aware of how far I could push the canopy before falling backwards.   This approach really backfired on me though, the first time I jumped a ZP canopy (Triathlon 160). It was definitely a size down for me, and a much higher performance canopy than I was used to, so I was being especially careful about my landing. I did my checks at altitude and everything was fine. I approach the ground (straight in), and at about 6 feet or so, I begin to pull my toggles down, and I'm not slowing down (at least not as much as I expected to), so I pull deeper, and finally I'm slow enough to land, but still 2 feet off the ground. I'd been here before, no big deal. If you're slow enough and low enough, letting up just a bit at the end isn't usually that a big deal. So I let up just a bit. And by just a bit, I mean just a bit with my left toggle, and then BAM, the canopy dove to the right into the ground and I rolled for what felt like 20 feet.  Protip: gradual and EVEN toggle pressure is the name of the safe landing game."

SkyDiving,3afk1i,mrluckylager,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"I did this exact same thing. You're going to basically have to start over. If you're very good (for a 30-jump skydiver), you have extremely cool instructors, and are very lucky, you might get to skip an AFF jump or three. My DZ let me start with AFF-4."
SkyDiving,3afk1i,rabel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:09:27 2015 UTC,"I completed AFP, but never got my A license because I didn't complete the packing class last September.  I took the packing class and recurrent jump this May after taking a test again and going through about an hour of instruction."
SkyDiving,3afk1i,Tuesday_fun,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"I got my A license, did a few more jumps, then took 16 months off. When I came back I sat in on the emergency procedures portion of a first jump course and did a recurrency jump with an instructor. Then I was cleared to jump again. It's up to the DZ to decide what you need to do, so give them a call."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,impartialist,6,Thu Jun 18 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have one - the GF1002 Direct, which I use with a G3. I don't use mine with housing, just a lens protector to prevent scratches / dirt.  I think it's great - have gotten used to removing it and putting it on quickly. I take it off for tunnel mainly. The directions make it look harder than it is.  Video is great, as the camera is well positioned. Secure. No unwanted angle change. In RW, sometimes you only see the arm grips, but that's ok. At least you can fully raise the visor in canopy!  Been using it for a year, and now the quick release ring has come loose (it has a pin with a ring to grasp - the ring is loose) - I can still take it on and off, so more of a minor inconvenience. All good. Happy with my purchase."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,AliBabaDXB,3,Thu Jun 18 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah it looked a little faffy to put on, and not particularly robust using a bungee. No problems from that respect, or any shaking with the footage?  I like the placement and the concept though. It seems many people have a problem with chin mounting, but it makes sense when it reduces snag hazard, doesn't require holes drilling, and I'd guess footage is closer to what your eyes see?"
SkyDiving,3abi7y,AliBabaDXB,2,Thu Jun 18 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"I've not changed the stow bands on it since I started jumping it, so pretty robust I feel. It now takes me less than a minute to put on, so only tough to get round it in the beginning.   No shaking on footage (I use the small stow bands, with larger ones you may have an issue), and the position of the camera stays secure more than angle mounts I think.  Exactly - lower snag risk, easy to switch on/off, and footage is pretty good / consistent I find."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,Impopsicle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:51:03 2015 UTC,I have the no casing mount for my G3 and I think it's perfect. The angle is spot on for 90% of the types of jumping I do.  Sometimes when you are under canopy and you try to look very far to the left or right it gets in the way a bit but those are all minor annoyances. Still going on 2 season with the same stow bands as well. As far as stability it is rock solid when filming no shaking or anything.  For an example here is my end of year video from last year and it was filmed entirely with the grellfab mount.   http://youtu.be/adZccB3UuuQ
SkyDiving,3abi7y,ImNotFallingImFlying,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"I can hint that there's a new GrellFAB mount Om the way that you can tilt  Edit: regarding the ring, send them an email! They have amazing customer service!"
SkyDiving,3abi7y,onfirealot,2,Fri Jun 19 11:17:28 2015 UTC,"It's great. I'm a belly flyer, I use it for all my jumps. I use it to coach, inside camera on organised loads and my own flying. I've knocked it a couple of times, never had an issue with it.  Pain to put on at first, but you get used to after a while. I have to take it off to go in the tunnel, as they don't like it."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,TruIgnoranceisBliss,2,Thu Jun 18 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"I have the GF1102 : HERO3/3/4+ Direct on a PhantomX.   Love it this far. I've done FF and RW work with it and footage is just like any other setsups footage... great angle too!  I have about a dozen jumps on it..   I have one issue with it, and its due to where its mounted, but imho far less snag hazard than some of the others on the market. When you're under your canopy and looking around it gets bumped on your risers.. So if I look left and behind me it gets bumped on my risers then the camera gets side-cocked which is easy to adjust but Id rather pay attention to my surroundings than worrying about my camera angle."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,shadeland,2,Thu Jun 18 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"I have a Grellfab for my 3+/4, without the housing. It works pretty good. I've also got the snag resistant roller mount. One shoots video, the other shoots photos, little chance of snagging for either. Slight additional risk, but about as minimum as you can get while having a camera.   Grellfab is a pain to get back on (I haven't gotten used to it yet). I take it off for wingsuit training and the tunnel.   I'd recommend either the roller mount of Grellfab for your G3."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,JeromeMorrow13,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:31:55 2015 UTC,"I am a bit torn on the design. It seems like the best place to mount a camera on a full-face helmet. On the other hand, I'd be worried about snags. The mount looks to be somewhat low-profile, but if the bridle or lines gets stuck under your chin and yank your head up...nothing good will happen."
SkyDiving,3abi7y,AliBabaDXB,4,Thu Jun 18 20:33:14 2015 UTC,I'd argue it's one of the safest places from a hazard point of view. Much less exposed than on the top of the head and the cutaway looks easy to reach
SkyDiving,3abi7y,JeromeMorrow13,3,Thu Jun 18 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"It's secured to your head with two small elastic stow bands - I venture they would snap before your neck does! there is also some give, as I've once had the mount move during a bumpy exit, and thought I lost my gopro, but it just rotated 90 degrees"

(I did my AFF there in two days: tandem and five jumps and finished the next morning).  Also you can get the English (or british o whatever) AFF certification from British instructors. Browse a bit, there are webs where you can probably buy a pack with plane tickets, aff, consolidation and accommodation.  We also have Another one in Manresa not far from there: SkydiveBCN, its smaller but the staff is super friendly. They will also open all August and you can easily do the course consolidation and quite a few jumps in two weeks.

If you want to continue to skydive seriously, start looking at boogies pretty much immediately. wish I figured that out years ago. did a couple of 3 jump years :/  for good weather recommendations, go down to empuriabrava in Spain. those guys have it kitted out amazingly. you can stay at the place or rent cheap very close by. you'll also meet lots of great people and have a blast."

SkyDiving,3a1e86,SirRealle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:17:12 2015 UTC,Nope With BPA you qualify faster as it takes 18 jumps on average to get your A With USPA you need 25 jumps and a packing cert and you do a lot of canopy handling (which are all requirements for the BPA B licence.   Td; lr BPA is shorter USPA covers more stuff which is a requirement for the B licence anyway
SkyDiving,39ytao,jzzsxm,3,Mon Jun 15 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, you're not supposed to try pushing yourself out of the burble! It's the classic Instinctive Reaction That Is Also The Worst Possible One When Flying™."
SkyDiving,39ytao,mathrick,3,Tue Jun 16 09:09:50 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you supposed to do, catch them with your face?"
SkyDiving,39ytao,myearcandoit,0,Tue Jun 16 13:31:16 2015 UTC,"No, spread yourself out to maximise the lifting surface. Since burble is a sudden drop in lift (and correspondingly, increase in fall speed) that slams you onto their back, what you do is what you do every time you're falling too fast: brake. Whereas the natural reaction of pushing back only works to further reduce your surface and additionally ensures you will become unstable and hit face-first."
SkyDiving,39ytao,mathrick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:40:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, makes sense. Thanks!"
SkyDiving,39ytao,myearcandoit,3,Tue Jun 16 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"Actually it doesn't make sense. Maximizing surface area is only effective if there's air to push against. A burble doesn't care how big you are, there's not enough air in it to make a meaningful difference if you change body position.   I'd much rather proactively push myself off the other person and protect my handles than slam into them and wrap my limbs all over the place."
SkyDiving,39ytao,myearcandoit,2,Tue Jun 16 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I agree you had the correct reaction in that situation. Falling into a burble from higher up, it might be worth trying to slow yourself especially if you have time to do so considering you may time to slow yourself and still catch them with hands instead of face."
SkyDiving,39ytao,mathrick,3,Tue Jun 16 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"But there is air, it's not vacuum you know. It's just a slight depression. According to Vigil's calculations, roughly 80m difference in pressure altitude. That's enough to drop you the last couple cm if you're not prepared, but it in no way should be insurmountable for a coach.  You're only proactively pushing yourself out of a situation you caused in the first place. How do you think 3D flying works? Seems like you need to talk with some tunnel instructors, they can help you hone that part specifically. It's of course not possible to react to every single burble assault and it will happen occasionally, but you really should be comfortable with flying 3D in general to coach safely."
SkyDiving,39ytao,shadeland,7,Tue Jun 16 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"It's not a vacuum, but it is severely disturbed air. This produces two aspects that braking won't reliably work at close range (and probably make braking worse).  1) In freefall, you're falling into undisturbed, relatively calm air, and your body produces lift. The volume of that air is presented to you is from a single direction producing consistent lift, which makes it possible to maneuver in by changing your body's control surfaces and deflecting air into various vectors (arms, legs, tilting of shoulders, hips, body, etc.).   The burble is chaotic, vortisized, disturbed air, and that's a byproduct of all lift.  2) Disturbed air, while at generally the same air pressure (slightly lower), is not longer coming at you from the same direction, and the directions that it does come from is not constant (hence unstable). As a result:  1) Control in a burble is severely degraded since we rely on changing our lift profile (arching/dearching) and deflecting air (shoulder turn to spill more air on one side) to control our bodies in flight. When the air comes from multiple directions in a chaotic way, we can't fly it.   2) Lift is severely degraded (since some of the air is coming at your from the side), which reduces lift and increases fall rate.   All of this is immediately alleviated when returning into ""clean"" air, of course.   As the coach said, I would surmise that, at least at close range where the burble is most pronounced (as was the case in the video) it's better to protect handles and control the collision than try go get big.   Disturbed air as a byproduct of lift is why planes avoid wake turbulence, as the chaotic air is not controllable, or control is degraded. It's also why we don't follow other canopy's wake, as their wake turbulence/burble makes our canopies do unpleasant things.  The commenter I believe is a pilot and would be aware of all this, I'm explaining for the less aviation-minded :)"
SkyDiving,39ytao,blue_skies89,5,Tue Jun 16 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"The change in static pressure might not be much, but the dynamic pressure (dependent on the airspeed) and therefore the drag force will drop much more.    Just distance and time in the burble alone makes this hard to generalize. There also many more things playing into this, that it is hard to say ""when somebody flies underneath you X will happen""."
SkyDiving,39ytao,mathrick,-2,Tue Jun 16 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"Sure. Coach jumps are different than well synced FS. But I still maintain that if you coach, you need more, not less 3D skills to make up for what the student lacks. ""There's nothing I can do in this situation"" is not the right attitude, because it reveals a dangerous gap in skills."
SkyDiving,39ytao,rabel,0,Tue Jun 16 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"Happens all the time in big ways. You have to be able to fly through a burble to maintain your spot. /u/mathrick is absolutely correct, you get big. Otherwise you fall out of your spot and now everyone is chasing you down."
SkyDiving,39ytao,shadeland,4,Tue Jun 16 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"I think you and /u/mathrick are talking about slightly different things. He was talking about getting big in the burble. You mentioned flying through it. I totally agree, you can/should fly through a burble, which relies on momentum (and why burble hops are fun) to get to the other side, but getting big doesn't do much while actually in the burble. It does, however, counteract the increased fall rate when getting back into clean, flyable air. And the faster you fly through it the less it'll affect you, but that's sometimes problematic in big ways. (And usually ends up in the clip show.)  But getting big while stuck in a burble, with little relative horizontal speed relative to the burble-er, doesn't do much. It's like when you're coming in for a dock and someone goes low under you. Maybe you didn't see them, or if you did you might not have anywhere to go. You have little horizontal motion relative to them, so flying through it isn't going to work. Getting big isn't going to keep you from dropping out if they're close. You can't thrust out of it, you're just going to fall (well, fall faster).  The student was coming in for a dock so they were decellerating, which got the OP stuck in the burble.  I think the only thing the OP might have done if they had time to react (it happened perhaps too quickly) is to give himself some side motion so he would fly through the burble. Forward motion would be more effective, but problematic considering he might end up flying into the student."
SkyDiving,39ytao,rabel,0,Wed Jun 17 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"It's hard to be specific in comments on Reddit. I think we're all right, I'm merely referring to when someone gets under you when you're in a formation. The proper solution is to get big and ""fly"" the burble but that is assuming that if you're in a formation jump then the person who just flew under you knows they've made a mistake and are proceeding to get the fuck out from under you so you only need to fly the burble for a brief moment - hopefully you keep your slot as it happens.  There's no debate about that particular scenario as it happens quite often. The answer definitely is to get big and maintain your slot.  In OP's case, since it's a student jump with only 2 jumpers there really isn't any proper response since, well, as the video shows, just bumping into them really doesn't have any meaningful affect on the jump. Get big, fly through it, eat shit into their container - it's all good.  Really my only concern is that OP says he's a coach and as such he should have anticipated and flown around his student (I would have) rather than getting caught awkwardly in his student's burble."

SkyDiving,39xywc,jags84,2,Tue Jun 16 06:33:32 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, i saw this comment on youtube...  Q:  Manwich Killer 16 hours ago  How do you not hit the trees? can you pull yourself up but only for a short time to gain altitude?  A: +Manwich Killer you can always trade speed for altitude, that said considering that wingsuite is not exactly the best optimal air frame the energy cost would be high. meaning, he can pull up a bit if he has enough speed but only in very small amounts, a few tens of meter I would think.  Is that possible? gain altitude with a wingsuit?"
SkyDiving,39xywc,joephus420,2,Tue Jun 16 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yes a wingsuit can produce lift and go up, given enough airspeed.  But as the commenter says you have to trade airspeed for lift.  As you produce lift you lose airspeed and in short order you can't produce lift anymore.  So yes, a wingsuit can produce lift and gain altitude, it just can't produce sustained lift and gain altitude."
SkyDiving,39xywc,Addict7,2,Wed Jun 17 01:23:36 2015 UTC,Here's a video clearly showing a wingsuit gaining altitude. Of course in this case he's using the plane speed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZUgYWGDx68
SkyDiving,39xywc,soulscratch,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:29:17 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I've never flown a wingsuit but I know a thing or two about flying.  I dunno about gaining altitude but you can certainly sacrifice some speed to flatten your descent out a bit, so relative to the mountain face you're proximity flying it will almost appear as though you're gaining altitude.  Think of it this way: when you're proximity flying, your altitude over the ground directly below you is fairly constant. When you flatten out, your altitude over the ground directly below you will increase, even though your true altitude is still decreasing."
SkyDiving,39xywc,C7M,4,Tue Jun 16 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, Wingsuits can go up and wingsuits can gain altitude. That's is a very solid and proven fact now."
SkyDiving,39xywc,rabel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, the mountain is sloped so flattening out your flight path will result in the distance above the ground to increase.   Whereas flattening out your flight path when flying over flat ground will decrease your descent rate but you're still falling and getting closer to the ground."
SkyDiving,39xywc,joephus420,2,Tue Jun 16 16:46:05 2015 UTC,Thats actually not quite accurate.  A wingsuit can produce lift for very short amounts of time and increase the distance from flat ground.  It just can't produce sustained lift and gain distance from flat ground for very long.  There is a section in the WWL course in china where the pilots have to produce lift and gain altitude or else they'll be considered out of bounds and scratch the run.
SkyDiving,39xywc,rabel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see this course where the wingsuit pilots are expected to gain altitude. As far as I know, the only times I've seen wingsuit pilots actually gain altitude is immediately after exiting the aircraft when they have the forward momentum provided by the aircraft to assist and they're able to exit the aircraft and then fly up higher than the aircraft.    You'd think that if wingsuit pilots were actually able to produce lift from their wingsuits you'd see a hell of a lot more unassisted landings by wingsuit pilots since that's pretty much the holy grail of skydiving. Being able to flare your approach without a parachute would make for some very exciting skydives."
SkyDiving,39xywc,joephus420,2,Wed Jun 17 02:58:37 2015 UTC,"Here's the section of the course. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VigfXe1vhYg  A lot of people that don't understand whats happening here think he's just turning but he's not, its part of the course.  They have to go under the cable cars and then come back above them on the other side.  If they don't come back up above the cable on the other side, they scratch the run.  You can see people under canopies do the same type of thing on landing.  When they get a little bit too deep in the sweet spot of the canopy, they'll pop up or porpoise.  They'll follow the same type of parabolic flight path, then once they lose airspeed they stop producing lift and drop back down to the ground.  The problem with flaring a wingsuit on approach without a canopy is that its going to stall out while you are still moving at 70/80+ MPH.  That is a super fast stall speed.  There's a lot of kinetic energy left over after the wing has stopped producing lift."

They're good rigs and good canopies. The only issue is the material sticks together like nothing else. I have to repack if I haven't jumped for five weeks or so; it comes out of the bag like a brick. But they might have solved this by now.  I wouldn't be put off by the low price, if that's what you're asking."

Many people are content to do a skydive as an experience, cross it out on their bucket list, then leave it at that. Myself I never did a tandem, but I was absolutely not convinced I wanted to continue after the initial two jumps included in my starter course. I stuck around because I had a suspicion there might be more that I couldn't really decide on just yet, and I'm glad I did, but there's no question that skydiving is a very demanding activity that takes a lot of investment before it even starts being fun.  It might be that AFF would be more interesting to you, many people report disappointment on tandem because they didn't ""really"" jump themselves. You could give it a spin. But you should be aware that it takes lots of time, money and energy, and you will have plenty of opportunities for fear, doubts and inadequacy to set in, which you will have to force yourself through to continue. I can't tell you whether it's worth it in the end, I'm way too early on the path myself. But it's definitely not an easy sport, and it has very little to do with whatever perception non-jumpers have, and the more you know, the less it resembles what you might've thought before."

Casino's and hotels exist to make money, and this may impact their bottom line, hence the law being lobbied and passed.   Also, how can we not expect them to retaliate when jumps made from their buildings are blatantly thrown in their faces for the whole world to see via Youtube?

SkyDiving,39i3ue,LeftShark69,2,Thu Jun 11 23:53:46 2015 UTC,Q: How exactly is BASE jumping deserving of a felony? A: It's not.
SkyDiving,39i3ue,tail_wheel,-5,Fri Jun 12 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"Ok number 1, I assume you didn't read it because it labeled as a class E felony. Punishable by up to 1 year in prison, a fine, or both. Say someone day blazes said hotel or casino and causes grievous bodily harm to an innocent bystander. Or worse, causes an accident where someone dies. How is that not deserving of a felony?   Besides, who really gives a fuck. Don't whine about the rules when we all break them anyways on 90% of jumps. If your biggest concern on a BASE jump is getting arrested then you need to reevaluate your mindset."
SkyDiving,39i3ue,LeftShark69,5,Fri Jun 12 00:40:10 2015 UTC,"We already have laws for that. Manslaughter laws cover accidents caused by someone that resulted in the death of another, either intentionally but no premeditated or unintentionally. Like drunk driving, jumping off a building, etc... This is an overreach but they do it all the time. Used to be riding a wheelie on a motorcycle was  exhibition of acceleration and a ticket. Now it's reckless driving and straight to jail. What I don't get is other countries have events where people legally BASE jump off their tallest buildings. Do they even do that in the US? Dubai has all those awesome buildings and I see videos all the time of BASE being allowed. Maybe if we had more of that, we would have less people doing illegal stuff."
SkyDiving,39i3ue,tail_wheel,-3,Fri Jun 12 00:44:55 2015 UTC,Well the videos is what got us here in the first place. Maybe if everyone didn't feel the need to show every single jump on social media we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.
SkyDiving,39i3ue,tail_wheel,-2,Fri Jun 12 01:00:52 2015 UTC,Or learn a basic understanding of TOR protocol and upload them anonymously. Putting them on your youtube feed that logged your ip isn't exactly the smartest thing to do. Plus people just know who they are because there aren't that many people that do this kind of thing. Felonies ruin lives. I just can't justify a felony for this. Even a class A misdemeanor can ruin you for life.
SkyDiving,39i3ue,tail_wheel,-4,Fri Jun 12 01:06:41 2015 UTC,"I think we can all agree that it is another inherent risk of base though.

The design as advertised is bunk, since it's completely closed, so it requires you to thread the goggle strap through the helmet, affixing them permanently, and obviously requiring that the strap can be detached in the first place. But it doesn't really matter, because the shape of the helmet somehow keeps the goggles up without them sliding down onto your face, regardless of whether you thread them or put them on under the helmet. It's a huge improvement compared to the protecs we used before, which always had exactly the problem you describe. So, stupid as the goggle channel on the Benny is, it actually works just as well (better in fact) without you using it."

Now I don't have to fuck around with contacts and can just keep my glasses on all the time. Not quite in the price range you mentioned, but it's an excellent helmet with a fantastic field of view and superb protection. It's also easier to put on with glasses on than either a conventional fullface (obviously) or an open face plus goggles.  I've considered Gath RV before as well, but I couldn't really find anyone sporting one to check if it it'd even hold up in freefall in the first place. So I went with Rev2 and I love it. I also keep the visor down for the canopy descent, so far I haven't had any problems with it fogging up, the airflow under canopy is enough to keep it clear."

If the sound designer did their job properly, I wouldn't notice it in the first place. We're talking about wingsuits making jet noises and loud, clearly fake grass, FFS. It's the sound design equivalent of a Photoshop disaster."

The tubes are gone now but there is still slight openings. I just jumped a few times this past Sunday with no dramas.  I mean, definitely consult a doctor - as I am not one. I believe he'll give you the A-OK and fly through the skies! Happy diving!"

All day long, I was thinking about how life is irrelevant and how death is awful. I was litterally paralized by this feeling, for around 1 year and a half. One day I asked to myself ""What could I do so that if I die tomorow, I'd have no regret"", and I found the answer watching skydiving videos on youtube. 1 month later, I did my 15 first jumps in a week, and this is when my ""depression"" suddenly disappeared.  So, this is why I started skydiving, but know, things are way simpler:   I love the feeling I want to be good at it It boosts my self-confidence I love being at my DZ,with my skydiver friends."
SkyDiving,39cr9v,Addict7,6,Thu Jun 11 09:53:10 2015 UTC,"The tunnel will help you a lot with AFF.  Why do I do it? It keeps me from becoming too comfortable --- which prevents a stagnant and mediocre life. It shakes things up. Oddly enough, my favorite part of the jump is right before the exit, but I'm weird.  Skydiving will become a big part of your identity due to the amount of time that you must commit to the sport. Most people think that it is a hobby. In the warmer months, it will become your only hobby. So think hard, before you plunk down a ton of cash and put your life at risk.  For me, it has been one of my best investments. But for most people in a First Jump Course it won't be. Good luck."
SkyDiving,39cr9v,JeromeMorrow13,5,Thu Jun 11 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"For a minute at a time my brain is quiet. The bullshit of work, bills, family drama, what I'm doing with my life it all is silenced and replaced with singular focus. I'm solely in the moment and I'm focused on my body and on the passage time. Then I look at my friends faces: their student loan debt, their divorces, their struggle with cancer, their whatever is gone replaced with the same focus. And we smile because it's a wonderful shared moment of ""me too.""    After that's done, I get to play with a wing. My other, academic passion is aerodynamics, specifically a field called aeroelasticity. I study how fluids interact and deform structures and how the deformation of structures affects fluid flow. I can't think of a greater real-world playground for this field of study than flying a ram-air parachute."

SkyDiving,39dvag,yi44,3,Thu Jun 11 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"You have to look down to spot, but for AFF, you'll probably be instructed to look up at the wing as you exit. This helps you maintain a good arch. The desire to look down is natural, but it won't help your body position."
SkyDiving,39dvag,dapperrogue,2,Thu Jun 11 04:32:22 2015 UTC,"No, the Ti pulls a ripcord and deploys the drogue manually.  The drogue acts as a pilot chute and helps deploy the main parachute, staying above it.   Tandem harnesses suck really bad compared to custom built sport rigs and are definitely not comfortable, if not properly adjusted can definitely cut off circulation.  Your jumping a canopy sized for 2, it's considerably larger which results in requiring more effort to pull the toggles. Pulling down the center of your body mass vs trying to muscle it down outside like you've seen in all the photos helps too.   If you let go of the toggles they will just rest near where you unstowed them and will put the canopy in what's called full flight mode, nothing bad happens in clean airspace unless you drop one or both while flaring.  In Aff you'll be taught to spot when a good time to get out of the plane is, plenty of looking down before you exit.  Each jump you'll become more situationally aware and sensory overload will almost be non existent later. Everyone is different but don't be surprised when you recall details wrong the first 10 jumps or so until you tune it in."
SkyDiving,39dvag,GenoPath1,2,Thu Jun 11 09:04:54 2015 UTC,"No, the Ti pulls a ripcord and deploys the drogue manually.   The ones I've seen have been throw-out drogues. I don't think I've ever seen one deployed by a ripcord."

SkyDiving,39dvag,GenoPath1,4,Thu Jun 11 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, the initial deployment of the drogue on Sigma and Strong is throwout. The release of the drogue is through a ripcord on Strong and a bungeed pull handle (don't know how else to explain it) on Sigma. If the drogue had a ripcord, I've been severely missing something for my last 700 sigma jumps."
SkyDiving,39dvag,14gAGL,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"The bungee drogue release is still considered a ripcord, according to the Sigma manual. It's just not the same style of ripcord as on the old Vectors or the reserve ripcord."
SkyDiving,39bxx6,Chift,16,Wed Jun 10 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"I almost bailed a few times when I did AFF. Prior to AFF I did two tandems and a static line jump. Around AFF jump four/five or so while driving out to the DZ I pulled over to contemplate turning around and quitting, I was frustrated during a couple of the jumps with my skill level at the time, I questioned WTF I was doing with a parachute I knew nothing about, called my mom, etc. I had all the feelings you have and then some. Lost, scared, not knowing anyone, doubts of skill, unsure of gear, you name it. If there was a turning point for me it was when an instructor realized I was getting into my head too much and encouraged me to make a fun jump with him as my final AFF jump. I relaxed, didn't worry about a dive flow that I could fail, laughed, stayed altitude aware, and pulled a parachute on time. He recommended I do some tunnel time and graduated me from AFF. I did some solos and went on to get my license once I had enough jumps. Don't get me wrong, you should know your gear, stay aware, and how everything works, but relaxing a smidge and trusting my instructors when learning helped me go on to make about 500 jumps in my first year.  Good luck on your jumps today!"
SkyDiving,39bxx6,mamallo,5,Wed Jun 10 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to ask this, it kind of tacks on to this question- when do you start feeling like you're part of the community? Like an actual skydiver?"
SkyDiving,39bxx6,eldiablo_verde,3,Wed Jun 10 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"I think it varies. Some of the packers are ""in"" but have never made a jump. For me it was just before I got my license. I just for whatever reason didn't feel a part of it. Maybe because I was in college and only jumped once a month or because all my jumps were AFF and solo jumps, but I think it varies for everyone. You'll know when you think you're in. A lot of people think skydiving is for them and then quit after like 5 jumps so I think skydivers are kind of skeptical about letting people in. That's just how I felt at least."
SkyDiving,39bxx6,flyboy10029,5,Thu Jun 11 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"I've got a good post in this subreddit with many of your same feelings.  Everyone I've talked to with any significant amount of jumps has had very similar, if not the SAME ""what the hell am I doing"" ""what kind of sport is this."" ""What's the point?"" feeling, and then it clicks.    The best advice I got is ""push yourself to get your license, then revaluate"".  If I'm correct, you are pulling your own cord, but you have one or two coaches, plus your AAD too.    I'm going on jump 12 (16 if you include tandems).  I still get nervous, but I always have a blast the second I'm out the door.  Actually, I'm most nervous on the ground.  And I'm most nervous when I'm hungover (I stopped drinking) and when I'm tired.  When I'm well rested, I have a lot of fun"

I myself have never had any serious doubts about skydiving, but I can assure you that it all gets better after the first opening, after a few jumps you will sense the freedom that opening your own chute gives you. Just remember to relax, focus on the jump and arch.  Good luck! ;)"
SkyDiving,39bxx6,estonist,2,Wed Jun 10 19:53:32 2015 UTC,Ask yourself whether you are discouraged from a learning curve or you just don't want to do it.  It's an expensive and time consuming activity with risk. Do it for the right reason: enjoyment.
SkyDiving,39bxx6,soulstonedomg,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"I did the IAD program as well. For me it took literally 20 practice pulls to finally calm myself down and realize how easy opening your own canopy is. Throughout those 20 practice pulls and even after (50 jumps to my CSPA solo) I kept asking myself what the hell I was doing. For me it was wanting to go fly myself, I wanted the sensation so bad I pushed through it. I doubt it will take you that long to get a license but the reward from the inital mountain known as student progression is so sweet it is worth pushing through. Keep pushing, you'll be at the top soon!"
SkyDiving,39bxx6,lukevandale,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"on jump 15 now. The day of my first solo after aff i pulled into a Wal Mart parking lot and sat there for over an hour. When i got to the DZ I was in no hurry to get manifested and put on a load. The plane ride up is still nerve racking as heck, but as soon as I enter the sky its no worries, and the second i pull my shoot i still yell ""fuck yeah"". Youll see progression, set goals, oftentimes fail to achieve them on a specific jump, and work hard to achieve them. to me, thats what it is about, setting goals and achieving them, and feeling myself progress. So to answer your question, yes, i did doubt if it was for me, but love the feelings it gives me. not to mention the community."

SkyDiving,39avwq,jzzsxm,-2,Wed Jun 10 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"Skydive Oregon has a huge focus on customer satisfaction? You must be kidding, right?

SkyDiving,39avwq,Sky_Chick,2,Thu Jun 11 16:04:57 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem very responsible to claim a DZ doesn't prioritize safety for its tandem students by making veiled references to a mal a fun jumper had.
SkyDiving,39avwq,jzzsxm,-2,Thu Jun 11 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough....the customer service issue is still highly relevant here, though. For a first timer, being treated like cattle does not lend itself to a great experience. I have jumped at Skydive Oregon three times. Each time hoping for a better experience, unfortunately the ""vibe"" created by the blond lady in manifest cannot be overcome. She is awful! Kapowsin, a dropzone of similar size does a great job without creating a ""tandem factory"" experience. Maybe I am partial to Kapow because it's my home...but for jumping in Oregon, I can definitely say PNW skydiving is the way to go."
SkyDiving,39avwq,Sky_Chick,2,Thu Jun 11 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Kpow, and had an okay time at SD Oregon, Skydive Chelan takes the cake. Can't beat the views of the columbia river gorge. Now gimme the gold!"
SkyDiving,39avwq,mrluckylager,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:44:36 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're looking for a tandem. My two cents is that going to the highest altitude possible will not really enhance your experience, but if that's what you want then there's nothing wrong with it.  Kapowsin is probably your best bet -- they do tandems to 18K. They're definitely the only ones in Western Washington who do that, and possibly the only ones in the whole Northwest.  If you just want an ordinary tandem I can recommend Snohomish, Kapowsin, Jet City, or Chelan. Jet City and Chelan are probably the best views you can get (but again, on your first jump you might not be aware enough to really care).  I've also heard great things about PNW skydiving, but I've never been there."

If these guys breached the perimeter of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, would you feel any different? What if one of them had a mal and hurt/killed someone below?   I am empathetic because I'd imagine that prison is not a fun place -- but they had to have known that this outcome was a near 100% certainty. There are 5,000 cameras below 14th Street alone.

State trooper sitting in the dark clocked both bikes at a little over 180 mph. No lights just casually followed us. Rolls up on us when we exit and catch a red light and draws down on us. Other guy ran and the cop got me. I got charged with evasion and a few other things I didn't do. Got it plead down as a first offense and got 5 years probation, banned from touching any high performance motorcycle (I owned 5 at the time), and 100 hours of community service. Why? Apparently they had lots of people running from them and racing etc. I was the example they chose to set. They made sure my boss found out so of course I lost my job. That was a smaller Texas town. These guys will do federal time. At least a couple of years. I feel sorry for them, but the cops were right. Given the circumstances I could have hurt someone else. So I picked new hobbies that offer the same fun without fear of jail. Good luck to them. I hope they have an expensive lawyer. Mine cost me 5 grand but he was worth it. I was going to get at least one felony and jail time if it wasn't for him."

They broke into and jumped from the biggest terror target in the world, which also is a no fly zone. I did much less than that and nearly got thrown in jail. 10 years jail time is not getting plead down to time served and community service unless you get the friendliest DA and judge in the country. Are they being charged by the state of NY or by the feds? I assumed the feds but maybe not. At least Federal prison is a lot nicer that state."

You got screwed so everyone to come after you deserves the shitty end of the stick.  That in a way is the same hillbilly reasoning behind my granddaddy was a coal miner, my daddy was a coal miner, I'm a coal miner and my boy is going to be a coal miner.... That type of reasoning.  As for you having 5 super bikes, your history riding super bikes, and what your charges were and the evidence against you, what you claim may not be accurate.  I think another high profile case involving Jen Corliss and the Empire State Building comes to mind. That involved a great legal expense, plea deals, etc...   I keep seeing these guy beg the general public for cash for their legal defense fund. These are not broke individuals without means. The one jumper owns and operates a drop zone and if he needs to sell his interest out to fund his childish activities of jumper from a high profile landmark for jollies and lulz's that's what should be done.

I relayed my story about a prosecutor and PD that was looking to make an example out of someone. They are far less likely to deal when that is the case and I was just telling this guy not to get his hopes up that a 10 year felony gets dealt down to community service. They could get probation, but it's going to have a restriction just like mine. Theirs will be no BASE jumping I bet and if they get caught doing they go to jail. It seems obvious that this is what is happening to these guys. I didn't say they deserved, I said I deserved what happened to me because I was guilty of racing. I was also pointing out that they should raise some cash, as they are doing with these shirts, and hire a very expensive lawyer. I thought their BASE jump off it was cool, but a lot of people don't because it proved, once again, that ""security"" of any building is a lie. And some people find it disrespectful to 9/11 victims. But again, I don't know how you got that out of my post. All I intended to point out was if you are the example, it's hard to get a decent deal."

SkyDiving,395eyz,Rackelhahn,13,Tue Jun 9 11:25:07 2015 UTC,"Nice piece. As a still young jumper (only 550+ jumps now) and as being a female in the sport, there seems to be a lot of advice and opinions that come at you.   I think the greatest lesson I've learned in skydiving so far is to hear the stories, opinions, advice...and then sort it out and make my own decision. After all, once I put on my rig, climb the altitude and jump out that door, it is I who will have to deal with whatever happens next."
SkyDiving,395eyz,alethiaja,5,Tue Jun 9 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"Am I just as bad because I tell students on solo status, they can do whatever they want and try out new things on exit and for the first half of the jump?  The only things I tell them to be aware of:   current altitude back to stable belly at appropriate altitude perpendicular to jump run  no FF if rig isnt FF-friendly"
SkyDiving,395eyz,LukeCrouch,15,Tue Jun 9 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, they'll probably be fine."
SkyDiving,395eyz,caosborne,3,Tue Jun 9 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"IMHO, no.  Fulfilling the A License requirements pretty much...well, requires them to experiment.  As long as they're staying within reason as you said, and paying attention to their jump run orientation.  Plus, they're probably gonna do it anyway.  My first jump after AFF, I was flopping all over the sky seeing what I could do."
SkyDiving,395eyz,oddchihuahua,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"Within reason I guess. Trying barrel rolls and loops is one thing. ""Feel free to try new things""....""Okay, coach""...<The new Point Break is so rad>...heads down FF...  :("

SkyDiving,395eyz,chi1234,3,Wed Jun 10 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"Seeing new jumpers, eager to learn and absorb new information, it is important to give them the correct information. I was afraid at one point of doing four ways. I think an important part of learning is to have your boundaries. Friends are jumping and you're not sure about the wind? Trust your gut, time will give experience to when you're comfortable in those winds if ever. It's a shame people become complacent, but it is real and deadly.   I don't believe enough emphasis is put towards teaching new jumpers the importance of the canopy and the gear, the winds, etc. free fall is the easy part."
SkyDiving,395eyz,SkyMannn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:52:34 2015 UTC,"yeah but I'll probably be fine, right?"
SkyDiving,395eyz,chi1234,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:07:12 2015 UTC,"Golden advice. I dunno how many times a new rider came into our fold On an R1, ZX10, GSXR 1000, etc.. and it was their first bike. It's probably OK if they take the time to learn, but I saw at least 3 of them die in accidents. Usually their fault for high speeds. I tried in vain to tell one kid he was unsafe and got the usual fuck off. He died less than 2 months later. I'm just getting in to this sport, and frankly I'd rather not get advice that is probably ok. I'd rather be told not yet on something than get hurt."

SkyDiving,394ppb,negative4productions,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:50:07 2015 UTC,What happened?  Its hard to tell in the video how they got wrapped up.
SkyDiving,394ppb,reddit_user49,3,Tue Jun 9 22:55:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the way this video was edited didn't really do this incident justice, as it was kind hard to follow...  The guy who jumped first, Rob, circled around the second jumper, Scott, to try and film Scott jumping and falling. As Rob circled around and descended on Scott Rob collided with Scott and both of their chutes got tangled. Then, call it a miracle, but somehow they got untangled. Rob chute was still fully deployed so he landed safely. Scott's chute was collapsed and he spiraled to the ground. Luckily, Scott landed in-between two big rocks and his chute got caught on the top of the two rocks which broke his fall.  Incredible!"
SkyDiving,394ppb,negative4productions,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:50:12 2015 UTC,Thanks - was wondering

SkyDiving,397mmh,fortheadventure,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"You can't go wrong with Elsinore. Did my AFF there, but sometimes, it can get busy on the weekends (instructors, packed rig availability) to do more than a jump or 2  a day during AFF. Most summer afternoons get windy too and students would be put on hold. Consider that if you want to get your A license in a week!"

SkyDiving,397mmh,rambleonrose_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Skydive San Diego, 100%. I've never had a bad instructor or jump and the view is insane (Mexico, California, and the San Diego bay). They've pretty much got their operations down to a science, and that peace of mind makes for a much better jump IMO.  Are you talking about getting your AFF, or have you already done that?"
