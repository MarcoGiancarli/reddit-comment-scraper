Typically ""chain smoker"" is used to describe a person who smokes relatively constantly, not necessarily chaining each cigarette. The term applies primarily to cigarettes, although it can be used to describe incessant cigar and pipe smoking as well. It is a common form of addiction.

Nicest man you will ever meet.  As the graphic designer for the company, I was asked to replace some envelopes for their gift cards and discount cards as the ones they had were of low quality as my boss had done them all himself before and had no concept of design or resolution.   As I go through the box of old unwanted envelopes, I shit you not, THIS image was on the very front of it. A mentally challenged midget in a metal bucket. My boss had found this 'funny' and included it and deemed it suitable to give to customers in the shop.  Just no."

wtfstockphotos,2ksdow,romulusnr,3,Thu Oct 30 19:47:32 2014 UTC,"The carrot thing along with the donkey does appear to be a thing in economic theory. It seems that Priestly was simply modernizing the carrot in his analogy by calling it ""electric."" But... in this scenario... the woman is the donkey... and she has caught the carrot... which means she is not still chasing it...   Ah, so even if the donkeys (i.e. consumers) were to actually catch the (normally elusive) carrot (i.e. The Last Thing They Will Ever Need), they wouldn't even know anymore how to eat it?  And it would just electrocute them?  Ew."

wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,COYAD,22,Sat Aug 2 11:22:15 2014 UTC,"I'm Dutch and I can add a little context. Sinterklaas has a helper named Zwarte Piet, or ""Black Peter."" Piet is traditionally a slave, but nowadays to be politically correct they say that he is black from the soot in chimneys."
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,DanTheManVan,12,Sat Aug 2 20:07:01 2014 UTC,"I understand the cultural context, but in modern day america the Zwarte Piet thing gets more and more racist.  Black face, big red lips, low intelligence, slavery, it just gets better and better.  This can't be a fucking coincidence."
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,FelixR1991,5,Sat Aug 2 22:45:14 2014 UTC,"From an outsider POV it's pretty racist, though the negative things you named are never perceived that way by the intended audience - children getting presents. I do agree that measures have to be taken to change the racist underlinings this celebration has, because every year the vocal minority against this tradition gets louder and louder, while they are ruining what was once a festive childrens tradition, but has now become a shouting match."
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,TheFallenHero,0,Sun Aug 3 00:31:09 2014 UTC,I'm really failing to see how this isn't racist. Its through and through blackface.
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,best_of_badgers,9,Sun Aug 3 01:53:50 2014 UTC,"Blackface isn't racist in and of itself. It's considered racist in the context of the United States specifically because of the way it was used in minstrel shows during the Jim Crow period. But yes, the history of the Zwarte Piete is fairly racist, but most countries don't necessarily concern themselves as much as Americans with etymology of their traditions. If the tradition is implemented today in a way that doesn't offend any of the people in the culture in which it's practiced, who cares what it meant 300 years ago?"
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,TheFallenHero,-7,Sun Aug 3 04:35:50 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but are you the authority on what's offensive to people? Have you actually asked any black people if they'd find this offensive or racist?"
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,FelixR1991,6,Sun Aug 3 09:05:27 2014 UTC,Some do. The majority doesn't since they grew up with the tradition.
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,Zwemvest,2,Sun Aug 3 10:19:14 2014 UTC,Most Dutch Black people don't give two shits about the discussion.
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,Fingebimus,8,Tue Aug 19 16:21:44 2014 UTC,"It used to be. Now it's just the ""getting presents from someone who helped kids escape from a kid-eating butcher and helped slaves escape and employs them to make gifts for the kids. The previous explanation is that they used to be slaves, often now it's that their faces are black due to the soot and kids don't care.  Source: Belgian"
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,Zwemvest,1 point,Sun Aug 3 02:15:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's blackface. But, while I agree that it's racist, I'm going to play Devil's Advocate: it has lost that context, it's not a jab at black people, it doesn't represent them, it has nothing to do with them.   It would be racist because of the historical context. But that context is not there, Zwarte Piet isn't behind-your-back humor about black people. That's is from another time, another location.   The biggest problem is that people are offended by Zwarte Piet because they FEEL offended. If a culture doesn't know about the Swastika, and you move there, and feel offended because you see swastikas everywhere, do you have the right to be offended? The Dutch say: No, you do not have that right."
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,Zwemvest,0,Tue Aug 19 16:20:27 2014 UTC,"I'm aware of the intended audience, but the only reason this should be changed is so idiots don't get all up in arms and choose to be offended on someone else's behalf.  I personally don't care, I just think it's way out of left field."
wtfstockphotos,2cf0mk,Privacyaccount,3,Sun Aug 3 03:50:20 2014 UTC,"Both sides of the discussion are retarded. ""It's racist because it's blackface!"" ""It's not racist because it's tradition!"". You are both wrong, and both assholes."
