carcrash,3d9hes,Theropissed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:55:30 2015 UTC,"It would be true if all automobile construction were equal in design and safety but buses (especially public transit busses of any form) are usually spec'd to be much safer than the average car, and built completely different too.  There's a reason why it's somewhat safe to have no seat belts on a bus as opposed to a car.  Edit: another way to look at it is pedestrian vs automobile bridges. They both let you cross water but one can take more ""punishment"" aka weight than the other"

The former are designed to store energy in the batteries and run on electric power only when they can, better suited for small scale application.  </>pedant<>  PS the Chevy Volt is a gas-electric series hybrid, series is a cleaner approach for controls and it's looking like the way of the future. Meaning if you don't get a full-on electric car, you'll have a series hybrid, i.e. electric car with onboard generator  tldr parallel hybrids use the combustion engine and/or electric motor to power the wheels, it's a clunky process. series use the combustion engine to power the electric motor, which in turn powers the wheels"

carcrash,3cf7qu,MrFlagg,6,Tue Jul 7 14:22:50 2015 UTC,If you're breaking every traffic law by drifting it is. Otherwise...this is a perfect spot since people would be going very slow to make the very sharp turn.

These guys are driving ""project cars"" that they've probably cobbled together with limited funds/allowances. I suppose the driver also bit off a bit more than he could chew with that entry speed.

carcrash,3cc2we,rabidmonkeyman,4,Mon Jul 6 21:58:27 2015 UTC,Whenever you cross those medians or areas where cars typically don't drive there's usually dirt and debris.  My guess is that he lost traction and did not feel as though he could lean more to correct his angle.
carcrash,3cc2we,Shirosynth,3,Mon Jul 6 23:03:35 2015 UTC,It looked to me like he understeered. He didn't seem to intend to cross that median area. When you accelerate fast like they did you have to steer harder. Also a factor seemed to be target fixation.   Source: motorcycle rider for >2 years

That tactic probably works great against birds of prey, but not on a 3000lb metal machine that isn't going to change direction.  As I straddled it, I thought for a second ""he may make it"" and then I heard a faint metallic thud as my undercarriage made contact with the squirrel.  I was travelling ~45 mph at the time.  At no point did I think ""oh no I must stop"" or ""let me tap the brakes at least"".  There tons of cars behind me and one on my right side preventing me from changing lanes.  I knew this because I'm always checking mirrors as I drive to maintain spatial awareness of who's around me.

carcrash,3apkrk,Finaldeath,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"Mostly depends on the location. In the country side/up in the mountains there isn't much other traffic to deal with, so you do get there faster. In the city there are a million stop signs, stop lights, and tons of other cars to slow things down.  I live in Maine and tend to speed a lot due to the fact that it takes at least an hour to get anywhere you need to go (also...you can speed and save gas if you do it right, why else would a car get better milage on highways than in town...?)  However, speeding in the city is simply pointless and gets you nowhere any faster."

The white car wants to overtake the truck but can't, and brakes to wait while the car overtaking him moves past, and then he pulls out. At that point he doesn't check there's no-one coming up on him.
