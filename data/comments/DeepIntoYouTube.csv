DeepIntoYouTube,3dvx81,crackercrumb,0,Mon Jul 20 07:08:08 2015 UTC,I never said this was hate. I'm saying that just because fatpeoplehate is banned doesn't mean that reddit will be completely free of any criticism towards the obese.

DeepIntoYouTube,3dv916,primokarim,7,Mon Jul 20 00:00:06 2015 UTC,I think it's just the source material.   Spongebob has a lot of weird and funny bits that can be manipulated to be even more weird.   King of the Hill is a pretty straight laced show (although with some exceptions) and it's funny to kind of either subvert what the show was trying to do or just make it some kind of absurdist humor styled show.

As for your question about there being any well-run socialist organizations, I'm a big fan of the IWW but they've been sick and dying for about a century, and Socialist Alternative has probably gotten the farthest out of anybody by electing one of their members to the Seattle city council. For the most part though, most American socialist organizations seem more to be ""let's all pass around a cigarette while we shit all over other Marxists"" than genuine political organizations."
