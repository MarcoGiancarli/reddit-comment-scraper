Techno,3e4ch0,nebulasmoothie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:23:19 2015 UTC,Cool set. Dommune is easily the greatest most interment place to see a dj in the world.
Techno,3e4nga,JoshMilan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:57 2015 UTC,Best tune on one of the best comps of 2014 imo. Although Fixed Action Pattern gives it a run for its money.
Techno,3e3f36,fancyberzerk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:46 2015 UTC,Nice one thanks. I hadn't heard this one before though I am a big Kalkbrenner fan. I don't think Berlin Calling will ever leave my Ipod. Awesome album.
Techno,3e3uek,jean-claude_vandamme,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:53 2015 UTC,You should try /r/roma or /r/Italy too.

Techno,3e2p1f,Daegarn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"I listened to the whole thing.  Overall, it was well done.  Song selection was decent as was the mixing, no problems there.  The only negative feedback I could give was that it seemed like you went a bit strong with the reverb and I thought I noticed at least once where you set up a loop that was noticeable as it cycled.  I think your mix had a CLR-ish vibe to it and that several of the songs were ones I have heard on the podcast periodically, but do t get me wrong, I thought it was decent.  üëçüèª"
Techno,3e2p1f,sk4ht,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! I tried to go for a CLR vibe indeed. Appreciated!

Techno,3dyqao,intergritty,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:26 2015 UTC,Sure it's not more of a wee-woo? ;)
Techno,3dyqao,isoprax,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:26 2015 UTC,The only two songs that come to mind with that (horrible) description are Calabri 2007 and Warp 1.9

Techno,3dyqao,ehubinette,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:42 2015 UTC,Nice. Not very good tunes :D
