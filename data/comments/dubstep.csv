dubstep,3e55ax,tarheels90,3,Wed Jul 22 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"Oh god here we go again. Skrillex didn't kill dubstep and neither did anyone else. They make their own music because there is a demand for it. There is also a demand for the dubstep you want. Maybe the problem is is that Dubstep is an extremely broad term. The songs you like are still out there, and there are producers still making dubstep similar to what you want it to be. But some people want to go mental at parties with their heavy shit like Skrillex. Personally I think the more simpler tracks from Caspa are way filthier than Skrillex but thats just my own preference. There is such a variety of sounds in Dubstep to call it all dubstep. You named Cookie Monsta. One of my favorites. But he can also make a Skrillexy song. Dubstep producers also make a variety of songs and sounds themselves. No one killed dubstep. The dubstep you like is still out there and so is the dubstep you don't like. And this has nothing to do with countries. Yes the best comes from the UK in my opinion but America has dope producers too."

And was regularly produced onto 12"" vinyls?   Yes you dipshit. Yesterday.  First off over half the subreddit is fill of deeper shit. Secondly there are even MORE vinyl only labels now than before.  Also lol @ ""Caspa/Rusko/Cookie Monsta"" needing a subwoofer considering what they sound now.  inb4 engaging a troll post"
