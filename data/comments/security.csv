security,3duwcv,damfol,5,Sun Jul 19 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"Telling all of us your password methodology is. (I kid)  The only problems with that is that it doesn't guarantee a long password and causes you to have similar passwords across sites. Most passwords are broken not because they are easy for a human to guess but because they are easy for a computer guess, meaning they are short. Once an attacker uses a computer to guess one password, they can then potentially learn your methodology. So if there is any correlation between the two it makes it possible for the attacker to use a dictionary of passwords with similar methodology, or make up. This narrows down the possible passwords for them to choose from making it much easier to get into everything else."
security,3duwcv,tehfcae7182,4,Sun Jul 19 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"Building on what /u/tehfcae7182 said, use a password manager. Last pass is pretty good. During the recent breach they let us know how they do passwords... and it's really good. The tl;dr version is even though they got ""breached"" it didn't really matter, because of how they do things. They're a good password manager.  Once you have a password manager, just generate random passwords. If you're on Windows 7 (or above) click Start, type ""powershell"" and hit enter. At the prompt, paste this:   -join(33..126|%{[char]$_}|Get-Random -C 40)   And it'll give you 40 random characters. Like these:   \A/yc{R'@EUl;r!vI>x=KN1Ditkw7&b}^JaFjQH#  ~piN(m4G/7oJh9ekz#MyKx5.R{8]S361%@`FD>$_  HSC-#joF)0XB\~mzw7l/y!g]>:$9^,[dNe6q2W4u   These passwords will never* be cracked. Then just put the passwords into your password manager, make the master password something long and hard to guess, and you're good to go.   by ""never"" I mean that it would take literally millions of years for a computer to brute force it, because of how math works.  So tl;dr. Your method is not bad but it's also not good. It has flaws. The better method would be to use completely random passwords in combination with a password manager."
security,3duwcv,Pandemic21,3,Mon Jul 20 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"Some people have already chimed in on the issues your current system has, but I wanted to add a few more thoughts.   You're passwords don't have symbols, you should really consider adding those, it increases the keyspace and makes cracking harder. You need to increase the length, I'd suggest nothing less than 12, but 16 or more is getting a lot better. Entirely in line with what /u/Pandemic21 said, computers are one of the problems you face, but so are humans.  If you have a short password it's going to be easy to crack.  No question (thus the first point).  But as you undoubtedly know, one issue many people have is password reuse.  In this case, you'd have different passwords per-site, but you'd have a format someone would be able to figure out (fairly easily). ""tidder14U"" is not likely to give away your password system, but if I also have ""koobecaf20U"", I'm going to figure out your system with ease.  And sites get hacked all the time, so this isn't a nonissue.  Especially with a targeted attack (someone is tracking down your leaked passwords).   Some thoughts on point #3 - you can introduce some randomness to your system while still maintaining some reliable mental memory.  Here's an example idea, but I'm sure you can expand upon this based on your own personal thought pattern:   Take the first letter of the site name, and use you're favorite food that starts with that letter.  So for Reddit, you'd use ""rice,"" now your password would be:  tidder14Urice   This doesn't completely solve the issue, especially if your Twitter password is leaked and someone want's access to your Tumbler account, but it's a start.  At least they wouldn't know what your Facebook password is, without guessing a lot of foods.  And like I said you could use other things instead of foods (friends names, cities, bands, songs, movies, etc).  But both /u/Pandemic21 and /u/tehfcae7182 are right.  This still doesn't resolve the issue when a dedicated attacker has two of your passwords.  I know your Facebook password begins with ""koobecaf20U"" and just need to start brute forcing various foods that begin with an F at the end (koobecaf20Ufudge, koobecaf20Ufries, koobecaf20Ufondu...etc...).  So nothing is going to beat a purely random password, but you're certainly ahead of the soccer mom's using ""johnny2008.""  So...in sum...  The good news is your password isn't going to be crackable with a dictionary (most of the time).  But at the current length, it will be cracked eventually.  Add some symbols, increase your seed length (the static value).  And introduce some additional randomness to make figuring the system out more difficult.  And for real security, use random passwords and a password manager.  Edits:  Spelling & Grammar."
security,3duwcv,wrayjustin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is stupid. It's fully deterministic, and the ONLY thing that matters for passwords is how much information entropy (randomness) they have. You need an actual source of randomness, and human brains are TERRIBLE at actual random choices.   Use Diceware for passwords you have to memorize, and a password manager for the rest."
security,3duwcv,SAI_Peregrinus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:06:23 2015 UTC,"It's not stupid--it's better than most people use, but far from optimal. While it will protect you against shared-password attacks (where compromising your password on site A leads to a problem on site B), there are more manageable solutions.   Some sites will frustrate this approach by requiring mixed case or special characters. And then you're back scratching your head trying to remember the password. I know--I practiced a similar (but not nearly as sophisticated) method years ago. (Other sites will prohibit symbols, or numbers, or other stupid things.)  Also, there's very low risk with using relatively weak, even shared passwords on sites that don't really have much value or information you care about. (Microsoft recently published an academic paper on this.) If you must have a registered account, for example, to access your local newspaper, but beyond reading the news, they don't really have much value, use your method. It's fine. (I'd also recommend using a fake name and a secondary email account rather than the one you use with, for example, your bank.)  As others have written, the best passwords are passwords only computers can use--truly randomized strings that max-out both the length and complexity supported by each website.  I use LastPass with a Yubikey. This means, for example, that my Reddit password is over two dozen characters long, and contains the maximum variety of types of characters permitted. You'd still need my email address, too, and that's a unique, randomized address that I only use for LastPass. The only important password I know is my LastPass password, and, technically, I could type it here and not be that worried about being compromised. Buuuut...I won't. (Changing it from time to time is a good practice.)  You might ask: ""Wasn't LastPass breached?"" Why, yes, yes they were. One of the reasons I switched to LastPass a few years ago is that they made a disclosure statement when they had merely seen some anomalous activity on their network. That gave me a lot of confidence that (1) they were actively monitoring their systems and (2) that they had the culture of disclosing concerns to their customers. That, combined with their Yubikey support, helped me to make that decision."
security,3duwcv,Glowerman,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"And, yes, it's fully deterministic. I like the ""rice"" idea, above.  Right now your formula, where X = site name, is backwards(X) & (length(X)+vowels(X)) & ""U"" -- So your Citibank password would be knabitic11U ? That's not good enough for a banking site. knabitic11Ucheese isn't much better, but it's something. This method is good enough for non-critical sites. It's not good enough for financial services or email accounts.  ALSO: Turn on two-factor systems wherever possible."

security,3d7igp,tonyjoker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:39:59 2015 UTC,"Are you actually saying that a company you worked for had software on mobile phones to listen / record audio at will of either phone calls or just listening to anything the mic picks up??  To your actual question on why, actually most people AREN'T up in arms about the NSA or the government spying.  In general, most of the public, subscribes to the thought that they have nothing to hide, they don't do illegal things, and their life is boring, so who cares if the government snoops.  Essentially, they are ignorant on the level of spying that goes on by the government.  As far as why don't people get more upset about ""spying"" by their employer, well that is a pretty easy answer, because companies have every right to do so.  Almost every [adult professional] employee understands that there is a certain level of monitoring on company devices, and when connected to company connections regardless of device ownership.  At the very least, they understand that their internet browsing is probably monitored, and there are justifiable reasons for this: preventing porn, viruses, etc, and while not everyone likes it, they also acknowledge that the actions of a few hurt everyone, and that sites like facebook, or other non-work related sites may be blocked or monitored to reduce loss of productivity.  In the same way, they know and accept that their email has some level of monitoring, at the very least, that the company could go back and read all past messages in and out, thus most shy away from using company email for personal use.  The line is clear in the case of an employer.  If an employer owns the device or part of the connection, it is to be used for business, you have ZERO right to use for non-business.  To that end, there are numerous acceptable reasons for monitoring usage of employer owned systems to prevent abuse, and to protect the company legally.  Now, you can argue if an employer really needs to go to the level of snapshotting screens on a periodic basis, and I would content they probably don't need to do this, except in certain cases.  In my 18 years in IT, I can think of 2 times total where we installed some sort of software to monitor a user all the way down to screen caps and keystrokes.  2 users out of thousands and thousands I have supported.  If you are talking about the ability to remotely view a screen on demand, not actually recording screen caps periodically, that is a completely different use case.  99% of the time such tools are in place to provide remote support, not to spy on you live.  And most companies DONT have software that will allow you to connect to a machine and view the screen, without the user knowing.  I have only worked for 1 company that used such a tool, and we used it for support.  Every other company I have worked for that employed such remote tools, configured the tool to either ask permission or notify the user that someone connected to their system and was monitoring their screen.  And I have never seen a company that employed software to monitor a users personal computer.  Monitor the connection when they connect to the office, yes, but not their computer as a whole.  The only exception to this is mobile devices, where most companies have an extra layer of protection and ability to monitor a mobile device that is personally owned, but in almost all cases, the user is notified that since they are connecting their personal device to the corporate system, they can expect that they may monitor usage.  Lastly, you are comparing a completely different type of monitoring.  Government monitoring is monitoring EVERYTHING you do.  It is sucking up ALL data, and sorting through it later.  That includes what you browse, where you connect from, location data, spending habits, etc, etc.  This data is collected, and may be used against you criminally or in other negative ways.  Companies are monitoring far far less, and are usually doing 1 of 3 things: blocking inappropriate access, monitoring for troubleshooting / support / quality of service, and for legal protection.  In fact, most companies LOATH to keep monitoring data, and would rather they didn't have ANY personal data retained."
security,3d7igp,CJoshDoll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:32 2015 UTC,"I would read through, but your premise is wrong. As I wrote above, companies can monitor their assets AND the personal non company owned assets of the employer at home. I guess you haven't heard of Lexis Nexis or online tracking.   EDIT: After reading through.... I wish it was that simple of a issue of companies monitoring their asset and connections, but it's not. The technology is there for private sector e.g. online tracking and background tools such as Lexis Nexis to have all the information on you since you were born."
security,3d7igp,CJoshDoll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"If you can cite me a software, or example of where a company installed some sort of monitoring software on a personal owned device, to track all activities, without the knowledge of the employee, I would love to see it.  As previously mentioned, the only time you are going to see this is with BYOD scenarios, and companies arent interested in tracking extended data on employee owned devices, they are concerned with keeping devices they dont own from being a security risk in their network.  I think you are blurring what companies do to monitor employees, and companies in the business of collecting data on consumers.  There are absolutely companies that are in the business of selling consumer data, but what your original post was talking about was your employer snooping on you.  Employers arent snooping on employees for private data, and then in turn selling that data to other data broker companies - that would violate privacy laws, and it wouldnt take long for a whistleblower to come out.  As I mentioned before, employers want to retain as LITTLE personal information on employees as possible.  Lexus Nexus isn't making tools for an employer to spy on employees and then give that data to LN.  LN is, at its core, a giant database of public information, gathered from thousands of sources, searchable in one location.  So that if you want to find historical data on lawsuits about dog bites, across the entire nation, you can search it in one place, instead of trying to search every court in the US.  Certainly they have expanded into other data, but they aren't providing access to data that was gathered by employers on their users.  There are 3 very different issues you seem to be crossing lines with:   Government surveillance Big data and the business of consumer data Employer monitoring of users   The first 2 are very concerning, IMO, the third is hardly cause for concern, because they aren't trying to gather personal data about you.  TBH, I'm not sure what worries me more, govt surveillance, or Big Data.  While I don't feel great about our government, and I can see a day where simply searching for the wrong things could get you in trouble, or where, once you are under some sort of investigation, they [mis]use all the data that has ever been gathered against you in ugly ways, I think I more fear Big Data, because in their model, with enough money, you can buy whatever you want, and the implications of all that data and how it could be used are quite frightening.

Also, I'm not talking about companies as a whole, but more along the lines of personnel inside a company may have easy access to tools to snoop someone's private data.

A prime example was a grocery store loyalty card.  Not only do they know how much you spend, who you are, your email / phone / address / etc, but they also know everything you buy, and she warned that a day would come, where insurance companies wanted to buy access to that data so that if you had high blood pressure, but you were buying an above average amount of salt or salty products, they could raise your premiums, for example.  Those are the types of uses that get scary to me.  And shit, if Target can determine someone is pregnant, and they dont even USE loyalty cards, thats even more scary.....but hey, just put lawn mowers across from the strollers in the ad, and everything is all better (that was their solution).  Another good read is on deanonymizing data.   Off the top of my head, a good one is the guy that took the anonymized uber data a year or so ago, and was reliably able to correlate a lot of it to actual people.   And there have been countless cases like this.  This is where things like Watson scare me.  So Watson wants to read medical records to help predict patterns and help find cures and treatments - that sounds amazing - until that data that was supposed to be anonymous gets correlated to people.  And given all the types of data they feed or want to feed to Watson, now you know a LOT more about me than just my medical history.

When my house got a new smart meter from the power company, my first fear was that now they can up my costs based on when and how much I use energy, or even limit my usage.  At one point, my old power company was giving away free nest thermostats, but there was a provision that they had some type of access to the data from the Nest (that may not have been valid, may have been a cover all EULA, I didnt look into it).  THIS is really the issue facing us today.  We have all just blindly accepted giving away our data for apps and cloud services.  We did it blindly in the beginning, thinking that companies would act appropriately, and we should have known better.  But now we are at the point where it doesnt really matter anymore.  People are so entrenched in their devices for ease and convenience, that they will hesitantly continue to give up more privacy to keep using them.  Would the average user go back to using static incar navigation even if they knew google maps was tracking every move and selling the data?  Most would keep using google maps, the alternative sucks.  I often wonder if this was planned.  Did companies (or the govt) plan out stealing a little privacy at a time, but giving us great tools in the process, so that when it got to the point that we noticed, we would be too deep to turn away and take back privacy?  The solution is privacy based products, and we are starting to see them hit the market.  But there are some tools and services that simply require our data to function, and a small company might protect your privacy, but likely the tool will be clunky and not as good, and there seems to be a point that all companies reach where they have to start finding new ways to monetize, and using our data is just too easy.  I dont really have an answer, I dont know if there is one."
security,3d7igp,amber102,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"The thing about the IOT is that many people connect all their devices to the same network (ie 192.168.0.x).

Many of these devices will be connected by what microsoft windows calls ""Private Network"" so that they can see each other locally. All it takes is one Compromised device, the use of some ARP spoofing, worms etc. and some serious security risk is present.  Most modern routers have the ability to enable multiple separate Guest networks, for separation. But I suspect most people don't bother with these.  It has already been conformed that a version of UC Browser was targeted for this purpose.

It costs a minimal amount of money (free if your identity has actually been stolen). The sole downside is that you have to unlock them before applying for future credit.

security,3co0yp,746F7475,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:02 2015 UTC,"So you are talking about a bug in self driving cars A.I. that would cause a crash? Or a faulty sensor feeding incorrect information, thus tricking the A.I. to do something unexpected?  In case of crash there probably is safety mechanisms in place, i.e. brakes will lock as soon as the A.I. stops responding, a dead-bot-switch if you will.   In case a sensor feeds wrong values, I'd imagine there were multiple sensors and if one is off from the rest it's deemed malfunctioning and needs to be replaced.  Then again you talk about smart devices. So like A/C or Navigator? Obviously neither should be connected to your cars main computer, but manufacturers make them as one unit to save money. So in theory, yes a bug in these connected equipment can cause unexpected behavior in the car. There has already been some hacks that take over the cars steering, acceleration and brakes and few cases where allegedly car's brakes just suddenly stopped working while driving and steering locked up causing a crash.  I don't know if I addresses any of the issues you have, feel free to ask more specific questions and I can try my best to answer, but I'm no expert, so everything here is just speculation and half-educated guessing."

You can always get certifications too, which are a minor time sink compared to a degree. And information security is one of those fields that respects self-driven learning - you can probably learn about a specialty and even write published papers on it without a degree.   That said. If you want to work for the FYI, a degree in finance or criminal justice, or even better, law. CIA likes people with experience in languages. Psych can help with social engineering or policy design. MBA helps management types or consultants. Really, you can leverage just about any secondary area of expertise somehow. I'd recommend designing a career first."

The cases they work on often include child exploitation, corporate crimes like embezzlement or espionage, and organized crime. I haven't heard much about ""hunting serial killers"", though I guess it's possible. I think those types of cases tend to be investigated the old-fashioned way, with digital investigators brought in to consult as needed (for example, to investigate a victim's phone to search for contacts and history).  A background in finance or accounting is helpful because cybercrime often involves an exchange of money, and exchanges can be used as evidence. Understanding the connection between financial records on a series of suspect computers can crack a case. Additionally, I just tend to find financial educations are sought after in infosec because they cross so often.  Is psych helpful? From the perspective of understanding people, sure. In fact, I know several people with psych degrees who work in infosec. I just don't see it specifically sought out by employers, so it might not be a great investment unless you have a specific use for it in mind. Good luck - feel free to message me if you have more questions."

security,3bxj91,grasshopper_jo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"InfoSec stands for Information Security.  It sounds like you are doing a lot of routing/switching/firewall networking education and because that's the entry point into a network they are including security.  Unfortunately, network security is one slice of the Security industry.  As the other respondents have posted, you can gain experience in every conceivable role in security.  If you want to ""hunt"" the ""bad guy"" and given your education (and my assumption is correct) you may want to look at companies that specialize in threat intelligence and incident response.  Both of these security roles deal with ""hunting"" through logs to find what an attacker or suspicious actor has done/is doing within the system.  If you think it's going to be like anything you see on TV, you're going to have a bad/boring time.  If you like putting 5000 piece jigsaw puzzles together, in the dark, one piece at a time, then you'll like ""hunting.""  Also, in addition to other degrees or certifications, experience will be just as necessary for a job in the federal government's cyber crime positions."

Login email and password get picked up as part of a database of thousands, and the hacker throws them at various other services, right?    Sure, it'd be obvious what my passwords are if someone looked at them specifically, but the fact that my passwords are all non-identical means that if a database containing one of them gets run against other stuff, it won't grant easy access for an automated process."

All your passwords aren't strictly ""tied to a master password"" since you can also implement 2-factor authorization as an added layer.

And I'm sure there are hackers doing it for fun already.

Youre going to end up with a shit ton of passwords still.  You can go the route of trying to use a single secure password that is modified by something site specific, but this may not work with password changes as well.  I know you are against it, but a password manager is really the better answer.  You /may/ be sacrificing some potential security, but you are sacrificing at least the same amount by using the same pass across multiple services.  You can always go to a password manager without a cloud element, which means someone now also needs physical access to your datafile to try and gain the master pass.  Plain securitywise, a password manager with a strong master, and 2factor authentication, is going to be orders of magnitude more secure than your proposed solution."

And not that he's confusing the two, and he does muddle them, but the differences aka the importance of using the two in conjunction. Yeah, if I get the key to your house that's bad because then your house thinks I'm you which it's supposed to because houses don't always have consciousness (see Disney Channel Original Movie, Smart House) and that's the way the authentication system is designed: whomever holds the key is the owner.  What's important to remark is that encryption is what keeps you from getting that key in the first place.  It's not authentication's job to be pissed when the person coming into the house isn't the actual owner because the authentication system is simplistic and it's done it's job.  Good job, door.  ""Make it harder"" is actually an attempt to make security feasible.  Shannon's original idea was the idea of Perfect Secrecy which is just unreasonable in the modern environment.  If you want the best feasible approach then start talking about Forward Secrecy but that is difficult as well! Doing anything perfectly is difficult and honestly I don't think that's what cybersecurity is about.  In a landscape that is constantly changing and improving in ways that we can't foresee, we have to adapt with it so creating a strict definition of security only harms those who are trying to protect.  So we go for a definition that's more like  ""I will build the best wall in the land!"" ""Oh, really? I will build the best catapult in the land!"" ""Ha! You thought you could fool me?! Metal Plating"" ""Instead of rocks I'm going to launch Sonic the Hedgehog wielding a flamethrower""  ""Son of a bitch..."" And it's a competition because no one is going to do it perfectly the first time so we say, ""Hey, nice flamethrower, Dr. Robotnik has this sweet water gun he'd like to try out""  TLDR I disagree, cybersecurity is about what's feasible not what's perfect.

Things I don't care about (social media and website logins for things that don't matter to me), things I moderately care about (email), and things that really matter (financial).  I don't care if someone breaches my social media accounts or my account at Splunk. It is quite irrelevant to my existence so they get shared passwords. The worst thing that could happen is I have to go change the password and delete some stuff that they've done. I wouldn't even be in a rush to fix this if it happened. These passwords are also the ones I use the most so it's handy to be able to remember it easily.  Email has a bit more critical info in it so it gets a complex password that isn't shared with anything else.  All of my financial sites either get 1) Very random complex passwords that are used nowhere else. 2) Simple passwords with 2-factor authentication.  Easy peasy and it takes risk into account. But this whole IF YOU ARE SHARING PASSWORDS BETWEEN ANY TWO SYSTEMS YOU MUST CHANGE THEM NOW OR YOU WILL BECOME A HUMAN SACRIFICE TO THE HACKER GODS rhetoric is neither practical nor effective."

Each with the same level of complexity and expiration requirements surrounding them.

Why spend the time recovering accounts/data when you wouldn't have to in the first place?"
security,3bgpcb,shermerilli,2,Tue Jun 30 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you use Facebook authentication which comes back to the question of data criticality. If you are using Facebook as a means of central authentication for things that you actually care about, then you need a more complex password that is unique or better yet, use two-factor, or even better, don't use Facebook authentication for anything that has PCI data, PI, IP, or anything else of value. I might have a couple of things tied to my Facebook account but I likely care even less about them than I do Facebook - if that's even possible.  You make a solid point about password resets sent to email so it may be worthwhile to use two factor there if you are concerned, or if you are less concerned use a complex unique password which I already suggested. The second one being subject to password phishing and keyloggers.  I disagree that all accounts should be treated like a flat plane. Accounts (like everything else) only need to be protected according to the data or process that is behind them. Sometimes I just need to keep out the people that idly try passwords because it's a minor pain to deal with it if it is breached, but a massive pain to remember dozens of passwords or have to look them up in KeePass or LastPass every time. If something has no value behind it then I categorize it as a low value target and give it my standard password.  Risk is a basic tenant of security. As a security professional the one immutable security rule I have discovered is that it is impossible to protect everything. There are not enough resources to devise, implement, and manage security controls on non-valued assets. No one will pay for it and nor should they. You need to classify your assets according to risk and focus on protecting what is important."
security,3bcsij,alexcasalboni,3,Sun Jun 28 00:13:30 2015 UTC,Well that's.. Scary. I wonder how easy they will make it to be blocked by filters or if it's actually a decent service that cares enough to make sure they don't get blocked.
security,3bcsij,kizzzzurt,2,Sun Jun 28 12:15:31 2015 UTC,"They will only send phishing emails if you verify your domain, and then the email addresses will be limited to the domain you verified. There is nothing to fear, this service is to help protect your staff from malicious attacks by training them to identity phishing emails."
security,3bcsij,zingplex,2,Sun Jun 28 14:39:54 2015 UTC,Ah okay. I actually think this is a good service then.   They still aren't really accredited by anything of note though..
security,3bcsij,kizzzzurt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:34:38 2015 UTC,"You have to enter credit card information ""in case someone clicks."" They charge you for the phishing attempt. I don't imagine too many employers will try this."
security,3bcsij,gorske,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:35:41 2015 UTC,"I think they may be trying to be a go to business level, quick and easy, solution to test employees competency to notice typical phishing email. I could definitely see the benefit for companies without security teams.   They need to work on their reputability more than anything though, as without being verified by various organizations it's not worth their time to try to find customers that aren't completely nefarious."

security,3bain6,atom138,2,Sat Jun 27 20:21:25 2015 UTC,Anything accessible by authorized means is accessible by unauthorized means. The only way to have something 100% secure is to have it be 100% inaccessible.
security,3bain6,hatessw,7,Sun Jun 28 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"Good luck with that: previously having to account for transmission errors and redundancy ensured leeway for attackers, sometimes making the use of quantum cryptography much less safe than current algos.  If this has a way to gracefully deal with transmission errors though, it could be promising."

security,3bain6,WizardMK,4,Sun Jun 28 00:17:01 2015 UTC,"Problems with implementation as mentioned. Quantum Crypto (QC, pls) is also limited by range. Very limited by range. Need a perfect photon source. Takes time, unless the process can be automated. Unsure about that part.   Cool thing about QC is eavesdroppers can suck it. Due to QC no-cloning theorem and the way measuring photons works, we have pretty solid encryption. Even if Eve intercepts every photon basis transmission/value, Eve still can't do much with the information because all the measured photons will have altered states, giving inaccurate information.   QC is great in the security area, as most modern crypto systems are. It's just the human aspect of it that brings it down. Humans err."
