Not only that, but it seems that some colour combinations that make sharp edges make round edges, while others make pointier or bumpier edges.

They're faster than ps, but they take some getting used to. I'll need to start using Vegas or Premier for longer animations. If I ever do that, might as well crank up the Ableton Live and Reaktor for some trippy audio...  Maybe learn After Effects to cheat and make them even more trippy-- for the time being, I don't know if this comes across--but I am mimicking CGI in analog form (though, not ideally using a digital camera)"
unstirredpaint,23bg3l,matt01ss,1 point,Fri Apr 18 10:51:09 2014 UTC,Yah cool... for some reason I thought you were shooting Canon.  I've been meaning to check out Dragon Stop Motion as it was recommended to me the other day at the local camera shop.  You may also want to check out CS6 scripting. I actually worked for Adobe in the early 90's on PhotoShop automation and to this day it is still fairly limited. Scripting in PS really opens up the scope to explore all sorts of different things. It's fairly easy to pick up but very difficult to put down.   I am mimicking CGI in analog form   I like this thought a lot. I presume you've spent time at /r/chemicalreactions?
unstirredpaint,23bg3l,arseiam,2,Sat Apr 19 03:01:10 2014 UTC,"Oh boy. thank you for the link. I knew of it, and I've been wanting to learn basic chemistry for these projects... yet I somehow didn't put two and two together. did you mean /r/chemicalreactiongifs?  I had to figure out basic scripting already. Rotate, resize. I don't know how to do some things; the ""legacy"" tools in there can sometimes be very counter-intuitive. I'm glad all that functionality is still there with no changes though, because I learned this stuff a long time ago, and I can pick it up within minutes.  The thing is, /u/matt01ss makes gifs that are magic.   Oops, apparently he does use photoshop--I thought I've seen a tutorial of his using a bunch of shell programs, I'll have to dig through his tutorials again.  Thing is, I'm not yet sure how he gets such quality gifs. I hope I can just do it in photoshop. This is the best I could do so far.   On another topic, (I bet my art should indicate a tendency for magical thinking), it seems there is an invisible hand guiding me in a certain direction. My camera broke the day I did my first gif--not completely--but the shutter timer fails above 1/100th of a second. This means I can no longer do the fast paced still photography I was doing before, and am now forced to learn how to do things I previously preferred less.  So basically, now I'm stuck with making gifs and tripod shots. I don't have any equipment for that, though... I have an old table lamp, some Christmas lights... one or two leds... Setup and shooting the shorts now takes hours instead of being able to shoot a set and develop in lightroom in 40 minutes.  But then I would not have made those awesome gifs, which I actually really like. It feels like when you were a kid and had some legos and you built something, and you just get to keep it.  I had this idea of recreating the tarot major arcana cards in gif form.  Let me know if you have any more words on cheap lighting techniques, and what you use for rigging. My table lamp isn't really going to cut it, methinks.  Btw, dragonSM is really buggy. The preview image keeps getting tinier with every take... it's rage inducing, but I'm not sure there is more than another decent alternative."
unstirredpaint,23bg3l,arseiam,2,Sat Apr 19 12:35:50 2014 UTC,"I use good high quality source footage to begin with. I do all the editing for text, effects, etc. in After Effects. I render out a png image sequence and then import it into Photoshop where I save/export as a gif.  I have some older videos that show how to compile the gif without using Photoshop. It uses ImageMagick and gifsicle but you won't get the perfect quality like you can with Photoshop."

As for what color specifically, you can normally guess by whats there.  A bunch of reds and yellows is an orange-y color.  Blues and greens make... blues and greens!  if you see a mix of colors from all over (any combo of the primaries, red, blue and yellow.  this includes things like red and green (blue and yellow) or blue and orange, or any brown), the color is either a brown or a grey, depending on how much of each is used."

It is located in the Midway Geyser Basin.  Grand Prismatic Spring was noted by geologists working in the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871, and named by them for its striking coloration. Its colors match the rainbow dispersion of white light by an optical prism: red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.

I've never used a more rewarding medium in my life, I have a lot of fun with it.  I met another person on here yesterday that does psychedelic macro shots, but not of paint. We exchanged about lighting techniques though, and ours were quite different. (I don't just do paint)  I'm glad I found this sub; though it's not specifically the right place, I'm glad to know that other people appreciate the same things as I do.   Keep posting. ;p"

I'm really enjoying digging through your work. I'd love to see them printed in big and hanging in my studio. So great to see others here that find inspiration in paint/objects/macro. This is a sample of my sort of work though I really love paint and plan on doing more with it.

While Behr generally sells better due to several reasons (higher quality, larger color selection, more up front shelf placement), Glidden almost always looks cooler un-stirred!  This is because due to it's lower quality and sell rate, the contents of unmixed Glidden cans normally separate into a clear top layer and an opaque bottom layer.  This allows the colorant to fall in, and slow down in the clear part before disappearing in opaque part.  In Behr, it almost always just drops in and vanishes in the solid white opaqueness.

unstirredpaint,1kz7qo,gigsnshits,6,Sat Aug 24 00:49:35 2013 UTC,Here's the mixed result http://imgur.com/FkZ7Xu5
unstirredpaint,1kz7qo,YouListening,5,Sat Aug 24 00:54:11 2013 UTC,I find it crazy that that color came from the beautiful eye.
unstirredpaint,1kz7qo,unseenarchives,3,Sat Aug 24 14:50:31 2013 UTC,Thanks for sharing the mixed version! I was really wondering what the final product would look like.
unstirredpaint,1kz7qo,ThePeskyWabbit,5,Sat Aug 24 16:16:07 2013 UTC,reminds me of an eye

unstirredpaint,1kz7qo,Rvish,3,Sat Aug 24 01:35:31 2013 UTC,Oh my shit I was about to come here and say the same thing!
unstirredpaint,1jxg8f,Bdoiron,3,Thu Aug 8 02:20:33 2013 UTC,The camera flash kind of hurts the photo but I'm slowly honing my technique.
unstirredpaint,1jxg8f,sickicarus,5,Thu Aug 8 02:22:09 2013 UTC,"Awesome pic, thanks for sharing!"
unstirredpaint,1jxg8f,TripleFFF,2,Thu Aug 8 04:45:09 2013 UTC,":D this is great! I'm so happy I'm still part of this subreddit community, I'd forgotten about this page :)"
unstirredpaint,1jutv1,Bdoiron,3,Wed Aug 7 02:21:51 2013 UTC,This is really beautiful! And cool!  Got any other pics? I can see your fingers :/  Did you stir it?
unstirredpaint,1jutv1,sldyvf,3,Wed Aug 7 12:36:25 2013 UTC,"I did not stir it, it was a clear urethane and I have many more, ill upload some more after work !"

unstirredpaint,1itue9,hustlecat,14,Mon Jul 22 18:43:41 2013 UTC,I'm really glad you posted the mixed results. I know it's a bland colour but while I love the beautiful unmixed pictures I always want to see the mixed!
unstirredpaint,1itue9,sldyvf,5,Mon Jul 22 20:00:56 2013 UTC,That picture was more uninteresting than I expected.  Now I'm sad.  Nice sunset though.
unstirredpaint,1itue9,The_Comma_Splicer,2,Mon Jul 22 19:04:21 2013 UTC,"Thanks, it's always kind of disappointing seeing how bland the colors come out to be."
unstirredpaint,1itue9,Miss_mustache,3,Tue Jul 30 17:26:56 2013 UTC,Here's what I see.
unstirredpaint,1hnodm,gigsnshits,6,Thu Jul 4 21:47:20 2013 UTC,"Don't mind the yellow, it's just the base!"
unstirredpaint,1hnodm,yelnnek,3,Thu Jul 4 21:48:00 2013 UTC,"Oooh, those yellow bases give me a headache to look at sometimes. :P"
unstirredpaint,1hnodm,darth_mo,6,Fri Jul 5 12:12:54 2013 UTC,"I wish we could see the stirred up result, too. Thanks for posting!"

unstirredpaint,1eucqr,Pykoh,1 point,Thu May 23 05:00:27 2013 UTC,"I'm a bit confused, is this just leftover paint? Or are they storing it in a cardboard box?"
unstirredpaint,1eucqr,Jaybro85,5,Thu May 23 04:19:07 2013 UTC,Its mandatory to clean out the machines in the morning. We do this by purging each colorant out of both machines into a box.
