cookingvideos,3e5eju,ManCaveCooking,7,Wed Jul 22 02:22:18 2015 UTC,Love the cooking & tips. The audio needs help - I can't hear the instructions because they drop to the background and the music stomps on them.   I'd get more out of it with no music or really really quiet music.
cookingvideos,3e5eju,Obvious0ne,3,Wed Jul 22 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"quick video tip: record all of you making the recipe with the camera on a tripod. then cut it up so that you only have snippets of video where you're demonstrating steps. if you want, at this point you can adjust the lighting/coloring on various snippets.  record the audio segment later on, and again cut it up and line it up so that you only have instructions with the snippets.  for music, do a temporary loud portion in the beginning, or keep it always low volume as background noise."

cookingvideos,3du832,blind_man_at_an_orgy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"i use this dough recipe  I use this pizza sauce. It tastes exactly how i want it to, and theres no point making my own for 4x the effort and 2x the cost when this tastes how i want already. you can thicken it by cooking it down a bit if you really want.  for cheese, i use fresh mozzarella but i highly recommend using dry or aged mozzarella if you can find it. i cannot without spending another 6 bucks in gas to get to a special snobby organic food retailer, so i use fresh. Be forewarned that it will contribute heavily to the water coming off of your pizza and sitting on top.  I brown sausage beforehand till its just barely turning brown at the edges and i put pepperoni, onion, and green peppers on mine. mushrooms are good too. i recommend pre-cooking all of this and putting it on 5 min before the pizza is done, but usually i just throw it on there because screw it.  I use a standard lipped cookie sheet thing. not a flat sheet. i rub it down with olive oil and press the dough down firmly in the direction it needs to spread to. if i stretch it, it tears prematurely half the time, so ive found pressing to be the best method. This will take a lot of the airyness and whatnot out of your dough so i'd recommend letting it sit for a little bit after you do this and making your dough a little more moist than normal (expanding steam = puffiness).  i keep my oven at 450-475. 500 is too hot, and this temp yields a golden brown, fried dough outside with soft bready inside."

Given the thinness (is that a word?) of the dough and the wetness (is that a word too?) of the sauce, putting more would have end up in a culinary catastrophe.  A solution would be to reduce the sauce beforehand to thicken it a bit and concentrate the flavors : then you can put a lot more on the pizza. It's what I do."

cookingvideos,3dswa4,ihcTactics,0,Sun Jul 19 05:25:35 2015 UTC,Does it work? Sure. But it's not very flavorful. There are probably a bunch of easy spices or simple flavors you could throw in during the mixing stage (maybe a drop or 2 of vanilla extract) that would give much more taste to the ice cream.
cookingvideos,3dswa4,amrcnpsycho,2,Sun Jul 19 06:58:12 2015 UTC,Yea I was thinking the same thing.  I think it's a good idea if you don't have a churner and are an apartment dweller or something.  It seems like whipping the cream by itself somewhat makes up for a lack of churning during the freezing process.  More of an interesting technique video than a recipe video to me.

cookingvideos,3cyojp,p3ppino,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:20:38 2015 UTC,Garlic is not really water soluble.  It is fat soluble.  Boiling it will mellow it so it can be worthwhile to do (after it is cooked you can include it without its harshness) but in this recipe looks like a waste.

That's the reason I'm subscribed to the channel. This appears to be a promotion for a separate channel, Family Food Tube, which is directed towards parents.  Typically I wouldn't mind, but in this case it interferes with the typical upload schedule, with this video replacing a slot where better content could have appeared instead. Not a big deal, all things considered; just my two cents."

Well, at least I saw it on Good Eats.  Watch his episode on Cheese.  He makes a Grilled Cheese that way.  As he does, he mutters ""I don't need to 1,000 panini press...""  And here I am... only now realizing I've had a Panini press all this time...  A note:  I find cast iron works best, and I find heating on the stovetop (until it smokes a bit), rather than in the oven, works best."

cookingvideos,3cjuxz,jhaake,2,Thu Jul 9 02:09:27 2015 UTC,"Try sticking an entire sandwich in a toaster.  In all serious though, toasting bread in a toaster is very different from toasting buttered bread on a pan. I rarely use my toaster when making toast."
cookingvideos,3cjuxz,amrcnpsycho,2,Thu Jul 9 02:28:42 2015 UTC,This is a weird question but how do you do it.  I find I only get decent results if I butter it ala-grilled-cheese-style.  I'm a simple guy living a simple life; I don't own a toaster or a toaster oven or a microwave but sometimes when chicks come over I make them avocado toast.
cookingvideos,3cjuxz,jhaake,3,Thu Jul 9 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"I find I only get decent results if I butter it ala-grilled-cheese-style   Exactly that I think.  I heat up a pan, butter a piece of bread, put buttered bread on pan and toast both sides. Best toast ever."

cookingvideos,3botvb,FloydMarley,2,Wed Jul 1 00:23:32 2015 UTC,I believe it's prepared the French way and I think the cheese is cheddar and brie. I'm hoping someone sees this and knows exactly what's in it and how it's made.

""Salad Rocket""  Double Edit: Looks like this, duck confit, grill, adds crispy duck skin on top, throws the cheeses down right on the flat top to soften up. I would guess he did 4 goudas, 3 cheddar, 1 bleu. Buns cut, grilled, sweated or braised red onion added to bottoms, honey mustard added to bottoms with onions, Arugula added, meats with cheese added, honey truffle oil added, top bun, serve. This is my best guess."

cookingvideos,3botvb,mqrocks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say so at all. Duck confit is pretty easy to make and probably the ""hardest"" part. Check out these 2 links, the first video isn't really how to make confit, but if you're using a whole duck I really like this method on cooking it. Comes out super super delicious. I would probably skip the ginger though. Second link would be a more traditional way to make it, but essentially the same thing. Basically just salt, pepper, garlic, thyme, and slow cooked in an oven for a long long time. Basically like a roast chicken.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb-pXczfe7A  http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/duck-confit-102313  Looking at the video, I would assume the duck before hitting the grill is already piping hot since you can see them in the background deboning it. If it was cold I highly doubt it would heat evenly though the way he is cooking.  As for the rest, it could be done with off the shelf stuff from a higher end grocery store. If you can cook a burger I'm sure you can make this. The red onion I would guess is just thinly sliced and sweated down in some olive oil in a pan. Honey Mustard and the truffle honey could be bought pre-made again from a nicer grocery store."

cookingvideos,3bibf1,bdt01,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"I enjoy your videos (I watched the previous one you posted as well).  The only critique I have is that your lighting makes things a little difficult to see.  I know that you're just recording from home, but maybe consider switching from florescent bulbs to LED bulbs to capture more light levels.  Also try not to film with a source of light directly behind you (like in the intro of this video), this causes a silhouette effect.  Aside from that, I am excited to try this dish.  I usually do lazy spaghetti (boil noodles, chop onions, peppers, etc, drop everything in sauce), this looks like a nice alternative for a quick meal without getting too complicated.  Thanks!  Keep up the good work!"

cookingvideos,3bibf1,ABSTRACTlegend,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:33 2015 UTC,I feel like any other type of noodle would work better in this dish besides Spaghetti. Rigatoni I think would work perfect for this dish.

cookingvideos,3b0850,Mr_IDGAF,3,Thu Jun 25 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"Ooh good question. I've only ever used it in Heston Blumenthal's Perfect Bolognese, but discarding the bones is part of that recipe so I always have a good chew.   Hmm. It's got tons of delicious, unctuous beefy flavour, not unlike short ribs but not as rich. The meat is springy (and gristly when not cooked for a good few hours), but not tough. It's quite unique. And HB calling it perfect for bolognese is a massive stamp of approval. It's a huge pain in the ass to debone if you try to do that before cooking. Worth cooking first."

cookingvideos,3b0850,bowofartemis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:14:34 2015 UTC,"Well, £6.50 a kilo isn't THAT cheap, but it's less than short ribs, about the same as cheap beef mince and a lot less than any kind of steak.   I guess it's relative. What are you using as a standard of comparison when you claim that it isn't cheap?"
cookingvideos,3b0850,lonelynoose,2,Thu Jun 25 12:02:02 2015 UTC,ahh...this makes more sense I guess?? Where I am $6.50/lbs would be a great sale. Paying aprox $10 for 2lbs would be insane. Average I've seen where I am is around $7-8 per pound. Oxtail is definitely a treat here.

cookingvideos,378xde,Sgnardellis,0,Tue May 26 12:14:29 2015 UTC,i'd first try it with the onions and if you dont like the flavor then go without. raw onions taste significantly different than roasted onions
cookingvideos,378xde,ss0889,1 point,Tue May 26 00:46:25 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by this video, you don't have time to cook, yet you spend what I assume to be a total of 50 minutes making a damn sandwich.  Don't use a serrated knife to cut onions and squash, most knife injuries don't come from sharp knives but dull ones, serrated knives are in the category of dull. The only time you used that knife correctly was when you cut the sandwich.  Make sure your cutting board doesn't wobble like that, place a towel under it to stabilize it. You WILL end up cutting your damn finger off. I should know I have been cooking over 20 years and have cut myself enough to know better.  I don't get why you say it's ""Real meals for real people with real jobs and a real life"". So basically every other recipe on the planet. Ingredients are not hard to get. You used fairly high quality ingredients for the sandwich. Make that shit with wonder-bread and discount fake ham with processed cheese then get back to me on the ingredient discussion.  If your mother taught you how to cook, you obviously weren't paying much attention. Real talk hun."

cookingvideos,34rxo1,jti107,3,Mon May 4 14:16:01 2015 UTC,It's basically a creamy sour cream with a lot of fat (30%) in it. You get it when you add lactobacillus to single cream. Just add 2 TS of buttermilk to 200 grams of cream. Mix it. Let it sit for 12 to 24 hours in a closed jar at room temperature and there you have it. Keeps in the refregirator for about a week.
cookingvideos,34rxo1,dobidoo,2,Mon May 4 20:00:09 2015 UTC,crème fraîche is worth looking for but in all normal circumstances you can use sour cream to achieve a very similar (but not exactly the same) effect. I use sour cream because I have it around
cookingvideos,34rxo1,gukeums1,1 point,Mon May 4 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"I searched 6 supermarkets before finding it.  Now I've found it at my local 2.  They seem to put it with the cheeses for some reason, instead of near the sour cream.  It's cool stuff but sour cream will definitely do.  The only time you need it is when using it to thicken a sauce or broth.  Sour cream tends to clump up, while crème fraîche seems to not coagulate."

cookingvideos,34fetz,taokiller,3,Thu Apr 30 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"Always start with oil, then end with butter when cooking a steak. The garlic and rosemary was a nice touch at the end too.  I'm interested to see if the constant agitation from the flipping would affect the steak's juiciness, because most methods require only a couple flips of the steak.   Also, in terms of plating I would probably serve this by cutting into 5 or 6 long strips, due to the jet black color on the outside from the coffee rub. Whoever is eating it would immediately assume it is burned to a crisp otherwise."
cookingvideos,34fetz,OhGad,4,Thu Apr 30 23:44:21 2015 UTC,There's more and more stuff every day about the benefits of constant flipping. Apparently it allows for a more evenly cooked steak.
cookingvideos,34fetz,TheLilyHammer,2,Thu Apr 30 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"I've been flipping constantly since I first tried is after watching Heston Blumenthal's Search for Perfection show, where he explained in quite some detail what he tried and why he flips so regularly (ever 15seconds). Can't find the video of it quite now, but here is a textual version of a different gig he did that says all the same things. With his near scientific approach to cooking, I trusted him well enough to try it and my steaks come out very juicy and full of flavour."
cookingvideos,34fetz,EvilPlatypus,2,Fri May 1 16:06:24 2015 UTC,I cook steak the exact same way.. Add butter and all the herbs toward the end.
cookingvideos,34fetz,izzanaeem,2,Fri May 1 20:45:04 2015 UTC,"i like the method and it obviously worked very well. i'll totally try the constant flip method next time, either that or sous vide.  That being said, there are also some areas for improvement. This is a personal preference/opinion, but i'd suggest using only the bare minimum seasonings necessary. i use a LIGHT coating of salt/pepper, a sprinkle of garlic powder and italian seasoning towards the end. not really enough to taste but enough for aroma. mostly because it helps with a crust as well and the aromas create a flavor backdrop for the meat. With other meats, i use the meat as a carrier for flavor but with a rich meat like ribeye i'd rather taste the meat and have flavors that accentuate those flavors.  Butter: never at the beginning. at most, you should lightly brush the steak with butter to help hold seasonings on there and because that is how you get a nice crust. but always start with a high smoke point oil like canola, crank that skillet as high as it goes, and sear the living fuck out of the steak. if necessary, you can even lightly dust with flour.  towards the end, your steak was SWIMMING in juices. that is inevitable, but that is also basically lost flavor. use a thin coating of canola or peanut oil, fry the steak up in it, and let the melted fat of the steak itself come out and fry the steak. same thing you do with bacon, basically. then towards the end you can throw .5-1tbsp of butter underneath one side to heavily brown, and then flip and do it again for the other side.  and of course, let the steak rest.  Gordon ramsay did this thing where he sort of hits the steak with a bundle of herbs. i find that this does nothing practical for the flavor. so while you can easily flavor the oil this way, i find it most efficient to just grind up a tiny amount of the herbs and sprinkle directly on to the meat rather than wasting a whole paintbrush of herbs to get a mild and unassuming aroma about the meat.  but it does work fantastic if you stuff a cavity of a turkey or chicken with it."

Using genetic engineering it is possible to slow down the production of polygalacturonase, so the tomatoes would acquire their taste gradually, thus gaining the benifits of both worlds: while the amount of polygalacturonase is low they can be easily transported, and when it gets high they're tasty again.
