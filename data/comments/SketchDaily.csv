I tried giving him spiky hair, ears, eyes and a nose like the characters from Sonic usually have... But I don't think it turned out that great.   Anyway, concept wise... I thought a mischievous monkey type character would fit in nicely with the gameplay, and who better than the king Sun Wukong himself?"

SketchDaily,3e1rdb,Accio_Butt,4,Tue Jul 21 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"I printed on watercolor paper for today's theme - a lot of thicker papers are going to get eaten by your printer.  This is one time when you might actually want to use student-grade paper over a more expensive paper.  I would also recommend against printing anything that's very dark.  Inkjet printers tend to use water soluble ink, so it's going to muddy up your paints quite a bit.  I drop the opacity of the lines quite a bit before I print (and then clumsily attempt to add the lines back on top digitally when I'm done)."

But I don't, so I would really appreciate it if you could briefly explain your process and/or any tips to create something like this."
SketchDaily,3dtgk0,ironicallysad,16,Sun Jul 19 13:17:05 2015 UTC,"My process is fairly simple and messy. I've learned that I don't have the patience for lineart haha so I usually just jot down some messy structural lines without thinking, but in this case I used a reference so I went straight to colour blocking. I like to work on one layer, but in the beginning it could be beneficial to split your drawing into three or so layers, each layer defined by a value (light, medium, dark). I don't know all that much about landscapes, but I think that values are the most important thing to keep in mind when painting them (when painting most things, really). A nice range in values creates composition and depth, and it draws the viewer's attention where you want to draw it. The castle is up front and dark and contrasts against the lighter colours, so it stands out, while the background slowly turns lighter and generally less saturated as it nears the horizon. Turning your drawing into greyscale helps you notice flaws in value. Oh, and zoom out! Zoom out until your image is the size of your thumb. If your drawing doesn't work on a miniature scale, it generally won't look its best at a larger scale either. Look at 7ofD's painting zoomed out, it looks fantastic! I didn't follow my own advice lol and I can see now that my drawing would've looked much nicer if some of the areas weren't as dark and gloomy. And the fire things stand out too much. And it's way too dark in general. If I wasn't packing my suitcase, I'd go back and change it right away.   The only other important thing (in my opinion) is not getting caught up in the details. Work big to small! I work messy and block in colours with big brushstrokes, and only when the whole scene has had its main components blocked in do I return and add smaller details with a textured brush. And really.. just have fun! Since this is a speedpaint, just play around with colours, listen to some music, and don't think too much about how you're painting; keep putting down brushstrokes, and if they don't work, ctrl+z and try again. Or at least that's how I do it. :D"

I would have just drawn over the picture, except that my extremely extensive google search wasn't yielding any results. So, I tried to draw it, but here's a description as well:  It is a canyon in a tropical rainforest/jungle, with a river running through the bottom that is a really pretty shade of blue. There is vegetation on the sides, as well. It is in a circle shape, with a spire right in the middle, making it sort of a ring. I'm pretty sure it's somewhere in South America, but I'm not positive.

SketchDaily,3d8axa,sketchdailybot,68,Tue Jul 14 08:00:25 2015 UTC,"The counter hasn't swung around but welp, it’s my 365th sketch! I’m a really sentimental person and like milestones, so beware of long post. I’m also really happy right now so for the first time in a year I’ll disregard the themes and just gush on about how I love this sub (sorry) (but I really just prattle on about myself like an idiot so it kinda applies). Before I joined this amazing community, I would vomit out a drawing maybe once a month, if even that, and I had very little motivation to improve because I would just get tired of the things I was drawing. But now, I’ve been drawing for a year straight (ignoring the moments where I was away and had to catch up haha; I swear I still doodled something every day.. I think), and I have yet to get tired of drawing, which kinda amazes me. Even if I don’t like a theme, it turns out to be fun in the end, and I love seeing everybody’s take on it. This is such an amazing and motivating community.   So anyways.   On July 14, 2014, right before I joined this sub, I painted this thing, and I didn’t say so at the time, but I was pretty damn proud of that painting. I had spent hours on it and I was just so happy with how it had turned out. So I thought that now that a year had passed, I should return and have another go at it!   July 14, 2015. I still have a long and arduous journey of learning ahead of me, but I’m glad that I’ve been improving a bit, and (even more importantly) enjoying every step! Probably wouldn’t be this way without Sketchdaily. I also think that this took me less time to draw than the original, which is really big for me 'cause I often linger way too long on paintings, wasting time for nothing. Hope I’ll be even faster in a year’s time!   Oh and hey, I did a process gif.  Thank you all for always sharing your amazing sketches and never failing to motivate me, and also for your support, which warms my cold european heart. Oh and thanks for reading this stupid post if you bothered. I’m excited for yet another year! I love you all. <3"

SketchDaily,3d8axa,MeatyElbow,5,Tue Jul 14 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in love with your watercolouring <3  I dunno if you were deliberately trying to go for a messier or quicker or not perfect sketch, but to me, that's part of the appeal..."
SketchDaily,3d8axa,Gin_chan,2,Tue Jul 14 17:13:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  It's kind of a weird psychological thing.  Over the weekend, I worked on a larger piece (16"" x 20"") and I was having a lot of trouble loosening up.  When I work on a more expensive piece of paper (in this case, a $15.00 clayboard that I'd never used before) or the subject matter is one I want to render accurately, or any number of other weird hangups I have, I end up just choking the life out of the painting.  I've learned to just keep a couple of cheap multimedia drawing pads on my desk for when I feel this happening.  If I go into a piece knowing it's just a throw-away, low effort sketch - you know, goof around with a ballpoint pen and throw some paint at it - I have a lot easier time doing something enjoyable or interesting.  Half of the time it might turn out pretty bad (I wasn't all that happy with yesterday's Cerberus, for example).  Other times, I accidentally make something that I really like.  I guess.. I dunno.. I can achieve consistency by really focusing, but doing so lowers the ceiling of what I can make pretty considerably (in my opinion anyway)."
SketchDaily,3d8axa,MeatyElbow,3,Tue Jul 14 17:26:25 2015 UTC,"I hardly ever work with water colours (my dad and elder sister do, frequently), so I've never really thought of investing into expensive paper/supplies (basically using my dad's :P) or the potential problem of them going to waste because a drawing doesn't turn out nice...  I used to paint when I was younger, but I just used simple (thick, watercolour friendly) sketchbook pages... I just draw mainly for fun now. There was a long period of time when all I drew were caricatures and comics, and I'm finding it hard to let go of that habit... But I understand completely about the being able to be feel free and loose with a low effort quick sketch.   Anyway, good job! Seeing your sketches makes me think it's time to start the watercolour101 thing... But I have no free time! :("

SketchDaily,3d3s52,spacepigeons,5,Mon Jul 13 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, I have nowhere near enough experience drawing dogs to do it without reference lol! I got the image from google and don't know the artist, but I'll go find it, it's rude of me not to link the ref.   Edit: found it!  But now I have a question to ask of the people of the sub in general. Is it a faux pas here to not link to your ref? I use refs quite often if the theme is something I don't know, but I usually don't cite them. D:"
SketchDaily,3d3s52,chikoritu,8,Mon Jul 13 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am of the opinion that this is a place of practice and personal growth and not sales so your references are less important and we are more focused on whether or not you are sticking with it by drawing every day.    Nonetheless, I think that it is also wise to err on the side of caution and if you take a few extra moments to post your reference to avoid any misconceptions it probably won't hurt. We've had a few people called out for not sharing references before and while I think it is totally disagreeable to shame anyone that is trying to learn, I can also imagine it must feel bad to have people referencing your art without acknowledging it."

SketchDaily,3d3s52,Gin_chan,34,Mon Jul 13 08:49:24 2015 UTC,"Cerberus! - I really wanted to draw him black, like he's supposed to be... But I also really wanted to draw his fur, and I had no idea how to do it like this (instead of using simply white highlights which I didn't want to do). I drew two tails instead of one snake tail, and went with a brownish mane to keep it consistent with his grey hair. This one took me quite long. I usually don't take more than 30-45 minutes for a piece but this took just more than an hour. (Not counting breaks)    If I can ask you all a favour, if any of you have free time, take my drawing and a draw a background for it. I have no idea how to, and I'm sure your inputs will give me some good ideas and tips for it. Thanks!"
SketchDaily,3d3s52,antonfire,6,Mon Jul 13 08:06:40 2015 UTC,"I think even just messing with the levels a bit can make him look more black. I messed around with curves a bit to get this. It doesn't look better than the original, but it does look more like it's a black dog, I think. The point is, black is never just black anyway. Anything black is going to have areas of deeper black and areas of lighter black (and if you want to get into color, redder black and bluer black). And I think you can get the fur to look like fur using dark black and not-quite-so-dark black, roughly the same way you did it with black and grey.  Here's a not-too-inspired background."
SketchDaily,3d3s52,Gin_chan,3,Mon Jul 13 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, that looks better, I think. I should've just gone with the darker grey but I just wasn't too sure if it'd look good with the tones... But I see now that that would have been the better choice.   Also, thanks for the background! A cave opening fits well with the entrance to Hades, and I kind of like the amalgamation of pencil and digital right there!   Thanks a lot (:"

SketchDaily,3d3s52,antonfire,8,Mon Jul 13 12:39:43 2015 UTC,"Bed Hair  Trying to get better at drawing without a reference, though I did look at a couple of snakes and some yawns before I started drawing. Overall I'm pretty happy with it, if only because I actually put effort into it and it shows.  I spent a bunch of time on this, so any comments are extra-welcome. Especially anything about proportions/anatomy, or values, or ""depth"".  I think my faces always come out a bit distorted, for instance one eye is too high or too low. But I can't see it when I'm working on it. The only reason I even know is the ""mirror trick"". For this one I tried looking in a mirror occasionally while working on it, but I don't think it eliminated the problem, and I don't want to do that whenever I'm drawing anyway. Are there any good exercises that teach you to break out of that mode and see the distortions in your own drawing?  The snakes are a bit muddy, I think. (Even more than everything else.) Probably because my marks are so messy. I guess I should try to be neat in the first place, instead of scribbling all over and then trying to clean it up later. But I like the freedom of the scribbling.  Also, the neck/chest area seems off. I don't think I understand the anatomy there very well.  So yeah."
SketchDaily,3d3s52,Gin_chan,4,Mon Jul 13 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is, keep the drawing at least a few feet away from me, and squint. Or blur and un-blur my eyes. I usually catch the more obvious mistakes that way. It may not work for you though...  I really like your concept today, btw. And nice shading. I can see the effort you put into this."

SketchDaily,3cw7hw,rookierolls,24,Sat Jul 11 14:24:36 2015 UTC,Old drawing  I was  somewhere between 8 and 11 when I drew it. It probably took 10 minutes.   New drawing No specific reference was used. I'm quite proud of how far I've gone in around 5 years. I spent around 1 and a half hours on this one.
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,Slylies,18,Sat Jul 11 10:32:29 2015 UTC,"Gypsy table from 2013. Took multiple sittings to do it all on an 8x8 inch piece of paper.  I started this one about an hour ago on A3 and I guess it'll take another hour to work all the little details.  [EDIT] Finished. I guess if anything, I learned to work a lot neater.  [E2] I redrew something else from that batch of drawings. First drawing // Remake"
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,rookierolls,7,Sat Jul 11 08:10:27 2015 UTC,i find the one from 2013 looking better in a way... if that makes sense? new one looks too clean and doesn't have the atmosphere the old one has. both look amazing tho :)
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,antonfire,3,Sat Jul 11 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"I hear you and I feel the same to some degree. Firstly because I feel like A3 was too big for what the image really needs. Second because I actually felt inspired while doing it the first time around, whereas redoing it was kind of a task. I'm redoing another drawing, one that I feel I should have done differently and it's going well. Will update in a few."
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,rookierolls,3,Sat Jul 11 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"For most people's drawings I prefer the newer one to the older one in just about every way. But with yours, the skulls ones, I mean, somehow the older one still feels more personal to me. As I'm sure you know a whole bunch of stuff works better in the new drawing, and I think overall the new one works better. It's a neat opportunity to compare so I hope you don't mind if I make some guesses about why I'm drawn to the older one. All of this is ""to my eyes"", of course.  The composition on the older one is more cramped, and the newer one feels more open. The higher horizon in the new one emphasizes the empty space around everything. The ""camera"" is lower down in the older one, so it feels like the viewer could be standing there and looking up at the action. The arrow'd noodly arms look more limp in the older one, just because of the way they're flopped down I think. The cracks in the older one look like they're spreading, while in the new one it looks like the hole is already as big as it's going to get. The sky has a sort of light v. dark feeling on the older one, and in general the older one just has more contrast between light and dark. The skull in the older one is a weird shape but that makes it look sorrowful or something, and on the newer one it's more impersonal.  Probably some of that stuff is intentional. And there's stuff in the new one that makes it personal too. The arm reaching for the cherub makes the action seem more immediate, and so does the lightning in the background. The noodly arms and skull seem more three-dimensional, so it feels like you could reach out and touch them: they have more presence."
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,APerfectCircle0,2,Sun Jul 12 12:27:38 2015 UTC,"Great insight! I appreciate your response. I was never happy with the old skull or the way it was shaded. I feel that I went too heavy on the black. Yes, I did try to make the action feel more present, I'm glad that came across. The background especially was the main thing I wish I did differently, and I'm much more satisfied with this one.  I still have a long way to go in terms of getting perspective done correctly. One step at a time, though."
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,Drawer_Of_Drawings,2,Mon Jul 13 19:45:24 2015 UTC,I think there is a massive improvement on the crystal ball and faerie in the new one! It looks great! I love how precise your lines are in your pictures

SketchDaily,3cw7hw,antonfire,2,Sat Jul 11 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy you took my advice and drew it again!  I can already see so many things that you've done better! The hair is correct now, the shape of his face is much better. You've got the thin nose and lips much better too.   To do some things better, I think you need to shade the face. That way it will look 3 dimensional, and not flat. Don't forget to shade the White bits of the eye too. They're not always white. In this drawing, if I'm correct, the light is coming from the top right of the page... So you should darken all the areas to the left and under the nose. To show how high his nose is and also the curvature of the face. It will bring a huge difference to your drawing. Try going through some shading tutorials before you attempt it, or just try and replicate your reference photo.   Benadryl cabbageworm has a very unique face structure which is excellent for face studies in my opinion. Drawing it again and again would definitely improve you more and more. It's good that you chose a completely different reference photo this time and didn't copy your first drawing. That eliminates the possibility of repeating your errors.   You have done better. Good job!"
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,Gin_chan,2,Sun Jul 12 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is that you're abstracting what you're drawing. So when you draw an eye, you're in ""drawing an eye"" mode, and when you draw a mouth, you're in ""drawing a mouth"" mode, and so on. I can't say how much of this applies to you, but in general this can ""mislead"" in a lot of ways.  If you're always drawing symbols, you don't draw anything you don't have a symbol for. Then there's nothing linking your symbols together, which can make a drawing look like several separate parts. Also, your modes for drawing, say, a mouth and an eye might diverge. So you might use one type of stroke on a mouth and another on an eye, and this can contribute to this disjointedness.  Your habits from drawing some specific thing might also be so strong that they override what you see in front of you. For instance, if a shadow falls so you can't quite see where the mouth starts and where it ends, it's tempting to just take a guess at where it ends, rather than replicating that phenomenon on the paper.  Anyway, those are things you can control, and lots of people want to draw abstracted faces and things. Cartoons are very much that, for instance. And even if you want to learn to do realistic drawings, if you want to do it without a reference then you need to sometimes think about why things look the way they do, not just how they look.  But for drawing ""realistically"" it's also really important, even fundamental, to be able to skip the abstraction and draw what you see, not what you think you see. I think abstraction is getting in the way of what you want to do.  There's lots of exercises that can help with this. /u/Gin_chan suggested gesture drawings, which are great because they train you to quickly identify shapes. My favorite is drawing something from an upside-down reference. We don't automatically parse an image into its components when it's upside down, so you don't have to work as hard to get past the abstraction impulse. If you want to draw yet another Benedict, you can try it with him and see how it compares to the other ones. A reference with harsher lighting can help because shadows link up the shapes so you don't have big areas of nothing."
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,antonfire,2,Sun Jul 12 11:38:26 2015 UTC,"To add to this, there is this article too, which is great, in my opinion.   However, I do find that while this technique is great for beginners to achieve good results quickly, it is still essentially a cheat. Just like tracing or grids and techniques of that sort. These sort of techniques don't help you become a good artist... It's best to practice copying first so you learn to measure with your eyes.   It's not like they are bad techniques, I use these often too. But I try not to.   Anyway, great bit of advice from /u/antonfire, by the way. Good luck, OP!"
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,Gin_chan,2,Sun Jul 12 12:26:26 2015 UTC,"Yes! I spent a bunch of time looking for that specific article but couldn't track it down.  And yeah, I've never really tried drawing something upside-down as a shortcut to get a good drawing, and I don't think that would be a good habit, because you don't want to rely on it. For one thing, you can only really do it from photo reference, which is pretty limiting.  It's always been just an exercise to me, like blind contours or gestures. I think, unlike tracing or grids, it's a worthwhile exercise that does help you become a better artist. It's training wheels. You practice with an artificially reduced impulse to parse everything into symbols, and this carries over and makes it easier to look past that impulse in ""real life"". To me that's a very fundamental skill (which is not to say that I am good at it), and developing it is part of the reason I do art in the first place.  I don't think there's very much that carries over from tracing or grids, which is why you don't see people encouraging them all that often."
SketchDaily,3cw7hw,calypsomatic,2,Sun Jul 12 12:48:46 2015 UTC,"True, it's very much like training wheels, and it translates as a fundamental technique. But it could also very well not translate into a skill. If one were to simply keep drawing upside down without paying much attention into the learning aspect of the 'training wheels', one would not be able to replicate the same drawing ability when not following that technique.   That's just my opinion though, if it makes any sense."

SketchDaily,3cryiq,Fournette,2,Fri Jul 10 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"You're off to a pretty great start, judging by the hat. You added a bit of highlighting to just a few spots, but it really seems to add depth. Especially the button on top. The fact that the rightmost hole is super-dark and the rest are bright works really well, I think. Particularly on the middle hole. From what I've learned so far, that 3D feeling usually comes from getting the dark vs. light values right, as you're probably figuring out.  I think it could pop better by making some of the darks darker, specifically: under the peak, where the peak meets the hat on the right, and under the hat on the left. You also have a little line of white between the shadow and the hat there, which doesn't seem to belong. There's something off about where the hat meets the white background, on the left and on top, it doesn't seem to stand out. Maybe the boundary is a bit too fuzzy, because the sharper boundary on the right seems to work quite well.  I like the seams. You have an eye for detail."
SketchDaily,3cryiq,antonfire,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:17:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply!  I did notice (just now) that the light and angle I took a picture of the drawing caused some of the darker marks to turn white from the reflection! I will have to take a look when I get home to see where the white is really supposed to be dark.  I think I will try to sharpen the boundary on the left hand side as well.

SketchDaily,3cryiq,mekranil,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"Hi fellow newbie! I don't talk from very much experience when I give you my advice, but here goes!  First off, I like your piece! Especially your silhouette of the child, very clean. What throws me off are the balloons, even though they're a fun detail. However they are shaded while the child is not which makes him/her seem oddly flat. This is not an issue in itself because silhouettes are flat, but then the balloons should be flat too as they are in the same plane.  Secondly, when shading it is obviously important to think of where the light comes from. In your case you could go by the planet, which seemingly is hit by a light from above/behind, this is also the light that creates the silhouette. The light hitting the balloons however is coming from the right side, which does not make sense with the rest. Then again, in this case I wouldn't shade the balloons at all, or possibly with a darker colour.   I'm not an expert though, so if someone else sees a mistake in my advice, please correct me. :)"

This is the blurred spray airbrush for the base colors + spray airbrush for the stars and darker bleed india ink brush for the trees.  Spent around half an hour just trying out every single brush, but the actual process for this was pretty simple once I knew what everything did. If I have time later I can make a tutorial, but I don't know how useful the tutorial would be for someone who doesn't have the same tools."

SketchDaily,3cej0j,sharktopuskracken,2,Wed Jul 8 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"Ah okay... Thanks for clearing it up. I did pretty much the same thing, used sprays and a little watercolour for the sky, but it didn't come out nearly as good as you. Also, drawing stars was such a pain!"
SketchDaily,3cej0j,Gin_chan,6,Tue Jul 7 09:20:22 2015 UTC,"If you use photoshop (can probably do this in other programs?), the way I learned to do stars about... nine years ago:   Filter->Noise->Add Noise->Gaussian + Monochromatic Invert (May be unnecessary, but obviously do this if you started White/Black instead of Black/White) Use transform/scaling to make the layer about double the size Use Brightness/Contrast adjustment to bring out the white and hide the excess (Favoring high levels of contrast) Use Levels adjustment to further darken the sky, but also bring out the brightness of the stars Use the Clone Stamp tool with a hard-edged brush set to normal, and paint out your stars. Set it to screen if you want to make large clusters, like in 7oD's band across the sky.   This will handle the stars, for the most part. Clouds are just layering various textured brushes of dark to light colors at low levels (5-10% opacity). Or... just downloading brushes with the right settings. You can also make another layer of larger stars using the same process, but scaling it up a bit more (hm... or maybe you never scale the first layer to begin with?), and then set it to screen. For either this layer of larger stars, or both layers depending on preference, you can duplicate the layer, give it a Filter->Blur->Gaussian Blur of about 1-3, and then go to Edit->Fade Gaussian Blur, and select Lighten. This will add a soft glow, which is why I'd favor it for the larger stars.  ... um. Yeah @_@ I feel like I'm forgetting a step... but maybe this helps? Or you knew it already, or you don't use photoshop.... ;;"
SketchDaily,3cej0j,Sincerely-a-bookworm,2,Tue Jul 7 17:33:04 2015 UTC,Amazing background!  I've used Manga Studio before to do some manga-style comics but that was a long time ago. I remember it felt a bit like SAI in that it was great for lineart. I've never tried colouring with it though. :0  Is it easy to paint with?
SketchDaily,3cej0j,aliceofoz,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I haven't used it much. I'm still using openCanvas for most of my stuff just because I know all my own shortcuts and I work fastest in it. I do like the brushes that manga studio has, though.  I think the big thing for me is that I've learned how to use the oC default brush a bunch of different ways, and I'm still looking or for an equally versatile default brush in Manga Studio.  In any case, thank you!"
SketchDaily,3cej0j,7ofDiamonds,2,Tue Jul 7 21:28:35 2015 UTC,"That looks awesome! I always end up resorting to photos for detailed starscapes like that, but seeing this I know I gotta try it your way next time :D"

SketchDaily,3cej0j,SpookyMaidment,6,Tue Jul 7 08:04:41 2015 UTC,"There are different versions. You may be more familiar with the one where the godess's kimono gets lost and the cowherd finds it, but lies and offers to help her look for it. Then they fall in love and get married. She later finds out about the lie and tells him to weave a thousand bamboo sandals, which he fails at (in some versions he is short by just one because of his haste, and in others, he dies before completing the task). The goddess wants to forgive him nonetheless but her father wants to punish him so he gives him a task to sit in a lemon garden for days without food, water, and not allowed to eat the lemons. But he grows thirsty/hungry and touches one. In that instant it becomes a milky river (Milky Way Galaxy) and they're separated together. Then the father becomes compassionate and allows them to meet for a single day every year on the seventh day of the seventh month.   ...or something like that?  Great drawing though."

SketchDaily,3cej0j,Imaginingowls,2,Tue Jul 7 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"I like how the decorations look, and I really like how the tree looks. I think if the tree had as much contrast as the decorations, it would make them come together better. Right now the decorations stand out a lot and the tree seems like it's a backdrop.  There are also a few places where the pencil keep away from the paint and you get a white halo around between the decoration and the tree, which probably contributes to that. For example, you didn't leave a gap where the topmost purple one goes behind the tree, and I think it works better than the topmost blue one, which has a gap. I constantly have to remind myself not to shy away from boundaries."

SketchDaily,3cej0j,powerspank,3,Tue Jul 7 20:20:18 2015 UTC,Are you using watercolor paper?
SketchDaily,3cej0j,WateryStar,2,Wed Jul 8 07:11:29 2015 UTC,"Don't despair - I can tell that you're doing some things right already.  I think your paper is probably working against you.  You've either got drawing paper or some kind of multimedia paper.  You're going to be much happier with your results if you get watercolor paper.  Some people subscribe to the watercolor theory that you should never, under any circumstances, use black.  I personally have never had much luck with it.  If I want real, honest-to-goodness black, I come back with ink after the rest of the painting is complete.  The reason the black bled into everything else here is because the layer under it wasn't dry.  Sometimes this effect is desirable (it's one of the interesting aspects of the medium, but takes a little while to figure out).  If you want sharp, crisp lines you're going to have to wait for the paint below it to dry.  A hairdryer can expedite this process if you're impatient.    The most important part is to keep trying.  The only way I was able to figure out anything about watercolors was by making mistakes, being dissatisfied, and seeking solutions to those problems."
SketchDaily,3cej0j,MeatyElbow,3,Wed Jul 8 13:31:52 2015 UTC,Little paper crane.  Was seeing if I still liked drawing lineart.  I don't.
SketchDaily,3cej0j,LoveThyHaters,3,Tue Jul 7 18:31:48 2015 UTC,wow how do you line art???????????????????????????????????? like seriously please teach me?   also i've seen some of your other stuff e.g. the car you did in car week and holy cow you are crazy good so if you could just generally teach me how to draw everything would be much appreciated!!
SketchDaily,3cej0j,wittenwitten,3,Tue Jul 7 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your kind words! I'm flattered. :)  As for lineart, ctrl+z is literally your best friend. Be prepared to use it. Lots. Don't draw slowly, quick strokes are super important for linework - if you make the line too long by drawing too quickly, you can just erase it until it's where you want it to be. In fact, that's what you want to do. The faster your stroke is, the smoother the line.  I use pretty much only a single brush, and in Paint Tool SAI, this is what it looks like. I change the density/opacity depending on whether I want a soft build-up or a hard brush, for details and stuff.  Teaching you how to draw everything would take a long time :p. Make sure you're looking at your reference image more than your drawing. That's all I can tell you off the top of my head. Your drawing today is awesome! Really nice job. :)"
SketchDaily,3cej0j,LoveThyHaters,3,Tue Jul 7 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"ahh yes me and ctrl + z are well acquainted, i think i mainly need to work on hand eye coordination when working digitally, i always end up making curves wacky or straight lines going the wrong way so i will definitely be using your advice thanks!   also i've never tried out that brush so ill have to give that ago as well!"

SketchDaily,3c32oa,VirtualSoldier,18,Sat Jul 4 10:50:23 2015 UTC,"Can you guess who it is?  I tried drawing with only red and blue. I did. But it wasn't turning out great. So I used a yellow too. I thought red, blue and yellow - the three primary colors will be limited enough. Then I used a little - okay a lot of - black. For outlining and shading. All darkened colors are results of repeated overlaying.   This was a very hard challenge nevertheless. Especially because I chose a drawing like this. It's tough in itself to make a drawing resemble somebody, even tougher doing it with three colors!  I think it went alright, I still haven't quite got how to make layers behave like I want them to...  It's Benedict Cucumberpatch.    EDIT: * TRIED ANOTHER!"

SketchDaily,3bunao,sketchdailybot,72,Thu Jul 2 08:00:24 2015 UTC,Five pages of creatures  I started just with one but the dungeon felt so empty I had to make more. They all needed to atleast have some logic to them and that's why I thought about how they should work before drawing them. There is a small explanation for each in the album.  I'm trying to improve so
SketchDaily,3bunao,headcrab1991,5,Thu Jul 2 08:02:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is hard work you put into it! Great shading too. My favorite was the Damokles. DidISpellThatRight?"
SketchDaily,3bunao,Gin_chan,2,Thu Jul 2 08:08:12 2015 UTC,"Yes you did! It's probably the most original, the rest are more or less close to the typical monster and video game tropes... it's hard to come up with new stuff :/  Thanks you |:D"
SketchDaily,3bunao,headcrab1991,3,Thu Jul 2 08:14:02 2015 UTC,It is hard coming up with new stuff. How long did all 5 pages take you?

SketchDaily,3bunao,headcrab1991,3,Thu Jul 2 08:24:28 2015 UTC,Wow good job mate!
SketchDaily,3bunao,Gin_chan,5,Thu Jul 2 08:28:48 2015 UTC,"Design before committing. I see you already do this by the small doodle on the corners, but you barely change it for the final drawing. Don't be afraid to change proportions, add or take parts away, or just go in a completely different direction.  Damokles is easily one of the most original creatures I've seen in a long time. Try doing at least a full page of variations of him! Pros easily do 3-4 times as much."
SketchDaily,3bunao,Martabo,3,Thu Jul 2 09:41:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the reply! This is the first time I did these small pre-doodles and thought more about the design before starting but you are very right there is a lot more I could do in that regard.  Thank you! At first it was more of a generic mutant with several limbs and spikes but that felt too overused and I started to think about what could make this particular creature stand out and how it would function in the caves. Thanks for the advice, it's good to have a guideline and hear about how the pros do it!"

SketchDaily,3bunao,Lamb_Of_Columbia,8,Thu Jul 2 12:28:50 2015 UTC,"A Wispmother from Skyrim.    Does anyone have any tips or tutorials on shading and highlighting? I'm honestly clueless on the technique, and I kind of just take a shot in the dark when I'm doing it. Also, coloring.  -Thanks in advance."
SketchDaily,3bunao,chikoritu,4,Thu Jul 2 10:19:53 2015 UTC,"I'm no pro so take my advice with a grain of salt, but there are several things to consider when colouring. (sorry in advance for the rambling)  First of all, opacity. For each part of the drawing, you use one base colour, one shading colour, and one highlight colour. Why not use more, why not blend them to create a whole gradient of colours? Lower the opacity of your brush and blend out your colours to make the shading more natural and subtle. Then later, you can add hints of different colours and shades to make your drawing more interesting.  Then I'd recommend colouring things in chunks. Look at the cloth, for example. You added small shadows for each small fold, but you could just use broader brushstrokes and apply large shadows to give the idea of folds creating shadows without getting caught up in little details. Also keep in mind how the cloth as a whole would change in shade in different places. As it wraps behind the creature, it would have darker shadows, and when it comes closer to the front (where we'll assume the light is coming from), the whole of that portion would be much lighter.  Which leads to values. You want your range of colours to be wide (from very light to very dark) to create depth. Now this varies from person to person because some styles use less contrast than others, but you should always keep depth in mind. Here is a rough and partial paintover (sorry, would do more detailed but didn't have much time), an idea of what I'd do with your lineart. If that's not your style, no need to do it as drastic, but I like to use really dark colours like in the hood (where light wouldn't reach) to add depth and make it more three dimensional. When you get your values down, you don't even need lineart. Look at the boobs, for example: the lines have been painted over but since the shadows are strong, you get the idea of what's there. Eventually you get so used to using strong values that you don't even need lines for more complex things, like the face. But then again, that is just what I like to do, paint over lineart. In my opinion, you've got great linework and you definitely don't have to paint over it if you don't want to. But what is pretty important is using values to create depth.    Then there's the question of how you know where to actually place the shadows and highlights. The answer is that you just know, it's intuition. You imagine the object as three dimensional and then imagine how light would hit it. I certainly don't have this whole thing down yet haha so I can't say much, but to practice and develop that intuition you study photographs and paintings by professional artists. Or even better, paint things from life, stuff you see.   I dunno, at the end of the day I'm still just learning myself, but I hope I could help a bit."
SketchDaily,3bunao,Lamb_Of_Columbia,2,Thu Jul 2 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"I've got to say, your paint over really made a difference. I really don't want to get trapped in a rut, and get stuck with the level of skill I currently have at the moment.  Thanks again for the advice, and thanks for being so thorough."

I didn’t know what to draw, so I went with two of my own characters. These are Karen and Eileen, from my NaNoWriMo 2012 novel, An Empty Place.  Of all my characters, they are the first ones to start a romantic relationship (if I count only the characters from stories I actually finished writing, at least) – though said relationship exists only outside the story, since I avoid writing romantic relationships as much as I possibly can. Mostly because I'm terrible at it."

SketchDaily,3bhm2h,kelsifer,7,Mon Jun 29 09:15:53 2015 UTC,"You did great work with the splashing water! As for the face... I think you're drawing with your brain and not your eyes. Or you'd see how it's slightly off, proportionally. The heard could e been slightly larger, the arm could be slightly lower or it would overlap the face slightly more. Get what I'm trying to say?  You may have gone a little lazy with her right arm there, but it doesn't matter.   Drawing faces is tough. Especially if you're trying to draw a particular face. I'd just tell you to practice faces over and over till you can draw one one on your own without referring to another, and be happy with the result."

I like the squid quite a bit, you've got a nice shadow under the ridge of its eye and along one side of its body. I can see you did the same under the girl's hair. I think that kind of simple shading would be fine but just needs to be consistent. All of the parts of the gun could use a simple shadow on the underside or dark side of each piece.   The background is also a little distracting. I think something simpler might help keep the focus on the illustration."

It's pretty weird how the scholarships system works... In some countries, a relatively lower SAT score would give a much higher scholarship than a higher score in other countries...   I gave the SATs three years ago and got a 2010 in my first attempt, but in my country, people get 2400/2400 easy, so the competition doesn't allow good scholarships for lower scores. :/  I'd have tried again, but I got an excellent college in my own country, so that's good haha  Sorry for the rant! :P"

I'm guessing the majority of our scholarships are for higher scores, or for people in bad shape economically who score higher than expected for their group, like minorities. For my scholarship, they've been lessening the money awarded, but raising the requirements so less people get it.   overall, the I think the SAT favors richer students in better neighborhoods, and  I don't think it actually is any indicator of intelligence or the value of each student, but what can you do. :/"

SketchDaily,3b1uli,Thrackerz0d,2,Thu Jun 25 15:38:31 2015 UTC,"Wow this is great! Thank you for submitting it, I hope you'll continue to participate!  For technique, I'd say the trunk looks lovingly rendered but the fronds/leaves look less so. I think with many plants you can take some of the same tips you hear about when drawing hair, rather than draw the individual strands/leaves/branchers, you can draw large bulky shapes and add detail here or there to give the impression of leaves/branches.  Here is a rough example . Palm trees are tough because they are so wispy  As for the subject matter itself, there are a ton of different kind of palm trees, but one thing they have in common is that as they grow and shed leaves they leave a ring pattern on their trunk, it can be smooth or rough but there is always some kind of repeating pattern up the length.  Your trunk looks more deciduous, maybe more like a ficus"

Not sure about the x-eyes in 11, I thought they were cool but proably not my invention, I must have seen them in some anime. Are they a staple in anime or where could I have seen them? 13 is probably the closest to my personal version of manga."

SketchDaily,3aounp,rookierolls,3,Mon Jun 22 12:36:14 2015 UTC,"I never got around to watching the original because everyone so far has told me that Brotherhood is superior. I was told that the reason is because the manga wasn't finished when the original started airing, so when they caught up, they ran out of source material and had to come up with their own."
SketchDaily,3aounp,sysconfig,2,Mon Jun 22 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"oh wow I didn't know that. I got into when they were airing episodes on Adult Swim years ago. I caught one of the earlier episodes and was like ok this is pretty interesting. then i found the whole series online and binge watched it.  When brotherhood came out i was like WTF are they doing another one, till i heard it was supposed to follow the manga more closely. I  agree it was a waaaaaaaaaaaay better story and ending."

I'd love some input from you guys. What can I do to make it better?

SketchDaily,39k4xq,Gin_chan,5,Fri Jun 12 09:55:39 2015 UTC,"Wait, that's digital? Damn! I guess cause of the paper texture, but I thought it WAS pen and paper, haha. It looks amazing. I don't have an critique, but definitely keep doing digital drawings! I like it a lot.  Actually, I just thought of a critique :P The hair on the right side doesn't have as much 'flow' to it, like on the left side you gave each bit of hair some direction. The other side has less direction, more like just straight lines to fill in the blank. I think it'd definitely help to spend a bit more effort in giving those fill-in strokes the right direction, it'd make it look more flowy. Right now my eyes are drawn to the overlapping lines right next to/below the ear.  Anyways, it looks awesome! You got the angle of the face perfectly, that's something I'm still working on being able to do haha."
SketchDaily,39k4xq,lovetothelightning,2,Fri Jun 12 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :D  Thanks for your critique also. That is definitely one area I was unsure about. The problem I had was this: the reference photo is drawn in ink with a brush, and the directions aren't clear. I started with those two loops on the right, but not thinking beforehand, I started them from the neck instead of further through the hair. When I started drawing the rest of the hair, the directions turned out to be opposite, and I ended up with a criss cross! :(  I guess next time, I should plan it all much earlier and then start filling in.   Thanks again for your input, I really appreciate it! (:  And good luck to you!"
SketchDaily,39k4xq,Gin_chan,3,Fri Jun 12 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I can't offer you much in the way of help regarding digital work.  I think you did a remarkable job of rendering this, though.  The facial proportions are a little different from the reference (I think your face is maybe a little ""longer"" or just angled differently), but not by a significant amount and I don't think it hurts the piece at all.  The reference has some interesting brushwork going on (particularly in the hair - I think they're called ""flying whites"").  I'm guessing it was done with a traditional brush and ink - which I couldn't begin to tell you how to duplicate using digital.  Regardless - nice work.  I've enjoyed seeing your work around here recently."
SketchDaily,39k4xq,MeatyElbow,3,Fri Jun 12 14:54:01 2015 UTC,"I drew it on my iPad with my phone (with the reference photo) in the other hand, trying to duplicate it as well as I could, so proportion wise, I know it may be a little off... But that's the closest I can get I guess haha!  The reference is indeed drawn with a traditional Japanese brush and sumi-e ink. Takehiko inoue is one of the most famous and most talented mangaka in Japan. Notable works include Slam Dunk, Real, and Vagabond.   I drew it with a thin pen type tool instead of a brush because I was pretty sure I couldn't replicate it with a brush with my current level of expertise with digital painting, and also because the brush tool was pretty crappy in that app...  Thanks for your kind words! I've been here only for less than a week, and with what I've seen so far, I've also enjoyed seeing your work around here :D"

SketchDaily,38vyzt,antonfire,3,Sun Jun 7 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"Welcome (back) to /r/SketchDaily!  I like the shading on the tank part of the minigun, it does a good job of making it look 3-dimensional. Same with how the colors transition from red to blue-ish on the torso. It might be an artifact of the digitization, but there's quite a bit more contrast on the minigun tank and the ammo chute than elsewhere in the picture. I think other parts would also benefit from that contrast. One easy little change would be to make the shadow in his/her mask as dark as anything else in the picture.  (By the way if you want to reduce the dark halo around the boundary, you can take the picture from further away and then zoom in/crop. But a scanner works best, of course.)  The backpack looks off center, like it's attached to the back of the arm; and even then you should probably be able to see a bit of it between the arm and torso.  Dunno if it's on purpose, but the symbol on the minigun kinda looks like a dick."

SketchDaily,38rxn6,morganmarz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"There are a thousand tips that people can give you, but i'll try at giving you a few here.   Your brain is excellent at recognizing patterns. That's a problem here though, because it wants to simplify things into shapes. Break that habit into itty bitty pieces. You can try flipping the image upside down and drawing it upside down to get used to this. Sometimes it's a matter of training your hand and eye to work together. In that line, you might try tracing things to get used to the movements. Quick gesture drawings are excellent training. Forces you to see the major features of things and make something recognizable out of as few strokes as possible. Really, just practice a lot. A whole lot.

SketchDaily,38n4id,Sincerely-a-bookworm,4,Fri Jun 5 08:15:05 2015 UTC,"Aw, those are so cute.   I used to frequently watch the Daily Mafia channel on Twitch.tv. I've never played it, but it's such a fascinating game. How well has it translated to a written format?"
SketchDaily,38n4id,7ofDiamonds,4,Fri Jun 5 09:00:19 2015 UTC,"There are a few formats. There's the in-person format (or I guess over webcam) where everyone can see each other, and that's a game about reading body language. There's the chatroom format like EpicMafia where it's more a game of quick thinking and trying to cause confusion. The forum version has 24-hour day/night phases, so the general idea is to analyze every situation from every possible angle. So, same general rule sets, but vastly differing playstyles."
SketchDaily,38n4id,Sincerely-a-bookworm,3,Fri Jun 5 09:04:36 2015 UTC,"Hm, 24-hour cycles in real-time based off of a timezone, or 24-hours of day, followed by 24-hours of night, and so on and so forth? I'm guessing the latter, else you might run into a situation where someone can't perform their role or fully participate if the real-time cycle conflicted with their schedule.  I take it that each day (and, now that I think about it, each formal?) has its own thread and people post to it? How many posts--or, rather, how involved do the threads get? I used to do play-by-post roleplaying for many years, which, while a different beast altogether, feels reminiscent. At least if it works like how I'm thinking it does. Hm... and you could use polls for voting purposes. Seems like the formals could extend the game's duration a fair bit--which would explain the ""multiple weeks"" comment.  Also, is it just a vanilla sort of Mafia game, or do the games incorporate the themes you posted up above? Or are they just your own little fun (and super cute ~) addition?  .... eep, so many questions thrown about in no particular order. Sorry x-x"
SketchDaily,38n4id,7ofDiamonds,3,Fri Jun 5 09:30:09 2015 UTC,"24 hours of day followed by 24 hours of night.  Nah, people use the same thread. It's pretty similar to play-by-post roleplaying, minus the turn order (or well, if you established turn order in your roleplays). Shorter games are usually around 1-20 pages, but we once played a game with like 30-40 really active players that went up to 100 pages (though most of it was people being silly).  Since a lot of the game is analyzing who people vote for and how/why they vote (i.e. are they confident, do they provide reasoning, do they just throw out a panicked random vote when under pressure?) votes are made publicly in thread during the day phase, and people are often allowed to change their vote multiple times.  For the themed games, we tend to do role madness games where everyone has a different ability which range from simple things like ""detective"" to really weird things like ""You have a 90% change of stunning your target and a 10% chance of killing them, and if the day phase falls on a Tuesday your vote counts for double.""  If you're interested, I could link you the forum via PM. We only have one complete game on there right now (most of us used to be in a club on a separate forum that died like three years ago which is where most of those past games were played) but seeing a full game thread might answer other questions you have."

It's tough working so much larger than usual (this thing is 24 x 36 -- most of my work is half that size, often even smaller).   Quick plein air study I did the other day. I was happier with it 10 minutes in than I was when I finally stopped -- I have got to get better at the difficult art of stopping when it's done enough. (And I have to remember not to chase the light, because therein lies madness and muddy colors.)  I was hoping to have this watercolor thing done today, but...at least I've started it! I had forgotten how long it takes to do watercolors...all that waiting for paint to dry. Man. If I actually do want to get back into watercolors, I'll have to figure out a system where I work on a pastel painting while watercolors dry. Then again, that might require some weird mental adjustments; with pastels I have to work dark to light, with watercolors I have to work light to dark."

SketchDaily,38hpwy,antonfire,5,Thu Jun 4 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"I think the scribbly lines work well, especially in the hair. But, as you probably know, they can be a way to hide flaws and insecuritys. The hand is the worst offender in that regard, in this piece. It doesn't have to be as spelled out as the face, to not draw attention away but you could still try to get the general form right. Right now it is more of a blurry block.   Other things. The right eye is a bit askew and the mouth dropped a little bit. Like you cut out the whole mouth in Photoshop and had dropped it just slightly too low.  But it's good work, I like it."
SketchDaily,38hpwy,headcrab1991,2,Fri Jun 5 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I think I made the hand and chest similar values without being aware of why I was doing it: so I wouldn't have to figure out the shape of the hand so much. I worked it into shape for a bit before getting sick of it again: Korra v2. Still a similar story, I think, but not as bad.  I should probably just practice drawing hands way more."

Look, art can be frustrating as hell- especially when you want to be at a skill level that you think you're not, but ""good"" art doesn't come without that frustration and working through it.  I absolutely urge you to look at this. This guy decided he wanted to be good at drawing and so he drew every day. His first sketches are very basic, not the best technical drawings but you can see him practicing the fundamentals. Then, when you look at the last page it's frickin' Old Masters level paintings. I think it took him 3 years.  You can be a great artist. You can be the best artist. You just have to not give up, okay?  I believe in you!"

SketchDaily,38hpwy,AshleyTheDragon,2,Fri Jun 5 06:29:53 2015 UTC,"I like where this is going, lots of nice details! Maybe her arm is sloped a bit too much from the shoulder - it's good to do figure drawing guidelines in the background to check anatomy early.  In other drawings I notice you're maybe finding it difficult to maintain a hard-edge while coloring digitally. You'll probably find that easier with having line-art, since you can select areas you want to keep separate using the magic wand, then paint bucket and clipping layers. But even when doing things painterly it's still useful to clip to an area so you don't have to worry about going over lines when painting, and it also lets you use big brush sizes.  u/powersimon has some good workflow gifs to look at that probably cover what I was saying :X ex1 ex2 ex3"

SketchDaily,38hpwy,AshleyTheDragon,2,Fri Jun 5 21:16:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't sure how much you'd done before, most people find it tough to use shortcuts and tools to start off. There are probably tutorials on youtube to cover everything, but I guess the main things to get used to are:   The magic wand (key W) lets you select similar areas within line-art (there is a switch for it to apply to just 1 layer or the whole picture). The lasso (L) manually selects, you can combine these with Shift to add to the existing selection or Alt to subtract. Clipping layers are ones where if you paint outside it's parent layer, the data is still there, but it won't show up. I tried to show how that works for me You can make lots and lots of layers so long as you are able to keep track of them all :P using folders or however you like"

SketchDaily,38c9nr,poledra,2,Wed Jun 3 14:12:31 2015 UTC,"i like the energy in your lines, it's great for a quick sketch.  try squinting at your ref photo, then squinting at your image.  in the ref, the darkest values are on the right side of her face just beneath the hat.  in your drawing, to me your darkest values read as around her neck area.  the expression is a bit off, which changes the meaning of the image i think.  yours looks more questioning, where as the ref looks a bit disgruntled.  and one last thing i'll mention as i battle with this for every portrait, is that your neck seems to retreat in on itself, whereas the ref's projects outward, and again this helps to totally change the expression between the two images.  i try to remember to mark the neck movement at the beginning of my drawing and build around it, as it is very hard to try to make the neck look fluid later."

SketchDaily,38c9nr,AshleyTheDragon,6,Thu Jun 4 03:07:13 2015 UTC,I tried water color on canvas tonight - it's a quick study of Esther and her maidens from mybfavorite painting in the met's collection by Artemesia Gentileschi - the shadows on just these three heads are impossible!  I screwed up the main figure's head tilt and so the shadows make it look really goofy. I could do a whole series of studies on just the figure on the lower left of the canvas.  The shadows and skin tones are so perfect in the original that I doubt I could ever get it right.

SketchDaily,38c9nr,headcrab1991,2,Thu Jun 4 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"I won't say anything on how to improve this but give you some general advice. If I understood you correctly you are overwhelmed with trying to reproduce this. Am I right?  Break the problem into smaller problems. What you tried to copy there is very complex. You have the figure, the anatomy and pose. You have the cloth and it's folds. And you have the light, going on and trough the cloth.  Focus on one or two of these for now. Maybe draw some fabric. Hang it on a nail, take one strong lightsource, study and draw it from life. That way you learn about light and the way fabric behaves.  Or do some figure studies. Learn about the human body. If you have one available, go to a nude sketching class. Otherwise use one of the many only resources for practicing nude sketches.  Working on these specific problems will help you more than tackling such a big task where you try to learn many things at once.  I hope I didn't just repeat stuff you already know."

Thing could be shinier with some brighter brights and especially adding some white. I think adding some darker darks and some brighter brights to it can make a big difference. I can't give specific advice as to placement (I was going to suggest a gradient sort of effect) because I don't know what that piece of equipment is and so I don't know how it actually catches light.  Hope this has helped regardless. :)"

Its funny, I actually had a really hard time seeing the ""shiny-ness"" of the wrench although that might be because I had just painted it. So darker darks and lighter lights. I'll keep that in mind.

SketchDaily,386xum,JKPolk_Zombie_Slayer,3,Wed Jun 3 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"Knight  Always want to draw knights, but get frustrated with the complexity/coming up with interesting armor. Need to do more.    (Pretty tempted by the alt theme though. :D)"
SketchDaily,386xum,swjm,5,Wed Jun 3 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"I noticed you marked critique welcome, so I'm going to try to give some critique.  First, on coming up with armor: Do you use reference images? I find it helpful to pick a 'feel' for something, like I'll say for example I'm drawing someone whose armor is going to be primarily leather or primarily chainmail. Then I'll do a google for countries that use similar armor types. I'll also look at video game concept art or the in-game art for games in the same genre (knights/medieval) or in the same style.  That said, I do really like your armor design! The only thing I don't like about it, and it's just a small nit-pick, is the thing on the knight's left shoulder. Realistically, I know it's probably a metal spikey thing for defense, but it doesn't -feel- hard to me and I much prefer the other shoulder. Could be personal preference on my part.  Another thing I really love is both the helmet and the piece of cloth on the chest. Both have a good weight to them and I feel like they visually come across really well for what they are. Especially the way the fabric sits on the chest.  Anatomy-wise, it looks pretty good. I'm no expert in anatomy but the head looks about the right size for the body and the arms seem to be a good length. I'd just watch the hand positioning a bit- the left hand looks like it's grabbing the sword in an awkward way and the right hand looks a bit small and flat. Hands are the bane of every artist, I think, though, and it's not like they super take away from the drawing- just something to keep in mind to spend a little extra time on in the future.  One thing I do want to mention is I think this is a super regal pose for a knight- a nice, proper portrait- but the position he's holding the sword in is...uh. It's right near his, uhm, lower region and that can look a bit...off. I hope you see what I'm trying to say here, heh. Alternate position could be holding the sword over his shoulder or being in a position to strike. I wouldn't go re-working your current drawing for a new pose, just something to keep in mind for the future.  That's about all I got. I do like the drawing, and I hope you keep drawing knights and whatever else you like. Try not to get too stressed or frustrated with it. Let yourself enjoy the process. Hope this has helped in some way. :)"
SketchDaily,386xum,cotyart,2,Wed Jun 3 04:58:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton for all your kind words! I always use references (which in this case ended up giving that ahem pose (sorry :P)), I just have trouble finding that right thing. You know? Video game art's too much, and real life armor's too basic. That kinda thing.  The left shoulder was me kinda going ""let's do something crazier"", and I agree it didn't end up feeling right. Definitely agree with the hands as well - thing with armor is I was trying to use the reference as a base and ""build"" the armor over it, and probably didn't do enough with the hands - they feel small and awkward. But yeah, that's something to work on.  :D Thanks a ton though! I love getting feedback like this."
SketchDaily,386xum,swjm,3,Wed Jun 3 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't do the theme today because I've wanting to try water colours ever since Meatyelbow day and I finally got myself some.

SketchDaily,386xum,emmusza,2,Wed Jun 3 02:12:26 2015 UTC,"Things with a luster (e.g. metals), or things that reflect or distort light (water, glass) are actually some of my favorite things to watercolor.  The medium just kind of lends itself to those types of things, in my opinion.  Watching tutorials or reading about watercolors is probably a good idea, but I always get more out of trying something for myself  (and probably screwing up in the process).  I'm on my phone at the moment, so not in great place to offer a critique right now (I'll try to remember to get back to it in the morning ).

SketchDaily,37xspu,micahkfg,3,Sun May 31 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"i agree that drawing ones self can be hard.. i think because we apply so many hidden descriptors to our image.  but kudos for not shying away from the challenge!  whenever i draw a face, i try to spend a few minutes just looking at the image, and especially observing where the light source is coming from, and how the shadows are falling across the various shapes.  in your image, you do have a passable likeness for the most part, but capturing the shadows can help to better depict the likeness. i see that you did catch some of the folds on your shirt, which is great, and you can use those same skills to observe shadows on a face as well.  i recommend looking up proko on youtube - he has a ton of awesome videos that have really helped me, as far as understanding how to draw facial forms and shadows."

SketchDaily,37xspu,swjm,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"your linework is interesting to me, i especially like the line running down the side of the nose.  i feel like it leads straight to the mouth and helps to ground the expression somehow.  i can tell that you are starting to formulate an understanding of the nuances of facial shapes by the way you drew the eyes, nose, and lips.  however, i think in this particular drawing, your set-up time was either rushed or non-existent.  this may also have something to do with your reference image - i've drawn a fair number of portraits and i think it's so hard to not see the top and back of the head.  it limits your capability to comprehend the head in 3d, and working from a ref photo as opposed to real life already flattens the reference so much.  but - the angle of everything in your drawing is ever so slightly not facing upward enough.  i think this definitely would have been more apparent to you if you were working with a pic that showed the back of your head.  if you get the head angle right from the beginning, it'll be that much easier for the rest of your structures to fall into the correct place.  i also don't know your goals as far as drawing portraits, but i personally like to start with shading where possible, rather than outlines.  you can build upon the shading and add some outlines later to more fully define things.  i personally think it's harder to  do outlines only when you are first starting to work with faces.  in other words, it's so much easier to stylize things once you have a better grasp on the fundamentals."
SketchDaily,37xspu,poledra,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting! That definitely is basically a 180 from the way I generally progress through my sketches...maybe worth a shot though, there's nothing saying I gotta do outline work first.  I definitely agree with the 3D comment though - I think I noticed my angles were off partway through and just went with it. I'd bet not being able to see everything was a huge part of it. Good catch, and a good thing to work on as well!  Thanks a ton for this!!! I'll definitely take this into account!"

SketchDaily,37xspu,Akaiii,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"i actually think some of your drawing lends to the realistic side.  it would be easier to critique with the reference image to compare to, but you rendered the light beautifully on the neck area especially.  also even if you can't paint a perfectly realistic face now, you are well on your way so don't stop working. :)  some areas do look a bit blocky - did you go back in with a hard-edged erase tool on some outlines?  that's how it comes across to me.  i also think you fell back on symbols for the main facial features, as opposed to rendering what it was you were actually seeing.  do you understand what i mean by this?  and finally i think your hair just looks a bit rushed, and the values within the hair don't make sense in comparison to the local values by each part of the hair - your top hair feels too dark, and the side hair is much too light, giving it an odd flat effect against the face.  i do really like the light in the eyes, i think it is compelling and with a few tweaks to soften the rest of your image, it could rest on the eyes holding the focus.  it's hard to tell what i should be fixating on as there are so many hard outlines."
SketchDaily,37xspu,poledra,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"wow thank you so much for taking time to type this all out! i have really hard time with noses, yeaah. i understand what you mean, its like i focused more on how i imagine a particular part to look rather than how it actually does on the reference picture.  i might have rushed on hair a bit... i was just really sick of this picture i think...   thank you a lot! i will try to eliminate those hard edges you mentioned"

SketchDaily,37tms6,Shinjoker,3,Sat May 30 08:14:14 2015 UTC,"tricky pose!  i'm not sure a figure was the best choice for this exercise, but i think you really managed to make the sword pop from the background anyway.  the figure itself has some minor anatomical issues, mainly with the foreshortening of the arms and legs, and trunk placement.  this photo was probably quite challenging due to the flash as well - it makes it hard to see where the values help define the forms.  due to this, despite the effect of the sword popping from the page, your figure looks a bit flat.  i much prefer the lines used in the legs, they are smoother and flow more fluidly, than the ones around the shoulders.  nice work, keep at it! :)"
SketchDaily,37tms6,poledra,2,Sun Jun 7 06:51:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the critique! I swear half the time was spent trying to think of something cool that might work lol. Regarding the foreshortening, is it more a matter of the angle, the placement of the limbs or the size? I did abandon the idea of rendering the figure to focus more on the sword and was afraid of what you said happening. The trunk was a bit of a mess, and at best guesswork, which isn't something I want to make a habit. I completely thought the same thing about the photo when I was getting into it lol. Anatomy in general is something I love, but of course struggle with among many other things :P.   Your detailed, very helpful insight got me curious, so I checked out your some of your submissions, and.. it'll take a while for my jaw to get back up to my face lol. Many thanks again :D"
SketchDaily,37tms6,Shinjoker,3,Sun Jun 7 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"you're welcome.  with regards to the foreshortening, unfortunately all of those things kind of contribute to it, as they all work together. but take a look at your image and the ref side by side, which is how it is most easily seen.  the chest space visible beneath the chin to the hand is too large on your drawing.  raising that arm will change its angle and force you to have to draw it larger, correcting the limb's appearance.  do you sketch out the figure's gesture first before you start to draw the individual parts?  this can help with getting the main pieces of the body in the correct place.  anatomy can be difficult as there are so many components coming together to comprise the image.  i know for me i can never have enough practice.  to be honest, i got to where i am from constant, daily practice for a couple years.  and i have a long way to go as well!  but thank you. :)"
SketchDaily,37tms6,poledra,2,Sun Jun 7 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"I did a side-by-side comparison and you're right, my dude has more chest space open, so it looks like the arm is more going down than towards the viewer. It's funny, because I think when I tend to draw, I'm usually checking for where everything is positioned relative to what I want to put down. I'd like to get in the habit of gesture drawing, since I do that more when not drawing from reference, but I have the bad noob habit of focusing on smaller details rather than the big picture.  I wish I'd kept up with drawing/painting every day way back when, but I'd likely hit the character cap with excuses lol. I agree though, practice makes progress, and I'm back into it again, so onward! And you're very welcome!"
SketchDaily,37tms6,Shinjoker,2,Sun Jun 7 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"supposedly a great habit to get into is ""warming up"" with a few, maybe 10-20, quick gesture drawings (30 sec or less, maybe a couple 2 min if you feel like it).  then once you're ready to get down to your main drawing, your brain will be all geared up to think about the big picture first.  it's easy to get bogged down in details for sure, harder to decide a larger theme to express.  believe me i struggle with this so much!"

SketchDaily,37tms6,swjm,3,Sat May 30 20:22:25 2015 UTC,"if you mean you've been stuck in your art, i am glad you have found inspiration again to keep drawing. :)  your figure here could benefit from a few anatomical tweaks (shoulder to elbow ratio for instance), but it is fairly well represented, and i like the flow of your lines.  i think to help your figure come out from the page visually, you may need to play up your value range quite a bit.  everything is pretty flat at the moment, and your shadows are nearly non-existent.  what makes an image like this successful, for example, is the attention to detail on the shadows.  were you working from a reference, or from imagination?"
SketchDaily,37tms6,poledra,2,Sun Jun 7 07:01:15 2015 UTC,"Reference! Pretty much always have a reference, although how much I depend on it varies. This one was pretty one-to-one.

SketchDaily,376jgr,morganmarz,3,Mon May 25 13:55:43 2015 UTC,The cool thing about knives are there really isnt a good way to do it. Its all you and how you think it should be done. Sure there are rules for how to apply oils and mixing colors but just go get a few blades and see what fits. Find some cheap paint and use oil paper so you dont blow through expensive canvas and just have fun! PM me if you need anything.

SketchDaily,376jgr,Portalboat,1 point,Tue May 26 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly practice, but some of the very textured brushes are a bit more forgiving on getting not getting the lines shaky. For me, personally, tablet size plays a part too. The larger the tablet, the easier it is to make big, bold strokes imo.  Programs like Lazy Nezumi, or stabilizers in Paint Tool SAI or Manga Studio can help out too :)"

SketchDaily,36ywmk,daker777,1 point,Sun May 24 10:32:23 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. I'll keep those two workflows in mind for the next time I practice figure drawing.
SketchDaily,36ywmk,supersugoinet,2,Mon May 25 05:30:10 2015 UTC,"I like you get the idea of the pose from each one, which is basically the goal from just 30 secs. Some look slightly ill-proportioned (short backs?), maybe try the stick figure type of gestures, with the action lines and balls for joints.  Proko's tutorial is great, and he'd say use longer basic lines for features and avoid the temptation to redo or add short fixes, though I feel it takes 5+ mins to plan/develop body shapes like he does."
SketchDaily,36ywmk,quandary13,2,Sat May 23 12:06:18 2015 UTC,Thank you! You mean like this? I'll try.  I always watch Proko's video before doing a figure drawing session; and I agree with you.
SketchDaily,36ywmk,supersugoinet,3,Sat May 23 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"Yes those are probably more effective to quickly understand the pose I feel, rather than trying to immediately block it in, even if I do skip that often. I did a couple more - gif1, gif2 - obviously it's digital but I'm really copying using a watercolor brushpen - like this dude.  There isn't really a wrong way to do it, it's just a way to get your brain thinking about the pose & proportions."

SketchDaily,36ywmk,sinisterglitter,1 point,Sun May 24 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"On the second index card, it looks like the fact that you know what you're drawing is getting in the way a bit of drawing what you see. And in all the skeleton ones, you're definitely keeping track of what body parts you're looking at and trying to parse the picture in terms of those. Try to do a few where you do the opposite: don't parse what you see as ""arm"", ""leg"", ""head"", etc. Quickposes has an upside-down mode specifically to make this sort of practice easier."

Ironically I feel like this is how I draw generally. I scribble away broadly and then turn the scribbles into details much further down the line.

If I try to do fewer, more precise lines, then I worry that I'll run out of time or finish too quickly. Though I went back and did a bunch of ones that way too, and it turned out okay.

Let me also apologize to myself for not posting last night, because there's less of a chance of anyone seeing this - but if you do, any tips would be really appreciated. I've tried these kind of things before, and would really really love to get better at them, but never felt like I've gotten even a basic set down.  Page 1  Page 2  Page 3  Page 4  Instead of 'getting' anything from these, they honestly seem to disintegrate into scribbles. I watched the Proko video, and generally think I understand what I'm supposed to be looking for, but find that the 30 seconds is far too short to do much more than the barest stickfigure. Hell, as you can see, I barely get a suitable placement on the page itself.  Raaaaah. Rant over. Sorry. I'll keep practicing these, trying to do some every day, I can definitely tell it's the sort of thing my work is missing, I'm just not ""getting"" it yet.

SketchDaily,36urly,AnonD,9,Fri May 22 20:18:33 2015 UTC,Sketches from this morning:  dragon  man on corner  Stuff from earlier this week:  lazy bear  lion knight  critique is highly appreciated!
SketchDaily,36urly,Feifner,2,Fri May 22 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"As for critique, I'd say two things.  One: when you go slower and take time then you will produce better art. The lion at the end was much better than the rest. Patience is key.  Two: draw a shit ton of shapes. Boxes, circles, cylinders, lines, angles, triangles. Be able to do a good shape however you want it to be.  Sorry if that's a bit vague. Mainly just take your time and practice"
SketchDaily,36urly,finniganian,2,Fri May 22 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"Haha that's funny, of the pieces I posted I like the lion post the least.   The lion has good values, but I don't really like the line quality or gesture in it. It was also the only one that used photo references.  While the other three were done much faster, they have strong lines and were a hell of a lot more fun to draw. They are closer to the type of stuff I want to make: strong, efficient lines with clear gesture.   I agree that I should learn to spend more time on a sketch adding values and detail, but I find it hard to do an extended drawing when sketching a moving target or drawing from imagination. Perhaps I should consult photos after I get a base sketch down.  thanks for the comment man!! I'll keep practicing :)"

SketchDaily,36urly,Victoro_Loco,8,Fri May 22 08:20:00 2015 UTC,First off my latest purchase: a professional drawing table!. Bought it from an old guy who was clearing out his old factory building. He couldn't get rid of it because of the weight and size so he sold it to me for only 20euro :D  Also been continuing my Walt Stanchfield studies: the 28 principles of animation and a few sketches that show as much story as possible in one image
SketchDaily,36urly,Deviou5,2,Fri May 22 09:39:56 2015 UTC,"I used to have that exact same model of drafting table. I routed a hole in the middle and put a disk in it. Ahh, great times. Did some decent work on that thing."
SketchDaily,36urly,Victoro_Loco,1 point,Fri May 22 14:25:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I love working on it :D So you mean a hole in the table itself? What is that disk used for?
SketchDaily,36urly,Deviou5,4,Fri May 22 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, right in the surface of the table itself. The disk is used mainly as a tool for animation; there are pegs along the top and bottom to hold pages in place so your sequences of drawings always line up. It's also backlit, and the whole thing rotates freely so you can draw nice smooth lines in any direction. It makes your nice drafting guides unusable though, so I just removed them from my table. Unless you use the table for architectural or other technical drawing I found it more than worth the trade-off."
SketchDaily,36urly,Victoro_Loco,3,Fri May 22 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"I bought it to have a big drawing  surface so I won't be using it for architecture or technical drawings. I'm more interested in comic drawing and animation, so I might look into a disk as well! Thanks for the info!"

SketchDaily,36urly,Stalked_Like_Corn,9,Fri May 22 11:16:33 2015 UTC,"My first attempt here.  Rejected sketches in the background  Closeup of sketch  This is Tunisia, the country I'm currently living in.  I'm from the US but am here now.  I added some interesting cities to my sketch.  Bizerte - Beautiful city just north of me Tunis - The capital of the country and where I reside Hammamet - Another great place to visit and where my wife /u/enti_san was born Sfax - never been here but it's pretty big and seem cool to go visit eventually Medenine - This place is ripe with history. In pre-colonial times, Medenine was already the most important trading centre in the south, attracting merchants from all over North Africa and even from Bornu, to the south of the Sahara. The Ksar housed the central granaries of the various nomadic Berber tribes of the region.  The area was the scene of an unsuccessful German counter-attack by General Erwin Rommel as part of Operation Capri during March 1943 against British Eighth Army forces. The Battle of Medenine was Rommel's last engagement in Africa before he was replaced by General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim as commander of the Afrika Korps. Tatouine - They shot a good bit of Star Wars: Episode 1 here.  They have a music festival there every year as well.  Unfortunately, it's in a very dangerous part of the country as it is in the middle of the trade route between Syria and Libya and it's believed ISIS operatives are camping out there in some places.  My sketches won't be as good as you guys (I only have a pen and some post-it's and nothing fancy like pads or skill)."

David Letterman in grayscale, because I got too frustrated with learning how to paint over grayscale. I took a few traditional painting classes way back when, so I tried to translate that to painting digitally (normal mode, background and just a layer for lineart + color). I'd like to get efficiently faster, and somewhat understand that grayscale then adding color is a good way to do that, but I guess I can't sprint before I learn how to walk -_-  /frustration  That said, maybe my own mad methods are serving me ok lol.

SketchDaily,36ciyn,mrbstro,1 point,Tue May 19 10:59:24 2015 UTC,Isn't his second number his old max number? and the first is the current streak?  So he would have done 643 as off now instead of 322?
SketchDaily,36ciyn,headcrab1991,2,Tue May 19 11:20:32 2015 UTC,"Nope. 322 is his current streak. 323 is how many times he's commented with a picture in a daily thread. So this means the first time he ever posted, the following day he didn't, so his first number was at 0 again. So on day two it was 0/1. Then the next day he then kept a streak for 322 days, that would make it 322/323.  Edit: For you, your at 8/8. If you skip a day, you'll be 0/8. Then after you skip a day you post again, you'll be 1/9."

SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,2,Fri May 15 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"I love the feel of that font. I have so many ideas for things I could do with it.  Are you open to critique at all, from one designer to another? Nothing major, I've just noticed a few characters that could use a few kerning tweaks (for example, the lower case k seems to have a little too much space to the left). Not sure if you're 100% done with this or still planning on making some changes.  Also your corgi logo thing is adorable."
SketchDaily,361fl9,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat May 16 01:38:49 2015 UTC,"Totally open! It does need some tweaks, I keep seeing more and more as I use it, stuff that is pretty hard to tell in the font program. But hey this is a free version! I was thinking of trying to make different weights or an outline version and maybe sell it?  But please point out anything that needs work, it would need to be perfected before I'd consider trying to sell it!"
SketchDaily,361fl9,grumpycorgi,5,Sat May 16 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"Wall of text incoming! I apologize in advance because your typeface is actually pretty balanced overall, so everything I picked to write about is really small and makes me seem super nitpicky. I really do like this typeface a lot and it's totally my style, so I'll see if I can incorporate it into anything I work on. If I do use it, of course I'll credit you.  A few things I've noticed.   The lower case ""c"" looks really small compared to the other letters, for some reason. This is most obvious when it's placed next to a wider letter. The dot for the lower case ""i"" gets lost when the font isn't a large size. I'd move it up a little bit to have the same distance as the dot for the ""j"" You don't have smartquotes, which I would add if you can (they can be the same as normal quotes if you don't want to make new glyphs) just because a lot of software tends to autocorrect to smart quotes and will switch your typeface out for a different one when it autocorrects. Anything with a vertical stem on the left, e.g. lower case b, h, k, m, n, etc. could be kerned to tighten up that space on the left. Same thing with vertical stems on the right, only in the opposite direction. Letters like a, d and q tend to have a bit of extra space on the right. If your font creation software lets you, consider specifically hand-adjusting the kerning for letter pairings with diagonals, e.g. AV, AW, Av, Aw, yA, etc. Those tend to be the problem pairings when it comes to kerning. Numbers-wise, 3 looks like it could use a little extra space on the right, 4 and 7 could use a little less space on the right. Could probably remove some space to the left of the comma. It looks a little far from the word when you put it after a letter. I'm sure the uneven-ness of your counters and x-heights are intentional, but just as a heads up, the differences get exaggerated when the text is small. I don't really expect anyone to want to use this for small text, but that may be something you want to check for when you're making final adjustments. Just do a paragraph of Lorem Ipsum and make the text size tiny. Also at smaller sizes, some of the line widths get a little screwy. For example, the left side of lower case d and the stem of lower case t turn skinny for some reason. At least on my PC in Microsoft Word.   I heard a good trick for kerning is to turn all your letters upside down. Not sure if that's an easy thing to do, but if you can manage it, maybe that's something you can try.  So that's all I had for now. You totally don't have to make all of those changes. Ultimately, the judgment call is up to you. But I hope you found that feedback useful. If you make an updated version, please send it to me. If you do a paid version, I'll pay for it as long as it isn't too expensive. :D"

SketchDaily,361fl9,slaybee,2,Fri May 15 15:23:38 2015 UTC,Those are fantastic.  I've tried so many times to make green -> yellow pigments work and never quite feel like I can pull it off like you have here.
SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,3,Fri May 15 22:06:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much! This means a lot coming from you, since you are such a huge inspiration to me! Everytime I look at your artwork it just makes me want to create something :D I've been reading and admiring the posts and comments in this sub for a looong time and only  yesterday decided to actively participate here (again) and your compliment really boosts my motivation to keep going this time."
SketchDaily,361fl9,slaybee,2,Fri May 15 22:37:18 2015 UTC,I'm not even a huge fan of broccoli but I had to stop scrolling and stare a bit because I'd eat everything on this page. Your colors are beautiful and you made all these veggies look juicy and delicious.
SketchDaily,361fl9,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat May 16 01:44:55 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! That is pretty much what I was trying to do here so that makes it especially nice to hear!
SketchDaily,361fl9,slaybee,24,Sat May 16 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"I've always imagined Meaty as a particularly muscular food item  Hey /u/MeatyElbow, you've been a huge inspiration in the almost-two-years that I've known you. You're not just a great artist, you're also an amazing community leader for groups spanning across multiple websites. Cheers. May your elbows be always meaty, or whatever the appropriate line here is."
SketchDaily,361fl9,7ofDiamonds,4,Fri May 15 08:00:18 2015 UTC,Then it's mutual inspiration - I've been a fan of your work for 654 days now (or so your flair would have me believe).
SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,24,Fri May 15 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Creds to you for being awesome /u/MeatyElbow! Your work and animations are always great and I'm really glad and proud that I get to be a part of the community we're all building. You deserve some fan art :D  Also, this being free draw, I got other stuff :3   tried applying some Anthony Jones wisdom while doodling around  Aaand I'm trying to get more into Manga Studio, so here's a page of gestures!   MMMmm doing linework in it feels sooo smoooth!"
SketchDaily,361fl9,Powersimon,4,Fri May 15 13:19:04 2015 UTC,What about Manga Studio is appealing to you?  Sketching?
SketchDaily,361fl9,LumpySpacePirate,6,Fri May 15 15:43:28 2015 UTC,great job btw
SketchDaily,361fl9,LumpySpacePirate,5,Fri May 15 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch :D It runs smoother than Photoshop on my tablet and linework feels really good, smooth and responsive. So I'm mainly into it for the possibility of doing line-heavy stuff in the future. Not that I'm planning on using it that much, but at that price I reckon it's worth knowing :D"
SketchDaily,361fl9,Powersimon,3,Fri May 15 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"Oh perfect! I've been considering switching to Manga Studio for a while but I wanted someone with first-hand experience to give me their feedback.  How's coloring in Manga Studio compared to photoshop? Also, have you tried that perspective grid snap feature, and how well does that work for you?  Also, as usual, your gestures have a weight and smoothness to them that I envy and one day hope to emulate."
SketchDaily,361fl9,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat May 16 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I think you'd love it! :D  I've barely scratched the surface, but there seems to be a lot of advanced, but really intuitive features that'll save us a bunch of time. Coloring, as far as I know, takes more cues from Paint tool SAI than from Photoshop. The color blending of the brushes is wonderful and the Anti-overflow feature of the brushes makes laying down color crazy fast :D  I did try the perspective grid-snap-feature-thingy, but only barely. It reminds me of the feature from Lazy Nezumi, but easier to control and also attached to single layers, which is really nice :) It'll definitely save me some time down the road if I get comfortable with it. Also, outside constraining yourself to 1,2 and 3-point perspective by default, there's stuff out there that allows you to use 4- and 5-point perspective as well! Pretty neat :D  I haven't gotten to customize my hotkeys and workspace just yet, but I've been trying to do whatever linework I can within the program just to get a feel for it. I don't think it'll replace my painting workflow any time soon, but for everything else it's a really strong contender :3  Also, afaik the only difference between the $50 and the $200 version is a lot of comic-page management tools and some 3d-features which, to me, seems somewhat unecessary unless you're working with it professionally over a long time. At least I think that's how it works on the comparison pages? :3"
SketchDaily,361fl9,Powersimon,2,Sat May 16 13:32:13 2015 UTC,Appreciated Simon - thank you.  I have no doubt that you do as much for this community as I do.  If you'd just fix that damned (n-1)/n flair.

SketchDaily,361fl9,ilostmyfork,7,Fri May 15 10:35:41 2015 UTC,"I'm far from an authority on the subject, but IMHO I think you might benefit from tightening up your rough sketches/construction work a bit more before laying the final line art on top. I really try to nail down all the design elements in my working layer so that the process of creating the final line art is just tracing everything with nice smooth strokes, and I feel like this went a long way towards helping improve my work.  I like your final product; the dress looks very ""meaty"" :)"
SketchDaily,361fl9,Deviou5,3,Fri May 15 12:10:07 2015 UTC,Ahh ok. Thanks for the feedback! I'll work on tidying it up a bit before I do my official lines. I guess I'm just got used to doing that and lining at the same time. I just saw your processy thing for your post so I'll try adding that step in there :D

SketchDaily,361fl9,supersugoinet,3,Fri May 15 08:30:54 2015 UTC,/r/glittercartel.  It's going to be huge.  The arc of your artistic progress since you started here is inspirational.  I always love seeing your work.

SketchDaily,361fl9,Lairosiel,10,Fri May 15 08:08:43 2015 UTC,What a coincidence - I did my last RGD ever this week as well.  This is a version without the black marker additions.  Those were added after I was banned.
SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,5,Fri May 15 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"What's an ""RGD,"" and why did you get banned from them?"
SketchDaily,361fl9,Deviou5,10,Fri May 15 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"""RGD"" is shorthand for RedditGetsDrawn (another art subreddit).  Quite a few of the artists here participate there as well.  I don't have any clue why I was banned - no reason was given and I haven't posted anything there in a while.  I'd been doing drawings there for a couple of years.    You're welcome to scan through my post history to see if you can spot the offending activity.  I'm almost positive I didn't do anything that broke any subreddit rules."
SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,2,Fri May 15 13:55:42 2015 UTC,"So it was your comments that were being deleted in that thread. I saw the mod responding to [deleted] comments, but she was quoting you and you sounded totally sensible, so I couldn't figure out why your comments were removed. I've since lost all motivation to participate there because I'm afraid the mods will ban someone after I draw them, it's happened to me before."
SketchDaily,361fl9,postpics,5,Sat May 16 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if my comments were deleted - I kind of stopped keeping track.    Whether are not a subreddit motivates you to create art or not isn't my decision - I strongly encourage you to pursue whatever you think helps you achieve your goals.  I personally think that a bottom-up approach is better (let the artists figure out what works) than a top-down approach (have someone removed from creation process determine what works).  That's just my opinion.  I have nothing but respect for the artists that do work in /r/redditgetsdrawn.  If it's still working for them, I certainly wouldn't want them to stop.  If they want to participate here (or anywhere else), I'm for that too."

SketchDaily,361fl9,rmoore923,3,Fri May 15 16:34:30 2015 UTC,"I originally did the piece for the ArtistLounge podcast, which ran kind of late into the evening.  My intention was to find the RGD thread the next morning and post there as well, but didn't get the opportunity prior to the ban."

The subreddit looks quite new, is it meant to be instructional like /r/artfundamentals or more asking for advice like /r/learnart? I'd love some recommendations for beginner watercolour products is all."
SketchDaily,361fl9,kelsifer,4,Sat May 16 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend this travel set for beginner watercolor painters. It's high quality paint, fairly affordable, and gives you just about every color you need until you find your feet.  Get fairly nice paper. Any paper 140 lb or more is good. Experiment with different papers until you find one that works for you. If you want a more painterly style, cold press may suit you. If you want a more illustrative style, try hot press.  Brushes don't really matter at the beginner level. Just make sure they're meant for watercolors. Also be sure they're nice enough that the bristles don't fall out as you paint. Basically the second the cheapest brushes you can come by are good for beginners.   If you have any questions, feel free to direct message me."

SketchDaily,361fl9,gayrudeboys,11,Fri May 15 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"I've known Meaty to be one of the most considerate people out here on reddit and a very generous artist. He's a beast with watercolour and it's always great to see his work pop up on my feeds!  Here's a portrait I did for sktchy - I've been on there as an alternative to RGD... Some unexplained bannings have happened lately that have me really confused. (seriously cold shit, wtf) It'll probably happen to me at some point so I've found another nice community for practicing people and portraits. However, I think this sub is a good place for practicing pretty much everything else :) I should start :P  Here's to you Meaty! Thanks for being awesome.

SketchDaily,361fl9,Zungado,3,Fri May 15 17:55:19 2015 UTC,What's funny about that piece is that I know I was working from someone else's drawing.  I can't remember who it might've been though.  Hopefully someone will draw from your reference in a month or so and we'll have an inadvertent game of telephone on our hands.
SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,5,Fri May 15 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"trying to start teaching myself figure drawing, planning on taking classes soon.  Here is my practice!  I have definitely improved from when I started, I have the old sketches but I'm sick and a little too lazy to grab them. I would really like some critique. I know that I need to spend a lot more time on anatomy, I have a good sense of where everything is, just having trouble with how it looks. I also know I need to learn the landmarks that make a pose look less rubbery and more lifelike. Things like where bones protrude and such. Any help is greatly appreciated!  I've been using Andrew Loomis's book figure drawing for all it's worth, along with a lot of videos for anatomy."

SketchDaily,361fl9,deligater,4,Fri May 15 19:55:26 2015 UTC,my favourite /u/MeatyElbow creation and one of the earliest i can remember seeing is cubicle bear
SketchDaily,361fl9,wittenwitten,4,Fri May 15 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"I was really close to breaking out cubicle bear again when we had the ferret theme.  You know, because a group of ferrets is called a ""business"" of ferrets.  I wanted to draw cubicle bear shopping his resume around, sitting down in an interview with a bunch of ferrets, things being kind of awkward.  I guess I know what I need to do before next Free Draw Friday."
SketchDaily,361fl9,MeatyElbow,2,Fri May 15 22:35:28 2015 UTC,it has great potential!   is there any more background to cubicle bear? like a alcoholic wife at home or cubicle bear kids he's trying to put through college so he has to work tirelessly for them
SketchDaily,361fl9,wittenwitten,2,Fri May 15 23:53:45 2015 UTC,Man.. I seem to remember someone else drawing a Mrs. Cubicle Bear in a SKD thread at some point.  Maybe she was an alcoholic.  I'll have to go do some research.

Edit:  It just occurred to me - you guys are welcome to promote your podcast here (there's a cross section of users that are already aware of it, but not everyone).    On Fridays we generally let people choose whatever theme they want.  I imagine a ""this is what I drew on my podcast this week"" submission would be well received."

SketchDaily,35t4ub,MeatyElbow,15,Thu May 14 02:59:17 2015 UTC,It's pretty slow and the turning radius isn't really worth the risk of death.
SketchDaily,35t4ub,SpookyMaidment,4,Wed May 13 08:21:40 2015 UTC,But the pure awesomeness from handling a wagon of leathery death? Totally worth the risk.

SketchDaily,35t4ub,MeatyElbow,2,Thu May 14 03:11:22 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I used these Derwent Water Colour Pencils and a water brush.  Most of the color was pencil first with a water wash.  The lines to denote the slats on the wagon I did by dipping a sharpened pencil in water and then drawing them.  First time I tried that technique and I'm pretty happy with the result.

SketchDaily,359qli,ninjamonkeydog,2,Fri May 8 19:30:44 2015 UTC,I'd love to have the anubis as a wallpaper
SketchDaily,359qli,Monochrome_Jones,2,Fri May 8 18:54:23 2015 UTC,I love your style!
SketchDaily,359qli,rplan039,2,Fri May 8 20:28:01 2015 UTC,I really like the way Anubis fades out at the bottom. Awesome stuff. Do you have more gods planned?
SketchDaily,359qli,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat May 9 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I've got lots! But I don't really want to start on them before I find a style I'm comfortable with being able to keep consistent through a whole series.   Anubis ended up looking cool enough, but it's not quite my style. I think I'd get bored with it. I'll need something that amuses me a bit, haha!"
SketchDaily,359qli,ninjamonkeydog,23,Sat May 9 10:01:26 2015 UTC,Drew one of my characters' ferret  Oh and happy birthday!
SketchDaily,359qli,Pyoh,2,Fri May 8 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"Woah, I love your style! This is adorable and the colors blend so nicely.  If you're up to it, I'd love to hear about your character. I like when other people talk about their OCs. :D"
SketchDaily,359qli,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat May 9 03:29:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   And oh boy, I don't even know where to start with that guy, because I created him.... around a decade ago maybe? And he has grown a lot, to a point that I almost don't consider him as a character (in the sense that he has a lot of depths personality wise, if I may say, and a ton of stuff happened/s to him). And I'm not really good when it comes to summary but I'll try to do it as best as I can.  It's also worth noting that my main project/story/thing is in a ""universe"" where an organization takes care of worlds, so it's basically a giant sandbox where I can experiment anything I want. Well, actually two orgs, the other one being my best friend's, since we merged our stuff together once we realized how complementary everything was. I still can't believe how well those two fit even tho we did that more than 5 years ago, ahah  ANYWAY  It's that dude here. His name's Aran L. Shanley, but prefers to be called Glenn as he got used to that fake name when he was running away from home when he was much much younger, to the point that it feels weird when anyone but his family calls him Aran. If you clicked on that link you might find him disproportionate (which might be the case still) but he's actually really tall. 7 feet tall. He's pretty self conscious about it, even if he comes from a ""humanoid race"" who is taller compared to humans, he's still pretty huge.  He's kind of a workaholic (he kinda has to, he's basically the best jack-of-all-trades of that org) but people think he tends to goof around more than anything else since he loves to joke and do dumb shit when he has the time for it. I could say in terms of cliché, he's that kind of big guy who smiles and laughs a lot and tries to make everyone happy if they have a problem, but he has also some issues when it comes to his mental, because of hereditary stuff and his missions. It's pretty superficial but he's such a huge character, it's hard to talk succinctly about him.  Oh in terms of animals, he has a huge weakness for them (and kids, too), and has quite a lot of pets; he rescued that ferret and another one during a mission and couldn't do anything but keep them once they were healthy again. Their names are Eucalyptus and Cyanide, he's really bad at naming pets. He once rescued a cat he called supercat because it had kind of an S shape on its head. He also has a german shepherd, an hermin, a harris hawk that is often taken care of by another guy, and a weird shadowy creature, too. His first pet was a young dragon/dinosaur whose species was tamed for merchandise transport. I can't tell you how happy he was when he saw it was still alive when he got back home for the first time in years, ahah.  Seriously, I could talk about that guy for days, if you want to know more about him, feel free to pm me! (And sorry for that messy tl;dr)"
SketchDaily,359qli,Pyoh,2,Sat May 9 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"Aw hell yeah sandbox world. I actually have a similar thing for my super personal OCs that I don't tell anyone about. Best setting.  I can totally tell you've spent a lot of time with this guy and that he's evolved into a really in-depth character. Your description included a lot of specific small things that really made him feel real. You seem the type who really loves talking about their OCs and I'm the exact same way so if you have anything else you want to share you can totally PM me a paragraph or five, otherwise I can PM you some questions if you're interested. I have a huge collection of ""character interview"" questions because I love filling those things out for my own characters."

SketchDaily,359qli,lindamartini,4,Fri May 8 08:49:07 2015 UTC,"Woahh those textures are lovely. You wouldn't happen to be able to describe or show your process for those owl feathers, would you? They look amazing and I always struggle with feathers like that."
SketchDaily,359qli,7ofDiamonds,2,Fri May 8 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you! Ah man I guess I go about it the same way you would paint fur. Shape out the feathers thickly at first, getting all the under and midtones in and the general direction shaped. Then I go into further detail working from the bottom up, layering the feathers. On his face I drew out a lot of individual strands in light tones then went over them with a low opacity blending brush (I work in Paint Tool Sai where blending is a dream <3) to make it look ""fluffier"" like down feathers. I'm not sure if that really explained anything, I'm still figuring it out myself :x Wish I had done a progress gif!"
SketchDaily,359qli,lindamartini,2,Fri May 8 18:06:50 2015 UTC,"No, that was really helpful, thanks! If you do do a process gif, though, please ping me because I'd really love to see it!"
SketchDaily,359qli,7ofDiamonds,2,Sat May 9 03:13:58 2015 UTC,"Ahhh I love SAI's brushes and its lineart potential! I'm still getting used to the program, though. x_x If you don't mind, could you please tell me your brush settings if it's a custom brush? I've had some difficulty finding the right texture for my brushes and yours look both sharp yet blended at the same time. (if that makes sense)  Your owl is amazing by the way, it's so inspiring. <3"
SketchDaily,359qli,aliceofoz,2,Sat May 9 07:47:43 2015 UTC,"Sure! The brush I used here was this one (the ""Painty"" one, I played around with the opacity and blending settings now and then) and the last brush here (I switched it to MidFlat because I like the brush strokes better) - Also that first tumblr I linked to has a ton of Sai brush settings so take a look around :) And thank you!"

I noticed a couple finishing touches you applied in the process gif: what seemed to be a tweak to the blur effect, and a slight color correction. Can you elaborate on why and how you applied these changes? The final image has a photographic look to it that I think adds an amazing bit of polish."

Though I do once in a while make something that takes a few hours, it usually takes minutes until I’m tired of drawing.  If you want to become faster at drawing, try limiting yourself to a fixed amount of time for each drawing. Set a timer, and the moment it runs out, stop drawing immediately."

I really try to think in terms of 3d and filling my shapes out. I'm hoping that it will eventually lead to more 'full' looking drawings.

When you've got up and down, and then left and right and then kinda... just everywhere, it's kinda visually confusing.   Basically, for your first layer, you need ///////// and then over that, you'll put strokes in the opposite direction \\\\\ to indicate where your shadows are, since it'll naturally darken the area as you layer more graphite over the top of it.   ...

I appreciate any critique/help."
SketchDaily,34ls3m,ambrdst,4,Sat May 2 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"I think you should feel more free to fill in the body and search for the line when you're doing quick sketches.  I'm not super-sure on the specifics of what ""gesture drawing"" means, so maybe this isn't it, but when I learned to do quick sketches as warm-ups it was pretty much the opposite of trying to hit the right line in one or two goes. It's closer to building the figure up from the inside out. So, very vague scribbling to get the overall shape down (not just a skeleton), then gradually putting down more scribbles to find the contours and get at finer details. Lines aren't commitments.  A lot of the time this ends up making a super-busy barely comprehensible mess like this, but they're not supposed to look good. It's an exercise, just like, say, blind contour drawings. It's supposed to help you think of the drawing as something with more ""body""."

SketchDaily,33sv93,OneiricOstrich,5,Sun Apr 26 00:49:14 2015 UTC,I went for something a little different and decided to try and do this same effect with a corridor! And now I've added shadows.  The shadows feel completely unatural though- if anyone has any hints or tips they would be well recieved.
SketchDaily,33sv93,ProKidney,6,Sat Apr 25 10:28:19 2015 UTC,"Really good work with the 5 point perspective!  my tips:   don't ever shade with black/draw light with white. the highlights + shadows will pretty much always be a different value to the actual (local) colour.   If you're using a cold light (electric lights, moonlight), the shadows will be warm-tinted and vice versa (so under a cold light, if the walls are yellow, the shadow is yellow-orange and the highlights will be yellow-green in this case)   have definitive light sources, currently it's as if the viewer is holding a lantern in an unlit hallway, which is all good if that's your intent, but i would have thought ceiling lights would be there. There is something called ""ambient occlusion"" that means shadow tends to occur in corners and crevices (like the joins from floor to wall) generally try to use long straight smooth lines, rather than multiple short ones. It's fine to have multiple attempts using ctrl+z   my shot at it"
SketchDaily,33sv93,Scoutrageous,2,Sat Apr 25 11:16:42 2015 UTC,Thats sone really great advice! When I get a chance I'll redo the shading with this stuff in mind. Maybe a few different times. I was hoping to give the place a slightly dark vibe- like an abandoned building.

If one line is off in angle, the rest of the drawing is off forever. Is sketching all that bad?"

SketchDaily,32whjy,MacAnthony,4,Fri Apr 17 14:37:31 2015 UTC,Isn't all digital painting cheating? I don't have an undo button on my watercolors... =/
SketchDaily,32whjy,magicsebi,8,Fri Apr 17 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"I understand this argument, but I've always found it a little funny. Are there rules to art that one breaks by using a certain medium? Is erasing cheating? What if someone uses digital, but doesn't use the undo button? (I do this with my speedpaints because it's faster just to color over with a different color, which is equivalent to how I used to oil paint.)  I know it comes from a, ""I feel like this person didn't put in as much effort as I (or other people) did, and therefore they don't deserve as much attention/praise"" kind of stance, and I used to think that way too, so I've been on both sides of this discussion. But I think that's also somewhat of an unhealthy way to look at art as an artist. In my opinion, someone's art shouldn't be invalidated as ""cheating"" because of how they chose to create it."
SketchDaily,32whjy,7ofDiamonds,5,Sat Apr 18 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"Digital painting absolutely isn't ""cheating"" - it's a different art form. The fundamentals of art are still the same, you still have to have a grasp of things like lighting direction, perspective, composition and colour theory to do anything with art at all. Digital painting has a few tools that make it easier to correct mistakes, sure, but you have to be able to see that there are mistakes in the first place to correct them at all.   Yeah, it has an undo button - several hundred layers of history as well down to the individual brushstroke, and in that regard, digital painting is harder and less forgiving because you absolutely -can- be perfect, down a single brushstroke.   I agree with you, 7D. I've poured 50+ hours into a digital painting and the idea that using traditional media is somehow ""harder"" or ""more praiseworthy is silly."" I had to learn how to draw before I even touched a tablet, and I still have several dedicated trad sketchbooks to keep my figure skills going."
SketchDaily,32whjy,synesthesiatic,3,Sat Apr 18 05:26:24 2015 UTC,"exactly.  From my personal standpoint, i don't often do digital art... I have, in the past, held that view that digital art is 'cheating' and i've come to terms with it... more or less.  I'm an ink artist.  I rarely put down a pencil sketch before tackling my subject with full on inking.  That said, my art is ""speedpainting"" in an essence, as i can knock out an ink portrait in 30 min.    Ironically enough, when i try to do digital painting it takes many hours.  ha!  Lately i've been doing ballpoint for here at work, and that takes a good few hours all told, so that's more on par with normal work, but that said is speed painting in general cheating?  How is my 30 minute ink portrait better than a digital painting?  If anything it's a hipster argument... creating art in a physical form gives the art more 'soul' they might say... Hell i did a portrait for RGD in a 3D modelling program.  Took me 2 days.  Can't tell me that's not work... can't tell me that's not as good as drawing it with a sharpie / india ink... I'd say, though it's fair to assume that it's not as good as actually sculpting it.  But that doesn't negate the piece's own value.  Basically, to all the nay sayers - try it.  You go and make an 'amazing' piece of digital art and tell me how easy it was."
SketchDaily,32whjy,RichardMcNixon,2,Sat Apr 18 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's a different way of creating art and it has its place. It makes the process easier if you know what you're doing and I have nothing against it. However I don't think it's a good way of learning to draw or paint. If I draw and especially if I write something I prefer to use old-fashioned ways as I believe the brain learns better that way."
SketchDaily,32whjy,magicsebi,3,Sat Apr 18 06:18:58 2015 UTC,You can't cheat when there aren't any rules.
SketchDaily,32whjy,megaswan,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:09:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude! :D I've had a hard time approaching much realism lately, but these live drawing sessions are always a nice opportunity to just sit down and just go all in for observing the subject.  Just saw this thread now too, haha.  While I wouldn't call it ""cheating"" it definitely helps getting to use layers, undo, color corrections and warping tools all within seconds. Seeing all the others there using traditional media I find it that the tool doesn't make my result better (there are others there that makes totally mindblowing stuff with their watercolors), but it makes me achieve it much faster :)"

Took a piece of calligraphy scrap paper (which I had used for warming up -- it's a bunch of random letters/words/pen strokes), dry mounted it to a piece of foam core with a clothes iron, brushed matte medium over the calligraphy to prime the paper, and then brushed pastel ground on top of the matte medium. Then I let it cure for a day before playing with pastels on it; it turned into a kind of abstract-ish tree thing. Textures are fun!

SketchDaily,32whjy,7ofDiamonds,2,Sat Apr 18 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and I just started about a couple weeks ago after watching some free tutorials by Ctrl+Paint. I'm interested in learning how to use different brushes, color theory/relativity, just an overall style that I can learn from. It's a new medium for me so anything will probably help."
SketchDaily,32whjy,ExDrK,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"For different brushes, you really just want to experiment with them. If you need brushes, you can grab them online pretty easily, depending on your software. If you use Photoshop, this is the brush set that /u/powersimon is fond of. There are probably some process videos out there where people show off the brushes they use, too, though I wouldn't know off the top of my head where to find them.  For style, honestly my stance towards style is to either just experiment with a bunch of things until you find something comfortable for you, or to pick a handful of artists that you admire and do studies of all your favorite pieces until you pick up a few techniques. (I wouldn't recommend picking just one artist because then you end up copying their style verbatim and don't really develop your own.)  For color theory, here's a good tutorial on the basics and the Serious Saturday on colored lighting has a few as well. My trade secret when it comes to color palettes though, is looking at pixel art tutorials. Pixel artists understand color like no one else.  Also you didn't specify this but it seems in line with your interests so Here's the Serious Saturday post on material/texture studies, has a few tutorials in there too.  Hopefully those are the kinds of things you're looking for. Hit me up if you need anything else. Happy to share my stash. :D"

I was trying to get familiar with the stylus, but it still feels frustrating to use.  Miku from reference. Reference found here.  idk."
SketchDaily,32whjy,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat Apr 18 06:20:41 2015 UTC,"In addition to /u/RichardMcNixon's great advice, going from, say, pencil to tablet is similar to going from pencil to paintbrush. It's a new tool, and it's going to take some time before your muscle memory picks it up. The more you use it, the more comfortable you'll be. The bad news is that there's no shortcut, but the good news is that you get more used to it the more you use it, even if you don't do any special practice."
SketchDaily,32whjy,Sincerely-a-bookworm,3,Sat Apr 18 07:59:40 2015 UTC,"That's actually why I wanted to use this subreddit's challenge as a means to get myself to sketch each day (since I'd usually go 4 - 8 months or more between each completed drawing) and also practice the tablet at the same time. But like I said in my reply to RichardMcNixon, I just got frustrated that the process was not working well for me. I do want to get back into using the tablet since digital art appeals to me so much, but not to my arm and wrist, apparently. Maybe that gets better with time? And, oh gosh, colors are so, so hard. >< Thank you for the post, though!"
SketchDaily,32whjy,7ofDiamonds,3,Sat Apr 18 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of facets to art. Don't let yourself get overwhelmed! Pick one skill at a time to improve, and don't forget to draw just for fun. Let yourself do silly pointless doodles, in addition to the harder stuff!  In response to your other comment, I used to sketch the same way you do. I'd make my ""sketch"" layer so detailed that there wasn't much difference between the sketch layer and the lineart layer. What helped me was to do multiple layers of sketching. I don't have any good examples, so I'm going to steal my best friend's old art and hope she doesn't mind.   You can see here that she uses a lot of sketch layers. Bottom one is like a stick figure, then she does a new layer for drawing the body to get the proportions she wants, and then a new layer on top for clothing, and then another layer for details, and then finally her inks. You don't have to go quite that far, I tend to do one scribbly layer for blocking things out (just stick figures and circles and squares), and then a sketch on top of that, then lineart.  Why does this help? Well, for me at least, I spent too much time on my sketch layer worried about getting the details right. This means that I wasn't taking risks and I wasn't looking enough at the bigger picture. My drawings, while detailed, ended up lacking a lot of emotion and looked too stiff.  You mentioned having trouble getting your hands to play nice with your pen, and I'm wondering if maybe your perfectionism might be getting in the way? So I suggest letting yourself make really messy sketch layers (even if they're not your final sketch layer), just to see how it feels. If nothing else, it's a great warmup.  Best of luck. If you ever feel like you need support, definitely reach out to this community. Everyone here is fantastic when it comes to advice and encouragement. Looking forward to seeing more of your art!"
SketchDaily,32whjy,Sincerely-a-bookworm,3,Sun Apr 19 05:22:13 2015 UTC,"I think you are right in that my perfectionism is getting in the way. It used to halt many of my attempts at sketching in the past, and I think I may have regressed due to trying a new medium. That would explain a lot of the frustration.  Seeing your friend's art and having your process explained helps so much! It's actually reassuring to hear how you used to sketch in a similar fashion. I think I've been afraid to get messy, but I should give it some honest attempts. My (amazing) friend that's been doing sketchdaily with me has tried to encourage it, but I gave up too soon. I'll see what I can do.  Thanks, this helps a lot. Especially the reminder to do more silly and pointless doodles. I think I have done maybe one or two of those in the past few years. Oops."
SketchDaily,32whjy,RichardMcNixon,2,Sun Apr 19 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"one thing that helped me with sketching with a tablet was drawing a muted sketch on a separate layer ... like, take a light blue color and just get the shapes / proportions down... then go in with the black / heavier colors and do the actual drawing over it.    You can change the opacity on the sketch layer to make it less obtrusive... then just remove the sketch layer or make it invisible before saving the final file.  The pen is only the first part - you gotta take advantage of the shortcuts that digital work provides you :D"
SketchDaily,32whjy,Sincerely-a-bookworm,2,Sat Apr 18 07:35:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, I've heard of such a process before for both digital and even traditional art. I have yet to try it for either medium... well, I guess I sort of made an attempt at it in a recent digital sketch, but I had a lot of trouble with it. The only way I've found myself able to ""sketch"" is by spamming alt-z until eventually one of my strokes goes the right way, at which point it's precise enough to be line art, making the under layer feel a bit redundant. I don't know. I ended up focusing on graphite since my wrist and arm cannot get the stylus to operate fluidly. I'll definitely keep your suggestions in mind, though, thank you. :c"

SketchDaily,32f5h9,interglossa,3,Mon Apr 13 10:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing s/w and h/w mean software and hardware. I use a WACOM Intuos 4, and I still use openCanvas as my primary art program (I don't recommend it. It's ancient and lacks a lot of essential features. It's just what I'm used to.)  For the process gif, I took screen captures of my canvas every few minutes to use as frames for the animation, and then animated it in photoshop. Let me know if you want a more detailed rundown of how to do this."

SketchDaily,32f5h9,aliceofoz,2,Mon Apr 13 08:06:08 2015 UTC,How did you do that? Its incredible.
SketchDaily,32f5h9,sweetpea122,3,Mon Apr 13 18:47:20 2015 UTC,"Oh thank you! Hmmmm well I use mainly Photoshop CS5 to draw and paint. For the cat, I started by using a reference to get the basic shape down before filling it with color, shading, and some smoothing in the end. (I used 3-4 colors in here, and I usually stick with a small palette because it's much simpler.) I tend to go over the color layer with an airbrush set to overlay just to get the lighting a bit brighter/darker in some places. (For my more serious works, I'd do this really often, around 4-5 times because I love experimenting with lighting and colors. And there's always the Undo button if something goes wrong!)  For the girl, it's basically the same process, but with a lot more scribbling."

SketchDaily,327nrw,Powersimon,2,Sat Apr 11 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"If I were to try shadowing and colouring hair like you do here in the 5min ones, but with traditional media on paper, what kind of pencil/marker/... would you suggest?  I really dig your 5min sketches!"
SketchDaily,327nrw,Victoro_Loco,3,Sat Apr 11 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really know about traditional stuff, but back a few years I really enjoyed working with a clutch pen, and the guy who I look up to the most in life drawing these days does some amazing things with customly sharpened conté crayons :D  Anyways, others on here knows this stuff way better than me. Halp pls :D  Also thanks :D"
SketchDaily,327nrw,Powersimon,3,Sat Apr 11 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"It is a very cool style. If I were to have the skill to approximate it (which I don't), I would use soft charcoal for the shadowing, which I would probably blur with a clean finger for the spontaneous, free feeling. The line work could be done with a pen, but most pens would make a sharper line. Dark pencils (6B, 8B and up) would work, but the blurring/shading would have to be done before the line work, which would be tricky. A more experienced artist may have more ideas. :)"

SketchDaily,327nrw,squidbiskets,32,Sat Apr 11 12:59:35 2015 UTC,"What? An excuse to draw my novel's protagonists? Awesome! About 20 minutes a sketch, 3 very different faces, people and palettes.   Also it's odd that someone brought up prosopagnosia, as I have a mildish form of it that's linked with autism and recognizing facial expressions and the emotions they convey! I took up portraiture in an effort to try and get better with identifying people's faces and their facial expressions."

SketchDaily,327nrw,synesthesiatic,4,Sat Apr 11 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"Did portraiture help?  I really love your style. The way you shade is just beautiful, and I'm impressed you can get such a clean look in only 20 mins per sketch!  Tell me about this novel of yours. :D"
SketchDaily,327nrw,7ofDiamonds,12,Sat Apr 11 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. :D  Sorry it took me so long to get back to you! I work overnight shifts, so I went home and slept after I submitted this. Portraiture has helped me a little. When I remember to, or I meet someone important, I like to draw them so I can remember what it feels like to know their face.   ... That's hard to explain. Drawing is a very tactile, sculptural process for me, so by drawing someone's face, I ""feel"" it, as creepy as that sounds!  To memorize what someone ""looks"" like, I have to figure out how their face feels.   My parents didn't know I needed glasses until I was 8 or 9, so in addition to having autism, I grew up not being able to see people's faces very well. I can identify REALLY obvious emotional content, but not subtler stuff, and if you make me look at a photograph of people with expressions and ask me to interpret them I'm like, ""what.""   I use MyPaint with a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet, so that's a lot to do with it. MyPaint mimics normal media and it's super simple to use so I tend to do all of my sketches and concept work in it rather than Photoshop as the interface and brush dynamics are much more user friendly.   My novel is a science-fiction / fantasy work revolving around a utopian future. At some point in human history, everything electronic was abruptly erased; credit cards, the internet, anything and everything stored electronically was gone. The same day, magic entered the world. After war, and the peace after the war, the presiding government has begun hunting down magic users, but no one knows why.   The novel focuses on an android's mission to regain her memory. It incorporates Irish and Arthurian myth, aliens, and time travel. It's been a work that's encompassed most of my life. It's finished, but I'm letting it breathe for a little while before I start work on refining the 3rd and final draft.   Allicit is the woman in the upper left hand corner, she's one of the main protagonists. On her right, the blonde, is Natalia, the other protagonist. In the bottom quadrant you've got Vladimir, who is Natalia's brother.   The novel's called Quantum Memory, and it'll be eventually split into three or four books."

SketchDaily,327nrw,synesthesiatic,3,Sun Apr 12 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, don't worry about it, I don't expect people to be on Reddit every hour of their lives.  The whole sculptural process thing makes a lot of sense to me! I'm used to describing people in terms of senses other than sight. It's really neat that you can use your art as a tool to remember how people look. I haven't tried anything like that because I don't think I've quite figured out how to break down faces into 3D structures like that yet, but now I'd like to try, just to see if it helps me out, too.  I'm generally okay on facial emotions as long as there's other body language to go with it, but everyone always talks about how you can read so much about a person in their eyes, and looking at someone's eyes doesn't do much for me. You know how sometimes when like, newspapers and stuff try to censor someone's identity by drawing a black bar over their eyes? I used to get really confused about that because it didn't hinder my perception of that person at all, and I never realized other people were so big on eyes as traits for identifying people.  I'm not really looking for new drawing software but thanks for bringing MyPaint to my attention. I like to try to keep up to date with open source art programs, just to see what people are doing. You do a great job with it!  Also your novel sounds really interesting. Irish/Arthurian myths and sci-fi time travel stories are my jam. If you're the type who likes to ramble on about your original stories, I'd love to let you ramble at me. This comment is getting long though, so I'll PM you my Skype and we can chat more there!"

I think the value on the underside of your roller is lighter in your piece than in the reference photo.  The values of the cast shadows could probably also be a little darker.  The box behind the brushes might also be a little wider in your piece than in the photo... or maybe it's shorter.  I probably wouldn't have noticed, but the cast shadow of the brush on the box seems to make a different shape than in the photo.  The top of the projector (?) looks kind of concave in your piece, but convex in the photo.  I'll bet, after thinking about it a little bit, that all of those things can be attributed to drawing from life rather from a still image.  Like I said earlier, nice work."

SketchDaily,323k0v,sunstep,3,Fri Apr 10 08:18:27 2015 UTC,"Something I've noticed in my own drawing is that a lot of the time when I can't get something to ""pop out"", it's because I'm shying away from a boundary between two objects, and I end up with slivers of blank paper or lighter/less-worked art between them.  Where the staff meets the beard looks a little flat to me. The hole between the arm and the staff looks like a hole on the arm side, but doesn't really drop back from the staff on the staff side, and it maybe the sliver of white between that space and the staff has something to do with it, whether it's there because it's unworked or just because that part of the beard happens to be lighter. The bits on the boundary of Radagast also show a bit of that where they meet the staff (the hood and the belly)."
SketchDaily,323k0v,antonfire,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I see what you mean! It's more noticeable where the staff meets the lower part of the beard. That's an easy adjustment. :)"

The ones above were all done in GIMP, mostly by using G'MIC filters until I got satisfied with the results.  Here is the fifth one, that I did just now, and is the only one I actually drew by hand. It was done mostly in MyPaint, and GIMP was used to make it symmetric."

SketchDaily,30colz,Twalup,5,Thu Mar 26 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"I took this opportunity to draw an old dream/nightmare of mine - the story of Arsonade's Shovel and the devil.  The dream essentially went like this: I was a villager in a medieval town. For some reason noone could understand Satan himself had taken up residence in the local creepy church on the hill. He wasn't hurting anyone, and it seemed almost as if he was there on vacation, but the whole town was quite upset. Eventually, though I didn't personally see a problem with him being there, I either voulenteered or was voulenteered to go get him to leave. For some reason dream me decided the best way I could do this would be to hit him with a shovel, and for some reason the townsfolk thought this was a great idea. I entered the church alone wielding my shovel and approached the prince of darkness. He instantly appeared in front of me, gave me the most insidious/amused look imaginable, and said sommething to the effect of 'I exist within an eternity of infinite suffering and persist within everlasting torment. Even if you managed to hit me with it, what makes you think that you could harm me with a shovel?'  I never found out how the fight ended; I woke up from the sheer embarrassment."

In my classroom at that time, we even made a ranking of ""most reliable erasers"" depending on their accuracy in getting test answers correct. My eraser never made it to the list D:"

But that doesn’t really represent my childhood. This does. I kid you not, it is the only game I really remember playing as a child.

SketchDaily,2zvyp6,Fiery-Heathen,7,Sun Mar 22 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand your situation.  I think I drew for close on 20 days, only posting my work on a private Tumblr which I made a point of keeping to myself and leaving all images untagged. What clicked for me one day after finding sketchdaily (but before participating) is that there's nothing but support here. Hell, you can't even downvote a post on this sub unless you're on mobile. Everyone's here to appreciate each other's artwork, and if requested, give critique and tips where applicable.   Another thing to take note of; there's no skill level that's expected if you want to participate. We get doodles, sketches and completed art pieces. A 5 minute post-it note sketch is just as appreciated as an epic digital piece with all the trimmings.   Looking forwards to the day you feel comfortable posting your artwork!"

SketchDaily,2zvyp6,tingtong70,9,Sun Mar 22 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"It's cliche, but I find trial and error works best. I try to never continue with something that I'm unsure of. Hell, I think I re-drew the arm holding the bow about 6 times before it looked right, and the head at least 3 times.   As for proportions? Ignore what you know, and draw for the situation. Between my 4 mice, the proportions vary pretty wildly, but for a reason. Today's mouse (the bowman); I wanted a less serious look, and went for a bigger head and shorter arms with smaller hands. But the future mouse obviously has a smaller head which gives it a bit more of a serious look. If I wanted realistic proportions, there would be no gun/bow wielding mice in my pictures as their arms just aren't big enough for what I wanted to do. None of these at all have realistic proportions(Google a real mouse, these look nothing like that), but their proportions are consistent with the look I was after, so just set yourself a look and run with it! Be consistent!   ..pretty sure that was all rambling, but hopefully you can gain something from it hahaha."

That being said, I think you could work on your line weight. Compare the lines that outline his shoulders to the lines that outline his legs. Also compare the 'X' on his chest and the pads(?) on his upper thighs. In both cases, the former lines are very clean, thin and precise, but the latter lines are much thicker. I think consistency is important. Personally, I prefer the thinner lines but pick which style YOU like and stick with it. It's interesting to note that your doodles have really good and varied line weight. I especially like the side portrait and the cowboy.

SketchDaily,2zkcmo,iganokage,5,Thu Mar 19 08:12:31 2015 UTC,I like the shaded version. It gives it more dimension IMO.
SketchDaily,2zkcmo,LmaoSomeNerd,7,Thu Mar 19 08:15:52 2015 UTC,Vary the line weight on the simple version. You'll find that it 'pops' a lot more.

SketchDaily,2zkcmo,wakawakamoose,4,Thu Mar 19 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"I love being able to answer questions! :D  I don't have a whole lot of resources besides my head hahaha. I'm currently enrolled in a fine arts college so I'm still learning as well.  I personally classify realism as simply trying to recreate what is seen by the artist with the finest detail possible (depends upon skill level). Of course realism can be beautiful (because reality is) but I don't find it to be the most successful style if you want to make it big in the art world. To be frank, many Asian families churn out children who are trained since birth to be a fine artist and can create hyper realistic images using traditional or digital (which is much easier) mediums. Other nationalities do the same, but from my experience all of the people who I would describe as ""human printers"" are asian and extremely talented. That's why your own individual style is so important. Everyone is their own individual and you have to market that in order to see success in the art world.   Sorry if that got ramble-y, I'm on mobile and don't have the time rn to go back and edit what I wrote. If you would like to know anything else I would be more than happy to provide help :)  Also remember there's tons of people thinking the same things you are, so.... Google is always your friend when you need a straight forward answer. And if that doesn't work, I'll be here :)  Hope this was what you're looking for :)"

Pokémon dailies this week: Spheal family, Donphan VS Scolipede, All 18 Arceus Formes, shiny Shinx, Snivy, Carvanha, Voltorb and Exeggcute family, and finally Sigilyph.  Extra Pokémon doodles this week were: Skuntank, Jumpluff, Mega Blastoise, Mega Beedrill, Genesect, the Johto starters, Meganium, Typhlosion and Feraligatr and finally, Watchog.  I drew a cute lady as well for SKD, in case 'ya missed it. Based on the SKD Reference site.   No RGD this week, unfortunately. I'm working on two commissions at the moment, but once I'm done I'm coming back full force."

I used a couple photo references of him and processed one of them a few different ways in Photoshop in order to try to get a grasp on the lighting situation. The photos I wanted to use were taken in very diffuse light, but the direction I was taking required strong direct light. I think I handled that conflict passably and made some reasonable choices in exaggerating the shadows, but his face still ended up a mess and I eventually didn't want to keep trying to mess with it. I also ran into some proportion trouble from using different references for his torso and his head; I would have probably been better off taking more artistic license with everything shoulders down rather than trying to work more literally from a photo."

This made him want chicken wings and I texted him to make some then, so he asked how, and I jokingly said he first had to raise some chickens. This is where it begins to go wrong. He claims he accidentally cloned a T-rex, so I tell him to train it to hunt for chickens, but he tells me a T-rex would have trouble hunting chickens. Now this is where the drawing comes into existence. I tell him to to train the T-Rex to hunt greyhounds so they can be trained to follow the T-rex's command to hunt for chicken wings.  Trust me, my friend and I do not do drugs. We just like to make insanely crazy scenarios from random things."

I'm working on Spheal but I'm not finished right now. I'll put that under tomorrow's post.   On the topic of Pokémon, I've started to do some extra sketches when bored. I started last Saturday when RGD had the mega thread. Spinarak, Bronzong, Aegislash, Noivern, Lampent, Accelgor, Sliggoo, Beeheeyem and finally Mewtwo.   RGD for this week! A scornful ice queen, a girl with curls, a Street Fighter couple, a mysterious woman, and a pouty girl.  And finally, to send this Free Draw off, here's my tribute to Leonard Nimoy. His death came out of nowhere man. He will SERIOUSLY be missed."

SketchDaily,2y4d3u,LucarioPrime,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"Those pokemon just took me back to when I was 9. This is hard to explain, but like, the Graveler one really reminded me of Sugomori's old art style. Gens I and II had this really lovely style, like classic anime blockiness but with this grace when it came to movement and structure, it really emphasized the creature-ness of Pokemon. The art is great in the new games, but it isn't quite the same. Anyway, sorry for ranting, killer work!"

It's a fun process just letting the fuzz take over and do whatever but it is slightly ... Uncomfortable since I'm normally into realistic portraits rather than sketchy dribble ones...   Oh these things also come out at like 7pm - my least creative time and by the next morning after being excited over the theme and ideas ... I just sort of forget the whole thing :(   So here's the old guy. I'm not a guy... But I'm suffering chronic depression and severe generalised anxiety with forms of OCD. So I always feel like my imperfections are visible on the outside and this is what my spaced out down brain vomited onto the page.

For example, Here's one of the paintings I've done without the 3D effects and here's a wiggle gif of it to simulate 3D (poorly).

SketchDaily,2xrqtb,gravitydefier,2,Tue Mar 3 11:48:38 2015 UTC,I used StereoPhoto Maker to make the wiggle gif above using .mpo files from my 3DS (or 3D camera if you have one) but you can get much better results by using 3DWiggle. Only catch is that you can only save it as a video file without paying for the software. You can probably make one too in photoshop but I don't specialize in gifs there.

SketchDaily,2xrqtb,SevenSapiens,3,Tue Mar 3 15:15:28 2015 UTC,Most likely you're crossing your eyes in such a way that it inverses the left/right images so you see the 3d effect in reverse. Try this one. I reversed the left/right pictures so it should work for you (looks weird to me though).
SketchDaily,2xrqtb,gravitydefier,3,Tue Mar 3 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"I don’t think there is more than one way to cross your eyes, and I never had problems with looking at this kind of 3D images before.  Anyway, the effect with the swapped images looks perfect, thank you for going through the trouble of doing that. Somehow, I hadn’t thought of doing it, despite the fact it was an obvious solution. (Also, a quick Google search for “cross eye 3D” reveals that the left image is supposed to be on the right and vice-versa.)  Damn how I wish I had a 3DS now."

SketchDaily,2xrqtb,BadWolf2386,9,Tue Mar 3 10:00:05 2015 UTC,one liner yes thats a posterboard and yes it is one line that connects where it starts.   for the longest time it was my side project when I first started drawing. it was a motivational thing to get me into the habit of drawing often (even if it was coloring). It took many hours to finish. I'm working on a collage but its mostly in the collecting phase at the moment (and has been for about a year now)
SketchDaily,2xrqtb,Chupka,9,Wed Mar 4 11:23:06 2015 UTC,"[This post probably violates at least one rule since it contains no art. Mods, if this is the case, feel free to delete. No hard feelings.]  Hokay! So, as I'm sure I've talked with several of you about, drawing sketchy bits and portraits is my side project. I started a little over a year ago as a form of depression therapy, and I think it's done a pretty bangup job at that. 6 months without a severe episode! It gave me something to improve on and show progress with, and I met so many genuinely amazing people along the way. Maybe drawing will become a more serious project soon--I am looking into commissions and prints these days, so it's only a matter of time--but that may still take a while. I even have a webcomic in mind that I'll start working on eventually, once I learn to draw backgrounds and better action poses.  Probably called The Aethernaut, but don't hold me to that.  Since drawing is the side project, I thought I'd share my main project: writing! I've been lazy about it lately, but I do have a ton of material already, and there are SO many more ideas that I'm ready to explore. I write genre fiction (i.e. fantasy/sci-fi/horror), nothing too high brow. I'd rather entertain, y'know. I have a zombie series available for sale, but I'm already pushing the limits on this post as it is, so I won't press them further with advertising. If you're interested, PM me, and I'll send you details.  The biggest project is a 550 to 600-page fantasy novel called Soulless, currently in its second draft and awaiting a few more passes before I make a push to have it published. Soulless is the tale of three ermen--a race of humanoids twin to humans themselves except for wings that allow them flight and the ability to harness magical energy--in an effort to reclaim the skies after their wings were taken. Also a human. And bloodmages. Trains! So much more, but I'd write here for days talking about it.  Oh right, I do have the first few chapters available. Just remember that these are second drafts.   Soulless - Chapter 1 Soulless - Chapter 2 Soulless - Chapter 3 Soulless - Chapter 4 Soulless - Chapter 5   I've been published twice by the same regional magazine--Calhoun County Insight--for their Halloween issue.  Coal Creek - Halloween 2013  Anchor - Halloween 2014  If you're into something shorter, I tried my hand at flash fiction some time ago. Breeze is a sub-200 word horror story.  On the other end of the short story spectrum is Her, a sci-fi(esque?) story that weighs in with just under 9,000 words.  I apologize for the wall of text instead of art, but it's something I'm passionate about. If you have the time today or in the coming days, please feel free to check out some of my stories (and drawings are also appreciated if you feel any inspiration!). If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading. i hope you enjoy, and I'll be back to posting drawings soon!"

The first one is called, for the moment, Subventure (yep, really not sure). It's about urban legends, city with an underground crazy life, society, mad scientists, frog-like mutant sewers mermaids, vigilantes, Guild of the Beggars and abandoned subway stations ruled by secret sects... and lots of stuffs.  Here are the main characters : http://mosqa.tumblr.com/image/57711868676  The second story is more fantasy based, in a world which oppose earth and see, sailors, warlocks, monsters and warlords, and a deceptive sneaky seducer that engage in a quest to reclaim his ""destiny"", stolen from him by a witch, which prevent him to die but also to achieve anything in his life that truly affect his surroundings. It's named, for the moment, ""la Fugitive"" (french for ""the Runaway Girl"") which is the current name of the main boat in the story.  Here are a bunch of character design I work on : https://mosqa.allyou.net/2821026/la-fugitive  By the way, I have to draw today, that's the point, not only to show already done work. So...

I can’t begin to express how grateful I am for that; she’s the nicest person I have met on the Internet.  ...anyway, I plan to turn it into a webcomic, and here are the first two prototype pages. The long-haired one is Owen. A friend of mine thought it was a girl, but he’s definitely a dude. The other one is Ryan.  Here are some old character sheets I was going to use during production of the comic. The lady is Heather, and she really is that much taller than Owen. He’s a short guy, she’s a tall woman.  Here is an updated Heather, that I did just now. It accounts both for general changes in my style (my approach to drawing hair’s what change the most), and deliberate changes in character design -- over time, I gave Heather narrower eyes and a square-ish nose, as you can see.  Of all my characters, Heather is at the top of my favorites list -- she’s tied in the first place with another one from an unrelated work --, so I draw her a lot. Here is one of my recent submissions, and here is an experiment I did in MyPaint with this drawing, with a brush I never used before. I accidentally flipped her hair here.

The game is about moving into a new flat, in a new city, in a new country. The flat is unfurnished… so the game is: furnishing time! You walk around the city, find things you need for your apartment, discover places, meet people.

Yesterday, I finished a redo of my old header image.  It is related to a story I wrote... a few years ago at this point, I think? I tried submitting it places and it just never stuck. Lots of 'close but not quite right' but never the elusive yes.   I've considered taking it into my own hands, but the last time I tried to turn a story into a comic, life punched me and I just haven't gone back.  I don't think this will be a standard comic. More an illustrated story, with minor animations. These are the things your prompt have pushed me to work on."

SketchDaily,2xg4im,Drudeboy,4,Sat Feb 28 09:14:42 2015 UTC,sorry for asking but why draws almost everyone the textures in spheres?
SketchDaily,2xg4im,Boodser,8,Sat Feb 28 11:31:10 2015 UTC,"Probably because on a sphere you get to see the texture from every angle, and you have light hitting the texture at every angle. And it's a simple shape, so you can focus on the texture rather than the shape of the object, both when drawing it and when comparing drawings."
SketchDaily,2xg4im,antonfire,7,Sat Feb 28 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"I did it because everyone else was doing it, but the other answers seem pretty reasonable to me.  Also because spheres are really easy starting shapes, so I can focus on the texture and not any extra details."

SketchDaily,2xg4im,Drudeboy,3,Sat Feb 28 11:45:14 2015 UTC,I think it's actually because it provides an additional challenge. You can't rely on the shape of the object to show what the texture is.
SketchDaily,2xg4im,Talariart,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:08:38 2015 UTC,"I am not sure, but i do know when using cinema 4d, your texture library is represented in spheres, maybe it is just an industry standard?"

I love the amazonite sphere, that's pretty hard to pull off, and you did it very well, especially the highlights :)  Your fur could do with a few more bigger/broader strokes in my opinion, it looks very straw-like to me - that being said though, I love the variety of shades used in it :D  The stone sphere is pretty nice, my only critique being that it should be shaded a little more, that's a little nitpicky of me though. You might also want to add some cast shadows underneath your spheres, so they don't look like they're floating in space :p.

SketchDaily,2xg4im,xulfir,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not really one to give advice, but I find that to create the illusion of a lot of detail in a drawing, it is best to spend some time on details in the focus of your piece, and then just hint at the details in parts that aren't the focus. For example with your frog skin, you could make some detailed bumps in the foreground, and in other places just imply that they're there by making little circular shapes. That way, you don't have to waste time shading every single bump."
SketchDaily,2xg4im,chikoritu,2,Sat Feb 28 20:36:44 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Thanks!
SketchDaily,2xg4im,xulfir,6,Sat Feb 28 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"Well, when I was working on my Ivysaur drawing I tried working with texture study in mind. I looked at moss, vines and leaves of the jungle (specifically ferns) and tried emulating them. However, I think I was better off not blurring the back so much. Because as much as Ivysaur pops from it, it was much more defined before. Underneath Ivysaur you can see the thick moss I tried to emulate."

SketchDaily,2xg4im,Boodser,2,Sat Feb 28 13:31:33 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to use different colors. Rather than just a straight luminosity change, pick a different saturation. Rocks especially really are not one color, but this applies to just about everything. Zero saturation isn't something that really exists in nature, so you can push that. (Like how your sphere one is a red-ish gray.)  Using a lower opacity can also help you get some variation in color with more layering.  Consider layering a contrasting color for the shadows, too. It's a great way to create grays without actually using gray.  I hope this makes sense...  Okay, so I just looked at the larger version of this, rather than the tiny things RES opened. So that other things still kinda apply, but I have more? If you are going to use a texture brush, don't be afraid to shade with that. Personally, I don't find brushes cheating. Especially something like ""airbrush"" or ""chalk"" or something like that. (Some days I feel different about things like paint splatters and the like, but that's a different story.)  This is extremely rambly, and I hope it makes sense. :) I love the shapes, there is some really subtle shading that I could only see in the larger one that I really enjoyed."
SketchDaily,2xg4im,FickleMuse,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Wow man, thanks for the help! I think I uderstand what you mean and I will try to experiment with it asap :D Just a quick question, what are some great brushes to paint/ render with? or is it just me not understanding how I need to use the brushes, I have this problem alot that I lift up my pen so I can decrese my brush size thereby I need to start over bcs there is the darker overlay like this. Is there any way I could prevent that from happening?"
SketchDaily,2xg4im,Boodser,2,Sat Feb 28 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those weird people who uses Painter and not Photoshop, so as for specific brushes, I'm afraid I can't be much help there. I've been in love with the watercolor brush lately, but I don't know if Photoshop has something comparable.   As for not getting the different shading, it might just be ignore the low opacity advice at just up it to 100. Or use the overlay? But as I said, someone else may be of more help for those technical things. If I'm working in the same layer, it doesn't do that for me.   Sorry."
SketchDaily,2xg4im,FickleMuse,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:42:48 2015 UTC,ah no problem :) I will look  at some speedpaintings maybe that can help me out aha
SketchDaily,2xg4im,Boodser,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Anything that has a gritty texture would probably work. Chalk, pastels, air brush if it is splattery. I'm not particularly good at tutorials, but this is kind of what I mean. The shape got away from me, but it works.... I think.   The third one got away, from me, but I thought I'd keep it. Instead of a flat brush doing the all the shading (4), add it with with texture as well."

The book is famous enough I think there should be no need to introduce anyone to it, but just in case: The Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka.  I am only 90% sure it was the last book I finished reading. I read it sometime in the second half of last year, and soon after I started reading a lot of manga from one particular author, and it’s all I’ve been reading since.

It contains many of my favorite things: hiking trails (with some steep hills, and some gentle elevation change), forest, meadow, marsh, views, a stream, a pond...and not a whole lot of parking (so there can't be too many other people around!).  Funny story: I've liked maps ever since I was a kid. For Mother's Day one year when I was in elementary school, we had to make books for our mothers. We were given blank white books, and could draw and write whatever we wanted on the pages. It has become a family joke that on one page, I drew a picture of me looking at a map, with the caption: ""My mom lets me look at maps!""  Ah, what an exciting childhood I had."

SketchDaily,2wz0zd,itspigeon,4,Tue Feb 24 09:08:02 2015 UTC,"ron Swanson  Also, I got a question How do i go about drawing from life? so far i have read 2 books, keys to drawing, and loomis figure drawing, bert says you shoul make the ouline the go deeper until you get a complete picture, and in figure drawing you draw 3d shapes to go from simple to detailed to make the person which one is the better method?,lets say i want to draw a flower, do i draw the outline of the flower and work from ther or should i like draw a cilinder for the future stem a circle of the center flower leaf like shapes to refine them later? Thanks"
SketchDaily,2wz0zd,AnonD,3,Wed Feb 25 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"Don't start with an outline. There is too much pressure to get it ""right"" any you will white knuckle the hell out of it. When drawing anything, the first stage is simple. For people, animals, organics, start with a gesture drawing to get the pose down. Gesture drawings can be essentially stick figures or they can become more detailed and be comprised of shapes. The most important thing is that you are fast and loose and aiming to capture the basic shape.  A gesture drawing should only take up maybe 20-30 seconds. The gesture is your skeleton, from there you can start to build volume and begin searching for more refined shapes. I suggest finding some youtube video or watching how drawing is approached by some one else who is more advanced."
SketchDaily,2wz0zd,hologramss,3,Tue Feb 24 09:49:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Keys to Drawing so forgive me if my interpretation is different. That being said I use outlines more as a composition tool, done super roughly to begin with so that I get my bearings scale wise.  Then I go on to do basic 3D shapes (ala Loomis, Hogarth) and build a more accurate outline around those.  Excluding the times where you do an outline for some kind of specific exercise of course.    So to take your example I might draw a rough circle and some boxes to represent leaves, move them about until I like the composition then start adding the petal shapes inside those guidelines."
SketchDaily,2wz0zd,Widlet,3,Tue Feb 24 12:22:52 2015 UTC,"sometimes changing perspective can be everything. we're so used to seeing the shapes that make up a face or a flower in their natural setting but if you were to hold a flower upside down or stand right above it looking down, you can sort of trick yourself into not seeing the flower as a whole but each individual shape that makes up the flower. this is a common technique in model making to get the depth and perspective right. there is no right way to do it, it all comes down to practice and patience. you have to keep experimenting until you find a way that works for you so you can build confidence. the initial steps are key and often the hardest part of the drawing (in my experience anyway). once you have the right shapes and proportions the rest comes about naturally. something you can try is to make exaggerated caricatures of things you see. it may seem a bit silly but if you can focus on the process first instead of a perfect result it could help.   ..with that said, i actually like your drawing quite a lot! you clearly have talent, just keep at it and don't be so hard on yourself!"

The only thing I can see that I can offer as a critique would be that the canoe looks a bit flat.  With the rubber duck, you've added some lines at the front to give a sense of roundness.  Something similar at the front of the canoe might help give it volume."
